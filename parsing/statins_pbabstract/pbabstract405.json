    "0": "The effects of lovastatin therapy on the parameters of body cholesterol metabolism were explored in nine hypercholesterolemic patients. Long-term cholesterol turnover studies were performed before therapy, and were repeated after 15 mo of lovastatin therapy (40 mg/d) while continuing on therapy. The major question addressed was whether a reduction in plasma cholesterol level with lovastatin would be associated with a reduction in the whole-body production rate of cholesterol or with the sizes of exchangeable body cholesterol pools as determined by the three-pool model of cholesterol turnover. The mean plasma cholesterol level decreased 19.4% (from 294 to 237 mg/dl), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased 23.8% (from 210 to 159 mg/dl) with lovastatin therapy. Changes in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level were not significant. The cholesterol production rate did not change significantly with therapy (1.09 +/- 0.10 [mean +/- S.D.] vs. 1.17 +/- 0.09 g/d). By comparison, colestipol and niacin treatment in three other subjects more than doubled the cholesterol production rate (1.14 +/- 0.28 vs. 2.42 +/- 0.34 g/d). Thus, hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibition by lovastatin at the therapeutic dose used here did not change the steady-state rate of whole-body cholesterol synthesis. Despite the changes in plasma cholesterol levels, no significant changes were seen in the values of M1, of M3 or of Mtot, the sizes of the pools of rapidly, of slowly, and of total body exchangeable cholesterol.", 
    "1": "lovastatin therapy to lower plasma cholesterol does not lead to corresponding reductions in body cholesterol pools or to a reduction in the rate of whole-body cholesterol synthesis. In the new steady state that exists during long-term lovastatin therapy, along with increased expression of the genes for HMG-CoA reductase and the LDL receptor, the body compensates for the effects of the drug so that cholesterol production rate and tissue pool sizes are not changed from pretreatment values.", 
    "2": "This study reviews the progress of 56 consecutive patients with type IIa and IIb hyperlipoproteinemia following treatment with lovastatin. Lovastatin, a potent inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, has been shown to have a cholesterol-lowering effect in doses ranging from 10 to 80 mg/d. Thus far, however, no large study has been performed to show the effectiveness of low-dose lovastatin (20 mg/d) for more than a 6-week duration. Fifty-six patients with known coronary artery disease were prospectively studied, with fasting lipid values being measured at baseline and after 6, 12, 18, and 24 weeks of 20-mg/d lovastatin therapy given as a single evening dose. The total cholesterol level fell 26% from a mean baseline of 8.12 mmol/L (314 mg/dL) and triglyceride levels fell by 12% from a mean baseline of 2.46 mmol/L. The high-density lipoprotein levels increased 7.6%. One patient with known preexisting liver disease was withdrawn from the study owing to an asymptomatic significant rise in liver function test results; one subject complaining of proximal muscle weakness was also withdrawn. The maximal decrease in total cholesterol level occurred within 6 weeks of initiation of therapy. We conclude that low-dose (20-mg/d) lovastatin was effective in lowering serum cholesterol levels in patients with primary type IIa or IIb hyperlipoproteinemia with minimal short-term side effects. Further studies are needed to establish the long-term safety and effectiveness of this drug.", 
    "3": "The hypocholesterolemic drug lovastatin (mevinolin) was found to be very effective in lowering the sterol levels of the wild-type yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Lovastatin dramatically decreased the steryl ester content from 2.62 to 0.8 micrograms/mg (dry weight), whereas the free sterol content decreased only from 2.79 to 2.24 micrograms/mg (dry weight) when lovastatin was present in the medium at 10 micrograms/ml. At higher concentrations (100 micrograms/ml), lovastatin nearly abolished the accumulation of steryl esters and decreased the free sterol concentration to less than 1.3 micrograms/mg (dry weight). As a result of the lowered sterol levels, proportional amounts of exogenous sterol were taken up from the medium during aerobic, respiratory conditions. Nearly all of the exogenous sterol taken up was partitioned into the free sterol fraction. The inhibition of sterol esterification in the presence of lovastatin was dependent on heme synthesis. The result of these combined effects caused the MICs of three azole antifungal drugs (ketoconazole, clotrimazole, and miconazole) to be lowered from 6- to 32-fold when lovastatin was present in the medium at 10 micrograms/ml.", 
    "4": "Thirteen patients with Hypercholesterolemia were selected for therapy with the new lipid-reducing agent LOVASTATIN The most important criterion for entrance was total cholesterol values over 250 mg/dl in spite of an appropriate diet. The initial dose was 20 mg daily. The patients were re-examined at four weeks intervals and the dose was increased in those with total cholesterol values over 200 mg/dl. In each re-examination they had a complete physical and determination of multiple laboratory parameters. Therapy with LOVASTATIN was effective. The total cholesterol levels decreased by 31% and LDL--cholesterol decreased by 40%. There were no significant changes in the levels of triglycerides or HDL-cholesterol. No important toxicity or side effects were associated with the use of this medication.", 
    "5": "We examined the effects of a prolonged treatment with lovastatin, a potent competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, on the morphology and function of rat Leydig cells. Twenty-four h after the first lovastatin injection, no conspicuous ultrastructural changes were found, but isolated Leydig cells showed a notable reduction in their basal and HCG-stimulated testosterone production. By prolonging lovastatin administration (daily injections for 3 and 5 days), Leydig cells progressively recovered their secretory activity, and this was associated with a striking proliferation of smooth endoplasmic reticulum and peroxisomes. The hypothesis is discussed that these morphologic changes are the counterpart of an enhanced newly synthesis of HMG-CoA reductase, that is the expression of a compensatory response of Leydig cells aimed at maintaining an adequate production of cholesterol (i.e. testosterone precursors) in spite of the chronic competitive inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by lovastatin.", 
    "6": "Seven hyperlipidemic postmenopausal women received 2.5 mg of simvastatin daily for six months, 5 mg for four months, and 2.5 mg for two months. During treatment, there were significant decreases in the patients' levels of plasma total cholesterol, phospholipids, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein (apo) B, apo E, and in the ratios of low-density lipoprotein:high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apo B:apo A-I. Levels of high-density triglycerides increased significantly. Blood pressures tended to decrease. No significant changes in the plasma levels of cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone, testosterone, progesterone, or plasma renin activity were noted. Plasma aldosterone levels decreased significantly after nine months of treatment, but remained within normal limits. No other treatment side effects were recorded.", 
    "7": "Hypercholesterolemia and increased concentrations of an apolipoprotein E (apoE)-containing HDL subclass, high density lipoprotein1 (HDL1) have been observed in streptozocin-alloxan diabetic dogs consuming normal amounts of dietary cholesterol. The aim of this study was to characterize the response of HDL1 and its targeting ligand, apoE, to insulin and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor treatment in pancreatectomized diabetic dogs. Following induction of diabetes, plasma total cholesterol, HDL1, and apoE concentrations were all increased. Urinary mevalonate excretion, an index of cholesterol synthesis in humans, was 6-fold that of nondiabetic controls. Lipoprotein fractionation by Pevikon block electrophoresis and gel filtration chromatography showed that the increased cholesterol and apoE were associated with alpha 2-migrating particles corresponding to HDL1. Insulin treatment, resulting in near normal fasting blood glucose concentrations in the group as a whole (average 5.1 mM, 92 mg/dl), led to variable reductions in apoE, total plasma cholesterol, and HDL1. Uncorrected dyslipidemia during intensified insulin treatment appeared to be related to failure to achieve euglycemia. Despite unremitting hyperglycemia, treatment with lovastatin resulted in pronounced decreases in plasma cholesterol, HDL1 and apoE to concentrations below those observed in nondiabetic animals. Mevalonate excretion also fell, but remained twice normal. Thus neither modality corrected all of the abnormalities in canine diabetic dyslipidemia. Since apoE-containing HDL1 may mediate cholesterol traffic between the periphery and the liver (reverse cholesterol transport), the present observations suggest that increased cholesterol synthesis is accompanied by parallel abnormalities in cholesterol flux through the reverse transport pathway in the canine model.", 
    "8": "There are three possible sources of cholesterol for immediate use in progesterone production by preovulatory human granulosa cells: follicular fluid high-density lipoprotein, de novo synthesis of cholesterol, and performed intracellular cholesteryl ester stores. In the present study these three alternatives were investigated. First, an in vitro model was established that mimics the preovulatory environment, including short-term cultures and use of autologous follicular fluid in the culture medium, instead of serum. Using this model it was found that the presence of high-density lipoprotein from follicular fluid in the culture medium did not affect the synthesis of progesterone by the granulosa cells. Next, addition of inhibitors of de novo sterol synthesis, like low-density lipoprotein, 25-OH cholesterol and compactin to the culture medium, did not reduce [14C]acetate incorporation into sterols and steroids by the cells. The sterol synthesis was accordingly interpreted to be at a low and therefore uninhibitable level. Finally, the content of free and esterified cholesterol in freshly isolated granulosa cells was found to be 50 +/- 7 and 52 +/- 13 pmol/mg cell protein, respectively. We suggest that neither follicular high-density lipoprotein nor endogenous synthesis is the immediate cholesterol source for the progesterone production in preovulatory human granulosa cells. However, granulosa cells have a large store of cholesteryl esters that may provide free cholesterol for the preovulatory progesterone production.", 
    "9": "A subchronic, toxicity study of lovastatin-acetaminophen combination in s/w mice is reported. Oral administration of lovastatin in corn oil 30 mg/kg three times a week and acetaminophen 0.75% w/v in drinking water for 13 weeks resulted in significant increase in SGPT (ALT) in both male and female mice. Histopathology of the liver revealed centrilobular hepatocyte swelling. These results provide evidence of hepatic injury in s/w mice when concomitantly exposed to lovastatin and acetaminophen.", 
    "10": "Simvastatin, a pro-drug lactone, forms the open carboxylic acid as a major metabolite that inhibits the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase. Simvastatin and the acid in plasma were quantified by a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry/selected ion monitoring (GC/MS/SIM) method. These drugs were separated by solid-phase extraction and independently converted into a 1,3-diol-type compound. This compound reacted with ferroceneboronic acid to yield the cyclic boronate that gave satisfactory mass spectra for GC/MS/SIM measurements. The serum was dominated by the molecular ion appearing as the base peak, thereby leading to a sensitive and selective assay. The calibration curves for simvastatin and the acid were linear in their concentration range of 0.1-10 ng ml-1, where the values of coefficient of variation for both drugs were below 8%, except for the value of 11% for simvastatin at a concentration of 0.1 ng ml-1. The quantification limit for both drugs was 0.1 ng ml-1 on the basis of a signal-to-noise ratio of 4:1.", 
    "11": "The new inhibitors of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase are synthetic compounds, of fungal origin, inhibiting a key and unidirectional enzyme in the sterol biosynthetic pathway. Lovastatin, simvastatin and pravastatin, currently available, differ, to some extent: lovastatin and simvastatin are inactive pro-drugs, undergoing conversion by the liver, most of their metabolites active. Pravastatin is instead active per se with mostly inactive metabolites. Distribution of the drugs and of their metabolites in different tissues, also depending upon the relative inhibitory activity, may result in different cholesterol lowering potency as well as in, eventually, some tissue selectivity. Otherwise, the plasma kinetics of the three agents is rather short, usually with a progressive decay of activity within 24 h from administration. Enzyme inhibition results in the upregulation of high affinity receptors for low density lipoproteins (LDL), whose clearance is markedly raised after treatment. Otherwise, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors do not affect to a significant extent the levels and/or composition of the other major lipoprotein fractions.", 
    "12": "The subjects were 40 hypercholesterolemic patients (mean age, 58 years) receiving a low-fat diet and randomly assigned to treatment with placebo for eight weeks or 40 or 80 mg of pravastatin, 24 gm of cholestyramine, or 40 mg of pravastatin plus 24 gm of cholestyramine daily for 24 weeks. After eight weeks of active treatment, levels of total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly reduced and the decline was maintained for the remaining 16 weeks. Parathyroid hormone levels and levels of the vitamin D metabolites 1,25(OH)2D3 and 25(OH)D3 did not change during treatment. The results indicate that 24 weeks of treatment with pravastatin and cholestyramine does not affect calcium metabolism.", 
    "13": "Forty patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) were treated with 40 mg pravastatin once daily. Pravastatin decreased serum total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) after 8 weeks of treatment by 28% and 33%, respectively, while high density lipoprotein cholesterol increased by 8% and triglycerides decreased by 14%. In 30 patients LDL cholesterol had not decreased below 5.0 mmol l-1 after 8 weeks of treatment, and in these patients resins were added to pravastatin, resulting in an additional decrease in total and LDL cholesterol of 8% and 12%, respectively. A control group of 22 FH patients was treated with placebo for 10 weeks, after which time resins were added, and they induced a decrease in total and LDL-cholesterol of 17% and 22%, respectively. Our results over a 24-week treatment period indicate that 40 mg pravastatin is more effective than 3 packets of resins in lowering LDL cholesterol, whereas the combination is most effective of all and can be used safely.", 
    "14": "The efficacy and safety of a new, selective inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis, pravastatin, and the bile acid-binding resin, cholestyramine, were compared in a randomized, double-blind study of 120 patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia. After a run-in period of 8-10 weeks with assessment of dietary habits, the patients were treated with pravastatin + placebo, placebo + cholestyramine, or placebo alone. Active pravastatin therapy was initiated with 10 mg b.i.d. for 6 weeks, and was increased to 20 mg b.i.d. for the following 6 weeks. Cholestyramine was given at 24 g d-1, or the highest tolerable dose. After 6 weeks of therapy, serum total and LDL cholesterol levels were reduced by 17% and 21%, respectively, on pravastatin treatment, whereas the corresponding reductions with cholestyramine treatment were 24% and 30%, respectively. With an increased dose of pravastatin, serum and LDL cholesterol concentrations were reduced by 23% and 28%, respectively, after 12 weeks; the effect of cholestyramine was unchanged. HDL cholesterol levels increased in response to pravastatin, by 7% and 9% after 6 and 12 weeks, respectively. Concomitant changes in the concentrations of apolipoproteins B and AI were observed. Three patients discontinued the study because of side-effects: two subjects were treated with pravastatin and one was given placebo. The prevalence of side-effects (including laboratory abnormalities) was 35% for pravastatin, 30% for placebo, and 53% (significantly higher) for cholestyramine. We conclude that pravastatin, in a 40 mg daily dose, is as effective as cholestyramine in lowering LDL cholesterol in familial hypercholesterolaemia. Since the frequency of side-effects is higher with cholestyramine, pravastatin offers a promising alternative for the therapy of this genetic disease.", 
    "15": "We investigated long-term hypolipidemic effects and clinical safety of simvastatin, a new competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase in 24 patients with familial and non-familial hypercholesterolemia. Patients received up to 40 mg simvastatin for a period of 30 months. Significant decreases were noted in plasma cholesterol (30%), plasma triglycerides (25%), very low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (26%), and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (40%), whereas an increase in plasma high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (11%) was observed. Furthermore, the percentage decrease in plasma low density lipoprotein cholesterol was independent of individual baseline concentrations. Simvastatin did not alter the composition of low density lipoproteins or high density lipoproteins. The percentage decrease in total plasma and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol was independent of apoprotein E isoforms and low density lipoprotein-receptor activity as assayed in cultured fibroblasts. The drug therapy was well tolerated and clinical examinations revealed no adverse effects. Clinical chemistry indices and hematological, as well as endocrinological parameters remained within normal limits and ranges.", 
    "16": "We have reported previously that squalene is the major radiolabeled nonsaponifiable lipid product derived from [3H]acetate in short term incubations of frog retinas (Keller, R. K., Fliesler, S. J., and Nellis, S. W. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 2250-2254). In the present study, we demonstrate that newly synthesized squalene is incorporated into rod outer segments under similar in vitro conditions. We show further that squalene is an endogenous constituent of frog rod outer segment membranes; its concentration is approximately 9.5 nmol/mumol of phospholipid or about 9% of the level of cholesterol. Pulse-chase experiments with radiolabeled precursors revealed no metabolism of outer segment squalene to sterols in up to 20 h of chase. Taken together with our previous absolute rate studies (Keller, R. K., Fliesler, S. J., and Nellis, S. W. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 2250-2254), these results suggest that most, if not all, of the squalene synthesized by the frog retina is transported to rod outer segments. Synthesis of protein is not required for squalene transport since puromycin had no effect on squalene incorporation into outer segments. Conversely, inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis with mevinolin had no effect on the incorporation of opsin into the outer segment. These latter results support the conclusion that the de novo synthesis and subsequent intracellular trafficking of opsin and isoprenoid lipids destined for the outer segment occur via independent mechanisms.", 
    "17": "A new antihypercholesterolemic drug, simvastatin (MK-733), which is a prodrug of a potent 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, inhibited cholesterol synthesis from [14C]acetate concentration dependently without inhibiting it from [3H]mevalonate in Hep G2 cells. Therefore, MK-733 is thought to be converted to L-654,969, the active beta-hydroxy acid form of MK-733 in the cells and/or medium. MK-733 inhibited cholesterol ester synthesis, but did not affect phospholipid, free fatty acid and triacylglycerol synthesis. This compound increased HMG-CoA reductase activity concentration dependently and raised the specific binding, internalization and degradation of 125I-labeled low density lipoprotein by Hep G2 cells. Another HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, pravastatin (CS-514), also behaved like MK-733. However, its potency was far less than that of MK-733.", 
    "18": "While there are definite data showing the correlation between cholesterol level and cardiovascular disease in adults, so far we lack reliable evidence showing hypercholesterolemia to be an important risk factor in the elderly as well. Having examined all available data, the authors come to the conclusion that in elderly subjects, too, hypercholesterolemia should be treated after careful clinical evaluation of every individual case. Whenever possible therapy should be dietary but in light of recent results obtained with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors which are effective and well tolerated also in the elderly, adequate pharmacological management should also be feasible in this type of patient.", 
    "19": "The intact, 100 kd microsomal enzyme and the 53 kd catalytic fragment of rat HMG-CoA reductase are both phosphorylated and inactivated by the AMP-activated protein kinase. Using the catalytic fragment, we have purified and sequenced peptides containing the single site of phosphorylation. Comparison with the amino acid sequence predicted from the cDNAs encoding other mammalian HMG-CoA reductases identifies this site as a serine residue close to the C-terminus (Ser872 in the human enzyme). Phosphopeptide mapping of native, 100 kd microsomal HMG-CoA reductase confirms that this C-terminal serine is the only major site phosphorylated in the intact enzyme by the AMP-activated protein kinase. The catalytic fragment of HMG-CoA reductase was also isolated from rat liver in the presence of protein phosphatase inhibitors under conditions where the enzyme is largely in the inactive form. HPLC, mass spectrometry and sequencing of the peptide containing Ser872 demonstrated that this site is highly phosphorylated in intact liver under these conditions. We have also identified by amino acid sequencing the N-terminus of the catalytic fragment, which corresponds to residue 423 of the human enzyme.", 
    "20": "The physiological disposition of fluvastatin, a potent inhibitor of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase and thus cholesterol synthesis, has been studied in the mouse, rat, dog, and monkey using 14C- or 3H-labeled drug. Oral doses of fluvastatin were absorbed at a moderate to rapid rate. The extent of absorption was dose-independent and was essentially complete in all four species studied. However, the drug was subject to extensive presystemic hepatic extraction followed by direct excretion via the bile, thus minimizing the systemic burden and yielding high liver/peripheral tissue concentration gradients for fluvastatin and its metabolites. Only at high doses far exceeding the intended human daily dose of ca 0.6 mg kg-1 did fluvastatin bioavailability approach unity, apparently due to saturation of the first-pass effect. Dose-normalized blood levels of fluvastatin and total radioactivity were higher in the dog than in the other species, suggesting a smaller distribution volume in the former. Fluvastatin was partially metabolized before excretion, the extent of metabolism being smallest in the dog and greatest in the mouse. The half-life of intact fluvastatin ranged from 1-2h in the monkey to 4-7h in the dog. Regardless of the dose or dose route, the administered radioactivity was recovered predominantly in feces, with the renal route accounting for less than 8 per cent of the dose. No tissue retention of radioactivity was observed, and material balance was essentially achieved within 96h after dosing.", 
    "21": "The pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety of pravastatin, a new selective 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, were evaluated during monotherapy and with subsequent concomitant cholestyramine therapy in 33 patients with primary hypercholesterolemia in this randomized study. After 4 weeks, pravastatin monotherapy (5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg twice daily) significantly decreased total cholesterol by 17% to 24% (p less than 0.001 versus baseline) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 23% to 35% (p less than 0.001). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased by 8% to 9%, and triglycerides decreased by 6% to 9%. The area under the serum concentration-time curve and maximum serum concentration of pravastatin showed dose-proportionality; time to maximum serum concentration and serum elimination half-life were independent of dose. When added to pravastatin therapy, cholestyramine enhanced the lipid-lowering effects of pravastatin. After 4 weeks of combination therapy, total cholesterol was reduced by 32% to 38% (p less than 0.001 versus baseline), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was reduced by 47% to 56% (p less than 0.001). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased by 11% to 18% (p less than 0.05). Pravastatin was well tolerated; no clinical adverse events directly attributable to the drug were reported.", 
    "22": "CI-981, a novel synthetic inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, was previously reported to be highly liver-selective using an ex vivo approach. In order to determine liver-selectivity at the cellular level, CI-981 was evaluated in cell culture and compared to lovastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin and BMY-21950. Using human cell lines, none of the compounds tested showed liver-selectivity, i.e. strong inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in Hep-G2 cells (liver model) but weak inhibition in human fibroblasts (peripheral cell model). In contrast, all drugs tested produced equal and potent inhibition of sterol synthesis in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes, and CI-981, pravastatin and BMY-21950 were more than 100-fold more potent in rat hepatocytes compared to human fibroblasts. Since all compounds were also equally potent at inhibiting sterol synthesis in a rat subcellular system and in vivo, the data suggest that the use of Hep-G2 cells may not be the cell system of choice in which to study inhibition of hepatic cholesterogenesis or to demonstrate liver selectivity of inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase.", 
    "23": "Inhibitors of the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, are now used frequently to treat hypercholesterolemia. We studied the effects of specific inhibition of cholesterol synthesis by one of these agents (pravastatin) on the hepatic metabolism of cholesterol in patients with gallstone disease who were scheduled to undergo cholecystectomy.", 
    "24": "Ten patients were treated with pravastatin (20 mg twice a day) for three weeks before cholecystectomy; 20 patients not treated served as controls. A liver specimen was obtained from each patient at operation, and the activities of rate-determining enzymes in cholesterol metabolism as well as low-density-lipoprotein (LDL)-receptor binding activity were determined.", 
    "25": "Pravastatin therapy reduced plasma total cholesterol by 26 percent and LDL cholesterol by 39 percent (P less than 0.005). Serum levels of free lathosterol, a precursor of cholesterol whose concentration reflects the rate of cholesterol synthesis in vivo, decreased by 63 percent (P less than 0.005), indicating reduced de novo biosynthesis of cholesterol. Microsomal HMG-CoA reductase activity, when analyzed in vitro in the absence of the inhibitor, was increased 11.8-fold (1344 +/- 311 vs. 105 +/- 14 pmol per minute per milligram of protein in the controls; P less than 0.001). The expression of LDL receptors was increased by 180 percent (P less than 0.005), whereas the activities of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (which governs bile acid synthesis) and of acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol O-acyltransferase (which regulates cholesterol esterification) were unaffected by treatment.", 
    "26": "Inhibition of hepatic HMG-CoA reductase by pravastatin results in an increased expression of hepatic LDL receptors, which explains the lowered plasma levels of LDL cholesterol.", 
    "27": "The effect of particle size and structural order/disorder of the lipid domain on the conformation and physiological behavior of lipid-associated apolipoprotein E (apoE) was evaluated. Circular dichroic (CD) spectra of apoE bound to large (LME) and small (SME) microemulsion particles, composed of dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (DMPC) and cholesteryl oleate (CO), and to DMPC disks revealed that at 4 degrees C, where all of the lipid constituents were in an ordered state, apoE bound to LME displayed approximately 60% alpha-helicity, while apoE bound to SME and DMPC disks displayed 73% and 95% helicity, respectively. Over the temperature range 4-50 degrees C, encompassing the lipid thermal transitions, only apoE bound to LME demonstrated an abrupt change in its CD spectrum (decrease in alpha-helicity) in response to temperature. To determine the source of the abrupt CD change, the constants for dissociation (Kd) of apoE from the surface of the large and small microemulsion particles were determined at 4, 25, and 37 degrees C. These results demonstrated that at 4 degrees C, the KdS for binding of apoE to the LME and SME were approximately equal; however, between 4 and 25 degrees C, there was a 5-fold increase in the Kd for binding of apoE to the LME, whereas the Kd for binding to the SME remained constant. The physiological effects of these differences in apoE secondary structure and equilibrium binding were examined by measuring the capacity of each apoE-containing particle to complete with LDL for binding to human fibroblasts, and by measuring the capacity of the apoE-microemulsion particles to suppress HMG-CoA reductase activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "28": "Tissue selectivity of pravastatin sodium (pravastatin) in inhibition of cholesterol synthesis was investigated and its effect was compared with other 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, such as lovastatin, simvastatin and ML-236B. Inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in vivo was measured by incorporation of radioactivity into the sterol fraction 1 h after intraperitoneal injection of [14C]acetate to mice. The drugs were orally administered to mice 2 h before the acetate injection. When pravastatin at a dose of 20 mg/kg was administered to mice, about 90% inhibition of cholesterol synthesis was observed in liver and ileum, but the inhibition was less than 14% in kidney, spleen, adrenal, testis, prostate and brain. This tissue selectivity of pravastatin was also demonstrated even in varying doses (5-100 mg/kg) and time (75-180 min) after drug administration. Other 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors did not show such a tissue-selective inhibition of sterol synthesis under the same conditions. These results obtained with the in vivo study were confirmed in vitro by the inhibition of sterol synthesis in various cultured cells and rats lenses, as well as by cellular uptake of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors.", 
    "29": "We investigated the effects of conditions that induce Ca2+ mobilization from intracellular stores and Ca2+ influx into hepatocytes on the expressed and total (fully dephosphorylated) activities of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase. Vasopressin and phenylephrine when added alone had small or negligible effects on the phosphorylation state of the enzyme, as judged from the expressed/total activity ratio. However, when added in combination with glucagon, they elicited appreciable increases in the phosphorylation of the enzyme. Glucagon on its own had no effect either on phosphorylation state or on total HMG-CoA reductase activity during 40 min of incubation. Under conditions of sustained Ca2+ influx (i.e. vasopressin or phenylephrine plus glucagon), there was a marked loss of total HMG-CoA reductase activity. This effect was more pronounced when vasopressin was used; 50% of the enzyme activity was lost within 40 min. The involvement of Ca2+ in these effects was verified directly by the use of ionophore A23187. Its addition to hepatocytes resulted both in a very pronounced increase in the phosphorylation state of the enzyme and in the loss of 50% of the total activity within 30 min. There was no correlation between the ability of any set of conditions to increase the phosphorylation of the enzyme and the subsequent loss of total HMG-CoA reductase activity. The latter parameter appeared to be directly related, however, to the maintenance of prolonged Ca2+ influx, as indicated by the continued activation of glycogen phosphorylase, measured in the same cells. The lack of a causal relationship between increased phosphorylation and loss of total activity was demonstrated directly by studies in which okadaic acid was used to induce phosphorylation of HMG-CoA reductase in hepatocytes by inhibition of phosphatase 1 and 2A activities. This was not accompanied by any loss of total enzyme activity. Neither did okadaic acid enhance the loss of reductase induced by A23187 when the two agents were added together. It is concluded that altered Ca2+ fluxes in hepatocytes in vivo, under conditions of acute or chronic stress (such as may be associated with trauma or diabetes respectively), may be involved in the regulation of the expression of HMG-CoA reductase activity through alteration of enzyme concentration in the liver.", 
    "30": "The heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins act at the inner surface of the plasma membrane to relay information from cell surface receptors to effectors inside the cell. These G proteins are not integral membrane proteins, yet are membrane associated. The processing and function of the gamma subunit of the yeast G protein involved in mating-pheromone signal transduction was found to be affected by the same mutations that block ras processing. The nature of these mutations implied that the gamma subunit was polyisoprenylated and that this modification was necessary for membrane association and biological activity.

All patients had serum creatine kinase levels of more than 10,000 U/L, 4 tested showed myoglobinuria, and 5 had acute renal failure. The patients' symptoms resolved when both drugs were discontinued. For the first year of marketing of lovastatin, spontaneous reports of myopathy with documentation of creatine kinase level were reviewed for the use of lovastatin, gemfibrozil, and combination therapy. The median creatine kinase level in reports involving concomitant lovastatin and gemfibrozil use was 15,250 U/L, 20 times that in reports with gemfibrozil use alone and 30 times that in reports with lovastatin use alone. Because of the potential for severe myopathy and life-threatening rhabdomyolysis, and given alternative drug combinations for treating hyperlipoproteinemia, the use of lovastatin in combination with gemfibrozil is to be discouraged.", 
    "32": "Hepatic specificity of inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase may be achieved by efficient first-pass liver extraction resulting in low circulating drug levels, as with lovastatin, or by lower cellular uptake in peripheral tissues, seen with pravastatin. BMY-21950 and its lactone form BMY-22089, new synthetic inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, were compared with the major reference agent lovastatin and with the synthetic inhibitor fluindostatin in several in vitro and in vivo models of potency and tissue selectivity. The kinetic mechanism and the potency of BMY-21950 as a competitive inhibitor of isolated HMG-CoA reductase were comparable to the reference agents. The inhibitory potency (cholesterol synthesis assayed by 3H2O or [14C]acetate incorporation) of BMY-21950 in rat hepatocytes (IC50 = 21 nM) and dog liver slices (IC50 = 23 nM) equalled or exceeded the potencies of the reference agents. Hepatic cholesterol synthesis in vivo in rats was effectively inhibited by BMY-21950 and its lactone form BMY-22089 (ED50 = 0.1 mg/kg p.o.), but oral doses (20 mg/kg) that suppressed liver synthesis by 83-95% inhibited sterol synthesis by only 17-24% in the ileum. In contrast, equivalent doses of lovastatin markedly inhibited cholesterol synthesis in both organs. In tissue slices from rat ileum, cell dispersions from testes, adrenal, and spleen, and in bovine ocular lens epithelial cells, BMY-21950 inhibited sterol synthesis weakly in vitro with IC50 values 76- and 188-times higher than in hepatocytes; similar effects were seen for BMY-22089. However, the IC50 ratios (tissue/hepatocyte) for lovastatin and fluindostatin were near unity in these models. Thus, BMY-21950 and BMY-22089 are the first potent synthetic HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that possess a very high degree of liver selectivity based upon differential inhibition sensitivities in tissues. This cellular uptake-based property of hepatic specificity of BMY-21950 and BMY-22089, also manifest in pravastatin, is biochemically distinct from the pharmacodynamic-based disposition of lovastatin, which along with fluindostatin exhibited potent inhibition in all tissues that were exposed to it.", 
    "33": "Optimally effective lipid-lowering agents should not only restore plasma lipids to normal levels but also correct potentially atherogenic alterations in lipoprotein composition and function often present in hyperlipidemic patients. Lovastatin, a competitive inhibitor of cholesterol biosynthesis, clearly lowers plasma cholesterol levels. Its effects on lipoprotein composition and cholesteryl ester transfer (CET), a key step in reverse cholesterol transport, however, are not known. Since abnormalities in CET and lipoprotein composition are present in patients with hypercholesterolemia, we studied these parameters of plasma lipoprotein transport in twelve hypercholesterolemic (HC; Type IIa) subjects (six male, six female) before and 2 months after lovastatin treatment (20 mg qd). Before lovastatin, the free cholesterol (FC)/lecithin (L) ratio in plasma, a new index of cardiovascular risk that reflects lipoprotein surface composition, was abnormally increased (1.18 +/- 0.26 vs controls 0.83 +/- 0.14; P less than 0.001) in very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and high density lipoprotein-3 (HDL3), and remained so after treatment despite significant declines in whole plasma cholesterol (311.7 +/- 68.2 vs 215.6 +/- 27.2 mg/dl; P less than 0.001), low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (206.3 +/- 47.9 vs 146.8 +/- 29.4; P less than 0.001), and apolipoprotein B (149 +/- 30 vs 110 +/- 17; P less than 0.005).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "34": "In a group of 120 patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) the influence of the apolipoprotein E (apoE) polymorphism on pre-treatment plasma lipid levels and on the response to treatment with simvastatin was studied. The apoE phenotype distribution did not differ significantly between the FH group and a sample group of the Dutch population. Differences in pre-treatment lipid levels were not related to the apoE polymorphism in this FH population. After 12 weeks use of a daily dose of 40 mg simvastatin, the plasma total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and plasma triglyceride levels were reduced on average by 33%, 38% and 19%, respectively. At the same time high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol concentration increased on average by 7%. In the combined FH patient group (males and females) a considerable interindividual variation in response to simvastatin was observed, but was not related to the apoE polymorphism. However, considering males and females separately, we found that female FH patients with the apoE3E3 phenotype responded better on simvastatin treatment with respect to LDL-cholesterol than male FH patients with the apoE3E3 phenotype.", 
    "35": "To assess the effect of lovastatin on blood rheology, the hemorheological determinants fibrinogen, red cell aggregation, plasma viscosity, hematocrit and platelet aggregation (spontaneous and ADP-induced) were studied in 15 patients with type II hyperlipoproteinemia in the course of treatment with lovastatin. Prior to therapy, fibrinogen (Fgen), red cell aggregation (RCA-S, RCA-L) and plasma viscosity (PV) as well as cholesterol (Chol) and triglycerides (Tg) were increased in the hyperlipemic patients compared with healthy normolipemic controls (Fgen: 319.3 +/- 65 vs. 269.8 +/- 48 mg/dl; RCA-S: 7.93 +/- 1 vs. 6.62 +/- 1, RCA-L: 9.86 +/- 1 vs. 7.8 +/- 1 arbitrary units; PV: 1.75 vs. 1.63 mPa/s; Chol: 317.0 +/- 32 vs. 176.5 +/- 21 mg/dl; Tg: 154.5 +/- 88 vs. 72.8 +/- 16 mg/dl; all P less than 0.05). Three months of treatment with lovastatin resulted in a marked decrease in red cell aggregation and plasma viscosity, parallel to a fall in cholesterol (the following pretreatment values were monitored after a standard lipid-lowering diet; RCA-S: 7.59 +/- 1 vs. 6.65 +/- 0.9, RCA-L: 9.34 +/- 1 vs. 8.15 +/- 1 arbitrary units; PV: 1.74 vs. 1.65 mPa/s; Chol: 309.8 +/- 41 vs. 217.1 +/- 30 mg/dl; all P less than 0.01); fibrinogen however, remained unchanged throughout the treatment period (346.4 +/- 73.3 vs. 330.5 +/- 70.2 mg/dl, n.s.).

    "36": "A causal link between hypercholesterolemia due to elevated plasma concentrations of LDL and VLDL remnants of CAPD patients has been established. The effects of 24 weeks of treatment with Simvastatin, a new HMG coenzyme A-reductase inhibitor (at 20 and 40 mg/day) on serum lipid, lipoprotein, and apolipoprotein A-I and B concentrations, as well as safety parameters and subjective side effects, were evaluated in eight patients (mean duration CAPD 24.80 +/- 7.50 months, age 54.50 +/- 13.70 years). Maximal effects on plasma lipoprotein and apolipoprotein concentrations were achieved after 4 weeks, and remained stable thereafter during the study. Mean fasting plasma cholesterol concentrations decreased from 280.5 +/- 60.2 mg% to 190.2 +/- 40.4 mg/dl (p less than 0.005) (-47%); mean plasma LDL-cholesterol concentrations also decreased from 257.6 +/- 13.4 mg% to 190.5 +/- 15.4 mg/dl (p less than 0.001) (-35%). Apolipoprotein A and B concentrations decreased significantly from 1.78 +/- 0.19 to 1.40 +/- 0.22 g/L (p less than .005) and 1.81 +/- 0.26 to 1.38 +/- 0.20 g/L (p less than .005). These data substantiate the view that Simvastatin is well tolerated and that no serious clinical or adverse laboratory effects have been observed. It appears to be a promising drug for the effective control of hyperlipemia in a large proportion of hypercholesterolemic patients, reducing their cardiovascular morbidity while on CAPD.", 
    "37": "Homozygous familiar hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a serious inherited disease caused by a genetic defect in the cell surface receptor that controls the degradation of low density lipoprotein (LDL). These patients often have myocardial infarction in their teens or early adulthood and are usually unresponsive to drugs. Recently it has been reported promising results using combined drugs regimens in patients with residual receptor activity. We report a new additional patient with receptor-defective homozygous FH treated with a combination of lovastatin and cholestyramine. The cholesterol levels were reduced in a 67% and there were adverse events related to treatment during a 7 month period of follow-up.", 
    "38": "A 7-year-old girl with homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia and plasma low-density lipoprotein(LDL)-cholesterol levels of 820 mg/dl (21.2 mmol/l) and progressive xanthomata was treated with heparin extracorporeal low-density lipoprotein precipitation (HELP) to lower her plasma LDL. On weekly HELP treatment she maintained her pre-HELP treatment LDL-cholesterol levels at 409 mg/dl (10.6 mmol/l). The long-term HELP treatment was well tolerated and led to regression of her xanthomata. Subsequently, lovastatin [Mevacor; Merck Sharp & Dohme, Westpoint, Pa., USA (20 mg/day)] was added to the regimen, causing a further 20% decrease in her pre-HELP treatment plasma LDL-cholesterol levels. Lovastatin alone did not sufficiently lower her plasma LDL and could not replace the weekly HELP therapy. Our data show that lovastatin is an effective adjunctive therapy for lowering plasma LDL-cholesterol in a homozygous patient, once plasma LDL levels have already been lowered by regular HELP treatment.", 
    "39": "Mevinolin, an inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis, was used to study the effect of endogenous cholesterol synthesis on the morphology and function of differentiating and differentiated fetal rat adrenocortical cells grown in primary culture. Upon adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) stimulation under conditions in which endogenous cholesterol synthesis was inhibited but exogenous (lipoprotein) cholesterol was available, the cells differentiated normally from glomerulosa-like to fasciculata-like cells; the steroid hormone secretion was maximally induced. Under conditions in which cholesterol synthesis was maximally inhibited by mevinolin and the cells had no access to exogenous cholesterol, the cells did not differentiate into fasciculata-like cells; the ACTH-induced steroid response was highly suppressed under these conditions. The addition of either human low-density lipoprotein (LDL) or high-density lipoprotein (HDL3) to the culture medium restored the ACTH-induced differentiation and steroid secretion. Thus, in the absence of exogenous cholesterol, endogenous cholesterol synthesis was a prerequisite for differentiation. In cultures grown in the presence of exogenous cholesterol and ACTH with mevinolin-inhibited cholesterol synthesis and high steroid output, an increase in cytoplasmic lipids was evident, suggesting upregulation of LDL and HDL receptors. The results also demonstrated that induction of phenotypic differentiation from glomerulosa-like into fasciculata-like cells can proceed in the presence of a cholesterol synthesis inhibitor like mevinolin; this differentiation in the absence of endogenous cholesterol synthesis is accompanied by the appearance of cytoplasmic cholesterol ester droplets, typical of fasciculata cells.", 
    "40": "We investigated the possibility that established atherosclerosis and xanthomas in mature WHHL rabbits could be suppressed or even regressed when their serum cholesterol levels were kept extremely low. Ten-month-old WHHL rabbits were divided into 3 groups, i.e. control rabbits, sacrificed at age 10 months, and placebo and treated rabbits, sacrificed at age 18 months. The treated rabbits were given pravastatin sodium (50 mg/kg/day), an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, in combination with cholestyramine (2% in diet), a bile acid sequestrant, for 36 weeks. The serum cholesterol levels and atherogenic lipoproteins in the treated group were markedly reduced, by about 60% (P less than 0.005 and P less than 0.001). Consequently, the degrees of both coronary and aortic atherosclerosis in the treated group were significantly reduced compared with the placebo group, and were almost the same as in the control group. The histopathological findings supported the above results. In addition, the incidence and degree of xanthomas in digital joints in the treated group were significantly reduced. These results suggest that established atherosclerosis and xanthomas in mature WHHL rabbits could be suppressed by keeping their serum cholesterol levels extremely low by the combination drug treatment.", 
    "41": "Besides cholesterol, mevalonate is the precursor of several isoprenoid compounds including the farnesyl moiety of isoprenylated proteins. Inhibition of mevalonate biosynthesis leads to a growth arrest that can be relieved by addition of mevalonate, but not of cholesterol. To get a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying this growth inhibition, we have investigated whether mevalonate derivatives are implicated in the early response to growth factors. Our results show that pretreatment of quiescent human fibroblasts with mevinolin, an HMG CoA reductase inhibitor, partially suppresses fos and myc mRNA accumulation in response to serum stimulation. This effect of mevalonate deprivation appears to be on the transcriptional regulation of fos and does not depend upon the nature of the initial events of signal transduction, since the same phenomenon was observed following EGF and TPA stimulation.", 
    "42": "Simvastatin (SV), an analog of lovastatin, is the lactone form of 1', 2', 6', 7', 8', 8a'-hexahydro-3,5-dihydroxy-2', 6'-dimethyl-8' (2\", 2\"-dimethyl-1\"-oxobutoxy)-1'-naphthalene-heptanoic acid (SVA) which lowers plasma cholesterol by inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase. SV but not its corresponding hydroxy acid form SVA underwent microsomal metabolism. Major in vitro metabolites were 6'-OH-SV (I) and 3\"-OH-SV (III) formed by allylic and aliphatic hydroxylation, respectively, and 6'-exomethylene-SV (IV) formed by dehydrogenation. In rats, dogs, and humans, biliary excretion is the major route of elimination. Biliary metabolites (as both hydroxy acids and lactones) also included 6'-CH2OH-SV (V) and 6'-COOH-SV (VI) in both of which the 6'-chiral center had been inverted. High levels of esterase in rodent plasma favored the formation of SVA from SV. The formation of 1', 2', 6', 7', 8', 8a'-hexahydro-2', 6'-dimethyl-8'-(2\",2\"-dimethyl-1-oxobutoxy)-1'-naphthalene-pentano ic acid (VII) only in rodents represented a species difference in the metabolism of SV. It is proposed that VII is formed by beta-oxidation pathways of fatty acid intermediary metabolism. Several metabolites resulting from microsomal oxidation (after subsequent conversion from lactones to hydroxy acids) are effective inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase and may contribute to the cholesterol lowering effect of SV. Qualitatively, the metabolism of SV closely resembles that of lovastatin.", 
    "43": "We have directly tested the ability of acetoacetate, upon activation to the CoA thioester, to channel into the cholesterogenic pathway prior to scrambling of its carbon skeleton with the acetate pool. The approach relies upon trapping [3-13C]acetoacetate-derived hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA, hydrolyzing this metabolite, and esterifying the resulting hydroxymethylglutaric acid to allow gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis of the dimethyl esters for the 13C enrichment and labeling pattern. 99% enriched [3-13C] and [1,3,5-13C]hydroxymethylglutaric acid samples were synthesized, providing standards against which physiological samples could be compared. Cytosolic extracts from brain and liver of cholestyramine-fed rats were incubated with [3-13C]acetoacetate (2 mM) or with [1-13C]acetate (5 mM). In contrast to [13C]acetate-derived hydroxymethylglutarate, which shows the expected triple labeling pattern, [13C]acetoacetate-derived hydroxymethylglutarate from both liver and brain extracts is predominantly monolabeled. These data suggest that, after acetoacetate is activated to the CoA thioester, cytosolic hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase effectively commits much of this acetoacetyl-CoA to cholesterogenesis before thiolase can scramble the carbon skeleton of the acetoacetyl moiety into the acetate pool. This chemical approach represents an alternative method for testing the channeling of metabolites through sequential steps in a metabolic pathway. Such a method may be useful when physical or kinetic techniques prove to be unsuitable.", 
    "44": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA synthase was shown to be inhibited in a time-dependent, irreversible manner by compounds containing the substituted beta-lactone functionality found in the natural product 1233A. The rate of inactivation (kinact) was found to approach the rate of catalysis (kcat). The inactivation was irreversible over several hours. A related compound lacking the hydroxymethyl substituent on the beta-lactone ring is a reversible inhibitor and is competitive with respect to acetylCoA. The results are consistent with beta-lactone ring opening by the active site Cys to form an enzyme bound thioester.", 
    "45": "The relation between carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) activity and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity was investigated. Rats were treated with aminocarnitine or 1-carnitine overnight. In rats, in which CPT activity was inhibited by aminocarnitine, plasma and hepatic triacylglycerol contents were increased 5- to 6-fold. The plasma cholesterol concentration was unchanged, while the hepatic cholesterol content was lowered (-16%). Hepatic cholesterol synthesis, determined by following the incorporation of 14C-acetate and 3H2O into digitonin-precipitable sterols, in liver slices was increased 5- to 7-fold. HMG-CoA reductase activity in liver microsomes was increased to the same extent.", 
    "46": "Rats were fed for 1 week with a standard chow diet, a diet supplemented with lovastatin (0.1%), or a diet supplemented with both lovastatin and cholesterol (0.1/0.1%), to study effects of depletion of a putative hepatic metabolic pool of cholesterol on secretion of the very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) in the intact animal. Triton WR-1339 (50 mg/100 g body wt.) or the 0.9% NaCl vehicle alone was given intravenously via a sacral vein. Treatment with lovastatin decreased the secretion of all plasma VLDL lipids, the average decrease after 2 h for VLDL triacylglycerol, phospholipid, cholesterol and cholesteryl ester being 45%. When both lovastatin and cholesterol were included in the diet, the secretion of VLDL triacylglycerol and phospholipid was similar to that of control animals, while secretion of VLDL cholesterol and cholesteryl ester was increased. Treatment with lovastatin reduced the hepatic concentration of cholesteryl esters 42% without affecting free cholesterol. In separate experiments, in vivo synthesis of cholesterol was determined 1 h after intraperitoneal administration of 3H2O. Incorporation into hepatic and plasma free cholesterol and cholesteryl esters was greater in the rats fed lovastatin than in control animals, concurrent with decreased VLDL secretion. The metabolism of VLDL was determined in vivo by intravenous administration of 125I-VLDL. The fractional clearance rates of 125I-VLDL from the plasma were similar among the three experimental groups. Synthesis of hepatic triacylglycerol from [1-14C]oleate in vivo was similar in all treatment groups; incorporation into plasma triacylglycerol was reduced with lovastatin treatment and reversed partially by inclusion of 0.1% cholesterol in the lovastatin diet. Plasma concentrations of triacylglycerol followed patterns of incorporation of [1-14C]oleate. Triacylglycerol concentration in the liver increased when cholesterol was included in the diet. In companion experiments, incorporation of [1-14C]oleate into perfusate triacylglycerol in vitro was reduced with perfused livers from lovastatin-treated animals. In these experiments, oxidation of fatty acid into CO2 and perchloric acid-soluble counts was not affected by lovastatin, added either to the diet or to the perfusate in vitro. It appears, therefore, that lovastatin does not affect triacylglycerol synthesis or fatty acid oxidation, which per se might reduce formation and secretion of VLDL. These data, therefore, strengthen the hypothesis that reduced availability of cholesterol in a putative hepatic metabolic pool, required for secretion and transport of triacylglycerol in the VLDL, is a factor contributing to decreased secretion of the VLDL.", 
    "47": "Serum concentrations of apolipoprotein(a) were measured in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia. The levels in 47 patients were a median of 2.5 times higher than those in controls matched for age and sex (240 [range 25-1245] vs 97 [7-1040] mg/l). Among patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia apo(a) levels were higher in those with (n = 48) than in those without (n = 72) ischaemic heart disease (283 [18-1245] vs 144 [7-741] mg/l); both in univariate and multivariate analysis serum apo(a) was the most significant variable distinguishing between the groups. Despite reducing LDL cholesterol by 30%, treatment with cholestyramine or pravastatin did not reduce apo(a) levels in these patients. These findings support the concept that apo(a) concentration is a genetic trait predisposing to ischaemic heart disease and imply that it may be useful in the identification of familial hypercholesterolaemia patients at high risk of coronary disease.", 
    "48": "The effects of mevinolin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase inhibitor and bezafibrate, a modulator of lipoprotein metabolism, were measured on BM 15.766-induced 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) accumulation in liver and serum of rats. BM 15.766, an inhibitor of delta 7 sterol reductase, leads to an accumulation of 7-DHC, which can be used as a measure of cholesterol (CH) synthesis de novo. The investigations were carried out to evaluate the usefulness of this new non-isotopic in vivo method for testing compounds that affect directly and indirectly the CH-biosynthetic pathway. Mevinolin showed a dose-dependent reduction of BM 15.766-induced 7-DHC accumulation after a single oral dose. The dose range for reduction of 7-DHC in the liver of rats was comparable with that for serum CH-lowering in humans. Bezafibrate reduced the BM 15.766-induced 7-DHC accumulation in liver in a dose- and time-dependent manner. These findings agree with the reported reduced activity of HMG-CoA reductase and support the view, that bezafibrate reduces CH biosynthesis by modulation of lipoprotein metabolism. The 7-DHC levels in serum do not reflect those in the liver and cannot be used as a measure of CH biosynthesis. The investigations show that BM 15.766-induced 7-DHC accumulation in liver of rats is an appropriate measure for CH de novo synthesis and can be used for testing compounds that interfere directly and indirectly with the CH-biosynthetic pathway. In contrast to previously described methods, no radiolabelled precursors are necessary.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "49": "Extracorporeal procedures to eliminate LDL from plasma now allow us to drastically lower the plasma LDL-concentrations to virtually every desired level. In a new therapeutic approach the combination of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors with an LDL/fibrinogen apheresis procedure (the HELP-system) was evaluated in hypercholesterolemic CAD-patients. HELP treatment alone can lower the mean plasma LDL-cholesterol by about 50-60%, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor therapy reduces the LDL-cholesterol by about 40%. The combination of both treatments resulted in a lowering of mean LDL-cholesterol to about 80% of baseline values. Improvement of blood rheology by lowering plasma viscosity and inhibiting erythrocyte aggregation became apparent. No relevant adverse effects were noted over a period of two years. This therapeutic strategy for maximal LDL-cholesterol lowering may be useful in secondary prevention of coronary heart disease in hypercholesterolemic patients if plasma LDL-C cannot be reduced by diet and drug treatment to desirable plasma levels (LDL-cholesterol less than 120 mg/dl). Preliminary data show an improvement in the symptoms of our CAD-patients treated with this combined therapy. Furthermore, within the near future a combined HELP and dialysis unit will be available for patients with terminal renal insufficiency and progressive atherosclerosis.", 
    "50": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are a new class of drugs, which inhibit de novo cholesterol biosynthesis and significantly reduces the blood cholesterol concentrations. Three separate inhibitors, lovastatin, simvastatin and pravastatin can lower plasma total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in hypercholesterolemic humans by 20 to 30% and 30 to 40%, respectively. The reduction in the levels of circulating atherogenic lipoprotein particles occurs as a result of decreased synthesis and enhanced removal of LDLs by the LDL receptor pathway in hepatocytes. Moreover, the levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL-)cholesterol, which are inversely related to atherosclerosis, increase with treatment by these drugs. If the short-term safety of these drugs extends to ongoing longterm studies and if cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are improved by their use, these hypolipidemic agents will facilitate the effective treatment of hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "51": "Many patients with high levels of serum total cholesterol have a concomitant elevation of serum triglyceride levels and thus have mixed hyperlipidemia. In this study, 13 patients with mixed hyperlipidemia were treated with the cholesterol-lowering drug lovastatin to determine its effectiveness. In 9 of these patients, lovastatin therapy used alone was compared with the drug combination of lovastatin and gemfibrozil. In the 13 patients, lovastatin therapy produced a 31% reduction in total cholesterol level and a 32% decrease in triglyceride levels compared with placebo. It lowered very-low-density plus intermediate-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 40%, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 36%, and total apolipoprotein B levels by 28%. Concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I were unchanged, but total cholesterol (and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol)/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratios were markedly reduced. Compared with lovastatin alone, lovastatin plus gemfibrozil produced greater decreases in very-low-density plus intermediate-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and an increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, but, in view of the higher risk for severe myopathy with this combination, lovastatin used alone may be adequate therapy for many patients with mixed hyperlipidemia.", 
    "52": "The present study was undertaken to investigate the mechanism for control of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase and cytochrome P-450 side chain cleavage (P-450scc), enzymes involved in the synthesis and processing of cholesterol in the corpus luteum of pregnant rats. The role of sterol and estradiol were investigated by administering 4-aminopyrazolo-[3,4d]pyrimidine (4-APP), aminoglutethimide and/or estradiol to day 12 hypophysectomized-hysterectomized pregnant rats. Estradiol treatment markedly increased mRNA levels of HMG-CoA reductase in the corpus luteum. This stimulatory effect of estradiol was specific for the reductase since the mRNA for luteal P-450scc did not increase following estradiol treatment. To determine whether estradiol's action on HMG-CoA reductase mRNA was mediated by changes in cellular free cholesterol, the separate and combined action of estradiol and either 4-APP or aminoglutethimide on both sterol content and HMG-CoA reductase expression was examined. The estradiol induced rise in HMG-CoA reductase was not accompanied by a decrease in luteal cholesterol. 4-APP treatment depleted cholesterol in the corpus luteum and induced a greater increase in HMG-CoA reductase mRNA than estradiol. Combined treatment with estradiol and 4-APP resulted in a synergistic increase in HMG-CoA reductase mRNA despite the fact that estradiol did not further reduce the 4-APP induced decrease in luteal sterol content. This indicates that luteal cells possess an estradiol-mediated mechanism for up-regulation of HMG-CoA reductase gene expression which is distinct from the cholesterol negative feedback regulation. However, estradiol stimulation of HMG-CoA reductase was totally inhibited when sterol content was elevated by aminoglutethimide, suggesting that estradiol stimulation of HMG-CoA reductase expression is not sufficient to overcome the negative regulatory effect of cholesterol. In contrast to HMG-CoA reductase mRNA which appears to be controlled by sterol and estradiol, P-450scc mRNA levels remained constant in corpora lutea despite wide changes in sterol and steroid content induced by either 4-APP, aminoglutethimide or estradiol treatment. However, interestingly, aminoglutethimide increased substantially the content of P-450scc protein. This increase in P-450scc enzyme was not due to a greater amount of translatable message since similar levels of immunoprecipitable 35S-P-450scc were translated in vitro from luteal mRNA of rats treated with or without aminoglutethimide. In summary, results of this investigation have revealed that the expression of HMG-CoA reductase and cytochrome P-450scc are controlled by totally different mechanisms in the rat corpus luteum.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "53": "The effects of lovastatin and ursodeoxycholic acid on cholesterol saturation of gallbladder bile were examined, alone and in combination. Nine volunteers were studied before any treatment and after each of three treatment periods: lovastatin, 40 mg, twice a day; ursodeoxycholic acid, 10 mg/kg per day; and the combination of both drugs. Treatment periods were randomly ordered, lasted 4-5 wk, and each was preceded by a 3-wk washout period. Mean cholesterol saturation index decreased from a baseline value of 1.40-0.92 on lovastatin (p less than 0.008). Mean cholesterol saturation index on ursodeoxycholic acid was 0.87 and decreased to 0.70 with the addition of lovastatin (p less than 0.030). There was a strong correlation (r = 0.87, p less than 0.003) between saturation index on ursodeoxycholic acid and the further incremental reduction in saturation index with addition of lovastatin. These findings raise the possibility that addition of lovastatin to ursodeoxycholic acid treatment might improve the efficacy of this bile salt for dissolution of cholesterol gallstones, especially in patients with a suboptimal response to ursodeoxycholic acid.",

    "56": "There were significant reductions of total cholesterol (-26.4%), triglycerides (-16.0%), LDL-cholesterol (-35.2%), VLDL-cholesterol (-15.4%), TC/HDL-C (-30.7%), and LDL/HDL-C (-39.5%). There was significant elevation of HDL-cholesterol (+5.2%), although this response was not uniform. The drug was well tolerated: only five patients reported transient clinical adverse experiences that subsided spontaneously. Two patients had elevation of CPK and one of TGP. The drug did not have to be discontinued in any case. Ophthalmological examinations performed before treatment compared to examinations at the end of the study showed no signficant alterations.", 
    "57": "Simvastatin in elderly patients appeared to be a potent TC and LDL-C lowering drug and presented mild but significant effect on the elevation of HDL-C. There was good tolerability, with low incidence of adverse experiences. This fact is important when one considers drug therapy for hypercholesterolemia in this age group.", 
    "58": "As a synthetic application of the chiral monoester 2, prepared by pig liver esterase (PLE)-catalyzed hydrolysis of the corresponding meso diester 1, conversion of 2 into various cyclohexenone derivatives was examined. This paper describes the preparation of the isomeric cyclohexenones 6 and 7, potential intermediates for the synthesis of anti-hypercholesmic compactin (ML 236B) and mevinolin, under stereo- and regioselective control.", 
    "59": "The bile-acid sequestrants, nicotinic acid and lovastatin, are the most effective drugs for lowering LDL-cholesterol. Nicotinic acid and gemfibrozil are more effective for lowering triglycerides and increasing HDL. Important considerations for proper selection of drugs in the treatment of the various dyslipoproteinemias are presented. Currently available drugs now permit effective control of blood lipid and lipoprotein levels.", 
    "60": "Hypercholesterolemia can be a risk factor which engenders coronary heart disease. Today, it seems certain that lowering the cholesterolemia reduces this risk, especially if this reduction is referred to the cholesterol which is linked to the low density lipoprotein, called LDL. It has been demonstrated that the principle way to remove the LDL is by getting it into the hepatocyte through a specific membrane receptor, the research, therefore, has been developed with the aim of pharmacologically modifying the quota of intercellular cholesterol and consequently, in the modulation of the receptivity function by the interference of the LDL uptake, assisting a faster clearance. We can identify a new class of pharmacological drugs, that are the specific inhibitors of the HMGCoA reductase, fundamental enzime in the biosynthesis of cholesterol. This group of inhibitors has recently been enriched by the addition of a new molecule pravastatin. Our task has been to confirm the effectiveness and tolerability of pravastatin, administered for a prolonged period to patients with high levels of cholesterolemia; we have compared it with gemfibrozil, a well-known medicine which has hypocholesterolemic effects. In conclusion, our work, whilst emphasising the expediency of ipolipidic treatment, has undoubtedly proved, that 40 mg of pravastatin in a single evening dose, shows a high degree of efficiency, without side effects. Due to these factors, we can also say that pravastatin prevents, or really induces the regression, of atheroscherotic disease.", 
    "61": "The effect of Pravastatin sodium (CS-514), a new inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA R) on very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) composition and kinetics was studied in normal and experimental nephrotic rats under fasting conditions. Nephrotic rats, induced by a single intraperitoneal injection of puromycin aminonucleoside (100 mg/kg body weight), had significantly higher plasma lipids and apoprotein (apo) B concentrations than controls. The hypertriglyceridemia associated with nephrosis was mainly due to a markedly elevated VLDL-triglyceride (TG) concentration. Pravastatin sodium was administrated as a 0.04% solution in drinking water for 7 days to normal control and nephrotic rats. Plasma TG concentration in both control and nephrotic rats was significantly reduced by the treatment with Pravastatin, but plasma cholesterol levels were not reduced by the treatment in either group of rats. TG, cholesterol, phospholipid, and apo B concentrations in nephrotic VLDL were significantly reduced by Pravastatin treatment, whereas only TG was decreased in control VLDL. Pravastatin reduced the apo B 100 + 95/48 ratio in nephrotic VLDL. Pravastatin did not alter the lipid concentration of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in control and nephrotic rats. VLDL-TG turnover studies showed that TG secretion rate was significantly suppressed by Pravastatin administration without affecting its removal in both groups of rats. These suggested that Pravastatin, an inhibitor of cholesterol biosynthesis, can reduce VLDL concentration by rectifying the overproduction of VLDL exhibited in nephrotic rats.", 
    "62": "In a large percentage of cases, diabetes mellitus leads to hyperlipidemia. In addition to the diabetes-related secondary hyperlipidemias, all types of primary disturbances of lipid metabolism can also be observed in diabetics. Depending upon the degree of severity and type of metabolic disorder presenting, not only suitable dietetic treatment, but also the various lipid-lowering drugs, fibrates, nicotinic acid, probucol, cholestyramine and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors should be introduced into therapy. As in all groups with an elevated coronary risk, strict management of the lipid levels is mandatory in diabetics, too.", 
    "63": "Simvastatin, a new 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl co-enzyme A reductase inhibitor, was compared to bezafibrate, a fibric acid derivative, in an open cross-over placebo-controlled study. Bezafibrate was administered as a 200 mg dose 3 times daily, while simvastatin dosage ranged from 10 mg to 40 mg once daily at night. Bezafibrate produced a non-significant 13.1% (P = 0.113) decrease in total cholesterol (TC), a 20.7% (P less than 0.05) decrease in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), an increase of 26.5% (P less than 0.01) in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and an improvement in the HDL:LDL ratio of 77.3% (P less than 0.01). Simvastatin 10 mg and 20 mg daily reduced TC by 18.6% and 22.6%, respectively, and LDL-C by 23.9% and 28.6% respectively (P less than 0.01), while no significant increase was noted in HDL-C. Simvastatin 40 mg daily reduced TC and LDL-C by 27.1% and 37.6%, respectively (P less than 0.01), increased HDL-C by 32.0% (P less than 0.05) and improved on the HDL:LDL ratio by 130.8% (P less than 0.01). This showed improvements over bezafibrate of 13.5% for TC, 18.9% for LDL-C, 6.0% for HDL-C and 55.8% for HDL:LDL ratio. It was concluded that simvastatin was well tolerated and had significant hypocholesterolaemic effects when taken once daily.", 
    "64": "The authors report the results obtained in a comparative study of effects of clofibrate and simvastatin. The investigation was carried out on 44 patients with type IIB hypercholesterolemia subdivided into two groups. Throughout the study, patients observed a diet of about 1500 Kcal daily. Thirty days before starting drug treatment, all patients were given a placebo daily, either of the two drugs being administered during the subsequent 30 days. Plasma cholesterol level was examined before starting placebo and before drug treatment and every five days throughout drug treatment. The results obtained showed that both drugs reduced cholesterol plasma level significantly but the reduction obtained with simvastatin was greater than that obtained with clofibrate. The specificity of the use of these drugs in the management of hypercholesterolemia is stressed.", 
    "65": "The effects of simvastatin, a competitive inhibitor of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, on plasma lipid levels were compared with those of the bile acid sequestrant cholestyramine in a randomized parallel study of 60 subjects with primary hypercholesterolaemia. After a 12-week direct comparison period 37 subjects with inadequate cholesterol reduction received a combination of both drugs and all subjects were followed for a further 40 weeks. Simvastatin was more effective than cholestyramine in lowering total and LDL cholesterol levels and the LDL/HDL ratio (-31.7% v. -19.7% [P less than 0.01], -41.0% v. -31.8% [P less than 0.05] and -46.7% v. -33.6% [P less than 0.01], respectively at Week 12). Only simvastatin significantly increased the HDL cholesterol concentration (+13.3% [P less than 0.01] v. +6.4%). Cholestyramine increased plasma triglyceride levels by 37.5% (P less than 0.01) whereas simvastatin caused a slight non-significant reduction. Combined therapy produced a further decrease in total and LDL cholesterol levels, and in the LDL/HDL ratio, which was sustained for the duration of the study. Simvastatin was better tolerated than cholestyramine (P less than 0.01), and combining the two drugs enhanced efficacy without increasing the frequency of side effects.", 
    "66": "The purpose of the present study was to determine whether feeding lovastatin or colestipol, or both, to laying hens would decrease the concentration of cholesterol in eggs. Forty-eight White Leghorn hens (69 wk of age) were allocated randomly to one of four groups. For 5 wk, the birds were fed: 1) a control diet; 2) diets supplemented with 35 mg of lovastatin per kg of feed; 3) 11.7 g of colestipol per kg of feed; or 4) both 35 mg of lovastatin and 11.7 g of colestipol per kg of feed. Drug feeding did not affect egg production or the concentration of cholesterol in the yolk, muscle, or liver. Lovastatin residue was found in liver samples from hens receiving lovastatin, but no lovastatin residue was found in the muscle, egg-white, or egg-yolk samples from hens on any treatment. These findings suggest that lovastatin or colestipol, or both, fed at relatively low amounts do not decrease the concentration of cholesterol in egg yolk and do not depress egg production.", 
    "67": "The mechanism of slow binding inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl- coenzyme A reductase by lovastatin, fluindostatin, and related compounds was studied. Several of these compounds, including lovastatin, were found to be slow binding, while other less potent inhibitors were not. From a comparison of kinetic parameters obtained by steady-state measurements and progress curve analysis, it was concluded that the slow binding inhibitors bind by a mechanism which is more accurately described by biphasic binding than by single-step binding. The overall association rates of the slow binding inhibitors range from 1 x 10(6) to 4 x 10(-7) M-1 s-1, and the dissociation rates are in the range of 10(-3) s-1. The structures of slow binding and reversible inhibitors were compared by using molecular modeling methods. From these comparisons, it was proposed that the slow binding and very potent inhibition of, for instance, lovastatin, is not simply a result of binding of a transition state or reaction intermediate analogue. The various lipophilic groups of the inhibitors that do not seem to be related to structural features of the substrate may also play a crucial role in determining the mechanism of binding of HMGR inhibitors.", 
    "68": "The 3-year efficacy of lovastatin alone or in combination with colestipol was evaluated in 54 patients with type 2 hyperlipoproteinemia (22 non-familial and 32 familial hypercholesterolemic patients). A sufficient and sustained reduction in LDL cholesterol was achieved in non-familial hypercholesterolemia with lovastatin alone (average dose 74 mg/day, range 40-80 mg/d), whereas combination therapy with lovastatin 80 mg/d and colestipol (average dose 11.9 g/d, range 5-20 g/d) was required in familial hypercholesterolemia. The percentage changes from baseline at 3 years in serum LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and total triglycerides were in the lovastatin-only group -53%, +10% and -15%, respectively, and in the two-drug group -58%, +22% and -18%, respectively. A subgroup analysis in patients with non-familial hypercholesterolemia indicated that the lipid-modifying effects of lovastatin were similar in type 2A and 2B phenotypes, except for a greater triglyceride lowering effect in type 2B. The lovastatin-alone regimen was well tolerated, whereas addition of colestipol caused subjective side effects in many patients. Serious side effects or discontinuations due to therapies did not occur. Both therapies caused slight but significant increases (within normal limits) in average serum transaminase levels. After 36 months a significant rise of 1.7 kg in mean body weight was observed in the lovastatin-only group. The ophthalmological follow-up did not reveal any cataractogenic effect attributable to treatment during the 3.8-year follow-up period.", 
    "69": "The effect of lovastatin therapy on LDL-receptor activity in fresh monocytes and on the structure and composition of lipoproteins was determined in 9 patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and 8 patients with non-familial hypercholesterolemia (NFH). Lovastatin reduced LDL-cholesterol levels by 34.8 and 47.5%, respectively, in the 2 groups of patients, and plasma apo B levels by 33.3 and 42.5%. LDL receptor activity in fresh monocytes increased by 53% and 86% respectively. HDL-cholesterol and plasma apo A-I levels increased only in the NFH group, by 10.2 and 7.1%. Lipoproteins were separated by centrifugation on a zonal rotor. Except for the intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL) fraction, no changes were observed in the structure and composition of the various lipoproteins. The investigations thus demonstrated that lovastatin therapy is associated with a measurable and significant increase of LDL-receptor activity in circulating monocytes that may contribute to the lipid lowering action of the drug.", 
    "70": "Cells in the quiescent, nonproliferative state express a protein, statin, in their nuclei. When the cells reenter the cell cycle, statin disappears and another protein, cyclin, appears. We have examined mouse astroglia at various stages of differentiation in cultures and astroglia in adult mouse brains for the presence of statin. In cultures initiated from the neopallium of newborn mice, the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)+ stellate astrocytes were statin-negative (statin-) but cyclin-positive (cyclin+). In the same cultures, large flat cells (senescent cells) were statin+ but cyclin-. In frozen sections of the brains of adult mice and in brain smears, GFAP+ astrocytes were statin-. Neither stellate astrocytes grown in cultures for 30 or more days nor astrocytes in adult mouse brain were labeled when pulsed with bromodeoxyuridine (BudR). When astroglia were treated with dibutyrl cyclic adenosine monophosphate (dBcAMP), large stellate cells that closely resemble reactive astrocytes in situ formed. These cells were all statin+ from 11-62 days in vitro; however, reactive astrocytes in mouse neopallium, 4-50 days after a stab wound, were statin-. In colony cultures, senescent cells became statin+, whereas stellate astrocytes and their precursor cells remained statin-. These observations indicate that normal astrocytes both in cultures and in situ retain the potential to divide and probably progress through the cell cycle at a very slow rate.", 
    "71": "The effects of Simvastatin (MK-733), an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase, on fecal and biliary excretion of sterols and bile acids were examined using rabbits. Multiple doses of MK-733 (10 mg/kg/day) for 7 days were found to increase fecal concentrations of neutral sterols in cholesterol-fed rabbits, but not to affect those of bile acids. Multiple doses of cholestyramine (750 mg/kg/day), a bile acid sequestrant, for 7 days increased fecal concentrations of neutral sterols and bile acids in normally fed and cholesterol-fed groups. MK-733 did not affect biliary neutral sterols and total bile acids in normally fed and cholesterol-fed groups. Cholestyramine decreased biliary concentrations of neutral sterols in both diet groups. Cholestyramine altered fecal and biliary composition of bile acids, but MK-733 did not. It was considered that MK-733 inhibited the absorption of cholesterol, resulting in an increase of the fecal concentration of neutral sterols in cholesterol-fed rabbits. The mechanism of action of MK-733 in the inhibition of cholesterol absorption is considered to be clearly different from that of cholestyramine. These results confirmed the conclusion in the previous experiment.", 
    "72": "We describe three patients with cholesteryl ester storage disease. Diagnosis was confirmed by demonstrating a deficiency in lysosomal acid cholesteryl hydrolase activity in cultured skin fibroblasts from each of these patients. All had hepatomegaly, elevated serum aminotransferase activities and hyperlipoproteinemia. Histological examination of liver biopsy specimens before treatment revealed accumulation of fat within hepatocytes, bile duct epithelium and endothelial and Kupffer cells. Cholesterol crystals were recognized by their birefringence in frozen sections. A striking feature was the presence of markedly hypertrophied Kupffer cells and portal macrophages with foamy, tan-colored cytoplasm that stained readily with the periodic acid-Schiff reagent and aldehyde fuchsin. Periportal fibrosis was noted in all cases; incomplete cirrhosis was present in one case. Distinctive and hitherto undescribed lysosomal accumulations of triglyceride and cholesterol crystals were noted. The patients were treated with lovastatin, a cholesterol-lowering agent, for at least 12 mo. No significant changes were seen in serum lipoprotein concentrations or liver histopathology after therapy. Thus lovastatin did not have an obviously beneficial effect on abnormal lipid metabolism in these patients.", 
    "73": "The mitogenic activity on rat aortic smooth muscle cells of plasma from patients with hypercholesterolaemia was compared to that of plasma from a normocholesterolaemic control group and to that obtained after lowering plasma cholesterol levels in the hypercholesterolaemic groups with simvastatin. Mean plasma total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein B concentrations in the two groups were 8.62 +/- 0.62 mmol l-1, 7.03 +/- 0.56 mmol l-1 and 1.96 +/- 0.14 g l-1, respectively, and 5.05 +/- 0.20 mmol l-1, 3.42 +/- 0.18 mmol l-1 and 0.80 +/- 0.04 g l-1, respectively, all differences significant at P less than 0.001. During simvastatin treatment these parameters decreased to 5.70 +/- 0.35, 4.15 +/- 0.33 mmol l-1 and 1.33 +/- 0.08 g l-1, all changes being significantly (P less than 0.001) lower than before treatment. Hyperlipidaemic plasma in untreated patients had a significantly lower mitogenic activity than normolipidaemic control plasma as measured by autoradiographic labelling of DNA after 3H-thymidine incorporation, 25.7 +/- 1.8% vs. 32.0 +/- 1.9%, P less than 0.05. Lowering plasma cholesterol levels in the hyperlipidaemic patients 'normalized' the mitogenic activity to 32.3 +/- 1.6%, P less than 0.05. The reason for this unexpected finding is not known.", 
    "74": "In 25 patients with primary dyslipoproteinemias and severe premature atherosclerosis, during an average combined Lopid-Mevacor treatment span of 12.5 months per patient, our specific aim was to assess safety and efficacy of open-label therapy with diet, gemfibrozil (Lopid), and lovastatin (Mevacor). Because targeted lipid values were not reached on diet alone (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDLC] less than 120 mg/dl, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDLC] greater than 35 mg/dl or total cholesterol [TC]/HDLC less than 4.5), the patients received Lopid, 1.2 gm/day as their initial lipid-lowering drug. Because targeted lipid levels were not reached with Lopid treatment alone after 3 or more months, Mevacor was added, with 17 subjects receiving 20 mg/day, five receiving 40 mg, two receiving 60 mg, and one receiving 80 mg. Outpatient visits were repeated during combined therapy every 6 to 8 weeks, with an average of 6.4 visits per subject, 162 measurements of fasting lipids and liver function tests, and 127 measurements of creatine phosphokinase (CPK). By selection, all patients had normal liver function (gamma-glutamyltransferase, serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) levels) and normal CPK levels at baseline. No gamma-glutamyltransferase levels were high during combined therapy. Of the 162 liver function test measurements, five (3.1%) SGOT levels and three (1.9%) SGPT levels were high. Of 127 CPK measurements, three (2.4%) were high; one subject had a high CPK measurement, and one subject had two high measurements for CPK. No symptomatic myositis or myalgias developed in the subjects; none had palpable skeletal muscle tenderness.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "75": "A protein inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase phosphatase activity from rat liver was purified to homogeneity. The protein was purified 4,000-fold with an overall yield of 4%. The purified protein had a molecular mass of 31 kDa. This spontaneously active protein is thermostable and acid-resistant. The protein inhibitor is phosphorylated by glycogen synthase kinase-3 and cAMP-dependent protein kinase without change in its inhibitory activity. The inhibition caused by this inhibitor on phosphatases 1 and 2A is similar to that of inhibitor-2 from rabbit skeletal muscle using hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase as substrate. The regulation properties of this inhibitor towards phosphatase 1 together with another protein inhibitor of phosphatase 2A in cholesterol metabolism are discussed.", 
    "76": "Several nuclear and surface proteins are expressed in varying amounts in the different phases of the cell cycle. For some of them the coding gene is not known and changes in their expression could simply be secondary to changes in the proliferative activity of the population. Other proteins are oncogene products, probably having a direct regulatory function in cell proliferation, differentiation and malignant transformation. Studying these proteins may both permit a better understanding of the mechanisms regulating proliferation and differentiation and provide kinetic parameters for describing the cell cycle. Based on antibodies against these proteins, bivariate flow cytometry (FCM) is able to quantitate their expression simultaneously with DNA distribution. This allows protein expression to be related precisely with each cell cycle phase in populations having different proliferative activity. Further advantages of bivariate FCM are that few cells are required for the analysis and the percentage of cells expressing the (onco) gene product can be determined. Several cellular proteins have been investigated with bivariate FCM, and the data are reviewed. Some proteins not coded by oncogenes (such as cyclin, the Ki-67 reactive antigen and DNA polymerase alpha) are expressed in cycling, but not in G0 cells and are of special interest for the kineticist, since they could identify cells which are able to initiate DNA synthesis, i.e. those representing the \"growth fraction\" of the population. Statin, on the contrary, is apparently expressed only in G0 cells. The expression of some proteins coded by oncogenes, such as p53 and the c-myc product is high in proliferating G1 cells and decreases with differentiation. The expression of the c-ras product is not strictly related to cell cycle phases and increases with differentiation. Technical improvements (allowing, for example, the monitoring of the changes in protein expression following the microinjection of a protein-blocking substance into the cells and the inclusion of phenotype markers into the analysis) will expand the role of bivariate FCM for these research works.", 
    "77": "Severe rhabdomyolysis complicated by respiratory and renal failure developed three weeks after initiation of low dose lovastatin therapy in a 79 year old, non-immunocompromised patient. The concomitant use of gemfibrozil may increase the risk of this complication.", 
    "78": "The effects of simvastatin, an inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis, on serum lipids, lipoprotein composition and apolipoproteins were evaluated in a total of 50 patients with hypercholesterolaemia. In the first study, 24 patients (mean serum cholesterol 10.74 +/- 1.59 mmol/l) were treated with simvastatin 40 mg daily for 24 wk. Serum cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol decreased to average values 29-36% and 35-42% below the basal value, respectively. Serum triglycerides decreased by 16-28%, and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol increased by 6-11%. Apolipoprotein A-I concentration increased 6-8% and that of apolipoprotein B decreased 29-33%. The composition of LDL remained unchanged whereas the very low density lipoproteins became enriched in triglycerides. Lipoprotein Lp(a) was not affected. In the second study 26 patients (mean serum cholesterol 12.35 +/- 2.05 mmol/l) were treated with simvastatin 40 mg daily as monotherapy or combined with a bile acid binding resin for 2 yr. Serum cholesterol levels decreased to values which remained stable throughout the entire study period; after 2 yr this decrease amounted to 43%. Compared to monotherapy, combination therapy yielded a further 12% decrease of cholesterol. In the entire group, triglycerides decreased by 16% and HDL cholesterol increased by 9%. Side effects were limited to slight increases in alanine aminotransferase and creatine phosphokinase in some patients. Simvastatin appears to be an important asset in the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia.", 
    "79": "7-Dehydrocholesterol (7DHC), an intermediate of cholesterol, accumulates in animals after administration of BM 15.766 and can be measured in addition to cholesterol photometrically. The effect of compounds acting at different points in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway on BM 15.766-induced 7DHC accumulation was investigated in rats to evaluate its usefulness as in vivo test system for cholesterol lowering agents. 7DHC in liver of rats proved to be an appropriate measure for cholesterol de novo synthesis. In contrast to previously described methods no radiolabelled precursors are necessary. The extraction of 7DHC and its photometric determination is, in comparison with separation and measurement of radioactive cholesterol, a simple analytical procedure.", 
    "80": "We investigated the metabolism of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), and low density lipoprotein (LDL) apolipoprotein B (apoB) in seven patients with combined hyperlipidemia (CHL), using 125I-labeled VLDL and 131I-labeled LDL and compartmental modeling, before and during lovastatin treatment. Lovastatin therapy significantly reduced plasma levels of LDL cholesterol (142 vs 93 mg/dl, P less than 0.0005) and apoB (1328 vs 797 micrograms/ml, P less than 0.001). Before treatment, CHL patients had high production rates (PR) of LDL apoB. Three-fourths of this LDL apoB flux was derived from sources other than circulating VLDL and was, therefore, defined as \"cold\" LDL apoB flux. Compared to baseline, treatment with lovastatin was associated with a significant reduction in the total rate of entry of apoB-containing lipoproteins into plasma in all seven CHL subjects (40.7 vs. 25.7 mg/kg.day, P less than 0.003). This reduction was associated with a fall in total LDL apoB PR and in \"cold\" LDL apoB PR in six out of seven CHL subjects. VLDL apoB PR fell in five out of seven CHL subjects. Treatment with lovastatin did not significantly alter VLDL apoB conversion to LDL apoB or LDL apoB fractional catabolic rate (FCR) in CHL patients. In three patients with familial hypercholesterolemia who were studied for comparison, lovastatin treatment increased LDL apoB FCR but did not consistently alter LDL apoB PR. We conclude that lovastatin lowers LDL cholesterol and apoB concentrations in CHL patients by reducing the rate of entry of apoB-containing lipoproteins into plasma, either as VLDL or as directly secreted LDL.", 
    "81": "The combined use of lovastatin, a hypolipidemic agent effective in the reduction of cholesterol levels, and the lipophilic immunosuppressant, cyclosporine, was studied in the obese rat model. Pharmacokinetics, immunosuppressive activity, lipid levels, and creatinine clearances were compared between groups administered drug-free vehicle, lovastatin or cyclosporine alone, or concomitant cyclosporine and lovastatin. All groups were pre-treated with either oral lovastatin 2.5 mg kg-1 day-1 or propylene glycol vehicle for 1 week. Although no differences in renal function were observed in rat groups administered cyclosporine or lovastatin alone, there was a significant reduction in baseline creatinine clearance following combination therapy compared to placebo controls (70 +/- 18 vs 121 +/- 16 per cent of baseline; p less than 0.05). No differences in trough cyclosporine concentrations were observed between groups. Similarly, mean areas under the whole blood concentration-time profiles were not significantly different with or without concomitant lovastatin (61823 +/- 27295 vs 41470 +/- 10312 ng h ml-1; p = 0.13). No differences in systemic clearance or volume of distribution of parent cyclosporine were observed with combination therapy. Furthermore, lipid levels and T-lymphocyte activity were unchanged with the addition of lovastatin. Per cent increases in creatine kinase were significantly correlated with percentage drop in baseline renal function, suggesting the development of rhabdomyolysis. The present data support the interaction between cyclosporine and lovastatin observed clinically, resulting in acute renal dysfunction. Caution should be exercised in their combined use.", 
    "82": "Recent pharmacological studies confirmed the role of hypercholesterolemia in the pathogenesis of coronary atherosclerosis. A 10% reduction in cholesterol levels can reduce the risk of coronary heart disease by 15%. However many hypercholesterolemic patients often suffer from arterial hypertension and drugs such as thiazide diuretics cause an imbalance in lipid metabolism. The efficacy and the tolerability of simvastatin (a inhibitor of HGM-CoA reductase) with that of gemfibrozil (a fibric acid derivative, which can reduce the VLDL level) were compared in a placebo-controlled study in 2 groups of patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and mild-to-moderate essential hypertension treated with hydrochlorothiazide. After 10 weeks standard hypolipidemic diet and hydrochlorothiazide (25 mg od) therapy, 30 patients whose cholesterol levels were still greater than or equal to 250 mg/100 ml and whose diastolic blood pressure was less than 95 mmHg were randomized to one of the following treatments: simvastatin, 20 mg od, gemfibrozil, 600 mg bid or placebo, while continuing dietetic and diuretic treatment. After 24 weeks treatment, simvastatin induced a 37% reduction in cholesterol plasma levels, a 9% increase of HDL and a 16% reduction of LDL. APO-A1 showed a 4% increase, while APO-B showed a 3% reduction. Gemfibrozil induced a 20% reduction in plasma triglycerides and a 13% decrease in plasma cholesterol, with a significant 19% increase in HDL and a 11% reduction in LDL. No significant variations in any of the lipid parameters monitored were observed in the placebo group. Treatment with simvastatin or gemfibrozil in hypertensive patients in hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy can reduce total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol plasma levels, while significantly increasing HDL plasma levels compared to placebo. Simvastatin, however, resulted more efficient than gemfibrozil on total cholesterol or cholesterol fractions.", 
    "83": "Oncogenic forms of ras proteins are synthesized in the cytosol and must become membrane associated to cause malignant transformation. Palmitic acid and an isoprenoid (farnesol) intermediate in cholesterol biosynthesis are attached to separate cysteine residues near the C termini of H-ras, N-ras, and Kirsten-ras (K-ras) exon 4A-encoded proteins. These lipid modifications have been suggested to promote or stabilize the association of ras proteins with membranes. Because preventing isoprenylation also prevents palmitoylation, examining the importance of isoprenylation alone has not been possible. However, the oncogenic human [Val12]K-ras 4B protein is not palmitoylated but is isoprenylated, membrane associated, and fully transforming. We therefore constructed mutant [Val12]K-ras 4B proteins that were not isoprenylated to examine the effects of isoprenylation in the absence of palmitoylation. The nonisoprenylated mutant proteins both failed to associate with membranes and did not transform NIH 3T3 cells. In addition, inhibition of isoprenoid and cholesterol synthesis with the drug compactin also decreased [Val12]K-ras 4B protein isoprenylation and membrane association. These results unequivocally demonstrate that isoprenylation, rather than palmitoylation, is essential for ras membrane binding and ras transforming activity. These findings clearly indicate the biological significance of ras protein modification by farnesol and suggest that this modification may be important for facilitating the processing, trafficking, and biological activity of other isoprenylated proteins. Because K-ras is the most frequently activated oncogene in a wide spectrum of human malignancies, study of this pathway could lead to important therapeutic treatments.", 
    "84": "The hypolipidemic effects of lovastatin and clofibrate have been evaluated in 12 patients with type III hyperlipoproteinemia. In these patients plasma concentrations of total cholesterol decreased from 500 +/- 56 mg/dL (mean +/- SEM) at baseline to 278 +/- 23 mg/dL on lovastatin (20 mg twice daily), and were 299 +/- 15 mg/dL during treatment with clofibrate (1 g twice daily). Nine patients were treated sequentially with lovastatin at doses of 20 and 40 mg twice daily and clofibrate; in these patients total plasma cholesterol concentrations decreased from 549 +/- 67 mg/dL at baseline to 291 +/- 24 mg/dL on lovastatin (20 mg twice daily), 247 +/- 20 mg/dL (40 mg twice daily) and were 297 +/- 18 mg/dL on monotherapy with clofibrate. Concentrations of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol were similar on clofibrate and the higher dose of lovastatin, whereas concentrations of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol were significantly lower on lovastatin. In six patients who remained hyperlipidemic on monotherapy with either drug, combination drug therapy with lovastatin (20 mg twice daily) plus clofibrate reduced plasma concentrations of total cholesterol from 635 +/- 79 mg/dL to 205 +/- 11 mg/dL. No patients were discontinued from single or combined drug therapy and no significant biochemical abnormalities were observed. The results of this study demonstrate the potential usefulness of lovastatin in the therapy of type III hyperlipoproteinemia and indicate that, in selected patients who remain hypercholesterolemic on monotherapy with either clofibrate or lovastatin, combination drug therapy with both of these drugs is effective in further reducing plasma concentrations of total, VLDL, and LDL cholesterol.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "85": "We have examined the influence of simvastatin, a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase on plasma concentrations of lipids and lipoproteins, the rates of cholesterol biosynthesis and degradation of 125I-labelled LDL by freshly isolated mononuclear leucocytes and the 24 h urinary excretion of mevalonic acid in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia. Patients were treated with progressively increasing doses of simvastatin (20, 40, and 80 mg day-1) taken in a twice-daily dosage for a period of 6 weeks on each dose. Plasma concentrations of LDL cholesterol decreased by 36.6%, 45.6% and 47.1% respectively on the three doses. High-affinity degradation of 125I-LDL by freshly isolated mononuclear leucocytes increased significantly on the 20 mg day-1 dosage but no further increase was observed on doses of 40 and 80 mg of simvastatin per day. Rates of 2-14C acetate incorporation into cholesterol by freshly isolated mononuclear leucocytes (obtained 12-15 h after the last dose of simvastatin) increased by 62%, 71% and 29% in cells isolated from patients on 20, 40, and 80 mg day-1 of simvastatin compared with values at baseline. In contrast, the 24 h excretion of mevalonic acid in the urine fell by 16.9%, 31.4% and 31.9% respectively on these three doses. Our results indicate that the potent hypocholesterolaemic effects of simvastatin are accompanied by increases in high-affinity LDL receptor-mediated degradation of LDL and a compensatory increase in cholesterol biosynthesis in freshly isolated mononuclear leucocytes but that rates of mevalonic acid excretion in the urine decrease.", 
    "86": "A new screening method for specific inhibitors of mevalonate biosynthesis was established using Vero cells, an animal cell line. The cultures selected were those which inhibited the growth of Vero cells in the EAGLE's minimum essential medium supplemented with 2% calf serum (2% CS-MEM) but lacked inhibitory activity against the growth of cells in 2% CS-MEM supplemented with 1 mM mevalonate. By this screening method, inhibitors of the two enzymes involved in mevalonate biosynthesis, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) synthase and HMG-CoA reductase, were selected from about 11,000 soil isolates. The beta-lactone 1233A, a fungal metabolite, was found to be the first naturally occurring compound which inhibits HMG-CoA synthase specifically and strongly. Monacolins K and J, inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, were also detected and identified.", 
    "87": "It has recently been reported that a precursor of p21ras (pro-p21ras) becomes modified by a metabolite of mevalonic acid prior to conversion to mature p21ras. We have examined the effect of blocking isoprenoid biosynthesis on this process. Fluoromevalonate, which inhibits the conversion of pyrophosphomevalonate to isopentenyl pyrophosphate, blocks the incorporation of radioactive mevalonate into pro-p21ras, demonstrating the mevalonate must be converted to an isoprenoid prior to such incorporation. Starvation of CHO-K1 cells for mevalonic acid by treatment with mevinolin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase, or mevalonate deprivation in a mevalonate auxotroph defective in HMG-CoA synthase activity results in the accumulation of pro-p21ras. The precursor, accumulated due to either of these treatments, is converted through an intermediate form to the mature p21ras by incubation of cells with mevalonate. Incubation of cells with 25-hydroxycholesterol, the pleiotropic transcriptional down-regulator of cholesterol biosynthesis does not, however, result in the accumulation of pro-p21ras. This result indicates that in contrast to the regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis in mammalian cells, important regulatory control other than at the level of HMG-CoA reductase is involved in the isoprenoid biosynthesis required for protein isoprenylation.", 
    "88": "New information on the tolerability of lovastatin has emerged from an ongoing study of long-term therapy; preliminary results from a large, 48-week clinical trial; and spontaneous reports of adverse events observed during prescription use of the drug in the United States. As of June 1989, 744 patients had received lovastatin for an average duration of 3.6 years in the long-term study. Drug-attributable adverse events necessitated withdrawal of 17 patients (2.3%) from the study. These adverse effects were asymptomatic elevations of transaminases (10), skin rash (3), gastrointestinal symptoms (2), myopathy (1) and insomnia (1). No effect of lovastatin on the human lens was observed. In the 48-week study, 8,245 patients were randomized into 5 equal groups to receive placebo or lovastatin 20 or 40 mg once or twice daily on a double-blind basis. Only 3 cases of myopathy were observed, all in patients taking lovastatin 40 mg twice daily. The incidence of withdrawal from the study because of raised transaminases was approximately 0.1% in the placebo group vs 0.1, 0.7, 0.6 and 1.5% in patients taking lovastatin in doses of 20 mg once daily, 40 mg once daily, 20 mg twice daily and 40 mg twice daily, respectively. Lovastatin has been available in the United States since September 1987. By June 1989, the drug had been prescribed for approximately 1 million patients. Drug-attributable adverse events not observed in clinical trials (such as hypersensitivity reactions and symptomatic hepatitis) have been reported, but the incidence of each appears to be extremely low.", 
    "89": "A variety of double-blind studies have compared the efficacy of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (lovastatin and simvastatin) with that of control agents (cholestyramine, fibrates and probucol) in patients with type IIA or IIB primary hypercholesterolemia. Results have shown that both lovastatin and simvastatin are more effective than the standard therapies with regard to reducing total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Decreases in triglycerides and increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were generally greater with fibrates. Ongoing studies are assessing the benefits of lovastatin and simvastatin in reducing the incidence of mortality from coronary artery disease, as well as causing regression of coronary atheroma.", 
    "90": "To assess the cost-effectiveness of cholesterol-reducing therapy with cholestyramine and simvastatin in the primary prevention of coronary artery disease in The Netherlands, a model of coronary artery disease incidence was used based on multivariate logistic risk functions from the Framingham study. For men with initial cholesterol levels of 8 mmol/liter, the cost per year of life saved of cholestyramine, expressed in Dutch guilders (NLG; 1 NLG = $0.50), ranges from approximately NLG 208,000 to NLG 483,000, depending on the patient's age at initiation of therapy. For simvastatin, cost-effectiveness ranges from NLG 46,000 to NLG 98,000 per year of life saved among this group of men. Similar differences between simvastatin and cholestyramine therapy prevail among women, although the costs per year of life saved for both agents are considerably higher. These results suggest that (1) simvastatin is substantially more cost effective than is cholestyramine; (2) simvastatin therapy compares favorably with other generally accepted medical practices, especially if treatment is initiated at an early age; and (3) as its long-term safety record becomes more established, simvastatin may become accepted as a drug of first choice in the treatment of persons with elevated serum cholesterol levels."
