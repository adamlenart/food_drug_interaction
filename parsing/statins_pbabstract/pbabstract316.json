Recent experimental and clinical evidence strongly suggests that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) have several physiological effects independent of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction. We here report that the carotid arterial blood flow after endothelial injury in hamsters treated with simvastatin was restored, in contrast to the situation in nontreated hamsters. Histologic observations showed a prompt recovery of endothelial cells with a much higher DNA synthesis index in repaired endothelium of hamsters treated with simvastatin. The amount of secreted vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) by cultured vascular smooth muscle cells from hamsters treated with simvastatin was significantly increased. Mevalonate reduced the amount of VEGF secretion by simvastatin in vitro. Finally, an injection of either an anti-VEGF antibody or an anti-VEGF receptor-1 (Flt-1) antibody, but not anti-VEGF receptor-2 (Flk-1), reduced the prompt endothelial healing. Simvastatin regulates endothelial regenerating by an over-release of VEGF and by this may result in prompt endothelial healing after vascular injury. Our results provide new insights into the role of statin and VEGF in the pathogenesis of vascular diseases.",

    "2": "The central event in the development of allograft vasculopathy is the inflammatory response to immune or nonimmune-mediated endothelial damage. This response is characterized by the release of inflammatory cytokines, upregulation of cell-surface adhesion molecules, and the subsequent binding of leukocytes. Once induced, vascular smooth muscle cells proliferate and migrate from the media to form a neointima. Circulating progenitor cells are recruited to sites of arterial injury where they may then differentiate into smooth muscle cells. Because of its diffuse nature, allograft vasculopathy is best detected by intravascular ultrasound. Noninvasive tests, such as dobutamine echocardiography, are gaining in favor. Although the only definitive treatment is retransplantation, the immunosuppressant rapamycin can limit disease progression. Its synthetic derivative, everolimus, effectively prevented intimal hyperplasia in de novo transplant recipients.",

    "4": "Secondary metabolites, or biochemical indicators of fungal development, are of intense interest to humankind due to their pharmaceutical and/or toxic properties. We present here a novel Aspergillus nuclear protein, LaeA, as a global regulator of secondary metabolism in this genus. Deletion of laeA (DeltalaeA) blocks the expression of metabolic gene clusters, including the sterigmatocystin (carcinogen), penicillin (antibiotic), and lovastatin (antihypercholesterolemic agent) gene clusters. Conversely, overexpression of laeA triggers increased penicillin and lovastatin gene transcription and subsequent product formation. laeA expression is negatively regulated by AflR, a sterigmatocystin Zn2Cys6 transcription factor, in a unique feedback loop, as well as by two signal transduction elements, protein kinase A and RasA. Although these last two proteins also negatively regulate sporulation, DeltalaeA strains show little difference in spore production compared to the wild type, indicating that the primary role of LaeA is to regulate metabolic gene clusters.",

    "9": "Preclinical and limited clinical data suggest that statins decrease the progressive decline in renal function that occurs in patients with renal disease. Pooled analysis of data obtained from a population of hyperlipidemic patients enrolled in the rosuvastatin (Crestor) clinical development program permitted assessment of its effects on renal function both early and later in the course of treatment. Study participants were initially included in controlled clinical trials that evaluated the lipid-lowering efficacy and safety of rosuvastatin when compared with placebo or other lipid-lowering agents (i.e., atorvastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, cholestyramine, fenofibrate or extended-release niacin). The median duration of treatment with the various doses of statins in these trials was approximately 8 weeks. Following completion of a controlled clinical trial, patients were permitted to enter an open-label extension trial and received rosuvastatin treatment. These data permitted assessment of renal function in a diverse group of over 10,000 patients who received rosuvastatin in its recommended dose range (5-40 mg) for up to 3.8 years. Mean serum creatinine concentrations were lower when compared with baseline both early and later in the course of rosuvastatin treatment. In contrast, no change in mean serum creatinine was observed with placebo. Mean glomerular filtration rates (GFR) predicted from the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation were higher when compared with baseline both early and later in the course of rosuvastatin treatment. No change in GFR was observed in the placebo group. Among patients who received long-term rosuvastatin treatment (> or =96 weeks), GFR was unchanged or tended to increase, rather than decrease, when compared with baseline irrespective of age, gender, hypertensive or diabetic status, level of renal function (GFR > or =60 vs. <60 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) at entry or urine dipstick protein status prior to or during the period of treatment. These findings suggest that rosuvastatin may arrest the progression of renal disease.", 
    "10": "Free oxygen radicals and insufficient antioxidant enzymes have been implicated in the pathogenesis of hypercholesterolemia (HC). Trace elements function as cofactors in antioxidant enzymes. Antioxidant system and trace elements were investigated in many different studies including HC, but these subjects have not been investigated as a whole in these patients. The aim of the present study was to investigate the antioxidative system and trace elements in hypercholesterolemic patients given fluvastatin therapy. We examined malondialdehyde (MDA), copper zinc-superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities together with copper (Cu), iron (Fe), and zinc (Zn) levels in erythrocytes of 35 patients with HC and 27 healthy control subjects. It was found that in patients with HC, erythrocyte MDA was significantly higher than those of controls and erythrocyte CuZn-SOD and GSH-Px activities were significantly lower in patients with HC. Erythrocyte iron levels were significantly higher than those of controls, and erythrocyte copper and zinc levels were significantly lower in patients with HC. Plasma lipid levels and the oxidative state were analyzed in statin-treatment groups given fluvastatin therapy before and after a 3-mo treatment period. In conclusion, we found that fluvastatin has significant antioxidant properties and these effects might be very important in managing dyslipidemia by improving endothelial function.",

We have now studied sickle transgenic mice to help define the biology of endothelial TF expression in sickle disease. Using immunostaining of tissue sections, we find that this is confined almost exclusively to the pulmonary veins. About 15% and 13% of these exhibit TF-positive endothelium in the wild-type normal mouse and the normal human hemoglobin (HbA)-expressing control transgenic mouse, respectively. The mild sickle mouse is indistinguishable from normal (approximately 14% positive), but TF expression is significantly elevated in the moderate and severe mouse models of sickle disease (approximately 29% and approximately 41% positive, respectively). Exposure of the mild sickle mouse to hypoxia for 3 hours, followed by reoxygenation, converted its TF expression phenotype to that of the severe sickle mouse (approximately 36% positive). Pretreatment with lovastatin eliminated excessive expression of TF in the posthypoxic mild sickle mouse (approximately 16% positive) and in the more severe mouse at ambient air (approximately 21% positive). In addition to identifying tissue expression of endothelial TF in the sickle lung, these studies implicate reperfusion injury physiology in its expression and suggest a rationale for use of statins in sickle disease.", 
    "20": "The main purpose of this work is to prepare self-microemulsifying drug delivery system (SMEDDS) for oral bioavailability enhancement of a poorly water soluble drug, simvastatin. Solubility of simvastatin was determined in various vehicles. SMEDDS is mixture of oils, surfactants, and cosurfactants, which are emulsified in aqueous media under conditions of gentle agitation and digestive motility that would be encountered in the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract. Pseudo-ternary phase diagrams were constructed to identify the efficient self-emulsification region and particle size distributions of the resultant microemulsions were determined using a laser diffraction sizer. Optimized formulations for in vitro dissolution and bioavailability assessment were Carpryol 90 (37%), Cremophor EL (28%), and Carbitol (28%). The release rate of simvastatin from SMEDDS was significantly higher than the conventional tablet. The prepared SMEDDS was compared with the conventional tablet (Zocor) by administering the prefilled hard capsules to fasted beagle dogs. The absorption of simvastatin acid from SMEDDS form resulted in about 1.5-fold increase in bioavailability compared with the conventional tablet. Our studies illustrated the potential use of SMEDDS for the delivery of hydrophobic compounds, such as simvastatin by the oral route.",

Dysfunctional uterine haemorrhage (DUH) includes scanty, excessive or irregular bleeding, the primary cause of which is yet to become clear. A total of 100 cases of DUH were studied by histological and histochemical evaluation of endomertium with an object to find out the pathophysiology of DUH. Twenty cases of the similar age group without DUH acted as control. Irregular excessive bleeding was found to be the highest in multiparous women in their 4th decade of life. The material from endometrium was studied by haematoxylin and eosin statin, alcian blue, periodic acid Schiff's reaction and alkaline phosphatase activity. Histological examination of the study group revealed normal endometrium in 66% of cases and abnormal in 34% cases while histochemical behaviour was normal in 54% cases and abnormal in 46% cases. Hormonal imbalance is the chief factor in the pathogenesis of DUH and this abnormal hormonal status can better be revealed by a combined study of histological and histochemical evaluation of endometrium.", 
    "22": "Decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels constitute a major risk factor for coronary heart disease; however, there are no therapies that substantially raise HDL cholesterol levels. Inhibition of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) has been proposed as a strategy to raise HDL cholesterol levels.",

All the subjects received placebo for four weeks and then received 120 mg of torcetrapib daily for the following four weeks.

Torcetrapib also reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels by 17 percent in the atorvastatin cohort (P=0.02). Finally, torcetrapib significantly altered the distribution of cholesterol among HDL and LDL subclasses, resulting in increases in the mean particle size of HDL and LDL in each cohort.",

    "26": "Isoprenoid biosynthesis in the widespread diatomaceous algae, Rhizosolenia setigera (Brightwell) and Haslea ostrearia (Simonsen), results not only in the production of diterpenoids, triterpenoids, and sterols but, unusually for diatoms, also in the production of sesterterpenoids. By using 13C and 2H isotopic labeling techniques followed by NMR and mass spectrometry, specific inhibition of mevalonate (MVA) and methylerythritol (MEP) pathways, and comparison with the natural 13C/12C isotope ratios of the lipids, the different biosynthetic pathways of the sesterterpenes and other isoprenoids have now been determined. Surprisingly, whereas the sesterterpenes (Delta(7(20))-haslenes) in R. setigera were made by the MVA pathway, as were the related triterpenoid rhizenes and desmosterol, in H. ostrearia the structurally similar Delta(6(17))-haslenes and the major sterol, 24-ethylcholest-5-en-3beta-ol, were instead biosynthesized by the MEP route. Phytol was biosynthesized in both diatoms by the MEP route. Subfractionation of R. setigera cells revealed that although phytol was located in the chloroplasts, the haslenes, rhizenes, and sterols were present in the cytoplasm. The observations described here for R. setigera and H. ostrearia show that terpenoid biosynthesis in diatoms is species-dependent and cannot simply be grouped according to structural type. Triterpenes appear to be made by the MVA route as in higher plants, whereas sesterterpenes and sterols can be made by either the MVA or MEP routes. In neither organism were the isoprenoids biosynthesized by leucine metabolism. Sesterterpene and triterpene biosynthesis in diatoms has not been investigated previously.", 
    "27": "Patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia have severe coronary-artery disease early in adult life. Whether lipid-lowering treatment should be started in childhood remains to be established. We therefore assessed 201 children heterozygous for familial hypercholesterolaemia and 80 unaffected siblings (both age ranges 8-18 years) with B-mode ultrasound to measure carotid wall intima-media thickness. Mean combined carotid intima-media thickness of heterozygotes was significantly greater than that of unaffected siblings (0.494 mm [SD 0.051] vs 0.472 [SD 0.049], p=0.002). A significant deviation in intima-media thickness was noted from age 12 years in children with familial hypercholesterolaemia. Findings on multivariate analysis showed LDL cholesterol, age, and sex to be strong and independent predictors of intima-media thickness. Since raised LDL cholesterol concentrations can be lowered efficiently, clinical studies are needed to investigate long-term safety and effectiveness of statin treatment in children with familial hypercholesterolaemia.",

    "29": "To look for new candidates for agents to use in maintenance therapy for myeloma patients, the growth inhibitory effects of a 3-hydroxy-3-mehtylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor (statin), simvastatin, was analyzed using human myeloma cell lines. Several investigations have indicated growth reduction in certain lineages of cancer cells including one report on myeloma, and inhibitory effects of statins on GTPases and involving MAP-kinases. Most (12 out of 13) myeloma lines examined showed growth inhibition when cultured with various concentrations (1-30 microM) of simvastatin in a dose-dependent manner. Simvastatin in combination with other biological response modifiers such as ATRA or DEX had additional effects on growth. In addition, anti-oxides prevented the simvastatin-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis. Furthermore, myeloma cells treated with simvastatin clearly showed inactivation of various MAP-kinase pathways such as ERK1/2, MEK1/2, JNK, and p38. Based on these findings, statins may be suitable for clinical usage in maintenance therapy for myeloma patients.", 
    "30": "A process is reported for efficient, enantioselective production of key intermediates for the common chiral side chain of statin-type cholesterol-lowering drugs such as Lipitor (atorvastatin) and Crestor (rosuvastatin). The process features a one-pot tandem aldol reaction catalyzed by a deoxyribose-5-phosphate aldolase (DERA) to form a 6-carbon intermediate with installation of two stereogenic centers from 2-carbon starting materials. An improvement of almost 400-fold in volumetric productivity relative to the published enzymatic reaction conditions has been achieved, resulting in a commercially attractive process that has been run on up to a 100-g scale in a single batch at a rate of 30.6 g/liter per h. Catalyst load has been improved by 10-fold as well, from 20 to 2.0 wt % DERA. These improvements were achieved by a combination of discovery from environmental DNA of DERAs with improved activity and reaction optimization to overcome substrate inhibition. The two stereogenic centers are set by DERA with enantiomeric excess at >99.9% and diastereomeric excess at 96.6%. In addition, down-stream chemical steps have been developed to convert the enzymatic product efficiently to versatile intermediates applicable to preparation of atorvastatin and rosuvastatin.",

    "32": "A 63-year-old white man with underlying insulin-dependent diabetes, recent coronary artery bypass surgery, and postoperative hemiplegia was treated with aspirin, metoprolol, furosemide, nitroglycerin, and simvastatin. Due to recurrent atrial fibrillation, oral anticoagulation with phenprocoumon and antiarrhythmic treatment with amiodarone were initiated. Four weeks after starting simvastatin 40 mg/day and 2 weeks after initiating amiodarone 1 g/day for 10 days, then 200 mg/day, he developed diffuse muscle pain with generalized muscular weakness. Laboratory investigations revealed a significant increase of creatine kinase (CK) peaking at 40 392 U/L. Due to a suspected drug interaction of simvastatin with amiodarone, both drugs were stopped. CK normalized over the following 8 days, and the patient made an uneventful recovery. An objective causality assessment revealed that the myopathy was probably related to simvastatin.", 
    "33": "Myopathy is a rare but potentially severe adverse reaction associated with statins. Besides high statin doses, concomitant use of fibrates, defined comorbidities, and concurrent use of inhibitors of cytochrome P450 are important additional risk factors. This is especially relevant if statins predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4 are combined with inhibitors of this isoenzyme. Amiodarone is a potent inhibitor of several different CYP isoenzymes, including CYP3A4.", 
    "34": "Avoiding the concomitant use of drugs with the potential to inhibit CYP-dependent metabolism (eg, amiodarone) or elimination of statins may decrease the risk of statin-associated myopathy. Alternatively, if drug therapy with a potent CYP inhibitor is inevitable, choosing a statin without relevant CYP metabolism (eg, pravastatin) should be considered.",

Patients with CAD (n = 760) and age- and sex-matched population-based controls (n = 691) were genotyped for the -786T/C, E/D298 and 4a/b polymorphisms. Patients were randomized to pravastatin (40 mg) or placebo. Progression of atherosclerosis was evaluated by sequential angiography. Functionality was assessed by ST segment analysis of ambulant ECGs. The E298 (P = 0.003) and 4a (P = 0.001) alleles were associated with CAD. Furthermore, E298 (P = 0.009) and -786T (P = 0.022) alleles were associated with previous MI among patients, predominantly smokers. D/D298 homozygotes, but not -786T/C or 4a/4b mutants, had longer-lasting ischaemia than others (P < 0.05). We found no differences in progression of atherosclerosis, irrespective of pravastatin use. We conclude that the E/D298 polymorphism is most consistently associated with CAD, but not with progression of atherosclerosis. The E allele is associated with CAD and MI, whereas the D allele is associated with ischaemia.", 
    "45": "Competitive inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase are commonly used in the clinic to treat hypercholesterolemia and have been reported to exert antitumor effects. Cerivastatin is a novel, synthetic and the most pharmacologically potent inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase. We decided to examine the cytostatic/cytotoxic activity of cerivastatin against human breast cancer cell lines and to test whether the effects of cerivastatin could be potentiated by doxorubicin and cisplatin. Cytostatic/cytotoxic effects of cerivastatin used alone or in the combination with chemotherapeutics were measured with MTT assay. The cell cycle distribution and apoptosis induction were evaluated with flow cytometer. The expression of p21 and p27 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors was measured with Western blotting. Isobologram analysis was performed to study the drug interactions. We observed that cerivastatin exerts cytostatic/cytotoxic effects against four human tumor cell lines (T-47D, T4-2, MDA-MB-231, MCF-7). We also demonstrated that cerivastatin exerts growth inhibitory effect through induction of p21 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor and inhibition of cell cycle progression. In the two tumor cell lines studied, one sensitive (MDA-MB-231) and one moderately resistant (T4-2) to the cytostatic/cytotoxic effects of cerivastatin we examined the effects of combined treatment with cerivastatin and either doxorubicin or cisplatin. Cerivastatin potentiated cytostatic/cytotoxic effects of cisplatin against T4-2 cells and those of doxorubicin against both cell lines. In T4-2 cells the interaction between doxorubicin and cerivastatin and between cisplatin and cerivastatin was found to be synergistic. Altogether, these studies indicate that cerivastatin is another HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor with potent antitumor effects.", 
    "46": "LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) is a key factor in primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. Statins have become a mainstay in the first-line treatment of hypercholestorelomia. Nevertheless, in clinical practice, there is a major gap between treatment guidelines and real life treatment patterns. It is not uncommon that statins lack sufficient efficacy in the most severe cases of dyslipidemia, even when the highest doses are used. Therapy combining statins with other cholesterol-lowering agents is often used, although it may be poorly tolerated. These limitations have directed research towards new mechanisms of action, additive to those of statins which inhibit the hepatic biosynthesis of cholesterol. Ezetimibe is the first once-daily potent and selective inhibitor of cholesterol absorption which has been shown to reduce the overall delivery to the liver, with a subsequent reduction of serum LDL-C. As monotherapy, mean decrease in LDL-C with ezetimibe was 19.1% versus placebo, whereas in addition to ongoing statin therapy, there was a 21.8% incremental reduction of LDL-C (p<0.001) and a 11.1% of triglycerides (p<0.001) with an increase of HDL-C of about 1.7% (p<0.05). Phase III factorial co-administration studies with various statins at increasing dosages have shown a mean supplementary decrease of LDL-C (-12.1 to -13.8%) and triglycerides (-7.4 to -10.5%) and raising HDL-C (+1.4 to 4.5%) (versus pooled statins). Co-administration of ezetimibe (10 mg once a day) with a statin permits a degree of LDL-C lowering similar to that achieved with the highest doses of statins. The efficacy of ezetimibe has also been demonstrated in familial homozygous hypercholesterolemia and sistosterolemia. In both monotherapy and combination studies, clinical and biological safety of ezetimibe was good.", 
    "47": "In a recent paper, we reported that pravastatin sodium (pravastatin), an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme. A reductase, decreases the concentrations of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol through an LDL receptor pathway in Japanese White (JW) rabbits, whereas this agent lowers high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in a manner correlated with a reduction of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol secretion from the liver. In the present study, we administered pravastatin to JW rabbits at 30 mg/kg for 14 days and examined further the mechanisms for the reduction of HDL cholesterol. A striking finding was that the 4-day administration of pravastatin at 30 mg/kg selectively decreased the concentration of HDL cholesterol. Since 4-day administration of pravastatin to JW rabbits did not change the concentrations of hepatic LDL receptor proteins, these receptors were not likely to be involved in the reduction of HDL cholesterol. Another important finding was that pravastatin suppressed VLDL cholesteryl ester (CE) secretion from the liver, but not that of other VLDL lipids and VLDL proteins, indicating that the CE-poor VLDL particles were secreted by the consecutive administration of pravastatin. There were, however, no differences in the levels of VLDL cholesterol between the control and pravastatin-treated groups over the experimental period of 14 days. These observations raised the possibility that the reduction of HDL cholesterol in the pravastatin-treated group was due to the transfer of CE molecules from HDL particles to these CE-poor VLDL particles. Molecular species analysis supported this notion that the VLDL-CE in the pravastatin-treated group was rich in cholesteryl linoleate, indicating that the CE in this group mainly originated from HDL, whereas the VLDL-CE in the control group was rich in cholesteryl oleate, indicating that the CE in this group originated from the liver. The present study suggests that pravastatin lowers HDL cholesterol by transferring CE from these lipoproteins to VLDL in JW rabbits.",

We examined the correlation between inflammatory and coagulatory reactions and the occurrence of restenosis, and how treatment with statins influences this correlation. A total of 243 patients with stable angina who were scheduled for a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and follow-up coronary angiography were enrolled in the study. Eighty-one of these patients were treated with statins for at least 1 month before their PCI and throughout the study period. Blood was withdrawn on the day of the PCI and on the day of the follow-up catheterization. Patients with the highest hs-CRP at the time of the initial PCI maintained elevated hs-CRP levels over time and showed significantly higher rates of restenosis or TLR after 6 +/- 1 months than subjects with low initial hs-CRP. Statin treatment abolished this difference. Fibrinogen levels were also increased in subjects with high initial hs-CRP, both at the time of the initial PCI and at follow-up. In an univariate analysis, both initial and follow-up levels of hs-CRP and fibrinogen correlated with restenosis. However, both the initial and follow-up levels of hs-CRP only were independent predictors of increased restenosis in a multivariate analysis, except in the statin-treated subgroup. In conclusions, the persistent increase in CRP is a risk factor for restenosis in patients with stable angina who have not been treated with statins.",

Patients were stratified in quartiles according to their CETP baseline levels. In addition to correlations with decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), increased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) and enhanced triglyceride levels, higher CETP levels were also associated with reduced HDL particle size, and smaller and denser LDL. Statins reduced plasma CETP levels and atherogenic lipoproteins. Nevertheless, baseline CETP concentration was positively associated with IMT after 2 years of therapy.", 
    "66": "This study provides evidence that CETP levels are associated with a more atherogenic lipid profile and increased progression of atherosclerosis. Statin treatment improved the lipoprotein profile in FH patients, but to a lesser extent in those with high CETP levels.

    "67": "Late-onset sporadic Alzheimer's disease is a heterogeneous disorder. In elderly patients, increasing evidence suggests a link between this neurodegenerative disease, and vascular risk factors and atherosclerosis. The nature of this link remains speculative. Some investigators have suggested that the disease arises as a secondary event related to atherosclerosis of extracranial or intracranial vessels. A toxic effect of vascular factors on the microvasculature of susceptible brain regions has also been argued. An alternative explanation is that atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease are independent but convergent disease processes. This hypothesis is lent support by observations of shared epidemiology, pathophysiological elements, and response to treatment in both disorders. It provides a potential framework for an improved understanding of the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, especially in elderly patients with vascular risk factors, and offers some promise toward the search for preventive and therapeutic treatments.",

A total of 216 patients with total cholesterol >/=200 mg/dl (>/=5.17 mmol/l) and triglycerides >/=200 and <800 mg/dl (>/=2.26 and <9.03 mmol/l) were randomised to one of two placebo groups, rosuvastatin 5 mg or rosuvastatin 10 mg for 6 weeks (fixed-dose phase). During the subsequent 18-week dose-titration phase, one placebo group received titrated rosuvastatin 10, 20 and 40 mg (placebo/rosuvastatin); one placebo group received titrated fenofibrate 67 mg once, twice and three times daily (placebo/fenofibrate); and patients receiving 5 or 10 mg rosuvastatin received titrated fenofibrate as above (rosuvastatin 5mg/fenofibrate and rosuvastatin 10 mg/fenofibrate groups). Doses were increased at 6-week intervals if low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol remained >50 mg/dl (>1.3 mmol/l). At 24 weeks, the placebo/rosuvastatin group and placebo per fenofibrate group had triglyceride reductions of 30.3% versus 33.6%, respectively (P = NS), and LDL cholesterol was reduced by 46.7% in the rosuvastatin group and increased by 0.7% in the fenofibrate group (P < 0.001). The triglyceride reduction in the rosuvastatin 10 mg/fenofibrate group (47.1%) was significantly greater than in the placebo/rosuvastatin group (P = 0.001), with no significant differences in other lipid measures found between these two groups. No significant differences in effect on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) were observed among treatment groups. In the fixed-dose phase, rosuvastatin 5 and 10 mg reduced triglycerides by 24.5 and 29.5%, respectively, and decreased LDL cholesterol by 40.7 and 45.8%, respectively. All treatments were well tolerated. These results indicated that rosuvastatin produces marked reductions in triglycerides and LDL cholesterol when used alone or in combination with fenofibrate in type 2 diabetes patients with elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels and may constitute a valuable treatment option in the diabetic population.",

However, treatment with bezafibrate only marginally affected sFasL (85 pg/ml, p < 0.05). Solubilized FasL was also diminished in patients with carotid atherosclerosis (39 pg/ml), and intensive treatment with atorvastatin normalized sFasL levels (90 pg/ml, p = 0.02).

Cyclosporine, sirolimus, and prednisone are mainly implicated, and the lipid profile differs between individual agents. In recognition that lipid alterations in these patients are linked with development of ischemic heart disease, vascular mortality, and graft deterioration, the National Kidney Foundation has recently released guidelines suggesting a low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol goal of < 100 mg/dL for these patients. Statins and diet therapy are recommended as first-line agents for achieving goal LDL cholesterol levels in this population. Recent evidence proved a reduction in adverse cardiovascular events when fluvastatin was utilized in one large-scale trial. Care should be taken with aggressive dosage adjustment because of the potential for a pharmacokinetic interaction with cyclosporine and a resultant increase in the risk of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis. Other options for improving the lipid profile include modifications in the immunosuppressive regimen, the addition of other lipid-modifying agents, and using alternative lipid-modifying agents.",

(1) Although mRNA levels of IL-1alpha and IL-1beta were markedly reduced in PBMCs from CAD patients after 6 months of simvastatin (20 mg/d, n=15) and atorvastatin (80 mg/d, n=15) therapy, the reduction in IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) was more modest. Statins also reduced the spontaneous release of IL-1beta and IL-1Ra from PBMCs in CAD patients. (2) mRNA levels of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-1Ra were increased in PBMCs from patients with stable (n=20) and unstable (n=20) angina compared with healthy control subjects (n=15). Although the unstable patients had particularly high levels of IL-1beta and IL-1alpha, IL-1Ra was not correspondingly increased.

    "97": "Statins are commonly prescribed drugs that inhibit hepatic cholesterol synthesis and thereby reduce serum cholesterol concentrations. Some of the statins are thought to possess bone anabolic properties. Effects of statin on tibia, femur, and vertebral cortical and cancellous bone were studied in ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Sixty Wistar female rats, 4 months old, were allocated into four groups: baseline control, sham + placebo group, OVX + placebo, OVX + simvastatin. Simvastatin, 20 mg/kg, or placebo was given twice daily by a gastric tube for 3 months. The rats were labeled with tetracycline at day 11 and calcein at day 4 before sacrifice. Concerning cortical bone, the tibial diaphysis bending strength was increased by 8% and the periosteal bone formation rate (BFR) at the mid-diaphysis increased by twofold in the OVX + simvastatin group compared with the OVX + placebo group, in harmony with increased serum osteocalcin concentrations. Simvastatin did not affect the endocortical bone formation. Concerning cancellous bone, the cancellous bone volumes in the proximal tibia and vertebral body were reduced in both OVX groups, but the reduction was less in the OVX + simvastatin group compared with the OVX + placebo group. This reduction in cancellous bone loss is in agreement with the 36% decreased activity of serum tartrate-resistant-acid-phosphatase 5b (TRAP-5b), indicating decreased osteoclast activity in the OVX + simvastatin group compared with the OVX + placebo group. In conclusion, simvastatin induces a moderate increase in cortical bone formation at the periosteal bone surface. The new cortical bone exhibits a normal lamellar structure, and simvastatin seems to respect the regional pattern of bone formation, bone resorption, and drift; for example, no periosteal bone formation is observed in the vertebral canal. Furthermore, simvastatin reduces the loss of cancellous bone induced by ovariectomy.",

Because atherosclerosis is a disease of the arterial wall, the ability of B-mode ultrasonography to provide visualization of IMT offers significant advantages over angiography. These advantages, as well as the safety and noninvasiveness of B-mode ultrasonography, have led to increasing use of this imaging technique in observational studies and interventional studies of lipid-lowering agents over the last decade. These observational studies clearly demonstrated an association between carotid IMT and atherosclerotic disease. Of the interventional studies, the recent Arterial Biology for the Investigation of the Treatment Effects of Reducing Cholesterol (ARBITER) trial found that use of atorvastatin 80 mg daily for aggressive lowering of plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations to below current target levels was associated with significant IMT regression compared with results obtained with less aggressive plasma LDL-C lowering. A new study-Measuring Effects on Intima Media Thickness: an Evaluation of Rosuvastatin (METEOR)-will examine the effects of aggressive lipid-lowering treatment with rosuvastatin 40 mg daily on IMT. The cohort in this study will be individuals with mild hypercholesterolemia whose standard risk assessment does not categorize them as at sufficient risk of clinical disease to warrant initiation of lipid-lowering therapy despite their relatively high IMT values.",

For example, the Heart Protection Study (HPS) found that statin treatment initiated at a baseline LDL-C plasma level of <100 mg/dL in patients at high risk provided a relative benefit in reducing the incidence of cardiovascular events that was similar to when it was initiated at higher LDL-C plasma levels. In addition, it is becoming clear that CHD risk, and the need for intensive lipid-lowering treatment, may be underestimated in some populations, including individuals with the metabolic syndrome. In the overall primary prevention population, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein measurement has been shown to identify individuals at high risk of cardiovascular events who would not be considered at high risk on the basis of current systems of risk assessment. The increasing focus on intensive plasma lipid lowering to reduce CHD risk has placed a premium on the development of therapies with improved ability to reduce plasma levels of LDL-C.", 
    "104": "Inflammatory processes play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and mediate many of the stages of atheroma development from initial leukocyte recruitment to eventual rupture of the unstable atherosclerotic plaque. C-reactive protein (CRP), an acute phase reactant that reflects different degree of inflammation, has been indicated an independent risk factor in a variety of cardiovascular disease (CVD), especially in unstable coronary syndrome. Our data have showed that increased level of CRP in patients with unstable angina was associated with short-term clinical outcomes, response for conventional therapy, and activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB), but it is not correlated to coronary artery stenosis as well as lipid profile. Traditionally, CRP has been thought of as a bystander marker of vascular inflammation, without playing a direct role in the CVD. More recently, accumulating evidence suggest that CRP may have direct proinflammatory effects, which is associated with all stages of atherosclerosis. In our recent study, the results demonstrate that monocytes exhibit an enhanced production of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in response to CRP, and this response is significantly inhibited by simvastatin in a dose-dependent manner. This may be of important interest in the connection between CVD and CRP. Based on those evidence, we hypothesis that CRP is not only an inflammatory marker but also a direct cause of CVD, and treatments that reduce CRP should be benefit for primary and secondary prevention of CVD. Administration of several agents, especially statin has been showed to modify CRP concentrations with a concurrent fall in cardiovascular events. Our clinical investigation suggested that treatment with a single high-dose or a short-term common dose of simvastatin could rapidly reduce CRP level. Those data indicated that the benefit to the vascular endothelium might occur quickly in patients with CVD, which is critical issue for high-risk subgroup. Other interventions, such as lifestyle changes, weight loss, and stop smoking are also warrant attention.",

Of subjects with cardiovascular disease (CVD) or diabetes taking statins 61% of men and 40% of women achieved total serum cholesterol levels < or =5 mmol L(-1). The odds ratio for taking a statin was increased amongst subjects who also took antihypertensive drug(s) or acetylsalicylic acid, subjects with a family history of coronary heart disease (CHD) and women who had visited the general practitioner within the last year. Amongst presumed healthy subjects use of statins increased from about 1% in women aged 40-45 years, to 7% at age 60 and to 12% at age 75 whilst the corresponding figures for men were 3%, 8% and 9%, respectively. About 22% of men but <2% of women aged 60 who were not taking statins had a 10-year Framingham CHD risk score >20%. Determinants of statin use were similar to those amongst subjects with CVD or diabetes.",

    "109": "Rosuvastatin (Crestor), an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin), has a favorable pharmacologic profile, including its selective uptake by hepatic cells, hydrophilic nature, and lack of metabolism by cytochrome p450 (CYP) 3A4 isoenzyme. This last property means that the potential for CYP3A4-mediated drug interactions and, as a consequence, adverse events is low in those requiring concomitant therapy with a statin and agents metabolized by CYP3A4. In a broad spectrum of adult patients with dyslipidemias, oral rosuvastatin 5-40 mg once daily effectively and rapidly improved lipid profiles in several large, randomized, mainly double-blind, multicenter trials of up to 52 weeks' duration. After 12 weeks' treatment, rosuvastatin was significantly (all p < 0.05) more effective at milligram equivalent dosages than atorvastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin in improving the overall lipid profiles of patients with hypercholesterolemia (intent-to-treat analyses). Moreover, overall a significantly (all p < 0.001) higher proportion of patients achieved National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) goals with rosuvastatin 10 mg/day than with therapeutic starting dosages of these other statins after 12 weeks' treatment in pooled analyses. Rosuvastatin treatment for up to 52 weeks was generally well tolerated in patients with dyslipidemias in clinical trials. The most commonly reported treatment-related adverse events were myalgia, constipation, asthenia, abdominal pain, and nausea; these were mostly transient and mild. The incidence of proteinuria or microscopic hematuria with rosuvastatin 10 or 20 mg/day was <1% versus <1.5% with rosuvastatin 40 mg/day; these events were mostly transient and not associated with acute or progressive deterioration in renal function at recommended dosages. Importantly, very few patients experienced elevations in serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels of over [corrected] 10-fold the upper limit of normal (0.2-0.4% of patients) or treatment-related myopathy (<or=0.1%) [i.e. muscle aches or weakness plus the same elevated serum CPK levels] at dosages of 5-40 mg/day. In conclusion, rosuvastatin treatment effectively and rapidly improves the lipid profile in patients with a broad spectrum of dyslipidemias. In those with hypercholesterolemia (including high-risk patients), rosuvastatin was more efficacious than and generally as well tolerated as atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin, with significantly more rosuvastatin recipients achieving their NCEP ATP III target LDL-C levels. Thus, rosuvastatin has emerged as a valuable choice for first-line treatment in the management of low- to high-risk patients requiring lipid-lowering drug therapy.", 
    "110": "Proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) stimulated by oxidative stresses and reactive oxygen species (ROS) may play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Antiatherosclerotic effects of angiotensin II receptor blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, HMG CoA reductase inhibitors, calcium channel blocker and epalrestat were studied with an in vitro guinea-pig basilar artery smooth muscle cell (GBa-SM3) culture system over 3 days incubated with 0 to 10% of fetal bovine serum. Results demonstrated that simvastatin (0.1 mM), fluvastatin (0.3 mM), amlodipine (0.2 mM) and epalrestat (1 mM) elicited significant (p < 0.05 or 0.01) antiproliferative effects, whereas losartan (1 mM), valsartan (1 mM), enalapril (0.1 mM), captopril (1 mM), trandolapril (0.01 mM), pravastatin (0.7 mM) did not. In conclusion, the present in vitro VSMC culture system may serve as a comprehensive screening method for pleiotropic effects of commonly used therapeutic agents.", 
    "111": "This study sought to induce the effect of nitric oxide (NO) production in vascular endothelial cells by Pitavastatin, which is a novel HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin). The growth capacity of vascular endothelial cells significantly (p < 0.01) declined when stimulated with TNF-alpha (10 ng/ml). The growth capacity of the TNF-alpha treated cells recovered, when the TNF-alpha stimulation was performed after Pitavastatin (100 nM) pretreatment. The recovery of the growth capacity of the cells was suppressed by the presence of the NO synthase inhibitor, L-NAME. Pitavastatin increased NO production by the vascular endothelial cells in a dose and time dependent manner. The NO production was suppressed by the presence of mevalonic acid and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. In addition, the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase was strongly induced by Pitavastatin, and was suppressed by mevalonic acid and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate by Western blot analysis. Our results show that Pitavastatin induces NO production by vascular endothelial cells, and protects vascular endothelial cells from injury due to the inflammatory reaction induced by TNF-alpha.",

A multicompartmental model was formulated and fitted to the data by standard nonlinear regression using the Simulation, Analysis and Modeling (SAAM II) program. Smaller sized LDL particles (251 to 257 A) demonstrated a significantly slower fractional catabolic rate (FCR) (0.050 +/- 0.045 h(-1)) compared with particles of larger size (262 to 265 A) (0.134 +/- -0.015 h(-1), P <.03), and there was a significant correlation between FCR and the peak LDL diameter of the injected fractions (R(2) =.71, P <.034). The sum of the equilibration parameters, k(2,1) and k(1,2), for smaller LDL (0.255 h(-1) and 0.105 h(-1), respectively) was significantly smaller than that for larger LDL (0.277 h(-1) and 0.248 h(-1), respectively; P <.01), indicative of slower intravascular-extravascular exchange for smaller LDL. Therefore in this mouse model, smaller LDL particles are cleared more slowly from plasma than larger LDL and are exchanged more slowly with the extravascular space. This might be due to compositional or structural features of smaller LDL that lead to retarded clearance.", 
    "119": "Insulin resistance (IR) impairs vascular responses in coronary arteries, but mechanisms of dysfunction and approaches to treatment remain unclear. We examined the ability of a new 3-hydroxy-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, rosuvastatin, to reverse reduced dilator responses in rats made IR by feeding a fructose-rich diet (FF). Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to control (normal rat diet) or FF. After 1 wk, rats received rosuvastatin (2 mg/kg) or placebo (saline) subcutaneously for 5 wk. Biochemical measurements and in vitro functional studies of small coronary arteries were performed. Fasting insulin and triglyceride (TG) levels were markedly increased in FF-placebo rats compared with other groups. Rosuvastatin treatment of FF rats normalized TG and modestly decreased insulin levels. ACh-induced dilator responses were depressed in arteries from FF-placebo rats. This impairment was due to decreased responses via calcium-dependent K channels (K(Ca)). Rosuvastatin treatment of FF rats completely reversed the response to ACh to normal levels. Moreover, this recovery in function was due to an improvement in vasodilation via K(Ca). Thus rosuvastatin treatment of IR rats normalizes coronary vascular dilator responses by improving the K(Ca) function.",

    "124": "Simvastatin and pravastatin are inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase, and are used as antihypercholesterolemia drugs. Simvastatin, but not pravastatin, binds to the inserted domain of leukocyte function antigen (LFA)-1 and inhibits the function of LFA-1, including adhesion and costimulation of lymphocytes. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) express high levels of LFA-1 on their surface and grow in tight clumps. Here we show that simvastatin (2 microM) inhibits clump formation and induces apoptosis of EBV-transformed LCLs. The apoptosis-inducing effect of simvastatin depends on binding to the inserted domain of LFA-1. Simvastatin, but not pravastatin, dissociates EBV latent membrane protein 1 from lipid rafts of LCLs, resulting in down-regulation of nuclear factor kappaB activity and induction of apoptosis. Analysis of multiple EBV-positive and -negative cell lines indicated that both LFA-1 and EBV latent membrane protein 1 expression were required for simvastatin's effects. Administration of simvastatin to severe combined immunodeficiency mice followed by inoculation with LCLs resulted in delayed development of EBV lymphomas and prolonged survival of animals. To our knowledge, this is the first report in which a drug that targets LFA-1 has been used to treat B cell lymphoma. These data suggest that simvastatin may have promise for treatment or prevention of EBV-associated lymphomas that occur in immunocompromised persons.", 
    "125": "Dyslipoproteinemia is the common part of metabolic syndrome, it appears probably due tu high level of free fatty acids. The typical lipid disorders are: high trigylcerides concentration, low HDL-cholesterol level, elevation of small dense LDLs particles and elevation of apolipoprotein B100 and non-HDL cholesterol. LDL-cholesterol concentration is usually normal. This type of dyslipoproteinemia is very aterogenic. Weight reduction, diet and regular physical activity is the most effective way how to treat this type of dyslipoproteinemia. When non-pharmacologic treatment is not successful, treatment with hypolipidemic drugs is necessary to prevent atherosclerotic complications. Fibrates are recommended in typical dyslipidemia to lower high triglycerides level and to elevated low HDL-cholesterol concentration. But when high LDL-cholesterol is present, statins are needed. In some patients with combined hyperlipidemia treating with fibrate and statin together is needed to reach target lipid levels.",

Gynaecologic cancer-related mortality statistics for the entire island for 1999 were compiled from data obtained from the Registrar General's Department (RGD) and the Statistical Institute of Jamaica (STATIN). Data were compared to gynaecologic cancer statistics for women from the United States of America for 1973-1997. A total of 2862 gynaecologic cancers were registered for the years 1973-1997, which represents 26.8% of all female cancers from Kingston and St Andrew. Cervical cancer accounted for 62% of these gynaecologic cancers. The 268 cancer-related deaths (168 due to cervical cancer) registered in Jamaican women for 1999 represent approximately 15% of all female cancer-related deaths. The present incidence (27.9 per 100,000) and mortality rate (15.8 per 100,000) of cervical cancer are much higher than that documented for American women--both African Americans and Caucasians--and signify the limited success, to date, of efforts to decrease the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer by the implementation of cervical cancer screening programmes.

LDL-C change from baseline showed a linear dose response (p < 0.0001 for slope of regression line) over the rosuvastatin dose range, with each doubling of dose producing an additional 5.12% reduction. Mean reductions (least-squares mean percentage change from baseline from ANOVA) in LDL-C were 35.8% to 66.0% and significantly different from placebo at all doses (p < 0.0001). Linear dose response was also observed for total cholesterol (TC) and apolipoprotein (apo) B, but not for triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), or apo A-I or A-II.

Rosuvastatin was well tolerated. Although there was some suggestion of increased frequency of treatment-related adverse events at higher doses, there were no clear dose relationships in safety parameters. Only one patient withdrew from the study because of a treatment-related adverse event. No patients had clinically significant elevations in liver transaminases or creatine kinase.

This new statin is indicated for the treatment of primary hypercholesterolaemia or combined dyslipidaemia, when changes in dietary habits are insufficient. Direct comparative randomised clinical trials with other statins demonstrated that rosuvastatin exerts a more favourable impact on lipid profile. When compared on a mg basis to other statins, rosuvastatin is associated with a greater reduction in total and LDL cholesterol levels and a greater increase of HDL cholesterol concentration, with a similar decrease in triglyceride levels. At the usual dosage of 10 mg, rosuvastatin allowed to reduce LDL cholesterol below recommended target levels for at risk patients among almost 80% of treated individuals in phase III clinical trials. If necessary, the daily dosage may be increased to 20 mg, or up to 40 mg (maximal dose), mostly in case of severe familial hypercholesterolaemia. Safety profile is good and similar to that of other commercialised statins.

Inhibition results in reduced levels of mevalonic acid in the body, leading to pleiotropic effects. Various fungi have been used for the commercial production of compactin. Using different strategies for improving production levels, yields have been increased to around 900 times of the amount originally produced.

The effects of a short-term treatment with atorvastatin (ATO) on ischemic ARF in old rats, characterized by a great susceptibility to ischemia, was tested. No difference was found in renal dynamics between young (Y, 3 mo old) and old (O, 18 mo old) rats in normal conditions (CON) or after ATO treatment (12 mg/kg/d for 14 d). Twenty-four hours after clamping of both renal arteries, a more pronounced decrease in GFR was observed in O rats versus Y rats after a greater renal vasoconstriction and hypoperfusion of aging animals. Pretreatment with ATO mitigated renal vasoconstriction in O rats and restored GFR values to Y rats. Nitrate excretion was enhanced in Y rats after ARF but was not further modified by ATO; in O rats, ARF did not increase nitrate excretion, which was raised after ATO treatment. This reflected the increase in endothelial NO synthase (eNOS)-mRNA expression and eNOS protein observed in old ATO-treated animals with ARF. ATO treatment had also a significant protective effect against the cell injury at tubular level in O, but not Y, rats. The Ras system was not influenced by ATO in O rats, whereas the activation of Rho proteins was partially inhibited by ATO. Low-dose treatment with ATO enhances NO availability in aging rats, improving renal dynamics and conferring a peculiar histologic protection at tubular level after ischemia.",

The aim of this study was to investigate a possible effect of cerivastatin on endothelial Ca(2+)-activated K+ channels (BK(Ca)) and to assess their contribution to cerivastatin-mediated changes of endothelial nitric oxide (NO) production and proliferation. Membrane potential was measured using bis-1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid-trimethine oxonol-fluorescence imaging. Patch-clamp recordings of BK(Ca) were performed on cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells. NO production was measured using 4,5-diaminofluorescein-fluorescence imaging and a [(3)H]cGMP RIA. Proliferation was analyzed by means of cell counts and [(3)H]thymidine incorporation (TI). Cerivastatin (0.001 to 0.05 micromol/L) caused a significant membrane hyperpolarization (n = 30; P < 0.05). This effect was abolished using the BK(Ca) inhibitor iberiotoxin (IBX; 100 nmol/L). The addition of mevalonate (500 micromol/L) blocked the BK(Ca) activation induced by cerivastatin (n = 19; P < 0.05). Endothelial cGMP level was increased by acetylcholine (ACh; 1 micromol/L). The combination of ACh and cerivastatin additionally increased cGMP levels, with a maximum at 0.03 micromol/L cerivastatin (84%; n = 10, P < 0.01). ACh-induced increase of cGMP-level was significantly reduced by IBX (n = 10, P < 0.01) as it was with all combined administrations of ACh and cerivastatin. 4,5-Diaminofluorescein-fluorescence measurements revealed a significant increase of NO levels by cerivastatin, which was abolished by IBX (n = 30; P < 0.05). Cell counts and TI demonstrated significant inhibition of human umbilical vein endothelial cell proliferation with a maximum at 0.03 micro mol/L (cell count, -32.2%; TI, -70%; n = 12; P < 0.01). These data show that cerivastatin activates endothelial BK(Ca), which plays an important role in the signaling of cerivastatin-mediated endothelial NO production and proliferation.", 
    "139": "CD30, a lymphoid activation marker, is shed into the cell environment after endoproteolytic cleavage of its ectodomain. Soluble (s)CD30 is able to suppress the Th1-type immune response. Because high serum levels of sCD30 and cholesterol-lowering drugs seem to be beneficial in some Th1-type autoimmune diseases, we focused on a link between CD30 shedding and the amount of cellular cholesterol. Cholesterol depletion of human Hodgkin lymphoma- and non-Hodgkin lymphoma-derived cell lines by methyl-beta-cyclodextrin led to a down-regulation of membrane-bound CD30 and increased release of sCD30. Additionally, the cholesterol-interfering drugs lovastatin, cholesterol oxidase, and filipin increased CD30 shedding. Both the down-regulation of membrane-anchored CD30 and the release of sCD30 were dependent on metalloproteinases. Using specific inhibitors, we detected TNF-alpha converting enzyme (TACE) as the leading enzyme responsible for cholesterol-dependent CD30 shedding. A Triton X-100-based method for lipid raft isolation revealed that CD30 was partially present in lipid rafts, whereas TACE was localized in the nonraft fractions. Disintegration of lipid rafts by cholesterol depletion might therefore lead to dynamic interactions of CD30 with TACE, resulting in enhanced shedding of CD30. Our results suggest a possible role of cholesterol-dependent shedding of CD30 in the pathogenesis of immune diseases.", 
    "140": "The ATP-binding-cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) plays an essential role in cellular cholesterol efflux and helps prevent macrophages from becoming foam cells. The statins are widely used as cholesterol-lowering agents and have other anti-atherogenic actions. We tested the effects of four different statins (fluvastatin, atorvastatin, simvastatin, and lovastatin) on ABCA1 expression in macrophages in vitro. The statins suppressed ABCA1 mRNA expression in RAW246.7 and THP-1 macrophage cell lines and in mouse peritoneal macrophages. The effect was time- and dose-dependent and was abolished by the addition of the post-reductase product, mevalonate. These findings imply that there is a possible modulation of the well-known beneficial effects of the statins on the reverse cholesterol transport pathway.", 
    "141": "Several intervention studies have shown that some hypolipidemic and hypotensive drugs such as fibrates, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and calcium (Ca)-antagonists prevent atherosclerosis. The main pathological findings in atherosclerosis include abnormal reactions of neutrophils, lymphocytes and monocytes/ macrophages, vascular smooth muscle cells and vascular endothelial cells, and the accumulation of cholesterol ester in the arterial wall. Therefore, investigating the effects of these drugs on the arterial wall may improve understanding of the mechanisms underlying atherosclerosis. Here, based on recent studies including our own, we describe the relationships between risk factors for atherosclerosis, especially hyperlipidemia and hypertension, and the molecular mechanisms that govern lipid metabolism in the arteries.", 
    "142": "Statins are possibly the most effective drugs for the prevention and treatment of hypercholesterolaemia and coronary heart disease. They are generally well tolerated, however, they do cause some unusual side-effects with potentially severe consequences, most prominently myopathy or rhabdomyolysis and polyneuropathy. We noted that the pattern of side-effects associated with statins resembles the pathology of selenium deficiency, and postulated that the mechanism lay in a well established, but often overlooked, biochemical pathway--the isopentenylation of selenocysteine-tRNA([Ser]Sec). A negative effect of statins on selenoprotein synthesis does seem to explain many of the enigmatic effects and side-effects of statins, in particular, statin-induced myopathy.", 
    "143": "The mechanism of lovastatin-induced cell death was examined in three established human glioblastoma cell lines; U87, U251, and U138. Changes in potential modifiers of apoptosis, including Bcl-2 family proteins and MAP kinase targets after such lovastatin treatment, were evaluated. Lovastatin (5 microm) treatment causes extensive cell death in two of the cell lines, U87 and U251; but only minimal in a third, U138. Lovastatin-induced death occurs in correlation with significantly increased levels of the BH3-only protein, Bim. The up-regulation of Bim levels was directly associated with an increased incidence of apoptosis. Lovastatin treatment in U87 cells results in activation of targets of three major mitogen-activating protein kinase cascades including Erk1/2, JNK and p38. Changes in levels of Bim, as well as increase phosphorylation of Erk1/2, c-jun, and p38 are all prevented by co-incubation of lovastatin and the isoprenylation metabolite, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. Inhibition of the MAP kinase pathways failed to block the increased expression of Bim expression or cell death. Further elucidation of the mechanisms of lovastatin-induced up-regulation of Bim and apoptosis in glioblastoma cells are important in determining a potential role for lovastatin as a chemotherapy agent.", 
    "144": "To determine whether neurite outgrowth depends upon the mevalonate pathway, we blocked mevalonate synthesis in nerve growth factor-treated PC12 cells or primary cortical neurones with atorvastatin, a 3-hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, and substituted different intermediates of the mevalonate pathway. We show that HMG-CoA reductase inhibition causes a profound reduction of neurite length, neurite loss and ultimatively cell death in undifferentiated and pre-differentiated PC12 cells and also in rat primary cortical neurones. Geranylgeranylpyrophosphate, but not farnesylpyrophosphate, squalene or cholesterol, completely compensated for the lack of mevalonate. Our data indicate that, under HMG-CoA reductase inhibition, geranylgeranylpyrophosphate rather than farnesylpyrophosphate or cholesterol is critical for neurite outgrowth and/or maintenance. Loss of neurites is an early manifestation of various neurodegenerative disorders, and dysfunction of isoprenylation might play a role in their pathogenesis.", 
    "145": "Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia affects one in every 500 persons and is the most common cause of markedly elevated cholesterol levels in children. Some male patients experience their first coronary event before the age of 30 years. Although dietary measures prevent atherosclerosis in adult populations, the effect of diet on children's lipid levels is limited and compliance is difficult. Trials lasting up to 2 years have shown that statins effectively lower low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels and in one study, restored endothelial dysfunction in children with no clinical adverse effects. To fully assess the effect of drugs on growth and development, especially in prepubertal children, longer trials are required. Gender, family history and LDL-cholesterol level can be used to stratify risk of coronary heart disease. Children that carry very high risk may benefit from starting statins after puberty.", 
    "146": "Monumental evidence from clinical trials indicates an approximately 30% reduction in atheroslcerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk using monotherapy with lipid-regulating drugs in dyslipidemic patients. In order to achieve greater reductions in risk, other approaches are necessary, including improvements in technology designed to assess ASCVD risk. Recent preliminary, but encouraging evidence indicates that by combining drugs that have different mechanisms of action on lipid metabolism yields not only an additive effect on the lipoprotein spectrum, but also reduces ASCVD events. New studies indicate that niacin potently increases high-density lipoproteins (HDL) by inhibiting HDL catabolism and decreases hepatic production of atherogenic very-low- and low-density lipoproteins by inhibiting the key enzyme for triglyceride synthesis (diacylglycerol acyltransferase). Statins, fibrates, bile acid sequestrants and ezetimibe have mechanisms that are different. Combination therapy using statins and niacin not only safely corrects dyslipidemia, but also yields ASCVD risk reduction significantly in excess of the 30% seen with monotherapy. Newer drugs with different mechanisms of action or combinations of new formulations have recently become available. Drug discovery research is likely to yield additional agents. Clinical trials focused on combination therapies to reduce ASCVD risk well beyond 30% need to be conducted to establish the rationale for further reducing the incidence of the primary cause of death today.", 
    "147": "Coronary heart disease is a major cause of death in Europe and the USA. Insudation of atherogenic lipoproteins, including low-density lipoprotein (LDL), into the artery wall is integral to atherosclerosis. It is clear that numerous genetic loci contribute to increased plasma levels of LDL. However, five specific monogenic disorders, three of which have been reported recently, are known to increase LDL. These are familial hypercholesterolemia (LDL receptor gene: LDLR); familial ligand-defective apoB- 100 (apoB gene: APOB); autosomal recessive hypercholesterolemia (ARH gene); sitosterolemia (ABCG5 or ABCG8 genes) and cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase deficiency (CYP7A1 gene). This review relates the mechanisms underlying these five disorders with specific therapeutic interventions.", 
    "148": "Elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol is associated with a significantly increased risk of coronary heart disease but lowering LDL-cholesterol to levels established in current National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) guidelines provides significant risk reduction. Nevertheless, many patients receiving lipid-lowering therapy, particularly those at highest coronary heart disease risk, do not reach LDL-cholesterol goals with their current medications. Ezetimibe (Zetia, Merck Schering-Plough) is the first of a new class of lipid-lowering drugs known as cholesterol absorption inhibitors. Ezetimibe has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile, which allows it to be administered once daily and to be given in conjunction with statins. In a series of randomized, controlled, multicenter studies, ezetimibe produced significant improvements in levels of LDL-cholesterol and other lipid parameters when used as monotherapy, with a safety profile comparable with that of placebo. Furthermore, coadministration of ezetimibe with a statin (simvastatin, atorvastatin, lovastatin, or pravastatin) was more effective than statin monotherapy in lowering LDL-cholesterol and improving other lipid parameters. Moreover, coadministration of ezetimibe with a statin allowed a greater percentage of patients to achieve treatment goals established in NCEP guidelines. The safety and side-effect profile of ezetimibe plus statin coadministration therapy was generally comparable with that of statin monotherapy. These studies establish ezetimibe as an effective lipid-lowering agent, which will likely be useful in the management of a broad range of patients with hypercholesterolemia. Ezetimibe can be used in conjunction with a statin at the beginning of therapy, or it can be added if patients do not achieve their LDL-cholesterol goal with statins alone."
