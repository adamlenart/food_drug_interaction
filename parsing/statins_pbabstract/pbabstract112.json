The study involved a prospective cohort of 164 patients who underwent coronary and valvular surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. There were 2 study groups: group A (n = 60), patients with elevated preoperative interleukin-6 levels; and group B (n = 104), patients with normal preoperative interleukin-6 levels. Each group was subdivided according to whether patients were (group 1) or were not (group 2) treated preoperatively with statins. Accordingly, the subdivided study groups were A1 (n = 40), A2 (n = 20), B1 (n = 56), and B2 (n = 48). The plasma levels of proinflammatory interleukin-6 were measured 1, 6, 24, and >72 hours after surgery. The baseline, operative, and postoperative morbidity and mortality characteristics were similar in all groups. Group A1 had significantly lower levels of interleukin-6 and troponin I than did group A2 at all postoperative time points. Group B1 had significantly lower levels of interleukin-6 than did group B2 postoperatively. There were no significant differences in troponin I levels between groups B1 and B2. We conclude that, in patients with preoperative activation of the inflammatory system, preoperative treatment with statins is associated with lower postoperative interleukin-6 and troponin I levels after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass.", 
    "1": "Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) and allograft dysfunction remain as two of the major clinical challenges after heart transplantation. Here, we investigated the effect of donor treatment with simvastatin and methylprednisolone on microvascular dysfunction and immunomodulation during IRI in rat cardiac allografts subjected to prolonged ischemia time.", 
    "2": "The DA rats received simvastatin, methylprednisolone, or both 2 hr before heart donation. The allografts were subjected to 4-hr hypothermic preservation and transplanted to the fully major histocompatibility complex-mismatched WF rat recipients.", 
    "3": "Six hours after reperfusion, donor treatment either with simvastatin alone or with high dose of methylprednisolone alone or in combination with simvastatin and methylprednisolone significantly reduced cardiac troponin T release and the number of allograft infiltrating ED1 macrophages MPO neutrophils. However, the combination donor treatment was superior in the prevention of IRI and significantly prolonged allograft survival. Donor simvastatin treatment inhibited allograft microvascular RhoA GTPase pathway activation, whereas methylprednisolone prevented activation of innate immune response and mRNA expression of hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u03b1 and its multiple target genes.", 
    "4": "Our results show that donor treatment in combination with simvastatin and methylprednisolone prevents IRI and has beneficial effect on allograft survival in rat cardiac allografts. Minimizing microvascular injury and the activation of innate immunity may offer a novel therapeutic strategy to expand the donor pool and furthermore improve the function of the marginal donor organs.", 
    "5": "The usual treatment of hypercholesterolemia includes a class of drugs known as statins (simvastatin among them), which inhibit the production of cholesterol. Another way of reducing cholesterol levels is with the use of phytosterols, which reduce the transport of exogenic cholesterol from the intestine into the blood stream. The two treatments can be combined, achieving an additive effect. However, both simvastatin and phytosterols are practically insoluble in water, and therefore their absorption and activity are low. Nanosized self-assembled structured liquid systems are modified microemulsions that present an alternative pathway for improving the bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drugs. The goal of this study was to solubilize the maximal quantity of both simvastatin and phytosterols in a single, fully dilutable microemulsion system. We constructed a water-dilutable liquid drug delivery system that includes sucrose monolaurate, propylene glycol, and oleyl lactate. This system exhibits high solubilization capacity for both simvastatin (7.0 wt%) and phytosterols (3.5 wt%) when each is solubilized separately in a water-free concentrate. When simvastatin and phytosterols were solubilized together at a wt ratio of 2.5:1, maximum solubilization was obtained with 4.7 wt% simvastatin and 1.9 wt% phytosterols. Structural and analytical methods were applied including rheology, DSC, SD-NMR, SAXS, and cryo-TEM. The water-free \"concentrate\" consisted of direct micelles for which propylene glycol served as the hydrophilic phase. Upon water dilution, the direct micelles appear to form \"lipophilic compounds dispersed in hydrophilic continuous phase\". The solubilizates are located in the droplet core and/or at the interface.", 
    "6": "Self-controlled analysis methods implicitly adjust for time-invariant confounding within individuals. A person's prognosis often varies over time and affects both therapy choice and subsequent health outcomes. Current approaches may not be able to fully address this within-person confounding. We evaluated the potential impact of time-varying prognosis in self-controlled studies of treatment effects and the extent to which alternative adjustment strategies could mitigate these biases.", 
    "7": "We used Medicare data linked to prescription drug data from a pharmaceutical assistance program to conduct case-crossover studies of the relationship between intermittent use of five classes of preventive medications (statins, oral hypoglycemics, antihypertensives, osteoporosis, and glaucoma medications) and death-relationships that are strongly biased because of healthy-user and sick-stopper effects. We used the case-case time-control design to adjust for confounding from exposure trends related to prognosis. Each class of medications was evaluated separately, with the remaining four used as reference drugs to estimate prognosis-related exposure trends.", 
    "8": "The case-crossover odds ratios were 0.39, 0.38, 0.40, 0.39, and 0.45 for statin, antihypertensive, glaucoma, hypoglycemic, and osteoporosis drugs, respectively. After adjusting for the estimated noncausal prognosis-related trends in drug exposure among all eligible cases, odds ratios were clustered closer to null (0.99, 0.95, 1.02, 0.99, and 1.16, respectively).", 
    "9": "Consideration of the sociology of medication use leading to health outcomes is essential in designing and analyzing self-controlled studies of treatment effects. Although the case-case time-control design was able to reduce bias from prognosis-related exposure trends in our examples, the difficulty in identifying appropriate reference exposures could be prohibitive.",

    "14": "Nondaily statin dosing is an alternative for patients unable to tolerate daily dosing. The higher potency and longer half-life of rosuvastatin lends itself to this regimen. The basis of this improved tolerability is not understood, but might be related to lower plasma drug concentrations. We examined the efficacy of nondaily rosuvastatin in previously statin-intolerant patients and determined plasma drug concentrations at various dose regimens.", 
    "15": "A retrospective analysis at a specialty lipid clinic identified 58 patients eligible for evaluation after therapy with nondaily rosuvastatin. Plasma rosuvastatin levels were measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry in 12 patients taking 10 mg nondaily rosuvastatin and in 11 and 12 age- and sex-matched patients taking 10 mg and 5 mg rosuvastatin daily, respectively. Whole body cholesterol synthesis was estimated from serum lathosterol measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.",

Serum lathosterol levels were significantly higher in patients on nondaily regimens, as expected. However, mean plasma rosuvastatin levels of patients taking 10 mg nondaily did not significantly differ from those taking 10 mg daily.", 
    "17": "In statin intolerant patients, nondaily rosuvastatin resulted in clinically relevant reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, with improved compliance. Whole body cholesterol synthesis was higher in patients taking nondaily rosuvastatin, but no differences in plasma drug concentrations were observed, suggesting that the improved tolerability was independent of plasma rosuvastatin levels.", 
    "18": "A proactive, multifactorial intervention strategy incorporating single-pill amlodipine/atorvastatin (SPAA) (5-10/10 mg up-titrated to 5-10/20 mg, where approved) is more effective than physician's usual care (UC) for reducing calculated 10 year coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, in patients with hypertension and additional risk factors (CRUCIAL trial: Curr Med Res Opin 2011;27:821--33). As SPAA combinations containing atorvastatin 20 mg are not approved in some countries, this post hoc analysis investigated the efficacy and safety of a proactive intervention strategy incorporating low-dose SPAA (5/10 or 10/10 mg) only (low-dose PI) versus UC.",

In epidemiological studies, use of statins has been associated with reduced risk of advanced prostate cancer. However, the effects of statins on prostate cancer disease progression following curative treatment have not been extensively studied, and previous studies reported conflicting results. This study found no clear association between overall statin use and risk of disease progression, as well as lack of a monotone dose-response relationship between the use of statins, whether it was use before or after prostatectomy, and prostate cancer disease progression.",

While \u03c9-3 fatty acids are commonly used in clinical practice for triglyceride lowering, no large-scale clinical trial evaluating their impact on clinical events has been performed. As a result, there remains a lack of consensus with regards to their optimal clinical use. Epanova(\u00ae) (Omthera Pharmaceuticals Inc., NJ, USA) is a novel \u03c9-3 free fatty acid formulation, developed to maximize eicosapentenoic acid and docosahexenoic acid bioavailability with low-fat diets, suggesting a potential therapeutic advantage compared with \u03c9-3-acid ethyl esters in the treatment of patients with hypertriglyceridemia.

However, citrinin, a human toxic substance, was also synthesized in this fungus. In this research, solidstate fermentation of M. purpureus TISTR 3541 was optimized by statistical methodology to obtain a high production of monacolin K and yellow pigment along with a low level of citrinin. Fractional factorial design was applied in this study to identify the significant factors. Among the 13 variables, five parameters (i.e., glycerol, methionine, sodium nitrate, cultivation time, and temperature) influencing monacolin K, yellow pigment, and citrinin production were identified. A central composite design was further employed to investigate the optimum level of these five factors. The maximum production of monacolin K and yellow pigment of 5,900 mg/kg and 1,700 units/g, respectively, and the minimum citrinin concentration of 0.26 mg/kg were achieved in the medium containing 2% glycerol, 0.14% methionine, and 0.01% sodium nitrate at 25\u00b0C for 16 days of cultivation. The yields of monacolin K and yellow pigment were about 3 and 1.5 times higher than the basal medium, respectively, whereas citrinin was dramatically reduced by 36 times.",

We carried out the present meta-analysis to investigate whether statins might be associated with a reduction on risk of dementia. We carried out a meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies to examine the risk of dementia associated with statins. Ovid-Medline database, PubMed database, Springer Link database and Google Scholar in English search were carried out for relevant studies. Selected studies had to describe an original study defined by strict screening and diagnostic criteria. We included eight prospective cohort studies that reported relative risks with 95% confidence intervals for the association of statins and dementia risk. A random effects model was used to calculate the summary risk estimates. The studies eligible for analysis involved 2851 cases and 57020 participants. The summary relative risk of dementia for the use of statins was 0.62 (95% confidence interval 0.43-0.81), with evidence of heterogeneity (P = 0.001, I(2) = 70.8%).

    "40": "Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a genetic disorder of lipid metabolism that is characterized by a significant elevation in levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and patients are at very high risk for premature coronary heart disease (CHD). The etiology of FH includes known mutations in the gene of the LDL receptor, LDLR; the gene of apolipoprotein B, apo B; and the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 gene, PCSK9. The National Lipid Association Expert Panel on Familial Hypercholesterolemia has provided recommendations for the screening and treatment of patients with FH. Early identification and aggressive treatment of FH in individual patients, as well as screening of all first-degree relatives, are recommended to minimize the risk for premature CHD. Similar to patients with conventional hypercholesterolemia, patients with FH should receive statins as initial treatment, but patients with FH may require higher doses of statins, more potent statins, statin-based combination therapy, or adjunctive therapies. Patients with FH who have additional risk factors for, or existing, cardiovascular disease or those with an inadequate response to initial statin therapy should have access to higher doses of the most efficacious statins; statins used in combination with other LDL-C-lowering agents should also be supported by formularies; additional treatments, such as LDL-C apheresis or novel therapies, may also be required to achieve acceptable LDL-C levels. New treatment approaches include mipomersen, which was approved by the FDA in January 2013. Mipomersen is an oligonucleotide inhibitor of apolipoprotein B-100 synthesis (called an antisense inhibitor) indicated as an adjunct to lipid-lowering medications and diet to reduce LDL-C, apolipoprotein B, total cholesterol, and non-high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (non-HDL-C) levels in patients with homozygous FH (HoFH). The microsomal transfer protein lomitapide has also received FDA approval for use only in patients with HoFH. Other novel treatments currently in development include PCSK9 inhibitors. Therapies such as apheresis are likely more expensive than simple therapy with a statin but may be needed to achieve long-term reductions in complications from nonfatal and fatal cardiovascular events and hospitalizations related to myocardial infarction, cardiac revascularization, and stroke in FH patients. The cost-effectiveness of this more aggressive therapy has not been determined and should be studied. Utilization of published guidelines and the recommendations from the National Lipid Association will help to optimize the management of patients with FH.", 
    "41": "1. Organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 plays a pivotal role in the disposition of many anionic drugs. Significant overlap in substrate specificity between individual OATP isoforms has hampered the identification of the relative importance of individual isoforms for hepatic uptake of xenobiotics. 2. The present study focused on the use of siRNA technology to decrease OATP1B1 selectively in human hepatocytes. Following delivery of siRNA by the novel lipid, AtuFECT01, mRNA expression of OATP1B1 was reduced by 94%-98% with no significant toxicity. Off-target effects were also shown to be minimal as evidenced by the expression of common drug metabolizing enzymes, transporters, nuclear receptors and associated co-regulators. Uptake of estrone-3-sulfate (5\u2009nM) by OATP1B1 was reduced by 82%-95%. This methodology was subsequently used to assess the relative contribution of OATP1B1 uptake in human hepatocytes for olmesartan (42%-62%), valsartan (28%-81%), rosuvastatin (64%-72%), pitavastatin (84%-98%) and lopinavir (64%-89%). These data are consistent with previous values obtained using a relative activity factor approach. 3. The siRNA approach provides a robust and reproducible method for assessing the relative contribution of OATP1B1 to hepatic uptake of new chemical entities. The technique also has potential utility in facilitating detailed characterization of drug-drug interactions involving hepatic drug transporters.", 
    "42": "Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-specific condition characterized by an imbalance of circulating angiogenic factors and new-onset hypertension. Although current treatment options are limited, recent studies suggest that pravastatin may improve angiogenic profile and reduce blood pressure in preeclampsia. We hypothesized pravastatin would restore angiogenic balance and reduce mean arterial pressure (MAP) in rats with reduced utero-placental perfusion pressure (RUPP)-induced hypertension. Pravastatin was administered intraperitoneally (1 mg/kg per day) in RUPP (RUPP+P) and normal pregnant rats (NP+P) from day 14 to 19 of pregnancy. On day 19, MAP was measured via catheter, conceptus data were recorded, and tissues collected. MAP was increased (P<0.05) in RUPP compared with NP dams, and pravastatin ameliorated this difference. Pravastatin attenuated decreased fetal weight and plasma vascular endothelial growth factor and the RUPP-induced increased soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 when compared with NP dams. Pravastatin treatment did not improve angiogenic potential in RUPP serum and decreased (P<0.05) endothelial tube formation in NP rats. RUPP rats presented with indices of oxidative stress, such as increased placental catalase activity and plasma thiobarbituric acid reactive substances along with decreased plasma total antioxidant capacity compared with NP controls, and pravastatin attenuated these effects. MAP, fetal weight, plasma vascular endothelial growth factor, and plasma soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 were unchanged in NP+P compared with NP controls. The present data indicate that treatment with pravastatin attenuates oxidative stress and lowers MAP in placental ischemia-induced hypertension, but may have negative effects on circulating angiogenic potential during pregnancy. Further studies are needed to determine whether there are long-term deleterious effects on maternal or fetal health after pravastatin treatment during pregnancy-induced hypertension or preeclampsia.", 
    "43": "Hematologic parameters such as mean platelet volume (MPV), red cell distribution width (RDW), and neutrophil to lymphocyte (N/L) ratio are associated with increased cardiovascular risk. We investigated the effect of atorvastatin on hematologic parameters in patients with hypercholesterolemia. A total of 79 patients with hypercholesterolemia and 47 normocholesterolemic healthy participants were included. Patients with hypercholesterolemia received 10 to 80 mg/d atorvastatin during a 24-week period. Hematologic parameters were measured at baseline and after 6 months. Atorvastatin treatment produced a significant decrease in MPV levels (9.3 \u00b1 1.3 vs 9.1 \u00b1 1.2 fL, P = .008) and platelet count (259 \u00b1 61 vs 248 \u00b1 51 10(9)/L, P = .005). The N/L ratio decreased significantly after atorvastatin treatment from 2.9 \u00b1 1.2 to 2.6 \u00b1 1.1, (P = .014). The RDW and platelet distribution width levels were not different among the study groups, before and after treatment. Atorvastatin may beneficially reduce MPV levels and N/L ratio. This antiplatelet and anti-inflammatory effect of atorvastatin treatment could play a role in reducing cardiovascular risk.",

Lipoteichoic acid (LTA) is a cell wall component of gram-positive bacteria. It is a potent inducer of inflammatory mediators in human dendritic cells, human pulmonary epithelial cells, and murine macrophages. However, the effect of LTA on human alveolar macrophages (AMs) which are the major effector cells in host defense against respiratory tract infections has hardly been studied. Statins have anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antioxidative, anticoagulant, and antibacterial activities. These effects may be contributed to reduce the markers of systemic inflammation. Emerging retrospective studies have demonstrated that statin use decreased the mortality of pneumonia. However, the precise mechanisms responsible for these effects are unclear. The purpose of this study is to define the role of S. aureus LTA in human AMs and the effects of simvastatin (SV) on LTA-stimulated human AMs. The results showed that LTA induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1beta (IL-1\u03b2), IL-8 mRNA expression, and suppressed IL-10 mRNA expression in human AMs. Simultaneously, LTA induced human AMs apoptosis. These effects were parallel with the up-regulation of the expression of NF-\u03baB-P65 protein in the LTA-stimulated human AMs. The above effects of LTA on human AMs were inhibited significantly by SV. These data indicate that S. aureus LTA induces potent pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic effects on human AMs and statins exert anti-inflammatory effects by mediating inhibition of NF-\u03baB activation and cytokine mRNA expression in human AMs. These results may explain, in part, the mechanisms responsible for favorable effects of statins on pneumonia.",

Statins can cause hyperinsulinemia even in the absence of hyperglycemia and the potential mitogenic effects and implications of prolonged hyperinsulinemia are discussed. Suggestions are made as to how physicians might avert the hyperinsulinemic and diabetogenic effects of statin therapy in clinical practice, and modulate the detrimental effects of these drugs on exercise performance. Finally, long-term studies are needed to determine if the deleterious hyperinsulinemic and diabetogenic effects of statin therapy undermine the beneficial cardiovascular disease risk outcomes in various segments of the population.",

In this work, a comprehensive study for the co-encapsulation of drugs with a differential lipophilicity, olanzapine and simvastatin, and their transdermal delivery in a formulation containing nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) is presented. Focus is given to the evaluation of a strategy in which NLC and chemical permeation enhancers are combined. It comprises in vitro, in silico and cellular viability approaches. The optimization and rationalization of the systems are carried out using a two-step factorial design. It is shown that the external medium in the NLC dispersion strongly influences permeation. It is also seen that the use of NLC determines a synergistic effect with selected permeation enhancers, thus promoting marked flux enhancement ratios (48 and 21, respectively for olanzapine and simvastatin) relative to the drugs in solution. The developed formulations can be considered non-irritant. A correlation between enhancer positioning in a lipid bilayer, partially governed by a H-bonding phenomenon, and enhancement effect is suggested from molecular dynamics studies and experimental observations.",

In addition, an effort was made to find differences in accumulation and control of ROS in submerged (SmF) and solid-state fermentation (SSF), which could help explain higher metabolite production in the latter. sod1 expression, ROS content, and redox balance kinetics were measured during SmF and SSF. Results showed that A. terreus sod1 gene (oxidative stress defence enzyme) was intensely expressed during rapid growth phase (trophophase) of lovastatin fermentations. This high expression decreased abruptly, just before the onset of production (idiophase). However, ROS measurements detected high concentrations only in idiophase, suggesting a link between ROS and lovastatin biosynthesis. Apparently sod1 down regulation promotes the rise of ROS during idiophase. This oxidative state in idiophase was further supported by a high redox balance observed in trophophase that changed to a low value in idiophase (around six-fold lower). The patterns of ROS accumulation, sod1 expression, and redox balance behaviour were similar in SmF and SSF. However, sod1 expression and ROS concentration (ten-fold), were higher in SmF. Our results indicate a link between ROS and lovastatin biosynthesis. Also, showed differences of physiology in SSF that yield lower but more steady ROS concentrations, which could be associated to higher lovastatin production.",

Primary deficiency has been well described and results from mutations in genes involved in CoQ10 biosynthesis. Secondary deficiency may be linked to hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins), which are used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Dietary contributions of CoQ10 are very small, but supplementation is effective in increasing plasma CoQ10 levels. It has been clearly demonstrated that treatment with CoQ10 is effective in numerous disorders and deficiency states and that supplementation has a favorable outcome.

In terms of reducing major coronary events, atorvastatin (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.48-0.94) and fluvastatin (OR 0.59, 95% CI 0.36-0.95) were significantly more effective than rosuvastatin at comparable doses.

Across all populations, atorvastatin (80%), fluvastatin (79%), and simvastatin (62%) had the highest overall probability of being the best treatment in terms of both outcomes. Higher doses of atorvastatin and fluvastatin had the highest number of significant differences in preventing major coronary events compared with other statins. No significant heterogeneity or inconsistency was detected.",

We examined the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin by administering it while fasting and after intake of low-fat and high-fat meals. We administered a single 10-mg oral dose of rosuvastatin while fasting and after intake of a low-fat and high-fat meal in a parallel design. The plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin were measured using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin was analyzed using both noncompartmental and compartmental models. The values of area under the curve at 24 h (AUC 24 h ) and peak plasma concentration (C max) in fed conditions were significantly lower than the corresponding values in the fasting conditions. In addition, consumption of a high-fat meal significantly delayed the time required to achieve the maximum concentration (T max) of rosuvastatin. Both the models sufficiently explained the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin and showed that the volume of distribution (V c) was increased and absorption rate constant (K a) was decreased in fed dogs. These findings suggest that food intake affects both the rate and extent of absorption of rosuvastatin, and that rosuvastatin should be administered on an empty stomach to avoid food effect.",

The ability to remain compliant with ER niacin 2 g plus laropiprant 40 mg daily (ERN/LRPT) for ~1 month was then assessed in 38 369 patients and about one-third were excluded (mainly due to niacin side effects). A total of 25 673 patients were randomized between ERN/LRPT daily vs. placebo and were followed for a median of 3.9 years. By the end of the study, 25% of participants allocated ERN/LRPT vs. 17% allocated placebo had stopped their study treatment. The most common medical reasons for stopping ERN/LRPT were related to skin, gastrointestinal, diabetes, and musculoskeletal side effects. When added to statin-based LDL-lowering therapy, allocation to ERN/LRPT increased the risk of definite myopathy [75 (0.16%/year) vs. 17 (0.04%/year): risk ratio 4.4; 95% CI 2.6-7.5; P < 0.0001]; 7 vs. 5 were rhabdomyolysis.

Systemic oxidative stress, which is highly prevalent in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, has been shown to decrease antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of HDL and even transform it into a pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory agent. For this reason, we believe that the propensity for accelerated cardiovascular disease in CKD is facilitated by a few key features of this disease, namely, oxidative stress, inflammation, hypertension, and disorders of lipid metabolism. In a nutshell, oxidative stress and inflammation enhance atherosclerosis leading to increased cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in this population. In this detailed review, we highlight the current knowledge on HDL dysfunction and impairment in chronic kidney disease as well as the available therapy.",

This review focuses on ethnic variability in the clinical pharmacokinetics of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl co-enzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) and angiotensin II receptor antagonists. The mechanisms of such variability are discussed quantitatively, with building a hypothetical model for pravastatin, and validated against other statins. Our analyses suggest that the ethnic variability in the plasma exposure of statins cannot be explained only by the difference in the allele frequencies of organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1 and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), and the intrinsic ethnic variability in the activity of OATP1B1 (the ratio of Japanese/Caucasians is 0.584) must be considered. Further work and validation with additional data will clarify the applicability of this model to other OATP1B1 substrates.",

Increased brain concentrations of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptides and impaired cerebral blood flow (CBF) are shared pathologic features of TBI and AD and promising therapeutic targets. We used arterial spin-labeling magnetic resonance imaging to examine if CBF changes after TBI are influenced by human A\u03b2 and amenable to simvastatin therapy. CBF was measured 3 days and 3 weeks after controlled cortical impact (CCI) injury in transgenic human A\u03b2-expressing APP(NLh/NLh) mice compared to murine A\u03b2-expressing C57Bl/6J wild types. Compared to uninjured littermates, CBF was reduced in the cortex of the injured hemisphere in both A\u03b2 transgenics and wild types; deficits were more pronounced in the transgenic group, which exhibited injury-induced increased concentrations of human A\u03b2. In the hemisphere contralateral to CCI, CBF levels were stable in A\u03b2 transgenic mice but increased in wild-type mice, both relative to uninjured littermates. Post-injury treatment of A\u03b2 transgenic mice with simvastatin lowered brain A\u03b2 concentrations, attenuated deficits in CBF ipsilateral to injury, restored hyperemia contralateral to injury, and reduced brain tissue loss. Future studies examining long-term effects of simvastatin therapy on CBF and chronic neurodegenerative changes after TBI are warranted.",

In the method, the carboxyl-modified microspheres were conjugated with CIT-Ovalbumin (OVA) antigen. CIT competed with the CIT-OVA antigen on the surface of the microspheres for the anti-CIT McAb. Under the optimised conditions, IC(50) value was 1.0 ng/mL and the limit of detection reached 0.005 ng/mL. The cross-reactivity was less than 0.01% against each of the four mycotoxins such as aflatoxin B(1) (AFB(1)), ochratoxin A (OTA), zearalenone (ZEA), deoxynilvalenol (DON). In the work, the MFCI could accurately determine CIT in the real red yeast rice. The systematic error was low with the coefficient of variation (CV) from 5.24% to 8.16% by the MFCI. The mean recovery of CIT from artificially contaminated red yeast rice was from 89% to 94%, with CV from 7.2% to 8.7%.

By using two different quantitative formats to communicate risk level and effectiveness of a cholesterol-lowering drug, we posed the research question: how does the format of risk information influence patients' decisions concerning therapy, patients' satisfaction with the communication as well as confidence in the decision. We hypothesise that patients are less prone to accept therapy when the benefits of long-term intervention are presented in terms of prolongation of life (POL) in months compared to the absolute risk reduction (ARR).

Despite the relative success of the most commonly prescribed mast cell stabilizer, disodium cromoglycate, in use for the preventative treatment of bronchial asthma, allergic conjunctivitis and vernal keratoconjunctivitis, there still remains an urgent need to design new substances that are less expensive and require less frequent dosing schedules. In this regard, recent developments towards the discovery of the next generation of mast cell stabilizing drugs has included studies on substances isolated from natural sources, biological, newly synthesized compounds and drugs licensed for other indications. The diversity of natural products evaluated range from simple phenols, alkaloids, terpenes to simple amino acids. While in some cases their precise mode of action remains unknown it has nevertheless sparked interest in the development of synthetic derivatives with improved pharmacological properties. Within the purely synthetic class of inhibitors, particular attention has been devoted to the inhibition of important signalling molecules including spleen TK and JAK3.

The purpose of the present study was to determine ex vivo the effect of the synthetic statin, atorvastatin, a known cholesterol-lowering drug, on peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from CLL patients. Using flow cytometry, we investigated the viability and induction of apoptosis in leukemic cells exposed to statin by the Vybrant apoptosis assay kit #4, compared with untreated control cells. We also examined the expression levels of apoptosis-regulatory proteins (Mcl-1, Bcl-2 and Bax), as well as products of the expression/proteolysis of lamin B, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase\u20111 (PARP\u20111) and p27Kip1 by western blot analysis. Moreover, the number of sub-G1 cells and DNA fragmentation in atorvastatin-treated leukemic cells were examined by flow cytometry and agarose gel electrophoresis, respectively. The obtained results indicated that CLL cells ex vivo were extremely sensitive to atorvastatin. The cytotoxic effect of this statin was caused by the induction of apoptosis in the leukemic cells. The induction of apoptosis in the drug-treated model cells was confirmed by the reduction or proteolysis of apoptotic markers, such as PARP-1, lamin B and p27Kip1, the increase in the number of sub-G1 cells and DNA ladder formation. During atorvastatin-triggered apoptosis, changes in the expression levels of mitochondrial outer membrane permeability regulatory proteins of the Bcl-2 family were also observed. Ex vivo promising data indicate the strong cytotoxic and pro-apoptotic potential of atorvastatin against leukemic cells, but not normal cells.

The purpose of a screening design is to identify the factors that have significant effects on the selected chromatographic responses, and for this purpose a full 23 factorial design was used. The location of the true optimum was established by applying Derringer's desirability function, which provides simultaneously optimization of all seven responses. The ranges of the independent variables used for the optimization were content of acetonitrile in mobile phase (60-70%), temperature of column (30-40 \u00b0C) and flow rate (0.8-1.2 mL min\u207b\u00b9). The influences of these independent variables were evaluated for the output responses: retention time of first peak (p-hydroxyatorvastatin) and of last peak (atorvastatin, lactone form), symmetries of all four peaks and relative retention time of p-hydroxyatorvastatin. The primary goal of this investigation was establishing a new simple and sensitive method that could be used in analysis of biological samples. The method was validated and successfully applied for determination of atorvastatin (acid and lactone forms) and its metabolites in plasma.",

Here, we tested the hypothesis that the anti-atherosclerosis effects of NXT might be mediated by suppressing maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) in a mice model of atherosclerosis. LDLR(-/-) mice fed a high-fat diet were treated with placebo, NXT (0.7 g/kg/d, oral diet) or simvastatin (100mg/kg/d, oral diet) for 8 weeks, respectively. NXT treatment significantly reduced plasma triglyceride (112 \u00b1 18 mg/dl vs. 192 \u00b1 68 mg/dl, P<0.05) and total cholesterol (944 \u00b1 158 mg/dl vs. 1387 \u00b1 208 mg/dl, P<0.05) compared to placebo treatment. Vascular lesions were significantly smaller and macrophage content and amount of DCs in plaques were significantly less in NXT and simvastatin groups than in placebo group (all P<0.05). In addition, expressions of splenic DC membrane molecules (CD40, CD86 and CD80) and the plasma level of IL-12p70 were significantly lower in NXT and simvastatin groups than in placebo group. In conclusion, NXT protects against atherosclerosis through lipid-lowering and inhibiting DCs maturation in this mice model of atherosclerosis.",

We conducted meta-analysis using the randomised controlled trials (RCTs) conducted in patients who suffered from Alzheimer's disease, by conducting searches for RCTs in MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane (up to 2012). An overall of five studies were included and analysed. The evaluation was done for some commonly evaluated clinical parameters like Clinical Global Impression of Change (CGIC), Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-CoG). Statistical evaluation was done as per method described by Neyeloff et\u00a0al. and forest plots were plotted for each evaluated parameter. MMSE score showed a significant difference in favour of statins. ADAS-CoG and CGIC did not show a significant advantage for statins in comparison to placebo. Highly heterogeneous distribution was seen for MMSE score. Further trials need to be conducted to arrive at more robust results.",

I discuss here further instances of gene-gene-drug interactions, including a proposed dynamic effect on statin therapy by genetic variants in both a transporter (SLCO1B1) and a metabolizing enzyme (CYP3A4) in liver cells, the main target site where statins block cholesterol synthesis.

To investigate the risk factors for allopurinol-induced adverse events, the authors enrolled 94 patients who developed allopurinol-induced adverse events and 378 controls who were randomly chosen from 1934 patients who used allopurinol but did not develop any adverse events in this retrospective case control study. Univariate analysis showed that patients who developed allopurinol-induced adverse events had more chronic kidney disease (46% vs 30%, P = .005), more hypertension (42% vs 30%, P = .036), less tumor lysis syndrome (P = .030), higher cholesterol (P = .013), and lower aspartate aminotransferase (P = .002) and alanine aminotransferase levels (P = .033) and more commonly used angiotensin receptor blockers (27% vs 15%, P = .007), colchicines (16% vs 5%, P = .010), or statins (19% vs 8%, P = .002) than those who did not.

Clinical trials in both primary and secondary prevention have demonstrated reduction in cardiovascular events by statin therapy. However, early epidemiologic studies proposed an inverse relationship between cholesterol levels and mortality. While the epidemiologic studies were controversial and did not establish a cause and effect relationship, concern was raised that aggressive lipid lowering by pharmacological means may be associated with increased risk for noncardiac mortality, including malignancy. The theoretical concern was intensified by meta-analysis of statin trials, which confirmed the reduction in cardiovascular mortality but also demonstrated a potential increase in cancer risk. This review evaluates the epidemiologic and prospective trial data which address the potential relationship between aggressive statin therapy and the risk of malignancy.", 
    "160": "Membrane raft (MR)-redox signaling platforms associated with NADPH oxidase are involved in coronary endothelial dysfunction. Here, we studied whether statins interfere with the formation of MR-redox signaling platforms to protect the coronary arterial endothelium from oxidized low-density lipoprotein (OxLDL)-induced injury and from acute hypercholesterolemia. In cultured human coronary arterial endothelial cells, confocal microscopy detected the formation of an MRs clustering when they were exposed to OxLDL, and such MR platform formation was inhibited markedly by statins, including pravastatin and simvastatin. In these MR clusters, NADPH oxidase subunits gp91(phox) and p47(phox) were aggregated and were markedly blocked by both statins. In addition, colocalization of acid sphingomyelinase (ASM) and ceramide was induced by OxLDL, which was blocked by statins. Electron spin resonance spectrometry showed that OxLDL-induced superoxide (O2(.-)) production in the MR fractions was substantially reduced by statins. In coronary artery intima of mice with acute hypercholesterolemia, confocal microscopy revealed a colocalization of gp91(phox), p47(phox), ASM, or ceramide in MR clusters. Such colocalization was rarely observed in the arteries of normal mice or significantly reduced by pretreatment of hypercholesterolemic mice with statins. Furthermore, O2(.-) production in situ was 3-fold higher in the coronary arteries from hypercholesterolemic mice than in those from normal mice, and such increase was inhibited by statins. Our results indicate that blockade of MR-redox signaling platform formation in endothelial cell membrane may be another important therapeutic mechanism of statins in preventing endothelial injury and atherosclerosis and may be associated with their direct action on membrane cholesterol structure and function.",

The results indicated that the voltammetric response of ATOR was improved distinctly in the low concentration of CTAB, suggesting that CTAB exhibits noticeable enhancement effect to the determination of ATOR. The dependence of current on pH, concentration and scan rate were investigated to optimize the experimental conditions for the determination of ATOR. The anodic peak was characterized and the process was adsorption-controlled. The number of electrons transferred in the oxidation process was calculated and a plausible oxidation mechanism was proposed. In the range of 0.05-10 \u03bcM, the current measured by DPV presents a good linear property as a function of the concentration of ATOR with a detection limit of 4.08 nM with good selectivity and sensitivity. The proposed method was successfully applied to ATOR determination in pharmaceutical samples and urine as a real sample. This method can be employed in clinical analysis, quality control and routine determination of drugs in pharmaceutical formulations.",

In addition, the effect of p38 MAPK inhibition on the induction of apoptosis in MM cells by the combination of thalidomide and simvastatin was investigated. Thalidomide was observed to significantly potentiate the antiproliferative activity of statins and enhance the proapoptotic effect of simvastatin and lovastatin. What is more, the combination of thalidomide with statins inhibited cell migration and decreased the production of VEGF and MMP-9 in MM cells more effectively than each of these drugs used separately. The combination of simvastatin and thalidomide augmented caspase 8 and 3 activation, and the additional application of p38 MAPK inhibitor resulted in enhanced apoptosis of MM cells concomitant with increased caspase 9 and 3 activation, as well as JNK phosphorylation. The results suggest that p38 inhibitors together with the combination of simvastatin and thalidomide have the potential to be used in MM treatment.",

Evolution: 7 weeks. HFD rats showed increased body, epididymal and lumbar adipose tissue weights. Plasma levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, VLDL, glucose and insulin and leptin/adiponectin ratio were higher in HFD rats, and rosuvastatin treatment reduced them. SIRT-1, p53, PGC-1\u03b1, PPAR-\u03b3 and GLUT-4 protein levels in white adipose tissue (WAT) were lower, and JNK was higher in HFD rats compared to controls. Rosuvastatin treatment normalized expression of these mediators. Endothelium-dependent relaxation was reduced in mesenteric rings from HFD rats compared to controls and rosuvastatin enhanced it in HFD rats.",

Reduction of leptin and JNK, and enhancement of SIRT-1, p53, PGC-1\u03b1, PPAR-\u03b3 and GLUT-4 expression in WAT could contribute to insulin sensitization. Normalization of SIRT-1 expression in WAT could be considered a key novel mechanism that aids in explaining the beneficial effects of rosuvastatin on the amelioration of glucose metabolism and the arrangement of multiple signaling pathways participating in insulin resistance in overweight HFD rats.",

Although statins increase serum PCSK9 levels, the effects of different types of statins on the serum PCSK9 levels have not been examined in detail. The purpose of the present study was to compare the effects of pitavastatin versus pravastatin on the serum PCSK9 levels. A total of 164 patients with coronary artery disease who were not receiving lipid-lowering therapy were randomly assigned to receive either 4\u00a0mg/day of pitavastatin (intensive lipid-lowering therapy) or 20 mg/day of pravastatin (moderate lipid-lowering therapy). The serum PCSK9 levels were measured before statin treatment and 8 months after therapy. A significantly greater reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was observed in the pitavastatin group (-41% vs\u00a0-28%, p\u00a0= 0.0001). The serum levels of total PCSK9 and heterodimer PCSK9 significantly increased from 192 to 249 ng/ml (37%, p <0.0001) and 147 to 206 ng/ml (78%, p <0.0001) in the pitavastatin group and from 192 to 249 ng/ml (39%, p <0.0001) and 143 to 201 ng/ml (65%, p <0.0001) in the pravastatin group, respectively. The increase in total and heterodimer PSCK9 did not differ between the 2 groups. No significant correlations were found between the percentage of changes in heterodimer PCSK9 and changes in the various lipid parameters in either group. In conclusion, significant increases in the total and heterodimer PSCK9 levels were observed at 8 months after treatment with pitavastatin and pravastatin; however, these increases did not differ between the 2 statins.", 
    "175": "Nonadherence to cardiovascular medications such as statins is a common, important problem. Clinicians currently rely on intuition to identify medication nonadherence. The visit-to-visit variability (VVV) of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol might represent an opportunity to identify statin nonadherence with greater accuracy. We examined the clinical and pharmacy data from 782 members of the Boston Medical Center Health Plan, seen at either the Boston Medical Center or its affiliated community health centers, who were taking statins and had \u22653 LDL cholesterol measurements from 2008 to 2011. The LDL cholesterol VVV (defined by the within-patient SD) was categorized into quintiles. Multivariate logistic regression models were generated with statin nonadherence (defined by the standard 80% pharmacy refill-based medication possession ratio threshold) as the dependent variable. The proportion of statin nonadherence increased across the quintiles of LDL cholesterol VVV (64.3%, 71.2%, 89.2%, 92.3%, 91.7%). Higher quintiles of LDL cholesterol VVV had a strong positive association with statin nonadherence, with an adjusted odds ratio of 3.4 (95% confidence interval 1.7 to 7.1) in the highest versus lowest quintile of LDL cholesterol VVV. The age- and gender-adjusted model had poor discrimination (C-statistic 0.62, 95% confidence interval 0.57 to 0.67), but the final adjusted model (age, gender, race, mean LDL cholesterol) demonstrated good discrimination (C-statistic 0.75, 95% confidence interval 0.71 to 0.79) between the adherent and nonadherent patients. In conclusion, the VVV of LDL cholesterol demonstrated a strong association with statin nonadherence in a clinic setting. Furthermore, a VVV of LDL cholesterol-based model had good discrimination characteristics for statin nonadherence. Research is needed to validate and generalize these findings to other populations and biomarkers.",

Whether, and the extent to which, individual statins differ in terms of their effect on these outcomes has not been studied. The aim of this review was to evaluate the comparative effects of individual statins on major cerebrovascular events. We systematically reviewed 61 trials including 187 038 individuals with, or at risk of developing, cardiovascular disease. We performed pair-wise and multiple-treatments meta-analyses for major cerebrovascular events, in addition to fatal and non-fatal strokes separately. Across all populations, statins were significantly more effective than control in reducing major cerebrovascular events [odds ratio (OR): 0.82, 95% CI: 0.77, 0.87], with no differences among individual statins. Statins were also effective in patients with established cardiovascular disease (OR: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.75, 0.91) and in those without (OR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.71, 0.91). Considering individual statins, significant risk reductions were achieved with atorvastatin (OR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.63, 0.85), pravastatin (OR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.76, 0.97) and simvastatin (OR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.62, 0.88) as compared with control on major cerebrovascular events across all populations.

Findings were not sensitive to dose differentials of individual statins across the trials. No significant heterogeneity or inconsistency was detected. Statins significantly reduce the incidence of major cerebrovascular events as compared with control. Our analysis provided evidence to confirm the class effect of statins in preventing major cerebrovascular events.",

Literature was included on influence of bariatric surgery on pharmacoepidemiology and pharmacokinetics. Drug classes to be searched for were antidepressants, antidiabetics, statins, antihypertensive agents, corticosteroids, oral contraceptives, and thyroid drugs. A reduction in the use of medication by patients after bariatric surgery has been reported for various drug classes. Very few studies have been published on the influence of bariatric surgery on the pharmacokinetics of drugs. After bariatric surgery, theoretically, reduced drug absorption may occur. Correct dosing and choosing the right dosage form for drugs used by patients after bariatric surgery are necessary for optimal pharmacotherapy.

However, the effects of statin therapy in patients with CAD and chronic kidney disease (CKD) remain unclear. Within a single hospital-based cohort in the Shinken Database 2004-2010 comprising all patients (n = 15,227) who visited the Cardiovascular Institute, we followed patients with CKD and CAD after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). A major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular event (MACCE) was defined by composite end points, including death, myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction, cerebral hemorrhage, and target lesion revascularization. A total of 391 patients were included in this study (median follow-up time 905 \u00b1 679 days). Of these, 209 patients used statins. Patients with statin therapy were younger than those without. Obesity and dyslipidemia were more common, and the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was significantly higher, in patients undergoing statin treatment. MACCE and cardiac death tended to be less common, and all-cause death was significantly less common, in patients taking statins. Multivariate analysis showed that low estimated GFR, poor left ventricular ejection fraction, and the absence of statin therapy were independent predictors for all-cause death of CKD patients after PCI. Statin therapy was associated with reduced all-cause mortality in patients with CKD and CAD after PCI.", 
    "183": "Organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs) mediate the liver uptake and hence plasma clearance of a broad range of drugs. For rosuvastatin, a cholesterol-lowering drug and OATP1A/1B substrate, the liver represents both its main therapeutic target and its primary clearance organ. Here we studied the impact of Oatp1a/1b uptake transporters on the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin using wild-type and Oatp1a/1b-null mice. After oral administration (15 mg/kg), intestinal absorption of rosuvastatin was not impaired in Oatp1a/1b-null mice, but systemic exposure (area under the curve) was 8-fold higher in these mice compared with wild-type. Although liver exposure was comparable between the two mouse strains (despite the increased blood exposure), the liver-to-blood ratios were markedly decreased (>10-fold) in the absence of Oatp1a/1b transporters. After intravenous administration (5 mg/kg), systemic exposure was 3-fold higher in Oatp1a/1b-null mice than in the wild-type mice. Liver, small intestinal, and kidney exposure were slightly, but not significantly, increased in Oatp1a/1b-null mice. The biliary excretion of rosuvastatin was very fast, with 60% of the dose eliminated within 15 minutes after intravenous administration, and also not significantly altered in Oatp1a/1b-null mice. Rosuvastatin renal clearance, although still minor, was increased \u223c15-fold in Oatp1a/1b-null males, suggesting a role of Oatp1a1 in the renal reabsorption of rosuvastatin. Absence of Oatp1a/1b uptake transporters increases the systemic exposure of rosuvastatin by reducing its hepatic extraction ratio. However, liver concentrations are not significantly affected, most likely due to the compensatory activity of high-capacity, low-affinity alternative uptake transporters at higher systemic rosuvastatin levels and the absence of efficient alternative rosuvastatin clearance mechanisms."
