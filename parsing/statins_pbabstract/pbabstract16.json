    "4": "Given the high costs of conducting a drug-response trial, researchers are now aiming to use retrospective analyses to conduct genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify underlying genetic contributions to drug-response variation. To prevent confounding results from a GWAS to investigate drug response, it is necessary to account for concomitant medications, defined as any medication taken concurrently with the primary medication being investigated. We use data from the Action to Control Cardiovascular Disease (ACCORD) trial in order to implement a novel scoring procedure for incorporating concomitant medication information into a linear regression model in preparation for GWAS. In order to accomplish this, two primary medications were selected: thiazolidinediones and metformin because of the wide-spread use of these medications and large sample sizes available within the ACCORD trial. A third medication, fenofibrate, along with a known confounding medication, statin, were chosen as a proof-of-principle for the scoring procedure. Previous studies have identified SNP rs7412 as being associated with statin response. Here we hypothesize that including the score for statin as a covariate in the GWAS model will correct for confounding of statin and yield a change in association at rs7412. The response of the confounded signal was successfully diminished from p = 3.19 \u00d7 10(-7) to p = 1.76 \u00d7 10(-5), by accounting for statin using the scoring procedure presented here. This approach provides the ability for researchers to account for concomitant medications in complex trial designs where monotherapy treatment regimens are not available.",

Consequently, a retrospective analysis of data from subjects without diabetes in the Treating to New Targets and the Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels randomized controlled trials was performed, subdividing participants into 4 experimental groups: (1) normal fasting glucose (NFG) and TG \u22641.7\u00a0mmol/l (42%); (2) NFG and TG >1.7\u00a0mmol/l (22%); (3) PreDM and TG \u22641.7\u00a0mmol/l (20%); and (4) PreDM and TG >1.7\u00a0mmol/l (15%). Comparable groupings were created substituting BMI values (kg/m(2) <27.0 and \u226527.0) for TG concentrations. Patients received atorvastatin or placebo for a median duration of 4.9\u00a0years. Incident T2DM, defined by developing at least 2 fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentrations \u2265126\u00a0mg/dl, an increase in FPG \u226537\u00a0mg/dl, or a clinical diagnosis of T2DM, was observed in 8.2% of the total population. T2DM event rates (statin or placebo) varied from a low of 2.8%/3.2% (NFG and TG \u22641.7\u00a0mmol/l) to a high of 22.8%/7.6% (PreDM and TG >1.7\u00a0mmol/l) with intermediate values for only an elevated TG >1.7\u00a0mmol/l (5.2%/4.3%) or only PreDM (12.8%/7.6%). Comparable differences were observed when BMI values were substituted for TG concentrations. In conclusion, these data suggest that (1) the diabetogenic impact of statin treatment is relatively modest in general; (2) the diabetogenic impact is accentuated relatively dramatically as FPG and TG concentrations and BMI increase; and (3) PreDM, TG concentrations, and BMI identify people at highest risk of statin-associated T2DM.",

A total of 92 patients with AF were randomly assigned to the case group (n=46), in which the patients were treated with fluvastatin (80mg) plus benazepril (10mg), or to the control group (n=46), in which the patients were treated with fluvastatin (80mg). The conversion rate of sinus rhythm was higher in the case group than in the control group (P<0.05). The case group had more treatment-effective patients than the control group, with fewer treatment-ineffective patients (P<0.05). The LVEDd, LVESd, LAD, and LVEF indexes in the case group were lower than in the control group after 6 months of treatment (all P<0.05). Levels of hs-CRP were also lower in patients in the case group than in patients in the control group after 1 month of treatment (P<0.05). After 12 months, renin and Ang II concentrations were lower in patients in the case group than in the control group (both P<0.05). Significant differences in IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 expression were found between the two groups after 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months of treatment (all P<0.05). Compared to patients in the control group, the levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides, and LDL-C in the case group were lower after 6 and 12 months of treatment (all P<0.05), while the HDL level was higher (P<0.05).

    "16": "Simvastatin,a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, is clinically used in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Numerous studies demonstrate that statins increase the risk of new-onset diabetes in long-term therapy, but mechanisms underpinning this effect are still unclear. Here, we investigated whether simvastatin inhibited the glucose uptake activity and the underlying mechanisms in C2C12 myotubes. Our studies showed that simvastatin significantly inhibited glucose uptake activity and GLUT4 translocation, whereas the effect was reversible with mevalonolactone (ML), which acts as an intermediate of cholesterol synthesis pathway. Mechanistically, the inhibition of glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation elicited by simvastatin were associated with the suppression of the insulin receptor (IR)/IR substrate (IRS)/Akt signaling cascade. Simvastatin suppressed the phosphorylation of IR, IRS-1 and Akt, and total expression of IR or IRS-1, but did not affect Akt. Furthermore, simvastatin decreased Rac1 GTP binding. In conclusion, our findings indicate that simvastatin suppresses glucose uptake activity and GLUT4 translocation via IR-dependent IRS-1/PI3K/Akt pathway. These results provide an important new insight into the mechanism of statins on insulin sensitivity which may be associated with new-onset diabetes.", 
    "17": "This study aimed to examine the effects of amlodipine and atorvastatin alone or in combination on the regulation of inflammatory cytokines and the underlying mechanisms in elderly spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rats. The level of serum hs-CRP was detected with ELISA. The serum TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 levels were assessed by radioimmunity assay (RIA). Cardiac inflammatory cell infiltration was observed by HE staining. The protein levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, of NF-\u03baB P65 and I\u03baB\u03b1 were detected by immunoblotting. The intracellular localization of NF-\u03baB p65 was observed using immunohistochemistry. Amlodipine or atorvastatin obviously ameliorated the myocardial inflammatory cell infiltration in SH rats, which was further improved by combinatorial treatment with amlodipine and atorvastatin. Either amlodipine or atorvastatin decreased plasma IL-1\u03b2 content in SH rats, but there was no significant difference when compared with untreated SH rats. However, the combination of amlodipine and atorvastatin significantly decreased plasma IL-1\u03b2 level in SH rats. Moreover, amlodipine or atorvastatin intervention significantly reduced myocardial TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 protein levels in SH rats, which was further suppressed by the combination of amlodipine and atorvastatin. In addition, amlodipine or atorvastatin inhibited the activity of NF-\u03baB signaling in SH rats, which was further suppressed by combinatorial treatment. Furthermore, amlodipine or atorvastatin restored the activity of I\u03baB-\u03b1 in SH rats, which was enhanced by combinatorial treatment. Our results demonstrated amlodipine and atorvastatin improved ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic function possibly through the intervention of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, NF-\u03baB/I\u03baB inflammatory cytokine network. Our study suggests that amlodipine combined with atorvastatin may have additive effect on inhibiting inflammatory response.",

More recent trials on agents with totally different modes of action confirmed this association and indicated a\u00a0causal relationship between lower LDL cholesterol levels and improved cardiovascular outcomes. It has been proposed to term this causal relationship the 'LDL cholesterol principle'. It is to be expected that currently ongoing outcomes trials will further support the assumption of a\u00a0causal relationship and will finally offer an armamentarium to therapists that will enable individualized treatment of dyslipidemias and their sequelae.", 
    "19": "Poor graft function (PGF) is a serious complication after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Murine studies suggest that endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are preferential supporting cells for hematopoietic stem cells in the bone marrow (BM) microenvironment. Our previous work found that a reduced number of BM EPCs was an independent risk factor for the occurrence of PGF after allo-HSCT. However, little is known about the functional role of BM EPCs and how to improve impaired BM EPCs in PGF. In the current study, we evaluated the function of BM EPCs in subjects with PGF postallotransplant. Moreover, we investigated whether atorvastatin could enhance the number and function of BM EPCs derived from subjects with PGF in vitro. Dysfunctional BM EPCs, which were characterized by impaired proliferation, migration, angiogenesis, and higher levels of reactive oxygen species and apoptosis, were revealed in subjects with PGF. Activation of p38 and its downstream transcription factor cyclic adenosine monophosphate-responsive element-binding protein were detected in BM EPCs from subjects with PGF. Furthermore, the number and function of BM EPCs derived from subjects with PGF were enhanced by atorvastatin treatment in vitro through downregulation of the p38 MAPK pathway. In summary, dysfunctional BM EPCs were observed in subjects with PGF. Atorvastatin treatment in vitro quantitatively and functionally improved BM EPCs derived from subjects with PGF through downregulation of the p38 MAPK pathway. These data indicate that atorvastatin represents a promising therapeutic approach for repairing impaired BM EPCs in subjects with PGF postallotransplant.",

Suboptimal activation of immune system by melanoma cells is often due to molecular modifications occurring during tumor progression that prevent efficient recognition of melanoma cells by immune effectors. Statins are HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, which block the mevalonate synthesis pathway, used by millions of people as hypocholesterolemic agents in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. They are also known to inhibit Rho GTPase activation and Rho dependent signaling pathways. Rho GTPases are regarded as molecular switches that regulate a wide spectrum of cellular functions and their dysfunction has been characterized in various oncogenic process notably in melanoma progression. Moreover, these molecules can modulate the immune response. Since 10 years we have demonstrated that Statins and other Rho GTPases inhibitors are critical regulators of molecules involved in adaptive and innate anti-melanoma immune response. In this review we summarize our major observations demonstrating that these pharmacological agents stimulate melanoma immunogenicity and suggest a potential use of these molecules to promote anti-melanoma immune response.",

Here, we show that co-administration of lovastatin and ezetimibe (L/E) significantly reverses hepatic triglyceride accumulation concomitant with an increase in SREBP-2 driven autophagy in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). We further show that the statin mediated increase in SREBP-2 directly activates expression of patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing enzyme 8 (PNPLA8) gene, and PNPLA8 associates with autophagosomes and is associated with a decrease in cellular triglyceride. Moreover, we show that over-expression of PNPLA8 dramatically decreases hepatic steatosis through increased autophagy in hepatocytes of HFD-fed mice. Live-cell imaging analyses also reveal that PNPLA8 dynamically interacts with LC3 and we suggest that the SREBP-2/PNPLA8 axis represents a novel regulatory mechanism for lipid homeostasis. These data provide a possible mechanism for the reported beneficial effects of statins for decreasing hepatic triglyceride levels in NAFLD patients.",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of simvastatin (SIM) and/or HA addition on changes in osteogenesis levels by human DPSCs transferred onto three-dimensional (3D) nanofibrous Poly (\u03b5-caprolactone) (PCL)/Poly lactic acide (PLLA) polymeric scaffolds. Methods: For this purpose, a 3D nanofibrous composite scaffold of PCL/PLLA/HA was prepared by electrospinning method. SIM was added to scaffolds during DPSCs culturing step. Cell proliferation and osteogenic activity levels were assessed by using MTT assay and Alizarin Red assay methods. In addition, the expression of genes responsible for osteogenesis, including BMP2, Osteocalcin, DSPP and RUNX2, were determined before and 2 weeks after incorporation of SIM. Results: The MTT assay showed that PCL/PLLA/HA scaffolds seeded with DPSCs has significant (p<0.05) more proliferative effect than PCL/PLLA or DMEM cultured cells, additionally SIM administration improved this result over the PCL/PLLA/HA scaffolds without SIM treatment. SEM imaging revealed improved adhesion and probably osteogenic differentiation of DPSCs on PCL/PLLA/HA nanofibers treated with SIM, moreover the alizarin red assay ensured significant (p<0.05) higher mineralization of this group. Finally, real time PCR confirmed the positive regulation (P<0.05) of the expression of osteo/odontogenesis markers BMP2, Osteocalcin, DSPP and RUNX2 genes in PLLA-PCL-HA (0.1)-SIM group. Conclusion: As a result, addition of simvastatin with incorporation of hydroxyapatite in PCL-PLLA scaffolds might increase the expression of osteogenesis markers in the DPSCs, with a possible increase in cell differentiation and bone formation.",

However, the extent of food changes needed to achieve these effects is less explored. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of exchanging a few commercially available, regularly consumed key food items (e.g. spread on bread, fat for cooking, cheese, bread and cereals) with improved fat quality on total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and inflammatory markers in a double-blind randomised, controlled trial. In total, 115 moderately hypercholesterolaemic, non-statin-treated adults (25-70 years) were randomly assigned to an experimental diet group (Ex-diet group) or control diet group (C-diet group) for 8 weeks with commercially available food items with different fatty acid composition (replacing SFA with mostly n-6 PUFA). In the Ex-diet group, serum total cholesterol (P<0\u00b7001) and LDL-cholesterol (P<0\u00b7001) were reduced after 8 weeks, compared with the C-diet group. The difference in change between the two groups at the end of the study was -9 and -11 % in total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol, respectively. No difference in change in plasma levels of inflammatory markers (high-sensitive C-reactive protein, IL-6, soluble TNF receptor 1 and interferon-\u03b3) was observed between the groups. In conclusion, exchanging a few regularly consumed food items with improved fat quality reduces total cholesterol, with no negative effect on levels of inflammatory markers.

Changes in campesterol/TC at week 2, relative to baseline between placebo and evolocumab, were all nonsignificant. Evolocumab had a modest effect on markers of cholesterol synthesis. At 2 weeks, changes in desmosterol/TC were 1% for placebo, 7% for evolocumab 140 mg (nonsignificant vs. placebo), and 15% for evolocumab 420 mg (P < 0.01 vs. placebo). Changes from baseline in lathosterol/TC at week 2 between placebo and evolocumab were nonsignificant. These results suggest that evolocumab has a modest effect on cholesterol synthesis and absorption despite significant LDL-C lowering.", 
    "42": "Analytical methods should be selective and fast. In modern times, scientists strive to meet the criteria of green chemistry, so they choose analytical procedures that are as short as possible and use the least toxic solvents. It is quite obvious that the products intended for human consumption should be characterized as completely as possible. The safety of a drug is dependent mainly on the impurities that it contains. High pressure liquid chromatography and ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography have been proposed as the main techniques for forced degradation and impurity profiling. The aim of this article was to characterize the relevant classification of drug impurities and to review the methods of impurities determination for atorvastatin (ATV) and duloxetine (DLX) (both in active pharmaceutical ingredients and in different dosage forms). These drugs have an impact on two systems of the human body: cardiac and nervous. Simple characteristics of ATV and DLX, their properties and specificity of action on the human body, are also included in this review. The analyzed pharmaceuticals-ATV (brand name Lipiron) and DLX (brand name Cymbalta)-were selected for this study based on annual rankings prepared by Information Medical Statistics.",

Within environmental risk factors, some are provoking (e.g., cancer, surgery, trauma or fracture, immobilization, pregnancy and the postpartum period, long-distance travel, hospitalization, catheterization, and acute infection) and others are nonprovoking (e.g., age, sex, race/ethnicity, body mass index and obesity, oral contraceptive or hormone therapy use, corticosteroid use, statin use, diet, physical activity, sedentary time, and air pollution). Additionally, VTE has a strong genetic basis, with approximately 50 to 60% of the variance in VTE incidence attributed to genetic effects. Some genetic susceptibility variants that contribute to risk have been identified in candidate genes, mostly related to the clotting system and responsible for inherited hypercoagulable states (e.g., factor V Leiden, prothrombin, fibrinogen gamma, or blood group non-O). Other susceptibility single-nucleotide polymorphisms have been identified from genome-wide association studies, such as the two new loci in TSPAN15 (rs78707713) and SCL44A2 (rs2288904) genes. Risk factors are not always associated with VTE in isolation; however, and an understanding of how environmental and genetic factors interact may provide insight into the pathophysiology of VTE, possibly identifying opportunities for targeted prevention and treatment.",

    "70": "Of the PAD patients 94% (229/244) were followed for an average of 34.9\u00a0months. Patient cohorts characteristics were: mean age, 66.1\u00a0years, 181 men (74%), claudication (64%), rest pain (16%), ischemic lesions (20%), arterial hypertension (92%), smoking (79%), hyperlipidemia (65%) and type 2 diabetes (43%). Cumulative primary 1- and 3-year graft patency rates were 60.8% and 50.7%, respectively, and cumulative 1- and 3-year limb salvage rates were 89.3% and 86.1%, respectively. One hundred seven bypasses (43.9%) failed, 26 patients (10.7%) required a major and seven patients (2.9%) required a minor amputation. Overall survival rates of PAD patients after 1- and 3-years were 94.4% and 82.9%, respectively. Subjective symptom improvement was found to be the most important prognostic follow-up factor for graft patency and limb salvage. Patients with recurrent symptoms in the follow-up had an increased risk of emerging bypass failure compared with patients with subjective symptom improvement (patency at 1\u00a0year: 40.8% vs 100% and at 3\u00a0years: 26% vs 100%; P\u00a0< .001). No patient with subjective improvement in symptoms during follow-up underwent an amputation (limb salvage at 1\u00a0year: 100% vs 79% and at 3\u00a0years: 100% vs 72.8%; P\u00a0< .001). Therefore, subjective symptom improvement should be the decisive criterion to determine follow-up intervals of PAD patients. In univariate analysis further significant factors associated with better graft patency and limb salvage rates were: claudication compared with critical ischemia, larger graft diameter (>6\u00a0mm), pre- and postoperative antiplatelet therapy, statin therapy independent from lipid values after PAKB revascularization, and an experienced vascular surgeon.",

Furthermore, disease stage of critical ischemia, graft diameter, preoperative aspirin use, and postoperative statin medication were independent predictive factors. Therefore, PAD patients should be treated with aspirin pre- and postoperatively as well as with a statin postoperatively. In case of PAKB reconstruction only prostheses with a large diameter (>6\u00a0mm) should be used and the procedure should be performed by an experienced surgeon. Considering these results with regard to the predictive factors for better graft patency and limb salvage rates a significant more favorable outcome during the follow-up and an increased 5-year patency rate for PAKB reconstructions can be expected.",

Atherosclerotic disease is a predominant cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Statins are among the most commonly prescribed classes of medications, and their prescribing indications and target patient populations have been significantly expanded in the official guidelines recently published by the American and European expert panels. Adverse effects of statin pharmacotherapy, however, result in significant cost and morbidity and can lead to nonadherence and discontinuation of therapy. Statin-associated muscle symptoms occur in ~10% of patients on statins and constitute the most commonly reported adverse effect associated with statin pharmacotherapy. Substantial clinical and nonclinical research effort has been dedicated to determining whether genetics can provide meaningful insight regarding an individual patient's risk of statin adverse effects. This contemporary review of the relevant clinical research on polymorphisms in several key genes that affect statin pharmacokinetics (eg, transporters and metabolizing enzymes), statin efficacy (eg, drug targets and pathways), and end-organ toxicity (eg, myopathy pathways) highlights several promising pharmacogenomic candidates. However, SLCO1B1 521C is currently the only clinically relevant pharmacogenetic test regarding statin toxicity, and its relevance is limited to simvastatin myopathy.", 
    "79": "The objective of this research was to improve the dissolution of simvastatin and to incorporate it in rapid disintegrating tablets (RDTs) with an optimized disintegration and dissolution characteristics. Polyoxyethylene-polypropylene block copolymer (poloxamer 188) was employed as a hydrophilic carrier to prepare simvastatin solid dispersions (SDs). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffractometry were employed to understand the interaction between the drug and the carrier in the solid state. The results obtained from Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy showed absence of any chemical interaction between the drug and poloxamer. The results of differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffractometry confirmed the conversion of simvastatin to distorted crystalline state. The SD of 1:2 w/w drug to carrier ratio showed the highest dissolution; hence, it was incorporated in RDT formulations using a 3(2) full factorial design and response surface methodology. The initial assessments of RDTs demonstrated an acceptable flow, hardness, and friability to indicate good mechanical strength. The interaction and Pareto charts indicated that percentage of croscarmellose sodium incorporated was the most important factor affecting the disintegration time and dissolution parameter followed by the hardness value and their interaction effect. Compression force showed a superior influence to increase RDT's porosity and to fasten disintegration rather than swelling action by croscarmellose sodium. On the other hand, croscarmellose sodium was most important for the initial simvastatin release. The results suggest the potential use of poloxamer 188-based SD in RDT for the oral delivery of poor water-soluble antihyperlipidemic drug, simvastatin.", 
    "80": "Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a unique and deadly disease with unknown drivers. We hypothesized the inflammatory environment contributes to the IBC phenotype. We used an in vitro co-culture system to investigate interactions between normal and polarized macrophages (RAW 264.7 cell line), bone-marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and IBC cells (SUM 149 and MDA-IBC3). We used an in vivo model that reproduces the IBC phenotype by co-injecting IBC cells with MSCs into the mammary fat pad. Mice were then treated with a macrophage recruitment inhibitor, anti-CSF1. MSC and macrophages grown in co-culture produced higher levels of pro-tumor properties such as enhanced migration and elevated IL-6 secretion. IBC cells co-cultured with educated MSCs also displayed enhanced invasion and mammosphere formation and blocked by anti-IL-6 and statin treatment. The treatment of mice co-injected with IBC cells and MSCs with anti-CSF1 inhibited tumor associated macrophages and inhibited pSTAT3 expression in tumor cells. Anti-CSF1 treated mice also exhibited reduced tumor growth, skin invasion, and local recurrence. Herein we demonstrate reciprocal tumor interactions through IL-6 with cells found in the IBC microenvironment. Our results suggest IL-6 is a mediator of these tumor promoting influences and is important for the IBC induced migration of MSCs.",

We measured adherence as proportion of days covered over an 18-month period since initiation and identified different adherence patterns based on monthly adherence with group-based trajectory modeling. When adjusted for age, marital status, residential area, clinical characteristics, and copayment, low SEP was associated with statin nonadherence (proportion of days covered <80%) among men (eg, lowest versus highest income quintile: odds ratio, 1.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.32-1.50; basic versus higher-degree education: odds ratio, 1.18; 95% confidence interval, 1.13-1.24; unemployment versus employment: odds ratio, 1.17; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-1.25). Among women, the corresponding associations were different (P<0.001 for sex-by-income quintile, sex-by-education level, and sex-by-labor market status interactions) and mainly nonsignificant. Results based on adherence trajectories showed that men in low SEP were likely to belong to trajectories presenting a fast decline in adherence.",

The resulting compounds were evaluated for the activity for inducing ROS production. Most compounds exhibited higher activity than original lovastatin. Of these compounds, compound 3c had the most potent activity. Test of cytotoxicity in a panel of human cancer cell lines indicated compound 3c had activities superior to cisplatin in prostate cancer PC-3 cells and breast cancer T47D cells. In contrast, it in amounts up to 40\u03bcM had a much lower cytotoxic effect on normal human IMR-90 cells. Further profiling of cell cycle progression, cell apoptosis, and DNA damage activated checkpoint signaling pathway revealed the important role of compound 3c-mediated cytotoxicity in ROS generation.",

Ezetimibe combined with statins may be considered for high-risk patients who do not achieve optimal low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering on statin monotherapy or who are statin intolerant. Changes in fasting serum glucose (FSG) levels during ezetimibe, ezetimibe/statin, and statin treatments were assessed using data pooled from clinical trials in hypercholesterolemic and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemic patients, who were or were not receiving statin therapy. Study types included first-line trials in statin-naive/wash-out patients and second-line add-on and uptitration studies in patients on stable statin therapy. Similar analyses of FSG changes were performed separately for each study type in patients who were nondiabetic at baseline. Across all study types and treatments, mean FSG increases from baseline were small (0.5 to 3.7\u00a0mg/dl with ezetimibe/statin; 0.2 to 4.6\u00a0mg/dl with statins) and decreased over time; between-treatment differences (0.3 to 1.4\u00a0mg/dl) were nonsignificant for all comparisons. Proportions of patients with elevated FSG \u2265126\u00a0mg/dl during therapy were low and similar for all treatments in the overall cohort (1.2% to 4.3%). Elevations were highest (3.3% to 25.7%) among patients with baseline factors characteristic of metabolic syndrome and prediabetes, including higher FSG, body mass index, and triglyceride levels, and numerically lower baseline high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; however, these factors were not related to FSG increases. Changes in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, body mass index, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B were not significantly correlated with FSG increases. In conclusion, statin therapy was associated with small FSG increases, and the addition of ezetimibe did not further increase FSG levels beyond those of statins when given to patients who are statin naive or those on statin therapy.", 
    "86": "Survival rates in kidney cancer have improved little over time, and diabetes may be an independent risk factor for poor survival in kidney cancer. We sought to determine whether medications with putative anti-neoplastic properties (statins, metformin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)) are associated with survival in diabetics with kidney cancer. We conducted a population-based cohort study utilizing linked healthcare databases in Ontario, Canada. Patients were aged 66 or older with newly diagnosed diabetes and a subsequent diagnosis of incident kidney cancer. Receipt of metformin, statins or NSAIDs was defined using prescription claims. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality and the secondary outcome was cancer-specific mortality. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazard regression, with medication use modeled with time-varying and cumulative exposure analyses to account for intermittent use. During the 14-year study period, we studied 613 patients. Current statin use was associated with a markedly reduced risk of death from any cause (adjusted hazard ratio 0.74; 95% CI 0.59-0.91) and death due to kidney cancer (adjusted hazard ratio 0.71; 95% CI 0.51-0.97). However, survival was not associated with current use of metformin or NSAIDs, or cumulative exposure to any of the medications studied. Among diabetic patients with kidney cancer, survival outcomes are associated with active statin use, rather than total cumulative use. These findings support the use of randomized trials to confirm whether diabetics with kidney cancer should be started on a statin at the time of cancer diagnosis to improve survival outcomes.",

Since its initial conception over a decade ago, the use of cardiovascular polypills has gained increasing momentum as a strategy to lower risk factor levels and prevent CVD. Several new data have emerged including the recent publication of the first outcomes trial using polypills. Areas covered: In this review, the authors summarize the current literature on the safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of polypills for primary and secondary prevention of CVD, describe the current controversies in this field, and identify important areas for future research. The authors searched PubMed, CENTRAL, and ClinicalTrials.gov from inception till 25 June 2016 using the search term 'polypill.' Expert opinion: Cardiovascular polypills containing aspirin, statin, and one or more anti-hypertensive medications, along with lifestyle interventions, represent an attractive, safe, and cost-effective strategy for primary and secondary prevention of CVD. Future research efforts should focus on identifying patients who will benefit the most from the use of polypills, marketing several polypills with different components and doses, and developing novel regulatory strategies for making polypills more readily available in all countries worldwide.", 
    "88": "Statins are remarkably safe and efficient medications that are the mainstay of hypercholesterolemia treatment and have proven to be an invaluable tool to lower the risk of acute cardiovascular events. These compounds are inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMG-R), the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. In spite of their success, they present undesirable side effects and are now loosing patent protection, which provides a great opportunity for the development of new and improved statins. Areas covered: This review summarizes the new patents for HMG-R inhibitors for the 2011-2015 period. Combinations of existing statins with other drugs are also addressed, as well as novel applications of existing statins. Expert opinion: Recent efforts for the discovery of HMG-CoA-R inhibitors has resulted in several new molecules. Most of these are based on commercially available statins, including sterol and terpenoid derivatives. A few peptides have also been patented. However, the origin of the side effects caused by previous statins continues to be, to a large extent, unknown. Although the patents published in the past 5\u00a0years are promising, and might result in new drugs, there is still no way to know if they will present reduced toxicity. Only future clinical trials will answer this question.",

    "90": "Students were assigned to interview five patients with coronary heart disease using a standardised questionnaire focusing on potential interaction of medications with statins. Acceptance and feasibility was assessed by means of a questionnaire survey of teaching physicians (n\u00a0=\u00a020) and students (n\u00a0=\u00a020).", 
    "91": "According to most teaching physicians and students the recruitment of patients during the two-week clerkship was possible, and the practice work flow was not disturbed by the project. Both groups considered the research task on the documentation of potential drug interactions with statins as suitable. According to the teaching physicians the project had a learning effect for the students. In contrast, the students graded their learning effect less highly between 'satisfactory' and 'sufficient'. The overall assessment of the project by the students was on average 'satisfactory' and differed from the assessment by the teaching physicians ('good').",

    "93": "Acute liver damage (ALD) is associated with high-dose intravenous (iv) glucocorticoid (GC) (ivGC) pulse therapy in ~1\u00a0% of patients for Graves' orbitopathy (GO). It has been proposed that statins may increase the risk of ALD. Here we investigated the frequency of ALD according to the assumption of statins in a large retrospective cohort study.", 
    "94": "We studied 1076 consecutive patients with GO given ivGC. ALD was defined as an increase in alanine aminotransferase \u2265300\u00a0U/l.", 
    "95": "At the time of ivGC, 62 patients were taking statins and 1014 were not. The frequency of ALD has been reported to be 1.2 cases/100,000 statins users and 1300/100,000 in GO patients given ivGC. Thus, the expected frequency of ALD in patients given both statins and ivGC is 1560/100,000. Transferring these data to our series, one would have expected at least 0.96 cases of ALD (~one case), in the 62 patients given both ivGC and statins. However, no cases of ALD were observed in patients given statins, and the previously reported 14 cases of ALD in this series were seen in patients who were not taking statins.", 
    "96": "The lack of observation of cases of ALD in patients given ivGC and statins is quite reassuring. Although caution should be applied to any patient candidate to ivGC treatment and this should be particularly accurate in patients given statins, our findings somehow justify the use of ivGC in patients under statins, although further studies in larger cohorts are needed to confirm our conclusions.", 
    "97": "Chagasic cardiomyopathy, which is seen in Chagas disease, is the most severe and life-threatening manifestation of infection by the kinetoplastid Trypanosoma cruzi. Adipose tissue and diet play a major role in maintaining lipid homeostasis and regulating cardiac pathogenesis during the development of Chagas cardiomyopathy. We have previously reported that T. cruzi has a high affinity for lipoproteins and that the invasion rate of this parasite increases in the presence of cholesterol, suggesting that drugs that inhibit cholesterol synthesis, such as statins, could affect infection and the development of Chagasic cardiomyopathy. The dual epidemic of diabetes and obesity in Latin America, the endemic regions for Chagas disease, has led to many patients in the endemic region of infection having hyperlipidemia that is being treated with statins such as atorvastatin. The current study was performed to examine mice fed on either regular or high fat diet for effects of atorvastatin on T. cruzi infection-induced myocarditis and to evaluate the effect of this treatment during infection on adipose tissue physiology and cardiac pathology. Atorvastatin was found to regulate lipolysis and cardiac lipidopathy during acute T. cruzi infection in mice and to enhance tissue parasite load, cardiac LDL levels, inflammation, and mortality in during acute infection. Overall, these data suggest that statins, such as atorvastatin, have deleterious effects during acute Chagas disease.", 
    "98": "Diabetes mellitus is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. However, the excess risk of death may vary substantially in subgroups of patients with type 2 diabetes, being highest in those younger than 55\u00a0years of age. A HbA1c value of 7.0\u00a0% or less is recommended for most patients with type 2 diabetes to reduce the incidence of microvascular disease, although individualized approaches that balance the benefits of glycemic control against the harms of hypoglycemia are encouraged. The selection of antidiabetic medications is of paramount importance, as the drug should not aggravate, and ideally even improve cardiovascular risk factors, with the hope to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Patients with diabetes mellitus between 40 and 75\u00a0years of age with LDL-C between 70 and 189\u00a0mg/dL should be treated with a moderate-intensity statin. Implicit in this recommendation is the aim to reduce further LDL-C level in diabetes, in order to improve the cardiovascular outlook. The new PCSK9 inhibitors (evolocumab and arilocumab) are very promising, but, at present, their cost-effectiveness ratios exceed commonly accepted thresholds. For many people with diabetes mellitus and hypertension blood pressure should be <140/90\u00a0mmHg, although lower systolic targets (e.g., <130\u00a0mmHg) may be appropriate for certain individuals. With the likely exception of LDL-C, it is difficult to define a universal HbA1c and blood pressure target for all patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Ultimately, in the face of uncertainty in medicine, the final decision regarding a specific patient is best left to the clinician.",

End points were restenosis \u226550% and \u226570%, contralateral carotid disease progression (50%-69%, 70%-99%, or occlusion) and stroke. Survival analysis and Cox regression models were used to assess the effect of baseline predictors.",

The combined stroke/death rate was 2.6% overall and 1.8% in the asymptomatic cohort. The rate of restenosis \u226550% at 2, 5, and 10\u00a0years was 8.5%, 15.6%, 27.2%, and the rate for restenosis \u226570% was 3.4%, 6.5%, 10.2%, respectively. Restenosis \u226550% was predicted by hypertension (hazard ratio [HR], 2.09; P\u00a0= .027), female gender (HR, 1.43; P\u00a0= .042), and younger age (\u226465\u00a0years; HR, 1.56; P\u00a0= .016), but not by statins, surgical technique, symptoms, or other baseline risk factors. Restenoses remained asymptomatic in 125 of 148 (84.5%). Progression of contralateral ICA disease at 2, 5, and 10\u00a0years was estimated at 5.4%, 15.5%, and 46.8%, respectively. Contralateral progression was only predicted by smoking (HR, 1.74; P\u00a0=\u00a0.008). The stroke rate in patients with disease progression of the contralateral ICA was not different compared with those without progression (7.0% vs 3.3%; P\u00a0= .063). Any-stroke rates at 2, 5, and 10\u00a0years were 4.6%, 7.3%, and 15.7%, respectively.

The obese patients with type 2 diabetes were the least likely to reach the target (3.0%).

There were no significant differences in the reporting of ED or sleep disturbance among users and non-users. There were too few cases of cognitive impairment to warrant analysis.

    "111": "Cardiovascular disease burden is increasing all over the world. The diagnosis of hypertension is considered when a person has persistently elevated BP (Systolic BP more than 140 mmHg and/or Diastolic BP more than 90 mmHg). Dyslipidemia denotes abnormal levels of lipids in the blood (Total Cholesterol >200 mg%, Low density lipoprotein (LDL) >100 mg%, Triglycerides (TGL) >150 mg% and High density lipoprotein (HDL) <40\u200amg in men and < 50\u200amg in women. Hypertension and Dyslipidemia constitute the important components of metabolic syndrome as per the definition of NCEP Guidelines-Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III). The prevalence of the co-existence of hypertension and dyslipidemia is in the range of 15-31%. The co-existence of these two risk factors has more than the additive effect for endothelial dysfunction resulting in enhanced atherosclerosis leading to CVD. The term dyslipidemic hypertension (DH) was used in the context of familial DH. Non-familial forms of DH are more common than familial form. Some authors name this combination as Lipitension for easy understanding. Framingham Heart study shows that the majority of hypertension population have more than one risk factor predominantly atherogenic in nature. Dyslipidemia causes endothelial damage and loss of vasomotor activity. The damage may manifest as elevated BP. MRFIT study reveals that mild to moderate elevation of BP and Dyslipidemia can lead to multiplicative adverse impact on CVD. Framingham study results also reveal that moderately elevated BP and cholesterol had a similar risk.RAAS promotes atherogenesis. Angiotensin II promotes atherogenesis through stimulation AT1 receptor, which increases lipid uptake in cells, vasoconstriction and free radical production to foster both hypertension and atherosclerosis. Hypertension damages vascular endothelium through altered shear stress and oxidative stress resulting in increased synthesis of collagen and fibronectin, reduced nitric oxide-dependent vascular relaxation and increased permeability to lipoproteins. Hypertension is also associated with up regulation of lipid oxidation enzymes. Hypertension is clearly associated with vascular endothelium (prothrombotic and pro inflammatory). Oxidative stress and vascular inflammation are increased in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Reduction of both results in the reversal of vascular inflammation.LDL is a major cause of endothelial dysfunction. Microalbuminuria is identified in hypertensive patients and it is also associated with lipid abnormalities including high levels of LDL and TGL, low levels of HDL and elevated levels of LP(a). Today CVD prevention is focussed on treating hypertension with the lowering LDL (<100 mg%),increasing HDL (>40\u200amg in men) and lowering TGL(<150 mg%). In ALLHAT trial, 10,000 patients were given pravastatin 40\u200amg daily. At the end of 5 years, only 16.7% reduction in LDL was noted. In ASCOT-LLA trial, intensive therapy lipid lowering was recommended along with Antihypertensive therapy. ACEIs, ARBs, Aldosterone antagonists and Nebivolol improve endothelial function and reduce BP. Statin treatment happens to be as a first line drug therapy in the management of dyslipidemia. Fibrates are generally reserved for Hypertriglyceridemia. Bile sequestrants, Nicotinic acid and drug like Ezetimibe locally acting at the intestine level are also used for dyslipidemia. Single pill combination like Atorvastatin with RASS blocker/Amlodipine may be considered the coexisting hypertension and dyslipidemia.",

Degradation products were obtained by acidic hydrolysis of the two drugs and their structures were elucidated for the first time by IR and MS spectra. Degradation products did not interfere with the determination of either drug and the assays were therefore stability-indicating. The linearity of the proposed methods was established over the ranges 1-50 \u03bcg mL-1 for AML and ATV in the HPLC method and in the range of 3-50 and 4-50 \u03bcg mL-1 for AML and ATV, respectively, in the CE method.

    "153": "Niacin was the first hypolipidemic drug to significantly reduce both major cardiovascular events and mortality in patients with cardiovascular disease. Niacin favorably influences all lipoprotein classes, including lipoprotein[a],and belongs to the most potent hypolipidemic drugs for increasing HDL-C. Moreover, niacin causes favorable changes to the qualitative composition of lipoprotein HDL. In addition to its pronounced hypolipidemic action, niacin exerts many other, non-hypolipidemic effects (e.g., antioxidative, anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic), which favorably influence the development and progression of atherosclerosis. These effects are dependent on activation of the specific receptor HCA2. Recent results published by the two large clinical studies, AIM-HIGH and HPS2-THRIVE, have led to the impugnation of niacin's role in future clinical practice. However, due to several methodological flaws in the AIM-HIGH and HPS2-THRIVE studies, the pleiotropic effects of niacin now deserve thorough evaluation. This review summarizes the present and possible future use of niacin in clinical practice in light of its newly recognized pleiotropic effects.",

We sought to elicit information germane to natural history and characteristics of central nervous system/behavioral changes in apparent connection with statin and/or cholesterol-lowering drug use, and delineate mechanisms that may bear on an association. Participants (and/or proxies) self-referred with behavioral and/or mood changes in apparent association with statins completed a survey eliciting cholesterol-lowering drug history, character and impact of behavioral/mood effect, time-course of onset and recovery in relation to drug use/modification, co-occurrence of recognized statin-associated ADRs, and factors relevant to ADR causality determination. Naranjo presumptive ADR causality criteria were assessed. Participants (n\u00a0=\u00a012) reported mood/behavior change that commenced following statin initiation and persisted or progressed with continued use. Reported problems included violent ideation, irritability, depression, and suicide. Problems resolved with drug discontinuation and recurred with rechallenge where attempted. Eight met presumptive criteria for \"probable\" or \"definite\" causality; others had additional factors not considered in Naranjo criteria that bear on casual likelihood. (1) Simvastatin 80\u00a0mg was followed in 5\u00a0days by irritability/depression culminating in suicide in a man in his 40s (Naranjo criteria: possible causality). (2) Simvastatin 10\u00a0mg was followed within 2\u00a0weeks by depression in a woman in her 50s (probable causality). (3) Atorvastatin 20\u00a0mg was followed in ~1 month by depression and irritability/aggression in a male in his 50s (probable causality). (4) Atorvastatin 10\u00a0mg was followed in several months by aggression/irritability and depression culminating in suicide in a man in his 40s (possible causality). (5) Fenofibrate\u00a0+\u00a0rosuvastatin (unknown dose), later combined with atorvastatin were followed in 1\u00a0month by aggression/irritability in a male in his 30s (probable causality). (6) Lovastatin (unknown dose and time-course to reaction) was followed by depression, dyscontrol of bipolar disorder, and suicide attempts in a male in his 40s (possible causality). (7) Atorvastatin 20\u00a0mg was followed within 2\u00a0weeks by cognitive compromise, and nightmares, depression, and anxiety culminating in suicide in a man in his teens (definite causality). (8) Simvastatin 10\u00a0mg was followed (time-course not recalled) by depression, aggression/irritability culminating in suicide in a man in his 60s (possible causality). (9) Simvastatin 20\u00a0mg then atorvastatin 10\u00a0mg were followed (time-course not provided) by irritability/aggression in a man in his 60s (definite causality). (10) Atorvastatin 10 then 20 then 40\u00a0mg were followed shortly after the dose increase by violent ideation and anxiety in a man in his 30s (probable causality). (11) Atorvastatin 20\u00a0mg and then simvastatin 20\u00a0mg were followed in 2\u00a0weeks by aggression/irritability in a man in his 50s (definite causality). (12) Lovastatin, rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, and simvastatin at varying doses were followed as quickly as 1\u00a0day by aggression, irritability, and violent ideation in a man in his 40s (definite causality). Most had risk factors for statin ADRs, and co-occurrence of other, recognized statin ADRs. ADRs had implications for marriages, careers, and safety of self and others.

The new cholesterol guidelines by the ACC/AHA have reignited the emphasis on more intensive treatment with statins in the population at high risk of CVD, including those with diabetes. While these guidelines do not include specific lipid goals, several other guidelines have retained previously defined risk-based LDL-C and non-HDL-C goals. More recent data indicate potential benefits in CVD outcomes with non-statin therapy added to statin therapy. On-going long-term trials with PCSK-9 inhibitors may help answer the question of the benefits and safety of very low LDL-C. Regarding the blood pressure guidelines, there remains an inconsistency of evidence for targets to reduce CVD outcomes. The ACCORD trial weighted heavily in the recent meta-analyses, leading to currently recommended goal of <140/90\u00a0mmHg. Studies targeting blood pressure goals of <130\u00a0mmHg in younger patients with diabetes, including sub-populations of interest, may help solve the controversy. Until we have these data, perhaps it is time to shift our focus from a rigid blood pressure target to risk-based goals.",

Chemotherapeutic interventions of gliomas have poor prognostic outcomes due to drug resistance and drug toxicity. Here, we examined the in vitro growth kinetics of C6 glioma (C6G) cells and primary astrocytes and their responses to 2 phase-specific inhibitors, lovastatin and hydroxyurea. C6G cells demonstrated a shorter G1 phase and an earlier peak of DNA synthesis in S phase than primary astrocytes. As C6G cells and primary astrocytes re-entered the cell cycle in the presence of lovastatin or hydroxyurea, they exhibited different sensitivities to the inhibitory effects of these agents, as measured by [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation. Compared to primary astrocytes, C6G cells were more sensitive to lovastatin, but less sensitive to hydroxyurea. Studies using 2 different paradigms of exposure uncovered dramatic differences in the kinetics of DNA synthesis inhibition by these 2 agents in C6G cells and primary astrocytes. One notable difference was the ability of C6G cells to more easily recover from the inhibitory effects of hydroxyurea following short exposure. Our results provide insight into C6 glioma drug resistance as well as the inhibitory effects of these 2 phase-specific inhibitors and their chemotherapeutic potential.",

The main aim of this study was to deliver atorvastatin directly to the liver by using same conjugate and reduce the associated side-effects, i.e. hepatotoxicity at high dose. Characterization of the developed formulation was performed by differential scanning calorimetry, particle size measurements and cellular uptake studies. Release profile, pharmacokinetics studies and organ distribution studies showed that developed formulation shows a relative higher liver uptake.

We describe decade-long trends in the discharge prescribing of aspirin, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, \u03b2 blockers, and statins in hospital survivors of AMI. The study population consisted of 5,253 patients who were discharged from all 11\u00a0hospitals in central Massachusetts after AMI in 6 biennial periods from 2001 to 2011. Combination medical therapy (CMT) was defined as the prescription of all 4 cardiac medications at hospital discharge. The average age of this patient population was 69.2\u00a0years and 57.7% were men. Significant increases were observed in the use of CMT, from 25.6% in 2001 to 48.7% in 2011, with increases noted for each of the individual cardiac medications examined. Subgroup analysis also showed improvement in discharge prescriptions for P2Y12 inhibitors in patients who underwent a percutaneous coronary intervention. Presence of a do-not-resuscitate order, before co-morbidities, hospitalization for non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, admission to a nonteaching hospital, and failure to undergo cardiac catheterization or a percutaneous coronary intervention were associated with underuse of CMT. In conclusion, our study demonstrates encouraging trends in the prescribing of evidence-based medications at hospital discharge for AMI. However, certain patient subgroups continue to be at risk for underuse of CMT, suggesting the need for strategies to enhance compliance with current practice guidelines.",

According to the multivariate analysis, ACEIs/ARBs (hazard ratio [HR] 0.58, 95\u00a0% confidence interval [CI] 0.36-1.94; p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) and statins (HR 0.37, 95\u00a0% CI 0.23-0.61; p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) reduced the risk of MACE, while the effects of BBs (HR 0.85, 95\u00a0% CI 0.55-1.32; p\u00a0=\u00a00.48) and PPIs (HR 1.33, 95\u00a0% CI 0.83-2.12; p\u00a0=\u00a00.23) were not significant. OMT was prescribed at discharge in 300 (32.4\u00a0%) patients; after propensity score analysis, OMT showed a significant reduction in death (3\u00a0% vs. 12.5\u00a0%, HR 0.21, 95\u00a0% CI 0.1-0.4; log-rank p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and MACE (6.7 vs. 15.2\u00a0%, log-rank p\u00a0=\u00a00.01).", 
    "189": "In patients with ACS and malignancy, OMT reduces the risk of adverse events at 1\u00a0year; in particular, ACEIs/ARBs and statins were the most protective drugs. (Clinical trials identifier:\u00a0NCT02466854).", 
    "190": "Serum c-reactive protein (CRP) was suggested for the assessment of intermediate cardiovascular (CV) risk. Here, systemic or intraplaque CRP levels were investigated as predictors of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) in patients with severe carotid stenosis. CRP levels were assessed in the serum and within different portions (upstream and downstream) of carotid plaques of 217 patients undergoing endarterectomy. The association between CRP and intraplaque lipids, collagen, neutrophils, smooth muscle cells (SMC), and macrophage subsets was determined. No correlation between serum CRP and intraplaque biomarkers was observed. In upstream portions, CRP content was directly correlated with intraplaque neutrophils, total macrophages, and M1 macrophages and inversely correlated with SMC content. In downstream portions, intraplaque CRP correlated with M1 and M2 macrophages. According to the cut-off point (CRP > 2.9%) identified by ROC analysis in upstream portions, Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with high CRP levels had a greater rate of MACEs. This risk of MACEs increased independently of age, male gender, serum CRP, and statin use. In conclusion, in patients with severe carotid artery stenosis, high CRP levels within upstream portions of carotid plaques directly and positively correlate with intraplaque inflammatory cells and predict MACEs at an 18-month follow-up period.", 
    "191": "Publicly-funded atorvastatin required prior approval until September 2010 whereas simvastatin did not. Our aim was to examine if overall statin dispensing and atorvastatin dispensing among patients hospitalised for cardiovascular disease (CVD) differed systematically across sociodemographic groups during and after special authority criteria.", 
    "192": "National medication dispensing data were anonymously linked to patients hospitalised across New Zealand with CVD and discharged between 1/07/2009-31/12/2009 when special authority criteria applied and 1/09/2010-28/02/2011 after restrictions ceased. Statin dispensing at least once within six months post-discharge was analysed by sociodemographic characteristics.", 
    "193": "Overall statin use was the same (80%) among patients discharged during (n=14,094) and after (n=13,274) restrictions. With restrictions, atorvastatin dispensing was 32-33% less frequent among statin-users <45 years and >75 years than 65-74 year olds and 28-55% less among M\u0101ori, Pacific and Indian peoples than all others. Minimal relative differences occurred by sex or deprivation status. After restrictions were lifted, the proportion of statin-users dispensed atorvastatin increased around two-fold or more across all sociodemographic strata with three-four fold increases for patients >55 years and for M\u0101ori, Pacific and Indian peoples.",

    "195": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVD's) are the major cause of morbidity and mortality in both developed and developing countries. Many clinical trials have demonstrated that low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering, reduces the incidence of coronary and cerebrovascular events across a broad spectrum of patients at risk. Guidelines for the management of patients at risk have been established in Europe and North America. The guidelines have advocated progressively lower LDL-C targets and more aggressive use of statin therapy. In Indian patients, comprehensive data on dyslipidemia management and its treatment outcomes are inadequate. There is lack of information on existing treatment patterns, the patient's profile being treated, and factors that determine treatment success or failure in achieving desired goals.", 
    "196": "The present study was planned to determine the lipid control status in high-risk dyslipidemic patients treated with lipid-lowering therapy in India.", 
    "197": "This cross-sectional, non-interventional, single visit program was conducted across 483 sites in India where male and female patients with high-risk dyslipidemia aged 18 to 65 years who had visited for a routine health check-up to their respective physician at hospital or a healthcare center. Percentage of high-risk dyslipidemic patients achieving adequate LDL-C level (< 70 mg/dL) on lipid-lowering therapy and the association of lipid parameters with patient characteristics, comorbid conditions, and lipid lowering drugs were analysed.", 
    "198": "3089 patients were enrolled in the study; of which 64% were males. LDL-C data was available for 95.2% of the patients; only 7.7% of these patients achieved LDL-C levels < 70 mg/dL on lipid-lowering therapy, which may be due to inability to follow therapeutic plans, poor compliance, or inadequate counselling by physician. The physician's lack of awareness about recent treatment guidelines also might contribute to patients' poor adherence, not explaining adequately the benefit and risks of a medication, not giving consideration to the patient's life style and the cost of medication. Statin was the most commonly used anti-dyslipidemic drug across population. The higher proportion of patients had the comorbid condition of CVD and diabetes mellitus across all dyslipidemic patients.", 
    "199": "As per the European Society of Cardiology guidelines the ideal LDL-C levels in high risk dyslipidemic patients should be less than 70 mg/dL. In the present study, 7.7% of the patients achieved LDL-C levels < 70 mg/dL on lipid lowering therapy which is very less. Most of high risk dyslipidemic patients in India are on suboptimal dosage of statin. So more aggressive and high dosage statin therapy may be required to achieve target LDLC levels in high risk Indian dyslipidemic patients.", 
    "200": "Diabetes and obesity are associated with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis and an increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). TAZ and YAP are equivalently placed downstream effectors of the Hippo pathway with oncogenic roles in human cancers. Statins are commonly used to patients with metabolic problems as hypercholesterolemia. Statins also have anti-cancer properties, and the cross-talk between mevalonate pathway and Hippo pathway was known. The aim of this study is to confirm the statin's anti-cancer effects on HCC cells and its survival benefits in HCC patients with curative surgery. TAZ expression level in HCC cell lines was analyzed by western blot. Two cell lines (HLF and HuH1) were used in this study. Then the mechanism of statin's anti-proliferative effect was examined in HLF and HuH1 cells. In clinical setting, overall survival and recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate were examined in comparison between statin intake and statin non-intake group. The proliferation assay using four different statins (atorvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin). Simvastatin and fluvastatin showed very strong growth suppressive effects, and induced apoptosis in HLF cells, but not HuH1 cells. TAZ expression was suppressed in HLF cells by fluvastatin and simvastatin treatment. The similar change pattern was confirmed in p-ERK1/2 and ERK. In HuH1 cells, such expression change was not confirmed. In clinical setting, statin intake was significantly associated with longer RFS in the HCC patients with hepatectomy (P\u00a0=\u00a00.038). The statin had the anti-proliferative effects and induced apoptosis in HCC cells and improved the prognosis of HCC patients.", 
    "201": "Statins are generally well tolerated, but treatment with these drugs may be associated with myopathy. The mechanisms of statin-associated myopathy are not completely understood. Statins inhibit AKT phosphorylation by an unclear mechanism, whereas insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) activates the IGF-1/AKT signaling pathway and promotes muscle growth. The aims of the study were to investigate mechanisms of impaired AKT phosphorylation by simvastatin and to assess effects of IGF-1 on simvastatin-induced myotoxicity in C2C12 myotubes. C2C12 mouse myotubes were exposed to 10\u00a0\u03bcM simvastatin and/or 10\u00a0ng/mL IGF-1 for 18\u00a0h. Simvastatin inhibited the IGF-1/AKT signaling pathway, resulting in increased breakdown of myofibrillar proteins, impaired protein synthesis and increased apoptosis. Simvastatin inhibited AKT S473 phosphorylation, indicating reduced activity of mTORC2. In addition, simvastatin impaired stimulation of AKT T308 phosphorylation by IGF-1, indicating reduced activation of the IGF-1R/PI3K pathway by IGF-1. Nevertheless, simvastatin-induced myotoxicity could be at least partially prevented by IGF-1. The protective effects of IGF-1 were mediated by activation of the IGF-1R/AKT signaling cascade. Treatment with IGF-1 also suppressed muscle atrophy markers, restored protein synthesis and inhibited apoptosis. These results were confirmed by normalization of myotube morphology and protein content of C2C12 cells exposed to simvastatin and treated with IGF-1. In conclusion, impaired activity of AKT can be explained by reduced function of mTORC2 and of the IGF-1R/PI3K pathway. IGF-1 can prevent simvastatin-associated cytotoxicity and metabolic effects on C2C12 cells. The study gives insight into mechanisms of simvastatin-associated myotoxicity and provides potential targets for therapeutic intervention.",

Reduced PAC is seen in patients with psychiatric diagnoses and has been associated with increased risk for stroke, myocardial infarction, and mortality. The objective of this pilot study was to identify predictors of reduced PAC in subjects with psychiatric diagnoses.",

Fifty participants were being treated with an antipsychotic medication, while the remaining 27 were off of antipsychotics for at least 2 months. Our model explained 27% of the variance in calf compliance. Black subjects had reduced calf compliance compared to white subjects (P = .02). Having metabolic syndrome was associated with reduced PAC at a trend level (P < .08), and BMI (P = .004) and BMI(2) (P = .011) were significant predictors of calf compliance. Schizophrenia versus other psychiatric diagnoses and antipsychotic treatment were not significantly associated with calf compliance.", 
    "205": "In this pilot study, significant predictors of calf compliance were race (black vs white) and BMI. PAC is a noninvasive measure that may be a predictor of cardiovascular risk in psychiatric patients. The reduced PAC seen in patients with psychiatric diagnoses does not appear to be directly related to their diagnosis or antipsychotic treatment but rather to other characteristics inherent to the subject. Future studies are warranted to better understand the pathophysiology of PAC including but not limited to inflammation in psychiatric patients.",

Similar results have been reported in studies conducted in Japan. However, the dose of statins and the degree of LDL-C reduction achieved with statins are different between Asian and Western patients. In addition, there are limited data regarding racial differences in response to statins. In this review, racial differences between Asians and Westerners in response to statins are described.",

    "215": "We previously reported that simvastatin, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, inhibits atherosclerosis in rats. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of simvastatin on mouse peritoneal macrophage foam cell formation, the early feature of atherosclerosis, and explore its mechanisms. The results showed that simvastatin decreased cholesterol content and DiI-oxLDL (1,1'-didodecyl 3,3,3',3'-indocarbocyanine perchlorate - oxidized low-density lipoprotein) uptake, reduced the levels of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in the medium, down-regulated the mRNA and protein expression of CD36 (a fatty acid receptor), and reduced the mRNA expressions of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3), TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6 in macrophages treated with oxLDL. However, PPAR\u03b3 agonist troglitazone partly abolished the effects of simvastatin on foam cells. In addition, simvastatin reduced the protein expression of calpain-1, a Ca(2+)-sensitive cysteine protease, in oxLDL-treated macrophages. Furthermore, PD150606, a specific calpain inhibitor, reduced mRNA expressions of PPAR\u03b3 and CD36 in macrophages treated with oxLDL. Combination of simvastatin and PD150606 had no further effect on mRNA expression of PPAR\u03b3 and CD36 compared with either alone. However, over-expression of calpain-1 in macrophages partly reversed the simvastatin effects, including cell cholesterol content, mRNA expressions of PPAR\u03b3, and CD36. The results suggested that simvastatin inhibits foam cell formation of oxLDL-treated macrophages through a calpain-1-PPAR\u03b3-CD36 pathway.",

Epidemiologic studies have shown a strong correlation between serum lipid levels and risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Multifactorial intervention strategies aimed at controlling lipids, blood pressure, and blood glucose simultaneously achieve maximal reductions in cardiovascular risk. Dyslipidemia and metabolic abnormalities are strongly associated with atherosclerosis and worse cardiovascular outcomes. While pharmacotherapy with statins has been proven to be beneficial for dyslipidemia, lifestyle modification emphasizing weight loss and regular exercise is an essential component of the interventional strategy. The common thread underlying atherosclerosis and metabolic abnormalities is endothelial dysfunction. Improved understanding of the role of endothelium in health and disease can potentially lead to novel therapies that may preempt development of atherosclerosis and its complications.",

Overall, 3,340 patients received alirocumab (4,029 patient-years' exposure), 1,276 received placebo, and 618 received ezetimibe. Incidence of deaths, serious TEAEs, discontinuations because of TEAEs, and overall TEAEs were similar between alirocumab and control groups. Alirocumab was associated with a higher incidence of local injection site reactions (7.4% vs 5.3% with placebo; 3.1% vs 2.3% with ezetimibe), pruritus (1.3% vs 0.4% placebo; 0.9% vs 0.5% ezetimibe), and upper respiratory tract infection signs and symptoms (2.1% vs 1.1% placebo; 1.3% vs 0.8% ezetimibe). Incidence of musculoskeletal, neurologic, neurocognitive, ophthalmologic, hepatic events, and TEAEs related to diabetes/diabetes complications was similar between alirocumab and control groups. In a prespecified analysis of phase 3 studies, adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular events (coronary heart disease death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and unstable angina requiring hospitalization) occurred in 1.8% alirocumab versus 2.6% placebo patients (hazard ratio 0.69, 95% confidence interval 0.43 to 1.11) and 2.8% alirocumab versus 1.5% ezetimibe patients (hazard ratio 1.4, 95% confidence interval 0.65 to 3.02).
