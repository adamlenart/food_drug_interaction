Pharmacokinetic parameters of losartan and EXP-3174 in rats were determined after oral and intravenous administration of losartan (9 mg/kg) without and with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (1 mg/kg). The effect of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on P-gp and cytochrome (CYP) 3A4 activity were also evaluated. Atorvastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin inhibited CYP3A4 activities with IC\u2085\u2080 values of 48.0, 14.1 and 3.10 \u03bcmol/l, respectively. Simvastatin (1-10 \u03bcmol/l) enhanced the cellular uptake of rhodamine-123 in a concentration-dependent manner. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC\u2080\u208b\u221e) and the peak plasma concentration of losartan were significantly (p < 0.05) increased by 59.6 and 45.8%, respectively, by simvastatin compared to those of control. The total body clearance (CL/F) of losartan after oral administration with simvastatin was significantly decreased (by 34.8%) compared to that of controls. Consequently, the absolute bioavailability (F) of losartan after oral administration with simvastatin was significantly increased by 59.4% compared to that of control. The metabolite-parent AUC ratio was significantly decreased by 25.7%, suggesting that metabolism of losartan was inhibited by simvastatin. In conclusion, the enhanced bioavailability of losartan might be mainly due to inhibition of P-gp in the small intestine and CYP3A subfamily-mediated metabolism of losartan in the small intestine and/or liver and to reduction of the CL/F of losartan by simvastatin.", 
    "1": "With wide availability of low-cost generics, primary prevention with statins has become less expensive. We projected the cost-effectiveness of expanded statin prescribing strategies using low-cost generics and identified conditions under which aggressive prescribing ceases to be cost-effective.", 
    "2": "We simulated expanded statin prescribing strategies with the coronary heart disease policy model, a Markov model of the US population >35 years of age. If statins cost $4/mo, treatment thresholds of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol >160 mg/dL for low-risk persons (0 to 1 risk factor), >130 mg/dL for moderate-risk persons (\u22652 risk factors and 10-year risk <10%), and >100 mg/dL for moderately high-risk persons (\u22652 risk factors and 10-year risk >10%) would reduce annual healthcare costs by $430 million compared with Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines. Lowering thresholds to >130 mg/dL for persons with 0 risk factors and >100 mg/dL for persons with 1 risk factor and treating all moderate- and moderately high-risk persons regardless of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol would provide additional health benefits for $9900 per quality-adjusted life-year. These findings are insensitive to most adverse effect assumptions (including statin-associated diabetes mellitus and severe hypothetical effects) but are sensitive to large reductions in the efficacy of statins or to a long-term disutility burden for which a patient would trade 30 to 80 days of life to avoid 30 years of statins.", 
    "3": "Low-cost statins are cost-effective for most persons with even modestly elevated cholesterol or any coronary heart disease risk factors if they do not mind taking a pill daily.

Other lipid-modifying drugs have been less successful in reducing the incidence of stroke, but because of evidence for the use of triglyceride-lowering drugs and treatments that raise concentrations of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, further investigations are needed, particularly in patients with an atherogenic dyslipidemia profile (high triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol levels). Furthermore, beyond reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and possibly improving other lipids fractions in patients who are at high risk of stroke, the present review shoes that lipid-modifying drugs might have neuroprotective effects that should also be further explored.", 
    "5": "Epidemiological studies have clearly shown a direct relationship between the levels of blood pressure, glycaemia and LDL-cholesterol, and the complications of diabetes. Although 'lower should be better', the results of recent clinical trials examining the benefits of normalizing risk factor levels have been counter-intuitive and, at times, disturbing, and have called into question this notion. This review focuses on patients with type 2 diabetes who make up 90% of patients with diabetes. It aims to provide a clear summary and interpretation of recent trials to help clinicians to set targets for cardiovascular risk factors in individual patients. It highlights areas of agreement and disagreement between current guidelines. Recent data indicate that some patient subgroups might respond differently to aggressive risk factor management. Our challenge is how to identify these patients and deliver truly personalized diabetes care that maximizes benefit, and minimizes harm. Guidelines and position statements stress the value of setting personalized targets. We explore what this means, and how this might be achieved in practice by outlining some solutions to issues that currently limit the delivery of personalized care. We call for further research assessing the overall clinical impact of cardiovascular risk factor intervention by finding appropriate ways of combining data on mortality, complications, side-effects, quality of life, and cost-effectiveness.",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate bone mineral density (BMD) and bone turnover changes induced by 3-year fluvastatin treatment in postmenopausal women. Twenty-eight consecutive postmenopausal non-diabetic, normotensive hypercholesterolemic women (64.0\u00b13.6 years) were treated for 36 months with 30 mg/day fluvastatin and 28 non-diabetic, normotensive normocholesterolemic age- and body mass index-matched postmenopausal women served as the control subjects. The result revealed a significant increase of the BMD as compared with the level at the base line (p< 0.001) in the fluvastairn-treated group, from 6 months on ward after the start treatment. Significant differences of the BMD were found between the controls and fluvastatin-treated group (p< 0.001) were at 6, 12, 24 and 36 months after the start of the study. In conclusion our results, although obtained small sample of postmenopausal hypercholesterolemic women, suggest a probable favorable effect of fluvastatin on bone formation and BMD.", 
    "28": "Low concentrations of bilirubin are associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Possibly, bilirubin exerts its effect through the protection of LDL from oxidation. Therefore, we examined whether low bilirubin might also be a risk marker for CVD in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and whether statins influence serum bilirubin levels. Patients with FH were recruited from 37 lipid clinics. After a washout period of 6 weeks, all patients were started on monotherapy with simvastatin 80 mg for a period of two years. A total of 514 patients were enrolled. Bilirubin at baseline was inversely associated with the presence of CVD, also after adjustment for age, gender, presence of hypertension, and HDL cholesterol levels. Moreover, bilirubin levels were significantly raised, by 7%, from 10.0 to 10.8 \u03bcmol/L after treatment with simvastatin 80 mg. We hypothesize first that high bilirubin levels might protect patients with FH from CVD. Furthermore, bilirubin levels were significantly increased after treatment with simvastatin 80 mg, independent of changes in liver enzymes, which might confer additional protection against CVD. Whether this is also true for lower doses of simvastatin or for other statins remains to be investigated.", 
    "29": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, also known as statins, are a drug class that reduce the level of cholesterol in the blood. As a result, statins are used to suppress the progression of cardiovascular disease. Evidence points to another component of statins involving the non-lipid effects of the drug class in preventing cardiovascular disease. One specific mediator of this action is the transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) superfamily. The TGF-\u03b2 superfamily consists of proteins that include TGF-\u03b2 and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). These proteins regulate cellular pathways to mediate effects including immunomodulation, cell cycling, and angiogenesis. One pathway that mediates these effects is Ras. Moreover, within this pathway, different functions are possible depending on the activation of the specific receptor subtype. This review discusses the recent development of the non-lipid effects of statins in preventing cardiovascular disease progression by regulating Ras pathway of the TGF-\u03b2 superfamily, especially RhoA/ROCK pathway.", 
    "30": "A systematic PubMed database search of all English-language articles up to 2011 was conducted using the following terms: statin, TGF-\u03b2, Ras, ROCK, GGPP, inducible nitric oxide synthase, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, actin filament formation, PPAR\u03b3, MMP-2, and human trials.", 
    "31": "With better understanding of the pathway, various mediators were identified; some of these mediators are important biomarkers producing more specific and accurate assessment of the pleiotropic effects of statins. The review of human trials also highlights that more specific biomarkers are employed in recent studies, and the non-lipid effects on human subjects are more accurately documented. Confirmation of the accuracy of these biomarkers by further large-scale studies and further development of new biomarkers may prove an important path leading to better patient selection for treatment, and thus better cost-effectiveness may be achieved.", 
    "32": "Statins, belonging to a well-known drug class used for lowering cholesterol through competitive inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, also have other pleiotropic properties, such as anti-inflammatory action. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects of simvastatin in five models of nociceptive behaviour. Oral gavage administration of simvastatin induced a dose-dependent inhibition of nociception for 1 day in the acetic acid writhing (ED(50) = 5.59 \u00b1 0.07), tail-flick (ED(50) = 112.96 \u00b1 8.00), hot-plate (ED(50) = 134.87 \u00b1 2.20), formalin hind paw (ED(50) = 19.86 \u00b1 1.12 in phase I and 23.30 \u00b1 2.05 in phase II) and orofacial formalin (ED(50) = 5.54 \u00b1 2.74 in phase I and 11.48 \u00b1 1.88 in phase II) tests. However, after 3 days, the values were in the acetic acid writhing (ED(50) = 6.14 \u00b1 0.51), tail-flick (ED(50) = 154 \u00b1 8.88), hot-plate (ED(50) = 136.14 \u00b1 2.94), formalin hind paw (ED(50) = 15.93 \u00b1 0.42 in phase I and 17.10 \u00b1 1.80 in phase II) and orofacial formalin (ED(50) = 6.79 \u00b1 0.66 in phase I and 5.80 \u00b1 1.49 in phase II) tests. This study demonstrated the antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory activities of simvastatin in five models of tonic or phasic pain. These actions seem to be related to the inhibition of cytokine and prostanoid release and stimulation of nitric oxide synthesis. A possible clinical role of simvastatin could be related to the potentially beneficial effects in the neuropathic pain, and by their pleiotropic properties, they could play a clinical role in anti-inflammatory disease.", 
    "33": "Accumulating evidence has shown that diabetic patients are increasing in number, and renal and cardiovascular complications are the most common cause of death in diabetic patients. Thus, it would be of considerable value to identify the mechanisms involved in the progression of renal impairment and cardiovascular injury associated with diabetes. Recent evidence also indicated that multifactorial intervention is able to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and death among patients with diabetes and microalbuninuria. In this pilot study, we examined the effects of intensified multifactorial intervention, with tight glucose regulation and the use of valsartan and fluvastatin on ambulatory blood pressure (BP) profile, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (UACR), in 20 hypertensive patients (16 male and 4 female) with type 2 diabetes mellitus and overt nephropathy. After 12 months of intensified treatment, office BP, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) were significantly decreased compared to baseline (systolic blood pressure (SBP), 130 \u00b1 2 vs. 150 \u00b1 1 mmHg; diastolic blood pressure (DBP), 76 \u00b1 1 vs. 86 \u00b1 1 mmHg; FPG, 117 \u00b1 5 vs. 153 \u00b1 7 mg/dl; LDLC, 116 \u00b1 8 vs. 162 \u00b1 5 mg/dl, P < 0.0001). Also, compared to the baseline values, the daytime and nighttime ambulatory BP and short-term BP variability were significantly decreased after 12 months. Furthermore, while eGFR was not altered (44.3 \u00b1 5.1 vs. 44.3 \u00b1 6.5 ml/min/1.73 m(2), not significant (NS)), UACR showed a significant reduction after 12 months of intensified treatment (1228 \u00b1 355 vs. 2340 \u00b1 381 mg/g-cr, P < 0.05). These results suggest that the intensified multifactorial intervention is able to improve ambulatory BP profile, preserve renal function, and reduce urinary albumin excretion in type 2 diabetic hypertensive patients with overt nephropathy.",

Lovastatin and other inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase demonstrated to exhibit antineoplasmatic and proapoptotic properties in numerous in vitro studies involving myeloma cell lines. We treated 91 patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma with thalidomide, dexamethasone and lovastatin (TDL group, 49 patients) or thalidomide and dexamethasone (TD group, 42 patients). A clinical response defined of at least 50% reduction of monoclonal band has been observed in 32% of TD patients and 44% of TDL patients. Prolongation of overall survival and progression-free survival in the TDL group as compared with the TD group has been documented. The TDL regimen was safe and well tolerated. The incidence of side effects was comparable in both groups. Plasma cells have been cultured in vitro with thalidomide and lovastatin to assess the impact of both drugs on the apoptosis rate of plasma cells. In vitro experiments revealed that the combination of thalidomide and lovastatin induced higher apoptosis rate than apoptosis induced by each drug alone. Our results suggest that the addition of lovastatin to the TD regimen may improve the response rate in patients with relapsed or refractory myeloma.",

The goal of this study was to assess the effect of treatment with atorvastatin on the endothelial dysfunction of epicardial coronary arteries and the development of LVH in a porcine model. LVH was induced through 2 months of aortic banding (AB) of the ascending aorta. Experimental groups were (1) sham untreated: without AB, (2) LVH untreated: with AB, and (3,4) LVH treated: with AB treated with 40 and 80 mg of atorvastatin, respectively, for 60 days, and (5) sham treated: without AB treated with 80 mg of atorvastatin for 60 days. Vascular reactivity studies were performed in organ chambers experiments. NO bioavailability was assessed using cyclic guanosine monophosphate quantification. Oxidative stress levels were measured by quantifying angiotensin II) and nitrite/nitrate levels. LVH and LV diastolic function were evaluated using echocardiography. Atorvastatin decreased endothelium-dependent relaxations and cyclic guanosine monophosphate levels in all treated animals. Angiotensin II levels were increased, whereas nitrite levels were similar among groups (P > 0.05). LV diastolic dysfunction and LVH were significantly greater in all treated animals (P < 0.01). High-density lipoprotein levels and low-density lipoprotein levels were significantly decreased in animals receiving atorvastatin (P < 0.05). In this swine model of LVH, atorvastatin did not prevent LVH development or coronary endothelial dysfunction and resulted in worsening of the LV diastolic dysfunction.",

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the effect and possible molecular mechanisms of xuezhikang on inhibiting TF expression and hypercoagulable state and the differences compared with lovastatin. Our results showed that xuezhikang significantly suppressed oxidized low-density lipoprotein-induced TF expression in macrophages in a concentration-dependent manner. Xuezhikang reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase activity by decreasing membrane translocation of p47 through inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 activation. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate inhibitor (diphenyleneiodonium) also inhibited the oxidized low-density lipoprotein-induced TF expression, similar to the effects of xuezhikang. Furthermore, consistent with the severity of aortic atherosclerosis, xuezhikang (300 mg\u00b7kg\u00b7d) significantly reduced blood coagulation activation and TF expression in high-cholesterol diet-induced atherosclerotic rats. In addition, xuezhikang was more potent than lovastatin on inhibiting the expression of TF and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase activation. These observations provide evidences that inhibition of xuezhikang on hypercoagulation and TF expression may partly account for its cardioprotective benefits.",

It has been suggested that statins may benefit s-IBM patients based on their pleiotropic effects on autoimmunity and possible adverse influence of increased cholesterol on muscle pathological changes. We carried out a pilot, open-label trial to evaluate safety and tolerability of oral simvastatin in s-IBM patients. Fourteen patients were treated with 40 mg of simvastatin over 12 months. Primary outcome measures included the assessment tools proposed by International Myositis Outcome Assessment Collaborative Study group and the IBM-Functional Rating Scale. As additional data, we report the results obtained from muscle MRI, biopsy and oropharyngeal scintigraphy. Ten patients completed the trial and the treatment appeared safe and well tolerated. None of the patients showed a significant clinical improvement. Outcome measures used in this study proved to be valuable tools for global assessment of s-IBM patients. At present, we cannot recommend simvastatin as a treatment for s-IBM though our data may warrant a placebo-controlled study.", 
    "46": "Molecular geneticists tend to conceptualize disease pathogenesis from the mutated gene outward, an approach that does not take into account the impact of barrier requirements in determining disease phenotype. An 'outside-to-inside' perspective has provided quite different explanations for the ichthyoses, including several of the disorders of distal cholesterol metabolism. Elucidation of responsible pathogenic mechanisms also is pointing to appropriate, pathogenesis (pathway)-based therapeutic strategies. In the case of the lipid metabolic disorders, it takes full advantage of new molecular, genetic and cellular pathogenesis information to correct or bypass the metabolic abnormality. This approach fully exploits the unique accessibility of the skin to a topical approach. Moreover, since it will utilize topical lipids and lipid-soluble, and often generic, lipid-soluble drugs, these treatments should be readily transported across the stratum corneum. If successful, this approach could initiate an entirely new departure for the therapy of the ichthyoses. Finally, because these agents are relatively safe and inexpensive, this form of treatment has the potential to be widely-deployed, even in the developing world.",

Even with intensification of statin therapy, a substantial residual cardiovascular risk remains and atherogenic dyslipidemia is an important driver of this so-called residual risk. Besides statin therapy, new strategies evaluate the role of intensive combination lipid treatment for the entire type 2 diabetic population. The results from the ACCORD (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes) Lipid trial suggest that there is a lipid-related modifiable component to cardiovascular residual risk in statin-treated type 2 diabetic patients, and that further research should address patients with triglycerides above 204 mg/dl and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol below 34 mg/dl. Based on their respective lipid-modifying activity, the combination of a fibrate and statin is a logical approach to improving achievement of lipid targets in statin-treated patients with a glomerular filtration rate of >60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) and with residual atherogenic dyslipidemia.

A definitive role for ACL in tumorigenesis has emerged from ACL RNAi and chemical inhibitor studies, showing that ACL inhibition limits tumor cell proliferation and survival and induces differentiation in vitro. In vivo, it reduces tumor growth leading to a cytostatic effect and induces differentiation. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood and agents that could enhance the efficacy of ACL inhibition have not been identified. Our studies focus on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) lines, which show phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT activation secondary to a mutation in the K-Ras gene or the EGFR gene. Here we show that ACL knockdown promotes apoptosis and differentiation, leading to the inhibition of tumor growth in vivo. Moreover, in contrast to most studies, which elucidate how activation/suppression of signaling pathways can modify metabolism, we show that inhibition of a metabolic pathway \"reverse signals\" and attenuates PI3K/AKT signaling. Additionally, we find that statins, inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, which act downstream of ACL in the cholesterol synthesis pathway, dramatically enhance the anti-tumor effects of ACL inhibition, even regressing established tumors. With statin treatment, both PI3K/AKT and the MAPK pathways are affected. Moreover, this combined treatment is able to reduce the growth of EGF receptor resistant tumor cell types. Given the essential role of lipid synthesis in numerous cancers, this work may impact therapy in a broad range of tumors.",

HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) reportedly exert anticancer effects in a variety of diseases, but there have been no reports of these effects in cholangiocarcinoma. In this study, we investigated the utility of statins for cholangiocarcinoma treatment. Proliferation suppression by pitavastatin and atorvastatin was investigated in the human cholangiocarcinoma cell lines HuCCT1 and YSCCC while changes in the cell cycle and intracellular signals were examined by FACS and Western blotting, respectively. Additive proliferation suppression by statins and pre-existing anticancer drugs was also investigated. HuCCT1 and YSCCC cell proliferation was dramatically suppressed by incubation with statins for 72 h or longer. Cell cycle analysis revealed a reduction in the G2M fraction and an increase in the sub-G1 fraction in statin-treated cells, while Western blotting showed increased levels of cleaved caspase-3 and a reduction in p-ERK. Furthermore, statins in combination with gemcitabine, cisplatin and 5-FU showed additive proliferation suppression. In this study, treatment of human cholangiocarcinoma cells with statins induced apoptosis via suppression of the classical MAPK pathway. Together, these results suggest that statins may be a new cholangiocarcinoma treatment option that could potentially enhance the anticancer effect of pre-existing anticancer drugs.",

    "107": "AMR101 is an omega-3 fatty acid agent containing \u226596% eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester and no docosahexaenoic acid. Previous smaller studies suggested that highly purified eicosapentaenoic acid lowered triglyceride (TG) levels without increasing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. TG-lowering therapies such as fibrates, and fish oils containing both eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, can substantially increase LDL cholesterol levels when administered to patients with very high TG levels (\u2265500 mg/dl). The present double-blind study randomized 229 diet-stable patients with fasting TG \u2265500 mg/dl and \u22642,000 mg/dl (with or without background statin therapy) to AMR101 4 g/day, AMR101 2 g/day, or placebo. The primary end point was the placebo-corrected median percentage of change in TG from baseline to week 12. The baseline TG level was 680, 657, and 703 mg/dl for AMR101 4 g/day, AMR101 2 g/day, and placebo. AMR101 4 g/day reduced the placebo-corrected TG levels by 33.1% (n = 76, p <0.0001) and AMR101 2 g/day by 19.7% (n = 73, p = 0.0051). For a baseline TG level >750 mg/dl, AMR101 4 g/day reduced the placebo-corrected TG levels by 45.4% (n = 28, p = 0.0001) and AMR101 2 g/day by 32.9% (n = 28, p = 0.0016). AMR101 did not significantly increase the placebo-corrected median LDL cholesterol levels at 4 g/day (-2.3%) or 2 g/day (+5.2%; both p = NS). AMR101 significantly reduced non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A(2), very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and total cholesterol. AMR101 was generally well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to that of the placebo. In conclusion, the present randomized, double-blind trial of patients with very high TG levels demonstrated that AMR101 significantly reduced the TG levels and improved other lipid parameters without significantly increasing the LDL cholesterol levels.", 
    "108": "Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have a much higher risk of cardiovascular diseases than the general population. Endothelial dysfunction, which participates in accelerated atherosclerosis, is a hallmark of CKD. Patients with CKD display impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilatation, elevated soluble biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction, and increased oxidative stress. They also present an imbalance between circulating endothelial populations reflecting endothelial injury (endothelial microparticles and circulating endothelial cells) and repair (endothelial progenitor cells). Endothelial damage induced by a uremic environment suggests an involvement of uremia-specific factors. Several uremic toxins, mostly protein-bound, have been shown to have specific endothelial toxicity: ADMA, homocysteine, AGEs, and more recently, p-cresyl sulfate and indoxyl sulfate. These toxins, all poorly removed by hemodialysis therapies, share mechanisms of endothelial toxicity: they promote pro-oxidant and pro-inflammatory response and inhibit endothelial repair. This article (i) reviews the evidence for endothelial dysfunction in CKD, (ii) specifies the involvement of protein-bound uremic toxins in this dysfunction, and (iii) discusses therapeutic strategies for lowering uremic toxin concentrations or for countering the effects of uremic toxins on the endothelium.",

Pitavastatin has a distinctive metabolic profile that means it is marginally metabolised by CYP enzymes, and is therefore expected to have a low risk of DDIs and related ADRs. A large post-marketing study conducted in more than 20,000 patients in Japan has demonstrated that the rate of DDIs with pitavastatin treatment may compare favourably with that observed with atorvastatin and rosuvastatin.",

This, coupled with the demonstrated efficacy of pitavastatin in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, should help physicians individualise lipid-lowering regimens based on the patient profile and concomitant medications.", 
    "118": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the osteoconductivity of three different bone substitute materials: \u03b1-tricalcium phosphate (\u03b1-TCP), (\u03b2-TCP), and hydroxyapatite (HA), combined with or without simvastatin, which is a cholesterol synthesis inhibitor stimulating BMP-2 expression in osteoblasts. We used 72 Wistar rats and prepared two calvarial bone defects of 5 mm diameter in each rat. Defects were filled with the particles of 500-750 \u03bcm diameter combined with or without simvastatin at 0.1 mg dose for each defect. In the control group, defects were left empty. Animals were divided into seven groups: \u03b1-TCP, \u03b2-TCP, HA, \u03b1-TCP with simvastatin, \u03b2-TCP with simvastatin, HA with simvastatin, and control. The animals were sacrificed at 6 and 8 weeks. The calvariae were dissected out and analyzed with micro CT. The specimens were evaluated histologically and histomorphometrically. In \u03b1-TCP group, the amount of newly formed bone was significantly more than both HA and control groups but not significantly yet more than \u03b2-TCP group. Degradation of \u03b1-TCP was prominent and \u03b2-TCP showed slower rate while HA showed the least degradation. Combining the materials with Simvastatin led to increasing in the amount of newly formed bone. These results confirmed that \u03b1-TCP, \u03b2-TCP, and HA are osteoconductive materials acting as space maintainer for bone formation and that combining these materials with simvastatin stimulates bone regeneration and it also affects degradability of \u03b1-TCP and \u03b2-TCP. Conclusively, \u03b1-TCP has the advantage of higher rate of degradation allowing the more bone formation and combining \u03b1-TCP with simvastatin enhances this property.",

    "128": "Use of statins is hypothesized to reduce colorectal cancer risk but the evidence remains inconsistent. This may be partly explained by differential associations according to tumor location or molecular subtypes of colorectal cancer. We examined the association between statin use and colorectal cancer risk according to tumor location, KRAS mutation status, microsatellite instability (MSI) status, PTGS2 (COX-2) expression, or CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) status in two large prospective cohort studies, the Nurses' Health Study and Health Professionals Follow-up Study. We applied Cox regression to a competing risks analysis. We identified 1,818 colorectal cancers during 1990 to 2006. Compared with nonusers, current statin use was not associated with colorectal cancer [relative risk (RR) = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.86-1.14] or colon cancer (RR = 1.10, 95% CI = 0.94-1.29) but was inversely associated with rectal cancer (RR = 0.59, 95% CI = 0.41-0.84, P(heterogeneity) < 0.001). When we examined the association within strata of KRAS mutation status, we found no association with KRAS-mutated cancers (RR = 1.20, 95% CI = 0.87-1.67) but did observe a possible inverse association among KRAS wild-type cancers (RR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.60-1.06, P(heterogeneity) = 0.06). The association did not substantially differ by PTGS2 expression, MSI status, or CIMP status. Current statin use was not associated with risk of overall colorectal cancer. The possibility that statin use may be associated with lower risk of rectal cancer or KRAS wild-type colorectal cancer requires further confirmation.",

Randomized trials in pneumonia are few, mostly limited in septic shock and ARDS patients. Recombinant activated protein C is a potent anticoagulant and profibrinolytic enzyme which can inhibit the systemic inflammatory response. Available data, although limited, showed that activated protein C can reduce mortality in severe sepsis, especially in severe pneumonia due to S. Pneumoniae.

Fish oil was shown to improve triglycerides in combination with other lipid-lowering therapy such as a statin or fibrate. Fish oil also had effects on lowering total cholesterol, very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), and increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL). In terms of its antiplatelet activity, fish oil was shown to lower platelet aggregation when given in combination with clopidogrel and aspirin therapy during PCI, thus fish oil appears to enhance platelet response to clopidogrel.

    "167": "Fenofibrate is a fibric acid derivative with lipid-modifying effects that are mediated by the activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b1. Fenofibrate also has a number of nonlipid, pleiotropic effects (e.g. reducing levels of fibrinogen, C-reactive protein, and various pro-inflammatory markers, and improving flow-mediated dilatation) that may contribute to its clinical efficacy, particularly in terms of improving microvascular outcomes. The beneficial effects of fenofibrate on the lipid profile have been shown in a number of randomized controlled trials. In primary dyslipidemia, fenofibrate monotherapy consistently decreased triglyceride (TG) levels to a significantly greater extent than placebo; significantly greater increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels and significantly greater reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and total cholesterol (TC) levels were also seen in some trials. Monotherapy with fenofibrate or gemfibrozil had generally similar effects on TG and HDL-C levels, although in one trial, TC and LDL-C levels were reduced to a significantly greater extent with fenofibrate than with gemfibrozil. Fenofibrate monotherapy tended to improve TG and HDL-C levels to a significantly greater extent than statin monotherapy in primary dyslipidemia, whereas statin monotherapy decreased LDL-C and TC levels to a significantly greater extent than fenofibrate monotherapy. Fenofibrate also had a beneficial effect on atherogenic dyslipidemia in patients with the metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes mellitus, reducing TG levels, tending to increase HDL-C levels, and promoting a shift to larger low-density lipoprotein particles. In terms of cardiovascular outcomes, fenofibrate did not reduce the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) events to a greater extent than placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes in the FIELD trial. However, the risk of some nonfatal macrovascular events (e.g. nonfatal myocardial infarction, revascularization) and certain microvascular outcomes (e.g. amputation, first laser therapy for diabetic retinopathy, progression of albuminuria) was reduced to a significantly greater extent with fenofibrate than with placebo. Subgroup analysis revealed a significant reduction in the cardiovascular disease (CVD) event rate among fenofibrate recipients in the subgroup of patients with marked hypertriglyceridemia or marked dyslipidemia at baseline. In the ACCORD Lipid trial, there were no significant differences between patients with type 2 diabetes and a high risk of CVD events who received fenofibrate plus simvastatin and those who received placebo plus simvastatin for any of the primary or secondary cardiovascular outcomes. However, fenofibrate plus simvastatin was of benefit in patients who had markedly high TG levels and markedly low HDL-C levels at baseline. In addition, fenofibrate plus simvastatin slowed the progression of diabetic retinopathy. Fenofibrate is generally well tolerated. Common adverse events included increases in transaminase levels that were usually transient, minor, and asymptomatic, and gastrointestinal signs and symptoms. In conclusion, monotherapy with fenofibrate remains a useful option in patients with dyslipidemia, particularly in atherogenic dyslipidemia characterized by high TG and low HDL-C levels.",

CoQ10 has been shown to alleviate the side effects of statin drugs, for instance, and so there is a push to find naturally high producers of the compound. Sporidiobolus johnsonii (S. johnsonii) has been reported to produce CoQ10 in studies that used only standards on thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and also suggested the production of coenzyme Q9 (CoQ9). This work set out to verify CoQ9/CoQ10 production in S. johnsonii and quantify as appropriate. We show that S. johnsonii produces CoQ10 but found no evidence for CoQ9 biosynthesis. The specific production of CoQ10 was noted at 10\u2005mg/g dry cell weight (DCW) in media supplemented with 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (HBA). This makes S. johnsonii a naturally high CoQ10 producer. New methods for extraction and purification of CoQ10 are also discussed, and identification of a closely eluting side product under normal phase isolation is reported.",

    "177": "Sandwich-cultured hepatocytes (SCH) are a useful tool for evaluating hepatobiliary drug transport in vitro. Some studies have investigated the in vitro-in vivo correlations of the biliary clearance of drugs using SCH. In most cases, the biliary clearance observed in vivo correlated well with the predicted clearance, but the predicted absolute values were underestimated when based on in vitro experiments with SCH. We hypothesized that the down-regulated function of uptake transporters is one of the causes of this underestimation. Therefore, the uptake of taurocholate, digoxin, pravastatin, and rosuvastatin was investigated in sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes (SCRH) cultured for 5, 24, 48, and 96 h, and the predicted hepatic clearance from in vitro uptake clearance (CL(H, vitro)) was calculated with a dispersion model. In SCRH cultured for 96 h, the saturable uptake of taurocholate, digoxin, pravastatin, and rosuvastatin decreased to 7.5, 3.3, 64, and 23%, respectively, of their uptake in hepatocytes cultured for 5 h, and a better prediction of in vivo hepatic clearance (CL(H, vivo)) was achieved when based on CL(H, vitro) of 5-h-cultured hepatocytes. These results suggest that the uptake activity is considerably reduced in cell culture, even in a sandwich-culture format. In a similar study, we also examined taurocholate and rosuvastatin in sandwich-cultured human hepatocytes (SCHH). Unlike in SCRH, the saturable uptake of these compounds did not differ markedly in SCHH cultured for 5 or 96 h. Thus, the uptake activity in SCHH was maintained relatively well compared with that in SCRH.",

Both statins and valproic acid are known to suppress the growth of multiple cancer lines, but the effects on mesothelioma cells are not well defined. In the present study we examined the effects of lovastatin and valproic acid on ACC-MESO-1, which is a human derived mesothelioma cell line. We found that lovastatin (2 \u03bcM) and/or valproic acid (5 mM) did not reduce cell viability nor induce apoptosis, but reduced cell invasion. The effect was additive when combined. Furthermore it was speculated that induction of autophagic changes was at least in part involved in this process.", 
    "179": "Statins can have beneficial cholesterol-independent effects on vascular contractility, which may involve increases in the bioavailability of NO (nitric oxide) as a result of phosphorylation of eNOS (endothelial NO synthase). Although this has been attributed to phosphorylation of Akt (also known as protein kinase B), studies in cultured cells have shown that statins can phosphorylate AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase); it is unknown whether this has functional effects in intact arteries. Thus we investigated the acute effects of simvastatin on resistance arterial contractile function, evaluating the involvement of NO, Akt and AMPK. Isolated rat mesenteric resistance arteries were mounted on a wire myograph. The effects of incubation (1 and 2\u00a0h) with simvastatin (0.1 or 1\u00a0\u03bcM) on contractile responses were examined in the presence and absence of L-NNA (N-nitro-L-arginine; 10\u00a0\u03bcM) or mevalonate (1\u00a0mM). Effects on eNOS, phospho-eNOS (Ser1177), and total and phospho-Akt and -AMPK protein expression were investigated using Western blotting. The effect of AMPK inhibition (compound C, 10\u00a0\u03bcM) on eNOS phosphorylation and contractile responses were also studied. Simvastatin (1\u00a0\u03bcM, 2\u00a0h) significantly reduced constriction to U46619 and phenylephrine and enhanced dilations to ACh (acetylcholine) in depolarized, but not in U46619-pre-constricted arteries. These effects were completely and partially prevented by L-NNA and mevalonate respectively. Simvastatin increased eNOS and AMPK\u03b1 phosphorylation, but had no effect on Akt protein expression and phosphorylation after 2\u00a0h incubation. Compound C prevented the effects of simvastatin on eNOS phosphorylation and contractility. Thus simvastain can acutely modulate resistance arterial contractile function via mechanisms that involve the AMPK/phospho-eNOS (Ser1177)/NO-dependent pathway.",

The current treatment of chronic nephropathies is limited to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, but increasing clinical and experimental evidence suggests that statins could play a therapeutic role. Ultrastructural studies have shown the presence of gap junctions within all the cells of the glomerulus and podocytes have been found to contain primarily connexin-43. The present study aims to observe the beneficial effects of rosuvastatin on structural and ultrastructural renal morphology and on glomerular connexin-43 expression in normotensive rats and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Rats were randomly allocated into four groups: WKY-C: normotensive animals no receiving rosuvastatin; WKY-ROS: normotensive animals receiving rosuvastatin; SHR-C: hypertensive animals no receiving rosuvastatin; SHR-ROS: hypertensive animals receiving rosuvastatin. Our results show no differences in blood urea, creatinine, uric acid and creatine phosphokinase levels between the groups, however, there was an decreasing of 24-h protein excretion in SHR-ROS. Capsular area in SHR-ROS was decreased, however, there was no alteration in urinary space. By transmission electron microscopy the slit diaphragm and podocyte foot processes were more preserved in SHR-ROS. By scanning electron microscopy the podocyte foot processes were more preserved in SHR-ROS. Increased connexin-43 immunofluorescence was observed in glomeruli of WKY-ROS and SHR-ROS. In conclusion, we hypothesize that renal pleiotropic effect of rosuvastatin can be a therapeutic tool for improving kidney ultrastructure and, consequently, renal function in hypertensive individuals.", 
    "185": "Plaque rupture and subsequent thrombotic occlusion of the coronary artery account for as many as three quarters of myocardial infarctions. The concept of plaque stabilisation emerged about 20 years ago to explain the discrepancy between the reduction of cardiovascular events in patients receiving lipid lowering therapy and the small decrease seen in angiographic evaluation of atherosclerosis. Since then, the concept of a vulnerable plaque has received a lot of attention in basic and clinical research leading to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of the vulnerable plaque and acute coronary syndromes. From pathological and clinical observations, plaques that have recently ruptured have thin fibrous caps, large lipid cores, exhibit outward remodelling and invasion by vasa vasorum. Ruptured plaques are also focally inflamed and this may be a common denominator of the other pathological features. Plaques with similar characteristics, but which have not yet ruptured, are believed to be vulnerable to rupture. Experimental studies strongly support the validity of anti-inflammatory approaches to promote plaque stability. Unfortunately, reliable non-invasive methods for imaging and detection of such plaques are not yet readily available. There is a strong biological basis and supportive clinical evidence that low-density lipoprotein lowering with statins is useful for the stabilisation of vulnerable plaques. There is also some clinical evidence for the usefulness of antiplatelet agents, beta blockers and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors for plaque stabilisation. Determining the causes of plaque rupture and designing diagnostics and interventions to prevent them are urgent priorities for current basic and clinical research in cardiovascular area.",

Subjects were treated with 2.5 mg/day rosuvastatin, which was increased to 10 mg/day for the 24-week study period. Rosuvastatin effectively reduced total cholesterol, LDL-C, triglycerides, non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) levels, and the LDL-C/HDL-C ratio. Although there was no significant change in the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), serum cystatin C levels and urinary albumin/creatinine ratio were significantly decreased. Subjects were divided into 2 groups: with and without diabetes mellitus (DM). Percent changes of HDL-C, C-reactive protein (CRP), and malondialdehyde-modified (MDA)-LDL were significantly higher in the DM group than in the non-DM group. Furthermore, when the subjects were divided into 2 groups based on eGFR levels (60 mL/min/1.73 m(2) or more, normal-GFR group; less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m(2), decreased-GFR group), the percent reduction of non-HDL-C, CRP, MDA-LDL levels, and albuminuria of DM subjects in the decreased-GFR group were significantly higher than those in the non-DM subjects. Multivariate analysis identified a change in cystatin C to be associated with decreased albuminuria during rosuvastatin treatment. Rosuvastatin administration reduced albuminuria, serum cystatin C levels, and inflammation, and improved lipid profiles, regardless of the presence or absence of DM, and the degree of the eGFR.",

After weighting for subgroup-specific reductions in LDL cholesterol, there was no good evidence that the proportional effects on major atherosclerotic events differed from the summary rate ratio in any subgroup examined, and, in particular, they were similar in patients on dialysis and those who were not. The excess risk of myopathy was only two per 10,000 patients per year of treatment with this combination (9 [0\u00b72%] vs 5 [0\u00b71%]).

    "223": "Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is overexpressed in many cancer types including ~30% of breast cancers. Several small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting EGFR have shown clinical efficacy in lung and colon cancers, but no benefit has been noted in breast cancer. Thirteen EGFR expressing breast cancer cell lines were analyzed for response to EGFR TKIs. Seven were found to be EGFR TKI resistant; while shRNA knockdown of EGFR determined that four of these cell lines retained the requirement of EGFR protein expression for growth. Interestingly, EGFR localized to plasma membrane lipid rafts in all four of these EGFR TKI-resistant cell lines, as determined by biochemical raft isolation and immunofluorescence. When lipid rafts were depleted of cholesterol using lovastatin, all four cell lines were sensitized to EGFR TKIs. In fact, the effects of the cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitors and gefitinib were synergistic. While gefitinib effectively abrogated phosphorylation of Akt- and mitogen-activated protein kinase in an EGFR TKI-sensitive cell line, phosphorylation of Akt persisted in two EGFR TKI-resistant cell lines, however, this phosphorylation was abrogated by lovastatin treatment. Thus, we have shown that lipid raft localization of EGFR correlates with resistance to EGFR TKI-induced growth inhibition and pharmacological depletion of cholesterol from lipid rafts decreases this resistance in breast cancer cell lines. Furthermore, we have presented evidence to suggest that when EGFR localizes to lipid rafts, these rafts provide a platform to facilitate activation of Akt signaling in the absence of EGFR kinase activity.", 
    "224": "Dyslipidaemia is frequently present in obesity, metabolic syndrome (MetS) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The predominant features of dyslipidaemia in these disorders include increased flux of free fatty acids (FFA), raised triglyceride (TG) and low high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, a predominance of small, dense (atherogenic) low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) particles and raised apolipoprotein (apo) B values Posprandial hyperlipidaemia may also be present. Insulin resistance (IR) appears to play an important role in the pathogenesis of dyslipidaemia in obesity, MetS and T2DM. The cornerstone of treatment of this IR-related dyslipidaemia is lifestyle changes and in diabetic patients, tight glycaemic control. In addition to these measures, recent clinical trials showed benefit with statin treatment. Nevertheless, a substantial percentage of patients treated with statins still experience vascular events. This residual vascular risk needs to be addressed. This review summarizes the effects of hypolipidaemic drug combinations (including statins with cholesterol ester protein inhibitors, niacin, fibrates or fish oil, as well as fibrate-ezetimibe combination) on the residual vascular risk in patients with obesity, MetS or T2DM.",

Eight-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were used in this study. OJ or a 0.079% hesperidin suspension was administered orally for 2 days. Tap water was given as a control. A single dose of PRV at 100\u2009 mg/kg p.o. was administered after 2 days of OJ, hesperidin, or tap water ingestion. The AUC, C(max), and t(1/2) values of PRV were significantly increased in OJ group. Mrp2 protein and mRNA levels in the small intestine and liver, respectively, were significantly decreased after the ingestion of OJ. The same results were obtained with hesperidin. These results suggest that the changes in PRV pharmacokinetic parameters and the decrease in Mrp2 expression caused by OJ are due to hesperidin in the juice.", 
    "226": "Measurements of carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) are widely used in clinical research as a measure of atherosclerosis. Many randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been performed using the rate of change in CIMT as the primary endpoint to study the efficacy of lipid-modifying therapies. The main advantage of using CIMT over the use of cardiovascular events as a primary endpoint is the greater efficiency and feasibility. The underlying assumption for the use of CIMT in trials is that the rate of change in CIMT achieved by a therapy reflects a change in the risk for cardiovascular events. We therefore set out to assess the evidence showing whether the rate of change in CIMT induced by lipid-lowering therapies has an impact on clinical outcomes, by reviewing the available evidence based on a search of the PubMed database. Solid evidence from observational studies shows that increased CIMT relates to an increase in cardiovascular risk. RCTs consistently demonstrate that the annual rate of change in CIMT is favourably affected by lipid-modifying therapies. One study investigating the relationship between the rate of change in CIMT and clinical events has been published and showed a positive relationship between these two outcomes. A published meta-analysis based on pooled CIMT data from statin trials has shown a positive relationship between attenuated rate of change in CIMT after statin therapy and clinical outcomes. However, methodological issues question the validity of the meta-analytical approach. The consistent agreement between results from CIMT trials and event trials on the effects of lipid-modifying therapies, however, clearly supports the presence of a relationship between changes in CIMT and clinical endpoints. Therefore, although direct evidence is scarce, the data overall on whether the attenuation of rate of change in CIMT by lipid-lowering therapies impact on clinical outcomes are supportive.", 
    "227": "Uremic toxins accumulate in patients with chronic kidney diseases (CKDs) and cause further progression of renal damage and cardiovascular diseases. Recently, it was reported that some of the organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) and the organic anion transporters (OATs) are involved in the renal elimination of uremic toxins. SLCO4C1 is the only OATP expressed at the basolateral side of proximal tubular cells in human kidney, and it mediates the excretion of uremic toxins. The overexpression of human SLCO4C1 in rat kidney promotes the renal excretion of uremic toxins and reduces hypertension, cardiomegaly, and renal inflammation in renal failure. Statins induce SLCO4C1 expression thorough transcriptional factor Aryl hydrocarbon receptor through binding of the xenobiotic responsive element at its promoter region. The administration of statin in a rat renal failure model facilitated the elimination of uremic toxins and mitigated organ damage. In addition, metabolomic analysis of rat renal failure models and patients with CKD by capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry is a useful method for identifying new uremic solutes and explores surrogate biomarkers for detecting the progression of early stage CKD.",
