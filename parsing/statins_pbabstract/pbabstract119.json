During hospitalization, most patients received aspirin (96%) and a statin (90%), 83% received a beta-blocker and 74% an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. Among eligible STEMI patients, 42% (419/989) did not receive fibrinolysis or undergo percutaneous coronary intervention. All-cause death at 12 months was 8.1% and did not differ significantly between patients with STEMI or NSTE-ACS (8.3% vs 7.7%, respectively; Log-rank test P=0.82).

Galectin-3 expression is associated with myocardial fibrosis; recombinant galectin-3 can induce myocardial fibrosis in experimental animals. However, the fact that endogenous galectin-3 is causative of myocardial fibrosis is yet to be firmly established. Nevertheless, the important discovery that N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline (Ac-SDKP), a naturally occurring anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic peptide, inhibits galectin-3 expression, which prevents cardiac remodeling and dysfunction, provides impetus for translational research into anti-galectin therapy. The lack of a close relationship between galectin-3 and brain natriuretic peptide creates the possibility of a complimentary role. Thus, whilst brain natriuretic peptide is a useful biomarker for diagnosing heart failure, galectin-3 appears to be a culprit biomarker that mediates the development of heart failure, raising the possibility that specific anti-galectin therapy may halt the development of heart failure. Furthermore, data are beginning to emerge supporting the hypothesis that galectin-3 is crucial in the angiotensin-aldosterone pathway leading to salt and water retention, a key mechanism which can result in the development of heart failure. Thus, one might expect patients with heart failure and raised levels of galectin-3 to benefit from aldosterone antagonist therapy. Numerous clinical trials have already established the role of galectin-3 in predicting response to heart failure management, in particular how high levels of galectin-3 predicts mortality. A recent post hoc analysis of the Controlled Rosuvastatin Multinational Trial in Heart Failure (CORONA) suggested that patients with relatively low galectin-3 levels (<19 ng/ml) are most likely to benefit from statin therapy. This generated an important hypothesis that deserves further study.",

We evaluated the inflammatory and angiogenic components of the fibrovascular tissue induced by subcutaneous implants in mice and their modulation by fluvastatin. Our results showed that the statin (0.6 and 6 mg/kg/day) inhibited hemoglobin (Hb) content (51%) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels (71%) in the treated group compared with the control group. The inflammatory component, as assessed by N-acetyl-\u03b2-D-glucosaminidase activity and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) level was also decreased by the compound. In the treated group; the inhibition of the enzyme activity was 33% and the cytokine was 67% relative to the control. In these implants the statin was also able to decrease nitric oxide (NO) production, detected with an NO-sensitive electrode. To our knowledge this is the first study demonstrating an inhibitory role of fluvastatin on the production of NO in inflammatory angiogenesis of newly formed fibrovascular tissue.",

A growing body of evidence support efficacy of statins in LE-PAD due to the ability of both reducing cardiovascular risk and improving walking distance and, hence, quality of life. Consequently, statin therapy should be considered in all LE-PAD patients and new LDL-cholesterol targets should be reached.",

This is because the observed decline in the incidence of CVD owing to improvements in prevention has now been counterbalanced by the increased shift toward an older and thus more fragile population. Statin treatment reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in middle-aged adults. However, few studies have included older individuals, particularly those aged 80 years or over. The adverse effects associated with high doses of statins and their interactions with other drugs may give rise to more problems in the elderly population. Evidence remains limited regarding the overall benefit of starting statin therapy in adults aged 80 and over; so that clinical judgment remains necessary in making the decision to use them. In this review, we present available evidence from randomized clinical trials, as well as relative community and post-approval data directly applicable to the management of CVD in the elderly, in both primary and secondary prevention. Also discussed is the latest evidence regarding the putative protective effects of statins on senile dementia and the relationship between statin treatment and cancer.",

Rats underwent similar procedure but without ligation were used as group sham operated (S). Atorvastatin (10mg/Kg/d body weight) was administrated by gavage to rats in three atorvastatin treated groups, and L-NAME (40 mg/Kg/d body weight) or AMD3100 (5mg/Kg/d body weight) was given to group A+L-NAME or A+AMD3100, respectively.",

Anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects of atorvastatin were offset either by decrease of SDF-1\u03b1 and CXCR4 expression (by L-NAME) or blockage of SDF-1\u03b1 coupling with CXCR4 (by AMD3100). Expression of STAT3, a cardioprotective factor mediating SDF-1\u03b1/CXCR4 axis induced cardiac protection, was up-regulated most significantly in group A.

    "72": "Although statin drugs are generally efficacious for lowering plasma LDL-cholesterol levels, there is considerable variability in response. To identify candidate genes that may contribute to this variation, we used an unbiased genome-wide filter approach that was applied to 10,149 genes expressed in immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) derived from 480 participants of the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenomics (CAP) clinical trial of simvastatin. The criteria for identification of candidates included genes whose statin-induced changes in expression were correlated with change in expression of HMGCR, a key regulator of cellular cholesterol metabolism and the target of statin inhibition. This analysis yielded 45 genes, from which RHOA was selected for follow-up because it has been found to participate in mediating the pleiotropic but not the lipid-lowering effects of statin treatment. RHOA knock-down in hepatoma cell lines reduced HMGCR, LDLR, and SREBF2 mRNA expression and increased intracellular cholesterol ester content as well as apolipoprotein B (APOB) concentrations in the conditioned media. Furthermore, inter-individual variation in statin-induced RHOA mRNA expression measured in vitro in CAP LCLs was correlated with the changes in plasma total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and APOB induced by simvastatin treatment (40 mg/d for 6 wk) of the individuals from whom these cell lines were derived. Moreover, the minor allele of rs11716445, a SNP located in a novel cryptic RHOA exon, dramatically increased inclusion of the exon in RHOA transcripts during splicing and was associated with a smaller LDL-cholesterol reduction in response to statin treatment in 1,886 participants from the CAP and Pravastatin Inflamation and CRP Evaluation (PRINCE; pravastatin 40 mg/d) statin clinical trials. Thus, an unbiased filter approach based on transcriptome-wide profiling identified RHOA as a gene contributing to variation in LDL-cholesterol response to statin, illustrating the power of this approach for identifying candidate genes involved in drug response phenotypes.",

In addition, the content of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and its active form, phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3-Thr(705)), was analyzed. Simvastatin induced neither variations in the plasma lipid levels nor alterations in the baseline content of analysed proteins with the exception of upregulation of cytochrome C. Furthermore, simvastatin significantly increased the baseline levels of pSTAT3 in contrast to the control group. In the IR hearts, simvastatin reduced the expression of Bax and non-cleaved caspase-3. In these hearts, phosphorylation of STAT3 did not differ in comparison to the non-treated IR group, however total STAT3 content was slightly increased. The improved recovery of left ventricular developed pressure co-existed with the increased Bcl-2/Bax ratio. In conclusion, pleiotropic action of statins may ameliorate viability of cardiomyocytes by favouring the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and downregulating the pro-apoptotic markers; however STAT3 does not seem to be a dominant regulator of this anti-apoptotic action of simvastatin.",

In HCV replicon cells, the effects of pitavastatin and/or EPA on HCV replication and expression of innate-immunity- and lipid-metabolism-associated genes were investigated. In patients infected with HCV-1b, sustained virological response rates were significantly higher in the add-on than standard group.

Among the patients with non-TT genotype, sustained virological response rates were markedly higher in the add-on than standard group. By multivariate analysis, genome variation of IL28B but not add-on therapy remained as a predictive factor of sustained virological response. In replicon cells, pitavastatin and EPA suppressed HCV replication. Activation of innate immunity was obvious in pitavastatin-treated cells and EPA suppressed the expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c and low-density lipoprotein receptor.

In this study, we further elucidated the molecular mechanisms underlying the stimulatory effects of statins on caspase-1. Three commonly recognized mechanistic models for NLRP3 inflammasome activation (i.e., ATP/P2X7/K(+) efflux, ROS production, and lysosomal rupture) were investigated in statin-stimulated human THP-1 monocytes. We found that fluvastatin and lovastatin can synergize with LPS to trigger inflammasome activation. Moreover, statin-induced caspase-1 activation and IL-1\u03b2 production in LPS-primed THP-1 cells are dependent on GGPP deficiency and P2X7 activation. In particular, increased ATP release accounts for the action of statins in P2X7 activation. We also provide evidence that statin-induced moderate ROS elevation is involved in this event. Moreover, the cathepsin B inhibitor was shown to reduce statin-induced IL-1\u03b2 secretion. Consistently statins can induce cathepsin B activation and lysosomal rupture, as evidenced by LysoTracker staining. Statins also increase intracellular ATP secretion and IL-1\u03b2 release in primary human monocytes and murine macrophages. Notably, exogenous ATP-elicited P2X7 activation and consequent IL-1\u03b2 release, an index of direct NLRP3 inflammasome activation, were not altered by statins. Taken together, statin-induced enhancement of inflammasome activation in monocytes and macrophages covers multiple mechanisms, including increases in ATP release, ROS production, and lysosomal rupture. These data not only shed new insight into isoprenylation-dependent regulation of caspase-1 but also unmask mechanisms for statin-elicited inflammasome activation.",

Statins are the drugs of choice to decrease plasma cholesterol and have other beneficial actions beyond lipid-lowering leading to substantial improvements in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, evaluation of the effects of statins to reduce overall morbidity and mortality must integrate metabolic consequences of statin therapy with its lipid-lowering effect. Indeed, reduction in LDL-cholesterol to target level achieved by statins does not completely eliminate risk of cardiovascular disease and may elevate metabolic risk factors that contribute to dysregulation of metabolic homeostasis. This may lead to increased incidence of diabetes and its cardiovascular complications that are explained, in part, by reciprocal relationships between insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction. Genetic factors may determine 40-60% of total cholesterol levels and 70% of the efficacy of statin treatments. Metabolic and cardiovascular phenotypes that are either genetically determined or environmentally acquired are also important determinants of responses to specific statins. Moreover, differences between biological outcomes of specific statins or increasing dosages of statins result in differential metabolic actions due to off-target or unknown mechanism that have important implications for the use of statins to reduce overall morbidity and mortality. In this review, we discuss differential cardiovascular and metabolic pleiotropic actions of specific statins that interact in a context-dependent manner with patient phenotypes and genotypes.

JAK2 inhibitors, however, do not readily eliminate neoplastic MPN cells and thus do not induce patient remission. Further understanding JAK2 signalling in MPNs may uncover novel avenues for therapeutic intervention. Recent work has suggested a potential role for cellular cholesterol in the activation of JAK2 by the erythropoietin receptor and in the development of an MPN-like disorder in mice. Our study demonstrates for the first time that the MPN-associated JAK2-V617F kinase localizes to lipid rafts and that JAK2-V617F-dependent signalling is inhibited by lipid raft disrupting agents, which target membrane cholesterol, a critical component of rafts. We also show for the first time that statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, widely used to treat hypercholesterolaemia, induce apoptosis and inhibit JAK2-V617F-dependent cell growth. These cells are more sensitive to statin treatment than non-JAK2-V617F-dependent cells. Importantly, statin treatment inhibited erythropoietin-independent erythroid colony formation of primary cells from MPN patients, but had no effect on erythroid colony formation from healthy individuals. Our study is the first to demonstrate that JAK2-V617F signalling is dependent on lipid rafts and that statins may be effective in a potential therapeutic approach for MPNs.",

Although they do not reduce the mortality rate, statins reduce LDL cholesterol and may provide some benefit to patients with ischemic heart failure. In contrast, some authors believe that statin therapy may actually worsen outcomes in patients with CHF, especially if there is excessive reduction in LDL cholesterol. This review discusses the theories attempting to link the adverse effects of statin-mediated LDL lowering in CHF to increased levels of endotoxin or reduced levels of coenzyme Q10.

Increased risk may be attributable to the inflammatory effects of HIV infection and dyslipidemia associated with some antiretroviral agents. The prevalence of cardiovascular disease is increasing as patients live longer, age, and acquire traditional coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors. In general, any additional cardiovascular risk posed by HIV infection or antiretroviral therapy is of potential concern for patients who are already at moderate or high risk for CHD. Long-term and well-designed studies are needed to more accurately ascertain to what degree HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy affect long-term cardiovascular disease risk. Management of dyslipidemia to reduce CHD risk in HIV-infected patients is much the same as in the general population, with the cornerstone consisting of statin therapy and lifestyle interventions. Smoking cessation is a major step in reducing CHD risk in those who smoke. This article summarizes a presentation by James H.

    "148": "Thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR1) is a selenocysteine-containing redox-active enzyme that is thought to be important during carcinogenesis. We have recently shown that treatment with statins, HMGCoA reductase inhibitors, reduces the levels of TrxR1 in liver of both rat and human. The reduced TrxR1 levels were correlated with inhibited hepatocarcinogenesis in a rat model. The aim of the present study was to investigate if statins affect the activity of the human TXNRD1 core promoter, which guides expression of TrxR1, and if the effects by statins on TrxR1 expression in liver could be reproduced in a cellular model system. We found that simvastatin and fluvastatin decreased cellular TrxR activity in cultured human liver-derived HepG2 cells with approximately 40% (p<0.05). Simvastatin, but not fluvastatin or atorvastatin, also reduced the TXNRD1 promoter activity in HepG2 cells by 20% (p<0.01). In line with this result, TrxR1 mRNA levels decreased with about 25% in non-transfected HepG2 cells upon treatment with simvastatin (p<0.01). Concomitant treatment with mevalonate could not reverse these effects of simvastatin, indicating that other mechanisms than HMGCoA reductase inhibition was involved. Also, simvastatin did not inhibit sulforaphane-derived stimulation of the TXNRD1 core promoter activity, suggesting that the inhibition by simvastatin was specific for basal and not Nrf2-activated TrxR1 expression. In contrast to simvastatin, the two other statins tested, atorvastatin or fluvastatin, did not influence the TrxR1 mRNA levels. Thus, our results reveal a simvastatin-specific reduction of cellular TrxR1 levels that at least in part involves direct inhibitory effects on the basal activity of the core promoter guiding TrxR1 expression.",

Neuronal NOS (nNOS) is expressed throughout the central and peripheral nervous system. nNOS has a sympathoinhibitory effect under physiological conditions by acting on different sites of the nervous system, including the paraventricular nucleus, the nucleus of the solitary tract, the rostral ventrolateral medulla, the carotid body and nerves in the kidney. nNOS is sympathoinhibitory in a range of diseases including chronic heart failure, chronic renal failure, hypertension and diabetes. nNOS is believed to mediate sympathoinhibitory effects induced by a range of signaling pathways including those promoted by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 over-expression; statin therapy; angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockers; exercise training; tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 blockade; superoxide dismutase mimetics; and estrogen replacement therapy.

    "173": "All fibrates are peroxisome proliferators-activated receptors (PPARs)-alpha agonists with ability to decrease triglyceride and increase high density lipoprotein- cholesterol (HDL-C). However, bezafibrate has a unique characteristic profile of action since it activates all three PPAR subtypes (alpha, gamma and delta) at comparable doses. Therefore, bezafibrate operates as a pan-agonist for all three PPAR isoforms. Selective PPAR gamma agonists (thiazolidinediones) are used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). They improve insulin sensitivity by up-regulating adipogenesis, decreasing free fatty acid levels, and reversing insulin resistance. However, selective PPAR gamma agonists also cause water retention, weight gain, peripheral edema, and congestive heart failure. The expression of PPAR beta/ delta in essentially all cell types and tissues (ubiquitous presence) suggests its potential fundamental role in cellular biology. PPAR beta/ delta effects correlated with enhancement of fatty acid oxidation, energy consumption and adaptive thermogenesis. Together, these data implicate PPAR beta/delta in fuel combustion and suggest that pan-PPAR agonists that include a component of PPAR beta/delta activation might offset some of the weight gain issues seen with selective PPAR gamma agonists, as was demonstrated by bezafibrate studies. Suggestively, on the whole body level all PPARs acting as one orchestra and balanced pan-PPAR activation seems as an especially attractive pharmacological goal. Conceptually, combined PPAR gamma and alpha action can target simultaneously insulin resistance and atherogenic dyslipidemia, whereas PPAR beta/delta properties may prevent the development of overweight. Bezafibrate, as all fibrates, significantly reduced plasma triglycerides and increased HDL-C level (but considerably stronger than other major fibrates). Bezafibrate significantly decreased prevalence of small, dense low density lipoproteins particles, remnants, induced atherosclerotic plaque regression in thoracic and abdominal aorta and improved endothelial function. In addition, bezafibrate has important fibrinogen-related properties and anti-inflammatory effects. In clinical trials bezafibrate was highly effective for cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with metabolic syndrome and atherogenic dyslipidemia. The principal differences between bezafibrate and other fibrates are related to effects on glucose level and insulin resistance. Bezafibrate decreases blood glucose level, HbA1C, insulin resistance and reduces the incidence of T2DM compared to placebo or other fibrates. Currently statins are the cornerstone of the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular diseases related to atherosclerosis. However, despite the increasing use of statins as monotherapy for low density lipoprotein- cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction, a significant residual cardiovascular risk is still presented in patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia and insulin resistance, which is typical for T2DM and metabolic syndrome. Recently, concerns were raised regarding the development of diabetes in statin-treated patients. Combined bezafibrate/statin therapy is more effective in achieving a comprehensive lipid control and residual cardiovascular risk reduction. Based on the beneficial effects of pan-PPAR agonist bezafibrate on glucose metabolism and prevention of new-onset diabetes, one could expect a neutralization of the adverse pro-diabetic effect of statins using the strategy of a combined statin/fibrate therapy.", 
    "174": "Nicotine exposure via cigarette smoking and tobacco chewing is associated with vascular complications. The present study investigated the effect of rosuvastatin in nicotine (2 mg/kg/day, i.p., 4 weeks)-induced vascular endothelial dysfunction (VED) in rats. The development of VED was assessed by employing isolated aortic ring preparation and estimating aortic and serum nitrite/nitrate concentration. Further, scanning electron microscopy and hematoxylin-eosin staining of thoracic aorta were performed to assess the vascular endothelial integrity. Moreover, oxidative stress was assessed by estimating aortic superoxide anion generation and serum thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances. The nicotine administration produced VED by markedly reducing acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation, impairing the integrity of vascular endothelium, decreasing aortic and serum nitrite/nitrate concentration, increasing oxidative stress, and inducing lipid alteration. However, treatment with rosuvastatin (10 mg/kg/day, i.p., 4 weeks) markedly attenuated nicotine-induced vascular endothelial abnormalities, oxidative stress, and lipid alteration. Interestingly, the co-administration of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) antagonist, GW9662 (1 mg/kg/day, i.p., 2 weeks) submaximally, significantly prevented rosuvastatin-induced improvement in vascular endothelial integrity, endothelium-dependent relaxation, and nitrite/nitrate concentration in rats administered nicotine. However, GW9662 co-administration did not affect rosuvastatin-associated vascular anti-oxidant and lipid-lowering effects. The incubation of aortic ring, isolated from rosuvastatin-treated nicotine-administered rats, with L-NAME (100 \u03bcM), an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), significantly attenuated rosuvastatin-induced improvement in acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation. Rosuvastatin prevents nicotine-induced vascular endothelial abnormalities by activating PPAR\u03b3 and endothelial NOS signaling pathways. Moreover, the PPAR\u03b3-independent anti-oxidant and lipid-lowering effects of rosuvastatin might additionally play a role in the improvement of vascular endothelial function.",

They are traditionally considered to be cholesterol-lowering agents, but in recent years more and more effects of statins have been revealed, including anti-inflammation, immunomodulation, neuroprotection, improvement of bone metabolism, and antitumour effects. In the past few years, extensive studies have shown that statins can induce autophagy in tumour cells as well as in some normal cells, and autophagy may be involved in the regulation of cancer metastasis. This review is focused on summarising and discussing the relationships among statins, autophagy and cancer metastasis. Studies showed that activation of the AMPK-TOR signalling pathway may be a major mechanism of statin-induced autophagy. Depleting cellular geranylgeranyl diphosphate activates AMPK and inactivates TOR, leading to autophagic responses. Autophagy, a strategy of self-adaption, is a double-edged sword in tumour metastasis. On one hand, autophagy contributes to anti-metastasis activity by, for example, restricting tumour necrosis and inflammatory cell infiltration of tumours and promoting the release of high-mobility group box protein 1 that triggers strong antitumour immune responses. On the other hand, it also exhibits a pro-metastasis activity. In summary, we propose a working hypothesis: statins induce autophagy in cancer cells, and this constitutes, at least in part, the basis for the anti-metastatic effect of statins. The idea that autophagy is responsible for statin-induced anti-metastasis effects is probably novel, and it extends the conventional view that interference of the post-translational modification of Rho GTPases by statins prevents tumour metastasis.",

All patients received a high dose of N-acetylcysteine and sodium bicarbonate solution. Second, we investigated the in vitro effects of atorvastatin pretreatment on CM-mediated modifications of intracellular pathways leading to apoptosis or survival in renal tubular cells. CIAKI (ie, an increase >10% of serum cystatin C concentration within 24 hours after CM exposure) occurred in 9 of 202 patients in the atorvastatin group (4.5%) and in 37 of 208 patients in the control group (17.8%) (P=0.005; odds ratio=0.22; 95% confidence interval, 0.07-0.69). CIAKI rate was lower in the atorvastatin group in both diabetics and nondiabetics and in patients with moderate chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate, 31-60 mL/min per 1.73 m(2)). In the in vitro model, pretreatment with atorvastatin (1) prevented CM-induced renal cell apoptosis by reducing stress kinases activation and (2) restored the survival signals (mediated by Akt and ERK pathways).",

    "189": "Sometimes, drugs and their metabolites in plasma may convert to each other. This phenomenon is called interconversion, which may result in the instability problem of the plasma samples. The instability problem caused by interconversion of the co-existing metabolites may often be ignored, since there is no drug metabolite in the quality control samples prepared for method validation. Pitavastatin lactone (Pi-LAC), a main metabolite of pitavastatin (Pi), is very unstable and easily converted to Pi in plasma. In this paper, simple and rapid LC-ESI-MS/MS methods were developed for the simultaneous determination of Pi and Pi-LAC in human plasma and urine. The sample stability was examined under different conditions. The interconversion of Pi and Pi-LAC was prevented by adding a pH 4.2 buffer solution to the freshly collected plasma samples. Detection was performed using an electrospray ionization (ESI) operating in positive ion multiple reaction monitoring mode by monitoring the ion transitions from m/z 422.2\u2192290.3 (Pi), 404.2\u2192290.3 (Pi-LAC) and m/z 611.3\u2192423.2 (candesartan cilextetil, the internal standard), respectively. The calibration curve of Pi and Pi-LAC in both human plasma and urine showed good linearity over the concentration range of 0.1-200 ng/mL. The established methods were successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study of pitavastatin calcium tablets in healthy Chinese volunteers after oral administration of 1, 2 and 4 mg single and multiple doses of pitavastatin calcium. The pharmacokinetic parameters of Pi and Pi-LAC in Chinese volunteers were given respectively. The urinary excretion profiles of Pi and Pi-LAC in Chinese volunteers were also presented. After receiving a single 4 mg oral dose of pitavastatin calcium, the average cumulative urinary excretion percentages of Pi and Pi-LAC in Chinese volunteers were (0.41 \u00b1 0.16)% and (6.1 \u00b1 5.0)%, respectively.",

Thus, it is difficult to study the effects of the inhibition of various enzymes on the intermediate and final products in the isoprenoid pathway. In fission yeast, antifungal compounds such as azoles and terbinafine are available as inhibitors of the pathway in addition to statins, and various isoprenoid pathway mutants are also available. Here in these mutants, treated with statins or antifungals, we quantified the final and intermediate products of the fission yeast isoprenoid pathway using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry/mass spectrometry. In hmg1-1, a mutant of the gene encoding 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR), ergosterol (a final sterol product), and squalene (an intermediate pathway product), were decreased to approximately 80% and 10%, respectively, compared with that of wild-type cells. Consistently in wild-type cells, pravastatin, an HMGR inhibitor decreased ergosterol and squalene, and the effect was more pronounced on squalene. In hmg1-1 mutant and in wild-type cells treated with pravastatin, the decrease in the levels of farnesyl pyrophosphate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate respectively was larger than that of ergosterol but was smaller than that of squalene. In \u0394erg6 or \u0394sts1 cells, mutants of the genes involved in the last step of the pathway, ergosterol was not detected, and the changes of intermediate product levels were distinct from that of hmg1-1 mutant. Notably, in wild-type cells miconazole and terbinafine only slightly decreased ergosterol level. Altogether, these studies suggest that the pleiotropic phenotypes caused by the hmg1-1 mutation and pravastatin might be due to decreased levels of isoprenoid pyrophosphates or other isoprenoid pathway intermediate products rather than due to a decreased ergosterol level.",

    "237": "The combination of simvastatin with potent antioxidant and phytosterol (such as present in pomegranate) could lead to attenuation of macrophage foam cell formation and atherogenesis.", 
    "238": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of continuous statin treatment on new-onset heart failure (HF) in patients with breast cancer receiving anthracycline-based chemotherapy.", 
    "239": "In vitro and animal model experimental studies have reported that statins prevent doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.", 
    "240": "A total of 628 women with newly diagnosed breast cancer (mean age 51.5 \u00b1 10.8 years) treated with anthracycline were retrospectively identified and studied. The primary outcome (incident HF hospitalization) was compared in propensity-matched patients receiving uninterrupted statin therapy through the follow-up period of 2.55 \u00b1 1.68 years and their counterparts not receiving continuous statin therapy.", 
    "241": "After propensity matching (2:1), the 67 patients (10.7%) receiving uninterrupted statin therapy were combined with 134 controls. New-onset HF was observed in 67 of the 201 matched patients. Multivariate-matched Cox regression analysis showed a significantly lower hazard ratio [HR] of 0.3 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.1 to 0.9; p = 0.03) for patients taking uninterrupted statin therapy. Cardiotoxicity risk factors at the time of cancer diagnosis (HR: 5.0; 95% CI: 2.2 to 11.1; p < 0.001), baseline ejection fraction <55% (HR: 2.7; 95% CI: 1.2 to 6.3; p = 0.02), and trastuzumab use (HR: 3.0; 95% CI: 1.3 to 7.2; p = 0.01) were predictors of incident HF.", 
    "242": "In this analysis of female patients with breast cancer treated with anthracycline chemotherapy, statin use was associated with a lower risk for incident HF. This finding is consistent with prior animal studies and warrants further investigation through prospective randomized clinical trials.", 
    "243": "This study examined the functionality of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in individuals with end-stage renal disease on dialysis (ESRD-HD).", 
    "244": "The high rate of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in chronic kidney disease is not explained by standard risk factors, especially in patients with ESRD-HD who appear resistant to benefits of statin therapy. HDL is antiatherogenic because it extracts tissue cholesterol and reduces inflammation.", 
    "245": "Cellular cholesterol efflux and inflammatory response were assessed in macrophages exposed to HDL of patients with ESRD-HD or controls.", 
    "246": "HDL from patients with ESRD-HD was dramatically less effective than normal HDL in accepting cholesterol from macrophages (median 6.9%; interquartile range [IQR]: 1.4% to 10.2%) versus control (median 14.9%; IQR: 9.8% to 17.8%; p < 0.001). The profound efflux impairment was also seen in patients with ESRD-HD and diabetes compared with patients with diabetes without renal disease (median 8.1%; IQR: 3.3% to 12.9%) versus control (median 13.6%; IQR: 11.0% to 15.9%; p = 0.009). In vitro activation of cellular cholesterol transporters increased cholesterol efflux to both normal and uremic HDL. HDL of patients with ESRD-HD had reduced antichemotactic ability and increased macrophage cytokine response (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, and interleukin-1-beta). HDL of patients with ESRD-HD on statin therapy had reduced inflammatory response while maintaining impaired cholesterol acceptor function. Interestingly, impaired HDL-mediated efflux did not correlate with circulating C-reactive protein levels or cellular inflammatory response.", 
    "247": "These findings suggest that abnormal HDL capacity to mediate cholesterol efflux is a key driver of excess CVD in patients on chronic hemodialysis and may explain why statins have limited effect to decrease CV events. The findings also suggest cellular cholesterol transporters as potential therapeutic targets to decrease CV risk in this population.", 
    "248": "Smoking adversely affects cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality; however the effect of long-term statin treatment in high risk smokers is not entirely clear. The primary endpoint of this post hoc analysis of the GREek Atorvastatin and Coronary Heart Disease Evaluation (GREACE) study (n=1,600 patients with established coronary heart disease, mean follow-up 3-years) was the incidence of major CVD events, a composite of death, myocardial infarction, revascularization, unstable angina, heart failure, and stroke in statin-treated patients (n=880) who continued to smoke (n=129) compared with ex-smokers (n=309) and never smokers (n=442) as well as on patients not treated with a statin (n=720) of all smoking categories. Secondary endpoints were the effect of smoking on chronic kidney disease (CKD) and on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), two major and common independent CVD risk factors.", 
    "249": "Among statin treated patients the hazard ratio (HR) for current smokers compared with never smokers was 1.86 [95% confidence interval-(CI) 1.19-2.10); similar was the HR for current smokers compared with ex-smokers. Absolute (16.3%) and relative (45.6%) CVD risk reduction was great in current smokers on statins compared with those not on a statin; however they still had the highest absolute CVD event incidence (19.4%). Low high density lipoprotein cholesterol and higher triglycerides may account, at least in part, for this. The highest risk of CVD events in any of the 6 groups was in the smokers not on a statin (35.7%). CKD and NAFLD were not negatively affected by smoking and they do not appear to be implicated in the adverse effect of smoking on CVD event rate in patients on a statin.", 
    "250": "Statins reduce CVD morbidity and mortality in current smokers with CVD, but these remain high in terms of absolute incidence compared with ex- and never smokers. CKD and NAFLD are not affected by smoking and do not seem to contribute to this high CVD event incidence. These make smoking cessation imperative in high risk patients even if they are on statins.", 
    "251": "Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) probably plays an important role in the development of acute coronary syndrome (ACS); elevated levels of Lp-PLA2 are associated with a poorer prognosis in patients with ischemic heart disease. Alterations of Lp-PLA2 levels during ACS and its relationship to standard biomarkers are, however, unclear.", 
    "252": "Fifty-one consecutive ACS patients were enrolled in the study. All were managed with early invasive strategy and according to the current guidelines for pharmacotherapy; intensive statin therapy was started in all patients at admission. Serum levels of Lp-PLA2, LDL-cholesterol (LDL), troponin l (Tnl), and C-reactive protein (CRP) were assessed at admission (D0), on the first morning (D1), and on the second morning of hospitalization (D2). Mean serum levels of Lp-PLA2 (ng/mL) decreased from 264.6\u00b119.1 at D0, to 193.2\u00b114.4 at D1 (P < 0.001 vs. D0) and 189.8\u00b122.6 at D2 (P = 0.002 vs. D0; P = not significant vs. D1). Alterations in Lp-PLA2 levels significantly correlated with changes in LDL (r = 0.43; P = 0.008). On the other hand, no relationship between Lp-PLA2 and Tnl or CRP was found.", 
    "253": "Initially, serum levels of Lp-PLA2 were significantly elevated in ACS patients, but decreased within the first 24 hours after admission and subsequently remained stable. Lp-PLA2 levels correlated with LDL levels but not with Tnl or CRP levels. Our results demonstrated dynamic alterations in Lp-PLA2 levels during the early stages of ACS and, therefore, indirectly support the hypothesis of an active role for Lp-PLA2 in the pathogenesis of ACS.", 
    "254": "Hypertension (HTN) and dyslipemia (DYL) are two of the major modifiable cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, determinants in the development of cerebrovascular and coronary heart disease (CHD). Many patients have both risk factors which increase their total CV risk compared with patients with only one risk factor. Treatment guideline recommendations are poorly implemented in real practice, in part due to numerous and complicated drug regimes which hamper patient\u00b4s adherence.", 
    "255": "In this article the authors describe the first combined fixed-dose pill of an antihypertensive and a lipid-lowering agent, the single-pill combination of amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium (SPAA). They summarize the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of both compounds and the main randomized clinical studies, as well as real-world observational studies, made with the new combined formulation.", 
    "256": "The use of the single-pill amlodipine and atorvastatin is an adequate option for the clinician to treat hypertensive patients with DYL or high CV risk burden, with proven efficacy, tolerability, cost-effectiveness, and the advantage of improving patient treatment compliance."
