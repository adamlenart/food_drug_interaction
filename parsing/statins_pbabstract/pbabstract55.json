Repeat intervention was only performed in patients with recurrent symptoms and \u226570% in-stent restenosis (ISR). TLR was defined as need for a repeat percutaneous intervention involving a previously stented area. Freedom from events (ISR and TLR) was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier curves. Cox regression analysis was used to determine the significant predictors of TLR and ISR.", 
    "2": "Index procedures were performed on 139 arteries in 138 patients (69.6% female). Patients were an average age of 64.5 years, with major comorbidities of hypertension (80.4%), hyperlipidemia (72.5%), and tobacco use (60.1%). Also performed during the study period were 24 TLR procedures, resulting 166 SAS interventions attempted for patients with subclavian atherosclerotic disease during a 15-year span. Of 166 procedures, 163 (98.2%) were treated successfully. Stents were placed in all but two index arteries. The main indications for SAS were subclavian steal syndrome (48.9%), arm claudication (21.6%), and coronary steal syndrome (28.8%). The average preprocedure stenosis was 87.2% \u00b1 11.2%. For index procedures (139 arteries), duplex follow-up was available for 134 arteries (96.4%), with an overall ISR rate of 18.7% (25 of 134). Primary patency for the index procedures was 84.7% at 10 years. The overall TLR rate for the index procedures was 12.7% (17 cases). Seven patients required more than one secondary procedure. For all cases, the freedom from ISR was 91%, 77%, and 68% at 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively, and freedom from TLR was 94%, 85%, and 82% at 1, 5, and 10 years, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed the significant predictors of ISR were smoking/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (hazard ratio [HR], 3.2; P = .001), age by decade (HR, 0.5; P < .001), discharged with statin therapy (HR, 0.3; P = .001), vessel diameter \u22647 mm (HR, 2.3; P = .028), and right-sided intervention (HR, 0.3; P = .040). The sole significant predictor of TLR was age by decade (HR, 0.6; P = .008).",

    "4": "The use of beta-blockers therapy has been recommended to reduce mortality in patients with left ventricular dysfunction after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), which has become the mainstay of treatment for AMI, is associated with a lower mortality than fibrinolysis. The benefits of beta-blockers after primary PCI in AMI patients without pump failure are unclear. We hypothesized that oral beta-blocker therapy after primary PCI might reduce the mortality in AMI patients without pump failure. The assessment of lipophilic vs. hydrophilic statin therapy in acute myocardial infarction (ALPS-AMI) study was a multi-center study that enrolled 508 AMI patients to compare the efficacy of hydrophilic and lipophilic statins in secondary prevention after myocardial infarction. We prospectively tracked cardiovascular events for 3\u00a0years in 444 ALPS-AMI patients (median age 66\u00a0years; 18.2\u00a0% women) who had Killip class 1 on admission and were discharged alive. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. The 3-year follow-up was completed in 413 patients (93.0\u00a0%). During this follow-up, 21 patients (4.7\u00a0%) died. In Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients on beta-blockers had a significantly lower incidence of all-cause mortality (2.7 vs. 7.3\u00a0%, log-rank p\u00a0=\u00a00.025). After adjusting for the calculated propensity score for using beta-blockers, their use remained an independent predictor of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 0.309; 95\u00a0% confidence interval 0.116-0.824; p\u00a0=\u00a00.019). In the statin era, the use of beta-blocker therapy after primary PCI is associated with lower mortality in AMI patients with Killip class 1 on admission.",

It was shown, that the developed method allows for the determination of the tested components in a direct manner, despite the apparent interference of the absorption spectra in the UV range. For quantitative determinations, \"zero-crossing\" method was chosen, appropriate wavelengths for zofenopril were: D1 \u03bb=270.85 nm, D2 \u03bb=286.38 nm, D3 \u03bb=253.90 nm. Fluvastatin was determined at wavelengths: D1 \u03bb=339.03 nm, D2 \u03bb=252.57 nm, D3 \u03bb=258.50 nm, respectively. The method was characterized by high sensitivity and accuracy, for zofenopril LOD was in the range of 0.19-0.87 \u03bcg mL(-1), for fluvastatin 0.51-1.18 \u03bcg mL(-1), depending on the class of derivative, and for zofenopril and fluvastatin LOQ was 0.57-2.64 \u03bcg mL(-1) and 1.56-3.57 \u03bcg mL(-1), respectively. The recovery of individual components was within the range of 100\u00b15%.

Prescription of aspirin was lower in men from high SES neighborhoods (OR (95% CI): 0.75 (0.65-0.86)) than in those from middle SES neighborhoods. Higher CHADS2 risk scores were associated with higher warfarin prescription which remained after adjustment for neighborhood SES.",

A polymorphism affecting the gene encoding glycine amidinotransferase (GATM rs9806699 G > A) was previously associated with reduced risk for SIM. Our objective was to replicate the GATM association in a large, multicenter SIM case-control study. Mild and severe SIM cases and age- and gender-matched controls were enrolled. Participants were genotyped, and associations were tested (n = 715) using chi-square and logistic regression with consideration for SIM severity and exclusion of subjects with potentially confounding comedications. The minor allele (A) frequencies of GATM rs9806699 in the controls (n = 106), mild SIM (n = 324), and severe SIM (n = 285) cases were 0.26, 0.28, and 0.29, respectively (p = 0.447). The unadjusted odds ratio for the A allele for any SIM (mild or severe) was 1.14 (0.82-1.61; p = 0.437), which remained nonsignificant in all models.

We distinguish two types of disease-mongering according to the way they exploit the definition of the trial population for marketing purposes. We argue that behind these two forms of disease-mongering there are two well-known problems in the statistical methodology of clinical trials (the reference class problem and the distinction between statistical and clinical significance). Overcoming them is far from simple.", 
    "12": "The mevalonate pathway plays an important role in cancer biology and has been targeted with farnesyl transferase inhibitors, although their efficacy is limited due to significant adverse effects. Statins and bisphosphonates inhibit the mevalonate pathway at different steps, thus having negative effects at various levels on cancer cells. A combination of these drugs may result in an amplified cytotoxic effect and allow for use of significantly lower doses of the drugs involved. Statins inhibit the mevalonate pathway at 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and bisphosphonates at farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase. Our results show that low-dose combinations of simvastatin and alendronate have a synergistic cytotoxic effect on androgen-independent prostate cancer PC-3 cells, but not on androgen-dependent LNCaP or DU 145 prostate cancer cells. These two drugs cause a sequential blockade of the mevalonate pathway and significantly affect survival and apoptotic pathways by down-regulating phospho-AKT and activating c-JUN and ERK.",

However, aging causes progressive decline in their number and smaller diameters in those that remain (collateral rarefaction), beginning at 16 months of age in mice (i.e., middle age), and worse ischemic injury-effects that are accelerated in even 3-month-old eNOS(-/-) mice.

Hypertension caused collateral rarefaction whose severity increased with duration and level of hypertension, accompanied by greater hindlimb ischemia and cerebral infarct volume. Chronic treatment of wild-type mice with L-N (G)-nitro-arginine methylester caused similar rarefaction and worse ischemic injury which were not prevented by lowering arterial pressure with hydralazine. Metabolic syndrome, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes mellitus, and obesity also caused collateral rarefaction. Neither chronic statin treatment nor exercise training lessened hypertension-induced rarefaction.",

An abnormally high plasma level of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol is a major contributor to ACVD, an effect that can be attenuated by cholesterol-lowering therapies, particularly statins. A new class of drugs, the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, will add another option for further reducing cardiovascular events in patients at high risk of ACVD, including those with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) and intolerance to statins.

    "24": "Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) has been reported to increase platelet activation. Reducing the level of LDL-C with statins induces important pleiotropic effects such as platelet inhibition. This association between platelet activity and statin therapy may be clinically important in reducing the risk of ischemic stroke. We investigated the effect of simvastatin therapy on platelet activation markers (platelet CD62P, sP-selectin, and platelet-derived microparticles (PDMPs)) in hyperlipidemic patients after ischemic stroke.", 
    "25": "The study group consisted of 21 hyperlipidemic patients after ischemic stroke confirmed by CT, and 20 healthy subjects served as controls. We assessed the CD62P expression on resting and thrombin-activated blood platelets. CD62P and PDMPs were analyzed by the use of monoclonal antibodies anti-CD61 and anti-CD62 on a flow cytometer. The level of sP-selectin in serum was measured by the ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) method. All markers were re-analyzed after 6 months of treatment with simvastatin (20 mg/day).",

The Heart Protection Study showed that statins reduced mortality and major cardiovascular events in high-risk persons regardless of the initial level of serum lipids, age, or gender. The updated National Cholesterol Education Program III guidelines state that in very high-risk persons, a serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level of < 70 mg/dl (1.8 mmol/l) is a reasonable clinical strategy for moderately high-risk persons (2 or more risk factors and a 10-year risk for coronary artery disease of 10% to 20%), and the serum LDL cholesterol should be reduced to < 100 mg/dl (2.6 mmol/l). When LDL cholesterol-lowering drug therapy is used to treat high-risk persons or moderately high-risk persons, the serum LDL cholesterol should be reduced by at least 30% to 40%. The serum LDL cholesterol should be decreased to less than 160 mg/dl in persons at low risk for cardiovascular disease. Addition of other lipid-lowering drugs to statin therapy has not been demonstrated to further reduce cardiovascular events and mortality.", 
    "29": "Statins are one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in clinical practice. They are usually well tolerated and effectively prevent cardiovascular events. Most adverse effects associated with statin therapy are muscle-related. The recent statement of the European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) has focused on statin associated muscle symptoms (SAMS), and avoided the use of the term 'statin intolerance'. Although muscle syndromes are the most common adverse effects observed after statin therapy, excluding other side effects might underestimate the number of patients with statin intolerance, which might be observed in 10-15% of patients. In clinical practice, statin intolerance limits effective treatment of patients at risk of, or with, cardiovascular disease. Knowledge of the most common adverse effects of statin therapy that might cause statin intolerance and the clear definition of this phenomenon is crucial to effectively treat patients with lipid disorders. Therefore, the aim of this position paper was to suggest a unified definition of statin intolerance, and to complement the recent EAS statement on SAMS, where the pathophysiology, diagnosis and the management were comprehensively presented.",

Nonetheless, the frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and their impact can vary due to ethnicity. Because the Chilean population carries a strong Amerindian background, the objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of apolipoprotein E (APOE) variants (rs429358, rs7412) and the 1959C>T SNP (rs5925) in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) in response to atorvastatin treatment in hypercholesterolemic individuals. A hundred and thirty nine subjects undergoing statin therapy were included. Identification of Amerindian mtDNA haplogroups was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and PCR followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), respectively. SNPs were determined by PCR-RFLP. Out of the 139 individuals studied, 84.4% had an Amerindian background, according to mtDNA analysis. In relation to APOE variants, carriers of the E3/4 genotype presented lower cholesterol reduction compared to genotype E3/3 (LDL-C: -18% vs. -29%, p \u02c2 0.001). On the other hand, the LDLR rs5925 SNP was not related to atorvastatin response (p = 0.5760).

The results were sensitive to statin effectiveness, particularly statins' effect on all-cause mortality, and cost of statin medication. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that the probability of statin treatment being cost-effective was 72% at a willingness-to-pay threshold of SGD 65,000 (USD 49,546) per QALY gained. Shortening the time horizon from lifetime to 10 years (simulating limited life expectancy) considerably increased the ICER to SGD 291,313 (USD 167,171) per QALY.

One in 5 Americans will be diagnosed with this condition during their lifetime, including up to 60% of people with diabetes. Currently there is no cure for neuropathy. Treatment options are quite minimal, geared towards relieving symptoms with medications, but often no treatment of any kind is offered to patients. This study is a retrospective review of 48 charts of patients treated for PN from January 2008 through June 2010 at the Integrative Center for Healing in Cincinnati, Ohio. Treatment of neuropathy used high volt pulsed current (HVPC) electrical stimulation (MicroVas, MTI, Tulsa, OK), with a secondary therapy of stopping statin medication. Symptoms evaluated were pain, numbness, and condition of a wound, if present. With an average of 23 treatments, a statistically significant 83% of patients had improvement in at least 1 symptom.

PCSK9 reduces LDL receptor recycling, leading to a decrease of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) receptors on the surface of hepatocytes and a subsequent increase of circulating LDL-C levels. In observational studies, the loss-of-function mutations of PCSK9 have been associated with a reduction of LDL-C levels and cardiovascular disease (CVD) events. In contrast, humans with high levels of PCSK9 have higher level of plasma LDL-C and significantly enhanced CVD risk during their lifetime, gain-of-function mutations on PCSK9 are, for instance, causatively associated with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH). Inhibition of PCSK9 is therefore a promising therapeutic option for the lowering of LDL-C levels. The clinical development of human monoclonal antibodies against PCSK9 has progressed, with promising results reported from phase 2 clinical studies in patients with FH or intolerant to statin with LDL-C levels not on target levels. Phase I studies demonstrated safety and efficacy. In phase II, a 60%-70% reduction in LDL-C was observed, especially when subcutaneous injections were performed regularly every two weeks. No significant side effects were observed, with the exception of injection site reactions. Three large phase III programmes with the new anti PCSK9 antibodies are currently underway in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and LDL-C inadequately controlled by standard treatments.

Between 1991-92 and 2011-12, mean total cholesterol declined from 5.86 mmol/L (95% CI: 5.82-5.90) to 5.17 mmol/L (95% CI: 5.14-5.20). For 2011-12, mean total cholesterol was lower in more deprived groups. In our 'no statins' scenario we predicted a mean total cholesterol of 5.36 mmol/L (95% CI: 5.33-5.40) for 2011-12. Statins were responsible for approximately 33.7% (95% UI: 28.9-38.8%) of the total cholesterol reduction since 1991-92. The statin contribution to cholesterol reduction was greater among the more deprived groups of women, while showing little socio-economic gradient among men.",

Simvastatin inhibited 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase, which in turn activated PI3K-kinase. Downstream of this signaling, PI3K-dependent phosphorylation of the transcription factor Foxo1 at key amino acids inhibited its ability to shuttle to the nucleus and bind cis-elements in the angiopoietin-2 promoter. In septic mice, transient inhibition of angiopoietin-2 expression by liposomal siRNA in vivo improved absolute survival by 50%. Simvastatin had a similar effect, but the combination of angiopoietin-2 siRNA and simvastatin showed no additive benefit. To verify the link between statins and angiopoietin-2 in humans, we performed a pilot matched case-control study and a small randomized placebo-controlled trial demonstrating beneficial effects on angiopoietin-2.",

We retrospectively analyzed 438 cART treated PLWH from the Nutrition For Healthy Living (NFHL) cohort to determine the association between statins and myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, and all-cause mortality as a composite. We used Cox proportional hazards regression as our main analysis. The average age was 44 years, 32% were women, and 67 of the 438 subjects used statins. There was no association between statins and our composite endpoint in two separate models [1.26 (0.57-2.79) in statin history model and 0.93 (0.65-1.32) per year in statin duration model]. The composite outcome was significantly associated with CD4 count, age, and smoking status in both models. CD4 count remained significant even after exclusion of mortality from the composite (HR=0.88, p=0.02). Confounding control via propensity scoring and multiple imputations did not change the results. Statins did not have an effect on MI, stroke, and mortality. Interestingly, CD4 count appears to be an important predictor of these outcomes, even after exclusion of death from the composite.",

The remaining three studies were randomized controlled trials that evaluated response to therapy based on dosage-based algorithms among patients with pharmacogenetic test results. Carriers of the CYP2C9 gene variant alleles *2 or *3 had lower mean maintenance warfarin dose requirements than did non-carriers. Few studies investigated the relationship between genetic variations in CYP2C9 or VKORC1 and warfarin dose requirements in the induction phase. CYP2C9 variants were associated with an increased rate of bleeding complications during the induction phase of warfarin therapy, but the studies did not report whether affected patients had normal or supratherapeutic INR ranges. As with the CYP2C9 variants, carriers of the three common VKORC1 variants (alleles T, G, and C) required lower mean maintenance doses of warfarin than did non-carriers. Studies of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 had significant between-study heterogeneity. Few studies evaluated the relationship between pharmacogenetic test results and patient- and disease-related factors or response to therapy. No study addressed how therapeutic choices affected the benefits, harms, or adverse effects of patients from subsequent therapeutic management after pharmacogenetic testing for CYP2C9 and VKORC1. APO E GENOTYPE AND STATIN TREATMENT: In studies of the Apo E genotype (e2 carriers, e3 homozygotes, and e4 carriers) and statin treatment, the pooled reduction in total and LDL cholesterol from baseline values was lower for all three genotypes but did not differ significantly among them. These studies also had significant between-study heterogeneity. Although few studies included certain subgroups, factors that may affect the associations between all three Apo E genotypes and response to statin therapy were ethnicity, sex, familial hyperlipidemia, the type of statin used, and possibly the presence of diabetes. No studies addressed the effects of therapeutic choice: there were no data on the benefits, harms, or adverse effects on patients from subsequent therapeutic management after pharmacogenetic testing for the three Apo E genotypes.

Total and LDL cholesterol levels among patients on statin therapy were lower than baseline values among patients with the three ApoE genotypes. Response to chemotherapy based on the folate metabolic pathway in solid organ cancers was not associated with genetic variations in MTHFR. Overall, studies evaluating associations between the pharmacogenetic test results and the patient\u2019s response to therapy for non-cancer and cancer conditions showed considerable variation in study designs, study populations, medication dosages, and the type of medications. This variation warrants caution when interpreting our results.

The case presented is a 63-year-old woman who has continued elevation of creatine kinase (CK) after discontinuation of statin therapy. She has irritable myopathy on EMG and NAM is confirmed by muscle biopsy. She subsequently tests positive for an experimental anti-3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (anti-HMGCoA) antibody that is found to be present in patients with statin-associated NAM. Though statin-associated NAM is a relatively rare entity, it is an important consideration for the general internist in patients who continue to have CK elevation and weakness after discontinuation of statin therapy.

Streptozotocin-treated rats showed a significant increase in the levels of blood pressure, serum glucose, triglycerides, total cholesterol and thiobarbituric acid reactive substance as well as a significant decrease in the levels of serum insulin, high density lipoprotein and reduced glutathione in pancreatic tissues. Administration of metformin plus atorvastatin for a period of 14 days significantly improved these biochemical parameters near to normal.

Direct blockade of geranylgeranyl transferase I by GGTI-286, treatment with the Rac inhibitor NSC23766 or silencing of the geranylgeranylated GTPase Rac2 by siRNA closely mimicked the action of atorvastatin. In contrast, inactivation of other geranylgeranylated proteins such as RhoA, RhoB, and RhoC or Rac1 did not affect PTX3 release. In addition, we found that atorvastatin also decreased PTX3 secretion in aortic SMCs through a mechanism likely dependent on protein geranylgeranylation, while no effect was observed in monocytes. Finally, we found that atherosclerotic lesions from cholesterol-fed rabbits treated with atorvastatin (2.5 mg/kg/day for 8 weeks) showed less immunoreactive PTX3 than lesions from control animals.",

    "88": "Despite its gradual increase in the past several decades, the prevalence of atherosclerotic vascular disease is low in Japan. This is largely attributed to difference in lifestyle, especially food and dietary habits, and it may be reflected in certain clinical parameters. Plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, a strong counter risk for atherosclerosis, are indeed high among the Japanese. Accordingly, lower HDL seems to contribute more to the development of coronary heart disease (CHD) than an increase in non-HDL lipoproteins at a population level in Japan. Interestingly, average HDL levels in Japan have increased further in the past two decades, and are markedly higher than in Western populations. The reasons and consequences for public health of this increase are still unknown. Simulation for the efficacy of raising HDL cholesterol predicts a decrease in CHD of 70% in Japan, greater than the extent by reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol predicted by simulation or achieved in a statin trial. On the other hand, a substantial portion of hyperalphalipoproteinemic population in Japan is accounted for by genetic deficiency of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), which is also commonly unique in East Asian populations. It is still controversial whether CETP mutations are antiatherogenic. Hepatic Schistosomiasis is proposed as a potential screening factor for historic accumulation of CETP deficiency in East Asia.",

Within ERCHIVES, we identified those who received HCV treatment and a follow-up of >24 months after treatment completion. We excluded those with human immunodeficiency virus coinfection, hepatitis B surface antigen positivity, cirrhosis, and HCC at baseline. Our main outcomes were liver fibrosis progression measured by FIB-4 scores, SVR rates, and incident HCC (iHCC). Among 7,248 eligible subjects, 46% received statin therapy.

Numerous studies have shown their beneficial effects in prevention of cardiovascular disease through cholesterol-lowering and anti-atherosclerotic properties. Although some statin patients may experience muscle-related symptoms, severe side effects of statin therapy are rare, primarily due to extensive first-pass metabolism in the liver. Skeletal muscles appear to be the main site of side effects; however, recently some statin-related adverse effects have been described in tendon. The mechanism behind these side effects remains unknown. This is the first study that explores tendon-specific effects of statins in human primary tenocytes. The cells were cultured with different concentrations of lovastatin for up to 1 week. No changes in cell viability or morphology were observed in tenocytes incubated with therapeutic doses. Short-term exposure to lovastatin concentrations outside the therapeutic range had no effect on tenocyte viability; however, cell migration was reduced. Simvastatin and atorvastatin, two other drug family members, also reduced the migratory properties of the cells. Prolonged exposure to high concentrations of lovastatin induced changes in cytoskeleton leading to cell rounding and decreased levels of mRNA for matrix proteins, but increased BMP-2 expression. Gap junctional communication was impaired but due to cell shape change and separation rather than direct gap junction inhibition. These effects were accompanied by inhibition of prenylation of Rap1a small GTPase. Collectively, we showed that statins in a dose-dependent manner decrease migration of human tendon cells, alter their expression profile and impair the functional network, but do not inhibit gap junction function.",

The primary outcome was defined by the composite of 2-year major cardiac events including cardiac death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, percutaneous coronary intervention, and coronary artery bypass grafting after hospital discharge. At 2 years, major cardiac events occurred in 139 patients (10.7%). Compared with <50% LDL-C reduction from baseline, patients with \u2265 50% LDL-C reduction had a 47% risk reduction in major cardiac events (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.53; 95% confidence interval, 0.36 to 0.79; P=0.002). But, compared with LDL-C levels \u2265 70 mg/dL at 1 year, patients with LDL-C levels < 70 mg/dL at 1 year had a similar risk of major cardiac events (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.96; 95% confidence interval, 0.68 to 1.34; P=0.793).",

Some recent studies suggest an important role associated with the use of antineoplastic atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, the statins most widely used today. In this study, the Drosophila wing spot test was used to evaluate possible protective effects of atorvastatin and rosuvastatin against damage induced by DXR. Larvae were chronically treated with negative control (ethanol 5%), positive control (DXR 0.125\u2009mg/mL) and five different concentrations of atorvastatin and rosuvastatin. The results demonstrated absence of a mutagenic effect for the two statins tested. The analysis of the descendants co-treated with DXR and atorvastatin/rosuvastatin revealed a modulatory effect of these statins on damage induced by DXR. This effect was verified in all concentrations tested in the descendants of the ST and HB crosses treated with rosuvastatin, and only in descendants of the HB cross treated with atorvastatin. Induction of apoptosis and antioxidant activity appear to be the main mechanisms involved in reducing the frequency of mutant spots and consequent modulation of the damage induced by DXR.",

The purpose of this study was to examine whether initiation of statins before CABG reduces the risk of postoperative AF. We searched for clinical trials that randomized patients who underwent CABG to preoperative statin therapy versus placebo. We required that the trial reported the incidence of postoperative AF. Random-effects summary odds ratio (OR) were constructed. Sensitivity analysis for the trials that reported AF as a primary outcome along with subgroup analyses according to the different statins used was also conducted. Twelve trials with 2,980 patients met our inclusion criteria. Atorvastatin was tested in 8 trials, whereas rosuvastatin was studied in 2 studies. Statins were associated with a lower risk of postoperative AF (OR 0.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.27 to 0.66, p <0.0001).

Characteristics of these drug-induced gingival overgrowth lesions differ. We evaluate the ability of a mouse model to mimic human phenytoin-induced gingival overgrowth and assess the ability of a drug to prevent its development. Lovastatin was chosen based on previous analyses of tissue-specific regulation of CCN2 production in human gingival fibroblasts and the known roles of CCN2 in promoting fibrosis and epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Data indicate that anterior gingival tissue overgrowth occurred in phenytoin-treated mice based on gross tissue observations and histomorphometry of tissue sections. Molecular markers of epithelial plasticity and fibrosis were regulated by phenytoin in gingival epithelial tissues and in connective tissues similar to that seen in humans. Lovastatin attenuated epithelial gingival tissue growth in phenytoin-treated mice and altered the expressions of markers for epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Data indicate that phenytoin-induced gingival overgrowth in mice mimics molecular aspects of human gingival overgrowth and that lovastatin normalizes the tissue morphology and the expression of the molecular markers studied. Data are consistent with characterization of phenytoin-induced human gingival overgrowth in vivo and in vitro characteristics of cultured human gingival epithelial and connective tissue cells. Findings suggest that statins may serve to prevent or attenuate phenytoin-induced human gingival overgrowth, although specific human studies are required.",

During development of joint guidelines released in 2013 by the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart Association (AHA), the decision was taken to develop a new risk score. This resulted in the ACC/AHA Pooled Cohort Equations Risk Calculator. This risk calculator, based on major National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute-funded cohort studies, is designed to predict 10-year risk of 'hard' atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events, namely, nonfatal myocardial infarction, fatal coronary heart disease, nonfatal, or fatal stroke. Considerable strengths are its inclusion of stroke as an\u00a0end point and race as a characteristic, which allows better risk prediction especially in African-American individuals, plus provision of lifetime ASCVD risk estimates for adults aged 20-59 years. Notable omissions from the risk factors include chronic kidney disease and any measure of social deprivation. An early criticism of the Pooled Cohort Equations Risk Calculator has been its alleged overestimation of ASCVD risk which, if confirmed in the general population, is likely to result in statin therapy being prescribed to many individuals at lower risk than the intended 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk threshold for treatment in the joint ACC/AHA cholesterol guidelines. In this review we discuss the development of the new risk calculator, its strengths and weaknesses, and potential implications for its routine use.",

The aim of this work is to contribute in the characterization of the neuroprotective effect of lovastatin in a model of PD induced by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP(+)). Male Wistar rats (200-250 g) were randomly allocated into 4 groups and administered for 7 days with different pharmacological treatments. Lovastatin administration (5 mg/kg) diminished 40% of the apomorphine-induced circling behavior, prevented the striatal DA depletion and lipid peroxides formation by MPP(+) intrastriatal injection, as compared to the group of animals treated only with MPP(+).

The surface becomes convoluted, forming folia that have a characteristic internal structure of three layers including molecular, Purkinje cell, and granular layer. This complex neural network gives rise to a massive signal-processing capability. Cholesterol is a major constituent, derived by de novo synthesis and the blood-brain barrier. Cholesterol is tightly regulated between neurons and glia-that is, astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes-and is essential for normal brain development. The axon is wrapped by myelin (cholesterol, phospholipids, and glycosphingolipids) and made up of membranes of oligodendrocytes, separated by periodic gaps in the myelin sheath, called nodes of Ranvier. Hypercholesterolemia is associated with increased oxidative stress and the development of neurotoxicity and Alzheimer's disease. Treatment with natural products has been found to support improved brain function and reduce low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol level. Fish oil is one such product; among the many plant products are: Morus alba leaves, fruit, and bark; pomegranate fruit and peel; Barley \u03b2 - glucans; date palm; and Allium sativum.

In many statin trials the incidence of DM2 has not been systematically evaluated and others the power to detect differences between statins is lacking. Evidence highest quality available comes from the meta-analysis of controlled clinical trials. The only controlled clinical trial to evaluate the incidence of new-onset T2DM is the J-PREDICT conducted with pitavastatin in patients with abnormal glucose tolerance. Preliminary results of this study show that pitavastatin is associated with a significant decrease in the incidence of de novo T2DM compared to only modification lifestyle.

Statin assignment in the latter group occurs only in those with an estimated \u22657.5% 10-year atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk after shared decision making in a clinician-patient risk discussion. However, in numerous studies, statin nonadherence shows little or no benefit in reducing cardiovascular events or mortality compared to placebo, effectively negating the risk reduction expected from statin use and concomitantly increasing the total cost of health care. The causes and solutions for nonadherence are multifactorial and include patient, clinician, and health system factors. We believe that a clinician-patient partnership that facilitates patients' understanding of the potential for optimal benefit with the least adverse effects is an important first step toward improving adherence. A transtheoretical model of stages of behavior change helps clinicians address many of the common factors limiting adherence to statins. We conclude with a teaching tool emphasizing a structured approach to statin therapy with patient-centered risk discussions.", 
    "222": "Deposition of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) peptides into specific encephalic structures has been pointed as an important event related to Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis and associated with activation of glial cells, neuroinflammation, oxidative responses, and cognitive deficits. A\u03b2-induced pro-oxidative damage may regulate the activity of glutamate transporters, leading to reduced glutamate uptake and, as a consequence, excitotoxic events. Herein, we evaluated the effects of the pretreatment of atorvastatin, a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, on behavioral and biochemical alterations induced by a single intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of aggregated A\u03b21-40 in mice. Atorvastatin (10\u00a0mg/kg/day, p.o.) was administered through seven consecutive days before A\u03b21-40 administration. A\u03b21-40 caused significant cognitive impairment in the object-place recognition task (2\u00a0weeks after the i.c.v. injection) and this phenomenon was abolished by atorvastatin pretreatment. Ex vivo evaluation of glutamate uptake into hippocampal and cerebral cortices slices showed atorvastatin, and A\u03b21-40 decreased hippocampal and cortical Na(+)-dependent glutamate uptake. However, A\u03b21-40 increased Na(+)-independent glutamate uptake and it was prevented by atorvastatin in prefrontal cortex slices. Moreover, A\u03b21-40 treatment significantly increased the cerebrocortical activities of glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase and these events were blunted by atorvastatin pretreatment. Reduced or oxidized glutathione levels were not altered by A\u03b21-40 and/or atorvastatin treatment. These results extend the notion of the protective action of atorvastatin against neuronal toxicity induced by A\u03b21-40 demonstrating that a pretreatment with atorvastatin prevents the spatial learning and memory deficits induced by A\u03b2 in rodents and promotes changes in glutamatergic and antioxidant systems mainly in prefrontal cortex.", 
    "223": "Statins have been shown to decrease depressive symptoms in certain groups of patients, an effect that is mostly attributed to their anti-inflammatory and neurotransmitter modulatory potentials. We aimed to investigate the antidepressant effects of simvastatin as an adjuvant therapy in patients with moderate to severe depression. In this double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial, 48 patients were randomly allocated to receive simvastatin or placebo as an adjunct to fluoxetine for six weeks. Patients were evaluated with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) at baseline and weeks 2, 4 and 6. Probable clinical and laboratory adverse events were also monitored and compared between the two groups. Simvastatin-treated patients experienced significantly more reductions in HDRS scores compared to the placebo group by the end of the trial (p=0.02). Early improvement and response rates were significantly greater in the simvastatin group than the placebo group (p=0.02 and p=0.01, respectively) but remission rate was not significantly different between the two groups (p=0.36). No serious adverse event was reported during this trial. In conclusion, simvastatin seems to be a safe and effective adjuvant therapy for patients suffering from major depressive disorder. However, more confirmatory studies are warranted.",

One patient with fibromyalgia underwent several explorations to find a muscular pathology; another, who had elevated CK-MB (muscle-brain fraction) activity, was referred to a cardiologist, and statin therapy was erroneously discontinued in two patients. Two patients had macro-CK type 2: a man with a neuroendocrine carcinoma and a woman with rheumatoid arthritis. Diagnosis of type 1 obviates the need to carry out pointless and expensive investigations seeking a neuromuscular or cardiac pathology, and also, the unwarranted discontinuation of statin therapy. Type 2 must prompt investigations for a neoplasm.", 
    "225": "Rhabdomyolysis is a rare, but serious complication of statin therapy, and represents the most severe end of the spectrum of statin-induced myotoxicity. We report a case where coenzyme Q10 facilitated recovery from statin-induced rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure, which had initially persisted despite statin cessation and haemodialysis. This observation is biologically plausible due to the recognised importance of coenzyme Q10 in mitochondrial bioenergetics within myocytes, and the fact that statins inhibit farnesyl pyrophosphate production, a biochemical step crucial for coenzyme Q10 synthesis. Coenzyme Q10 is generally well tolerated, and may potentially benefit patients with statin-induced rhabdomyolysis.",

One hundred sixteen patients with stable CAD were administered placebo/T. arjuna (500 mg twice a day) along with medications in a randomized, double-blind clinical trial. To understand the specificity and efficacy of T. arjuna, we evaluated its effect through microarray and in silico analysis in few representative samples. Data was further validated via real-time PCR (n = 50) each at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months, respectively. rIL-18 cytokine was used to induce inflammation in vitro to compare its effects with atorvastatin. T. arjuna significantly down-regulated TG, VLDL-C, and immuno-inflammatory markers in stable CAD versus placebo-treated subjects. Microarray and pathway analysis of a few samples from T. arjuna/placebo-treated groups and real-time PCR validation further confirmed our observations. Our data demonstrate the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects of T. arjuna that may attenuate ongoing inflammation and immune imbalance in medicated CAD subjects.", 
    "227": "MicroRNAs (miRs) are small non-coding regulatory RNAs that control gene expression. They are involved in the pathogenesis of several diseases, including vascular and cardiac diseases. Their involvement is related to alterations of lipid metabolism, endothelial dysfunction, vascular smooth muscle cell phenotype, atherosclerosis-related low-grade inflammation of the arteries, cardiac hypertrophy or remodelling and heart failure. The manipulation of miRs may eventually be used to prevent or treat vascular or cardiac disease. Available drugs (some statins and renin-angiotensin-system inhibitors, alone or in combination) have beneficial off-target effects mediated through miRs; thus, these drugs may have advantages over other regimens. Inhibition of overexpression of \"unfavourable\" miRs can be potentially accomplished by silencing them with antisense oligonucleotides, masking, sponges, erasers or decoys. In contrast, down-regulation of \"protective\" miRs can be tackled by the administration of miR mimics. These approaches may represent a new therapeutic approach to vascular disease; miR manipulation research started recently and is developing rapidly. There is still a long way to go before clinical implementation; at present only one study is in phase II. Thus, the therapeutic manipulation of miRs is not yet the philosopher stone for the prevention or treatment of vascular or cardiac diseases. More research is needed.",

Single-vessel disease was more common in women (44.9 vs. 39.7%; P = 0.023) and, conversely, multivessel disease was more prevalent in male patients as compared with their female counterparts (59.4 vs. 54.4%; P = 0.029). At discharge, men were more likely prescribed statins (89.4 vs. 85.2%; P = 0.004). Overall mortality and MACCEs were similar for both genders. In women, peak creatine kinase and peak C-reactive protein emerged as independent predictors for MACCEs and SBP on admission, and maximal C-reactive protein and use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (GPIIb/IIIa) as strong independent predictors for in-hospital death.",

Nearly 92% of participants had detectable circulating hsTnI, and 2.9% of men and 4.1% of women had levels above proposed sex-specific reference limits of 36 and 15 ng/L, respectively. hsTnI concentrations in the highest tertile were associated with a first major cardiovascular event (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 2.19; 95% confidence interval, 1.56-3.06; P for trend <0.001). BNP levels in the highest tertile were also associated a first cardiovascular event (aHR, 1.94; 95% confidence interval, 1.41-2.68; P for trend <0.001).
