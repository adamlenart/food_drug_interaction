To illustrate the importance of angiogenesis in islet engraftment, we took a loss-of-function approach to block angiogenesis in newly transplanted islets and determined the extent of islet engraftment in correlation with islet mass and glycemic control in diabetic recipient mice. Diabetic mice were transplanted with a marginal mass of 200 islets under the renal capsule, followed by once-daily oral administration of saline or 150 mg/kg of C-statin, a potent angiogenic inhibitor, for 14 days. Blood glucose profiles and the amplitude of glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in engrafted islets were determined. At 30 days posttransplant, islet grafts were retrieved for the determination of insulin content and vascular density by immunohistochemistry. When compared to sham-treated controls, diabetic recipient mice receiving a daily oral dose of C-statin exhibited significantly impaired blood glucose profiles and diminished glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in response to glucose challenge, correlating with significantly reduced intragraft insulin content and vascular density. Selective inhibition of angiogenesis was associated with reduced islet mass in diabetic mice. These data extend our view that rapid onset of angiogenesis is crucial for islet survival and engraftment and support the development of therapeutic strategies to stimulate angiogenesis in newly implanted islets for enhancing islet engraftment and improving the outcome of marginal islet transplantation.", 
    "1": "The inhibitors of HMG CoA reductase (statins) are widely used as cholesterol-lowering drugs with excellent safety records in hypercholesterolemic patients. Statins exert pleiotropic effects on a variety of cells, and they were recently described as a new class of immune modulators. Depending on their structure, dose, and route of administration, statins regulate the function of both the antigen-presenting cells and T-cells by HMG CoA reductase-dependent and independent mechanisms. Herein, we describe these mechanisms leading to prevention, amelioration, and reversal of autoimmune diseases. We also present data from our laboratories showing for the first time that in a double transgenic mouse model for autoimmune diabetes, atorvastatin (lipitor) prevented the onset of disease when administered in the neonatal period, and stabilized the glucose levels when administered in mice developing a mild form of diabetes.", 
    "2": "We studied the effects of 5 microM atorvastatin, 2 microM rosiglitazone and their combination on intracellular cholesterol levels and on the expression of genes controlling cholesterol trafficking in human monocytes during their differentiation into macrophages. Our results show that treatment with rosiglitazone caused an increase in CD36 mRNA and protein levels (2.7- and 2.9-fold, P<0.001), but significantly induced the expression of most genes related to cholesterol efflux: ABCA1 mRNA (23%, P<0.05) and protein (2.4-fold, P<0.05), apo E protein (2.4-fold, P<0.05), caveolin-1 mRNA (2.6-fold, P<0.001) and SR-BI mRNA (1.9-fold, P<0.001) and protein (3-fold, P<0.01). As a consequence, rosiglitazone treatment reduced intracellular free cholesterol levels by 22% (P<0.01). Treatment with 5 microM atorvastatin caused the opposite effect on the expression of cholesterol efflux-related genes, which was generally reduced: ABCA1 mRNA (71%, P<0.05), apo E mRNA (46%, P<0.001) and protein (5.6-fold, P<0.001), and CYP27 mRNA (15%, P<0.05). Despite these reductions, intracellular total and free cholesterol levels were also reduced by 30% (P<0.01), an effect that can be attributed to the inhibition of de novo cholesterol synthesis by the statins. The combination of rosiglitazone with atorvastatin attenuated CD36 induction, and caused reductions similar to those caused by the statin alone on the expression of genes involved in cholesterol efflux and on intracellular cholesterol levels.", 
    "3": "Statins are used as first-line drugs against hypercholesterolemia after heart transplantation. Randomized clinical trials have shown that they reduce cholesterol levels, and the incidence of rejection and coronary vasculopathy. Adverse effects have been related to the use of certain statins, high statin dosages, comorbidities, and coadministration with cyclosporine. However, estimation of the risk of adverse effects for a given patient is difficult. The aims of this study were to determine the incidence of various kinds of adverse effect of statins; to evaluate certain potential risk factors; and to assess the efficacy of early response to signs of adverse effects.", 
    "4": "Between April 1991 and December 2003, we retrospectively evaluated 336 heart transplant patients (including 55 women) with regard to the occurrence of possible adverse effects of statins (rhabdomyolysis, myalgia, hepatotoxicity, high CK without muscle symptoms, and others). Resolution on reduction of dosage or discontinuance and/or change of statin were deemed to constitute confirmation of cause. Relations were sought between adverse effects and age, sex, immunosuppressive therapy, kidney failure, body mass index (BMI), arterial hypertension, and diabetes mellitus.", 
    "5": "Possible adverse events of statins were suffered by 60 patients, all of them men. The causal role of statins was confirmed in 41 (12.2% of all 336): hepatotoxicity was suffered by 13, high CK without muscle ache or weakness by 18, rhabdomyolysis by 5, myalgia by 3, and other effects by 2. The incidence of confirmed statin-related complications was higher among patients with BMI >29 kg/m(2) than among those with lower BMI (P = .055). None of the patients with confirmed statin-related complications needed dialysis, none died, and permanent suspension of statin treatment was only necessary in 13 cases (3.9% of the 336).", 
    "6": "Some 10% to 20% of HT patients appear to suffer adverse side effects of initial statin therapy. However, early detection of such effects through diligent clinical and analytical monitoring allows the therapy to be modified in time to minimize the appearance of severe complications. In only a minority of cases permanent suspension of statin therapy is necessary.", 
    "7": "Various studies describe the pleiotropic antiinflammatory and antioxidant effects of atorvastatin, in addition to its hypolipemic effects. It has been suggested that statins modify glucose homeostasis via their antiinflammatory effects. A further hypothesis suggests that the incidence of posttransplantation diabetes is lower in statin-treated patients. This study sought to ascertain whether atorvastatin modifies glucose homeostasis, adiponectin, and inflammatory markers in kidney transplant recipients.", 
    "8": "Sixty-eight kidney transplant recipients (41 men, 27 women; mean age, 53 +/- 12 years) with stable renal function and dyslipidemia were treated with atorvastatin (10 mg/d) for 12 weeks. Glucose, insulin, homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) index, adiponectin, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations were determined at baseline and at 3 months. The lipid profile, renal function parameters (creatinine, creatinine clearance, and proteinuria), as well as GOT, GPT, and CK were determined at baseline and at 3 months.", 
    "9": "Treatment with atorvastatin achieved a statistically significant decrease in lipid profile. After 3 months of treatment, 74.6% of patients had total cholesterol and 78.7% low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations within reference range (<5.2 and 3.3 mmol/L, respectively). Furthermore, 47.5% of patients attained an LDL concentration <2.59 mmol/L. A greater reduction in total cholesterol (P = .05) and LDL cholesterol (P = .04) was achieved in patients with creatinine clearance <60 mL/min. Atorvastatin did not modify glucose homeostasis parameters, adiponectin, TNF-alpha, or CRP. At baseline and after 3 months of treatment, an inverse correlation was found between adiponectin and glucose, insulin, HOMA- IR index, and creatinine clearance, and a positive correlation was found between adiponectin and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol.", 
    "10": "Atorvastatin at a dose of 10 mg/d in kidney transplant recipients does not modify glucose homeostasis or alter inflammatory markers, despite its hypolipemic effects. Its efficacy to reduce total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol was greater in patients with worse renal function.", 
    "11": "Annexin II (ANXII) is a receptor for tissue plasminogen activator and plasminogen for the conversion to plasmin, which, in turn, induces metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9). 17beta-Estradiol (E(2)) is reported to decrease plasminogen activity inhibitor-1 and increase plasmin and matrix metalloproteinase activity. However, the combined effects of estrogen and statins on macrophage MMP-9 activity and ANXII expression remain unclear. Treatment of J774A.1 macrophages with 1.0-100 nM of E(2) for 24h increased both MMP-9 activity and ANXII expression in a dose-dependent manner (p<0.05). Preincubation with EGTA (10mM) released ANXII from the cell membrane and inhibited the E(2)-mediated MMP-9 activity as did incubation of macrophages with anti-annexin IgG. In the presence or absence of E(2) (5 nM), simvastatin treatment in the range of 0.1-5.0 microM significantly reduced macrophage MMP-9 enzymatic activity (p<0.005) in a dose-dependent manner. In the presence or absence of E(2), simvastatin also decreased ANXII expression (p<0.05). These findings indicate that ANXII plays a central role in modulating the enzymatic activity of MMP-9 in response to E(2) and that E(2)-mediated ANXII expression and MMP-9 activity can be prevented by simvastatin. Prevention of E(2)-mediated activation of MMP-9 by simvastatin suggests that concurrent statin use may account for early event risk of myocardial infarction seen with hormone therapy in recent clinical trials.", 
    "12": "Evidence suggests that inflammatory parameters such as high sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), serum amyloid-A (SAA) and fibrinogen (Fib) are associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In this study we investigated the association between LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), lipid lowering drug therapy (LLD) and inflammatory markers in 436 subjects (age 64,2 +/- 4.1 yr, BMI 27,6 +/- 3,9 kg/m2) with coronary heart disease, participating in outpatient exercise groups for cardiac rehabilitation. In a subgroup analysis (n=229), we looked at the respective effects of physical activity (PA) alone and in combination with LLD. For the whole group the levels of inflammatory markers were: hs-CRP 0,31 +/- 0,4 mg/dl; IL-6 2,04 +/- 1,6 pg/ml; SAA 6,26 +/- 14 mg/l; Fib 381 +/- 97 mg/dl. Compared to patients without LLD, those with LLD showed modestly lower concentrations for CRP (-7%) and IL-6 (-12%), (p<0.05, respectively). In patients with an LDL-C < 100 mg/dl, CRP (-12%) and Fib (-8%) were significantly lower (p<0.05, respectively) than in patients with LDL-C > 100 mg/dl. Patients with a high level of PA (PA > or = 3 times/week) exhibited significantly lower values for CRP (-18%), Fib (-11%) and SAA (-37%) (p<0.01, respectively) than patients with a low level of PA (< or = 1 time/week). The combination of a high level of PA, and intake of LLD further reduced CRP (-37%) and SAA (-45%), with no additional decrease in Fib (-10%) (p<0.01, respectively) compared to patients with a low level of PA and taking LLD. The data from this cross-sectional study suggest that factors such as LLD, LDL-C (< 100 mg/dl), and a high level of physical activity are associated with lower levels of inflammatory markers in patients with coronary heart disease. Particularly with respect to CRP and SAA values, a high level of PA in combination with LLD, showed the most pronounced effects. The proof of causality of these findings should further be investigated in randomized controlled trials.", 
    "13": "When looking at the history of the prescription of a new class of drugs e.g. the statin, it is clear that for optimal use with regard to efficacy, areas of indication and safety, the continuous development of new compounds within this class was very advantageous. Competition between compounds is essential for providing best patient care. Thus the availability of only one statin was and continues to be inadequate for this purpose.", 
    "14": "The majority of clinical trials investigating the clinical benefits of lipid-lowering therapies (LLTs) have focused on North American or western and nothern European populations. Therefore, it is timely to confirm the efficacy of these agents in other patient populations in routine clinical practice.",

    "16": "This randomized, open-label, parallel-group study was conducted at 93 centers in eastern Europe (Estonia, Latvia, Romania, Russia, Slovenia), Central and South America (Chile, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama), and the Middle East (Israel, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates). Male and female patients aged \u226518 years with primary hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C level, >135 mg/dL if LLT-naive or \u2265120 mg/dL if switching statins; triglyceride [TG] level, <400 mg/dL) and a 10-year coronary heart disease (CHD) risk >20% or a history of CHD or other established atherosclerotic disease were eligible for inclusion in the study. Patients were randomly assigned to receive rosuvastatin 10-mg or atorvastatin 10-mg tablets QD for 12 weeks. No formal statistical analyses or comparisons were performed on lipid changes between switched and LLT-naive patients because of the different lipid inclusion criteria for these patients. The primary end point was the proportion of patients achieving 1998 European LDL-C goals after 12 weeks of treatment. A subanalysis was performed to assess the effects of statins in patients who had received previous statin treatment versus those who were LLT-naive. Tolerability was assessed using laboratory analysis and direct questioning of the patients.",

A significantly higher proportion of patients achieved 1998 European LDL-C goals after 12 weeks with rosuvastatin 10 mg than with atorvastatin 10 mg (72.5% vs 56.6%; P < 0.001). Similarly, more patients achieved the 2003 European LDL-C goals with rosuvastatin 10 mg compared with atorvastatin 10 mg (57.5% vs 39.2%). Rosuvastatin 10 mg was associated with a significantly greater change in LDL-C levels compared with atorvastatin 10 mg, in patients who were LLT-naive (LDL-C: -44.7% vs -33.9%; P < 0.001) and in patients who had received previous LLT (LDL-C: -32.0% vs -26.5%; P = 0.006). TG levels were also decreased with rosuvastatin 10 mg and atorvastatin 10 mg, although there was no significant difference between treatments. Similarly, there was no significant difference in the increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels between treatments.

Hyperlipidemic patients aged \u226518 years with insulin resistance and no other components of the metabolic syndrome were included in the study. Atorvastatin 10 mg QD (after the evening meal) was administered by mouth (tablet) over a 12-week period. At baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment, insulin sensitivity was assessed using homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index methodology. Serum lipid parameters and fasting levels of plasma glucose and insulin (FPG and FPI, respectively) were measured at the same 2 time points. The tolerability of atorvastatin was assessed using laboratory analysis and physical examination, including vital sign measurements.",

    "24": "The use of statins in secondary prevention of cardiovascular events is well established. However, there is ongoing discussion about the use of statins in the context of primary prevention. Moreover statins - besides cholesterol-lowering effects - are assumed to have pleiotropic effects. Positive impacts on diseases like stroke, Alzheimer's disease or osteoporosis are discussed but still have to be proven.",

    "27": "Most studies within the context of primary prevention describe significant risk reductions with regard to cardiovascular events; yet no significant results according to the reduction of the overall mortality rate can be seen. With respect to stroke, osteoporosis and Alzheimer's disease results are inconsistent. Regarding cost-effectiveness of primary prevention with statins results turn out to be inconsistent as well or even negative for populations with low to moderate risk. For groups with high cardiovascular risk the intervention is mostly assessed to be cost-effective. No cost-effectiveness study for Germany was found. According to a rough estimate of future expenses statin drug expenses of the German legal health insurance might increase at least by 50% in the case of an enlargement of the group of recipients.", 
    "28": "To thoroughly estimate the cost-effectiveness of the use of statins in primary prevention in Germany a model calculation including all relevant parameters has to be done. Moreover - from the economic as well as from the ethic point of view - one of the most important issues in primary prevention therapy is the question of compliance. The amount of risk reduction seen in primary prevention studies can be achieved only if patients as well as doctors follow therapeutic instructions and medical guidelines (as for example the guidelines of the \"Adult Treatment Panel III\", the \"European guidelines on cardiovascular disease prevention in clinical practice\" or the guidelines of the German Association of Cardiology and of the \"Arzneimittelkommission der deutschen \u00c4rzteschaft f\u00fcr Koronare Herzkrankheit\").", 
    "29": "For (primary) prevention of cardiovascular diseases the use of statins as suggested in guidelines is recommended - provided that these guidelines are scientifically evaluated at regular intervals. Regarding stroke, osteoporosis and Alzheimer's disease definite conclusions cannot be drawn at present. Particular attention has to be paid to the problem of compliance both in statin-therapy as well as in alternative therapies. The cost-effectiveness of primary prevention with statins mainly depends on the development of statin prices.", 
    "30": "This study emphasizes the importance of Rho/ROCK pathway in lovastatin-induced apoptosis as replenishment with exogenous isoprenoid, geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP), resulted in inhibition of apoptosis in cultured tumor cells. Treatment of C6 glioma cells with Toxin B and exoenzyme C3 resulted in cell death suggesting the role of geranylgeranylated protein(s) in the survival of glioma cells. Relative apoptotic death observed in cells transfected with dominant negative constructs of RhoA, Rac, and cdc42 imply Rho A as playing the major role in cell survival. Furthermore, the inhibition of Rho A kinase (ROCK), a direct downstream effector of Rho A, by Y-27632 or dominant negative of ROCK, induced apoptosis in glioma cells. These findings indicate that RhoA/ROCK pathway is involved negatively in the regulation of glioma cell death pathway. Moreover, in vivo studies of lovastatin treatment in animals implanted with C6 glioma cell tumors also resulted in smaller tumor size and induced apoptosis in the tumor tissue. The implantation of stably transfected C6 glioma cells with expression vector of C3 exoenzyme, dominant negative of RhoA and ROCK, resulted in significant smaller tumor mass, further establishing the importance of geranylgeranylated proteins, specifically RhoA and its downstream effecter ROCK, in cell survival and tumor genesis.",

These compounds are structurally similar, but differ in their lipophilicity. Several studies have indicated a link between cholesterol and Alzheimer's disease (AD), and there is also epidemiological evidence that statin treatment may decrease the prevalence of dementias. In the present study we wanted to investigate whether pravastatin treatment affects brain cholesterol metabolism.", 
    "32": "A post hoc analysis was performed with plasma material from a clinical trial where 51 healthy men (35+/-4 years) were randomly assigned to receive either pravastatin (40 mg/day) or placebo for 6 months. Cholesterol, its precursor lathosterol, its brain-specific metabolite 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (24S-OH-chol) and 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OH-chol) were determined in plasma samples before and after treatment by using gas-liquid chromatography (GC)-flame ionization detection (GC-FID) and GC mass spectrometry (GC-MS).", 
    "33": "Besides reducing total cholesterol (-20%, P<0.001) and LDL cholesterol (LDL-C; -33%, P<0.001) concentrations, pravastatin treatment resulted in a decrease of the ratio of lathosterol to cholesterol, a surrogate marker of endogenous cholesterol synthesis, by 20% (P<0.05). Absolute concentrations of 24S-OH-chol were not altered, but its ratio to cholesterol slightly increased by 15% (P<0.05). 27-OH-chol concentrations as well as its ratio to cholesterol were both significantly altered due to pravastatin treatment (-7% and +14%, P<0.05 for both, respectively).",

    "35": "Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] concentration is generally related to coronary artery disease (CAD) and cerebrovascular disease. However, at present, few interventions are available to lower Lp(a) concentrations. We investigated the effects of l-carnitine, co-administered with simvastatin, on hyper-Lp(a) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. We conducted an open, randomised, parallel-group study, in one investigational center (University hospital). Fifty-two patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, a triglyceride serum levels <400mg/dL (<4.5 mmol/L), and Lp(a) serum levels >20mg/dL (0.71 mmol/L) were randomised to receive simvastatin alone (n=26) or simvastatin plus l-carnitine (n=26) for 60 days. Simvastatin was administered, in both groups, at a dosage of 20 mg/day, while l-carnitine was administered at a dosage of 2g/day once daily. Both treatments were given orally. Serum levels of triglycerides, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol (total cholesterol minus HDL cholesterol), apolipoprotein B, and Lp(a) were measured at baseline and 60 days after starting treatment. No difference in time by groups (simvastatin and simvastatin plus l-carnitine) were observed in the reduction of LDL cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, and apoB serum levels. On the other hand, Lp(a) serum levels increase from baseline to 60 days in the simvastatin group alone versus a significant decrease in the combination group. Our findings provide support for a possible role of combined treatment with l-carnitine and simvastatin in lowering Lp(a) serum levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus than with simvastatin alone. Our results strongly suggest that l-carnitine may have a role among lipid-lowering strategies.",

However, less is known regarding the relationship between CRP levels and atherosclerotic burden.", 
    "37": "We measured CRP in 3373 subjects 30 to 65 years of age who were participating in the Dallas Heart Study, a multiethnic, population-based, probability sample. Electron-beam CT scans were used to measure coronary artery calcification (CAC) in 2726 of these subjects, and MRI was used to measure aortic plaque in 2393. CRP levels were associated with most traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Subjects with CAC had higher median CRP levels than those without CAC (men: median, 2.4 versus 1.8 mg/L, P<0.001; women: median, 5.2 versus 3.6 mg/L, P<0.001), and there was a modest trend toward increasing CRP levels with increased CAC levels in men (P for trend=0.003) but not in women (P for trend=0.08). Male subjects with aortic plaque also had higher CRP levels than those without (median, 2.3 versus 1.8; P<0.001). In multivariate analysis adjusted for traditional cardiovascular risk factors, body mass index, and estrogen and statin medication use, the associations between CRP levels and CAC and CRP levels and aortic plaque were no longer statistically significant.", 
    "38": "In a large, population-based sample, subjects with higher CRP levels had a modest increase in the prevalence of subclinical atherosclerosis, but this association was not independent of traditional cardiovascular risk factors. CRP is a poor predictor of atherosclerotic burden.", 
    "39": "We investigated the relationship of aortic pulse wave velocity (aPWV), a measure of central arterial stiffness, with the presence and quantity of coronary artery calcium (CAC) in a community-based sample of adults without prior history of heart attack or stroke (n=401, mean age 59.8 years, 53% men). ECG-gated waveforms of the right carotid and right femoral artery were obtained by applanation tonometry, and aPWV was calculated using established methods. CAC was measured noninvasively by electron beam computed tomography, and CAC score was calculated. aPWV was significantly correlated with log(CAC +1; r=0.41; P<0.0001) and pulse pressure (r=0.47; P<0.0001). Multivariable logistic and linear regression models were used to identify independent predictors of the presence and quantity of CAC, respectively. In multivariable logistic regression analyses, aPWV was associated with the presence of CAC (P=0.011) after adjustment for age, male sex, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, diabetes, history of smoking, systolic blood pressure, body mass index, and use of hypertension and statin medications. In multivariable linear regression analyses, aPWV was significantly associated with log(CAC +1) after adjustment for the covariates enumerated above (P<0.0001). aPWV remained significantly associated with both the presence and quantity of CAC even after the additional adjustment for diastolic blood pressure. We conclude that aPWV is related to subclinical coronary atherosclerosis independent of conventional risk factors (including indices of blood pressure) and may be a biomarker of cardiovascular risk in asymptomatic individuals.",

Although the beneficial effects of statins for cardiovascular diseases are well established, their importance in the area of cancer therapeutics has recently gained recognition. Many studies of lovastatin in in vitro systems and experimental animals have been reported as an effective antitumor agent. However, phase I/II clinical trials in cancer patients demonstrated a minor to non-significant responses. Hence more studies in different tumor models using doses corresponding to that used to reduce lipid in human are required to support the antitumor activity.",

The percentage increase in life span (%ILS) in the 16 mg/kg treated group was 61.8% (P<0.01). Single dose of lovastatin (16 mg/kg body wt, p.o) was also effective to accelerate the apoptosis in the ascites tumor bearing mice that was evident from the multiple fragmentation of DNA in gel electrophoresis. Further the morphological analysis of DLA cells aspirated from the lovastatin treated animals showed a significant (P<0.01) increase of apoptotic cells (15.5+/-3%) than the control animals (6.5+/-1%). Concentration of lovastatin required for the 50% of the cytotoxicity was 37+/-5 microg/ml. Lovastatin at its low concentrations were effective to inhibit lipid peroxidation.",

After administration with Laminaria Japonica Polysccharides for two weeks, the content of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high density lipoprotein (HDL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) in serum and the ratio of HDL/TC were determined, index of liver was calculated, the extent of aortic atherosclerosis and the atherosclerotic lesion were observed.", 
    "46": "The concentration of TC, TG, LDL in serum and index of liver decreased remarkedly, the ratio of HLD/TC increased remarkably, the the extent of aortic atherosclerosis and the atherosclerotic lesion lightened obviously.",

    "48": "The occurrence of stroke increases with age, particularly affecting the older elderly, a population also at higher risk for coronary heart disease (CHD). Epidemiological and observational studies have not shown a clear association between cholesterol levels and all causes of stroke. Nevertheless, large, long-term statin trials in patients with established CHD or et high risk for CHD (diabetes, hypertension) have shown that statins decrease stroke incidence in these populations even with a normal baseline cholesterol concentration. In patients with previous stroke statins reduce the incidence of coronary events, but whether they actually reduce the incidence of recurrent strokes in secondary prevention is unproved. In this review we discuss the potential reason for the effects of statins on stroke and the mechanisms of action. Statins probably reduce stroke by a variety of mechanisms. Several studies indicate that statins have multiple effects beyond lowering the cholesterol level. There is evidence that statins have neuroprotective properties for the acute ischaemic brain. Statins interfere with platelet aggregation and have anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties. Also statins promote stabilisation of atherosclerotic plaques and improve blood flow to the ischaemic brain. The protective effects of statins might be due to their direct effect on endothelial cells leading to improved nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. However further studies are needed to understand the full role of statins in the prevention of stroke in patients without established cardiovascular disease, representative of the typical stroke population.", 
    "49": "The end-point of this retrospective study was to evaluate the standard of care in terms of in-hospital morbidity and mortality for patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) treated by thrombolysis within the first 12 hours from the start of the symptoms in five cardiology centers from Bucarest for a period of 5 years (2000-2004). This retrospective registry on a central database included 1814 patients (73.63% men, mean age 59.9 +/- 11.8 years), presented in an average time of 211.63 minutes from pain start. The most frequently used fibrinolitic was streptokinase (66.21%), administered most often in 30 minutes and for a subgroup in 20 minutes--accelerated regimen, with a good efficiency for the reperfusion of the culprit vessel evaluated non-invasively (clinical, electrical and biological methods). The global in-hospital mortality was 11.1%. The only predictors of in-hospital mortality were female gender and advanced age (>75 years) [p < 0.05]. The rate of haemorrhagic complications was not different from the one described by other clinical studies. The treatment by anticoagulants, antiaplatelets agents like aspirin, ACE inhibitors and statins were significant determinants of in-hospital survival. In the subgroup followed-up for 1 year (315 patients), the most frequent complication was the heart failure. In conclusion, in Bucarest, where availability of primary angioplasty in AMI was limited, thrombolysis with streptokinase was still very much used, with acceptable low in-hospital mortality and relatively high rate of artery reperfusion appreciated by non-invasive methods.", 
    "50": "There has been considerable debate about the potential relationship between the use of statin lipid-lowering drugs and fracture risk; several observational studies suggest a protective effect but no randomized controlled trials have confirmed such a benefit. Because statins are given preferentially to persons with hyperlipidemia, if lipid levels were associated with bone mineral density, this could explain the discrepancy between epidemiological observations and randomized controlled trials. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship between lipid levels and bone mineral density.", 
    "51": "We included the 13592 participants in the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES) III who had bone mineral density and lipid levels measured; participants who reported the use of a lipid-lowering therapy were excluded. We examined the unadjusted bone mineral density across quintiles of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). We then constructed multivariable models, including age, sex, body mass index, and other potential confounders.", 
    "52": "In crude analyses, higher total cholesterol and LDL levels were associated with lower bone mineral densities (both P values for trend <.001), whereas higher HDL levels were associated with higher bone mineral densities (P value for trend <.001). However, in fully adjusted models, there was no significant relationship between total cholesterol, LDL, or HDL levels and bone mineral density (all P values for trend >.1).",

    "54": "Chronic kidney disease constitutes a highly prevalent health problem worldwide. Left untreated, it progresses inexorably to greater levels of severity at variable rates. The morbid impact of chronic kidney disease is heightened by its role as risk factor for cardiovascular disease. In the past two decades, considerable gains have been realized in retarding progression of chronic kidney disease by emphasizing blood pressure control and blockade of the renin-angiotensin system. Notwithstanding, the therapeutic goal of preventing or arresting chronic kidney disease progression remains unfulfilled. Currently attainable rates of decrease in glomerular filtration rate remain at 2 to 8 mL/min/y depending on the underlying disease. It is now believed that to achieve optimal therapeutic targets (proteinuria of <500 mg/day and decrease in glomerular filtration rate of 1 mL/min/y, the average age-related decline) we must introduce novel strategies and a multifaceted approach to treatment that interrupts multiple mechanisms of progression. To this end, and wherever relevant, new approaches to cause-specific treatment must be applied, such as targeted immunosuppression, intensive glycemic control, gene therapy, and enzyme replacement therapy. Furthermore, in all chronic kidney disease, we must interfere more effectively with the multitude of common mechanisms of progression. Established or putative, such approaches include aggressive blood pressure control; advanced renin-angiotensin system blockade; cytokine modulation and antifibrotic therapy; aldosterone blockade; endothelin blockade, nitric oxide modulation and vasopeptidase inhibition; antioxidant therapy; statin therapy; glycosaminoglycan therapy; anemia therapy; dietary restrictions; lifestyle changes; and pharmacogenomic profiling. Such a concerted, multifaceted approach to management might indeed prevent or arrest progression of chronic kidney disease, or even achieve regression of chronic kidney disease.",

This study investigated the advantages of combined therapy with atorvastatin and colestimide vs intensive monotherapy with atorvastatin.", 
    "56": "The trial used a randomized cross-over design consisting of 2 16-week periods of open-label drug therapy. Among the 24 initial patients, 17 heterozygous FH patients (age: 54.1 years; 5 males) were enrolled after 20 mg/day atorvastatin failed to achieve their target level. The patients received 20 mg/day atorvastatin and 3 g/day colestimide or 40 mg/day atorvastatin. Fifteen patients completed the trial and their LDL-C reduced from 5.07 +/- 1.10 mmol/L to 3.76 +/- 0.90 mmol/L with the combined therapy and to 3.81 +/- 0.50 mmol/L with the intensive monotherapy. Although the 2 therapies showed comparable mean effects for decreasing LDL-C, similar adverse reaction and cost, each therapy was predominantly more effective in some patients than in others. The triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were similar in both therapies.",

    "58": "Zygomycetes are emerging opportunistic molds resistant to most conventional antifungals. We evaluated the in vitro activity of lovastatin (LOV), a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, against seven clinical isolates of Zygomycetes by using standard microdilution methods in three different media, disk diffusion testing, and viability dye staining. To further study the in vivo efficacy of LOV against zygomycetes, we developed a Drosophila melanogaster model of zygomycosis. In different experiments, groups of Toll-deficient (Tl) flies fed LOV-containing food were subsequently injected with two representative Zygomycetes isolates (Mucor and Rhizopus spp.). Finally, we examined the effects of LOV on voriconazole (VRC) activity against zygomycetes in vitro by checkerboard dilution, Epsilometer test-based methods, and bis-(1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid) trimethine oxonol staining and in vivo in Tl flies fed food containing LOV plus VRC and infected with zygomycetes. LOV exhibited significant, medium, and strain-independent fungicidal activity against all Zygomycetes isolates in vitro by all testing methods (MIC50, 48.0 microg/ml; 50% minimal fungicidal concentration, 56.0 microg/ml; 50% effective concentration, 29.4 microg/ml [6.6 to 38.9 microg/ml]). Tl flies fed LOV-containing food and infected with Mucor had a significantly better 6-day survival rate than did infected Tl flies fed regular food (P = 0.0005). LOV displayed in vitro synergy with VRC against all Zygomycetes isolates (fractional inhibitory concentration index, 0.104 to 0.290) by all methods used. LOV also displayed synergy with VRC in the Drosophila model of zygomycosis (P < 0.01). LOV is significantly active against zygomycetes and synergizes with triazoles inherently resistant to them, such as VRC. The clinical significance of these findings needs to be further explored.", 
    "59": "Atorvastatin has been shown to reduce coronary events and revascularization procedures in patients with multiple risk factors for coronary heart disease. Recent studies with atorvastatin 80 mg support the overall safety of this dose during long-term treatment. However, physicians appear reluctant to use high doses of statins. A retrospective analysis of pooled data from 49 clinical trials of atorvastatin in 14,236 patients treated for an average period of 2 weeks to 52 months was conducted. The study compared the safety of atorvastatin 10 mg (n = 7,258), atorvastatin 80 mg (n = 4,798), and placebo (n = 2,180) and included analyses on treatment-associated adverse events; nonserious and serious adverse events related to the musculoskeletal, hepatic, and renal systems; the incidence of elevations of creatine kinase >10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN); and hepatic transaminases >3 times ULN. Percentages of patients experiencing > or =1 adverse event were similar across all 3 groups. Withdrawals due to treatment-related adverse events were observed in 2.4%, 1.8%, and 1.2% of patients in the atorvastatin 10 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. Serious adverse events were rare and seldom led to treatment withdrawal with any dose. Treatment-associated myalgia was observed in 1.4%, 1.5%, and 0.7% of patients in the atorvastatin 10 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. No cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported in any group. Persistent elevations in hepatic transaminases >3 times ULN were observed in 0.1%, 0.6%, and 0.2% of patients in the atorvastatin 10 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. The incidence of treatment-associated adverse events for atorvastatin 80 mg was similar to that of atorvastatin 10 mg and placebo. In conclusion, the results of this analysis support the positive safety profile of atorvastatin at the highest dose.", 
    "60": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common complication after coronary artery bypass grafting. Atrial remodeling has been observed in AF and has been associated with the development of this arrhythmia. Because 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A inhibitors (statins) have been demonstrated to modify remodeling, we hypothesized a protective role of statins against postoperative AF. We also hypothesized that extracellular matrix turnover and brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) might be related to such atrial remodeling. We studied 234 consecutive patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting (173 men; 65 +/- 9 years of age) in whom the occurrence of postoperative AF was monitored. In a subgroup of 66 patients, we measured plasma levels of matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1), its inhibitor, tissue inhibitor matrix metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1; as indexes of extracellular matrix remodeling), and N-terminus pro-BNP (related to left ventricular function) at baseline and at 24 hours after surgery. Of 234 patients, 66 (28.2%) developed postoperative AF. In multivariate analysis, previous AF was related to an increase in the development of AF (odds ratio 11.92, 95% confidence interval 2.37 to 59.98, p = 0.026), whereas statin use was related to a decrease in arrhythmia (odds ratio 0.52, 95% confidence interval 0.28 to 0.96, p = 0.038). A higher TIMP-1/MMP-1 ratio at 24 hours after surgery was present in those who did not develop postoperative AF (p = 0.043). Statin use was associated with increased TIMP-1 levels and TIMP-1/MMP-1 ratio (p = 0.027 and 0.036, respectively). No significant relations to N-terminus pro-BNP were seen. In conclusion, previous AF and nonuse of statins are significantly associated with AF after coronary artery bypass grafting. Statin use may be protective against AF after coronary artery bypass grafting, possibly due to alterations in the extracellular matrix and remodeling after coronary artery bypass grafting.",

Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of morning versus evening intake of atorvastatin on major cardiac events and restenosis rates and also on serum lipid and high sensitivity C-reactive protein levels in patients with single-vessel disease who underwent first elective percutaneous coronary intervention.", 
    "62": "In patients who have ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), a patent infarct-related artery on the initial angiogram is associated with improved clinical outcomes, including decreased mortality. The present study assessed the influence of administering aspirin, beta blockers, statins, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors before STEMI on infarct-related artery patency. Our data demonstrate that patients who have STEMI and receive these medications on an outpatient basis before the event have a higher likelihood of having a patent infarct-related artery compared with patients who do not receive these medications. Further, our data demonstrate a graded association according to the number of such medications being administered: the likelihood of a patent infarct-related artery increased to >50% as the number of these medications increased.", 
    "63": "Cholesterol lowering statin drugs are the most frequently prescribed agents for reducing morbidity and mortality related to coronary heart disease. This publication presents a validated, highly sensitive and selective isocratic HPLC method for the quantitative determination of the major statin drug simvastatin (SIM) and its metabolite simvastatin hydroxy acid (SIMA). Detection was performed on an electrospray ionization triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an ESI interface operated in positive and negative ionization mode. The multiple reaction-monitoring mode (MRM) was used to provide MS/MS detection. The linearity for the calibration curve in the concentration range of 0.10-16.00 ng/mL for SIM and 0.10-16.00 ng/mL for SIMA is presented. Inter- and intra-day precision and accuracy of the proposed method were characterized by relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) and percentage deviation, respectively; with both lower than 7% for all analytes. The limit of quantitation was 0.03 ng/mL for SIM and 0.02 ng/mL for SIMA. The devised method was employed in the pharmacokinetic study of SIM and the pharmacokinetic parameters of all analytes are also presented.", 
    "64": "Ischemic preconditioning is a powerful infarct-sparing intervention. Intensive investigations have revealed many of the signaling steps used to elicit this protection. One of the steps involves activation of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) by phosphorylation, with the production of NO and subsequent activation of guanylyl cyclase, production of cGMP, activation of protein kinase G, opening of mitochondrial KATP channels, and generation of reactive oxygen species. The latter act as second messengers to activate critical kinase cascades that trigger entrance into the preconditioned state. Thus, NO exposure before ischemia can act as a powerful preconditioning mimetic. Elevating NO just prior to or at reperfusion can still be an effective cardioprotective strategy. Activation of NOS or production of NO can be done pharmacologically with exogenous agents to trigger this cascade. Many of these strategies are already available and safe.", 
    "65": "In previous investigations, we found that 7beta-hydroxycholesterol had potent pro-apoptotic, and pro-oxidative properties. So, we asked whether the circulating level of this oxysterol was enhanced in atherosclerotic patients undergoing endarterectomy of the superficial femoral artery. To this end, 7beta-hydroxycholesterol serum concentrations were determined and compared with common lipid parameters in atherosclerotic patients, and in healthy subjects. 7alpha-hydroxycholesterol was simultaneously measured to evaluate the reliability of the method used for oxysterol analysis. On normal and atherosclerotic arterial fragments from patients, markers of oxidation (4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) adducts), and apoptosis (activated caspase-3; condensed/fragmented nuclei) were studied. Interestingly, high serum concentrations of 7beta- and 7alpha-hydroxycholesterol were found in normocholesterolemic atherosclerotic patients. However, in statin-treated patients, the circulating levels of 7beta- and 7alpha-hydroxycholesterol tend towards normal values. Therefore, 7beta- as well as 7alpha-hydroxycholesterol could be more appropriate markers of lipid metabolism disorders than cholesterol or LDL in normocholesterolemic patients with atherosclerosis of the lower limbs, and statins could normalize their serum concentrations. At the arterial level, apoptotic cells were mainly identified in low grade lesions and no statin effects were found on oxidation and apoptosis.", 
    "66": "Statins not only reduce serum cholesterol but they also improve vascular endothelial function independent of their lipid-lowering effects. However, except for the mechanism of nitric oxide induction via calveolin, the physiologic basis for the pleiotropic effect of statins remains unknown. In the present study, we investigated the relationship between the effects of statins on vascular endothelial cell function and heat shock proteins. We found that, in vascular endothelial cells, simvastatin increased the steady-state levels of heat shock proteins 90 and 70, and heme oxygenase-1 and caused the nuclear translocation of heat shock factor 1. A decoy oligonucleotide encoding the heat shock element inhibited statin-induced expression of heat shock protein 70, endothelial nitric oxide synthase, and thrombomodulin. This decoy oligonucleotide also inhibited the ability of statin to reduce endothelin-1 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 expression. These results indicate that statins improve vascular endothelial function via heat shock factor 1, which may contribute to their ability to improve cardiovascular disease.", 
    "67": "Beyond allopurinol and the well-established uricosuric drugs, several other agents can decrease serum uric acid (SUA) levels, such as losartan, fenofibrate and some non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Some of these drugs increase renal urate excretion. Hyperuricaemia and gout are common problems (at least 1% of Western men are affected by gout). Raised SUA levels increase the incidence of acute gout and renal calculi. Hyperuricaemia may also predict an increased risk of vascular events. Therefore, lowering SUA levels is of clinical relevance. In this review we consider the effect on SUA levels of drugs that are prescribed for indications other than treating hyperuricaemia. These drugs may obviate the need for specific treatment (e.g. allopurinol) aimed at lowering SUA levels. Furthermore, because hyperuricaemic patients may already be on several drugs (e.g. due to associated dyslipidaemia, hypertension and/or arthritis) compliance may be improved by avoiding additional medication. The potential for adverse effects associated with polypharmacy would also be decreased.", 
    "68": "Angiogenesis is indispensable for the growth of solid tumors and angiogenic factors are also involved in the progression of hematological malignancies. Targeting the formation of blood vessels is therefore regarded as a promising strategy in cancer therapy. Interestingly, besides demonstration of some beneficial effects of novel anti-angiogenic compounds, recent data on the activity of already available drugs point to their potential application in anti-angiogenic therapy. Among these are the statins, the inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase. Statins are very efficient in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia in cardiovascular disorders; however, their effects are pleiotropic and some are not directly related to the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis. Some reports particularly highlight the pro-angiogenic effects of statins, which are caused by low, nanomolar concentrations and are regarded as beneficial for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. On the other hand, the anti-angiogenic activities, observed at micromolar concentrations of statins, may be of special significance for cancer therapy. Those effects are caused by the inhibition of both proliferation and migration and induction of apoptosis in endothelial cells. Moreover, the statin-mediated inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor synthesis, the major angiogenic mediator, may contribute to the attenuation of angiogenesis. It has been suggested that the anti-cancer effect of statins can be potentially exploited for the cancer therapy. However, several clinical trials aimed at the inhibition of tumor growth by treatment with very high doses of statins did not provide conclusive data. Herein, the reasons for those outcomes are discussed and the rationale for further studies is presented.", 
    "69": "Cholesterol clearly plays an influential role in promoting the production of amyloid beta (Abeta) and possibly the progression of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The AD Cholesterol-Lowering Treatment trial (ADCLT; 1 year duration) tested atorvastatin and found significant benefit on measures of cognition and depressive symptoms in treated patients (N = 32) compared to placebo (N = 31). We assessed the circulating levels of Abeta(1-40), Abeta(1-42), ceruloplasmin (copper chaperone), apolipoprotein E and HDL-cholesterol in blood collected at each clinical visit during the ADCLT. We also determined the circulating cholesterol, ceruloplasmin, and Abeta levels in AD and MCI (mild cognitive impairment) patients, and controls (two groups stratified by function; high and low) participating in our Brain Bank Program. Each Brain Bank individual was clinically assessed for performance on the Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE), Rey auditory verbal learning test (AVLT), Clock draw, and UPSIT (smell identification test). Among individuals of equal age and education, scores on the MMSE were significantly reduced in AD compared to both MCI and controls, as were scores on the UPSIT. Ability on delayed verbal recall was significantly reduced in AD compared to MCI, and in MCI compared to both control groups. Performance on the Clock draw was similar for AD and MCI patients, but was significantly reduced when comparing MCI to control. Both cholesterol and ceruloplasmin levels were significantly increased in low-function controls compared to the high-function control group, but were not different from levels identified in the MCI and AD patients. Significantly increased levels of Abeta(1-40) occurred in low- compared to high-function controls, with a further significant increase in MCI compared to low-function controls. Circulating Abeta(1-40) levels were decreased in AD compared to MCI. Levels of Abeta(1-42) were not significantly different between the groups. The slight gradual increase in circulating Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) levels produced by atorvastatin treatment in the ADCLT were not significant compared placebo. There was a trend for significant reduction in circulating ceruloplasmin levels after a year of atorvastatin therapy compared to levels observed at screen. The levels of HDL-cholesterol remained stable in the atorvastatin treated AD patients for 9 months and then decreased significantly compared to the placebo group at the 1-year time-point. The combined data support a role for cholesterol in AD and a possible influence of increasing circulating copper levels. The deterioration of function in controls and transition to MCI may be associated with concomitant incremental increases in circulating Abeta(1-40) levels. Increased cholesterol and ceruloplasmin levels may be associated with slight deterioration in function among controls as a precursor to impairment considered MCI. The clinical benefit of atorvastatin therapy is clearly not associated with decreased circulating Abeta or increased HDL-cholesterol, but a positive influence of reduced copper (ceruloplasmin) levels may be a consideration.",

Intracoronary Doppler measurements were performed. Coronary flow reserve, relative coronary flow reserve and average peak velocity were performed at baseline, after 3 months on a lipid-lowering diet (control period), and after another 12 months of simvastatin 40 mg/day.

Then the rats underwent nonpulsatile/low-pressure blood flow in the intestine, and the serum peptidoglycan concentration as a parameter of BT, the small intestinal PO(2) ratio (intestinal PO(2)/PaO(2)) as a parameter of mucosal blood flow, and NO concentrations were measured before surgery (T0), at the end of 90 min of stenosis (T1), and 90 min after the release of stenosis (T2).

Inhibition of LOX-1 expression reduces foam cell formation and might influence lipid core formation in atherosclerotic lesions.

In addition, it is speculated that pharmacological differences between statins may account for differences in their antioxidative capacities. This is of clinical relevance, because there is strong evidence that oxidized LDL initiates the atherosclerosis process.",

Changes in LDL oxidation were measured using diene conjugation (DIENES) and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) at entry and three months after beginning therapy with the statins.", 
    "83": "Levels of DIENES, usually generated during the early phases of lipid peroxidation, were significantly reduced by 10.2 +/- 5.5% (mean +/- SEM; p < 0.03), 6.0 +/- 2.0% (p < 0.005) versus baseline in the case of pravastatin and atorvastatin but simvastatin had no significant effect with a mean reduction of 5.5 +/- 6.4% (p > 0.23). Levels of TBARS, reflecting late phases of LDL oxidation, showed no significant changes against baseline (p > 0.34). Pooled data (n = 70) indicated that statins reduce DIENES levels by approximately 9% versus baseline (p < 0.005) but had no significant effect on TBARS levels (p > 0.29) after three months of therapy.",

    "85": "A predominance of small, dense low-density lipoproteins (LDL) has been accepted as an emerging cardiovascular risk factor by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III. LDL size seems to be an important predictor of cardiovascular events and progression of coronary heart disease and evidences suggests that both quality (particularly small, dense LDL) and quantity may increase cardiovascular risk. However, other authors have suggested that LDL size measurement does not add information beyond that obtained by measuring LDL concentration, triglyceride levels and HDL concentrations. Therefore, it remains debatable whether to measure LDL particle size in cardiovascular risk assessment and, if so, in which categories of patient. Therapeutic modulation of LDL particle size or number appears beneficial in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events, but no clear causal relationship has been shown, because of confounding factors, including lipid and non-lipid variables. Studies are needed to investigate the clinical significance of LDL size measurements in patients with coronary and non-coronary forms of atherosclerosis; in particular, to test whether LDL size is associated with even higher vascular risk, and whether LDL size modification may contribute to secondary prevention in such patients.", 
    "86": "Patients with the metabolic syndrome and/or Type 2 diabetes mellitus continue to have a high risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) and progression of atherosclerotic lesions despite aggressive statin therapy. Although the National Cholesterol Education Programme Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines recommend the use of fibrates in combination with statins in patients at very high risk of CHD (e.g., patients at the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol target with high triglycerides and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, many physicians remain reluctant to use these combinations due to concerns of myotoxicity. Recently conducted metabolic and pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction studies using gemfibrozil or fenofibrate in combination with five commonly used statins demonstrated a widely different drug interaction potential for these two fibrates. Gemfibrozil causes a 2- to 6-fold increase in statin area under the curve and increases the exposure to many recently approved drugs for the treatment of diabetes. Alternatively, fenofibrate does not adversely affect either the metabolism or pharmacokinetics of the statins studied. These pharmacokinetic differences appear to translate into less potential for interactions with fenofibrate/statin combination therapy compared to gemfibrozil/statin co-administration. The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) study in 10,000 patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus is testing the efficacy and safety of fenofibrate/statin combination.", 
    "87": "Cerebral vasospasm is a common and serious complication of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage (SAH). At present, no consistently effective preventative and therapeutic measures are available, perhaps because of incomplete understanding of the pathogenesis of vasospasm. Experimental studies provide evidence that the incidence and severity of vasospasm after SAH can be modulated by drugs that affect neurotransmitter levels, intracellular signalling mechanisms, vascular smooth muscle function, inflammation and cellular proliferation, and the concentration of 'spasmogenic' factors. Preliminary clinical studies indicate that some illicit drugs and common prescription medications can have similar effects in humans. Recognition of these pharmacological effects is important because medications that can worsen or alleviate vasospasm are frequently administered to SAH patients to treat coincident medical problems.", 
    "88": "Perindopril is a third-generation ACE inhibitor that is characterised as a small, lipophilic molecule with a therapeutically active carboxyl side group. These and other features combine to make this a unique member of a very well-established class of drugs that have proven efficacy in a wide range of cardiovascular diseases. The Perindopril Protection Against Recurrent Stroke Study (PROGRESS) demonstrated benefit in the secondary prevention of patients with stroke, whereas the Perindopril and Remodelling in Elderly with Acute Myocardial Infarction (PREAMI) trial supports extended routine use after myocardial infarction. The most recent evidence from the European Trial on Reduction of Cardiac Events with Perindopril in Stable Coronary Artery Disease (EUROPA) and the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT) show that perindopril is able to improve the prognosis of patients with a relatively low global cardiovascular risk, denoted either by the presence of stable coronary artery disease or of essential hypertension in conjunction with at least three other risk factors. The fact that major relative risk reductions have been reported for these two studies is matched by the significance of the findings to modern clinical practice. Both studies were conducted in the context of advance concomitant care that is typically better in clinical trials than in routine practice. In particular, the benefits observed were seen to be of a similar magnitude, and also independent of those resulting from statin therapy. Of particular interest is the likely complimentary action of these treatment strategies with regard to the stabilisation of atheromatous plaques. Perindopril is a well-established drug, the full value of which is only now becoming fully apparent.",

In the I group (n=17) patients received atorvastatin (liprimar) 40 mg/day, II group (n=15) represented the control group. Plasma level of C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) was assessed by highly sensitive method at baseline, on days 7 and 14. Baseline clinical characteristics and C-reactive protein level were similar in all groups. C-reactive protein level was increased in both groups from the baseline on day 7 (p<0.01). In group I C-reactive protein level was decreased by 16.54% from the baseline on day 14 (from 22.48+/-1.65 to 18.76+/-1.55 mg/l, p=1.7).

Twenty-four animals were randomly allocated to three equal groups (sham, control, simvastatin). The simvastatin group was pretreated with simvastatin 10 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) for 3 days, whereas the other groups received placebo. The simvastatin and control groups underwent 60 min of superior mesenteric artery occlusion and 90 min of reperfusion. Compared with the simvastatin group, the control group exhibited significantly more severe intestinal I/R-induced acute lung injury, as indicated by lower Pao2 and oxygen saturation (P = 0.01 and P = 0.005, respectively) and higher mean values for neutrophil infiltration of the lungs (P = 0.003), total lung histopathologic injury score (P = 0.003), lung wet-to-dry weight ratio (P = 0.009), and lung-tissue malondialdehyde levels (P = 0.016). The control and simvastatin groups had similar serum levels and similar bronchoalveolar lavage fluid levels of cytokines (interleukin-1, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) and P-selectin at all measurements, except for a significantly higher level of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid P-selectin in the control group (P = 0.006). Pretreatment with simvastatin reduces the severity of acute lung injury induced by intestinal I/R in rats.",

We examined the effect of HT on platelet surface expression of P-selectin, a marker of platelet activation, and plasma levels of soluble P-selectin, also believed to be a marker of platelet activation, and compared these effects with pravastatin, a drug proven to reduce cardiovascular events and reported to decrease both platelet and soluble P-selectin.",

The percentage of platelets expressing P-selectin was also reduced by pravastatin (p = 0.025), but there was a trend to an increase in platelet P-selectin expression with HT (p = 0.13), and a significant difference between pravastatin and HT in the changes in platelet P-selectin (p < 0.002). No relationship was evident between changes in soluble or platelet P-selectin and changes in lipids with either treatment.", 
    "100": "In postmenopausal hypercholesterolemic women, both pravastatin and HT reduced soluble P-selectin levels, but only pravastatin reduced P-selectin expression on the surface of platelets.

Only 54% were adherent to all of their initial medications. Patients who discontinued medications were more likely to be older, women, unmarried, and less educated. Multivariable predictors of better adherence were higher mental health, education level, marital status, and no antidepressant use. A higher number of prescribed medications were associated with lower adherence to the recommended regimen. Insurance coverage and physical function did not correlate with adherence.",

    "118": "Circulating IL-2(+) T lymphocytes are increased in patients with stable CAD reflecting an activation of the global immune system, but are not influenced by atorvastatin therapy. The elevated levels of platelet-derived T-lymphocyte-stimulating sCD40L are decreased by atorvastatin probably reflecting an atheroprotective effect.

Lipid lowering therapy with HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors (statins) reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in type 2 diabetic and non-diabetic patients, effects which are believed to be partly due to improvements in vascular function. The aetiology of abnormal vascular function in type 2 diabetics is likely to be multifactorial and the pattern of vascular dysfunction in type 2 diabetes may differ from that which occurs in non-diabetic patients with dyslipidaemia. Abnormalities in endothelium derived hyperpolarising factor (EDHF) mediated vasodilation in resistance vessels may be more prominent in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes than in non-diabetic patients with endothelial dysfunction. The effects of lipid lowering therapy on vascular responsiveness may differ in type 2 diabetic patients from those found in non-diabetic patients. Statin therapy does not appear to improve responses to endothelial dependent vasodilators in type 2 diabetics, but may alter the ratio between nitric oxide (NO) and EDHF mediated responses. Fibrate therapy improves flow mediated dilation of brachial arteries in type 2 diabetic patients, but only appears to improve endothelium dependant vasodilator responses in resistance vessels when given in conjunction with co-enzyme Q.", 
    "124": "We have previously shown that lovastatin induces apoptosis in spontaneously immortalized rat brain neuroblasts. Focal adhesion proteins and protein kinase Cdelta (PKCdelta) have been implicated in the regulation of apoptosis. We found that lovastatin exposure induced focal adhesion kinase, Crk-associated substrate (p130(Cas)), PKCdelta cleavage and caspase-3 activation in a concentration-dependent manner. Lovastatin effects were fully prevented by mevalonate. The cleavage of p130(Cas) was almost completely inhibited by z-DEVD-fmk, a specific caspase-3 inhibitor, and z-VAD-fmk, a broad spectrum caspase inhibitor, indicating that cleavage is mediated by caspase-3. In contrast, the lovastatin-induced cleavage of PKCdelta was only blocked by z-VAD-fmk suggesting that PKCdelta cleavage is caspase-dependent but caspase-3-independent. Additionally, z-VAD-fmk partially prevented lovastatin-induced neuroblast apoptosis. The present data show that lovastatin may induce neuroblast apoptosis by both caspase-dependent and independent pathways. These findings may suggest that the caspase-dependent component leading to the neuroblast cell death is likely to involve the cleavage of focal adhesion proteins and PKCdelta, which may be partially responsible for some biochemical features of neuroblast apoptosis induced by lovastatin.", 
    "125": "Aortic valve disease includes a wide spectrum of conditions, from leaflets thickening to hemodynamically significant aortic stenosis and is one of the most important causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Studies performed during the last years bring consistent evidence that these lesions of the aortic valves share remarkable similarities with atherosclerotic lesions. They also reveal new risk factors for its development, which are superposed in fact with the major risk factors for atherosclerosis. Moreover, large prospective studies reported an increased risk for cardiovascular events and for total and cardiovascular mortality in patients with aortic sclerosis. Hence, recent papers also propose therapeutic targets, using statins for delaying the progression of the disease.", 
    "126": "Transport proteins play an important role in the adsorption, distribution and elimination of a wide variety of drugs. Therefore, it is not surprising that transporter-based drug interactions can occur in the clinic. These interactions can lead to changes in toxicity and/or efficacy of the affected drug. Here, we review such interactions and ask if these interactions could have been predicted from in vitro data. Conducting such in vitro-in vivo correlation is important for predicting future transporter-based drug interactions.", 
    "127": "The available data have suggested a significant association between hypertriglyceridemia and cardiovascular disease. Although atherogenic dyslipidemia in patients with metabolic syndrome is characterized by high triglyceride, low HDL cholesterol and near normal LDL cholesterol levels, lowering LDL cholesterol is the first priority in treating dyslipidemia in patients with metabolic syndrome. The use of statins as monotherapy is still leaving some of these patients with mixed atherogenic dyslipidemia at high risk for coronary events. So, it seems beneficial to add a fibrate to statin therapy in the management of dyslipidemia of metabolic syndrome, especially in patients with inadequately corrected triglyceride levels with statin monotherapy.", 
    "128": "The effect of ethyl eicosapentanoate (EPA-E) on statin-induced rhabdomyolysis was investigated by co-administration of EPA-E and pravastatin (PV), as a typical statin, to Eisai hyperbilirubinemic rats (EHBR). It was confirmed that the plasma PV concentration was not affected by simultaneous administration of EPA-E, and there was no cumulative increase of PV during prolonged co-administration of EPA-E and PV. Muscular degeneration was prominent (incidence 5/5; average grade 3.5 (range 2-4)) in EHBR treated with PV alone at 200 mg/kg/day for 14 days, but co-administration of EPA-E at doses of 100, 300, and 1000 mg/kg/day decreased the average grades to 1.4 (range 0.3-3.0), 0.5 (0.2-1.0), and 0.6 (0.0-1.7), respectively. Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) and myoglobin levels in plasma were well correlated with the grade of skeletal muscle degeneration. Thus, EPA-E appears to reduce the severity of statin-induced rhabdomyolysis.", 
    "129": "The development of atherosclerotic plaque is a highly regulated and complex process which occurs as a result of structural and functional alterations in endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells (SMCs), monocytes/macrophages, T-lymphocytes and platelets. The plaque formation in the coronary arteries or rupture of the plaque in the peripheral vasculature in latter stages of atherosclerosis triggers the onset of acute ischemic events involving myocardium. Although lipid lowering with statins has been established as an important therapy for the treatment of atherosclerosis, partially beneficial effects of statins beyond decreasing lipid levels has shifted the focus to develop newer drugs that can affect directly the process of atherosclerosis. Blockade of renin angiotensin system, augmentation of nitric oxide availability, reduction of Ca(2+) influx, prevention of oxidative stress as well as attenuation of inflammation, platelet activation and SMC proliferation have been recognized as targets for drug treatment to control the development, progression and management of atherosclerosis. A major challenge for future drug development is to formulate a combination therapy affecting different targets to improve the treatment of atherosclerosis.", 
    "130": "Over the past 15 years, the efficacy of several classes of medications on the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis has been documented. The objectives of medical therapy are triple: to avoid or control the evolution of the atherosclerotic process, control associated risk factors, and, whenever appropriate, to control symptoms. Four classes of medications have documented a major clinical benefit by decreasing mortality and severe adverse cardiovascular events: antiplatelet agents, beta-blockers, statins and ACE inhibitors. These medications should therefore constitute first line therapy. Beside the use of medications, life style changes (Mediterranean diet, physical exercise, smoking cessation) are also necessary.",

It is agreed upon that open surgical or endovascular treatment is indicated if maximum AAA diameter exceeds 5 to 5.5 cm. Continuing aneurysmal degeneration of aortoiliac arteries accounts for significant morbidity, especially in patients undergoing endovascular AAA repair. Purpose of this review is to give an overview of the current evidence of medical treatment of AAA and describe prospects ofpotential pharmacological approaches towards prevention of aneurysmal degeneration of small AAAs and to highlight possible adjunctive medical treatment approaches after open surgical or endovascular AAA therapy.", 
    "132": "Inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzymeA reductase are widely used in the management and prevention of cardiovascular disease. In addition to its major activity, plasma lipid lowering, statins have shown a wide spectrum of additional effects that may contribute to their benefits in the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Our objective was to study whether treatment with a statin, pravastatin, could reduce thrombosis triggered by damaged vessels without changing plasma cholesterol levels. A cholesterol-clamp animal model was developed by feeding swine for 100 days on an hypercholesterolemic (HL) diet; in the last 50 days, they were randomly assigned to receive either placebo (HLC) or pravastatin (5 mg . kg(-1) . day(-1)) (HLP) in addition to the hypercholesterolemic diet. A normocholesterolemic control group (NLC) was simultaneously studied. There were no significant differences in total cholesterol, LDL and HDL plasma levels between the two groups; however, mural thrombosis triggered by both an eroded and disrupted vessel wall was significantly inhibited by pravastatin (P<0.05). Axial dependence analysis of platelet deposition revealed that pravastatin treatment reduced the increase in platelet deposition associated to the shear rate increase at the stenosis. Additionally, pravastatin treatment significantly reduced platelet membrane RhoA expression (P<0.05) and vascular wall tissue factor (TF) protein expression (P<0.05). In addition to its lipid lowering effects, pravastatin can reduce blood thrombogenicity by mechanisms independent of plasma cholesterol lowering.",

Patients of group A received atorvastatin 10 mg before dinner plus 2 g/day chitosan in two divided doses. The groupB patients received atorvastatin 10 mg plus placebo. Patients were followed up for a period of 6 weeks. There was significant reduction in mean body weight in group A patients (3.14% versus 1,29% of body weight, p<0.05). There was also a significant rise in HDL cholesterol value (3.8% versus 1.07%, p=0.02) in group A patients. However, there was no significant reduction in the mean values of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglyceride in the two groups, although group A patients showed marginally lower values.",

The 2 groups did not differ in baseline HRV standard deviation of normal-to-normal intervals (SDNN) (RR): 24.6 +/- 2.8 ms in statin group versus 24.8 +/- 3.1 ms in controls, P = .72; square root of the mean of squared differences between successive intervals (rMSSD) (RR): 21.2 +/- 2.7 ms versus 21.7 +/- 2.9 ms, P = .43), QTV SDNN (QT): 6.4 +/- 1.5 ms versus 6.4+/-1.7, P = .96; rMSSD QT): 9.0 +/- 2.4 ms versus 8.7 +/- 2.9 ms, P = .65, and QTc interval 450 +/- 30 ms versus 446 +/- 27 ms, P = .59. At 3 months, the statin group displayed higher HRV SDNN RR): 27.2 +/- 4.9 ms versus 24.4 +/- 2.8 ms in controls, P = .003; rMSSD RR: 24.7 +/- 4.2 ms versus 21.3 +/- 5.6 ms, P = .004, lower QTV SDNN (QT): 5.1 +/- 1.9 ms versus 6.5 +/- 2.1, P = .004; rMSSD (QT): 6.6 +/- 2.8 ms versus 8.8 +/- 3.1 ms, P = .002, and shorter QTc interval 437 +/- 29 ms versus 450 +/- 25 ms, P = .03 than the control group.",

Patients with bladder cancer often have concomitant hyperlipidemia and cardiac disease due to common risk factors such as smoking and advanced age. As such, they are often prescribed HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), which have been suggested to affect tumor growth patterns.", 
    "138": "Two human transitional cell carcinoma cell lines--RT4 and KU-7--were exposed to atorvastatin at concentrations from 0 (control) to 100 microM for 48 or 72 hours. The effects on cell proliferation, DNA synthesis, and apoptosis were respectively evaluated using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide colorimetric assay and the thymidine incorporation assay and by quantifying DNA fragmentation by propidium iodide fluorescence and flow cytometry.", 
    "139": "Atorvastatin inhibited cell proliferation and DNA synthesis in both bladder cancer cell lines. This led to significant cytotoxicity as demonstrated by DNA fragmentation and induction of apoptosis.", 
    "140": "Atorvastatin exhibits significant antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic activity in human bladder cancer cells. This, coupled with its established clinical safety profile, provides a rationale for its use as a potential chemopreventive agent against bladder cancer.",

    "142": "A total of 512 consecutive patients were treated with permanent brachytherapy for clinical Stage T1c-T3aNxM0 prostate cancer at least 3 years before analysis. Biochemical progression-free survival was defined by a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of 0.4 ng/mL or less after nadir. The median follow-up was 5.3 years. The clinical, treatment, and dosimetric parameters evaluated included use of any and specific statins, age, body mass index, PSA level, Gleason score, percentage of positive biopsies, perineural invasion, prostate volume, planning volume, dosimetric quality, supplemental external beam radiotherapy, tobacco use, hypertension, and diabetes.", 
    "143": "The actuarial 8-year biochemical progression-free survival rate for the entire group was 94.6%. On forward conditional Cox regression analysis, the pretreatment PSA level and percentage of positive biopsies were statistically significant predictors of biochemical outcome. However, a significantly lower pretreatment PSA level, percentage of positive biopsy cores, and PSA density and earlier clinical stage were found in the statin group. Almost every clinical presentation parameter comparison at least favored statin users. When stratified by any or specific statin use, 97.0% of patients taking statins compared with 94.3% not taking statins and 97.8% of patients taking atorvastatin compared with 94.7% taking other statins were free of biochemical progression.", 
    "144": "The results of this brachytherapy investigation with the longest reported follow-up period to date suggest that statins, especially atorvastatin, may improve most clinical presentations with a nonsignificant improvement in 8-year biochemical progression-free survival.", 
    "145": "In observational studies, statins are associated with lower mortality in patients with heart failure (HF), including those with nonischemic HF. Such benefits could be related to anti-inflammatory effects; however, the effects of statins on systemic inflammation in HF are not well-established. We conducted a 16-week, single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover clinical trial of the effects of atorvastatin 10 mg/day on concentrations of systemic inflammatory markers in 22 patients with HF (including 20 with nonischemic HF) with New York Heart Association class II or III symptoms and left ventricular ejection fraction of <40%. The absolute and percentage of changes in inflammatory marker levels were evaluated using analysis of variance. Statin treatment reduced the concentrations of soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 by 132 pg/ml (p = 0.04) and 8% (p = 0.056), C-reactive protein by 1.6 mg/L (p = 0.006) and 37% (p = 0.0002), and, after adjustment for treatment order, endothelin-1 by 0.21 pg/ml (p = 0.007) and 17% (p = 0.01). In post hoc analyses, the reduction in tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 levels was highest among patients with elevated levels at baseline (at or higher than the median of 1,055 pg/ml, p interaction = 0.001), among whom statin therapy reduced the levels by 306 pg/ml (p <0.001) and 22% (p <0.001). Statin treatment did not significantly affect the levels of other inflammatory markers, including interleukin-6 and brain natriuretic peptide. In conclusion, short-term atorvastatin therapy reduced the levels of several important inflammatory markers in patients with HF.", 
    "146": "The Air Force/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention Study (AFCAPS/TexCAPS) first reported its results in 1998, before the 2001 publication of the National Cholesterol Education Program-Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines (NCEP-ATP III) and 2004 update. Our objective was to investigate the impact of these guidelines on the AFCAPS/TexCAPS cohort. The main outcome measures were the event rates of first acute major coronary events (AMCEs), which were reduced 39% by lovastatin (95% confidence interval [CI] 21% to 53%, p <0.001) in the 65% of the cohort eligible for drug therapy and by 34% (95% CI -9% to 60%, p = 0.108) in the remaining 35% for whom drug therapy was considered optional. The evaluation of other guideline components included a 44% (95% CI 27% to 58%, p <0.001) reduction in AMCEs in subjects with baseline high-density lipoprotein cholesterol <40 mg/dl and a 41% (95% CI 19% to 57%) reduction in AMCEs in subjects with the metabolic syndrome. In the recent update, patients who had a moderately high risk of coronary heart disease and a baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of 100 to 130 mg/dl could be considered for therapy with a medication to lower the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level to <100 mg/dl. A total of 334 subjects (5.1%) were in this group, in whom lovastatin reduced the risk of AMCEs by 68% (95% CI 12% to 88%, p = 0.027). However, 21% of the AMCEs were missed by the guidelines. Metabolic syndrome was noted in 48% of these subjects and may help define those in whom treatment with a medication is now considered optional. In conclusion, the ability of the ATP III guidelines and its update has markedly improved our ability to define coronary heart disease risk; however, other components of the guidelines, such as non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and the optional low-density lipoprotein cholesterol target goal of <100 mg/dl, still require additional evaluation.", 
    "147": "We evaluated the relation between lipids and precocity of coronary artery disease (CAD) in the real world as characterized by increasing statin use. The highest mean values of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and ratio of triglycerides to HDL cholesterol were found when CAD was detected in patients who were <50 years of age (p <0.01 for all); the opposite occurred for HDL cholesterol (p <0.01). Triglycerides and ratio of triglycerides to HDL cholesterol were the most powerful, independent variables related to precocity of CAD.", 
    "148": "The effect of moderate and intensive lipid lowering on plaque progression and arterial remodeling at coronary branch points was investigated. Intensive (+1 +/- 19.6%), but not moderate (+4.1 +/- 15.1%), lipid lowering prevented an increase in the percent [corrected] plaque area at the branch points. The 2 strategies were associated with increased areas of the lumen (+7.6% to 9.4%) and external elastic membrane (+9.6% to 10.8%). In contrast, there was no significant change in plaque, lumen, and/or external elastic membrane areas at the nonbranch point site. These results suggest that intensive lipid lowering can have a dramatic effect on atheroma-prone regions and that remodeling in response to changes in plaque is a heterogenous process.", 
    "149": "Platelet and endothelial activation has been shown to be increased in patients with intermittent claudication (IC). Recent studies have suggested that exercise may induce further platelet activation. The aims of this study were to investigate the effect of exercising to maximum walking distance on platelet and endothelial function in patients with intermittent claudication who were receiving statin and aspirin therapy compared with age matched healthy controls.", 
    "150": "Platelet aggregation through COX-mediated and thrombin receptor activator peptide (TRAP)-stimulated GPIIb/IIIa pathways was measured by the Ultegra point of care system in 20 patients with IC on aspirin and 20 healthy volunteers before, immediately and 1h after exercising to treadmill maximal walking distance (MWD). Soluble P-selectin, vWF and sICAM were measured using an enzyme linked immuno-sorbent assay technique.", 
    "151": "Baseline platelet aggregation was significantly reduced in patients with IC compared to volunteers (p<0.05). In patients, exercising to MWD significantly reduced platelet aggregation (COX, median -5% [range -24 to 13%]; p = 0.02; GPIIIa/IIb, median -13% [range -72 to 33%]; p = 0.02) immediately post-exercise which returned to baseline values at 1 h. There was no change in the healthy volunteers following the same median duration of exercise. Baseline sP-selectin levels were higher in the patients with IC compared to the healthy volunteers [Median values (interquartile range), 42.72 (33.28-54.24) versus 29.16 (24.40-34.10), p = 0.0003] but there were no differences in vWF levels. Both sP-selectin and vWF levels increased significantly in the control and patient group following exercise (p<0.005). sICAM were higher at baseline in the patients with IC but were unchanged following exercise [Median values (interquartile range),560.9 (405.5-739.4) versus 467.0 (325.7-643.4), p<0.05].", 
    "152": "This study is the first to show that platelet aggregation is reduced immediately following treadmill exercise to maximum walking distance in patients with IC despite a rise in sP-selectin and vWF, suggesting endothelial activation. The inhibition of platelet aggregation after exercise in subjects on antiplatelet and statin therapy suggests that exercise is unlikely to exacerbate platelet thrombus formation in patients with IC.", 
    "153": "Much has been written about the potential of pharmacogenetic testing to inform therapy based on an individual's genetic makeup, and to decide the most effective choice of available drugs, or to avoid dangerous side effects. Currently, there is little hard data for either in the field of cardiovascular disease. The usual approach has been opportunistic use of drug trials in unrelated patients, and to look for differences in response or outcome by \"candidate gene\" genotype, for example genes coding for drug metabolising enzymes (activators and metabolisers), and enzymes and receptors involved in lipid metabolism, adrenergic response, etc. As with all association studies, initially promising results have often failed the test of replication in larger studies, and the relationship between the CETP Taq-I variant and response to statins has now been disproved. The strongest data to date is the report [Chasman, D.I., Posada, D., Subrahmanyan, L., Cook, N.R., Stanton Jr., V.P., Ridker, P.M., 2004. Pharmacogenetic study of statin therapy and cholesterol reduction. J. Am. Med. Assoc. 291, 2821-2827] of a poorer cholesterol-lowering response to Pravastatin in the 7% of patients carrying a certain haplotype of the HMG CoA reductase gene (14% fall versus 19%), but if this is overcome simply by a higher dose, it is of little clinical relevance. Currently, the best example of avoiding side effects is determining genotype at the CYP2C9 locus with respect of warfarin treatment, since carriers for functional variants (>20% of the population) require lower doses for optimal anticoagulation, and homozygotes, although rare, may well experience serious bleeding if given a usual dose. The full potential of this field will only be realised with much further work.",

This effect was not evident in a group on statin alone (3.95 mg/l +/- 3.33 vs 2.48 mg/l +/- 2.39; p=0.31). 6-keto-PGF-1alpha increased not significantly in both groups.

    "158": "In the antihypertensive population, a normalisation of blood pressure level must be the first objective. The Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT) - Blood Pressure lowering arm again confirms this assertion. The benefit has been proportional to the blood pressure decrease. However, the use of newest antihypertensive drugs (the long acting dihydropyridine calcium antagonist amlodipine very often associated to the ACE inhibitor perindopril) in the hypertensive population aged from 40 to 79 years with at least 3 additional risk factors showed significantly lower rates of cardiovascular and total mortalities, cardiovascular events, new diabetes or renal impairment as compared to the atenolol-based combination drug regimen (with thiazide as required). It should be noted that almost all the patients also received a low dose of a hypolipidemic drug, atorvastatin. Both arms (the statin arm and the arm using antihypertensive drugs) have yet been stopped, after 3 and 5 years, respectively related to the large beneficial effects noted with the new antihypertensive and statin treatments, although the primary endpoints (non fatal myocardial infarctival and fatal coronary heart disease) were not reached. This study raises many unsolved questions about the explanation for such benefits or the future management of the hypertensive people whose characteristics were very similar to those people frequently encountered in clinical practice. However, the present study emphasizes the considerable efficacy of a combination of amlodipine-perindopril and a low dose of statin.", 
    "159": "Immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy can rarely be associated with thyroid disease. We present a case of a young lady with nephrotic range proteinuria, microscopic hematuria, a creatinine clearance of 67 ml/min, biopsy proven IgA nephropathy, in whom hypercholesterolemia persisted after immunosuppressive therapy induced remission of glomerulonephritis. Fluvastatin was given but rhabdomyolysis developed. Unexpectedly, CK remained elevated following discontinuation of fluvastatin. Secondary amenorrhoea prompted endocrine work-up and hypothyroidism was diagnosed. Cholesterol, CK and TSH values became normal within 3 months on L-thyroxin therapy. The literature of the association of glomerular diseases and thyroid illness is reviewed. We would like to draw the attention to the possible association of glomerular pathologies and thyroid diseases and the importance of ruling out hypothyroidism and measuring CK level before starting statin therapy."
