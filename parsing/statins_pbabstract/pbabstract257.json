Numerous clinical trials have demonstrated that statins can have a significant effect in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases in the general population. In patients with renal failure, this drug preserves the hypolypemizing efficacy found in the general population without increasing their unwanted side-effects. The re-analysis of data from epidemiological studies conducted on the general population has confirmed that statins provide cardiovascular protection also in subjects with renal failure. These data have been partly confirmed by the findings made by 4D (Die Deutsche Diabetes Dialyse Studie) and Alert studies, conducted on diabetic patients on dialysis and patients with renal transplants, respectively. The results of other studies, such as AURORA, SHARP, REnal and Vascular End stage Disease, and ESPLANADE, clearly indicate that statins prevent cardiovascular disease in patients with renal insufficiency, just as they do in the general population.",

Statins have beneficial anti-inflammatory effects on vascular structure regardless of cholesterol reduction. It was hypothesized that alterations in myocardial microvascular structure in swine renovascular hypertension (RVH) would be improved by simvastatin treatment. Three groups of pigs were studied after 12 wk: normal (n = 7), RVH (n = 7), or RVH+simvastatin (RVH+S; 80 mg/d; n = 6). Left ventricular muscle mass and myocardial perfusion were determined in vivo using electron beam computed tomography, and myocardial samples then were scanned ex vivo using micro-computed tomography for measurement of the spatial density of myocardial microvessels (80 to 500 microm) in situ. Capillary density and myocardial expression of inflammatory and growth factors were determined in myocardial tissue. The effects of simvastatin on inflammation-induced tube formation were evaluated in vitro in human umbilical vein endothelial cells that were exposed to TNF-alpha. RVH and RVH+S had similarly increased arterial pressure and serum creatinine. However, left ventricular hypertrophy was prevented by simvastatin, and myocardial perfusion was increased. Compared with normal, RVH showed increased spatial density of microvessels (169.6 +/- 21 versus 107.7 +/- 15.2 vessels/cm(2); P < 0.05), which was decreased in RVH+S (72.5 +/- 14.9 vessels/cm(2)), whereas capillary density remained similar to normal. RVH also increased myocardial expression of inflammatory and growth factors, which were reversed by simvastatin. Furthermore, simvastatin attenuated TNF-alpha-induced angiogenesis in vitro. Simvastatin prevents myocardial microvascular remodeling and hypertrophy in experimental RVH independent of lipid lowering. This protective effect is partly mediated by blunted expression as well as angiogenic activity of inflammatory cytokines.",

The present study was aimed at investigating the effects of Anwala churna (Emblica officinalis Gaertn.), an Ayurvedic preparation on memory, total serum cholesterol levels and brain cholinesterase activity in mice. Anwala churna was administered orally in three doses (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg) for fifteen days to different groups of young and aged mice. Elevated plus maze and passive avoidance apparatus served as the exteroceptive behavioral models for testing memory. Diazepam-, scopolamine- and ageing-induced amnesia served as the interoceptive behavioral models. Total serum cholesterol levels and brain cholinesterase activity also estimated. Anwala churna (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg, p.o.) produced a dose-dependent improvement in memory scores of young and aged mice. Furthermore, it reversed the amnesia induced by scopolamine (0.4 mg/kg, i.p.) and diazepam (1 mg/kg, i.p.). Interestingly, brain cholinesterase activity and total cholesterol levels were reduced by Anwala churna administered orally for 15 days.

    "35": "Dyslipidaemia is an important risk factor for the development of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). CKD generates an atherogenic lipid profile, characterised by high triglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and accumulation of small dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, comparable to that in the metabolic syndrome. These changes are due specifically to the effects of CKD on key enzymes, transfer proteins and receptors involved in lipid metabolism. Dyslipidaemia is further compounded by dialysis, immunosuppressive drugs, and concomitant diseases such as diabetes mellitus. Post hoc analyses from large intervention trials suggest the benefit of statins in patients with early CKD, but prospective clinical trials in haemodialysis (HD) and renal transplant recipients have not conclusively shown improvements in hard cardiovascular end-points. The lack of efficacy of statins in late-stage CKD could be a consequence of other disease processes, such as calcific arteriopathy and insulin resistance, which are not modified by lipid-lowering agents. Despite uncertainty and pending the results of ongoing statin trials such as Study of Heart and Renal Protection (SHARP) and AURORA (A study to evaluate the Use of Rosuvastatin in subjects On Regular haemodialysis: an Assessment of survival and cardiovascular events), major international guidelines continue to support statin therapy in CKD and renal transplant patients to reduce cardiovascular risk burden. Because of increased risk of toxicity, particularly myopathy, statins and other lipid-regulating agents should be used cautiously in CKD and renal transplant recipients.", 
    "36": "The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors ('statins') have come into widespread use internationally. There has been a long history of their use in New Zealand and this use has increased in recent years. There has also been an increase in the number of reports to the New Zealand Centre for Adverse Reactions Monitoring (CARM) of suspected psychiatric adverse reactions associated with statins. The reactions mentioned in these reports include depression, memory loss, confusion and aggressive reactions. Convincing reports to CARM of recurrence of these reactions upon rechallenge add weight to recent studies reporting serious psychiatric disturbances in association with statin treatment. Aggressive reactions associated with statins are poorly documented in the literature. These observations emphasise the need to be vigilant in looking for these reactions as they can have a significant personal impact on a patient. The observation that other lipid-lowering agents have similar adverse effects supports the hypothesis that decreased brain cell membrane cholesterol may be important in the aetiology of these psychiatric reactions.",

    "46": "Progesterone is a survival factor in rat periovulatory granulosa cells. The mechanisms involved are unclear but progesterone receptor (PGR) antagonists have been shown to inhibit cholesterol synthesis and induce apoptosis. Furthermore, reports suggest that statins induce apoptosis by inhibition of protein isoprenylation. Statins inhibit the rate-limiting step of the cholesterol synthesis, thereby reducing availability of intermediates used for the post-translational isoprenylation process. It has been suggested that PGR antagonists in a similar manner induce apoptosis by decreasing cholesterol synthesis and thereby protein isoprenylation. In this study we hypothesized that the mechanism by which the nuclear PGR antagonist Org 31,710 induces apoptosis in rat periovulatory granulosa cells, is by decreasing cholesterol synthesis and thereby general cell protein isoprenylation. Incubation of isolated granulosa cells with Org 31,710 or simvastatin for 22 hr resulted in increased apoptosis and reduced cholesterol synthesis. However, simvastatin caused a substantial inhibition of cholesterol synthesis after 6 hr in culture without inducing apoptosis. In contrast, Org 31,710 had only a modest effect on cholesterol synthesis after 6 hr while it significantly induced apoptosis. Addition of isoprenylation substrates partially reversed apoptosis induced by simvastatin and to a lesser extent apoptosis induced by Org 31,710. In addition, and in contrast to Org 31,710, simvastatin caused a decrease in isoprenylation of a selected isoprenylation marker protein, the Ras-related protein RAB11. In conclusion, we demonstrate that the PGR antagonist inhibits cholesterol synthesis in granulosa cells but reduced protein isoprenylation is not the mediating mechanism of increased apoptosis as previously hypothesized.", 
    "47": "LDL apheresis is a safe and very effective extracorporeal treatment of refractory hypercholesterolemia. LDL cholesterol levels can be reduced with this procedure by more than 60%. C-reactive protein (CRP) is a known marker of inflammation in atherosclerosis. Interestingly CRP can be effectively removed by a single LDL apheresis, but further studies are needed to substantiate the effect of extracorporeal reduction of CRP on the progression of atherosclerosis. However, adhesion molecules and activities of inflammatory cells were also found to be reduced after a single LDL apheresis. The biochemical composition of newly formed LDL particles after apheresis is altered: LDL particles isolated after LDL apheresis had an increased resistance to oxidative stress in vitro. In addition, antioxidants are not depleted by LDL apheresis. The extracorporal method itself does not have a negative impact on the oxidative/antioxidative balance. A recent investigation showed that LDL-cholesterol had a more pronounced effect on blood rheology than fibrinogen. This observation may explain why a single LDL apheresis leads to better myocardial perfusion, as demonstrated by PET in patients with hypercholesterolemia. These additional effects have so far only been known with statins. Further investigations are needed to substantiate the observed potentially beneficial effects of LDLapheresis beyond its effect of lowering LDL.",

Because of a growing expectancy of lives, the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases is increasing, and thus the number of surgical patients presenting with a cardiovascular risk profile. Based upon pathophysiological considerations, different interventions to lower perioperative cardiovascular risk have been evaluated. The mostly discussed intervention believed to prevent cardiovascular complications in the perioperative period is the use of beta-blockers. Although many authors agree that perioperative beta-blockade is effective in high-risk patients, less is known about the optimal timing, dosage and the identification of patients in whom the intervention would be beneficial. Based upon the available data we try to answer questions about timing and dosage, and we discuss possible side effects and economic questions. Another cardioprotective option is the use of statins. Besides their lipid-lowering properties, so called pleiotropic effects are believed to decrease cardiac risk. Furthermore, different interventions can be used in addition to or as an alternative to perioperative beta-blocker therapy, such as alpha-2 agonists, thoracic epidural analgesia or coronary revascularization.",

Vascular surgery in these patients, who often have concomitant coronary or cerebrovascular atherosclerosis, is associated with significant risk. Steady improvements in endovascular revascularization techniques have made this a safe and effective alternate revascularization modality. Percutaneous peripheral vascular interventions have increased dramatically in recent years, from 90,000 in 1994 to more than 200,000 in 1997, and endovascular techniques may soon replace up to 50% of traditional vascular operations.

The present study was undertaken to evaluate whether pravastatin prevents ischemia-induced lethal VF, simultaneously examining myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in ischemic myocardial tissues. Anesthetized rats were subjected to 30-min ischemia and 60-min reperfusion after chronic administration of pravastatin (0.02, 0.2, and 2 mg/kg), fluvastatin (2 and 4 mg/kg), or vehicle for 22 days, orally, once daily. ECG and blood pressure were continually recorded, and MPO was measured by a spectrophotometer. Pravastatin and fluvastatin significantly (P<0.05) decreased MPO activities, but only pravastatin decreased the incidence of ischemia-induced lethal VF. Both statins had no significant effects on body weight, blood pressure, heart rate, and QT interval as we reported earlier. Our results prove further that pravastatin has benefits to decrease cardiovascular mortality beyond its cholesterol-lowering effect. Pravastatin is more potent than fluvastatin in prevention of arrhythmias.

Foam cell formation represents a key process in atherosclerotic plaque formation. We revealed that platelets regulate recruitment and differentiation of CD34 (+) progenitor cells into foam cells and endothelial cells. Adhesion studies showed that platelets recruit CD34 (+) progenitor cells via specific adhesion receptors, including P-selection/P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1, and beta (1) and beta (2) integrins. CD34 (+) progenitor cells were coincubated with human platelets for 1 week. We demonstrated that a substantial number of CD34 (+) cells differentiated into foam cells. Hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) and agonists of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha and -gamma (PPAR-alpha and -gamma agonists) reduced this foam cell generation via inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase 9 secretions. Foam cell formation is also induced by low-density lipoproteins (LDLs). It was revealed that platelets take up modified LDL (fluorochrome-conjugated acetylated LDL) that is stored in the dense granules and internalized rapidly into the foam cells. These findings emphasize that the balance between endothelial cell regeneration and platelet-mediated foam cell generation derived from CD34 (+) progenitor cells may play a critical role in atherogenesis and atheroprogression.",

FMD improved in patients on atorvastatin (6.7+/-3.8% to 8.5+/-4.4%; p<0.01), but remained unchanged in placebo-treated patients (8.2+/-3.3% to 8.9+/-5.1%; p=NS). Atorvastatin treatment was associated with decreases of sICAM-1 (from 274.2+/-92.2 to 197.9+/-70.0 ng/ml; p<0.01) and hsCRP (from 0.57+/-0.45 to 0.18+/-0.15 mg/dl; p<0.01), whereas placebo treatment had no effect on these markers. sE-selectin levels were not influenced by either treatment. No correlations were found between changes in FMD, lipids and inflammatory markers.",

These results indicate that osteoporosis and atherosclerosis might be linked by common risk factors or pathological mechanisms. Dyslipidemia has the correlation to both osteoporosis and atherosclerosis. Statins, nitorogen-containing bisphosphonates, and estrogens have the favorable effects on lipid profiles as well as vasculature, or bone mineral density. Thus, these therapeutic approaches might have dual effects on bone and vasculature.",

    "74": "The primary end points were total mortality, Q-wave myocardial infarction, or refractory angina requiring revascularization. The study comprised 611 patients randomly assigned to undergo CABG (n=203), PCI (n=205), or MT (n=203). At the 5-year follow-up, the primary end points occurred in 21.2% of patients who underwent CABG compared with 32.7% treated with PCI and 36% receiving MT alone (P=0.0026). No statistical differences were observed in overall mortality among the 3 groups. In addition, 9.4% of MT and 11.2% of PCI patients underwent repeat revascularization procedures compared with 3.9% of CABG patients (P=0.021). Moreover, 15.3%, 11.2%, and 8.3% of patients experienced nonfatal myocardial infarction in the MT, PCI, and CABG groups, respectively (P<0.001). The pairwise treatment comparisons of the primary end points showed no difference between PCI and MT (relative risk, 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.67 to 1.30) and a significant protective effect of CABG compared with MT (relative risk, 0.53; 95% confidence interval, 0.36 to 0.77).", 
    "75": "All 3 treatment regimens yielded comparable, relatively low rates of death. MT was associated with an incidence of long-term events and rate of additional revascularization similar to those for PCI.

Statins possess pharmacologic properties (independent of cholesterol lowering) that may be beneficial on ventricular remodeling in such patients.", 
    "77": "We conducted a 6-month randomized placebo (PBO)-controlled study of rosuvastatin (ROS) in patients with systolic (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] <40%) CHF of ischemic or nonischemic etiology. The primary end point was change in LVEF by radionuclide ventriculogram. Secondary end points included change in echocardiographic parameters, neurohormonal and inflammatory markers, Packer composite score, death, and heart failure hospitalization. Patients were well matched for baseline values. Compared with PBO (n = 46), ROS patients (n = 40) had a decrease in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (PBO +3, ROS -54%, P < .001). There was no significant change in LVEF by radionuclide ventriculogram (PBO +5.3, ROS +3.2%), fractional shortening by echocardiographic (PBO +2.7, ROS +1.8%), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (PBO -1.7, ROS +0.8 mm), left ventricular end-systolic diameter (PBO -1.9, ROS +0.1 mm).

Cardiac troponin-I levels were significantly higher in patients not preoperatively treated with statins (21.6 +/- 4.1 vs. 13.3 +/- 0.9, p = 0.05), in patients who needed intraoperative cardioversion (16.7 +/- 2.2 vs. 12.2 +/- 0.9, p = 0.07), in patients with postoperative hypophosphatemia (16.9 +/- 10.0 vs. 11.1 +/- 13.7, p = 0.04), postoperative fever (18.6 +/- 3.0 vs. 13.7 +/- 1.0, p = 0.07) and postoperative respiratory complications (23.9 +/- 4.3 vs. 13.5 +/- 1.0, p = 0.04). Step-wise logistic regression analysis revealed the following parameters as independently associated with elevated cTnI levels: preoperative statin treatment (CI 95%-15.9; -1.7, p = 0.02), intraoperative ventricular arrhythmia (CI 95%-0.7; 13.8, p = 0.08), hypophosphatemia (CI 95% 0.9; 8.6, p = 0.02), postoperative fever (CI 95% 0.9; 11.0, p = 0.02), and postoperative respiratory complications (CI 95% 0.1; 0.5, p = 0.01). Of the 156 patients, 50 (32.1%) had postoperative AF. The first episode of AF occurred between postoperative day 1 and 6 (mean-day 2). Mean duration of AF was 21.8 +/- 8.1 hours. Postoperative AF was significantly associated with age above 75 (50% vs. 29.4%, p = 0.01), hypertension (37% vs. 18%, p = 0.02), preoperative calcium channel blockers treatment (44% vs. 26%, p = 0.02), furosemide treatment (58% vs. 30%, p = 0.05), and preoperative left atrial diameter above 40 mm (56% vs. 29%, p = 0.01).

No association was found between troponin levels and postoperative AF. Multivariable analysis found only left atrial enlargement and prolonged hospital stay independently associated with AF.", 
    "82": "A significant correlation between clinical IAPs and cTnI plasma level elevation was found after cardiac surgery. There was no correlation between these parameters and postoperative AF, and there was no correlation between postoperative plasma cTnI levels and the occurrence of AF.

    "83": "Inflammation and cytokine pathways are crucial for the development and progression of atherosclerotic lesions. In this review, the hypothesis that immunomodulatory drugs provide a possible therapeutic modality for cardiovascular disease is evaluated. Therefore, after a short overview of the specific inflammatory pathways involved in atherosclerosis, literature on the effect of several immunomodulatory drugs, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, specific cyclooxygenase inhibitors and immunosuppressive drugs, used currently in the prevention of rejection after organ transplant, on the development and progression of atherosclerosis is reviewed. In addition, the pleiotropic immunomodulatory effect of two established cardiovascular drugs (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and statins) is discussed.", 
    "84": "The GALAXY Program is a series of clinical studies investigating the efficacy and tolerability of rosuvastatin in line with the hypothesis that the statin with the greatest efficacy for improving the atherogenic lipid profile and beneficially modifying inflammatory markers will also slow progression of atherosclerosis and improve cardiovascular outcomes. Completed studies report that rosuvastatin is more effective than comparator statins in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, improving the lipid profile and enabling patients to achieve lipid goals, including revised, more stringent goals, even in high-risk patients. Studies have also reported that rosuvastatin can arrest and even regress atherosclerosis. Ongoing outcomes studies will determine whether these beneficial effects of rosuvastatin translate into reduced morbidity and mortality.", 
    "85": "Since the identification of a fungal metabolite that inhibits HMG-CoA reductase in 1976, statins have emerged rapidly as the global leader in pharmacotherapeutics designed to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). In conjunction, practice guidelines have recommended increasingly aggressive measures to improve coronary heart disease (CHD) outcomes by lowering LDL-C. By virtue of unique chemical characteristics, enhanced binding thermodynamics and limited cytochrome P450 3A4 metabolism, rosuvastatin calcium has a safety profile in line with currently marketed statins, but a different efficacy profile. Mirroring this chemical profile, the GALAXY program represents a comprehensive evaluation of the efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness of rosuvastatin in individuals representing various clinical diagnoses, pathophysiological states and ethnicities. Also results from the Justification for the Use of statins in Primary prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) study could provide further evidence for the use of rosuvastatin in individuals with traditional and emerging CHD risk factors, such as an elevated high sensitivity C-reactive protein level. This review will provide a comprehensive evaluation of the chemistry, clinical efficacy, safety and tolerability of rosuvastatin, and discuss the future role in the management of CHD and atherosclerosis.", 
    "86": "Recent end point trials of lipid-lowering drugs have shown that patients at very high-risk for coronary disease benefit from treatments that lowers low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL cholesterol) plasma levels< or =70 mg/dl and that patients with at least 2 risk factors benefit from LDL cholesterol levels< or =100 mg/dl. Epidemiologic studies have shown that the concentration of high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL cholesterol) is a strong, independent, inverse predictor of coronary disease risk. Innovative pharmacological approaches to raise low HDL cholesterol levels are currently of considerable interest, especially for patients with type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome.", 
    "87": "Rosuvastatin has shown superior efficacy in lowering LDL cholesterol, although evidence of clinical benefit is actually lacking. Ezetimibe is a lipid-lowering drug that inhibits absorption of dietary and biliary cholesterol. Its co-administration with statin has given very interesting results. Niacin is the most effective of currently available options for raising HDL cholesterol, although tolerability can be an issue, with serious side effects such as loss of glucose control and liver toxicity. Flushing may occur in 80% of treated patients. Two CETP inhibitors have shown therapeutical efficacy to raise HDL cholesterol, but clinical benefit remains uncertain.", 
    "88": "Recent studies have begun to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that promote the generation and progressive nature of atrial fibrillation. Evidence from both experimental and clinical investigations has implicated an important role for the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, inflammation, and oxidative stress, with data that suggest a potential beneficial effect for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, aldosterone receptor antagonists, antiinflammatory agents, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. In addition, compounds that increase gap junctional conductance or that block 5-hydroxytryptamine-4 receptors have also shown promise in the experimental setting. Large-scale, prospective clinical trials will clarify the utility of these new therapeutic approaches to prevent atrial fibrillation in specific clinical settings.", 
    "89": "Many cardiovascular events are clinical manifestations of underlying atherosclerotic disease. The progression of atherosclerosis, traditionally measured by angiography, is predictive of future clinical events and is a valid surrogate marker of cardiovascular (CV) disease. There is growing interest in using novel surrogate end points in clinical trials to expedite the development of new CV therapies. Innovative imaging technologies, such as intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), may carry advantages for the evaluation of coronary atherosclerotic burden and disease progression. Unlike angiography, which displays only the opacified luminal \"silhouette,\" IVUS provides transmural imaging of the entire arterial wall and permits both detection of early-stage atherosclerosis and accurate cross-sectional and even 3-dimensional quantification of plaques. Intravascular ultrasound is now used to guide therapeutic interventions and for diagnostic purposes, primarily for the evaluation of ambiguous lesions and left main coronary artery disease. In addition, clinical studies are using IVUS serially to measure plaque progression, which appears to be related to future CV events. Although the probative force of clinical end point studies still is stronger, IVUS is catching up. Currently, several trials of CV therapies use IVUS-determined plaque progression as the end point. The rationale for using IVUS-based surrogate end points in clinical trials is discussed in the present review. Key advantages of using IVUS-based surrogate end points versus clinical outcome include smaller patient numbers and substantially shorter trial durations; this reduces costs and may expedite the development and testing of new drugs. We expect in the near future a further increase of the use of IVUS-based surrogate end points in trials that evaluate novel CV therapies targeting on coronary atherosclerosis.",

    "91": "We performed a post hoc analysis from the Randomized Trial of Cholesterol Lowering in 4,444 Patients with Coronary Heart Disease: The Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study. Of 4,444 participants, 2,314 (52.1%) had mild chronic renal insufficiency defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 75 mL/min/1.73 m(2) (<1.25 mL/s), measured using the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation. The primary end point was all-cause mortality.",

Rates of major coronary events (adjusted HR, 0.67; CI, 0.56 to 0.79) and coronary revascularization (adjusted HR, 0.62; CI, 0.49 to 0.77) also were significantly lower in the simvastatin group. No significant decreases in stroke incidence were observed in the simvastatin group (adjusted HR, 0.88; CI, 0.55 to 1.39). The side-effect profile was similar between the 2 treatment groups.",

    "94": "The mechanisms by which hydroxymethylglutaryl CoenzymeA reductase inhibitors (statins) reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular morbidity and mortality remain poorly understood. Statins have been shown to modulate the levels of different inflammatory proteins both in carotid atherosclerotic plaques and in the blood of patients with atherosclerosis. In this work, we hypothesize that statins could also modulate the levels of the proteins secreted by cultured atherosclerotic plaques. Thus, the secretomes obtained from complicated atherosclerotic plaques incubated in the presence/absence of atorvastatin (10 micromol/l, 24 h) were analysed and compared by two-dimensional electrophoresis, considering the fibrous adjacent areas as controls. In total, 54 proteins (83 protein isoforms) were identified by Mass Spectrometry (MS): 24 proteins were increased and 20 proteins decreased in atheroma plaque supernatants compared to controls. Some of these proteins, like Cathepsin D, could play a significant role in plaque instability, becoming a potential target for therapeutical treatment. Interestingly, 66% of the proteins differentially released by atherosclerotic plaques reverted to control values after administration of atorvastatin, among them, Cathepsin D. Moreover, plaques obtained from patients who received atorvastatin treatment prior to carotid endarterectomy showed decreased Cathepsin D expression relative to plaques from non-treated patients. In conclusion, this proteomic approach has shown that statins are able to modulate the secretome of atherosclerotic plaques, and new therapeutical targets for statins have been characterised.",

    "101": "There were no differences in baseline hemodynamics in rats treated with simvastatin or placebo. However, in rats treated with simvastatin the increase in portal pressure induced by volume expansion was significantly attenuated. In isolated and perfused cirrhotic livers simvastatin pre-treatment significantly attenuated the pressure response to methoxamine, and significantly improved paradoxical vasoconstriction induced by acetylcholine. These effects were not observed in the presence of a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor. Simvastatin increased eNOS expression, Akt-dependent eNOS phosphorylation and cGMP liver content.",

Forty-three patients (44%) were on statin treatment at least 3 months before endarterectomy and 55 (56%) had never received statin treatment. The intensity of intraplaque angiogenesis was evaluated with immunohistochemistry using the antibody CD34. The number of capillaries per mm(2) was measured with a custom designed image tool analysis. With the exception of serum total cholesterol levels and serum low-density cholesterol levels, the two groups of patients did not vary significantly in cardiovascular risk factors and in parameters pertaining to the procedure profile. Patients on statin treatment had less capillaries per mm(2) than patients not receiving this kind of drugs (0.97+/-0.61 per mm(2) versus 1.39+/-0.98 per mm(2), p=0.031). Univariate associations between possible explanatory variables and number of capillaries per mm(2) were tested using Spearman rank R. Variables associated with a p-value <0.20 (age, serum creatinine, serum total cholesterol, serum low-density lipoprotein, serum homocysteine, presence of diabetes mellitus and statin treatment) were entered in a multivariable model. Multivariate analysis showed that statin treatment was the only independent predictor (t=-5.39, p<0.001) of intraplaque angiogenesis.",

In the present study, we aimed to evaluate possible effects of atorvastatin on oxidative stress, neutrophil accumulation, and contractile response of terminal ileum segments in rats subjected to intestinal ischemia/reperfusion. Intestinal ischemia/reperfusion model was generated by clamping the superior mesenteric artery for 30 min followed by reperfusion for 3 h. Oral administration of atorvastatin at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day lasted 3 days just before induction of intestinal ischemia. At the end of reperfusion period, terminal ileum samples were removed to determine the concentrations of malondialdehyde, reduced glutathione, and myeloperoxidase. Samples were collected also to assess histopathological alterations and contractile response to agonists. Ischemia/reperfusion significantly decreased contractile responses, and this decrease was attenuated by atorvastatin. Pretreatment with atorvastatin caused remarkable decrease in both oxidative stress and neutrophil accumulation. Atorvastatin appeared to be restoring amount of reduced glutathione back to about control level. Furthermore, the pretreatment lowered mucosal damage at histopathological level. Our results suggested that pretreatment with atorvastatin attenuated intestinal muscle dysfunction associated with ischemia/reperfusion. This remarkable effect of atorvastatin is accomplished at least by decreasing oxidative stress and neutrophil accumulation as well as preventing the depletion of reduced glutathione.",

One group of rats was treated daily for 5 days a week for 2 months with 0.8 mg/kg atorvastatin by gavage. At the end of the treatment the livers were perfused with 72 mM ethanol for 60 min. Control groups (at least 4 animals in each group) consisted of a group of 2-month-old male Wistar EPM-1 rats exposed to 10% ethanol (v/v) ad libitum replacing water for 2 months, followed by perfusion of the liver with 61 nM atorvastatin for 60 min, and a group of animals without chronic ethanol treatment whose livers were perfused with atorvastatin and/or ethanol. The combination of atorvastatin with ethanol did not increase the release of injury marker enzymes (alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and lactic dehydrogenase) from the liver and no change in liver function markers (bromosulfophthalein clearance, and oxygen consumption) was observed.

Moreover, diabetes is associated with increased PAD severity. This Review summarizes atherothrombosis and PAD in patients with diabetes, and American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines for management of patients with PAD. Patients with PAD and diabetes require optimal limb care and aggressive cardiovascular risk reduction. An LDL cholesterol level of less than 1.8 mmol/l (<70 mg/dl) is the therapeutic goal in these patients, and this target should be pursued using an aggressive statin regimen. Fibrate therapy can also be indicated. beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors reduce cardiovascular events in high-risk patient populations, and these agents are recommended for use in patients with both diabetes and PAD. Blood pressure of less than 130/80 mmHg should be achieved, and glycated hemoglobin should be reduced to below 7%. Patients should also receive indefinite antiplatelet therapy with aspirin or clopidogrel. For patients with claudication, a supervised exercise program and cilostazol therapy to improve PAD symptoms and walking distance form the main noninvasive components of therapy.

One drug was used only in 12.1% of cases; 7.2% of patients did not use any cardiac drugs. Beta-adrenoblocker with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor was the most common (40.3%) used drug combination in patients on two drug complex. The combination of beta-adrenoblocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, and antithrombotics was more frequently used in patients on three drug complex. The combination of two or three cardiac drugs with statin was used in several cases (1.6-10.3%).", 
    "122": "These findings underscore that the use of beta-adrenoblockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and antithrombotics was high (about 75%) in patients during the first year after myocardial infarction, and the combination of these three drugs was used more commonly. The discordance between existing guidelines for statin use after myocardial infarction and current practice was determined in patients following myocardial infarction.", 
    "123": "Reducing sugars can react non-enzymatically with the amino groups of proteins to form reversible Schiff bases, and then Amadori products. These early glycation products undergo further complex reactions such as rearrangement, dehydration and condensation to become irreversibly cross-linked, heterogeneous fluorescent derivatives termed \"advanced glycation end products\" (AGEs). The pathological role of the non-enzymatic glycation of proteins has become increasingly evident in various types of disorders such as diabetic vascular complications, neurodegenerative diseases, and melanoma growth and metastasis. Furthermore, there is a growing body of evidence that RAGE is a signal-transducing receptor for AGEs and that engagement of RAGE with AGEs evokes oxidative stress and vascular inflammation, thereby being involved in the AGE-related disorders. We have recently found that atorvastatin, a lipid-lowering agent decreases serum levels of AGEs in type 2 diabetic patients in a cholesterol-lowering independent manner. Further, we have shown that atorvastain blocks the AGE-signaling to C-reactive protein (CRP) expression in human hepatoma cells in vitro via anti-oxidative properties. These observations led us to speculate that atorvastatin could be a promising remedy for treating patients with AGE-related disorders. In this paper, we would like to propose the possible ways of testing our hypotheses. (1) Does atorvastatin treatment reduce the development and progression of diabetic vascular complications with normocholesterolemic patients? If the answer is yes, is this beneficial effect of atorvastatin superior to that of other cholesterol-lowering agents with equihypolipidemic properties? (2) Are these beneficial effects of atorvastain attributed to its AGE-lowing properties? Does the blockade by atorvastain of the AGE signaling pathway, in other words, the suppression of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine and CRP levels by atorvastatin treatment, contribute to its cardioprotective properties? (3) Does the treatment with atorvastatin decrease the incidence of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and/or prolong the survival of these patients? (4) How about the effects of atorvastatin on the incidence of malignant melanoma? These prospective studies will provide further valuable information whether the blockade by atorvastatin of the AGE formation or the AGE-downstream signaling could be clinically relevant.", 
    "124": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of atorvastatin, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics of diltiazem and its active metabolite, desacetyldiltiazem, in rats. Pharmacokinetic parameters of diltiazem and desacetyldiltiazem were determined in rats after oral administration of diltiazem (15 mg x kg(-1)) to rats pretreated with atorvastatin (0.5 or 2.0 mg x kg(-1)). Compared with the control (given diltiazem alone), the pretreatment of atorvastatin significantly altered the pharmacokinetic parameters of diltiazem. The peak concentration (Cmax) and the areas under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of diltiazem were significantly (p < 0.05, 0.5 mg x kg(-1); p < 0.01, 2.0 mg x kg(-1)) increased in the presence of atorvastatin. The AUC of diltiazem was increased by 1.40-fold in rats pretreated with 0.5 mg x kg(-1) atorvastatin, and 1.77-fold in rats pretreated with 2.0 mg x kg(-1) atorvastatin. Consequently, absolute bioavailability values of diltiazem pretreated with atorvastatin (8.4-10.6%)were significantly higher (p < 0.05) than that in the control group (6.6%). Although the pretreatment of atorvastatin significantly (p < 0.05) increased the AUC of desacetyldiltiazem, metabolite-parent AUC ratio (M.R.) in the presence of atorvastatin (0.5 or 2.0 mg x kg(-1)) was significantly decreased compared to the control group, implying that atorvastatin could be effective to inhibit the metabolism of diltiazem. In conclusion, the concomitant use of atorvastatin significantly enhanced the oral exposure of diltiazem in rats.",

Group I was injected with MSCs (1 x 10(6)) intravenously 24 hrs after traumatic brain injury. Group II was administered atorvastatin (0.5 mg/kg) orally for 14 days starting 24 hours after traumatic brain injury. Group III received MSCs (1 x 10(6)) combined with atorvastatin (0.5 mg/kg). Group IV (control) was injected with saline. MSCs were harvested from the bone marrow of male rats to identify male donor cells within female recipient animals by localization of Y chromosomes. Functional analysis was performed using modified neurological severity scores and the Morris water maze test. Animals were sacrificed 35 days after injury and brain sections stained with immunohistochemistry.", 
    "127": "No functional improvement was seen in animals treated with MSCs or atorvastatin alone (Groups I and II). However, functional improvement was seen with both testing modalities (modified neurological severity scores and Morris water maze) in animals receiving combination therapy (Group III). Microscopic analysis showed that significantly more MSCs were present in animals receiving combination therapy than in those receiving MSCs alone. Also, significantly more endogenous cellular proliferation was seen in the hippocampus and injury boundary zone of the combination therapy group than in the monotherapy or control groups.",

    "129": "Inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase occasionally cause myopathy characterized by weakness, pain, and elevated serum creatine phosphokinase (CK). In this study, we investigated the effects of simvastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, on the viability and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) signaling in differentiating C2C12 mouse myoblast cells. Simvastatin decreased cell viability and CK activity, a marker of myogenesis, in differentiating cells in a dose-dependent manner. Although the simvastatin-induced decrease in viability in proliferating and differentiated cells was completely abolished by mevalonate or geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate, the inhibitory effects of simvastatin in differentiating cells were not abolished by mevalonate or isoprenoid derivatives of mevalonate. Moreover, the sensitivity of differentiating cells to simvastatin regarding cell viability was about 7 times higher than that of proliferating cells. After induction of differentiation in the presence of 1 microM simvastatin for 2 days, IGF-1-induced activation of ERK1/2 and Akt was significantly decreased. Although mRNA expression of the IGF-1 receptor beta-chain (IGF-1R beta) did not change, protein level of the 200 kDa IGF-1Rbeta precursor was significantly increased by simvastatin in a dose-dependent manner. Mevalonate did not abolish the effect of simvastatin on IGF-1Rbeta expression. These results suggest that simvastatin decreases IGF-1 signaling via a regulation of the post-translational modification of IGF-1Rbeta in an HMG-CoA reductase inhibition-independent manner.", 
    "130": "It has been noted that chemical-induced initial insult is sometimes no longer detected in examinations after additional consecutive treatments, suggesting that the target organs acquire resistance to the chemical toxicity. In this study, whether acquired resistance to the skeletal muscle toxicity is observed during repeated treatment of a toxic dose of Compound A that has a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitory activity was examined. F344 male rats (7-weeks old) were given a mixed diet with 0.12% Compound A (corresponding to approximately 100 mg/kg/day) for up to 56 days. Blood samples were obtained from the tail vein periodically during the dosing period, and utilized for the measurement of creatine kinase (CK) as a marker of skeletal muscle injury. In the necropsies on Days 4, 8, 11, 28, 42 and 56, the skeletal muscles from the rectus femoris were removed for histopathology or gene expression analysis. A satellite group was provided to measure the plasma concentrations of Compound A and M1, the active metabolite of Compound A. CK levels increased from Day 9 and reached approximately 30 times those of the controls on Day 12. Histopathology of the skeletal muscle on Day 11 revealed severe necrosis of the muscle fibers. However, in spite of continuous treatments to the damaged rats, the CK levels decreased after that and returned to normal levels on Day 18. No skeletal muscle injury was observed on Days 42 and 56. There were no marked differences in the exposure levels of Compound A and M1 between Days 8 (prior to CK elevation) and 28 (post CK elevation). As for the most significant changes in the gene expression analysis for the skeletal muscle on Days 42 and 56, the probe for IkappaBa, which is known as an inhibitor for nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), increased 2-fold compared to the control. Furthermore, an increased probe for CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) delta, a transcriptional factor, and a decreased probe for cAMP-response element-binding protein (CBP)/p300, a transcriptional coactivator, were also noted significantly on Day 56. These changes in the gene expression analysis suggested suppressed NF-kappaB-mediated transactivation, which was responsible for the protective effects on the muscle injury. Based on the present findings, the resistance to skeletal muscle injury observed in this study may be attributable to the suppressed NF-kappaB-mediated transactivation, but not to the decreased exposure to toxicants.", 
    "131": "HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR) catalyzes the rate-controlling step in cholesterol production. This enzyme is highly expressed in the liver, where it is subject to extensive hormonal and dietary regulation. Although much is known about the regulation of the HMGR promoter in cultured cells, this issue has not been directly addressed in liver. The technique of in vivo electroporation was utilized to perform the first functional analysis of the HMGR promoter in live animals. Analysis of a series of deletion constructs showed that deletion of the region containing the cyclic AMP response element (CRE) at -104 to -96 and an NF-Y site at -70 to -65 resulted in marked reduction of promoter activity. Sterol regulation of this promoter was investigated by raising tissue cholesterol levels by feeding cholesterol and by decreasing them through administration of a statin (lovastatin). Using this approach, we found that HMGR promoter constructs were sterol responsive in live animals, adding in vivo relevance to previous findings in cultured cells. We also conclude that in vivo electroporation is a convenient and powerful technique for the analysis of promoter elements in the livers of live animals.",

We grouped fibrates, niacins, and n-3 fatty acid preparations as nonstatin HDL cholesterol-raising medicines, and we used published studies to estimate the potential benefit of raising HDL cholesterol levels in this population.", 
    "134": "Nearly half (49.5%) of patients had low HDL cholesterol (<40 mg/dl for men, <50 mg/dl for women). Low HDL cholesterol was independently associated with prevalent cardiovascular disease (CVD), younger age, and higher A1C levels. Nearly two-thirds of patients (63.0%) were prescribed a statin (67.6% of patients below the HDL cholesterol goal, 80.5% of patients with CVD). In contrast, only 7.9% of patients were prescribed a nonstatin HDL cholesterol-raising medication, including 16.4% of patients below the HDL cholesterol goal with CVD. Based on published studies, normalizing low HDL cholesterol in this primary care cohort would correspond to an estimated CVD mortality reduction of 42% in women and 23% in men.", 
    "135": "Nearly half of the patients in this large primary care cohort had low HDL cholesterol levels. In contrast to frequent statin use, few patients were prescribed currently available medicines to raise HDL cholesterol.

    "136": "The two marine omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), prevalent in fish and fish oils, have been investigated as a strategy towards prophylaxis of atherosclerosis. While the results with fish and fish oils have been not as clear cut, the data generated with the purified ethyl ester forms of these two fatty acids are consistent. Although slight differences in biological activity exist between EPA and DHA, both exert a number of positive actions against atherosclerosis and its complications. EPA and DHA as ethyl esters inhibit platelet aggregability, and reduce serum triglycerides, while leaving other serum lipids essentially unaltered. Glucose metabolism has been studied extensively, and no adverse effects were seen. Pro-atherogenic cytokines are reduced, as are markers of endothelial activation. Endothelial function is improved, vascular occlusion is reduced, and the course of coronary atherosclerosis is mitigated. Heart rate is reduced, and heart rate variability is increased by EPA and DHA. An antiarrhythmic effect can be demonstrated on the supraventricular and the ventricular level. More importantly, two large studies showed reductions in clinical endpoints like sudden cardiac death or major adverse cardiac events. As a consequence, relevant cardiac societies recommend using 1 g/day of EPA and DHA for cardiovascular prevention, after a myocardial infarction and for prevention of sudden cardiac death.", 
    "137": "Clinicians involved in the care of patients with cardiovascular conditions have recently been confronted with an important body of literature linking inflammation and cardiovascular disease. Indeed, the level of systemic inflammation as measured by circulating levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) has been linked to prognosis in patients with atherosclerotic disease, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, myocarditis, aortic valve disease and heart transplantation. In addition, a number of basic science reports suggest an active role for CRP in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular diseases. This article explores the potential role of CRP in disease initiation, progression, and clinical manifestations and reviews its role in the prediction of future events in clinical practice. Therapeutic interventions to decrease circulating levels of CRP are also reviewed.", 
    "138": "The National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III found evidence for raising high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) to reduce coronary artery disease (CAD) events supports use of HDL-C to help modify low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)-lowering goals, but not to establish new HDL-C-focused treatment recommendations. However, the HDL-C-raising clinical trials provide important lessons to help guide clinical management of dyslipidemic patients. The fibrate outcome trials demonstrate that these drugs reduce CAD events, but not death. Their greatest benefit is in patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia characterized by high triglycerides, small LDL particles, and low HDL-C. Unfortunately, there is no information on whether these drugs extend risk reduction when added to a statin. The niacin outcome trials also demonstrate a reduction in CAD events, both with niacin monotherapy and in combination with a statin. Unfortunately, most of the trials are too small to address the impact of niacin on mortality. In the clinic, statins are most useful for their LDL-C-lowering efficacy, although their modest HDL-C-raising effects can be important in CAD risk reduction. In most cases, other therapies will need to be added to a statin to augment HDL-C-raising, and the most effective drug for achieving this is niacin. The greatest challenge with the use of niacin is managing the vasodilatory side effects, but this can be effectively done in the majority of patients. Fibrates can also be added to a statin for management of atherogenic dyslipidemia. These drugs are among the most effective triglyceride-lowering drugs, and they also increase HDL-C levels, but not as much as niacin. The biggest concern with combining a fibrate with a statin is the enhanced risk of severe muscle toxicity, but this appears to be a problem unique to gemfibrozil, and not fenofibrate. In the research center, new approaches are under development for enhancing the availability of apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) and nascent HDL particles to promote enhanced reverse cholesterol transport, increasing the production of transport molecules, in particular, ATP-binding cassette A-I, to facilitate delivery of cholesterol within the macrophage cell to the cell surface, where it can be taken up by nascent HDL particles for transport to the liver, and inhibiting the cholesteryl ester transport protein to promote retention of cholesteryl esters within the HDL core for delivery back to the liver. In addition, new insights into the role of prostaglandin D(2) in the niacin flush and discovery of the niacin receptor has led to a search for a more efficacious and \"flushless\" niacin.", 
    "139": "The objective of the present work was to formulate a self-emulsifying drug delivery system (SEDDS) for simvastatin, which is widely used in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and dyslipidemia as an adjunct to diet. Simvastatin SEDDS were formulated using a 1:1 (V/V) mixture of diesters of caprylic/capric acids and polyglycolyzed glycerides with varying concentrations of polyoxy castor oil and C8/C10 mono-/diglycerides. The developed SEDDS were evaluated for turbidimetry, droplet size analysis, drug content and in vitro diffusion profiles. In vivo performance of the optimized formulation was evaluated in rats using pharmacodynamic marker parameters like plasma total cholesterol (CH), triglycerides (TG) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL-CH) for 21 days. SEDDS containing 9.1% (m/m) simvastatin and 23.0% (m/m) of each excipient showed minimum mean droplet size (124 nm) and optimal drug diffusion. This test formulation showed significant reduction in plasma CH and TG (around 5-fold and 4-fold, respectively), while HDL-CH concentration was markedly higher (2-fold) compared a reference simvastatin suspension formulation after oral administration for 21 days of study. Test formulation has shown enhanced pharmacodynamic performance compared to reference formulation in rats. The study illustrated the potential of simvastatin SEDDS for oral administration and its biopharmaceutic performance.", 
    "140": "The clinical relevance of coronary artery disease has considerably driven the recent development of radiologic tools for noninvasive cardiac imaging. Modern multidetector row computed tomographic (MDCT) systems combine high temporal and spatial resolution, electrocardiographic synchronization, and ease of use. In cardiac imaging, MDCT has not only replaced electron-beam CT, but also challenges competing methods such as magnetic resonance imaging, echocardiography, or even coronary catheterization. Noncontrast material-enhanced assessment of atherosclerotic plaques (CT calcium scoring) seems useful for the cardiac risk stratification in asymptomatic patients and monitoring of medical (statin) therapy. Contrast material-enhanced CT coronary angiography has become established as a valuable method for several clinical indications such as evaluation of coronary artery anomalies, bypass patency, or preoperative planning. Particularly, the high negative predictive value of a normal CT coronary angiogram allows reliable exclusion of coronary artery stenosis. Plaque characterization is another promising area of research in MDCT cardiac imaging. However, with current technology a reliable distinction between atheroma and fibroatheroma is impaired by restrictions in spatial resolution. Recent studies indicate that CT angiography may also be suited for other clinical applications such as triage of patients with acute coronary syndrome and inconclusive clinical presentation, patients with symptomatic chest pain, and intermediate risk profile or cardiac risk stratification in asymptomatic patients.",

This mechanical environment, also termed oscillatory shear stress (OSS), induces the expression of several pro-atherogenic genes in the endothelial cells including the preproendothelin-1 (ppET-1) gene. The present paper investigates the molecular mechanisms of this induction.", 
    "146": "Several deletional mutants of ppET-1 gene promoter were cloned upstream of a luciferase gene and transiently transfected in bovine arterial endothelial cells that were further exposed to plaque-prone hemodynamics. After 24h of flow exposure, analysis of the transfected cells showed that a proximal promoter of 156 base pairs length retained OSS responsiveness. Mutation of an activator protein-1 (AP-1) binding site present in this minimal promoter completely abolished its activation by OSS. Consistently, electrophoresis mobility shift assay revealed a sustained activation of AP-1 transcription factor in endothelial cells exposed to OSS. In addition to the transcriptional activation, we demonstrated that OSS also induces a stabilization of ppET-1mRNA through the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) of this gene. Fluvastatin, a drug known to improve endothelial function, was shown to prevent OSS up-regulation of the ppET-1 gene expression. Under this flow condition, fluvastatin affects ppET-1 gene expression via inhibition of its promoter activity without affecting ppET-1mRNA stability.",

Many patients with type 2 diabetes have dyslipidemia, which requires treatment with three hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins), hence, concurrent use of exenatide and statins is likely. Exenatide slows gastric emptying, which may alter the absorption rate of co-administered oral medications. Thus, the potential interaction between exenatide and statins was evaluated in two study settings.",

In the exenatide Phase 3 trials, 30-week changes from baseline for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), total cholesterol, triglycerides and statin dosage were not significantly different between the exenatide and placebo groups treated with statins.",

The recently published studies are reviewed in this summary. The distinction is made between patients requiring either primary or secondary cardiovascular preventive management. The review identifies the increasing numbers of patients who may benefit from the use of statins as primary preventive management, and the changing concepts of the utilization of statin drugs for secondary preventive management, including the more aggressive titration of the drugs to provide incremental improvement in patient outcomes.

    "155": "We describe a directed evolution approach that should find broad application in generating enzymes that meet predefined process-design criteria. It augments recombination-based directed evolution by incorporating a strategy for statistical analysis of protein sequence activity relationships (ProSAR). This combination facilitates mutation-oriented enzyme optimization by permitting the capture of additional information contained in the sequence-activity data. The method thus enables identification of beneficial mutations even in variants with reduced function. We use this hybrid approach to evolve a bacterial halohydrin dehalogenase that improves the volumetric productivity of a cyanation process approximately 4,000-fold. This improvement was required to meet the practical design criteria for a commercially relevant biocatalytic process involved in the synthesis of a cholesterol-lowering drug, atorvastatin (Lipitor), and was obtained by variants that had at least 35 mutations.", 
    "156": "Hydroxymethyl glutaryl (HMG)-coenzyme A (CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) protect the myocardium against ischemia-reperfusion injury via a mechanism unrelated to cholesterol lowering. Statins may inhibit isoprenylation and thereby prevent activation of proteins such as RhoA. We hypothesized that statins protect the myocardium against ischemia-reperfusion injury via a mechanism involving inhibition of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthesis and translocation of RhoA to the plasma membrane. Sprague-Dawley rats were given either the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor rosuvastatin, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate dissolved in methanol, the combination of rosuvastatin and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, rosuvastatin and methanol, or distilled water (control) by intraperitoneal injection for 48 h before ischemia-reperfusion. Animals were anesthetized and either subjected to 30 min of coronary artery occlusion followed by 2 h of reperfusion where at infarct size was determined, or the expression of RhoA protein was determined in cytosolic and membrane fractions of nonischemic myocardium. There were no significant differences in hemodynamics between the control group and the other groups before ischemia or during ischemia and reperfusion. The infarct size was 80 +/- 3% of the area at risk in the control group. Rosuvastatin reduced infarct size to 64 +/- 2% (P<0.001 vs. control). Addition of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (77 +/- 2%, P<0.01 vs. rosuvastatin) but not methanol (65 +/- 2%, not significant vs. rosuvastatin) abolished the cardioprotective effect of rosuvastatin. Geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate alone did not affect infarct size per se (84 +/- 2%). Rosuvastatin increased the cytosol-to-membrane ratio of RhoA protein in the myocardium (P<0.05 vs. control). These changes were abolished by addition of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. We conclude that the cardioprotection and the increase of the RhoA cytosol-to-membrane ratio induced by rosuvastatin in vivo are blocked by geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. The inhibition of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate formation and subsequent modulation of cytosol/membrane-bound RhoA are of importance for the protective effect of statins against myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury.", 
    "157": "We have observed that in three human malignant mesothelioma cell lines, crocidolite asbestos induced the activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB and the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO) by inhibiting the RhoA signaling pathway. The incubation with crocidolite decreased the level of GTP-bound RhoA and the activity of Rho-dependent kinase, and induced the activation of Akt/PKB and IkBalpha kinase, leading to the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB. The effects of crocidolite fibers on NF-kappaB activation and NO synthesis were mimicked by Y27632 (an inhibitor of the Rho-dependent kinases) and toxin B (an inhibitor of RhoA GTPase activity), while they were reverted by mevalonic acid, the product of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMGCoA) reductase. Furthermore, crocidolite, similarly to mevastatin, inhibited the synthesis of cholesterol and ubiquinone and the prenylation of RhoA: these effects were prevented in the presence of mevalonic acid. This suggests that crocidolite fibers might inhibit the synthesis of isoprenoid molecules at the level of the HMGCoA reductase reaction or of an upstream step, thus impairing the prenylation and subsequent activation of RhoA. Akt can stimulate NO synthesis via a double mechanism: it can activate the inducible NO synthase via the NF-kappaB pathway and the endothelial NO synthase via a direct phosphorylation. Our results suggest that crocidolite increases the NO levels in mesothelioma cells by modulating both NO synthase isoforms.",

Recently, it has been proposed that statins mobilize endothelial progenitor cells from bone marrow during the first four weeks, which could help to prevent vascular diseases. However, in humans there are few data concerning the long term effects of statin treatment on these endothelial progenitor cells. We investigated whether endothelial progenitor cells can be detected and characterized in patients receiving long term statin therapy. Mononuclear cells from patients receiving or not receiving statin therapy were assessed for progenitor cell content by flow cytometry and were cultured in specific conditions to determine the number and the type of progenitors. Our results showed there were significantly more CD34(+), CD34(+)/CD144(+) circulating progenitor cells in the statin(pos) group than in the statin(neg) group. In culture two types of endothelial progenitor cells were detected. Early endothelial progenitor cells gave colonies at day 5 comprising elongated cells whereas late endothelial progenitor cells generated cobblestone-like colonies with strong proliferation capacities. The number of circulating early endothelial progenitor cells was significantly higher in the statin(neg) group, while only late endothelial progenitor cells were detected in the statin(pos) group. Moreover, cells from cobblestones clearly had an endothelial phenotype CD31(+), VEGF-R2(+), CD34(+), CD146(+) in contrast to cells from colonies from early endothelial progenitor cells, which were VEGF-R2(low), CD34(-). These results strongly suggest that long term statin treatment specifically maintains late endothelial progenitor cells in circulation with a CD34(+)/CD144(+) phenotype.", 
    "159": "Statins have been described as miracle drugs, but such \"beatification\" is not justified. Changes in lifestyle should be considered the cornerstone in cardiovascular prevention. However, trends in mortality from coronary heart disease have not effectively changed since statins were approved in the United States, while obesity has risen significantly. Have these drugs contributed to a deterioration in lifestyle among those who believe a pill will protect them? Adherence to healthful lifestyle has been shown to be associated with reductions in the rates of coronary disease, diabetes in women, and mortality in elderly. Patients with major lifestyle problems enrolled in recent statin trials were given only drugs, and no statin has ever been compared with a nonatherogenic lifestyle and shown to be superior or additive. Furthermore, there is no evidence for a total mortality benefit in women and elderly persons from dyslipidemia therapy. Side effects are often presented as relative, not absolute risk, and are suggested to be low. However, there is reason to believe that their numbers are much larger in clinical practice where the drugs may be given to most patients usually excluded in randomised trials. Statin-related side effects may be considered as a complication to the primary disease. However, these complaints may be statin therapy related. Finally, the relationship between long-standing statin therapy and cancerogenesis is not fully understood. Investigators should carefully resist the natural tendency to highlight the most positive findings in their studies while minimising harm, especially when commercially sponsored.",

A progressive decrease in systolic blood pressure and reduction of low-density lipoprotein oxidation (Ox-LDL) has also been reported. However, none of these studies were done in patient with coronary artery disease treated with statins. This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel trial. Forty-four patients (11 women and 33 men, mean age 66 years) who survived myocardial infraction and have received statin therapy for at least 6 months (80% dose of 40 mg/day simvastatin) were included in the study. The subjects were randomised to receive either 3 x 85 mg/day of chokeberry flavonoid extract (Aronia melanocarpa E) or placebo for a period of 6 weeks. The study extract was a commercially-available (OTC) product of the following declared composition: anthocyans (about 25%), polymeric procyanidines (about 50%) and phenolic acids (about 9%). Compared to placebo (ANOVA and Tukey's test), flavonoids significantly reduced serum 8-isoprostans (p<0.000) and Ox-LDL levels (p<0.000) (by 38 and 29%, respectively), as well as hsCRP (p<0.007) and MCP-1 (p<0.001) levels (by 23 and 29%, respectively).

We performed a controlled multicentric trial in India to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a fixed dose combination of lovastatin and niacin extended release (niacin(ER)) formulation in patients with moderate to severe dyslipidemia. Consecutive subjects that satisfied the selection criteria, agreed to an informed consent, and with no baseline presence of liver/renal disease or heart failure were enrolled in the study. After a 4-week run-in period there were 142 patients with LDL levels > or = 130 mg/dL. Eleven patients were excluded because of uncontrolled hyperglycemia and 131 patients were recruited. After baseline evaluation of clinical and biochemical parameters all subjects were administered lovastatin (20 mg) and niacin(ER) (500 mg) combination once daily. Dose escalation was done on basis of lipid parameters at 8 weeks and in 11 patients increased to lovastatin (20 mg) and niacin(ER) (1000 mg). An intention-to-treat analysis was performed and data was analyzed using nonparametric Wilcoxon signed rank test. Thirteen patients (10%) were lost to follow-up and 4 (3%) withdrew because of dermatological adverse effects: flushing, pruritus, and rash.

    "166": "Cardiovascular (CV) disease remains the number 1 cause of death in the USA. Nonetheless, there has been a decline in the age-adjusted death rate for coronary heart disease (CHD) which may be due to more aggressive treatment guidelines for treating CV risk factors, such as hypertension, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. The recent update to the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) guidelines have recommended lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals in high-risk patients. Based on the new targets for LDL-C, clinicians will need more efficacious lipid-lowering therapies. One of these newer therapies is the combination of ezetimibe and simvastatin. This article reviews the implications of the updated guidelines and discusses the efficacy and safety of ezetimibe/simvastatin for lowering LDL-C.",

Although significant resources have been invested in new treatments, almost all have failed to improve outcomes. An improved understanding of sepsis pathophysiology, including the complex interactions between inflammatory, coagulation, and fibrinolytic systems, has accelerated the development of novel treatments. Recombinant human activated protein C (rhAPC), or drotrecogin alfa (activated) (DAA), is currently the only US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medicine for the treatment of severe sepsis, and only in patients with a high risk of death. This review will discuss the treatment of severe sepsis, focusing on recent discoveries and unresolved questions about DAA's optimal use. Increasing pharmacological experience has generated enthusiasm for investigating medicines already approved for other indications as treatments for severe sepsis. Replacement doses of hydrocortisone and vasopressin may reduce mortality and improve hypotension, respectively, in a subgroup of patients with catecholamine-refractory septic shock. In addition to discussing these new indications, this review will detail the provocative preliminary data from four promising treatments, including two novel modalities: antagonizing high mobility group box protein and inhibiting tissue factor (TF).

The mechanism of action of plant sterols is different from those of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A inhibitors (statins) and thus their effect is additive. Combining plant sterols with other dietary components known to reduce cholesterol in a portfolio approach has proven to be most effective for reduction of hypercholesterolemia and provide an alternative treatment option for clinicians. Plant sterol-enriched foods provides clinicians with a relatively cheap, safe, and effective way to help patients manage their cardiovascular risk.",

Participants were assessed after 6 weeks and 9 months of statin therapy.

The aim of this study was to evaluate 1-month simvastatin treatment effect on endothelial function in hypercholesterolemic children and adolescents. Eighteen hypercholesterolemic patients (HC group) and 18 healthy controls, aged 6-18 years, were studied with medical history, physical examination, full lipid profile, serum apolipoprotein B (apo B), fibrinogen, hepatic transaminases, and creatine kinase concentrations. Flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) was performed by high-resolution ultrasound of the brachial artery. The HC group received simvastatin 10 mg/day for 1 month. Arterial diameter was measured by two experienced sonographers who were unaware of subjects' conditions. At baseline, FMD was impaired in the HC group (mean, 5.27 +/- 4.67%) compared to controls (mean, 15.05 +/- 5.97%) (p < 0.001). After treatment, we observed a significant reduction in total cholesterol (TC) (29%), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C); (37%), apo B concentrations (36%) and FMD restoration (mean, 12.94 +/- 7.66%), with an absolute increase of 7.66 +/- 8.58 (p = 0.001). These results show that children and adolescents with hypercholesterolemia present endothelial dysfunction, and simvastatin, in addition to significantly reducing TC, LDL-C, and apo B concentrations, restores endothelial function with 1-month treatment.", 
    "179": "Angiotensin-II (Ang-II)-stimulated increases in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate reduced (NADPH) oxidase activity and oxidative stress are known to play a key role in cardiac remodeling. Inhibition of isoprenylation and activation of small G proteins, such as Rac1, a component of NADPH oxidase, may mediate the antioxidant actions of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins). In this study, we investigated the effects of rosuvastatin on cardiac oxidative stress and remodeling in transgenic rats (Ren2) overexpressing the mouse renin gene with elevated cardiac levels of Ang-II. We treated 6- to 7-wk-old Ren2 rats and age-matched Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats with rosuvastatin (10 mg/kg.d) or vehicle for 3 wk. At the end of the treatment period, left ventricular mass, wall thickness, ejection fraction (by echocardiography), and cardiac remodeling (by light microscopy and immunohistochemistry) were assessed. In addition, myocardial content of nitrotyrosine, malondialdehyde, NADPH-oxidase subunits (gp91(phox), p40(phox), and p22(phox)), and Rac1 were analyzed by immunochemistry. Systolic blood pressure was significantly higher in Ren2 rats, compared with SD rats (P < 0.05); rosuvastatin had no significant effect on systolic blood pressure in either group. In Ren2, but not SD rats, rosuvastatin significantly improved the ventricular ejection fraction, cardiac hypertrophy, and perivascular fibrosis (P < 0.05). In addition, rosuvastatin administration significantly decreased the accentuated myocardial gp91(phox), p40(phox), p22(phox), and Rac1 expression. These changes were accompanied by a parallel reduction in myocardial lipid peroxidation (nitrotyrosine and malondialdehyde content) (P < 0.05). These results suggest that in vivo statin treatment through its direct actions on the heart reduces oxidative stress and remodeling including ventricular mass regression in the Ang-II-dependent Ren2 model.", 
    "180": "Macrophage cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) plays an important role in prostaglandin E2 and thromboxane A2 production. Statins are inhibitors of HMG CoA (3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductases and cholesterol synthesis, which block the expression of several inflammatory proteins independent of their capacity to lower endogenous cholesterol. In the present study, we investigated the effect of simvastatin and mevastatin on COX-2 induction in human monocytic cell line U937 and analyzed the underlying mechanisms. Pretreatment of U937 cells with simvastatin or mevastatin for 24 h resulted in a significant reduction in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-dependent induction of prostaglandin E2, thromboxane A2 synthesis, and COX-2 expression. Mevalonate, the direct metabolite of HMG CoA reductase, and farnesyl pyrophosphate and geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate, intermediates of the mevalonate pathway, significantly reversed the inhibitory effect of statins on COX-2. An inhibitor of geranylgeranyl transferases, GGTI-286 mimicked the effect of statins on COX-2 expression. Cytonecrotic factor-1 increased LPS-dependent expression of COX-2. Treatment of cells with NSC 23766, an inhibitor of Rac, which we demonstrated to block Rac 2 activation, resulted in an inhibition of the LPS-dependent expression of COX-2. Whereas no effect was obtained with RhoA/C blocker, C3 exoenzyme. Gel retardation experiments and NFkappaB-p65 transcription factor assay showed that simvastatin and NSC 23766 decrease significantly NF-kappaB complex formation. In macrophages, the antiinflammatory effects of statins are mediated in part through the inhibition of COX-2 and prostanoids. Rac GTPase protein is identified as one of the targets of statins in this regulation.", 
    "181": "The MS is associated with increased morbidity and mortality for cardiovascular disease (CVD). MS is represented not only by metabolic alteration such as hyperglycemia, and hyperlipemia but also by a chronic pro-inflammatory state. Another responsible in the formation and progression of CVD is the so-called endothelial dysfunction, which is linked to insulin resistance itself. The common denominator of the MS is insulin resistance. The most convincing evidence for the existence of MS comes from the cluster analysis which outlines four main factors: the \"metabolic factor\", the \"pressure factor\", the \"lipid factor\" and the \"obesity factor\". It is clear that the presence of the MS appears to identify a substantial additional cardiovascular risk on top of the individual risk factors. The studies available in the literature have pointed out the beneficial effects, in terms of cardiovascular mortality, of the treatment with inhibitors of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (statins): this reduction of risk has been observed despite the fact that high triglyceride and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels, but not hypercholesterolemia, are the main features of the dyslipidemia observed in patients with MS. Yet, despite a normal low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol level, patients with MS are at high risk for future CVD. For this reason, their treatment with statins is mandatory.", 
    "182": "Inflammatory cytokines have a central role in atherogenesis and plaque rupture. These mediators, including tumor necrosis factor, interleukins, and matrix metalloproteinases and transforming growth factor-beta are also prominent in other chronic progressive diseases characterized by cell apoptosis and tissue fibrosis. This review extends the inflammation hypothesis to critical analysis of studies to bearing on the role of inflammation in chronic conditions that commonly accompany coronary disease. Because statins inhibit the expression of inflammatory mediators, the review then analyzes the laboratory and clinical data that may justify trials of statins in nonatherosclerotic disease. In conclusion, despite far different clinical presentations, chronic progressive diseases characterized by apoptosis and fibrosis have persistence of inflammatory cytokines as a final common pathway, and thus may benefit from the pleiotropic effects of statin therapy.", 
    "183": "Given the limitations of current risk assessment strategies, adjunctive markers are needed to improve the prediction of a first coronary event. Research into the inflammatory nature of atherosclerosis suggests that inflammatory-response proteins may serve as potential predictors of clinical events. One in particular, C-reactive protein, has been the focus of much attention. Epidemiologic studies have shown a fairly consistent independent association between high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) elevations and coronary risk, although a causal relation has not yet been established. Given this association, current guidelines recommend the optional use of hs-CRP to predict enhanced absolute risk in selected patients. The use of a marker in general clinical practice should be based on statistical measures that show incremental benefit over established risk factors and on randomized clinical trials in which therapy initiated as a result of marker screening improves patient outcomes. Thus far, statistical evidence concerning the incremental benefit of hs-CRP is not conclusive. Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) is now being conducted to compare the efficacy of statin therapy versus placebo in subjects considered to be at increased risk on the basis of hs-CRP elevations, despite low to normal levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. In conclusion, although epidemiologic studies suggest that low-grade C-reactive protein elevations are independently associated with coronary risk, more complete evidence is needed to validate the use of hs-CRP as a risk assessment tool in general practice and as a target for therapy in individual patients.", 
    "184": "Atorvastatin and rosuvastatin are both highly effective in decreasing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels. However, rosuvastatin was shown to be more effective in increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. The purpose of the study is to compare the effects of daily doses of rosuvastatin 40 mg with atorvastatin 80 mg during a 6-week period on HDL subpopulations in 306 hyperlipidemic men and women. We previously showed that increased levels of large alpha-1 and alpha-2 HDLs decrease the risk of coronary heart disease and protect against progression of coronary atherosclerosis (superior to HDL cholesterol). In this study, both statins caused significant increases in large alpha-1 (p <0.001) and alpha-2 (p <0.001 for rosuvastatin, p <0.05 for atorvastatin) and significant (p <0.001) decreases in small pre-beta-1 HDL levels; however, increases in the 2 large HDL particles were significantly higher for rosuvastatin than atorvastatin (alpha-1, 24% vs 12%; alpha-2, 13% vs 4%; p <0.001). Statin-induced increases in alpha-1 and alpha-2 correlated with increases in HDL cholesterol, whereas decreases in pre-beta-1 were associated with decreases in triglycerides. In subjects with low HDL cholesterol (<40 mg/dl for men, <50 mg/dl for women, n = 99), increases in alpha-1 were 32% versus 11%, and in alpha-2, 21% versus 5% for rosuvastatin and atorvastatin, respectively. In conclusion, our data show that both statins, given at their maximal doses, favorably alter the HDL subpopulation profile, but also that rosuvastatin is significantly more effective in this regard than atorvastatin.", 
    "185": "Patients at risk of coronary heart disease may not achieve recommended low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol goals on statin monotherapy. This study was designed to investigate the efficacy and safety of rosuvastatin 40 mg alone or in combination with ezetimibe 10 mg in patients at high risk of coronary heart disease. Four hundred sixty-nine patients were randomly assigned to rosuvastatin alone or in combination with ezetimibe for 6 weeks. The primary end point was the percentage of patients achieving the Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) LDL cholesterol goal (<100 mg/dl) at week 6. Secondary end points included the percentage of patients achieving other ATP III and 2003 European lipid goals, changes from baseline in lipid, lipoprotein, and inflammatory parameters, and safety and tolerability. Significantly more patients receiving rosuvastatin/ezetimibe than rosuvastatin alone achieved their ATP III LDL cholesterol goal (<100 mg/dl, 94.0% vs 79.1%, p <0.001) and the optional LDL cholesterol goal (<70 mg/dl) for very high-risk patients (79.6% vs 35.0%, p <0.001). The combination of rosuvastatin/ezetimibe reduced LDL cholesterol significantly more than rosuvastatin (-69.8% vs -57.1%, p <0.001). Other components of the lipid/lipoprotein profile were also significantly (p <0.001) improved with rosuvastatin/ezetimibe. Both treatments generally were well tolerated. Rosuvastatin 40 mg was effective at improving the atherogenic lipid profile in this high-risk population. Combination rosuvastatin with ezetimibe 10 mg enabled greater decreases in LDL cholesterol and allowed more patients to achieve LDL cholesterol goals. In conclusion, rosuvastatin plus ezetimibe may improve the management of high-risk patients who cannot achieve goal on maximal statin monotherapy.", 
    "186": "After acute coronary syndromes (ACSs), older patients are particularly susceptible to early complications, including death and recurrent ACS. Lipid management guidelines do not differentiate elderly from younger patients, and lack of evidence for statin benefits in older patients has led to underutilization of statins in the elderly. The MIRACL study randomized 3,086 patients to 16 weeks of 80 mg/day of atorvastatin or placebo 24 to 96 hours after ACS and demonstrated significant decreases in the combined primary end point (nonfatal acute myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, recurrent symptomatic myocardial ischemia). This post hoc analysis compared benefits of 80 mg of atorvastatin in older (> or =65 years) versus younger (<65 years) patients. Event rates were approximately two- to threefold higher in older than in younger patients. Treatment-by-age heterogeneity testing indicated no difference in treatment effect by age for any of the primary or secondary end points, and relative risk decreases in the primary end point with atorvastatin versus placebo were similar in younger and older patients (22% vs 14%, respectively). The safety profile of atorvastatin was similar between the 2 age groups. In conclusion, these results and a greater immediate cardiovascular risk in older patients argue for early, intensive atorvastatin therapy as routine practice after ACS.",

The main objectives of this article are therefore to calculate costs-, effects and cost-effectiveness of fourteen medical interventions of primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in Tanzania, including Acetylsalicylic acid, a diuretic drug (Hydrochlorothiazide), a beta-blocker (Atenolol), a calcium channel blocker (Nifedepine), a statin (Lovastatin) and various combinations of these.",

    "191": "The prominent use of fibric acid derivatives has lessened over the years because of unimpressive results in major clinical trials, safety concerns, and the emergence of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins). Clofibrate was widely used in the 1970s, but after publication of results from two major trials demonstrating only modest reductions in the rate of coronary heart disease (CHD) and concerns regarding an increase in the frequency of gallstones and overall mortality, its use subsided dramatically. With the introduction of gemfibrozil in the 1980s came a renewed interest in the class, which was also supported by the published results of the Helsinki Heart Study; however, despite a significant reduction in CHD events and a sound safety profile, overall mortality was comparable to that with placebo. Again, in the 1990s, awareness of the fibrates was heightened with the availability of fenofibrate and the findings of another major trial using gemfibrozil, the Veterans Affairs High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Intervention Trial (VA-HIT), which demonstrated impressive results in reducing cardiovascular events. To further strengthen the VA-HIT results, numerous post hoc analyses were performed on the data of major trials of fibrate therapy among patients with mixed dyslipidemia, with similar findings. Recently, however, data from the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) study were published, indicating mixed results. Nearly 40 years after the introduction of the fibrates, practitioners are still contemplating the role of these agents in the treatment of CHD.",

    "195": "The study population (134,262 patients aged > or = 30 yrs) consisted of 55,118 patients who took statins and/or fibrates, 29,144 patients with hyperlipidemia not taking lipid-lowering agents, and 50,000 randomly selected patients without hyperlipidemia and without lipid-lowering treatment.", 
    "196": "We identified 1253 patients with pneumonia and matched them with 4838 control subjects based on age, sex, general practice, and index date. After adjusting for comorbidity and frequency of visits to general practitioners, we calculated the risks (odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals) of uncomplicated pneumonia, hospitalization for pneumonia with survival, and fatal pneumonia in participants who used statins compared with those who did not. Current statin users had a significantly reduced risk of fatal pneumonia (adjusted odds ratio 0.47, 95% confidence interval 0.25-0.88) and slightly but not significantly reduced risks of uncomplicated pneumonia and pneumonia hospitalization with survival. Recent or past statin use and fibrate use at any time were not associated with a reduced risk of pneumonia.", 
    "197": "Current use of statins was associated with a reduced risk of pneumonia. The risk reduction was particularly strong in the subgroup of patients with fatal pneumonias.", 
    "198": "Rates of coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality are 40% higher amongst South Asian men and women living in the UK compared with the general UK population. Despite an established excess CHD risk, little is known of the efficacy and safety of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) amongst South Asian migrants.", 
    "199": "Hyperlipidemic South Asian patients (raised or uncontrolled low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C]) were recruited from two UK centers (n = 33). After a five-week period, which included dietary advice, patients received atorvastatin 10 mg/d for five weeks to achieve a target LDL-C goal of < 3.0 mmol/L, titrated to 20 mg, 40 mg, or 80 mg for a further 12 weeks as required. Significant reductions in LDL-C levels from baseline were observed after 4 weeks' and 17 weeks' treatment with atorvastatin (> or = 33.6%; 26.0, 41.2). Overall, 81% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 62.5, 92.6%) achieved the target LDL-C after 4 weeks' treatment with 10 mg atorvastatin. Titration to a dose of more than 20 mg was required in only one patient (40 mg) at any point during the study. Nineteen patients reported at least one adverse event during the study; the majority were mild in severity and considered unrelated to atorvastatin.", 
    "200": "Atorvastatin was effective in achieving target lipid levels and was well tolerated. Statin therapy for high-risk South Asian individuals is likely to benefit CHD outcomes, although further and larger prospective trials are required."
