Prescribing physicians who manage patients from multiple insurers must be familiar with the variability in their patients' formulary incentives to help patients choose therapy wisely. However, the degree of formulary variability among and within health plans over time is unclear.", 
    "1": "In 6 major health plans in California, we evaluated formulary incentive variability in 4 of the 5 drug classes with the highest expenditures in California: proton pump inhibitors, hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (\"statins\"), calcium channel blockers, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. We categorized 20 branded members of these classes into either \"preferred\" or nonpreferred/uncovered categories. We calculated the consistency that brands were preferred across health plans and the frequency of changes in formulary status for each drug within plans between 2000 and 2002.", 
    "2": "None of the branded drugs evaluated were preferred on all formularies in 2002, and 10% were not available on any of the formularies. Formulary status varied greatly across plans, and more than 60% of drugs were preferred on 2 to 4 of the 6 formularies studied. Formulary status within health plans varied between 2000 and 2002 in more than half of the plans in the drug classes evaluated.", 
    "3": "In the drug classes evaluated, over a 2-year period, considerable variability was seen among and within formularies over time. This variability poses a challenge to physicians who wish to reduce patients' expenditures by prescribing the least expensive among similarly effective drugs within a drug class. This variability is especially relevant because recent legislation increases the likelihood that more Medicare beneficiaries will receive their medications from private health plans.", 
    "4": "Although less clinical intervention studies have been performed with fibrates than with statins, there are evidences indicating that fibrates may reduce risk of cardiovascular events. The potential clinical benefit of the fenofibrate will be specified by the ongoing Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) study, which rationale, methods and aims have been just published. Controlled clinical trials show similar or even greater cardiovascular benefits from statins-based therapy in patient subgroups with diabetes compared with overall study populations. Therefore, statins are the drug of first choice for aggressive lipid lowering actions and reducing risk of coronary artery disease in these patients. However, current therapeutic use of statins as monotherapy is still leaving many patients with mixed atherogenic dyslipidemia at high risk for coronary events. A combination statin/fibrate therapy may be often necessary to control all lipid abnormalities in patients with metabolic syndrome and diabetes adequately, since fibrates provide additional important benefits, particularly on triglyceride and HDL-cholesterol levels. Thus, this combined therapy concentrates on all the components of the mixed dyslipidemia that often occurs in persons with diabetes or metabolic syndrome, and may be expected to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Safety concerns about some fibrates such as gemfibrozil may lead to exaggerate precautions regarding fibrate administration and therefore diminish the use of the seagents. However, other fibrates, such as bezafibrate and fenofibrate appear to be safer and better tolerated. We believe that a proper co-administration of statins and fibrates, selected on basis of their safety, could be more effective in achieving a comprehensive lipid control as compared with monotherapy.",

Limited information is available regarding rates of progression of coronary calcification in women, particularly those with baseline scores above zero. Further, determinants of progression of coronary artery calcification in women are not well understood. This study prospectively evaluated rates and determinants of progression of coronary artery calcium score in a group of healthy postmenopausal women.", 
    "6": "We determined coronary calcium score by computed tomography and recorded demographic, lifestyle and health characteristics of 914 postmenopausal women, a subset of those enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study.

    "7": "Mean age of study participants was 65 +/- 9 years (mean +/- SD), body mass index was 26.1 +/- 6.1 kg/m2, and baseline calcium score was 162 +/- 220 Agatston units. Mean interval between scans was 3.3 +/- 0.7 years. A wide range of changes in coronary calcium score was observed, from -53 to +452 Agatston units/year. Women with lower scores at baseline had smaller annual increases in absolute calcium score. Coronary calcium scores increased 11, 31 and 79 Agatston units/year among women with baseline calcium score in the lowest, middle and highest tertiles. In multivariate analysis, age was not an independent predictor of absolute change in coronary calcium score. Hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin) use at baseline was a negative predictor (p = 0.015), whereas baseline calcium score was a strong, positive predictor (p < 0.0001) of progression of coronary calcification.", 
    "8": "Among postmenopausal women with coronary calcium score >or= 10 Agatston units, rates of change of coronary calcium score varied widely.

    "9": "Hypolipidemic drugs are potent serum cholesterol lowering agents used for prevention of coronary heart disease. In addition to their cholesterol lowering effect, these drugs exhibit both pleiotropic beneficial and various neurological side effects. Therefore, we analysed effect of the hypolipidemic drugs, fenofibrate and statins, on membrane lipid composition in the rat brain tissue. Male Wistar rats were given 0.1 mg of fenofibrate, lovastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin or placebo (control) once daily for six weeks. In rats treated with lovastatin or pravastatin, decreased cholesterol and increased ceramide monohexoside contents in the brain tissue were observed in comparison with control. Treatment with fluvastatin or lovastatin resulted in increased sphingomyelin and decreased diphosphatidylglycerol contents. The most important changes in the fatty acid profile were observed in ceramide monohexosides; treatment with fluvastatin decreased the content of saturated and increased the content of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Fenofibrate treatment led to decreased content of saturated fatty acids in phosphatidylethanolamines. In conclusion, statin treatment resulted in the decreased content of cholesterol and diphosphatidylglycerol associated with the increased content of sphingolipids in the rat brain tissue. As cholesterol and sphingolipids are important components of brain membranes, the observed alterations in the composition brain lipids might be involved in genesis of neurological and mental symptoms following statin therapy.",

Although only a small percentage of cerivastatin users also took gemfibrozil, approximately half of the case reports of rhabdomyolysis occurred in users of this combination therapy, and a cerivastatin-gemfibrozil interaction was supported by the results of a 3-day pharmacokinetic study. In internal company documents, multiple case reports suggested a drug-drug interaction within approximately 100 days of the launch in 1998; however, the company did not add a contraindication about the concomitant use of cerivastatin and gemfibrozil to the package insert for more than 18 months. Unpublished data available in July 1999 also suggested an increased risk of rhabdomyolysis associated with high doses of cerivastatin monotherapy. In late 1999 and early 2000, company scientists conducted high-quality analyses of the US Food and Drug Administration adverse event reporting system data. These analyses suggested that compared with atorvastatin calcium, cerivastatin monotherapy substantially increased the risk of rhabdomyolysis. To our knowledge, these findings were not disseminated or published. The company continued to conduct safety studies, some of them inadequately designed to assess the risk of rhabdomyolysis, until cerivastatin was removed from the market in August 2001.",

A subjective element is present in the effort to infer whether or not the occurrence of untoward outcomes in users of a particular drug was actually the consequence of the use of that drug, and, under the current system, a pharmaceutical company's appraisal of SADRs may be influenced by economic considerations. Such an appraisal would best be made by an independent group. The US Congress should mandate and provide adequate support for independent reviews and analysis of postmarketing data.",

Per year of therapy, the number needed to treat to observe 1 case of rhabdomyolysis was 22,727 for statin monotherapy, 484 for older patients with diabetes mellitus who were treated with both a statin and fibrate, and ranged from 9.7 to 12.7 for patients who were treated with cerivastatin plus fibrate.",

    "21": "Statins have cardioprotective roles. We explored the cardiac angiogenic effects of simvastatin in combination with transient overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Compared with normal mice, 1-year-old ApoE(-/-) mice fed on a high-fat diet (HFD) had about 30% less myocardial capillary (P < 0.001) and arteriolar (P < 0.03) densities, associated with decreased VEGF (55%), VEGFR-1 (56%) and VEGFR-2 (78%) mRNA expressions and myocardial endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) production (58%). By contrast, angiopoietin-1 and angiopoietin-2 mRNA expressions were increased (500% P < 0.02, and 400% P < 0.01, respectively) in the ApoE(-/-) hearts. No change was observed in Tie-2 gene expression. Phosphorylation of antiapoptotic Akt was lower and proapoptotic p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was higher in the ApoE(-/-) mice compared with controls. Intramyocardial VEGF gene transfer increased capillary and arteriolar densities in the ApoE(-/-) mice, and simvastatin treatment further enhanced capillary density (P < 0.03) to a level similar to that of normal mice. Simvastatin did not change the lipid profile but blocked p38 MAPK phosphorylation in the ApoE(-/-) myocardium. Concurrent with these changes, there were increased levels of expression of mVEGF (P < 0.04) and VEGFR-2 (P < 0.03) mRNAs and increased production of eNOS (P < 0.05) in the ApoE(-/-) mice, while no changes were detected in the angiopoietin system. Thus, increased myocardial angiogenesis in the ApoE(-/-) mice following transient overexpression of VEGF is further increased by additional simvastatin treatment. These effects occurred concurrently with simvastatin-induced stimulation of the VEGF system, increased eNOS production and reduction in p38 MAPK phosphorylation.",

Incident rates of major coronary events were 1.30 per 1,000 patient-years in the older group and 0.80 per 1,000 patient-years in the younger group. The incidence of a major coronary event was correlated to serum TC and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in both groups. The absolute risk of major coronary events in the older group was higher than in the younger group at any level of LDL-C, whereas the relative risk increased by 1.7% with an elevation of each 1 mg/dL LDL-C level in both groups. In the older group, the risk of major coronary events also increased as triglyceride level increased, whereas the risk decreased as high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level increased above 60 md/dL.",

There is increasing evidence that larger reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) are associated with greater improvements in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, which highlights the need for more efficacious statins. This article will review the lipid-altering effects of two new statins, rosuvastatin and pitavastatin. Rosuvastatin represents an advance in the pharmacological and clinical properties of other available agents. The large LDL-C reductions observed with rosuvastatin, even at the start dose of 10 mg and in patients switched from other statins to rosuvastatin 10 mg, should help to improve goal attainment, while reducing the need for dose titration. The ability of rosuvastatin to improve other elements of the lipid profile, such as high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides and non-HDL-C, may be of utility in patients with diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. Increases in HDL-C, along with the greater efficacy of rosuvastatin for reducing LDL-C and non-HDL-C, may obviate the need for combination therapy. Results of a number of outcome studies with rosuvastatin are expected over the next 5 years, which will contribute to the evidence base for statin therapy and cardiovascular disease prevention.", 
    "30": "Simvastatin is a long-established hydroxy-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, first introduced in 1988. At the maximal recommended dose of 80 mg/day, it produces an average reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) of 47%, accompanied by reductions in very LDL-C, triglycerides and apolipoprotein B, and a modest increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The only important, although rare, adverse effect of simvastatin is myopathy, an effect shared by all members of the class; when severe, this can take the form of rhabdomyolysis, which may lead to acute renal failure. The mechanism of the myopathy is not understood. The risk is increased by certain concomitant drugs, including gemfibrozil and potent inhibitors of cytochrome P450 3A4. Simvastatin has been studied in two large outcome trials, the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S), and the Heart Protection Study (HPS), both of which demonstrated strikingly beneficial effects on a variety of cardiovascular outcomes, with minimal adverse effects. 4S was the first study with a cholesterol-lowering agent to demonstrate an unequivocal reduction in all-cause mortality (30%; p = 0.0003). HPS showed that the beneficial effects of simvastatin were obtainable in a broad array of patients with, or at high risk of, coronary heart disease (CHD) in categories previously little studied, including women, the elderly, patients with diabetes without known CHD, and, perhaps most importantly, patients with LDL-C well below the UK population average. Simvastatin has recently become available in many countries as a combination product with the cholesterol absorption inhibitor, ezetimibe. Because of its long record of safety and demonstrated ability to reduce cardiovascular risk, simvastatin has recently become available without a prescription in the UK at the 10 mg dosage level.", 
    "31": "Chronic kidney disease is a progressive condition that results in significant morbidity and mortality. Because of the important role the kidneys play in maintaining homeostasis, chronic kidney disease can affect almost every body system. Early recognition and intervention are essential to slowing disease progression, maintaining quality of life, and improving outcomes. Family physicians have the opportunity to screen at-risk patients, identify affected patients, and ameliorate the impact of chronic kidney disease by initiating early therapy and monitoring disease progression. Aggressive blood pressure control, with a goal of 130/80 mm Hg or less, is recommended in patients with chronic kidney disease. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-II receptor antagonists are most effective because of their unique ability to decrease proteinuria. Hyperglycemia should be treated; the goal is an AIC concentration below 7 percent. In patients with dyslipidemia, statin therapy is appropriate to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Anemia should be treated, with a target hemoglobin concentration of 11 to 12 g per dL (110 to 120 g per L). Hyperparathyroid disease requires dietary phosphate restrictions, antacid use, and vitamin D supplementation; if medical therapy fails, referral for surgery is necessary.

Losartan alone or combined therapy significantly reduced blood pressure compared with simvastatin alone. Compared with losartan alone, simvastatin alone or combined therapy significantly changed lipoproteins. All 3 treatment arms significantly improved flow-mediated dilator response to hyperemia and decreased plasma malondialdehyde and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 levels relative to baseline measurements. However, these parameters were changed to a greater extent with combined therapy compared with simvastatin or losartan alone (both P<0.001 and P=0.030 for monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 by ANOVA). Combined therapy or losartan alone significantly increased plasma adiponectin levels and insulin sensitivity (determined by QUICKI) relative to baseline measurements.

    "40": "The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-coenzyme A (CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) have been shown to exhibit several vascular protective effects, including antithrombotic properties, that are not related to changes in lipid profile. There is growing evidence that treatment with statins can lead to a significant downregulation of the blood coagulation cascade, most probably as a result of decreased tissue factor expression, which leads to reduced thrombin generation. Accordingly, statin use has been associated with impairment of several coagulant reactions catalyzed by this enzyme. Moreover, evidence indicates that statins, via increased thrombomodulin expression on endothelial cells, may enhance the activity of the protein C anticoagulant pathway. Most of the antithrombotic effects of statins are attributed to the inhibition of isoprenylation of signaling proteins. These novel properties of statins, suggesting that these drugs might act as mild anticoagulants, may explain, at least in part, the therapeutic benefits observed in a wide spectrum of patients with varying cholesterol levels, including subjects with acute coronary events. The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have been shown to exhibit several vascular protective effects, including antithrombotic properties, that are not related to changes in lipid profile. Treatment with statins can lead to a significant downregulation of the blood coagulation cascade, most probably as a result of decreased tissue factor expression, which leads to reduced thrombin generation.", 
    "41": "All adults have stem cells in their body that can act like embryonic stem cells when given an appropriate stimulus. When VEGF is given, the bone marrow is stimulated to release stem cells, which grow new coronary arteries and also replenish damaged or dead cardiomyocytes. Transplanting autologous bone marrow stem cells into coronary arteries reduced infarct size, improved the prognosis following an acute MI and in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. Since patients are the source of their own stem cells, there would be a ready supply, with no rejection or immunological issues, and political debate on stem cell research would end. It is worth noting that statin therapy stimulates mobilization of EPCs, which repair damaged or dead myocardial cells and stimulate growth of new coronary arteries.", 
    "42": "This study was designed to examine changes of hemorheological parameters in patients with CHD and hypercholesterolaemia (wide range of plasma total cholesterol level from 5.6 to 9.8 mmol.l-1) subjected to lipid lowering therapy with statins (simvastatin, 10.0-20.0 mg/day, dosage was dependent on an initial level of total cholesterol). Twenty female subjects were enrolled in this research program. Both prior to and following drug treatment for eight weeks, hemorheological measurements included plasma viscosity, high and low shear whole blood viscosity, hematocrit, RBC aggregation and rigidity. Treatment with simvastatin significantly (p<0.05) reduced total cholesterol, total triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). However, the hemorheological effects of lipid lowering therapy differed markedly between macro- and microrheological groups of parameters: plasma and whole blood viscosity were not significantly changed whereas RBC aggregation and its rigidity were decreased significantly after statin treatment. These results thus suggest that the rheologic effect of lipid lowering therapy concerned mainly the microrheological parameters: red cell aggregation and deformability.", 
    "43": "This study evaluated whether pretreatment with statins was associated with a decreased incidence of periprocedural myocardial injury. Periprocedural myocardial injury occurs after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and is associated with adverse outcomes. The pleiotropic properties of statins stabilize plaque and decrease the inflammatory milieu of atherosclerotic lesions. Accordingly, we hypothesized that preprocedural statin therapy would decrease periprocedural myocardial injury. We enrolled 425 patients who underwent successful PCI. The control arm (n = 150) included patients not on statin therapy at the time of PCI, and the statin arm (n = 275) included patients who were taking statin medication before PCI. All patients had serial enzymes measured, including creatine kinase (CK), CK-MB, and troponin I. The incidence of increased levels of CK and CK-MB >3 times normal and the absolute increase in CK and troponin I were compared between groups. The control arm had significantly higher periprocedural levels of CK. In the control group, 6% of patients had CK increases >3 times the upper limit of normal compared with 1.8% in the statin group (p = 0.02). The control arm had a higher frequency of CK-MB increases >3 times the upper limit of normal (7.3% vs 2.2%, p = 0.01). There was a trend toward higher levels of troponin I in the control group (3.21 vs 1.85 ng/ml, p = 0.06).

    "48": "This study compared the effects of rosuvastatin on left ventricular infarct size in mice after permanent coronary occlusion vs. 60 min of ischemia followed by 24 h of reperfusion. Statins can inhibit neutrophil adhesion, increase nitric oxide synthase (NOS) expression, and mobilize progenitor stem cells after ischemic injury. Mice received blinded and randomized administration of rosuvastatin (20 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) or saline from 2 days before surgery until death. After 60 min of ischemia with reperfusion, infarct size was reduced by 18% (P = 0.03) in mice randomized to receive rosuvastatin (n = 18) vs. saline (n = 22) but was similar after permanent occlusion in rosuvastatin (n = 17) and saline (n = 20) groups (P = not significant). Myocardial infarct size after permanent left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion (n = 6) tended to be greater in NOS3-deficient mice than in the wild-type saline group (33 +/- 4 vs. 23 +/- 2%, P = 0.08). Infarct size in NOS3-deficient mice was not modified by treatment with rosuvastatin (34 +/- 5%, n = 6, P = not significant vs. NOS3-deficient saline group). After 60 min of ischemia-reperfusion, neutrophil infiltration was similar in rosuvastatin and saline groups as was the percentage of CD34(+), Sca-1(+), and c-Kit(+) cells. Left ventricular NOS3 mRNA and protein levels were unchanged by rosuvastatin. Rosuvastatin reduces infarct size after 60 min of ischemia-reperfusion but not after permanent coronary occlusion, suggesting a potential anti-inflammatory effect. Although we were unable to demonstrate that the myocardial protection was due to an effect on neutrophil infiltration, stem cell mobilization, or induction of NOS3, these data suggest that rosuvastatin may be particularly beneficial in myocardial protection after ischemia-reperfusion injury.", 
    "49": "The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that cytoskeletal actin fragmentation is mediated through caspase-2, specifically examining the ability of a caspase-2 inhibitor to interfere with actin fragmentation, in comparison with a caspase-3 inhibitor. Cardiomyocytes were cultured from embryonic chick heart. The fine structural element of cellular F-actin was visualized by staining cardiomyocytes with NBD-phallacidin. Lovastatin induced a dramatic and concentration-dependent loss of intact F-actin. The selectivity of this effect of lovastatin was demonstrated by the absence of similar changes in F-actin when cardiomyocytes were treated with the apoptotic stimulus palmitate, the metabolism of which produces acetyl CoA, the early substrate of cholesterol synthesis, through the mevalonate pathway. FACS analysis of NBD-phallacidin-stained cells was used to quantify the amount of F-actin loss. Actin fragmentation produced by lovastatin was operative through a caspase-2 pathway, as the caspase-2 inhibitor, z-VDVAD-fmk, significantly blocked lovastatin-induced changes in F-actin, but the caspase-3 inhibitor, Ac-DEVD-CHO, did not. Interruption of the mevalonate pathway was in part responsible for lovastatin's action, as the downstream metabolite mevalonate partially reversed the effect of lovastatin on actin fragmentation. These data indicate a previously unrecognized link between cytoskeletal actin and caspase-2.", 
    "50": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the most important cause of mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes. We aimed to determine the effect of statin therapy versus placebo on the progression of carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) in type 2 diabetic patients without manifest CVD.", 
    "51": "A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial was performed in 250 patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients were given either 0.4 mg cerivastatin or placebo daily. In August 2001, when cerivastatin was withdrawn from the market, 0.4 mg cerivastatin was replaced by 20 mg simvastatin without deblinding the study. The primary end point was the change of mean common carotid IMT, as measured by B-mode ultrasound, over 2 years.", 
    "52": "Common carotid IMT at baseline was 0.780 mm in the placebo group and 0.763 mm in the statin group and did not change significantly after 2 years. There was no significant difference in IMT change in any carotid segment between the groups. LDL cholesterol was reduced by 25% in the statin group and increased by 8% in the placebo group (P <0.001). Cardiovascular events occurred in 12 patients in the placebo group and two patients in the statin group (P=0.006).", 
    "53": "There was no effect of 2 years' statin therapy on carotid IMT in type 2 diabetic subjects. The natural history of IMT in our patients was milder than anticipated. In contrast, we observed a significantly lower cardiovascular event rate on statin therapy. Prognostic tools other than IMT should be explored in this patient group.", 
    "54": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the developed countries continues to grow at an epidemic proportion. There are a significant number of young adults with no clinical evidence of CVD, but who have two or more risk factors that predispose them to CV events and death. Many of these risk factors are modifiable, and by controlling these factors, the CVD burden can be decreased significantly. Recent statistics have shown that, if all major forms of CVD were eliminated, the life expectancy would rise by almost 7 years. Hence it is imperative that primary prevention efforts should be initiated at a young age to avert decades of unattended risk factors. Hyperlipidemia has been linked to CVD almost a century ago. Since then various clinical trials have not only supported this link, but have also shown the CV benefits in aggressively treating patients with hyperlipidemia. In this generation, we have various therapeutic agents that are capable of reducing the elevated lipid levels. With drugs like statins, we are able to reduce the risk of CVD by about 30% and avoid major adverse events. Newer drugs are being researched and introduced in the treatment of hyperlipidemia in humans. These can be used in combination therapy resulting in optimal levels of lipids. The new National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP)/Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) guidelines have come as a wake-up call to clinicians about primary prevention of CVD through strict lipid management and multifaceted risk management approach in the prevention of CVD.", 
    "55": "Dyslipidemia is a common feature of various renal diseases. This perturbed lipid metabolism results in accelerated atherosclerosis and increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Treatment of dyslipidemia, in addition to normalization of blood pressure and reduction of proteinuria, could provide additional means to retard the progression of chronic renal insufficiency. Possible therapeutic approaches include mainly dietary and life-style modifications, selective use of some technical components of dialysis systems, and the judicious prescriptions of lipid-lowering drugs. Even with relatively normal lipid and lipoprotein profiles statin therapy seems to prevent atherogenesis acceleration. A wide range of therapeutic interventions, targeting the lipid abnormalities that may develop in chronic renal patients and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are currently available, though still without convincing evidence based on long-term prospective studies which clearly demonstrate a significant reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of ESRD patients. However, extensive investigations, concerning the best long-term therapeutic strategy for this high-risk population of patients, are still missing.", 
    "56": "The enzyme, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) controls the biosynthesis of cholesterol. Hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis are critical health risk factors. One way of controlling these risk factors is to manipulate regulation as well as degradation of HMGR. At present, a class of compounds called statins, which are HMGR inhibitors, are used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. However, statins suffer major setbacks as their use produces more adverse reactions than the desirable one of inhibiting the enzyme. Genetically engineered forms of HMGR are also studied in primitive life forms like bacteria, but detailed investigation of this enzyme in human systems is certainly required. Extensive studies have been made on the regulatory aspects of this enzyme, but no breakthrough is conspicuous in the clinical background to find an alternative treatment for hypercholesterolemia. The immediate need is to find an alternate way of regulating degradation of the enzyme. This review presents the importance of regulation and degradation of the HMGR enzyme in different systems to gain possible insight into alternative schemes for regulating this enzyme and, if these exist, the feasibility of extending them same to studies in mammalian systems. A high degree of similarity exists between mammalian and yeast HMGR. Detailed studies reported on the regulation and degradation of the yeast enzyme also throw more light on the mammalian system, leading to a better understanding of ways of controlling hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "57": "New cholesterol guidelines will lead to use of statins more frequently and at higher doses. Myopathy, the most common and potentially most serious adverse effect, is dose-related. Rhabdomyolysis, which is rare, appears to occur at a similar rate with all currently marketed statins. Since it can occur without warning symptoms, patients who take high doses or are at high risk for other reasons should be monitored more closely. The possibility that statins could increase the incidence of some kinds of cancer in humans, as they do in animals, is not supported by most of the data available to date, but longer followup is needed.", 
    "58": "Hemodialysis (HD) patients are frequently in an elevated inflammatory state which is correlated to the atherosclerosis-related and overall morbidity and mortality in this population. Statins, beyond their antilipidemic effects, are also considered to have anti-inflammatory, immunomodulating and antioxidant properties. The individual response of HD patients to a short course of fluvastatin, the mechanisms involved in the immunomodulating and anti-inflammatory effects of this drug and the time interval to the appearance of these effects are investigated in this longitudinal study.", 
    "59": "In a group of 51 HD patients, fluvastatin 40 mg/day was administered for 4 weeks. Serial measurements of the lipid profile, C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and serum oxidized LDL (ox-LDL), were performed before, during, and after the treatment period.",

IL-6 and ox-LDL were reduced on day 28 (p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively) and IL-10 was increased on day 14 (p = 0.05); CRP did not change significantly during the treatment period while sIL-6R was increased on day 28 of fluvastatin administration (p < 0.05). In a subgroup of patients with CRP, IL-6, sIL-6R, and ox-LDL baseline serum values > or = the median and IL-10 < or = the median, CRP was reduced on day 28 of fluvastatin treatment (p < 0.01), IL-6 and ox-LDL were reduced earlier, on day 14 (p = 0.05 and p < 0.05, respectively) while sIL-6R did not change significantly during the treatment period.", 
    "61": "Treatment with fluvastatin rapidly modulates inflammation in HD patients. Enhancement of anti-inflammatory mechanisms and attenuation of the inflammatory and oxidative state contribute to this modulation. Patients in an elevated baseline inflammatory state respond more rapidly and effectively to the treatment. This immediate and multi-potent action of the statins could be clinically useful in acute atherosclerosis complications or in the treatment of chronic inflammation in HD patients.", 
    "62": "The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, or \"statins\", are used as cholesterol-lowering agents worldwide. Statins inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis, leading to enhanced uptake of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) from the circulation via LDL receptors. This strong cholesterol-lowering action contributes to the beneficial effects of statins. For example, large clinical trials have demonstrated that statins significantly reduce cardiovascular risk. Recent research has shown that statins have other multiple actions involved in endothelial function, cell proliferation, inflammatory response, immunological reactions, platelet function, and lipid oxidation. These \"pleiotropic actions\" of statins probably provide a significant contribution to the reduction of cardiovascular events. This review summarizes the pleiotropic actions of statins in both basic and clinical studies. It also considers the potential for statin therapy in the treatment of stroke and dementia.", 
    "63": "Effective therapy for chronic illness requires daily medication adherence (DMA) for prolonged periods. Overall medical regimen complexity may represent one barrier to successful adherence.", 
    "64": "To assess the relationship between the number of concurrently prescribed medicines and adherence to 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), we analyzed a cohort of 5488 patients in a single health insurance plan who began statin therapy between July 1, 1999, and June 30, 2002. We assessed 2 parameters of statin adherence: (1) DMA ([total number of pills dispensed/total number of days between first and last prescription] x100) and (2) refill persistence (RP) (consecutive months of refills after initial prescription).", 
    "65": "The cohort was 61.6% male, with a mean +/- SD age of 52.7 +/- 9.3 years. Patients were prescribed a mean +/- SD of 2.9 +/- 2 total medicines (range, 1-13), with a mean +/- SD statin DMA of 82.1% +/- 26.5%. By 12 months, only 68% of patients continued filling statin prescriptions. After controlling for age, income level, and treatment for hypertension or ischemic heart disease, a greater number of concurrently prescribed medicines was significantly associated with better DMA (P = .005) and longer RP (P = .03).", 
    "66": "In this cohort, statin DMA was generally adequate, but RP was suboptimal. Patients with more concurrently prescribed medicines had higher DMA and better RP, even after adjusting for demographic factors and cardiovascular comorbidity. Physicians should not be deterred from initiating statin therapy by a patient's medical regimen complexity but should be alert for lack of therapy persistence, particularly in younger and healthier patients.", 
    "67": "Scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), a receptor for high-density lipoprotein (HDL), plays an important role in the bidirectional cholesterol exchange between cells and HDL particles and the atherosclerotic lesion development. Enhancement of SR-BI expression significantly reduces, whereas lack of SR-BI expression accelerates, the atherosclerotic lesion development in proatherogenic mice. Statins, a class of inhibitors for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, significantly suppress de novo cholesterol synthesis and reduce the incidence of coronary heart disease. Statins also display multiple pleiotropic effects independently of cholesterol synthesis in the vascular cells. Here, we investigated the effects of pitavastatin (NK-104), a newly synthesized statin, on macrophage SR-BI expression.", 
    "68": "We found that pitavastatin significantly increased SR-BI mRNA and protein expression in a macrophage cell line in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. It also increased SR-BI expression in both mouse peritoneal and human monocyte-derived macrophages. Associated with increased SR-BI expression, pitavastatin enhanced macrophage HDL binding, uptake of [14C]cholesteryl oleate/HDL, and efflux of [3H]cholesterol to HDL. Pitavastatin abolished the inhibition of macrophage SR-BI expression by cholesterol biosynthetic intermediates. It also restored SR-BI expression inhibited by lipopolysaccharide and tumor necrosis factor-alpha through its inactivation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-kappaB.", 
    "69": "Our data demonstrate that pitavastatin can stimulate macrophage SR-BI expression by reduction of cholesterol biosynthetic intermediates and antiinflammatory action and suggest additional pleiotropic effects of statins by which they may reduce the incidence of coronary heart disease.",

    "81": "Ezetimibe/simvastatin (Inegy, Vytorin) therapy combines two lipid-lowering compounds with complementary mechanisms of action, thereby blocking the two sources of plasma cholesterol and improving lipid profiles. Thus, intestinal absorption of dietary cholesterol and related phytosterols is blocked by ezetimibe, with the biosynthesis of cholesterol in the liver inhibited by simvastatin. Developing management trends for primary hypercholesterolemia include the aggressive reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) to goals lower than previously considered appropriate, the targeting of lipid subfractions and atherogenic indices other than LDL-C alone, and the broader use of combination lipid-lowering therapy. In line with these trends, ezetimibe/simvastatin is an effective and generally well tolerated adjunct to dietary therapy for markedly reducing LDL-C levels, providing a 52% reduction with the recommended starting dosage. Furthermore, ezetimibe/simvastatin is formulated with variable doses of simvastatin (i.e. 10/10 mg, 10/20 mg, 10/40 mg, and 10/80 mg) and hence, the dosage may be adjusted to suit the individual patient's needs. As longer-term efficacy, tolerability, economic and outcome data accrue, ezetimibe/simvastatin will be positioned more definitively relative to existing and emerging lipid-lowering treatments. Currently, ezetimibe/simvastatin therapy represents a valuable novel option for the management of primary hypercholesterolemia across diverse patient populations and as an adjunct to other lipid-lowering treatments in those with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.",

In four CCTs a combination of Niaspan and statins showed an additional 22% reduction in LDL-C, 8% in TG and 6% in Lp(a) levels, compared with Niaspan monotherapy. Statin therapy had a minor additional effect of 1% on a total of 25% HDL-C increase during Niaspan treatment.

    "86": "Statins are investigational therapies for preventing or treating Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Hippocampal atrophy is a characteristic feature of MCI and AD. This study analyzed cross-sectional data from 246 nondemented elderly subjects to test the effect of lipid lowering agent (LLA) therapy on cognition and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of white matter lesions and hippocampal volume. The study also compared rates of hippocampal volume change over two and four years in a smaller subset. At baseline, LLA users were younger, better educated, more likely to be male, and had higher cognitive scores. Cognitive performance also varied by age and gender, and MRI measures varied by age. After adjusting for these differences, the effect of LLA use on baseline cognition, baseline hippocampal volume, and baseline white matter lesion scores was not significant. The effect of LLA use on hippocampal volume loss at two-year and four-year follow-ups was also not significant. This study is the first to examine statin effects on brain atrophy measured by MRI. In this cohort, statin use was not associated with rate of change of hippocampal volume. While the study was limited by a relatively small number of statin users, the findings seem consistent with three prior randomized trials that found no cognitive benefits for statins in nondemented subjects. Prospective studies in both nondemented and AD subjects may provide more conclusive answers.",

The expression of the cell-cell adhesion proteins, neural cell adhesion molecule and neural-cadherin was studied in a case of rhabdomyolysis induced by the hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor cerivastatin. Neural cell adhesion molecule and N-cadherin participate in the interactions of muscle cells during skeletal myogenesis. In the adult muscle, neural cell adhesion molecule is restricted to neuromuscular sites but is re-expressed in denervated muscle and in rhabdomyolysis. Our results show expression of neural cell adhesion molecule in regenerative skeletal muscle fibers but not in degenerated or unaffected fibers in cerivastatin-induced rhabdomyolysis. In contrast, N-cadherin was not expressed. The presence of apoptotic cells was studied by a fluorescence-based Tdt-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling in the same sections. Apoptosis was detected in degenerative fibers and inflammatory cells but not in regenerative fibers. We hypothesize that the expression of neural cell adhesion molecule in regenerative fibers may have a protective role against apoptosis during rhabdomyolysis. Cerivastatin-induced rhabdomyolysis appears to have common features with rhabdomyolysis of other causes. The immunohistochemical study of neural cell adhesion molecule can serve as an additional tool in the evaluation of muscle regeneration in rhabdomyolysis.",

In the present study, we have examined the effect of CsA on the in vivo disposition of CER in rats and the in vitro uptake of [14C]CER in isolated rat hepatocytes in an attempt to evaluate the effect of inhibition of transporter-mediated hepatic uptake on the in vivo CER disposition. The steady-state plasma concentration of CER increased 1.4-fold when coadministered with CsA up to a steady-state blood concentration of 4 microM. Studies of [14C]CER uptake into isolated rat hepatocytes showed saturable transport, with the saturable portion accounting for more than 80% of the total uptake. CsA competitively inhibited the uptake of [14C]CER with a Ki of 0.3 microM. The IC50 for the uptake of [14C]CER in the absence and presence of rat plasma was 0.2 and 2.3 microM, respectively. The in vivo hepatic uptake of [14C]CER evaluated by the liver uptake index method was also inhibited by CsA in a dose-dependent manner. On the other hand, CsA did not inhibit the metabolism of [14C]CER in rat microsomes. The in vitro and in vivo correlation analysis revealed that this pharmacokinetic interaction between these drugs in rats could be quantitatively explained by the inhibition of transporter-mediated hepatic uptake. Thus, this drug-drug interaction in rats is predominantly caused by the transporter-mediated uptake process.", 
    "107": "To study the mechanisms of vascular dysfunction in diabetes mellitus, we examined the responses of the aorta to adrenomedullin (AM) and ANG II in obese Zucker (OZ), lean Zucker (LZ), and OZ rats administered fluvastatin (OZ + Flu). AM-induced endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation was impaired in OZ rats compared with LZ rats, and fluvastatin restored AM-induced, endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation (%Deltatension at 10(-7) mol/l AM; LZ, -85.1 +/- 3.1%; OZ, -50.7 +/- 2.5%; OZ + Flu, -75.6 +/- 2.7%). Expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and Akt phosphorylation in response to AM (10(-7) mol/l) were also diminished in OZ rats. Fluvastatin restored the eNOS expression and Akt phosphorylation [eNOS expression (relative intensity): LZ, 2.3 +/- 0.4; OZ, 1.0 +/- 0.2; OZ + Flu, 1.8 +/- 0.3; Akt phosphorylation (relative intensity): LZ, 2.3 +/- 0.2; OZ, 1.0 +/- 0.3; OZ + Flu, 1.9 +/- 0.2]. ANG II-induced vasoconstriction was enhanced in the aortic rings of OZ rats compared with LZ rats, and this enhanced vasoconstriction was partially normalized by fluvastatin and was abolished when the aorta of OZ rats was preincubated with the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632. GTPgammaS-induced contraction of permeabilized aortic smooth muscle cells, which is an indicator of the Rho-dependent Ca(2+) sensitization of contraction, was enhanced in OZ rats compared with LZ rats, and this enhanced contraction was suppressed in OZ + Flu rats. These results suggested that endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation was impaired, Ca(2+) sensitization of contraction was augmented in blood vessels of OZ rats and that fluvastatin restored vascular function by activating the Akt-dependent pathway and inhibiting the Rho-dependent pathway.",

Diets that included either SL-1063 (0.046%, w/w) or lovastatin (0.02%, w/w) as a supplement, plus 1 g cholesterol/100 g diet were fed to rats ad libitum for 5 weeks. The total plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels were significantly lowered by the SL-1063 supplement compared to the control group. Meanwhile, the levels of plasma HDL-cholesterol and ratio of HDL-cholesterol/total cholesterol (%) were significantly higher in the SL-1063 group than in the control group. However, the lovastatin supplement did not affect the plasma lipid level. The hepatic cholesterol level and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase activity were significantly lowered in the lovastatin group compared to the SL-1063 group; however, the hepatic triglyceride level did not differ among the groups. The activity of hepatic acyl CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), the enzyme that catalyzes hepatic cholesterol esterification, was significantly lower in the lovastatin and SL-1063 groups than in the control group. Furthermore, the SL-1063 supplement elevated the excretion of fecal sterols. As regards the hepatic antioxidant enzyme system, the superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and glutathione reductase (GR) activities were all significantly higher in the SL-1063 group compared to the control group, whereas only the GR activity was significantly increased by the lovastatin supplement. No marked difference in the GSH levels and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activities was observed among the groups. The levels of plasma and hepatic thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were lowered by the SL-1063 supplement compared to the control group. Accordingly, the current results suggest that SL-1063, a synthetic derivative of 3,4-di(OH)-cinnamate, is effective in lowering the plasma lipids and improving the antioxidant enzyme system.", 
    "109": "The concentrations of serum cholesterol, cholestanol and non-cholesterol sterols were measured in a patient with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis under different therapeutic regimens. During treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) (750 mg/day) plus simvastatin (20 mg/day) for two years cholesterol and cholestanol concentrations averaged 188+/-10 mg/dl and 0.54+/-0.03 mg/dl. Thereafter treatment with simvastatin was discontinued. During treatment with low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-apheresis plus CDCA for 33 weeks, cholestanol concentrations reached almost normal levels (0.48+/-0.03 mg/dl immediately before and 0.32+/-0.02 mg/dl directly after LDL-apheresis, n=6). A further reduction of cholesterol and cholestanol was achieved by addition of simvastatin (20 mg/day). Cholesterol and cholestanol concentrations before and after LDL-apheresis during this treatment period averaged 122+/-4 mg/dl and 55+/-10 mg/dl, and 0.42+/-0.02 mg/dl and 0.18+/-0.06 mg/dl, respectively. Despite the consistent reduction of cholestanol to normal or even subnormal levels, a definite improvement of clinical symptoms was not noted. Our results suggest caution in the recourse to an aggressive cholestanol lowering therapy.", 
    "110": "The effect of genetic polymorphism of human organic anion transporting polypeptide C (OATP-C) on the lipid-lowering response to 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors was assessed. A retrospective study was conducted on 66 patients who underwent treatment of hyperlipidemia with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in a municipal hospital in a community-based cohort of Ehime prefecture in the southern part of Japan. Plasma lipid concentrations before and after administration were analyzed in patients in relation to the 521T/C (Val-174-->Ala) polymorphism in the OATP-C gene (TT: n=44 (66.7%), TC: n=20 (30.3%), CC: n=0 (0.0%), undetermined: n=2 (3.0%)). Total cholesterol level was significantly lowered after treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in all patients (p<0.001); moreover, subjects with the 521C allele showed an attenuated total-cholesterol-lowering effect compared with those homozygous for the 521T allele (-22.3+/-8.7% vs. -16.5+/-10.5%, p<0.05). These data suggest that the 521T/C polymorphism of the OATP-C gene modulates the lipid-lowering efficacy of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.", 
    "111": "The Eisai hyperbilirubinemic rat (EHBR) should be a useful animal model for studies on the toxicity of organic anions which are substrates of multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (Mrp2), since the systemic exposure to these compounds is expected to be increased in EHBR. In this study, we tested the value of EHBR for this purpose, using pravastatin (PV) and methotrexate (MTX) as model compounds. In the case of a single oral dose of PV (200 mg/kg), C(max) in plasma was 4.0-fold higher and AUC(0-infinity) was 3.6-fold larger than those of normal Sprague-Dawley rats (SDR), respectively. When multiple doses of PV were given to EHBR without co-administration of any other compound, drug-induced skeletal muscle toxicity (myopathy/rhabdomyolysis) and increased creatine phosphokinase (CPK) level were observed, whereas a control experiment using SDR did not show any toxic change. When a single dose of MTX (0.6 mg/kg) was given to EHBR orally, C(max) was 1.7-fold higher and AUC(0-infinity) was 1.6-fold larger than those of SDR, respectively. When multiple doses of MTX were given to EHBR, the changes in bone marrow, spleen and intestines were more severe than those in SDR. These findings support the view that EHBR would be a valuable animal model for toxicity studies on organic anion compounds which are substrates of Mrp2.",

    "113": "We selected a convenience sample of survey participants based upon prominence in the market, membership size, and by willingness to participate in our study. The 12 participating managed care organizations (MCOs) cover approximately 100 million lives. The 4 pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) cover approximately 200 million lives. The 3 large employers (one employer withheld quantitative results) provide medical coverage to nearly 1.4 million employees, both actives and retirees. Each survey participant received a verbal description of an OTC statin and a proposed patient self-management system. We asked each participant a series of questions to obtain opinions on a number of issues related to the potential introduction of an OTC statin.", 
    "114": "Our research findings can be summarized in the following key conclusions: (1) MCO representatives generally view OTC statins as a low-risk and beneficial addition to drug therapy options; (2) payer policies will continue to support access to prescription statins with no change in policy following introduction of an OTC option; (3) several of the MCOs and 75% of the PBMs anticipate a sharp, short-term increase in plan costs as a consequence of OTC statin availability; (4) survey participants believe that consumer or member reaction will be mixed and that consumer advertising and physician education will be important; (5) MCOs and PBMs are eager for involvement but cautious about partnerships with pharmaceutical companies; and (6) the details of any OTC statin offering will lay the foundation for its success.", 
    "115": "Based upon interviews conducted from April through June 2003, key decision makers from 4 PBMs, 12 MCOs, and 3 large employers generally considered the introduction of an OTC statin as a low risk and a beneficial addition to drug therapy. Most believed that increased awareness would result in an initial increase in plan costs, but long-term savings would accrue through improved care and availability of lower-cost OTC options for low-to-moderate-risk patients. The key concern is how to help patients gain enough knowledge and comfort to manage their own cholesterol therapy safely and successfully.", 
    "116": "Antiretroviral protease inhibitors have been shown to cause hyperlipidemia, raising concerns for the possibility of cardiovascular complications among HIV-infected patients. Statins have been successfully used in the management of hypercholesterolemia and were shown to exert antitumor effects. We report here that lovastatin and saquinavir exert cytostatic/cytotoxic effects against Daudi and Raji human lymphoma cells. Importantly, lovastatin potentiates the antitumor effects of saquinavir against these lymphomas in an additive manner. Addition of statins to antiretroviral treatment might therefore decrease some of its side effects while potentiating the antitumor effectiveness.", 
    "117": "The prevalence of the metabolic syndrome is increasing owing to lifestyle changes leading to obesity. This syndrome is a complex association of several interrelated abnormalities that increase the risk for cardiovascular disease and progression to diabetes mellitus (DM). Insulin resistance is the key factor for the clustering of risk factors characterizing the metabolic syndrome. The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III defined the criteria for the diagnosis of the metabolic syndrome and established the basic principles for its management. According to these guidelines, treatment involves the improvement of the underlying insulin resistance through lifestyle modification (eg, weight reduction and increased physical activity) and possibly by drugs. The coexistent risk factors (mainly dyslipidemia and hypertension) should also be addressed. Since the main goal of lipid-lowering treatment is to achieve the NCEP low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) target, statins are a good option. However, fibrates (as monotherapy or in combination with statins) are useful for the treatment of the metabolic syndrome that is commonly associated with hypertriglyceridemia and decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. The blood pressure target is < 140/90 mm Hg. The effect on carbohydrate homeostasis should possibly be taken into account in selecting an antihypertensive drug. Patients with the metabolic syndrome commonly have other less well-defined metabolic abnormalities (eg, hyperuricemia and raised C-reactive protein levels) that may also be associated with an increased cardiovascular risk. It seems appropriate to manage these abnormalities. Drugs that beneficially affect carbohydrate metabolism and delay or even prevent the onset of DM (eg, thiazolidinediones or acarbose) could be useful in patients with the metabolic syndrome. Furthermore, among the more speculative benefits of treatment are improved liver function in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and a reduction in the risk of acute gout.",

We reviewed case reports for patterns suggesting drug-related effects on prenatal development and considered a variety of mechanisms by which such effects, if confirmed, might occur. This uncontrolled case series included all FDA reports of statin exposures during gestation, as well as others from the literature and from manufacturers. Exposures and outcomes were reviewed and were tabulated by individual drug. Age-specific rates of exposure to each drug among women of child-bearing age were estimated. Of 214 ascertained pregnancy exposures, 70 evaluable reports remained after excluding uninformative cases. Among 31 adverse outcomes were 22 cases with structural defects, 4 cases of intrauterine growth restriction, and 5 cases of fetal demise. There were two principal categories of recurrent structural defects: cerivastatin and lovastatin were associated with four reports of severe midline CNS defects; simvastatin, lovastatin, and atorvastatin were all associated with reports of limb deficiencies, including two similar complex lower limb defects reported following simvastatin exposure. There were also two cases of VACTERL association among the limb deficiency cases. All adverse outcomes were reported following exposure to cerivastatin, simvastatin, lovastatin, or atorvastatin, which are lipophilic and equilibrate between maternal and embryonic compartments. None were reported following exposure to pravastatin, which is minimally present in the embryo. Statins reaching the embryo may down-regulate biosynthesis of cholesterol as well as many important metabolic intermediates, and may have secondary effects on sterol-dependent morphogens such as Sonic Hedgehog. The reported cases display patterns consistent with dysfunction of cholesterol biosynthesis and Sonic Hedgehog activity. Controlled studies are needed to investigate the teratogenicity of individual drugs in this class.",

This study explores the role of heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) as a target and mediator of statins. In cultured endothelial cells derived from human umbilical vein, simvastatin and lovastatin increased HO-1 mRNA levels in a concentration- and time-dependent fashion. HO-1 induction by statins remained unaffected by mevalonate and N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester, precluding the involvement of isoprenoid- and NO-dependent pathways. HO-1 mRNA induction was abrogated in the presence of actinomycin D and cycloheximide. In cells transfected with a reporter gene construct containing the proximal 4 kB of the HO-1 gene promoter 5'-flanking region, significant upregulation of promoter activity was detected, indicating that regulatory elements binding to this region were involved in transcriptional HO-1 induction by statins. Increased transcriptional expression of HO-1 was associated with elevated HO-1 protein levels and reduction of free radical formation. Our results show that the antioxidant defense protein HO-1 is a target site of statins in endothelial cells. Statins lead to HO-1 promoter activation, transcript and protein accumulation. This novel pathway may contribute to and explain the pleiotropic antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and antiatherogenic actions of statins.", 
    "136": "The effects of cerivastatin and fenofibrate on proteins involved in haemostasis and on markers of inflammation were investigated in otherwise healthy middle-aged males with combined hyperlipidemia. Besides classical risk factors, other so-called novel risk factors for coronary artery disease are seen to be playing an increasingly important role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Thirty-eight males, aged 49 +/-5 years were randomised to 12 weeks treatment either with cerivastatin at a daily dose of 0.2 mg to 0.4 mg to achieve the LDL cholesterol goal of <3.0 mM, or with fenofibrate 250 mg daily. Fasting serum lipids, homocysteine, total and free tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) antigen and activity, C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) were measured. No change in homocysteine level was observed in the cerivastatin group, while after fenofibrate administration it increased (p <0.0001). Total TFPI decreased significantly after cerivastatin (p = 0.002), but not after fenofibrate. Free TFPI did not decrease after either drug. Neither drug affected (t-PA) antigen and activity, while fenofibrate increased PAI-1 antigen (p <0.05) and activity (p <0.05). Cerivastatin decreased serum CRP values by 49.5% (p = 0.001), and fenofibrate by 29.8% (p = 0.03). The decreases of CRP in the two groups differed significantly (p = 0.04). IL-6 levels decreased significantly in the fenofibrate group (39%; p <0.0001), but not in the cerivastatin group (15%; p = 0.24) No significant decreases were observed for TNF-alpha. Cerivastatin had neutral effects on fibrinolysis, homocysteine or coagulation. On the other hand, fenofibrate increased PAI-1 antigen and activity and homocysteine, and did not affect coagulation. Both cerivastatin and fenofibrate reduced CRP levels, the decrease being significantly greater after cerivastatin. Fenofibrate also significantly decreased IL-6.",

Nevertheless, important differences exist between the statins in terms of LDL cholesterol-lowering, endpoint reduction, pleiotropic effects and toxicity. For this reason, it is incorrect to view all statins as being interchangeable as lipid-lowering therapy. In addition, it should be remembered that perhaps the main difficulty in clinical practice today does not concern details of the differences between statins but rather the fact that in many studies long-term compliance has been shown to be only around 30%.",

Atherosclerosis begins in childhood and lipid streaks have been identified in girls ages 15-19 in the abdominal aorta and the right coronary artery. Risk factors for cardiovascular disease in women include smoking, diabetes, hypertension, lipid disorders, and menopause. Observational studies have reported a 30-50% reduction in cardiovascular events when estrogen was administered to younger women for menopausal symptoms, yet randomized trials in older patients have failed to show benefit with hormonal replacement therapy. Recent studies have reported preservation of lipid and vascular vasodilatation with low-dose conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) in women and an absence of inflammatory and clotting changes that were observed in high-dose CEE. Recommendations for reducing cardiovascular risk in postmenopausal women include smoking cessation, regular exercise, and weight control. Should hormone therapy be continued beyond management of menopausal symptoms and treatment for osteoporosis, a statin drug should be added to eliminate future cardiovascular complications. Future research will examine low-dose hormonal therapy, earlier administration after menopause, newer agents, and routes of estrogen administration.", 
    "143": "3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha activators (fibrates) are the backbone of pharmacologic hypercholesterolemia and dyslipidemia treatment. Many of their clinical effects, however, are still enigmatic. This article describes how a side road of the mevalonate pathway, characterized in recent years, can rationalize a major fraction of these unexplained observations. This side road is the enzymatic isopentenylation of selenocysteine-tRNA([Ser]Sec) (Sec-tRNA), the singular tRNA to decode the unusual amino acid selenocysteine. The functionally indispensable isopentenylation of Sec-tRNA requires a unique intermediate from the mevalonate pathway, isopentenyl pyrophosphate, which concomitantly constitutes the central building block for cholesterol biosynthesis, and whose formation is suppressed by statins and fibrates. The resultant inhibition of Sec-tRNA isopentenylation profoundly decreases selenoprotein expression. This effect might seamlessly explain the immunosuppressive, redox, endothelial, sympatholytic, and thyroidal effects of statins and fibrates as well as their common side effects and drug interactions.", 
    "144": "Cultures of hepatocytes and HepG2 cells provide useful in vitro models of liver specific function. In this study, we investigated metabolic and biosynthetic function in 3-D HepG2 spheroid cultures, in particular to characterise changes on prolonged culture. We show that HepG2 cells cultured in spheroids demonstrate a reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential and respiration following 10 days of culture. This coincides with a modest reduction in glycolysis but an increase in glucose uptake where increased glycogen synthesis occurs at the expense of the intracellular ATP pool. Lowered biosynthesis coincides with and is linked to mitochondrial functional decline since low glucose-adapted spheroids, which exhibit extended mitochondrial function, have stable biosynthetic activity during extended culture although biosynthetic function is lower. This indicates that glucose is required for biosynthetic output but sustained mitochondrial function is required for the maintenance of biosynthetic function. Furthermore, we show that cholesterol synthesis is markedly increased in spheroids cf. monolayer culture and that inhibition of cholesterol synthesis by lovastatin extends mitochondrial and biosynthetic function. Therefore, increased cholesterol synthesis and/or its derivatives contributes to mitochondrial functional decline in extended HepG2 spheroid cultures.", 
    "145": "Cholesterol-independent, pleiotropic actions of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) lead to anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions by as yet unidentified mechanisms. This study explores the role of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) as target and potential mediator of rosuvastatin. In cultured human endothelial cells (ECV 304), rosuvastatin increased HO-1 mRNA and protein levels in a concentration-dependent fashion. HO-1 induction by rosuvastatin remained unaffected by mevalonate and N-nitro-L-arginine-methylester, showing that isoprenoid- and NO-dependent pathways were not involved. Pretreatment of endothelial cells with rosuvastatin reduced NADPH-dependent production of oxygen radicals. The HO-1 metabolite bilirubin, when added exogenously to the cells, virtually abolished NADPH-dependent oxidative stress. Rosuvastatin-induced inhibition of free radical formation was rescued in the presence of the HO inhibitor, tin protoporphyrin-IX. Our results demonstrate that HO-1 is a target site and antioxidant mediator of rosuvastatin in endothelial cells. This novel pathway may contribute to and partially explain the pleiotropic antiatherogenic actions of rosuvastatin.",

Statins appear to slow the progression of carotid artery intima-media thickness. Although the effect of statins on coronary endothelial function is uncertain, statins appear to improve peripheral endothelial function.

WOSCOPS found that patients with CRP values of > 4.59 mg/L at baseline were at the highest risk of coronary events. The PRINCE trial evaluated the antiinflammatory effects of pravastatin and found a mean 16.9% reduction in CRP levels after 24 weeks of therapy. AFCAPS/TexCAPS researchers found that lovastatin provded a 14.8% reduction in the median levels of CRP (p < 0.001). The MIRACL study showed that atorvastatin reduced CRP levels by 83% (p < 0.001). Researchers in the CURVES study found a significant reduction in CRP levels with pravastatin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin compared with baseline (p < 0.025). Results of the REVERSAL study linked atorvastatin with a 36.4% decrease in CRP levels, while pravastatin was associated with a 5.2% decrease (p < 0.0001). JUPITER is ongoing and will determine whether long-term use of rosuvastatin can reduce the rate of coronary events.",

    "162": "In the present study, we investigated the effects of simvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, on lipid metabolism, lipid peroxidation, antioxidant enzyme activities and ultrastructure of diabetic rat lung. Diabetes was induced by a single injection of streptozotocin (45 mg kg(-1), i.p.). After 8 weeks induction of diabetes, some control and diabetic rats were treated with simvastatin (10 mg kg(-1) rat day(-1); orally) for 4 weeks. Diabetes resulted in significantly high levels of blood glucose and plasma lipids. Malondialdehyde levels were unchanged after 12-week-old diabetic rats, whereas catalase activity significantly decreased in the lung. Glutathione peroxidase activity and nitric oxide level were significantly elevated in the diabetic lung. Histological analysis of the diabetic lung revealed some deterioration in the structure. Simvastatin treatment reduced plasma lipid levels and partially decreased the severity of hyperglycaemia. Catalase, glutathione peroxidase activities and nitric oxide levels were partially restored and accompanied by improved structure in diabetic lung by the simvastatin treatment. These results suggest that structural disturbances and alteration of antioxidative enzyme activities occurred in diabetic lung. Simvastatin treatment may provide some benefits in the maintenance of antioxidant status and structural organization of diabetes-induced injury of lung.",

Following recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and the American Heart Association, many physicians now routinely evaluate hsCRP along with cholesterol levels as a part of global risk prediction. Levels of hsCRP <1, 1-3, and >3 mg/L correspond to lower, moderate, and higher risk of cardiovascular events at all levels of the Framingham Risk Score and at all levels of metabolic syndrome. Interventions that lower hsCRP include diet, exercise, smoking cessation, statin therapy, and improved glycemic control. In addition to primary prevention, hsCRP is an important prognostic marker in acute coronary syndromes, following angioplasty, and in the long-term management of post-infarction patients. This article provides a clinically oriented overview of appropriate settings in which to measure hsCRP, how to interpret results, and how interventions to reduce vascular risk can be targeted on the basis of hsCRP findings.", 
    "164": "Combination therapy with a statin and niacin may provide optimal therapy for patients with combined hyperlipidemia and low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. The authors assessed the efficacy and safety of rosuvastatin monotherapy, extended-release (ER) niacin monotherapy, or rosuvastatin and ER niacin combined therapy in patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia. In a 24-week, open-label, multicenter trial, men and women aged > or =18 years with fasting levels of total cholesterol > or =200 mg/dL, HDL cholesterol > or =45 mg/dL, triglycerides 200-800 mg/dL, and apolipoprotein B > or =110 mg/dL were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups: rosuvastatin 10-40 mg, ER niacin 0.5-2 g, rosuvastatin 40 mg plus ER niacin 0.5-1 g, or rosuvastatin 10 mg plus ER niacin 0.5-2 g. Daily doses of rosuvastatin 40 mg monotherapy reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol levels significantly more than did either ER niacin 2 g monotherapy or rosuvastatin 10 mg combined with ER niacin 2 g. Addition of ER niacin 1 g to rosuvastatin 40 mg did not further reduce total or non-HDL cholesterol. Triglyceride reductions were similar among the four treatment groups. ER niacin mono- and combined therapy produced significantly greater rises in HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-1 than did rosuvastatin monotherapy. Rosuvastatin monotherapy was better tolerated than ER niacin taken either alone or with rosuvastatin. In this study, rosuvastatin very effectively improved the three major lipoprotein-lipid abnormalities of combined hyperlipidemia."
