In view of the potent anti-inflammatory effects of statins in vitro, we evaluated the impact of statin therapy on plasma MPO levels in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), treated with either intensive or conventional lipid-lowering therapy. Furthermore, we evaluated the relation between MPO levels and atherosclerosis progression, as determined by intima media thickness (IMT).",

There was no correlation between MPO levels and IMT progression, change in lipoproteins or hs-CRP.",

PHARMO RLS contains drug dispensing records from a representative sample of pharmacies located in more than 50 regions in the Netherlands. We selected all statin users in the database since 2003. The cost-savings of generic substitution of statin therapy for all simvastatin and pravastatin users, and of therapeutic substitution of statin therapy for other statin users were calculated. Substituting current users and new users of statins were considered separately. Therapeutic substitution was based on the medical history of the individual patient. Patients were only substituted if there was an appropriate substitute available. The appropriateness of substitution was based on drug-drug interactions between statins and possible comedication and the availability of an equipotent alternative.", 
    "6": "Substituting (generic and therapeutic) statin therapy for all current users would lead to potential annual savings of approximately 87 million euros. Substituting (generic and therapeutic) all starters on statin therapy would lead to potential annual savings of around 51 million euros. In the case of generic substitution only, the potential annual savings for all current simvastatin and pravastatin users would be 2.4 million euros and for the new users about 1.8 million euros.",

    "8": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) contributes significantly to morbidity and mortality in COPD. There is a high prevalence of traditional risk factors in this patient group including smoking, sedentary behaviour and low socio-economic class. However, large studies have shown that airflow limitation is an independent risk factor for CVD. Therefore there may be a 'COPD effect' that contributes to CVD in this condition, adding to the body of evidence that COPD has important systemic consequences, as well as being a lung disease. In this article, we review the evidence for CVD in COPD. Next, we examine systemic factors present in COPD, and link these to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, including inflammation, oxidative stress and hypoxia. Finally, we review those studies that have investigated therapeutic interventions in COPD that may modify cardiovascular risk.", 
    "9": "Treatments for spontaneous intracerebral, thrombolytic-induced and intraventricular hemorrhages (IVH) are still at the preclinical or early clinical investigational stages. There has been some renewed interest in the use of surgical evacuation surgery or thrombolytics to remove hematomas, but these techniques can be used only for specific types of brain bleeding. The STICH (Surgical Trial in Intracerebral Haemorrhage) clinical trials should provide some insight into the potential for such techniques to counteract hematoma-induced damage and subsequently, morbidity and mortality. More recently, clinical trials (ATACH [Antihypertensive Treatment in Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage] and INTERACT [Intensive Blood Pressure Reduction in Acute Cerebral Hemorrhage Trial]) have begun testing whether or not regulating blood pressure affects the well-being of hemorrhage patients, but the findings thus far have not conclusively demonstrated a positive result. More promising trials, such as the early stage CHANT (Cerebral Hemorrhagic And NXY-059 Treatment) and the late stage FAST (Factor VIIa for Acute Hemorrhagic Stroke Treatment), have addressed whether or not manipulating oxidative stress and components of the blood coagulation cascade can achieve an improved prognosis following spontaneous hemorrhages. However, CHANT was halted prematurely because although it showed that the spin trap agent NXY-059 was safe, it also demonstrated that the drug was ineffective in treating acute ischemic stroke. In addition, the recombinant activated factor VII FAST trial recently concluded with only modestly positive results. Despite a beneficial effect on the primary end point of reducing hemorrhage volume, controlling the coagulation cascade with recombinant factor VIIa did not decrease the mortality rate. Consequently, Novo Nordisk has abandoned further development of the drug for the treatment of intracerebral hemorrhaging. Even though progress in hemorrhage therapy that successfully reduces the escalating morbidity and mortality rate associated with brain bleeding is slow, perseverance and applied translational drug development will eventually be productive. The urgent need for such therapy becomes more evident in light of concerns related to uncontrolled high blood pressure in the general population, increased use of blood thinners by the elderly (e.g., warfarin) and thrombolytics by acute ischemic stroke patients, respectively. The future of drug development for hemorrhage may require a multifaceted approach, such as combining drugs with diverse mechanisms of action. Because of the substantial benefit of factor VIIa in reducing hemorrhage volume, it should be considered as a prime drug candidate included in combination therapy as an off-label use if the FAST trial proves that the risk of thromboembolic events is not increased with drug administration. Other promising drugs that may be considered in combination include uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonists (such as memantine), antioxidants, metalloprotease inhibitors, statins and erythropoietin analogs, all of which have been shown to reduce hemorrhage and behavioral deficits in one or more animal models.", 
    "10": "The endovascular perforation rodent model for experimental subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) studies is criticized for lack of control over bleeding. Presently, there is no practical grading system to categorize the severity of SAH depending on the amount of blood. We outline a simple and objective novel SAH grading system by examining the subarachnoid blood clots in the basal cisterns, and evaluate for correlation with neurological status and cerebral vasospasm. Effects of simvastatin, known to reduce vasospasm, were examined using this grading system. Seventy-seven adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided randomly into three groups: sham-operated (n=24), SAH (n=32), and SAH+simvastatin (n=25). High-resolution brain pictures were used to grade the severity of SAH and categorize animals into mild, moderate and severe groups. The SAH grades were compared with neurological scores and internal carotid artery parameters such as diameter, perimeter and wall thickness at 24h. Two investigators verified the grading system independently. The SAH grade showed linear correlation functionally with neurological status (r=0.42, p<0.01) and morphometrically with the degree of vasospasm (|r|>0.7, p<0.01), and also between two independent investigators (r=0.937, p<0.001). Simvastatin improved neurological score in moderate and severe (p<0.05) but not mild SAH groups (p=0.28). This grading system has the potential to be adopted for SAH experimental rodent models.",

    "12": "One hundred sixty-eight patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) prospectively received simvastatin as a single-agent therapy (20mg day-1 p.o.) for 12 weeks. Serum lipid levels were determined before and after simvastatin treatment. Genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP).", 
    "13": "Subjects with the AA homozygotes had significantly higher serum very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) levels than those with the aa homozygotes. In addition, in 168 patients with T2DM who took 20mg simvastatin, the VLDL-C lowering effect by simvastatin in subjects with the aa homozygotes was significantly lower than in those with the Aa heterozygotes and AA homozygotes.", 
    "14": "Simvastatin treatment significantly decreased plasma lipids in all patients (P<0.01). Importantly, we demonstrate that ScrF I polymorphism of the HMGCR gene in patients with T2DM groups is associated with significant elevation of serum VLDL-C levels. Subjects with the AA homozygotes had significantly higher serum high VLDL-C levels than those with the Aa heterozygotes and aa homozygotes (AA: 2.18+/-0.51; Aa: 2.04+/-0.59, aa: 1.86+/-0.43, P<0.05 for comparison among three genotypes and P<0.01 for difference between AA and aa). Furthermore, this polymorphism tends to show an enhanced response to an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor in terms of the cholesterol-lowering effect. In 168 patients with T2DM who took 20mg simvastatin, the VLDL-C lowering effect by simvastatin in subjects with the AA homozygotes was significantly lower than in those with the Aa heterozygotes and aa homozygotes (the reduction in serum VLDL-C levels; 37.03+/-5.67 versus 28.97+/-4.96, P<0.01; 34.62+/-5.87 versus 28.97+/-4.96, P<0.05). These results suggest that the HMGCR gene may serve as a modifier gene for hypercholesterolemia in Chinese diabetic patients.", 
    "15": "Epidemiologic data indicate a large increase in cardiovascular risk in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Non-invasive investigations show increases in intima-media thickness, carotid plaque, and coronary artery calcifications in patients with SLE, compared to controls. Conventional cardiovascular risk factors may fail to fully explain the high cardiovascular risk in SLE patients. Immunological disturbances and inflammation may indirectly contribute to the risk of cardiovascular disease by inducing dyslipidemia and/or insulin resistance. The potential role for glucocorticoid therapy is controversial. Effective control of the disease would be expected to decrease the cardiovascular morbidity and mortality rates. Careful attention should be given to controlling conventional risk factors such as obesity, smoking, and physical inactivity. Hypertension and/or dyslipidemia should be treated optimally. The appropriateness of antiplatelet therapy should be assessed.", 
    "16": "Chinese red yeast rice (RYR) is a food herb made by fermenting Monascus purpureus Went yeast with white rice. RYR contains a mixture of monacolins, one of which--monacolin K (MK)--is identical to lovastatin (LV). Epidemiological studies show that individuals taking statins have a reduced risk of colon cancer. In the present study, LV decreased cellular proliferation (P<.001) and induced apoptosis (P<.05) in HCT-116 and HT-29 human colon cancer cells. RYR inhibited both tumor cell growths (P<.001) and enhanced apoptosis (P<.05) in HCT-116 cells. Inhibition of proliferation was reversed by mevalonate (MV) in LV-treated cells, since LV is a 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl CoA reductase (HMGCR) inhibitor. However, RYR with MV did not reverse the observed inhibition of growth. MK-free RYR did not reverse the observed LV-mediated inhibition of cancer cell growth. These observations suggest that other components in RYR, including other monacolins, pigments or the combined matrix effects of multiple constituents, may affect intracellular signaling pathways differently from purified crystallized LV in colon cancer cells. RYR was purified into two fractions: pigment-rich fraction of Chinese red yeast rice (PF-RYR) and monacolin-rich fraction of Chinese red yeast rice (MF-RYR). The effect of MF-RYR was similar to that of LV, while the effect of PF-RYR was similar to the effect of the whole RYR extract on the proliferation, apoptosis and mRNA level of HMGCR and sterol response element binding protein-2. These results suggest that the matrix effects of RYR beyond MK alone may be active in inhibiting colon cancer growth. RYR with or without MK may be a botanical approach to colon cancer chemoprevention worthy of further investigation.",

Our aim was to determine whether the increase in HDL depends on CETP expression.", 
    "18": "APOE*3-Leiden (E3L) mice, with a human-like lipoprotein profile and a human-like responsiveness to statin treatment, were crossbred with mice expressing human CETP under control of its natural flanking regions resulting in E3L.CETP mice. E3L and E3L.CETP mice were fed a Western-type diet with or without atorvastatin. Atorvastatin (0.01% in the diet) reduced plasma cholesterol in both E3L and E3L.CETP mice (-26 and -33%, P<0.05), mainly in VLDL, but increased HDL-cholesterol only in E3L.CETP mice (+52%). Hepatic mRNA expression levels of genes involved in HDL metabolism, such as phospholipid transfer protein (Pltp), ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (Abca1), scavenger receptor class B type I (Sr-b1), and apolipoprotein AI (Apoa1), were not differently affected by atorvastatin in E3L.CETP mice as compared to E3L mice. However, in E3L.CETP mice, atorvastatin down-regulated the hepatic CETP mRNA expression (-57%; P<0.01) as well as the total CETP level (-29%) and cholesteryl esters (CE) transfer activity (-36%; P<0.05) in plasma.",

There is increasing evidence to suggest that COPD is also characterized by systemic inflammation. The primary goal of this study was to identify soluble proteins in plasma that associate with the severity of airflow limitation in a COPD cohort with stable disease. A secondary goal was to assess whether unique markers associate with diffusion impairment, based on diffusion capacity of carbon monoxide (DLCO), independent of the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1).",

Critical to this process is the ability to confirm known, expected impurities and identify new impurities. LC coupled to electrospray MS is a powerful tool that has been employed for the identification of impurities, natural products, drug metabolites, and proteins. In this study, we show how sub 2 microm porous particle LC has been coupled to hybrid quadrupole orthogonal TOF mass spectrometer to profile and identify the impurities of the common cholesterol lowering drug simvastatin. The hybrid quadrupole TOF mass spectrometer was operated by alternating the collision cell energies to allow for the rapid, facile conformation of the identity of impurities. Using this process it was possible to identify all of the common impurities of simvastatin in a single 10 min run. During the analysis a new impurity of simvastatin was detected and identified as the saturated ring form of simvastatin.",

Twenty-five reports mentioned rhabdomyolysis associated with statins (not including cerivastatin) before the safety alert (ROR 5.8; 95% CI 3.8, 9.0), and 63 did so after the alert (ROR 9.4; 95% CI 7.0, 13.0).

    "30": "Understanding the biochemical mechanisms influencing bubble pathophysiology may foster novel pharmacologic non-recompressive strategies that may prevent, ameliorate, and treat decompression sickness (DCS), and the injury sustained from arterial gas emboli (AGE) encountered in hyperbaric and hypobaric exposures, as well as in surgery and trauma. This review explores the biochemical effects of nitric oxide (NO) release agents, their potential impact on bubble pathophysiology, and possible use as a pharmacological intervention to reduce DCS risk and AGE injury. The hypotheses discussed contend that exogenous NO administration or mediators of endogenous NO up-regulation may reduce DCS risk and severity by mediating; (1) decreased populations of gaseous nuclei, (2) decreased bubble nuclei adherence, (3) depression of the deleterious bubble-mediated inflammatory and coagulation cascades and (4) preservation of endothelial integrity, which may defend against bubble-mediated injury. Statin medications alter numerous biochemical, and biophysical processes, which may influence bubble formation. Statins preserve endothelial integrity, reduce ischemia/reperfusion injury, and depress the interdependent inflammatory and coagulation cascades via pleiotropic properties involving up-regulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and NO. Numerous studies are researching statins, for their potential efficacy in reducing primary and secondary morbidity and mortality from cardiocerebrovascular, inflammatory (autoimmune), and infectious (sepsis) disease. Additionally, statin-mediated lipid reduction may reduce bubble generation via alterations in plasma \"rheology\", and surface tension. The statins are attractive potential NO release with minimal adverse side effects, and proven long-term safety, that may potentially mitigate the risk and severity of DCS. We will elaborate on the insight gained into the mechanisms proven and hypothesized for NO-mediated reductions in bubble formation, and DCS incidence and severity, with a focus on the potential for statin medications, in addition to the direct NO-donor medications such as isosorbide mononitrate and nitroglycerine.",

    "35": "The objective of this study was to assess how the dosing method (i.e., gavage versus diet) affects the absorption and disposition of lovastatin, as well as its effect on two biological markers of exposure, such as serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides. In preclinical safety studies the test agent is normally administered by gavage, but in chemoprevention efficacy studies the test agent is usually administered with the diet. Therefore, extrapolation of safety and efficacy data from laboratory animals to humans should consider the influence of the method of administration on the absorption, disposition and effect of the drug. Lovastatin, a blood cholesterol-lowering drug with a short elimination half-life in humans, was used to assess the influence of two different dosing methods on the drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Plasma and liver concentrations of lovastatin and its active metabolite lovastatin-Na were measured in female rats at sequential times after administration. Serum concentrations of triglycerides and cholesterol were measured at similar times and used as biomarkers of effect. Significant differences in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were observed after administration of lovastatin by the two oral dosing paradigms. In general, oral gavage resulted in higher peak and lower trough concentrations of lovastatin and lovastatin-Na in plasma and liver, lower area under the concentration-time curve of lovastatin-Na in plasma and liver, and less of an effect on the serum concentrations of triglycerides and cholesterol than the corresponding diet dosing. Although no inverse linear relationship was observed between pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic markers, in the case of serum cholesterol a visual trend could be observed which might have proven significant had data from a larger number of dose levels been available. As in our previous study with sulindac, this study illustrates potential limitations in trying to extrapolate from data obtained using different dosing schemes to potential safety and efficacy in humans.",

The Framingham Study was the first to demonstrate the inverse relationship between HDL-C and risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). This relationship was present at all levels of LDL-C, whereas the highest risk was associated with low HDL-C and high LDL-C. THE ANTIATHEROGENIC ACTIONS OF HDL-CHOLESTEROL: The antiatherogenic actions of HDL-C are complex. HDL-C plays a major role in reverse cholesterol transport, mobilizing cholesterol from the periphery to the liver. In addition, cardioprotective effects of HDL-C include endothelial protection, anti-inflammatory activity, as well as antioxidant and antithrombotic effects.", 
    "41": "In addition to lowering LDL-C, statins increase HDL-C by 5 to 15% by increasing apolipoprotein A-I synthesis. Fibrate therapy results in an increase in HDL-C of 10 to 25 % by activating PPAR- , which stimulates hepatic apolipoprotein A-I gene expression. Niacin is the most effective agent used for increasing HDL-C, causing increase of 15 to 35%. The side effects of niacin therapy, which is largely mediated by prostaglandins, may be minimized by the use of prolonged-release formulation of nicotinic acid. Combination therapy with HDL-raising agents, such as nicotinic acid and statin, markedly increases HDL-C, lowers LDL-C and improves the lipoproteins subclass distribution.",

In this study, we evaluated the effects of rosuvastatin on the MPV levels in patients with uncontrolled primary dyslipidemia with hypolipidemic treatment. We selected 30 age, sex and body mass index matched patients with uncontrolled primary dyslipidemia and hypolipidemic diet treatment and 30 normolipidemic healthy subjects. Dyslipidemic patients were treated with 10 mg/day rosuvastatin for 12 weeks. Metabolic parameters and MPV were measured at baseline and after rosuvastatin treatment in dyslipidemic group.

Prolonged-release (PR) nicotinic acid (1 g/day) was added in patients with HDL-C < 40 mg/dl (1.03 mmol/l) on statin alone. The second submodel used standard Markov techniques to evaluate long-term clinical and economic outcomes based on Framingham risk estimates.

High levels of soluble P-selectin (sP-selectin) and von Willebrand factor predict an increased risk for cardiovascular events and correlate to atherosclerotic risk factors. The relationship between these markers and TLR-4 gene polymorphisms was evaluated in a cohort of consecutive hypercholesterolemic outpatients. TLR-4 gene polymorphisms were detected in 48 out of 330 (14%) patients with hypercholesterolemia. Lipid and inflammatory markers, sP-selectin and von Willebrand were evaluated in carriers and in 96 (ratio 2:1 to cases) age- and sex-matched TLR-4 wild-type patients randomly selected from the same population. A cohort of normocholesterolemic outpatients (n = 262) served as the control group. sP-selectin was sensibly lower in carriers of TLR-4 variants as compared to wild-types and controls (89 ng/ml vs. 162 ng/ml and 163 ng/dl, respectively, p = 0.0001). Similarly, carriers showed lower von Willebrand factor values (683 mU/ml) than wild-types (910 mU/ml; p = 0.001). In multivariate analysis, TLR-4 gene polymorphisms were positively associated with sP-selectin, whereas the relationship with von Willebrand factor was no longer significant. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors reduced sP-selectin and von Willebrand factor levels independently of TLR-4 gene variants. Plasma concentrations of these markers, however, remained lower in carriers of TLR-4 gene polymorphisms even after cholesterol lowering. In conclusion, carriership of Asp299 and Thr399Ile TLR-4 gene polymorphisms is associated with lower levels of sP-selectin and von Willebrand factor among hypercholesterolemic patients. While the underlying mechanisms remain to be investigated, such an association may indicate a protective effect of TLR-4 variants for atherosclerosis.",

The increased risk of coronary heart disease in type 2 diabetes is due, in part, to lipid abnormalities often present in the diabetic patient. Diabetic dyslipidemia is characterized by elevated triglycerides, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and an increased preponderance of small, dense low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) particles. Current guidelines for the prevention of coronary heart disease in diabetic patients identify elevated LDL-C as the primary target of lipid-lowering therapy, and recommend statins as the first-line treatment for diabetic dyslipidemia.

This new era started when a promising concept - the Polypill - was introduced by Wald et al. in 2003. The Polypill is a theoretical combination of six pharmacological compounds (a statin, three different antihypertensives, aspirin, and folic acid) that in combination could reduce cardiovascular disease by more than 80%. Although the Polypill could theoretically be a highly effective intervention, it is not yet available in the market and its effectiveness remains unproven. In the population at large, cheap prizes may come at prohibitive costs. With frail elderly and population prevalences of co-morbidity far higher than in drug trials, rare adverse effects may be frequent. In December 2004, a more natural, safer, and probably tastier alternative to the Polypill - the Polymeal - was introduced. Contrary to the Polypill, the Polymeal combined 6 different foods (fruits and vegetables, almonds, chocolate, wine, fish, and garlic) that taken together in a regular basis could cut cardiovascular disease risk by over 75%.

This study analyzed the individual and mixture toxicity of these six PPCPs to the marine phytoplankton species Dunaliella tertiolecta using a standard 96-hour static algal bioassay protocol. All PPCPs tested had a significant effect on D. tertiolecta population cell density. However, of the six PPCPs tested, only triclosan yielded toxicity at typical environmental concentrations. The 96-hour EC(50) values for triclosan, fluoxetine, simvastatin, diclofenac, and clofibric acid were 3.55 microg/L, 169.81 microg/L, 22,800 microg/L, 185,690 microg/L, and 224,180 microg/L, respectively. An EC(50) value could not be determined for carbamazepine; however, the highest concentration tested (80,000 microg/L) reduced cell density by 42%. Both mixtures tested-simvastatin-clofibric acid and fluoxetine-triclosan-demonstrated additive toxicity. The presence of PPCP mixtures may decrease the toxicity threshold for phytoplankton populations. Detrimental effects on phytoplankton populations could ultimately impact nutrient cycling and food availability to higher trophic levels. The results of this study are a first step toward identifying the risk of PPCPs to estuarine organisms and may benefit environmental resource managers.",

This study examined the role of the cystein protease calpain in force-induced vascular cell apoptosis and its effect on injury-induced vascular remodeling processes. VSMCs were exposed to cyclic tensile force in vitro, which resulted in increased p53 protein expression and transcriptional activity as well as a significant increase of apoptotic VSMCs. Apoptosis was prevented by the p53 inhibitor pifithrin and by p53 antisense oligonucleotides, indicating dependency of force-induced apoptosis on p53. Simultaneously, calpain activity increased by mechanical stress. Prevention of calpain activation by calpeptin or antisense oligonucleotides augmented strain-induced p53 expression and transcriptional activity, resulting in a further increase of apoptotic rate. p53 protein was directly disintegrated by activated calpain. The in vivo relevance of the findings was tested: pharmacologic inhibition of initial calpain activation augmented early apoptosis of medial VSMCs 24 h after balloon injury in a p53-dependent manner but resulted in a marked increase in late neointima formation. We conclude that calpain counteracts mechanically induced excessive VSMC apoptosis through its p53-degrading properties, which identifies calpain as a key regulator of mechanosensitive remodeling processes of the vascular wall.",

AT treatment of the donor induced a Th-2 cytokine profile in the adoptively transferred T cells and reduced their in vivo expansion, which translated into significantly reduced aGVHD lethality. Host treatment down-regulated costimulatory molecules and MHC class II expression on recipient antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and enhanced the protective statin effect, without impacting graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) activity. The AT effect was partially reversed in STAT6(-/-) donors and abrogated by L-mevalonate, indicating the relevance of STAT6 signaling and the L-mevalonate pathway for AT-mediated aGVHD protection. AT reduced prenylation levels of GTPases, abolished T-bet expression, and increased c-MAF and GATA-3 protein in vivo.

Considerable evidence suggests that immune mediated mechanisms play a dominant role in the beneficial effects of statins. Naturally occurring CD4(+)CD25(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) have a key role in the prevention of various inflammatory and autoimmune disorders by suppressing immune responses. We tested the hypothesis that statins influence the circulating number and the functional properties of Tregs. We studied the effects of in vivo and in vitro statin treatment of human and murine mononuclear cells on the number of Tregs and the expression level of their master transcription regulator, Foxp3. Atorvastatin, but not mevastatin nor pravastatin, treatment of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) increased the number of CD4(+)CD25(high) cells, and CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) cells. These Tregs, induced by atorvastatin, expressed high levels of Foxp3, which correlated with an increased regulatory potential. Furthermore, co-culture studies revealed that atorvastatin induced CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) Tregs were derived from peripheral CD4(+)CD25(-)Foxp3(-) cells. Simvastatin and pravastatin treatment in hyperlipidemic subjects increased the number of Tregs. In C57BL/6 mice however, no effect of statins on Tregs was evident. In conclusion, statins appear to significantly influence the peripheral pool of Tregs in humans. This finding may shed light on the mechanisms governing the plaque stabilizing properties of statins.",

The benefit of statin therapy on individual cardiovascular outcomes other than restenosis is largely unknown. Hence, a meta-analysis of the available randomized trials was conducted to evaluate individual cardiovascular outcomes with statin therapy compared with placebo after elective percutaneous coronary intervention. In all, there were 6 studies available for analysis (Prevention of Restenosis by Elisor After Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty [PREDICT], Fluvastatin Angioplasty Restenosis [FLARE], the Lescol Intervention Prevention Study [LIPS], German Atorvastatin Intravascular Ultrasound [GAIN], Atorvastatin for Reduction of Myocardial Damage During Angioplasty [ARMYDA], and a study by Briguori et al) that randomized 3,941 patients (1,967 to statins and 1,974 to placebos). Clinical follow-up ranged from 1 day to 45 months. The incidence of myocardial infarction was 3.0% in the statin group and 5.2% in the placebo group (odds ratio [OR] 0.57, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.42 to 0.78, p<0.0001). The incidence of all-cause mortality was 2.3% versus 3.0% (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.1, p=0.14), that of cardiovascular mortality was 0.71% versus 1.2% (OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.30 to 1.11, p=0.10), and that of repeat surgical or percutaneous revascularization was 19.6% versus 21.9% (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.02, p=0.098) in the statin arm versus the placebo arm, respectively. The incidence of stroke was 0.4% in the statin arm and 0.08% in the placebo arm (OR 3.00, 95% CI 0.60 to 14.77, p=0.18).

Seventy-two percent of patients with LDL levels>or=100 mg/dl, compared with 55% of patients with LDL levels<100 mg/dl, were discharged on statin therapy. Sociodemographic, clinical, and treatment variables varied between patients discharged on statins and those who were not. Patients receiving statins at discharge were twofold (LDL>or=100 mg/dl) to threefold (<100 mg/dl) more likely to be receiving statin therapy at 6 months compared with those not receiving statins at discharge. Statin use at discharge was associated with a significantly lower rate of 6-month cardiac complications in patients with LDL levels<100 mg/dl (adjusted odds ratio for the composite end point of myocardial infarction, stroke, and death 0.64, 95% confidence interval 0.47 to 0.88). In conclusion, data from this large observational study suggest that patients with acute coronary syndromes and LDL levels<100 mg/dl are much less likely to be prescribed statin therapy at hospital discharge or to be receiving statin therapy at 6 months but benefit from the prescription of statins at hospital discharge as much as patients with levels>or=100 mg/dl.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of long-term (4 weeks) treatment of hHTG rats with three drugs which, according to their mechanism of action, may be able to modify the endothelial function: simvastatin (an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase), spironolactone (an antagonist of aldosterone receptors) and L-arginine (a precursor of nitric oxide formation). At the end of fourth week the systolic blood pressure in the control hHTG group was 148+/-2 mm Hg and in control normotensive Wistar group 117+/-3 mm Hg. L-arginine failed to reduce blood pressure, but simvastatin (118+/-1 mm Hg) and spironolactone (124+/-4 mm Hg) treatment significantly decreased the systolic blood pressure. In isolated phenylephrine-precontracted aortic rings from hHTG rats endothelium-dependent relaxation was diminished as compared to control Wistar rats. Of the three drugs used, only simvastatin improved acetylcholine-induced relaxation of the aorta. We conclude that both simvastatin and spironolactone reduced blood pressure but only simvastatin significantly improved endothelial dysfunction of aorta. Prominent increase in the expression of eNOS in large conduit arteries may be the pathophysiological mechanism underlying the protective effect of simvastatin in hHTG rats.",

Statins inhibit synthesis of mevalonate, a precursor of both cholesterol and coenzyme Q (CoQ). Inhibited biosynthesis of CoQ may be involved in some undesirable actions of statins. We investigated the effect of simvastatin on tissue CoQ concentrations in the rat model of NO-deficient hypertension induced by chronic L-NAME administration. Male Wistar rats were treated daily for 6 weeks with L-NAME (40 mg/kg) or with simvastatin (10 mg/kg), another group received simultaneously L-NAME and simvastatin in the same doses. Coenzyme Q(9) and Q(10) concentrations were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. L-NAME and simvastatin alone had no effect on CoQ concentrations. However, simultaneous application of L-NAME and simvastatin significantly decreased concentrations of both CoQ homologues in the left ventricle and slightly decreased CoQ(9) concentration in the skeletal muscle. No effect was observed on CoQ level in the liver and brain. We conclude that the administration of simvastatin under the condition of NO-deficiency reduced the level of CoQ in the heart and skeletal muscle what may participate in adverse effect of statins under certain clinical conditions.",

At the end of the 12th week fall in LDL-C at 31.4% for isapgol + atorvastatin was significantly greater than 22.8% among the atorvastatin group (p < 0.05). Serum total cholesterol, HDL-C and triglyceride were significantly lowered within the groups at 8th and 12th weeks but between groups, the difference was not significant.

Data were compared with that of patients with normal insulin or hyperinsulinemia. The patients with hyperinsulinemia receiving only pioglitazone showed a significant decrease in insulin levels compared with those with normal insulin levels. These patients also showed a significant increase in HDL levels. However, no significant change was observed in patients treated with both atorvastatin and pioglitazone. Pioglitazone was also found to increase significantly the apo A1 levels in patients with hyperinsulinemia, but there was no significant increase in patients given both atorvastatin and pioglitazone.

Animals were fed a high-cholesterol diet for 4 weeks followed by 4 (phase 1 and 2) or 12 weeks (phase 3) of drug treatment while on high-cholesterol diet. In phase 1, the dose-effect relationship of EP2306 on lipids and atherosclerosis was established, and its most effective dose was determined (2 mg/kg). This dose reduced significantly total cholesterol (512 +/- 96 mg/dl before versus 320 +/- 124 mg/dl after treatment, p < 0.05) and atherosclerotic lesions compared with control animals. In phase 2, the effects of 2 mg/kg EP2306, 2.5 mg/kg simvastatin, and their combination were assessed. Although no significant effect on lipid parameters was observed, there was a significant reduction (35 +/- 5%, p < 0.05) of atherosclerotic lesions in animals treated with EP2306, a similar reduction with simvastatin, and a further reduction (48 +/- 7%, p < 0.05) when the two agents were combined. In animals treated for 12 weeks with the drugs (phase 3), only EP2306 significantly reduced atherosclerotic lesions by more than 50%, whereas simvastatin alone or in combination with EP2306 had no effect. Treatment with EP2306 did not adversely affect liver transaminases or cause any histopathological changes on various organs of the animals. In conclusion, we have shown that EP2306 inhibits atherosclerosis in vivo, indicating potential as a novel therapeutic agent for coronary artery disease and other atherosclerosis-related disorders.",

    "157": "Tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha), a pivotal inflammatory cytokine, is known to induce proatherogenic changes in the lipid profile and may increase the cardiovascular risk of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We examined the effects of anti-TNF-alpha antibody (infliximab, IFX) compared with methotrexate (MTX) on lipid profiles in patients with RA.", 
    "158": "We selected retrospectively all patients with refractory RA (n = 32) who achieved a successful outcome (DAS-28 score < 2.6) in 6 months with IFX treatment, and control groups of age- and sex-matched patients with active RA treated with MTX and healthy participants. We traced fasting serum levels of total cholesterol (TCHO) and triglyceride (TG) for 6 months and used an online dual enzymatic method for simultaneous quantification of cholesterol (CHO) and TG by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).", 
    "159": "Mean C-reactive protein levels (baseline 4.5) fell to below 1 in 6 months. MTX treatment elevated and normalized TCHO and TG levels. IFX treatment, however, preferentially induced extra-high TG levels. HPLC analyses identified similar CHO profiles between patients treated with IFX or MTX, but IFX selectively induced a huge VLDL-TG peak. Statins successfully controlled these extra-high TG levels.", 
    "160": "In patients successfully treated with IFX or MTX, CHO levels were elevated and normalized, but IFX treatment preferentially induced extra-high levels of VLDL-TG. Thus, there is differential regulation of the lipid profile between IFX and MTX, necessitating careful attention to TG levels with IFX treatment.", 
    "161": "The current analyses evaluated the effect of atorvastatin on biomarkers of renal function. Serum creatinine level and markers of tubular and glomerular function, including cystatin C, urine N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase, urine and serum beta2-microglobulin, and urine albumin, were assessed in osteopenic postmenopausal women with mild dyslipidemia who received atorvastatin 20 mg, atorvastatin 80 mg, or placebo for 1 year. During the study, changes in serum creatinine levels were the same in all 3 treatment groups. Cystatin C levels remained unchanged in all groups at all time points. For the additional markers of renal function, median values at baseline and weeks 26 and 52 in both of the atorvastatin and the placebo groups were similar. Neither moderate- nor high-dose atorvastatin treatment for 1 year altered markers of glomerular and renal tubular function compared with placebo. These data indicate that in this patient population, atorvastatin, even at a high dose, does not interfere with renal tubular reabsorption of protein, induce renal tubular dysfunction, or alter glomerular filtration rate in humans.", 
    "162": "The localization of the TCR and other signaling molecules in membrane rafts (MR) is essential for the activation of T lymphocytes. MR are stabilized by sphingolipids and cholesterol. Activation of T lymphocytes leads to the confluence of small MR and the formation of an immunological synapse that is essential for sustained activation and proliferation. In this study, we investigated the effect of statins on MR and T cell activation in superantigen-stimulated human PBMC. Atorvastatin significantly inhibited cellular activation and proliferation. The binding of cholera toxin B subunit to isolated MR and to whole cells was inhibited by low doses of statins. Statins reduce the association of critical signaling proteins such as Lck and linker of activation in T cells with MR in stimulated T cells. The expression of activation markers CD69 and CD25 was inhibited. Several statin-mediated mechanisms, such as a lower stimulation with MHC-II, an inhibition of costimulation by direct binding of statins to LFA-1, a reduced secretion of cytokines, or a depletion of cellular cholesterol pools, were excluded. Inhibition of protein prenylation had a similar effect on T cell proliferation, suggesting that a reduced protein prenylation might contribute to the statin-mediated inhibition of T cell activation. Statins induce both lower levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and inhibition of T cell activation, which might contribute to an inhibition of atherosclerosis.", 
    "163": "Resistin, a recently discovered proinflammatory cytokine, has been variably associated with insulin resistance, inflammation, and renal dysfunction. We investigated the association of plasma resistin with estimated glomerular filtration rate and albuminuria in 1575 hypertensive adults without known coronary heart disease or stroke (857 blacks and 718 non-Hispanic whites). Resistin was measured by a solid phase sandwich immunoassay, estimated glomerular filtration rate was estimated from serum creatinine, and albuminuria was expressed as urine albumin:creatinine ratio. After adjustment for coronary heart disease risk factors (age, sex, body mass index, smoking history, systolic blood pressure, diabetes, and total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) and use of renin-angiotensin blockers and statins, higher plasma resistin levels were associated with lower estimated glomerular filtration rate in both ethnic groups (each P<0.0001); the association remained significant after further adjustment for a marker of insulin resistance (homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance) and a marker of inflammation (plasma C-reactive protein) and was seen in subjects with and without diabetes (each P<0.0001) in both ethnic groups. Higher plasma resistin levels were associated with a higher urine albumin:creatinine ratio in black subjects with diabetes (P<0.0001) and non-Hispanic white subjects with diabetes (P=0.032), independent of coronary heart disease risk factors, hypertension medication use, and statin use; the association remained significant after additional adjustment for homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance and C-reactive protein. In adults with hypertension, higher circulating resistin levels were associated with a lower estimated glomerular filtration rate and with increased urine albumin:creatinine ratio in the presence of concomitant diabetes. This association was independent of coronary heart disease risk factors and markers of insulin resistance and inflammation.",

We prospectively examined the extent to which specific drugs and drug combinations were continued over time by reviewing medication use at the time of hospital discharge and after 2 years. The results were used to estimate the expected loss in preventive efficacy due to discontinuation of therapy.", 
    "167": "The changes over a 2 year period in the proportions of patients taking each drug class were as follows: 15% reduction for aspirin (95% CI, -21 to -9), 10% reduction for statins (95% CI, -16 to -5), 19% reduction for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (95% CI, -26 to -12), 12% reduction for beta-blockers (95% CI, -18 to -6), 0% increase for calcium-channel blockers (95% CI, -5 to 6), 2% increase for thiazides (95% CI, -2 to 6), and 12% increase for angiotensin-II receptor blockers (95% CI, 6 to 18). The combination of aspirin, statin, and at least 2 blood pressure lowering drugs was prescribed to 81% of patients, three-quarters of whom remained on this combination after 2 years. The overall expected preventive effect on CHD of the combined medication taken during hospitalization and after 2 years was 80% and 74%, respectively.",

Aspects of clinical care assessed included: risk factor recording (smoking, cholesterol, blood pressure, body mass index); secondary prevention (aspirin, beta-blocker, statin); cardiac investigation (exercise ECG, perfusion scanning, angiography); and revascularisation (percutaneous coronary intervention, coronary artery bypass grafting). Male-to-female adjusted odds ratios (AOR) were calculated (adjusted for age, angina duration, age at diagnosis and previous MI) using logistic regression.", 
    "171": "1,162 patients (610 men; 552 women) with angina were identified. Women were older than men (71 vs 67 years), with a shorter duration of angina (6 vs 7 years), and a lower prevalence of previous MI (25% vs 43%). Men were significantly more likely than women to undergo detailed risk factor assessment (AOR = 1.35, 95%CI 1.06 to 1.73); receive 'triple' secondary prevention with aspirin, beta-blockers and statins (AOR = 1.47, 95%CI 1.07 to 2.02); access exercise ECG testing (AOR = 1.31, 95%CI 1.02 to 1.68); angiography (AOR = 1.61, 95%CI 1.23 to 2.12); and undergo coronary revascularisation (AOR = 1.93, 95%CI 1.39 to 2.68).",

All patients remained symptomatic for more than 1 year after drug withdrawal, or required drugs for inflammatory myopathy. Data on the patient's exposure to LLDs and to other drugs were compared with that of matched controls (5/1) selected through the Midi-Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es Health Insurance System database.",

Of those, 21 (56.8%) suffered from dermatomyositis (DM) or polymyositis (PM), 12 (32.4%) from genetic myopathy, and 4 (10.8%) from an unclassified disease. The prevalence of exposure to statins was 40.5% in patients and 20% in controls (odds ratio (OR) 2.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.21-6.14; p<0.01). There was a significant positive interaction between statins and proton pump inhibitors exposure (weighted OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.37-7.54; p = 0.02). Statin exposure rate was 47.6% among patients with DM/PM (OR 3.86, 95% CI 1.30-11.57; p<0.01). There was no difference between patients and controls for exposure to fibrates.",

    "177": "The engulfing ability of phagocyting cells is related to the fluidity of the cell membrane that in turn depends on its chemical composition. Changes in membranal lipid content may increase or decrease membranal fluidity with a subsequent enhanced or impaired phagocytosis, respectively. Statins are recognized as potent inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis and therefore, are successfully administered to patients with hypercholesterolemia. Since it is considered that cholesterol affects cell function via changes in membrane composition, the present study was designed to examine the in vitro effect of three hydrophobic statins--atorvastatin, lovastatin and simvastatin, and a hydrophilic one--pravastatin, on the engulfing capacity, phagocytic index and apoptosis of peripheral blood phagocytes from healthy volunteers. Peripheral white blood cells obtained from 20 healthy normocholesterolemic individuals were incubated for 2h with 10 and 50 microM of the four statins and phagocytosis of fluorescent latex particles was detected by flow cytometry. Apoptosis was examined using annexin V and propidium iodide staining. An increase in the percentage of phagocyting cells was observed after incubation with 50 microM of lovastatin and simvastatin. On the other hand, all three hydrophobic statins induced a dose-dependent increase in the phagocytic index. The hydrophilic pravastatin did not affect phagocytosis, phagocytic index and apoptosis. All three hydrophobic statins at 50 microM exerted a slight, but significant decrease of apoptosis. The results suggest that the effect of hydrophobic statins on the engulfing capacity of human peripheral blood phagocytes and apoptosis is dependent on their dosage and physiochemical properties. This observation is an additional contribution to the statins' pleiotropic effect.", 
    "178": "During the last decade, the evidence of beneficial effects of cholesterol lowering in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) has been proven in several clinical trials. This has prompted international guidelines on prevention of CHD to include recommendations on dietary and pharmacological treatment of hyperlipidaemia with set goals on total- and LDL-cholesterol.", 
    "179": "The first EUROASPIRE survey performed in 1995/1996 showed poor adherence to the European recommendations on lipid-lowering in patients with CHD. The second survey was carried out in 1999/2000 in 15 European countries and enrolled 8181 patients with CHD. Medical records were assessed and clinical examinations of risk factors including serum lipids were performed. The aim of this survey is to describe the treatment of hyperlipidaemia among CHD patients in Europe.", 
    "180": "The proportion of patients not reaching the target of 5.0mmol/l was 58.3% with significant variations between countries. The use of lipid-lowering drugs was relatively high (60.9%). However, the most frequently used doses of lipid-lowering agents were much lower than the doses of proven effect used in clinical trials.", 
    "181": "Although the treatment of hyperlipidaemia in CHD patients seems to be improving as compared to the first survey, a significant number of patients do not reach treatment goals. If the full potential of lipid-lowering therapy was utilised with all eligible patients treated and doses titrated correctly, more patients would benefit in terms of reduced morbidity and mortality of CHD.", 
    "182": "Markers of inflammation such as high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) were shown to be elevated in patients with hypertension. Small trials using statin therapy showed blood-pressure (BP) reductions, but it is unknown whether this association extends to larger populations. The objective of this study was to determine whether statin use was associated with better blood-pressure control in adults with hypertension and whether inflammation levels mediated this relationship.", 
    "183": "This was a cross-sectional study of 2584 hypertensive adults aged >or=40 years with no known cardiovascular disease from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2002.

C-reactive protein was added to the full model to determine its impact on the association.", 
    "184": "Compared with people not using statin medication, significantly more statin users had their blood pressure under control (52.2% v 38.0%). After adjustment for demographic factors, statin users were two times (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.46 to 2.72) more likely to have their blood pressure under control (<140/90 mm Hg) than nonusers. After further adjustment for body mass index, diabetes, smoking, exercise, low-salt diet, and antihypertensive medications, the likelihood of having blood pressure under control remained more likely among statin users (odds ratio, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.05 to 2.05). The association between statin use and lower BP was most evident among participants who used antihypertensive medication as well as statins and was unchanged with the addition of CRP to the model.", 
    "185": "Statin use was associated with a BP level <140/90 mm Hg in a representative sample of US adults with hypertension. Levels of CRP did not attenuate the association. Further studies are needed to explore the effects of statin use on blood pressure and to determine how best to apply this knowledge in clinical care.", 
    "186": "An extraordinarily potent and hepatoselective class of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors containing a pyrazole core was recently reported; however, its development was hampered by a long and difficult synthetic route. We attempted to circumvent this obstacle by preparing closely related analogs wherein the key dihydroxyheptanoic acid sidechain was tethered to the pyrazole core via an oxygen linker ('oxypyrazoles'). This minor change reduced the total number of synthetic steps from 14 to 7. Although the resulting analogs maintained much of the in vitro and cell activity of the pyrazoles, inferior in vivo activity precluded further development. Caco-2 cell permeability data suggest that enhanced cellular efflux of the oxypyrazoles relative to the pyrazoles may be responsible for the poor in vivo activity.",

The present study of patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) undergoing endovascular repair (EVAR) assessed the relationships between baseline hemoglobin concentration and AAA size, as well as anemia and long-term survival.", 
    "188": "Between March 1994 and November 2006, 711 patients (65 women, mean age 75.8 +/- 7.8 years) underwent elective EVAR. Anemia was defined as a hemoglobin level <13 g/dL in men and <12 g/dL in women. Post-EVAR mean follow-up was 48.3 +/- 32.0 months. Association of hemoglobin level with AAA size was assessed with multiple linear regression. Mortality was determined with use of the internet-based Social Security Death Index and the electronic hospital record. Kaplan-Meier survival curves of anemic and nonanemic patient groups were compared by the log-rank method. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to determine the influence of anemia on vital status after EVAR.", 
    "189": "A total of 218/711 (30.7%) of AAA patients undergoing EVAR had anemia at baseline. After adjustment for various risk factors, hemoglobin level was inversely related to maximum AAA diameter (beta: - .144, 95%-CI: -1.482 - .322, P = .002). Post-EVAR survival was 65.5% at 5 years and 44.4% at 10 years. In long-term follow-up, survival was significantly lower in patients with anemia as compared to patients without anemia (P < .0001 by log-rank). Baseline hemoglobin levels were independently related to long-term mortality in multivariable Cox regression analysis adjusted for various risk factors (adjusted HR: 0.866, 95% CI: .783 to .958, P = .005). Within this model, statin use (adjusted HR: .517, 95% CI: .308 to .868, P = .013) was independently related to long-term survival, whereas baseline AAA diameter (adjusted HR: 1.022, 95% CI: 1.009 to 1.036, P = .001) was an independently associated with increased mortality.", 
    "190": "Baseline hemoglobin concentration is independently associated with AAA size and reduced long-term survival following EVAR. Thus, the presence or absence of anemia offers a potential refinement of existing risk stratification instruments."
