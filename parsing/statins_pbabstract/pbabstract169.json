Global gene expression profiles of prostate tumor cells and matching normal epithelial cells were compared between patients with features of normal and high BMI at the time of radical prostatectomy. Knowledge-based analyses revealed an association of high BMI with altered levels of lipid metabolism and cholesterol homeostasis genes, such as stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) and insulin-induced gene 1 (INSIG1), respectively, in prostate tumor cells. These genes were connected to known pathways of tumorigenesis revealed by the v-maf (musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma) oncogene homolog (MAF), notch receptor ligand, jagged 1 (JAG1) and the alanyl aminopeptidase (ANPEP/CD13) genes. This study highlighted that SCD1, a known target of statins, may have a mechanistic role in the recently noted beneficial effects of statin treatment in reducing biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer. An additional finding of our study is that some of the obesity-related genes were upregulated in tumor-matched normal cells within the high BMI group, when compared with normal cells within the normal BMI cohort.", 
    "1": "Individuals with chronic renal disease (CKD) are prone to have accelerated process of atherosclerosis. Importantly, cardiovascular disease is the main cause of morbidity and mortality in kidney transplant recipients. Recent studies suggest a potential benefit of the lipid lowering medica-tions in preventing cardiovascular events in the CKD and the transplant populations. In particular, statin was shown to be effective in reducing low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol. However, refractory dyslipidemia and difficulty in lowering LDL to target were reported with the CKD and the kidney transplant patients. The second United Kingdom Heart and Renal protection study (UK-HARP-II) showed that the addition of ezetimibe to simvastatin was safe and effective in treating dyslipidemia in CKD. Furthermore, the combination of ezetimibe and statin was also effective and safe in treating dyslipidemia in kidney transplant recipients. The Study of Heart and Renal Pro-tection (SHARP) trial will evaluate the effects of lowering LDL-C with ezetimibe 10 mg and simvastatin 20 mg daily versus placebo in 9,000 patients with chronic kidney disease. The current evidence suggests that the addition of ezetimibe to satin is effective and safe in treating dyslipidemia in the CKD and the kidney transplant patients. Future clinical trials are needed to determine whether ezetimibe will reduce cardiovascular risk in the CKD patients.",

The average follow-up BP (systolic and diastolic) was categorized into 10-mm Hg increments. The primary outcome was a composite of death due to any cause, myocardial infarction, unstable angina requiring rehospitalization, revascularization after 30 days, and stroke. The secondary outcome was a composite of death due to coronary heart disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or revascularization. The relationship between BP (systolic or diastolic) followed a J- or U-shaped curve association with primary, secondary, and individual outcomes, with increased events rates at both low and high BP values, both unadjusted and after adjustment for baseline variables, baseline C-reactive protein, and on-treatment average levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. A nonlinear Cox proportional hazards model showed a nadir of 136/85 mm Hg (range 130 to 140 mm Hg systolic and 80 to 90 mm Hg diastolic) at which the incidence of primary outcome was lowest. The curve was relatively flat for systolic pressures of 110 to 130 mm Hg and diastolic pressures of 70 to 90 mm Hg.",

    "6": "Prostate cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer-associated death among men in the United States. There has been renewed interest in the potential therapeutic benefits of statins for cancer. Simvastatin, a widely used generic drug for preventing cardiovascular events, is well known for its effects on cellular proliferation and inflammation, two key processes that also determine the rate of tumor growth. Although a growing body of evidence suggests that statins have the potential to reduce the risk of many cancers, there are discrepancies over the pro- and anticancer effects of statins. In the current study, we sought to investigate the effects of simvastatin on the Akt pathway in prostate cancer cells with respect to the regulation of various cell functions in vitro and tumor growth in vivo. Time- and dose-dependent effects of simvastatin on LNCaP (androgen-dependent) and PC3 (androgen-independent) cells indicate that treatment with simvastatin at concentrations as low as 25 \u03bcM was sufficient to inhibit serum-stimulated Akt activity. Akin to this, treatment with simvastatin significantly inhibited serum-induced cell migration, invasion, colony formation, and proliferation. Simvastatin-mediated effects on colony formation were rescued by adenovirus-mediated expression of constitutively active Akt (myristoylated Akt) in PC3 cell lines. A PC3 xenograft model performed in nude mice exhibited reduced tumor growth with simvastatin treatment associated with decreased Akt activity and reduced prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels. Our findings demonstrate the therapeutic benefits of simvastatin for prostate cancer and suggest a link between simvastatin, regulation of Akt activity, and PSA expression in prostate tumors.",

The evidence for increasing low levels of HDL-C is sparse, and the available data are confounded by metabolic interactions between elevated very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and LDL particle concentrations. Despite these limitations, there has been widespread interest in novel strategies that target HDL. One such path has been the development of recombinant HDL formulations that mimic the pre-beta fraction of native HDL, which is the main HDL subclass that mediates cholesterol efflux from lipid-laden macrophages. Various recombinant HDL formulations (apolipoprotein A-1 [apoA-1]-bound phospholipid disks or delipidated HDL particles, mutant apoA-1 proteins, and apoA-1 mimetic peptides) have been investigated in animal studies and some human trials. However, these HDL-modifying therapies require evaluation in clinical trials of atherosclerosis and CVD events.

Understanding the signaling pathways involved in the regulation of autophagy represents a new direction in the development of anticancer therapies. Our recent studies investigate the role of autophagy in the anticancer effects of statins and histone deacetylase: inhibitors (HDACi). Inhibition of autophagy enhances the efficacy of statins, whereas autophagic cell death in cancer cells is induced by HDACi. Here, we will discuss the differential signaling pathways elicited by statins and HDACi.

Recent animal experiments and clinical trials suggest that statin use may limit the development of sepsis and associated systemic inflammation. The aim of this study was to explore the potential role of statins in the prevention treatment of sepsis-induced acute lung injury (ALI). Mice were rendered septic by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). An intraperitoneal injection of 3 mg/kg per day of pitavastatin was initiated 4 days before surgery and was maintained for life support afterward, which significantly improved the survival of CLP mice. Treatment with pitavastatin prevented the ALI development in CLP mice, as indicated by the findings that severe hypoxemia, increased pulmonary vascular permeability, and histological lung damage, including inflammatory cell infiltrate, were greatly remedied. This was associated with down-regulation of increased activity of nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) in septic lungs. Although plasma cortisol showed a sharp rise, glucocorticoid receptor (GCR) expression in the lungs was strikingly reduced after the onset of CLP-induced sepsis. It is noteworthy that pitavastatin increased GCR expression with an increase in alveolar macrophages in which GCRs are localized, without modifying the sepsis-associated rise in plasma cortisol. These results confirm significant protection by pitavastatin on septic ALI and demonstrate that down-regulated NF-\u03baB activation associated with the GCR expression increase consequent to the increased number of alveolar macrophages may explain, in part, the mechanisms responsible for favorable effects of statins on the ALI management.", 
    "31": "The chemical conversion of simvastatin from the lactone (SVL) to the hydroxyacid (SVA) form is becoming an intriguing issue associated with the pharmacological use of SVL. On this matter, recent findings suggest that SVL complexation with cyclodextrins (CDs) may be a useful strategy to affect its aqueous solubility and chemical stability. In this work, a reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) method able to selectively identify and quantify SVL and SVA has been set up, validated and applied to follow SVL hydrolysis in the presence of HP\u03b2CD. The combination of stability results with simvastatin/HP\u03b2CD stability constants achieved from UV-vis measurements and solubility/dissolution studies allowed to get an insight into SVL/HP\u03b2CD, SVA/HP\u03b2CD and SVL/SVA equilibria taking place in aqueous solution. Results show that in the presence of HP\u03b2CD the aqueous SVL/SVA equilibrium is shifted versus the hydroxyacid form. UV-vis results, showing that the lactone and the open-ring form of simvastatin interact with HP\u03b2CD in a similar extent, suggest that hydrolysis occurs also on SVL/HP\u03b2CD complex, thus supporting a mode of interaction that does not involve the lactone ring. This hypothesis is strengthened by NMR analysis performed on SVA, HP\u03b2CD and their inclusion complex, which indicates that the lactone ring is not included in HP\u03b2CD hydrophobic cavity. Finally, results suggest that particular attention must be paid to SVL lactonization in aqueous solution when using CD-based formulations and in demonstrating their effective benefit for a specific therapeutic use.", 
    "32": "The influence of various combinations of glycerol and lactose feed on the biosynthesis of two polyketide metabolites, lovastatin and (+)-geodin, by Aspergillus terreus ATCC20542 in a discontinuous fed-batch culture was presented. In these experiments lactose and/or glycerol were also used as the initial carbon substrates in the cultivation media. The application of glycerol feed, when lactose is the initial substrate, leads to the appreciable lovastatin concentration in the broth (122.4 mg l\u207b\u00b9), nevertheless the abundant (+)-geodin level is at the same time obtained (255.5 mg l\u207b\u00b9). The cultures with glycerol as the initial substrate and fed with lactose produce less lovastatin and (+)-geodin. The application of the various combined glycerol and/or lactose feeds allows for improving lovastatin production up to 161.8 mg l\u207b\u00b9 and decreases (+)-geodin concentration to 98.7 mg l\u207b\u00b9. The analysis of product formation rates and yield coefficients indicates that lovastatin is more efficiently produced on lactose, especially in the initial stages of the cultivation. Glycerol efficiently sustains fungal activity to form these polyketides in the late idiophase but it mainly favours (+)-geodin formation, if solely used in the feed. The feeds performed both with lactose and glycerol occur to be the most desired to maximise lovastatin and minimise (+)-geodin formation.",

The role of gender in that controversy is unclear. We evaluated the gender-specific effect of statins on the rate of functional decline in patients with ALS, based on data retrieved from the medical records of all ALS patients who participated in two previously reported clinical trials on the efficacy of topiramate and of celecoxib in ALS. The topiramate trial enrolled 294 patients, 28 (9.5%) of whom were statin users (20 males). The celecoxib trial enrolled 300 patients, 25 (8.3%) of whom were statin users (17 males). Statins had no effect on the functional decline in the celecoxib trial, but they did have a negative impact on disease course in the topiramate trial. When males and females were analyzed separately, the functional decline of females taking statins was significantly greater than that of males in both trials. Our results indicate that statins affect possibly negatively ALS progression among females but not males. They emphasize the need to consider gender in future analyses of drug effects.",

Although statins are known to decrease the levels and activity of circulating and plaque Lp-PLA(2) during atherosclerosis, little is known regarding the mechanisms underlying inhibition of Lp-PLA(2) by statins. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the molecular mechanisms responsible for inhibition of Lp-PLA(2) by statins. Our results showed that treatment with simvastatin inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced increases in Lp-PLA(2) expression and secreted activity in human monocyte\u2013derived macrophages in a dose- and time-dependent manner. These effects could be reversed by treatment with mevalonate or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), but not by treatment with squalene or farnesyl pyrophosphate. Treatment with the Rho inhibitor C3 exoenzyme also inhibited LPS-induced increases in Lp-PLA(2) expression and secreted activity, mimicking the effects of simvastatin. In addition, treatment with simvastatin blocked LPS-induced activation of RhoA, which could be abolished by treatment with GGPP. Inhibition of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), but not extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2 or Jun N-terminal kinase, suppressed LPS-induced increases in Lp-PLA(2) expression and secreted activity, similar to the effects of simvastatin. Treatment of human monocyte\u2013derived macrophages with either simvastatin or C3 exoenzyme prevented LPS-induced activation of p38 MAPK, which could be abolished by treatment with GGPP. Together, these results suggest that simvastatin reduces Lp-PLA(2) expression and secreted activity in LPS-stimulated human monocyte\u2013derived macrophages through the inhibition of the mevalonate\u2013GGPP\u2013RhoA-p38 MAPK pathway. These observations provide novel evidence that statins have pleiotropic effects and suggest that inhibition of Lp-PLA(2) via this mechanism may account, at least in part, for the clinical benefit of statins in combating atherosclerosis.", 
    "52": "Baseline coronary artery calcification (CAC) accurately identifies coronary atherosclerosis and might improve prediction of future cardiac events. Serial assessment of CAC scores has been proposed for monitoring atherosclerosis progression and for assessing the effectiveness of medical therapies aimed at reducing cardiac risk. However, whether knowledge of progression of CAC scores over time further improves risk prediction is unclear. Several trials relating medical therapies to CAC progression have been performed without any formal guidelines on the definition of CAC progression and how it is best quantified. We conducted a comprehensive review of published reports on CAC progression. Increased CAC progression is associated with many known cardiac risk factors. We found that CAC progression correlates with worsening atherosclerosis and may facilitate prediction of future cardiac events. These findings support the notion that slowing CAC progression with therapeutic interventions might provide prognostic benefit. However, despite promising early data, such interventions (most notably with statin therapy) have not been shown to slow the progression of CAC in any randomized controlled trial to date, outside of post hoc subgroup analyses.

Although neurological symptoms are common in the affected individuals, the mechanisms of brain damage are poorly known. In the present study we investigated the in vitro effect MGA, MGT and OHIVA, at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 5.0mM, on bioenergetics and oxidative stress in synaptosomal preparations isolated from cerebral cortex of young rats. MGA significantly reduced mitochondrial redox potential (25%), as determined by resazurin reduction, and inhibited the activity of Na(+),K(+)-ATPase (30%), whereas MGT and OHIVA did not modify these parameters. Moreover, the inhibitory effect elicited by MGA on Na(+),K(+)-ATPase activity was totally prevented by co-incubation with the scavenging antioxidants creatine and melatonin, implying a role for reactive species in this effect. MGA also increased 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein (DCFH) oxidation (30%), reinforcing that this organic acid induces reactive species production. The present data indicate that MGA compromises mitochondrial function, elicits reactive species production and inhibits the activity of a crucial enzyme implicated in neurotransmission. It is therefore presumed that these deleterious effects may play a role in the pathophysiology of the brain damage observed in patients affected by disorders in which MGA accumulates.",

Many trials have established the role of statins in the prevention of cardiovascular mortality, not only by decreasing the low density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels but also by their pleotropic effects. These data from the general population may not be applicable to RTRs as these patients have different cardiovascular risk profiles. Till date, only a few prospective, randomized trials have assessed the use of statins in RTRs with regards to cardiovascular outcomes. The Assessment of Lescol in Renal Transplant trial, the largest trial so far, suggested that dyslipidemia management with statins in RTRs is associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of cardiac death and nonfatal myocardial infarction (although differences in the combined primary end point were not statistically significant). The current guidelines from National Kidney Foundation for managing dyslipidemia in RTRs recommend managing all chronic kidney disease patients as a coronary heart disease equivalent. The task group for drafting these guidelines concluded that based on the currently available evidence, additional studies may be needed in RTRs to confirm and extend the results of Assessment of Lescol in Renal Transplant trial.",

The objective of this study was to determine whether fluvastatin prevents the APR to zoledronic acid in post-menopausal women. A double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study was conducted in 60 healthy, post-menopausal, female volunteers (mean age 60.6 \u00b1 4.0). Volunteers received 5 mg zoledronic acid by intravenous infusion, and either three times 40 mg fluvastatin (0 hr, 24 hr and 48 hr), 40 mg fluvastatin (0 hr) plus placebo (24 hr and 48 hr), or placebo (0 hr, 24 hr and 48 hr), orally. Post-infusion symptoms were assessed by questionnaire. Changes in \u03b3\u03b4 T cell levels, pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF\u03b1, IFN\u03b3, IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured in peripheral blood at various time-points post-infusion.

Zoledronic acid also induced a transient fall in circulating V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cell levels at 48 hr, consistent with V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cell activation. Concurrent fluvastatin administration did not prevent zoledronic acid-induced cytokine release, alter circulating V\u03b39V\u03b42 T cell levels, nor diminish the frequency or severity of APR symptoms. In conclusion, intravenous zoledronic acid induced pro-inflammatory cytokine release and APR symptoms in the majority of study participants, which was not prevented by co-administration of fluvastatin.",

Statins have been shown to lower low-density lipoproteins and CRP independently, and reduce cardiovascular events in subjects with and without metabolic syndrome and hypertension. In this review, we focus on the results from the primary prevention statin trial, Justification for the Use of statins in Primary prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER), which showed reductions in LDL, CRP, and cardiovascular events.

A number of mutations in the human TIE2 gene have been identified in patients suffering from cutaneomucosal venous malformations and ventricular septal defects. How exactly Tie-2 signaling pathways play different roles in both vascular development and vascular stability is unknown. We have generated a zebrafish line carrying a stop mutation in the kinase domain of the Tie-2 receptor. Mutant embryos lack Tie-2 protein, but do not display any defect in heart and vessel development. Simultaneous loss of Tie-1 and Tie-2, however, leads to a cardiac phenotype. Our study shows that Tie-1 and Tie-2 are not required for early heart development, yet they have redundant roles for the maintenance of endocardial-myocardial connection in later stages. Tie-2 and its ligand Angiopoietin-1 have also been reported to play an important role in vessel stability. We used atorvastatin and simvastatin, drugs that cause bleeding in wild-type zebrafish larvae, to challenge vessel stability in tie-2 mutants. Interestingly, recent clinical studies have reported hemorrhagic stroke as a side effect of atorvastatin treatment. Exposure of embryos to statins revealed that tie-2 mutants are significantly protected from statin-induced bleeding. Furthermore, tie-2 mutants became less resistant to bleeding after VE-cadherin knockdown. Taken together, these data show that atorvastatin affects vessel stability through Tie-2, and that VE-cadherin and Tie-2 act in concert to allow vessel remodeling while playing a role in vessel stability. Our study introduces an additional vertebrate model to study in vivo the function of Tie-2 in development and disease.",

    "92": "Hypercholesterolemia is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases that has been managed mostly with 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) that suppress de novo cholesterol synthesis in the liver. Statins also have beneficial pleiotropic effects on the atherosclerotic process that are independent of their ability to lower lipid values. However, the levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in most hypercholesterolemic patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease do not reach the goals proposed by guidelines even when prescribed with statins. Ezetimibe is a new lipid-lowering agent that blocks the intestinal absorption of dietary and biliary cholesterol and reduces LDL-C levels, especially when combined with statins. However, its effect on cardiovascular events remains unknown. We reviewed the effects of ezetimibe on cardiovascular diseases, in particular, vascular endothelial function, which is initially impaired during the atherogenetic process and is an important predictor of cardiovascular events. The simultaneous inhibition of cholesterol synthesis by statin and of cholesterol absorption by ezetimibe might retard the atherogenetic process. These effects are considered to be mainly mediated by lipid lowering. However, further studies should elucidate the mechanism of the anti-atherosclerotic effects induced by ezetimibe; for instance, whether or not it directly affects atherogenesis independently from its lipid-lowering effects.", 
    "93": "Ezetimibe is a potent inhibitor of cholesterol absorption that has been approved for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Statin, 3-hydroxy-3 methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, is an inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis. Statin is the first-choice drug to reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol for patients with hypercholesterolemia, due to its strong effect to lower the circulating LDL-cholesterol levels. Because a high dose of statins causes concern about rhabdomyolysis, it is sometimes difficult to achieve the guideline-recommended levels of LDL-cholesterol in patients with high LDL-cholesterol treated with statin monotherapy. Ezetimibe has been reported to reduce LDL-cholesterol safely with both monotherapy and combination therapy with statins. Ezetimibe is especially expected to be the best pharmacological option for the treatment of patients unable to achieve LDL-cholesterol goals with statins. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are produced at low levels to maintain physiological redox balance. Oxidative stress results when ROS production exceeds the ability of cells to detoxify ROS. Overproduction of ROS damages cellular components, including lipids, leading to decline in physiological function and cell death. Oxidative stress exacerbates atherosclerosis, the major risk factor for coronary artery disease and ischemic stroke, at every step involves the accumulation of oxidized LDL in the arteries, leading to foam cell formation, plaque development, and plaque rupture. This review focuses on the recent findings of ezetimibe-related atheroprotective effects in vasculature. Moreover, known and proposed mechanisms of how ezetimibe could improve ROS-induced pro-atherosclerotic conditions in vasculature are discussed; these effects may help to explain the mechanisms by which ezetimibe may protect vascular from atherosclerosis.", 
    "94": "Atherosclerosis is an inflammation-based complex vascular disorder which causes coronary artery disease, stroke and peripheral artery disease. Its pathophysiological process consists of endothelial dysfunction, monocyte adhesion to endothelial cells, lipid and inflammatory cell accumulation in the vascular wall, and migration and proliferation of smooth muscle cells. Both hyperlipidemia and inflammation are profoundly involved in each step. Cholesterol lowering by HMG-CoA reductase (statin) is beneficial for treating atherosclerotic coronary artery disease and stroke, together with reducing a surrogate-marker of inflammation, C-reactive protein (CRP). Another recently established cholesterol lowering tool using an intestinal cholesterol absorption inhibitor, ezetimibe, has been applied for clinical treatment of hypercholesterolemia for several reasons. First, hypercholesterolemia is associated with increased intestinal cholesterol absorption. Second, low cholesterol absorption prevents cardiovascular events. Third, cholesterol metabolism analysis provides evidence that the long-term use of statin increases cholesterol absorption. In terms of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and CRP reductions, the more powerful effect of ezetimibe has been seen when the agent is combined with statins. However, the effect of ezetimibe monotherapy on CRP reduction has not been well defined. This review provides information on recently described clinical trials of ezetimibe monotherapy, stain monotherapy, and combined therapy for LDL-C lowering and vascular inflammation.",

The authors hypothesized that atorvastatin would attenuate hypercholesterolemia-induced lesion in lung. Fifteen rabbits were randomly divided into control group, high-cholesterol forage group, and atrovastatin treatment group. Body weight and blood lipid were measured. All lung tissue and pulmonary arteries were collected for histopathology and immunohistochemistry. Alveolar macrophages (AMs) were cultured and activation of nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB was detected.

Among the statins, Simvastatin is one of the most frequently prescribed statins because of its efficacy in reducing LDL lipoprotein cholesterol levels, its tolerability, and its reduction of cardiovascular risk and mortality. Conflicting results have been reported with regard to benefits (pleiotropic effects) as well as risks (adverse effects) of simvastatin on different soft and hard tissues. In the current study, Attenuated Total Reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy was used to obtain detailed information about protein conformational changes due to simvastatin therapy of soft tissues namely liver, testis, sciatic nerve and hard tissues such as femur and tibia. Protein secondary structural changes were predicted by intensity calculations from second derivative spectra and neural network (NN) analysis, using the amide I band (1700-1600 cm(-1)) of FTIR spectra. Moreover, based on protein secondary structural differences, hierarchical cluster analysis was carried out in the 1700-1600 cm(-1) region. The results of our study in liver, testis and sciatic nerve tissues revealed that simvastatin treatment significantly decreased alpha helix structure and beta sheet structure at 1638 cm(-1), while increased the anti-parallel and aggregated beta sheet and random coil structures implying a simvastatin-induced protein denaturation in treated groups. Different to soft tissues, the results of hard tissue studies on femur and tibia bones revealed increased alpha helix structure and decreased anti-parallel beta sheet, aggregated beta sheet and random coil structures implying more strengthened bone tissues in simvastatin-treated groups. Finally, the simvastatin-treated and control groups for all soft and bone tissues were successfully differentiated using cluster analysis. According to the heterogeneity values in the cluster analysis of these tissues, the sciatic nerve tissue was found to be the most affected tissue from simvastatin treatment among the studied soft tissues. In addition, the high heterogeneity value implied high secondary structural difference between control and simvastatin-treated groups in tibia bone tissues. These findings reveal that FTIR spectroscopy with bioinformatic analyses such as neural network and hierarchical clustering, allowed us to determine the simvastatin-induced protein conformational changes as adverse and pleiotropic effects of the drug on different soft and hard tissues.",

Recently, statins have been extensively investigated as potential therapeutic agents capable of slowing the progression of vascular and valvular calcification. However, accumulating recent evidences show that there are conflicting data regarding beneficial effects of statins on progression of cardiovascular calcification. In particular, regarding coronary artery calcification, which is shown to can predict coronary events, it still remains unclear and controversial. To address the positioning of statins as therapeutic strategy for cardiovascular calcification more clearly, clinical studies by intensive therapy using statins throughout long-term period is indispensable in near future. In addition, future investigation about the detailed molecular mechanisms how statins affect calcification process in vascular cells is necessary.",

The prospective Vascular Protection and Guideline Orientated Approach to Lipid Lowering Registries recruited 7,357 high-risk vascular outpatients in Canada from 2001 to 2004. We stratified the patient population into 3 groups according to their BMI: normal weight (BMI <24.9 kg/m\u00b2), overweight (BMI 25 to 29.9 kg/m\u00b2), and obese (BMI >30 kg/m\u00b2). We evaluated the rates of attainment for contemporary guideline targets of blood pressure (<140/90 or <130/80 mm Hg in the presence of diabetes) and lipids (low-density lipoprotein [LDL] <2.5 mmol/L [96.7 mg/dl] and total cholesterol [TC]/high-density lipoprotein [HDL] ratio <4.0). Of the 7,357 patients, 1,305 (17.7%) were normal weight, 2,791 (37.9%) overweight, and 3,261 (44.4%) obese, as determined by the BMI. Obese patients were younger and more likely to have hypertension and diabetes (all p <0.001 for trend). Obese patients had higher baseline blood pressure, TC, LDL cholesterol, triglyceride levels and TC/HDL ratio, and lower HDL cholesterol. Obese patients were more likely to be treated with antihypertensive agents (p = 0.002), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (p = 0.024), angiotensin receptor blockers (p <0.001), and high-dose statin therapy (p = 0.001).

Follow-up low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was not significantly different between the progression and regression groups (85 \u00b1 30 vs 82 \u00b1 24 mg/dl, p = 0.6). Baseline percent necrotic core (NC) area was significantly larger (26.1 \u00b1 10.9% vs 17.6 \u00b1 10.8%, p = 0.004) and baseline percent fibrofatty area was significantly smaller (8.1 \u00b1 6.2% vs 14.2 \u00b1 12.1%, p = 0.008) at the MLA site in the progression group compared to the regression group. Thin-cap fibroatheroma was observed more frequently in the progression group compared to the regression group (32% vs 9%, p = 0.020). Change of plaque plus media area from baseline to follow-up at the MLA site correlated with baseline percent NC area (r = 0.375, p = 0.002), baseline percent fibrofatty area (r = -0.388, p = 0.001), and baseline percent fibrotic area (r = -0.242, p = 0.050). Baseline percent NC area at the MLA site was an independent predictor of plaque progression at follow-up (odds ratio 1.265, 95% confidence interval 1.069 to 1.497, p = 0.006).

No difference was observed between the \u03b2-blocker and no-\u03b2-blocker groups in mortality (6.6% vs 6.6%, p = 0.85; propensity score adjusted hazard ratio 1.10, 95% confidence interval 0.64 to 1.90, p = 0.70) or in incidence of major adverse cardiac events (all-cause death, recurrent myocardial infarction, and heart failure hospitalization, 13.5% vs 12.1%, p = 0.91; hazard ratio 1.13, 95% confidence interval 0.76 to 1.66, p = 0.53). Better outcomes were observed in the \u03b2-blocker group than in the no-\u03b2-blocker group in a subgroup of patients with LVEF \u226440% (n = 125, death 6.4% vs 17.4%, p = 0.04; major adverse cardiac events 14.5% vs 31.8%, p = 0.009). In conclusion, \u03b2-blocker therapy was not associated with better 3-year clinical outcomes in patients with STEMI who underwent primary PCI and had preserved LVEF.",

    "152": "A total of 90 patients aged at 85 years old and over with coronary heart disease (CAD) undergoing stenting were enrolled. The duration of statin, hospitalization and one-year clinical follow-up outcome including all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiac event (MACE), stroke and other major hemorrhages were collected and analyzed.", 
    "153": "Among these patients, 33 (36.7%) received a statin pre-treatment for at least 2 days and 57 (63.3%) did not. Patients on a statin pre-treatment were more likely to have hypertension, hyperlipidemia and a history of myocardial infraction and PCI. The procedure characteristics were similar between two groups. Despite the higher risk profile, the patients on a statin pre-treatment had a lower hospitalization MACE rate (3.0% vs 10.5%, P = 0.05). However, at one year, the patients on a statin pre-treatment had a similar MACE rate (6.1% vs 3.8%, P = 0.07) as the other group.",

    "155": "The authors sought to explore the effect of low-dose atorvastatin on endothelial function in normocholesterolemic patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus without evidence of coronary disease. Sixty patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, normal serum cholesterol, and normal exercise test results were enrolled. Initial assessment was performed by measurement of the brachial artery diameter and flow velocity both at baseline and after induced hyperemia. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either atorvastatin 10 mg daily for 4 weeks (atorvastatin group=30 patients) or matched placebo for the same period (placebo group=30 patients). Follow-up assessment of the brachial artery diameter and flow velocity (both baseline and hyperemic) was performed after 4 weeks. Initially, no significant difference was found between the two groups regarding brachial artery diameter or flow velocity, both at baseline and at peak hyperemia (P>.05 for all). At follow-up, there was a significantly higher flow velocity at baseline (P<.05) and a significantly higher percent increase of brachial artery diameter (from baseline to peak hyperemia) in the atorvastatin group (P<.05). In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and normal serum cholesterol without evidence of coronary disease, low-dose atorvastatin improves endothelial function.", 
    "156": "Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia in clinical practice. Ion channel blocking agents are often characterized by limited long-term efficacy and several side effects. In addition, ablative invasive procedures are neither easily accessible nor always efficacious. The \"upstream therapy,\" which includes angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, aldosterone receptor antagonists, statins, glucocorticoids, and \u03c9-3 poly-unsaturated fatty acids, targets arrhythmia substrate, influencing atrial structural and electrical remodeling that play an essential role in atrial fibrillation induction and maintenance. The mechanisms involved and the most important clinical evidence regarding the upstream therapy influence on atrial fibrillation are presented in this review. Some open questions are also proposed.", 
    "157": "Lipid-lowering therapy with a statin not only powerfully lowers cholesterol but also exerts anti-inflammatory effects by decreasing serum C-reactive protein (CRP). Since an angiotensin II, type-1 receptor antagonist (ARB) also decreases CRP levels, the add-on effect of statins on CRP may be worth exploring. We determined the effect of pitavastatin on serum levels of highly sensitive CRP (hs-CRP) in 30 patients with hypercholesterolemia undergoing treatment with anti-hypertensive medication including ARBs. Pitavastatin, 2 mg daily, was given. The control group consisted of hypertensive patients without hyperlipidemia. The low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and hs-CRP were measured at baseline, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment. For the atherosclerotic index, LDL-C/HDL-C ratios at 12 months were calculated. The LDL-C level was markedly reduced at 1 month and thereafter. The baseline level of hs-CRP in the hyperlipidemia group was significantly higher than that in the control group (1.647 \u00b1 0.210 mg/L vs. 0.666 \u00b1 0.097 mg/L p < 0.0001). After 3 months, the percentage of reduction of hs-CRP was significantly higher than that in the control group. The absolute values of hs-CRP were significantly decreased to a level similar to the control group, and the hs-CRP in both groups was remained at the same level for 12 months. Although the LDL-C/HDL-C ratios of the pitavastatin group was significantly reduced from 3.3 to 1.8, those of the control group were not changed. In conclusion, pitavastatin was found to have powerful anti-inflammatory, add-on effects over the similar effects of ARB as assessed by hs-CRP.", 
    "158": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder leading to slow neuronal loss in several brain regions. It is characterised by the presence of cerebral senile plaques comprised of aggregated amyloid-\u03b2 peptides. Transcriptional regulation of the \u03b3-secretase complex, which cleaves the \u03b2-amyloid precursor protein to produce A\u03b2-peptides, could modulate the pathological phenotype of AD patients. This study investigates whether rosuvastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, modulates the expression of genes involved in the function of the \u03b3-secretase complex, in a human cellular model for A\u03b2 peptide accumulation. In particular, we analysed the effect of the statin combined with apoptotic induction. Experimental apoptosis was induced by thapsigargin treatment, a drug that depletes intracellular calcium stores via inhibition of the calcium ATPase pump. Notably, systemic calcium dysregulation accompanies almost all of the brain pathology processes observed in AD. We found differential transcriptional regulation of some \u03b3-secretase cofactors relative to rosuvastatin treatment, in cells expressing Swedish mutant APP. Interestingly, this statin down-regulated the transcription of some enzyme cofactors, similar to treatment with thapsigargin. However, rosuvastatin neither affected the basal A\u03b2 levels nor counteracted APP processing or A\u03b2 over-production triggered by the thapsigargin. Our results provide evidence that rosuvastatin alters gene expression of the \u03b3-secretase complex without affecting enzyme activity.", 
    "159": "The binding of the reductase inhibitor drug fluvastatin, hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A, with the hydrophilic \u03b9- or \u03bb-carrageenan polymers, serving as potential controllers of the drug's release rate, have been studied at the density functional level of theory with the B3LYP exchange correlation functional. Three low energy conformers of fluvastatin have been calculated. The vibrational spectroscopic properties calculated for the most stable conformer were in satisfactory agreement with the experimental data. A series of hydrogen bonded complexes of the most stable conformer of fluvastatin anion with low molecular weight models of the polymers have been fully optimized. In almost all, intermolecular H-bonds are formed between the sulfate groups of \u03b9- or \u03bb-carrageenan and fluvastatin's hydroxyls, resulting in a red shift of the fluvastatin's O\u2009-\u2009H stretching vibrations. Cooperative intramolecular H-bonds within fluvastatin or \u03b9-, \u03bb-carrageenan are also present. The BSSE and ZPE corrected interaction energies were estimated in the range 281-318 kJ mol\u207b\u00b9 for \u03b9-carrageenan - fluvastatin and 145-200 kJ mol\u207b\u00b9 for \u03bb-carrageenan - fluvastatin complexes. The electron density (\u03c1 (bcp)) and Laplacian (\u2207\u00b2\u03c1 (bcp)) properties at critical points of the intermolecular hydrogen bonds, estimated by AIM (atoms in molecules) calculations, have a low and positive character (\u2207\u00b2\u03c1(bcp)\u2009>\u20090), consistent with the electrostatic character of the hydrogen bonds. The structural and energetic data observed, as well as the extent of the red shift of the fluvastatin's O\u2009-\u2009H stretching vibrations upon complex formation and the properties of electron density show a stronger binding of fluvastatin to \u03b9- than to \u03bb-carrageenan.", 
    "160": "Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases causing irreversible optic nerve damage. This review presents 4 elements of future glaucoma treatment strategies: baroprotection, vasoprotection, neuroprotection and gene therapy. New baroprotection includes compounds that alter the actin cytoskeleton (rho-kinase inhibitors, latrunculin, cytochalasin), new drugs that enhance aqueous outflow via the trabecular meshwork (statins, steroid antagonists) and via the uveoscleral route (EP2 agonists, 5-HT2 agonists), as well as new classes of components that suppress aqueous humor formation (cannabinoids). Vasoprotection includes blocking reperfusion injury (NOS-2 inhibitors, endothelin blockers, MMP-9 inhibitors). Concerning neuroprotection antiamyloids antibodies, erythropoietin and caspase inhibitors are discussed. Gene therapy may target various effectors: the trabecular meshwork (cytoskeleton regulatory proteins, miocyllin, MMPs), the ciliary body epithelium (genes modifying aqueous humor production, neuropeptides), the ciliary body cells (MMPs, genes of local PGs biosynthesis, ciliary muscle relaxants), the retinal ganglion cells (neurotrophin genes, anti-apoptotic genes), M\u00fcller cells (neurotrophins, GLAST) and conjunctiva (gene of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase, inhibitor p21). Experimental studies on the graft mesenchymal stem cells and mature retinal cells to replace the dead retinal ganglion cells are advanced. Immunotherapy, offering a vaccination, providing protection against loss of retinal ganglion cells, has been investigated.",

However, they also may influence the immune system by affecting a wide range of regulatory actions, for example, Treg- and Th2-type response activation as well as Th1 and Th17 response diminishing. These features provide the rationale for potential application of statins in treating chronic inflammatory diseases and other disorders with the involvement of the immune system. This article seeks to review the immunomodulatory actions of statins and their possible implementation in treating rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and other autoimmune disorders in humans.", 
    "162": "Diabetic neuropathy is one of the most common complications of diabetes and causes various problems in daily life. Several investigations have noted that many factors in the spinal cord are involved in the symptoms of painful diabetic neuropathy, and there are very few effective therapeutic regimens. In the present study, we sought to elucidate the role of the RhoA/Rho kinase (ROCK) pathway in thermal hyperalgesia in diabetic mice. The intracellular localization of RhoA and the expression of eNOS were measured by western blotting. Thermal hyperalgesia was assessed by the tail-flick test and mechanical allodynia was assessed by automated von Frey filament test in streptozotocin(STZ)-induced diabetic mice. The spinal cord of STZ-treated diabetic mice showed increased membrane-bound RhoA compared to non-diabetic control. Treatment with the RhoA inhibitor exoenzyme C3, Clostridium botulinum, and the ROCK inhibitor Y27632 attenuated thermal hyperalgesia and mechanical allodynia in diabetic mice. Moreover, daily treatment with simvastatin attenuated all of those changes in diabetic mice. The expression of eNOS and NO metabolite contents in the spinal cord was decreased in diabetic mice, and these changes were normalized by treatment with simvastatin. The present results show that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have an inhibitory effect on thermal hyperalgesia in diabetic mice, which is mediated by an increase in NO production through the inhibition of RhoA/ROCK pathways. These results suggest that ROCK inhibitors and HMG-CoA inhibitors may be attractive compounds to relieve the symptoms of painful diabetic neuropathies.",

Indeed, beyond lipid changes, some properties of these drugs, related to inflammation, hemostasis, endothelial function, plaque stabilization, and more recently, to the mobilization of endothelial cells, have been proposed. In addition, recent meta-analysis also revealed that statins decrease systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Taken together, all these benefits can contribute for stroke prevention by statins.",
