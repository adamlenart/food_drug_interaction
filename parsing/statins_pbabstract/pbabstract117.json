This study aimed to investigate the effects of simvastatin locally applied from calcium sulfate (CS) combined with a mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) sheet on fracture healing. In vitro, the proliferation and differentiation of rat bone marrow-derived MSCs stimulated by simvastatin were investigated. In vivo, an osteotomy model was made in rat tibia, and fractured tibias were treated with CS, CS/simvastatin, CS/MSC sheet or simvastatin-loaded CS with MSC or untreated (control). Tibias were harvested at 2 or 8 weeks and underwent real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, x-ray, micro-CT and histological analysis. The expression levels of bone morphogenetic protein 2, alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, osteoprotegerin and vascular endothelial growth factor of simvastatin-induced MSCs increased with the concentrations of the simvastatin, significantly higher than those in the MSCs group. At 2 weeks, the CS/simvastatin/MSC sheet group showed significantly higher expressions of bone morphogenetic protein 2, alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, osteoprotegerin and vascular endothelial growth factor, with more callus formation around the fracture site compared with the other four groups. At 8 weeks, complete bone union was obtained in the CS/simvastatin/MSC sheet group. By contrast, newly regenerated bone tissue partially bridged the gap in the CS/simvastatin group and the CS/MSC sheet group; the control and CS group showed nonunion of the tibia. These results show that both simvastatin and the MSC sheet contributed to the formation of new bone and that the tibia fracture was completely healed by transplantation of the MSC sheet with locally applied simvastatin. Such MSC sheet with locally applied simvastatin might contribute to the treatment of fractures, bone delayed unions or nonunions in clinical practice.",

The following conditions were considered: abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs), peripheral arterial disease (PAD), carotid artery disease and atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (ARAS).", 
    "2": "Carotid stenosis is frequent in the general population, especially in elderly people and is associated with a high risk of stroke and vascular events. In patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis the overall annual risk of ipsilateral stroke has dramatically decreased over the past decades, due to improvement in medical management. Asymptomatic carotid stenosis is probably a better indicator of generalized atherosclerotic disease than of stroke risk, with an average risk of nonstroke death (mainly due to ischemic heart disease) generally higher than the risk of ipsilateral stroke. Management of risk factors, antiplatelet therapy, and statins are highly beneficial in these patients. Carotid surgery in patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis is associated with a small absolute benefit compared to medical treatment. The prognosis of patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis is dramatically different from that of patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis because the risk of stroke on medical treatment alone is very high and highest during the first few days and weeks. In these patients, endarterectomy is highly beneficial and the absolute benefit of is increased in patients with 70- 99% stenosis, men, patients over 75 years, and in those treated within 2 weeks after the last event. The meta-analysis of the 3 major European trials comparing endarterectomy to stenting in symptomatic stenosis has shown an increased risk of perioperative risk of any stroke or death in the stenting group (74% increase in risk in patients treated with stenting). However, the risk of stroke or death after stenting and surgery were equivalent below the age of 70 whereas there was a two-fold increase in risk of stenting over endarterectomy above this age. Thus, surgery remains the first line method in most cases but stenting is potentially an alternative in young patients.",

For instance, statins can enhance the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), at least partly by upregulating its transcription. Although it has been reported that -786 T/C polymorphism of the promoter region has an important influence on statininduced transcription of the human eNOS gene, much remains unclear about statin-induced eNOS transcription. We tried to identify other statin-responsive promoter regions.",

    "19": "Patients presenting for invasive cardiovascular procedures are frequently taking a variety of medications aimed to treat risk factors related to heart and vascular disease. During the procedure, antithrombotic, sedative, and analgesic medications are commonly needed, and after interventional procedures, new medications are often added for primary and secondary prevention of ischemic events. In addition to these prescribed medications, the use of over-the-counter drugs and supplements continues to rise. Most elderly patients, for example, are taking 5 or more prescribed medications and 1 or more supplements, and they often have some degree of renal insufficiency. This polypharmacy might result in drug-drug interactions that affect the balance of thrombotic and bleeding events during the procedure and during long-term treatment. Mixing of anticoagulants, for instance, might lead to periprocedural bleeding, and this is associated with an increase in long-term adverse events. Furthermore, the range of possible interactions with thienopyridine antiplatelets is of concern, because these drugs are essential to immediate and extended interventional success. The practical challenges in the field are great-some drug-drug interactions are likely present yet not well understood due to limited assays, whereas other interactions have well-described biological effects but seem to be more theoretical, because there is little to no clinical impact. Interventional providers need to be attentive to the potential for drug-drug interaction, the associated harm, and the appropriate action, if any, to minimize the potential for medication-related adverse events. This review will focus on drug-drug interactions that have the potential to affect procedural success, either through increases in immediate complications or compromising longer-term outcome.", 
    "20": "Some practitioners use advanced lipoprotein analysis with the goal of better predicting risk and individualizing lifestyle and drug therapy for cardiovascular prevention. Unfortunately, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particle number and size, other lipoprotein subfractionation, apolipoproteins B and A, and lipoprotein(a) have not yet met current standards for biomarker evaluation, and it remains to be determined whether these tests incrementally add to cardiovascular risk predicted by traditional risk factors. More importantly, it has yet to be determined whether treatment strategies guided by, or targeting, these measures improve cardiovascular outcomes. Drug therapies known to alter advanced lipoprotein analysis parameters, specifically niacin and fenofibrate, have not been shown to additionally reduce cardiovascular risk in recent randomized trials of high-risk patients treated with statin therapy. These findings suggest advanced lipoprotein analysis-guided strategies may not further reduce cardiovascular events and could lead to increased adverse effects and costs; this approach needs further research to establish its role in individualizing therapies for cardiovascular prevention. In contrast, a large body of evidence supports focusing on LDL cholesterol reduction and intensification of statin therapy to reduce cardiovascular risk.",

In addition to its benefits in cardiovascular protection, statins have been found to be useful in several other clinical conditions, including cancer. In a recent report that appeared in Neoplasia, Malenda et al., have demonstrated that statins inhibit glucose uptake in cancer cells. Using multiple statins and glucose analogs ( ( 18) FDG and 6-NBDG) they showed that inhibition of cholesterol synthesis underlies the blockade of glucose uptake in several cancer cell lines. Further, based on an exploratory clinical study, they also showed that diagnostic PET-CT imaging in patients treated for hypercholesterolemia was affected due to statin-mediated inhibition of glucose uptake.

Most therapeutic approaches address DR by preventing or destroying neovasculature; however, this fails to eliminate pathogenic causes. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a promising candidate for cell therapy because they have unique regenerative potential and provide an option to manage retinal injuries. Transplantation of MSCs in rats with diabetes induced by streptozocin administration was shown to ameliorate DR. However, the poor viability and homing of MSCs after transplantation may reduce the efficacy of cell therapy. Intravitreal transplantation of MSCs was shown to augment vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). More recent studies have found a central role for VEGF in vascular lesion formation in DR and proposed blockage of VEGF as an effective approach to manage DR. Atorvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, has been proven to decrease VEGF production of MSCs under hypoxic conditions. It has also been demonstrated that atorvastatin increases the viability of MSCs through the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase-endothelial nitric oxide synthase signaling pathway. There is also evidence that nitric oxide improves homing of MSCs by increasing chemokine-related receptor CXCR4 expression. It could be hypothesized that co-administration of MSCs with atorvastatin may be a significant step forward in development of an efficient MSC therapy of DR through preventing excess VEGF production by MSCs under hypoxic conditions as well as increasing the viability and homing of transplanted MSCs.",

Increasing evidence indicates that statins have protective effects in several neurological diseases including stroke, cerebral ischemia, Parkinson disease, multiple sclerosis, traumatic brain injury and epilepsy. The aim of the present research was to evaluate the effects of some HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (i.e. lovastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin, fluvastatin and pravastatin) commonly used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia in the DBA/2 mice, an animal model of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Furthermore, the co-administration of these compounds with some antiepileptic drugs (AEDs; i.e. carbamazepine, diazepam, felbamate, gabapentin, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, topiramate and valproate) was studied in order to identify possible positive pharmacological interactions. Simvastatin only was active against both the tonic and clonic phase of audiogenic seizures, whereas the other statins tested were only partially effective against the tonic phase with the following order of potency: lovastatin>fluvastatin>atorvastatin; pravastatin was completely ineffective up to the dose of 150mg/kg. The co-administration of ineffective doses of all statins with AEDs generally increased the potency of the latter reducing their ED50 values. In particular, simvastatin was the most active in potentiating the activity of AEDs and the combinations of statins with carbamazepine, diazepam, felbamate, lamotrigine, topiramate and valproate were the most favorable, whereas, the co-administrations with the other AEDs studied was in most cases neutral. The increase in potency was generally associated with an enhancement of motor impairment (TD50); however, the therapeutic index (TD50/ED50) of combined treatment of AEDs with statins was predominantly more favorable than control. Statins administration did not significantly affect the total plasma but, in some cases, it increased the free plasma levels and the brain concentrations of some of the AEDs studied (i.e. carbamazepine, diazepam, phenytoin and valproate); however, these alterations where not statistically significant. Therefore, with the exception of the latter compounds, we might exclude pharmacokinetic interactions and conclude that for the most of AEDs, potentiation was of pharmacodynamic nature. In conclusion, simvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin and atorvastatin showed an additive anticonvulsant effect when co-administered with some AEDs, most notably carbamazepine, diazepam, felbamate, lamotrigine, topiramate and valproate, implicating a possible therapeutic relevance of such drug combinations.

NR3, a novel subunit of NMDARs, also decreases Ca(2+) influxes by forming new NMDARs with NR1 and NR2. It is meaningful to uncover whether protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) and NR3A play a role in the protective effect of Simvastatin on ischemic stroke. In the present study, the Sprague-Dawley rats were pretreated with Simvastatin for 7 days before middle cerebral artery occlusion was performed to mimic ischemic stroke. The results showed that Simvastatin decreased brain ischemic infarct area significantly while increasing the expression levels of PP2A and NR3A, thus dephosphorylating the serine sites of NR1 (ser896 and ser897) along with increased enzymatic activities of PP2A. The protein levels of NR3A decreased as the enzymatic activities of PP2A were inhibited by okadaic acid. The results indicated that Simvastatin could protect the cerebrum from ischemic injury through a signaling mechanism involving elevated levels of PP2A and NR3A, and that PP2A might involve in the regulatory mechanism of NR3A expression.",

Due to a diversity in putative reference genes expression stability in different in vitro models, a validation of an internal control gene should be made for each particular tissue or cell type and every specific experimental design. A few approaches have been proposed for reference gene selection, including pair-wise comparison approach and model-based approach. In this article we have assessed the expression stability of eight putative reference genes: ACTB, B2M, GADD45A, GAPDH, HPRT1, PES1, PSMC4, YWHAZ, in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) treated with different statins and with TNF-\u03b1. The analysis was performed with three reference gene validation programs: geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper. We have shown that hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase 1 gene (HPRT1) and tyrosine 3-monooxygenase/tryptophan 5-monooxygenase activation protein, zeta polypeptide gene (YWHAZ) are the most stably expressed genes among the analyzed ones. Furthermore, our results show that \u03b2-actin gene (ACTB) is downregulated by statins and thus should not be used as a normalizing gene in a discussed experimental setup. A ranking of candidate reference genes stability values is provided and might serve as a valuable guide for future gene expression studies in endothelial cells. This is the first report on reference gene selection for RT-qPCR applications in statin-treated HUVEC model.",

In type 2 diabetes (T2D), use of insulin and statins was associated with reduced cancer risk while co-presence of low LDL cholesterol (LDLC <2.8\u200ammol/l) plus low triglyceride (TG; <1.7\u200ammol/l) increased cancer risk. There is experimental evidence showing that insulin insufficiency might promote HCC. In this study, we examined whether this lipid subphenotype and use of insulin or statins might modify the promoting effect of chronic HBV infection (indicated by the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen) on HCC. We analyzed data of 1319 T2D patients enrolled into the Hong Kong Diabetes Registry from December 1996 to January 2005 and followed up to 2005. Additive interaction was estimated using relative excess risk due to interaction and attributable proportion due to interaction. During 5782 person-years of follow-up, 1.74% (n=23) of patients developed HCC (incidence, 3.98; 95% confidence interval, 2.36-5.60/1000 person-years). HbA1c \u22657.0% and the lipid phenotype (LDLC <2.8\u200ammol/l plus TG <1.7\u200ammol/l) increased the hazard ratios (HRs) of chronic HBV infection for HCC from 3.74 to 74.96 and from 11.01 to 89.82 respectively with significant interactions. Use of insulin or statins decreased the HRs from 37.51 to 5.87 and from 64.94 to 16.99 respectively with significant interactions (all P values <0.05). These findings support our hypothesis that hyperglycemia and co-presence of low LDLC plus low TG might enhance, while insulin or statin usage might attenuate the promoting effect of chronic HBV infection on HCC in T2D.",

In this study, we investigated the properties of hydrogel composed of gelatin-poly(ethylene glycol)-tyramine (GPT) as an efficient SIM delivery vehicle that can trigger osteogenic differentiation. Sustained delivery of SIM was achieved through its encapsulation in an injectable, biodegradable GPT-hydrogel. Cross-linking of the gelatin-based GPT-hydrogel was induced by the reaction of horse radish peroxidase and H(2)O(2). GPT-hydrogels of three different matrix stiffness, 1,800 (GPT-hydrogel1), 5,800 (GPT-hydrogel2), and 8,400 Pa (GPT-hydrogel3) were used. The gelation/degradation time and SIM release profiles of hydrogels loaded with two different concentrations of SIM, 1 and 3 mg/ml, were also evaluated. Maximum swelling times of GPT-hydrogel1, GPT-hydrogel2, and GPT-hydrogel3 were observed to be 6, 12, and 20 days, respectively. All GPT-hydrogels showed complete degradation within 55 days. The in vitro SIM release profiles, investigated in PBS buffer (pH 7.4) at 37\u00b0C, exhibited typical biphasic release patterns with the initial burst being more rapid with GPT-hydrogel1 compared with GPT-hydrogel3. Substantial increase in matrix metalloproteinase-13, osteocalcin expression levels, and mineralization were seen in osteogenic differentiation system using MC3T3-E1 cells cultured with GPT-hydrogels loaded with SIM in a dose-dependent manner. This study demonstrated that controlled release of SIM from a biodegradable, injectable GPT-hydrogel had a promising role for long-term treatment of chronic degenerative diseases such as disc degenerative disease.",

Statins slow atherosclerosis progression and can even induce atherosclerosis regression. Technological advances in imaging modalities to assess atherosclerosis have made possible direct visualization of atherosclerotic plaques and estimation of plaque burden and permit the evaluation of the impact of medical therapies on the natural history of plaque progression. However, owing to several limiting factors as discussed in this review, presently atherosclerotic plaque progression cannot be used as a therapeutic goal for reduction of the risk of cardiovascular disease.

Rosuvastatin is an OATP1B1 substrate and often concomitantly prescribed with oral antidiabetics in the clinic. The aim of this study was to investigate possible drug-drug interactions between these drugs at the level of OATP1B1 and OATP1B1*15. We generated human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells stably overexpressing OATP1B1 or OATP1B1*15 that showed similar protein expression levels of OATP1B1 and OATP1B1*15 at the cell membrane as measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. In HEK-OATP1B1*15 cells, the V(max) for OATP1B1-mediated transport of E(2)17\u03b2-G (estradiol 17\u03b2-d-glucuronide) was decreased >60%, whereas K(m) values (Michaelis constant) were comparable. Uptake of rosuvastatin in HEK-OATP1B1 cells (K(m) 13.1 \u00b1 0.43 \u03bcM) was nearly absent in HEK-OATP1B1*15 cells. Interestingly, several oral antidiabetics (glyburide, glimepiride, troglitazone, pioglitazone, glipizide, gliclazide, and tolbutamide), but not metformin, were identified as significant inhibitors of the OATP1B1-mediated transport of rosuvastatin. The IC(50) values for inhibition of E(2)17\u03b2-G uptake were similar between OATP1B1 and OATP1B1*15. In conclusion, these studies indicate that several oral antidiabetic drugs affect the OATP1B1-mediated uptake of rosuvastatin in vitro. The next step will be to translate these data to the clinical situation, as it remains to be established whether the studied oral antidiabetics indeed affect the clinical pharmacokinetic profile of rosuvastatin in patients.",

The aim of the present series of experiments was to improve the solubility and dissolution of two fixed dose combination formulations (FDC), each consisting of two BCS class II drugs. The first FDC contained a weak acid (glimepiride) and a weak base (pioglitazone), while the second FDC contained two compounds (simvastatin and ezetimibe) that are essentially non-ionised over the physiological pH range. The formulation approaches used were as follows: (a) an inclusion complex with hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (HP-\u03b2-CD), (b) a solid dispersion with Soluplus, a new highly water soluble polyvinyl caprolactam - polyvinyl acetate - polyethylene glycol graft copolymer and (c) a ternary inclusion complex with both HP-\u03b2-CD and Soluplus. Solid state analysis was performed for the pure drugs, and all formulations using powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD). The in vitro performance of the different formulation approaches, as gauged by solubility and dissolution experiments, was compared with that of the marketed products containing the respective fixed dose combinations, Tandemact 30 mg/4 mg tablets and Inegy 10 mg/40 mg tablets. The FDCs of the pure drugs and the marketed products showed very poor (and especially for pioglitazone, strongly pH-dependent) dissolution. By contrast, all binary and ternary inclusion complexes showed enhanced release for both drugs in the FDC. The ternary inclusion complex generated synergistic improvement in solubility and dissolution results for both FDCs. For example, in pH conditions of the fasted small intestine after a test duration of 240 min, we observed 100% dissolution of both drugs from the ternary pioglitazone/glimepiride (30 mg/4 mg) complex formulation, whereas from the marketed formulation less than 5% pioglitazone, and only 25% glimepiride dissolved. Using the same conditions, 60% ezetimibe and 85% simvastatin dissolved from the ternary ezetimibe/simvastatin (10 mg/40 mg) complex formulation, whereas with less than 5% ezetimibe and 10% simvastatin dissolved after 240 min, the marketed FDC formulation showed poor dissolution.

Multiple clinical trials of lipid-lowering agents have demonstrated that lowering cholesterol effectively reduces the risk of cardiovascular events and death. Currently, treatment with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (\"statins\") is the most commonly used approach, given their superior efficacy relative to other cholesterol lowering agents. However, not all patients on statin monotherapy achieve target cholesterol levels, and even when cholesterol lowering is successful, significant residual cardiovascular risk remains. There is increasing interest in developing combination cholesterol-modifying therapies that may augment the treatment effect and minimize the side effects of statins. Although there is currently no evidence that any of the potential therapy combinations can improve clinical outcome compared to statin monotherapy alone, results of several large ongoing trials will help to clarify this important field.",

Monacolin K also serves as a well-known hypolipidemic medication, but its side effect myopathy is a concern. Monascin and ankaflavin, the yellow pigments produced by Monascus species, have been proven to possess hypolipidemic functions; however, no studies have compared the hypolipidemic effects of monascin, ankaflavin, and monacolin K under the same dosages. In this study, the equal dosages of monascin, ankaflavin, and monacolin K were oral administrated to hamsters fed a high cholesterol diet for 6 weeks. Comparison of the displayed hypolipidemic and anti-atherosclerosis effects was performed, in addition to an investigation into the inducement of side effect. The results indicated that monascin and ankaflavin were similar to monacolin K in significantly reducing total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in serum and lipid plaque (p < 0.05) in the heart aorta. In addition, ankaflavin achieved the effects of serum TC and TG reduction, with no significant difference as compared to those effects of monacolin K (p > 0.05). However, as compared to monacolin K, ankaflavin possessed more significant effects on the prevention of fatty liver and lipid plaque accumulation in heart aorta. More importantly, monascin significantly enhanced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations, while monacolin K displayed the opposite effect. Regarding the side effect, monacolin K also raised elevated creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) activity, which was highly correlated with rhabdomyolysis development, while monascin and ankaflavin did not induce such a side effect. In conclusion, MS and AK had the potential to be developed as hypolipidemic agents without rhabdomyolysis development.",

Patients not achieving LDL-C goal also more frequently discontinued statin use by 6 months (24% vs 6%, P < .001). Multivariable modeling (c index, 0.78) revealed the absence of a statin prescription at discharge and lack of persistence on statin therapy as the strongest independent factors associated with failure to reach LDL-C goal.

The secondary goals of non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) cholesterol <100 mg/dl and apolipoprotein B (ApoB) <80 mg/dl have been recommended to reduce excess cardiovascular risk not captured by LDL cholesterol. The present post hoc analysis from the Limiting UNdertreatment of lipids in Acute coronary syndrome with Rosuvastatin (LUNAR) study examined the relation of ApoB with LDL cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol at baseline and during treatment with intensive statin therapy. The LUNAR participants had acute coronary syndrome and received rosuvastatin 40 mg/day or 20\u00a0mg/day or atorvastatin 80 mg/day for 12 weeks. Linear regression analyses were used to compare ApoB, direct LDL cholesterol, and non-HDL cholesterol at baseline and during therapy. Of the 682 patients included in the analysis, 220 had triglycerides \u2265200 mg/dl. Linear regression analysis showed that correlation of ApoB and non-HDL cholesterol was stronger than that of ApoB and LDL cholesterol and stronger with statin therapy than at baseline (R(2)\u00a0= 0.93 for ApoB vs non-HDL cholesterol with statins). The target of ApoB of\u00a080\u00a0mg/dl correlated with LDL cholesterol of 90 mg/dl and non-HDL cholesterol of 110\u00a0mg/dl at baseline and with LDL cholesterol of 74 mg/dl and non-HDL cholesterol of 92\u00a0mg/dl with statin therapy. For high-triglyceride patients, the corresponding on-treatment targets were LDL cholesterol of 68 mg/dl and non-HDL cholesterol of 92 mg/dl. In conclusion, non-HDL cholesterol is an adequate surrogate of ApoB during statin therapy, independent of triglyceride status. However, to match LDL cholesterol and ApoB treatment goals in the very-high-risk category, the current non-HDL cholesterol goal should be lowered by 8\u00a0to 10\u00a0mg/dl.",

There was no difference in cardiovascular events among those taking an aspirin and a statin on admission and those who were not. However, in both an unadjusted and a multivariable analysis, the odds of an adverse peripheral vascular outcome (repeat peripheral intervention, amputation, or limb salvage surgery) within 6 months decreased by more than half in patients receiving aspirin and statin therapy before peripheral vascular intervention as compared with those who received neither (odds ratio, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.29-0.71).",

    "170": "Recent epidemiologic data show that low serum cholesterol level as well as statin use is associated with a decreased risk of developing aggressive or advanced prostate cancer, suggesting a role for cholesterol in aggressive prostate cancer development. Intracellular cholesterol promotes prostate cancer progression as a substrate for de novo androgen synthesis and through regulation of AKT signaling. By conducting next-generation sequencing-based DNA methylome analysis, we have discovered marked hypermethylation at the promoter of the major cellular cholesterol efflux transporter, ABCA1, in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. ABCA1 promoter hypermethylation renders the promoter unresponsive to transactivation and leads to elevated cholesterol levels in LNCaP. ABCA1 promoter hypermethylation is enriched in intermediate- to high-grade prostate cancers and not detectable in benign prostate. Remarkably, ABCA1 downregulation is evident in all prostate cancers examined, and expression levels are inversely correlated with Gleason grade. Our results suggest that cancer-specific ABCA1 hypermethylation and loss of protein expression direct high intracellular cholesterol levels and hence contribute to an environment conducive to tumor progression.",

In vitro studies revealed that short term simvastatin pretreatment did not reduce S. aureus-stimulated expression of surface proteins necessary for macrophage presentation of antigen to T cells, such as MHC Class II and costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86, but did reduce both basal and S. aureus-stimulated levels of C5aR. Additionally, this work demonstrated the ability of simvastatin to dampen macrophage responses initiated not only by bacteria directly but by membrane vesicles shed in response to infection, revealing a new mechanism of immune modulation by statins.

Substantial scientific evidence supports the hypothesis that some of these common and relatively safe drugs may reduce breast cancer mortality among those with the disease by an amount that rivals the mortality reduction gained by currently used therapies. In particular, the evidence is strongest for aspirin (approximately 50% reduction), statins (approximately 25% reduction), and metformin (approximately 50% reduction). As these drugs are generic and inexpensive, there is little incentive for the pharmaceutical industry to fund the randomized trials that would show their effectiveness definitively. We advocate that confirmation of these findings in randomized trials be considered a high research priority, as the potential impact on human lives saved could be immense.",

However, the effects of statin treatment on atherosclerotic plaques, particularly stable plaques, remain poorly defined. In total, 228 consecutive patients with stable atherosclerotic plaques who had undergone coronary arteriography (CAG) and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) were randomly assigned to receive placebo (placebo group, n=54) or atorvastatin (ATOR) at a single daily dose of 10 mg (ATOR 10 mg group, n=47), 20 mg (ATOR 20 mg group, n=45), 40 mg (ATOR 40 mg group, n=43) or 80 mg (ATOR 80 mg group, n=39).

At baseline, mean low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels, as well as plaque volumes and percentages of plaque necrosis, were similar between all groups. At 6 months of follow-up, the LDL levels in the ATOR groups were below those at their respective baselines (P<0.01). HDL levels in the ATOR 80 mg group following treatment were significantly higher compared with baseline (P=0.001).

ATOR (20 mg/day) is able to lower LDL to standard levels while ATOR 40 mg/day was superior to 20 mg/day and had similar effects to 80 mg/day. Only ATOR 80 mg/day was able to increase HDL levels. Hs-CRP in patients without ATOR was higher and ATOR 80 mg/day decreased levels. ATOR \u226520 mg/day is able to stabilize plaques and ATOR 80 mg/day was superior to 20 and 40 mg/day.

FH is caused mainly by mutations in the LDLR gene. However, mutations in other genes including APOB and PCSK9, can give rise to a similar phenotype. Homozygous FH with an estimated prevalence of one in a million is associated with severe hypercholesterolemia with accelerated atherosclerotic CHD in childhood and without treatment, death usually occurs before the age of 30 years. Current approaches for the treatment of homozygous FH include statin-based lipid-lowering therapies and LDL apheresis. Mipomersen is a second-generation antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) targeted to human apolipoprotein B (apoB)-100. This review provides an overview of the pathophysiology and current treatment options for familial hypercholesterolemia and describes novel therapeutic strategies focusing on mipomersen, an antisense apoB synthesis inhibitor. Mipomersen is distributed mainly to the liver where it silences apoB mRNA, thereby reducing hepatic apoB-100 and giving rise to reductions in plasma total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and apoB concentrations in a dose-and time-dependent manner. Mipomersen has been shown to decrease apoB, LDL-cholesterol and lipoprotein(a) in patients with heterozygous and homozygous FH on maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy. The short-term efficacy and safety of mipomersen has been established, however, injection site reactions are common and concern exists regarding the long-term potential for hepatic steatosis with this ASO. In summary, mipomersen given alone or in combination with standard lipid-lowering medications shows promise as an adjunct therapy in patients with homozygous or refractory heterozygous FH at high risk of atherosclerotic CHD, who are not at target or are intolerant of statins.",

In JUPITER, both absolute risk and the absolute risk reduction with statin therapy were related to the level of CRP, whereas no such relationship was observed for LDL-C. Further, on-treatment levels of CRP and LDL-C were independently associated with residual risk, and the genetic determinants of statin-induced CRP reduction differed from the genetic determinants of statin-induced LDL reduction. Despite these data, it is impossible in any statin trial to establish whether the clinical benefits of treatment are due to LDL-reduction alone, to inflammation inhibition, or to a combination of both processes. To address the hypothesis that lowering inflammation will lower vascular event rates, two large-scale placebo controlled trials using targeted anti-inflammatory agents for the secondary prevention of myocardial infarction have been initiated. The first trial, the Canakinumab Anti-Inflammatory Thrombosis Outcomes Study (CANTOS), is evaluating whether interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) inhibition as compared to placebo can reduce rates of recurrent myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death among stable coronary artery disease patients who remain at high vascular risk due to persistent elevations of hsCRP (\u2265 2 mg/L), despite contemporary secondary prevention strategies. The second trial, the Cardiovascular Inflammation Reduction Trial (CIRT) has been funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and will evaluate whether low dose methotrexate (target dose 20 mg/week) as compared to placebo will reduce major vascular events among a group of post-myocardial infarction patients with either diabetes or metabolic syndrome, groups known to have high risk on the basis of a persistent pro-inflammatory response. Together, CANTOS and CIRT represent a core test of the inflammation hypothesis of atherothrombosis and the exploration of a potential new phase for cardiovascular therapeutics.",

We also compared 50 age- and gender-matched controls with no evidence of CAD. Serum A-FABP levels in patients with stable CAD were significantly higher than those in controls. In patients with stable CAD, serum A-FABP levels were significantly higher in patients with complex lesions than in those with simple lesions: median (25th-75th percentile), 23.4 (17.7-30.8) vs 18.2 (12.2-24.7) ng/ml, P < 0.01. Serum A-FABP levels were also significantly associated with angiographic scores of extent of coronary lesion (r = 0.21, P = 0.02). Multiple logistic analysis that included dyslipidemia, statin therapy, and extent score demonstrated that serum A-FABP was independently associated with complex lesions. The multiple adjusted odds ratio for a complex lesion with a serum A-FABP level (per doubling) was 2.38 (95 % confidence interval, 1.03-6.41; P = 0.03). High serum A-FABP levels were significantly associated with complex coronary lesions in patients with stable CAD, suggesting that high A-FABP levels may be involved in coronary plaque vulnerability.",

We previously reported that drugs that activate the NRF2 antioxidant response signaling pathway increase HbF in primary human erythroid cells. In an attempt to increase HbF levels achieved with NRF2 activators, in the present study, we investigated potential complementary activity between these agents and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) based on their ability to induce KLF2 protein levels. Experiments in K562 cells showed that simvastatin increased KLF2 mRNA and protein and KLF2 binding to HS2 of the \u03b2-globin locus control region and enhanced -globin mRNA production by the NRF2 activator Tert-butylhydroquinone (tBHQ). When tested in differentiating primary human erythroid cells, simvastatin induced HbF alone and additively with tBHQ, but it did not increase KLF2 mRNA or locus control region binding above levels seen with normal differentiation. Investigating alternative mechanisms of action, we found that both simvastatin and tBHQ suppress \u03b2-globin mRNA and KLF1 and BCL11A mRNA and protein, similar to what is seen in people with an HPFH phenotype because of KLF1 haploinsufficiency. These findings identify statins as a potential class of HbF-inducing agents and suggest a novel mechanism of action based on pharmacologic suppression of KLF1 and BCL11A gene expression.",

    "212": "Capsaicin (trans-8-methy-N-vanilly-6-nonenamide, CAP), the main ingredient responsible for the hot pungent taste of chilli peppers. However, little is known about the metabolic interactions between CAP and clinically used drugs. This study attempted to investigate the effect of CAP on the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin (SV), a cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A substrate and an important cholesterol-lowering agent. CAP (3, 8 or 25 mg/kg), ketoconazole, dexamethasone or 5% CMC-Na was given to rats for seven consecutive days and on the seventh day SV (80 mg/kg) was administered orally. The results showed that when a single dose of SV was administered to rats fed with CAP over one week, AUC(0\u2192\u221e), C(max) of SV and its acid metabolite was significantly decreased in comparison to the control treatment. Pretreatment of rats with CAP resulted in an decrease in the AUC(0-\u221e) of SV of about 67.06% (CAP 3 mg/kg, P<0.05), 73.21% (CAP 8 mg/kg, P<0.01) and 77.49% (CAP 25 mg/kg, P<0.01) compared with the control group. The results demonstrate that chronic ingestion of high doses of CAP will decrease the bioavailability of SV to a significant extent in rats.", 
    "213": "The purpose of this study was to compare the incidence of new-onset diabetes (NOD) with cardiovascular (CV) event reduction at different levels of NOD risk.", 
    "214": "Statins reduce the number of CV events but increase the incidence of NOD. We previously reported that 4 factors independently predicted NOD: fasting blood glucose >100 mg/dl, fasting triglycerides >150 mg/dl, body mass index >30 kg/m(2), and history of hypertension.", 
    "215": "We compared NOD incidence with CV event reduction among 15,056 patients with coronary disease but without diabetes at baseline in the TNT (Treating to New Targets) (n = 7,595) and IDEAL (Incremental Decrease in Endpoints Through Aggressive Lipid Lowering) (n = 7,461) trials. CV events included coronary heart disease death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and resuscitated cardiac arrest.", 
    "216": "Among 8,825 patients with 0 to 1 of the aforementioned NOD risk factors at baseline, NOD developed in 142 of 4,407 patients in the atorvastatin 80 mg group and in 148 of 4,418 in the atorvastatin 10 mg and simvastatin 20 to 40 mg groups (3.22% vs. 3.35%; hazard ratio [HR]: 0.97; 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.77 to 1.22). Among the remaining 6,231 patients with 2 to 4 NOD risk factors, NOD developed in 448 of 3,128 in the atorvastatin 80 mg group and in 368 of 3,103 in the lower-dose groups (14.3% vs. 11.9%; HR: 1.24; 95% CI: 1.08 to 1.42; p = 0.0027). The number of CV events was significantly reduced with atorvastatin 80 mg in both NOD risk groups.", 
    "217": "Compared with lower-dose statin therapy, atorvastatin 80 mg/day did not increase the incidence of NOD in patients with 0 to 1 NOD risk factors but did, by 24%, among patients with 2 to 4 NOD risk factors. The number of CV events was significantly reduced with atorvastatin 80 mg in both NOD risk groups.", 
    "218": "Despite ezetimibe's ability to reduce serum cholesterol levels, there are concerns over its vascular effects and whether it prevents or ameliorates atherosclerotic disease (AD). The aims of this study were to estimate the effect of ezetimibe use on major AD events and all-cause mortality and to compare these associations to those observed for hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin) use. A total of 367 new ezetimibe users were identified from November 1, 2002, to December 31, 2009. These subjects were aged \u226518 years and had no previous statin use. One to 4 statin user matches were identified for each ezetimibe user, resulting in a total of 1,238 closely matched statin users. Pharmacy data and drug dosage information were used to estimate a moving window of ezetimibe and statin exposure for each day of study follow-up. The primary outcome was a composite of major AD events (coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral vascular disease events) and all-cause death. Ezetimibe use (odds ratio 0.33, 95% confidence interval 0.13 to 0.86) and statin use (odds ratio 0.61, 95% confidence interval 0.36 to 1.04) were associated with reductions in the likelihood of the composite outcome. These protective associations were most significant for cerebrovascular disease events and all-cause death. Subgroup analyses by gender, race or ethnicity, history of AD, diabetes status, and estimated renal function showed consistent estimates across strata, with no significant differences between ezetimibe and statin use. In conclusion, ezetimibe appeared to have a protective effect on major AD events and all-cause death that was not significantly different from that observed for statin use.", 
    "219": "Statins are known to reduce plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations. Our goal was to define the mechanisms by which CRP was reduced by maximal dose atorvastatin.", 
    "220": "Eight subjects with combined hyperlipidemia (5 men and 3 postmenopausal women) were enrolled in a randomized, placebo-controlled double-blind, cross over study. Subjects underwent a 15-h primed-constant infusion with deuterated leucine after 8 weeks of placebo and 80\u00a0mg/day of atorvastatin. CRP was isolated from lipoprotein deficient plasma, (density\u00a0>\u00a01.21\u00a0g/ml) by affinity chromatography. Isotopic enrichment was determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Kinetic parameters were determined using compartmental modeling. Paired t test and Wilcoxon signed ranks test were used to compare differences between placebo and atorvastatin.", 
    "221": "Compared with placebo, atorvastatin decreased median CRP pool size by 28.4% (13.31\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.78 vs 10.26\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.93\u00a0mg; p\u00a0=\u00a00.16), associated with a median CRP fractional catabolic rate increase of 39.9% (0.34\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.06 vs 0.50\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.11\u00a0pools/day; p\u00a0=\u00a00.09), with no significant effect on median CRP production rate (0.050\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01 vs 0.049\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01\u00a0mg/kg/day; p\u00a0=\u00a00.78).", 
    "222": "Our data indicate that maximal doses of atorvastatin lower plasma CRP levels by substantially decreasing the median CRP plasma residence time from 2.94 days to 2.0 days, with no significant effect on the median CRP production rate.", 
    "223": "This study attempts to identify a structure among patient-related factors that could predict treatment adherence in statin patients, especially with regards to the necessity-concern framework.", 
    "224": "414 Swedish patients using statins completed a questionnaire about their health, treatment, locus of control, perception of necessity-concern and adherence. The data were handled using a structural equation modeling approach.", 
    "225": "Patients that reported high perceptions of necessity to treatment seemed to adhere well, and side effects appear to affect adherence negatively. Disease burden, cardiovascular disease experience and high locus of control seem to have mediating effects on adherence.", 
    "226": "This study provides support for the hypothesis that health- and treatment-related factors, as well as locus of control factors, are indirectly associated with treatment adherence via their association with mediating factor necessity.", 
    "227": "This study highlights the importance of considering patients' beliefs about medications, disease burden, experience of cardiovascular events and locus of control as these factors are associated with adherence behavior to statin treatment. This study also emphasizes more generally the importance of an approach targeting necessity and concern when communicating with and treating patients with lipid-lowering medication."
