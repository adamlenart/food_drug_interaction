Therefore, an effective secondary prevention - guided by the etiology and risk factors of stroke - is of particular importance to reduce stroke morbidity. Recently, two important studies (SPARCL and PRoFESS) analyzed the significance of statin therapy as well as the efficacy of different antiplatelet therapies for secondary stroke prevention. In this review we summarize the results and discuss the implications of these findings - including the most recent data - for stroke prevention.",

    "2": "We report delayed graft function occurring simultaneously in two kidney transplant recipients, aged 57-years-old and 39-years-old, who received renal allografts from the same deceased donor. The 62-year-old donor died of cardiac arrest during an asthmatic state. Renal-allograft biopsies performed in both kidney recipients because of delayed graft function revealed cholesterol-crystal embolism. An empiric statin therapy in addition to low-dose acetylsalicylic acid was initiated. After 10 and 6 hemodialysis sessions every 48 hours, respectively, both renal allografts started to function. Glomerular filtration rates at discharge were 26 ml/min/1.73m(2) and 23.9 ml/min/1.73m(2), and remained stable in follow-up examinations. Possible donor and surgical procedure-dependent causes for cholesterol-crystal embolism are discussed.",

    "4": "Despite the fact that statin treatment substantially reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, many treated patients still experience a high residual risk. Statins lower LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), with limited effects on other lipid parameters. Fibrates improve atherogenic dyslipidemia characterized by high triglyceride and/or low HDL cholesterol levels and elevated concentrations of small dense LDL particles, with or without high LDL-C levels. Fibrates decrease cardiovascular morbidity, especially in patients with the metabolic syndrome. The purpose of this review is to provide a rationale for the combined use of statins and fibrates in the management of patients with high residual cardiovascular risk related to atherogenic dyslipidemia and persisting after single therapy.", 
    "5": "A meta-analysis from 14 randomized trials conducted in high-risk patients reported that statin therapy is effective in reducing the proportional risk for major vascular events by 21% for each mmol/l lowering of LDL-C. However, on an average, 14% of patients still experienced an event despite being allocated to statin. Beyond LDL-C, other factors, including triglycerides, non-HDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B, have been identified as factors determining residual risk, and normalization of these parameters may further decrease cardiovascular disease in patients treated with statins. Data from fibrate trials indicate that these drugs are particularly effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity in patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia.",

    "7": "Subjects with increased cholesterol absorption might benefit more from statin therapy combined with a cholesterol absorption inhibitor. We assessed whether baseline cholesterol absorption markers were associated with response to ezetimibe/simvastatin therapy, in terms of LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering and cholesterol absorption inhibition, in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). In a posthoc analysis of the two-year ENHANCE trial, we assessed baseline cholesterol-adjusted campesterol (campesterol/TC) and sitosterol/TC ratios in 591 FH patients. Associations with LDL-C changes and changes in cholesterol absorption markers were evaluated by multiple regression analysis. No association was observed between baseline markers of cholesterol absorption and the extent of LDL-C response to ezetimibe/simvastatin therapy (beta = 0.020, P = 0.587 for campesterol/TC and beta<0.001, P = 0.992 for sitosterol/TC). Ezetimibe/simvastatin treatment reduced campesterol levels by 68% and sitosterol levels by 62%; reductions were most pronounced in subjects with the highest cholesterol absorption markers at baseline, the so-called high absorbers (P < 0.001). Baseline cholesterol absorption status does not determine LDL-C lowering response to ezetimibe/simvastatin therapy in FH, despite more pronounced cholesterol absorption inhibition in high absorbers. Hence, these data do not support the use of baseline absorption markers as a tool to determine optimal cholesterol lowering strategy in FH patients. However, due to the exploratory nature of any posthoc analysis, these results warrant further prospective evaluation in different populations.",

The combination of any 4 classes of drug were used in 65% of patients. Almost all patients who did not receive aspirin or a statin had clinical contraindications and were on alternative drugs. In about 12% of patients without an ACE inhibitor (or ARB) and 7% of patients without a beta blocker, no reason to withhold such treatment was identified. Branded drugs were used in 52% of patients; the most commonly prescribed being atorvastatin in 33%. Clinical reasons for using branded rather than generic drugs were identified in 13% of cases.", 
    "12": "Our results show a high rate of use of secondary preventive cardiac medications in patients undergoing coronary revascularization procedures, but the use of ACE inhibitors or beta blockers is still overlooked in about 1 in 10 patients. Branded drugs are prescribed in about half of all patients undergoing PCI and CABG, but in almost 90% of cases, a generic equivalent could have been used to achieve similar risk reduction.

However, it is commonly known, that their use, especially in high doses, can cause side effects. Our study reports the case of female patient who because of an episode of unstable angina underwent the percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of right coronary artery (RCA), and afterwards received the hypolipemic treatment of simvastatin in the dose of 80 mg/day. After the PCI she participated in the programme of early sanatory cardiac rehabilitation. After some days of her stay she started to notice the generalized muscle pain, that she initially linked with the intensification of exercise. Two days after finishing the rehabilitation programme she was admitted to our Department with the symptoms of generalized muscle injury. Laboratory test revealed very high serum level of creatine kinase, myoglobin and transaminases. Data obtained from anamnesis and results of laboratory testing enabled to diagnose myopathy being the result of hypolipemic treatment with high dose of simvastatin. After the treatment we observed gradual regression of muscle pain, and in 12th day of the stay in our clinic the normalization of biochemical parameters was stated. Our patient reported she was not informed about the possible complications of undertaken treatment. This case report emphasizes the necessity to precisely inform the patients about the possible drugs side effects.", 
    "14": "The \"statins,\" or hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA)-reductase inhibitors, are a generally safe class of drugs that are widely used throughout the world and are rarely associated with severe hepatotoxicity. In this article, two cases of severe hepatotoxicity attributed to statin use are presented. In addition, a detailed summary of previously published cases of statin hepatotoxicity and the risks and benefits of statins in patients with chronic liver disease are presented. Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) from statins typically presents with an acute hepatocellular liver injury pattern, although mixed or cholestatic injury patterns have also been reported. Nonspecific autoantibodies as well as clinical, laboratory, and histological features of an autoimmune-like hepatitis may be present in some patients with statin hepatotoxicity. Despite their widespread use, acute liver failure and death have rarely been reported in patients with statin hepatotoxicity. Multiple retrospective studies as well as a large prospective randomized controlled trial demonstrate that statins can safely be given to hyperlipidemic patients with compensated chronic liver disease.", 
    "15": "The obese Zucker rat (OZR) spontaneously develops hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, and microalbuminuria. In this study, the initial metabolic, functional, and glomerular pathology in young OZR fed with an atherogenic diet resembles the characteristics of metabolic syndrome. Hyperlipidemia and other metabolic derangement cause early glomerular damage in OZR by 10 weeks of age, before overt diabetes is developed. Consequently, the effects of potential interventions should also be evaluated at the young age. In OZR fed with an atherogenic high-fat diet, low (5 mg/kg) and high (20 mg/kg) dosages of rosuvastatin started at 5 weeks and maintained for 10 weeks induced a significant improvement in metabolic abnormalities, blood pressure, and renal function, including microalbuminuria. The low dose of rosuvastatin significantly decreased mesangial expansion, and the high dose exerted a marked protective effect on the development of both glomerular hypertrophy and mesangial expansion. The statin also attenuated the inflammatory expression in the kidney cortex.", 
    "16": "Statins are compounds prescribed to lower blood cholesterol in millions of patients worldwide. They act by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the mevalonate pathway that leads to the synthesis of farnesyl pyrophosphate, a precursor for cholesterol synthesis and the source of lipid moieties for protein prenylation. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans possesses a mevalonate pathway that lacks the branch leading to cholesterol synthesis, and thus represents an ideal organism to specifically study the noncholesterol roles of the pathway. Inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase in C. elegans using statins or RNAi leads to developmental arrest and loss of membrane association of a GFP-based prenylation reporter. The unfolded protein response (UPR) is also strongly activated, suggesting that impaired prenylation of small GTPases leads to the accumulation of unfolded proteins and ER stress. UPR induction was also observed upon pharmacological inhibition of farnesyl transferases or RNAi inhibition of a specific isoprenoid transferase (M57.2) and found to be dependent on both ire-1 and xbp-1 but not on pek-1 or atf-6, which are all known regulators of the UPR. The lipid stores and fatty acid composition were unaffected in statin-treated worms, even though they showed reduced staining with Nile red. We conclude that inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase or of farnesyl transferases induce the UPR by inhibiting the prenylation of M57.2 substrates, resulting in developmental arrest in C. elegans. These results provide a mechanism for the pleiotropic effects of statins and suggest that statins could be used clinically where UPR activation may be of therapeutic benefit.", 
    "17": "Subnormal plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) constitute a major cardiovascular risk factor; raising low HDL-C levels may therefore reduce the residual cardiovascular risk that frequently presents in dyslipidaemic subjects despite statin therapy. Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), a key modulator not only of the intravascular metabolism of HDL and apolipoprotein (apo) A-I but also of triglyceride (TG)-rich particles and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), mediates the transfer of cholesteryl esters from HDL to pro-atherogenic apoB-lipoproteins, with heterotransfer of TG mainly from very low-density lipoprotein to HDL. Cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity is elevated in the dyslipidaemias of metabolic disease involving insulin resistance and moderate to marked hypertriglyceridaemia, and is intimately associated with premature atherosclerosis and high cardiovascular risk. Cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibition therefore presents a preferential target for elevation of HDL-C and reduction in atherosclerosis. This review appraises recent evidence for a central role of CETP in the action of current lipid-modulating agents with HDL-raising potential, i.e. statins, fibrates, and niacin, and compares their mechanisms of action with those of pharmacological agents under development which directly inhibit CETP. New CETP inhibitors, such as dalcetrapib and anacetrapib, are targeted to normalize HDL/apoA-I levels and anti-atherogenic activities of HDL particles. Further studies of these CETP inhibitors, in particular in long-term, large-scale outcome trials, will provide essential information on their safety and efficacy in reducing residual cardiovascular risk.", 
    "18": "The effects of statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase-HMGR-inhibitors) on the inflammatory response remain unclear. HMGR is implicated in the mevalonate pathway, directly upstream of cholesterol biosynthesis. We studied the impairment by this pathway of cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and THP-1 cells. The aim was to identify a specific cytokine \"signature\" of cells under simvastatin treatment in order to link pharmacological inhibition of the mevalonate pathway and inflammation.", 
    "19": "Normal human PBMCs and THP-1 cells were cultured with inhibitors of HMGR (simvastatin), geranylgeranyltransferase (GGTI-298), farnesyltransferase (FTI-277), and/or caspase-1 (Z-VAD(Ome)-FMK). Following culture, cytokine production, caspase-1 activity, IL-1beta mRNA and Rac-1 activity were determined.", 
    "20": "Pharmacological inhibition of the mevalonate pathway specifically enhanced the release of IL-1alpha, IL-1beta and IL-18 and inhibited IL-1ra production by LPS-activated PBMCs and THP-1 cells. Simvastatin did not modify pro-IL-1beta expression, but enhanced caspase-1 activity, the enzyme responsible for IL-1beta and IL-18 maturation. GGTI-298 also enhanced IL-1-family cytokine production, showing that geranylgeranylation is involved in caspase-1 activation. Additionally, simvastatin enhanced Rac-1 activity.", 
    "21": "Pharmacological inhibition of the mevalonate pathway by statins highlighted the specific induction of the proinflammatory cytokines of the IL-1 family whose maturation is either directly (i.e. IL-1beta and IL-18), or indirectly (i.e. IL-1alpha) dependant on caspase-1.", 
    "22": "The mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD), including hyperimmunoglobulinemia D periodic fever syndrome (HIDS) and the more severe mevalonic aciduria are rare, autosomal recessive, autoinflammatory diseases belonging to the hereditary periodic fever (HPF) family. Other members include: familial mediterranean fever (FMF), the cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) and TNFR-associated periodic syndromes (TRAPS). MKD is caused by mutations in the gene encoding mevalonate kinase (MK), an enzyme of the cholesterol pathway, leading to its inactivation. The molecular mechanisms linking MKD and abnormalities of isoprenoid biosynthesis to cytokine production and inflammation have yet to be fully elucidated. Statins, which are extensively prescribed for lowering cholesterol, are potent inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, the enzyme directly upstream of MK. In this review, we discuss recent reports demonstrating that in vitro inhibition of the mevalonate pathway by statins specifically increases the production, by activated monocytes, of cytokines of the IL-1 family, by enhancing caspase-1 activity, the enzyme responsible for IL-1beta and IL-18 maturation. The molecular mechanisms involve geranylgeranylation and the enhancement of the activity of G proteins such as Rac-1. Interestingly, activated fibroblasts from MKD patients secrete more IL-1beta than fibroblasts from healthy donors. Taken together, these data highlight the specific enhancement of the IL-1 family of cytokines, the maturation of which is caspase-1-dependent in MKD. Finally, the spectacular decrease in febrile attacks in patients with severe HIDS under IL-1 receptor antagonist (anakinra) treatment, reinforces this hypothesis. Deregulated caspase-1 activation could be responsible for the inflammatory component of MKD, thereby mechanistically linking MKD to FMF and CAPS through cytokines of the IL-1 family.", 
    "23": "The morphological manifestations of the pleiotropic effect of statins on the human aortic intima in atherosclerosis were studied. The aortic fragments from males aged 45-65 years, obtained at aortocoronary bypass surgery, served as a material. The thickness of the aortic intima and its levels of macrophages, smooth muscle cells (SMC), collagen fibers, and glycosaminoglycans (GAG) were measured in patients treated and untreated with statins. The macrophages were histochemically visualized, by detecting the activity of acid phosphatase, SMC-NADP-diaphorase, the collagen fibers were stained by the Masson procedure; GAG was stained with toluidine blue. The above structural components were quantified by computer-aid morphometric technique (Photoshop-7). The findings have indicated that statin therapy causes the following vascular wall changes: a 20% decrease in the aortic intimal thickness; a considerable reduction in the macrophage-occupied intimal area (by 2 times in primary extracellular lipoidosis, by 2.7 times in the lipid spots, and by 15.3% in the mature lipid spots), and lower levels of collagen fibers (by 15.1 in the lipid spots and by 18.4% in the mature lipid spots), an insignificant reduction in GAG), and larger numbers of SMC (by 20.3% in primary extracellular lipoidosis, by 17.6 and 20.4% in the lipid spots of varying maturity). The findings suggest that atherosclerosis regresses under the action of statins.", 
    "24": "Statin therapy reduces blood cholesterol and lipids and exerts an anti-inflammatory effect. Certain statins bind adhesion molecules, including functional leukocytic antigen-1, and therefore block their interaction with T lymphocytes and macrophages expressing the counter-receptor intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Quantitation of endothelium-adherent T cells and macrophages revealed much smaller numbers of these cells in patients receiving statins. The authors consider that the lower count of T lymphocytes and macrophages in the upper layers of the intima and atherosclerotic plaques may facilitate the conversion of unstable to stable plaques, which reduces the risk of atherosclerotic plaque rupture and resultant vascular thrombosis.", 
    "25": "From the previously examined patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD), the authors formed two groups in whom an original method was used to detect the abnormal lipid-oxidizing anti-Chlamydia antibodies abzymes that increased the serum concentration of malondialdehyde. The effects of the statin rosuvastatin and the antioxidant licopin on abzymes were comparatively studied. Despite the positive impact of therapy with rosuvastatin on lipid metabolism of IHD patients, the agent exerted no effect on the rate of lipid peroxidation and the activity of lipid-oxidizing antibodies. Licopin intake caused statistically significant lipid metabolic changes in patients with IHD. The antioxidant activity of licopin neutralized the pathogenic effect of lipid-oxidizing anti-Chlamydia abzymes.",

It has been reported that, in humans, CyA is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A or excreted by P-glycoprotein/multidrug resistant protein (MRP) 2. Pravastatin, a statin, is used to treat hyperlipidemia and has also been reported to be excreted primarily by MRP2. We observed an increased blood CyA level in a patient following pravastatin administration, suggesting the possibility that CyA interacted with the pravastatin via MRP2. The aim of the study reported here was to investigate the effects of pravastation on CyA transport via MRP2 using a human colon adenocarcinoma (Caco-2) monolayer model system.",

After a 30-min incubation, calcein was effluxed from the Caco-2 cells and the level in the culture medium was assayed. CyA was then added to the tissue culture medium of the Caco-2 cells, and pravastatin (0.1, 0.5, 1.0 mM) was added to the apical and basolateral sides. After a 30-min incubation, CyA was effluxed from the Caco-2 cells, and the level in the culture medium was assayed.",

The primary endpoint was the occurrence of postoperative AF; secondary endpoints were major adverse in-hospital cardiac and cerebrovascular events and identification of variables predicting postoperative AF. Atorvastatin significantly reduced the incidence of postoperative AF and the postoperative peak C-reactive protein (CRP) level vs placebo (14% vs 34%, P=0.009; 126.5 +/-22.3 vs 145.2 +/-31.6 mg/L, P<0.0001). Logistic regression analysis showed preoperative atorvastatin treatment was an independent factor associated with a significant reduction in postoperative AF (odds ratio (OR) 0.219, P=0.005), whereas a high postoperative CRP level was associated with increased risk (OR 2.011, P=0.013).",

Median progression-free survival for patients with normal LDL levels was 27 months, compared to 12 months for patients with elevated LDL (p=0.0004). Overall disease-specific survival was longer for patients with normal LDL levels (59 months) compared to those with elevated LDL (51 months, p=0.04). Multivariate analysis indicated that LDL retained significance as an independent predictor of survival, after controlling for age, stage, grade, and suboptimal cytoreduction (p=0.003).",

Statin, an inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis, is the first-choice drug to reduce low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) for patients with hypercholesterolemia, due to its strong effect to lower the circulating LDL-C levels. Because a high dose of statins cause concern about rhabdomyolysis, it is sometimes difficult to achieve the guideline-recommended levels of LDL-C in high-risk patients with hypercholesterolemia treated with statin monotherapy. Ezetimibe has been reported to reduce LDL-C safely with both monotherapy and combination therapy with statins.",

Ezetimibe add-on therapy reduced LDL-C by 24% compared with baseline (p < 0.005), with 13 patients (93%) reaching their LDL cholesterol goals. Of the Ezetimibe add-on therapy significantly improved not only LDL-C, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), and apolipoprotein (apo)B levels, but also reduced levels of triglyceride (TG), the ratio of LDL/HDL-C, the ratio of apoB/apoA-I, and a biomarker for oxidative stress (d-ROMs). Furthermore, ezetimibe add-on therapy improved vascular endothelial function in high-risk patients with hypercholesterolemia.",

In recent years, statins have also been reported to have other biological activities and numerous potential therapeutic uses. Natural statins are lovastatin and compactin, while pravastatin is derived from the latter by biotransformation. Simvastatin, the second leading statin in the market, is a lovastatin semisynthetic derivative. Lovastatin is mainly produced by Aspergillus terreus strains, and compactin by Penicillium citrinum. Lovastatin and compactin are produced industrially by liquid submerged fermentation, but can also be produced by the emerging technology of solid-state fermentation, that displays some advantages. Advances in the biochemistry and genetics of lovastatin have allowed the development of new methods for the production of simvastatin. This lovastatin derivative can be efficiently synthesized from monacolin J (lovastatin without the side chain) by a process that uses the Aspergillus terreus enzyme acyltransferase LovD. In a different approach, A. terreus was engineered, using combinational biosynthesis on gene lovF, so that the resulting hybrid polyketide synthase is able to in vivo synthesize 2,2-dimethylbutyrate (the side chain of simvastatin). The resulting transformant strains can produce simvastatin (instead of lovastatin) by direct fermentation.",

Moreover, she develops simultaneously nephrotic proteinuria and microhematuria as a result of membranous nephropathy. The treatment with gluten-free diet and other conservative measures (ACEI and statin) is followed by clinical improvement and simultaneous decrease of tissue antitransglutaminase IgA-antibodies and complete remission of proteinuria.

Although significant advances have been made with respect to the ventilatory management of patients with ALI/ARDS with proven beneficial effects on outcomes, pharmacologic therapies remain nonexistent. Because the cardinal feature of ALI/ARDS is an increase in lung vascular permeability, often precipitated by an exuberant inflammatory response with subsequent endothelial barrier disruption, strategies aimed at promoting endothelial barrier function could serve as novel therapies in this setting. We have identified several promising agonists in this regard including sphingosine 1-phosphate, activated protein C, and statins, a class of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors. These agonists all have in common the ability to directly mediate endothelial cell signaling and induce characteristic actin cytoskeletal rearrangement leading to endothelial cell barrier protection. Our in vitro findings have been extended to animal models of ALI/ARDS and suggest that effective pharmacologic therapies for patients with ALI/ARDS may soon be available.",

    "55": "Statins belong to a class of drugs well known for their ability to reduce circulating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. In addition to cholesterol lowering, they also exhibit potential antiinflammatory and antioxidant properties, suggesting that tissues other than liver may be targeted by statins to exert their beneficial metabolic effects. Adipocytes have received very little attention as a potential target of these drugs, possibly because adipocytes are not a major source of biosynthetic cholesterol. Here, we examine the effects of simvastatin on the secretory pathway, inflammation, and cellular metabolism of adipocytes as well as on whole-body insulin sensitivity. We find that statins have a selective effect on the secretion of the insulin-sensitizing adipokine adiponectin by reducing circulating levels of the high-molecular-weight form of adiponectin specifically with a concomitant increase in intracellular adiponectin levels. However, these effects on adiponectin do not translate into changes in metabolism or whole-body insulin sensitivity, potentially due to additional antiinflammatory properties of statins. In addition, ob/ob mice treated with statins have reduced adiposity and an altered ultrastructure of the plasma membrane with respect to caveolar histology. Our data demonstrate that statins have major effects on the cellular physiology of the adipocyte on multiple levels.",

Of the 577 patients, 302 (52%) were treated with statins. Perioperative myocardial infarction (MI) occurred in 18 of 302 patients (6%) treated with statins and in 38 of 275 patients (14%) not treated with statins (p=0.001). Two-year mortality occurred in 18 of 302 patients (6%) treated with statins and in 43 of 275 patients (16%) not treated with statins (p=0.0002). Perioperative MI or mortality occurred in 34 of 302 patients (11%) treated with statins and in 74 of 275 patients (27%) not treated with statins (p<0.0001). Stepwise Cox regression analysis showed that significant independent prognostic factors for perioperative MI or death were use of statins (risk ratio=RR=0.43, p<0.0001), use of beta blockers (RR=0.55, p=0.002), carotid endarterectomy (RR=0.60, p=0.009), and diabetes (RR=1.5, p=0.045).

The utilization of atorvastatin fell substantially from 36.5% of all statins in 2002 to 10.7% by the end of 2007 following restrictions on its prescribing to patients not achieving target lipid levels with, for instance, generic simvastatin. The combined initiatives reduced expenditure per DDD for the PPIs and the statins by 41 and 60%, respectively, in 2007 versus 2001 levels.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of absorbable collagen sponge (ACS) as a carrier for RSV to enhance bone formation in critical-size cortical bone defects adjacent to titanium implants. ACS, treated with different concentrations of RSV (R1 = 8.7 + or - 1.8 microg; R2 = 52.0 + or - 4.4 microg; R3 = 259.1 + or - 8.8 microg) or phosphate-buffered saline alone, were placed into the bone marrow through a defect made in the proximal tibial cortical bone of New Zealand White rabbits. One empty defect (SHAM) served as an internal control in each animal. After a healing time of 4 weeks, a concentration-dependent increase of alkaline phosphatase activity in ACS treated with RSV was detected in the bone fluid after removing the implants. In addition, a significant concentration-dependent increase in BMP-2 mRNA levels was found in the cortical bone tissue adjacent to the RSV-treated ACS. The cortical architecture of bone defects analysed by micro-computed tomography showed a trend towards higher bone volume in the ACS+R1 group compared with SHAM, which was accompanied by an increase in the bone mineral density. Evaluation of histological sections showed new bone formation in ACS treated with RSV but not in untreated ACS. These results indicate that RSV, when administered locally in bone, may have a potential effect in stimulating bone formation.",

Recent clinical trials have indicated that statins significantly reduce stroke risk in patients with vascular disease. A meta-analysis of randomized trials of statins in combination with other preventive strategies, involving 165,792 individuals, showed that each 1-mmol/l (39 mg/dl) decrease in LDL-cholesterol equates to a reduction in relative risk for stroke of 21.1 (95% CI: 6.3-33.5; p = 0.009). It is not known whether these findings might be due to the cholesterol-reduction effect of statins or to the pleiotropic effects of statins, such as improved endothelial function, decreased platelet aggregability and reduced vascular inflammation. In the secondary prevention of stroke, The Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction of Cholesterol Levels study found that treatment with atorvastatin reduced the risk of recurrent cerebrovascular events in patients with recent stroke or transient ischemic attack but no history of heart disease.", 
    "93": "The devastating consequences of stroke, both in terms of morbidity and mortality, and the economic implications it has worldwide, coupled with a growing knowledge regarding its pathophysiology, has led to the development of novel therapeutic strategies in recent years that have had an enormous impact on clinical practice and the outcome of stroke patients. While thrombolysis is regarded as the most important of these developments, its relatively narrow therapeutic window and complexity of administration imply that only a minority of stroke patients can benefit from it. Among other strategies, in an attempt to overcome this limitation, research has focused on the development of neuroprotection aimed to salvage ischemic brain tissue by means complementary to reperfusion. Among these approaches, the use of statins stands out, which, by inhibiting the HMG CoA reductase, interfere with the formation of isoprenoid intermediates in the biosynthesis of cholesterol, and have been shown to have a positive impact in both the incidence and outcome of acute stroke. The main results of animal models, observational studies, clinical trials and opinion articles available in the medical literature covering the effect of statins on acute brain ischemia will be reviewed in order to provide in-depth information regarding their mode of action and current evidence regarding their potential benefits for ischemic stroke patients.",

Using flow cytometry and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), the rhabdomyosarcoma cell line TE671 and primary cultured skeletal muscle cells (SKMC) were investigated for MHC I expression after incubation with different statins and/or interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). TE671 and SKMC express MHC I in the untreated condition. Statins alone reduced the expression of MHC I in SKMC and had no effect on MHC I in TE671 cells. Statins potentiated the MHC I-inducing effect of IFN-gamma in TE671, but not in SKMC, neither at the protein level nor at the mRNA level. The increased muscle MHC I expression in statin-induced myopathy might not be induced directly by statins themselves.",

Twenty-five patients fulfilled our inclusion criteria. Twenty-four patients required multiple immunosuppressive agents. Fifteen patients relapsed after being tapered off immunosuppressive therapy. Exposure to statins prior to onset was significantly higher in patients with necrotizing myopathy (82%) as compared to those with dermatomyositis (18%), polymyositis (24%), and inclusion-body myositis (38%) seen in the same time period. The lack of improvement following discontinuation of statins, the need for immunosuppressive therapy, and frequent relapse when treatment was tapered suggest an immune-mediated etiology for this rare, statin-associated necrotizing myopathy.", 
    "96": "Several large statin trials and meta-analyses have demonstrated a reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Some trials have also highlighted the significance of residual cardiovascular risk after treatment of LDL-C to target levels. This reflects the complex nature of residual cardiovascular risk. This residual risk is partially due to low HDL-C and high triglycerides (TG) despite achievement of LDL goals with statin therapy. The NCEP ATP III guidelines reported that low HDL-C is a significant and an independent risk factor for coronary heart disease (CHD) and is inversely related to CHD. Epidemiologic studies have also shown a similar inverse relationship of HDL-C with CHD. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) may directly participate in the anti-atherogenic process by promoting efflux of cholesterol of the foam cells of atherogenic lesions. Many studies have demonstrated multiple anti-atherogenic actions of HDL-C and its role in promoting efflux of cholesterol from the foam cells. The residual risk by increased TG with or without low HDL-C can be assessed by calculating non-HDL-C and a reduction in TG results in decreased CHD.",

Our aim was to investigate the effects of atorvastatin on key components of inflammatory angiogenesis in the murine sponge model. Polyester-polyurethane sponges, used as a framework for fibrovascular tissue growth, were implanted in Swiss mice. Atorvastatin (0.6, 3 mg/kg/day) was given orally for 8 days in drinking water. The implants collected at day 9 postimplantation were processed for the assessment of hemoglobin, myeloperoxidase (MPO), N-acetylglucosaminidase (NAG) and collagen. Relevant inflammatory, angiogenic and fibrogenic cytokines were also determined. Atorvastatin treatment resulted in significant decrease in sponge vascularization (Hb content) and in VEGF levels at both doses. Neutrophil influx (MPO activity) was not affected by the compound whereas macrophage recruitment (NAG activity) was inhibited, suggesting a degree of selectivity by atorvastatin for this cell population. The level of CCL2 (MCP1-JE) was decreased only with 0.6 mg/kg. Atorvastatin was also able to reduce collagen deposition and the levels of transforming growth factor (TGF-beta1) intraimplant, dose-dependently. The inhibitory function of atorvastatin on multiple parameters of main components of inflammatory angiogenesis revealed in this study is clearly associated with the modulatory effects of HMG-CoA reductase on VEGF, TNF-alpha and TGF-beta1 production.",

We investigated the mechanisms of the perivascular adipocyte-derived relaxation factor (PVRF) by using isolated rat's aortic rings and isometric contraction measurements. We found that contraction of the thoracic aorta induced by phenylephrine was significantly attenuated in the presence of PVAT from normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY group) or the spontaneously hypertensive rats treated with atorvastatin (SHR-A group, atorvastatin 50mg/kg/day), whereas this effect was not observed in the thoracic aortic rings from the control SHR (SHR group). Transferring the solution incubated with PVAT-intact thoracic aorta to PVAT-free thoracic aorta, it induced a remarkable relaxation response in the WKY but not in the control SHR. Tetraethylammoniumchloride (TEA) could block the above relaxation. It was also shown that the PVRF function was likely, depending on the extracellular [Ca(2+)]; the anti-contractile effect of PVAT could be reduced by the inhibitor of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent potassium channels, glibenclamide, and could be reduced by the inhibitor of cyclooxygenase by indomethacin. We thus infer that the PVAT function was distorted in hypertension rats, and the lipid-lowering treatment with atorvastatin could restore the PVAT function. The function of the PVRF may involve the Ca(2+)-activated potassium channels, the ATP-dependent potassium channels in vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC), and the release of PVRF from PVAT may involve prostaglandins (PGs) and the calcium metabolism. These results provide an insight into the pathological mechanisms of hypertension development, and indicate that the PVAT may be a potential new target for the hypertensive therapy.", 
    "107": "Atorvastatin, being one of the most commonly used antihyperlipidemic agents, is prescribed frequently by physicians all over the world but only a few data is available stating its effect in different ethnic population, more so from this part of India. The present study was designed focusing mainly on local population and was planned to determine plasma level of atorvastatin 10 mg and its effect on lipid profile in newly diagnosed hyperlipidemic patients attending Medical OPD of Shri Krishna Hospital, Karamsad (Gujarat). Study-I was carried out in 6 healthy volunteers to determine t(max) after single dose of atorvastatin 10 mg under fasting conditions, on the basis of which Study-II was conducted in 15 patients, collecting blood samples at a particular time (i.e t(max) of Study-I) after administration of atorvastatin 10 mg/day on day 1 as well as on the last day after 8 weeks of treatment. The plasma concentrations were determined by RP-HPLC system. Atorvastatin 10 mg/day for 8 weeks with a plasma level range (7.45, 12.08) ng/mL significantly (P < 0.05) reduced all the parameters of lipid profile from the study population. The mean decrease in HDL-C triggers a question on the effect of atorvastatin on HDL-C, which requires further study on a larger population of our country.", 
    "108": "It has been proposed that hyperlipidemia contributes to the progression of renal diseases, and conversely, that treatment with statins decreases the progressive decline of renal function. Increased glomerular pressure has been found to cause endothelial dysfunction of glomerular capillaries. However, the potential renoprotective effects of statin treatment have not been fully elucidated and so far no study has analyzed the effects of statin treatment on intrarenal hemodynamics.",

Renal plasma flow(RPF) and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) were determined by constant input clearance technique with p-aminohippurate (PAH) and inulin. Glomerular hydrostatic pressure (Pglom) and resistances of the afferent(RA) and efferent arterioles (RE) were calculated according to the model originally established by Gomez.",

    "112": "Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have significantly increased risks of cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality. Dyslipidemia is a common disorder in CKD patients. CKD patients have a different lipid profile with increased atherogenic lipid fractions, and serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels may underestimate the atherogenic effect of LDL-C in these patients. Dyslipidemia may contribute to the increased CV morbidity and mortality, and to the progression of kidney disease in CKD patients. Currently, statins are the pharmacologic intervention of first choice, if lifestyle changes fail adequately to lower LDL-C levels in the setting of normal or moderately elevated triglycerides. Statins have been extensively studied in a large variety of patient populations and have proven efficacy in the treatment of dyslipidemia, and in reducing CV mortality. Although much evidence supports the CV benefits of statins in patients with normal renal function, there are contradictory results for the beneficial effect of statin therapy on CV morbidity and mortality in CKD patients. While post hoc subgroup analyses of multiple randomized trials support statin use in early CKD patients, the only randomized trial conducted in diabetic dialysis patients found no evidence of benefit in overall mortality. Post transplant there is some definite CV benefit, albeit in a patient cohort selected to be at reduced CV risk by virtue of being eligible for organ transplant. The results from the AURORA and SHARP studies are awaited anxiously.",

    "114": "Individuals who were dispensed statins regularly were identified from Manitoba's population-based prescription drug database and followed up until diagnosis of CRC, migration out of province, death, or December 2005. The incidence of CRC in this group was compared with that among individuals who were never dispensed statins. Stratified analysis was performed to determine the risk after 5 years of regular statin use. Multivariate Poisson regression models were used to adjust for potential confounding by age, sex, and history of diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, coronary heart disease, lower gastrointestinal endoscopy, resective colorectal surgery, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, hormone replacement therapy (among women), and median household income. The dose effect was evaluated in defined daily dose units.",

In all, 10,287 (49% males; 51% females) long-term (>or=5 years) regular statin users were followed up for up to 5 additional years. In multivariate analysis, the incidence rate ratio (IRR) of CRC among those dispensed statins regularly compared with those who were never dispensed statins (n=377,532) was 1.13 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02-1.25). The CRC risk among the long-term regular statin users was similar to that for individuals never dispensed statins (IRR, 0.89; 95% CI: 0.70-1.13). A statistically nonsignificant risk reduction was observed among high-dose long-term regular statin users.",

    "117": "The objective of this study was to investigate the gene expression signature of monocyte/macrophages and the pleiotropic effects of atorvastatin on monocytes in atherosclerotic patients. Forty patients with coronary heart diseases were randomly assigned to double-blind therapy with either 20 or 80 mg per day of atorvastatin. Follow-up visits occurred at weeks 6 and 12, including complete chemistry and lipid analyses and quantification of 14 target genes in monocytes. After 12 weeks of therapy, both groups gained beneficial alterations in lipid profiles. Both groups experienced significant reductions in gene expression of lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2, CD13, leptin receptor, matrix metalloproteases-1, legumain, and prolyl oligopeptidase after 12 weeks of therapy. Only tumor protein 53 was increased in the atorvastatin 80-mg group. Moreover, nonsignificant interactions between dosage and duration of therapy were found. The pleiotropic effects of statins in atherosclerotic patients include increased expression of genes involved in apoptosis of monocyte/macrophage, inhibition of inflammatory responses, antioxidant properties, prevention of foam cell formation, and stabilization of atherosclerotic plaques. This property fuels potential clinical significance.", 
    "118": "The medical treatment of patients with symptomatic intracranial atherosclerotic disease (ICAD) is directed toward reducing the risk of new ischemic events. The overall strategy is divided into: (1) prevention of occurrence of intraluminal thrombus, with or without embolism; (2) plaque stabilization and regression; and (3) management of atherogenic risk factors. In patients with ICAD, short-term and long-term anticoagulation (compared with aspirin) has not shown to be beneficial. The current guidelines recommend that aspirin monotherapy, the combination of aspirin and extended release dipyridamole, and clopidogrel monotherapy (rather than oral anticoagulants) are all acceptable options in patients with noncardioembolic ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack. The findings of another pilot trial suggest that symptomatic ICAD is a dynamic lesion and cilostazol may prevent its progression. Overall, the subgroup analysis from randomized trials, provide evidence about benefit of aggressive atherogenic risk factor management among patients with ICAD. Current guidelines recommend statin therapy with intensive lipid-lowering effects for patients with atherosclerotic ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack with or without known coronary artery disease to reduce the risk of stroke and cardiovascular events.",

Thus, we evaluated the association between plasma cholesterol and prostate cancer. We conducted a prospective study in the CLUE II cohort of Washington County, MD. Included were 6,816 male county residents aged 35+ years old who did not have a cancer diagnosis at baseline in 1989. Plasma cholesterol, measured enzymatically at baseline, was categorized by clinical cutpoints. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for total (n = 438) and high-grade (Gleason sum > or =7, n = 137) prostate cancer. Compared to men with high cholesterol (> or =240 mg/dl), men with desirable (<200 mg/dl) or borderline (200 to <240 mg/dl) levels were less likely to develop high-grade prostate cancer, particularly when restricting to organ-confined cases (HR: 0.68, 95% CI 0.40-1.18; P trend = 0.12) and among men with higher BMI (HR: 0.36, 95% CI 0.16-0.79; P trend = 0.02). Results were unchanged after excluding cholesterol-lowering drug users. Cholesterol was not associated with total prostate cancer. Our study supports two prior ones suggesting that cholesterol influences risk of high-grade prostate cancer, and indirectly supports the hypothesis that cholesterol-lowering is a mechanism by which statins are protective.", 
    "125": "The influence of the dietary flavonol quercetin on the pharmacokinetics of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin was investigated in pigs. Simvastatin (0.25mg/kg body weight) was orally administered to six pigs either without or with quercetin (10mg/kg). In addition, simvastatin was administered to three pigs that had received a diet supplemented with the flavonol over a period of 1 week. Daily quercetin intake was 10mg/kg in these animals. Co-ingestion of quercetin with the statin did not alter area under the concentration time curve (AUC(0-->infinity)), time to achieve maximum plasma concentration (t(max)) or half-life (t(1/2)) of simvastatin. However, there was a trend towards a reduction of the maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) of simvastatin when quercetin was administered concomitantly (P=0.06). As compared to controls, AUC(0-->infinity) of simvastatin was significantly decreased after feeding the quercetin-supplemented diet for 1 week. The plasma ratio of simvastatin and its acid metabolite was neither altered by the concomitant quercetin ingestion nor by feeding of the flavonol over a period of 1 week. We conclude that chronic ingestion of high doses of the flavonol quercetin will decrease the bioavailability of simvastatin to a significant extent.",

    "129": "Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a medical emergency, which has been newly termed as \"acute cerebrovascular syndrome\" (ACVS). TIA is often ignored or unrecognized by patients or their families since its symptoms are naturally subsided without any treatment. TIA is also usually underestimated or nonprioritized by physicians because it is regarded merely as a minor stroke. However, stroke risk is very high in patients early after TIA. Therefore, rapid evaluation followed by immediate treatment is essential in TIA patients. TIA patients should be directly referred to stroke specialists in TIA clinics to consider hospitalization for specific emergent treatments. Early stroke risk is especially high in TIA patients with a high ABCD2 score of 4 or more (A age over 60 years [1 point]: B blood pressure > 140/90 mmHg [1 point]: C Clinical features, including unilateral weakness [2 points] and speech disturbance without weakness [1 point] D2: Diabetes [1 point] and Duration of symptoms [1 point for < 60 min and 2 points for > 60 min]), acute ischemic lesions on diffusion weighted image, > 50% carotid stenosis, severe intracranial artery stenosis, microembolic signals on transcranial Doppler, atrial fibrillation, or hypercoagulable states. It has been reported that immediate starting treatment with statins, antiplatelet agents, and antihypertensives substantially reduces the risk of stroke within 90 days after TIA. US National Stroke Association guidelines recommend assessments using computed tomography (CT)/ CT angiography (CTA), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)/MR angiography (MRA), and carotid ultrasonography as well as immediate starting antiplatelet therapy in patients with non-cardioembolic TIA or oral anticoagulant therapy in patients with cardioembolic TIA within 24 hours during the first week after TIA. A large international, multicenter cooperative, observational study (TIA Registry. Org.) on 5,000 patients with TIA or minor stroke within 7 days of onset is being initiated.

A hypolipidemic effect of atorvastatin was observed in mice with mild lipemia, but not in those with severe lipemia. In both mild and severe lipemia cases, the serum CTO activity was increased upon the combined administration of atorvastatin and Triton WR 1339, correlating with cholesterol and triglyceride concentration. The total serum MMP activity decreased only in experiments with atorvastatin administration to intact mice. In mice with experimental lipemia induced by Triton WR 1339, the administration of atorvastatin also increased the ALT and AST activity in the blood serum.",

It is associated with a high cardiovascular risk that can only partially be explained by its components. There is evidence that low-grade inflammation and high oxidative stress add to this risk. Oxidized LDL, a marker of lipoprotein-associated oxidative stress, is an emerging cardiovascular risk factor. In this review, we demonstrate that the metabolic syndrome exacerbates oxidized LDL in a feedback loop. We introduce molecular mechanisms underlying this loop. Finally, we demonstrate that weight loss and statin treatment lower metabolic syndrome factors associated with a reduction of oxidized LDL. The current data warrant further investigation into the role of lifestyle and therapeutic interventions that inhibit tissue-associated oxidation of LDL in the prevention of the metabolic syndrome.",

After abdominal aortic balloon injury, 75 rabbits were fed a 1% cholesterol diet for 10 wk and were then divided into five groups for 8-wk treatment: control group, low-dose TXL group, moderate-dose TXL group, high-dose TXL group, and high-dose simvastatin group. At the end of week 16, an adenovirus containing p53 was injected into the abdominal aortic plaques. Two weeks later, plaque rupture was induced by pharmacological triggering. The incidence of plaque rupture in all treatment groups (14.3%, 7.1%, 7.7%, and 7.1%) was significantly lower than that in control group (73.3%; P>0.01). TXL dose-dependently lowered serum lipid levels and inhibited systemic inflammation. Corrected acoustic intensity and fibrous cap thickness of the aortic plaques were significantly increased, whereas plaque area, plaque burden, vulnerable index, and expression of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) receptor 1, matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1), MMP-3, tissue inhibitor of MMP 1, and NF-kappaB in plaques were markedly reduced in all treatment groups when compared with the control group. Similar to high-dose simvastatin group, high-dose TXL group exhibited a low serum level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and ox-LDL, a low expression level of systemic and local inflammatory factors and a low plaque vulnerability index, with no differences in the incidence of plaque rupture among all treatment groups. TXL dose-dependently enhances the stability of vulnerable plaques and prevents plaques from rupture.

Therefore, concerns have been raised regarding their external validity. For the present study we evaluated the MITRA Plus registry and included 20,175 patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction. We defined RCT-ineligible patients as patients fulfilling >or=1 of the following criteria: age >or=75 years, prehospital delay >12 hours, prehospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation, cardiogenic shock, impaired renal function, and previous stroke. Those patients (n = 9,369, 46.4%) were compared to patients eligible for enrollment in RCTs (n = 11,806, 53.6%). Ineligible patients were older (p <0.0001), more often were women (p <0.0001), and more often had concomitant diseases (p <0.0001). Ineligible patients less often received early reperfusion therapy (p <0.0001), aspirin (p <0.0001), clopidogrel (p <0.0001), and statins (p <0.0001). Ineligible patients had a higher hospital mortality (20.1% vs 4.9%; p <0.0001) and a higher rate of nonfatal strokes (1.5% vs 0.4%, p <0.0001) compared to eligible patients. Early reperfusion therapy (thrombolysis and/or percutaneous coronary intervention [PCI]) in ineligible patients was associated with a significant decrease of hospital mortality (odds ratio 0.62, 95% confidence interval 0.49 to 0.79), with primary PCI being more effective than thrombolytic therapy (odds ratio 0.52, 95% confidence interval 0.41 to 0.65). In conclusion, about 50% of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction seen in clinical practice are usually excluded from RCTs. Hospital mortality in those patients is very high. Primary PCI improves the prognosis and is therefore the preferred reperfusion strategy in these patients.", 
    "145": "The extent to which atorvastatin treatment affects LDL size, LDL subfraction levels and remnant-like particle cholesterol (RLP-C) was determined in type 2 diabetes. We also compared LDL size and RLP-C in relation to guideline cut-off values for LDL cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein (apo) B. Changes in LDL size and RLP-C were determined in fasting plasma from type 2 diabetic patients after 30 weeks administration of atorvastatin (10 mg daily, n=65; 80 mg daily, n=62) or placebo (n=58). LDL subfraction cholesterol was measured in 74 participants. Atorvastatin lowered LDL cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, apo B and RLP-C (P<0.001 for all at each dose) and LDL mean peak particle diameter remained unchanged. Atorvastatin treatment decreased cholesterol concentrations in all LDL subfractions (P<0.001 for each dose). RLP-C at follow-up was lower in those patients achieving the non-HDL cholesterol or the apo B guideline targets (P<0.01), but the LDL cholesterol cut-off value failed to discriminate. In conclusion, atorvastatin lowers fasting RLP-C and LDL subfraction cholesterol in diabetes. The proposed guideline cut-off levels for non-HDL cholesterol and apo B may be superior to the LDL cholesterol target in discriminating between higher and lower RLP-C levels.", 
    "146": "As the average human lifespan extends and medical care improves, there are more individuals above the age of 80 years who have a high quality of life. However, these very elderly individuals are particularly susceptible to stroke. Identifying ways to optimise the treatment and prevention of acute stroke in these much older people will increasingly be a priority for health-care providers, research funding agencies, and policy makers in years to come. Despite substantial advances in stroke research, with several therapeutic drugs being able to enhance clinical outcomes in people with stroke or who are at risk of stroke, the very elderly seem to receive fewer vascular protection interventions that have been shown to be effective in younger individuals. Although there has been an under-representation of the very elderly in studies of stroke therapy, these treatments might be of benefit to this group of patients. Indeed, emerging data indicate that the use of several of these therapies in routine clinical practice in the very elderly can be effective.", 
    "147": "Considering that inflammation contributes to obesity-induced insulin resistance and that statins have been reported to have other effects beyond cholesterol lowering, the present study aimed to investigate whether atorvastatin treatment has anti-inflammatory action in white adipose tissue of obese mice, consequently improving insulin sensitivity. Insulin sensitivity in vivo (by insulin tolerance test); metabolic-hormonal profile; plasma tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, and adiponectin; adipose tissue immunohistochemistry; glucose transporter (GLUT) 4; adiponectin; TNF-alpha; IL-1 beta; and IL-6 gene expression; and I kappaB kinase (IKK)-alpha/beta activity were assessed in 23-week-old monosodium glutamate-induced obese mice untreated or treated with atorvastatin for 4 weeks. Insulin-resistant obese mice had increased plasma triglyceride, insulin, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 plasma levels. Adipose tissue of obese animals showed increased macrophage infiltration, IKK-alpha (42%, P < .05) and IKK-beta (73%, P < .05) phosphorylation, and TNF-alpha and IL-6 messenger RNA (mRNA) ( approximately 15%, P < .05) levels, and decreased GLUT4 mRNA and protein (30%, P < .05) levels. Atorvastatin treatment lowered cholesterol, triglyceride, insulin, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 plasma levels, and restored whole-body insulin sensitivity. In adipose tissue, atorvastatin decreased macrophage infiltration and normalized IKK-alpha/beta phosphorylation; TNF-alpha, IL-6, and GLUT4 mRNA; and GLUT4 protein to control levels. The present findings demonstrate that atorvastatin has anti-inflammatory effects on adipose tissue of obese mice, which may be important to its local and whole-body insulin-sensitization effects.", 
    "148": "Large clinical trials demonstrate that control of blood pressure or hyperlipidemia reduces risk for cardiovascular events by approximately 30%. Factors that may further reduce remaining risk are not definitively established. One potential target is atherosclerosis, a crucial feature in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases whose development is determined by multiple mechanism including complex interactions between endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance. Reciprocal relationships between endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance as well as cross-talk between hyperlipidemia and the rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may contribute to development of atherosclerosis. Therefore, one appealing strategy for prevention or treatment of atherosclerosis may be to simultaneously address several risk factors with combination therapies that target multiple pathogenic mechanisms. Combination therapy with statins, peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor agonists, and rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers demonstrate additive beneficial effects on endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance when compared with monotherapies in patients with cardiovascular risk factors. Additive beneficial effects of combined therapy are mediated by both distinct and interrelated mechanisms, consistent with both pre-clinical and clinical investigations. Thus, combination therapy may be an important concept in developing more effective strategies to treat and prevent atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, and co-morbid metabolic disorders characterized by endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance.", 
    "149": "Statins are widely prescribed cholesterol lowering agents that exert their effects by inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3methylglutaryl co-enzyme A reductase. With their modulatory effects on the atherogenic lipid profile, the role of statin therapy is expanding amidst the growing obesity epidemic. The cholesterol lowering effects of statin therapy remains central in the long term management of coronary artery disease and cerebrovascular disease. While statin therapy is used commonly to target elevated LDL cholesterol, there is emerging evidence supporting its role during acute coronary syndromes and stroke. Clinical research into plaque histology, vulnerable high risk plaques and plaque rupture has improved our insight into the pathophysiology of these acute vascular events. Non lipid lowering effects of statin, the so called pleitrophic effects, have become the focal point of investigation. This review discusses recent experimental and clinical evidence supporting the role of statin in perioperative medicine.", 
    "150": "Elevations in beta-amyloid peptide (A beta) levels after traumatic brain injury (TBI) may confer risk for developing Alzheimer's disease in head trauma patients. We investigated the effects of simvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor, on hippocampal A beta burden in a clinically relevant head injury/intervention model using mice expressing human A beta. Simvastatin therapy blunted TBI-induced increases in A beta, reduced hippocampal tissue damage and microglial activation, and improved behavioral outcome. The ability of statins to reduce post-injury A beta load and ameliorate pathological sequelae of brain injury makes them potentially effective in reducing the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease in TBI patients.",

    "152": "PCSK9 was measured with a previously described ELISA.", 
    "153": "In 81 healthy middle-aged Caucasian men, the PCSK9 concentration was significantly associated with the concentrations of total cholesterol (r = 0.42; P < 0.0001), LDL cholesterol (r = 0.34; P = 0.01), and triglycerides (r = 0.25; P = 0.02). In p.R46L carriers, mean (SD) concentrations of PCSK9 were 15% lower than in RR individuals [65.5 microg/L (21.6 microg/L) vs 77.5 microg/L (18.2 microg/L); P = 0.03]. In patients with the p.D374Y variant (n = 7), the mean PCSK9 concentration was significantly lower than in the combined group of patients with an LDLR (low density lipoprotein receptor) mutation (n = 25), an APOB [apolipoprotein B (including Ag(x) antigen)] variant encoding p.R3527Q (n = 6), or no detectable mutation (n = 14) [96.4 microg/L (42.5 microg/L) vs 151.6 microg/L (69.6 microg/L); P = 0.02]. Two of the 14 patients with no mutation had PCSK9 concentrations below the mean for p.D374Y carriers; sequencing of the PCSK9 gene and promoter revealed no mutations. Among 409 FH patients, we identified 6 carriers of the promoter variant -287G>A (1.5%), a frequency similar to that (1.0%) previously reported for 2772 healthy men in the UK. In neither group was the -287G>A variant associated with differences in lipid traits.", 
    "154": "The loss-of-function p.R46L variant is associated with the expected lower concentrations of circulating PCSK9; the gain-of-function p.D374Y mutation is also associated with lower concentrations, presumably because of the higher affinity of this variant for the LDL receptor and its more rapid clearance. In treated FH patients, a low plasma PCSK9 concentration does not appear to be a useful screening tool for identifying novel PCSK9 mutations.", 
    "155": "Statins have been proposed to be a potential treatment for pulmonary arterial hypertension. If introduced into clinical practice, the statin would have to be used in conjunction with established therapy. We investigated the effects of combining simvastatin with a phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor, sildenafil, in the rat model of hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension. Rats were allocated to either: 1) a prevention protocol, to receive simvastatin 20 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) by intraperitoneal injection or sildenafil 75 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) orally or the combination (or vehicle) for 2 weeks beginning at the start of exposure to hypoxia (10% inspired oxygen); or 2) a treatment protocol, where the same agents were administered in the last 2 weeks of a 4-week period of hypoxia. In both protocols, the combination of sildenafil and simvastatin lowered pulmonary artery pressure and produced a significantly greater reduction in right ventricular hypertrophy and pulmonary vascular muscularisation than either drug alone. Moreover, the combination augmented significantly endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression and cGMP levels in the lung and right ventricle above that produced by either drug independently and resulted in greater inhibition of RhoA activity. These data suggest that simvastatin can be usefully combined with sildenafil in the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension to achieve greater therapeutic benefit.", 
    "156": "Pleiotropic effects of statins have been reported to include inhibition of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) release from macrophages and endothelial cells. We evaluated whether statins would inhibit MMP release from human lung fibroblasts, which play a major role in remodelling processes. Monolayer and three-dimensional (3D) collagen gel cultures of fibroblasts were used. Cytokines (tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1alpha) were used to induce MMP release and mRNA expression. Collagen degradation induced by cytokines and neutrophil elastase (NE) was evaluated by quantifying hydroxyproline. Atorvastatin inhibited MMP-1 and -3 release and mRNA expression in both culture systems. Similar results were obtained with simvastatin and fluvastatin. In 3D cultures where cytokines also stimulated MMP-9 release, atorvastatin also inhibited MMP-9 release. In 3D cultures, cytokines together with NE induced collagen degradation, which was also inhibited by atorvastatin. The effect of atorvastatin was reversed by mevalonate and geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate but not by farnesyl-pyrophosphate. The current data suggest that statins may modulate remodelling processes mediated by fibroblasts by inhibiting MMP release.", 
    "157": "That statins should be prescribed for patients before hospital discharge after an episode of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is a Level of Evidence: 1A recommendation of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Joint Task Force. This level of recommendation is based upon 2 clinical trials: the MIRACL (Myocardial Ischemia Reduction with Aggressive Cholesterol Lowering) and PROVE-IT (Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy) trials. In the MIRACL trial, 3,086 patients with unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction were randomized within 4 days of the event to atorvastatin 80 mg/day or to placebo and followed for 16 weeks. The primary composite end point occurred in 14.8% of atorvastatin patients and 17.4% of placebo patients, a 16% relative risk reduction (p = 0.048). In the PROVE-IT trial, 4,162 patients hospitalized with an ACS within the preceding 10 days were randomized to atorvastatin 80 mg/day or pravastatin 40 mg/day and were followed for a mean of 24 months. The primary event rate was 22.4% in the atorvastatin group and 26.3% in the pravastatin group, a 16% relative risk reduction (p = 0.005). A strong trend toward a reduction in total mortality was seen in the atorvastatin group (2.2% vs. 3.2%, p = 0.07). Using a composite end point of death, myocardial infarction, and rehospitalization for ACS, the difference between the treatment groups is already statistically significant at 30 days and remains so throughout the follow-up period. Comprehensive treatment programs in ACS patients that include initiation of statins before hospital discharge have been shown to improve outcomes such as recurrent myocardial infarction and total mortality at 1 year. Guidelines prove their utility when their implementation improves outcomes across a broad population at risk, such as in this instance.", 
    "158": "On the basis of the evidence obtained from observational studies, randomized controlled trials and their meta-analyses, current guidelines recommend initiating high-dose statin therapy pre-discharge regardless of the baseline low-density lipoprotein (LDL) level in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Careful review of the evidence indicates that early initiation of high-dose statin therapy reduces recurrent ischemia and may reduce revascularization, but does not confer benefit in terms of hard clinical outcomes such as death or myocardial infarction in any of the randomized controlled trials, and may be associated with increased liver and muscle-related adverse outcomes leading to increased withdrawal and suboptimal long-term adherence. A mortality benefit is apparent in pooled analyses of randomized controlled trials only at long-term (24-month) but not short-term (4-month) follow-up. The critical role of the timing of initiation of therapy (early vs. late) on the benefit-risk profile of statin treatment has not been systematically assessed. It is unclear whether the clinical benefits are attributable to lipid-lowering or lipid-lowering-independent effects. Finally, an optimal LDL threshold for initiating treatment or target LDL level for treatment in ACS remains yet to be defined. On the basis of these observations, and despite a compelling pathophysiologic rationale, the justification for current Class I, Level of Evidence: A recommendation for statin therapy in patients with ACS remains open to question.", 
    "159": "Although many studies have found psychological depression associated with higher circulating levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), not all findings are consistent. Since DNA sequence variation in the CRP gene has also been shown to predict plasma CRP levels, we hypothesized that plasma CRP may covary with depressive symptomatology as a function of allelic variation in the CRP gene. We tested this hypothesis in 868 healthy community volunteers of European ancestry. Depressive symptomatology was measured using the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CESD) scale, and plasma CRP was assayed from whole blood. Three polymorphisms [rs1417938 (A/T), rs1800947 (C/G) and rs1205 (C/T)] were genotyped and three-locus haplotypes were generated. Regression models adjusting for demographic and lifestyle-related covariates showed no direct association of CESD depression scores with CRP. In regression models adjusting for age, gender, education, smoking status and statin use, one CRP haplotype (T-G-C) was associated with CRP level (p=0.014) and a second haplotype (A-G-T) showed marginal association (p=0.064, respectively). Neither haplotype was related to depressive symptoms. However, plasma CRP was predicted by the interaction of A-G-T haplotype with depressive symptomatology (p=0.009). Higher CESD scores were associated positively with CRP levels among individuals with the A-G-T haplotype (p=0.004). In secondary analyses, body mass index was found to partially account for the moderating effects of the A-G-T haplotype on the association of depression with circulating CRP. In conclusion, we found that haplotypic variation in the CRP locus moderates an association of depressive symptoms with circulating CRP, which is partially mediated by BMI.", 
    "160": "Inflammation in atherosclerotic plaques causes plaque vulnerability and rupture, leading to thromboembolic complications. Cathepsin B (CatB) proteases secreted by macrophages play a major role in plaque inflammation. We used a CatB-activatable near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging agent to demonstrate the inflammatory component in mice atheromata and the atherosclerosis- modulating effects of atorvastatin or glucosamine treatments. Apolipoprotein E knockout mice (n = 35) were fed normal chow, a Western diet, a Western diet + atorvastatin, a Western diet + glucosamine, or a Western diet + atorvastatin + glucosamine for 14 weeks. Twenty-four hours after the intravenous injection of a CatB-activatable probe, ex vivo NIRF imaging of the aortas and brains was performed, followed by histology. The CatB-related signal, observed in the aortas but not in the cerebral arteries, correlated very well with protease activity and the presence of macrophages on histology. Animals on Western diets could be distinguished from animals on a normal diet. The antiatherosclerotic effects of atorvastatin and glucosamine could be demonstrated, with reduced CatB-related signal compared with untreated animals. Plaque populations were heterogeneous within individuals, with some plaques showing a high and others a lower CatB-related signal. These differences in signal intensity could not be predicted by visual inspection of the plaques but did correlate with histologic evidence of inflammation in every case. This suggests that vulnerable inflamed plaques can be identified by optical molecular imaging.",

Atorvastatin resulted in a dose-related increase in circulating serum antibody to the disease-inducing antigen but no differences in antigen-stimulated splenocyte production of Th1/Th2 cytokines. At the higher dose, atorvastatin also led to a significant reduction in apoptosis of splenic CD4(+) T lymphocytes.",

    "169": "The response to statins shows large interpatient variability. Atorvastatin delta-lactone is pharmacologically inactive but has been associated with toxicity. We investigated the role of UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) in atorvastatin lactonization. In human liver microsomes, lactonization was correlated with UGT1A3 (r(s) = 0.61, P < 0.0001) but not with UGT1A1. Surprisingly, lactone formation was significantly higher in carriers of UGT1A1*28, an allele that is associated with lower UGT1A1 expression. We show that this inverse correlation is due to extensive linkage disequilibrium in the UGT1A locus and that several UGT1A3 haplotypes are associated with strong increases in UGT1A3 expression in vitro. Analyses of the pharmacokinetic parameters of atorvastatin and metabolites in genotyped volunteers confirmed that there is an increase in atorvastatin lactonization in carriers of UGT1A3*2 in vivo. The potential of UGT genotyping to identify patients who are at increased risk for failure of therapy and/or adverse effects of statins warrants further investigation.",

Solubility of lovastatin was determined in various vehicles. Ternary phase diagrams were constructed to identify the efficient self-emulsification region using oils, surfactants, and co-surfactants in aqueous environment. Optimized formulations were assessed for drug content, spectroscopic clarity, emulsification time, contact angle, zeta potential, particle size and dissolution studies. Zeta potential was measured in absence and presence of oleylamine, a positive charge inducer. On the basis of similarity and dissimilarity of particle size distribution, formulations were characterized using principal component analysis and agglomerative hierarchy cluster analysis, the multivariate statistical analysis. Transmission electron microscopy of selected formulations (F5-F7) confirmed the spherical shape of globules with no signs of coalescence of globules and precipitation of drug, even after 24 h post dilution in distilled water. The relevance of differences in t(50%) and percentage dissolution efficiency was evaluated statistically by two-way ANOVA. Infrared spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetric and x-ray diffraction studies indicated no incompatibility between drug, oil and surfactants.

Following groups were studied (n=8 each): sham group, AAC group, AAC+ verapamil group (10 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1) per gavage for 4 weeks), AAC +SIM group (10 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1) per gavage for 4 weeks) AAC + SIM + mevalonic acid (50 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1) per gavage for 4 weeks) group. Systolic blood pressure (SBP), echocardiography, heart weight/body weight (HW/BW) and left ventricle weight/body weight (LVW/BW) ratios were measured. The protein and mRNA expressions of L-type calcium channel subunit alpha1 C and T-type calcium channel subunit alpha1 G and alpha1 H were detected by Western blot and RT-PCR respectively.", 
    "199": "SBP, HW/BW, LVW/BW, IVS and LVPW thickness, left ventricular weights were significantly increased in AAC rats and these effects could be significantly reduced by verapamil and SIM. The protein and mRNA expressions of alpha1 G and alpha1 H were significantly increased in AAC rats which could also be significantly inhibited by SIM or verapamil. The effects of SIM could be blocked by cotreatment with mevalonic acid. Protein and mRNA expressions of L-type calcium channel alpha1 C were similar among groups.", 
    "200": "Similar as verapamil, SIM could prevent AAC induced cardiac hypertrophy, possibly via inhibiting T-type calcium channel subunit alpha1 G and alpha1 H re-expression."
