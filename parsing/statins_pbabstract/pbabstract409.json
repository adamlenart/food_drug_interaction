This effect was reversed by growth of cells in medium supplemented with lipoprotein-depleted serum (LPDS) reconstituted with the low density lipoprotein fraction from fetal calf serum. In cells grown in LPDS, total cell cholesterol was increased 32% over control levels and returned to control levels in cells grown with LPDS reconstituted with low density lipoprotein. Growth of cells in LPDS plus mevinolin, an inhibitor of endogenous cholesterol synthesis, also reversed the effects of LPDS on cholesterol content and sensitivity of beating to carbamylcholine. The ability of mevinolin (30 microM) to reverse the effect of LPDS on sensitivity of beating to carbamylcholine was inhibited by mevalonic acid, a metabolic precursor to cholesterol, with an IC50 of 7 x 10(-5) M. These data suggest that mevinolin reverses the effects of LPDS by altering cellular cholesterol levels. Enhanced responsiveness of embryonic chick heart cells to muscarinic stimulation was associated with a 2-fold increase in the number of muscarinic receptors with high affinity for agonist from 82 +/- 10 fmol/mg protein in media containing fetal calf serum to 175 +/- 12 fmol/mg protein in cells grown in the presence of LPDS. The distribution of receptors between high affinity (RH) and low affinity (RL) forms changed from 41% RH and 59% RL in cells grown in control serum to 66.5% RH and 33.5% RL in cells grown in LPDS. Quantitation of the effect of growth in LPDS on the levels of guanine nucleotide regulatory proteins No and Ni which couple the muscarinic receptor to a physiologic response, demonstrated that the relative levels of the 39-kDa alpha subunits of No and 41-kDa alpha subunits of Ni determined by ADP ribosylation with pertussis toxin and immunoblotting increased 2-fold compared to control cells grown with fetal calf serum. Growth of cells with medium supplemented with LPDS plus mevinolin reduced the levels of alpha 39 and alpha 41 to below the levels in control cells. Levels of the beta subunit of No and Ni were unaffected by growth with LPDS.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "1": "The lipoprotein-mediated regulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-(HMG-) CoA reductase in cultured mouse peritoneal macrophages has been investigated. In contrast to what has been reported for other cells, HMG-CoA reductase activity is not suppressed by normal serum or by normal low density lipoproteins (LDL) from humans or dogs. Suppression of reductase activity occurred when cells were cultured in the presence of beta-migrating very low density lipoproteins (beta-VLDL) or LDL from hypercholesterolaemic dogs, or LDL modified by acetoacetylation. Human beta-VLDL from an atypical type III hyperlipoproteinaemic patient was also effective, as was apolipoprotein (apo) E-containing high density lipoproteins (HDL) from cholesterol-fed dogs (apo-E HDLc). The results indicate that cholesterol biosynthesis in mouse peritoneal macrophages is regulated by lipoprotein cholesterol entering via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Normal LDL were not effective because of the poor binding and uptake of these lipoproteins by the apo-B, E (LDL) receptor. Only beta-VLDL, apo-E HDLc, and hypercholesterolaemic LDL were avidly taken up by this receptor and were able to suppress HMG-CoA reductase. Acetoacetylated LDL were internalized via the acetyl-LDL (scavenger) receptor. Thus, mouse macrophages differ from human fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells in their physiological regulation of cholesterogenesis.", 
    "2": "A facile chemical synthesis of lanost-8-en-3 beta-ol-24-one (24-ketolanosterol) is described. This compound was found to be a potent inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG) CoA reductase activity in cultured mouse L cells. The synthetic scheme developed in this study utilizes commercial lanosterol as a starting material and involves selective hydroboration of the C-24 double bond followed by oxidation of the carbon-boron bond at C-24 by pyridinium chlorochromate (PCC).", 
    "3": "Partial ileal bypass (PIB) lowers the plasma total cholesterol (C) level, thereby increasing hepatic C synthesis to replenish bile acid and C stores. Lovastatin, a C synthesis inhibitor, may act as a potential adjuvant to PIB for lipid lowering. In this study, the effects of PIB and lovastatin, alone and in combination, were examined in plasma and tissue. For 14 weeks, 32 New Zealand White rabbits received a C-free, alfalfa-free, natural-ingredients diet previously shown to induce hypercholesterolemia. The rabbits were divided into control, lovastatin, PIB, and PIB plus lovastatin groups. Lovastatin was administered at a dose of 0.35 mg/kg twice daily. Compared with the control group, PIB alone decreased the plasma total C level by 75% (p less than 0.005), the low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-C level by 79% (p less than 0.025), and hepatic C content by 50% (p less than 0.05), while increasing hepatic C synthesis by 176% (p less than 0.05). Compared with the control group, lovastatin alone decreased the plasma total C value by 36% (p = NS), the LDL-C level by 35% (p = NS), hepatic C content by 29% (p = NS), and hepatic C synthesis by 52% (p = NS). Compared with the control group, the combination of PIB and lovastatin decreased the plasma total C level by 78% (p less than 0.005), the LDL-C level by 74% (p less than 0.025), and hepatic C content by 58% (p less than 0.05); however, the hepatic C synthesis increased by 490% (p less than 0.005) compared with the control group and by 110% (p less than 0.05) compared with PIB alone. This is the first demonstration of a metabolic reversal of the cholesterol synthesis inhibition engendered by lovastatin. We conclude that both PIB and lovastatin lower plasma total C and lipoprotein C fractions. Their combination has an additive C-lowering effect in plasma and decreases tissue C content by increasing cellular C demand. This latter effect overcomes the inhibitory effect of lovastatin on hepatic C synthesis, resulting in an augmented compensatory increase in hepatic C synthesis.", 
    "4": "In order to investigate a requirement for isoprenoid compounds in the cell cycle, DNA synthesis was examined in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells in which mevalonate biosynthesis was blocked with mevinolin, a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. Treatment of exponentially-growing cultures with mevinolin led to a decline in DNA synthesis and cell cycle arrest in G1. Synchronous DNA synthesis and cell division could be restored in the arrested cultures, in the absence of exogenous mevalonate, by removing the inhibitor from the culture thereby allowing expression of an induced level of HMG-CoA reductase. In order to quantitate the mevalonate requirement for entry into S phase, recovery of DNA synthesis was made dependent upon added mevalonate by preventing the induction of the enzyme using 25-hydroxycholesterol, a specific repressor of HMG-CoA reductase synthesis. When cultures were treated with both inhibitors, optimal recovery of DNA synthesis was obtained with 200 micrograms/ml mevalonate following an 8 h lag, whereas a progressively longer lag-time was found with lower concentrations of mevalonate. Exogenous dolichol, ubiquinone, or isopentenyladenine had no effect on the arrest or recovery of DNA synthesis. Cholesterol was required during the arrest incubation for cell viability, but was not sufficient for recovery in the absence of mevalonate. The recovery of DNA synthesis by 200 micrograms/ml mevalonate, which was maximal 14-16 h after the addition of mevalonate, only required that the mevalonate be present for the first 4 h, whereas more than an 8-h incubation was required for maximal recovery with 25 micrograms/ml mevalonate. Maximal recovery at either concentration of mevalonate was achieved after approximately 400 fmol mevalonate/micrograms protein was incorporated into non-saponifiable lipids. This quantity represents approximately 0.1% of the mevalonate required for the synthesis of total cellular isoprenoid compounds. The results indicate that production of a quantitatively minor product(s) of mevalonate metabolism is required during the first 4 h following release of the block before other cellular events necessary for entry into S phase can occur.", 
    "5": "The effect of CS-514 (pravastatin; Sankyo Co., Tokyo), a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, on triglyceride turnover, was studied in male Wistar rats. CS-514 (15 +/- 1 mg/day per rat) was administered as a 0.04% solution in drinking water for 14 days. Triglyceride and cholesterol in very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and plasma triglyceride were reduced by treatment with CS-514. Plasma cholesterol level was not suppressed by CS-514. The CS-514 treated rats had a significantly suppressed triglyceride secretion rate (TgSR) during the fed state compared to control rats (0.85 +/- 0.1 vs. 1.07 +/- 0.3 mg/min, P less than 0.05). By contrast, CS-514 treatment did not suppress TgSR after an overnight fast. These data demonstrate that CS-514, an inhibitor of cholesterol biosynthesis can suppress VLDL-triglyceride secretion in rats and that this effect can be modified by dietary manipulation.", 
    "6": "Lovastatin is the first of a new class of cholesterol lowering drugs that competitively inhibit HMG-CoA reductase. This new drug decreases cholesterol synthesis and apolipoprotein B concentrations, and increases LDL receptor activity without adverse effects on other products in the cholesterol pathway. In patients with heterozygous familial or polygenic (non-familial) hypercholesterolaemia, oral lovastatin 20 to 40 mg twice daily reduces plasma total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol concentrations by 25 to 40% over a period of several weeks. Lovastatin also produces decreases in plasma triglyceride and VLDL-cholesterol concentrations, although to a lesser extent. In addition, small though significant increases in HDL-cholesterol concentrations have been observed. Combined administration of lovastatin with other lipid-lowering drugs results in further reductions in plasma total and LDL-cholesterol concentrations beyond those seen with either drug alone. From findings in short term studies, lovastatin appears to be well tolerated with a low incidence of side effects. However, liver function tests and eye examinations for possible lens opacities are advised, and further long term studies in larger groups of patients are necessary before the side effect profile of lovastatin will be clearly established. As would be expected at this relatively early stage of its clinical 'life,' lovastatin has not yet been studied in a manner that would determine its effect on cardiovascular mortality during long term administration. Nevertheless, if the substantial improvements to patients' lipid and lipoprotein profiles observed in short term studies are maintained during long term administration, then lovastatin will have an important role in the pharmacological management of hyperlipidaemia.", 
    "7": "We have studied the effect of lovastatin, an inhibitor of the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase), alone and in combination with the bile acid sequestrant cholestyramine on lipid parameters in 30 heterozygous patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) during a 20-week open trial. Lovastatin 40 mg bid (twice daily) decreased significantly total serum cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, triglycerides and apolipoprotein B by 36%, 45%, 29% and 11%, respectively, while high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I were increased significantly by 16% and 37%, respectively. These data are consistent with a reduction in both the number of LDL particles and in their cholesterol content. Addition of cholestyramine 4 g bid caused a significant further decrease in total serum cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol to a total of 43% and 61%, respectively. The addition of 4 g bid or 8 g bid of cholestyramine caused only minor changes in the other lipid parameters. No effect was found by these drugs on Lp(a) lipoprotein level. We conclude that lovastatin alone or in combination with a small dose of cholestyramine normalizes the lipid profile in most FH heterozygotes.", 
    "8": "The metabolism of [2,4-3H]5 alpha-cholest-8(14)-en-3 beta-ol-15-one (I) has been studied in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO-K1) cells which were maintained in a lipid-deficient medium. The incorporation of I into the cells was linear with respect to sterol concentration in the medium over the ranges of concentrations studied and was more than 3.5 times that of the uptake of cholesterol. The results of detailed chromatographic analyses of the lipids recovered from the cells after 6 h of incubation with [2,4-3H]I (0.5 microM or 6.0 microM) indicated that most of the 3H was associated with free I. Considerably lesser amounts of the 3H was associated with esters of I. No formation of [3H]cholesterol or [3H]cholesteryl esters (or other C27 monohydroxysterols) from labeled I was observed. The labeled material with the chromatographic behavior of the esters of I gave, after mild alkaline hydrolysis, the free 15-ketosterol which was characterized by the results of chromatographic and cocrystallization studies. Upon transfer of the CHO-K1 cells from a culture medium containing 8% newborn calf serum to the same medium containing 8% lipid-deficient newborn calf serum, increases in the levels of activity of cytosolic acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) synthase and of HMG-CoA reductase were observed. These increases were blocked by the addition of I at a concentration of 1.0 microM. I (1.0 microM) also caused a decrease in the levels of activity of the three enzymes in cells previously grown in medium containing lipid-deficient serum. These results demonstrate that I not only affects the enzymatic reduction of HMG-CoA but also the enzymatic formation of this key intermediate in cholesterol biosynthesis.", 
    "9": "Hep G2 cells were incubated under conditions known to influence the HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA) reductase activity, e.g. in the presence of compactin (a competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase itself) and U18666A (a squalene-2,3-epoxide cyclase inhibitor). We studied the effects of these conditions both on the HMG-CoA reductase activity and on the reductase mRNA content. In the presence of compactin the mRNA content increased, but less than the enzyme activity, as determined after removal of the inhibitor. The increase in mRNA could be prevented by addition of mevalonate or by a combination of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) plus a low concentration of mevalonate. LDL alone prevented the compactin-induced increases in mRNA and activity only partially. The effect of U18666A on reductase mRNA content and activity was biphasic, i.e. a slight decrease at low (0.3-0.5 microM) concentrations, with a concomitant formation of polar sterols [Boogaard, Griffioen & Cohen (1987) Biochem. J. 241, 345-351], and an increase at high (20-30 microM) concentrations, with complete blockage of sterol formation. At these high concentrations of U18666A, additional compactin (2 microM) increased the reductase activity, but not the mRNA content. We conclude that non-sterol metabolites of mevalonate regulate exclusively at the enzyme level, whereas sterol metabolites regulate at the reductase mRNA level. In the latter group of regulators we distinguish mevalonate metabolites which can, and metabolites which cannot, be replaced by exogenous LDL.", 
    "10": "After exposure to compactin, the competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, 22% of CHO-K1 cells contained abnormally high numbers of chromosomes. In two populations of cells selected for compactin resistance 31 and 33% of the cells contain more than 22 chromosomes. Some cell lines isolated from these populations have the wild type chromosome number of 20-21, while others have a broad distribution of chromosome number, often with a mean around 36-40. Finally, Chinese hamster ovary cells that are mutant for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase and therefore auxotrophic for mevalonate were starved for that compound. This treatment also increased the number of cells containing extra chromosomes. These results indicate that interruption of the cellular supply of mevalonate results in abnormal chromosome number.", 
    "11": "The mechanisms by which thyroid hormones increase hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase mRNA levels were investigated in hypophysectomized rats. Feeding these rats a diet supplemented with 0.5% desiccated porcine thyroid powder resulted in a 5-fold increase in the rate of transcription of the HMG-CoA reductase gene as measured by in vitro \"run-on\" transcription assays in isolated rat liver nuclei. Time courses of change in reductase mRNA, showing the kinetics of approach to new steady-state levels, indicate that reductase mRNA is also 4-6-fold more stable in thyroid hormone-treated animals than in non-treated animals. Reductase mRNA decayed with a half-life of 2.5 h when mevinolin, a potent inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, and colestipol, a bile acid sequesterant, were removed from the diet of hypophysectomized rats. When these drugs were removed from the diet of thyroid hormone-treated hypophysectomized rats, reductase mRNA decayed with a half-life of 15 h. Treating rats with only mevinolin and colestipol increased reductase mRNA levels without stabilizing the mRNA. Administration of cycloheximide to thyroid hormone treated rats rapidly decreased HMG-CoA reductase mRNA levels by destabilizing reductase mRNA and decreasing reductase gene transcription. Cycloheximide treatment had no effect on beta-actin gene transcription or steady state levels of beta-actin mRNA. These results suggest that a short-lived protein(s) may mediate the transcriptional and post-transcriptional effects of thyroid hormones on HMG-CoA reductase mRNA levels.", 
    "12": "In glutathione redox buffers, rat liver, microsomal 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase rapidly equilibrates between a reduced, active form and an oxidized, inactive form. At pH 7.0, 37 degrees C, the second order rate constant for inactivation of the reduced enzyme by GSSG is 1700 +/- 200 M-1 min-1, approximately 20-fold faster than the reaction of GSSG with a typical, unhindered thiol of pKa 7.7. High concentrations of GSH or lower concentrations of dithiothreitol restore the activity of the oxidized enzyme. The oxidation of the enzyme by GSSG is only 30-fold slower in the presence of saturating levels of both substrates. The incomplete inhibition of thiol/disulfide exchange by substrates can lead to significant changes in the activity of the enzyme during the assay when glutathione is present. At redox equilibrium, both in the absence and presence of substrates, the activity of the enzyme depends on the quantity [GSH]2/[GSSG], suggesting that the redox transition involves the formation of a protein-SS-protein disulfide. The equilibrium constant for the reaction HMGRred + GSSG in equilibrium HMGRox + 2 GSH is 0.55 +/- 0.07 M in the absence of substrates and 0.20 +/- 0.02 M in the presence of saturating levels of both substrates. Thus, HMG-CoA reductase is very sensitive to dithiol oxidation both kinetically and thermodynamically. Significant changes in the oxidation state and activity of this enzyme could be expected to result from normal changes in the thiol/disulfide oxidation state of the cellular glutathione redox buffer.", 
    "13": "The cholesterol lowering compound lovastatin, a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (EC 1.1.1.34 HMG CoA reductase), was given in nine separate experiments to normocholesterolemic dogs at rates up to 180 times the maximum therapeutic dose in man (1 mg/kg/day). Mean serum total cholesterol concentrations were reduced as much as 88% below normal. Clinical evidence of neurotoxicity occurred in up to 37% of animals given 180 mg/kg/day lovastatin for 11 or more days, especially in one laboratory where the dosing regime resulted in higher concentrations of plasma drug levels. Dogs receiving 60 mg/kg/day or less never exhibited neurologic signs. The central nervous system (CNS) of affected dogs exhibited endothelial degeneration and hemorrhagic encephalopathy. Focal extravasation of horseradish peroxidase occurred frequently (6/8) in the retrolaminar optic nerve of asymptomatic or clinically affected dogs given 180 mg/kg/day lovastatin, with endothelial degeneration and discrete optic nerve degenerative lesions interpreted as ischemic. The association between the degree of hypocholesterolemia and occurrence of clinical signs was not exact. Total brain cholesterol was similar in treated and control dogs. Hypocholesterolemic dogs had proportionally lowered serum concentrations of alpha-tocopherol, but oral supplementation of this vitamin did not prevent the neurologic syndrome. Endothelial degeneration in the CNS and optic nerve may have reflected in vitro morphologic effects of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors due to extreme inhibition of nonsterol isoprene synthesis. Retinogeniculate axonal (Wallerian-like) degeneration occurred in greater than or equal to 12% of dogs given 60 mg/kg/day or more lovastatin, with central chromatolysis of occasional retinal ganglion cells. These neuroaxonal changes may have been secondary to vascular effects, but superimposed direct neurotoxic action at the high dosage levels of lovastatin could not be excluded. There was no evidence of drug induced adverse effects in the CNS of dogs given up to 30 mg/kg/day lovastatin for 2 years.", 
    "14": "A quantitative structure-activity relationship study has been made of some 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors. The HMG-CoA reductase inhibition activities of mevinolin analogs and 6-substituted 4-hydroxypyran-2 ones have been mostly found to be significantly correlated with the molecular size of substituents. In one case, however, the inhibition potency was found to be related to the hydrophobicity of molecules. These findings led us to suggest that the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase possesses an active site which is involved in dispersion interaction and another site which is involved in hydrophobic interaction with inhibitor molecules, depending upon the proper orientation of the latter towards these sites. Furthermore, the results indicate that both active sites possess limited steric bulk tolerance.", 
    "15": "The power of serum lathosterol concentration as an indicator of whole-body cholesterol synthesis was investigated in 47 human volunteers consuming two diets differing in fatty acid composition. The cholesterol balance (fecal excretion of neutral and acid steroids minus cholesterol intake) was strongly correlated with the serum level of total (free plus esterified) lathosterol and also with the ratio of serum lathosterol over serum cholesterol, both on a diet rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (r = 0.74 for the ratio) and one containing mainly saturated fatty acids (r = 0.70 for the ratio). In a subgroup for which the serum levels of free lanosterol and other free methylsterols were also quantitated, the correlations of these levels (expressed relative to serum free cholesterol) with the cholesterol balance were lower than that found for total lathosterol (expressed relative to serum total cholesterol). A further corroboration was obtained by measuring the lathosterol/cholesterol ratio in 20 patients with familial hypercholesterolemia before and during treatment with the hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor Mk-733. The ratio was lowered by 47% during drug treatment, suggesting a significant decrease of the cholesterol balance in these patients. We conclude, from the various indicators proposed to monitor whole-body cholesterol synthesis, that the lathosterol/cholesterol ratio in serum appears preferable with respect to indicative power and ease of quantitation.", 
    "16": "We tested the possibility that simvastatin, a competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase related to mevinolin, might alter cholesterol saturation of gallbladder bile. Ten patients with Type IIa or IIb hypercholesterolemia underwent bile sampling before, and again after, treatment with 20 or 40 mg per day simvastatin for 7 to 13 weeks. Mean cholesterol saturation index of gallbladder bile fell from 1.01 to 0.77 during simvastatin treatment (p less than 0.01). This finding strongly suggests that treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors will not predispose to development of cholesterol gallstones. Indeed, it raises the possibility that such inhibitors might have a future role to play in treatment of gallstones.", 
    "17": "The metabolism of lovastatin (Mevacor) was examined using isolated microsomes derived from the livers of normal and phenobarbital-treated rats and from human liver samples. Incubation of lovastatin with rat liver microsomes resulted in the formation of several polar metabolites of lovastatin. The metabolites were isolated by HPLC and identified by NMR and mass spectrometry. One fraction consisted of a 2:1 mixture of 6-hydroxy-lovastatin and the rearrangement product delta 4,5-3-hydroxy lovastatin. Addition of a trace of acid to this mixture resulted in the formation of a single aromatized product, the desacyl-delta 4a,6,8-dehydro analog of lovastatin. Another microsomal metabolite was determined to be the delta 4,8a,1-3-hydroxy-lovastatin derivative. The chromatographic pattern of metabolites produced from lovastatin by human liver microsomes was similar to that obtained with rat liver microsomes. Metabolism of lovastatin by rat liver microsomes was both time and concentration dependent; optimal microsomal metabolism occurred with 0.1 mM lovastatin, whereas higher lovastatin concentrations inhibited the reaction. The open acid form of lovastatin was poorly metabolized by both the rat and the human liver microsomes.", 
    "18": "In preliminary experiments, we have shown that rat liver microsomes possess phosphatase activity which was inhibited in the presence of sodium fluoride. We have now separated six microsomal phosphatase fractions appearing to be isoenzymes. They all possess different kinetic constants and are not equally inhibited by tartrate and fluoride ions, inhibitors of phosphatase activity. One phosphatase fraction, in fact, is almost completely unaffected by fluoride ion. More pertinent to our interest, these isoenzymes exhibit differing abilities to modulate the activities of hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase, acyl-CoA:cholesterol O-acetyltransferase, and cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase. Interaction of four of the fractions with rat liver microsomes resulted in a decrease in cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity; two were without effect.", 
    "19": "To determine whether at least part of the fall in low density lipoprotein (LDL) levels during lovastatin therapy might be the result of a reduced secretion of lipoproteins by the liver, three children 6 to 9 years of age with receptor-negative homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia underwent treatment with lovastatin. These patients have no capacity to synthesize LDL receptors. During lovastatin therapy, at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day, there was no decrease in LDL-cholesterol levels, nor was the turnover rate of LDL affected by the drug. The only significant change was a 74% drop in very low-density lipoprotein during treatment. We conclude that lovastatin is not effective in treatment of receptor-negative homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. The most likely mechanism of action for this drug is to increase LDL receptor activity.", 
    "20": "Human and rabbit plasma contains a lipid transfer protein that transfers cholesteryl esters and triglycerides among the plasma lipoproteins and may also have a role in the movement of lipids into and out of cells. Little is known about the regulation of the activity of the lipid transfer protein, but in the rabbit, hypercholesterolemia is associated with increased plasma lipid transfer activity (LTA). Perfused rabbit livers secrete LTA, and hepatic cholesterol secretion is increased in rabbits with diet-induced hypercholesterolemia. Thus, experiments were performed with rabbits to determine if LTA is regulated by a concerted hepatic secretion of lipoprotein protein cholesterol and LTA. Rabbits were fed chow or chow plus coconut oil (14% wt/wt), and plasma lipids, LTA, and the rate of secretion of cholesterol into plasma were determined. Coconut oil feeding increased plasma cholesterol by 68%, LTA by 42%, and hepatic cholesterol secretion by 69%. Mevinolin (75 mg/day), an inhibitor of cholesterol biosynthesis, lowered LTA and plasma cholesterol without affecting the rate of secretion of cholesterol into plasma. These studies provide further evidence that, in the rabbit, plasma cholesterol and LTA are closely related, and the association is not likely to be caused by a concerted hepatic secretion of cholesterol and LTA.", 
    "21": "The hypolipidemic effect of a new HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, pravastatin, was examined. The reductions of serum cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol were dose-dependent and significant differences were observed between placebo and 10 or 20 mg groups (P less than 0.01), and 10 and 20 mg (P less than 0.05) groups. The reduction rate of cholesterol after 8 weeks during medication was 16.1% in the 10 mg group, 20.5% in the 20 mg group compared to baseline serum cholesterol levels. LDL-cholesterol decreased by 23.9% in the 10 mg group, and 29.8% compared to baseline LDL-cholesterol in the 20 mg group. The lowering of total cholesterol was entirely attributed to a reduction in LDL-cholesterol.", 
    "22": "Nine heterozygous patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) were treated by low density lipoprotein (LDL)-apheresis using dextran sulfate cellulose columns. After more than 3 procedures of LDL-apheresis without drug therapy, combination therapy with LDL-apheresis and CS-514 (eptastatin), an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme (HMG-CoA) reductase, at a dose of 10 mg twice daily was started. Pre- and post-apheresis serum cholesterol levels were decreased significantly by CS-514, from 289 +/- 24 mg/dl (mean +/- SEM) to 247 +/- 25 mg/dl and from 118 +/- 7 mg/dl to 106 +/- 9 mg/dl, respectively. Pre- and post-apheresis apolipoprotein B levels decreased significantly on CS-514 from 160 +/- 9 mg/dl to 138 +/- 8 mg/dl and from 58 +/- 6 mg/dl to 45 +/- 6 mg/dl, respectively. No adverse effects were observed during the combination therapy. Thus, the addition of an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase to LDL-apheresis is a useful method for further reducing serum cholesterol and apolipoprotein B levels in FH heterozygotes.", 
    "23": "In order to compare the effects of lovastatin and probucol on lipoprotein profiles, we treated 32 familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) heterozygotes and 26 patients with non-familial hypercholesterolemia for 14 weeks with either probucol (1 g/d) or lovastatin (40-80 mg/d) in a randomized double-blind study. Lovastatin at 80 mg/d reduced low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and apo B by more than 40% in both familial and non-familial hypercholesterolemia (non-FH). Probucol reduced LDL-cholesterol by 10-17% while LDL-apo B levels were not influenced at all (FH) or fell by 13% (non-FH). Analysis of LDL composition demonstrated that the LDL-cholesterol lowering effect of probucol in FH was entirely due to reduction in the proportion of cholesterol in LDL with no reduction in LDL mass. Serum high density lipoprotein2 (HDL2)-cholesterol levels fell by 27-33% during probucol, whereas HDL2-cholesterol increased by 10-18% with lovastatin 80 mg/d. These changes in HDL2 were not mediated by lipoprotein lipase or hepatic lipase, both of which are known to participate in regulation of this lipoprotein.", 
    "24": "Previous studies from this laboratory have shown that oxidative modification of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) causes it to be recognized by the scavenger receptor of the macrophage. Consequently, the rate of degradation of oxidized LDL by macrophages can be 3 to 10 times that of native LDL. Antioxidants, such as probucol, are highly effective in preventing the oxidative modification of LDL. Our recent studies show that probucol treatment of LDL receptor-deficient Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits selectively inhibits the degradation of LDL in fatty streak lesions (which are rich in macrophage-derived foam cells) without inhibiting degradation in nonlesioned areas (where degradation is predominantly in smooth muscle cells, which do not express the scavenger receptor). Furthermore, the rate of progression of lesions in probucol-treated animals was significantly slower than in a lovastatin-treated group maintained at equal total plasma cholesterol levels. These results strongly suggest that probucol, through an antioxidant activity not necessarily related to its ability to lower plasma cholesterol levels, can slow the progression of the foam-cell-rich fatty streak lesion of atherosclerosis.", 
    "25": "This study compares lovastatin and cholestyramine resin therapy in patients with severe primary hypercholesterolemia. Two hundred sixty-four patients on lipid-lowering diets were randomized equally to receive 12 g of cholestyramine resin, 20 mg of lovastatin, or 40 mg of lovastatin, each twice a day. The mean reductions among the three groups after 12 weeks' treatment in levels of total plasma cholesterol (-17%, -27%, and -34%, respectively) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-23%, -32%, and -42%, respectively) and the median reductions in apolipoprotein B levels (-21%, -28%, and -33%, respectively) were all significantly different between groups. Similar mean increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (8%, 9%, and 8%, respectively) and median increases in apolipoprotein A-1 levels (7%, 6%, and 11%, respectively) were observed in all treatment groups. Cholestyramine resin treatment had no significant effect on very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-II levels and produced a median 11% increase in plasma triglyceride concentration; in contrast, administration of either 20 or 40 mg of lovastatin twice a day was associated with median reductions in very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (-34% and -31%, respectively) and plasma triglyceride levels (-21% and -27%, respectively) and median increases in levels of apolipoprotein A-II (8% and 13%, respectively). Adverse events in all treatment groups were preponderantly in the gastrointestinal tract; gastrointestinal tract symptoms that could be attributed to therapy with a specific drug occurred in 58% of the cholestyramine resin group, 13% of the 20-mg lovastatin group, and 14% of the 40-mg lovastatin group. The only drug-attributable serious adverse event was a reversible myopathy in a patient taking 40 mg of lovastatin twice a day. We conclude that lovastatin is both more effective and better tolerated than cholestyramine resin in the treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "26": "Hyperlipidemia, particularly hypercholesterolemia, occurs in cardiac transplant recipients both as a preexisting condition and as a consequence of immunosuppressive therapy. Lovastatin (Mevacor) has emerged as an agent that may effectively manage this condition. Few serious side effects of this drug have been observed. We describe two cardiac transplant recipients treated with lovastatin in conjunction with their other medications, including cyclosporine, who developed acute renal failure and rhabdomyolysis. Resolution of muscle damage followed discontinuation of cyclosporine and lovastatin therapy. We postulate that hepatic dysfunction secondary to cyclosporine predisposed these patients to lovastatin-induced muscle damage. Use of this drug in cardiac and other organ transplant recipients should be accompanied by close surveillance of creatine kinase, hepatic transaminases, and cyclosporine levels.", 
    "27": "Significant cholesterol synthesis occurs in gut mucosa of animals and humans. However, the role of gut synthesis in hypercholesterolemia and the effect of drugs on this function have not been defined. We obtained jejunal biopsies and bile samples from 21 Type II hypercholesterolemic subjects (mean serum cholesterol = 331 mg/dl) on a low fat diet after an over-night fast. Whole gut mucosal homogenate was assayed for activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase, the rate-determining enzyme of cholesterol synthesis. Mean reductase activity (pmol/mg per min) was 5.5 +/- 1.0 (n = 21) in hypercholesterolemic subjects versus 11.3 +/- 1.0 in 52 normal subjects (P less than 0.01). This is consistent with the hypothesis that the primary defect in these patients is not excessive cholesterol synthesis but decreased low density lipoprotein (LDL) clearance. It implies that high LDL levels down-regulate gut reductase activity. After treatment of 7 patients with lovastatin (40-80 mg/day for at least 6-13 weeks), gut reductase activity decreased from 7.7 +/- 2.6 to 3.6 +/- 0.5 (P less than 0.05), in biopsies obtained 12 hr after the last drug dose. Inhibition of reductase activity by this drug was detected 12 hr after a dose, and the enzyme was not measurably induced during 6-13 weeks of therapy. In keeping with the decrease in serum cholesterol (332----239 mg/dl) and mucosal reductase activity during lovastatin therapy, mean gallbladder bile cholesterol saturation index also decreased (1.045 +/- 0.112 vs. 0.883 +/- 0.109, n = 7).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "28": "Lovastatin is a potent competitive inhibitor of the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol synthesis, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (NADPH) [HMG-CoA reductase; (S)-mevalonate:NADP+ oxidoreductase (CoA-acylating), EC 1.1.1.34]. We determined the subcellular distribution of HMG-CoA reductase at high resolution by means of immunoelectron microscopy on ultrathin frozen liver sections of rats treated with lovastatin and cholestyramine. High concentrations of reductase were located on the outer (cytoplasmic) surfaces of smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) membranes induced in hepatocytes by acute drug administration. The enzyme was specifically localized over the whorled SER membranes and was absent from nonwhorled SER, rough endoplasmic reticulum, and peroxisomes. Intense HMG-CoA reductase labeling was only observed in hepatocytes containing high levels of HMG-CoA reductase activity; no staining was detected in untreated livers. These observations show that HMG-CoA reductase is induced as an integral component of the SER membranes that form in rat hepatocytes subsequent to lovastatin treatment and suggest that the formation of SER whorls in rat hepatocytes is due to mechanism-based effects of lovastatin.",

Addition of either colestipol or lovastatin reduced LDL-cholesterol levels by 17% and 25%, respectively, compared to gemfibrozil alone. However, colestipol mitigated the HDL-cholesterol raising effect of gemfibrozil and did not further reduce LDL-apolipoprotein B levels. In contrast, addition of lovastatin caused an additional reduction of LDL-apolipoprotein B 19% compared with gemfibrozil alone. In patients with type 4 hyperlipoproteinemia, gemfibrozil alone reduced triglycerides by 40%, raised HDL-cholesterol by 26%, and increased LDL-cholesterol levels by 29%. The addition of either colestipol or lovastatin reduced LDL-cholesterol levels by 34% and 33%, respectively (compared with gemfibrozil alone), but greater reductions of LDL-apolipoprotein B (30% with lovastatin compared with 15% with colestipol, compared with gemfibrozil alone), and increases in HDL-cholesterol levels (8% increase with lovastatin compared with 10% decrease with colestipol, compared to gemfibrozil alone) were seen with the lovastatin combination.",

    "36": "Rat adrenocortical cells are almost completely dependent upon the continuous supply of cholesterol derived from serum lipoproteins. However, a prolonged (5-day) administration of 4-aminopyrazolo-pyrimidine (4-APP), a potent hypocholesterolaemic drug, though provoking a notable decrease in the intra-adrenal concentration of esterified and free cholesterol, did not significantly affect basal plasma level of corticosterone. Morphometry showed a conspicuous hypertrophy of zona fasciculata cells, coupled with a striking proliferation of smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) and peroxisomes and with a profound lipid-droplet depletion. The secretory response of zona fasciculata cells to ACTH was still present, but reduced by half with respect to control rats. The simultaneous administration of mevinolin, an inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis, to 4-APP-treated rats caused an additional drop in the intracellular content of free cholesterol and notably lowered basal plasma corticosterone concentration. Mevinolin magnified the 4-APP-induced zona fasciculata cell hypertrophy, as well as SER and peroxisome proliferation. The secretory response to ACTH was completely suppressed. These data are compatible with the view that the morphological changes, which rat zona fasciculata cells undergo during prolonged hypocholesterolaemia, are the expression of the activation of the endogenous cholesterol synthesis. This compensatory response, enabling zona fasciculata cells to maintain a normal basal rate of hormonal output and to respond (though less efficiently) to their main physiological stimulus, seems to be completely independent of any activation of the hypothalamo-hyphophyseal axis, since dexamethasone/ACTH treated rats were used. The hypothesis is advanced that the mechanism underlying this response may involve the decrease of the intracellular free-cholesterol pool.", 
    "37": "The chemical syntheses of a number of 4,4-dimethyl substituted 15-oxygenated sterols have been pursued to permit evaluation of their activity in the inhibition of the biosynthesis of cholesterol and other biological effects.

Also prepared for use in the biological experiments were 4,4-dimethyl-5 alpha-cholest-7-ene-3 beta,15 alpha-diol, 4,4-dimethyl-5 alpha-cholest-8-ene-3 beta,15 alpha-diol and 4,4-dimethyl-5 alpha-cholest-8(14)-ene-3 beta,7 alpha,15 alpha-triol. The effects of twelve 4,4-dimethyl substituted 15-oxygenated sterols and of four 4,4-dimethyl substituted 32-oxygenated sterols on sterol synthesis and on the level of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity were evaluated in mouse L cells. With the exception of 4,4-dimethyl-5 alpha-cholest-8(14)-ene-3 beta,7 alpha,15 alpha-triol, all of the 4,4-dimethyl substituted 15-oxygenated sterols caused a 50% inhibition of sterol synthesis at less than 10(-6) M and six of the 4,4-dimethyl substituted 15-oxygenated sterols caused a 50% inhibition of sterol synthesis at less than 10(-7) M. 4,4-Dimethyl-14 alpha-ethyl-5 alpha-cholest-7-ene-3 beta,15 alpha-diol caused a 50% decrease in sterol synthesis at 10(-8) M. The potencies of the 4,4-dimethyl substituted 15-oxygenated and C-32-oxygenated sterols with respect to inhibition of sterol synthesis and suppression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity have been compared with those of the corresponding sterols lacking the 4,4-dimethyl substitution.", 
    "38": "We have examined the effects of different inhibitors of glycosylation processing on the proliferation of a spontaneously transformed murine cell line (3T6) in vitro. It was found that whereas two compounds that specifically inhibit distal steps in the glycosylation chain (swainsonine and castanospermine) only exerted marginal inhibitory effects on cell multiplication, a proximal inhibitor (tunicamycin) efficiently decreased the rate of DNA synthesis in a dose-dependent fashion. This tunicamycin-induced inhibitory effect on cell proliferation was cell cycle-specific, in the sense that cells in G1 only were blocked in their cell cycle progression. Like others (Volpe & Goldberg, 1983), we found that tunicamycin inhibited the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A reductase (HMG-CoA), which constitutes the ratelimiting step in the biosynthesis of cholesterol and isoprenoid derivatives, by catalysing the reduction of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, and it has been suggested that it plays a role in the control of cell proliferation and in tumour transformation. This raises the question as to whether tunicamycin exerts its inhibitory effects on cell proliferation via the isprene-synthetic pathway in addition to its effects on aspargine-linked glycosylation. By adding exogenous mevalonate, the rate-limiting step at which HMG-CoA reductase converts HMG-CoA to mevalonate can be bypassed. We found that addition of mevalonate partially reverses the effects of tunicamycin on cell proliferation. This suggests that tunicamycin exerts different effects, which taken together lead to a cessation of cell proliferation. One of these effects is likely to be mediated via the mevalonate-synthetic pathway.", 
    "39": "Lovastatin is the first 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor approved for the treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia. It is indicated as adjunctive therapy to dietary control and should be initiated at 20 mg/d in the evening. With higher dosages, twice-daily dosing is preferred, particularly when the dosage reaches the maximum recommended 80 mg/d. Compared with other drugs available, lovastatin has been shown to have good efficacy and a low incidence of side effects. Limited pharmacokinetic information available from the manufacturer reports absorption approximately 30 percent, protein binding greater than 95 percent, and a dual pathway for elimination through both urine (10 percent) and feces (83 percent). The drug has been clinically tested versus placebo and in combination with other cholesterol-lowering drugs. Lovastatin is effective in lowering total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 25-30 percent, with nonfamilial (hypercholesterolemic) patients responding better than those with the familial form of the disease. One percent of lovastatin patients have discontinued therapy because of intolerable side effects. The most common complaints are flatulence and diarrhea; more severe abnormalities include elevation of liver enzymes and an unclear propensity for producing lens opacities. The monthly cost to a patient taking 20 mg/d is approximately $44. Although the drug should be added to hospital formularies, long-term safety experience and competition from other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors will determine lovastatin's final therapeutic role.", 
    "40": "The effects of dietary administration (0.1% in diet for 8 days) of 5 alpha-cholest-8(14)-en-3 beta-ol-15-one on the levels of activity of cytosolic acetoacetyl coenzyme A thiolase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) synthase, and microsomal HMG-CoA reductase in liver have been studied in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Significant increases in the levels of activity of acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase and of HMG-CoA synthase were observed. The levels of microsomal HMG-CoA reductase activity were increased, relative to pair-fed control animals, in three experiments and increased, relative to ad libitum control animals, in one of three experiments. When compared with other agents for which the primary mode of action is an inhibition of the intestinal absorption of cholesterol, the magnitude of the increases in the levels of hepatic microsomal HMG-CoA reductase activity in the 15-ketosterol-fed rats was considerably smaller. In view of the previously described marked activity of the 15-ketosterol in the inhibition of the intestinal absorption of cholesterol, as well as its known effects in lowering HMG-CoA reductase activity in mammalian cells in culture, it is proposed that the 15-ketosterol may suppress the elevated levels of hepatic microsomal HMG-CoA reductase activity induced by the reduced delivery of cholesterol to liver as a consequence of the inhibition of the intestinal absorption of cholesterol.", 
    "41": "The enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) is subject to multivalent feedback suppression mediated by sterols and non-sterol substances derived from mevalonate, the product of the enzyme. To dissect the mechanism for this multivalent effect, Chinese hamster ovary cells were incubated with sterols contained in plasma lipoproteins and with a high concentration (100 microM) of compactin, an inhibitor of the reductase. Under these conditions, the amounts of HMG-CoA reductase protein and catalytic activity were high, although the cells were saturated with sterols, as reflected by active synthesis of cholesteryl esters. The amount of enzyme fell by 99% when the cells received excess mevalonate in addition to sterols. This decline was not associated with a fall in levels of reductase messenger RNA (mRNA). Rather, it was attributable to an 80% decline in translation of the mRNA, coupled with a 5-fold increase in the rate of degradation of reductase protein, as revealed by pulse-chase experiments with [35S]methionine. Considered together with previous data, these findings suggest a multilevel mechanism for multivalent regulation of HMG-CoA reductase. We suggest that sterols suppress the enzyme incompletely by partially repressing transcription of the gene and that nonsterol products derived from mevalonate further reduce the enzyme by inhibiting translation of the mRNA. Sterols and non-sterol products, acting together, accelerate the degradation of reductase protein. This combination of transcriptional and posttranscriptional controls can regulate the amount of reductase protein over a several hundred-fold range in animal cells.",

In addition, significant cytotoxicity was observed when this sterol was incubated with hepatoma and lymphoma cells in culture.", 
    "43": "In this paper, we examined whether the development of atherosclerosis in the Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbit, an animal model of familial hypercholesterolemia in man, could be prevented by the reduction of serum cholesterol levels. Pravastatin sodium (the generic name of CS-514), a potent inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, was used as a cholesterol-lowering drug. The drug was administered orally to 12 WHHL rabbits (2-3 months old) at a dose of 50 mg/kg per day for 24 weeks, and 13 animals were given water as control. In the treated group, serum cholesterol, phospholipid and triacylglycerol levels were significantly reduced by 28%, 32% and 16%, respectively, as compared with those of the control group. Although the prevention of development of the aortic atherosclerosis was not significant, the progression of coronary atherosclerosis was significantly prevented. The incidence of atherosclerosis in four main coronary arteries was reduced from 42% (control group) to 19% (treated group, P less than 0.01), and the development of lesion of coronary arteries evaluated by area of lesion was reduced from 19.7% (control group) to 9.1% (treated group, P less than 0.05). Histopathological findings supported the above observations. In addition, development of xanthoma in digital joints was also reduced from 90.4% (control group) to 58.3% (treated group, P less than 0.005). These results suggest that the development of coronary atherosclerosis and xanthoma in WHHL rabbit was reduced by continuous reduction of serum cholesterol levels treated with pravastatin sodium.", 
    "44": "The nephrotic syndrome is characterized by proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, and hypercholesterolemia. Hypertriglyceridemia often is present as well. In this study, the kinetics of plasma lipoproteins were investigated in four patients with nephrotic hyperlipidemia, and repeat studies were carried out in three of these patients during therapy with lovastatin. Before lovastatin therapy, the patients had an extremely delayed catabolism of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) without evidence of overproduction of lipoproteins in this fraction. Three of four patients had elevated levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL) that were due mainly to increased production rates for LDL. In the three patients treated with lovastatin, the drug therapy lowered plasma concentrations of total cholesterol, triglycerides, VLDL-cholesterol, and LDL-cholesterol, and raised high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol. Lovastatin therapy decreased VLDL-triglycerides primarily by enhancing their catabolism, and lowered LDL-cholesterol levels mainly by reducing input rates for LDL. Overall, lovastatin appears to be an effective drug for the treatment of hyperlipidemia in the nephrotic syndrome.", 
    "45": "The effect of CS-514 (eptastatin, Sankyo Co., Tokyo), a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, was investigated in 47 patients with hypercholesterolemia (WHO type IIa: 27, IIb: 20). Ten or 20 mg of CS-514 was administered daily for 3 months. In both types of patient, total cholesterol and phospholipid levels were significantly reduced by CS-514. The triglyceride, cholesterol and phospholipid content of low density lipoprotein (LDL) and the plasma levels of apolipoprotein B were also decreased in both groups. In contrast, total triglyceride, very low density lipoprotein (VLDL)-triglyceride and apolipoprotein C-II were decreased only in type IIb subjects. Also the levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and apolipoproteins A-I and A-II were increased by CS-514 in IIb but not in IIa patients. In both groups, no change occurred in either the cholesterol/triglyceride or phospholipid ratio in any lipoprotein fraction, nor in the ratio of HDL-cholesterol to apolipoprotein A-I or A-II, respectively. Therefore, CS-514 suppresses plasma levels of cholesterol in hypercholesterolemic patients without modifying lipoprotein composition. Moreover, this drug has different effects on the levels of plasma triglyceride and HDL-cholesterol of type IIa and IIb patients.", 
    "46": "3 beta-Hydroxycompactin, a hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, is a useful drug as an anticholesterolemic agent. However, in some patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, treatment was associated with a rebound in serum cholesterol concentration when the dose was increased from 10 to 40 mg/day. The rebound was more remarkable when the basal cholesterol level was lowered by cholestyramine and/or probucol. The phenomenon seems to be due to an induction of HMG-CoA reductase as seen in some animals and cultured cells.", 
    "47": "In the normal fed rat, both 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) synthase and HMG-CoA reductase are found in high concentrations in hepatocytes that are localized periportally. The majority of the liver cells show little or no evidence of either enzyme. Addition of cholestyramine and mevinolin to the diet resulted in all liver cells showing strong positive staining for both HMG-CoA reductase and HMG-CoA synthase. These two drugs increased the hepatic HMG-CoA reductase and HMG-CoA synthase activities 92- and 6-fold, respectively, and also increased the HMG-CoA reductase activity in intestine, heart, and kidney 3- to 15-fold. We used immunofluorescence and avidin-biotin labeled antibody to localize HMG-CoA reductase in the rat intestine. In rats fed a normal diet, the most HMG-CoA reductase-positive cells were the villi of the ileum greater than jejunum greater than duodenum. Crypt cells showed no evidence of HMG-CoA reductase. Addition of cholestyramine and mevinolin to the diet led to a dramatic increase in the concentration of HMG-CoA reductase in the apical region of the villi of the ileum and jejunum and in the crypt cells of the duodenum. Hence these two drugs affected both the relative concentration and distribution of intestinal HMG-CoA reductase. Cholestyramine and mevinolin feeding induced in the liver, but not intestine, whorls of smooth endoplasmic reticulum that were proximal to the nucleus and contained high concentrations of HMG-CoA reductase. Administration of mevalonolactone led to the rapid dissolution of the hepatic whorls within 15 min, at a time when there is little or no change in the mass of HMG-CoA reductase. We conclude that the whorls are present in the livers of rats fed cholestyramine and mevinolin because the cells are deprived of a cellular product normally synthesized from mevalonate.", 
    "48": "After an extensive searching for a microbial product that inhibits cholesterol synthesis, compactin and a series of related metabolites like monacolin K (mevinolin) have been isolated from molds as active agents. These compounds, which were structurally related to hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A, were potent competitive inhibitors of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis. The inhibition was reversible and the inhibitor constant Ki for compactin was around 10(-9) M. Compactin inhibited cholesterol synthesis in mammalian cells at 10(-9) M. Sterol synthesis in vivo was also reduced when compactin was given orally to rats at a dose of 50 mg/kg. Hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity of both cultured cells and rat liver was elevated when sterol synthesis was strongly inhibited by compactin. Both the growth inhibition and reductase induction could be overcome by the presence of mevalonate. A compactin-resistant cell line of mouse FM3A cells, called CR200, was developed by stepwise selection. CR200-cells had an abnormally high level of reductase activity and amplified reductase gene. Compactin was not able to lower plasma cholesterol levels in mice, rats, and hamsters. However, it was highly effective in rabbits, dogs, and monkeys; plasma cholesterol of dogs was reduced by 30%-40% at a dose of 20-50 mg/kg. The low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, which is responsible for atherosclerosis, was preferentially lowered. Compactin was also highly effective in hypercholesterolemic patients at a small dose. The results of the current studies have proved that compactin and related compounds are far more effective in lowering plasma cholesterol than any other drugs available.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "49": "N-[(1,5,9)-trimethyldecyl]-4 alpha,10-dimethyl-8-aza-trans-decal-3 beta-ol, a new compound rationally designed to inhibit the 2,3-oxidosqualene cyclase (M. Taton et al., Biochem. biophys. Res. Commun. 138, 764, 1986) was studied as an inhibitor of cholesterol biosynthesis in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts. Treatment of cells, which were grown for 2 days in a delipidated medium, resulted in a dramatic decrease of [14C]acetate incorporation into the C27-sterol fraction. An IC50 of 20 nM was calculated, which classes this drug amongst the most powerful cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitors acting at the 2,3-oxidosqualene-lanosterol cyclase tested so far on mammalian cells. The inhibition of the C27-sterols synthesis was correlated with the accumulation of 2,3-[14C]oxidosqualene and of 2,3:22,23-[14C]dioxidosqualene indicating that the cyclase was indeed an intracellular target of the drug. A minor secondary target was identified as the sterol-8-ene isomerase. Cells treated with the inhibitor also accumulated sterols more polar than cholesterol which could originate, for example, from the metabolization of 2,3:22,23-dioxidosqualene. Treatment of the cells with increasing concentrations of the drug resulted in a progressive reduction of the HMG-CoA reductase activity (up to 50% of control). The drug affected normal growth of the fibroblasts and growth arrest was correlated with a decrease in cellular cholesterol content to less than 50% of control. This work indicates that N-[(1,5,9)-trimethyldecyl]-4 alpha,10-dimethyl-8-aza-trans-decal-3 beta-ol is a potent and promising new tool in the inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis in mammalian cells.", 
    "50": "We studied the effects of simvastatin (MK 733), a new competitive inhibitor of HMG CoA reductase, alone and in combination with a bile acid sequestrant, cholestyramine, on serum levels of lipoproteins and apoproteins A1 and B, in 24 patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. After simvastatin treatment (40 mg/day) alone for 12 weeks, serum total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased by 31 and 36 percent respectively. With the addition of cholestyramine, there was a 41 per cent total decrease in serum cholesterol from the control value and a 50 percent decrease in low density lipoprotein cholesterol. After cholestyramine treatment alone for 12 weeks, serum total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased by 20 percent and 29 percent respectively. With the addition of simvastatin (20 mg per day), there was a 32 percent total decrease in serum cholesterol from the control value and a 43 percent decrease in low density lipoprotein cholesterol. High density lipoprotein cholesterol remained unchanged. No major adverse effect was observed. If long term safety can be confirmed, the simvastatin-cholestyramine regimen may prove useful in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "51": "The effect of 24 weeks of treatment with simvastatin, a new HMG coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (dosages of 20 and 40 mg day-1) on serum lipid, lipoprotein and apolipoprotein A-I and B concentrations as well as safety parameters and subjective side effects were studied in 11 patients with familial (FH) and 10 patients with polygenic hypercholesterolaemia (P-HC). The effects on plasma lipoprotein and apolipoprotein concentrations had already been achieved after four weeks in both groups and then remained during the study. In FH, mean fasting plasma total cholesterol concentration decreased from 10.51 to 6.71 mmol l-1 (36%), and in P-HC from 6.55 to 4.54 mmol l-1 (31%) at 24 weeks (P less than 0.001). Mean plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations also decreased, in FH from 8.87 to 5.05 mmol l-1 (43%) and in P-HC from 4.97 to 3.12 mmol l-1 (37%) at 24 weeks (P less than 0.001). Furthermore, apolipoprotein B concentrations decreased significantly from 2.21 to 1.57 g l-1 (29%) (less than 0.001) in FH and from 1.53 to 1.09 g l-1 (29%) (P less than 0.01) in P-HC. Plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol increased in both FH and P-HC during treatment. Increases were seen in both the subfractions HDL2 and HDL3. Simvastatin was well tolerated. No serious clinical or laboratory adverse effects were observed. It is concluded that 24 weeks of treatment with simvastatin in doses up to 40 mg day-1 effectively reduces plasma total and LDL cholesterol concentrations without causing subjective or significant objective side effects. Thus, simvastatin may be of great interest in future studies for prevention of coronary heart disease due to hypercholesterolaemia.", 
    "52": "The impact of lowering the ovarian L(iver)-type lipase activity on cholesterol homeostasis in the ovaries was studied in superovulated rats. L-type lipase activity increased rapidly after injection with chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) (day 0), its activity remained high between days 3 and 8. During this period plasma progesterone and 20 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone were raised. The ovarian content of unesterified cholesterol remained constant during this period while cholesterol esters increased. Lowering of the L-type lipase activity by in vivo treatment with anti-liver lipase (ALLA) during 4-5 h did not affect plasma hormones or ovarian cholesterol contents. However, de novo cholesterol synthesis in the ovaries was significantly increased by about 40%. After pretreatment of the rats with aminogluthetimide, ALLA administration led to a 250% increase in de novo cholesterol synthesis in the unesterified cholesterol fraction, but was without effect on plasma hormones and on the ovarian cholesterol content. Administration of the cholesterol synthesis inhibitor Simvastatin led to a 25% lowering in ovarian cholesterol synthesis without effect on plasma hormones or ovarian cholesterol content. Additional administration of ALLA affected only the plasma progesterone (-30%). These results indicate that L-type lipase is involved in ovarian cholesterol homeostasis.", 
    "53": "Radiation inactivation analysis of liver pieces yielded a target size of 210 kDa for hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase [S)-mevalonate:NADP+ oxidoreductase (CoA-acylating), EC 1.1.1.34) from rats fed a normal diet. Feeding a diet containing mevinolin and colestipol, which causes a marked increase in enzyme activity, resulted in a reduction of the target size to 120 kDa. These results are consistent with those obtained by radiation inactivation and immunoblotting analysis of isolated microsomes and suggest that the increase in HMG-CoA reductase activity caused by these dietary agents is accompanied by a change from a dimer to a monomer form of the enzyme.", 
    "54": "A diet containing cholesterol and cholic acid (SID) is known to induce the formation of cholesterol fatty liver as well as cholesterol gallstones. The activity of HMG-CoA reductase, one of the key enzymes for cholesterol synthesis in the liver, is significantly lowered by addition of beta-muricholic acid to SID. The prevention of fatty liver formation by beta-muricholic acid was accompanied by the suppression of HMG-CoA reductase activity.", 
    "55": "Mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae resistant to mevinolin, a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme-A (HMGCoA) reductase (EC1.1.1.34) were isolated and one mutant (MV71) was extensively characterized. While growth of resistant strains in the presence of mevinolin was growth. Diploids produced by mutant/wild-type matings showed levels of mevinolin resistance which indicated incomplete dominance. Sterol synthesis in the presence of mevinolin was inhibited in strain MV71 but to a lesser degree than seen in the wild-type strain. All mevinolin resistant mutants also demonstrated a slight resistance to the antibiotic nystatin. The subcellular location of HMGCoA reductase activity in MV71 and the wild-type strain were determined and it was shown that yeast HMGCoA reductase is not regulated by a dephosphorylation mechanism as has been shown for mammalian reductases. In vivo and in vitro studies of strain MV71 and the wild-type indicated that mevinolin resistance did not result in changes in HNGCoA reductase activity as has been demonstrated in mammalian systems. Based on growth data, sterol analysis, and the lack of detection of HMGCoA reductase activity differences between strain MV71 and the wild-type, mevinolin resistance is concluded to result possibly from a mutation in HMG2, one of the two functional yeast HMGCoA reductase genes, which accounts for a minor (up to 17%) amount of total cellular reductase activity.", 
    "56": "The ability of simvastatin, a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, to lower lipid levels in 16 patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia was compared with that of bezafibrate in a 16-week, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled trial that was continued in an open crossover fashion. Simvastatin was better than bezafibrate at lowering total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and apolipoprotein B concentrations (30.4% [p less than 0.001], 37.3% [p less than 0.001], and 37.8% [p less than 0.001] vs 17.0%, 19.6%, and 24.0%, respectively). Both drugs increased the high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I, but this change was significant only with bezafibrate (p less than 0.05). Bezafibrate and simvastatin reduced triglycerides by 25.6% (p less than 0.001) and 13.7% (p less than 0.05), respectively. Very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-cholesterol was significantly reduced only by bezafibrate (44.3%, p less than 0.001). Both drugs were tolerated well and no serious side-effects were noted. The results show that simvastatin was more effective than bezafibrate in lowering total-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B, while bezafibrate was better at lowering triglycerides and VLDL-cholesterol and at raising HDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I.", 
    "57": "Lithocholic acid (LCA)-induced intrahepatic cholestasis is associated with increased de novo synthesis of hepatic cholesterol and augmented cholesterol content of the liver cell plasma membrane fraction enriched in bile canalicular complexes (BCM). To determine whether inhibition of cholesterol synthesis could prevent LCA-induced cholestasis, adult male Wistar rats were treated daily with the hypocholesterolemic agents, clofibrate (250 mg/kg) or mevinolin (25 mg/kg), for one, two or four days. After bile duct cannulation and bile collection for one hr, the animals were injected intravenously with 120 mumoles/kg of LCA or its carrier (albumin). Cholesterol synthesis was measured in liver homogenates, and its contribution to the BCM was estimated. LCA reduced bile flow by 51%, 35% and 25% after clofibrate pretreatment for one, two and four days, respectively, and by 51%, 30% and 42% in mevinolin-pretreated animals after one, two and four days. In control animals, cholesterol synthesis and the contribution of newly synthesized cholesterol in the BCM were increased after LCA injection. However, despite that cholesterol synthesis and the contribution of newly synthesized cholesterol in the BCM were reduced in drug-pretreated rats, LCA injection caused a relative increase in these parameters of a magnitude similar to that observed in controls. Thus, the ability of LCA injection to augment de novo cholesterol synthesis and its transport to the BCM may be an important pathogenetic step in the development of cholestasis.", 
    "58": "Hyperlipidemic obese Zucker rats develop albuminuria and spontaneous focal glomerulosclerosis (FGS) at an early age, despite normal glomerular capillary pressures and nephron plasma flows. To investigate the role of abnormal lipid metabolism in the pathogenesis of FGS, pharmacologic agents were used to reduce serum lipids in male, obese Zucker rats. Eight rats were treated from 8 to 40 weeks of age with the cholesterol synthesis inhibitor, mevinolin (group I). A separate group of seven obese rats was treated with the structurally-unrelated lipid lowering agent, clofibric acid (group II). Results from these two groups were compared to controls injected with vehicle only (group III). Body weight and food intake were similar in all three groups. Mevinolin reduced both serum cholesterol and fasting triglyceride levels while clofibric acid lowered only serum cholesterol. Urine albumin excretion was reduced in groups I and II compared to group III. Mesangial matrix expansion and cellularity were both reduced by mevinolin and clofibric acid. In addition, the percent of glomeruli with focal glomerulosclerosis was much less in groups I (0.4 +/- 0.1%) and II (1.3 +/- 0.7%) compared to group III (4.6 +/- 0.7%, P less than 0.05). Micropuncture studies, carried out in separate groups of obese rats, demonstrated that mevinolin and clofibric acid did not affect glomerular hemodynamic function. Although the precise mechanism remains to be defined, these results suggest that abnormal lipid metabolism may be important in the pathogenesis of FGS.", 
    "59": "Familial dysbetalipoproteinemia is characterized by hyperlipidemia, increases in beta-migrating, very low density lipoproteins (beta-VLDL), and homozygosity for apolipoprotein E2 (apo E2). In this study, 3 patients with familial dysbetalipoproteinemia were treated with lovastatin, and kinetics for apolipoprotein B (apo B) were determined in control and drug treatment periods. Multicompartmental analyses of apo B kinetics in VLDL and in low density lipoproteins (LDL) were carried out. Lovastatin therapy generally lowered plasma concentrations of apo B and cholesterol in VLDL and LDL. The reductions in concentrations were due mainly to a decrease in transport (production) rates for these fractions. Indeed, the fractional clearance rate (FCR) for LDL-apo B was reduced during lovastatin therapy. The decreased transport rate for VLDL-apo B and LDL-apo B could have been due to an inhibition of the synthesis of lipoproteins containing apo B. An alternate explanation is that lovastatin promoted direct removal of a rapidly-catabolized fraction of VLDL-apo B that is a precursor for longer-lived lipoproteins in the circulation; this mechanism could decrease input rates of identifiable lipoprotein species and retard their clearance because of \"saturation\" of LDL receptors by more rapidly removed lipoproteins. Finally, both mechanisms, i.e., decreased production and increased clearance of lipoproteins, may have contributed to the fall in VLDL-apo B and LDL-apo B concentrations during lovastatin therapy.", 
    "60": "Administration of lovastatin to male, Sprague-Dawley rats by addition of the drug to the normal chow diet caused a two-fold increase in the activity of the hepatic mitochondrial outer carnitine palmitoyltransferase, but lovastatin apparently did not affect the sensitivity of the outer carnitine palmitoyltransferase to inhibition by malonyl-CoA. There was also no effect of lovastatin on the activity of the hepatic mitochondrial inner carnitine palmitoyltransferase. Feeding of cholestyramine to rats did not affect either the mitochondrial outer carnitine palmitoyltransferase or the mitochondrial inner carnitine palmitoyltransferase.", 
    "61": "Recent data obtained using cultured rat hepatocytes showed that bile acids do not inhibit bile acid synthesis, whereas cholesterol concentrations vary in parallel with bile acid synthesis (Davis et al. (1983. J. Biol. Chem. 258: 4079-4082). This led us to re-evaluate in vivo experiments upon which the consensus that bile acid synthesis is primarily regulated by bile acid \"negative feedback\" is based. Infusion of taurocholate into either the jugular vein or duodenum of bile-diverted rats stimulated biliary cholesterol secretion and bile flow, but it did not inhibit bile acid synthesis. The lack of an inhibitory effect was evident using several different infusion rates of taurocholate. Even at the greatest rate of taurocholate infusion (25 mumol/(100 g.hr] there was no significant inhibition of bile acid synthesis. In contrast, infusing mevinolin (1 mg/hr), a potent competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, almost completely inhibited bile acid synthesis and biliary cholesterol secretion. Since mevinolin did not affect bile flow, these results cannot be ascribed to bile secretory failure. Thus, while these studies suggest that taurocholate may not regulate bile acid synthesis directly via negative feedback, cholesterol is likely to act as a positive effector of bile acid synthesis.", 
    "62": "The chemical syntheses of a number of C27 ring C oxygenated sterols have been pursued to permit evaluation of their activity in the inhibition of sterol biosynthesis in cultured mammalian cells. Thus, 5 alpha-cholest-7-ene-3 beta, 11 alpha-diol, 3 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-cholest-9(11)-en-12-one, and the previously unreported 11 alpha-hydroxy-5 alpha-cholest-7-en-3-one, 5 alpha-cholest-9(11)-ene-3,12-dione, and 3 beta-hydroxy-5 alpha-cholest-9 (11)-en-12-one have been synthesized. The effects of these compounds on the synthesis of digitonin-precipitable sterols from labeled acetate in mouse L cells and on the levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity in the same cells have been investigated and compared with previously published data on other ring C oxygenated sterols. 5 alpha-Cholest-7-ene-3 beta, 11 alpha-diol was shown to be the most potent inhibitor of sterol synthesis.", 
    "63": "The role of lipid abnormalities in the pathogenesis of focal glomerulosclerosis was investigated in the rat remnant kidney model of chronic renal failure. Rats subjected to right nephrectomy and two-thirds segmental infarction of the left kidney (5/6 nephrectomy) were treated for 10 weeks with the lipid-lowering agent clofibric acid. Both serum cholesterol and urine albumin excretion were significantly reduced by clofibric acid. At 10 weeks, the percent of glomeruli with focal glomerulosclerosis was 5 +/- 2% in clofibric acid-treated and 24 +/- 5% in untreated 5/6 nephrectomy rats (p less than 0.01). Inulin clearance was greater in clofibric acid-treated than in untreated 5/6 nephrectomy rats (0.28 +/- 0.02 versus 0.22 +/- 0.02 ml/min 100 g body wt, p less than 0.05). Body weight, kidney weight, and systemic blood pressure were not significantly altered by clofibric acid. Micropuncture studies, performed in separate groups of clofibric acid-treated and untreated 5/6 nephrectomy rats, demonstrated elevated single nephron glomerular filtration rates and glomerular capillary pressures 4 weeks after surgery. However, clofibric acid did not significantly alter single nephron glomerular filtration rates (95 +/- 2.1 nl/min in treated versus 97.0 +/- 6.2 nl/min in untreated, p greater than 0.05) or glomerular capillary pressures (56.6 +/- 1.5 mm Hg in treated versus 57.8 +/- 0.8 mm Hg in untreated, p greater than 0.05) in 5/6 nephrectomy rats. In a separate set of experiments, 5/6 nephrectomy rats were treated with the specific cholesterol synthesis inhibitor, mevinolin. Mevinolin improved serum lipid levels and reduced albuminuria in 5/6 nephrectomy rats without causing significant alterations in blood pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "64": "Simvastatin (MK-733), a new inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, was administered to 38 patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia for 24 weeks. A dose of 40 mg per day produced a mean reduction in low density lipoprotein cholesterol of 43-45% and in triglycerides of 21-31%. Mean high density lipoprotein cholesterol increased significantly by 10-13%. There were no major differences in response whether the drug was taken in one or two doses. MK-733 was tolerated well. Adverse effects were infrequent and limited to slight increases of alanine aminotransferase, creatine phosphokinase and bilirubin. This drug appears to be a potent inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis and has produced the largest therapeutic response as monotherapy in patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia.", 
    "65": "CS-514 ((+)-sodium (3R,5R)-3,5-dihydroxy-7-[(1S,2S,6S,8S,8aR)-6-hydroxy-2- methyl-8-[(S)-2-methyl-butyryl]-1,2,6,7,8-hexahydro-1-naphthyl] heptanoate) which was recently synthesized as an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase lowers serum cholesterol levels. This compound inhibited cholesterol synthesis dose-dependently from acetate in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes. At high concentration (0.5 and 5.0 mumol/l), but not at lower concentration, it inhibited bile formation from acetate. Low density lipoprotein (LDL)-[3H]-cholesteryl linoleate incorporation into hepatocytes was increased when the cells were preincubated with 0.5 or 5.0 mumol/l CS-514 for 12 h. Bile formation from LDL-[3H]-cholesterol linoleate was not affected by addition of CS-514. These results suggest that inhibition of de novo cholesterol synthesis by CS-514 enhanced LDL receptor function in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes and lowered LDL-cholesterol level.", 
    "66": "We have used monoclonal antibodies to statin (S-44) and a cyclin-like protein (S-132) to examine the distribution of these two antigens in proliferating and in nonproliferating populations of cells. We have found that this cyclin-like protein is present in proliferating fibroblasts, whereas statin is absent from these same cell populations; in contrast, in senescent populations of fibroblasts the cyclin-like antigen disappears and statin labeling of nuclei appears. During myogenesis in rat muscle cell cultures, S-132 labeling is present in proliferating myoblasts and disappears after cells fuse and differentiate as multinucleated myotubes. In contrast, statin is absent from proliferating myoblasts, but appears when these cells become postmitotic and begin to differentiate. Similar results were seen during chick myogenesis. We have also found similar results during serum-starvation-induced differentiation in neuroblastoma cells. These results indicate that the cyclin-like protein disappears and statin appears upon commitment to differentiation in vitro, and the presence or the absence of these proteins appears to provide cellular markers for the transition from the proliferative to the nonproliferative state during differentiation.", 
    "67": "In this paper we studied the properties of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase (HMG-CoA lyase) in human skin fibroblasts. The enzyme was found to exhibit an absolute requirement for divalent cations such as magnesium. Furthermore, dithiothreitol was necessary for full activity. The enzyme was found to be maximally active at pH 9.25. When measured at this pH in the presence of magnesium and dithiothreitol enzyme activity was high enough to be determined by simple spectrophotometry by measuring the amounts of acetoacetate produced. The results obtained suggest that the large variation in the values reported in literature for the activity of HMG-CoA lyase in human skin fibroblasts is due to the fact that the enzyme shows little activity at pH values below 8.", 
    "68": "Coronary heart disease is an important cause of death in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and is particularly common in diabetic populations that have relatively high levels of plasma cholesterol. To determine whether plasma cholesterol levels in patients with NIDDM could be reduced by drug therapy, we assessed the effect of lovastatin, a potent inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled manner in 16 white patients with NIDDM and mild to moderate elevations of plasma cholesterol. Lovastatin (20 mg twice daily) or a placebo was given for four weeks, during which blood glucose concentrations remained controlled. As compared with the placebo, lovastatin reduced total cholesterol by 26 percent, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 28 percent, and LDL apolipoprotein B by 26 percent. Lovastatin therapy also reduced plasma triglycerides and very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 31 percent and 42 percent, respectively. Although there was no change in the plasma level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, the ratio of total cholesterol to HDL cholesterol fell by 29 percent. No side effects or abnormalities in serum values were noted during short-term lovastatin therapy. The beneficial effects of lovastatin on plasma lipid levels in patients with NIDDM could decrease the risk of the development of coronary heart disease.", 
    "69": "The chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, dosage and administration, and adverse effects of lovastatin are reviewed. Lovastatin is the first agent marketed in a new class of pharmacologic compounds called the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors. By competitively inhibiting HMG CoA reductase, the drug disrupts the biosynthesis of cholesterol in hepatic and peripheral cells. This increases the synthesis of low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) receptors and thereby increases the uptake of LDL cholesterol from the plasma. In doses of 20 to 80 mg daily, lovastatin decreases total and LDL cholesterol concentrations 25 to 45%. It also substantially reduces concentrations of triglycerides, very-low-density-lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B and slightly increases high-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations. Lovastatin is effective in patients with heterozygous familial and nonfamilial (polygenic) hypercholesterolemia but is ineffective in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. It is also effective in combination with bile acid sequestrants, nicotinic acid, and gemfibrozil. Administration of lovastatin once daily in the evening (to enhance compliance) or twice daily is recommended to maximize the drug's cholesterol-lowering effects. Headache and gastrointestinal complaints are the most common adverse effects. Treatment has been withdrawn from 1.9% of patients receiving the drug because of elevated aminotransferase concentrations. The relationship of lovastatin to the development of lens opacities requires further evaluation. Lovastatin is highly effective in the treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia and represents an important therapeutic advance. Safety with long-term use and effect on coronary heart disease remain to be established.", 
    "70": "In FH, abnormalities of the gene encoding the receptor for LDL lead to hypercholesterolemia and premature atherosclerosis. A method to identify LDL receptor defects using peripheral blood lymphocytes has been developed. When endogenous synthesis of cholesterol was blocked, proliferation of mitogen-stimulated normal human lymphocytes was markedly inhibited unless an exogenous source of sterol was supplied. When exogenous sterol was provided as a plasma lipoprotein, LDL receptor-mediated interaction with apolipoprotein-B or -E was essential for the provision of cholesterol to normal human lymphocytes. Thus, functional LDL receptors were necessary to permit proliferation of normal lymphocytes in these cultures. Lymphocytes from patients heterozygous for abnormalities in the LDL receptor gene can be distinguished from normal lymphocytes by their diminished functional LDL receptor activity. Of interest, following treatment with plasma cholesterol-lowering agents, functional lymphocyte LDL receptor activity normalized in some but not all patients with heterozygous FH, whereas plasma LDL cholesterol levels decreased in all patients. These results suggest that therapy with plasma cholesterol-lowering agents can lead to increased expression of LDL receptors by lymphocytes in the majority of patients with heterozygous FH. The failure of some heterozygous FH patients to increase functional LDL receptor activity after prolonged therapy indicates that there is heterogeneity in these patients despite a similar capacity of the therapy to decrease plasma LDL cholesterol. Variability in the expression of the normal LDL receptor gene in individual T lymphocytes may account for some of these findings.", 
    "71": "Simvastatin (MK733), derived from lovastatin by substituting CH3 for H at the 2' position, is a potent hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitor. Its cholesterol-lowering effect in 40 patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia was more pronounced (an LDL-cholesterol reduction of 43%) than that of cholestyramine monotherapy in a matched group of 20 patients (30% reduction). The combination of the 2 drugs for 50 patients who tolerated cholestyramine was even more effective (a 54% reduction of LDL-cholesterol). The other changes were as follows: total cholesterol (simvastatin [S] -36%, cholestyramine [C] -23%, both drugs in combination [S + C] -45%); HDL-cholesterol (S +16%, C +9%, S + C +20%); triglyceride (S -21%, C +11%, S + C -17%); and the apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A ratio (S -51%, C -39%, S + C -67%). Cholestyramine caused more gastrointestinal adverse effects (12 of 20 patients), whereas a transaminase increase was seen both with cholestyramine (2 of 20 patients) and simvastatin (3 of 40 patients) and with the combination (6 of 50 patients). Treatment with simvastatin decreases the atherogenic potential of plasma more than cholestyramine monotherapy and causes fewer adverse effects. For those patients who tolerate cholestyramine, the combination of the drugs is even more potent."
