We assessed the effects of rosuvastatin on the risk of developing renal impairment or renal failure among participants in the rosuvastatin clinical development program.", 
    "1": "The analysis was based on AE data reported by investigators from 36 studies that included 40,600 participants who did not have advanced, pre-existing renal disease. Rates of renal AEs were determined based on time to first occurrence of renal impairment or renal failure.", 
    "2": "Renal impairment or renal failure was reported in 536 study participants during 72,488 patient-years of follow-up. Renal event rates were higher in patients with history of heart failure (n = 5011), hypertension (n = 21,864), diabetes (n = 5165), or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) (n = 9507) at baseline but did not differ with rosuvastatin compared with placebo or with rosuvastatin 40 mg compared with rosuvastatin 10mg. Relative risk (RR) estimates obtained from pooled analysis of placebo-controlled trials were RR: 1.03 (95% CI: 0.86-1.23, p = 0.777) for any reported renal impairment or renal failure event, RR: 1.02 (95% CI: 0.76-1.37, p = 0.894) for serious renal AEs, and RR: 0.70 (95% CI: 0.36-1.35, p = 0.282) for renal AEs leading to death.",

    "4": "Stroke patients have a high risk of vascular recurrence. Biomarkers related to vascular recurrence, however, remain to be identified. The aim of the study was to identify, through proteomic analysis, plasma biomarkers associated with vascular recurrence within one year after the first ischemic stroke. This is a substudy (n = 134) of a large prospective multicenter study of post-stroke patients with an ischemic stroke. Plasma samples were obtained at inclusion. Among the identified proteins, only plasma levels of desmoplakin I were associated with protection against a new vascular event (Odds ratio: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.46-0.89; p = 0.009) after adjustment for hypercholesterolemia, statins and previous atherothrombotic stroke subtype. A greater number of patients without vascular recurrence had been treated with statins within three months of the recent ischemic stroke. Only patients who had been taking statins for 3 months after the ischemic stroke and did not suffer vascular recurrence over a follow-up year, have higher levels of desmoplakin I at the time of inclusion (Odds ratio 0.49; 95% CI: 0.28-0.86; p = 0.013). Increased desmoplakin I levels, determined within 1-3 months of the first ischemic stroke, could be a biomarker for statin responsiveness against a new vascular event in post-ischemic stroke patients taking statins early (1-3 months) after the ischemic stroke.", 
    "5": "Several landmark studies have recently been published in nephrology. In summary, mycophenolate mofetil is superior to azathioprine in maintaining remission and preventing relapse in lupus nephritis. For patients with type I diabetes, long-term renal function is better preserved when optimal glycaemic control is obtained with intensive diabetes therapy from the onset of disease, and in patients with type 2 diabetes treatment with bardexolone may increase renal function. With respect to chronic kidney disease, the association of simvastatine and ezetimibe is effective in improving cardiovascular outcomes. There is no need to initiate dialysis in asymptomatic patients, and daily haemodialysis seems better than three times weekly hemodialysis. Finally, N-acetylcysteine does not prevent contrast nephropathy.", 
    "6": "The published evidence on strategies for avoiding the discontinuation of statin therapy due to muscular adverse effects is reviewed.", 
    "7": "Statin medications are a cornerstone of the prevention and treatment of coronary heart disease, but about 20% of treated patients develop myalgia or other muscle-related adverse effects that can lead to the discontinuation of statin use. As there are no consensus guidelines or firm practice recommendations on continuing or reinitiating statin therapy in patients who experience statin-related muscular adverse effects, a literature search was conducted to evaluate a variety of strategies that have been studied. The search results indicated that the most widely used strategies are (1) alternative statin dosing, (2) co-enzyme Q10 supplementation, (3) vitamin D supplementation, (4) conversion to red yeast rice (RYR) therapy, and (5) conversion to a different statin. While positive results in some patients have been reported with all of the strategies reviewed, the available evidence is insufficient to support the routine use of any of the strategies in clinical practice. In particular, the use of RYR, which contains a naturally occurring statin, is not recommended due to limited and inconsistent study results and uncertainty about the contents of commercially available RYR products.", 
    "8": "In patients intolerant to statin therapy due to myalgia or other muscular adverse effects, strategies such as alternative statin dosing schedules, coenzyme Q10 or vitamin D supplementation, and conversion to RYR or an alternative statin may allow some patients to continue to receive the benefits of lipid-lowering therapy.", 
    "9": "Angiotensin receptor 1 blockers (ARB) are standard nephroprotective drugs in chronic kidney disease. There is less evidence for a nephroprotective effect of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and much less is known about potential benefits of combination therapy. We evaluated the therapeutic potential of a statin alone or in combination with an ARB in experimental chronic kidney disease.", 
    "10": "Subtotally nephrectomized (5/6 Nx) rats were treated early with vehicle, losartan, cerivastatin or losartan/cerivastatin. Expression of messenger RNA (mRNA) was assessed by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Tissue proteins were localized by immunohistochemistry. Nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) activation was measured in whole kidneys.", 
    "11": "In contrast to the sham group, at 6 weeks, vehicle-treated 5/6 Nx rats displayed renal lesions, albuminuria and increased blood pressure, serum creatinine and total kidney NF-\u03baB p65 DNA-binding activity and preproendothelin-1, fibronectin and type I and III collagen mRNA. NF-\u03baB activation correlated with albuminuria and histological renal injury. Losartan or combination therapy preserved renal function, abrogated albuminuria and improved glomerular and interstitial histology. Cerivastatin alone preserved renal function and improved interstitial injury but did not influence albuminuria, glomerular histology or NF-\u03baB activation. Losartan/cerivastatin normalized kidney NF-\u03baB activation and extracellular matrix mRNA expression pattern. The effect of losartan alone on these parameters was less intense. All treatments decreased preproendothelin-1 mRNA and preserved interstitial capillaries.", 
    "12": "In a chronic kidney disease model, early treatment with either an ARB or a statin preserved renal function although the mechanisms differed. Combination therapy with an ARB and a statin did not confer clear-cut advantages on biochemical and histological parameters over ARB alone, although it further improved the kidney NF-\u03baB and gene expression profile.", 
    "13": "Retrospective cohort studies have suggested that statin users have a lower prevalence of dementia. On the other hand, a randomized controlled study failed to show beneficial effects on the cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, a prospective cohort study demonstrated that users of statins had a lower incidence of AD. One possible interpretation might be that statins could prevent or delay the onset of AD, but not slow cognitive decline once the disease has set in. Given that statins could prevent or delay the onset of AD, what is the responsible mechanism?", 
    "14": "We investigated the effect of fluvastatin on A\u03b2 metabolism at a clinically relevant dose in mice.", 
    "15": "Fluvastatin reduced the brain A\u03b2 level by increased trafficking of the carboxyl terminal fragment of the amyloid precursor protein (APP-CTF), which was mediated by inhibition of protein isoprenylation. Moreover, the statin reduced the brain A\u03b2 level through enhanced A\u03b2 clearance mediated by upregulation of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP-1) expression. The statin increased LRP-1 expression, mediated by inhibition of protein isoprenylation.", 
    "16": "Statins might prevent the onset of AD through reduced A\u03b2 production by enhancement of APP-CTF degradation and/or upregulation of A\u03b2 clearance. We also showed that promotion of APP-CTF degradation and upregulation of A\u03b2 clearance could be modified by a drug, suggesting possible mechanistic targets for disease-modifying drugs.", 
    "17": "Recent secondary prevention trials have failed to demonstrate a beneficial effect of n-3 fatty acids on cardiovascular outcomes, which may be due to the growing use of statins since the mid-1990s. The aim of the present study was to assess whether statins modify the effects of n-3 fatty acids on major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with a history of myocardial infarction (MI).", 
    "18": "Patients who participated in the Alpha Omega Trial were divided into consistent statin users (n = 3740) and consistent statin non-users (n = 413). In these two groups of patients, the effects of an additional daily amount of 400 mg eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) plus docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), 2 g \u03b1-linolenic acid (ALA), or both on major cardiovascular events were evaluated. Multivariable Cox's proportional hazard models were used to calculate adjusted hazard rate ratios (HR(adj)). Among the statin users 495 (13%) and among the statin non-users 62 (15%) developed a major cardiovascular event. In statin users, an additional amount of n-3 fatty acids did not reduce cardiovascular events [HR(adj) 1.02; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.80, 1.31; P = 0.88]. In statin non-users, however, only 9% of those who received EPA-DHA plus ALA experienced an event compared with 18% in the placebo group (HR(adj) 0.46; 95% CI: 0.21, 1.01; P= 0.051).", 
    "19": "In patients with a history of MI who are not treated with statins, low-dose supplementation with n-3 fatty acids may reduce major cardiovascular events. This study suggests that statin treatment modifies the effects of n-3 fatty acids on the incidence of major cardiovascular events.", 
    "20": "Septic syndromes are the main cause of death in the intensive care units and although the mortality rates is slowly decreasing, the occurrence of the disease has been increasing. The pathogenesis of sepsis includes countless disturbances of the host immune system starting with a harmful, infection-triggered exaggerated inflammatory cascade, followed by the development of an immunoparalysis state. The latter contributes to the failure in pathogen eradication and leads to secondary infections, which are often the cause of fatal complications. In this review, we consider different novel therapeutic strategies for restoration of immune function. The use of glucocorticoids, intravenous immunoglobulins, heparin, recombinant human activated protein C, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, interferon-\u03b3, statins, macrolides and high-volume hemofiltration are discussed. Even though some clinical trials of these regimens are promising, the key to their successful application seems to be the precise monitoring of the status of immune system followed by implementation of the adequate therapy. Thus, in this paper we present disturbances in the immune system in the course of human sepsis, with special attention to the parameters that could be monitored and serve as markers for immunomodulatory therapies. We conclude by briefly presenting the current sepsis treatment strategy.",

We excluded all limb salvage procedures and included only those that were undergoing their first intervention for claudication due to SFA disease. We recorded patient demographics, comorbidities, perioperative medications, TASC classification, and runoff. Outcomes included complications, restenosis, symptom recurrence, reinterventions, major amputation, and mortality.", 
    "23": "We identified 113 bypass grafts and 105 PTA/S of femoral-popliteal lesions without prior interventions. Bypasses were above the knee in 62% (45% vein) and below the knee in 38% (100% vein). Mean age was 63 (bypass) versus 69 (PTA/S; P < .01). Mean length of stay (LOS) was 3.9 versus 1.2 days (P < .01). Bypass grafts were used less for TASC A (17% vs 40%; P < .01) and more for TASC C (36% vs 11%; P < .01) and TASC D (13% vs 3%; P < .01) lesions. There were no differences in perioperative (2% vs 0%; not significant [NS]) or 3-year mortality (9% vs 8%; NS). Wound infection was higher with bypass (16% vs 0%; P < .01). None involved grafts. Bypass showed improved freedom from restenosis (73% vs 42% at 3 years; hazard ratio [HR], 0.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], .23-.71), symptom recurrence (70% and 36% at 3 years; HR, 0.37; 95% CI, .2-.56), and freedom from symptoms at last follow-up (83% vs 49%; HR, 0.18; 95% CI, .08-.40). There was no difference in freedom from reintervention (77% vs 66% at 3 years; NS). Multivariable analysis of all patients showed that restenosis was predicted by PTA/S (HR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.4-4.4) and TASC D (HR, 3.7; 95% CI, 3.5-9) lesions. Recurrence of symptoms was similarly predicted by PTA/S (HR, 3.0; 95% CI, 1.8-5) and TASC D lesions (HR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.4-7). Statin use postoperatively was predictive of patency (HR, 0.6; 95% CI, .35-.97) and freedom from recurrent symptoms (HR, 0.6; 95% CI, .36-.93).", 
    "24": "Surgical bypass for the primary treatment of claudication showed improved freedom from restenosis and symptom relief despite treatment of more extensive disease, but was associated with increased LOS and wound infection.

Sites originated from 17 different countries. Most sites scored less than half the maximum Q score (26; range 5-17). Mean total SMU scores for each statin group were lower than 50% of the maximum (45; range of 0-28). There were no statistically significant differences between statins. General contraindications were absent in 92.4% of sites and contraindicated medicines in 47.3%. Key warnings on the appearance of symptoms associated with myopathy, liver disease, hypersensitivity, and pancreatitis were absent in 37, 48.4, 91.3, and 96.2% of sites, respectively. Most websites presented a chaotic and incomplete list of known side effects; just 13 (7.1%) presented a list compatible with current prescribing information. Only two-thirds (65.8%) attempted to describe any in lay language.",

    "34": "In addition to their cholesterol lowering ability, statins have proven pleiotropic effects in the cardiovascular system. Chronic inflammation with interactions between platelets and endothelial cells leads to an upregulation of activity markers of atherosclerosis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of simvastatin and atorvastatin on platelets and endothelial cells in an in vitro endothelial cell model.", 
    "35": "After a 24 h incubation period with either simvastatin or atorvastatin (1 \u03bcmol/L), human umbilical vein endothelial cells were stimulated for 1 h with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and were then incubated in direct contact with activated platelets. Platelet surface expression of CD40L and CD62P and expression of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, uPAR and MT1-MMP on endothelial cells were measured by flow cytometry. Supernatants were analyzed by ELISA for soluble MMP-1. The increased expression of VCAM-1 and uPAR on endothelial cells by stimulation with LPS and by direct contact with activated platelets was significantly reduced to a similar extent through pre-incubation with both atorvastatin and simvastatin (p < 0.05). Platelets without endothelial cell contact, but in direct contact with either statin, showed similar significant reductions in surface expression of CD40L (p < 0.005).", 
    "36": "These effects may explain the ability of statins to reduce the progression of atherosclerosis in addition to their cholesterol-lowering properties.", 
    "37": "We investigated the possible protective effect of atorvastatin against vascular dysfunction associated with insulin resistance (IR) in fructose-fed model rats. The effect of atorvastatin (10 mg/kg/day for 8 weeks) on vascular reactivity, glucose, cholesterol, insulin, and the IR index in a well-established model of dietary hypertriglyceridemia, the fructose-fed rat, was investigated. Fructose feeding (10% fructose in drinking water for 8 weeks) induced hypercholesterolemia and hyperinsulinemia without any change in blood glucose levels. Fructose feeding also elevated serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), the insulin resistance index, leukocyte infiltration, and endothelial cell pyknosis. Fructose feeding induced hyper-responsiveness to both phenylephrine (PE), KCl, and hyporesponsiveness to acetylcholine (Ach) but not to sodium nitroprusside-induced relaxation. Atorvastatin, given concurrently with fructose, reduced hypercholesterolemia, hyperinsulinemia, TNF-\u03b1 level, and the IR index. It also reduced leukocyte infiltration and endothelial cell pyknosis and decreased hyper-responsiveness to both PE and KCl but did not affect hyporesponsiveness to Ach relaxation. In conclusion, atorvastatin protected against impairment in aortic vascular reactivity associated with insulin resistance, particularly increased contractility, but not reduced endothelium-dependent relaxation, by a mechanism involving a reduction in cholesterol and IR in addition to anti-inflammatory effects.",

    "44": "Overall, 4030 patients were randomized to statin therapy and 4022 patients to the control group. The effect of statins on mortality was not significant (OR 0.81, 95% CI: 0.58-1.12; P=0.198). The 10 trials were divided up by the mean time of initiation of statin therapy (day 1, day 2 and day 3). Statins reduced mortality when treatment was initiated in day 1 (OR 0.63, 95% CI: 0.41-0.99; P=0.045), not in day 2 or day 3.

Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol is the major risk factor of this condition that can be intervened by means of lifestyle modification and pharmacologic treatment. Adequacy of hypercholesterolemia treatment with lipid lowering drugs in Thailand needed to be more clarified. The present study was conducted to determine low-density cholesterol goal attainment in Thai population at risk for developing ASCVD.", 
    "47": "Twenty-seven physicians with their 909 hypercholesterolemic patients whose age of > or = 18 years, actively under pharmacologic treatment for at least three months with no dose adjustment for a minimum of six weeks from seven centers across Thailand were enrolled. Plasma glucose, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglyceride levels were measured after overnight fast. Demographic and other relevant data including information on lipid lowering drug used were retrieved. Patients' awareness, knowledge on their management, compliance, and satisfaction were evaluated by questionnaire survey as well as physicians' use of guidelines, choice of management and goal setting, and their attitudes towards lipid management. Cardiovascular risk level and LDL goal were assessed by the updated 2004 NCEP-ATP III guidelines.", 
    "48": "All patients had LDL goal of < 130 mg/dl with 86.1% needed LDL goal of < 100 mg/dL. Overall, 52.7% of the patients reached their LDL goal. The most prescribed treatment was statin monotherapy (82.7%). LDL goal attainment was inversely associated with LDL goal set by NCEP-ATP III according to the patients' risk profile, with only 16.7% of those who were in the very high risk group with LDL goal of < 70 mg/dL achieved their goal whereas 60.6% and 84.7% of those with high (LDL goal < 100 mg/dl) and moderately high-risk (LDL goal < 130 mg/dl) achieved their goal, respectively (p < 0.001). Other factors associated with less favorable LDL goal attainment were coronary heart disease, carotid artery disease, diabetes, 10-year risk of > 20%, and metabolic syndrome (p < 0.05 for all). Type of lipid lowering drug was not significantly associated with LDL goal attainment.", 
    "49": "LDL goal attainment was not achieved in a high proportion of Thai patients especially in those who had high to very high risk for developing cardiovascular disease.

Methylation of the ER\u03b1 gene can reduce ER\u03b1 expression leading to a higher risk for cardiovascular disease. Recently, microRNAs have been found to regulate DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) and thus control methylation status in several genes. We first searched for microRNAs involved in DNMT-associated DNA methylation in the ER\u03b1 gene. We also tested whether statin and a traditional Chinese medicine (San-Huang-Xie-Xin-Tang, SHXXT) could exert a therapeutic effect on microRNA, DNMT and ER\u03b1 methylation.", 
    "51": "The ER\u03b1 expression was decreased and ER\u03b1 methylation was increased in LPS-treated human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) and the aorta from rats under a high-fat diet. MicroRNA-152 was found to be down regulated in the LPS-treated HASMCs. We validated that microRNA-152 can knock down DNMT1 in HASMCs leading to hypermethylation of the ER\u03b1 gene. Statin had no effect on microRNA-152, DNMT1 or ER\u03b1 expression. On the contrary, SHXXT could restore microRNA-152, decrease DNMT1 and increase ER\u03b1 expression in both cellular and animal studies.", 
    "52": "The present study showed that microRNA-152 decreases under the pro-atherosclerotic conditions. The reduced microRNA-152 can lose an inhibitory effect on DNA methyltransferase, which leads to hypermethylation of the ER\u03b1 gene and a decrease of ER\u03b1 level. Although statin can not reverse these cascade proatherosclerotic changes, the SHXXT shows a promising effect to inhibit this unwanted signaling pathway.",

Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) was performed and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1), and high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels were measured at baseline and 12-month follow-up.", 
    "55": "At 12-month follow-up, we found: 1) IVUS revealed that minimal lumen cross-sectional area (CSA) increased but plaque/media (P&M) area and plaque burden decreased. A total of 25 soft plaques (50%) were transformed into fibrous plaques. 2) ApoB, MMP-9 and hsCRP levels decreased, but TIMP-1 level increased. 3) Stepwise multivariate linear regression analysis showed that the independent predictors for changes in P&M area/year were the decrease in MMP-9 and hsCRP levels.",

    "59": "Whole transcriptome microarrays in HGT-1 gastric cancer cells demonstrated that lovastatin strongly suppressed expression of genes involved in cell division, while docetaxel had very little transcriptional effects. Both drugs triggered apoptosis, and their combination was more than additive. A marked rise in the cell-cycle inhibitor p21, together with reduction of aurora kinases A and B, cyclins B1 and D1 proteins was induced by lovastatin alone or in combination with docetaxel. The drug treatments induced the proteolytic cleavage of procaspase-3, a drop of the anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 protein, Poly-ADP-Ribose Polymerase and Bax. Strikingly, docetaxel-resistant HGT-1 cell derivatives overexpressing the MDR-1 gene were much more sensitive to lovastatin than docetaxel-sensitive cells.",

    "65": "Oxidant stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. In the late 1980s, biological studies demonstrated that oxygen-free radicals oxidize low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, resulting in the creation of foam cells and inciting the cascade of biological events that ultimately result in the formation of atherosclerosis. In vitro studies showed the ability of antioxidant vitamins to scavenge free radicals and block the oxidation of low-density lipoprotein. This data was supported in vivo by early observational studies suggesting the benefit of antioxidants, particularly vitamin E, in the prevention of coronary artery disease. On the basis of these studies, the use of antioxidant supplements by the general population increased substantially and became a multibillion dollar industry. Despite strong biological evidence and promising observational data, more rigorous scientific evaluation did not support a causational relationship between vitamin supplements and lowering coronary artery disease risk. Several prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials showed no benefit and possibly harmful effects. Therapies such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and statins, which are known to have benefit in preventing and treating atherosclerosis by reducing blood pressure and cholesterol, also have a \"pleiotropic\" effect in reducing the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Advances in molecular biology and the study of ROS led to a better understanding of the mechanisms that govern their production and role in atherogenesis. This progress identified unforeseen pathways by which these drugs favorably alter the balance in ROS production, and have raised possibilities for future targeted therapies in the prevention of atherosclerosis.", 
    "66": "Mipomersen is an antisense oligonucleotide inhibitor of apolipoprotein (apo) B-100 currently in phase 3 of development for the treatment of hyperlipidemia in patients with a high risk for cardiovascular disease. The drug acts by inhibiting the production of apoB-100, which is the structural core for all atherogenic lipids, including low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The agent has been shown to produce significant reductions in LDL-C from baseline values compared with placebos. Clinical trials have demonstrated that mipomersen reduces LDL-C up to 44% in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia and patients with significantly elevated LDL despite taking maximum doses of statins. Unlike other medications that target apoB-100, such as microsomal triglyceride transfer proteins, mipomersen does not cause hepatic steatosis or intestinal steatosis and does not affect dietary fat absorption. Adverse side effects encountered with mipomersen include flu-like symptoms, injection site reactions, and elevated liver transaminases. If future studies continue to show such promising results, mipomersen would likely be a viable additional lipid-lowering therapy for patients who are at high cardiovascular risk, intolerant to statins, and/or not at target lipid levels despite maximum doses of statin therapy. Clinical outcome studies looking at cardiovascular disease end points still need to be done.", 
    "67": "We prospectively examined the additional effects of highly purified eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) particularly on the vascular function of diabetic patients with hypercholesterolemia receiving statin therapy. We enrolled 28 patients with type 2 diabetes complicated by dyslipidemia who had been treated with statins for at least one year. The patients were randomly assigned to 2 groups: administration of statin alone (group S: n = 13) and addition of EPA to the current statin therapy (group SE: n = 15). The highly purified EPA was administered at a dose of 1,800 mg/day for 6 months. To evaluate vascular function, the duration of reactive hyperemia (DRH), which is the time required for forearm blood flow to return to the basal level after inducing reactive hyperemia, was measured using strain gauge plethysmography. There were no significant differences in the clinical background factors between the 2 groups. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels significantly decreased after 6 months only in group SE. Compared with the baseline data, no significant change in DRH was observed after 6 months in group S. By contrast, DRH was significantly prolonged after 6 months in group SE, indicating that the addition of highly purified EPA improved vascular function. Our results showed that in patients with type 2 diabetes and receiving statin therapy whose LDL-C level was less than 100 mg/dL, the addition of highly purified EPA for 6 months significantly improved vascular function.", 
    "68": "Active processes involved in drug metabolization and distribution mediated by enzymes, transporters, or binding partners mostly occur simultaneously in various organs. However, a quantitative description of active processes is difficult because of limited experimental accessibility of tissue-specific protein activity in vivo. In this work, we present a novel approach to estimate in vivo activity of such enzymes or transporters that have an influence on drug pharmacokinetics. Tissue-specific mRNA expression is used as a surrogate for protein abundance and activity and is integrated into physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models that already represent detailed anatomical and physiological information. The new approach was evaluated using three publicly available databases: whole-genome expression microarrays from ArrayExpress, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction-derived gene expression estimates collected from the literature, and expressed sequence tags from UniGene. Expression data were preprocessed and stored in a customized database that was then used to build PBPK models for pravastatin in humans. These models represented drug uptake by organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1 and organic anion transporter 3, active efflux by multidrug resistance protein 2, and metabolization by sulfotransferases in liver, kidney, and/or intestine. Benchmarking of PBPK models based on gene expression data against alternative models with either a less complex model structure or randomly assigned gene expression values clearly demonstrated the superior model performance of the former. Besides accurate prediction of drug pharmacokinetics, integration of relative gene expression data in PBPK models offers the unique possibility to simultaneously investigate drug-drug interactions in all relevant organs because of the physiological representation of protein-mediated processes.",

We investigated the effects of atorvastatin on the oxidative phosphorylation and membrane fluidity in liver mitochondria, and also on the coenzyme Q (CoQ) content in the mitochondria, liver tissue, and plasma of rats on a standard (C) and hypercholesterolemic (HCh) diet. Atorvastatin was administered at either low (10 mg kg(-1)) or high dose (80 mg kg(-1)) for four weeks. The high dose of the drug decreased the concentrations of total cholesterol and triacylglycerols in the plasma and liver of rats on a HCh diet. Administration of atorvastatin was associated with decreased oxygen uptake (state 3), and oxidative phosphorylation rate in the mitochondria of both C and HCh rats. Further, the drug influenced mitochondrial membrane fluidity and dose-dependently reduced concentrations of oxidized and reduced forms of CoQ in the mitochondria. Our findings point to an association between in vivo administration of atorvastatin and impaired bioenergetics in the liver mitochondria of rats, regardless of diet, in conjunction with simultaneous depletion of oxidized and reduced CoQ forms from the mitochondria.

In our opinion, the benefits of the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease achieved with statins seem to outweigh the hazards associated with statin therapy. The careful selection of patients for both treatment with statins and the gradual intensification of physical training in the course of cardiac rehabilitation appears to constitute an important element of the therapeutic approach.", 
    "84": "The prevalence of obesity in the United States remains high, exceeding 30% in most states. As this trend continues unhindered, we will continue see a persistent rise in obesity-related metabolic effects\u2014hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and atherosclerosis. These diseases are also the leading causes of chronic kidney diseases and end-stage renal disease. The lipid nephrotoxicity hypothesis, proposed over three decades ago, suggested that proteinuria, decreased albumin levels, and the resultant hyperlipidemia may cause a glomerulosclerosis similar to atherosclerosis. More recent studies have demonstrated the role of oxidized high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles in the progression of kidney disease. Elucidation of the role of lipid-lowering therapies and the concomitant improvement in tubulointerstitial and glomerular diseases is a further evidence of the role of lipids in renal injury. Synergistic effects of lipid-lowering drugs and blockers of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in renal protection have also been documented. Dyslipidemia in renal disease is usually characterized by elevated LDL cholesterol, low HDL cholesterol, and high triglycerides. After an initial glomerular injury, likely to be inflammatory, a series of self-perpetuating events occur. Increased glomerular basement permeability leads to loss of lipoprotein lipase activators, which results in hyperlipidemia. Circulating LDL has a charge affinity for glycoaminoglycans in the glomerular basement membrane and further increases its permeability. Substantial amounts of filtered lipoprotein cause proliferation of mesangial cells. Proximal tubules reabsorb some of the filtered lipoprotein, and the remainder is altered during passage through the nephron. If intraluminal pH is close to the isoelectric point of the apoprotein, luminal apoprotein will precipitate, causing tubulointerstitial disease. This review shows the evidence for the role of lipids in development of chronic renal disease, the pathophysiology of lipid nephrotoxicity, and strategies available to clinicians to slow the progression of disease.",

The CSF concentrations of \u03b1sAPP and A\u03b242 in patients and controls were not significantly different. There was a significant inverse correlation in patientsbetween CSF \u03b1sAPP concentration and the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), but no significant correlation between CSF A\u03b242 concentration and EDSS. The concentration of \u03b1sAPP in the CSF of statin-treated patients was significantly higher than in those not treated with statins, suggesting that statins may have a neuroprotective effect.

Patients received either 10 mg/day rosuvastatin (n = 18) or 20 mg/day atorvastatin (n = 18), orally, for 4 weeks. Serum lipids, high-sensitivity Creactive protein (hsCRP), Rho-associated coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK) activity and flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery were assessed before and after therapy. Both statins produced significant reductions in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglyceride and hsCRP levels, and significant increases in FMD. Both statins significantly reduced ROCK activity and inhibition was significantly greater with rosuvastatin. There was no correlation between ROCK activity and LDL-C level in either group. There was a significant correlation between ROCK activity and FMD for both statins, but no correlations between FMD and LDL-C or hsCRP levels. Short-term treatment with either rosuvastatin or atorvastatin inhibits ROCK activity independent of cholesterol reduction, and improves endothelium dysfunction in patients with atherosclerosis.",

Twenty-eight elderly men participated in the investigation and were assigned either in a control (n = 14) or in a statin therapy group (n = 14). All participants performed two isokinetic eccentric exercise bouts separated by 3 weeks. Muscle damage indices, resting energy expenditure, substrate metabolism, lipid and lipoprotein profile, as well as insulin sensitivity, were evaluated before and after eccentric. No differences in muscle function were observed between the two groups either at rest or after exercise. Eccentric exercise increased resting energy expenditure, increased fat oxidation, improved lipid profile, and increased insulin resistance 2 days after both eccentric exercise bouts. However, these changes appeared to lesser extent after the second bout. No differences were observed in the responses in the health-related parameters in the control and in the statin therapy group. Eccentric exercise affected similarly the control and the atorvastatin-treated individuals. The present results indicate that atorvastatin-treated elderly individuals may participate in various physical activities, even high-intensity muscle-damaging activities, without negative impact on muscle function and adaptation.",

Therefore, the current study focused on the cardiac remodelling from hypertrophy to fibrosis in old-aged spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), and explored the therapeutic effects of Rosuvastatin and its possible mechanism(s) of action. Spontaneously hypertensive rats at age 52 weeks were randomly divided into three groups, the first two to receive Rosuvastatin at a dose of 20 mg/kg/day and 40 mg/kg/day, respectively, and the third to receive placebo, which was to be compared with Wistar-Kyoto as controls. After 2-month treatment, SBP, heart to body weight ratio (HW/BW%) and echocardiographic features were evaluated, followed by haematoxylin and eosin and Masson trichrome staining in conjunction with qPCR of foetal gene expressions. Transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labelling assay and immunofluorescent labelling for active caspase-3 were used to detect the apoptotic cardiomyocytes. Signaling pathways involved were examined by using western blot. Old-aged SHR developed end-stage hypertensive heart disease characterized by significant enhancement of HW/BW%, LVAWd and LVPWd, and decreased LVEF and LVFS, accompanied by cardiomyocytes enlargement and fibrosis along with activation of foetal gene programme. Cardiac apoptosis increased significantly during the transition process. Rosuvastatin reduced hypertrophy significantly via AT(1) Receptor-PKC\u03b22/\u03b1-ERK-c-fos pathway; protected myocardium against apoptosis via Akt-FOXO1, Bcl-2 family and survivin pathways and consequently suppressed the caspase-3 activity. The present study revealed that old-aged SHRs developed cardiac remodelling from hypertrophy to fibrosis via cardiac apoptosis during the end stage of hypertensive heart disease. These pathological changes might be the consequence of activation of AT(1) Receptor-PKC\u03b22/\u03b1-ERK-c-fos and AKT-FOXO1/Bcl-2/survivin/Caspase3 signaling.

Dyslipidemia is a well-established risk factor for CVD and plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Statins, which inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase and lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, have emerged as the most effective therapy to date against atherothrombotic CVD. Although their role in secondary prevention of CVD is undisputed, it remains a topic for debate as to how widely they should be used for primary prevention. The Framingham Risk Score and the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines are the cornerstones for the current guidelines for primary prevention statin therapy. Although these guidelines serve as help to evaluate cardiovascular risk and effectively identify many patients who will benefit from statin therapy, there is a growing population of \"intermediate-risk\" patients who may be undertreated. Additional noninvasive tests may complement the traditional risk scores, potentially expanding the indications for statins.",

Although JH has been shown to control this age-dependent plasticity, the underlying signaling pathway remains obscure. In this context, we cloned a full cDNA encoding the Kr\u00fcppel homolog 1 transcription factor (AipsKr-h1) of A. ipsilon, which was found to be predominantly expressed in ALs, where its amount increased concomitantly with age and sex pheromone responses. Conversely, the expression of AipsKr-h1 protein in the antenna was age-independent. Moreover, the administration of JH in immature males or fluvastatin, an inhibitor of JH biosynthesis, in mature males induced an increase or a decline of the AipsKr-h1 protein level in ALs, respectively. This effect was suppressed with a combined injection of fluvastatin and JH. Our results showed that Aipskr-h1 is a JH-upregulated gene that might mediate JH action on central pheromone processing, modulating sexual behavior in A. ipsilon.",

The reduction in TC and non-HDL-C was accompanied by down-regulation of hepatic SREBP-2 and HMG-CoA reductase. Aorta from DPA n-3 and DHA groups was found to have significantly lesser tension and relax better than that from the control and DPA n-6 hamsters, largely mediated by their inhibition on the gene expression of cycloxygense-2 (COX-2).

FT-IR and DSC were studied for interaction between drug and excipients if any. Forced degradation and accelerated stability studies were conducted for optimized SNEDDS. ATVF 04 and 11 were selected as optimized SNEDDS due to their smaller mean globule size (75.2 and 85.8 nm respectively), lower turbidity values, faster drug release and higher DE values among the other SNEDDS. The optimized ATV SNEDDS were not affected by the pH of dissolution medium. FT-IR study revealed no interaction between drug and excipients used.

Targeted drug therapy to prevent the progression of calcific AS disease should ideally be based on the knowledge of risk factors and the molecular pathogenesis of the disease. Treatment trials using various drugs have been undertaken to test whether medical therapy (statins, renin-angiotensin inhibition and anti-osteoporosis drugs) can prevent or beneficially modify the disease course. Although retrospective and non-randomized studies suggested a positive effect of statins, benefit has not been seen in perspective randomized controlled trials. Inhibition of renin-angiotensin has shown discordant results in retrospective studies with no randomized controlled data published. In the future, we need to consider other medical therapies (antiosteoporosis drugs are attractive candidates) that might target different pathways in this disease process.

Since OS is frequently associated with renal dysfunction, we aimed to investigate the effect of hypolipidemic drugs on oxidative stress and plasma taurine (Tau), a sulfur amino acid with a marked antioxidant effect, in chronic kidney disease (CKD). We enrolled 30 CKD randomized to receive three different hypolipidemic regimens for 12 months: simvastatin alone (40 mg/day) or ezetimibe/simvastatin combined therapy (10/20 or 10/40 mg/day). Low molecular weight (LMW) thiols including homocysteine, cysteine, cysteinylglycine, glutathione, and glutamylcysteine in their reduced and total form and oxidative stress indices as malondialdehyde (MDA) and allantoin/uric acid (All/UA) ratio were also evaluated.

The 2009 JUPITER trial showed a significant decrease in DVT in non-hyperlipidemic patients, with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, treated with rosuvastatin. The effects of statins on thrombosis are unclear, prompting this literature review. A literature search was performed (1950 to February 2011) with MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PUBMED databases including the following keywords: \"statins\", \"hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors\", \"VTE\", \"PE\", \"DVT\", and either \"anti-coagulation\" or \"inflammation\". Editorials, reviews, case reports, meta-analysis and duplicates were excluded. Inflammatory biomarkers of DVT, include interleukin (IL)-6, CRP, IL-8, and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1). Statin therapy reduces IL-6 expression of CRP and MCP-1, usually elevated in VTE. Reduction of IL-6 induced MCP-1 has been linked to vein wall fibrosis, promoting post thrombotic syndrome (PTS) and recurrent DVT in patients. Also, our review suggests that the anti-thrombotic effects are likely exhibited through the anti-inflammatory properties of statins. This work supports that statin therapy has the ability to decrease the incidence and recurrence of VTE and the potential to decrease PTS. This is mainly due to the anti-inflammatory effects of statins and may explain why normolipidemic patients, with elevated CRP, appear to have the greatest reduction in VTE. Given their low risk of bleeding, statins have the potential to serve as a safe adjunctive pharmacological therapy to current treatments in select patients with VTE, however further investigations into this concept are needed and essential.",

The correlation between the therapy consisting in OAC and amiodaronum or statines drugs association and International Normalized Ratio (INR), revealed a high level of anticoagulation and an increase of hemorragic complications.", 
    "167": "Statin therapy reduces the risk of occlusive vascular events, but uncertainty remains about potential effects on cancer. We sought to provide a detailed assessment of any effects on cancer of lowering LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) with a statin using individual patient records from 175,000 patients in 27 large-scale statin trials.",

Reducing LDL-C with a statin for about 5 years had no effect on newly diagnosed cancer or on death from such cancers in either the trials of statin versus control (cancer incidence: 3755 [1.4% per year [py]] versus 3738 [1.4% py], RR 1.00 [95% CI 0.96-1.05]; cancer mortality: 1365 [0.5% py] versus 1358 [0.5% py], RR 1.00 [95% CI 0.93-1.08]) or in the trials of more versus less statin (cancer incidence: 1466 [1.6% py] vs 1472 [1.6% py], RR 1.00 [95% CI 0.93-1.07]; cancer mortality: 447 [0.5% py] versus 481 [0.5% py], RR 0.93 [95% CI 0.82-1.06]). Moreover, there was no evidence of any effect of reducing LDL-C with statin therapy on cancer incidence or mortality at any of 23 individual categories of sites, with increasing years of treatment, for any individual statin, or in any given subgroup. In particular, among individuals with low baseline LDL-C (<2 mmol/L), there was no evidence that further LDL-C reduction (from about 1.7 to 1.3 mmol/L) increased cancer risk (381 [1.6% py] versus 408 [1.7% py]; RR 0.92 [99% CI 0.76-1.10]).",

    "170": "Several reports have shown the therapeutic effect of statins on bone formation and neovascularization. However, the effect of the systemic administration of statins is limited due to its metabolism in the liver and clearance in the digestive system. In addition, high-dose administration may cause adverse side effects. To avoid low-efficacy/frequent side effects of high-dose statin treatment, we utilized biodegradable gelatin hydrogel as a drug delivery system of statin for fracture healing. A femoral fracture was created in rats with periosteum cauterization leading to nonunion at 8 weeks postfracture. Rats received local administration of either simvastatin-conjugated gelatin hydrogel (ST-Gel group) or gelatin hydrogel alone (Gel group). Approximately 70% of animals in the ST-Gel group achieved fracture union radiographically and histologically, while only 7% of animals achieved fracture healing in the Gel group. Functional bone healing was also significantly greater with increased angiogenesis- and osteogenesis-related growth factor expressions in periosteal granulation tissue in the ST-Gel group than in the Gel group. Simvastatin locally applied with gelatin hydrogel to fracture sites at a dose similar to that used in clinical settings successfully induced fracture union in a rat unhealing bone fracture model via its effect on both angiogenesis and osteogenesis.", 
    "171": "Skeletal muscle has the ability to regenerate new muscle fibers after injury. The process of new muscle formation requires that quiescent mononuclear muscle precursor cells (myoblasts) become activated, proliferate, differentiate, and fuse into multinucleated myotubes which, in turn, undergo further differentiation and mature to form functional muscle fibers. Previous data demonstrated the crucial role played by 3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR), the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, in fetal rat myoblast (L6) differentiation. This finding, along with epidemiological studies assessing the myotoxic effect of statins, HMGR inhibitors, allowed us to speculate that HMGR could be strongly involved in skeletal muscle repair. Thus, our research was aimed at evaluating such involvement: in vitro and in vivo experiments were performed on both mouse adult satellite cell derived myoblasts (SCDM) and mouse muscles injured with cardiotoxin. Results demonstrate that HMGR inhibition by the statin Simvastatin reduces SCDM fusion index, fast MHC protein levels by 60% and slow MHC by 40%. Most importantly, HMGR inhibition delays skeletal muscle regeneration in vivo. Thus, besides complaining of myopathies, patients given Simvastatin could also undergo an impairment in muscle repair.", 
    "172": "The impact of postoperative atrial fibrillation (PAF) on patient outcomes has prompted intense investigation into the optimal methods for prevention and treatment of this complication. In the prevention of PAF, \u03b2-blockers and amiodarone are particularly effective and are recommended by guidelines. However, their use requires caution due to the possibility of drug-related adverse effects. Aside from these risks, perioperative prophylactic treatment with statins seems to be effective for preventing PAF and is associated with a low incidence of adverse effects. PAF can be treated by rhythm control, heart-rate control, and antithrombotic therapy. For the purpose of heart rate control, \u03b2-blockers, calcium-channel antagonists, and amiodarone are used. In patients with unstable hemodynamics, cardioversion may be performed for rhythm control. Antithrombotic therapy is used in addition to heart-rate maintenance therapy in cases of PAF >48-h duration or in cases with a history of cerebrovascular thromboembolism. Anticoagulation is the first choice for antithrombotic therapy, and anticoagulation management should focus on maintaining international normalized ratio (INRs) in the 2.0-3.0 range in patients <75 years of age, whereas prothrombin-time INR should be controlled to the 1.6-2.6 range in patients \u226575 years of age. In the future, dabigatran could be used for perioperative management of PAF, because it does not require regular monitoring and has a quick onset of action with short serum half-life. Preventing PAF is an important goal and requires specific perioperative management as well as other approaches. PAF is also associated with lifestyle-related diseases, which emphasizes the ongoing need for appropriate lifestyle management in individual patients.", 
    "173": "Statins are well-established and effective drugs in the treatment of hyperlipidemias. However the effects of statins extend beyond lipid-lowering. The pleiotropic effects of statins have been shown to modify inflammatory cell signaling of the immune response to infection. Statins have emerged as potential immunomodulatory and antioxidant agents that might impact on sepsis outcomes. It was postulated that statins may be candidates for the treatment of sepsis. Recent animal and human data suggest that statin therapy might be beneficial in patients before the onset of sepsis or in its initial period, but should be used with care when patients are diagnosed with severe sepsis or septic shock. Some analyses also provide evidence for statins as an adjuvant therapy in sepsis. Because of the divergent results of studies, the potential benefit needs to be validated in randomized, controlled trials. In this review, we describe current evidence on the use of statins in the prevention and treatment of sepsis.",

Nevertheless, statin use in vascular patients still remains underutilized and suboptimal. Ideally, statins should be initiated a minimum of 2 weeks before the procedure. Extended-release formulas may be preferable perioperatively to cover the first 1-2 days after the procedure when oral intake may not be feasible. Statins should be administered to all vascular disease patients, whether they are managed conservatively or are undergoing open surgical or endovascular procedures.", 
    "178": "Portal hypertension is a hemodynamic abnormality that involves a high risk of disability as well as a reduced life expectancy in patients with cirrhosis. Progress in the knowledge of pathophysiology of portal hypertension has opened a new perspective for different pharmacological approaches. In this context, the pleiotropic actions of statins on endothelial cell function have emerged as new options to reduce portal pressure levels by targeting multiple molecular pathways involved in hepatic vascular homeostasis. We highlight how statins may target some molecular pathways involved in the pathophysiology of portal hypertension and how these drugs may correct impaired hepatic vascular tone.", 
    "179": "Lowering low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels using statins can significantly reduce cardiovascular (CV) risk in patients with dyslipidemia. However, the risk of major vascular events in those attaining the maximum levels of LDL-C-reduction is only reduced by around one third, which leaves a substantial residual risk. The Emerging Risk Factors Collaboration has shown that low levels of high-density lipoprotein-C (HDL-C) are independent risk factors for CV disease. It is therefore important that treatment strategies for dyslipidemia should target HDL-C in addition to LDL-C. Raising HDL-C can be achieved by both lifestyle changes and pharmacological means. Therapeutic strategies include niacin, fibrates, thiazolidinediones, apolipoprotein A1 mimetics, cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors, statins and combinations thereof. In general, statins produce inconsistent increases in HDL-C. However, pitavastatin, a new member of the statin family that was launched in 2003, and rosuvastatin consistently elicit marked increases in HDL-C that are sustained over time. This supplement will discuss the contribution of HDL-C as a possible predictor and modifiable risk factor for CV disease and will examine the potential role for pitavastatin in reducing residual CV risk.",

    "201": "High cholesterol levels are a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, but their role in dementia and cognitive decline is less clear. This review highlights current knowledge on the role of cholesterol in late-life cognitive function, cognitive decline, and dementia. When measured in midlife, high cholesterol levels associate with an increased risk of late-life dementia and cognitive decline. However, when measured in late-life, high cholesterol levels show no association with cognitive function, or even show an inverse relation. Although statin treatment has been shown to associate with a lower risk of dementia and cognitive decline in observational studies, randomized controlled trials show no beneficial effect of statin treatment on late-life cognitive function. Lowering cholesterol levels may impair brain function, since cholesterol is essential for synapse formation and maturation and plays an important role in the regulation of signal transduction through its function as a component of the cell membrane. However, membrane cholesterol also plays a role in the formation and aggregation of amyloid-\u03b2. Factors that influence cholesterol metabolism, such as dietary intake, are shown to play a role in late-life cognitive function and the risk of dementia. In conclusion, cholesterol associates with late-life cognitive function, but the association is strongly age-dependent. There is no evidence that treatment with statins in late-life has a beneficial effect on cognitive function.",

Combination therapy was associated with higher elevations in homocysteine, blood urea nitrogen, and serum creatinine, whereas elevation in alanine aminotransferase was greater in the rosuvastatin group. Leukocyte count and hemoglobin level decreased to a greater extent in the combination group. The combination group showed greater reductions in TG and elevation in HDL-cholesterol.",

In previous studies, we showed that acute application in vitro of simvastatin caused impairment of mitochondrial function and dysfunction of calcium homeostasis in human and rat healthy muscle samples. We thus evaluated in the present study, mitochondrial function and calcium signaling in muscles of patients treated with statins, who present or not muscle symptoms, by oxygraphy and recording of calcium sparks, respectively. Patients treated with statins showed impairment of mitochondrial respiration that involved mainly the complex I of the respiratory chain and altered frequency and amplitude of calcium sparks. The muscle problems observed in statin-treated patients appear thus to be related to impairment of mitochondrial function and muscle calcium homeostasis, confirming the results we previously reported in vitro.",

At 12 months, pitavastatin significantly reduced urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio than pravastatin in subjects with macroalbuminuria (-67.2% vs. +14.5%, p = 0.0040), but not in subjects with microalbuminuria. There was no significant difference in the change in estimated glomerular filtration rate between the two groups.

The incidence of PLD in patients and its clinical relevance are difficult to assess without noninvasive biomarkers. Di-docosahexaenoyl bis(monoacylglycerol)phosphate (di-22:6-BMP) is a phospholipid that is enriched in lysosomal membranes and a proposed urinary biomarker of drug-induced PLD. The specificity of di-22:6-BMP for PLD was compared to other phospholipid species that can increase in urine with nephrotoxicity. Using liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, 12 phospholipids were assayed in the urine of rats treated with drugs that induced PLD or caused renal or skeletal muscle injury. In receiver operating curve analyses, urinary di-22:6-BMP was a significantly better predictor of PLD and the least predictive of tissue injury of the phospholipids assayed. The data provide evidence supporting the use of di-22:6-BMP as a urinary biomarker of PLD in rats.", 
    "209": "Statins are potent inhibitors of the endogenous mevalonate pathway. Besides inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis, statins may also demonstrate anti-inflammatory properties. Inflammation is implicated in the attachment and invasion of endometrial cells to the peritoneal surface and growth of ectopic endometrium by inducing proliferation and angiogenesis. In this study, the effect of statins on monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) expression in endometriotic implants in nude mouse model and in cultured endometriotic cells was evaluated. In mouse model, simvastatin decreased MCP-1 expression in a dose-dependent manner in endometriotic implants (P < .05). Similarly, both simvastatin and mevastatin revealed a dose-dependent inhibition of MCP-1 production in cultured endometriotic cells (P < .01). This inhibitory effect of the statins on MCP-1 production was reversed by the downstream substrates of the mevalonate pathway. Moreover, statins decreased MCP-1 messenger RNA expression in cultured endometriotic cells (P < .05). In conclusion, statins exert anti-inflammatory effect in endometriotic cells and could provide a potential treatment of endometriosis in the future.",

Relative performance varied by the event frequency and by user-defined preferences for sensitivity versus specificity. Type I error-based statistical testing procedures achieved higher event-based performance than other approaches in scenarios with few events, whereas statistical process control and disproportionality measures performed relatively better with frequent events. In the empirical data, we observed 6 cases of rhabdomyolysis among 4294 person-years of follow-up, with all events occurring among cerivastatin-treated patients. All selected algorithms generated alerts before the drug was withdrawn from the market.",

We employed a three-dimensional culture model in which nonmalignant breast epithelial cells form spheroids reminiscent of\u00a0acinar structures found in\u00a0vivo, whereas breast cancer cells display highly disorganized morphology. We found that mutant p53 depletion is sufficient to phenotypically revert breast cancer cells to\u00a0a more acinar-like morphology. Genome-wide expression analysis identified the mevalonate pathway as significantly upregulated by mutant p53. Statins and sterol biosynthesis intermediates reveal that this pathway is both necessary and sufficient for the phenotypic effects of mutant p53 on breast tissue architecture. Mutant p53 associates with sterol gene promoters at least partly via SREBP transcription factors. Finally, p53 mutation correlates with highly expressed sterol biosynthesis genes in human breast tumors. These findings implicate the mevalonate pathway as a therapeutic target for tumors bearing mutations in p53.",

    "221": "The capacity of HDL particles to mediate cellular free cholesterol efflux and selective hepatic uptake of cholesteryl esters was evaluated throughout postprandial phase (0-8 h) following consumption of a standardised mixed meal before and after treatment for 6 weeks with atorvastatin alone (10 mg/d) and subsequently with combination torcetrapib/atorvastatin (60/10 mg/d) in 16 patients displaying low HDL-C levels (<40 mg/dl).", 
    "222": "The larger HDL2b and HDL2a subfraction displayed a superior capacity to mediate cellular free cholesterol efflux via both SR-BI and ABCG1-dependent pathways than smaller HDL3 subspecies. CETP inhibition specifically enhanced the capacity of HDL2b subfraction for both SR-BI and ABCG1 dependent efflux. However, only the SR-BI-dependent efflux to HDL2b subspecies can be further enhanced during postprandial lipemia following CETP inhibition. Concomitantly, postprandial lipemia was associated with a reduced capacity of total HDL particles to deliver cholesteryl esters to hepatic cells in a drug independent manner.", 
    "223": "CETP inhibition specifically improves postprandial SR-BI and ABCG1-dependent efflux to larger HDL2b subspecies. In addition, CETP inhibition improves HDL-CE delivery to hepatic cells and maintains an efficient direct return of cholesteryl esters to the liver during postprandial lipemia.", 
    "224": "This study compared actual use of individual statin drugs to expected use based on their efficacy and safety profiles.", 
    "225": "Five panels covering the years 1999 to 2008 from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey provided interview, demographic, and laboratory data for 8769 (365,503,838 weighted) people aged 20 years or older who were not taking a statin medication. An individual's risk for coronary heart disease and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol goal were determined, following the Adult Treatment Panel III Cholesterol Guidelines. The percentage LDL cholesterol lowering required to reach his/her LDL cholesterol level goal was calculated. Depending on the amount of LDL cholesterol lowering needed and on if the individual had a liver condition (i.e., enhanced risk of rhabdomyolysis) statins were hypothetically prescribed. Predicted use was compared to actual use by U.S. Medicaid beneficiaries in the third quarter of 2009, obtained from the Medicaid State Drug Utilization Data maintained by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.", 
    "226": "Results showed that 72.34% of the population was in the lowest coronary heart disease risk group and that 86.30% required no statin therapy. Among the people who did require LDL cholesterol lowering, a significant majority (37.3 million or 10.22% of the population) needed 30% lowering or less. Only 314,784 (0.09%) required LDL cholesterol lowering of greater than 60%. Utilization shares based on safety and efficacy were estimated at 19.26% (rosuvastatin), 18.67% (atorvastatin), 16.48% (simvastatin), 16.30% (lovastatin), 14.93% (pravastatin), and 14.36% (fluvastatin).", 
    "227": "Actual statin use differed substantially from predicted use. It may be appropriate to develop and maintain policies that encourage use of less costly products that have essentially equivalent safety profiles and efficacy.", 
    "228": "Atherogenic risk in subjects with metabolic syndrome is partly mediated by increased oxidative stress and subsequent endothelial dysfunction. Clinical trials have demonstrated differences in outcomes between subjects receiving lipophilic statins (atorvastatin) compared with hydrophilic statins (pravastatin). However, whether these findings are attributable to differences in the doses administered or to nonlipid-lowering pleiotropic effects of statins on oxidative stress and vascular function remains unknown. We hypothesized that equipotent doses of these two statins will have divergent effects on markers of oxidative stress and endothelial function.", 
    "229": "Thirty-six subjects with hyperlipidemia and metabolic syndrome and/or diabetes were randomized in a double-blind manner to either pravastatin 80 mg or atorvastatin 10 mg daily. Oxidative stress (dROMs assay that measures lipid hydroperoxides, plasma thiobarbituric acid reactive substances [TBARS], and aminothiol levels) and brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) were measured at baseline and after 12 weeks of statin therapy.", 
    "230": "Statin therapy reduced serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels equally in both groups. Atorvastatin therapy was associated with a significant reduction in TBARS (P\u00a0= .006) and dROMs levels (P\u00a0= .02), which was not observed in subjects treated with pravastatin. Endothelial function improved with statin therapy (P\u00a0= .02), but there was no difference between the statin groups.", 
    "231": "In hyperlipidemic subjects with metabolic syndrome, atorvastatin is associated with a greater reduction in lipid markers of oxidation compared with pravastatin. Whether these effects are responsible for the outcome differences in trials comparing these agents needs further investigation."
