No significant change in the trough calcineurin inhibitor levels or allograft function occurred, and no serious adverse effects were observed. Fourteen patients (18.2%) discontinued treatment; eight patients (11.7%) developed muscle pain or weakness without an increase in creatinine kinase levels, and two patients (2.6%) developed elevated liver transaminase levels.

The mean AF-free period was significantly prolonged in the statin-amiodarone group (513+/-38 days vs. 374+/-25 days, log rank test P<0.02). Cox univariate analysis showed that treatment with statins and the duration of AF before EC were significant predictors for AF recurrence. After adjustment for other potential confounders, statin therapy proved to be a statistically significant predictor of sinus rhythm maintenance (adjusted OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.93, P=0.02).",

    "13": "An available, simple, sensitive, and rapid method has been developed for determination of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase inhibitor, lovastatin in human plasma. The analytical procedure involves a one-step liquid-liquid extraction method using atorvastatin as internal standard. Chromatographic separation was carried out on a reversed phase C(18) column using a mixture of 0.05 M phosphate buffer (pH 7) and acetonitrile (44.5 : 55.5, v/v) as mobile phase with UV detection set at 238 nm. The total run time of analysis was 6 min with the retention time of lovastatin being 4.3 min. A complete set of analytical method validation tests were carried out on the method. Accordingly, the method was linear in the wide range of 1-100 ng/ml. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) for lovastatin were 0.5 and 1 ng/ml, respectively. The method was shown to be precise with average within-run and between-run variations of 10.45+/-6.88 and 8.68+/-5.13%, respectively. The average within-run and between-run accuracy of the method throughout its linear range was 113.33+/-3.98 and 105.72+/-5.07%, respectively. The mean relative recovery of lovastatin from human plasma by the developed method was 88.61+/-7.00%. The applicability of the method in real pharmacokinetic situations was evaluated successfully during a bioequivalence study in 14 fasting healthy male volunteers.", 
    "14": "Adhesion molecules are known to play major roles in the initiation and stabilization of cell-to-cell contacts during the immunological response. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) exploits those interactions to facilitate infection and propagation processes. The primary objective of the present study was to investigate the ability of antagonists specific for lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) to diminish HIV-1 infection and transmission. We demonstrate here that LFA-1 antagonists can significantly reduce HIV-1 replication in primary human cells and virus propagation by affecting cell-to-cell interactions. Moreover, the inhibition of LFA-1-mediated adhesion events also potentiates the antiviral efficacy of the peptide fusion inhibitor T-20. Altogether, our data suggest that LFA-1 antagonists represent promising antiviral agents. Antiadhesion therapy could be considered a complementary strategy targeting cellular functions essential for HIV-1 spreading and against which the combined therapy currently used displays a limited efficacy.", 
    "15": "Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) reduce cardiovascular events in hypertensive subjects, but their effect on carotid BP, pressure augmentation, and wave reflection is unknown. We compared the effect of atorvastatin with placebo in a substudy of the lipid-lowering arm of the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT-LLA). Hypertensive patients (n=142; age=43 to 79 years; 127 male) with total cholesterol < or = 6.5 mmol/L were randomized to atorvastatin 10 mg or placebo. Carotid BP and flow velocity were measured by tonometry and Doppler ultrasound. Augmentation index (carotid AI(x)) was calculated, and waveforms were separated into backward and forward components by wave intensity analysis. Brachial BP was similar in atorvastatin and placebo groups. Carotid AI(x) and augmentation pressure were significantly less in patients randomized to atorvastatin (mean [SD]: 21.7 [12.1] versus 25.9 [10.3] %; P=0.027 and 10.2 [6.5] versus 13.1 [6.6] mm Hg; P=0.016, respectively), and atorvastatin treatment was associated with significantly less wave reflection from the body. Carotid systolic BP was slightly lower in the atorvastatin group, but there was a statistically significant interaction between lipid-lowering and antihypertensive regimen with lower carotid systolic BP in patients randomized to amlodipine-based therapy and atorvastatin. Carotid wave velocity, timings of waves, and wave intensities did not differ significantly between atorvastatin and placebo groups. Atorvastatin treatment is associated with less augmentation of the carotid BP waveform and less wave reflection from the body. This could contribute to the reduction in risk of cardiovascular events by statins.",

The excess risk was mostly driven by patients with moderate and severe COPD. There was a trend towards a lower risk of cancer mortality among patients with COPD who used statins compared with patients with COPD who did not use statins (HR 0.57; 95% CI 0.32 to 1.01). Interestingly, the risk of extrapulmonary cancer mortality was lower among statin users with COPD (HR 0.49; 95% CI 0.24 to 0.99).",

    "20": "The Wnt-LPR5 signalling pathway plays an important role in skeletal homeostasis, especially in regulating osteoblastic activity. Activation of this pathway is regulated by various inhibitors, including DKK1. The objective of this study was to evaluate DKK1 levels in patients with ischemic heart disease, the response to atorvastatin and the relationship with bone mass. Twenty-one patients with acute myocardial infarction and twenty-three controls with a mean age of 61 \u00b1 9 years with acute coronary syndrome were included. Patients were allocated to low (10-20mg) and high doses (40-80 mg) of atorvastatin according to baseline levels of cholesterol and triglycerides and the index of vascular risk. Patients were studied at hospital admission (baseline) and at 12 months of follow up. DKK1 was determined in all patients at baseline and at 12 months of follow up. Densitometric studies were conducted in the lumbar spine (L2-L4) and the femoral neck and trochanter using an X-ray densitometer. Patients had higher levels of DKK1 than controls, (111 \u00b1 41 nmol/l versus 84 \u00b1 27 nmol/l, p=0.014). Osteoporotic patients had higher levels of DKK1 (137.5 \u00b1 33 nmol/l versus 95.4 \u00b1 36 nmol/l, p=0.021). Analysis of the response to atorvastatin showed reduced DKK1 levels. In conclusion, in patients with acute coronary syndrome, atorvastatin decreases DKK1 levels. This may be a previously unreported mechanism of action of atorvastatin on bone, stimulating the Wnt signalling pathway and increasing bone mass.",

Drugs for the treatment of PAH mainly address the increased vascular tone. Substances like prostacyclin, endothelin-receptor-antagonists and phosphodiesterase-5-inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of PAH and represent the current therapeutic options. The development of a causal treatment aiming a normalization of the vessel wall structure is the current focus of research. The key events in disease progression are represented by increased proliferation, migration and a resistance to apoptosis of pulmonary vascular cells. Therefore, new non-vasoactive drugs are investigated in relevant preclinical animal models of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Some of these substances, like tyrosine kinase inhibitors, elastase inhibitors and phosphodiesterase-1-inhibitors, could not only attenuate (anti-remodeling) but reverse (reverse-remodeling) the disease. Additionally, new vasodilators, like soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators and activators, addressing well-known and new signaling pathways are currently under investigation. Taken together, with increasing insight into the pathology of PAH, several novel drug targets and treatments have emerged which may improve the management of patients and which efficacy is currently addressed in preclinical studies and clinical trials.",

Our study objectives were: (1) to analyze the effect of atorvastatin (10 mg/d) on lipid profile, renal function, proteinuria, and inflammation parameters, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), and (2) to use proteomics to ascertain whether this treatment modified the patients' urinary peptide profiles seeking to understand the molecular actions of the drug. Urinary peptide profiles, lipids, renal function parameters (creatinine clearance), proteinuria, and CRP were determined in 39 patients at baseline and at 12 weeks after atorvastatin treatment (10 mg/d). The peptide fraction of each sample acquired using magnetic beads was analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). Our results showed that treatment with atorvastatin produced a significant reduction in lipid profile, but did not modify renal function (creatinine clearance), proteinuria, or CRP. The proteomic study showed that statin treatment did not produce significant changes in the urinary peptidome, although there was a tendency for some peptides to increase or decrease after the treatment.",

In preclinical studies, statins inhibit multiple cancer-associated pathways in both hormone receptor (HR)-negative and HR-positive cell lines. Epidemiologic studies of statins and breast cancer show inconsistent results, with some suggesting a reduction in HR-negative breast cancer incidence in lipophilic statin users. However, large meta-analyses show no association between statin use and overall risk of breast cancer, although most did not evaluate tumor HR status. Multiple phase 1 and 2 prevention studies of statins for breast cancer risk reduction are ongoing.

Echocardiogram revealed partial calcification of the aortic and mitral valves, but no stenosis of the coronary arteries was detected on 3D-computed tomography. The activity of LDL receptors was reduced to 32% by lymphocyte assay. The family history showed vertical transmission of hypercholesterolemia from father to son, thereby suggesting dominant inheritance.

Two groups of patients were compared: those who received statins within 3 months before the admission (S) and those who did not (NS). The primary outcome was one-year all-cause mortality. To adjust for a potential misbalance between S and NS groups in baseline characteristics, a propensity score for statin therapy was incorporated into the survival model.",

In this study, we examine how income disparities in cholesterol levels have changed with the emergence of statins, an expensive and potent new drug technology. Using nationally representative data from 1976 to 2004, we find that income gradients for cholesterol were initially positive, but then reversed and became negative in the era of statin use. While the advantaged were previously more likely to have high levels of cholesterol, they are now less likely. We consider our case study against a broader theoretical framework outlining the relationship between technology innovation and health disparities. We find that the influence of technologies on socioeconomic disparities is subject to two important modifiers: (1) the nature of the technological change and (2) the extent of its diffusion and adoption.",

Identification of delirium was based on evaluation of the level of consciousness with the NEECHAM Confusion Scale and/or a chart-based instrument for delirium. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent perioperative predictors of postoperative delirium. Beta-blockers were tested for a potential effect.",

We recruited adult volunteers who participated through an interactive Web site. Participants rated the relative importance of outcomes using visual analogue scales (VAS).

We calculated a relative importance score (RIS) by subtracting the VAS scores for the downsides of taking statins from the VAS score for CHD. We used logistic regression to determine the association between participants' RIS and their choice. 2,978 participants completed the study. Relative risk reduction resulted in a 21% higher probability of choosing to take statins over all values of RIS compared to the absolute summary statistics. This corresponds to a number needed to treat (NNT) of 5; i.e., for every five participants shown the relative risk reduction one additional participant chose to take statins, compared to the other summary statistics. There were no significant differences among the absolute summary statistics in the association between RIS and participants' decisions whether to take statins. Natural frequencies were best understood (86% reported they understood them well or very well), and participants were most satisfied with this information.",

We reasoned that statins might similarly interfere with the biosynthesis of ergosterol, the major sterol of the yeast cell membrane. As assessed by spectrophotometric and microscopic analysis, significant inhibition of biofilm production was noted after 16-h incubation with 1, 2.5, and 5 muM simvastatin, concentrations that did not affect growth, adhesion, or hyphal formation by C. albicans in vitro. Higher concentrations (10, 20, and 25 muM simvastatin) inhibited biofilm by >90% but also impaired growth. Addition of exogenous ergosterol (90 muM) overcame the effects of 1 and 2.5 muM simvastatin, suggesting that at least one mechanism of inhibition is interference with ergosterol biosynthesis. Clinical isolates from blood, skin, and mucosal surfaces produced biofilms; biofilms from bloodstream isolates were similarly inhibited by simvastatin. In the absence of fungicidal activity, simvastatin's interruption of a critical step in an essential metabolic pathway, highly conserved from yeast to man, has unexpected effects on biofilm production by a eukaryotic pathogen.",

Thyromimetic compounds selective for the liver or for the thyroid hormone receptor isoform beta1 constitute a novel approach for the treatment of dyslipidemia. In preclinical studies, selective thyromimetics significantly reduced plasma cholesterol levels and provided protection from atherosclerosis by upregulating the hepatic LDL receptor and promoting reverse cholesterol transport. Importantly, data from ongoing clinical trials have provided the first evidence that selective thyromimetics may also reduce the levels of plasma cholesterol in humans.", 
    "76": "Recently, anti-inflammatory and tissue protective effects of statins have been shown independent from its anti-hyperlipidemic effect. It has been shown that one of the statins, rosuvastatin, may reduce ischemia/reperfusion (I/R)-induced tissue injury in the brain, intestines, and heart. We planned an experimental study to evaluate the effect of rosuvastatin on I/R injury encountered after the detorsion of the testicular torsion. Rats were divided into three groups. In group 1, testis basal blood flow (basal value) was measured with LASER Doppler flowmeter (LDF). Testis was relocated into the scrotum without torsion. Two and 3 h after the basal measurement, testis was brought out from the same incision, and the second (second value) and third (third value) testicular blood flow measurements were done, respectively. In group 2, after the measurement of basal value testicular torsion was created. Second and third value measurements were obtained with LDF at the end of the 2 h of testicular torsion just before the detorsion and 1 h after detorsion. In group 3, same procedures in torsion/detorsion group were repeated in this group, but 10 mg/kg rosuvastatin was injected intraperitoneally 30 min before detorsion. Second values in groups 2 and 3 were significantly lower than group 1. Third values were significantly low in group 2 compared to groups 1 and 3. Regarding the third measurement, there was no significant difference between the groups 1 and 3. Tissue injury is closely related with condition of microvascular perfusion after I/R. Rosuvastatin can protect tissue perfusion in the experimental testicular torsion model.",

Co-application of physiologic lipid mixture (PLM) containing an equimolar ratio of ceramides, cholesterol and free fatty acids normalized barrier homeostasis in the face of topical TCIs. In hairless mice, 4 days of TCI treatment also disrupted barrier function significantly. TCIs-treated epidermis showed the decrease of epidermal lipid content, lamellar body number and secretion, and lipid synthesis-related enzymes such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase, serine-palmitoyl transferase and fatty acid synthase, implying decreased lipid synthesis. TCIs also suppressed expression of IL-1alpha and antimicrobial peptides, CRAMP and mouse beta-defensin 3. However, these TCI-induced abnormalities can be overridden by topical replacement with PLM.", 
    "84": "Our results demonstrate that TCIs induce negative effects on the skin barrier including permeability and antimicrobial functions, which are mediated by decreasing epidermal lipid synthesis, lamellar body secretion and antimicrobial peptides expression through suppression of cytokine such as IL-1alpha, therefore co-treatment with PLM would be helpful to overcome these negative effects.", 
    "85": "Patients with any degree of aortic-valve disease have increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The active inflammatory component of calcific aortic valve disease has been recognized, and similarities with atherosclerotic disease have been identified. Both calcific aortic valve disease and atherosclerosis are characterized by lipid infiltration, inflammation, neoangiogenesis, calcification, and endothelial dysfunction. From these observations, the hypothesis has emerged that statins, which reduce the progression of atherosclerotic disease and significantly improve the clinical outcome in patients with coronary artery disease, might also be beneficial in patients with aortic stenosis. Since aortic stenosis, like atherosclerosis, is an active disease process, it seems plausible that statins might slow its hemodynamic progression. In addition, the use of statins might also lead to a reduction in cardiovascular end points in the group of patients at high risk for vascular complications. Evidence that lipid lowering therapy slowed the progression of aortic stenosis relative to non statin therapy was suggested by several retrospective studies but some prospective studies, such as SALTIRE trial, found that intensive lipid lowering therapy did not halt the progression of calcific aortic stenosis. So, we can not recommend statin therapy for patients with calcific aortic stenosis in the absence of coexisting coronary disease.", 
    "86": "Atherosclerosis is defined as a chronic, progressive, proliferative and inflammatory process developed as a response of blood vessel endothelium to the numerous noxious factors. The definition, which is only an approximate one, shows that one of the terms to carry definition is progression. In other words, it is a well-known fact today that atherosclerosis is a progressive process. The question about the possibilities of its stagnation and regression arises. The appearance of statins and their introduction into the therapy and the process of prevention give a positive answer to the previous question. The results of many studies have also shown that statins can be used to decrease and even stop the process of atherosclerosis. Using the modern diagnostic procedures, primarily the intravascular and Doppler ultrasound, andfocusing on regression, these studies fillowed the process of atherosclerosis in patients with statin therapy. The conclusions of these studies have indicated a clear degree of regression of atherosclerosis which is not a spectacular one, but implies the significant clinical improvement.",

    "103": "Bisphosphonates are potent inhibitors of osteoclast function widely used to treat excessive bone resorption associated, e.g., with bone metastases. They have also antitumor activity. However, it is unclear whether this reflects an indirect effect via inhibition of bone resorption or a direct antitumor effect. Nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (N-BPs), including zoledronic acid (ZOL), act by inhibiting farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase (FPPS). The mevalonate pathway is blocked and the accumulation of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) consequently occurs. IPP is conjugated to AMP to form a novel ATP analog (ApppI). The present study was undertaken to clarify whether IPP and/or ApppI has a direct involvement in apoptosis caused by ZOL in different cancer cell lines. There are marked differences in ZOL-induced ApppI formation between different cancer cell lines. On this basis, we selected three cancer cell lines that differ significantly from each other in their ZOL-induced IPP and ApppI accumulation: human estrogen-dependent (MCF7) and estrogen-independent (MDA-MB 436) breast cancer cell lines and a human myeloma cell line (RPMI 8226). The amount of IPP/ApppI correlated with the capacity of cells to undergo apoptosis. Geranylgeraniol (GGOH), an intermediate of mevalonate metabolism, blocks both IPP and ApppI formation and to some degree ZOL-induced apoptosis in a cell line-dependent manner. In addition, lovastatin (LOV), an inhibitor of the enzyme HMGCoA reductase, completely blocks IPP/ApppI formation as determined by mass spectrometry analysis, but enhances apoptosis. In conclusion, the current data suggest that ZOL-induced IPP/ApppI formation can contribute to ZOL-induced apoptosis. This mechanism and the inhibition of protein prenylation, both outcomes of FPPS inhibition in mevalonate pathway, seem to act in concert in ZOL-induced apoptosis in cancer cells.",

In the overall study population, the use of statins was associated with a significant reduction in systolic (-7.6+/-4 mmHg, p<0.05) and diastolic blood pressures (-5.2+/-3 mmHg, p<0.05) in comparison to baseline. The blood pressure decrease was more pronounced in patients younger than 65 years (p<0.05), with higher baseline systolic blood pressure (p<0.005), and in those with higher cholesterolemia before statins (p<0.05).", 
    "110": "Our study suggests a BP-lowering effect of statins, consistent with some other literature. Some parameters like age, baseline systolic blood pressure and cholesterolemia influence the antihypertensive effect of statins. The lack of consideration for these confounding factors may be one of the reasons for the conflicting results about the BP lowering effects of statins.",

Fibrates tended to be associated with a greater reduction in low-density lipoprotein (range: -76.3 mg/dL to +38.7 mg/dL) than placebo, although these results were not consistent across all trials. Fibrates were more efficacious than placebo at preventing nonfatal myocardial infarction (odds ratio=0.78; 95% confidence interval, 0.69-0.89), but not all-cause mortality (odds ratio=1.05; 95% confidence interval, 0.95-1.15).",

New-onset atrial fibrillation was reported in a total of 7855 patients. Postoperative incidence rates for any or new-onset atrial fibrillation were 24.6% and 29.9%, respectively. Preoperative statin use resulted in a 22% and 34% unadjusted odds reduction for any atrial fibrillation (odds ratio, 0.78; 95% confidence interval, 0.67-0.90) or new-onset atrial fibrillation (odds ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.51-0.84) after surgery (P < .001). Relevant publication bias and an unequal distribution of confounding variables favoring patients treated with statins were identified. Nevertheless, the beneficial actions of statins on atrial fibrillation persisted after pooled analysis of risk-adjusted treatment effects from randomized controlled trials and observational trials (any atrial fibrillation-odds ratio, 0.64; 95% confidence interval, 0.48-0.87; new-onset atrial fibrillation-odds ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence intervals, 0.48-0.89; P < .01).",

The oral administration of MFSE (200 and 400 mg kg(-1) body weight) significantly lowered the serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels (p < 0.01) and raised high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels (p < 0.05) in hyperlipidemic rats. The MFSE group had a significantly lower 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity and higher atherogenic index (calculated as HDL-C/LDL-C) when compared with the UFSE group (400 mg kg(-1) body weight) (p < 0.05). Treatment with both MFSE200 and MFSE400 groups for 40 days significantly reduced the activities of serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase by averages of 35.6 and 43.2%, respectively, as compared to the high-fat diet group (p < 0.01). The results indicate that MFSE performs a more potent hypolipidemic action via improvement of the lipid profiles and down-regulated HMG-CoA reductase activity than UFSE in hyperlipidemic rats.",

A recent study showed that aggressive statin treatment caused reductions of 50% in LDL cholesterol, 37% in CRP, 44% in CVD events, and 20% in total mortality, and that the highest treatment benefits were obtained in those with the lowest achieved levels of both LDL cholesterol and CRP. However, a reduction in CRP levels after statin treatment could be secondary to the reduced LDL cholesterol levels, and thereby less inflammation in atherosclerotic plaques. We recently performed 4 large Mendelian randomization studies, studies that demonstrated that elevated CRP associate with increased risk of CVD, that genetic variation in the CRP gene associate with increased CRP levels, but that this genetic variation in the CRP gene do not associate with increased risk of CVD. In contrast to previous studies, these new studies had enough statistical power to effectively exclude that genetically elevated CRP cause CVD.", 
    "122": "These data suggest that elevated CRP per se does not cause CVD; however, inflammation per se possibly contributes to CVD. Elevated CRP levels more likely is a marker for the extent of atherosclerosis or for the inflammatory activity and vulnerability of atherosclerotic plaques, and thus simply an innocent bystander in CVD.",

On statins, reductions in ratios of serum precursor sterols and increases of absorption sterols were 1.8-2.9 times higher among good than poor responders (p<0.05 for each). In the whole study group, changes from baseline values of lathosterol/cholestanol were related to those of cholesterol and LDL-C in serum (r=+0.513 and +0.451, p=0.021 and 0.046, respectively). Serum lathosterol ratios to cholesterol, cholestanol and sitosterol consistently reflected a ratio of cholesterol synthesis (mg/d/kg)/fractional cholesterol absorption (%) (r-range +0.456 to +0.727, p<0.05 for each).", 
    "125": "Low serum baseline ratios to cholesterol of lathosterol, cholestenol and desmosterol, but a high ratio of cholestanol predicted a poor response to statins. Good responders were characterized by more profound reductions of serum and fecal (lathosterol) precursor sterols and increases of serum absorption marker sterol ratios on statins. Serum surrogate sterol markers of cholesterol metabolism were applicable in evaluating cholesterol absorption and synthesis also on statins.",

    "171": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the number one cause of death in both adult men and women. It is evident that active inflammation in the coronary arteries remains a key factor in plaque instability and subsequent cardiovascular events. The current clinical dilemma is that inflammation can occur even in patients who are on statin therapy, as well as in patients with \"normal\" cholesterol levels. Because fully half of all patients with cardiovascular events have normal cholesterol levels, there is a need to re-evaluate the role of inflammatory factors and biomarkers to better identify patients at risk. Current risk factors include C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and platelet activator inhibitor-1. Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) is another emerging risk factor. The weight of evidence suggests that this biomarker also promotes vascular inflammation. Patients with higher levels of Lp-PLA2 have higher rates of CVD and stroke. Measurement of Lp-PLA2 can improve the identification of people at increased risk for CVD, independent of cholesterol, or C-reactive protein level. Lp-PLA2 has been an innovative target of immunomodulation therapy, and clinical studies with specific inhibitors are in progress evaluating this approach for both atherosclerosis development and clinical event reduction.",

The aim of this article is to review the current literature and propose the optimal treatment regimen in patients with all three disease states. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) should be universally administered. High-dose statin therapy to reach a target low-density lipoprotein (LDL) of 70-100 mg/dL is advocated, although patients with a history of cerebral bleeding must be carefully monitored for possible recurrence. Beta-blockers are appropriate after a recent coronary event, and amlodipine or thiazide diuretics should be used after a recent stroke (within 6 months). Patients with a history of stroke (with or without coexisting CAD and CKD) should receive aspirin (75-150 mg/day) indefinitely. Clopidogrel or aspirin plus extended-release dipyridamole (ER-DP) may be prescribed in patients allergic or resistant to aspirin. If stroke is attributable to cardiogenic embolism, anticoagulation is indicated. In patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) (excluding ST-elevated myocardial infarct) who undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), aspirin plus clopidogrel is indicated for secondary prevention for up to 12 months. There are no data supporting the use of aspirin plus clopidogrel in patients with CKD who develop ACS. Aspirin plus clopidogrel is contraindicated for stroke prevention.",

It has been linked to each of the known atherogenic risk factors, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, cigarette smoking, menopause, etc. A number of recent studies have shown that the severity of endothelial dysfunction correlates with the development of coronary artery disease and predicts future cardiovascular events. Therefore, these findings strengthen the hypothesis that endothelial dysfunction may be an early stage of coronary atherosclerosis. This phenomenon primarily reflects an imbalance between the vasodilating (nitric oxide) and vasoconstrictor agents (endothelin-1). Several invasive (intracoronary or intrabrachial infusions of vasoacting agents) and non-invasive techniques (assessment of flow mediated vasodilatation in the brachial artery by ultrasound) have been developed during the last few years to evaluate endothelial function in the coronary and peripheral circulation. This new methodology has allowed assessing the severity of the abnormalities in vascular function and their regression by several pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. It is likely that restoration of endothelial function can regress the atherosclerotic disease process and prevent future cardiovascular events. Most pharmacological interventions attempting to improve endothelial dysfunction targeted the risk factors linked to endothelial dysfunction: hypertension (ACE-inhibitors, calcium antagonists), dyslipidaemia (lipid-lowering agents) and menopause (estrogens). Nevertheless, several pharmacological agents have been suggested to achieve vascular protection through different mechanisms beyond their primary therapeutic actions: ACE-inhibitors, statins, third generation of beta-blockers (nebivolol), endothelium-derived nitric oxide synthesis (tetrahydrobiopterin, BH4) and antioxidants agents. In this review we will focus on the current pharmacological management of the endothelial dysfunction.", 
    "178": "Diabetes is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in the Western world and it currently affects 35 million people in the US alone. Cardiovascular and renal complications of diabetes, Type I and II, account for much of this morbidity, and are now known to be the end result of a complex interplay of pathophysiological processes. These include haemodynamic and metabolic abnormalities such as endothelial dysfunction, inflammation, vasoconstriction, oxidation and fibrosis. For some time it has been difficult to elucidate whether these processes and subsequent dysfunction in organs such as the heart and kidney is due to processes that often coexist with diabetes, such as hypertension. However, it is now clear that there is a distinct pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic state in diabetes, which may in addition be complicated by synergistic disease processes. The use of statins in diabetes has been of interest for a while due to the known effect of statins on inflammatory and fibrotic pathways. This review covers the clinical evidence for the use of statins in diabetes, the major known pathophysiological processes that occur in diabetic organ disease and discusses the known and putative effects of statins on these pathways. It concludes with a brief discussion of some early and yet unpublished work regarding the addition of statin therapy to angiotensin inhibition therapy in diabetic disease.",

Patients in the 3 groups were treated with routine antihypertensive drugs. In addition, pravastatin and Xuezhikang were given to the patients in the PRA group and XZK group, respectively.

    "183": "Hypercholesterolemia is a common accompaniment of atherosclerosis and may be associated with cardiac hypertrophy. To define the mechanistic basis of cardiac hypertrophy in hypercholesterolemia, we fed low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout (LDLR KO) mice regular diet or high cholesterol (HC) diet for 26 weeks. There was clear evidence of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and collagen deposition in the hearts of LDLR KO mice fed with HC diet, confirmed by histopathology (hematoxylin and eosin and Picrosirius staining) and upregulation of genes for brain natriuretic peptide, alpha-tubulin, transforming growth factor beta1, and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). These changes were independent of change in blood pressure. The hypercholesterolemic mice hearts showed an upregulation of LOX-1, an oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor, and angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) at messenger RNA level. In addition, there was a marked upregulation of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) messenger RNA, indicating overexpression of markers of oxidant stress. A separate group of LDLR KO mice were fed HC diet along with a potent 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarylcoenzyme A reductase inhibitor rosuvastatin or a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker amlodipine. Administration of rosuvastatin or amlodipine reduced the overexpression of genes for LOX-1 and AT1R and associated NADPH oxidase and NF-kappaB. These phenomena were associated with a marked decrease in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and collagen deposits in and around the cardiomyocytes. In conclusion, this study provides evidence of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in hypercholesterolemia independent of blood pressure change LOX-1 and AT1R act as possible signals for oxidant stress leading to alterations in cardiac structure during hypercholesterolemia. Most importantly, rosuvastatin and amlodipine ameliorate cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and fibrosis.", 
    "184": "We hypothesized that atorvastatin (ATOR) treatment would reduce arterial stiffness in overweight and obese middle-aged and older adults. Twenty-six (11 men and 15 women) overweight or obese (body mass index: 31.6+/-0.7 kg/m(2)) middle-aged and older adults (age: 54+/-2 years) were randomly assigned to receive either ATOR (80 mg/d) or placebo for 12 weeks. Arterial stiffness (beta-stiffness and pulse wave velocity) was measured before and after the intervention. At baseline, the ATOR (n=16) and placebo (n=10) groups did not differ with respect to age, body mass index, blood pressure, serum lipid and lipoprotein concentrations, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, indices of arterial stiffness, or compliance (all P>0.05). After the 12-week treatment period, the ATOR group experienced a 47% reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (149+/-6 to 80+/-8 mg/dL) and a 42% reduction in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (3.6+/-0.8 to 2.1+/-0.5 mg/L; both P<0.05). In addition, beta-stiffness (9.4+/-0.6 to 7.6+/-0.5 U) and aortic pulse wave velocity (1096+/-36 to 932+/-32 cm/s), but not brachial pulse wave velocity, decreased (both P<0.05) with ATOR. In contrast, there were no significant changes in beta-stiffness (9.1+/-0.8 to 9.1+/-0.7 U) or aortic pulse wave velocity (1238+/-89 to 1191+/-90 cm/s; both P>0.05) in the placebo group. There were no relations between the reductions in arterial stiffness indices and any of the baseline cardiometabolic risk factors (all P>0.05). However, the reductions in arterial stiffness were correlated with the reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol but not high-sensitivity C-reactive protein or any other cardiometabolic variables (all P<0.05). Taken together, these findings suggest that ATOR reduces arterial stiffness in overweight and obese middle-aged and older adults, and these favorable changes occur irrespective of baseline cardiometabolic risk factors.", 
    "185": "PCSK9 is a natural inhibitor of LDL receptor (LDLR) that binds the extracellular domain of LDLR and triggers its intracellular degradation. PCSK9 and LDLR are coordinately regulated at the transcriptional level by sterols through their promoter-imbedded sterol response elements (SRE) and co-induced by statins. Identification of regulatory networks modulating PCSK9 transcription is important for developing selective repressors of PCSK9 to improve statin efficacy by prolonging the up-regulation of LDLR. Interestingly, the plant-derived hypocholesterolemic compound berberine (BBR) up-regulates LDLR expression while down-regulating PCSK9. In our investigations to define mechanisms underlying the transcriptional suppression of PCSK9 by BBR in HepG2 cells, we have identified a highly conserved hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (HNF1) binding site residing 28 bp upstream from SRE as a critical sequence motif for PCSK9 transcription and its regulation by BBR. Mutation of the HNF1 site reduced PCSK9 promoter activity >90%. A battery of functional assays identified HNF1alpha as the predominant trans-activator for PCSK9 gene working through this sequence motif. We further provide evidence suggesting that HNF1 site works cooperatively with SRE as HNF1 mutation significantly attenuated the activity of nuclear SREBP2 to transactivate PCSK9 promoter. Finally, we show that a coordinate modest reduction of HNF1alpha and nuclear SREBP2 by BBR led to a strong suppression of PCSK9 transcription through these two critical regulatory sequences. This is the first described example of SREBP pairing with HNF1 to control an important regulatory pathway in cholesterol homeostasis. This work also provides a mechanism for how BBR suppresses PCSK9 transcription.", 
    "186": "Despite the advances in interventional techniques, the management of stable atherosclerosis remains the domain of optimal guideline-oriented therapy. Recent studies on the effects of aggressive lipid lowering on atheroma volume changes using intravascular ultrasound indicate that it is possible to achieve atherosclerosis regression by reaching low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels less than 75 mg/dl. The pleiotropic anti-inflammatory effects of statins contribute to the reduction of cardiovascular (CV) event observed with aggressive lipid lowering. As a second important strategy to prevent disease progression, lifestyle changes with regular physical exercise are capable of halting the atherosclerotic process and reducing angina symptoms and CV events. Optimal medical therapy, a healthy lifestyle with regular physical exercise, and coronary interventions are not mutually exclusive treatment strategies. Over the last few decades, both have proved to be effective in significantly reducing the CV mortality in the Western world. However, risk factor modification contributed to at least half the effect in the reduction of CV mortality. This figure provides an estimate of what could be achieved if we were to take risk factor modification more seriously - especially in the acute care setting. The knowledge is there: today we have a better understanding on how to stop progression and even induce regression of atherosclerosis. Much research still needs to be done and will be done. In the meantime, however, our primary focus should lie in implementing what is already known. In addition, it is essential not just to treat CV risk factors, but also to treat them to achieve the target values as set by the guidelines of European Society of Cardiology.", 
    "187": "OBJECTIVES: Drugs used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have the potential to affect cardiovascular risk factors. There is concern that corticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and COX-2 inhibitors could affect cardiovascular risk adversely, while drugs such as the antimalarial, hydroxychloroquine, may have beneficial effects. However, there is limited information about cardiovascular risk factors in patients with RA receiving different drugs. METHODS: We measured cardiovascular risk factors including systolic and diastolic blood pressure, serum HDL and LDL cholesterol, glucose and homocysteine concentrations and urinary F(2)-isoprostane excretion in 169 patients with RA. Risk factors were compared according to current use of corticosteroids, methotrexate, antimalarials, NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors, leflunomide and TNF-alpha blockers. Comparisons were adjusted for age, sex, race, disease activity (DAS28 score), current hypertension, diabetes, smoking status and statin use. RESULTS: No cardiovascular risk factor differed significantly among current users and non-users of NSAIDs, COX-2 inhibitors, methotrexate and TNF-alpha blockers. Serum HDL cholesterol concentrations were significantly higher in patients currently receiving corticosteroids (42.2 +/- 10.5 vs. 50.2 +/- 15.3 mg/dL, adjusted P < 0.001). Diastolic blood pressure (75.9 +/- 11.2 vs. 72.0 +/- 9.1 mm Hg, adjusted P = 0.02), serum LDL cholesterol (115.6 +/- 34.7 vs. 103.7 +/- 27.8 mg/dL, adjusted P = 0.03) and triglyceride concentrations (157.7 +/- 202.6 vs. 105.5 +/- 50.5 mg/dL, adjusted P = 0.03) were significantly lower in patients taking antimalarial drugs. Plasma glucose was significantly lower in current lefunomide users (93.0 +/- 19.2 vs. 83.6 +/- 13.4 mg/dL, adjusted P = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: In a cross-sectional setting drugs used to treat RA did not have major adverse effects on cardiovascular risk factors and use of antimalarials was associated with beneficial lipid profiles.", 
    "188": "Pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment do not appear singly and usually occur as complex mixtures, whose combined effect may exhibit toxicity to the aquatic biota. We report an environmental application of the combination index (CI)-isobologram equation, a method widely used in pharmacology to study drug interactions, to determine the nature of toxicological interactions of three fibrates toward two aquatic bioluminescent organisms, Vibrio fischeri and the self-luminescent cyanobacterial recombinant strain Anabaena CPB4337. The combination index-isobologram equation method allows computerized quantitation of synergism, additive effect and antagonism. In the Vibrio test, the fibrate combinations showed antagonism at low effect levels that turned into an additive effect or synergism at higher effect levels; by contrast, in the Anabaena test, the fibrate combinations showed a strong synergism at the lowest effect levels and a very strong antagonism at high effect levels. We also evaluated the nature of the interactions of the three fibrates with a real wastewater sample in the cyanobacterial test. We propose that the combination index-isobologram equation method can serve as a useful tool in ecotoxicological assessment.",

The present study was designed to determine the role for small G protein RhoA in the hepatocytotoxicity of statins.", 
    "190": "Statin-induced hepatocytotoxicity in HepG2 cells were assessed by WST-8 cell viability assay, JC-1 mitochondrial membrane potential assay and caspase-3/7 activity assay. Cytosolic RhoA was detected by Western blotting and RhoA activation was measured by ELISA.",

Supplementation of mevalonate or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) but not farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) reversed these cellular events and cell death induced by atorvastatin. Atorvastatin induced a translocation of RhoA protein into the cytosol and inhibited the activity of the protein. In addition, atorvastatin reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, which was mimicked by GGTase inhibitor GGTI-2147 or the specific RhoA inhibitor such as toxin B and C3 exoenzyme. However, only a few cells revealed mitochondrial membrane depolarization and a loss of viability after exposure to the Rho-kinase inhibitors such as Y-27632 and hydroxy fasudil.",

    "193": "The present study was designed to determine whether atorvastatin reduced hypertension-induced cardiac remodeling and whether these effects involved Protein Kinase D (PKD) and Myocyte Enhancer Factor 2D (MEF2D), factors known to be implicated in cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. 16-Week-old spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and age-matched Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were included. Blood pressure and serum lipid concentration were measured. H-E staining, myocardial transverse diameter, and echocardiography were examined to evaluate cardiac hypertrophy. Hydroxyproline content assay and Masson's trichrome staining were used to estimate cardiac fibrosis. Atorvastatin (10, 25 and 50mg/kg/day) was administered for 8 weeks. Increased blood pressure and cardiac remodeling were prominent in SHRs compared with WKY rats. SHRs also had elevated PKD and MEF2D activation. The systolic blood pressure, myocardial transverse diameter and hydroxyproline content were positively correlated with the activation level of PKD and MEF2D in SHRs. Atorvastatin significantly attenuated the activation of PKD and MEF2D. It may be concluded that atorvastatin reverses hypertension-induced cardiac remodeling partially through down-regulation of PKD/MEF2D activation. Our results predict novel therapeutic targets for atorvastatin in treating hypertensive patients.", 
    "194": "Classes of lipid lowering drugs differ strongly with respect to the types of lipids or lipoproteins they predominantly affect. Statins inhibit the de-novo synthesis of cholesterol. Consequently, the liver produces less VLDL, and the serum concentration primarily of LDL cholesterol (but, to a lesser extent, also of triglycerides) is lowered. Further, statins somewhat increase HDL cholesterol. There is abundant evidence that statins lower the rate of cardiovascular events. Cardiovascular risk reduction is the better, the lower the LDL cholesterol values achieved with statin therapy are. Some evidence is available that anion exchange resins which also decrease LDL cholesterol decrease vascular risk, too. This is not the case for the ezetimibe, which strongly lowers LDL cholesterol: its potential to decrease vascular risk remains to be proven. In contrast evidence for cardiovascular risk reduction through the mainly triglyceride lowering fibrates as well as for niacin is available. Niacin is the most potent HDL increasing drug currently available and besides increasing HDL cholesterol efficaciously lowers triglycerides and LDL cholesterol. Large ongoing trials address the decisive question whether treatment with fibrates and niacin provides additional cardiovascular risk reduction when given in addition to statin treatment.", 
    "195": "This systematic review analyses the efficacy, tolerability and safety of combinations of different medicines used to treat dyslipidemias in clinical practice. A PubMed search up to January 2009, was conducted to identify relevant studies. Criteria used to identify studies included (1) English language, (2) published studies with original data or meta-analyses in peer-reviewed journals. Although statin treatment is a mainstay of dyslipidemia management today, complementary effects of other lipid-lowering and/or HDL-cholesterol-raising therapies might substantially increase the clinical benefits not only in the small minority of patients with severe dyslipidemias but in others as well. These therapies include combinations with bile acid sequestrants (cholestyramine, colestipol, colesevelam), ezetimibe, niacin, plant sterols, fibrates (fenofibrate, bezafibrate, gemfibrozil), and prescription omega-3 fatty acids. Therapeutic approaches which incorporate the use of multiple drugs combinations for dyslipidemia treatment should be more widely adopted since combination therapy might offer a means to increase the number of patients able to meet their lipoprotein goals according to the guidelines. However, it has to be stated that for most of these combination therapies data on cardiovascular outcomes are still lacking.", 
    "196": "The changes of the composition of blood lipoproteins caused by menopause could also change the effect of hypolipidemic therapy. Using an experimental model we studied the changes of serum lipids and the effect of immediate or delayed treatment with simvastatin on atherosclerosis after surgical menopause. Female golden Syrian hamster aged 6 months were fed hypercholesterolemic diet during the whole study. Atherosclerotic changes in thoracic and abdominal aortas were assessed by stereomicroscopic method after 12 weeks. Four experimental groups were studied: sham-operated animals (n = 5), ovariectomized animals (n = 9), ovariectomized animals treated for 12 weeks (n = 10), and ovariectomized animals treated 4 weeks after ovariectomy for 8 weeks (n = 9). The dose of simvastatin was 10 mg/kg of body weight. After 12 weeks, ovariectomized animals had tenfold higher concentration of triglycerides in LDL fraction and significantly higher prevalence of atherosclerosis than animals without ovariectomy. Treatment with simvastatin substantially decreased the prevalence of atherosclerotic changes, but otherwise did not change individual serum lipids including LDL cholesterol. However, it improved proportions of pro- and antiatherogenic serum lipids mainly by the increase of HDL cholesterol. The timing of simvastatin treatment had no significant effect on atherosclerotic changes or lipid parameters. Simvastatin treatment partly prevented atherosclerotic changes induced by ovariectomy. This effect was not mediated by decrease of LDL cholesterol, but by increase in HDL cholesterol.", 
    "197": "It has been reported that early use of statins in STEMI and NSTEMI as in acute coronary syndrome protects patients from recurrent ischemic events. Thus, it may reduce both short-term and long-term adverse outcomes such as subsequent cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction and revascularization, as well as stroke. It seems that this protective effect takes place as early as four months of treatment initiation, as reported in the MIRACL trial. The potential benefit slowly increases over time for up to 24 months of treatment initiation. Pleiotropic effects of statins, i.e. mechanisms such as improvement of endothelial dysfunction, antithrombotic and fibrinolytic as well as anti-inflammatory effects are possible explanations for this early effect. Therefore, the initiation of treatment with statins during hospitalization as part of acute phase therapy is advised. Relatively few patients need to be treated in such a way to prevent one death, so this approach is also cost-effective."
