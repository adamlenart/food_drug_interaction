    "0": "Hypercholesterolemia is a major risk factor for coronary artery disease. Oxysterols are known to inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis and have been explored as potential antihypercholesterolemic agents. The ability of 3beta-hydroxy-5alpha-cholest-8(14)-en-15-one (15-ketosterol) to lower non-HDL cholesterol has been demonstrated in rodent and primate models, but the mechanisms of action remain poorly understood. Here we show in a coactivator recruitment assay and cotransfection assays that the 15-ketosterol is a partial agonist for liver X receptor-alpha and -beta (LXRalpha and LXRbeta). The binding affinity for the LXRs was comparable to those of native oxysterols. In a macrophage cell line of human origin, the 15-ketosterol elevated ATP binding cassette transporter ABCA1 mRNA in a concentration-dependent fashion with a potency similar to those of other oxysterols. We further found that in human embryonic kidney HEK 293 cells, the 15-ketosterol suppressed sterol-responsive element binding protein processing activity and thus inhibited mRNA expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, LDL receptor, and PCSK9. Our data thus provide a molecular basis for the hypocholesterolemic activity of the 15-ketosterol and further suggest its potential antiatherosclerotic benefit as an LXR agonist.", 
    "1": "MDR1/ABCB1, MRP2/ABCC2, and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP)/ABCG2 are expressed in the liver and intestine and contribute to the disposition of many drugs. Rosuvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor for the treatment of patients with dyslipidemia, is primarily excreted via bile as unchanged drug. The present study was designed to determine whether rosuvastatin is transported by MDR1, MRP2, and BCRP. The apparent permeability value for rosuvastatin across MDR1-Madin-Darby canine kidney cells was low ( approximately 8 nm/s), and no directional transport was observed. Rosuvastatin uptake into control Sf9 membranes and membranes expressing MRP2 was similar in the presence or absence of GSH. In contrast, ATP dramatically stimulated rosuvastatin uptake into membranes expressing BCRP, but not control membranes. Rosuvastatin transport occurred into an osmotically sensitive space and was saturable. An Eadie-Hofstee analysis suggested that there were two transport sites in BCRP, with an apparent K(m) of 10.8 muM for the high affinity site and 307 microM for the low affinity site. These data demonstrate that rosuvastatin is transported efficiently by BCRP and suggest that BCRP plays a significant role in the disposition of rosuvastatin.", 
    "2": "Relative plaque composition, more than its morphology alone, is thought to play a pivotal role in determining propensity to vulnerability. Thus, we investigated in vivo whether the distance from coronary ostium to plaque location independently affects plaque composition in humans. This may help explaining the recently reported non-uniform distribution of culprit lesions along the vessel in acute coronary syndromes.", 
    "3": "In 51 consecutive patients (45 men), aged 38-76 years (mean age: 58+/-10), a non-culprit vessel was investigated through spectral analysis of IVUS radiofrequency data (IVUS-Virtual Histology). The study vessel was the left anterior descending artery in 23 (45%) patients; the circumflex artery in nine (18%), and right coronary artery in 19 (37%). The overall length of the region of interest, subsequently divided into 10 mm segments, was 41.5+/-13 mm long (range: 30.2-78.4). No significant change was observed in terms of relative plaque composition along the vessel with respect to fibrous, fibrolipidic, and calcified tissue, whereas the percentage of lipid core resulted to be increased in the first (median: 8.75%; IQR: 5.7-18) vs. the third (median: 6.1%; IQR: 3.2-12) (P=0.036) and fourth (median: 4.5%; IQR: 2.4-7.9) (P=0.006) segment. At multivariable regression analysis, distance from the ostium resulted to be an independent predictor of relative lipid content [beta=-0.28 (95%CI: -0.15, -0.41)], together with older age, unstable presentation, no use of statin, and presence of diabetes mellitus.", 
    "4": "Plaque distance from the coronary ostium, as an independent determinant of relative lipid content, is potentially associated to plaque vulnerability in humans.", 
    "5": "The promotion of lipid efflux from macrophages is an important ATP binding cassette A1 (ABCA1)-mediated antiatherosclerotic mechanism that prevents peripheral tissues from foam cell accumulation. Statins exert beneficial antiatherosclerotic effects on cardiovascular disease correlated to the cholesterol-lowering properties and the pleiotropic activities. In this work, we investigated the ability of statins to modulate ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux from macrophages, where the protein expression was differently induced. Pitavastatin (0.1-10 microM) and compactin (10 microM) reduced both cholesterol and phospholipid efflux up to 60% from macrophages expressing ABCA1 upon treatment with 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-cyclic AMP (cpt-cAMP), and this was secondary to a reduction of ABCA1 mRNA and protein content. Conversely, statins did not affect ABCA1 activity when the protein was up-regulated by 22-hydroxycholesterol/9-cis-retinoic acid or through cholesterol loading. Statin inhibition of lipid efflux induced by cpt-cAMP was reversed in the presence of mevalonate, 22-hydroxycholesterol, and cholesterol but not geranyl geraniol. In macrophages obtained from liver X receptor (LXR)-deficient mice, cpt-cAMP still promoted cholesterol efflux, but pitavastatin did not exert any effect. The present work shows that statins may inhibit ABCA1-mediated lipid efflux in macrophages only when ABCA1 protein expression is induced by cpt-cAMP and provides evidence that cAMP may activate ABCA1 independently of an increase of intracellular sterol synthesis but through at least two pathways: one independent of LXR and one involving an intracellular sterol(s) acting as LXR ligand(s). In addition, the lack of inhibitory effect on lipid efflux in cholesterol-loaded macrophages is likely to exclude a potential negative pleiotropic effect by statins.", 
    "6": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) formation is a result of inflammation and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling mediated by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A inhibitors (statins), although clinically used as lipid-lowering agents, have also been demonstrated to have anti-inflammatory effects. This study was designed to determine whether the hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A inhibitor simvastatin suppresses aneurysm formation in an elastase-induced rat AAA model.", 
    "7": "Aneurysms were created in adult male Wistar rats by infusion of elastase into isolated infrarenal aortic segments. The rats were randomized to receive either simvastatin (n = 17) or placebo (n = 17) by gastric lavage daily starting the day before surgery. The rats were euthanized and the infrarenal aortas harvested on postoperative day 7. Aortic diameters were measured before infusion, immediately after infusion, and at the time of harvesting. Protein expression was measured by immunoblot analysis. Gene expression profiling using Affymetrix U34A rat genome chips was performed to identify changes in gene expression caused by simvastatin treatment.", 
    "8": "Mean aneurysm diameter was significantly less in the simvastatin treatment group compared with controls (3.4 +/- 0.08 mm vs 4.3 +/- 0.19 mm; P = .0001). MMP-9 and nuclear factor-kappaB protein levels were decreased in the aortas of simvastatin-treated animals. Gene microarray analysis revealed 315 genes with statistically significant changes in expression (P < .05) in the simvastatin group. Genes related to inflammation, ECM remodeling, and oxidative stress function were downregulated. These included genes for interleukin 1, interleukin 4, inducible nitric oxide synthase, P-selectin, platelet-derived growth factor alpha, tumor necrosis factor, and several chemokines.", 
    "9": "Simvastatin significantly suppresses experimental aneurysm expansion and reduces protein levels of MMP-9 and nuclear factor-kappaB. Gene array analysis provides evidence that several mediators of inflammation, matrix remodeling, and oxidative stress are downregulated by simvastatin treatment. This suggests that simvastatin inhibits AAA formation by blocking the expression of certain proinflammatory genes. Simvastatin may be useful as an adjuvant therapy to suppress the growth of small aneurysms.", 
    "10": "As a result of a hereditable point mutation in the oocyte very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) receptor, sexually mature restricted ovulator (RO) female chickens (Gallus gallus), first described as a non-laying strain, exhibit endogenous hyperlipidemia and develop atherosclerotic lesions. In a 20-day study, RO hens and their normolipidemic (NL) siblings were fed either a control diet, or the control diet supplemented with 0.06% atorvastatin (AT), a potent 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) inhibitor. Compared to NL hens, RO birds exhibited greatly elevated baseline plasma total cholesterol (CHOL) and triglyceride (TG) concentrations (1.56 vs. 4.55 g/l and 30.7 vs. 138.4 g/l, respectively). AT attenuated plasma CHOL and TG concentrations by 60.3% and 70.1%, respectively, in NL hens and by 45.1% and 34.3%, respectively, in RO hens. Messenger RNA levels of several key genes involved in hepatic VLDL assembly were suppressed in RO vs. NL hens, but were unaffected by AT. In contrast, AT elevated liver HMGR mRNA levels in NL and RO birds, but only NL hens exhibited an AT-associated increase in hepatic HMGR immunoreactive protein levels. Down-regulation of HMGR gene expression due to higher baseline levels of circulating CHOL may explain why RO birds responded less robustly than NL hens to AT administration.", 
    "11": "Inflammation has been recognized as having an important role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Statins reduce cardiovascular events mainly by cholesterol lowering. A large number of investigations have demonstrated that administration of statin could modify inflammatory response with a concurrent fall in cardiovascular events. Despite the known benefit of statin therapy, many cardiac patients abruptly discontinue therapy because of financial constraints, forgetfulness, or side effects. More recently, several studies have shown that abrupt cessation of statin therapy during treatment could increase the incidence of cardiac events in patients with atherosclerotic heart disease. However, the mechanisms of the increased incidence of cardiovascular events after abruptly stopping statin therapy are still unknown. A few data suggest that abrupt withdrawal of statin therapy deteriorates endothelial function, result in expression of pro-inflammatory gene involved in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. We hypothesis that rebound phenomenon of inflammatory response may be a major mechanism responsible for increased cardiovascular events after abrupt cessation of statin therapy. Our very recent data showed that abrupt termination of statin therapy resulted in a rapid increased C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia. This finding may be of important interest in the connection between inflammatory response and abrupt withdrawal of statin therapy in patients with coronary artery disease.",

    "14": "Fifteen patients with NICM on standard maximized heart failure medication were enrolled in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. Patients received 80 mg atorvastatin (ATV) or matching placebo for a 12-week treatment period with a minimum of an 8-week washout period. The following surrogate markers were evaluated: N-terminal-pro brain natriuretic peptide, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, oxidized LDL antibody, soluble receptor tumor necrosis factor, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, circulating levels of vascular adhesion molecule-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, P-selectin, non-invasive endothelial function studies, and heart rate variability.", 
    "15": "After ATV therapy, there was a significant decrease in LDL concentration from 110 +/- 27 mg/dl to 55 +/- 18 mg/dl (p < 0.05). There were no differences between ATV and placebo with regard to the surrogate markers measured.", 
    "16": "Based on these findings, it seems that the administration of high-dose statins to a heart failure population with modest LDL levels and no other indication for statin therapy was neither beneficial nor detrimental as determined by surrogate marker measures.

In addition, LVEDD was reduced from 57.1 +/- 5.9 mm to 53.4 +/- 5.1 mm (p = 0.007) and LVESD was reduced from 42.4 +/- 3.8 mm to 39.1 +/- 3.8 mm (p = 0.02) in the cohort of patients treated with atorvastatin; these dimensions increased in the placebo group. There was an increase in erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (E-SOD) activity, and there were significant reductions in serum levels of high sensitivity C-reactive protein, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor-alpha receptor II (TNF-alpha RII) in the atorvastatin group.", 
    "21": "The use of atorvastatin in patients with nonischemic HF improves LVEF and attenuates adverse LV remodeling.

The pharmacokinetics of pravastatin (100 mg/kg p.o.) were assessed with water, orange juice, and carbohydrates (12.5 ml/kg over 30 min) and with acetic acid (0.1 M, pH 3.44). The pharmacokinetics of simvastatin (100 mg/kg p.o.) were assessed with water and orange juice. In addition, the pharmacokinetics (based on plasma levels) of pravastatin 80 mg/kg i.v. were assessed with water and orange juice (5 ml/kg) in rats. The pharmacokinetics of oral pravastatin (10 mg) were assessed when administered with water and orange juice (800 ml over 3 h) in a two-way crossover study in 14 healthy volunteers. Orange juice significantly increased the area under the curve (0-150 min) of pravastatin in rats. Orange juice had no effects on the pharmacokinetic parameters of intravenously administered pravastatin in rats. Carbohydrates and acetic acid with pH and concentration equivalent to those of orange juice also resulted in no statistically significant differences in pravastatin pharmacokinetic parameters in rats. Orange juice did not result in any significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters of simvastatin in rats. Orange juice significantly increased oatp1 and oatp2 mRNA and protein in the intestine of rats. Orange juice significantly increased the area under the curve (0-240 min) of pravastatin in healthy volunteers. In conclusion, orange juice increases the bioavailability of pravastatin administered orally. Oatp1 and oatp2 may be related to increases of pharmacokinetics of pravastatin by orange juice.",

Further, the effects of chronic medications, including statins, as well as peri-operative glucose, insulin and potassium infusion, on gene expression were also assessed. Circulating resistin, CRP, adiponectin and leptin levels were determined to assess inflammation.", 
    "25": "The expression of adiponectin, resistin and other adipocytokine mRNAs were comparable to that in omental fat. Epicardial CD45 expression was significantly higher than control depots (p < 0.01) indicating significant infiltration of macrophages. Statin treated patients showed significantly lower epicardial expression of IL-6 mRNA, in comparison with the control abdominal depots (p < 0.001). The serum profile of CABG patients showed significantly higher levels of both CRP (control: 1.28 +/- 1.57 microg/mL vs CABG: 9.11 +/- 15.7 microg/mL; p < 0.001) and resistin (control: 10.53 +/- 0.81 ng/mL vs CABG: 16.8 +/- 1.69 ng/mL; p < 0.01) and significantly lower levels of adiponectin (control: 29.1 +/- 14.8 microg/mL vs CABG: 11.9 +/- 6.0 microg/mL; p < 0.05) when compared to BMI matched controls.",

    "27": "Dramatic progresses have occurred during the past 10 years in the field of cardiovascular secondary prevention. Many randomized trials have established the efficacy of statins, antiplatelet agents, beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors for reducing cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction and stroke in patients with coronary heart disease. Since 2002, American and European guidelines have emphasized the importance of optimal utilization of those four main therapeutic classes. Nevertheless, drugs prescription registries conducted in France since 1995 revealed a persistent gap between evidence based medicine and clinical practice, only a minority of patient received an optimal treatment. Some factors associated with lower rate prescription have been identified: elderly patients, female gender, missing of LDL-cholesterol measurement, history of peripheral artery disease or stroke, and finally the difficulty of observance. At this time, optimization of management of these patients require a systematic measurement of LDL-cholestererol level for all patients with CAD, PAD or history of stroke, a larger prescription of statins in female patients and in elderly particularly for secondary prevention. Increasing observance which is the main challenge could involved the utilization of fixed drugs associations.", 
    "28": "Although platelet antiaggregants, beta-blockers and statins have proved their efficacy as secondary prevention in all types of patients with arterial and thrombotic disease, these therapeutic categories remain under-used in the elderly. The reasons for this under-prescription are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to determine the reasons for not prescribing the principal secondary prevention therapies in elderly coronary patients.", 
    "29": "Two transversal pharmaco-epidemiological surveys were carried out in a representative sample of French cardiologists. They included 1489 coronary patients aged 35 to 69 years and 1148 patients aged over 70 years, respectively. Risk factors, medical history, current treatments and reasons for non-prescription of the principal therapies were collected.", 
    "30": "In subjects aged 70 years or over, antiaggregants were not prescribed in 24% of patients, versus 7.5% of younger patients. Statins were not prescribed in 37% of those over 70 years, versus 14% of younger patients. Beta-blockers were not prescribed in 42% of elderly patients versus 23% of younger patients. ACE inhibitors were not prescribed in 57.6% of elderly subjects and 48.2% of younger subjects. Combinations of three or four secondary prevention treatments were half as frequently prescribed in patients over the age of 70. According to the physicians, the main reason for non-prescription in elderly patients was a lack of indication, which concerned 8% of the entire sample with respect to antiaggregants, 9% for beta-blockers and 14% for statins. These very high percentages were not found in younger subjects (1%, 3% and 2.5%, respectively).", 
    "31": "Our results confirm under-use of the principal secondary prevention therapies in elderly subjects, mainly because of a lack of indication, according to the physicians. In these patients, indications for secondary prevention appear to be tributary to numerous factors, such as age, the type of medical history, the availability of lipid parameters or compliance. In response to questions by practitioners, specific recommendations would be useful concerning secondary prevention in elderly coronary patients.",

Patients treated with statins and antiplatelet agents were less likely to undergo subsequent vascular events (relative risk: 0.35; 95% CI 0.20-0.61) than patients not receiving statins or antiplatelet agents. All-cause mortality rate decreased dramatically (relative risk: 0.32; 95% CI 0.16-0.65) in patients treated with a combination of statins and antiplatelet agents when compared to patients treated with neither statins nor antiplatelet agents.",

    "36": "The pleiotropic effects of statins, inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, have been recently extended to the modulation of angiogenesis. Here, to get more insight into the statins action, the authors have investigated the effect of atorvastatin on the expression of several angiogenic and inflammatory genes in human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs). Atorvastatin was proangiogenic at the dose of 10 nM, and antiangiogenic at the concentrations of 1 to 10 micro M. Moreover, these higher concentrations inhibited also the proliferation of HUVECs induced by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Lower doses of atorvastatin did not influence endothelial cell proliferation. Importantly, atorvastatin at the micromolar concentrations diminished the production of interleukin (IL)-8, a proinflammatory and proangiogenic chemokine, and inhibited the synthesis of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), a potent proinflammatory mediator. However, it decreased also the expression of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1), the inhibitors of angiogenesis. Atorvastatin stimulated the expression of angiopoietin (Ang)-2 and moderately enhanced the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), whereas heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) was not significantly affected. In conclusion, the present findings points to other angiogenesis-related effects of atorvastatin, which may be of relevance to the beneficial influence of statins in cardiovascular system.", 
    "37": "It is widely recommended that beta-blockade be used peri-operatively as it may reduce the incidence of postoperative cardiovascular complications including death. However, there are few data concerning the cost-effectiveness of such strategies. We have analysed the pharmacoeconomics of acute beta-blockade using data from eight prospective peri-operative studies in which patients underwent elective non-cardiac surgery, and in which the incidence of adverse side-effects of treatment, as well as clinical outcomes, have been reported. The costs of treatment were based on the NHS reference costs for 2004. From these data, the number-needed-to-treat (NNT) to prevent a major cardiovascular complication (including cardiovascular death) in high-risk patients was 18.5. This is comparable to the NNT for peri-operative statin therapy. The incremental cost of peri-operative beta-blockade (costs of drug acquisition and of treating associated adverse drug events) was 67.80 pounds sterling per patient. This results in a total cost of 1254.30 pounds sterling per peri-operative cardiovascular complication prevented. However, there is evidence that in patients at lower cardiovascular risk, beta-blockers may be potentially harmful, since their adverse effects (hypotension, bradycardia) may outweigh their potential cardioprotective effects.", 
    "38": "Many studies have reported that carotid parameters measured by ultrasonography were predictors for stroke.

    "42": "Vascular calcification, such as coronary and aortic calcification, is a significant feature of vascular pathology. Two distinct forms of vascular calcification are well recognized. One is medial calcification, which occurs between the cell layers of smooth muscle cells, and is related to aging, diabetes and chronic renal failure. The other is atherosclerotic calcification, which occurs in the intima during the development of atheromatous disease. It has been shown that statins inhibit the progression of calcification in the aortic valve and the coronary artery. We have found that statins inhibit calcification of human aortic smooth muscle cells, which is induced by incubating the cells in high-phosphate medium. We also found that this is mediated by inhibiting cellular apoptosis, an essential mechanism for calcification, not by inhibiting inorganic phosphate (Pi) uptake by sodium-dependent phosphate cotransporter (NPC). Besides apoptosis and Pi uptake, such proteins as osteoprotegerin (OPG), matrix Gla protein (MGP), Klotho, fetuin-A, and apoE have been shown to negatively affect vascular calcification. Many previous reports suggest that vascular calcification appears to be regulated by promoting factors, such as Pi, apoptosis, modified LDL, advanced glycation end products, oxidative stress, vitaminD3, glucocorticoid, cbfa-1, osteopontin, and inhibitory factors, such as OPG, MGP, Klotho, fetuin-A, PTH/PTHrP, pyrophosphate, statins, and bisphosphonates. The precise mechanism of vascular calcification is of interest.", 
    "43": "Diabetes mellitus and cognitive decline are major public health concerns among the elderly. In diabetic subjects without dementia, certain cognitive domains are impaired, such as memory, attention, and executive/frontal lobe function (diabetic cognitive dysfunction). Recent epidemiological studies have suggested that diabetes increases the risks for vascular dementia as well as Alzheimer's disease. There are accumulating evidences that indicate biological linkage between impaired brain glucose metabolism homeostasis and cognitive decline. Diabetes may cause serious brain damages through several mechanisms and induce a variety of cognitive decline. Most critical issue to be resolved is to identify the mechanism of dementia leading from diabetic cognitive dysfunction. Once elderly diabetics had severe cognitive decline, effective treatment of diabetes were hardly obtained. Thus, diabetic cognitive decline should be considered as an important comorbidity of the elderly diabetes and long-term management of hyperglycemia is required from a view point to sustain healthy brain function. In this short review, we are summarizing the clinical features and current biological findings of diabetic cognitive decline. Also, we introduce the comprehensive treatment of demented diabetic elderly, including therapeutic strategy, nursing and care.", 
    "44": "Endothelial cell dysfunction (ECD) is a common feature of chronic renal failure (CRF). Defective nitric oxide (NO) generation due to decreased endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) activity is a crucial parameter characterizing ECD. L-arginine is the sole precursor for NO biosynthesis. Among several transporters that mediate L-arginine uptake, cationic amino-acid transporter-1 (CAT-1) acts as the specific arginine transporter for eNOS. Our hypothesis implies that CAT-1 is a major determinant of eNOS activity in CRF. We studied glomerular and aortic arginine uptake, CAT-1, and CAT-2 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression, and CAT-1 protein in: (a) rats 6 weeks following 5/6 nephrectomy (CRF), (b) sham-operated animals, and (c) rats with CRF treated orally with either atorvastatin or arginine in drinking water (modalities which have been shown to enhance eNOS activity and improve endothelial function). Both glomerular and aortic arginine transport were significantly decreased in CRF. Treatment with either arginine or atorvastatin abolished the decrease in arginine uptake in CRF rats. Using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Northern blotting, we found a significant increase in glomerular and aortic CAT-1 mRNA expression in CRF. Western blotting revealed that CAT-1 protein was decreased in CRF, but remained intact following arginine and atorvastatin administration. Renal and systemic arginine uptake is attenuated in CRF, through modulation of CAT-1 protein. These findings provide a possible novel mechanism to eNOS inactivation and endothelial dysfunction in uremia.",

    "46": "In addition to cholesterol lowering, 3-hydroxy-3-nethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors limit inflammatory changes associated with atherosclerosis. There is also support for their use as inhibitors of progression in chronic renal disease, irrespective of cause. In this study, their capacity to limit acute renal inflammation was evaluated. For this purpose, mice were treated with Simvastatin either prior to, at the time of, or shortly after induction of nephrotoxic nephritis. The severity of disease was determined by evaluation of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), proteinuria, and renal histologic changes. The reversibility of benefit was evaluated by the administration of mevalonic acid along with nephrotoxic serum (NTS) and Simvastatin The severity of the acute nephritis, including proteinuria, elevated BUN, and histologic changes, was ameliorated in a dose-dependent manner, when Simvastatin was administered either prior to NTS injection or at the time of NTS injection. By contrast, Simvastatin did not alter the course of established nephritis. Coadministration of mevalonic acid, the immediate substrate following HMG-CoA reductase, abolished Simvastatin's renoprotective effect, indicating that the benefit is, at least in part, due to interference with HMG-CoA reductase and biosynthetic substrates downstream from the enzyme.

    "48": "While elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol is the primary target of hypercholesterolemia treatment, high triglycerides and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol are also important targets for therapy. Correcting these lipid abnormalities should be an integral part of therapy in hypertensive individuals. Medications such as the fibrates are effective and well tolerated for reducing triglycerides and increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and their use has resulted in a reduction in cardiovascular events. Fibrates are also recommended as adjunct therapy for patients receiving statins whose low-density lipoprotein cholesterol or non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol is not reduced to goal levels. The combination of a statin and a fibrate may, however, raise the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Gemfibrozil, one of the fibrates, but not fenofibrate, interferes with statin glucuronidation, which may increase the risk of myopathy due to elevations in statin serum levels. This may at least partially explain the lower incidence of myopathy with fenofibrate compared with gemfibrozil when combined with statins. Combination therapy with a fibrate and a statin is a potentially useful therapy for patients with atherogenic lipid profiles, for which fenofibrate appears to be a more appropriate choice due to less myopathic potential.", 
    "49": "The preventive hypolipemic effect of water extract of Picrorrhiza rhizoma (PR) was observed in Poloxamer (PX)-407 induced hyperlipemic mice with their hepatoprotective effects. Doses of 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg of PR extracts were given orally once a day for 12 weeks initiated with intraperitoneal injection of PX-407 (0.5 g/kg), and changes in body weight and gains, liver weight, serum aspartate transferase (AST) and alanine transferase (ALT) levels were monitored with serum low density lipoprotein (LDL), high density lipoprotein (HDL), triglyceride and total cholesterol levels. The efficacy of PX-407 was compared to that of 10mg/kg of simvastatin (SIMVA). No meaningful changes in the body weight were detected in all dosing groups compared to that of vehicle control group. Dramatic decrease of both absolute and relative liver weight was dose-dependently observed in all PR extracts dosing groups compared to that of vehicle control group. The serum AST and ALT levels were significantly and dose-dependently decreased in PR extracts dosing groups. However, slight increase of liver weight, serum AST and ALT levels were detected in SIMVA-dosing groups. The serum LDL, triglyceride and total cholesterol levels were dose-dependently decreased in PR extracts dosing groups and SIMVA-dosing group compared to that of vehicle control group, respectively. The serum HDL levels were slightly but dose-dependently increased in PR extracts dosing groups compared to that in vehicle control group, respectively. However, the efficacy on the serum lipid levels of PR extracts was lower than that of SIMVA-about 200 mg/kg of PR extracts which showed similar effect compared to that of SIMVA 10mg/kg. On the basis of these results, it is concluded that water extract of PR has a relatively good favorable preventive effect on the PX-407 inducing hyperlipemia with favorable hepatoprotective effect.",

Indeed, the use of statins, which inhibit cholesterol and isoprenoid biosynthesis, as potential AD therapeutics is under investigation. Whether statins offer benefit for AD will be determined by the outcome of large, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials. However, their use as pharmacological tools has delineated novel roles for isoprenoids in AD. Protein isoprenylation regulates multiple cellular and molecular events and here we review the complex roles of isoprenoids in AD-relevant processes and carefully evaluate isoprenoid pathways as potential AD therapeutic targets.", 
    "51": "Almost a hundred years ago, the main neuropathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain were discovered, yet the underlying cause(s) are still unknown, and the disease is basically untreatable. Despite the very numerous studies on the neuropathological features, the cause(s) of their production and whether they have an aetiological role in the disease or are merely end-products (\"tombstones\") are still unknown. Indeed, until fairly recently, the only known risk factors were age, Down's syndrome and head injury. A susceptibility factor, the type 4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene was identified, but it is neither essential nor sufficient to cause AD, so other factors must be involved also. We investigated the possibility of a viral role and discovered that HSV1 DNA is present in brain of a high proportion of elderly people and that in combination with APOE-epsilon4 it confers a high risk of AD. Subsequently, we found that APOE determines outcome of infection in several diseases caused by diverse infectious agents. Here we describe our studies, and the few others carried out elsewhere, on the mechanism of action of HSV1 and the dependence of the damage on APOE. We discuss, in relation to HSV1 action on lipids and to the spread of the virus via lipid rafts in brain, the possible involvement in AD of cholesterol, a vital and major component of the human brain, and the dispute over whether statins, drugs used for lowering cholesterol levels, are protective against the disease. We also link the damage due to two major consequences of HSV1 infection--inflammatory and oxidative processes--to lipid peroxidation in brain, and consider the influence of the different apoE isoforms in this process.", 
    "52": "AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a key energy sensor, known to regulate energy metabolism in diverse cell types. Hypoxia is encountered frequently in the microenvironments of inflammatory lesions and is a critical regulator of function in inflammatory cells. Energy deficiency is one of the consequences of hypoxia, but its potential role in modulating leucocyte function has received little attention. Using micropore chemotaxis assays to assess migratory responses of the monocyte-like cell line U937, it was found that the AMPK activators AICAR and phenformin rapidly reduced random migration (chemokinesis) as well as chemotaxis due to stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)1alpha. There was an approximate 50% reduction in both chemokinesis and chemotaxis following 30 min preincubation with both AICAR and phenformin (P < 0.01), and this continued with up to 24 h preincubation. The binding of SDF1alpha to its receptor CXCR4 was unaltered, suggesting AMPK was acting on downstream intracellular signalling pathways important in cell migration. As AMPK and statins are known to inhibit HMG CoA reductase, and both reduce cell migration, the effect of mevastatin on U937 cells was compared with AMPK activators. Mevastatin inhibited cell migration but required 24 h preincubation. As expected, the inhibitory effect of mevastatin was associated with altered subcellular localization of the Rho GTPases, RhoA and cdc42, indicating decreased prenylation of these molecules. Although the effect of AMPK activation was partially reversed by mevalonate, this was not associated with altered subcellular localization of Rho GTPases. The data suggest that activation of AMPK has a general effect on cell movement in U937 cells, and this is not due to inhibition of HMG CoA reductase. These are the first data to show an effect of AMPK on cell movement, and suggest a fundamental role for energy deficiency in regulating cellular behaviour.",

The effects of two of the glitazone (thiazolidinedione) class of drugs, namely rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, on blood pressure and vascular remodelling in the New Zealand genetically hypertensive (GH) rat model were investigated. 2. In the first study, a GH group given rosiglitazone (5 mg/kg per day) from the age of 7 to 12 weeks was compared with a GH control group. In the second study, GH rats were given either pioglitazone, simvastatin, valsartan or combinations of pioglitazone with simvastatin or valsartan (all drugs at a dose of 10 mg/kg per day). 3. Tail-cuff systolic blood pressure was measured weekly. At the end of the experiment, blood vessels were fixed by perfusion and samples of mesenteric resistance arteries (MRA), second-order branches and basilar artery were embedded in Technovit and serial sections were cut and stained with Giemsa for stereological analysis. Media width, medial cross-sectional area and lumen diameter were determined and the ratio of media width/lumen diameter was calculated. 4. Rosiglitazone significantly reduced blood pressure in GH rats. 5. In MRA, rosiglitazone had a hypotrophic effect on media, reduced lumen diameter and reduced media/lumen ratio (P<0.001). 6. In basilar artery, there was also a hypotrophic effect of rosiglitazone on media and reduced media/lumen ratio (P<0.001). 7. Pioglitazone slowed down the rate of blood pressure increase with age in GH rats and had a greater effect on blood pressure when given in combination with simvastatin. 8. Pioglitazone had a hypotrophic effect on the media of MRA and basilar artery. The hypotrophic effect was enhanced when pioglitazone was given in combination with simvastatin. The media/lumen ratio was reduced by pioglitazone; in MRA, combination treatment with simvastatin reduced the ratio further to normal and, with valsartan, to below normal. In basilar artery, the media/lumen ratio was reduced further by both combination treatments, but was lowest in the pioglitazone-valsartan combination group. 9. The significant effects on MRA and basilar artery structure (and, thus, haemodynamics) seen after rosiglitazone monotherapy and after pioglitazone, given alone and in combination with simvastatin or valsartan, may well indicate a glitazone class effect on vascular structure and, hence, cardiovascular function.",

    "79": "Expression of both pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators are influenced by various factors such as rheumatic diseases, myocardial infarction, angina, aging, obesity and pharmacotherapy. This has therapeutic consequences. Clearance of highly bound and efficiently metabolized drugs may be reduced in the presence of inflammation amounting to increased circulating drug concentration. In the meantime, various cardiovascular receptors are down-regulated in the presence of pro-inflammatory mediators. Consequently, conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, aging and obesity results in reduced response to drugs such as verapamil despite increased drug concentration. The inflammatory response is a complex cascade of non-specific events resulting in excessive generation of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, C-reactive protein and nitric oxide by cells of the innate (macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils) and adaptive (T-lymphocytes) arms of the immune system. T-lymphocytes secrete various pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines during an inflammatory event. In general, two distinct subpopulations of these T-helper cells exist, anti-inflammatory Th2 and pro-inflammatory Th1. As a common rule, Th1 cytokines suppress Th2 and vice-versa. Hence, a balance of these activities is desired. Drugs such as antirheumatoid agents, angiotensin II blockers and hydroxymethyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) may help to restore the Th1/Th2 balance. In general, at least for some conditions, the challenge of therapeutic drug monitoring will be more useful if expression of inflammatory mediators is also taken into account. In addition, some of the intersubject variation in pharmacotherapy and clinical trails may be attributed to variations in the inflammatory mediator's concentration. A detail list of conditions and drugs that influence expression of the inflammatory mediators are provided and potential therapeutic consequences are discussed.", 
    "80": "The use of lipid-lowering drugs in diabetes is aimed primarily at reducing the large cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk burden experienced by this group of patients. Statin therapy has been shown to be highly efficacious in reducing CVD risk, both in those with and without prior CVD. Therefore, statins are the first-line lipid-lowering therapy in patients with diabetes. Patients with diabetes and established CVD should have low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) lowered to at least 2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) and, if possible, to 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL). Those without prior CVD should have LDLC lowered to 2.6 mmol/L. Triglycerides should be kept less than 1.7 mmol/L (150 mg/dL) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) above 1.15 mmol/L (40 mg/dL) in men and 1.2 mmol/L (46 mg/dL) in women. Additional therapy with fibrates or nicotinic acid may be needed to achieve these goals; the choice is determined by tolerance and side-effect profile. The use of nicotinic acid or fibrates on their own to achieve triglyceride or HDLC levels should be limited to those patients already at or near LDLC goals. Caution is warranted with combination therapy because muscle side effects, in particular, can increase. In type 1 diabetes, CVD risk is high but trial data are sparse. Where there is nephropathy, and where glycemic control is poor, there will often be a need for triglyceride and HDLC raising interventions as above. In the absence of these, lipid profile is often normal and focus should be on reducing CVD risk by statin therapy. If uncertainty about CVD risk status exists, consideration should be given to using CVD imaging modalities to inform intervention choice in younger patients.",

    "92": "Lipid alterations can be observed early among patients with AIDS disease. Commonly, these lipid abnormalities include low HDL-C and modest increase in triglyceride plasma levels. Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART) in these patients may aggravate the dyslipidemia, with notable increases in triglycerides as well as in LDL-C. There are several mechanisms proposed to explain the mixed hyperlipidemia observed in these subjects, including different steps in lipid metabolism. The importance of the treatment of dyslipidemia became evident with the increased life expectancy and reports of cardiovascular complications in these individuals. There is an insulin resistance state in patients with AIDS disease under treatment with HAART, who present with lipodystrophy, hypertriglyceridemia, low levels of HDL-C. Antiretroviral drugs are metabolized by CYP P450 3A4 and interactions with some statins, especially with simvastatin are expected to occur. Treatment with lipid-lowering agents should be based on lipid profile and coronary risk. For hypertriglyceridemias, fibrates (mainly fenofibrate or bezafibrate) should be the drugs of choice, as well as statins (mainly pravastatin). Combined treatment using fibrates plus statins are recommended for severe mixed hyperlipidemias under very close monitoring for adverse effects.", 
    "93": "There are limited data regarding the use of hypolipidemic agents concomitantly with immunosuppressive drugs. Best evidence is provided for the use of statins and cyclosporine. In terms of pharmacodynamics, these two drugs have different substrates. In respect to pharmacokinetics, statins usually do not modify serum concentrations of cyclosporine, however when combined with any statin a careful monitoring of cyclosporine levels is recommended, due to a narrow therapeutic window of the immunosuppressive agent. Conversely, cyclosporine does affect the area under the curve for many statins, by inhibiting the CYP450 3A4, thus increasing systemic exposure to statins. Pravastatin appears to be the safest compound, once it is glucuronized. The area under the curve for the other statins (simvastatin, lovastatin, atorvastatin, cerivastatin, and rosuvastatin) can be increased in variable degrees according to the site of metabolization, liver extraction by OATP-C transporter, biliary secretion, renal excretion, and drug extrusion by the MDR system.",

However, myopathy, defined as muscle symptoms associated with CK elevation is much more common (1-5%). Mechanism of statin-induced myopathy is not fully understood. Several hypotheses have been proposed: decreased cellular levels of isoprenoids and ubiquinone, increased rates of apoptosis, changes in chloride channels impairing cell-membrane hyperpolarization, and changes in the cell-membrane permeability. Interactions with other drugs, and preexisting metabolic alterations may predispose to myopathy.", 
    "96": "Combination of statins with niacin appears to be an attractive association, in the presence of mixed dyslipidemia with low HDL-c levels, when monotherapy is insufficient to achieve target lipid levels. Clinical benefits were observed by the combination of statins with niacin in the FATS, HATS and ARBITER 2 trials, showing attenuation of atherosclerosis development and/or reduction in coronary events following favorable lipid changes. In general, this combination can be well-tolerated. Recommendations for appropriate monitoring of liver and muscle enzymes are important to reduce the rate of side effects. In addition, careful titration of each drug is recommended.", 
    "97": "Monotherapy for the treatment of dyslipidemias is commonly insufficient to achieve all lipid targets recommended by current guidelines. Therefore, the use of combined treatment has emerged as a new option in many cases in the last few years. A review of 36 studies in which the combination of statins with fibrates was used revealed 29 cases of rhabdomyolysis with a prevalence of 0.12% in the risk of myopathy. Combination of a statin with genfibrozil appeared to cause more rhabdomyolysis than with newest fibrates (especially when compared with fenofibrate or bezafibrate). Advanced age, diabetes, females, concomitant medications, renal insufficiency, excess in alcohol intake, exercises, trauma and surgery were all associated with higher rates of adverse effects.", 
    "98": "Hypothyroidism is common in the elderly, especially among women. It should be suspected in the presence of classic signals and symptoms, and can be detected by an elevation of serum thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). Lipid abnormalities in the presence of subclinical hypothyroidism are of minor importance. However, the importance of specific treatment (hormone replacement) increases with the magnitude of thyroid disturbance. Some hypolipidemic agents can aggravate prior liver disease, however, recent studies have shown that statins might be useful in the presence of steatohepatitis. Some associations of hypolipidemic drugs can increase liver enzymes, and careful monitoring is recommended.", 
    "99": "Liver disease following the use of hypolipidemic drugs has been reported as a cellular damage (increases in AST or ALT enzymes) without cholestatic alterations (bilirubin and or alkaline phosphatase increases). Six mechanisms were proposed for hepatotoxicity: 1. High energy reactions on P450 cytochrome impairing calcium homeostasis with rupture of intracellular fibrils and hepatocyte lysis. 2. Impairment of transporter proteins related to the bile acids flux (mechanism proposed for fibrate liver toxicity). 3. Immune reactions due to the formation of metabolites linked to enzymes following liver metabolism of hypolipidemic drugs. 4. Hepatotoxicity by T cells with additional inflammation mediated by neutrophils. 5. Apoptosis mediated by TNF and Fas (immune mediated). 6. Oxidative stress due to damage of intracellular organelles. In addition, advanced age, alcohol in excess, high doses of hypolipidemic drugs, interaction with other drugs, and previous active liver disease might increase liver toxicity.", 
    "100": "Ezetimibe is an inhibitor of cholesterol absorption that is liver glucuronized after its rapid absorption, and is mobilized to the enterocytes, where together with its metabolites it exerts hypolipidemic effects, avoiding the absorption of cholesterol, through the reduction of specific cholesterol-transporter enzymes in the gut. This drug can be given once daily due to its prolonged plasma half-life, and is usually very well-tolerated. Elimination of ezetimibe and its metabolites is mainly via fecal excretion. In general, the use of ezetimibe alone promotes modest effects on plasma LDL-c, however, when combined with statins, a remarkable change in the lipid profile can be observed.", 
    "101": "Statins are lipid lowering agents that promote their effects on plasma lipids through the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, a crucial enzyme in the cascade of cholesterol synthesis, leading to reduction of tissue cholesterol pool and consequently, to an upregulation of the LDL receptor expression. There are considerable differences among statins regarding some pharmacokinetic properties, such as the coefficient of hydrophilicity, via liver metabolism (especially regarding P450 cytochrome and isoenzymes), plasma half-life and efficacy of serum lipid changes. They may also differ regarding interactions with other drugs that share the same pathway of metabolism. Recently, many pleiotropic effects have been reported with these drugs, such as anti-inflammatory properties, improvement in endothelial function and benefits on hemostasis.", 
    "102": "Pharmacologic lipid-lowering interventions should be monitored periodically to assess efficacy and safety parameters. Statins are usually well-tolerated drugs and major side effects include increased serum liver and muscle enzymes (AST, ALT, CK). Treatment should be stopped or diminished in case of significant increase of AST or ALT (> 3x ULN), or CK (> 10x ULN). Other lipid lowering agents may also produce hepatotoxicity or myositis, especially in association with statins (fibrates and nicotinic acid) or in presence of metabolic abnormalities (thyroid, liver or renal disorders). Nicotinic acid can also increase glucose and uric acid plasma levels. Laboratory tests might be performed prior to hypolipidemic drug treatment and should be repeated every three months during the first year and then at 6-mo intervals. Shorter intervals should be recommended in individual cases.",

    "107": "The prevalence of angina in Scotland was 28/1000 in men and 25/1000 in women (p < 0.05) and increased with age. The prevalence of angina also increased with increasing socioeconomic deprivation from 18/1000 in the least deprived category to 31/1000 in the most deprived group (p < 0.001 for trend). The incidence of angina was higher in men (1.8/1000) than in women (1.4/1000) (p = 0.004) and increased with increasing age and socioeconomic deprivation. Socioeconomically deprived patients (0.48 contacts/patient among the most deprived) were less likely than affluent patients (0.58 contacts/patient among the least deprived) to see their general practitioner on an ongoing basis p = 0.006 for trend). Among men, 52% were prescribed beta blockers, 44% calcium channel blockers, 72% aspirin, 54% statins and 36% angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. The corresponding prescription rates for women were 46% (p < 0.001), 41% (p = 0.02), 69% (p < 0.001), 45% (p < 0.001) and 30% (p < 0.001). Among patients < 75 years old 52% were prescribed a beta blocker and 58% a statin. The corresponding figures for patients >or= 75 years were 42% (p < 0.001) and 31% (p < 0.001).", 
    "108": "Angina is a common condition, more so in men than in women. Socioeconomically deprived patients are more likely to have angina but are less likely to consult their general practitioner. Guideline-recommended treatments for angina are underused in women and older patients. These suboptimal practice patterns, which are worst in older women, are of particular concern, as in Scotland more women (and particularly older women) than men have angina.", 
    "109": "Calcific aortic stenosis, with a prevalence of 3-9%, is the most frequent heart valve disease and the main cause for valve replacement in patients over 60 years of age. Once thought to be caused by a passive calcium precipitate within the aortic valve leaflets, there is now increasing evidence that development and progression of calcific aortic valve disease may be triggered by underlying genetic and cardiovascular risk factors, and is regulated by an active cellular process involving inflammatory pathways. Targeted drug therapy to prevent the progression of calcific aortic valve disease should ideally be based on the knowledge of risk factors and the molecular pathogenesis of the disease. Conflicting data exists on the potency of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (i.e. statins) to influence both risk factors and inflammatory pathways by lowering lipid levels and exerting anti-inflammatory properties, respectively. In this review, various aspects of the molecular pathogenesis of calcific aortic stenosis will be summarized and connected with recent experimental and clinical studies that address the potential benefit of the targeted drug therapy by statins in order to prevent the progression of the disease.", 
    "110": "To study initiation, dosages, and compliance with beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors, and statins in patients after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and to identify likely targets for improvement.", 
    "111": "Patients admitted with first AMI between 1995 and 2002 were identified by linking nationwide administrative registers. A total of 55 315 patients survived 30 days after discharge and were included; 58.3% received beta-blockers, 29.1% ACE-inhibitors, and 33.5% statins. After 1, 3, and 5 years, 78, 64, and 58% of survivors who had started therapy were still receiving beta-blockers, 86, 78, and 74% were receiving ACE-inhibitors, and 85, 80, and 82% were receiving statins, respectively. Increased age and female sex were associated with improved compliance. The dosages prescribed were generally 50% or less of the dosages used in clinical trials, and dosages did not increase during the observation period. Patients who did not start treatment shortly after discharge had a low probability of starting treatment later.", 
    "112": "The main problem with underuse of recommended treatment after AMI is that treatment is not initiated at an appropriate dosage shortly after AMI. A focused effort in the immediate post-infarction period would appear to provide long-term benefit.", 
    "113": "Coronary heart disease is still highly prevalent worldwide, and stable angina pectoris is one of its more common presentations. Three major controversies are risk factor management, drug therapy, and intervention. As well as the major risk factors stated by the Framingham study and European guidelines, other factors include abdominal obesity, metabolic syndrome, and psychological stress. How should these additional factors be rated? With respect to drug therapy, apart from aspirin, all patients with stable angina should be assessed for statin treatment. Although statins will reduce coronary events by about one third in patients with vascular disease, the absolute benefit depends on the absolute risk. Non-controversially, all patients should be considered for angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors. The concept that beta blockers are protective from future coronary events can be disputed. Percutaneous coronary intervention can relieve symptoms without extending lifespan beyond medical therapy. However, strong mortality data favour coronary-artery bypass grafting in individuals with triple-vessel or even double-vessel disease. Thus, effort angina needs comprehensive assessment, lifestyle changes, and treatment tailored to the individual patient.", 
    "114": "Restenosis after stent implantation is mainly caused by neointimal proliferation through the stent struts. Experimental studies performed in the last decade indicate that inflammatory mechanisms play a key role in the process of neointimal proliferation and restenosis. Coronary stenting is a strong inflammatory stimulus, and the acute local and systemic inflammatory responses to local inflammation produced by coronary stenting are highly individual and predictive of restenosis and event-free survival. The benefit of anti-inflammatory periprocedural therapy, such as with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) and steroids, and long-term follow-up is dependent on the individual's inflammatory status. Measurement of acute-phase reactants, such as C-reactive protein plasma concentration, appears to be important for the identification of subjects at high risk and the development of specific treatment tailored to individual patients.", 
    "115": "It is now accepted that inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis is effective in the primary and secondary prevention of heart disease. However, the perceived side-effects on muscle and liver reduce the general acceptance of statin drug therapy as well as compliance over the long term, which is necessary for prevention efforts to be successful. Chinese red yeast rice (CRYR) is a supplement containing lovastatin (monacolin K), eight other monacolins, pigments, tannins, and other phytochemicals. The authors previously reported on a double- blind placebo-controlled trial of CRYR supplement in 80 individuals demonstrating a significant decrease in cholesterol levels from 250 mg/dL to 210 mg/dL over 8 weeks independent of diet. The current study compared the pharmacokinetics of CRYR with lovastatin at the same bioeffective dose for lowering cholesterol.", 
    "116": "Eleven (11) healthy volunteers were randomized to a crossover study taking 2400 mg CRYR or 20 mg of lovastatin.", 
    "117": "The Cmax and area under the curve (AUC) of lovastatin were 22.42 ng/mL, and 80.47 higher than CRYR (p = 0.001 and 0.002, respectively). The Cmax for lovastatin hydroxy-acid was 36.63 ng/mL higher than the Cmax of CRYR hydroxy-acid (p = 0.001). The AUC of lovastatin hydroxy-acid was 258.5 greater than that of CRYR (p = 0.001).", 
    "118": "The results suggested that the effect of CRYR on the cholesterol concentration might be caused by the additive and/or synergistic effects of monacolin K with other monacolins and substances in CRYR. It may lead to the ultimate development of a botanical supplement based on CRYR.", 
    "119": "The purpose of this study was to examine the antiosteoporosis effects of garlic oil in an ovariectomized (Ovx) rat model of osteoporosis and to compare its efficacy with lovastatin (a synthetic hypocholesterolemic drug) and 17beta-estradiol (a potent antiosteoporotic agent). Animals were divided into five groups: sham-operated control, ovariectomized, ovariectomized supplemented with lovastatin, ovariectomized supplemented with garlic oil and ovariectomized supplemented with 17beta-estradiol. In our study, the development of a high rate of bone turnover and osteoporosis in the ovariectomized animals were confirmed by significant alterations of serum alkaline phosphatase activity, serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase activity, urinary excretion of calcium, phosphate, hydroxyproline and urinary calcium to creatinine ratio, when compared with the sham-operated control group. Supplementation of these animals with either garlic oil or lovastatin or 17beta-estradiol, in addition to their hypocholesterolemic effect, could counterbalance all these changes. The results revealed that all three compounds significantly protected the hypogonadal bone loss as reflected by higher bone densities and higher bone mineral contents than the ovariectomized group of animals. The results emphasize that, like 17beta-estradiol, the hypocholesterolemic compounds garlic oil and lovastatin are also effective in suppressing bone loss owing to estrogen deficiency and their efficacy in the order of lower to higher is garlic < lovastatin < 17beta-estradiol.", 
    "120": "Vascular calcification, such as coronary and aortic calcification, is a significant feature of vascular pathology, since this lesion is associated with cardiovascular disease. Statins are potent serum cholesterol-reducing drugs, which decrease the risk of cardiovascular diseases. Besides reducing serum cholesterol levels, statins are shown to decrease the rate of coronary artery calcification by unidentified mechanism. Though previous observational studies have shown that statins decrease the rate of calcific aortic valve stenosis, recent prospective study have revealed that statins are not effective against the progression of calcific aortic stenosis. We need to establish the role of statins in the prevention of aortic valve stenosis with long-term, large-scale, randomized controlled study.", 
    "121": "Statins are inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase used in the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). In addition to their cholesterol-lowering activities, statins exert pleiotropic antiinflammatory effects, which might contribute to their beneficial effects not only on CVD but also on lipid-unrelated immune and inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, stroke, and transplant rejection. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in these antiinflammatory properties of statins are unresolved. Here we show that the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha mediates antiinflammatory effects of simvastatin in vivo in models of acute inflammation. The inhibitory effects of statins on lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory response genes were abolished in PPARalpha-deficient macrophages and neutrophils. Moreover, simvastatin inhibited PPARalpha phosphorylation by lipopolysaccharide-activated protein kinase C (PKC) alpha. A constitutive active form of PKCalpha inhibited nuclear factor kappaB transrepression by PPARalpha whereas simvastatin enhanced transrepression activity of wild-type PPARalpha, but not of PPARalpha mutated in its PKC phosphorylation sites. These data indicate that the acute antiinflammatory effect of simvastatin occurs via PPARalpha by a mechanism involving inhibition of PKCalpha inactivation of PPARalpha transrepression activity.", 
    "122": "There is increasing interest in the management of stroke in ethnic minorities but few studies have considered this issue. This study investigated if differences in acute stroke management exist between a white European and Bangladeshi populations living in London, England.", 
    "123": "All stroke surviving patients discharged over a five year period in a major London teaching hospital based in an ethnically diverse area of inner city London were recruited. Cerebrovascular risk factors, their management, and investigation for acute stroke syndromes were recorded and comparison between white and Bangladeshi cohorts was made. Categorical data were analysed using Fisher's exact test.", 
    "124": "Measurement of cholesterol concentrations are undertaken less often in those from a Bangladeshi background (25%) compared with white Europeans (76%) (p<0.0001). Statin therapy tends to be given less often to Bangladeshis. However, neuroimaging (p<0.05) and echocardiography (p<0.0001) is performed more often in Bangladeshis compared with white Europeans.", 
    "125": "There are variations in the management of acute stroke because of ethnicity and these variations could have substantial consequences on secondary rates of cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease. Whether the reasons for this disparity are attributable to inequity or iniquity of care need to be further investigated perhaps along with the development of ethnicity specific protocols. Overall the management of stroke and its risk factors in either racial group remains lamentable.", 
    "126": "Atherosclerosis and the metabolic derangements of insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus are all associated with underlying inflammatory processes. C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of inflammation, has been shown to be a strong independent predictor of vascular events. It adds to cardiovascular disease risk at all levels of low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol and Framingham risk scores, and elevated levels are also associated with increasing severity of the metabolic syndrome. The development of a simple, stable, noninvasive test to measure high-sensitivity CRP has provided a clinical tool that may have an important role in the identification and assessment of individuals likely to develop cardiovascular or metabolic disease. The role of CRP in predicting cardiovascular risk is less clear in African Americans, however, than in white populations. Statins and thiazolidinediones are being investigated for their potential role in the prevention and treatment of the inflammatory processes involved in the metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. In the future, assessment of CRP levels may contribute importantly to clinical decision-making in reducing cardiovascular risk.", 
    "127": "To determine the status of lipid management in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) in Japan, we assessed CAD patients who had been receiving lipid-lowering therapy for six months in a cross-sectional survey conducted between June 2001 and December 2002. We defined the achievement rate as the percentage of patients who achieved the target LDL-C level (< 100 mg/dl) specified by the Japan Atherosclerosis Society (JAS). A total of 1,836 Japanese CAD patients were enrolled. In total, 549 (29.9%) achieved the target level. The achievement rate among those receiving statin therapy was 41.3%, which was significantly higher than that (23.4%) among the patients not receiving statin (P < 0.0001). The rate differed with the type of statin; being 54.7% for atorvastatin, 24.8% for pravastatin, 37.1% for simvastatin, and 27.8% for fluvastatin. A multiple regression analysis revealed that atorvastatin use (P < 0.001), and simvastatin use (P = 0.004) significantly contributed to the achievement of the target LDL-C level. In conclusion, large proportions of CAD patients are not achieving the JAS target and the success rates are not similar among different statin therapies, suggesting that cardiologists should consider a more aggressive lipid-lowering therapy with the appropriate choice of statins in Japanese CAD patients.", 
    "128": "To evaluate the effect of pravastatin on both lipid and glucose metabolism, twenty-two consecutive dyslipidemic patients treated with pravastatin at 10 mg/day for one year were enrolled in this study. The meal test, which consisted of 115 g of cookies (energy 560 kcal; glucose 75 g; protein 7 g; fat 24 g), was conducted before and after one year of treatment. Insulin resistance was assessed by the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), by the area under the IRI curve (AUC-IRI), and by the formula AUC-IRI x AUC-PG. After one year of treatment with pravastatin, the plasma glucose (PG), immunoreactive insulin (IRI) and C-peptide levels were unchanged after fasting and at 120 minutes after the meal test; however, PG, IRI and C-peptide levels at 60 minutes after the meal were all significantly decreased from baseline (p < 0.05). AUC-IRI and AUC-IRI x AUC-PG were also significantly decreased (p < 0.05). HOMA-IR was reduced by 26.8%, but the reduction was not significant. The triglyceride (TG) level was decreased after fasting and increased at 60 and 120 minutes after the meal test, but not significantly. This study demonstrated that pravastatin not only reduced serum lipids, but also improved the glucose metabolism, including insulin resistance, of dyslipidemic patients.", 
    "129": "We investigated the effect of 7-ketocholesterol (7-KCHO) on the activity of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-9) in human monocytic THP-1 cells, and the inhibition of this effect by fluvastatin. In cells incubated with 7-KCHO or cholesterol, the activity of MMP-9 was enhanced, accompanying an increase in the secretion of MMP-9 proenzyme (pro-MMP-9). However, the activity of MMP-9 and the amount of pro-MMP-9 were significantly greater following incubation with 7-KCHO than cholesterol. Neither 7-KCHO nor cholesterol influenced the amount of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 secreted by THP-1 cells. When fluvastatin was added to the cells, the MMP-9 activity stimulated by 7-KCHO or cholesterol decreased significantly, accompanying a decrease in the secretion of pro-MMP-9 and TIMP-1. The inhibition of pro-MMP-9 secretion by fluvastatin was stronger in the cells incubated with 7-KCHO than with cholesterol. These results suggest that 7-KCHO activates macrophage and enhances MMP-9 activity, and its effects may be inhibited by fluvastatin.", 
    "130": "Despite reports that statin treatment reduces the rate of coronary restenosis with a balloon expandable stent, there is no evidence that statins affect the incidence of restenosis with a self-expanding Radius stent. Ninety-five patients with acute coronary syndrome who had been implanted with a Radius stent were classified into two groups: those with hyperlipidemia and initial statin treatment (statin group, n = 38) and those without statin treatment (comparative group, n = 57). At six months after stent implantation, the rate of coronary restenosis was significantly lower in the statin group (10.5%) than control group (28.1%) (p = 0.033), while there were no differences in morphology, maximal inflation pressure or stent size between the two groups. Interestingly, there was no difference in the serum lipid profile between the two groups at the 6-month follow-up, although the statin group had a significantly lower rate of restenosis. In conclusion, initial statin therapy reduced the rate of coronary restenosis even when a Radius stent was implanted.", 
    "131": "Hydroxymethyglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibition (statin) therapy has been shown to reduce cardiac hypertrophy in vitro and in vivo. We assessed the influence of short-term statin therapy on left ventricular (LV) remodeling after acute myocardial in-farction. Thirty-five patients with first anterior acute myocardial infarction, who underwent primary coronary angioplasty within 12 hours of onset, were divided into 2 groups. Ten patients taking statin served as the statin group, and 25 patients not taking statin served as the control group. Two-dimensional echocardiography was recorded after angioplasty (baseline) and at 4 weeks. LV ejection fraction (LVEF) at baseline was not significantly different between the 2 groups. However, the statin group had a higher LVEF at 4 weeks than the control group (58.2 +/- 5.0 versus 49.0 +/- 12.7%; P < 0.05). Moreover, the increase in LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) at 4 weeks was lower in the statin group than in the control group (12.1 +/- 29.6 versus 39.9 +/- 35.7 mL; P < 0.05). Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that administration of statin was an independent factor for the increase in LVEDV (P < 0.05). These findings indicate that short-term statin therapy can prevent postinfarct LV remodeling and improve LV function.", 
    "132": "Recent studies suggest that advanced glycation end products (AGEs) can promote the development of atherosclerotic lesions in a similar manner to oxidatively modified low density lipoproteins. As oxidative stress accelerates the formation of AGEs, antioxidant drugs may exert atheroprotective effects via suppression of AGE formation. Although amlodipine, a calcium channel blocker, and fluvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitor, show antioxidant and atheroprotective effects, the relation of AGEs to their effects is unknown. We immunohistochemically investigated the inhibitory effects of chronic treatment with amlodipine (5 mg/kg per day) or fluvastatin at a dose insufficient to reduce plasma cholesterol levels (2 mg/kg per day) on the accumulation of AGEs in atherosclerotic aortas of rabbits fed 1% cholesterol diet and 10% fructose containing water. After eight weeks of treatment, AGEs, namely argpyrimidine, carboxymethyllysine and pyrraline, markedly accumulated with intimal thickening in cholesterol and fructose-fed control rabbits, while the drugs inhibited those changes other than the pyrraline deposition without plasma lipid-lowering effects. Enhanced lipid peroxidation was observed in plasma from cholesterol and fructose-fed rabbits only, and lipid peroxidation was not suppressed by the drugs. These results suggest that the atheroprotective effects of the drugs are at least partly due to the suppression of AGE accumulation although the exact mechanism of AGE suppression is ambiguous.", 
    "133": "Consumption of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA) inhibitors, known as statins, has been associated with elevated transaminase levels but rarely with acute hepatitis. Recently, several cases of acute hepatitis secondary to atorvastatin therapy have been published. We report the case of a 72-year-old man who developed acute cholestatic hepatitis after reinitiating treatment with atorvastatin at a higher dose than that previously prescribed. After treatment discontinuation, the patient made a full recovery, with normalization of clinical and laboratory findings.", 
    "134": "Osteoporosis is the most common bone disease, affecting millions of people worldwide and leading to significant morbidity and high expenditure. Most of the current therapies available for its treatment are limited to the prevention or slowing down of bone loss rather than enhancing bone formation. Recent discovery of statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) as bone anabolic agents has spurred a great deal of interest among both basic and clinical bone researchers. In-vitro and some animal studies suggest that statins increase the bone mass by enhancing bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2)-mediated osteoblast expression. Although a limited number of case-control studies suggest that statins may have the potential to reduce the risk of fractures by increasing bone formation, other studies have failed to show a benefit in fracture reduction. Randomized, controlled clinical trials are needed to resolve this conflict. One possible reason for the discrepancy in the results of preclinical, as well as clinical, studies is the liver-specific nature of statins. Considering their high liver specificity and low oral bioavailability, distribution of statins to the bone microenvironment in optimum concentration is questionable. To unravel their exact mechanism and confirm beneficial action on bone, statins should reach the bone microenvironment in optimum concentration. Dose optimization and use of novel controlled drug delivery systems may help in increasing the bioavailability and distribution of statins to the bone microenvironment. Discovery of bone-specific statins or their bone-targeted delivery offers great potential in the treatment of osteoporosis. In this review, we have summarized various preclinical and clinical studies of statins and their action on bone. We have also discussed the possible mechanism of action of statins on bone. Finally, the role of drug delivery systems in confirming and assessing the actual potential of statins as anti-osteoporotic agents is highlighted.",

    "137": "We identified 2576 first-time admitted cases of acute pancreatitis from hospital discharge registers in three Danish counties, and 25 817 age- and gender-matched controls from the general population. Prescriptions for statins prior to admission with acute pancreatitis or index date among controls were retrieved from prescription databases. We used conditional logistic regression analysis to estimate odds ratios for acute pancreatitis among ever (ever before), current (0-90 days before), new (first prescription in 0-90 days before) and former (>90 days, but not 0-90 days before) users of statins.", 
    "138": "Adjusted odds ratios for acute pancreatitis among ever, current, new and former users of statins were 1.44 (95% confidence interval: 1.115-1.80), 1.26 (95% confidence interval: 0.96-1.64), 1.01 (95% confidence interval: 0.43-2.37) and 2.02 (95% confidence interval: 1.37-2.97), respectively. There was an indication of an inverse association between the number of filled prescriptions and risk of acute pancreatitis.", 
    "139": "Our findings speak against a strong causative effect of statins on the risk of acute pancreatitis, and may even indicate a mild protective effect.", 
    "140": "Prolonged-release (PR) nicotinic acid (niacin) [Niaspan] is an oral, once-daily formulation of the lipid-modifying drug designed to produce less vasodilatory flushing than crystalline immediate-release (IR) nicotinic acid and less hepatotoxicity than previous sustained-release formulations of nicotinic acid.PR nicotinic acid appears to retain the same level of efficacy as crystalline IR nicotinic acid and be better tolerated than older nicotinic acid formulations. Nicotinic acid has beneficial effects on all traditional blood lipid and lipoprotein fractions and is the most effective agent for increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (HDL-C) and reducing lipoprotein(a). The effects of PR nicotinic acid are often additive when used in combination with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), making it a useful addition when lipid goals are not achieved with the usual statin monotherapy or when additional correction of a specific lipid abnormality is required. PR nicotinic acid also slows atherosclerotic progression and even appears to produce regression of atherosclerosis in patients on stable statin therapy. PR nicotinic acid is a logical drug choice for treating atherogenic dyslipidaemia commonly associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus and the metabolic syndrome, and has been shown to be effective in patients with diabetes without adversely affecting glycaemic control in the majority of patients. The incidence of vasodilatory flushing with PR nicotinic acid is lower than with IR nicotinic acid and it decreases substantially over time as tolerance develops. To date, there has been no clinically significant hepatotoxicity observed with PR nicotinic acid. Therefore, once-daily PR nicotinic acid appears to maximise the potential benefits of nicotinic acid, while minimising any historical tolerability or safety concerns.", 
    "141": "Although evidence from basic research suggests the involvement of angiotensin II (Ang II) in the progression of arteriosclerosis, the clinical data are limited. In the present study, hypertensive outpatients who were well controlled with antihypertensive medication and had similar blood pressure levels were studied, and arterial elasticity was compared between those receiving Ang II receptor blockers (ARBs) and those treated with other antihypertensive agents. The effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (STs) on arterial elasticity were also evaluated. The study enrolled 298 outpatients who had been diagnosed with essential hypertension whose blood pressure was controlled to 150/95 or less by antihypertensive treatment (excluding angiotensin converting enzyme [ACE] inhibitors) for at least 2 months. The small artery elasticity index (SAEI) was determined for each patient from the radial artery pulse waves using a non-invasive pulse wave analysis system CR-2000. The mean of two blood pressure measurements taken from subjects lying in a recumbent position during SAEI analysis was used for the data analysis. The patients were grouped according to the use of ARBs and STs, and two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for statistical comparisons. A backward stepwise multiple regression analysis was carried out to identify factors contributing to the SAEI. Hypertensive patients receiving ARB treatment had a significantly higher SAEI compared to those not receiving ARBs, despite the similar blood pressure levels of both groups. No significant effects of ST treatment on the SAEI were observed (two-way ANOVA). A backward stepwise multiple regression analysis for the SAEI suggested that ARB treatment was an independent determinant of the SAEI after the adjusting of age, gender, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking and systolic blood pressure. Our results suggested that while providing blood pressure control similar to that of other antihypertensive agents, ARBs may also increase vascular elasticity and thereby delay the progression of arteriosclerosis.", 
    "142": "In conclusion, our targets for LDL-C are changing. Right now, the goal is less than 100 mg/dL, with an optional goal of less than 70 in very-high-risk individuals. To achieve these targets, we have available more effective statins as well as more effective combination therapies. An exciting area for potentially even greater reduction in events is raising HDL-C in conjunction with aggressive efforts to lower LDL-C.", 
    "143": "3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, commonly known as statins, account for most cholesterol-lowering drug use in the United States. A recent large case-control study reported that use of statins for more than 5 years was associated with a 47% reduction in risk of colorectal cancer. No other large studies have examined this association. We examined the association between use of cholesterol-lowering drugs and colorectal cancer incidence among 132,136 men and women in the Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort. We identified 815 incident cases of colorectal cancer among study participants during follow-up from the date of completion of a study questionnaire in 1997 through August 31, 2001. Current use of cholesterol-lowering drugs was not associated with colorectal cancer incidence (multivariable adjusted rate ratio [RR] = 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.85 to 1.26). Current use of cholesterol-lowering drugs for 5 years or more was also not associated with colorectal cancer incidence (multivariable adjusted RR = 1.09, 95% CI = 0.83 to 1.43). Our results do not support the hypothesis that statin use strongly reduces risk of colorectal cancer. However, we cannot rule out a small reduction in risk or an effect associated with only specific types or doses of statins.",

    "155": "The aim of this study was to develop an automated sampling method to measure lovastatin in a conscious and freely moving rat. The blood samples were collected by means of the automated blood sampling system DR-II and the faecal samples were collected using a metabolic cage. The concentration of lovastatin was determined by a reversed-phase liquid chromatographic system with a UV absorbance detector. The mobile phase contained acetonitrile and 10 mm NaH2PO4 in the proportions 60:40 (v/v) with a flow-rate of 1 mL/min. The calibration curve was linear in concentration ranges of 0.05-100 and 0.1-100 microg/mL for lovastatin in blood and faecal samples, respectively. Following pharmacokinetic analysis, we identified that the maximum plasma concentration was around 1.18 +/- 0.08 microg/mL at concentration peak time 120 min and almost 78% of loading dose was accumulated in the faeces within 48 h after lovastatin administration (500 mg/kg, p.o.).", 
    "156": "A specific, accurate, precise and reproducible high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was developed for the estimation of rosuvastatin (RST), a novel, synthetic and potent HMG-CoA inhibitor in rat plasma. The assay procedure involved simple liquid-liquid extraction of RST and internal standard (IS, ketoprofen) from a small plasma volume directly into acetonitrile. The organic layer was separated and evaporated under a gentle stream of nitrogen at 40 degrees C. The residue was reconstituted in the mobile phase and injected onto a Kromasil KR 100-5C18 column (4.6 x 250 mm, 5 microm). Mobile phase consisting of 0.05 m formic acid and acetonitrile (55:45, v/v) was used at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min for the effective separation of RST and IS. The detection of the analyte peak was achieved by monitoring the eluate using a UV detector set at 240 nm. The ratio of peak area of analyte to IS was used for quantification of plasma samples. Nominal retention times of RST and IS were 8.6 and 12.5 min, respectively. The standard curve for RST was linear (r2 > 0.999) in the concentration range 0.02-10 microg/mL. Absolute recoveries of RST and IS were 85-110 and >100%, respectively, from rat plasma. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of RST was 0.02 microg/mL. The inter- and intra-day precisions in the measurement of quality control (QC) samples, 0.02, 0.06, 1.6 and 8.0 microg/mL, were in the range 7.24-12.43% relative standard deviation (RSD) and 2.28-10.23% RSD, respectively. Accuracy in the measurement of QC samples was in the range 93.05-112.17% of the spiked nominal values. Both analyte and IS were stable in the battery of stability studies, viz. benchtop, autosampler and freeze-thaw cycles. RST was found to be stable for a period of 30 days on storage at -80 degrees C. The application of the assay to determine the pharmacokinetic disposition after a single oral dose to rats is described.", 
    "157": "Management of cerebrovascular disease involves medical and surgical therapies. Medical management, including antiplatelet therapy and statin therapy, has been mainstay treatment for the prevention of this disabling problem. Several studies have shown improved outcome in the prevention of stroke in patients who are taking these medications. Surgical management has also firmly established itself as an important modality in treating this disease. Several prospective, randomized trials have defined the patients that would have the most benefit from carotid endarterectomy. These include asymptomatic patients with a stenosis of 60% stenosis or more and symptomatic patients with a stenosis of 50% or more. The timing of carotid endarterectomy after stroke remains controversial, but recent studies advocate early carotid endarterectomy in a select group of patients. During the carotid endarterectomy, the method of closing of the arteriotomy has an overall effect on the safety of the procedure and on long-term outcome. Compared with primary repair of the arteriotomy, patch closure has been shown to decrease the frequency of restenosis. In addition, carotid eversion endarterectomy is an alternative method to remove the plaque and has an efficacy similar to standard carotid endarterectomy. The role of carotid angioplasty and stenting, which offers the patient a less invasive method of treating the carotid plaque, continues to evolve.", 
    "158": "Conversions of statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, from lactone forms to their corresponding hydroxy acid form in 0.1 N NaOH or 0.05 N KOH (prepared with 25, 50, 75, 90% acetonitrile or methanol in water or 100% water) were evaluated. Results showed that lactone form statins could be transformed almost completely only in alkaline solutions prepared with 25 or 50% acetonitrile. In all methanolic alkaline solutions, lactone form statins could also be converted entirely, nevertheless, they would be further transformed to the methyl ester of the hydroxy acid form and the transformation increased as methanol rises. When lactone and hydroxy acid forms of statins were in methanol, ethyl acetate, 70% acetonitrile in water (with 0.5% acetic acid or no) for 0-48 h at room temperature or in 100 degrees C water for 0-2 h, lactone form statins were converted to their corresponding hydroxy acids, which were raised as time extends and the highest conversions of them were about 35% in 100 degrees C water and 70% acetonitrile, slightly transformed for lactone form statins in 70% acetonitrile (with 0.5% acetic acid) after 8 h, and the other treatments for all statins showed no significant changes. Interferences would be reduced efficiently when statins were extracted from Pu-Erh tea with methanol, ethyl acetate or 100 degrees C water followed by purifying through a C18 solid-phase extraction cartridge. Lovastatin was the only statin found in Pu-Erh tea and the highest content of it was found under ethyl acetate extraction. In ethyl acetate and methanol extracts, lovastatin existed merely as lactone form. The lowest content of lovastatin was found in the 100 degrees C water extract of Pu-Erh tea, however, both of lactone and hydroxy acid forms were found to exist in the extract.", 
    "159": "With the growing clinical usage of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), the number of reports concerning serious drug-drug interaction has been increasing. Because recent studies have shown that conversion between acid and lactone forms occurs in the body, drug-drug interaction should be considered on both acid and lactone forms. Thus, we investigated the inhibitory effects of acid and lactone forms of eight statins, including one recently withdrawn, cerivastatin, and two recently developed, pitavastatin and rosuvastatin, on cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP3A4/5 metabolic activities and multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) transporting activity.",

    "161": "The acid forms had minimal inhibitory effects on all CYP activities tested, except for fluvastatin on CYP2C9-mediated tolbutamide 4-hydroxylation (IC50 = 1.7 microM) and simvastatin on CYP3A4/5-mediated paclitaxel 3-hydroxylation (12.0 microM). Lactone forms showed no or minimal inhibitory effects on CYP2C8, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 activities, except for rosuvastatin on the CYP2C9 activity (20.5 microM), whereas they showed stronger inhibitory effects on the CYP3A4/5 activity with the rank order of atorvastatin (5.6 microM), cerivastatin (8.1 microM), fluvastatin (14.9 microM), simvastatin (15.2 microM), rosuvastatin (20.7 microM), and lovastatin (24.1 microM). Pitavastatin and pravastatin had little inhibitory effect, and a similar order was found also for testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation. MDR1-mediated transport of [3H]digoxin was inhibited only by lactone forms, and the rank order correlated with that of inhibitory effects on both CYP3A4/5 activities. Inhibitory effects on MDR1 activity, and on both CYP3A4/5 activities, could be explained by the lipophilicity; however, a significant correlation was found between the lipophilicity and inhibitory effects on CYP2C8-mediated paclitaxel 6alpha-hydroxylation.", 
    "162": "We showed the difference between the acid and lactone forms in terms of drug interaction. The lipophilicity could be one of the important factors for inhibitory effects. In the case of statins, it is important to examine the effects of both forms to understand the events found in clinical settings, including the pleiotropic effects.", 
    "163": "Statins were shown to possess immunomodulating properties, but the mechanisms of statin effects on the immune system are poorly understood. We analyzed the influence of statins on professional antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DC). Immature DC were cultivated from monocytes of healthy donors. DC maturation was induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 1 microg/mL). Unstimulated and LPS-stimulated DC were treated with simvastatin or atorvastatin (0.1-1 microM). The expression of CD40, CD83, CD86, and human leukocyte antigen-DR on unstimulated and LPS-stimulated DC was reduced significantly by statins, and the expression of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR4 on LPS-stimulated DC was enhanced temporarily. Statins caused a significant reduction of endocytosis of fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran by DC. Statins significantly inhibited the basal secretion of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor alpha from unstimulated DC, and their release from LPS-stimulated DC was enhanced. In mixed leukocyte reaction, preincubation of LPS-stimulated DC with statins significantly suppressed their clustering with T cells and their ability to induce T cell proliferation, CD71, and CD25 up-regulation on T cells and the secretion of interferon-gamma and IL-2 from T cells. In conclusion, this study showed that statins suppressed endocytosis, basal secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, and the ability of DC to induce T cell proliferation, activation, and T helper cell type 1 differentiation. However, statin preincubation of LPS-stimulated DC caused a further increase in their secretion of proinflammatory cytokines.", 
    "164": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in industrialized countries. Patients with diabetes and insulin resistance are at even greater risk than the general population. Risk factors may be even more significant in predicting risk of disease when present in diabetic patients. Interaction among the elements of the metabolic syndrome/insulin resistance (MS/IR) in atherogenesis is currently the subject of much research. Efforts to understand the elements of the dyslipidemias associated with MS/IR are now beginning to pay off. An increasing number of drugs and other interventions have been shown to be effective in clinical trials in reducing risk factors and improving outcomes. The advantages and disadvantages of possible treatments of these dyslipidemias, including the risks and benefits of combination therapy, are discussed in detail. Finally, strategies for maintaining glucose control and the role of inflammation associated with MS/IR and CVD are described.", 
    "165": "Physiological and pathological tissue remodeling needs an orderly degradation of the extracellular matrix. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are proteases capable of degrading different extracellular matrix components, including collagen and elastin. MMP expression is strongly enhanced in vascular pathologies such as stenosis following balloon dilation, in-stent restenosis, sustained flow changes, aneurysm formation, and atherosclerosis. Experimental studies have revealed that some biological actions of MMPs aggravate a pathological condition, whereas others may be beneficial for the patient suffering from atherosclerotic disease. Therefore, a better understanding of the biological consequence and regulation of MMP activity is critical for the design and potential application of specific MMP inhibitors in vascular disease. In this review, we will give an overview of preclinical experimental studies using MMP inhibitors with the objective to influence vascular occlusive diseases, and we will also highlight new targets that influence MMP expression and activity and that possess potential for therapeutic interventions.",

Among new immunosuppressive drugs introduced into clinical practice, everolimus, has been shown to be safe in cardiac transplantation. We report our experience with everolimus in heart transplant recipients who developed late acute cellular cardiac rejection.", 
    "167": "Patients with a history of previous rejection episodes who experienced cardiac rejection were switched to an everolimus, cyclosporine, and steroid immunosuppressive regimen. All patients had already received statins and antihypertensive medications. Everolimus, cyclosporine trough levels, and laboratory values were controlled monthly. Drug administration was adapted to an everolimus trough level between 3 and 8 ng/mL, mean maintenance dosage was 0.25 to 1.5 mg twice a day. Death, safety, side effects, biopsy-proven acute rejection episodes, laboratory values, and blood levels were evaluated retrospectively.", 
    "168": "Four cardiac allograft recipients (two male, two female), at a median of 1473.25 days post-orthotopic heart transplantation (oHTx) (range = 65 to 3045), received 1 to 1.5 mg everolimus per day. Over a follow-up period of at least 2 month (range = 2 to 10) the mortality was 0%. The drug was well tolerated; no acute cellular rejection greater than grade 1a (ISHLT grading) was observed after 2 months. In one patient increased cholesterol values and in two others, elevated triglyceride levels were seen, but were controlled with increased statin therapy. No obvious increased creatinine values were seen with everolimus.", 
    "169": "In conclusion, conversion to an everolimus-based immunosuppressive regimen after late cardiac rejection is safe and effective; no major side effects were observed."
