    "1": "We firstly established AD rat models using intracerebroventricular injection of A\u03b21-42. A Morris water maze was also performed to determine the spatial learning and memory ability in the AD models. Intracellular staining of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha was determined using immunohistochemical staining at 6 hours and day 7 after the injection of A\u03b2.", 
    "2": "The escape latency of the atorvastatin-treated AD group (5 mg/kg/d) was significantly shorter than that of AD group on day 3 (41 \u00b1 1.05 seconds versus 47 \u00b1 1.05 seconds, P < 0.01) and day 4 (34 \u00b1 1.25 seconds versus 43 \u00b1 1.01 seconds, P < 0.01) after the beginning of the training. Furthermore, the atorvastatin-treated AD group displayed a significant higher mean number of annulus crossings than did the AD group (2.9 \u00b1 0.5 versus 2.4 \u00b1 0.9, P < 0.05). Fewer injured nerve cells and proliferated glial cells were also demonstrated in the atorvastatin-treated AD group than in the AD group. Of great importance, we demonstrated that IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha were significantly decreased in the atorvastatin-treated AD group than that in the AD group.",

Atherogenic (primarily LDL) particle number is typically determined either directly by the serum concentration of apolipoprotein B (apo B) or indirectly by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of serum to obtain NMR-derived LDL particle number (LDL-P).", 
    "5": "To assess the comparability of apo B and LDL-P, we reviewed 25 clinical studies containing 85 outcomes for which both biomarkers were determined. In 21 of 25 (84.0%) studies, both apo B and LDL-P were significant for at least 1 outcome. Neither was significant for any outcome in only 1 study (4.0%). In 50 of 85 comparisons (58.8%), both apo B and LDL-P had statistically significant associations with the clinical outcome, whereas in 17 comparisons (20.0%) neither was significantly associated with the outcome. In 18 comparisons (21.1%) there was discordance between apo B and LDL-P.", 
    "6": "In most studies, both apo B and LDL-P were comparable in association with clinical outcomes. The biomarkers were nearly equivalent in their ability to assess risk for CVD and both have consistently been shown to be stronger risk factors than LDL-C. We support the adoption of apo B and/or LDL-P as indicators of atherogenic particle numbers into CVD risk screening and treatment guidelines. Currently, in the opinion of this Working Group on Best Practices, apo B appears to be the preferable biomarker for guideline adoption because of its availability, scalability, standardization, and relatively low cost.",

Outcome was time to first clinical event (CV event, renal or hepatic disease, incident diabetes, thrombotic/embolic event, nontraumatic fracture, non-AIDS-defining malignancy, serious bacterial infection, or nonaccidental death); event categories were also analyzed separately. Inverse probability of treatment and censoring weighted Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the causal statin effect. Differential statin effects by baseline covariates were evaluated.",

In a final weighted model, the adjusted HR (AHR) was 0.81 (95% CI, .53- 1.24). Results for other clinical events were similar, except for malignancies (AHR, 0.43 [95% CI, .19-.94]) and bacterial infections (AHR, 1.30 [95% CI, .64-2.65]). No differential statin effects by baseline covariates were detected.",

    "16": "The poor viability of transplanted stem cells hampers their therapeutic efficacy for treatment of myocardial infarction. The aim of this study was to investigate whether rosuvastatin improved survival of adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AD-MSCs) after transplantation into infarcted hearts. AD-MSCs isolated from Tg(Fluc-egfp) mice which constitutively express both firefly luciferase (Fluc) and enhanced green fluorescent protein were transplanted into infarcted hearts with or without rosuvastatin administration. Longitudinal in vivo bioluminescence imaging and histological staining revealed that rosuvastatin enhanced the survival of engrafted AD-MSCs. Furthermore, combined therapy of AD-MSC and rosuvastatin reduced fibrosis, decreased cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and preserved heart function. AD-MSCs were then subjected to hypoxia and serum deprivation injury in vitro to mimic the ischemic environment. Rosuvastatin (10(-6) mmol/L) enhanced the viability and paracrine effect of AD-MSCs, and decreased their apoptotic rate. Western blotting revealed that rosuvastatin supplementation increased Akt and ERK phosphorylation, which resulted in FoxO3a phosphorylation and nuclear export. In addition, rosuvastatin administration decreased the pro-apoptotic proteins Bim and Bax, and increased the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-xL and Bcl-2. Furthermore, these effects were abolished by PI3K inhibitor LY294002 and MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126. This study demonstrates that rosuvastatin may improve the survival of engrafted AD-MSCs at least in part through the PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK1/2 signaling pathways. Combination therapy with rosuvastatin and AD-MSCs has a synergetic effect on improving myocardial function after infarction.", 
    "17": "The present study dealt with the forced degradation behaviour of rosuvastatin under ICH prescribed stress conditions. The drug was found to be labile under acid hydrolytic and photolytic conditions, while it was stable to base/neutral hydrolytic, oxidative and thermal stress. In total, 11 degradation products were formed, which were separated on a C-18 column using a stability-indicating method. LC-MS analyses indicated that five degradation products had the same molecular mass as that of the drug, while the remaining six had 18 Da less than the drug. Structure elucidation of all the degradation products was executed using sophisticated and modern structural characterization tools, viz. LC-MS/TOF, LC-MS(n), on-line H/D exchange and LC-NMR. The degradation pathway and mechanisms of degradation of the drug were delineated. Additionally, in silico toxicity was predicted for all the degradation products using TOPKAT and DEREK software and compared with the drug. This study demonstrates a comprehensive approach of degradation studies during the drug development phase.", 
    "18": "Doxorubicin (DOX), a potent chemotherapeutic agent, is widely used for the treatment of various malignancies. However, its clinical uses are limited due to its dose-dependent adverse effects particularly cardiac and testicular toxicities. DOX-induced toxicity is mainly due to the induction of oxidative stress. Atorvastatin (ATV), a 3-hydroxy 3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, with lipid-lowering activity, acts as an antioxidant at lower doses. It possesses pleiotropic effects independent of cholesterol-lowering property usually shown at lower doses, which include antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. The present study was aimed to investigate the possible protection exerted by atorvastatin against oxidative stress and DNA damage induced by DOX in the heart and testes of mice. The protective role of ATV in the heart and testes of DOX-treated mice was evident from the amelioration of oxidative stress, DNA and cellular damage. The present study clearly indicates that ATV offers a significant protection against DOX-induced oxidative stress and DNA damage in the heart and testes of mice.", 
    "19": "During the past 20 years, tremendous progress has been made in our understanding of the molecular basis of many genetic skin conditions. The translation of these laboratory findings into effective therapies for affected individuals has been slow, however, in large part due to the risk of carcinogenesis from random viral genomic integration and the lack of efficacy of topically applied genetic material and most proteins. As intervention at the gene level still appears remote for most genetic disorders, increased knowledge about the cellular and biochemical pathogenesis of disease allows specific targeting of pathways with existing and/or novel drugs and molecules. In contrast to the requirement for personalization of most gene-based approaches, pathogenesis-based therapy is pathway specific, and in theory, it should have broader applicability. In this chapter, we provide an overview of the pathoetiology of the various types of ichthyoses and demonstrate how a pathogenesis-based approach can potentially lead to innovative treatments for these conditions. Notably, this strategy has been successfully validated for the treatment of the rare X-linked dominant condition, CHILD syndrome, in which topical applications of cholesterol and lovastatin together to affected skin resulted in marked improvement of the skin phenotype.", 
    "20": "The protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi displays similarities to fungi in terms of its sterol lipid biosynthesis, as ergosterol and other 24-alkylated sterols are its principal endogenous sterols. The sterol pathway is thus a potential drug target for the treatment of Chagas disease. We describe here a comparative study of the growth inhibition, ultrastructural and physiological changes leading to the death of T. cruzi cells following treatment with the sterol biosynthesis inhibitors (SBIs) ketoconazole and lovastatin. We first calculated the drug concentration inhibiting epimastigote growth by 50% (EC(50)/72 h) or killing all cells within 24 hours (EC(100)/24 h). Incubation with inhibitors at the EC(50)/72 h resulted in interesting morphological changes: intense proliferation of the inner mitochondrial membrane, which was corroborated by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy of the parasites stained with rhodamine 123, and strong swelling of the reservosomes, which was confirmed by acridine orange staining. These changes to the mitochondria and reservosomes may reflect the involvement of these organelles in ergosterol biosynthesis or the progressive autophagic process culminating in cell lysis after 6 to 7 days of treatment with SBIs at the EC(50)/72 h. By contrast, treatment with SBIs at the EC(100)/24 h resulted in rapid cell death with a necrotic phenotype: time-dependent cytosolic calcium overload, mitochondrial depolarization and reservosome membrane permeabilization (RMP), culminating in cell lysis after a few hours of drug exposure. We provide the first demonstration that RMP constitutes the \"point of no return\" in the cell death cascade, and propose a model for the necrotic cell death of T. cruzi. Thus, SBIs trigger cell death by different mechanisms, depending on the dose used, in T. cruzi. These findings shed new light on ergosterol biosynthesis and the mechanisms of programmed cell death in this ancient protozoan parasite.", 
    "21": "In clinical practice, blood pressure (BP)-lowering agents are generally prescribed for use in the morning, whereas (short-acting) statins are recommended for use in the evening. There is evidence that the reduction in LDL cholesterol (LDL-c) achieved with short-acting statins is superior when taken in the evening and reported improvement in BP control when aspirin and BP-lowering agents are taken in the evening. However, it is unclear whether the additional reduction in LDL-c and BP is offset by a reduction in adherence, given that taking medication in the evening may be less typical or convenient. There is therefore uncertainty concerning the best timing of administration of a cardiovascular combination pill such as the polypill.", 
    "22": "The aim of TEMPUS (NCT01506505), a prospective randomized open blinded endpoint (PROBE) crossover trial, is to evaluate whether there is a difference in LDL-c levels or 24-hour ambulatory BP in individuals at increased risk of cardiovascular disease when the cardiovascular polypill is taken in the evening compared to the morning. An additional aim is to assess the effect of the polypill on LDL-c and BP compared to the administration of separate pills of identically dosed components of the polypill.", 
    "23": "In total 75 participants with established cardiovascular disease or an intermediate to high risk for cardiovascular disease are randomly allocated to the sequence of three different treatments of 6-8 weeks: (1) the cardiovascular polypill (aspirin 75 mg, simvastatin 40 mg, lisinopril 10 mg, and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg) in the evening; (2) the polypill in the morning; and (3) the use of the identically dosed agents in separate pills taken at different time points during the day. The primary endpoint is the difference in LDL-c and mean 24-hour ambulatory systolic BP. Secondary outcomes are the difference in relative risk reduction, biochemistry, platelet function and pulse wave analysis, participants' adherence, and acceptability.",

    "25": "The population pharmacokinetics (PPK) of atorvastatin and its principal active metabolite, o-hydroxyatorvastatin, were described in 6-17 years old pediatric hypercholesterolemia patients with a 2-compartment model for both parent and metabolite. Informative prior distributions on selected parameters, based on adult data, were required to stabilize the model and were implemented using a Bayesian penalty term on the likelihood function in the nonlinear mixed effects model (NONMEM VI with PRIOR). Concentrations below the limit of quantitation were treated as censored data using a conditional likelihood function. Atorvastatin apparent oral clearance (CL/F) was described as a function of body weight using an allometric equation. Based on the final model, the typical CL/F estimates for a Tanner Stage 1 patient (35 kg weight) and Tanner Stage \u22652 (50 kg weight), would be 553 and 543 L/hour, respectively. When scaled allometrically, CL/F was similar to values reported for adults. Variability in atorvastatin PK was primarily affected by weight.", 
    "26": "We investigated the mechanisms of ritonavir-mediated enhancement effect on the pharmacokinetics of saquinavir using in vivo probes for CYP3A4 (midazolam), p-glycoprotein (fexofenadine), and OATP1B1 (pravastatin) following oral micro/small dosing. A cocktail of the drugs (2\u2009mg of saquinavir, 100\u2009\u00b5g of each probe) was administered to eight healthy volunteers (phase 1), and then coadministered with 20\u2009mg (phase 2) and 100\u2009mg (phase 3) of ritonavir. Plasma concentrations of the drugs were measured by validated LC-MS/MS methods. The mean plasma AUC0-24 (pg\u2009hour/mL) of saquinavir at phases 1, 2, and 3 was 101, 2\u2009540, and 23\u2009900 (P\u2009<\u2009.01), respectively. The relative area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC)0-24 ratios of midazolam and fexofenadine at phases 1, 2, and 3 were 1:5.9:14.7 (P\u2009<\u2009.01), and 1:1.4:2.2 (P\u2009<\u2009.01-.05), respectively. In contrast, there was no difference in the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin. Inhibition of intestinal and hepatic CYP3A-mediated metabolism, and intestinal p-glycoprotein-mediated efflux of saquinavir, but not OATP1B1, is involved in the enhancement mechanism. Micro/small dosing is useful for examining the mechanism of drug interactions without safety concern.", 
    "27": "Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease causing muscle weakness due to impaired transmission at the neuromuscular junction. MG or a MG-like condition may be triggered or exacerbated by several drugs used for treatment of other diseases. Drugs may interfere with the neuromuscular transmission through several mechanisms, either by affecting pre- or postsynaptic ion channels or by affecting acetylcholinesterase. Based on a literature search in PubMed and the authors' own clinical experiences, we provide an overview focusing on the most frequently used drugs that may exacerbate weakness in patients with MG. In our experience, symptomatic MG-patients who have a generalised disease are especially vulnerable to drug-induced exacerbations, while stable MG patients with few symptoms more seldom are. Nevertheless, patients with MG must receive treatment for co-existing conditions. It is important to be aware of a possible increase in muscle weakness when introducing a new drug. If the patient deteriorates, the new treatment must be withdrawn or the dose reduced.", 
    "28": "Cryptosporidiosis, a diarrheal disease usually caused by Cryptosporidium parvum or Cryptosporidium hominis in humans, can result in fulminant diarrhea and death in AIDS patients and chronic infection and stunting in children. Nitazoxanide, the current standard of care, has limited efficacy in children and is no more effective than placebo in patients with advanced AIDS. Unfortunately, the lack of financial incentives and the technical difficulties associated with working with Cryptosporidium parasites have crippled efforts to develop effective treatments. In order to address these obstacles, we developed and validated (Z' score = 0.21 to 0.47) a cell-based high-throughput assay and screened a library of drug repurposing candidates (the NIH Clinical Collections), with the hopes of identifying safe, FDA-approved drugs to treat cryptosporidiosis. Our screen yielded 21 compounds with confirmed activity against C. parvum growth at concentrations of <10 \u03bcM, many of which had well-defined mechanisms of action, making them useful tools to study basic biology in addition to being potential therapeutics. Additional work, including structure-activity relationship studies, identified the human 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor itavastatin as a potent inhibitor of C. parvum growth (50% inhibitory concentration [IC(50)] = 0.62 \u03bcM). Bioinformatic analysis of the Cryptosporidium genomes indicated that the parasites lack all known enzymes required for the synthesis of isoprenoid precursors. Additionally, itavastatin-induced growth inhibition of C. parvum was partially reversed by the addition of exogenous isopentenyl pyrophosphate, suggesting that itavastatin reduces Cryptosporidium growth via on-target inhibition of host HMG-CoA reductase and that the parasite is dependent on the host cell for synthesis of isoprenoid precursors.", 
    "29": "Statins interact with multiple pathways involved in infection. Therefore, we examined the association between preoperative statin therapy and infections after cardiac operations and assessed whether statin therapy was associated with lower infection-related mortality.", 
    "30": "From January 2005 to January 2011, 12,741 patients underwent cardiac operations. Endpoints were (1) postoperative infections and (2) mortality after an infectious complication. A propensity score was developed on the probability of patients receiving statin therapy; patients were matched in part on this score. A multivariable logistic model was developed to examine mortality. Survival of infected patients was estimated using Kaplan-Meier and multiphase hazard function methodology.", 
    "31": "A total of 6,113 patients (48%) were receiving statins and 6,628 (52%) were not. Five hundred fifteen patients had postoperative infections-260 (4.3%) in the statin group and 255 (3.8%) in the no-statin group. However, patients receiving statins were older with more comorbidities and less favorable operative characteristics. Among propensity-matched groups, postoperative infections were significantly lower in patients receiving statins (n = 102 [3.1%]) than in those who were not (n = 147 [4.5%]; p = 0.004). Among patients in whom infections developed, there was no significant difference in hospital mortality between the statin and no-statin groups either before or after propensity-score matching (odds ratio, 1.38; confidence limit [CL], 0.59, 3.22; p = 0.5).",

    "33": "Lipophilic (logP > 1) and amphiphilic drugs (also known as cationic amphiphilic drugs) with ionizable amines (pKa > 6) can accumulate in lysosomes, a process known as lysosomal trapping. This process contributes to presystemic extraction by lysosome-rich organs (such as liver and lung), which, together with the binding of lipophilic amines to phospholipids, contributes to the large volume of distribution characteristic of numerous cardiovascular and central nervous system drugs. Accumulation of lipophilic amines in lysosomes has been implicated as a cause of phospholipidosis. Furthermore, elevated levels of lipophilic amines in lysosomes can lead to high organ-to-blood ratios of drugs that can be mistaken for active drug transport. In the present study, we describe an in vitro fluorescence-based method (using the lysosome-specific probe LysoTracker Red) to identify lysosomotropic agents in immortalized hepatocytes (Fa2N-4 cells). A diverse set of compounds with various physicochemical properties were tested, such as acids, bases, and zwitterions. In addition, the partitioning of the nonlysosomotropic atorvastatin (an anion) and the lysosomotropics propranolol and imipramine (cations) were quantified in Fa2N-4 cells in the presence or absence of various lysosomotropic or nonlysosomotropic agents and inhibitors of lysosomal sequestration (NH4Cl, nigericin, and monensin). Cellular partitioning of propranolol and imipramine was markedly reduced (by at least 40%) by NH4Cl, nigericin, or monensin. Lysosomotropic drugs also inhibited the partitioning of propranolol by at least 50%, with imipramine partitioning affected to a lesser degree. This study demonstrates the usefulness of immortalized hepatocytes (Fa2N-4 cells) for determining the lysosomal sequestration of lipophilic amines.",

The percentage of confirmed high risk patients prescribed a statin was 17.7% before and 52.9% after the programme. There was a marked variation in Health Check uptake, exception reporting and statin prescribing between practices.",

    "39": "Myocardial depression in septic shock is well known, but its pathophysiological genesis is incompletely understood. To assess the incidence and extent of stress-induced histologic myocardial alterations in septic shock, a prospective, observational, combined clinical and postmortem study was conducted, and 20 patients dying from septic shock were included. Exclusion criteria were younger than 18 years, pregnancy, open heart surgery or cardiopulmonary resuscitation, acute neurologic diseases, pheochromocytoma, and forensic autopsy. A systematic macropathologic evaluation was performed. Nine predefined heart sections were histologically screened for myocytolysis, interstitial fibrosis, contraction band necrosis, mononuclear infiltrates, interstitial edema, and tissue hemorrhage. Stress-induced pathologies were found in 90% to 100% of patients in all heart sections (myocytolysis, 100%; interstitial fibrosis, 100%; contraction band necrosis, 95%; mononuclear infiltrates, 90%; interstitial edema, 90%; tissue hemorrhage, 30%). The incidence and extent of contraction band necrosis, mononuclear infiltrates, and myocytolysis did not differ between sexes; patients with or without chronic \u03b2-blocker, calcium antagonist, and/or statin premedication; or between the binary use of different catecholamine agents (all comparisons P > 0.05). The maximum epinephrine dose correlated with the overall extent of mononuclear infiltrates (Spearman-Rho, r = 0.704; P = 0.05) and myocytolysis (Spearman-Rho, r = 0.933; P = 0.001). Maximum norepinephrine doses correlated with the extent of mononuclear infiltrates in the left ventricular anterior wall (Spearman-Rho, r = 0.519; P = 0.02). The total duration of catecholamine therapy was correlated with the extent of mononuclear infiltrates in the apex (Spearman-Rho, r = 0.571; P = 0.009) and right atrium (Spearman-Rho, r = 0.535; P = 0.02). In conclusion, our results suggest that histologic lesions potentially indicative of stress-induced cardiotoxicity can be observed in most patients dying from septic shock.", 
    "40": "Adipocytes behave as a rich source of pro-inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1). Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in adipocytes can alter adipokines secretion and induce inflammation. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of simvastatin on the ox-LDL-induced ER stress and expression and secretion of TNF-\u03b1 and MCP-1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Differentiated adipocytes were treated with various concentrations of ox-LDL (0-100 \u03bcg/ml) for 24h with or without simvastatin pre-treatment. The protein expressions of ER stress markers, glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78) and C/EBP homology protein (CHOP), were determined by Western blot analysis. The mRNA expressions of TNF-\u03b1 and MCP-1 were measured by real-time PCR. The protein release of TNF-\u03b1 and MCP-1 in culture medium were evaluated by ELISA. Ox-LDL treatment led to significant up-regulation of GRP78 and CHOP in dose-dependent manner. The expressions of TNF-\u03b1 and MCP-1 were dose-dependently increased at mRNA and protein levels after ox-LDL intervention. The effects of ox-LDL on adipocytes were abolished by pre-treatment with 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA), a chemical chaperone known to ameliorate ER stress. Simvastatin could inhibit ox-LDL-induced ER stress and reduce the expression of TNF-\u03b1 and MCP-1 at mRNA and protien level in dose dependent manner. In conclusion, ox-LDL can stimulate the expression and secretion of TNF-\u03b1 and MCP-1 through its activation of ER stress in adipocytes. Simvastatin might exert direct anti-inflammatory effects in adipocytes through amelioration of ER stress.", 
    "41": "Based on the cardiovascular (CV) outcomes data derived predominantly from 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin) trials, guidelines have set low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol targets at successively lower levels over time. Recent data have demonstrated that more-intensive statin therapy (and, consequently, lower LDL cholesterol level) is more effective at reducing CV events than less-intensive statin therapy. Although the average LDL cholesterol level for a United States adult is 119 mg/dl, within the \"normal\" range (90 to 130 mg/dl) per the United States National Cholesterol Education Program-Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines, data from fetal studies, diet studies, contemporary hunter-gatherer populations, and other mammals have suggested that the \"normal\" physiologic range for LDL cholesterol in humans is likely 50 to 70 mg/dl. Low LDL cholesterol levels have been sporadically associated with an increased risk of cancer, hemorrhagic stroke, and other complications in population studies and clinical trials. However, statin clinical trials have generally not demonstrated correlations between on-treatment LDL cholesterol levels and safety. Clinical data have suggested a linear relation between LDL cholesterol lowering and CV risk reduction, supporting a favorable risk/benefit ratio for attaining very low levels of LDL cholesterol to minimize the risk of CV events. In conclusion, clinical trial evidence demonstrating the efficacy and safety of LDL cholesterol lowering to a very low level is essential to ascertain the benefits and risks in reducing the residual risk of vascular disease.",

However, which strategy is more effective for treating patients with CAD has not been established.

Laboratory-based investigations confirmed that these were gain-of-function mutations. Further studies in cohorts with low LDL cholesterol (LDLc) levels from large epidemiological cardiovascular studies reported that loss-of-function mutations in PCSK9 were associated with protection from cardiovascular disease. An additional critical observation provided evidence that the interaction of PCSK9 and the LDL receptor was through circulating, not intracellular, PCSK9, which bound to the receptor, and then mediated the recycling of the LDL receptor. These findings established PSCK9 as a potential therapeutic target and resulted in biopharmaceutical companies developing interventions designed to lower LDLc levels. Clinical development programs for monoclonal antibodies against PCSK9 have advanced rapidly with completion of comprehensive phase 1 and 2 trials with both REGN727/SAR236553 (REGN727) and AMG 145, clearly demonstrating substantial reductions in LDLc levels in patients receiving diet alone, low, moderate, and high doses of statins, or statin combined with ezetimibe, and both heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and nonfamilial hypercholesterolemia subjects. Concomitant and parallel reductions in the levels of apolipoprotein B and its related lipoproteins, and small but significant increases in HDL cholesterol levels were seen as anticipated. An unanticipated and robust decrease in lipoprotein(a) levels was also noted.

Mice were given intratracheal LPS 7 days after cyclophosphamide administration, after which pravastatin was administered by intraperitoneal injection. In order to study the effects of pravastatin, mice were killed on day 5. Pravastatin attenuated the pulmonary edema and histopathological changes of LPS-induced lung injury. The accumulation of neutrophils and the concentrations of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and MPO in BAL fluids were also effectively inhibited by pravastatin. The expression levels of Toll-like receptor 4, nuclear factor kappa B, tumor growth factor-\u03b2 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 were significantly reduced by pravastatin.

After pretreatment with ATV (10 mg\u00b7kg\u00b7d) or its vehicle for 3 days, the superior mesenteric artery was occluded for 60 minutes and reperfusion for 90 minutes or the rats were anesthetized without being subjected to ischemia. In the ATV-treated I/R group, the increased contractions to KCl and 5-hydroxytryptamine induced by I/R were ameliorated, and attenuated endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine (ACh) were normalized. The restored relaxation to ACh was abolished by N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester. ATV prevented the structural damage of vascular endothelial cells. Furthermore, the activities of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, Akt, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase were elevated in mesenteric arteries after ATV treatment. In addition, I/R-induced increment of endothelial cells apoptosis was also attenuated by ATV. Intriguingly, ATV also increased baroreflex sensitivity and serum ACh content after I/R. In conclusion, the endothelial protective effect of ATV in peripheral arteries is associated with the activated phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/Akt/endothelial nitric oxide synthase pathway and restored vagal activity.", 
    "70": "Incubational binding or the fraction of drug unbound in an in vitro incubation, fuinc, is an important parameter to predict or measure in the pursuit of accurate clearance predictions from in vitro data. Here we describe a method for fuinc determination directly in the hepatocyte intrinsic clearance (CLint) assay with emphasis on compounds that are actively transported into hepatocytes, hypothesizing that for such compounds the typical protocol of 1 million hepatocytes/ml systematically underestimates the maximum attainable unbound intracellular drug concentration. Using the transporter substrate atorvastatin as a test compound, incubations were performed and a mathematical model applied to describe metabolism, distribution, and binding at different hepatocyte concentrations. From these investigations it was evident that, since binding is more extensive intracellularly than in the medium, increased partitioning into the cellular volume, due to active uptake, increases the total amount of atorvastatin bound in the incubation. Consequently, a significant lowering of the hepatocyte concentration impacts the free drug concentration in the incubation and increases the observed rate of metabolism and therefore observed CLint (that is, when viewed from the media drug concentration). The applicability of the findings was tested for a series of 11 actively transported zwitterions for which standard rat hepatocyte metabolic CLint data (1 million cells/ml incubation) poorly predicted in vivo clearance (average fold error of 5.4). Using metabolic CLint determined at a lower hepatocyte concentration (0.125 million cells/ml) considerably improved clearance predictions (average fold error of 2.3).",

Approximately 30% (r(2) = 0.28) of the variation in oral clearance (CL/F) of atorvastatin was explained by hepatic OATP1B1 protein expression (P = 0.041). Patients carrying the SLCO1B1 c.521C variant allele (homozygous, n = 4; heterozygous, n = 2) exhibited 45% lower CL/F of atorvastatin than the c.521TT carriers (P = 0.067). No association between hepatic and intestinal expression of MDR1 or CYP3A4 and atorvastatin pharmacokinetics was found (P > 0.149). In conclusion, this study suggests that OATP1B1 phenotype is more important than CYP3A4 and MDR1 phenotypes for the individual pharmacokinetic variability of atorvastatin.", 
    "97": "Statin therapy is an important secondary prevention measure in cardiovascular disease. However, the side effects associated with statin use could potentially affect patients' quality of life. Little is known about the influence of statin therapy on the well-being and health status of cardiac patients, in general, and patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), in particular. We investigated the association between statin therapy and symptoms of anxiety and depression and patients' health status during the 12 months after implantation, reckoning with statin type and dosage. Consecutively implanted ICD patients (n = 409; 78.2% men) completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36-item Health Survey at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months after implantation. The data were analyzed using general linear mixed modeling repeated measures multivariate analysis of variance. Of the 409 patients, 60% were prescribed statins. Statin use was independently associated with poorer role limitations-physical (p = 0.001), social functioning (p = 0.007), and role limitations-emotional (p = 0.006) during the 12 months after implantation, independent of statin type, dosage, and other potential confounders. The associations between statin therapy and depression (p = 0.06) and statin therapy and physical functioning (p = 0.05) were borderline significant, and no association was found with anxiety (p >0.05). In conclusion, statin therapy was associated with impaired health status on 3 of the 8 Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36-item Health Survey health status subdomains. This is the first study of ICD patients to examine the association between statin therapy and patient well-being. Future research is warranted to replicate these findings.", 
    "98": "Considerable progress has been made in identifying genetic risk factors for idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions in the past 30 years. These reactions can affect various tissues and organs, including liver, skin, muscle and heart, in a drug-dependent manner. Using both candidate gene and genome-wide association studies, various genes that make contributions of varying extents to each of these forms of reactions have been identified. Many of the associations identified for reactions affecting the liver and skin involve human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes and for reactions relating to the drugs abacavir and carbamazepine, HLA genotyping is now in routine use prior to drug prescription. Other HLA associations are not sufficiently specific for translation but are still of interest in relation to underlying mechanisms for the reactions. Progress on non-HLA genes affecting adverse drug reactions has been less, but some important associations, such as those of SLCO1B1 and statin myopathy, KCNE1 and drug-induced QT prolongation and NAT2 and isoniazid-induced liver injury, are considered. Future prospects for identification of additional genetic risk factors for the various adverse drug reactions are discussed.", 
    "99": "Monascus-fermented monascin and ankaflavin are found to strongly inhibit differentiation and lipogenesis and stimulate lipolysis effects in a 3T3-L1 preadipocyte model, but the in vivo regulation mechanism is unclear. This study uses obese rats caused by a high-fat diet to examine the effects of daily monascin and ankaflavin feeding (8 weeks) on antiobesity effects and modulation of differentiation, lipogenesis, and lipid absorption. The results show that monascin and ankaflavin had a significant antiobesity effect, which should result from the modulation of monascin and ankaflavin on the inhibition of differentiation by inhibiting CCAT/enhancer-binding protein \u03b2 (C/EBP\u03b2) expression (36.4% and 48.3%) and its downstream peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) (55.6% and 64.5%) and CCAT/enhancer-binding protein \u03b1 (C/EBP\u03b1) expressions (25.2% and 33.2%) and the inhibition of lipogenesis by increasing lipase activity (14.0% and 10.7%) and decreasing heparin releasable lipoprotein lipase (HR-LPL) activity (34.8% and 30.5%). Furthermore, monascin and ankaflavin are the first agents found to suppress Niemann-Pick C1 Like 1 (NPC1L1) protein expression (73.6% and 26.1%) associated with small intestine tissue lipid absorption. Importantly, monascin and ankaflavin are not like monacolin K, which increases creatine phosphokinase (CPK) activity, known as a rhabdomyolysis indicator.",

Problems of coil compaction, recanalization and rare endothelialization at the aneurysm orifice are not yet solved. We investigated the efficacy of a simvastatin coating applied without any additional matrix to coils to accelerate thrombus organization in the cavity in a rat model of aneurysm. Twelve metal coils coated with simvastatin and 12 bare coils were inserted into the ligated external carotid arterial (ECA) sacs of rats. The ECA sacs were removed 2 or 4 weeks after the coils were implanted and examined by histology and immunohistochemical assay. The organized areas in the ECA sacs in the simvastatin group (73.6 \u00b1 19.4%, 2 wk; 83.4 \u00b1 11.1%, 4 wk) was significantly higher p = 0.003, 2 wk; p = 0.0004, 4 wk than the bare metal group at 2 and 4 weeks (20.5 \u00b1 10.7%, 2 wk, p < 0.003; 37.4 \u00b1 20.6%, 4 wk, p < 0.0004). Organized tissues that formed around the coils coated with simvastatin were characterized by an accumulation of cells positive for \u03b1SMA and collagen connective matrix. Tissues also were accompanied by marked formation of endothelium at the orifice of the ECA sac. We suggest that coating coils with simvastatin effectively accelerated organization within the aneurysms and endothelialization over the coil.", 
    "101": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by the accumulation of triglycerides in hepatocytes in the absence of excessive alcohol intake, ranging in severity from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis can ultimately progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. NAFLD is associated with cardiometabolic risk factors and is the most common chronic liver disease among adults in the Western Hemisphere. Although simple steatosis is generally considered a self-limiting disease, evidence suggests an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, and, less conclusively, mortality, among individuals with NAFLD and/or NASH. The current standard of care for the treatment of patients with NAFLD focuses on lifestyle interventions, particularly diet and exercise. There is a lack of consensus regarding the most effective and appropriate pharmacologic therapy. A PubMed search was conducted using the medical subject heading terms \"fatty liver\" and \"steatohepatitis.\" This review focuses on the current pharmacologic options available for treating adults with NAFLD and/or NASH. Continued investigation of drugs or combinations that improve NAFLD progression is crucial. Clinicians, particularly pharmacists, must take an active role in identification and appropriate selection of pharmacotherapy for NAFLD.", 
    "102": "Breast cancer tends to arise in older women who are also burdened with comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease (CVD). Increasing numbers of breast cancer survivors and an aging population warrant a better understanding of CVD management and adherence to preventive therapies. We estimated adherence to statins and therapeutic goal lipid values during the year before breast cancer diagnosis or baseline, treatment period, and in subsequent years of clinical management among breast cancer survivors. We sampled women from an existing cohort of 4,221 women diagnosed with incident early stage (I, II) invasive breast cancer from 1990 to 2008 and enrolled in a large integrated group practice health plan. Among prevalent statin users (N = 1,393), medication adherence and persistence were measured by medication possession ratio (MPR), % adherent (MPR < 0.80), and discontinuation rates. Laboratory data on LDL and HDL were obtained for the coinciding periods. Mean MPR for statin use (0.78 vs. 0.68; P < 0.001) and proportion adherent (67.0 vs. 51.9 %; P < 0.001) declined from baseline to the treatment period. Mean LDL (143 mg/dL baseline vs. 150 mg/dL treatment period; P < 0.001) and proportion not at LDL goal (60.1 vs. 70.8 %; P < 0.001) coincided with decreases in adherence. During treatment, non-adherent statin users had the highest mean LDL (160.4 mg/dL) and proportion not at goal LDL (91.8 %) overall. Adherence did not return to baseline in subsequent years following treatment although LDL levels did. HDL did not differ by periods of interest or adherence levels. Adherence to statins in this population was poor, particularly in the treatment period, and lagged in returning to baseline. Understanding the influence of life events such as cancer diagnosis and treatment on management of comorbidities and adherence to preventive therapies are important to the growing population of breast cancer survivors.",

On the other hand, renal function markedly declined after acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The aims of the present study were (1) to identify what type of patients with AMI would have high L/H ratio at follow-up and (2) to evaluate whether decline in renal function after AMI had accelerated or not in patients with high L/H ratio. The 190 eligible AMI patients who underwent primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and received atorvastatin (10\u00a0mg) were divided into one of two groups according to the L/H ratio at 6-month follow-up: L/H >2 group (n\u00a0=\u00a081) or L/H \u22642 group (n\u00a0=\u00a0109). The characteristics on admission in the two groups were examined. Furthermore, changes in serum creatinine (sCr) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) during 1- and 6-month follow-up were compared between the two groups. L/H >2 group were significantly younger and had greater body mass index (BMI) and worse lipid profile on admission compared with L/H \u22642 group. Percentage increase in sCr and percentage decrease in eGFR during 1-month follow-up in L/H >2 group tended to be greater than in L/H \u22642 group, and those during 6-month follow-up were significantly greater (16.5\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.77 vs. 9.79\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.23\u00a0%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03 and 11.8\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.93 vs. 2.75\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.85\u00a0%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04, respectively). In AMI patients undergoing primary PCI, those who were young and had large BMI and poor lipid profile on admission were likely to have a high L/H ratio at follow-up despite statin therapy. In addition, the decline in renal function after AMI had significantly accelerated in patients with high L/H ratio.",

    "116": "Nicotinic acid has complex effects on lipoprotein metabolism; it increases HDL cholesterol, decreases triglycerides and LDL cholesterol. It also reduces lipoprotein(a) levels by about 25% and exerts certain effects that may be antiatherogenic. Studies performed in the pre-statin era demonstrated a good effectiveness of nicotinic acid on the development of atherosclerotic lesions and on the morbidity and mortality due to cardiovascular diseases. Because of its HDL cholesterol raising properties, nicotinic acid appears to be an ideal companion to statins since low HDL cholesterol concentration has been shown to negatively influence statin-treated patients even when ideal LDL cholesterol concentrations have been reached. In the AIM-HIGH study nicotinic acid did not lead to an improvement in the cardiovascular event rate compared to placebo; however this study has been criticized because of several drawbacks. The results of a large study testing the effect of nicotinic acid in high-risk statin-treated patients are expected to be published in 2013. At present, nicotinic acid can be administered in addition to a statin to patients with a combined hyperlipidemia when the target value of LDL cholesterol has not been reached, and alone to patients suffering from a statin intolerance. An elevation of lipoprotein(a) is not officially recognized as an indication to start a therapy with nicotinic acid. The combination of modified-release nicotinic acid with laropiprant is much better tolerated than previous formulations. New drugs which act on the receptor involved in the action of nicotinic acid are in development.",

It has also been shown that an increase in oxidative stress and inflammatory markers are a feature of the patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). A cross-over study of 26 patients with T2DM taking either simvastatin 40\u2009mg or atorvastatin 10\u2009mg was undertaken. After 3\u2009months on one statin, lipids, C-reactive protein (hsCRP), 25OHD and malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured repeatedly. The same procedure was then followed taking the other statin. Despite similar lipid-lowering, the mean 25OHD was higher on atorvastatin compared with simvastatin and the mean MDA and hsCRP levels lower, irrespective of which statin the patients were taking before crossover. The changes in 25OHD predicted changes in CRP and MDA levels. Thus, compared with simvastatin, atorvastatin shows apparently beneficial pleiotropic effects with respect to 25OHD concentrations as well as markers of oxidative stress and inflammation in patients with T2DM.",

In spite of the proven efficacy of statin drugs in reducing CHD burden, there is still much room for the discovery of novel therapeutic agents to address the considerable residual cardiovascular risk that remains after treatment with currently available medications. In particular, there is an urgent demand for drugs capable of boosting the concentration and/or function of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I), thereby promoting reverse cholesterol transport. Phospholipids are naturally occurring fats that play indispensible role in human health via their structural, energy storage, signal transduction and metabolic functions. Supplementation with either purified or mixed preparations of bioactive phospholipids has been reported to ameliorate a range of nutritional and cardiovascular disorders. Moreover, several lines of evidence have supported the efficacy of dietary phospholipids in reducing serum and hepatic contents of cholesterol and triglycerides, while increasing HDL-C and apo A-I levels. These beneficial effects of phospholipids could be attributed to their ability in reducing intestinal cholesterol absorption, enhancing biliary cholesterol excretion and modulating the expression and activity of transcriptional factors and enzymes that are involved in lipoprotein metabolism. Given their extreme safety and biocompatibility, dietary supplementation with phospholipid preparations, in particular phosphatidylinositol, appears as a novel and effective strategy that could be used as an alternative or adjunctive therapy to the current medications. The present review outlines the in-vitro, in-vivo and clinical findings on the anti-dyslipidemic effects of three most abundant phospholipids in the human body and diet namely phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylinositol.", 
    "129": "Statins are effective cholesterol-lowering drugs that exert pleiotropic effects, including cytotoxicity to cancer cells. We previously reported that simvastatin triggered the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in MethA fibrosarcoma cells, which was accompanied by the translocation of stabilized p53 to the mitochondria. In this study, we investigated whether statins induce the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response and the mechanisms by which this response is linked to the stabilization of p53 and its translocation to the mitochondria. Statins induced typical ER stress-related proteins, such as BiP/78\u00a0kDa glucose-regulated protein (Grp78) and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein homologous protein (CHOP), as well as the phosphorylation of protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), eIF2\u03b1 and JNK. The statin-induced phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 and JNK was inhibited by supplementation with components of the mevalonate pathway, such as mevalonate, farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP). Salubrinal, an inhibitor of the dephosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1, suppressed the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and the translocation of stabilized p53 and Bax to the mitochondria; however, SP600125, a JNK kinase inhibitor, did not exert this effect. Furthermore, the eIF2\u03b1 knockdown sensitized cells to simvastatin-induced apoptosis and the overexpression of a non-phosphorylatable eIF2\u03b1-mutant [serine\u00a051(Ser51)/alanine] enhanced the stabilization of p53 and its translocation to the mitochondria in response to simvastatin treatment. Taken together, these data indicate that eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation in the context of the ER stress response plays a role in cell survival by counteracting the p53-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis in response to statins.", 
    "130": "Whilst the interplay between type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been recognised for many years, recent analyses of existing studies have helped refine several aspects of this relationship with relevance to clinical practice. First, recent data demonstrate that fasting glucose is not linearly related to CVD risk in those without diabetes; rather, risk levels escalate (modestly at first) only beyond specific glucose thresholds. Consequently, glucose-based measures may not necessarily enhance CVD risk prediction in those without diabetes. Second, other data confirm that new-onset diabetes is not a post-myocardial infarction 'risk equivalent' state and that, on average, several years of diabetes duration is needed to attain this level of risk. Third, meta-analyses and systemic reviews have confirmed that diabetes increases CVD risk by around twofold on average and this risk is subject to wide variation, being lowest in those newly diagnosed and highest in those with existing vascular disease, proteinuria or renal disease. Fourth, meta-analyses of major glucose-lowering trials suggest that, whilst glucose-lowering lessens vascular risk, risk reduction arising from statins and blood pressure-lowering is greater. Fifth, statins increase diabetes risk, albeit modestly, adding to the emerging concept that some agents that primarily target CVD risk may be diabetogenic, and vice versa. Finally, arising in part from the latter observation, as well as an understanding that CVD and diabetes risk overlap in some individuals but not others, the case for combined CVD/diabetes risk screening (generally using non-fasting lipids and HbA1c), has gained strength.",

Formation of diclofenac metabolites (typical enzyme activity of CYP2C6) was analyzed using HPLC with UV detection.", 
    "133": "Administration of rosuvastatin to HHTg rats resulted in significantly increased mRNA expression and enzyme activity in HCD-fed animals; changes of CYP2C6 protein were non-significant. These results suggest that CYP2C6 expression and activity are positively affected by rosuvastatin in hereditary hypertriglyceridemic rats after intake of HCD.", 
    "134": "The results presented open the possibility that in humans, rosuvastatin may affect the metabolism of many drugs by influencing expression and activity of CYP2C6 (counterpart of human CYP2C9). Further studies are needed to elucidate the effects of this statin on CYP2C9 in humans.", 
    "135": "Lovastatin, categorized as a class II compound according to the Biopharmaceutics Classification System, is mainly responsible for the blood cholesterol lowering effect of red yeast rice (RYR). The aim of this study was to compare the dissolution rate, physical state, and oral bioavailability of lovastatin in three RYR products (LipoCol Forte, Cholestin, or Xuezhikang) to those of two lovastatin tablets (Mevacor or Lovasta). The results showed that the dissolution rate of lovastatin in various dissolution media in the registered RYR products was faster and higher than that of lovastatin in lovastatin tablets. Powder X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry patterns showed that the crystallinity of lovastatin was reduced in RYR products. In human studies, the AUC and Cmax values for both lovastatin and its active metabolite, lovastatin acid, were significantly higher in volunteers receiving LipoCol Forte capsules or powder than in those receiving lovastatin tablets or powder. In addition, shorter and less variable Tmax values were observed in volunteers taking LipoCol Forte than in those taking lovastatin tablets. These findings suggest that the oral bioavailability of lovastatin is significantly improved in RYR products as a result of a higher dissolution rate and reduced crystallinity.",

    "138": "Washed human platelets were incubated with statins (1-20\u03bcM), and stimulated with collagen (1\u03bcg/ml) or arachidonic acid (AA) (200\u03bcM) and TXB2 was quantified by ELISA. Incubation with simvastatin or atorvastatin reduced (36.2% and 31.0%, respectively) collagen-induced TXB2 synthesis (p<0.05) and platelet aggregation (p<0.001), whereas pravastatin had no effects. Simultaneous incubation with a submaximally effective concentration of aspirin (1\u03bcM) and atorvastatin or simvastatin significantly increased the inhibition of TXB2 synthesis by aspirin by 4.4- and 4.1-fold, respectively. Statins did not affect AA-induced TXB2 synthesis, excluding an effect on COX-1/TXA2 synthase activities. Atorvastatin and simvastatin concentration-dependently inhibited the collagen-induced increase in cytosolic calcium and the kinetics of cPLA2 phosphorylation. Lipophilic statins reduced phosphorylation of both ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK, which regulate cPLA2 phosphorylation and calcium movement.", 
    "139": "We report for the first time a direct downregulation by atorvastatin and simvastatin of platelet cPLA2 activity through effects on calcium and MAPK, which reduce collagen-induced TXA2 synthesis. These mechanisms might contribute to their beneficial effects, even in aspirin-treated patients.", 
    "140": "Recent reports indicate that statins are associated with an increased risk for new-onset diabetes mellitus (DM) compared with placebo and that this relation is dose dependent. The aim of this study was to perform a comprehensive network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the impact of different types and doses of statins on new-onset DM. RCTs comparing different types and doses of statins with placebo were searched for using the MEDLINE, Embase, and Cochrane databases. A search of RCTs pertinent to this meta-analysis covering the period from November 1994 to October 2012 was conducted by 2 independent investigators using the MEDLINE, Cochrane, Google Scholar, and Embase databases as well as abstracts and presentations from major cardiovascular meetings. Seventeen RCTs reporting the incidence of new-onset DM during statin treatment and including a total of 113,394 patients were identified. The RCTs compared either a statin versus placebo or high-dose versus moderate-dose statin therapy. Among different statins, pravastatin 40 mg/day was associated with the lowest risk for new-onset DM compared with placebo (odds ratio 1.07, 95% credible interval 0.86 to 1.30). Conversely, rosuvastatin 20 mg/day was numerically associated with 25% increased risk for DM compared with placebo (odds ratio 1.25, 95% credible interval 0.82 to 1.90). The impact on DM appeared to be intermediate with atorvastatin 80 mg/day compared with placebo (odds ratio 1.15, 95% credible interval 0.90 to 1.50). These findings were replicated at moderate doses. In conclusion, different types and doses of statins show different potential to increase the incidence of DM.", 
    "141": "Many neuropsychiatric symptoms of fragile X syndrome (FXS) are believed to be a consequence of altered regulation of protein synthesis at synapses. We discovered that lovastatin, a drug that is widely prescribed for the treatment of high cholesterol, can correct excess hippocampal protein synthesis in the mouse model of FXS and can prevent one of the robust functional consequences of increased protein synthesis in FXS, epileptogenesis. These data suggest that lovastatin is potentially disease modifying and could be a viable prophylactic treatment for epileptogenesis in FXS.",

Here, we present an updated version of the guidelines, incorporating new recommendations based on recent findings and harmonizing CCS guidelines with those from other Societies. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used, per present standards of the CCS. The total cardiovascular disease Framingham Risk Score (FRS), modified for a family history of premature coronary disease, is recommended for risk assessment. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol remains the primary target of therapy. However, non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol has been added to apolipoprotein B as an alternate target. There is an increased emphasis on treatment of higher risk patients, including those with chronic kidney disease and high risk hypertension. The primary panel has recommended a judicious use of secondary testing for subjects in whom the need for statin therapy is unclear. Expanded information on health behaviours is presented and is the backbone of risk reduction in all subjects. Finally, a systematic approach to statin intolerance is advocated to maximize appropriate use of lipid-lowering therapy. This document presents the recommendations and principal conclusions of this process. Along with associated Supplementary Material that can be accessed online, this document will be part of a program of knowledge translation. The goal is to increase the appropriate use of evidence-based cardiovascular disease event risk assessment in the management of dyslipidemia as a fundamental means of reducing global risk in the Canadian population.",

Restenoses were identified and the limb outcomes recorded. Tibial reinterventions were performed only for persistent, worsening, or recurrent tissue loss or rest pain with evidence of recurrence on duplex ultrasound or hemodynamic imaging.

Tissue loss included gangrene (49%) and ulcers (51%), and involved the forefoot (80%), the heel (14%), or both (6%). Seventy-eight percent of limbs had Trans-Atlantic InterSociety Consensus C/D lesions, with mean preoperative runoff score of 12. Interventions were isolated tibial (45%) or multilevel (55%) (including tibial). Mean postoperative runoff score improved to 6.6, but restenosis occurred in 96 limbs (41%) at a mean of 4 months. The 1-year primary patency was 59% with a mean follow-up of 9 months. Restenosis presented with a persistent wound (32%), worsened wound (42%), rest pain (16%), or no symptoms (10%). A repeat TAEI was performed in 42 (44%), major amputation in 26 (27%), open bypass in 20 (21%), and observation in eight (8%). The overall amputation rate was 13%, but limb loss was significantly higher in patients with restenosis (n = 26 [27%]) than in patients with no restenosis (n = 5 [4%]; P < .001). Patients with restenosis and tissue loss were more likely to have presented with gangrene (63% vs 38%; P = .0003) but had comparable wound distribution (P = NS). There was a trend toward a higher restenosis rate in patients with renal insufficiency (odds ratio, 5.57; P = .08), but this was unaffected by diabetes, statin therapy, or smoking (P = NS). The rate of repeat intervention after the first reintervention was 36%, with an 87% overall limb salvage rate.",

Special attention should be given to patients with extensive tissue loss or gangrene because they are at risk for early restenosis and subsequent limb loss. Strict wound and hemodynamic surveillance, wound care, and timely reinterventions are crucial to achieve successful outcomes in this patient population. Amputation or alternative revascularization options, when feasible, should be considered in patients with restenosis and tissue loss given the high rate of limb loss with tibial reinterventions.",

In this study, a novel drug delivery system for simvastatin by means of hydrothermally converting marine exoskeletons to biocompatible beta-tricalcium phosphate was investigated. Furthermore, the release of simvastatin was controlled by the addition of an outer apatite coating layer. The samples were characterized by x-ray diffraction analysis, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and mass spectroscopy confirming the conversion process. The in-vitro dissolution of key chemical compositional elements and the release of simvastatin were measured in simulated body fluid solution showing controlled release with reduction of approximately 25% compared with un-coated samples.

    "160": "Statins are thought to reduce vascular inflammation through lipid independent mechanisms. Evaluation of such an effect in atherosclerotic disease is complicated by simultaneous effects on lipid metabolism. Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) are part of the atherosclerotic spectrum of diseases. Unlike atherosclerotic occlusive disease, AAA is not lipid driven, thus allowing direct evaluation of putative anti-inflammatory effects. The anti-inflammatory potency of increasing doses (0, 20 or 40 mg/day) simvastatin or atorvastatin was evaluated in 63 patients that were at least 6 weeks on statin therapy and who underwent open AAA repair. A comprehensive analysis using immunohistochemistry, mRNA and protein analyses was applied on aortic wall samples collected during surgery. The effect of statins on AAA growth was analyzed in a separate prospective study in incorporating 142 patients. Both statins equally effectively and dose-dependently reduced aortic wall expression of NF\u03baB regulated mediators (i.e. IL-6 (P<0.001) and MCP-1 (P<0.001)); shifted macrophage polarization towards a M2 phenotype (P<0.0003); selectively reduced macrophage-related markers such as cathepsin K and S (P<0.009 and 0.0027 respectively), and ALOX5 (P<0.0009), and reduced vascular wall NF\u03baB activity (40 mg/day group, P<0.016). No effect was found on other cell types. Evaluation of the clinical efficacy of statins to reduce AAA progression did not indicate an effect of statins on aneurysm growth (P<0.337).

It shares pathogenic similarities with adult cardiovascular disease as well as many risk factors. Attempts at prevention of preeclampsia using various supplements and classes of medications have failed or had limited success, and they were not convincing enough to lead to widespread adoption of any particular strategy. Contrary to the experience with preeclampsia, prevention of cardiovascular mortality and other cardiovascular events in nonpregnant patients using 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, or statins, is widely accepted. Pravastatin and other statins have been shown to reverse various pathophysiologic pathways associated with preeclampsia, such as angiogenic imbalance, endothelial injury, inflammation, and oxidative stress. These beneficial effects are likely to contribute substantially to preventing preeclampsia and provide biological plausibility for the use of pravastatin in this setting. Pravastatin has favorable safety and pharmacokinetic profiles. In addition, animal studies and human pregnancy exposure data do not support teratogenicity claims for pravastatin. Therefore, the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Obstetric--Fetal Pharmacology Research Units Network started a pilot trial to collect maternal--fetal safety data and to evaluate pravastatin pharmacokinetics when used as a prophylactic daily treatment in high-risk pregnant women (identifier NCT01717586, clinicaltrials.gov).", 
    "184": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the main cause of premature death in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The underlying mechanisms of CVD in patients with mild to moderate CKD are different from those with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). While serum cholesterol is frequently elevated and contributes to atherosclerosis in many CKD patients, particularly those with nephrotic proteinuria, it is usually normal, even subnormal, in most ESRD patients receiving hemodialysis. CVD in the ESRD population is primarily driven by oxidative stress, inflammation, accumulation of the oxidation-prone intermediate-density lipoproteins, chylomicron remnants and small dense low-density lipoprotein particles as well as high-density lipoprotein deficiency and dysfunction, hypertension, vascular calcification, and arrhythmias. Only a minority of hemodialysis patients have hypercholesterolemia which is most likely due to genetic or unrelated factors. In addition, due to peritoneal losses of proteins which simulate nephrotic syndrome, peritoneal dialysis patients often exhibit hypercholesterolemia. Clearly when present, hypercholesterolemia contributes to CVD in the CKD and ESRD population and justifies cholesterol-lowering therapy. However, the majority of ESRD patients and a subpopulation of CKD patients with minimal proteinuria have normal or subnormal serum cholesterol levels and do not benefit from and can be potentially harmed by statin therapy. In fact the lack of efficacy of statins in hemodialysis patients has been demonstrated in several randomized clinical trials.
