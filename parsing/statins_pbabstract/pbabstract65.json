In view of these promising observations, we were interested in whether HMG-CoA reductase inhibition would affect epileptiform activity in the brain. To elucidate this issue, atorvastatin, simvastatin and rosuvastatin were administered orally at a dose of 20 mg/kg each for 3 days and their anti-epileptic activities were tested and compared in rats. Epileptiform activity in the brain was induced by an intracortical penicillin G injection. Among HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, simvastatin-treatment was less effective in terms of spike frequency as compared with atorvastatin- and rosuvastatin-treated animals. Atorvastatin treatment reduced spike frequencies and amplitudes significantly throughout the experiment. However, the most pronounced anti-epileptic effect was observed in rosuvastatin-treated animals, which was associated with improved blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity, increased expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) mRNA and decreased expressions of pro-apoptotic p53, Bax and caspase-3 mRNAs. Inhibition of eNOS activity with L-NG-Nitroarginine Methyl Ester (L-NAME) reversed the anti-epileptic effect of rosuvastatin significantly. However, L-NAME did not alter the effect of rosuvastatin on the levels of p53, Bax and caspase-3 mRNA expression. Here, we provide evidence that among HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, rosuvastatin was the most effective statin on the reduction of epileptiform activity, which was associated with improved BBB permeability, increased expression of eNOS and decreased expressions of pro-apoptotic p53, Bax and caspase-3. Our observation also revealed that the anti-epileptic effect of rosuvastatin was dependent on the increased expression level of eNOS.

In this study, we show the contribution of both protein isoprenylation and cholesterol-dependent plasma membrane structural integrity to insulin secretion in INS-1E cells and mouse islets. Acute (2\u200ah) inhibition of hydroxyl-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase by simvastatin (SIM) resulted in inhibition of GSIS without reduction in total cellular cholesterol content. This effect was prevented by cell loading with the isoprenyl molecule geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. Chronic (24\u200ah) inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis resulted in inhibition of GSIS with a significant reduction in total cellular cholesterol content, which was also observed after the inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis downstream of isoprenoid formation. Electron paramagnetic resonance analyses of INS-1E cells showed that the SIM-induced reduction in cholesterol increased plasma membrane fluidity. Thus, the blockade of cholesterol biosynthesis resulted in the reduction of availability of isoprenoids, followed by a reduction in the total cholesterol content associated with an increase in plasma membrane fluidity. Herein, we show the different contributions of cholesterol biosynthesis to GSIS, and propose that isoprenoid molecules and cholesterol-dependent signaling are dual regulators of proper \u03b2-cell function.",

Pitavastatin was administered dietary (10mg/kg) and melatonin in an aqueous solution (20\u03bcg/ml). Chemoprevention began 7 days prior to carcinogen administration and subsequently continued for 15 weeks until autopsy. At autopsy, mammary tumors were removed and prepared for histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis. Compared to controls, Pitavastatin alone reduced average tumor volume by 58% and lengthened latency by 8 days; on the other hand, the drug increased tumor frequency by 23%. Combined administration of Pitavastatin with melatonin decreased tumor frequency by 23%, tumor volume by 44% and lengthened tumor latency by 5.5 days compared to control animals. The analysis of carcinoma cells showed significant increase in caspase-3 expression in both treated groups and a tendency of increased caspase-7 expression after Pitavastatin treatment alone. Significant expression decrease of Ki67 was found in carcinoma cells from both treated groups. Compared to control carcinoma cells, Pitavastatin alone increased VEGF expression by 41%, however melatonin totally reversed its undesirable effect. Pitavastatin combined with melatonin significantly increased femur compact bone thickness in animals. Pitavastatin alone decreased plasma triglycerides and total cholesterol levels, however it significantly increased levels of glucose. In summary, our results show a partial antineoplastic effect of Pitavastatin combined with melatonin in the rat mammary gland carcinoma model.", 
    "55": "The publication of the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines on the treatment of high blood cholesterol has had a strong impact due to the paradigm shift in its recommendations. The Spanish Interdisciplinary Committee for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention and the Spanish Society of Cardiology reviewed this guideline and compared it with current European guidelines on cardiovascular prevention and dyslipidemia management. The most striking aspect of the American guideline is the elimination of the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol treat-to-target strategy and the adoption of a risk reduction strategy in 4 major statin benefit groups. In patients with established cardiovascular disease, both guidelines recommend a similar therapeutic strategy (high-dose potent statins). However, in primary prevention, the application of the American guidelines would substantially increase the number of persons, particularly older people, receiving statin therapy. The elimination of the cholesterol treat-to-target strategy, so strongly rooted in the scientific community, could have a negative impact on clinical practice, create a certain amount of confusion and uncertainty among professionals, and decrease follow-up and patient adherence. Thus, this article reaffirms the recommendations of the European guidelines. Although both guidelines have positive aspects, doubt remains regarding the concerns outlined above.

We also examined the antioxidant effects of EPA in combination with atorvastatin o-hydroxy (active) metabolite (ATM). Glucose-induced changes in membrane structural organization were measured using small angle x-ray scattering approaches and correlated with changes in lipid hydroperoxide (LOOH) levels. EPA was found to inhibit LDL oxidation in a dose-dependent manner (1.0-10.0 \u00b5M) and was distinguished from the other TG-lowering agents, which had no significant effect as compared to vehicle treatment alone. Similar effects were observed in membrane lipid vesicles exposed to hyperglycemic conditions. The antioxidant activity of EPA, as observed in glucose-treated vesicles, was significantly enhanced in combination with ATM. Glucose treatment produced highly-ordered, membrane-restricted, cholesterol crystalline domains, which correlated with increased LOOH levels. Of the agents tested in this study, only EPA inhibited glucose-induced cholesterol domain formation. These data demonstrate that EPA, at pharmacologic levels, inhibits hyperglycemia-induced changes in membrane lipid structural organization through a potent antioxidant mechanism associated with its distinct, physicochemical interactions with the membrane bilayer.",

We employed generalized estimating equations in regression models to study the longitudinal effects of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), statin, and vitamin E on clinical severity of ataxia after adjusting for age, sex, and pathological CAG repeat number. Cross-sectionally, exposure to CoQ10 was associated with lower SARA and higher UHDRS-IV scores in SCA1 and 3. No association was found between statins, vitamin E, and clinical outcome. Longitudinally, CoQ10, statins, and vitamin E did not change the rates of clinical deterioration indexed by SARA and UHDRS-IV scores within 2 years. CoQ10 is associated with better clinical outcome in SCA1 and 3. These drug exposures did not appear to influence clinical progression within 2 years.

Atorvastatin (0.01, 0.1 and 1 mg/kg, p.o.) was administered 1 h before FST.

Administration of pioglitazone or L-NAME in combination with the sub-effective dose of atorvastatin (0.01 mg/kg, p.o.) reduced the immobility time in the FST compared to drugs alone, showing the participation of these pathways; while co-administration of non-effective doses of atorvastatin and pioglitazone with GW9662 or L-arginine reversed antidepressant-like effect of atorvastatin in FST. Data from concurrent use of GW9662 and atorvastatin also demonstrated that the antidepressant effect of atorvastatin was significantly reversed by GW9662.

The risk of developing these conditions is particularly increased in young adults with IBD, and more so in women than in men. Conventional cardiovascular risk factors are not over-represented in patients with IBD, so the increased risk could be attributable to inflammation-mediated atherosclerosis. Patients with IBD often have premature atherosclerosis and have biochemical and genetic markers similar to those seen in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The role of chronic inflammation in IBD-associated cardiovascular disease merits further evaluation. Particular attention should be given to the increased risk observed during periods of increased disease activity and potential modification of the risk by immunosuppressive and biologic therapies for IBD that can modify the disease activity. In addition, preclinical studies suggest that cardiovascular medications such as statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors might also favourably modify IBD disease activity, which warrants further evaluation.",

Our results showed that LCL-SIM inhibits strongly the B16.F10 melanoma growth (by 85%) whereas free SIM was ineffective. Moreover, the antitumor activity of LCL-SIM depends on the presence of functional tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) in tumor tissue and is mainly based on the reduction of the TAM-mediated oxidative stress as well as of the production of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1 \u03b1 (HIF-1 \u03b1) in tumors.

    "185": "The programming of the fungal polyketide synthase (PKS) is quite complex, with a simple domain architecture leading to elaborate products. An additional level of complexity has been found within PKS-based pathways where the PKS is fused to a single module nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) to synthesize polyketides conjugated to amino acids. Here, we sought to understand the communication between these modules that enable correct formation of polyketide-peptide hybrid products. To do so, we fused together the genes that are responsible for forming five highly chemically diverse fungal natural products in a total of 57 different combinations, comprising 34 distinct module swaps. Gene fusions were formed with the idea of testing the connection and compatibility of the PKS and NRPS modules mediated by the acyl carrier protein (ACP), condensation (C) and ketoreductase (KR) domains. The resulting recombinant gene fusions were analyzed in a high-yielding expression platform to avail six new compounds, including the first successful fusion between a PKS and NRPS that make highly divergent products, and four previously reported molecules. Our results show that C domains are highly selective for a subset of substrates. We discovered that within the highly reducing (hr) PKS class, noncognate ACPs of closely related members complement PKS function. We intercepted a pre-Diels-Alder intermediate in lovastatin synthesis for the first time, shedding light on this canonical fungal biochemical reaction. The results of these experiments provide a set of ground rules for the successful engineering of hr-PKS and PKS-NRPS products in fungi.",

These major changes have created controversy and confusion among the medical community, with some clinicians hesitant to embrace the shift. We review the evidence that forms the basis for these major changes, compare them to other major lipid guidelines, and recommend an integrated approach to managing dyslipidemia to decrease atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk.", 
    "187": "Vascular endothelial hyperproliferation is involved in the pathophysiological process of angiogenesis, which is indispensable for tumor growth and spread in hypoxic adaptation. There is increasing evidence indicating that statins have potential anti-angiogenesis benefits. However, the intracellular signaling mechanism underlying the effect of statins in vascular endothelial cells is undefined. The present study was conducted to investigate the effect of fluvastatin on cell proliferation and apoptosis in normoxic and hypoxic human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Flow cytometric analyses revealed that statins reversed hypoxia-induced cell proliferation by slowing down G1 to S transition and inducing cell apoptosis. To get further insights into the downstream effects of statins, we measured the expression of various apoptosis-associated proteins in hypoxic HUVEC using human apoptosis antibody array. The results suggested that cell apoptosis was accompanied by upregulation of caspase-3, p27, IGFBP-6 and a decrease of bcl-2, survivin levels. Subsequent studies confirmed the results of array and demonstrated that fluvastatin activated mitochondrial apoptosis through enhancing bax/bcl-2 ratio, releasing cytochrome c, in turn activating caspase-9 and caspase-3, and eventually cleaving PARP. Further experiments showed that inhibition of cell proliferation by fluvastatin was associated with elevated IGFBP-6, p27, p53 levels and reduced survivin, cyclin B1, cyclin D1 and VEGF expression. Taken together, fluvastatin suppressed cell proliferation and induced apoptosis of HUVEC in hypoxia via multiple signaling pathways, providing a theoretical basis for statins in the therapy of cancer.",

More research is needed in this area to better characterize potential statin-mediated mechanisms that affect cancer. Also, future studies should report patients' anatomic/prognostic stage based on the updated staging system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer, which is a more effective predictor of recurrence and mortality than anatomic stage alone.",

Although statins and fibrates have been reported to increase plasma PCSK9 levels, the effect of niacin on PCSK9 is unknown. We investigated the impact of niacin, atorvastatin, and fenofibrate on PCSK9 levels in 3 distinct studies. A statin-only study randomized 74 hypercholesterolemic patients to placebo, atorvastatin 10 mg/day, or atorvastatin 80 mg/day for 16 weeks. A dose-related increase in PCSK9 was noted such that atorvastatin 80 mg increased PCSK9 by a mean +27% (95% confidence interval [CI] +12 to +42), confirming the effect of statin therapy on raising PCSK9. A second study randomized 70 patients with carotid atherosclerosis to simvastatin 20 mg/day, simvastatin 80 mg/day, or simvastatin 20 mg/extended-release (ER) niacin 2 g/day. PCSK9 levels were increased with statin therapy, but decreased with the simvastatin 20 mg/ER niacin combination (mean -13%, CI -3 to -23). A final study involved 19 dyslipidemic participants on atorvastatin 10 mg with serial addition of fenofibric acid 135 mg followed by ER niacin 2 g/day. Fenofibric acid led to a +23% (CI +10 to +36, p = 0.001) increase in PCSK9; the addition of niacin resulted in a subsequent -17% decrease (CI -19 to -5, p = 0.004). A positive association was noted between change in PCSK9 and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (r = 0.62, p = 0.006) with the addition of niacin. In conclusion, niacin therapy offsets the increase in PCSK9 levels noted with statin and fibrate therapy. A portion of the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction seen with niacin therapy may be due to reduction in PCSK9.",

The 2013 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology prevention guidelines recommend that subjects with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) should be prescribed HPS therapy, irrespective of LDL-C levels. Previous guidelines recommend an LDL-C target <70 mg/dl. Patients diagnosed with ASCVD based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes with \u22651 LDL-C test from January 2004 to December 2012 were identified in the Optum Insight database. Patients were identified as treated if they received lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) within 90 days of the LDL-C measurement and untreated if they did not receive LLT treatment. LLT treated patients were stratified into HPS users or non-HPS LLT users. There were 45,101 eligible patients in 2004 and 40,846 in 2012. The proportion of high-risk patients who were treated with LLT increased from 61.4% (2004) to 70.5% (2008) then remained relatively constant until 2012 (67.9%). Mean LDL-C values in treated patients decreased from 103.7 \u00b1 32.1 (2004) to 90.8 \u00b1 31.4 mg/dl (2012). The proportion of patients treated with HPS increased from 13% in 2004 to 26% in 2012. Although the proportion of treated high-risk patients who achieve LDL-C <70 mg/dl levels has increased sharply from 2004, approximately 3 of 4 patients still did not meet this target. Only 1/4 of ASCVD patients are on HPS. In conclusion, our findings highlight the need for renewed efforts to support guideline-based LDL-C treatment for high-risk patients.",

It is fortunate that most of the effective lipid-lowering drugs, the statins, have become generic and inexpensive. However, there remains a large unmet medical need for new and effective agents that are also well tolerated and safe, especially for patients unable to either tolerate statins or achieve optimal LDL-C on current therapies.

    "199": "Lung cancer is characterized by a high mortality rate probably attributable to early metastasis. Oxidative stress is involved in development and progression of lung cancer, through cellular and molecular mechanisms which at least in part overlap with proinflammatory pathways. Simvastatin is a statin with pleiotropic effects that can also act as an anti-oxidant agent, and these pharmacologic properties may contribute to its potential anti-cancer activity. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate, in the human lung adenocarcinoma cell line GLC-82, the effects of a 24-hour treatment with simvastatin on hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)-induced changes in cell viability, ERK phosphorylation, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression, innate immunity signaling, NF-\u03baB activation and IL-8 secretion. Cell counting was performed after trypan blue staining, cell proliferation was assessed using MTT assay, and apoptosis was evaluated through caspase-3 activation and Tunel assay. Western blotting was used to analyze protein extracts, and IL-8 release into cell culture supernatants was assessed by ELISA. Our results show that simvastatin (30\u00a0\u03bcM) significantly (P <0.01) inhibited the proliferative effect of H2O2 (0.5\u00a0mM) and its stimulatory actions on ERK1/2 phosphorylation, NF-\u03baB activation and IL-8 production. Furthermore, simvastatin decreased H2O2-mediated induction of the cellular expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9, as well as of several components of the signaling complex activated by innate immune responses, including MyD88, TRAF2, TRAF6 and TRADD. In conclusion, these findings suggest that simvastatin could play a role in prevention and treatment of lung cancer via modulation of important proinflammatory and tumorigenic events promoted by oxidative stress.",

The objective of the study was to demonstrate the equivalent lipid-modifying efficacy of fixed-dose combination (FDC) ezetimibe/atorvastatin compared with the component agents co-administered individually in support of regulatory filing. Two randomized, 6-week, double-blind cross-over trials compared the lipid-modifying efficacy of ezetimibe/atorvastatin 10/20\u00a0mg (n\u00a0=\u00a0353) or 10/40\u00a0mg (n\u00a0=\u00a0280) vs. separate co-administration of ezetimibe 10\u00a0mg plus atorvastatin 20\u00a0mg (n\u00a0=\u00a0346) or 40\u00a0mg (n\u00a0=\u00a0280), respectively, in hypercholesterolemic patients. Percent changes from baseline in LDL-C (primary endpoint) and other lipids (secondary endpoints) were assessed by analysis of covariance; triglycerides were evaluated by longitudinal-data analysis. Expected differences between FDC and the corresponding co-administered doses were predicted from a dose-response relationship model; sample size was estimated given the expected difference and equivalence margins (\u00b14%). LDL-C-lowering equivalence was based on 97.5% expanded confidence intervals (CI) for the difference contained within the margins; equivalence margins for other lipids were not prespecified. Ezetimibe/atorvastatin FDC 10/20\u00a0mg was equivalent to co-administered ezetimibe+atorvastatin 20\u00a0mg in reducing LDL-C levels (54.0% vs. 53.8%) as was FDC 10/40\u00a0mg and ezetimibe+atorvastatin 40\u00a0mg (58.9% vs. 58.7%), as predicted by the model. Changes in other lipids were consistent with equivalence (97.5% expanded CIs <\u00b13%, included 0); triglyceride changes varied more. All treatments were generally well tolerated. Hypercholesterolemic patients administered ezetimibe/atorvastatin 10/20 and 10/40\u00a0mg FDC had equivalent LDL-C lowering. This FDC formulation proved to be an efficacious and generally well-tolerated lipid-lowering therapy.",

Here, we have designed a novel light-driven platform for cofactor-free, whole-cell P450 photo-biocatalysis using eosin\u2005Y (EY) as a photosensitizer. EY can easily enter into the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli and bind specifically to the heme domain of P450.

    "202": "Statin-associated myopathy (SAM) represents a broad spectrum of disorders from insignificant myalgia to fatal rhabdomyolysis. Its frequency ranges from 1-5 % in clinical trials to 15-20 % in everyday clinical practice. To a large extent, these variations can be explained by the definition used. Thus, we propose a scoring system to classify statin-induced myopathy according to clinical and biochemical criteria as 1) possible, 2) probable or 3) definite. The etiology of this disorder remains poorly understood. Most probably, an underlying genetic cause is necessary for overt SAM to develop. Variants in a few gene groups that encode proteins involved in: i) statin metabolism and distribution (e.g. membrane transporters and enzymes; OATP1B1, ABCA1, MRP, CYP3A4), ii) coenzyme Q10 production (e.g. COQ10A and B), iii) energy metabolism of muscle tissue (e.g. PYGM, GAA, CPT2) and several others have been proposed as candidates which can predispose to SAM. Pharmacological properties of individual statin molecules (e.g. lipophilicity, excretion pathways) and patients\u00b4 characteristics influence the likelihood of SAM development.

    "204": "The interaction between serum endostatin, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and predefined endpoints, including the primary endpoint (CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke; n = 397), all-cause mortality (n = 410), CV death (n = 335) or the coronary endpoint (n = 317), was evaluated in 1,390 patients >60 years of age with ischemic systolic HF in the Controlled Rosuvastatin Multinational Trial in HF (CORONA) population, who were randomly assigned to 10 mg rosuvastatin or placebo.", 
    "205": "In the population as a whole, endostatin added no predictive information after full multivariable adjustment including eGFR and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide. Serum endostatin was strongly correlated with eGFR (r = 0.59, p < 0.001). After full multivariable adjustment, an association between high serum endostatin and increased risk of all-cause mortality and decreased risk of the primary and coronary endpoints was seen in HF patients with impaired and preserved renal function, respectively.", 
    "206": "Endostatin added no predictive information regarding the adverse outcome in patients with chronic systolic HF of ischemic etiology. An increased risk of all-cause mortality was seen in patients with decreased renal function.", 
    "207": "Nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) is a key regulator of systematic inflammation in atherosclerosis (AS). The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine/threonine protein kinase, has emerged as an important regulator of chronic inflammation. However, the relationship between mTOR and NF-\u03baB remains poorly defined. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of mTOR in the pro-inflammatory pathway of human monocytes (HMCs) in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and to determine the interaction between mTOR and NF-\u03baB signalling in the inflammatory state. HMCs were isolated from fasting blood samples of 68 patients with CAD and 59 subjects without CAD (non-CAD) to test the activity of NF-\u03baB, p65 nuclear translocation and mTOR phosphorylation, which were all significantly elevated in the CAD group compared with those in the non-CAD group. The concentrations of serum interleukin (IL)-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 were higher in the CAD group than in the non-CAD group. In an in\u00a0vitro experiment, HMCs isolated from non-CAD subjects were used as culture model and were treated with sera extracted from CAD patients (CAD sera) or non-CAD subjects (con sera). CAD sera induced time-dependent phosphorylation of mTOR, aberrant NF-\u03baB activation, as well as up-regulation of inflammatory factors. Moreover, inhibition of mTOR by pharmacological or genetic means abolished the CAD sera-triggered NF-\u03baB activation and pro-inflammatory response. Furthermore, lipid-lowering drug statins partly blocked the CAD sera-activated mTOR and pro-inflammatory response. Our results show that CAD patients are in the pro-inflammatory state with increased NF-\u03baB binding activity and enhanced mTOR phosphorylation. We also found that the activation of mTOR is required for the pro-inflammatory response via NF-\u03baB-dependent pathway in HMCs, which unveils the underlying mechanism of AS and potential strategies to attenuate AS in clinical practice.", 
    "208": "Type 1 diabetes has been associated with an elevated relative risk (RR) of mortality compared to the general population. To review published studies on the RR of mortality of Type 1 diabetes patients compared to the general population, we conducted a meta-analysis and examined the temporal changes in the RR of mortality over time.", 
    "209": "Systematic review of studies reporting RR of mortality for Type 1 diabetes compared to the general population. We conducted meta-analyses using a DerSimonian and Laird random effects model to obtain the average effect and the distribution of RR estimates. Sub-group meta-analyses and multivariate meta-regression analysis was performed to examine heterogeneity. Summary RR with 95% CIs was calculated using a random-effects model.", 
    "210": "26 studies with a total of 88 subpopulations were included in the meta-analysis and overall RR of mortality was 3.82 (95% CI 3.41, 3.4.29) compared to the general population. Observations using data prior to 1971 had a much larger estimated RR (5.80 (95% CI 4.20, 8.01)) when compared to: data between; 1971 and 1980 (5.06 (95% CI 3.44, 7.45)); 1981-90 (3.59 (95% CI 3.15, 4.09)); and those after 1990 (3.11 (95% CI 2.47, 3.91)); suggesting mortality of Type 1 diabetes patients when compared to the general population have been improving over time. Similarly, females (4.54 (95% CI 3.79-5.45)) had a larger RR estimate when compared to males (3.25 (95% CI 2.82-3.73) and the meta-regression found evidence for temporal trends and sex (p<0.01) accounting for heterogeneity between studies.", 
    "211": "Type 1 diabetes patients' mortality has declined at a faster rate than the general population. However, the largest relative improvements have occurred prior to 1990. Emphasis on intensive blood glucose control alongside blood pressure control and statin therapy may translate into further reductions in mortality in coming years.", 
    "212": "Chronic therapy with statins, antihypertensive and antiplatelet drugs is one of the most important interventions for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Adherence to drug treatment is key to successful therapeutic intervention, especially in chronic conditions. This holds particularly true in the setting of cardiovascular diseases, because poor adherence may have serious adverse effects in terms of morbidity and mortality. Many factors may contribute to poor adherence, which can be either patient-related or dependent on the healthcare system, the physician and the environment. The identification and appropriate correction of these factors may result in both clinical and economic benefits. In this setting it is also important to assess the implications of the increasing use of generic or equivalent drugs on adherence to pharmacological therapy."
