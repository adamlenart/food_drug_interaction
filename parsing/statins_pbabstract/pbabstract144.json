    "0": "The effect of a statin-based medical intervention on prevention of fatal and non-fatal stroke recurrence and the incidence of all-causes mortality have been explored previously in aging populations within the scope of clinical trials research. However, such evidence needs to be explored under conditions of routine clinical practice. The objective of this study was to determine whether statin therapy in patients with a first stroke episode reduces the incidence of 6-year recurrent fatal or non-fatal stroke and all-cause mortality in an aging Mediterranean population without known coronary heart disease followed in routine medical practice.", 
    "1": "A retrospective study was carried out using records on death, hospitalizations owing to stroke and history of statin therapy included in the Badalona Serveis Assistencials (BSA) database. The cohort studied consisted of consecutive patients covered by the BSA health provider plan with a first-ever acute stroke episode during January 2003 until December 2008, for whom there was available information covering the 6-year follow-up period. Recurrence rate (RR) and incidence rate (IR) of fatal/non-fatal stroke and all-causes mortality were computed. Association with statin therapy was assessed by means of calculation of relative risk (RR) and hazard ratio (HR) using multivariate logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards models controlling for confounding covariates.", 
    "2": "The cohort comprised a series of 601 consecutive patients [57% men, 75\u00b79 (12\u00b74) years old (88% >60 years)]. Of these, 32% received statins, which were associated with lower fatal/non-fatal recurrent stroke RR; 7% vs. 18% [adjusted RR=0\u00b732 (CI: 0\u00b716-0\u00b761), P=0\u00b7001] and lower IR; 16\u00b778 vs. 45\u00b722 events/year-1000 subjects [adjusted HR=0\u00b735 (0\u00b719-0\u00b764), P=0\u00b7001]. Similarly, observed all-causes mortality was lower in the cohort receiving statins; 11% vs. 16% [adjusted RR=0\u00b729 (CI: 0\u00b708-1\u00b712), P=0\u00b7072], and also mortality rate; 26\u00b709 vs. 36\u00b725 deaths/year-1000 subjects [adjusted HR=0\u00b723 (0\u00b708-0\u00b767), P=0\u00b7007].",

    "4": "Although considered promising for use in drug-eluting stents (DES), tacrolimus failed clinically. Tacrolimus inhibits growth factor production but can also act as a growth factor on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). This unexpected proliferative stimulus could reverse the beneficial effects of the drug on restenosis. We hypothesized that tacrolimus' association with statins, which lower cholesterol and impair cell proliferation, could restore tacrolimus' beneficial effect by abrogating the aberrant proliferative stimulus. Additionally, since maintenance of endothelial function represents a challenge for new-generation DES, we investigated the combined effect of tacrolimus and atorvastatin on endothelial cells. Human VSMC and umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were incubated with 100 nM tacrolimus and increasing doses of atorvastatin (0-3.0 \u03bcM). Atorvastatin plus tacrolimus dose-dependently inhibited VSMC proliferation. The percentage of cells incorporating 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) in their DNA was 49 \u00b1 14% under basal conditions, 62 \u00b1 15% (P = 0.01) with tacrolimus, 40 \u00b1 22% with 3 \u03bcM atorvastatin, and 30 \u00b1 7% (P < 0.05) with 3 \u03bcM atorvastatin plus tacrolimus. Atorvastatin downregulated \u03b2-catenin, Erk1 and Erk2, and cyclin B in tacrolimus-stimulated VSMC. In contrast, atorvastatin plus tacrolimus did not affect proliferation of endothelial cells. The percentage of HUVEC incorporating BrdU in their DNA was 47 \u00b1 8% under basal conditions, 58 \u00b1 6% (P = 0.01) with tacrolimus, 45 \u00b1 4% with 3 \u03bcM atorvastatin, and 49 \u00b1 1% with 3 \u03bcM atorvastatin plus tacrolimus. Both agents stimulated endoglin production by HUVEC. Taken together, these results suggest that, when combined with tacrolimus, atorvastatin exerts a dose-dependent antiproliferative effect on VSMC. In contrast, atorvastatin acts in concert with tacrolimus in HUVEC to stimulate production of endoglin, a factor that has an important role in endothelial repair. Our study supports the conclusion that prevention of postcoronary in-stent restenosis and late thrombosis may benefit of concomitant association of tacrolimus and high doses of atorvastatin.", 
    "5": "Atherosclerosis is a major cause of cardiovascular disease caused by high cholesterol. Stains are widely prescribed to lower cholesterol levels, but natural dietary compounds may also be effective. Therefore, we studied the effect of the natural dietary compound curcumin on atherosclerosis and its underlying mechanisms based on plasma and hepatic lipid metabolism.", 
    "6": "LDLR(-/-) mice were fed a high-cholesterol diet and treated with curcumin, lovastatin or control (n=10 per group) for 18\u2009wk. Aortic arch sections revealed curcumin ameliorated early atherosclerotic lesions, lipid infiltration, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 localization, similar to lovastatin treatment. Furthermore, curcumin lowered plasma cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol and Apo B levels as well as CETP activity, while curcumin increased plasma HDL cholesterol and liver Apo A-I expression, similar to lovastatin treatment. Curcumin caused transcriptional inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, independent of ACAT1 and ACAT2 expression. Hepatic PPAR\u03b1 and LXR\u03b1 expression was upregulated by curcumin treatment. Hepatic complement factor D (Cfd) and systemic CRP levels, markers of immune complement pathway activation, were significantly reduced by curcumin treatment.", 
    "7": "Long-term curcumin treatment lowers plasma and hepatic cholesterol and suppresses early atherosclerotic lesions comparable to the protective effects of lovastatin. The anti-atherogenic effect of curcumin is mediated via multiple mechanisms including altered lipid, cholesterol and immune gene expression.", 
    "8": "Simvastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, has been known to reduce cholesterol biosynthesis. However, recent studies demonstrate that simvastatin shows diverse cholesterol-independent functions including cellular differentiation. In this study, we investigated the stimulatory effect of simvastatin on the osteogenic differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). The osteogenic effect of simvastatin was observed at relatively low doses (ranging from 1 nM to 200 nM). Incubation of ESCs in simvastatin-supplemented osteogenic medium significantly increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity at day 7. The matrix mineralization was also augmented and demonstrated pivotal levels after 14 days incubation of simvastatin. Osteogenic differentiation of ESCs by simvastatin was determined by upregulation of the mRNA expression of runtrelated gene 2 (Runx2), osterix (OSX), and osteocalcin (OCN) as osteogenic transcription factors. Moreover, the increased protein expression of OCN, osteopontin (OPN), and collagen type I (Coll I) was assessed using Western blot analysis and immunocytochemistry. However, the blockage of canonical Wnt signaling by DKK-1 downregulated simvastatin-induced ALP activity and the mRNA expression of each osteogenic transcription factor. Furthermore, the \u03b2-catenin specific siRNA transfection decreased the protein levels of OCN, OPN, and Coll I. Collectively, these findings suggest that simvastatin enhances the differentiation of ESCs toward osteogenic lineage through activation of canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling.", 
    "9": "Postprandial oxidative stress is characterized by an increased susceptibility of the organism towards oxidative damage after consumption of a meal rich in lipids and/or carbohydrates. We have investigated whether the quality of dietary fat alters postprandial gene expression and protein levels involved in oxidative stress and whether the supplementation with coenzyme Q(10) (CoQ) improves this situation in an elderly population. Twenty participants were randomized to receive three isocaloric diets each for 4\u00a0weeks: Mediterranean diet supplemented with CoQ (Med\u2009+\u2009CoQ diet), Mediterranean diet (Med diet), saturated fatty acid-rich diet (SFA diet). After 12-h fast, volunteers consumed a breakfast with a fat composition similar to that consumed in each of the diets. Nrf2, p22(phox) and p47(phox), superoxide dismutase 1 and 2 (SOD1 and SOD2), glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPx1), thiorredoxin reductase (TrxR) gene expression and Kelch-like ECH associating protein 1 (Keap-1) and citoplasmic and nuclear Nrf2 protein levels were determined. Med and Med\u2009+\u2009CoQ diets induced lower Nrf2, p22(phox), p47(phox), SOD1, SOD2 and TrxR gene expression and higher cytoplasmic Nrf2 and Keap-1 protein levels compared to the SFA diet. Moreover, Med\u2009+\u2009CoQ diet produced lower postprandial Nrf2 gene expression and lower nuclear Nrf2 protein levels compared to the other diets and lower GPx1 gene expression than the SFA diet. Our results support the antioxidant effect of a Med diet and that exogenous CoQ supplementation has a protective effects against free radical overgeneration through the lowering of postprandial oxidative stress modifying the postprandial antioxidant protein levels and reducing the postprandial expression of antioxidant genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.",

This phase I trial evaluated the pharmacokinetic (PK) and drug-drug interactions of bexarotene with chemotherapy and a lipid-lowering agent (atorvastatin or fenofibrate). This trial was run in parallel with phase III trials of the combinations to determine whether repeated doses of bexarotene capsules affect the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the chemotherapeutic or the lipid-lowering agents.", 
    "11": "Patients (n\u00a0=\u00a048) with advanced non-small cell lung cancer were treated with repetitive cycles of either paclitaxel/carboplatin or cisplatin/vinorelbine chemotherapy, bexarotene (400\u00a0mg/m(2)/day) administered continuously starting on day 4 of chemotherapy, and a lipid-lowering drug, either atorvastatin or fenofibrate, starting at least 5\u00a0days before chemotherapy due to hypertriglyceridemia induced by bexarotene. Extensive plasma sampling to characterize the PK profiles of the lipid-lowering drugs, relevant chemotherapy agents was performed on day 1 (without bexarotene) and during chemotherapy cycles 2 or 3 (with bexarotene).", 
    "12": "Here, we report the drug-drug interactions between the lipid-lowering agents and bexarotene. Mean atorvastatin clearance and dose-corrected AUC values were reduced by nearly 50% with the addition of concomitant bexarotene. As fenofibrate was less effective at controlling hypertriglyceridemia, too few patients received this agent to make any meaningful conclusions about drug-drug interactions.", 
    "13": "A drug-drug interaction was seen in this trial with bexarotene co-administration leading to a significant reduction in the AUC of atorvastatin. The likely mechanism for this interaction is through induction of CYP3A4 by bexarotene given the role of this enzyme in the metabolism of atorvastatin. Knowledge of this interaction is important for optimizing lipid management with atorvastatin for patients receiving bexarotene.", 
    "14": "We conducted an open-label trial to evaluate whether simvastatin therapy was, or was not, associated in systemic sclerosis hypercholesterolemic patients (SSc-Ps) with beneficial changes in finger skin microvascular function. 13 females SSc-Ps and 15 females healthy control subjects (CSs), age-matched with SSc-Ps, underwent finger skin post-occlusive reactive hyperaemia (PORH), using laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF). This test was repeated in SSc-Ps after about 10 weeks of simvastatin (20 mg/day) therapy (ST). At baseline and after ST, finger skin vasomotion was evaluated using spectral Fourier analysis of the LDF tracings. Endothelin-1 and cholesterol serum levels were also determined in SSc-Ps at baseline and after ST. At baseline, SSc-Ps had significantly lower basal finger skin blood flow (basal flow) and PORH, compared to CSs (18.9 \u00b1 11.7 PU vs. 28.5 \u00b1 17.5 PU, 58.6 \u00b1 31.0 PU vs. 93. 1 \u00b1 37.3; P < 0.05). After ST, SSc-Ps had a significant increase in basal flow and PORH compared to baseline (42.7 \u00b1 35.7 PU vs. 18.9 \u00b1 11.7 PU, 111.0 \u00b1 66.6 PU vs. 58.6 \u00b1 31.0 PU, respectively; P < 0.05), as well as a significant reduction in endothelin-1, total- and LDL-cholesterol serum levels. After ST, SSc-Ps also showed a partially restored post-ischaemic amplification in finger skin blood flow oscillations within 0.06-0.6 Hz, related to myogenic vasomotion. This study showed that a short time period of ST in hypercholesterolemic SSc-Ps resulted in increased finger skin vasoreactivity and in partially restored post-ischaemic amplification of finger skin vasomotion, suggesting that ST affects positively finger skin microvascular dysfunction in SSc-Ps.",

Patients with in-hospital stroke were older than patients without stroke and were more likely to be female (36 vs. 18.6%, p = 0.0033). They were also more likely to have diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, prior AMI, or percutaneous/surgical coronary revascularization. Patients with stroke were more likely to present with advanced Killip class II-IV, higher mean heart rate and higher serum creatinine. Independent predictors of stroke were age, prior stroke, prior coronary artery bypass surgery, anterior AMI and systolic blood pressure >190 mm Hg on presentation. Early administration of statins was independently associated with reduced stroke risk (odds ratio, OR, 0.4, 95% confidence interval, CI, 0.19-0.90, p = 0.025). Stroke was fatal in 44% of the cases and was independently associated with in-hospital mortality (adjusted OR 12.5, 95% CI 5.7-27.4, p < 0.01).",

    "19": "The aim of this study was to determine the influence of acute (single) and chronic (once daily for 7 consecutive days) treatments with atorvastatin and fluvastatin on the anticonvulsant potential of three antiepileptic drugs: carbamazepine, phenytoin and valproate in the mouse maximal electroshock-induced seizure model. Additionally, the effects of acute and chronic administration of both statins on the adverse effect potential of three antiepileptic drugs were assessed in the chimney test (motor performance) and passive avoidance task (long-term memory). To evaluate the pharmacokinetic characteristics of interaction between antiepileptic drugs and statins, the total brain concentrations of antiepileptic drugs were estimated with the fluorescence polarization immunoassay technique. Results indicate that atorvastatin at doses up to 80mg/kg in chronic experiment attenuated the anticonvulsant potential of carbamazepine by increasing its ED(50) value against maximal electroconvulsions. Acute fluvastatin (80mg/kg) enhanced the anticonvulsant potential of carbamazepine and valproate by decreasing their ED(50) values. Acute fluvastatin (80mg/kg) also markedly increased the total brain carbamazepine concentration by 61% in a pharmacokinetic reaction. Atorvastatin (acute and chronic) and fluvastatin (chronic) in combinations with valproate impaired long-term memory in mice. Both statins in combinations with all three antiepileptic drugs had no impact on their adverse effects in the chimney test. Based on this preclinical study, one can conclude that chronic administration of atorvastatin reduces the anticonvulsant action of carbamazepine and acute fluvastatin can enhance the anticonvulsant potency of the carbamazepine and valproate. The former interaction was pharmacokinetic in nature.",

An extended treatment period at low concentrations was associated with a 2-3 fold increase and the increase of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 was more prominent under high concentration. Results of immunoblotting confirmed an increase in the abundance of ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and MCP-1. No significant change was noted in E-selectin and AT1R according to concentration or treatment duration.

In addition to the direct effects of statins in reducing concentrations of atherogenic low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), several studies have indicated that the beneficial effects of statins may be due to some of their cholesterol-independent, multiple (pleiotropic) effects which may differ between different members of the class. Pitavastatin is a novel synthetic lipophilic statin that has a number of pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties distinct from those of other statins, which may underlie its potential pleiotropic benefits in reducing cardiovascular risk factors. This review examines the principal pleiotropic effects of pitavastatin on endothelial function, vascular inflammation, oxidative stress and thrombosis. The article is based on a systematic literature search carried out in December 2010, together with more recent relevant publications where appropriate. The available data from clinical trials and in vitro and animal studies suggest that pitavastatin is not only effective in reducing LDL-C and triglycerides, but also has a range of other effects. These include increasing high density lipoprotein cholesterol, decreasing markers of platelet activation, improving cardiac, renal and endothelial function, and reducing endothelial stress, lipoprotein oxidation and, ultimately, improving the signs and symptoms of atherosclerosis. It is concluded that the diverse pleiotropic actions of pitavastatin may contribute to reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality beyond that achieved through LDL-C reduction.", 
    "35": "Recently, it was reported that the administration of statins (lipid-lowering drugs) is associated with reduced levels of testosterone, and this evidence has opened a debate on the consequences these widely used drugs might have on the quality of erection. This is a very important clinical problem because patients with dyslipidemia are at increased risk of developing erectile dysfunction (ED); hence, statins exert a protective effect. At the same time, the administration of these drugs reduce endothelial dysfunction, a key etiopathogenetic factor in the onset of ED. Moreover, statins are universally considered a key element of secondary prevention for vascular events; therefore, several points are opened. In this critical summary, we attempt to evaluate the effects of statins on ED and to understand the mechanisms through which statins improve the quality of erection and the possible synergism with V phosphodiesterase inhibitors, drugs largely used for the treatment of ED.",

Large trials have provided the justification for operative treatment besides medical treatment in patients with recent significant carotid artery stenosis two decades ago. Since then, medical therapy has evolved tremendously. Next to aspirin, antiplatelet regimens acting on a different level in the modulation of platelet aggregation have made their entry. Moreover, statin therapy has been introduced. These changes among others in secondary stroke prevention, along with better understanding in life-style adjustments and perioperative medical management, have led to a decrease in stroke recurrence. Secondary prevention is therefore now the most important pillar of medical therapy. It consists of antiplatelet therapy, statins and blood pressure lowering agents in all patients.

Impaired wound healing is a common problem that occurs in both community and hospital settings. Various experimental and clinical studies have evaluated different modalities for the treatment of topical wounds, such as sugar, antibiotics, honey and phytotherapies; also statins have diverse pleiotropic effects that have been suggested to be useful to improve wound healing. Data derived from both animal and human studies showed that statins especially atorvastatin, simvastatin and pravastatin can accelerate the wound-healing process.

Using a decision-analytic model, trial CVD event rates were combined with epidemiological and cost data specific for Sweden.

Some secondary CVD outcomes were benefited as were some secondary microvascular outcomes by the more aggressive treatments.

The driving force behind atherogenic dyslipidaemia is hypertriglyceridaemia, which results from hepatic oversecretion and/or hypocatabolism of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, and is typical of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Persistent atherogenic dyslipidaemia in patients treated with a statin according to low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol goals may be corrected with niacin, fibrates or n-3 fatty acids. Clinical trial evidence to inform best practice is limited, but new data support adding fenofibrate to a statin. A consistent feature of fibrate clinical trials is the specific benefit of these agents in dyslipidaemic patients and the improvement in diabetic retinopathy with fenofibrate. Ongoing clinical trials may provide good evidence for adding niacin to a statin. Low-dose n-3 fatty acids could be used routinely after a myocardial infarction, but the value of higher doses of n-3 fatty acids in reducing CVD risk remains to be demonstrated.",

This paper explores the possibility that early implementation of a drug-based approach to the prevention of atherosclerosis and atherothrombotic events could dramatically reduce the footprint of this disease.

Many practicing physicians believe that statin doses are lower in Asians because of the generally lower bodyweight and BMI. Whether this belief is based on sound scientific evidence needs to be reviewed. Furthermore, since the decision of optimal dose is based on both efficacy and safety, both of which may be impacted by genetic factors, one may ask whether pharmacogenetics plays a role in the dose difference, if such a difference exists.

Genetic polymorphisms in drug transporters as well as drug-metabolizing enzymes are associated with interindividual differences in drug disposition, efficacy and toxicity. Organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1, gene SLCO1B1) is expressed on the basolateral membrane of hepatocytes and can facilitate hepatic uptake of certain clinically relevant drugs such as statins except for fluvastatin, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor antagonists, antidiabetic drug (repaglinide) and anticancer drugs (SN-38 and methotrexate). Some single nucleotide polymorphisms or haplotypes of the SLCO1B1 gene have been identified and demonstrated to have functional significance for transporter activity. For examples, the SLCO1B1*15 haplotype (or 521T>C genotype) results in decreased uptake activity of SN-38 from systemic circulation, leading to increased plasma concentration of SN-38 and an enhanced risk of neutropenia. This review focuses on the impact of genetic polymorphisms of the SLCO1B1 gene on transport activity, and implications for the clinical efficacy and toxicity of clinically useful drugs.",

It is unclear, however, whether statins could have direct effects against prostate cancer in a clinical setting, as their growth-inhibiting effects on prostate cancer cells have been demonstrated at drug concentrations which exceed the level in plasma during standard clinical dosing. We compared responses to high-dose and therapeutic-dose simvastatin in normal and cancerous prostate epithelial cells. Simvastatin was more effective at inhibiting the growth of normal prostate epithelial cells than of cancer cells. At therapeutic 100 nM concentration simvastatin had a cytostatic effect on normal cells: apoptosis was only slightly induced, but a decrease in cell cycle activity and an increase in senescence were observed. At therapeutic concentrations, lipophilic simvastatin caused a stronger growth inhibition than did hydrophilic rosuvastatin. In contrast, 10 \u03bcM simvastatin had a cytotoxic effect both on normal and cancer cells. Addition of LDL-cholesterol effectively reversed the cytostatic effect in all cell lines, but overcoming the cytotoxicity of 10 \u03bcM simvastatin required a combination of LDL-cholesterol and mevalonate. As LDL-cholesterol completely prevented the growth-inhibiting effect of therapeutic-dose simvastatin already at low, subphysiological concentrations it is unlikely that statins have direct effects on growth of prostate epithelial cells in vivo. Statins' possible benefits against prostate cancer could be due to systemic cholesterol-lowering, as suggested by epidemiological studies. Future clinical studies evaluating the effects of statins on prostate cancer prevention should monitor serum LDL and should probably administer statins at higher concentrations than those currently used in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "87": "Inhibition of Rho kinase (ROCK) ameliorates many cardiovascular dysfunctions. The aim of the current study is to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of fasudil, a selective ROCK inhibitor, on high cholesterol diet-induced hypercholesterolemic rats and its possible mechanisms. In hypercholesterolemic rats, we found the serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and several inflammatory markers including interleukin (IL)-8, IL-6, C-reaction protein (CRP) and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule (sICAM)-1 significantly elevated, while those of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglyceride (TG) decreased. Moreover, mRNA expressions of ROCK and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and activity of ROCK in thoracic aorta were greatly up-regulated. Remarkably, administrating fasudil (10, 30 mg/kg per day) or simvastatin (10 mg/kg per day) to hypercholesterolemic rats for 2 weeks, activation of ROCK and NF-\u03baB in thoracic aorta were suppressed, status of dyslipidemia were improved and inflammatory markers lowered. From the histopathological examination, fasudil treatment was found to lessen the thickening noted in the aortic intima and media of the hypercholesterolemic rats. These results suggested fasudil-induced inhibition of ROCK may improve lipid metabolism and has anti-inflammatory effect, which might expand the clinical application of fasudil as a new therapy for hypercholesterolemia and preventing the development of atherosclerosis.", 
    "88": "Ascending aortic dilation commonly occurs in patients with bicuspid aortic valve (BAV). Statins have been shown to reduce the expression of matrix metalloproteinases and slow the progression of abdominal aortic aneurysms. The role of statins in slowing ascending aortic dilation in patients with BAV is unknown. We sought to compare the ascending aortic dimensions in patients with BAV stenosis treated with versus without a statin. From our catheterization laboratory database, all patients undergoing preoperative coronary angiography before aortic valve with or without ascending aorta replacement for bicuspid aortic stenosis (AS) from 2004 to 2007 were identified. The ascending aortic size was measured on their preoperative transesophageal echocardiogram. Data on statin use were obtained from chart review, and the ascending aortic size was compared between patients taking and not taking a statin. The study sample included 147 patients, of whom 76 were treated with statins (mean age 62 \u00b1 9 years, 72% men) and 71 were not (mean age 59 \u00b1 12 years, 68% men). The total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels were significantly lower in the statin group. The ascending aorta size was significantly lower in the statin subgroup of the pure severe AS group (3.6 \u00b1 0.7 cm vs 3.9 \u00b1 0.6 cm, p < 0.01) but not in the mixed severe AS and severe aortic regurgitation group. In the pure severe AS group, significantly fewer patients taking a statin had an ascending aorta \u2265 4 cm (29% vs 52%, p < 0.02). On multivariate analysis, statin use was the only independent predictor of aortic size and was associated with a 0.33-cm reduction in aortic size (95% confidence interval 0.06 to 0.59, p < 0.01). In conclusion, patients with statin-treated BAV stenosis have a smaller ascending aortic size than patients with BAV untreated with statins.", 
    "89": "Despite substantial progress in the characterization and pharmacological treatment of risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD), residual cardiovascular risk represents a challenge to an effective CVD primary and secondary prevention. A multifactorial approach aimed at controlling all risk factors present in each individual patient is of paramount importance to effectively reduce the risk of CV events. While aggressive as compared to conventional LDL-cholesterol lowering provides further CV events reduction in secondary prevention patients, significant residual cardiovascular risk remains even after intensive statin therapy and an LDL-C levels of <70\u00a0mg/dL. Combination lipid-lowering strategies with a statin and fenofibrate or a statin and nicotinic acid may provide significant residual CV risk reduction in selected subgroups of patients (i.e. patients with diabetes on statin therapy and persistently low HDL-C and/or high triglycerides). Intensive risk factor management approaches aimed at controlling plasma LDL-C, glucose metabolism and blood pressure may significantly reduce residual CV risk; they should however be implemented based on individual cardiovascular risk profiles and clinical phenotypes, following the footsteps of personalized medicine.", 
    "90": "A number of epidemiological studies and intervention clinical trials demonstrated that the in spite of the achievement of recommended targets of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol in subjects not yet affected by cardiovascular diseases, a substantial percentage of them still remain at risk of acute events. Beyond LDL-c, additional abnormalities of lipid profile, consisting of low high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and high levels of triglycerides or the combination of the two, may play a role in determining the cardiovascular prognosis. The mentioned lipid abnormalities, together with elevated apolipoprotein B and non-HDL cholesterol, do represent the burden of the so-called residual cardiovascular risk of lipid nature. Although it is plausible that there is benefit in normalizing lipid abnormalities other than LDL-C in primary prevention, it is still controversial that this actually reduces clinical events. Recent attempts to further reduce the risk of patients already given statin therapy with drugs raising HDL-c or lowering triglycerides levels failed to demonstrate a favorable impact on secondary prevention. Of importance, evidence is completely lacking for people at lower risk such as those requiring primary prevention. New and more safe/effective drugs are currently under investigation in this field. Until further information is available on the efficacy and safety of interventions aimed at restoring normal levels of triglycerides and HDL, we have to continue to implement safe and effective methods we already have to blunt the cardiovascular risk, consisting mainly of lifestyle changes and statin therapy.", 
    "91": "Residual cardiovascular risk can be defined as the residual risk of incident vascular events or progression of established vascular damage persisting in patients treated with current evidence-based recommended care including the risk that established from risk factors, such as dyslipidemia, high blood pressure, and the risk related to emerging or newer risk factors. The concept clearly derives from intervention trials, mainly the statin trials, and there is a lot of debate about the residual risk conferred by other lipid components, in particular low levels of HDL cholesterol and high levels of triglycerides. A meta-analysis of 53 fibrates (16,802 subjects) and 30 niacin trials (4,749 subjects) revealed an average HDL-C increase of 10% with fibrates and 16% with niacin, a triglyceride decrease of 36% with fibrates and 20% with niacin, and a LDL-C decrease of 8% with fibrates and 14% with niacin. These lipid changes resulted in similar overall reductions in major coronary events evidenced by a 25% decrease with fibrates and 27% with niacin. However, recent analyses of the primary and secondary prevention trials like JUPITER, Treating to New Targets (TNT) and PROVE-IT TIMI 22 force to reconsider the issue. In these three trials, HDL-C was useful in the initial risk assessment but when LDL-C was aggressively lowered the residual risk predictive value of HDL-C was markedly attenuated. Also epidemiological studies evaluate the residual risk in treated hypertensives and dyslipidemic subjects within a general population. The PRIME study in Northern Ireland and France and the Progetto CUORE study in Italy, both with a 10-year follow-up were able to test the hypothesis of the residual cardiovascular risk in treated hypertensives, because the proportion of treated dyslipidemic subjects was too low at baseline. In both studies treatment with antihypertensive agents was associated with a sizeable residual cardiovascular risk with the hazard ratio of 1.5-1.7, suggesting that more efficient risk reduction strategies in hypertension should be developed as a priority. In conclusion residual cardiovascular risk should be better studied in cardiovascular epidemiology, refining the methods to evaluate it, to consider measures of exposure to the modifiable risk factors and indicators of treatment (both at pharmacological and lifestyle level) over the time. Repeated measures and cohortal follow-up are needed and also new statistical methods are necessary to evaluate the residual risk to understand how to reduce it.", 
    "92": "Radiotherapy (RT) plays a key role in cancer treatment. Although the benefit of ionizing radiation (IR) is well established, some findings raise the possibility that irradiation of the primary tumor not only triggers a killing response but also increases the metastatic potential of surviving tumor cells. Here we addressed the question of whether irradiation of normal cells outside of the primary tumor augments metastasis by stimulating the extravasation of circulating tumor cells. We show that IR exposure of human endothelial cells (EC), tumor cells (TC) or both increases TC-EC adhesion in vitro. IR-stimulated TC-EC adhesion was blocked by the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin. Glycyrrhizic acid from liquorice root, which acts as a Sialyl-Lewis X mimetic drug, and the Rac1 inhibitor NSC23766 also reduced TC-EC adhesion. To examine the in vivo relevance of these findings, tumorigenic cells were injected into the tail vein of immunodeficient mice followed by total body irradiation (TBI). The data obtained show that TBI dramatically enhances tumor cell extravasation and lung metastasis. This pro-metastatic radiation effect was blocked by pre-treating mice with lovastatin, glycyrrhizic acid or NSC23766. TBI of mice prior to tumor cell transplantation also stimulated metastasis, which was again blocked by lovastatin. The data point to a pro-metastatic trans-effect of RT, which likely rests on the endothelial radiation response promoting the extravasation of circulating tumor cells. Administration of the widely used lipid-lowering drug lovastatin prior to irradiation counteracts this process, likely by suppressing Rac1-regulated E-selectin expression following irradiation. The data support the concern that radiation exposure might increase the extravasation of circulating tumor cells and recommend co-administration of lipid-lowering drugs to avoid this adverse effect of ionizing radiation.", 
    "93": "This study reports the results of an investigation of the phototoxicity mechanism induced by pitavastatin and its photoproducts, namely 6-cyclopropyl-10-fluoro-7,8-dihydrobenzo[k]phenanthridine (PP3) and 6-cyclopropyl-10-fluorobenzo[k]phenanthridine (PP4). The phototoxicity was tested in human keratinocytes cell lines NCTC-2544, and the results proved that under the same conditions, all three compounds exhibited phototoxic effects in the model tested. The reduction in cell viability was found to be both concentration- and UVA dose-dependent. A point of note is that both the photoproducts produced a dramatic decrease in cell viability with GI(50) values one order of magnitude lower compared to the parent compound. In particular, the fully aromatic derivative (PP4) showed the highest antiproliferative activity. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that pitavastatin and the photoproduct PP4 principally induced necrosis, as revealed by the large appearance of propidium iodide-positive cells and also confirmed by the rapid drop in cellular ATP levels. Further studies committed to better understanding of photoinduced cell death mechanism(s) revealed that neither pitavastatin nor PP4 induced mitochondrial depolarization or lysosomal damage, but, interestingly, extensive cell lipid membrane peroxidation along with a significant oxidation of model proteins occurred, suggesting that pitavastatin and PP4 exert their phototoxic effect mainly in the cellular membranes. The present results suggest that the phototoxicity of pitavastatin may be mediated by the formation of benzophenanthridine-like photoproducts that appear to have high potential as photosensitizers.", 
    "94": "Simvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that are independent of lipid-lowering abilities. This experiment was carried out to explore the effects of simvastatin on apoptosis in vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques of apoE-deficient mice.", 
    "95": "Eight weeks-old apoE(-/-) mice were fed a Western-type diet. Vulnerable atherosclerotic lesions were formed in the branchiocephalic artery at the age of 30-weeks, before simvastatin administration for 8\u00a0weeks. Simvastatin did neither affect the levels of plasma glucose and lipids, nor the size of atherosclerotic lesions. Analysis of plaque composition showed that simvastatin decreased the area of lipid core and increased the amounts of macrophages and smooth muscle cells in atherosclerotic plaques of apoE(-/-) mice. In addition, simvastatin down-regulated the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) by both inhibition of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u043aB) activation and suppression of the expression of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE). Moreover, we found that simvastatin administration led to reduced TUNEL-positive cells in the aortic root lesions, accompanied by up-regulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression, and decreased P(53) expression as shown by Western blot.", 
    "96": "In the present study, we show novel data to suggest that simvastatin could suppress apoptosis in vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques of apoE(-/-) mice by regulating the expression of apoptosis-related proteins, such as p(53), Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL.", 
    "97": "Downregulating the leukocyte adhesion molecules expressed by endothelial cells that line tumor blood vessels can limit the entry of immune effector cells into the tumor mass, thereby contributing to tumoral immune escape. Egfl7 (also known as VE-statin) is a secreted protein specifically expressed by endothelial cells in normal tissues and by cancer cells in various human tumors. High levels of Egfl7 correlate with higher tumor grade and poorer prognosis. Here we show that expression of Egfl7 in breast and lung carcinoma cells accelerates tumor growth and metastasis in immunocompetent mice but not in immunodeficient mice. Tumors expressing Egfl7 were infiltrated relatively poorly by immune cells and were characterized by reduced levels of immunostimulatory cytokines [IFN-\u03b3, interleukin-12 (IL-12)] and fewer endothelial adhesion molecules [intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1)]. In vitro studies revealed that Egfl7 inhibited the expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules by endothelial cells, preventing lymphocyte adhesion. In contrast, Egfl7 did not exert any effects on immune cell activation. Human breast cancer lesions expressing high levels of Egfl7 also expressed less ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in their blood vessels, also indicating an inverse correlation between expression levels of Egfl7 and IFN-\u03b3. Thus, Egfl7 expression in tumors promotes tumor progression by reducing the expression of endothelial molecules that mediate immune cell infiltration. Our findings highlight a novel mechanism through which tumors escape immune control.", 
    "98": "The use of FDA-approved niacin (nicotinic acid or vitamin B3) formulations at therapeutic doses, alone or in combination with statins or other lipid therapies, is safe, improves multiple lipid parameters, and reduces atherosclerosis progression. Niacin is unique as the most potent available lipid therapy to increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and it significantly reduces lipoprotein(a). Through its action on the GPR109A receptor, niacin may also exert beneficial pleiotropic effects independent of changes in lipid levels, such as improving endothelial function and attenuating vascular inflammation. Studies evaluating the impact of niacin in statin-na\u00efve patients on cardiovascular outcomes, or alone and in combination with statins or other lipid therapies on atherosclerosis progression, have been universally favorable. However, the widespread use of niacin to treat residual lipid abnormalities such as low HDL cholesterol, when used in combination with statins among patients achieving very low (<75\u00a0mg/dL) low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, is currently not supported by clinical outcome trials.", 
    "99": "We measured the serum levels of myoglobin, total creatine kinase (CK), and the CK myocardial (CK-MB), muscle (CK-MM), and brain (CK-BB) isoenzymes in 37 subjects treated with statins and 43 nonstatin-treated controls running the 2011 Boston Marathon. Venous blood samples were obtained the day before (PRE) and within 1 hour (FINISH) and 24 hours after (POST) the race. The hematocrit and hemoglobin values were used to adjust for changes in the plasma volume. The CK distribution was normalized using log transformation before analysis. The exercise-related increase in CK 24 hours after exercise, adjusted for changes in plasma volume, was greater in the statin users (PRE to POST 133 \u00b1 15 to 1,104 \u00b1 150 U/L) than in the controls (PRE to POST 125 \u00b1 12 to 813 \u00b1 137 U/L; p = 0.03 for comparison). The increase in CK-MB 24 hours after exercise was also greater in the statin users (PRE to POST 1.1 \u00b1 3.9 to 8.9 \u00b1 7.0 U/L) than in the controls (PRE to POST 0.0 \u00b1 0.0 to 4.2 \u00b1 5.0 U/L; p <0.05 for comparison). However, the increases in muscle myoglobin did not differ at any point between the 2 groups. Increases in CK at both FINISH and POST race measurements were directly related to age in the statin users (r(2) = 0.13 and r(2) = 0.14, respectively; p <0.05) but not in the controls (r(2) = 0.02 and r(2) = 0.00, respectively; p >0.42), suggesting that susceptibility to exercise-induced muscle injury with statins increases with age. In conclusion, our results show that statins increase exercise-related muscle injury.",

The association between these parameters and VTE was determined in non-users of lipid lowering drugs (LLD), in statin users and in fibrate users in a quartile-based analysis. We repeated this stratified analysis within each stratum of men and women.", 
    "102": "The median age of patients was 73 years [interquartile range 58-80], 41.5% were men. Among the 934 patients of the study, 100 were treated with statin, 91 with fibrate and 743 were not receiving LLD. Among non users of LLD, high levels of apolipoprotein B were associated with VTE (OR 1.82, 95% CI 1.19-2.79) after adjustment for age and body mass index. Elevated LDL-cholesterol levels were associated with VTE only in men (OR 2.32, 95% CI 1.07-5.01). High levels of LDL/HDL-cholesterol and apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A-I ratios were associated with VTE (OR 2.76, 95% CI 1.69-4.50 and OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.16-2.97 respectively) but this effect was mainly observed in men.

    "104": "The role of hepatic uptake (Oatp1a1 and Oatp1b4) and efflux (Bcrp and Mrp2) transporters in the disposition of rosuvastatin were investigated using the isolated perfused rat liver (IPRL). A simple physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model was developed to quantitatively determine the interplay between the individual transporters. Uptake and elimination of rosuvastatin in the IPRL was rapid and extensive. In the presence of rifamycin (an equipotent inhibitor of both Oatp1a1 and Oatp1a4) the perfusate clearance of rosuvastatin was reduced, but rifampicin (a potent inhibitor of Oatp1a4) had no effect upon the perfusate clearance. This might indicate a limited role for Oatp1a4, but it is possible that Oatp1a1 (or other uptake transporters) may have redundancy in their affinity for rosuvastatin. In the presence of GF120918 (a potent inhibitor of Bcrp) and in the Wistar TR- rat (a naturally occurring mutant not expressing Mrp2) the biliary clearance was reduced and virtually abolished in the TR- pre-incubated GF120918. Bcrp and Mrp2 appear to represent the primary efflux mechanisms for rosuvastatin in the rat. Rosuvastatin disposition in the IPRL is mediated in part by Oatp1a1 and efflux is almost entirely by Mrp2 and Bcrp. Other uptake processes may be involved.", 
    "105": "Statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarylcoenzyme A reductase inhibitors) are commonly used in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Statins reduce plasma low-density lipoproteins, inhibit inflammatory reaction, improve endothelial function, ameliorate oxidative stress, and reduce platelet activity. Consequently, statins markedly decrease the risk of acute cardiovascular events. H(2)S is synthesized in all layers of the vascular wall, including the endothelium, smooth muscle cells, and perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT).", 
    "106": "Recent studies demonstrate that PVAT-derived H(2)S decreases vascular tone by activating K(ATP) and/or KCNQ potassium channels in smooth muscle cells. Lipophilic atorvastatin, but not hydrophilic pravastatin, increases net H(2)S production in PVAT by inhibiting its mitochondrial oxidation, and augments the anticontractile effect of PVAT. Inhibition of H(2)S metabolism results from atorvastatin-induced decrease in coenzyme Q, which is a cofactor of H(2)S oxidation by sulfide:quinone oxidoreductase. In contrast to H(2)S, statins do not impair mitochondrial oxidation of organic substrates.", 
    "107": "Taking into account antiatherosclerotic and anti-inflammatory effect of H(2)S, the gas may mediate some of the beneficial effects of statins on the cardiovascular system. In addition, specific statins differ in their ability to enhance H(2)S signaling.", 
    "108": "Since both statins and H(2)S reduce ischemia-reperfusion injury, the possible effect of statins on H(2)S oxidation in other tissues such as the heart and the kidney needs to be examined. Inhibition of H(2)S metabolism may be a new therapeutic strategy to improve H(2)S signaling, especially in the mitochondrial compartment.",

In this study, we investigated whether Ox-LDL can induce TGF-\u03b21 protein production, and if so, how it achieves this induction in human alveolar epithelial cells (A549). We show here that Ox-LDL not only caused a dose- and time-dependent up-regulation of TGF-\u03b21 production, but also increased Smad3 phosphorylation, Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity and phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) expression in A549 cells. The inhibition of Ras/ERK activity with specific inhibitors significantly suppressed Ox-LDL-induced TGF-\u03b21 production, Smad3 phosphorylation and PLTP expression. Furthermore, treatment of cells with PLTP siRNA suppressed both TGF-\u03b21 release and Smad3 activation induced by Ox-LDL, but not the activation of Ras/ERK cascade. Taken together, we provide evidences that induction of TGF-\u03b21 production and Smad3 phosphorylation by Ox-LDL is mediated by Ras/ERK/PLTP pathway in human alveolar epithelial cells.",

Mice fed chow were included as controls. After 42 weeks, mice were killed and histologic OA grading of the knees was performed. To monitor the overall inflammation state, systemic human CRP levels were determined.",

In male mice, high-fat diet-induced OA was significantly inhibited by rosuvastatin or rosiglitazone to OA grades observed in control mice. Both treatments resulted in reduced human CRP levels. Furthermore, a positive correlation was found between the relative individual induction of human CRP evoked by a high-fat diet on day 3 and OA grade at end point.",

Patients were grouped into those who received treatment before infection or controls who did not receive treatment for both antiplatelet therapy and, separately, statin therapy. Because of the retrospective study design and thus the nonrandomized treatment groups, a propensity score approach was used to account for the confounding factors that may have influenced treatment allocation. Antiplatelet therapy included aspirin, dipyridamole, clopidogrel, ticlopidine or any combination of these agents. Statin therapy included atorvastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, lovastatin, rosuvastatin, or fluvastatin. The primary end point was a symptomatic embolic event that occurred before or during hospitalization. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess the propensity-adjusted effects of continuous daily therapy with antiplatelet and statin agents on risk of symptomatic emboli. Likewise, Cox proportional hazards regression was used to test for an independent association with 6-month mortality for each of the treatments.",

    "131": "Sandwich-cultured human hepatocytes (SCHH) have been widely used for in vitro assessments of biliary clearance. However, the modulation of metabolism enzymes has not been fully evaluated in this system. The present study was therefore undertaken to determine the activity of cytochrome P450 (P450) 1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A and to evaluate the impact of 1-aminobenzotriazole (ABT) on hepatic uptake and biliary excretion in SCHH. The SCHH maintained integrity and viability as determined by lactate dehydrogenase release and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium assays conducted over the culture period. Although all assessed P450 activity decreased in day 2 SCHH, the extent of the decrease and the subsequent rebound in activity varied across the different isoforms. Day 5 CYP1A2 activity was approximately 2.5-fold higher than day 1 activity, whereas the CYP3A and CYP2C9 activities were 90 and 60% of the day 1 levels, respectively. In contrast, the initial CYP2C8, CYP2C19, and CYP2D6 activity losses did not rebound over the 5-day culture period. Furthermore, ABT was not found to have an effect, whether directly or indirectly as a P450 inactivator, with respect to the hepatic transport of rosuvastatin, atrovastatin, and midazolam in SCHH. Taken together, these results suggest that the SCHH model is a reliable tool to characterize hepatic uptake and biliary excretion.

We aimed at (1) characterizing the effects of flow cessation and cold storage on hepatic endothelial phenotype, and (2) ascertaining if the consequences of cold stasis on the hepatic endothelium can be pharmacologically modulated, improving liver graft function. Expression of KLF2 and its vasoprotective programs was determined in (i) hepatic endothelial cells (HEC) incubated under cold storage conditions with or without the KLF2-inducer simvastatin, and (ii) rat livers not cold stored or preserved in cold University of Wisconsin solution (UWS) supplemented with simvastatin or its vehicle. In addition, upon warm reperfusion hepatic vascular resistance, endothelial function, nitric oxide vasodilator pathway, apoptosis, inflammation, and liver injury were evaluated in not cold stored livers or livers preserved in cold UWS supplemented with simvastatin or vehicle. Expression of KLF2 and its vasoprotective programs decrease in HEC incubated under cold storage conditions. Cold-stored rat livers exhibit a time-dependent decrease in KLF2 and its target genes, liver injury, increased hepatic vascular resistance, and endothelial dysfunction.

This observational study was performed to evaluate the impact of adding ACEIs and/or statins to antiplatelets on post-stroke in-hospital mortality. Ischaemic stroke patients attending a hospital in Malaysia over an 18-month period were evaluated. Patients were categorized according to their vital status at discharge. Data included demographic information, risk factors, clinical characteristics and previous medications with particular attention on antiplatelets, ACEIs and statins. In-hospital mortality was compared among patients who were not taking antiplatelets, ACEIs or statins before stroke onset versus those who were taking antiplatelets alone or in combination with either ACEIs, statins or both. Data analysis was performed using SPSS version 15. Overall, 637 patients met the study inclusion criteria. After controlling for the effects of confounders, adding ACEIs or statins to antiplatelets significantly decreased the incidence of death after stroke attack by 68% (p = 0.036) and 81% (p = 0.010), respectively, compared to patients on antiplatelets alone or none of these medications. Additionally, the addition of both ACEIs and statins to antiplatelet medication resulted in the highest reduction (by 94%) of the occurrence of death after stroke attack (p < 0.001). Our results suggest that adding ACEIs and/or statins to antiplatelets for patients at risk of developing stroke, either as a primary or as a secondary preventive regimen, was associated with a significant reduction in the incidence of mortality after ischaemic stroke than antiplatelets alone. These results might help reduce the rate of ischaemic stroke morbidity and mortality by enhancing the application of specific therapeutic and management strategies for patients at a high risk of acute stroke.",

    "173": "3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) are the most widely prescribed therapeutic class of drugs worldwide, with established clinical benefits both in terms of improving serum lipid profiles and reducing cardiovascular events and mortality. Although statins have a favorable risk-to-benefit ratio, they have the potential to cause adverse events which can result in muscular inflammation (myositis), muscle breakdown (rhabdomyolysis) and, ultimately, kidney failure. While the incidence of rhabdomyolysis is approximately 3.4 cases per 100,000 person-years with standard-dose statin therapy, the risk of developing the condition increases substantially at higher therapeutic doses. This effect may be exacerbated by prescribing statins in combination with certain other medications because drug \ufffd drug interactions increase statin exposure by interacting with enzymes that would normally be involved in their metabolism and clearance. Co-administration of drugs that inhibit the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes responsible for metabolizing statins, or that interact with the organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs) responsible for statin uptake into hepatocytes, substantially increases the risk of developing myotoxicity. Such effects vary among statins according to their metabolic profile. For example, pitavastatin, a novel statin approved for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and combined (mixed) dyslipidemia, is not catabolized by CYP3A4, unlike other lipophilic statins, and may be less dependent on the OATP1B1 transporter for its uptake into hepatocytes before clearance. Such differences in drug \ufffd drug interaction profiles among available statins offer the possibility of reducing the risk of myotoxicity among high-risk patients.", 
    "174": "Statins are well established drugs for primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease (CAD). Despite the well-known ability of statins to lower cholesterol, it is now clear that clinical benefits are also substantially higher than expected and several clinical trials, like JUPITER (Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin trial) have indicated that such clinical effects are independent of cholesterol reduction. These cholesterol-independent actions have been named \"pleiotropic effects\" and include: anti-oxidation and anti-inflammatory effects, modulation of immune activation, stabilization of atherosclerotic plaque, decreased platelet activation, inhibition of cardiac hypertrophy, reduction of cytokine-mediated vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation and improvement of endothelial function. Recently, additional pleiotropic effects of statins on \"cellular senescence\" have been seen in different cell types, including endothelial progenitor cells (EPC), endothelial cells (EC), VSMC and chondrocytes. At the molecular level, the effect of statins on cellular senescence could be mediated by their interaction with the telomere/telomerase system. Recent evidence suggests that the anti-aging effects of statins are linked to their ability to inhibit telomere shortening by reducing either directly and indirectly oxidative telomeric DNA damage, as well as by a telomere capping proteins dependent mechanism. In this review, we discuss the pleiotropic effects of statins, focusing on the telomere/telomerase system. We will also present our current findings regarding leukocyte telomere length in very old people with myocardial infarction on statin therapy.", 
    "175": "Although statins are widely prescribed medications, there remains considerable variability in therapeutic response. Genetics can explain only part of this variability. Metabolomics is a global biochemical approach that provides powerful tools for mapping pathways implicated in disease and in response to treatment. Metabolomics captures net interactions between genome, microbiome and the environment. In this study, we used a targeted GC-MS metabolomics platform to measure a panel of metabolites within cholesterol synthesis, dietary sterol absorption, and bile acid formation to determine metabolite signatures that may predict variation in statin LDL-C lowering efficacy. Measurements were performed in two subsets of the total study population in the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics (CAP) study: Full Range of Response (FR), and Good and Poor Responders (GPR) were 100 individuals randomly selected from across the entire range of LDL-C responses in CAP. GPR were 48 individuals, 24 each from the top and bottom 10% of the LDL-C response distribution matched for body mass index, race, and gender. We identified three secondary, bacterial-derived bile acids that contribute to predicting the magnitude of statin-induced LDL-C lowering in good responders. Bile acids and statins share transporters in the liver and intestine; we observed that increased plasma concentration of simvastatin positively correlates with higher levels of several secondary bile acids. Genetic analysis of these subjects identified associations between levels of seven bile acids and a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), rs4149056, in the gene encoding the organic anion transporter SLCO1B1. These findings, along with recently published results that the gut microbiome plays an important role in cardiovascular disease, indicate that interactions between genome, gut microbiome and environmental influences should be considered in the study and management of cardiovascular disease. Metabolic profiles could provide valuable information about treatment outcomes and could contribute to a more personalized approach to therapy.",

Dyslipidemic humans were assessed by the same measures. Plasma lipoprotein profiles, eight major plasma lipid fractions, and FA compositions within these lipid fractions were compared both qualitatively and quantitatively across the species. Given the importance of statins in decreasing plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol for treatment of dyslipidemia in humans, the responses of these measures to simvastatin treatment were also assessed for each species and compared with dyslipidemic humans. NHPs, followed by dog, were the models that demonstrated closest overall match to dyslipidemic humans.

Adequate treatment of vascular risk factors, such as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and systolic blood pressure are known to reduce the future risk of cardiovascular disease in these patients. However currently, large treatment gaps exist among high-risk individuals, in whom the guidelines recommend concomitant treatment with aspirin, statin, and blood-pressure lowering agents. Combining aspirin, cholesterol, and blood-pressure lowering agents into a single pill called the cardiovascular polypill has been proposed as complementary care in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases in both intermediate- and high-risk patient populations. It is now a decade since the first recommendations to develop and trial cardiovascular polypills. The major scientific debate has been about the appropriate initial target population. This review article focuses on the potential role of fixed-dose combination therapy in different patient populations, outlines the pros and cons of combination therapy, and emphasizes the rationale for trialing their use. Current and planned future cardiovascular polypill trials are summarized and the pre-requisites for implementation of the polypill strategy in both primary and secondary prevention are described.

This antibody, J16, and its precursor mouse antibody, J10, potently inhibit PCSK9 binding to the LDLR extracellular domain and PCSK9-mediated down-regulation of LDLR in vitro. In vivo, J10 effectively reduces serum cholesterol in C57BL/6 mice fed normal chow. J16 reduces LDL-C in healthy and diet-induced hypercholesterolemic cynomologous monkeys, but does not significantly affect high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol. Furthermore, J16 greatly lowered LDL-C in hypercholesterolemic monkeys treated with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin.

    "199": "Osteoblasts and adipocytes are derived from mesenchymal stem cells and play important roles in skeletal homeostasis. Osteoblast differentiation results in a decrease in the cellular concentration of the isoprenoid geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), and the statin-mediated depletion of GGPP stimulates osteoblast differentiation. Adipogenic differentiation, in contrast, results in increased expression of GGPP synthase (GGPPS), and GGPP lowering agents inhibit adipogenesis in vitro. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that GGPP inhibits osteoblast differentiation and enhances adipogenesis. We found that treatment with exogenous GGPP reduced osteoblastic gene expression and matrix mineralization in primary calvarial osteoblast cultures. GGPP treatment of primary calvarial osteoblasts and bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) led to increased expression of total peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)-\u03b3 as well as the adipocyte specific splice variant PPAR\u03b32. Inhibition of PPAR\u03b3 transcriptional activity did not prevent the effects of GGPP on osteoblasts, suggesting that enhanced PPAR\u03b3 expression is secondary to the inhibition of osteoblast differentiation. Enhanced PPAR\u03b3 expression correlated with the increased formation of Oil Red O-positive cells in osteoblast cultures. Additionally, primary calvarial osteoblasts treated with GGPP exhibited increased expression of the adipokine adiponectin. Consistent with a role for GGPP in adipogenesis, adipogenic differentiation of BMSCs could be impaired by specific depletion of cellular GGPP. In contrast to previous reports utilizing other cell types, treatment of osteoblasts with GGPP did not increase geranylgeranylation, suggesting that GGPP itself may be acting as a signaling molecule. GGPP treatment of MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts and primary calvarial osteoblasts led to enhanced insulin-induced Erk signaling which has been previously demonstrated to inhibit insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 activity. Additionally, GGPP treatment of MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts resulted in a decrease in the insulin-induced phosphorylation of the insulin receptor. Altogether these findings demonstrate a negative role for GGPP in osteoblast differentiation, leading to increased adipogenesis. Additionally, the effects of GGPP on insulin signaling suggest a potential mechanism for inhibition of osteoblast differentiation and also implicate a role for this isoprenoid in physiological energy homeostasis.",

    "204": "Hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme-A reductase inhibitors simvastatin and atorvastatin are effective at lowering LDL-C levels and reducing the risk of cardiovascular (CV) events.", 
    "205": "The objective of this study was to examine differences in drug utilization and CV event risk among elderly patients newly initiated on simvastatin versus atorvastatin.", 
    "206": "This was a retrospective analysis using pharmacy and medical claims from a US health plan database. Enrollees aged \u226565 years, newly initiated on simvastatin or atorvastatin (index drugs) from July 1, 2006 to November 30, 2008 were identified for study inclusion. Patients were excluded if they had any prescriptions for clopidogrel, nitrates, or other dyslipidemia medication, or any CV events before index drug initiation. Adherence was calculated by proportion of days covered with index medication. CV events (myocardial infarction, ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease, aortic aneurysm, revascularization, or heart failure) were identified from medical claims.", 
    "207": "There were 11,470 atorvastatin initiators and 20,132 simvastatin initiators identified. Mean age of these patients was 72 years; 40% were male; nearly half had hypertension; and more than a quarter had diabetes. The majority of statin therapy (77%) was prescribed by primary care physicians. Forty-nine percent of atorvastatin patients were initiated on a 10 mg-dose and 61% of simvastatin patients on 5-, 10-, or 20-mg doses. A larger percentage of patients in the simvastatin cohort were adherent to index therapy than patients in the atorvastatin cohort (43% vs 36%, respectively). Multivariate regression adjusting for patient characteristics revealed no significant difference in CV events between patients receiving atorvastatin versus simvastatin.", 
    "208": "In this study of elderly statin patients without recent evidence of CV events, the majority of patients started on low-dose therapy and did not achieve sufficient adherence. After controlling for patient and clinical characteristics, no statistically significant difference in risk of CV event was observed based on initiation with atorvastatin versus simvastatin."
