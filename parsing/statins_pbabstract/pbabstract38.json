    "16": "Neuronal damage in the hippocampal formation is more sensitive to ischemic stimulation and easily injured, causing severe learning and memory impairment. Therefore, protection of hippocampal neuronal damage is the main contributor for learning and memory impairment during cerebral ischemia. Atorvastatin has been reported to ameliorate ischemic brain damage after ischemia reperfusion (I/R). However, its molecular mechanism has not been elucidated clearly. In this study, we established four-vessel occlusion model in rats with cerebral ischemia. Here, we demonstrated that atorvastatin significantly improves the behavior of I/R-rat in open field tasks. We also found that atorvastatin significantly shortens the distance and time of loading onto the hidden platform in the positioning navigation process, decreases the latency in the space exploration process when cognitive testing with Morris water maze was performed during ischemic stroke in rats. Furthermore, the survival rate of neurons in the CA1 area of the hippocampus and the phosphorylation of Akt (Ser473) in the neurons are increased, whereas the expression of caspase-3 are inhibited by atorvastatin. However, after an intracerebroventricular injection of LY294002 (an inhibitor of Akt1), the above neuroprotective effects of atorvastatin are attenuated. In summary, our results imply atorvastatin may improve the survival rate of hippocampal neurons and reduce the impairment of learning and memory by downregulating the activation of the caspase-3 via increasing the phosphorylation of Akt1 during ischemia/reperfusion.",

Given the benefit on cardiovascular outcome, this should not cause patients to stop statin treatment, but may indicate a need to revisit dose of insulin when starting statin treatment.", 
    "21": "The objective of this study was to examine whether the PI3-kinase/Akt pathway is involved in the activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and in the subsequent increase of nitric oxide (NO) production that has been proved to play a role in the antiarrhythmic effect of acute simvastatin treatment in anaesthetised dogs, subjected to a 25min occlusion and reperfusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Using the same model, 12 dogs out of the 26 controls (given the solvent of simvastatin) and 11 dogs out of the 23 animals treated with intracoronary administered simvastatin (0.1mg/kg), were now received wortmannin (1.5mg/kg, ic.), a selective inhibitor of PI3-kinase. In another 13 dogs the effects of DMSO (0.1%), the vehicle of wortmannin, were examined. Compared to the controls, simvastatin markedly reduced the severity of ischaemia (epicardial ST-segment, inhomogeneity) and ventricular arrhythmias that were reversed (except the occlusion-induced ventricular fibrillation [VF; 50%, 0%, 0%]) by the administration of wortmannin. Thus in these groups there were 310\u00b145, 62\u00b114, 307\u00b159 ectopic beats, 7.1\u00b11.4, 0.3\u00b1 0.2, 4.3\u00b11.3 tachycardiac episodes that occurred 93%, 17% and 73% of the dogs during occlusion, whereas survival following reperfusion was 0%, 67% and 0%, respectively. Simvastatin also increased the phosphorylation of eNOS and the plasma nitrate/nitrite levels, but reduced myocardial superoxide production on reperfusion. These effects of simvastatin were also abolished in the presence of wortmannin. We conclude that the NO-dependent antiarrhythmic effect of simvastatin involves the rapid activation of eNOS through the stimulation of the PI3-kinase/Akt pathway.", 
    "22": "Statins remain the mainstay of medical cardiovascular risk reduction because of their effectiveness in decreasing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) as well as some other potentially beneficial effects. The latest US 2013 lipid guidelines essentially recommend only the prescription of a high-dose statin for the high-risk patient. However, both quite old and quite new outcomes evidence, such as reported for ezetimibe, emphasize that LDL-C lowering is, in and of itself, quite important for cardiovascular risk reduction. It appears that the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors represent a major new contribution to this effort, especially for patients with severe familial hypercholesterolemia, proven clinical cardiovascular disease, statin intolerance, or failure to attain an acceptably low LDL-C goal despite maximum available medical management. Very recent clinical trials have proven overwhelmingly the effectiveness and safety of PCSK9 inhibitors for lowering LDL-C. Both alirocumab and evolocumab have now been approved by the US FDA and there are some initial favorable outcomes data. This review is intended to summarize available evidence and emphasize the possible clinical role of these inhibitors following the approval of alirocumab and evolocumab. Understanding the negative receptor feedback of PCSK9 and the mechanism and beneficial effect of PCSK9 inhibitors for cardiovascular risk reduction is essential for the up-to-date practitioner of cardiovascular medicine. There is every reasonable hope for significant cardiovascular benefit from these new additions to our medical cardiovascular armamentarium.", 
    "23": "Sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) has been reported as a functional receptor for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. However, HBV could not efficiently infect HepG2 cells expressing NTCP (NTCP-HepG2 cells) under adherent monolayer-cell conditions. In this study, NTCP was mainly detected in the basolateral membrane region, but not the apical site, of monolayer NTCP-HepG2 cells. We hypothesized that non-adherent cell conditions of infection would enhance HBV infectivity. Non-adherent NTCP-HepG2 cells were prepared by treatment with trypsin and EDTA, which did not degrade NTCP in the membrane fraction. HBV successfully infected NTCP-HepG2 cells at a viral dose 10 times lower in non-adherent phase than in adherent phase. Efficient infection of non-adherent NTCP-HepG2 cells with blood-borne or cell-culture-derived HBV was observed and was remarkably impaired in the presence of the myristoylated preS1 peptide. HBV could also efficiently infect HepaRG cells under non-adherent cell conditions. We screened several compounds using our culture system and identified proscillaridin A as a potent anti-HBV agent with an IC50 value of 7.2\u2009nM. In conclusion, non-adherent host cell conditions of infection augmented HBV infectivity in an NTCP-dependent manner, thus providing a novel strategy to identify anti-HBV drugs and investigate the mechanism of HBV infection.", 
    "24": "Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Despite considerable advances in cardiovascular pharmacology, significant inter-individual variability in response to drugs affects both their efficacy and safety profile. Drug-gene associations have emerged as important factors determining a spectrum of response to therapy. Pharmacogenomic interactions in cardiovascular medicine are also involved in etiology of adverse effects that may be life-threatening, such as statin-induced myopathy or a hemorrhage/thrombosis event during anticoagulant therapy. Introduction of genetic tests prior to the initiation of therapy and implementation of genetically-guided therapy represent a step forward to achieving a goal of individualized medicine in cardiology, already present in recommendations for warfarin and clopidogrel. However, further investigations addressing genomic predictors of variability in response to drugs are still needed and translating these findings into routine clinical practice remains a substantial challenge.",

The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of statins on metastatic colonization by triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. TNBC cell lines were treated with simvastatin and then studied for cell cycle progression and proliferation in vitro, and metastasis formation in vivo, following injection of statin-treated cells. Reverse-phase protein assay (RPPA) analysis was performed on statin-treated and control breast cancer cells. RNA interference targeting FOXO3a was used to measure the impact of simvastatin on FOXO3a-expressing cells. The prognostic value of FOXO3a mRNA expression was examined in eight public breast cancer gene expression datasets including 1479 patients. Simvastatin increased G1/S-phase arrest of the cell cycle and inhibited both proliferation and migration of TNBC cells in vitro. In vitro pre-treatment and in vivo treatment with simvastatin reduced metastases. Phosphorylated FOXO3a was downregulated after simvastatin treatment in (RPPA) analysis. Ectopic expression of FOXO3a enhanced mammosphere formation and migratory capacity in vitro. Knockdown of FOXO3a attenuated the effect of simvastatin on mammosphere formation and migration. Analysis of public gene expression data demonstrates FOXO3a mRNA downregulation was independently associated with shorter metastasis-free survival in all breast cancers, as well as in TNBC breast cancers. Simvastatin inhibits in vitro endpoints associated with metastasis through a FOXO3a mechanism and reduced metastasis formation in vivo. FOXO3a expression is prognostic for metastasis formation in patient data. Further investigation of simvastatin as a cancer therapy is warranted.",

We describe cholesterol treatment in an academic practice of family and internal medicine physicians to understand factors associated with achievement of guideline-based treatment goals in women compared with men. Primary care patients aged 40 to 75 years were included if they were prescribed a statin, had a Framingham risk score of \u2265 10%, had diabetes, or had atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Patients were classified into Adult Treatment Panel III categories and assessed to whether they were in compliance with Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines. Odds ratios of goal adherence between women and men were calculated, and a multivariate model for goal achievement was created. In 2,747 patients, women were less likely to achieve cholesterol goals (odds ratio [OR] 0.82; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70 to 0.95) despite having more prescriptions for statins (48% vs 39%, p <0.001). More women than men failed to reach low-density lipoprotein goals because they were not prescribed a statin (OR 0.69; 95% CI 0.56 to 0.85) and women on high-intensity statins were less likely than men to achieve goals (OR 0.51; 95% CI 0.27 to 0.96). In all patients, diabetes was associated with nonattainment of cholesterol goals, but in high-risk women, the presence of diabetes improved goal achievement. In conclusion, women achieved guideline-based cholesterol recommendations at a lower rate than men, even when individual goals are considered.",

    "43": "Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a critical modulator of cholesterol homeostasis. Whereas PCSK9 gain-of-function (GOF) mutations are associated with autosomal dominant hypercholesterolemia (ADH) and premature atherosclerosis, PCSK9 loss-of-function (LOF) mutations have a cardio-protective effect and in some cases can lead to familial hypobetalipoproteinemia (FHBL). However, limitations of the currently available cellular models preclude deciphering the consequences of PCSK9 mutation further. We aimed to validate urine-sample-derived human induced pluripotent stem cells (UhiPSCs) as an appropriate tool to model PCSK9-mediated ADH and FHBL. To achieve our goal, urine-sample-derived somatic cells were reprogrammed into hiPSCs by using episomal vectors. UhiPSC were efficiently differentiated into hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs). Compared to control cells, cells originally derived from an individual with ADH (HLC-S127R) secreted less PCSK9 in the media (-38.5%; P=0.038) and had a 71% decrease (P<0.001) of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake, whereas cells originally derived from an individual with FHBL (HLC-R104C/V114A) displayed a strong decrease in PCSK9 secretion (-89.7%; P<0.001) and had a 106% increase (P=0.0104) of LDL uptake. Pravastatin treatment significantly enhanced LDL receptor (LDLR) and PCSK9 mRNA gene expression, as well as PCSK9 secretion and LDL uptake in both control and S127R HLCs. Pravastatin treatment of multiple clones led to an average increase of LDL uptake of 2.19 \u00b1 0.77-fold in HLC-S127R compared to 1.38 \u00b1 0.49 fold in control HLCs (P<0.01), in line with the good response to statin treatment of individuals carrying the S127R mutation (mean LDL cholesterol reduction=60.4%, n=5). In conclusion, urine samples provide an attractive and convenient source of somatic cells for reprogramming and hepatocyte differentiation, but also a powerful tool to further decipher PCSK9 mutations and function.",

There are multiple reasons why these interventions prove to be disappointing. The pathophysiology of AKI in different settings has not been fully elucidated, the underlying cause of AKI in the clinical setting is often multifactorial, and animal AKI models often do not mimic human AKI very well. Ischemia-reperfusion models are representative for human AKI in the setting of aortic clamping or in case of delayed graft function after kidney transplantation, but are not suited to study AKI in many other conditions such as sepsis.

After informed consent is provided, patients are randomized to receive either atorvastatin (oral 20 mg/night for 8 weeks) or placebo (dextrin for 8 weeks); and followed for 16 weeks after the treatment. The primary outcome is the change in hematoma volume at the end of 8-week treatment. Secondary outcomes include: changes in 1) the hematoma volume at the 4(th), 12(th), and 24(th) weeks; 2) Markwalder's Grading Scale and Glasgow Coma Scale (MGS-GCS); 3) Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS) and 4) Activities of Daily Life-the Barthel Index scale (ADL-BI).

Previous studies have shown that radiotherapy induced myocardial fibrosis and intensified myocardial remodeling. In this study, we investigated whether atorvastatin could inhibit radiation-induced heart fibrosis in Sprague-Dawley rats, which were randomly divided into six groups: control; radiation only; and four treatment groups receiving atorvastatin plus radiation (E1, E2, E3 and E4). All rats, except the control group, received local heart irradiation in 7 daily fractions of 3 Gy for a total of 21 Gy. Rats in groups E1 (10 mg/kg/day) and E2 (20 mg/kg/day) received atorvastatin and radiation treatment until week 12 after exposure. Rats in groups E3 (10 mg/kg/day) and E4 (20 mg/kg/day) received atorvastatin treatment from 3 months before irradiation to week 12 after irradiation. The expressions of TGF-\u03b21, Smad2, Smad3, fibronectin, ROCK I and p-Akt in heart tissues were evaluated using real-time PCR or Western blot analyses. Atorvastatin significantly reduced the expression of TGF-\u03b21, Smad3/P-Smad3, ROCK I and p-Akt in rats of the E1-E4 groups and in a dose-dependent manner. Fibronectin exhibited a similar pattern of expression changes. In addition, echocardiography showed that atorvastatin treatment can inhibit the increase of left ventricular end-diastolic dimension, left ventricular end-systolic diameter and left ventricular posterior wall thickness, and prevent the decrease of ejection fraction and fraction shortening in E1-E4 groups compared with the radiation only group. This study demonstrated that radiation exposure increased the expression of fibronectin in cardiac fibroblasts and induced cardiac fibrosis through activation of the TGF-\u03b21/Smad3, RhoA/ROCK, and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways. Statins ameliorated radiation-induced cardiac fibrosis in Sprague-Dawley rats.

Because current guidelines suggest a uniform LDL-C goal when treating patients meeting guideline indications for therapy, it was expected that the size of the gap between LDL-C goal and LDL-C attained with maximally tolerated statins would uniformly dictate when proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors would be desired. This expectation, however, was not met. In particular, the results suggest that primary prevention patients and patients with chronic kidney disease do not appear to represent high priority circumstances for achieving even the current LDL-C goal despite existing guidelines.

The viability of tendon cells and cell cycle progression were examined by the MTT assay and flow cytometric analysis, respectively. Immunofluorescent staining for Ki-67 was used to assess the proliferation activity of tendon cells. Western blot analysis and coimmunoprecipitation was used to determine the protein expression of cell cycle-related proteins. To investigate the potential mechanism underlying the effect of statins on tendon cells, mevalonate, farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) was added to simvastatin-treated tendon cells. Simvastatin inhibited the in\u00a0vitro tendon healing model and tendon cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Immunofluorescent staining demonstrated reduced ki-67 expression in simvastatin-treated tendon cells. Furthermore, simvastatin induced cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. The expression levels of cdk1, cdk2, cyclin A, and cyclin E were downregulated by simvastatin in a dose-dependent manner. The inhibitory effect of simvastatin was proved to mediate the reduction of mevalonate, and the addition of exogenous GGPP completely prevented the inhibitory effect of simvastatin on tendon cells.

Accordingly, we hypothesized that endothelial cell (EC) protection by simvastatin is dependent on these effects and sought to further characterize the functional role of ITGB4 as a mediator of EC protection in the setting of excessive mechanical stretch at levels relevant to ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Initially, early ITGB4 tyrosine phosphorylation was confirmed in human pulmonary artery EC subjected to excessive cyclic stretch (18% CS). EC overexpression of mutant ITGB4 with specific tyrosines mutated to phenylalanine (Y1440, Y1526 Y1640, or Y1422) resulted in significantly attenuated CS-induced cytokine expression (IL6, IL-8, MCP-1, and RANTES). In addition, EC overexpression of ITGB4 constructs with specific structural deletions also resulted in significantly attenuated CS-induced inflammatory cytokine expression compared to overexpression of wildtype ITGB4. Finally, mice expressing a mutant ITGB4 lacking a cytoplasmic signaling domain were found to have attenuated lung injury after VILI-challenge (VT\u2009=\u200940\u2009ml/kg, 4\u2009h).

    "110": "Ras isoforms H-, N-, and K-ras are each mutated in specific cancer types at varying frequencies and have different activities in cell fate control. On the plasma membrane, Ras proteins are laterally segregated into isoform-specific nanoscale signaling hubs, termed nanoclusters. As Ras nanoclusters are required for Ras signaling, chemical modulators of nanoclusters represent ideal candidates for the specific modulation of Ras activity in cancer drug development. We therefore conducted a chemical screen with commercial and in-house natural product libraries using a cell-based H-ras-nanoclustering FRET assay. Next to established Ras inhibitors, such as a statin and farnesyl-transferase inhibitor, we surprisingly identified five protein synthesis inhibitors as positive regulators. Using commonly employed cycloheximide as a representative compound, we show that protein synthesis inhibition increased nanoclustering and effector recruitment specifically of active H-ras but not of K-ras. Consistent with these data, cycloheximide treatment activated both Erk and Akt kinases and specifically promoted H-rasG12V-induced, but not K-rasG12V-induced, PC12 cell differentiation. Intriguingly, cycloheximide increased the number of mammospheres, which are enriched for cancer stem cells. Depletion of H-ras in combination with cycloheximide significantly reduced mammosphere formation, suggesting an exquisite synthetic lethality. The potential of cycloheximide to promote tumor cell growth was also reflected in its ability to increase breast cancer cell tumors grown in ovo. These results illustrate the possibility of identifying Ras-isoform-specific modulators using nanocluster-directed screening. They also suggest an unexpected feedback from protein synthesis inhibition to Ras signaling, which might present a vulnerability in certain tumor cell types.",

The Open-Label Study of Long-term Evaluation Against LDL-C (OSLER), and The Long-term Safety and Tolerability of Alirocumab in High Cardiovascular Risk Patients with Hypercholesterolemia Not Adequately Controlled with Their Lipid Modifying Therapy (ODYSSEY LONG TERM) studies are two phase 3, multicentre, randomized, placebo controlled studies that were conducted to evaluate the long term efficacy and safety of evolocumab and alirocumab respectively in reducing lipids and cardiovascular (CV) events. Both studies demonstrated additional 48-53% reduction of CV events when added to statin therapy. Most adverse events occurred with similar frequency in the two groups; however the rate of neurocognitive adverse events was higher with evolocumab and alirocumab than with placebo. These data provide strong support for the notion that lower LDL-C goal is better, and may confirm the role of PCSK9 inhibitors as a new frontier in lipid management.

The most important clinical manifestation of this interaction is diabetic dyslipidemia, characterized by elevated triglycerides, low high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and predominance of small-dense LDL particles. However, in the last decade we have learned that the interaction is much more complex. Hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL-C cannot only be the consequence but also the cause of a disturbed glucose metabolism. Furthermore, it is now well established that statins are associated with a small but significant increase in the risk for new onset diabetes. The underlying mechanisms are not completely understood but modulation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG CoA)-reductase may play a central role as genetic data indicate that mutations resulting in lower HMG CoA-reductase activity are also associated with obesity, higher glucose concentrations and diabetes. Very interestingly, this statin induced increased risk for new onset type 2 diabetes is not detectable in subjects with familial hypercholesterolemia. Furthermore, patients with familial hypercholesterolemia seem to have a lower risk for type 2 diabetes, a phenomenon which seems to be dose-dependent (the higher the low density lipoprotein cholesterol, the lower the risk).

In clinical samples, simvastatin led to increase in cleaved caspase-3 (p = 0.002) and decreased trend for Ki67 (p = 0.245). Simvastatin markedly suppressed PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling by activating PTEN (p = 0.005) and by dephosphorylating Akt (p = 0.002) and S6RP (p = 0.033); it also inhibited MAPK/ERK pathway by dephosphorylating c-Raf (p = 0.018) and ERK1/2 (p = 0.002). In ER-positive (MCF-7, T47D) and ER-negative (MDA-MB-231, BT-549) breast cancer cells, simvastatin treatment consistently induced apoptosis and inhibited proliferation by deregulating caspase cascades and cell cycle proteins in a dose dependent manner. Concordantly, simvastatin strongly suppressed PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway by enhancing PTEN expression and by further sequentially dephosphorylating downstream cascades including Akt, mTOR, p70S6K, S6RP and 4E-BP1. Furthermore, simvastatin significantly inhibited MAPK/ERK pathway by dephosphorylating sequential cascades such as c-Raf, MEK1/2 and ERK1/2. These simvastatin anti-tumoral effects were reversed by metabolic products of the mevalonate pathway, including mevalonate, farnesyl pyrophosphate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate.

Average statin use was calculated as the sum of DDDs divided by the duration from the initial statin prescription date to the index date (per year), and was subdivided into 3 levels: <30, 30 to 119, and \u2265120 DDDs. Comorbidity, including hypertension, depression, and the Charlson comorbidity index, the frequency of eye care visits, and the use of nonstatin cholesterol-lowering drugs, were all considered as confounding factors.For the group with statin use, the adjusted odds ratio of OAG was 1.02 (95% confidence interval 0.90-1.15) when compared with the group without statin use. Subanalysis showed that a high dosage of statin use (\u2265120\u200aDDD/y) resulted in a1.24-fold increased risk of OAG (odds ratio 1.24, 95% confidence interval 1.03-1.49). The incidence of OAG was increased with the increase of the dosage of statin use (P for trend\u200a=\u200a0.0458).Clinicians should be cautious of hyperlipidemia patients with a high dosage of statin use because it might be associated with an increased risk of OAG. Ophthalmologist consultation is necessary for this high-risk group.", 
    "177": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality globally. Effective CVD preventive medications are available including statin, blood pressure-lowering and antiplatelet medications; however most people do not take these drugs long term. Fixed-dose combination pills (\"polypills\") have been shown, in several clinical trials, to improve adherence to these recommended medications, with corresponding improvements in risk factors such as blood pressure and LDL-cholesterol. In patients not taking all modalities of recommended CVD preventive therapies, polypill-based strategies could importantly contribute to global CVD control strategies. The largest benefits are seen in those who are under-treated at baseline, rather than those who are already taking the individual components separately: simplified step-up is more important than pill count reduction. Despite the potential benefits for patients and payers, only a few polypills are available due to market failure in the funding of research and development for affordable non-communicable disease medicines. Regulatory paradigms have focused on substitution indications among patients already taking component medications; however, this is the population that is likely to receive the least benefit from a polypill-based strategy. Greater health impact is likely if focus is given to patients who have indications for all polypill components, but currently do not receive the benefits of recommended medicines long term.",

Change in oxLDL significantly correlated with changes in noncalcified plaque volume, total plaque volume, positively remodeled plaque, and low attenuation plaque. The association between changes in oxLDL and noncalcified plaque volume was independent of the baseline 10-year Framingham risk, LDL, CD4 cell count, and viral load.",

In our study, human THP-1 macrophage cells were used to study the effects of various statins on the expressions of the atherosclerotic genes and Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2). Cerivastatin significantly inhibited the two atherosclerotic genes, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) at both the mRNA and protein levels, while the other statins did not. Accordingly, cerivastatin was also the most potent inducer of KLF2 transcription in the macrophages. An siRNA-induced reduction in KLF2 expression blocked the inhibition of MCP-1 and CCR2 by cerivastatin. When the cells were further treated with mevalonate, farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP) or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), the effects of cerivastatin on KLF2, MCP-1 and CCR2 were obviously reversed. Thus, the results showed that cerivastatin was a potent inhibitor of the inflammation genes MCP-1 and CCR2 through the induction of KLF2. The regulation of MCP-1, CCR2 and KLF2 by cerivastatin was isoprenoid pathway dependent. Our studies suggest that the effect of cerivastatin on atherosclerotic genes and KLF2 expression may contribute to the cardioprotection observed in reported clinical studies.",

The effect of independent variables (polymer content, stabilizer concentration, volume of chloroform and homogenization speed) on response variables (mean diameter particle size and entrapment efficiency) were investigated by employing central composite experimental design. All the independent variables were found to be significant for determining the response variables. Solid-state characterization study indicated the absence of physicochemical interaction between drug and polymer in formulation. Morphological study exhibited homogenous spherical shape of formulated nanoparticles. In vitro release study in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) demonstrated sustained release profile over 24\u2009h. Pharmacokinetic study in Charles Foster rats showed significant enhancement in oral bioavailability as compared to pure drug suspension. Efficacy study (lipid profile and blood glucose level) significantly justified the effectiveness of formulation having 50% less dose of ATR as compared to pure drug suspension. The effectiveness of formulation was further justified with an improved plasma safety profile of treated rats. Hence, ATR encapsulated eudragit RSPO nanoparticles can serve as potential drug delivery approach to enhance drug bioavailability, efficacy and safety profiles to alter existing marketed drug products.",

On 28 days, mice were sacrificed and aorta and sera were collected to analyze the atherosclerotic lesion and blood lipid and cholesterol levels. As a result, ezetimibe alone exerted similar protective effects on atherosclerotic lesion sizes as atorvastatin, which was mediated by lowering serum cholesterol concentrations, inhibiting macrophage accumulation in the lesions and reducing circulatory inflammatory cytokines, such as monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-\u03b1). In contrast to ezetimibe administration, atorvastatin alone attenuated atherosclerotic lesion which is dependent on its anti-inflammation effects. There were no significance differences in lesion areas and serum concentrations of cholesterol, oxidized LDL and inflammatory cytokines between combination therapy and monotherapy (either ezetimibe or atorvastatin). There were significant correlations between the lesion areas and serum concentrations of cholesterol, MCP-1 and TNF-\u03b1, respectively.

Repurposing existing drugs presents an alternative strategy to potentially expedite the discovery of new antimicrobial drugs. The present study demonstrates that simvastatin, an antihyperlipidemic drug exhibited broad-spectrum antibacterial activity against important Gram-positive (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)) and Gram-negative pathogens (once the barrier imposed by the outer membrane was permeabilized). Proteomics and macromolecular synthesis analyses revealed that simvastatin inhibits multiple biosynthetic pathways and cellular processes in bacteria, including selective interference of bacterial protein synthesis. This property appears to assist in simvastatin's ability to suppress production of key MRSA toxins (\u03b1-hemolysin and Panton-Valentine leucocidin) that impair healing of infected skin wounds. A murine MRSA skin infection experiment confirmed that simvastatin significantly reduces the bacterial burden and inflammatory cytokines in the infected wounds. Additionally, simvastatin exhibits excellent anti-biofilm activity against established staphylococcal biofilms and demonstrates the ability to be combined with topical antimicrobials currently used to treat MRSA skin infections.

This method could be used for the screening of large compound libraries. Our studies showed that some flavonoids (e.g., quercetin, quercitrin, rutin, chrysanthemum flavonoids and mulberrin) and triterpenoids (e.g., glycyrrhetinic acid and glycyrrhizic acid) were inhibitors of OATP1B1 with IC50 values less than 16 \u00b5mol \u00b7 L(-1). The IC50 value of glycyrrhetinic acid on OATP1B1 was comparable to its blood concentration in clinics, indicating an OATPlB1-mediated drug-drug interaction could occur. Structure-activity relationship analysis showed that flavonoids had much higher inhibitory activity than their glycosides. Furthermore, the type and length of saccharides had a significant effect on their activity. In addition, we used OATP1B1 substrates fluvastatin and rosuvastatin as probe drugs to investigate the substrate-dependent effect of several natural compounds on the function of OATP1B1 in vitro. Our results demonstrated that the effect of these natural products on the function of OATPlB1 was substrate-dependent.

Rats were treated daily for 28 days with the combination of ezetimibe and simvastatin (10/40 mg/kg) by oral gavage. To measure gluconeogenesis and the associated pathways, isolated perfused rat liver was used. In addition, subcellular fractions, such as microsomes and mitochondria, were used for complementary measures of enzymatic activities. Treatment with the combination of simvastatin and ezetimibe resulted in a decrease in gluconeogenesis from pyruvate (-62%). Basal oxygen consumption of the treated animals was higher (+22%) than that of the control rats, but the resulting oxygen consumption that occurred after pyruvate infusion was 43% lower in animals treated with the combination of simvastatin and ezetimibe. Oxygen consumption in the livers from treated animals was completely inhibited by cyanide (electron transport chain inhibitor), but not by proadifen (cytochrome P450 inhibitor). Chronic treatment with ezetimibe/simvastatin decreased the activity of the key enzymes glucose-6-phosphatase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase by 59% and 45%, respectively, which is probably the major reason for the decreased gluconeogenesis seen in ezetimibe-/simvastatin-treated rats.

    "226": "Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome is an autosomal recessive mental retardation and multiple malformation syndrome caused by deficiency of the 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase, the enzyme catalyzing the last step in cholesterol biosynthesis. The authors summarize the pathophysiology, epidemiology, clinical picture, diagnostics and therapy of the disease based on a review of the international literature. Since 2004, fourteen patients have been diagnosed with Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome in Hungary, which suggests an underdiagnosis of the disease based upon estimated incidence data. Due to deficiency of the 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase, serum cholesterol concentration is low and 7-dehydrocholesterol concentration is elevated in blood and tissues; the latter being highly specific for the syndrome. Detection of disease-causing mutations makes the prenatal diagnosis possible. The clinical spectrum is wide, the most common symptom is syndactyly of the second and third toes. Standard therapy is cholesterol supplementation. Recent publications suggest that oxidative compounds of 7-dehydrocholesterol may play a role in the pathophysiology of the disease as well.", 
    "227": "There are only limited data about the change of cholesterol levels at population level in Hungary.", 
    "228": "The aim of the authors was to compare current serum cholesterol levels to those measured 20 years ago in residents of a village in B\u00e9k\u00e9s County, Hungary.", 
    "229": "Using a database of a general ptactitioner, serum cholesterol levels of 778 persons who participated in a screening program in 1994 in the village M\u00e9hker\u00e9k in B\u00e9k\u00e9s County were compared to those obtained 20 years later from 392 randomly selected persons matching age and gender.", 
    "230": "The serum total cholesterol level of persons over 50 years was decreased by 5.9%, from 5.94\u00b11.41 to 5.59\u00b11.33 mmol/L (p\u22640.01), while it remained unchanged in persons younger than 50 years of age.", 
    "231": "The decrease of serum cholesterol level observed in patients over 50 years of age can be a consequence of the widely used lipid lowering medication. The lack of change in persons below 50 years of age draws the attention that principles of primary prevention (diet, regular physical activity) should be used more consistently, and medical therapy should be applied when it is recommended by the guidelines.", 
    "232": "This study aimed to investigate the effects of simvastatin (SVS) and atorvastatin (AVS) on the biochemical and hematological markers in patients with risk of cardiovascular diseases.", 
    "233": "One hundred and fifty outpatients were enrolled from the Department of Cardiology. Patients were treated with AVS or SVS. The lipids and hematological parameters were measured at baseline and after 4-week treatment, and the risk factors of cardiovascular diseases were recorded.", 
    "234": "After 4-week treatment, the lipids significantly changed. However, for hematological parameters, only mean platelet volume (MPV) significantly decreased after statins treatment (SVS: t = 68.748, P = 0.000; AVS: t = 39.472, P = 0.000), and the extent of decline was similar between SVS group and AVS group (t = 1.063, P = 0.289). There were no correlations between MPV and lipids. SVS and AVS had comparable effects on the lipid parameters after 4-week treatment, and there were no significant correlations of \u0394MPV with the \u0394total cholesterol, \u0394high density lipoprotein-cholesterol, \u0394low density lipoprotein-cholesterol, \u0394triglyceride, \u0394apolipoproteint A1, \u0394apolipoproteint B and \u0394lipoproteint (a) after treatments (all P > 0.05).", 
    "235": "After statins treatment, the lipids significantly change; only MPV significantly decreases among hematological parameters, but it has no relationship with lipids reduction. The synthetic atorvastatin has similar effects to native simvastatin in the management of patients with risk for cardiovascular diseases.", 
    "236": "Many studies have suggested that the regular use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including aspirin, has a protective effect and survival benefit on colorectal cancer (CRC). However, recent data suggest that CRCs have different responses to NSAIDs depending on the timing of NSAID initiation, duration of NSAID use, and molecular characteristics of the tumor. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of long-term prediagnostic aspirin use on the prognosis of stage III CRC.", 
    "237": "From 2007 to 2009, patients who were diagnosed with stage III CRC were recruited, and their medical records were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into prediagnostic aspirin users (who used aspirin for more than three months continuously before CRC diagnosis) and non-users (who did not use of aspirin and NSAIDs). The two groups were compared in terms of recurrence, cancer-specific mortality, disease-free survival (DFS), and cancer-specific survival. In an experimental study, three CRC cell lines (Caco2, SW480, and DLD-1) were pretreated with aspirin (1 mM) for four days or 28 days to make aspirin-resistant cells, treated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU; 2 \u00b5M), and apoptosis was measured with flow cytometry using Annexin-V and propidium iodide double staining.", 
    "238": "Compared with the aspirin non-users (N=565), the prediagnostic aspirin users (N=121) were not different in terms of baseline characteristics including tumor characteristics, except for comorbidities and diabetes medication and statin use, which were higher in the prediagnostic aspirin users. Recurrence and cancer-specific mortality in stage III CRC were significantly higher in prediagnostic aspirin users than non-users (46.7% vs. 32.3%, P=0.003 and 32.2% vs. 19.8%, P=0.003, respectively). Survival analysis using Cox proportional hazards modeling demonstrated that DFS was significantly worse in prediagnostic aspirin users than non-users (HR, 1.525 (1.018-2.286); P=0.041). In cell line experiments, long-term aspirin pretreatment induced an increase in 5-FU-induced apoptosis in SW480 cells compared with control treatment without aspirin pretreatment. However, Caco2 cells showed a significant decrease of apoptosis in the same experiments and no change in DLD1 cells.", 
    "239": "Prediagnostic long-term aspirin use in stage III CRC could be a negative prognostic factor depending on the characteristics of the CRC."
