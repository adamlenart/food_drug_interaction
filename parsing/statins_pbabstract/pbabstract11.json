More patients have been studied in randomized controlled trials assessing the effects of statins on outcomes than any other drug class in the history of medicine. This cumulative body of evidence documents that atherosclerosis progression is halted and coronary heart disease events are minimized when statin therapy with or without ezetimibe, and possibly proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, is used to drive down the LDL-C to a range of about 30 to 50\u00a0mg/dl. Thus far, these agents appear to be safe even when LDL-C is lowered to about 50\u00a0mg/dl, although more robust outcome and safety data are required, particularly for the PCSK9 inhibitors and very low LDL-C levels (e.g., down to 25\u00a0mg/dl). In conclusion, the current national guidelines specifying only the use of a high-potency statin without specific LDL-C goals may lead to substantial undertreatment of high-risk patients, leaving them vulnerable to future adverse cardiovascular events.",

From a total of 14,497 CKD patients, 858 statin users were paired with non-users and analyze with propensity score matching was performed. The outcomes of this study were creatinine doubling, renal death, all-cause mortality, and interactive factors for composite outcomes. Statins were prescribed to 13.5% of the study subjects. Hazard ratios (HRs) [95% confidence intervals (CIs)] for statin treatment for the doubling of serum creatinine levels were significant only in CKD patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) \u226530 mL/min/1.73 m2, and were 0.744 (0.635-0.873) in the unmatched cohort and 0.767 (0.596-0.986) in the matched cohort.

However, concerns have been raised on the added value to the health care system in terms of their costs and benefits. We assess the cost-effectiveness of PCSK9 inhibitors based on a decision-analytic model with existing clinical evidence. The model compares a lipid-lowering therapy based on statin plus PCSK9 inhibitor treatment with statin treatment only (standard therapy). From health system perspective, incremental cost per quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained are presented. From a private payer perspective, return-on-investment and net present values over patient lifespan are presented. At the current annual cost of $14,000 to $15,000, PCSK9 inhibitors are not cost-effective at an incremental cost of about $350,000 per QALY. Moreover, for every dollar invested in PCSK9 inhibitors, the private payer loses $1.98. Our study suggests that the annual treatment price should be set at $4,250 at a societal willingness-to-pay of $100,000 per QALY. However, we estimate the breakeven price for private payer is only $600 per annual treatment. At current prices, our study suggests that PCSK9 inhibitors do not add value to the U.S. health system and their provision is not profitable for private payers. To be the breakthrough drug in the fight against cardiovascular disease, the current price of PCSK9 inhibitors must be reduced by more than 70%.",

    "55": "Background The aim of the study was to evaluate the impact of compliance with lifestyle recommendations and medication on 1-year prevention of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) after trans-femoral amputation (TFA). Methods In this prospective single-center interventional cohort study, 179 consecutive T2D patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease (CAD) underwent 1-year follow-up examination after TFA in 2013. Lower limb and coronary artery CT angiography were provided before surgery; physical examination and laboratory tests were performed at baseline and every month after TFA for 1 year. A total of 77 patients (43%) were defined as compliant. They followed all recommendations, including >80% drug intake (anti-diabetic, antihypertensive drugs, dual antiplatelet and statin treatment), healthy diet, smoking cessation, physical exercise \u226530\u2009min/day. A total of 102 patients (57%) were non-compliant (drug intake \u226480%, and did not fully follow lifestyle change recommendations). Results There were no significant differences at baseline between the two groups. Fuster-BEWAT score in 1 year was 9.83\u2009\u00b1\u20093.1 in compliant and 7.74\u2009\u00b1\u20092.9 in non-compliant patients ( p\u2009=\u20090.0001). At 1-year follow-up, there were 43 myocardial infarctions (40 patients (93%) were non-compliant) and 28 deaths (26 cases (92.8%) were non-compliant). Patients from the non-compliant group with three- and two-vessel obstructive CAD had higher 1-year MACE rate than those with one-vessel obstructive and non-obstructive CAD (95.24% and 70.5% versus 17.2% and 8.6%; p\u2009<\u20090.0001); more proximal coronary lesions were related to a worse prognosis. Conclusions Non-compliant diabetic patients had a tenfold increased risk for MACE within 1 year after TFA.", 
    "56": "A recent meta-analysis demonstrated that statin therapy was associated with a risk of diabetes. The present study investigated whether the relative reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) was a good indicator of the risk of new-onset diabetes. We searched the PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register, Lilacs, Food and Drug Administration, and European Medicines Agency databases for randomized controlled trials of statins. Fourteen trials were included in the study. Eight trials with target LDL-c levels \u2264100\u2009mg/dL (2.6\u2009mmol/L) or LDL-c reductions of at least 30% were extracted separately. The results showed that the overall risk of incident diabetes increased by 11% (OR\u2009=\u20091.11; 95% CI 1.03-1.20). The group with intensive LDL-c-lowering statin had an 18% increase in the likelihood of developing diabetes (OR\u2009=\u20091.18; 95% CI, 1.10-1.28). Furthermore, the risks of incident diabetes were 13% (OR\u2009=\u20091.13; 95% CI 1.01-1.26) and 29% (OR\u2009=\u20091.29; 95% CI 1.13-1.47) in the subgroups with 30-40% and 40-50% reductions in LDL-c, respectively, suggesting that LDL-c reduction may provide a dynamic risk assessment parameter for new-onset diabetes. In conclusion, LDL-c reduction is positively related to the risk of new-onset diabetes. When LDL-c is reduced by more than 30% during lipid-lowering therapy, blood glucose monitoring is suggested to detect incident diabetes in high-risk populations.",

We sought to quantify the real-world impact of different statin exposure patterns on clinical outcomes in Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia. We conducted a retrospective cohort study among hospitalized patients with positive S. aureus blood cultures receiving appropriate antibiotics within 48 h of culture collection (Veterans Affairs hospitals, 2002 to 2013). Three statin exposure groups were compared to nonusers: pretreated statin users initiating therapy in the 30 days prior to culture and either (i) continuing statin therapy after culture or (ii) not continuing after culture, and (iii) de novo users initiating at culture. Nonusers included patients without statins in the year prior to culture through discharge. Propensity score-matched Cox proportional hazards regression models were developed. We were able to balance significantly different baseline characteristics using propensity score matching for pretreated without continuation (n = 331), pretreated with continuation (n = 141), and de novo (n = 177) statin users compared to nonusers. We observed a significantly lower 30-day mortality rate (hazard ratio [HR], 0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.25 to 0.84; number needed to treat [NNT], 10) among pretreated and continued statin users, while protective effects were not observed in de novo (HR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.60 to 1.82; NNT, undefined) or pretreated but not continued (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.64 to 1.32; NNT, 47) users. In our national cohort study among patients with S. aureus bacteremia, continuation of statin therapy among incident statin users was associated with significant beneficial effects on mortality, including a 54% lower 30-day mortality rate.",

Statin therapy has been shown to modulate MMPs and TIMP-1 levels, but clinical findings have not been conclusive. This study aimed to systematically review the clinical findings on the impact of statin therapy on plasma MMP-9, MMP-3, and TIMP-1 levels and calculate an effect size for the mentioned effect through a meta-analysis of available data. A total of 10 eligible studies with 11 treatment arms were included in the meta-analysis. Statin therapy had no significant effect on plasma MMP-9 (standardized mean difference [SMD]: -0.23, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.69 to 0.24, P = .345) nor MMP-3 concentrations (SMD: -0.004, 95% CI: -0.60 to 0.59, P = .990). However, meta-analysis demonstrated that statin therapy significantly decreases plasma TIMP-1 levels (SMD: -0.30, 95% CI: -0.56 to -0.03, P = .029). Random-effects meta-regression indicated that neither treatment duration nor changes in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels are associated with changes in plasma MMP-9 levels following statin therapy. The results of the present meta-analysis suggested a significant reduction in plasma concentrations of TIMP-1, but not MMP-9 and MMP-3, following statin therapy.",

Therefore there is still a need for new and effective oral agents in the combination therapy of lipid disorders. Areas covered: The review covers the current state of knowledge on the mechanism of action of bempedoic acid (ETC-1002) and results from recent clinical studies. Expert opinion: ETC-1002 is a novel oral lipid-lowering therapy. The reduction of both low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) demonstrated by ETC-1002 in clinical trials suggests that agent may have the potential for CV risk reduction. Adverse effects of current lipid-lowering agents can be dose-limiting, and combination approaches to lipid-lowering may often be utilized for optimal CV risk reduction. Because of this, new lipid-modulating drugs are urgently required. ETC-1002 has a unique mechanism of action (adenosine triphosphate-citrate lyase inhibition). It has been shown to be safe in combination with statins as well as ezetimibe, and appears to effectively lower LDL-C and has the potential to reduce the risk of muscle-related adverse events, which can limit the utilization and effectiveness of statin therapy.",

In this study, we aimed to develop simvastatin-loaded crosslinked alginate-pectin hydrogel films by ionic crosslinking to improve the mechanical characteristics, wound fluid uptake and drug release behavior. Alginate-pectin hydrocolloid films were chemically crosslinked by immersing in different concentrations of CaCl2 (0.5-3% w/v) for 2-20min. The degree of crosslinking was influenced by both contact time and CaCl2 concentration. The optimized conditions for crosslinking were 0.5% and 1% (CaCl2) for 2min. The optimized hydrogel films were then characterized for their physical, mechanical, morphological, thermal, in vitro drug release, and cytocompatibility profiles. Crosslinking improved the mechanical profile and wound fluid uptake capacity of dressings. The hydrogel films were able to maintain their physical integrity during use, and the best results were obtained with the film in which the extent of crosslinking was low (0.5%).

Anti-miR-29b or overexpression of PA200 abolished lovastatin-induced inhibition of proteasome activity in HUVECs. In contrast, pre-miR-29b or PA200 siRNA mimics these effects of lovastatin on proteasome activity. Lovastatin inhibited oxidative stress induced by multiple oxidants including ox-LDL, H2O2, TNF\u03b1, homocysteine thiolactone (HTL), and high glucose (HG), which were reversed by inhibition of miR-29b in HUVECs. Ex vivo analysis indicated that lovastatin normalized the acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation and the redox status in isolated rat aortic arteries exposure to multiple cardiovascular risk factors. In vivo analysis revealed that administration of lovastatin remarkably suppressed oxidative stress and prevented endothelial dysfunction in rats with hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, and hyperhomocysteinemia, as well as increased miR-29b expressions, reduced PA200 protein levels, and suppression of proteasome activity in aortic tissues.",

Areas covered: The authors critically review the current evidence on the efficacy and safety of bococizumab, a humanized mAb against PCSK9, which was surprisingly discontinued in November 2016. The pharmacokinetic profile and the biological features of bococizumab vs others mAbs are also discussed. As of now, in adjunct to diet, alirocumab and evolocumab are the only approved PCSK9 mAbs for the treatment of adult patients with severe clinical atherosclerotic CVD already at maximally-tolerated statin therapy and require additional LDL-C lowering. Expert opinion: Although discontinued, data from a phase 2b trial show the effectiveness of bococizumab in lowering LDL-C in a similar way to the two available PCSK9 antagonists. However, some peculiar biological characteristics of bococizumab may explain the attenuation of LDL-C lowering over time, as well as a higher rate of immunogenicity and of injection-site reactions.",

In mice, liver-specific Acly deficiency protects from hepatic steatosis and dyslipidemia, whereas adipose tissue-specific Acly deletion has no phenotype, supporting therapeutic inhibition of ACLY. A lipid-regulating compound, bempedoic acid, was discovered to potently inhibit ACLY, and in animal models, it prevents dyslipidemia and attenuates atherosclerosis. Phase 2 clinical trials revealed that bempedoic acid effectively lowers LDL-C as monotherapy, combined with ezetimibe, added to statin therapy and in statin-intolerant hypercholesterolemic patients.",

Of the remaining two major fractions, recent studies have found that HDL cholesterol is not likely to be a causal particle in atherogenesis, and have instead shifted the causal focus to triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Subsequent results are refining this view to suggest that triglycerides themselves might not be causal, but instead may be a surrogate for the causal cholesterol content within this fraction. Other studies have used a similar approach to address the association between lipid fractions and risk of type 2 diabetes. Beyond genetic variation in the target of statin medications, reduced LDL cholesterol associated with multiple genes encoding current or prospective drug targets associated with increased diabetic risk. In addition, genetically lower HDL cholesterol and genetically lower triglycerides both appear to increase risk of type 2 diabetes.",

    "134": "Niacin is a well established drug used to lower cholesterol and prevent cardiovascular disease events. However, niacin also causes cutaneous flushing side effects due to release of the proresolution mediator prostaglandin D2 (PGD2). Recent randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that addition of niacin with laropiprant [a PGD2 receptor subtype 1 (DP1) blocker] to statin-based therapies does not significantly decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease events, but increases the risk of serious adverse events. Here, we tested whether, and how, niacin beneficial effects on myocardial ischemia require the activation of the PGD2/DP1 axis. Myocardial infarction (MI) was reproduced by ligation of the left anterior descending branch of the coronary artery in mice. We found that niacin increased PGD2 release in macrophages and shifted macrophages to M2 polarization both in vitro and in vivo by activation of DP1 and accelerated inflammation resolution in zymosan-induced peritonitis in mice. Moreover, niacin treatment facilitated wound healing and improved cardiac function after MI through DP1-mediated M2 bias and timely resolution of inflammation in infarcted hearts. In addition, we found that niacin intake also stimulated M2 polarization of peripheral monocytes in humans. Collectively, niacin promoted cardiac functional recovery after ischemic myocardial infarction through DP1-mediated M2 polarization and timely resolution of inflammation in hearts. These results indicated that DP1 inhibition may attenuate the cardiovascular benefits of niacin.",

GGDPS inhibition is of interest from a therapeutic perspective for multiple myeloma because we have shown that targeting Rab GTPase geranylgeranylation impairs monoclonal protein trafficking, leading to endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis. We reported a series of triazole bisphosphonate GGDPS inhibitors, of which the most potent was a 3:1 mixture of homogeranyl (HG) and homoneryl (HN) isomers. Here we determined the activity of the individual olefin isomers. Enzymatic and cellular assays revealed that although HN is approximately threefold more potent than HG, HN is not more potent than the original mixture. Studies in which cells were treated with varying concentrations of each isomer alone and in different combinations revealed that the two isomers potentiate the induced-inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation when used in a 3:1 HG:HN combination. A synergistic interaction was observed between the two isomers in the GGDPS enzyme assay. These results suggested that the two isomers bind simultaneously to the enzyme but within different domains. Computational modeling studies revealed that HN is preferred at the FDP site, that HG is preferred at the GGDP site, and that both isomers may bind to the enzyme simultaneously. These studies are the first to report a set of olefin isomers that synergistically inhibit GGDPS, thus establishing a new paradigm for the future development of GGDPS inhibitors.", 
    "136": "The statins have been used for 30 years to prevent coronary artery disease and stroke. Their primary mechanism of action is the lowering of serum cholesterol through inhibiting hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis thereby upregulating the hepatic low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors and increasing the clearance of LDL-cholesterol. Statins may exert cardiovascular protective effects that are independent of LDL-cholesterol lowering called pleiotropic effects. Because statins inhibit the production of isoprenoid intermediates in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, the post-translational prenylation of small GTP-binding proteins such as Rho and Rac, and their downstream effectors such as Rho kinase and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidases are also inhibited. In cell culture and animal studies, these effects alter the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, the stability of atherosclerotic plaques, the production of proinflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species, the reactivity of platelets, and the development of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis. The relative contributions of statin pleiotropy to clinical outcomes, however, remain a matter of debate and are hard to quantify because the degree of isoprenoid inhibition by statins correlates to some extent with the amount of LDL-cholesterol reduction. This review examines some of the currently proposed molecular mechanisms for statin pleiotropy and discusses whether they could have any clinical relevance in cardiovascular disease.",

PCSK9 functions as a negative control or feedback for the cell surface receptors for low-density lipoprotein including its component of cholesterol (LDL-C). The initial and key findings were that different abnormalities of PCSK9 can result in an increase or a decrease of LDL-C because of more or less suppression of cell surface receptors. These observations gave hints and awoke interest that it might be possible to prepare monoclonal antibodies to PCSK9 and decrease its activity, after which there should be more active LDL-C cell receptors. The rest is a fascinating story that currently has resulted in two PCSK9 inhibitors, alirocumab and evolocumab, which, on average, decrease LDL-C approximately 50%. Nevertheless, if there are no contraindications, statins remain the standard of prevention for the high-risk CV patient and this includes both secondary and primary prevention. The new inhibitors are for the patient that does not attain the desired target for LDL-C reduction while taking a maximum statin dose or who does not tolerate any statin dose whatsoever. Atherosclerosis can be considered a metabolic disease and the clinician needs to realize this and think more and more of CV prevention.

FAST-MI 2010 is a nationwide French registry including 3,079 patients with AMI, among whom 1,062 patients had a history of cardiovascular atherosclerotic disease and 498 patients had a history of MI. Overall, patients with a history of atherosclerotic disease (or MI) were older compared with patients without known cardiovascular disease (71 \u00b1 13 vs 63 \u00b1 14\u00a0years) and had higher cardiovascular risk profiles and co-morbidities.

Atorvastatin (ATO) possesses anti\u2011inflammatory properties and has been demonstrated to exert protective effects against renal IR injury (IRI). However, the underlying mechanism requires further study. In the present study, a rat model of renal IRI was successfully established. Consistent with the results of a previous study, ATO significantly attenuated IRI, which was supported by a decrease in serum creatinine and an increase in creatinine clearance rate, as well as alleviated pathological alterations in renal tubular cells. There are two types of activated macrophages: Proinflammatory M1 and anti\u2011inflammatory M2 macrophages, which have been demonstrated to exert contributory and protective effects on IRI, respectively. The present study demonstrated that treatment with ATO significantly decreased M1 macrophage density and increased M2 macrophage density, as compared with the IR group. In addition, it is well known that M1 macrophages can be induced by T\u00a0helper\u00a01 cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u2011\u03b1 and interferon (IFN)\u2011\u03b3, whereas M2 macrophages can be induced by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)\u2011\u03b3. The present study indicated that ATO treatment significantly decreased the expression levels of TNF\u2011\u03b1 and IFN\u2011\u03b3, and increased PPAR\u2011\u03b3 expression. In conclusion, ATO may ameliorate renal IRI by promoting M1\u2011M2 transition. Furthermore, ATO\u2011mediated macrophage polarization in rats with renal IRI may be associated with the downregulation of TNF\u2011\u03b1 and IFN\u2011\u03b3, and the upregulation of PPAR-\u03b3.",

MTT was used to evaluate cellular viability. The gross morphology and microstructure of the myotubes were observed with a light and electron microscope, respectively. The intracellular calcium concentrations ([Ca(2+)]i) at rest and in response to caffeine and halothane were investigated by fluorescence calcium imaging. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) test.Results Simvastatin (0.01-5.0 \u03bcmol/L) decreased myotube viability, changed their morphological features and microstructure, and increased the resting [Ca(2+)]i in a dose-dependent manner. Simvastatin did not change myotube's sensitivity to low doses of caffeine (0.625-2.5 mmol/L) or halothane (1.0-5.0 mmol/L). In response to high-dose caffeine (10.0 mmol/L, 20.0 mmol/L) and halothane (20.0 mmol/L, 40.0 mmol/L), myotubes treated with 0.01 \u03bcmol/L simvastatin showed a significant increase in sensitivity, but those treated with 1.0 \u03bcmol/L and 5.0 \u03bcmol/L simvastatin showed a significant decrease. The sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) storage peaked in the myotubes treated with 0.01 \u03bcmol/L simvastatin, but it decreased when cells were treated with higher doses of simvastatin (0.1-5.0 \u03bcmol/L).Conclusions The myotoxic side effect of simvastatin was found to change the sensitivity of myotubes in response to high-dose caffeine and halothane. When dose was low, sensitivity increased mainly because of increased Ca(2+) content in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which might explain why some individuals with statin-induced myotoxic symptoms may show positive caffeine-halothane contracture test results. However, when the dose was high and the damage to the myotubes was severer, sensitivity was lower. It is here supposed that the damage itself might put individuals with statin-induced myotoxic symptoms at greater risks of presenting with rhabdomyolysis during surgery or while under anesthesia.",

Despite these overall neutral results, we continued to find evidence that fenofibrate therapy effectively reduced CVD in study participants with dyslipidemia, defined as triglyceride levels greater than 204 mg/dL and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels less than 34 mg/dL (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.56-0.95).",

    "232": "Statins are hypocholesterolemic drugs that are prescribed for patients with an increased risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications. Ezetimibe has an atheroprotective activity through inhibition of the expression of vascular adhesion molecule-I and vascular CD14, a marker of the infiltration of mononuclear leukocytes. Ezetimibe reduces the amount of chemoattractant protein-1 that is available for monocytes and macrophages and alters the activity of nuclear factor \u03baB in leukocytes. The mechanisms of action of statins complement those of ezetimibe. Previous studies have demonstrated that the combination of statins and ezetimibe has beneficial effects, including antiinflammatory activity. The present study evaluated the effects of monotherapy with ezetimibe and simvastatin compared with ezetimibe\u2009+\u2009simvastatin combined on the evolution of the inflammatory response in a rat model of Complete Freund's Adjuvant-induced arthritis.

The data were analyzed using paired t tests or analysis of variance followed by Bonferroni post hoc test. The treatments reduced leukocyte rolling behavior and leukocyte adhesion. The monotherapies did not change the number of leukocytes that were recruited to the knee joint cavity, whereas the ezetimibe\u2009+\u2009simvastatin combination significantly reduced this parameter. The treatments reduced the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and increased the levels of the antiinflammatory cytokine IL-10, indicating antiinflammatory properties of these drugs in this experimental model of inflammation.",

However, available results from longer-term studies suggest that a degenerative process is unveiled, and continues to occur, even when neovascularization is controlled. Furthermore, anti-VEGF therapy may play a role in the development of atrophic changes. We have proposed using neuroprotection to prevent atrophy, and multiple models of retinal degeneration have shown that it is necessary to block both apoptotic and necrotic cell death pathways. Despite the success of anti-VEGF therapy and the promise of neuroprotection, neither addresses the underlying cause of AMD. It has been postulated that in early AMD, the retention and abnormal accumulation of lipids in Bruch's membrane and below the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) lead to drusen. Thus, it is conceivable to target the retained lipoproteins and seek to remove them. In a case study and pilot multicenter clinical trial, we observed significant regression of drusen and an improvement in visual acuity in patients taking high-dose statin therapy. These results, though preliminary, warrant further investigation.",

    "242": "Hepatocellular carcinoma\u00a0(HCC) represents approximately\u00a085% of all primary liver cancer cases. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease\u00a0(NAFLD) is one of the risk factors for HCC. NAFLD occurs in patients with components of metabolic syndrome, such as type\u00a02 diabetes mellitus, obesity, hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Therefore, hyperlipidemia also represents a patient population at risk for HCC that can readily be identified. Rosuvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme\u00a0A\u00a0(HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, has exhibited a more potent affinity for the active site of HMG-CoA reductase than other statins. In addition, the hepatic uptake of rosuvastatin in rats has been found to be more selective and efficient than that with other drugs. Furthermore, the cytoprotective effects of rosuvastatin against ischemic injury have been clearly reported. Thus, in this study, we aimed to determine the role of rosuvastatin as a preventive drug in HCC associated with NAFLD. STAM mice, which developed HCC from NAFLD by being fed a high-fat diet\u00a0(HFD), were divided into a group in which a HFD was given to the mice for 15\u00a0weeks\u00a0(n=8) and another in which a HFD supplemented with 0.00125%\u00a0rosuvastatin was given to the mice for 15\u00a0weeks\u00a0(n=8). Rosuvastatin inhibited the development of hepatic tumors in the mice with NAFLD induced by a specific diet both macroscopically and histologically. Rosuvastatin significantly decreased the expression levels of pro-inflammatry cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor\u00a0(TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin\u00a0(IL)-6 and transforming growth factor\u00a0(TGF)-\u03b21. Tumor aggressiveness is mediated by angiogenic factors. Therefore, we examined the hepatic mRNA expression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor\u00a0(VEGFR), epidermal growth factor receptor\u00a0(EGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor\u00a0(PDGF). The hepatic expression of these factors significantly decreased in the rousvastin-fed mice. Our results thus suggest rosuvastatin that prevents carcinogenesis and improves the hepatic background. Our data suggest that rosuvastatin has potential for use as a preventive drug for the development of HCC associated with NAFLD in mice.",

The microparticles prepared by ionic gelation method with varying composition of chitosan and surfactants (Tween 80/Pluronic F-127) were optimized for entrapment efficiency, morphology and drug-polymer interactions. Microparticles prepared with 0.3% between 80 and 0.5:5 chitosan: drug ratio showed maximum entrapment efficiency of 82% with spherical morphology and mild interaction between drug and chitosan. 5% PVA solutions loaded with pure drug and drug loaded microparticles at three different doses (2.5mg, 5mg and 10mg equivalent of drug) were chemically cross linked using gluteraldehyde and HCl. The formulated hydrogels were optimized for swelling, in vitro release behavior and in vivo wound healing effect. Hydrogels containing 2.5mg equivalent dose of Simvastatin microparticles exhibited maximum cumulative percentage drug release of 92% (n=3) at the end of 7days. The in vitro drug release data was supported by the higher swelling index of the low dose hydrogels. The in vivo wound healing study was performed using Wistar rats (n=30, 5 groups with 6 animals in each group) for the formulated hydrogels (at 3 doses) and compared with the untreated animals and the positive control group treated with conventional topical Simvastatin ointment (1%). The wound healing effect was comparable to the in vitro results, wherein the animals treated with low dose hydrogels (replaced every 7days) exhibited considerable reduction in the wound area compared to medium and high dose hydrogels. Statistically significant difference (P<0.05) was observed in the wound area of the animals treated with low dose hydrogels compared to 1% ointment and untreated animals, as estimated by two-way ANOVA. The histopathology images of the different groups of animals also displayed the comparative changes in the wound healing process. Hence, the incorporation of Simvastatin-chitosan microparticles in PVA hydrogels has demonstrated significant wound healing efficiency at optimum dose.",

Cholesterol, especially LDL-cholesterol plays a key role in the formation of atherosclerotic plaques. It has been verified recently that escalating incidence and mortality of cerebrovascular diseases are proportional to increased levels of LDL-cholesterol. Statin therapy undeniably reduces the risk of stroke, however other methods for decreasing lipid levels have not been proved significantly effective. Preventive effect of high-dose statin treatment is without doubt, although administration of such high dosage might require special precautions for patients with prior intracerebral hemorrhage and it also risks development of incident diabetes. The recently published IMPROVE-IT study is the first to prove that the addition of ezetimibe as a non-statin type drug, to statin treatment contributes to further reduction of LDL-cholesterol. The combination treatment results in additional decrease in the incidence and mortality of cerebrovascular events, without any expansion in the number or adverse effects. These results confirm the importance of any further reduction of LDL-cholesterol levels. Achieving target values with statin-ezetimibe combination allows administration of low to moderate dose of statin, which decreases risks of adverse effects related to high-dose statin therapy. Orv.

Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups: control (Group C), diabetes (Group D), diabetes with insulin (Group I), and diabetes with insulin and fluvastatin (Group I+F). Diabetes was induced by a single injection of streptozotocin (65\u00a0mg/kg). After 8\u00a0weeks, the hearts were extracted following echocardiographic evaluation.

    "248": "Statins are a main curbstone in the prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD), pandemic in 21st century. CVD displays evident sex and gender differences, not only in clinical manifestation and outcomes but also in pharmacological treatment. Whether statin therapy should be differentially prescribed according to sex is a matter of debate. Aside a different pharmacological action, statins are not proven to be less effective in one gender comparing to the other, nor to be less safe. Nevertheless, up to date evidence shows that statins have not been adequately tested in women, especially in primary prevention trials. Since data-lacking, making a treatment decision on women is potentially harmful, although female individuals represent the majority of the population and they have a greater lifetime CVD risk. Therefore, adequately powered randomized control trials with longer follow-up are warranted to establish if a benefit on CV events and mortality prevention exists in both sexes. The aim of the present review is to summarize the sex and gender differences in statin use: it raises concerns and updates perspectives towards an evidence-based and sex-tailored prevention of CVD management.",

Some studies suggest the use of statins, which inhibit cholesterol synthesis in humans and also the initial processes of isoprenoid biosynthesis in the parasite. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the activity of the statins pravastatin and simvastatin in HeLa cells infected in vitro with the RH strain of T. gondii. HeLa cells (1\u00d710(5)) were infected with T. gondii tachyzoites (5\u00d710(5)) following two different treatment protocols. In the first protocol, T. gondii tachyzoites were pretreated with pravastatin (50 and 100\u03bcg/mL) and simvastatin (1.56 and 3.125\u03bcg/mL) for 30min prior to infection. In the second, HeLa cells were first infected (5\u00d710(5)) with tachyzoites and subsequently treated with pravastatin and simvastatin for 24h at the concentrations noted above. Initially, we evaluated the cytotoxicity of drugs by the MTT assay, number of tachyzoites adhered to cells, number of infected cells, and viability of tachyzoites by trypan blue exclusion. The supernatant of the cell cultures was collected post-treatment for determination of the pattern of Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokines by cytometric bead array. There was no cytotoxicity to HeLa cells with 50 and 100\u03bcg/mL pravastatin and 1.56 and 3.125\u03bcg/mL simvastatin. There was no change in the viability of tachyzoites that received pretreatment. Regarding the pre- and post-treatment of the cells with pravastatin and simvastatin alone, there was a reduction in adhesion, invasion and proliferation of cells to T. gondii. As for the production of cytokines, we found that IL-6 and IL-17 were significantly reduced in cells infected with T. gondii and treated with pravastatin and simvastatin, when compared to control. Based on these results, we can infer that pravastatin and simvastatin alone possess antiproliferative effects on tachyzoites forms of T. gondii, giving these drugs new therapeutic uses.",
