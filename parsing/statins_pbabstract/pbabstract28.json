The phase 3 studies included administration in the home-use and in-clinic settings but did not specifically evaluate the feasibility of home-use administration. Two clinical studies enrolled patients with hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia on statin therapy and with/without ezetimibe received evolocumab in the home-use setting. Patients were randomized to self-administer evolocumab using one of two injection devices biweekly over 6\u00a0weeks (autoinjector or prefilled syringe; n\u00a0=\u00a0149; ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01849497) or monthly over 12\u00a0weeks (autoinjector or automated minidoser; n\u00a0=\u00a0164; NCT01879319). The first self-administration occurred in the in-clinic setting, and two more were performed in the at-home setting. Patients were successful in self-administering evolocumab in the home-use setting in approximately 95\u00a0% of attempts and experienced LDL-C reductions from baseline to week 6 or the mean of weeks 10 and 12 of approximately 65\u00a0%. Rates of successful self-administration and LDL-C reduction were similar across dosing schedules and study devices. Adverse events were similar between randomized groups and generally mild in severity. In two clinical studies, therefore, patients were able to successfully self-administer evolocumab in both the in-clinic and at-home settings regardless of which dosing schedule or device they used.",

    "16": "Background Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials suggest that treatment with hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) lowers the risk of incident venous thrombosis (VT), particularly among those without prevalent clinical cardiovascular disease (CVD). Whether this is true for the prevention of recurrent VT is debated. We used an observational inception cohort to estimate the association of current statin use with the risk of recurrent VT. Methods and Results The study setting was a large healthcare organization with detailed medical record and pharmacy information at cohort entry and throughout follow-up. We followed 2798 subjects 18-89 years of age who experienced a validated incident VT between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2010, for a first recurrent VT, validated by medical record review. During follow-up, 457 (16%) developed a first recurrent VT. In time-to-event models incorporating time-varying statin use and adjusting for potential confounders, current statin use was associated with a 26% lower risk of recurrent VT: hazard ratio 0.74, 95% confidence interval 0.59-0.94. Among cohort members free of CVD (n = 2134), current statin use was also associated with a lower risk (38%) of recurrent VT: hazard ratio 0.62, 95% confidence interval 0.45-0.85. We found similar results when restricting to new users of statins and in subgroups of different statin types and doses. Conclusions In a population-based cohort of subjects who had experienced an incident VT, statin use, compared with nonuse, was associated with a clinically relevant lower risk of recurrent VT. These findings suggest a potential secondary benefit of statins among patients who have experienced an incident VT.",

    "21": "Regulation of cholesterol (Chol) homeostasis is controlled by three main fluxes, i.e. intestinal absorption, de novo synthesis (ChS) and catabolism, predominantly as bile acid synthesis (BAS). High serum total Chol and LDL-Chol concentrations in particular are considered risk factors and markers for the development of atherosclerosis. Pharmaceutical treatments to lower serum Chol have focused on reducing absorption or ChS and increasing BAS. Monitoring of these three parameters is complex involving isotope techniques, cholesterol balance experiments and advanced mass spectrometry based analysis methods. Surrogate markers were explored that require only one single fasting blood sample collection. These markers were validated in specific, mostly physiological conditions and during statin treatment to inhibit ChS. They were also applied under cholesterol absorption restriction, but were not validated in this condition. We retrospectively evaluated the use of serum campesterol (Camp), sitosterol (Sit) and cholestanol (Cholol) as markers for cholesterol absorption, lathosterol (Lath) as marker for ChS and 7\u03b1-hydroxycholesterol (7\u03b1-OH-Ch) and 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OH-Ch) as markers for BAS under conditions of Chol absorption restriction. Additionally, their values were corrected for Chol concentration (R_sterol or oxysterols).",

Relative or fractional Chol absorption (FrChA) was measured with the continuous feeding stable isotope procedure, ChS and BAS with the cholesterol balance method. The daily Chol intake (DICh) was inventoried and the daily Chol absorption (DACh) calculated.", 
    "23": "Monitoring cholesterol absorption, R_Camp, R_Sit and R_Cholol responded sensitively to changes in FrChA. R_Camp correlated well with FrChA in all omnivore treatment groups and in the vegan group. R_Camp confirmed reduced FrChA under EZE treatment and reduced DACh in the vegan subjects. R_Sit and R_Cholol did not accurately reflect FrChA or DACh in all situations. Monitoring endogenous cholesterol synthesis, R_Lath correlated with ChS in the vegan group, but in none of the omnivore treatment groups. R_Lath confirmed increased ChS under EZE treatment and was reduced under SIMVA treatment, while ChS was not. An increased ChS under EZE+SIMVA treatment could not be confirmed with R_Lath. R_Lath responded very insensitively to a change in ChS. Monitoring BAS, R_7\u03b1-OH-Ch but not R_27-OH-Ch correlated with BAS during PLAC, EZE and SIMVA treatments. In line with BAS, R_7\u03b1-OH-Ch did not differ in any of the omnivore treatment groups. R_7\u03b1-OH-Ch responded insensitively to a change in BAS.", 
    "24": "Under Chol absorption restriction, serum R_Camp is a sensitive and valid marker to monitor FrChA in a population with a normal DICh. Also, major changes in DACh can be detected in vegans. Serum R_Lath does not reflect ChS measured with the cholesterol balance method during EZE treatment. This result initiates the question whether the measured ChS reflects pure de novo synthesis. Serum R_7\u03b1-OH-Ch appears to be a valid but insensitive marker for BAS.",

    "26": "The bile salt export pump (BSEP) is expressed on the canalicular membrane of hepatocytes regulating liver bile salt excretion, and impairment of BSEP function may lead to cholestasis in humans. This study explored drug biliary excretion, as well as serum chemistry, individual bile acid concentrations and liver transporter expressions, in the SAGE Bsep knockout (KO) rat model. It was observed that the Bsep protein in KO rats was decreased to 15% of that in the wild type (WT), as quantified using LC-MS/MS. While the levels of Ntcp and Mrp2 were not significantly altered, Mrp3 expression increased and Oatp1a1 decreased in KO animals. Compared with the WT rats, the KO rats had similar serum chemistry and showed normal liver transaminases. Although the total plasma bile salts and bile flow were not significantly changed in Bsep KO rats, individual bile acids in plasma and liver demonstrated variable changes, indicating the impact of Bsep KO. Following an intravenous dose of deuterium labeled taurocholic acid (D4-TCA, 2\u00a0mg/kg), the D4-TCA plasma exposure was higher and bile excretion was delayed by approximately 0.5\u00a0h in the KO rats. No differences were observed for the pravastatin plasma concentration-time profile or the biliary excretion after intravenous administration (1\u00a0mg/kg). Collectively, the results revealed that these rats have significantly lower Bsep expression, therefore affecting the biliary excretion of endogenous bile acids and Bsep substrates. However, these rats are able to maintain a relatively normal liver function through the remaining Bsep protein and via the regulation of other transporters.

Very recently, a motif-based sequence database mining approach resulted in the identification of 37 novel halohydrin dehalogenase enzymes, many of them exhibiting only low sequence similarity to previously known halohydrin dehalogenases. In an attempt to explore the biocatalytic potential of these newly identified enzymes, 17 representatives from all six phylogenetic subtypes were heterologously produced in Escherichia coli, purified and characterized to determine their substrate scopes in the dehalogenation and epoxide ring-opening reaction. Several enzymes with broad substrate spectra were identified exhibiting high activities towards a selection of typical substrates. Moreover, four halohydrin dehalogenases were found to be significantly more thermostable than the\u00a0previously known HheC from Agrobacterium radiobacter AD1. Investigation of the enzymes' stereoselectivity in the dehalogenation of racemic 2-chloro-1-phenylethanol revealed that their stereopreference correlates with the phylogenetic placing of the enzymes in subtypes A through G. Furthermore, the biocatalytic potential of these novel halohydrin dehalogenases was investigated in the preparation of ethyl 4-cyano-3-hydroxybutyrate, a statin side-chain precursor. Though none of the active enzymes selectively formed the required (R)-enantiomer, several halohydrin dehalogenases were identified with significantly higher activity in the conversion compared to HheC, making them promising candidates for this industrially relevant reaction.",

A recent study demonstrated that NPC1L1 plays an important role in absorption of fat-soluble vitamins including vitamin K. We evaluated whether the add-on treatment of ezetimibe affects anticoagulation in patients taking warfarin. Between October 2007 and March 2015, the administration of ezetimibe was started to a total of 101 outpatients who were already on oral anticoagulation with warfarin. We retrospectively analyzed blood lipid levels, prothrombin time international normalized ratio (PT-INR) and time in therapeutic INR range (TTR). Seventy-one patients (70\u00a0%) showed increase in PT-INR after ezetimibe treatment (1.96\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.45 to 2.20\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.61, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). It was necessary to reduce the warfarin dose in 9 of 101 patients for clinical indication. There was a significant positive correlation between change in PT-INR and statin usage at baseline (p\u00a0=\u00a00.03).

    "73": "Statins are inhibitors of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, an enzyme necessary for the production of mevalonate. They are widely used as cholesterol-lowering drugs. However, conflicting data about the effect of statins on neuronal cells has been published. To explore the effect of simvastatin on spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs), SG explants of 5-day-old rats were treated with increasing concentrations of simvastatin. In addition, SG explants were treated with mevalonate and with the combination of simvastatin and mevalonate. SGN number, length of the neurites, area of nonneuronal supporting cells, and neuronal survival were analyzed. Simvastatin treatment results in a significant dose-dependent decrease of SG neurite number, length of neurites, area of supporting cells, and SG neuronal survival compared to control. Interestingly, treatment with mevalonate in addition to simvastatin increased SG neuronal survival compared to simvastatin treatment only. However, treatment with mevalonate in addition to simvastatin did not influence SG neurite number, length of neurites, and area of supporting cells compared to simvastatin treatment only. Our results suggest a neurotoxic effect of simvastatin on SGNs in vitro. Neurotoxicity seems to be at least partially mediated by the mevalonate pathway. Therefore, caution is warranted to use simvastatin as a potential otoprotective drug.",

Here, we aimed to elucidate the mechanism through which ER\u03b1 influences proliferation in breast cancer cells. Our results show that ER\u03b1 protein is cell cycle-regulated in human breast cancer cells and that the presence of 17-\u03b2-estradiol (E2) in the culture medium shortened the cell cycle significantly (by 4.5\u00a0hours, P < 0.05) compared with unliganded conditions. The alterations in cell cycle duration were observed in the S and G2/M phases, whereas the G1 phase was indistinguishable under liganded and unliganded conditions. In addition, ER\u03b1 knockdown in MCF-7 cells accelerated mitotic exit, whereas transfection of ER\u03b1-negative MDA-MB-231 cells with exogenous ER\u03b1 significantly shortened the S and G2/M phases (by 9.1\u00a0hours, P < 0.05) compared with parental cells. Finally, treatment of MCF-7 cells with antiestrogens revealed that tamoxifen yields a slower cell cycle progression through the S and G2/M phases than fulvestrant does, presumably because of the destabilizing effect of fulvestrant on ER\u03b1 protein. Together, these results show that ER\u03b1 modulates breast cancer cell proliferation by regulating events during the S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle in a ligand-dependent fashion. These results provide the rationale for an effective treatment strategy that includes a cell cycle inhibitor in combination with a drug that lowers estrogen levels, such as an aromatase inhibitor, and an antiestrogen that does not result in the degradation of ER\u03b1, such as tamoxifen.",

The aim of the present study was to provide data on the relationship between premature CVD mortality, statin utilization as a preventive medication and socioeconomic deprivation at the district level in Hungary. As a conceptually new approach, the prescription of statins, the prescription redemption and the ratio between redemption and prescription rates were also investigated. The number of prescriptions for statins and the number of redeemed statin prescriptions were obtained from the National Health Insurance Fund Administration of Hungary for each primary healthcare practice for the entire year of 2012. The data were aggregated at the district level. To define the frequency of prescription and of redemption, the denominator was the number of the 40+-year-old population adjusted by the rates of 60+-year-old population of the district. The standardized mortality rates, frequency of statin prescriptions, redeemed statin prescriptions, and ratios for compliance in relation to the national average were mapped using the \"disease mapping\" option, and their association with deprivation (tertile of deprivation index as a district-based categorical covariate) was defined using the risk analysis capabilities within the Rapid Inquiry Facility. The risk analysis showed a significant positive association between deprivation and the relative risk of premature cardiovascular mortality, and a reverse J-shaped association between the relative frequency of statin prescriptions and deprivation. Districts with the highest deprivation showed a low relative frequency of statin prescriptions; however, significantly higher primary compliance (redemption) was observed in districts with the highest deprivation. Our data clearly indicate that insufficient statin utilization is strongly linked to the so-called physician-factor, i.e., a statin prescription. Consequently, statin treatment is poor and represents a significant barrier to reducing mortality, particularly among people living in highly deprived areas of the country.",

The primary hypothesis of this randomized parallel trial was that treatment with 80\u200amg/day of atorvastatin administered early at admission after acute atherosclerotic ischemic stroke could reduce serum levels of markers of immune-inflammatory activation of the acute phase and that this immune-inflammatory modulation could have a possible effect on prognosis of ischemic stroke evaluated by some outcome indicators. We enrolled 42 patients with acute ischemic stroke classified as large arteries atherosclerosis stroke (LAAS) randomly assigned in a randomized parallel trial to the following groups: Group A, 22 patients treated with atorvastatin 80\u200amg (once-daily) from admission day until discharge; Group B, 20 patients not treated with atorvastatin 80\u200amg until discharge, and after discharge, treatment with atorvastatin has been started. At 72 hours and at 7 days after acute ischemic stroke, subjects of group A showed significantly lower plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-6, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, whereas no significant difference with regard to plasma levels of IL-10, E-Selectin, and P-Selectin was observed between the 2 groups. At 72\u200ahours and 7 days after admission, stroke patients treated with atorvastatin 80\u200amg in comparison with stroke subjects not treated with atorvastatin showed a significantly lower mean National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale and modified Rankin scores. Our findings provide the first evidence that atorvastatin acutely administered immediately after an atherosclerotic ischemic stroke exerts a lowering effect on immune-inflammatory activation of the acute phase of stroke and that its early use is associated to a better functional and prognostic profile.", 
    "122": "An overview of clinical trials can reveal a class effect on mortality that is not apparent from individual trials. Most large trials of lipid pharmacotherapy are not powered to detect differences in mortality and instead assess efficacy with composite cardiovascular endpoints. We illustrate the importance of all-cause mortality data by comparing survival in three different sets of the larger controlled lipid trials that underpin meta-analyses. These trials are for fibrates and statins. Fibrate treatment in five of the six main trials was associated with a decrease in survival, one fibrate trial showed a non-significant reduction in mortality that can be explained by a different target population. In secondary prevention, statin treatment increased survival in all five of the main trials, absolute mean increase ranged from 0.43% to 3.33%, the median change was 1.75%, which occurred in the largest trial. In primary prevention, statin treatment increased survival in six of the seven main trials, absolute mean change in survival ranged from -0.09% to 0.89%, median 0.49%. Composite safety endpoints are rare in these trials. The failure to address composite safety endpoints in most lipid trials precludes a balanced summary of risk-benefit when a composite has been used for efficacy. Class effects on survival provide informative summaries of the risk-benefit of lipid pharmacotherapy. We consider that the presentation of key mortality/survival data adds to existing meta-analyses to aid personal treatment decisions.", 
    "123": "Simvastatin is a cholesterol-lowering drug, inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase. Previous studies have indicated the anticancerous effects of simvastatin. Here, we evaluated the anticancerous potential of simvastatin in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell lines. RCC occurs with an incidence of 2-3% of all cancer entities with high chemoresistance rate. Therefore, the understanding of underlying mechanisms for RCC activity and the development of alternative therapies are essential. Human RCC cell lines Caki-1 and KTC-26 were treated with simvastatin (16 or 33 \u00b5M) for 48 or 72 h. The effects of the downstream substrates mevalonate (MA), farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) were evaluated using add-back experiments. Cell growth was assessed using MTT assay. Apoptosis and cell cycle were analyzed by flow cytometry. Apoptosis-involved proteins were evaluated by Western blot. Simvastatin caused dose- and time-dependent inhibition of RCC cell growth by cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction. Substitution of MA or GGPP abolished these effects to a large extent. These findings suggest that the antiproliferative effects of simvastatin are not only mediated through cholesterol deprivation but also by prenylation-associated mechanisms, thereby providing new insights into tumor-suppressive ability of simvastatin and into novel additive treatment options in the management of RCC.",

In a first approach, constitutive transcription of key genes involved in detoxification was determined. Embryos were collected at different developmental stages, and transcription patterns of genes coding for ABC transporters, phase I and II and oxidative stress were analysed. With exception of abcc2, all genes seem to be from maternal transfer (0-2\u00a0hpf).

Accumulation assays to measure ABC proteins activity and activity of EROD, GST, CAT and Cu/ZnSOD, were also undertaken. Simvastatin acted as a weak inhibitor of ABC proteins and increased EROD and GST activity, whereas Cu/ZnSOD and CAT activity were decreased. Simvastatin up-regulated abcb4 and cyp3a65 transcription (both concentrations), as well as abcc1 and abcc2 at 50\u00a0\u03bcg/L, and down-regulated gst, sod, cat at 5\u00a0\u03bcg/L.

Hypercholesterolemic effect of this fermented compound has been validated and monacolin K has been recognized as the pivotal component in cholesterol alleviation. Functional similarity with commercial drug lovastatin sans the side effects has catapulted its popularity in other parts of the world as well. Apart from the hypotensive role, ameliorative benefits of RYR as anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, anticancer and osteogenic agent have emerged, fueling intense research on it. Mechanistic studies have revealed their interaction with functional agents like coenzyme Q10, astaxanthin, vitamin D, folic acid, policosanol, and berberine. On the other hand, concurrence of mycotoxin citrinin and variable content of statin has marred its integration in mainstream medication. In this disputable scenario, evaluation of the scopes and lacunae to overcome seems to contribute to an eminent area of healthcare.

In addition, treatment with statins reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality both in patients without and with established CVD.

Second, do low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels play a role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and should they also represent treatment targets? In the present review, we discuss these two pertinent questions. Accumulating data, both from observational studies and from interventional studies with statins and other lipid-lowering agents, suggest that lowering LDL-C levels considerably below the currently recommended targets is both safe and further reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. These benefits are particularly relevant for patients at very high cardiovascular risk, i.e. those with established CVD. On the other hand, it is questionable whether HDL-C is causally related to atherosclerosis and whether increasing HDL-C levels will translate into reduced cardiovascular risk. This uncertainty is even more pronounced in patients who achieve very low LDL-C levels with statin treatment.", 
    "196": "The relationship of cholesterol with stroke is much less clear than its relationship with myocardial infarction, thus confounding the interpretation of results with cholesterol-lowering trials. Because for long time the only lipid-lowering intervention reducing stroke was statins, it has been actually argued that reduction in stroke found in statin trials is not due to statins' ability to reduce LDL cholesterol, but to other \"pleiotropic\" effects, unrelated to cholesterol lowering. In re-analyzing the relationship of cholesterol lowering versus changes in the risk of stroke in a meta-regression of all cholesterol-lowering interventions, including also non-statin interventions, we had previously reached the opposite conclusion: that some reduction in stroke has to be expected proportional to cholesterol reduction. We had predicted that a 1% reduction of total cholesterol-no matter by what intervention produced-was associated with a 0.8% relative risk reduction of stroke. Data from the recently published Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial (IMPROVE-IT) now offer a clear proof of this concept, demonstrating that pure cholesterol lowering, as obtained with ezetimibe, plays an important role in reducing stroke. IMPROVE-IT data, showing a 13.3% reduction in total cholesterol at one year in association with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.86 for total stroke during the trial, are very closely aligned with the relative risk of 0.90 predicted on the basis of the totality of lipid lowering interventions.

Using primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), pravastatin dose-dependently induced klotho expression in contrast to remarkable suppression to IL-6 expressions determined by qRT-PCR. Moreover, TNF-\u03b1-induced IL-6 was partly but significantly blunted by pravastatin detected by ELISA. To further study the role of klotho in modulating IL-6 expression, endothelial cells with klotho overexpression were treated with TNF-\u03b1. Importantly, TNF-\u03b1-induced IL-6 production was markedly attenuated in klotho-overexpressed cells. In agreement with in vitro data, a marked reduction of klotho mRNA expression was found in isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with atherosclerosis.

Spearman's correlation coefficients between CHD mortality and statin utilisation were calculated. Linear regression analysis was used to assess the relation between changes in CHD mortality and statin utilisation over the years.", 
    "214": "12 countries were included in the study. There was a wide range of CHD mortality reduction between the years 2000 and 2012 (from 25.9% in Italy to 57.9% in Denmark) and statin utilisation increase (from 121% in Belgium to 1263% in Denmark). No statistically significant relations were found between CHD mortality rates and statin utilisation, nor between changes in CHD and changes in statin utilisation in the countries over the years 2000 and 2012.", 
    "215": "Among the Western European countries studied, the large increase in statin utilisation between 2000 and 2012 was not associated with CHD mortality, nor with its rate of change over the years. Factors different from the individual coronary risk, such as population ageing, health authority programmes, guidelines, media attention and pharmaceutical industry marketing, may have influenced the large increase in statin utilisation. These need to be re-examined with a greater emphasis on prevention strategies.",

    "221": "Thirty rabbits were randomly divided into a control group (C, n = 10), rapid-pacing group (P, n = 10), and rosuvastatin-intervention group (R, n = 10). AERP and inducibility of AF were measured for all groups. The sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves of left atrium, right atrium, and atrial septum labeled with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and choline acetyl transferase (ChAT) were detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blot.", 
    "222": "The AERP in group R was prolonged, and AF could not be induced as easily (P < 0.05). Immunohistochemistry showed that the densities and heterogeneity of TH and ChAT positive nerves of the atrium in group P were significantly higher than those in group C (ranked as right atrium > atrial septum > left atrium), whereas those in group R were decreased (P < 0.05). Western blot showed that TH and ChAT protein expression in group P was significantly increased compared with group C, but decreased in group R (P < 0.05).", 
    "223": "Persistent rapid atrial pacing can lead to heterogeneous ANR in different parts of the rabbit atrium and may cause AF, which can be reversed by rosuvastatin. The inhibitory function of rosuvastatin may be associated with its role in reversing atrial ANR.",

    "226": "Population mean serum cholesterol decreased from 6.15 mmol/L in 1989 to 5.39 mmol/L in 2008/09. Mean saturated fat intake decreased from 15.9% of energy intake in 1989 to 13.1% in 2008/09. Between 1997 and 2008/09, unsaturated fat intake increased and fat from butter and milk decreased. Older adults had the largest decrease in serum cholesterol (1.35 mmol/L).", 
    "227": "The decrease in serum cholesterol is substantially larger than reported for many other high-income countries, and occurred in parallel with changes in dietary fat intakes and, for older adults, increased use of cholesterol-lowering medications.", 
    "228": "Given the demonstrated role of reduced saturated fat intake on lowering serum cholesterol, and as population average serum cholesterol levels and saturated fat intakes exceed recommended levels, initiatives to further encourage reductions in saturated fat are imperative.",

These patients could benefit from treatment interventions by a pharmacist.", 
    "230": "Patients were identified from electronic health records. A sample of 3503 patients was ascertained from having a lipid panel performed within the 12 months before November 1, 2013. Patients were excluded if we were unable to calculate 10-year ASCVD risk.", 
    "231": "A total of 3203 patients were included, with 2008 not on statin therapy. Of those, 1507 (75%) had a 10-year ASCVD risk score <7.5% and 501 (25%) had a score > 7.5%. Patient characteristics leading to an increase in risk included advanced age, smoker, male, and hypertension treatment.

Atorvastatin-treated group (n=50) received interferon \u03b2-1a similar to control group in addition to atorvastatin (40 mg/day) for 18-months. All clinical and immunological variables were measured at the baseline and at the end of the study.", 
    "236": "There was no significant difference between the two groups in the expanded disability status scale scores and the number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions during the 18-month treatment period. After 18 months, the levels of interleukin (IL)-4, IL-10, transforming growth factor-\u03b2 and serum ferric reducing antioxidant power in the atorvastatin treatment group were significantly higher than the control group. Levels of IL-17, TNF-\u03b1 and lymphocyte proliferation in the atorvastatin treatment group were significantly lower than the control group.", 
    "237": "Although combined atorvastatin and interferon-\u03b2 do not change the clinical course of MS, atorvastatin might have beneficial effects in MS treatment possibly through inducing anti-inflammatory responses.", 
    "238": "Some macrolide and quinolone antibiotics (MQABs) are associated with QT prolongation and life-threatening torsade de pointes (TdP) arrhythmia. MQAB may also inhibit cytochrome P450 isoenzymes and thereby cause pharmacokinetic drug interactions (DDIs). There is limited data on the frequency and management of such risks in clinical practice. We aimed to quantify co-administration of MQAB with interacting drugs and associated adverse drug reactions.", 
    "239": "We conducted an observational study within our pharmacoepidemiological database derived from electronic medical records of a tertiary care hospital. Among all users of MQAB associated with TdP, we determined the prevalence of additional QT-prolonging drugs and risk factors and identified contraindicated co-administrations of simvastatin, atorvastatin, or tizanidine. Electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring and associated adverse events were validated in medical records.", 
    "240": "Among 3444 administered courses of clarithromycin, erythromycin, azithromycin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, or moxifloxacin, there were 1332 (38.7\u00a0%) with concomitant use of additional QT-prolonging drugs. Among those, we identified seven cases of drug-related QT prolongation, but 49.1\u00a0% had no ECG monitoring. Of all MQAB users, 547 (15.9\u00a0%) had hypokalemia. Forty-four MQAB users had contraindicated co-administrations of simvastatin, atorvastatin, or tizanidine and three of those related adverse drug reactions.", 
    "241": "In the studied real-life setting, we found a considerable number of MQAB users with additional risk factors for TdP but no ECG monitoring. However, adverse drug reactions were rarely found, and costs vs. benefits of ECG monitoring have to be weighted. In contrast, avoidable risk factors and selected contraindicated pharmacokinetic interactions are clear targets for implementation as automated alerts in electronic prescribing systems.", 
    "242": "Lipid nanoemulsions (LDEs) that bind to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors used as carriers of paclitaxel (PTX) can decrease toxicity and increase PTX antitumoral action.

    "244": "Compared with saline controls, 95% tumor-growth inhibition was achieved by LDE-PTX and Simva, 61% by LDE-PTX, 44% by PTX and Simva, and 43% by PTX. Simva alone had no effect. Metastasis developed in only 37% of the LDE-PTX and Simva, 60% in LDE-PTX, and 90% in PTX and Simva groups. Survival rates were higher in LDE-PTX and Simva and in LDE-PTX groups. The LDE-PTX and Simva group presented tumors with reduced cellular density and increased collagen fibers I and III. Tumors from all groups showed reduction in immunohistochemical expression of ICAM, MCP-1, and MMP-9; LDE-PTX and Simva presented the lowest MMP-9 expression. Expression of p21 was increased in the Simva, LDE-PTX, and LDE-PTX and Simva groups. In the Simva and LDE-PTX and Simva groups, expression of cyclin D1, a proliferation and survival promoter of tumor cells, was decreased. Therapy with LDE-PTX and Simva showed negligible toxicity compared with PTX and Simva, which resulted in weight loss and myelosuppression.", 
    "245": "Simva increased the antitumor activity of PTX carried in LDE but not of PTX commercial presentation, possibly because statins increase the expression of LDL receptors that internalize LDE-PTX.", 
    "246": "Preplanned economic analysis of a pragmatic trial using electronic-medical-record-linked interactive voice recognition (IVR) reminders for enhancing adherence to cardiovascular medications (i.e., statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors [ACEIs], and angiotensin receptor blockers [ARBs]).", 
    "247": "Three groups, usual care (UC), IVR, and IVR plus educational materials (IVR+), with 21,752 suboptimally adherent patients underwent follow-up for 9.6 months on average. Costs to implement and deliver the intervention (from a payer perspective) were tracked during the trial. Medical care costs and outcomes were ascertained using electronic medical records.", 
    "248": "Per-patient intervention costs ranged from $9 to $17 for IVR and from $36 to $47 for IVR+. For ACEI/ARB, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for each percent adherence increase was about 3 times higher with IVR+ than with IVR ($6 and $16 for IVR and IVR+, respectively). For statins, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for each percent adherence increase was about 7 times higher with IVR+ than with IVR ($6 and $43 for IVR and IVR+, respectively). Considering potential cost offsets from reduced cardiovascular events, the probability of breakeven was the highest for UC, but the IVR-based interventions had a higher probability of breakeven for subgroups with a baseline low-density lipoprotein (LDL) level of more than 100 mg/dl and those with two or more calls.", 
    "249": "We found that the use of an automated voice messaging system to promote adherence to ACEIs/ARBs and statins may be cost-effective, depending on a decision maker's willingness to pay for unit increase in adherence. When considering changes in LDL level and downstream medical care offsets, UC is the optimal strategy for the general population. However, IVR-based interventions may be the optimal choice for those with elevated LDL values at baseline.", 
    "250": "While recent guidelines have suggested the potential for beta-blockers as first-line agents in chronic stable angina, few data regarding comparative anti-anginal and metabolic effects between beta-blockers with and without vasodilating properties have been reported, particularly in patients with angina pectoris.",

The subjects undertook an exercise treadmill test and completed the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ); metabolic parameters were measured at baseline and 6\u00a0months after treatment.", 
    "253": "The baseline characteristics of both groups were well balanced. Both carvedilol and atenolol significantly reduced heart rate from baseline (76 \u00b1 11 to 66 \u00b1 9 beat/min, p < 0.001; 74 \u00b1 9 to 64 \u00b1 9 beat/min, p < 0.001, respectively) with no significant changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Improvement of time to ST-segment depression during the treadmill exercise and the SAQ scores for angina stability and frequency after 6\u00a0months of treatment were similar between groups. There was no significant change from baseline in the level of fasting glucose, insulin, or glycated hemoglobin in either group. However, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels significantly reduced to a greater extent with carvedilol than with atenolol (-23 vs. -10 and -38 vs. -24 %, respectively, p\u00a0<\u00a00.05 for both), although the rate of statin use was comparable. No changes were seen in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels after 6\u00a0months of treatment in both groups compared with baseline.", 
    "254": "Both carvedilol and atenolol had a similar anti-anginal effect. Compared with atenolol, carvedilol might have more beneficial effects on lipid metabolism in patients with stable angina pectoris [ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02547597].", 
    "255": "In this work lyophilized poly-\u03b5-caprolactone nanoparticles (NPs) loaded with atorvastatin calcium (AC) were developed in an attempt to improve the in-vivo performance of AC following oral administration. The individual and combined effects of several formulation variables were previously investigated using step-wise full factorial designs in order to produce optimized AC-NPs with predetermined characteristics including particle size, drug loading capacity, drug release profile and physical stability. Four optimized formulations were further subjected in this work to lyophilization to promote their long-term physical stability and were fully characterized. The pharmacodynamics (PD)/pharmacokinetics (PK) properties of two optimized freeze-dried AC-NPs formulations showing acceptable long-term stability were determined and compared to a marketed AC immediate release tablet (Lipitor(\u00ae)) in albino rats. PD results revealed that the two tested formulations were equally effective in reducing low density lipoproteins (LDL) and triglycerides (TG) levels when given in reduced doses compared to Lipitor(\u00ae) and showed no adverse effects. PK results, on the other hand, revealed that the two freeze-dried AC-NPs formulations were of significantly lower bioavailability compared to Lipitor(\u00ae). Taken together the PD and PK results demonstrate that the improved efficacy obtained at reduced doses from the freeze-dried AC-NPs could be due to increased concentration of AC in the liver rather than in the plasma.", 
    "256": "HIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) remains a persistent problem despite antiretroviral therapy (ART), largely a result of continued inflammation in the periphery and the brain and neurotoxin release from activated myeloid cells in the CNS. CD14+CD16+ inflammatory monocytes, expanded in HIV infection, play a central role in the pathogenesis of HAND and have parallels with monocyte-dependent inflammatory mechanisms in atherosclerosis. Statins, through their HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor activity, have pleiotropic immunomodulatory properties that contribute to their benefit in atherosclerosis beyond lipid lowering. Here, we investigated whether statins would modulate the monocyte phenotype and function associated with HIV-1 neuropathogenesis. Treatment ex vivo with simvastatin and atorvastatin reduced the proportion of CD16+ monocytes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, as well as in purified monocytes, especially CD14++CD16+ \"intermediate\" monocytes most closely associated with neurocognitive disease. Statin treatment also markedly reduced expression of CD163, which is also linked to HAND pathogenesis. Finally, simvastatin inhibited production of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and other inflammatory cytokines following LPS stimulation and reduced monocyte chemotaxis in response to MCP-1, a major driver of myeloid cell accumulation in the CNS in HAND. Together, these findings suggest that statin drugs may be useful to prevent or reduce HAND in HIV-1-infected subjects on ART with persistent monocyte activation and inflammation."
