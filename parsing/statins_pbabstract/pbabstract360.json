Using specific substrate efflux assay, we show that GF120918 (0.2 microM) and probenecid (5 mM) were specific inhibitors of MDR1 and MRP1, respectively. In HepG2 cells, neither of them affect the esterification of cholesterol derived from the uptake of cholesterol-rich lipoprotein, while both verapamil (100 microM) and progesterone (100 microM) were able to inhibit cholesterol esterification. Similar results were obtained with verapamil, progesterone, and GF120918 in the MDR1-overexpressing cells MCF7/ADR. The capacity of progesterone to reduce cholesterol esterification is not correlated with its ability to inhibit MDR1 but is rather due to direct inhibition of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT). We conclude that the esterification of cholesterol is not correlated with MDR1 or MRP1 activity, thus excluding their role in the intracellular transport of endocytosis-derived cholesterol.",

In random order, these patients received Simvastatin (20 mg day-1) or Cholestyramine (6 g three times a day) for a period of 10 months and after three months of wash-out (cross-over) the sequence was reversed for an additional 10 months.

The impact, however, of immediate initiation of antilipidemic therapy on coronary stenoses and clinical outcome in patients with acute coronary syndrome is unknown. In our study, patients were randomized, on average, 6 days after an acute myocardial infarction and/or percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty secondary to unstable angina, to pravastatin (combined, when necessary, with cholestyramine and/or nicotinic acid) to achieve low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of < or =130 mg/dl (group A, n = 70). In controls (group B, n = 56), antilipidemic therapy was determined by family physicians. Quantitative coronary angiography was performed at inclusion, and at 6- and 24-month follow-up. The combined clinical end points were total mortality, cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, need for coronary intervention, stroke, and new onset of peripheral vascular disease. Minimal lumen diameter in group A increased by 0.05 +/- 0.20 mm after 6 months and 0.13 +/- 0.29 mm after 24 months, whereas it decreased by 0.08 +/- 0.20 mm and 0.18 +/- 0.27 mm, respectively, in group B (p = 0.004 at 6 months and p <0.001 at 24 months). After 2 years, 29 patients of 56 patients in group B, but only 16 of 70 patients in group A, experienced a clinical end point (p = 0.005; odds ratio 0.28, confidence intervals 0.13 to 0.6). We conclude that pravastatin-based therapy initiated immediately after an acute coronary syndrome is well tolerated and safe, lessens coronary atherosclerosis, and has a pronounced clinical benefit.",

Atorvastatin was well tolerated. Atorvastatin administration with evening meals resulted in 25.2% lower mean Cmax and 29.8% longer mean tmax values relative to administration after meals. The mean AUC(0-24) value was 8.6% lower for atorvastatin administration with meals compared to after meals. In contrast to the effect of food on pharmacokinetics, LDL-C reductions were similar after atorvastatin administration with or after evening meals. Average reductions from baseline were 24.4% for total cholesterol, 39.6% for LDL-C and 10% for triglycerides. Therefore, atorvastatin may be administered with or without food.",

Ten hypercholesterolemic (total cholesterol [TC] > 220 mg/dl) RTR (7 men) with mean age 44 years (range 25-56 years) who remained hypercholesterolemic after 3 months of treatment (period A) with fluvastatin (40 mg/d) continued taking the same dose of F plus G (600 mg/dl) for another 3-month period (B). Serum total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), triglyceride, serum creatinine (creatinine phosphokinase (CPK), serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), and serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase (SGPT) were measured before treatment and at the end of periods A and B. Mean TC levels were 360.30 +/- 62.42 mg/dl, 324.10 +/- 100.53 mg/dl, 270.80 +/- 67.77 mg/dl; mean LDL-C levels were 259.33 +/- 71.43 mg/dl, 219.60 +/- 81.31 mg/dl, 189.70 +/- 65.51 mg/dl; mean HDL-C levels were 37.10 +/- 11.68 mg/dl, 39.80 +/- 13.21 mg/dl, 41.00 +/- 12.94 mg/dl; mean triglyceride levels were 354.60 +/- 183.29 mg/dl, 349.30 +/- 242.94 mg/dl, 207.00 +/- 85.35 mg/dl before treatment and at the end of periods A and B, respectively. There was a statistically significant fall of serum TC (P = 0.002), LDL-C (P = 0.016), and triglyceride (P = 0.029) levels at the end of periods A and B. Kidney and liver function did not change. F and G combined treatment is safe and useful in patients who do not respond satisfactorily to monotherapy with F. Gemfibrozil augments the effect of F on TC, LDL-C, and triglyceride levels.", 
    "8": "In higher plants, fungi, and animals isoprenoids are derived from the mevalonate pathway. The carboxylic acid mevalonate is formed from acetyl-CoA and acetoacetyl-CoA via the intermediate 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA). The four-electron reduction of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, which utilizes two molecules of NADPH, is the committed step in the biosynthesis of isoprenoids. This reaction is catalyzed by HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR). The activity of HMGR is controlled through synthesis, degradation and phosphorylation. The human enzyme has also been targeted successfully by drugs, known as statins, in the clinical treatment of high serum cholesterol levels. The crystal structure of the catalytic portion of HMGR has been determined recently with bound reaction substrates and products. The structure illustrates how HMG-CoA and NADPH are recognized and suggests a catalytic mechanism. Catalytic portions of human HMGR form tight tetramers, explaining the influence of the enzyme's oligomeric state on the activity and suggesting a mechanism for cholesterol sensing.",

Some studies show a positive relationship between serum cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein levels and retinal hard exudation. Other studies show serum triglyceride levels as being important in the progression of retinopathy. Certain other studies show no relationship between serum lipid levels and diabetic retinopathy. We review the literature on this subject and illustrate this report with an example of a diabetic with severe diabetic maculopathy and high serum lipid levels.", 
    "10": "In the majority of people with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) the disorder is caused by a mutation of the low-density lipoprotein receptor gene that impairs its proper function, resulting in very high levels of plasma cholesterol. Such levels result in early and severe atherosclerosis, and hence substantial excess mortality from coronary heart disease. Most people with FH are undiagnosed or only diagnosed after their first coronary event, but early detection and treatment with hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) can reduce morbidity and mortality. The prevalence of FH in the UK population is estimated to be 1 in 500, which means that approximately 110,000 people are affected.",

Known researchers in the field were contacted and asked to supply information on unpublished or ongoing studies. INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA: SCREENING AND TREATMENT: The review included studies of the mortality and morbidity associated with FH, the effectiveness and cost of treatment (ignoring pre-statin therapies in adults), and of the effectiveness or cost of possible screening strategies for FH. PSYCHOSOCIAL EFFECTS OF SCREENING: The search for papers on the psychological and social effects of screening for a treatable inherited condition was limited to the last 5 years because recent developments in genetic testing have changed the nature and implications of such screening tests. Papers focusing on genetic testing for FH and breast cancer were included. Papers relating to the risk of coronary heart disease with similarly modifiable outcome (non-FH) were also included. DATA EXTRACTION AND ASSESSMENT OF VALIDITY: A data assessment tool was designed to assess the quality and validity of the papers which reported primary data for the social and psychological effects of screening. Available guidelines for systematically reviewing papers concentrated on quantitative methods, and were of limited relevance. An algorithm was developed which could be used for both the qualitative and quantitative literature. MODELLING METHODS: A model was constructed to investigate the relative cost and effectiveness of various forms of population screening (universal or opportunistic) and case-finding screening (screening relatives of known FH cases). All strategies involved a two-stage process: first, identifying those people with cholesterol levels sufficiently elevated to be compatible with a diagnosis of FH, and then either making the diagnosis based on clinical signs and a family history of coronary disease or carrying out genetic tests. Cost-effectiveness has been measured in terms of incremental cost per year of life gained.", 
    "14": "MODELLING COST-EFFECTIVENESS: FH is a life-threatening condition with a long presymptomatic state. Diagnostic tests are reasonably reliable and acceptable, and treatment with statins substantially improves prognosis. Therefore, it is appropriate to consider systematic screening for this condition. Case finding amongst relatives of FH cases was the most cost-effective strategy, and universal systematic screening the least cost-effective. However, when targeted at young people (16 year olds) universal screening was also cost-effective. Screening patients admitted to hospital with premature myocardial infarction was also relatively cost-effective. Screening is least cost-effective in men aged over 35 years, because the gains in life expectancy are small. (ABSTRACT TRUNCA", 
    "15": "In the present study, the effects of taxifolin, a plant flavonoid, on lipid, apolipoprotein B (apoB), and apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) synthesis and secretion were determined in HepG2 cells. Pretreatment of cells with (+/-)-taxifolin led to an inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in a dose- and time-dependent manner, with an 86 +/- 3% inhibition at 200 microM observed within 24 h. As to the mechanism underlying this inhibitory effect, taxifolin was shown to inhibit the activity of HMG-CoA reductase by 47 +/- 7%. In addition, cellular cholesterol esterification, and triacylglycerol and phospholipid syntheses, were also significantly suppressed in the presence of taxifolin. ApoA-I and apoB synthesis and secretion were then studied by pulse-chase experiments. ApoA-I secretion was found to increase by 36 +/- 10%. In contrast, an average reduction of 61 +/- 8% in labeled apoB in the medium was apparent with taxifolin. This effect on secretion appeared not to be exerted at the transcriptional level. Rather, the effect on apoB secretion was found to be exerted in the early stages of apoB degradation and to be sensitive to dithiothreitol (DTT) and insensitive to N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal, suggesting a proteolytic pathway involving a DTT-sensitive protease. Fractionation of secreted apoB revealed a slight shift in the distribution of secreted apoB-containing lipoproteins. Cholesteryl ester, rather than triacylglycerol, was shown to be the lipid that primarily regulated apoB secretion. In summary, our data suggest that taxifolin decreases hepatic lipid synthesis with a concomitant decrease and increase in apoB and apoA-I secretion, respectively.", 
    "16": "Estrogen deficiency is a leading cause of osteoporosis associated with increased osteoclastic bone resorption. In vitro studies indicate that the clinically used nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (N-BPs) such as alendronate (ALN), risedronate (RIS) and ibandronate (IBA) suppress bone resorption via inhibition of the mevalonate pathway enzyme farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) synthase in osteoclasts (Ocs). The object of this study was to test the hypothesis that N-BPs inhibit the mevalonate pathway of Ocs in vivo. The mevalonate pathway enzyme hydroxymethyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGR), is modulated by feedback inhibition from downstream metabolites. We therefore evaluated the in vivo expression of HMGR in Ocs from animals treated with BP. The N-BPs, ALN, IBA and RIS, selectively suppressed HMGR expression in up to 85% of rat tibia osteoclasts, after 48 hr treatment. Etidronate and clodronate, bisphosphonates that do not inhibit FPP synthase, were without effect. Simvastatin treatment opposed ALN reduction of HMGR expression, suggesting regulation by a metabolite(s) between mevalonate and FPP. These data provide the first in vivo evidence for N-BP effects on the mevalonate pathway in osteoclasts, and strongly support the hypothesis that N-BPs act via this mechanism.", 
    "17": "Inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, or statins, are effective lipid-lowering agents, extensively used in medical practice. Statins have never been shown to be involved in the immune response, although a report has indicated a better outcome of cardiac transplantation in patients under Pravastatin therapy. Major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) molecules are directly involved in the activation of T lymphocytes and in the control of the immune response. Whereas only a limited number of specialized cell types express MHC-II constitutively, numerous other cells become MHC-II positive upon induction by interferon gamma (IFN-gamma). This complex regulation is under the control of the transactivator CIITA (refs 6,7). Here we show that statins act as direct inhibitors of induction of MHC-II expression by IFN-gamma and thus as repressors of MHC-II-mediated T-cell activation. This effect of statins is due to inhibition of the inducible promoter IV of the transactivator CIITA and is observed in several cell types, including primary human endothelial cells (ECs) and monocyte-macrophages (Mstraight phi). It is of note that this inhibition is specific for inducible MHC-II expression and does not concern constitutive expression of CIITA and MHC-II. In repressing induction of MHC-II, and subsequent T-lymphocyte activation, statins therefore provide a new type of immunomodulation. This unexpected effect provides a scientific rationale for using statins as immunosuppressors, not only in organ transplantation but in numerous other pathologies as well.", 
    "18": "There have been many recent articles published that emphasize the fact that cholesterol deposits are only one of many mechanisms through which acute coronary artery disease develops. Recently, a meta-analysis shows that only 14% of acute coronary events occur in stenotic lesions in coronary arteries that are greater than 70% occluded. The majority of acute coronary events (68%) occur in coronary arteries that have less than 50% stenotic lesions. The acute coronary syndrome is a very complex and unpredictable disease. Recent information now points to the endothelium as a modulating factor in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease through the production of nitric oxide and angiotensin-II which maintain the homeostatic environment influencing the progression of coronary artery disease. With dysfunctional endothelium there seems to be an imbalance in terms of angiotensin production with regards to the nitric oxide production. This imbalance tends to promote coronary artery disease in individuals who have multiple risk factors. Furthermore, it has been suggested that certain inflammatory compounds are produced in a very dysfunctional endothelium, thereby propagating or leading to acute coronary syndromes. Specifically, this includes C-reactive protein which promotes chronic inflammation at various sites. There are also other acute phase reactants, such as fibrinogen, which may play a role in atherogenesis. Certain statin drugs, as they are called, tend to ameliorate the levels of the above acute phase reactants, while other statins do not. This reduction of coronary events by statins is independent of the LDL lowering benefits from statin drugs. This article delineates some of the beneficial effects of the different statin agents and points out that all statins are not equal in terms of their known lipid beneficial effects. For the practicing physician, choosing a particular statin agent is important. Some have more drug/drug interaction potential as compared with the others because of their inability to be metabolized through the cytochrome P450 system. There are also some, because of their lipophilic and hydrophilic nature, that tend to enter cells more readily than other statin agents. The effects conferred by these subtle differences among the currently available statins tend to be beneficial in patients with low to moderate levels of LDL cholesterol.", 
    "19": "Atorvastatin is a potent HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor that decreases low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and fasting triglyceride concentrations. Because of the positive association between elevated postprandial lipoproteins and atherosclerosis, we investigated the effect of atorvastatin on postprandial lipoprotein metabolism. The effect of 4 weeks of atorvastatin therapy (10 mg/day) was evaluated in 10 normolipidemic men (30+/-2 yr; body mass index, 22+/-3 kg/m2; cholesterol, 4.84+/-0.54 mmol/L; triglyceride, 1.47+/-0.50 mmol/L; high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 1.17+/-0.18 mmol/L; LDL-cholesterol, 3.00+/-0.49 mmol/L). Postprandial lipoprotein metabolism was evaluated with a standardized fat load (1300 kcal, 87% fat, 7% carbohydrates, 6% protein, 80,000 IU vitamin A) given after 12 h fast. Plasma was obtained every 2 h for 14 h. A chylomicron (CM) and a chylomicron-remnant (CR) fraction was isolated by ultracentrifugation, and triglycerides, cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, apoB-48, and retinyl-palmitate were determined in plasma and in each lipoprotein fraction. Atorvastatin therapy significantly (P < 0.001) decreased fasting cholesterol (-28%), triglycerides (-30%), LDL-cholesterol (-41%), and apolipoprotein B (-39%), whereas high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased (4%, not significant). The area under the curve for plasma triglycerides (-27%) and CR triglycerides (-40%), cholesterol (-49%), and apoB-48 (-43%) decreased significantly (P < 0.05), whereas CR retinyl-palmitate decreased (-34%) with borderline significance (P = 0.08). However, none of the CM parameters changed with atorvastatin therapy. This indicates that, in addition to improving fasting lipoprotein concentrations, atorvastatin improves postprandial lipoprotein metabolism presumably by increasing CR clearance or by decreasing the conversion of CMs to CRs, thus increasing the direct removal of CMs from plasma.", 
    "20": "Activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNKs) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) are early cellular responses to genotoxic stress involved in the regulation of gene expression. Pretreatment of cells with the hydroxymethyl glutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin blocked stimulation of JNK1 activity by UV irradiation and by treatment with the alkylating compound methyl methanesulfonate but did not affect activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 by UV light. Lovastatin also attenuated UV-induced degradation of the NF-kappaB inhibitor IkappaBalpha. The effects of lovastatin on UV-triggered stimulation of JNK1 as well as on IkappaBalpha degradation were reverted by cotreatment with geranylgeranylpyrophosphate but not with farnesylpyrophosphate. Both a geranylgeranyltransferase type I inhibitor and a farnesyltransferase inhibitor blocked JNK1 stimulation by UV irradiation without impairing signaling to NF-kappaB. This indicates that different types of isoprenylated proteins impair UV-induced signaling to JNK1 and NF-kappaB, respectively. Since lovastatin caused a rapid decrease in the level of membrane-bound Rho GTPases, we hypothesize that Rho signaling is inhibited by lovastatin. In line with this hypothesis, Rho-inactivating toxin B from Clostridium difficile abolished both JNK1 activation and IkappaBalpha degradation evoked by UV irradiation. In summary, lovastatin-mediated inhibition of protein isoprenylation abrogates cellular stress responses involving JNK- and NF-kappaB-regulated pathways, which seems to be caused by inactivation of Rho GTPases.",

With such a high prevalence and poor prognosis, there is still a clear need for improved secondary preventive treatment. Several landmark statin trials (CARE, LIPID and 4-S) have now shown the benefits of lowering cholesterol, starting months after an acute coronary event, and several smaller studies (such as L-CAD, PTT and RECIFE) have demonstrated the clinical benefits of very early statin treatment. Recent research suggests the underlying cause of the disease, atherosclerosis, is a dynamic and potentially reversible process. Statins may tip this balance in favour of resolution by cholesterol lowering and through pleiotropic effects independent of lipid lowering. Pravastatin, when given very early in the clinical course, has already been shown to improve both plaque stability and endothelial function, as well as clinical outcome, suggesting it as the drug of choice in early secondary prevention.",

After simvastatin administration, plasma nitrate and nitrite (NO(x)) levels increased from 5.22 +/- 1.2 to 7. 79 +/- 1.3 microM (P < 0.05); baseline and agonist-stimulated NO production in isolated coronary microvessels were augmented (P < 0.05); resting in vivo myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO(2)) decreased from 6.8 +/- 0.6 to 5.9 +/- 0.4 ml/min (P < 0.05); NO-dependent regulation of MVO(2) in response to NO agonists was augmented in isolated myocardial segments (P < 0.05); and eNOS protein increased 29% and eNOS mRNA decreased 50% in aortas and coronary vascular endothelium. Short-term administration of simvastatin in dogs increases coronary endothelial NO production to enhance NO-dependent coronary vasodilation and NO-mediated regulation of MVO(2).", 
    "39": "Consistent with several potentially anti-atherogenic activities of high-density lipoproteins in vitro, low plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol are associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease. In addition to genes, lifestyle factors (e.g. smoking, being overweight and physical inactivity) strongly affect plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Moreover, a low level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol interacts with other risk factors. Raising of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol by either adjustments of lifestyle or drug intervention as well as elimination of additional risk factors are thus thought to affect coronary risk. Here, we summarize the outcomes of observational and interventional studies as well as genetic and experimental research which have recently much advanced our understanding of the function and regulation of high-density lipoprotein metabolism. We conclude from the data that changes in the kinetics and functionality of high-density lipoprotein rather than changes in plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels per se will affect the anti-atherogenicity of therapeutic interference with high-density lipoprotein metabolism.", 
    "40": "The prevention and treatment of coronary heart disease is a major challenge in the overall management of the patient with type 2 diabetes. Diabetic dyslipidaemia is an important risk factor and is open to therapeutic intervention. However, as yet there are no primary or secondary coronary heart disease prevention trials of lipid-lowering therapy reported in diabetic populations. In this review, on-going clinical trials of lipid-lowering therapy in specific diabetic populations will be described.", 
    "41": "Lovastatin and simvastatin are HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors widely used as antihyperlipidemic drugs, which also display antiproliferative properties. In the present paper, we provide evidence that both lovastatin and simvastatin are modulators of the purified bovine pituitary 20 S proteasome, since they mildly stimulate the chymotrypsin-like activity and inhibit the peptidylglutamylpeptide hydrolyzing activity without interfering with the trypsin-like activity. However, those effects are only observed when the closed ring forms of the drugs are used, while the opened ring form of lovastatin acts as a mild inhibitor of the chymotrypsin like activity. The closed ring form of lovastatin is much more potent as a cytotoxic agent on the Colon-26 (C-26) colon carcinoma cell line than the opened ring form, which is only mildly cytostatic. Moreover, neither the cytotoxic effects nor the effects on 20 S proteasome activities are prevented by mevalonate, which by itself inhibits the trypsin-like activity of the proteasome. Neither the opened ring nor the closed ring form of lovastatin induces an accumulation of ubiquitin-protein conjugates, which is observed after treatment with lactacystin, a selective proteasome inhibitor. In contrast with the opened ring form of lovastatin, the closed ring form induces the disappearance of detectable p27(kip1) from C-26 cells. Altogether, our results indicate that the closed ring form of lovastatin induces cytotoxic effects independent of its HMG-CoA inhibiting activity, however, those effects are mediated by a complex modulation of proteasome activity rather than by inhibition of the 20 S proteasome.",

    "43": "In the middle of 1950's, microbial transformation technology was introduced into the field of synthetic chemistry as a new methodology. There was a sudden interest in research on the problems of producing steroid hormones by microbial transformation. At that time, the first project entitled \"The Study for Microbial Transformation of Steroids\", the \"Tsuda Project\", was established in the Institute of Applied Microbiology (IAM), University of Tokyo, in the spring 1956, in which I took part. This paper summarizes a number of results of our microbial transformation reactions not only in the synthesis of steroidal compounds, but also more broadly for other organic compounds, such as pravastatin, etc. The results are divided into five categories: 1) Microbial transformation of steroids, 2) Correlation between isolation sources of Pseudomonas spp. and their transformation activities, 3) Fermentation Production of prednisolone by Bacillus pulvifaciens SANK 71760, 4) Microbial transformation of siccanin, and 5) Development and fermentation production of pravastatin. About 30 years later, almost at the end of my microbial transformation studies, I had the opportunity to find some microbial strains having superior hydroxylation ability of ML-236BNa to pravastatin. Fortunately, Streptomyces carbophilus SANK 62585 was finally selected as a potent microbial converter with the formation of a lesser amount of by-products. With the view of industrial production of pravastatin, many studies and improvements were made to the culturing conditions to obtain productivity available commercially.", 
    "44": "1. Vascular effects of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, simvastatin, were studied in conductance (aorta) and resistance vessels (branch II or III of superior mesenteric artery, SMA) of the rat (12 - 14 weeks old). 2. Simvastatin produced relaxation of both aorta and SMA, with and without functional endothelium. These responses were inhibited by the product of HMG-CoA reductase, mevalonate (1 mmol l(-1)). 3. In vessels with functional endothelium, the NO-synthase inhibitor, L-N(G)-nitroarginine (L-NOARG, 30 micromol l(-1)), inhibited simvastatin-induced relaxation. In the presence of L-NOARG, relaxation to simvastatin was lower in vessels with endothelium than in endothelium-denuded arteries without L-NOARG. 4. The cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin (10 micromol l(-1)), abolished endothelium-dependent component of the response to simvastatin in both arteries. The combination of L-NOARG plus indomethacin did not produce further inhibition. The T(p) receptor antagonist, GR 32191B (3 micromol l(-1)), did not affect relaxation in aorta but it reduced response to low concentrations of simvastatin in SMA. However, the inhibitory effect of L-NOARG was less marked in the presence of GR 32191B in aorta but not in SMA. 5. The endothelium-dependent relaxation to simvastatin was inhibited by the superoxide dismutase (SOD, 100 u ml(-1)) or by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein (30 micromol l(-1)) in the two arteries. 6. The present study shows that simvastatin produces relaxation of conductance and small arteries through mevalonate-sensitive pathway. The endothelium-dependent relaxation to simvastatin involves both NO and vasodilator eicosanoids by a mechanism sensitive to SOD, and to genistein. Also, the results highlighted participation in the aorta of endothelial vasoconstrictor eicosanoids acting on the T(p) receptor after blockage of NO synthase only.", 
    "45": "Although several large, well-controlled trials with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) demonstrate the benefits of cholesterol lowering on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, these trials excluded patients with recent unstable angina or myocardial infarction. Thus, the potentially beneficial effects that may accrue from early statin therapy have not been apparent. Mechanistic and experimental studies show that benefits from statin therapy may include improved endothelial function, a decrease in platelet thrombus deposition, and a reduction in inflammation at the site of the lesion. Large-scale clinical trials are now under way to determine the effect of aggressive cholesterol lowering in patients with acute coronary syndromes. If the findings of the smaller studies are confirmed, statin therapy should be considered early after infarction or unstable angina.", 
    "46": "Management of acute coronary syndromes has been the focus of increased interest in recent years. This has come about with the recognition that the majority of patients who present to the hospital with chest pain have unstable angina or non-Q-wave myocardial infarction (MI). Further, sensitive biochemical markers of myocardial necrosis, such as troponin and creatine kinase, have improved early diagnosis. Markers of inflammation such as C-reactive protein (CRP), although not in wide clinical practice, may provide an early and important marker of prognosis. The current approach to management of acute coronary syndromes is careful risk stratification so as to select appropriate medical therapies and to guide the clinician to appropriate interventions such as angiography or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Established therapies such as aspirin, heparin, intravenous nitrates, and, in selected patients, beta blockers or calcium antagonists, are being used concomitantly with, or are being supplanted by, newer therapies such as low-molecular-weight heparins and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors. The role of hydroxymethyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) in patients with acute coronary syndromes is being investigated and shows promise.", 
    "47": "Acute coronary syndromes are caused by plaque rupture. The conventional strategy of prevention of plaque rupture has been driven by the \"lipid hypothesis\"--if lipid levels are optimized to target levels, the risk of coronary events is decreased. Indeed, the hypothesis has been validated by the dramatic success of statin therapy. However, further major reductions in cardiac events is a realistic goal; various mechanistic and small clinical studies show that statins have beneficial effects in addition to their lipid-lowering properties. One of these beneficial effects is stabilization of plaque. Despite billions of dollars spent on randomized clinical trials, optimal therapy for coronary artery disease is yet to be tested. This therapy might include various combinations of the Mediterranean or low-fat diet, endothelial passivation, lipid-lowering drugs, antioxidants, antiplatelet agents and anti-inflammatory agents.", 
    "48": "Endothelial dysfunction is present in patients with atherosclerosis, even in the early stages of disease, before plaque formation. Thus, it is a useful marker for early cardiovascular disease. In recent studies, statin therapy has been shown to improve endothelial function by increasing production of nitric oxide, a key vasodilator, from the endothelium. The improvement in endothelial function occurs by lipid lowering as well as by nonlipid mechanisms. These effects begin early in treatment, supporting prompt initiation of statin therapy. The functional benefits that result from an improvement in endothelial dysfunction include enhanced myocardial perfusion, reduced duration and burden of transient myocardial ischemia, and reduced angina pectoris. As dysfunctional endothelium encourages the recruitment of leukocytes into the arterial wall and thereby predisposes to inflammation and plaque disruption, improvement in endothelial function leads to plaque stabilization.",

In SMC, platelet-derived growth factor (5 ng/ml) enhanced 3H-thymidine incorporation (298 +/- 23%, n = 4), activated cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk2), phosphorylated Rb and down-regulated p27Kip1 (but not p21CiP1). Cerivastatin reduced the 3H-thymidine incorporation (164 +/- 11%, p < 0.01), inhibited Cdk2 activation and Rb phosphorylation, but did not prevent p27Kip1 down-regulation, nor p42mapk and p70S6K activation. Mevalonate abrogated the effects of cerivastatin on Cdk2 and Rb but only partially rescued the 3H-thymidine incorporation (from 164 +/- 11% to 211 +/- 13%, n = 4, p < 0.01).", 
    "53": "In humans, SVEC inhibition of HMG-CoA/mevalonate pathway contributes to the enhanced eNOS expression and NO release by cerivastatin, whereas in SMC, inhibition of this pathway only partially explains cerivastatin-induced cell growth arrest. Inhibition of mechanisms other than p42mapk and p70S6K or Cdk2 are also involved. These effects of cerivastatin could be important in treating venous bypass graft disease.",

Some of these parameters can be favorably affected when abnormal serum lipoprotein levels are corrected. Thus, we investigated whether treatment with atorvastatin would result in changes in plasma viscosity and other hemorheologic and hemostatic parameters. Twenty-two hyperlipidemic men at a university lipid clinic were treated single-blinded with atorvastatin 80 mg/day for 12 weeks to determine hemostatic-hemorheologic parameters including blood viscosity, fibrinogen levels, whole blood platelet aggregation, tissue plasminogen activator antigen, hematocrit, plasminogen activator inhibitor activity, factor VII activity, red blood cell (RBC) deformity and lipid ratio, sedimentation rate, and fasting serum lipoprotein levels. Atorvastatin treatment provided significant lowering of serum lipoprotein levels: low-density lipoprotein -53% (p = 0.0001), very low density lipoprotein -43% (p = 0.0001), and triglycerides -35% (p < 0.0001). These effects were accompanied by changes in plasma viscosity -10% (p = 0.0007), arachidonic acid-induced whole blood platelet aggregation -11% (p = 0.006), factor VII -8% (p = 0.001), RBC lipid composition +5% (p = 0.0003), and RBC sedimentation -33% (p = 0.0002). Plasma fibrinogen levels were not affected. Thus, atorvastatin 80 mg/day produced marked reductions in serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (-53%), very low density lipoprotein cholesterol (-43%), and triglycerides levels (-35%), and significant changes in plasma viscosity as well as other hemorheologic-hemostatic parameters, but no changes in plasma fibrinogen levels.",

These data provide a compelling scientific basis for a more targeted and segmental approach to managing patients with dyslipidemia, where decreasing elevated levels of LDL cholesterol and increasing low levels of HDL cholesterol should comprise dual targets of pharmacotherapy.",

At week 16, fenofibrate 200 mg alone lowered LDL cholesterol from baseline by 21% compared with 32% for fluvastatin 20 mg plus fenofibrate 200 mg and 41% for fluvastatin 40 mg plus fenofibrate 200 mg (p <0.001). Triglycerides decreased by 29% with fenofibrate 200 mg alone, 39% with fluvastatin 20 mg plus fenofibrate 200 mg, and 40% with fluvastatin 40 mg plus fenofibrate 200 mg (p <0.05). Safety was assessed by recording adverse events and measuring clinical laboratory parameters. The adverse event profile was similar for the 3 treatment groups. One patient withdrew due to an increase in transaminase levels. No significant increase in creatine phosphokinase levels was observed with combination therapy. In conclusion, the addition of fluvastatin to micronized fenofibrate results in substantial improvement in atherogenic plasma lipids and is well tolerated.",

In the subgroup of patients with a general practitioner (GP) diagnosis of ischaemic heart disease, 13.3 per cent of men and 8.2 per cent of women received a prescription for a statin in 1996. Below the age of 65 years, men with ischaemic heart disease were more likely to be prescribed a statin than were women. Patients aged 75 years and over with ischaemic heart disease were unlikely to be prescribed a statin irrespective of their sex. The percentage of patients prescribed statins in individual practices varied from 0.1 to 2.3 per cent in men and from 0 to 2.3 per cent in women.

    "70": "Coronary artery disease is still the no. 1 killer in the developed countries and must thus be detected and treated at an earlier stage. If coronary artery disease is advanced, patients have to be examined regarding the need for revascularization. For secondary prevention, of course, an optimal change of life style and optimal medical treatment of risk factors is mandatory. Independent of the optimal risk factor modification, all of these patients (according to the rules of evidence-based medicine) should take ASA, statins, beta blockers and ACE-inhibitors, if no contraindications or intolerance are present. Therefore, the problem in secondary prevention is not how to identify these patients, but rather how to fulfill their needs. In our own survey in patients with known coronary artery disease referred for PTCA (including patients with post myocardial infarction previous PTCA or bypass surgery), only 89% were on ASA (or clopidogrel), 51% on lipid lowering drugs (46% on statins), 65% on beta blockers, and only 43% had an ACE-inhibitor (MUNICH data in Figures 1 to 4). The analysis of published literature is also depicted in Figures 1 to 4. Until 1996, patients with known coronary artery disease took ASA in only 26% of the cases but later on it was 77 to 100% (Figure 1). Lipid lowering drugs (especially statins) are prescribed in only 13 to 77% (Figure 2), beta blockers in only 30 to 80% (Figure 3) and ACE-inhibitors in only 10 to 72% (Figure 4). In 2 major studies, a decrease in the rate of intake of these drugs during the follow-up years has been documented. The \"ideal tablet\" for secondary prevention contains ASA (100 mg), a statin (e.g. for most statins 40 to 80 mg), a beta blocker (e.g. metoprolol 100 mg or bisoprolol 10 mg) and an ACE-inhibitor (e.g. ramipril 10 mg). So this ideal \"SPM\" (\"secondary prevention mix\") tablet contains 160 to 300 mg of drugs. In conclusion, the analysis of published data for Europe and the USA shows that--in contrast to the statements of politicians and health care insurance companies--we are not overtreating but rather undertreating our patients regarding medications for secondary prevention.", 
    "71": "The major cause of morbidity and mortality associated with coronary atherosclerosis is plaque rupture, which often results in one of the acute coronary syndromes: unstable angina, non-Q-wave myocardial infarction (MI), or Q-wave MI. Plaque rupture may be attributable to the thickness of the overlying fibrous cap; thinner plaques are more likely to rupture. It appears that the presence of inflammation is a significant contributor to rupture. Acute-phase treatments are highly efficacious, but secondary prevention, often overlooked, also is life-saving. Diet, exercise, and medications are the interventions available for secondary prevention. Four classes of medications--aspirin, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins)--are also used in this setting with a high degree of success in reducing mortality and morbidity. Numerous studies have demonstrated a 30-50% reduction in mortality with aspirin. The reduction in mortality achieved with beta blockers in studies of patients after myocardial infarction are 15-50%. ACE inhibitors significantly reduce the risk of death from myocardial infarction in patients with coronary artery disease with or without myocardial infarction. Statins are beneficial even in patients whose cholesterol level is low to normal. Patients who were discharged on a statin showed a 50% reduction in mortality over those who did not receive statin therapy independent of lipid level. C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation, is predictive of mortality, as are age and ejection fraction. Statins may be anti-inflammatory in addition to their lipid-lowering effect. Secondary-prevention strategies such as case management, electronic discharge prompting, better communication between referring physicians and cardiologists, and patient education may also have positive effects on after-discharge morbidity and mortality.",

These data demonstrate that multiple dosing of simvastatin, at the highest recommended clinical dose, does not significantly alter the in vivo hepatic or intestinal CYP3A4/5 activity as measured by the commonly used EBT and oral midazolam probes.", 
    "81": "There is controversial evidence that a low serum cholesterol level is associated with an increased risk of depression, suicide, and violence. The aim of this study was to identify or exclude any small or infrequent adverse effect of long-term reduction of serum cholesterol with pravastatin sodium on psychological well-being.", 
    "82": "The study population consisted of 1130 respondents from a representative sample of 1222 patients with stable coronary artery disease participating in the Long-term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischaemic Disease (LIPID) study. Subjects were randomized in a double-blind manner to treatment with pravastatin sodium, 40 mg/d (n = 559), or placebo (n = 571) for at least 4 years. Psychological well-being was assessed with a standard self-administered questionnaire at baseline and after 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and 4 years. The questionnaire assessed anxiety and depression, anger, impulsiveness, alcohol consumption, and adverse life events.", 
    "83": "Serum cholesterol levels decreased by an average of 1.3 mmol/L (50 mg/dL) with pravastatin therapy and did not change with placebo. During follow-up there was no significant difference by treatment group in measures of anxiety and depression, anger expression, or impulsiveness (95% confidence interval excluded differences of >0.2 SD) and no difference in the proportion of subjects with excessive alcohol consumption or adverse life events (odds ratio, 1.0; 95% confidence interval, 0.8-1.2). There was no evidence of a treatment effect for persons whose baseline serum cholesterol level was in the lowest 10% (<4.6 mmol/L [178 mg/dL]) or whose scores for anxiety and depression, anger, or impulsiveness were in the highest 10% at baseline. There was no association between change in the serum cholesterol level and measures of anxiety and depression, anger, or impulsiveness during follow-up.",

    "86": "The purpose of this study was to determine if long-term use of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, or simvastatin) resulted in tachyphylaxis (a decreasing response to a physiologically active agent). To determine this, the charts of 254 patients treated with statins from the years 1996 to 1998 were retrospectively reviewed. During treatment, the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels of patients were followed for a minimum of 300 days. To characterize LDL cholesterol changes during statin therapy, linear and nonlinear kinetic models were generated. Tachyphylaxis, defined as a positive slope of LDL cholesterol over time, after maximum LDL cholesterol reduction, was identified in patients treated with atorvastatin at exposure doses of 10 or 20 mg/day. All other statins, at all doses reviewed, showed no [corrected] evidence of tachyphylaxis. LDL cholesterol tachyphylaxis appeared to be a unique response to prolonged use of long half-life atorvastatin therapy at exposure dosages.", 
    "87": "Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and disturbances in postprandial lipoprotein metabolism are both associated with premature atherosclerosis. The effect of beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors on plasma cholesterol levels in patients with FH is well established; however, it is not known whether postprandial lipoproteins are also influenced. In this case-controlled intervention study, we investigated the effects of high-dose simvastatin on postprandial lipoproteins. We used a new method to analyze remnant lipoproteins based on the immunoseparation principle (remnant-like particle cholesterol [RLP-C] assay) and the well-established measurement of retinyl ester (RE) analysis in plasma and in the Svedberg flotation unit (Sf)<1000 fraction. Seven heterozygous FH patients and 7 control subjects matched for sex, age, body mass index, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein E genotype were enrolled in the study. An oral vitamin A (RE) fat-loading test was performed at baseline in both groups and after 3 months of high-dose simvastatin (80 mg/d) treatment in the FH patients. Before treatment, FH patients had significantly higher fasting and postprandial concentrations of lipoprotein remnants (plasma RLP-C 42+/-19 mg/dL and area under the RLP-C curve 415+/-82 mg. L(-1). h(-1), respectively) than did control subjects (7+/-3 mg/dL and 101+/-35 mg. L( -1). h(-1), respectively; P<0.05), suggesting a delayed clearance of chylomicron remnant particles in the FH patients. Treatment with simvastatin significantly reduced fasting and postprandial remnant lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations (13+/-3 mg/dL and 136+/-53 mg. L(-1). h(-1), respectively; P<0.05 for both). Postprandial RE in the Sf<1000 fraction, not total RE in plasma, was also significantly higher in FH patients than in control subjects (24+/-10 versus 6.3+/-5.9 mg. L( -1). h(-1), P<0.05), but treatment with simvastatin did not result in improvement of the postprandial RE response, either in the Sf<1000 fraction or in plasma. It is concluded that heterozygous FH patients have increased fasting and postprandial remnant lipoprotein concentrations. Treatment with simvastatin significantly reduced the fasting and postprandial RLP-C concentrations but did not result in improved postprandial RE response.", 
    "88": "The effect of untreated total cholesterol (TC) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) as cardiovascular risk factors in both primary and secondary prevention has been extensively investigated. The predictive value of on-treatment lipid and apolipoprotein levels on subsequent cardiovascular events is as yet uncertain. Eight hundred forty-eight patients (675 men and 173 women) with angiographically proven coronary artery disease (CAD) who received effective statin therapy (>/=30% decrease of baseline TC) were studied. We analyzed the predictive value of on-treatment levels of TC, LDL-C, triglycerides (TG), apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) and apolipoprotein B (apoB) on subsequent myocardial infarction (MI) and all cause mortality. On-treatment LDL-C levels were 2.55+/-0.55 mmol/L and 2.58+/-0.62 mmol/L for men and women respectively. Age-adjusted Cox regression analysis showed that only on-treatment apoA-I was predictive for future CAD events in both men and women, whereas on-treatment HDL-C was exclusively predictive in women. On-treatment apoB levels were predictive for recurrent CAD events in the total population but not after separate analysis for men and women. On-treatment levels of TC, LDL-C, and TG did not predict subsequent events. Multivariate analysis showed that on-treatment apoA-I and apoB were the only significant predictors for future cardiovascular events. On-treatment levels of TC, LDL-C, and TG were no longer associated with increased risk of recurrent cardiovascular events in CAD patients treated to target levels, which justifies the current guidelines. However, on-treatment levels of apoB and in particular apoA-I (and HDL-C in women) were significantly predictive for MI and all-cause mortality and may therefore be more suitable for cardiovascular risk assessment in this population.", 
    "89": "Two major entities continue to be controversial in the field of clinical myotoxicity: the various myopathies that are induced by the cholesterol-lowering agents and the acute quadriplegic myopathy of intensive care. Both conditions are relatively common, but their pathogenesis is unclear. The problematic issues related to these disorders are presented, with suggested topics for future research.", 
    "90": "The influence of genetic polymorphism of the apolipoprotein B on lipid metabolism and coronary heart disease (CHD) risk has been demonstrated in different populations, but few studies have shown the contribution of this risk factor in individuals from Brazil. The Ins/del, Xbal and EcoRI polymorphisms of apo B were evaluated in 93 controls and in 104 Caucasian individuals presenting with a high risk lipid profile (HR1) for CHD; 54 of these subjects (HR2) were treated with fluvastatin during 16 weeks. DNA polymorphisms of the apo B gene were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. The X(-)X(-) genotype for Xbal polymorphism was associated with higher serum concentrations of total cholesterol (TC) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (p<0.01) in women of the HR1 group. The Ins/del and EcoRI polymorphisms were not associated with variation of lipid profile. After treatment with fluvastatin, TC and LDL-C levels of HR2 individuals were reduced by 23% and 30%, respectively. Individuals with II genotype had significantly greater reduction (34%) of LDL-C than those with ID/DD genotypes (27%). These results indicate that the Xbal polymorphism is associated with variation of serum TC and LDL-C levels in Brazilian women with lipid profile of risk for CHD and the Ins/del polymorphism is associated with the therapeutic response to fluvastatin.", 
    "91": "Coronary heart disease is the major cause of death in the industrialised world. As the prevalence increases with advancing age, coronary heart disease will be a growing problem as the average age of the population increases. The cost of treatment following an acute coronary syndrome is considerable and there is a substantial risk of further episodes. However, there is much evidence that the disease is a dynamic and reversible process and further episodes are preventable. Numerous trials have shown the efficacy of statins in coronary heart disease. The most recent studies have shown efficacy in secondary prevention when statin therapy was started early (hours/days) after an acute episode. Although guidelines recommend that statin therapy should be initiated following an acute coronary syndrome, prescription rates seem to be static at around 40%. A number of measures need to be taken to improve the situation. Firstly, each hospital and coronary care unit should implement a clearly defined protocol delineating patient management following hospital admission. Provision of comprehensive discharge information should be a key feature of this communication. Secondly, regular audit of prescribing habits is essential to assess the situation. Finally, patient adherence to their regimen should be improved by collaborative involvement of doctor and patient in planning and implementing the treatment regimen.",

    "93": "During the 1999 Annual Meeting of the National Association of Hospital Cardiologists (ANMCO) a questionnaire was included in the meeting material. The aim was two-fold: 1) to evaluate whether Italian cardiologists approve the National Health System policy to reimburse only pravastatin and simvastatin for secondary prevention, and 2) to assess which end-points are considered sufficient to grant the reimbursement of additional HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.", 
    "94": "Two hundred and thirty-two completed questionnaires were collected and analyzed: 90.1% (95% confidence interval-CI between 85.1 and 93.6%) of cardiologists agree that only HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors with evidence-based mortality reduction should be reimbursed in Italy for secondary prevention; 75.0% (95% CI between 69.4 and 80.6%) follow the State guidelines in order to choose the approved HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and 69.4% (95% CI between 63.5 and 75.3%) judge that at least the demonstration of coronary artery plaque reduction should be considered as an evidence-based decision to include new HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors for reimbursement.", 
    "95": "Most of Italian cardiologists who answered the questionnaire agreed with the limitation of reimbursement to only HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors with evidence-based demonstration of mortality reduction and asserted that the only reduction in blood cholesterol levels should not be considered proof of efficacy.", 
    "96": "Asynchronously growing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells treated with the pro-drug, beta-lactone ring form of lovastatin were arrested in G(1)-phase. Subsequent removal of lovastatin resulted in the synchronous entry of cells into S-phase regardless of the presence of mevalonic acid. Lovastatin-arrested cells contained hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (Rb) and required serum mitogens to enter S-phase after lovastatin removal, indicating that cell-cycle arrest is prior to the restriction point (R-point). However, in contrast to quiescent cells, intact nuclei prepared from lovastatin-arrested cells were competent for DNA replication when introduced into Xenopus egg extracts. Initiation of replication by Xenopus egg cytosol took place specifically within the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) origin locus, demonstrating that cells were arrested after the origin decision point (ODP). We conclude that the beta-lactone ring form of lovastatin is an effective reagent with which to synchronize CHO cells between the ODP and R-point, without resulting in the withdrawal of cells from the cell-cycle into a quiescent state.",

    "98": "A clinical outcomes model was developed to estimate the ability of fibrates and statins to reduce the relative and absolute risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD) in patients with diabetes. A database was constructed, drawing on results from 83 applicable published studies. Risk factor outcomes reported by the model were chosen according to those found to be statistically significant in the data set parameters from the Framingham Heart Study. In the analysis, fenofibrate was compared with gemfibrozil (an earlier fibrate) and six 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase-inhibitor or \"statin\" agents. Among the agents studied, only fenofibrate was found to significantly affect all six cardiovascular disease risk factors used in this analysis. For men with diabetes, the estimated absolute risk of developing CHD after five years of treatment was lowered equally and most effectively by fenofibrate, simvastatin, and atorvastatin, from 10% to 6%. For women with diabetes, fenofibrate and simvastatin reduced absolute risk from 9% to 6% over five years of treatment, while atorvastatin reduced risk from 9% to 6%. An accompanying cost comparison analysis found that reducing absolute risk of CHD in these patients would result in significant reductions in the medical expense of treating cardiac events, and that significant differences in the amount saved were driven by treatment choice. Fenofibrate, simvastatin, and atorvastatin produced the greatest long-term savings.", 
    "99": "Endothelial dysfunction represents the earliest stage of atherosclerosis and is usually present in hypercholesterolemia. Treatment with statins has been shown to normalize endothelial function in middle-aged men with hypercholesterolemia. We evaluated the effect over time of atorvastatin on the endothelial reactivity in postmenopausal hypercholesterolemic women (mean age, 58 +/- 6 years), receiving atorvastatin, 10 mg daily (n = 20) or American Heart Association step 1 diet (n = 10) for 8 weeks. Lipid profile and brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation (FMV) were determined at baseline and after 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks. FMV increased progressively in subjects treated with atorvastatin, and the difference was significant (p < 0.05 vs. baseline) after the second week (baseline 3.8 +/- 3%; first week, 4.8 +/- 3%; second week, 9.2 +/- 3%; fourth week, 11.0 +/- 3%; eighth week, 11.7 +/- 3%). No significant changes were observed in subjects receiving diet (baseline, 3.1 +/- 4%; first week, 2.4 +/- 2%; second week, 2.9 +/- 2%; fourth week, 3.1 +/- 2%; eighth week, 3.3 +/- 2%; p = NS). In the atorvastatin group, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol showed a significant decrease since the first week (baseline, 228 +/- 37 mg/dl; first week, 171 +/- 32; second week, 147 +/- 27; fourth week, 139 +/- 29; eighth week, 135 +/- 27; all p < 0.05). In the control group, LDL cholesterol showed a smaller but significant (p < 0.05) reduction after the second week (baseline, 226 +/- 17 mg/dl; first week, 225 +/- 16; second week, 220 +/- 17; fourth week, 203 +/- 27; eighth week, 198 +/- 27). In conclusion, hypercholesterolemic women treated with atorvastatin show a significant improvement in endothelial reactivity after as early as 2 weeks of therapy. The extent to which these beneficial effects are attributable to cholesterol reduction or to a direct effect of the drug remains to be established.",

Thirteen healthy, untreated subjects were the controls.", 
    "102": "Baseline TERalb was higher and responsiveness to both acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside was depressed in patients compared with controls. One-month high-dose simvastatin reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 39%, normalized TERalb, and improved local vasomotor responses to acetylcholine, without modifying those to sodium nitroprusside. Changes in TERalb and acetylcholine-mediated vasodilatation were dissociated and unrelated to lipid modifications.", 
    "103": "Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction through 1 month of high-dose simvastatin normalized the exaggerated transvascular albumin leakage of patients with hypercholesterolemic atherosclerosis, perhaps by restoring an exaggerated endothelial permeability, apparently through mechanisms independent of circulating lipids. Improvements in acetylcholine-mediated vasomotion were also evident, but were dissociated from TERalb, demonstrating a heterogeneous behavior of the 2 indices of endothelial function in response to high-dose statin treatment.",

Itraconazole coadministration produced similar changes in pravastatin pharmacokinetics [AUC elevated 51% (P < .05 versus pravastatin alone), 24% (Cmax), and 23% (t1/2), respectively]. However, itraconazole dramatically increased atorvastatin AUC (150%), Cmax (38%), and t1/2 (30%) (P < .05).

For safety reasons, the study was performed in three parts to allow simvastatin-free days between the study days. Serum concentrations of simvastatin and simvastatin acid were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry up to 12 hours.",

    "114": "Colesevelam hydrochloride (formerly known as Cholestagel((R)) and re-named WelCholtrade mark, GelTex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Sankyo Parke-Davis) is a new, polymeric, high potency, water-absorbing hydrogel. It has been shown to be a safe and effective cholesterol-lowering agent with a non-systemic mechanism of action, good tolerability and minimal side effects. To date, the lipid-lowering activity of colesevelam has been evaluated in approximately 1400 subjects. Colesevelam reduces low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels, in a dose-dependent manner, by as much as 20% (median) in patients with hypercholesterolaemia. Dosing regimen evaluations indicate that colesevelam is effective at both once per day and twice daily dosing and that concurrent administration of colesevelam with hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins), specifically lovastatin, does not alter the absorption of the statin. Combination therapy with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, including lovastatin, simvastatin and atorvastatin, produces an additional reduction (8 - 16%) in LDL-cholesterol levels above that seen with the statin alone. The overall incidence of adverse effects with colesevelam alone and in combination with statins is comparable with that seen with placebo. Colesevelam lacks the constipating effect seen with typical bile acid sequestrants, a trait that would be expected to improve compliance with lipid-lowering therapy. Colesevelam, recently approved by the US FDA, represents a valuable non-absorbed alternative in the armamentarium against hypercholesterolaemia, both for monotherapy and combination therapy, as an adjunct to diet and exercise.", 
    "115": "An elevated level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol has been recognised as the most important risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD). Development of the inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) ('statins'), a rate-limiting key enzyme of cholesterol synthesis pathway, has revolutionised the cholesterol-lowering therapy. In the last decade, effective primary and secondary preventive measures have been established in several statin trials to prevent future events of CAD by lowering LDL-cholesterol levels. These results supported the 'lower is better' hypothesis in the relationship between LDL-cholesterol levels and CAD. NK-104 (pitavastatin, previously named as itavastatin or nisvastatin, Kowa Company Ltd., Tokyo) has recently been developed as a new chemically synthesised and powerful statin. On the basis of reported data, the potency of NK-104 is dose-dependent and appears to be equivalent to that of atorvastatin. This new statin is safe and well-tolerated in the treatment of patients with hypercholesterolaemia. The cytochrome P450 system only slightly modifies NK-104, which suggests the clinical advantage of this agent, because the prevalence of clinically significant interactions with a number of other commonly used drugs can be considered to be extremely low. NK-104 can provide a new and potentially superior therapeutic agent when compared with currently available other statins. Randomised controlled clinical trials to assess the long-term effects of this new statin on CAD would be required.", 
    "116": "This review describes the major developments in lipid-regulating drugs during the past two years. Most of the novel compounds that have been launched or were in their final stages of development during this period are aimed primarily at lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol. These include bile acid sequestrants, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and a cholesterol absorption inhibitor. In addition, there have been preclinical reports suggesting the potential usefulness of orally bioavailable inhibitors of cholesterol ester transfer protein in plasma and of acylcoA:cholesterol acyltransferase in monocyte-macrophages. The recent discovery of the roles of the scavenger receptor class B Type 1 and ATP-binding cassette transporter 1 in high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol transport may shift the trend of future developments away from compounds that lower LDL to those aimed at promoting HDL turnover.", 
    "117": "Squalene is a triterpene that is an intermediate of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway and it can be obtained from the diet. Olive oil contains 0.2-0.7% squalene. The average intake of squalene is 30 mg/day in the United States, however, when consumption of olive oil is high, the intake of squalene can reach 200-400 mg/day as observed in Mediterranean countries. The decreased risk for various cancers associated with high olive oil consumption may be due to the presence of squalene. Experimental studies have shown that squalene can effectively inhibit chemically-induced colon, lung and skin tumourigenesis in rodents. The protective effect is observed when squalene is given before and/or during carcinogen treatment. The mechanisms involved for the chemopreventive activity of squalene may include inhibition of Ras farnesylation, modulation of carcinogen activation and anti-oxidative activities. However, several factors must be taken into consideration when the evidence for the inhibition of carcinogenesis by squalene is examined, these include the effective dose used and the time of exposure. The information obtained is from animal bioassays and the long-term effects from consuming increased levels of squalene are not known. Although animal studies have enhanced our understanding of the possible action of squalene in decreasing carcinogenesis, one must apply caution in extrapolating the information obtained in animal studies to humans, because of possible species differences. In order to evaluate the overall implications of squalene to human cancer prevention, further studies are needed to fully identify its protective effects, as well as possible detrimental effects.", 
    "118": "Cholesterol lowering involving different therapies improves the clinical outcome of patients. To define the underlying pathomechanism, we studied whether treatment with statins was associated with changes in blood thrombogenicity, endothelial dysfunction and soluble adhesion molecule levels. Fifty hypercholesterolemic patients were treated with pravastatin (40 mg/day, n=24) or simvastatin (20 mg/day, n=26). Lipid profile and blood thrombogenicity were assessed in all patients before and after 3 months of cholesterol reducing therapy. Blood thrombogenicity was assessed as thrombus formation, perfusing non-anticoagulated blood directly from the patients' vein through the Badimon perfusion chamber (shear rate 1690/s). Endothelial-dependent vasomotor response was tested by laser-Doppler flowmeter. Soluble adhesion molecule level were measured by ELISA. Total and LDL cholesterol were reduced in the two treatment groups by statin therapy. Statin therapy was associated with a significant reduction in blood thrombogenicity and endothelium-dependent vasoresponse. No differences were observed between simvastatin or pravastatin treatment. Lipid lowering by statins had no effect on plasma levels of fibrinogen, sL-selectin, sP-selectin and sICAM-1 antigen. Cholesterol lowering by both statins reduced the increased blood reactivity and endothelial dysfunction present under hypercholesterolemia. The multiple effects of lipid lowering therapy by statins may explain the benefits observed in recent epidemiological trials.", 
    "119": "The efficacy of atorvastatin, a new hydroxymethylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase inhibitor, in reducing serum lipid levels, modifying lipoprotein composition, and suppressing cholesterol synthesis was evaluated in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (homozygous FH) undergoing LDL-apheresis therapy. Atorvastatin was given in escalating doses (10, 20, and 40 mg/day) to nine patients with homozygous FH. Five of nine patients responded well to atorvastatin; four of these patients were receptor-defective and the remaining one was receptor-negative. The change in LDL-cholesterol in the receptor-defective patients averaged -20.6% compared to the baseline level at the highest dose of atorvastatin. Of five receptor-negative type patients, only one showed good response to atorvastatin therapy with a LDL-cholesterol reduction of 14.9%. Although the other four receptor-negative patients did not show a change in LDL-cholesterol, all of them exhibited a considerable increase in HDL-cholesterol. All patients showed reduced urinary excretion of mevalonic acid, suggesting that atorvastatin decreases LDL-cholesterol by inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis even where LDL-receptor activity is not present. Atorvastatin also decreased serum triglycerides in both receptor-negative and defective patients, especially in the latter. As cholesterol level rebounds quickly after each apheresis procedure, a combination therapy using atorvastatin and apheresis may increase the efficacy of the apheresis treatment, improving cost-benefit effectiveness by reducing the frequency of the apheresis treatment.",

In the hepatoma cell line HepG2, Lifibrol decreased the formation of sterols from [14C]-acetic acid by approximately 25%. Similar to lovastatin, lifibrol had no effect on the synthesis of sterols from [14C]-mevalonic acid. Lifibrol did not inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. Instead, cholesterol synthesis inhibition by lifibrol was entirely accounted for by competitive inhibition of HMG-CoA synthase. Lifibrol enhanced the cellular binding, uptake, and degradation of LDL in cultured cells in a dose dependent fashion. The stimulation of LDL receptors was significantly stronger than expected from the effect of lifibrol on sterol synthesis. In parallel, lifibrol increased the amount of immunologically detectable receptor protein. Stimulation of LDL receptor mediated endocytosis was observed both in the presence and in the absence of cholesterol-containing lipoproteins. In the absence of an extracellular source of cholesterol, both lifibrol and lovastatin induced microsomal HMG-CoA reductase. Co-incubation with LDL was sufficient to suppress the lifibrol mediated increase in reductase activity, indicating that lifibrol does not affect the production of the non-sterol derivative(s) which are thought to regulate HMG-CoA reductase activity at the post-transcriptional level. Considered together, the data suggest that the hypolipidemic action of lifibrol may, at least in part, be mediated by sterol-independent stimulation of the LDL receptor pathway. A potential advantage of lifibrol is that therapeutic concentrations do not interfere with the production of mevalonate which is required not only to synthesize sterols but also as a precursor of electron transport moieties, glycoproteins and farnesylated proteins.", 
    "121": "Nitric oxide (NO) produced by the endothelium of cerebral arterioles is an important mediator of endothelium-dependent vasodilation (EDV), and also helps to prevent thrombosis and vascular remodeling. A number of risk factors for ischemic stroke are associated with impaired EDV, and this defect is usually at least partially attributable to a decrease in the production and/or stability of NO. These risk factors include hypertension, high-sodium diets, homocysteine, diabetes, visceral obesity, and aging. Conversely, many measures which may provide protection from ischemic stroke - such as ample dietary intakes of potassium, arginine, fish oil, and selenium - can have a favorable impact on EDV. Protection afforded by exercise training, estrogen replacement, statin drugs, green tea polyphenols, and cruciferous vegetables may reflect increased expression of the endothelial NO synthase. IGF-I activity stimulates endothelial NO production, and conceivably is a mediator of the protection associated with higher-protein diets in Japanese epidemiology and in hypertensive rats. These considerations prompt the conclusion that modulation of NO availability is a crucial determinant of risk for ischemic stroke. Multifactorial strategies for promoting effective cerebrovascular NO activity, complemented by measures that stabilize platelets and moderate blood viscosity, should minimize risk for ischemic stroke and help maintain vigorous cerebral perfusion into ripe old age. The possibility that such measures will also diminish risk for Alzheimer's disease, and slow the normal age-related decline in mental acuity, merits consideration. A limited amount of ecologic epidemiology suggests that both stroke and senile dementia may be extremely rare in cultures still consuming traditional unsalted whole-food diets. Other lines of evidence suggest that promotion of endothelial NO activity may decrease risk for age-related macular degeneration.", 
    "122": "It is now recognised that acute myocardial infarction results from the rupture of atherosclerotic plaques. Lymphocytes and macrophages, which infiltrate rupture sites, contribute to plaque degradation by expressing urokinase (u-PA) bound to cell membrane by urokinase receptor (u-PAR) and by secreting metalloproteinase MMP-9. We have previously demonstrated that the uptake of oxidised LDL (ox-LDL) by monocytes induces an increase of u-PA and u-PAR expression. The present study shows that the expression of u-PA and u-PAR induced by ox-LDL on monocyte surface is suppressed by cerivastatin (a synthetic inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, Bayer) from 2 nM. This leads to reduced plasmin generation and monocyte adhesion to vitronectin. Furthermore, higher concentrations of cerivastatin (50-100 nM) reduce the expression of u-PA and u-PAR on unstimulated monocytes. It also inhibits MMP-9 secretion but has no effect on TIMP-1 secretion, suggesting that the decrease in MMP-9 has a real protective effect on plaque stabilisation. The inhibitory effect of cerivastatin on u-PA expression and MMP-9 secretion can be explained by the inhibition of NF-kappa B translocation into the nucleus, as shown by immunofluorescence. As farnesyl-pyrophosphate reverses the effect of cerivastatin, it is postulated that these effects could also be due to the inhibition of Ras prenylation. This was confirmed by confocal microscopy, which shows the Ras delocalisation from the monocyte membrane. The cerivastatin-induced effects on monocyte functions could explain, at least in part, the protective effect of this drug against atherothrombotic events.", 
    "123": "The West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS) showed that pravastatin reduced the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) events in 6,595 middle-aged hypercholesterolaemic men aged 45-64 years without prior myocardial infarction followed for an average of 4.9 years. We hypothesised prospectively (a) that baseline levels of haemorheological variables were related to baseline and incident CHD and to mortality; and (b) that reduction in lipoproteins by pravastatin would lower plasma and blood viscosity, a potential contributory mechanism to CHD events. We therefore studied plasma and blood viscosity, fibrinogen, haematocrit, and blood cell counts at baseline and 1 year. At baseline, plasma and blood viscosity were related to risk factors, CHD measures, and claudication. On univariate analysis, baseline levels of all rheological variables (except platelet count) were related to incident CHD; CHD mortality; and total mortality. On multivariate analysis including baseline CHD and risk factors, plasma and blood viscosity, haematocrit and white cell count each remained significantly associated with incident CHD; while fibrinogen remained an independent predictor of mortality (all p < 0.03). After one year, lipoprotein reduction by pravastatin was associated with significant reductions (about one quarter of a standard deviation) in plasma viscosity (mean difference 0.02 mPa.s, p <0.001) and in blood viscosity (mean difference 0.06 mPa.s, p<0.001), but was not associated with significant changes in other rheological variables. We therefore suggest that pravastatin therapy, which reduces elevated lipoproteins in hypercholesterolaemic men, may lower risks of CHD and mortality partly by lowering plasma and blood viscosity. Further studies are required to test this hypothesis.", 
    "124": "Use of lipid-lowering drugs in both primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) decreases significantly risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, incidence of cardiovascular events, reduces the cardiovascular mortality and morbidity as well as total mortality. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are most potent cholesterol-lowering drugs. Statins act by inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase activity, a rate--limiting step in synthesis of cholesterol and important metabolites of mevalonate--isoprenoids. The mechanisms by which favourable antiatherogenic actions of statins occur are complex. Statins inhibit proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells, reduce free-radicals generation and LDL modification, lower Lp(a) concentration, inhibit macrophage-derived foam cells accumulation and inhibit activation of platelets, thromboxane and PAI-1 synthesis. Use of statins in the therapy of hypercholesterolemia is presently recommended by NCEP, especially in high-risk groups (diabetes, post-CABG and PTCA, kidney and heart transplantation). Nevertheless, patients with CAD and moderately elevated LDL-C levels also benefit from the treatment with statins. Because of high costs of the therapy, statins of most favourable pharmacoeconomic profile should be used.", 
    "125": "Uncoupling proteins (UCPs) are mitochondrial membrane proton transporters that uncouple respiration from oxidative phosphorylation by dissipating the proton gradient across the membrane. We studied the direct effect of several peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) ligands on UCP-3 and UCP-2 mRNA expression in C2C12 myotubes for 24 h. In the absence of exogenous fatty acids, treatment of C2C12 cells with a selective PPARalpha activator (Wy-14,643) or a non-selective PPAR activator (bezafibrate) did not affect the expression of UCP-3 mRNA levels, whereas UCP-2 expression was slightly increased. In contrast, troglitazone, a thiazolidinedione which selectively activates PPARgamma, strongly decreased UCP-3 and UCP-2 mRNA levels. Another thiazolidinedione, ciglitazone, had the same effect, but to a lower extent, suggesting that PPARgamma activation is involved. Further, the presence of 0.5 mM oleic acid strongly increased UCP-3 mRNA levels and troglitazone addition failed to block the effect of this fatty acid. The drop in UCP expression after thiazolidinedione treatment correlated well with a reduction in PPARalpha mRNA levels produced by this drug, linking the reduction in PPARalpha mRNA levels with the down-regulation of UCP mRNA in C2C12 myotubes after thiazolidinedione treatment.",

This study investigates the influence of short term treatment with simvastatin on plasma chemotactic activity and adherence of polymorphonuclear neutrophils in hypercholesterolemic patients.", 
    "131": "20 hypercholesterolemic patients (250-400 mg/dl) were given simvastatin (20 mg daily for 12 weeks). Peripheral blood samples were taken before and after 4 and 12 weeks of the therapy. The percentage of neutrophils adhering to plastic surface coated with albumin was significantly higher when cells were incubated with plasma obtained after 12 weeks of treatment with simvastatin in comparison with plasma collected before the therapy (unstimulated neutrophils: 5.945+/-0.475% vs. 8.155+/-0.96%, P=0.0477, stimulated neutrophils: 39.09+/-4.540% vs. 29.18+/-3.702%, P=0.032). There was a significant negative correlation between adherence of stimulated neutrophils and total cholesterol levels ((r)=-0.2796, 95% CI -0. 4999 to -0.02526, r(2)=0.07817, P=0.032). Migration of neutrophils towards plasma obtained after 12 weeks of treatment with simvastatin was significantly higher than towards plasma collected before the therapy (7.038+/-1.127 vs. 4.505+/-0 618 P=0.0475).",

    "133": "Lovastatin, a hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, was found to block the synthesis of cholesterol and to affect posttranslational modification or isoprenylation, which is essential for membrane localization and biological activity of several proteins including Ras in the signal transduction pathway. Ras activates a multitude of downstream activities with roles in cellular processing, including invasion and metastasis. We investigated the anti-invasive activity of lovastatin in NIH 3T3 and v-H-Ras-transformed NIH 3T3 (v-H-Ras 3T3) cells. Lovastatin suppressed cell invasion in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. By zymographic assay, a decrease in matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activity but not matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) activity by lovastatin was detected. RT-PCR demonstrated a reduction in gene expression of MMP-9 after treatment with lovastastin. To confirm the lovastatin-induced down-regulation of MMP-9 expression, we transfected an MMP-9/luciferase reporter vector, under MMP-9 promoter control, into both NIH 3T3 and v-H-Ras 3T3. A reduction in luciferase activity was observed with lovastatin treatment. In addition, lovastatin also reduced AP-1 and NFkappaB binding activities. These anti-invasive features were attenuated by the presence of mevalonate. These results suggest that down-regulation of MMP-9 contributes to the anti-invasive activity of lovastatin. Furthermore, we added exogenous mevalonate, which enhances the potency of cell invasion, and Ras farnesyltransferase inhibitor (manumycin A), which inhibits the potency of cell invasion. In accordance, Western blot analysis showed that lovastatin decreased membrane localization of Ras proteins. These data indicate that the anti-invasion activity of lovastatin happens through a decrease in Ras isoprenylation and functions.", 
    "134": "The long-term efficacy and safety of fluvastatin monotherapy was compared with that of the combination of fluvastatin and fenofibrate in 104 patients with coronary heart disease and combined hyperlipidemia in an open, randomised, parallel group, clinical study of 78 weeks duration. Combined hyperlipidemia was defined as LDL-cholesterol 4.1 mmol/l and higher and triglycerides between 2.5 and 4.5 mmol/l after 8 weeks of dietary intervention. The patients were treated with either fluvastatin 40 mg daily or with the combination of fluvastatin (20 mg daily) and micronized fenofibrate 200 mg daily. Mean values of total and LDL-cholesterol decreased by 19.3% and 29.7% respectively after fluvastatin treatment and by 21.5% and 29.1% respectively after the combination of fluvastatin and fenofibrate treatment. The differences between the treated groups were not significant. Mean values of HDL-cholesterol increased significantly more after the combination of fluvastatin and fenofibrate than after fluvastatin monotherapy (26% vs. 9.9%). The mean values of triglycerides decreased significantly more after the combination treatment than after fluvastatin monotherapy (-40.2% vs. -19.7%). The treatment in both groups was well tolerated and no signs of myopathy were observed in any patient. The study was discontinued in 1 patient due to the increase of liver enzymes. The most frequently observed side effects were minor gastrointestinal symptoms, which were more frequent in patients treated by the combination of fluvastatin and fenofibrate. Thus our results demonstrate that the combination of fluvastatin and fenofibrate is an effective and safe treatment option for patients with coronary heart disease and mild to moderate combined hyperlipidemia if a more radical lowering of triglycerides and increase of HDL-cholesterol is desired.",

There were no significant changes in either triglyceride levels or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. In the nontreated group, there were no significant changes in the TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, or triglyceride levels; there was also no change in the arteriosclerotic index.

Two authors independently extracted data from 49 trials comprising 14,130 patients.

In reducing LDL cholesterol concentrations to less than 25% of the baseline concentration, a significantly higher cost efficiency was achieved with simvastatin 2.5 mg (-53.3%/dollar). By targeting a reduction between 25% and 29%, significantly higher cost efficiencies were found with simvastatin 5 mg (-28.9%/dollar), cerivastatin 0.2 mg (-23.8%/dollar) and fluvastatin 40 mg (-23.3%/dollar). For reductions in LDL cholesterol concentrations of 30% to 34%, statistically higher cost efficiencies were achieved with simvastatin 20 mg (-15.0%/dollar) and pravastatin 40 mg (-14. 4%/dollar). Finally, atorvastatin 10 mg yielded a value of -22. 9%/dollar for a 36% reduction in LDL cholesterol concentration.",

    "144": "Mesangial cells play an important role in physiologic functions, including the regulation of glomerular filtration, and as a pathogenic factor for proliferative glomerulonephritis. We compared the potencies of the inhibitory effects of simvastatin acid, lovastatin acid, and pravastatin on fetal bovine serum (FBS)-induced proliferation of rat cultured mesangial cells, and examined the correlation between their inhibitory effects and intracellular concentrations. We also investigated the transport of the statins in the cells, and whether or not their intracellular concentrations were determined by their transport characteristics. It appeared that the growth inhibitory effects on FBS-induced proliferation of mesangial cells of simvastatin acid and lovastatin acid were approximately the same, but that of pravastatin was extremely weak compared with the others. The growth inhibitory effects of these agents were suggested to depend, at least in part, on the amount incorporated intracellularly. Simvastatin acid, lovastatin acid, and pravastatin appeared to be taken up by mesangial cells via a common carrier, the uptake capacity being determined by their lipophilicity. Therefore, it was thought that the growth inhibitory effects of the statins partially depended on their carrier-mediated uptake by mesangial cells.", 
    "145": "Hydrogen atom abstraction rate constants for the reaction of tert-butoxyl and 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors lovastatin, simvastatin, and statins I-IV were measured. This series of diene-containing drugs is known to be prone to oxidation. The tert-butoxyl radical was generated by the thermolysis of di-tert-butylperoxyoxalate at 40 degrees C. A competitive kinetic method was used to determine the relative rate of hydrogen atom abstraction by tert-butoxyl radical to beta-scission. The absolute rate constants were calculated using the experimentally determined product ratios of t-butanol to acetone and the known rate of beta-scission of tert-butoxyl radical. The rate constants for the reaction with DPPH radical were measured spectrophotometrically by monitoring the loss of DPPH radical as a function of substrate concentration. The rate constants correlate well with the structure of the molecules studied. These kinetic techniques allow for oxidatively sensitive compounds to be identified early in the drug development cycle. The tert-butoxyl radical, a strong hydrogen atom abstractor, is representative of the hydroxyl (. OH) and alkoxyl (. OR) radicals; in contrast the DPPH radical, a much weaker radical, is a good kinetic model for hydroperoxyl (. OOH) and peroxyl (. OOR) radicals. These kinetic methods can be used to quantitatively assess the lability of drug candidates towards reaction with oxygen-centered radicals at an early stage of development and facilitate the design of inhibiting strategies.",

In contrast to prevailing beliefs, this risk was shown to coincide with the trial population's risk. As the relative risk reduction documented in a trial should apply across populations, the health benefits observed in WOSCOPS can clearly be extrapolated. This information in combination with local costs was then used to assess the economic efficiency of primary prevention with pravastatin in Belgium by means of a previously developed model.
