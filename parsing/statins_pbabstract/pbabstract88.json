Recent observational studies of the association between statin use and the risk of mortality in HFPEF have shown mixed results. The goal of the present study was to systematically review all published observational studies evaluating the effect of statins on the risk of mortality in HFPEF. A literature search in the PubMed and EMBASE databases was undertaken through December of 2013. Combined relative risk (RR) estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the random-effects model. Subgroup analyses, sensitivity analysis, and cumulative meta-analysis were also performed. A total of 11 eligible studies with 17,985 patients with HFPEF were included in the analysis. Statin use was associated with a 40% lower risk of mortality (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.49 to 0.74, p<0.001). Stratification of studies by controlled or uncontrolled confounding factors affected the final estimate (confounder-controlled RR 0.63, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.77, p<0.001 and confounder-uncontrolled RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.01, p=0.053). Furthermore, sensitivity analysis confirmed the stability of the results. Cumulative meta-analysis showed an obvious trend of reduction in mortality rates in statin users from 2005 to 2013. In conclusion, our meta-analysis supports the hypothesis that statin therapy may be associated with improved survival rates in patients with HFPEF. Nevertheless, randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the efficacy of statins in HFPEF.", 
    "1": "Elevated serum uric acid (UA) is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) but its association with coronary artery calcium (CAC) is inconsistent. This study examined ethnic differences in the association of UA levels with CAC severity and progression. Participants included 202 white and 166 Filipino postmenopausal women without known CVD. White women originated from the Rancho Bernardo cohort study, whereas Filipino women were convenience sampled from comparable localities. Baseline UA levels and CVD risk factors were measured in 1995 to 1999. CAC was assessed by electron beam computed tomography (EBCT) in 2000 to 2002 (EBCT1) and repeated in 2005 to 2007 (EBCT2). EBCT1 CAC density scores were categorized by severity: minimal 0 to 10, mild 11 to 100, moderate 101 to 399, and severe \u2265400. Progression was defined as CAC volume score increases of \u22652.5 mm3 between scans. White women were older at baseline than Filipinas (64.6 vs 59.3 years, p<0.001). Filipinas had increased UA levels (235.8 vs 294.2 \u03bcmol/L, p<0.001), diabetes (35.5% vs 5.2%, p<0.001), hypertension (69.6% vs 45.2%, p<0.001), and statin use (32.8% vs 18.7%, p=0.002). CAC severity did not vary by ethnicity (p=0.502), but Filipinas experienced more CAC progression than whites (53.0% vs 39.1%, p=0.016). Adjustment for CVD risk factors identified a positive association between UA levels and increasing CAC severity at EBCT1 in Filipinas (odds ratio [OR] 1.34, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05 to 1.71) but not whites (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.71 to 1.25). Higher UA levels predicted CAC progression in both cohorts (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.56). In conclusion, these results support use of UA as an ethnicity-specific marker of CAC severity and as a marker of CAC progression among postmenopausal women.", 
    "2": "Atorvastatin is an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor used in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and prevention of coronary heart disease. Oxidative stress is considered to be one of the main causes of neuropathic pain after nerve injury. This study aimed to investigate the effect of atorvastatin on oxidative stress and hyperalgesia in chronic constriction injury (CCI) model of neuropathic pain. Pain behaviour in rats was evaluated before and after atorvastatin administration using mechanical and heat hyperalgesia. The markers for oxidative stress in sciatic nerve, spinal cord and pre-frontal cortex (PFC) area of brain were biochemically detected in vehicle and atorvastatin-treated neuropathic CCI rats. Atorvastatin attenuated hyperalgesia. We found a significant increase in malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), superoxide anion (O2(-)) and protein carbonyl along with a reduction in catalase (CAT), reduced glutathione (GSH), total thiol (SH) and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) and; increase in superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels in the sciatic nerve, spinal cord and PFC of the CCI-induced neuropathic rats. Reduced levels of enzymatic and non enzymatic antioxidants were restored by atorvastatin. The levels of MDA, O2(-), and protein carbonyl in these tissues were significantly reduced in the atorvastatin-treated CCI rats compared to the untreated CCI rats. Our study demonstrated that atorvastatin attenuates neuropathic pain through inhibition of oxidative stress in sciatic nerve, spinal cord and brain suggesting antioxidants as potential drugs in neuropathic pain management. This study provides a new application of atorvastatin in treatment of neuropathic pain.",

However, management of dyslipidemia in clinical practice may require the use of other hypolipidemic agents in combination with statins. Fibrate (agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b1, PPR-\u03b1) monotherapy is effective for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia, while the combination of a fibrate with a statin is an option in the management of patients with combined dyslipidemia and diabetes mellitus who present with atherogenic dyslipidemia (low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and elevated triglyceride levels). There is evidence that the combination treatment is efficacious towards a global improvement of the lipid abnormalities with a safety profile similar to that of fibrate monotherapy with regard to liver and muscle toxicity. Nevertheless, renal function may be more commonly affected in those treated with a 'fibrate plus statin'. This concern has been raised with fibrate use either alone or in combination with a statin and should be taken into consideration when starting fibrate treatment while the pathophysiological basis and clinical implications of this drug-related effect need further investigation.",

Multiple correspondence analysis and logistic regression provided further evidence that elderly St-y were much more likely to suffer of cognitive impairment and depression than St-n. Another interesting finding was that the intensity of NL-PBMCs measured by ORO staining was greater in subjects with altered MMSE compared with cognitively normal subjects. In addition St-y had higher ORO score than St-n.",

However, the mechanisms by which statins may be therapeutic for neurological conditions are not fully understood. In this study, we present the initial evidence that oral administration of simvastatin in mice enhances Wnt signaling in\u00a0vivo. Concomitantly, simvastatin enhances neurogenesis in cultured adult neural progenitor cells as well as in the dentate gyrus of adult mice. Finally, we find that statins enhance Wnt signaling\u00a0through regulation of isoprenoid synthesis and not through cholesterol. These findings provide direct evidence that Wnt signaling is enhanced in\u00a0vivo by simvastatin and that this elevation of Wnt signaling is required for the neurogenic effects of simvastatin. Collectively, these data add to the growing body of evidence that statins may have therapeutic value for treating certain neurological disorders.", 
    "17": "Lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) generated from oxidized low-density lipoprotein by lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 plays a key role in plaque inflammation and vulnerability. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) can repair injured endothelium and exert anti-inflammatory effects of vulnerable plaque. We study the impact and mechanisms of LPC on UEA-1 and acLDL binding EPCs (UEA-1(+)acLDL(+) EPCs). UEA-1(+)acLDL(+) EPCs from coronary artery disease (CAD) patients were cultured and exposed to LPC at different concentrations and different timepoints. We determined the significant concentration (40 \u03bcM). UEA-1(+)acLDL(+) EPCs were preincubated for 30 min with pravastatin (20 \u03bcM) with LY249002, a specific inhibitor of the Akt signaling pathway, and exposed for 24 h to LPC 40 \u03bcM. The survival, migration, adhesion, and proliferation of UEA-1(+)acLDL(+) EPCs were assessed. To examine the mechanisms of LPC toxicity and pravastatin effects, phosphorylated Akt and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) levels and the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax protein expression were assessed. LPC induced apoptosis and impaired migration and adhesion of UEA-1(+)acLDL(+) EPCs significantly. The detrimental effects of LPC were attenuated by pravastatin. However, when UEA-1(+)acLDL(+) EPCs were pretreated with pravastatin and LY249002, a specific inhibitor of the Akt signaling pathway, simultaneously, the beneficial effects of pravastatin were abolished. Furthermore, LPC suppressed Akt and eNOS phosphorylation and increased Bcl-2/Bax expression. The effects of LPC on Akt/eNOS and Bcl-2/Bax activity were reversed by pravastatin. In conclusion, LPC inhibited UEA-1(+)acLDL(+) EPCs survival and impaired its functions, and these were attributable to inhibition of the Akt/eNOS and Bcl-2/Bax pathway. Pravastatin reversed the detrimental action of LPC. These findings suggest that LPC inhibition can be a possible strategy for CAD through EPC revitalization.",

The fasting sera of all animals were collected before and after 90 days treatment to determine the levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C). The aortas were pathomorphologically examined. PCNA and PDGF-A protein levels were assessed by Western blot.",

The percentages of plaque area to the total aortic area differed significantly for high- and middle-dose puerarin groups, simvastatin group and model group (P<0.05). Whole blood viscosity increased in the high-fat diet groups, while those in the treatment groups (except for the low-dose puerarin group) were significantly lower than those in the model group (P<0.05). PCNA and PDGF-A protein expression levels of rabbit aorta were low in the normal group.

    "23": "Steroid-induced osteonecrosis of the femoral head (steroid-induced ONFH) is characterized by increase of intraosseous pressure because of lipid metabolism disturbance such as elevation of adipogenesis and fat cell hypertrophy in the bone marrow, subsequently leading to disturbances of coagulation-fibrinolysis system in the femoral head and finally resulting in bone ischemia. Pravastatin has been demonstrated to be useful in preventing steroid-induced ONFH in animal models. However, its exact mechanisms acting on this disease have not been fully elucidated. To address this problem, steroid-induced ONFH rat model was constructed to evaluate the effects of pravastatin treatment on the osteonecrotic changes and repair processes. Then, Micro-CT-based micro-angiography was performed to assess the effects of pravastatin treatment on vascularization. In addition, serum lipid levels were detected by haematological examination. After that, the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3), Wnt3a, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5), \u03b2-catenin and runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) at both mRNA and protein levels were further detected by immunohistochemistry, real-time quantitative PCR, and Western blot analyses. The results, the ratio of empty lacuna, adipose tissue area, and adipocyte perimeter in the bone marrow were dramatically lower in the pravastatin treatment groups than in the model group (all P\u2009<\u20090.05). Moreover, by micro-CT quantification, pravastatin treatment dose-dependently increased vessel volume, vessel surface, percentage of vessel volume, and vessel thickness of the femoral heads of steroid-induced ONFH rats. Importantly, pravastatin treatment could prevent steroid-induced ONFH by suppressing the expression of PPAR\u03b3, and increasing the expression of Wnt3a, LRP5, \u03b2-catenin, and RUNX2, at both mRNA and protein levels, in the femoral heads of steroid-induced ONFH rats. In conclusion, Pravastatin may prevent steroid-induced ONFH by suppressing PPAR\u03b3 expression and activating Wnt signaling pathway.",

In large randomized controlled trials, statins did not demonstrate an overall mortality benefit in chronic HF patients. We currently lack adequate prospective data that aggressive lipid management in HF truly alters disease course and progression. Despite their traditional use as lipid-lowering agents, hypothesis-generating works have suggested that statins may show benefit in specific enriched HF subgroups. Given that patients hospitalized for HF continue to face a high post-discharge event rate and that statins are increasingly inexpensive, widely available, and generally well tolerated, it is imperative that we identify those HF patients most likely to benefit and reconsider testing these agents in specific subpopulations.",

Two-year follow-up was obtained for 99.2% of the patients. There were 271 deaths (3.3/100 patient-years). The mortality rate was similar to the expected mortality in the general population (p=0.93). Most deaths were noncardiovascular (1.8/100 patient-years). Among cardiovascular deaths, the leading causes were heart failure death (0.4/100 patient-years) and sudden death (0.4/100 patient-years); in contrast, there were few deaths related to vascular causes (stroke, 0.2/100 patient-years and myocardial infarction, 0.1/100 patient-years). Age, diabetes, multivessel CAD, the absence of previous coronary revascularization, previous hospitalization for decompensated heart failure, a low ejection fraction, a low estimated glomerular filtration rate, and the absence of statin treatment were independent predictors of mortality.

In 2012, the US Food and Drug Administration issued updated recommendations regarding statin medications, and the panel's comments regarding memory impairment fostered clinical confusion (in part because of the lay media's amplification). Cognitive data from several large epidemiological studies have not reliably demonstrated a robust association between incident cognitive impairment and statin use, with some studies reporting a protective effect, some reporting an increased risk and others finding no association. Although several interventional studies have evaluated statins as a possible adjunctive treatment for Alzheimer's disease, none have clearly demonstrated a benefit. A small number of case series have reported infrequent memory difficulties associated with statin use. In these series, the patients' cognitive symptoms resolved after statin discontinuation. The existing medical literature does not suggest that cognitive considerations should play a major role in medical decision making to prescribe statins for the large majority of patients. As with any medication prescribed for older adults, careful clinical monitoring for side effects should be exercised. If a patient is suspected of having idiosyncratic memory impairment associated with use of a statin medication, the drug can be discontinued. The patient should then be followed with careful clinical observation for 1-3\u00a0months for resolution of the cognitive symptoms.",

The Hmox1/carbon monoxide (CO) pathway inhibits soluble Flt-1 (sFlt-1) and soluble Endoglin (sEng). More importantly, statins induce Hmox1 and suppress the release of sFlt-1 and sEng; thus, statins and Hmox1 activators are potential novel therapeutic agents for treating preeclampsia. The contribution of the Hmox system to the pathogenesis of preeclampsia has been further indicated by the incidence of preeclampsia being reduced by a third in smokers, who had reduced levels of circulating sFlt-1. Interestingly, preeclamptic women exhale less CO compared with women with healthy pregnancies. Hmox1 is reduced prior to the increase in sFlt-1 as Hmox1 mRNA expression in the trophoblast is decreased in the first trimester in women who go on to develop preeclampsia. Induction of Hmox1 or exposure to CO or bilirubin has been shown to inhibit the release of sFlt-1 and sEng in animal models of preeclampsia. The functional benefit of statins and Hmox1 induction in women with preeclampsia is valid not only because they inhibit sFlt-1 release, but also because statins and Hmox1 are associated with anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-oxidant properties. The StAmP trial is the first randomized control trial (RCT) evaluating the use of pravastatin to ameliorate severe preeclampsia. This proof-of-concept study will pave the way for future global RCT, the success of which will greatly contribute to achieving the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDG4 and MDG5) and offering an affordable and easily accessible therapy for preeclampsia.",

Hepatocytes were obtained from rats, cultured, and exposed to a diluted serum from hyperlipidemic rats. Some cells were also exposed to lipid-lowering drugs. After washing out the rat serum or lipid-lowering drugs, cells were exposed to cyclosporine A embedded in serum lipoproteins. Pretreatment with hyperlipidemic serum and lipid-lowering drugs was associated with an increased uptake of cyclosporine A. As expected, atorvastatin caused an increase in low density lipoprotein receptor and a decrease in MDR1A mRNA in the hepatocytes. A decrease in NRK-52E rat renal tubular cellular viability caused by cyclosporine A was noted when cells were preincubated with diluted hyperlipidemic serum. This was matched with evidence of hyperlipidemic-serum-associated increases in the NRK-52E cellular uptake of cyclosporine A and rhodamine-123. The findings of these experiments suggested that in hyperlipidemia the expression and (or) the functional activity of P-glycoprotein was diminished, leading to greater hepatic and renal uptake of cyclosporine A, and renal cellular toxicity.",

However, low aqueous solubility of crystalline statins and, consequently, reduced biovailability require seeking for alternative forms and formulations to ensure an accurate therapeutic window. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the stability of amorphous simvastatin by probing molecular dynamics using two nondestructive techniques: solid-state NMR and dielectric relaxation spectroscopy. Glassy simvastatin was obtained by the melt quench technique. (13)C cross-polarization/magic-angle-spinning (CP/MAS) NMR spectra and (1)H MAS NMR spectra were obtained from 293 K up to 333 K (Tg \u2248 302 K). The (13)C spin-lattice relaxation times in the rotating frame, T1\u03c1, were measured as a function of temperature, and the correlation time and activation energy data obtained for local motions in different frequency scales revealed strong dynamic heterogeneity, which appears to be essential for the stability of the amorphous form of simvastatin. In addition, the (1)H MAS measurements presented evidence for mobility of the hydrogen atoms in hydroxyl groups which was assigned to noncooperative secondary relaxations. The complex dielectric permittivity of simvastatin was monitored in isochronal mode at five frequencies (from 0.1 to 1000 kHz), by carrying out a heating/cooling cycle allowing to obtain simvastatin in the supercooled and glassy states. The results showed that no dipolar moment was lost due to immobilization, thus confirming that no crystallization had taken place. Complementarily, the present study focused on the thermal stability of simvastatin using thermogravimetric analysis while the thermal events were followed up by differential scanning calorimetry and dielectric relaxation spectroscopy. Overall, the results confirm that the simvastatin in the glass form reveals a potential use in the solid phase formulation on the pharmaceutical industry.", 
    "89": "Oral atorvastatin has prevented or reversed paralysis in the multiple sclerosis (MS) model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), and reduced development of new MS lesions in clinical trials. Besides inhibiting development of encephalitogenic T cells, atorvastatin treatment of EAE has been associated with an induction of anti-inflammatory myelin-reactive T-helper type (Th)-2 cells. To investigate the clinical significance of atorvastatin-mediated Th2 differentiation, we first evaluated atorvastatin treatment in interleukin (IL)-4 green fluorescent protein-enhanced transcript (4-GET) reporter mice. Atorvastatin treatment failed to induce IL-4-producing Th2 cells in vivo; however, when T cells from atorvastatin-treated 4-GET mice were reactivated in vitro, T cells preferentially differentiated into Th2 cells, while antigen-specific T-cell proliferation and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines (interferon gamma, IL-17, tumor necrosis factor and IL-12) were reduced. Oral atorvastatin also prevented or reversed EAE in signal transducer and activator of transcription 6-deficient (STAT6-/-) mice, which cannot generate IL-4-producing Th2 cells. Further, atorvastatin treatment did not induce or expand Foxp3+ regulatory T cells in either wild-type or STAT6-/- mice. In vivo proliferation of T cells, as measured by incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine, was inhibited in atorvastatin-treated wild-type and STAT6-/- mice. These data imply that atorvastatin ameliorates central nervous system autoimmune disease primarily by inhibiting proliferation of proinflammatory encephalitogenic T cells, and not simply through induction of anti-inflammatory Th2 cells. This cytostatic effect may be a relevant mechanism of action when considering use of statins in MS and other inflammatory conditions.",

Molecular diagnosis and family cascade screening is recommended for early identification of individuals at risk, but up to 40% of families have no mutation detected in known genes. This study combined linkage analysis and exome sequencing to identify a novel variant in exon 3 of APOB (Arg50Trp). Mass spectrometry established that low-density lipoprotein (LDL) containing Arg50Trp APOB accumulates in the circulation of affected individuals, suggesting defective hepatic uptake. Previously reported mutations in APOB causing ADH have been located in exon 26. This is the first report of a mutation outside this region causing this phenotype, therefore, more extensive screening of this large and highly polymorphic gene may be necessary in ADH families. This is now feasible due to the high capacity of recently available sequencing platforms.",

    "142": "Recent studies have demonstrated that statins reduce cell viability and induce apoptosis in various types of cancer cells. The molecular mechanisms underlying these effects are poorly understood. The JAK/STAT pathway plays an important role in the regulation of proliferation and apoptosis in many tissues, and its deregulation is believed to be involved in tumorigenesis and cancer. The physiological activation of STAT proteins by GH is rapid but transient in nature and its inactivation is regulated mainly by the expression of SOCS proteins. UMR-106 osteosarcoma cells express a GH-responsive JAK2/STAT5 signaling pathway, providing an experimental model to study the influence of statins on this system. In this study we investigated the actions of simvastatin on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion on UMR-106 cells and examined whether alterations in GH-stimulated JAK/STAT/SOCS signaling may be observed. Results showed that treatment of osteosarcoma cells with simvastatin at 3 to 10 \u00b5M doses decreases cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in a time- and dose-dependent manner. At the molecular level, although the mechanisms used by simvastatin are not entirely clear, the effect of the statin on the reduction of JAK2 and STAT5 phosphorylation levels may partially explain the decrease in the GH-stimulated STAT5 transcriptional activity. This effect correlated with a time- and dose-dependent increase of SOCS-3 expression levels in cells treated with simvastatin, a regulatory role that has not been previously described. Furthermore, the finding that simvastatin is capable of inducing SOCS-3 and CIS genes expression shows the potential of the JAK/STAT pathway as a therapeutic target, reinforcing the efficacy of simvastatin as chemotherapeutic drug for the treatment of osteosarcoma.",

Independent reports have indicated the cidal effects of statins against the flatworm parasite, S. mansoni, and the possibility that SmHMGR is a useful drug target to develop new statin-based anti-schistosome therapies. For six commercially available statins, we demonstrate concentration- and time-dependent killing of immature (somule) and adult S. mansoni in vitro at sub-micromolar and micromolar concentrations, respectively. Cidal activity trends with statin lipophilicity whereby simvastatin and pravastatin are the most and least active, respectively. Worm death is preventable by excess mevalonate, the product of HMGR. Statin activity against somules was quantified both manually and automatically using a new, machine learning-based automated algorithm with congruent results. In addition, to chemical targeting, RNA interference (RNAi) of HMGR also kills somules in vitro and, again, lethality is blocked by excess mevalonate. Further, RNAi of HMGR of somules in vitro subsequently limits parasite survival in a mouse model of infection by up to 80%. Parasite death, either via statins or specific RNAi of HMGR, is associated with activation of apoptotic caspase activity. Together, our genetic and chemical data confirm that S. mansoni HMGR is an essential gene and the relevant target of statin drugs. We discuss our findings in context of a potential drug development program and the desired product profile for a new schistosomiasis drug.",

This is articulated through the interplay of a constellation of genes that ultimately determines the net amount of chylomicron cholesterol delivered to the liver. Major advances in our insights into regulation of the cholesterol absorption pathway have been made using genetically manipulated mouse models and agents such as ezetimibe. One unresolved question is how a sustained pharmacological inhibition of intestinal cholesterol synthesis in vivo may affect cholesterol handling by the absorptive cells. Here we show that the lanosterol cyclase inhibitor, Ro 48-8071, when fed to BALB/c mice in a chow diet (20 mg/day/kg body weight), leads to a rapid and sustained inhibition (>50%) of cholesterol synthesis in the whole small intestine. Sterol synthesis was also reduced in the large intestine and stomach. In contrast, hepatic cholesterol synthesis, while markedly suppressed initially, rebounded to higher than baseline rates within 7 days. Whole body cholesterol synthesis, fractional cholesterol absorption, and fecal neutral and acidic sterol excretion were not consistently changed with Ro 48-8071 treatment. There were no discernible effects of this agent on intestinal histology as determined by H&E staining and the level of Ki67, an index of proliferation.

    "157": "Statin is now recommended in secondary prevention after stroke or transient ischemic attacks to reduce the risk of a new stroke or major cardiovascular events. However, some issues about the extent of the benefit in some stroke patients and the risk of cerebral hemorrhage remain debated. This review shows that statins are significantly effective in decreasing the risk of further strokes despite an increase in the risk of brain hemorrhage. A significant benefit was observed in men and women, in aged patients and possibly to a greater extent in patients with carotid artery stenosis. Intensive statin therapy lowering the LDL-cholesterol beyond the cut-off value of 1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dl) seems to be more effective than less intensive treatment and without an increased risk of side effects. Overall, statins are well tolerated. Further prospective studies should clarify whether the effect is of the same magnitude in small vessel disease and how to select the patients to reduce the risk of cerebral hemorrhage.", 
    "158": "Phytosterols are sterols found naturally in various oils from plants. Phytosterols compete with cholesterol for a place in the mixed micelles, needed for cholesterol absorption by the small intestine. As a result, cholesterol absorption, either from food or from bile salts is lowered by about 50%, leading to a towering of about 10% of blood cholesterol level, despite an increase in hepatic cholesterol synthesis. This reduction is achieved when phytosterols are given both as monotherapy, and in addition to statin therapy. The average Western diet contains about 400-800 mg of phytosterols per day, while the dose needed for lowering the blood cholesterol level is about 2-3 grams per day. Therefore, for the purpose of reducing blood cholesterol, they should be given either as phytosterol-enriched food or as supplements. The reduction in the level of LDL-choLesterol achieved with phytosterols may reduce the risk of coronary disease by about 25%. Hence, the American Heart Association recommended the consumption of phytosterols, as part of a balanced diet, for towering blood cholesterol levels.",

After incubation with 6-OHDA, simvastatin, and/or N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor 1 (NMDAR1) siRNA for 24 hr, test kits were used to detect the levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and glutamate released from PC12 cells exposed to different culture media. The mRNA levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, and IL-6 were determined by RT-PCR, and the protein levels were analyzed by Western blot. NMDAR1 were also determined by RT-PCR and the protein levels were analyzed by Western blot. LDH and glutamate levels in 6-OHDA-incubated PC12 cells increased compared with those in the controls, and incubation with simvastatin inhibited this elevation. Silencing of NMDAR1 with siRNA inhibited the expression of LDH and glutamate to a degree similar to simvastatin. The expression levels of NMDAR1, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 were significantly upregulated after treatment with 6-OHDA. The 6-OHDA-stimulated mRNA and protein levels of the proinflammatory cytokines NMDAR1, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 were reduced by simvastatin. Silencing of NMDAR1 with siRNA decreased the NMDAR1, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 mRNA and protein expression levels in 6-OHDA-stimulated PC12 cells. Simvastatin could also inhibit the expression of NMDAR1 and cytokines to a degree similar to silencing of NMDAR1 with siRNA. Our results suggest that NMDAR1 modulation could explain the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of simvastatin in experimental parkinsonian cell models.",

However, many patients are still unable to reach recommended LDL-C goals on maximally tolerated statin therapy. Monoclonal antibodies that inhibit proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, including evolocumab (previously AMG 145), dramatically lowered LDL-C in phase 2 clinical trials when administered alone or in combination with a statin. The aim of this phase 3 study is to evaluate the efficacy of 12 weeks of subcutaneous evolocumab (vs placebo) administered every 2 weeks or every month in combination with a statin in patients with hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia.

Statins alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering medications are effective in managing FH and preventing cardiovascular events. For patients who do not respond to or are intolerant of pharmacotherapy, low-density lipoprotein apheresis is available as a nonpharmacologic treatment option.

Statins are used as first-line therapies for dyslipidemia because of their effectiveness and safety profile. However, it has recently been reported that statin therapy is associated with new-onset diabetes in the nontransplant population. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between statin therapy and the development of NODAT in LT recipients. Three hundred sixty-four LT recipients who underwent transplantation between the ages of 20 and 75 years without a previous history of diabetes were enrolled in this study. We evaluated the incidence of NODAT with respect to statin use as well as other risk factors. The incidence of NODAT was significantly higher in the statin group (31.7%) versus the control group (17.6%, P\u2009=\u20090.03). The mean follow-up period was 37.8\u2009\u00b1\u200919.0 months for the statin group and 42.7\u2009\u00b1\u200916.0 months for the control group (P\u2009=\u20090.07). Statin use was significantly associated with NODAT development after adjustments for other risk factors [hazard ratio (HR)\u2009=\u20092.32, 95% confidence interval (CI)\u2009=\u20091.23-4.39, P\u2009=\u20090.01].

Patients with high FPG levels were more likely to develop NODAT when they were placed on statins after LT (P\u2009=\u20090.002). In conclusion, statin treatment could contribute to the development of NODAT in LT recipients, especially if they have high baseline FPG levels.", 
    "174": "The statins competitively inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase activity and consequently the synthesis of mevalonate. The use of statins is associated with insulin resistance, presumably due to the impaired differentiation and diminished glucose utilization of adipocytes. We hypothesize that mevalonate is essential to adipocyte differentiation and adipogenic gene expression. Adipo-Red assay and Oil Red O staining showed that an eight-day incubation with 0-2.5\u2009\u00b5mol/L lovastatin dose-dependently reduced the intracellular triglyceride content of murine 3T3-F442A adipocytes. Concomitantly, lovastatin downregulated the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (Ppar\u03b3), leptin (Lep), fatty acid binding protein 4 (Fabp4), and adiponectin (AdipoQ) as measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (real-time qPCR). The expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (Srebp-1), a transcriptional regulator of Ppar\u03b3 and Lep genes, was also suppressed by lovastatin. Western-blot showed that lovastatin reduced the level of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein \u03b1 (C/EBP\u03b1) while inducing a compensatory over-expression of HMG CoA reductase. The impact of lovastatin on intracellular triglyceride content and expression of the adipogenic genes was reversed by supplemental mevalonate.

    "175": "Statins effectively lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Most patients tolerate statins well, but approximately 10% to 20% experience side effects (primarily muscle-related) contributing to diminished compliance or discontinuation of statin therapy and subsequent increase in cardiovascular risk. Statin-intolerant patients require more effective therapies for lowering LDL-C. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a compelling target for LDL-C-lowering therapy. Evolocumab (AMG 145) is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds PCSK9, inhibiting its interaction with the LDL receptor to preserve LDL-receptor recycling and reduce LDL-C. Phase 2 studies have demonstrated the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of subcutaneous evolocumab in diverse populations, including statin-intolerant patients. This article describes the rationale and design of the Goal Achievement After Utilizing an anti-PCSK9 Antibody in Statin-Intolerant Subjects 2 (GAUSS-2) trial, a randomized, double-blind, ezetimibe-controlled, multicenter phase 3 study to evaluate the effects of 12\u2009weeks of evolocumab 140\u2009mg every 2\u2009weeks or 420\u2009mg every month in statin-intolerant patients with hypercholesterolemia. Eligible subjects were unable to tolerate effective doses of \u22652 statins because of myalgia, myopathy, myositis, or rhabdomyolysis that resolved with statin discontinuation. The primary objective of the study is to assess the effects of evolocumab on percentage change from baseline in LDL-C. Secondary objectives include evaluation of safety and tolerability, comparison of the effects of evolocumab vs ezetimibe on absolute change from baseline in LDL-C, and percentage changes from baseline in other lipids.

Coronary angiography revealed a non-flow limiting lesion in her right coronary artery with the rest of her arteries unremarkable. Risk stratification of the culprit lesion in the right coronary artery through intravascular ultrasound virtual histology demonstrated that the rupture plaque had less than 5% necrotic core with low vulnerability indices. This important finding suggested that the re-rupture risk was low so aggressive pharmacological treatment that can influence the plaque characteristics was instigated in preference to mechanical plaque sealing with a coronary stent. At a year of follow-up the patient was well and had no further events.", 
    "177": "The various contemporary therapeutic options for coronary artery disease (CAD) require differentiated, individualized treatment strategies. The foundations of CAD therapy are lifestyle modifications targeted on the individual risk profile of the patients. Pharmacological therapy of CAD should prevent secondary coronary events (e.g. platelet aggregation inhibitors and statins) and reduce angina in symptomatic patients (e.g. short-acting nitrates, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers and if necessary ivabradine and ranolazine). Revascularization therapy has to be performed promptly in patients with acute coronary syndromes; however, in patients with stable CAD the decision to perform revascularization therapy has to consider symptoms, detection of ischemia and if appropriate intracoronary assessment of hemodynamic relevance of an intermediate stenosis (fractional flow reserve). The differential indications of percutaneous coronary intervention compared to coronary artery bypass grafting depend on the severity of coronary artery disease and the morphology (SYNTAX score), comorbidities and the will of the individual patient. The international guidelines emphasize the value of an interdisciplinary treatment decision in a \"heart team\". In summary, differential therapy of CAD has become challenging in the current clinical practice; future developments will probably further improve individualized strategies to treat patients with CAD.",

However, the direct endothelial effect of combined statin/aspirin cotreatment remains unclear. Histamine is an inflammatory mediator that increases vascular permeability, and so we examined the effect of treating human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) for 24 h with 1 \u03bcM simvastatin and 100 \u03bcM aspirin on histamine responsiveness. Subsequent histamine (1 \u03bcM) challenge increased intracellular calcium (Ca(2+)i) concentration, an effect that was significantly inhibited by combined simvastatin/aspirin pretreatment but not when then the compounds were given separately, even at 10-fold higher concentrations. In contrast, the Ca(2+)i mobilization response to ATP challenge (10 \u03bcM) was not inhibited by combined simvastatin/aspirin pretreatment. The H1 receptor antagonist pyrilamine significantly inhibited both histamine-induced Ca(2+)i mobilization and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activation, whereas ranitidine (H2 receptor antagonist) was without effect. However, combined simvastatin/aspirin pretreatment failed to decrease H1 receptor protein expression ruling out receptor downregulation as the mechanism of action. Histamine-induced ERK activation was also inhibited by atorvastatin pretreatment, while simvastatin further inhibited histamine-induced vascular endothelial cadherin phosphorylation as well as altered HUVEC morphology and inhibited actin polymerization. Therefore, in addition to the known therapeutic benefits of statins and aspirin, here we provide initial cellular evidence that combined statin/aspirin treatment inhibits histamine responsiveness in HUVECs.",

Here, highly active chimeric fusion proteins (chimeras) were obtained by reductase domain swapping of mutants at key catalytic residues of the heme domain with that of a natural variant (CYP102A1.2) of P450 BM3 (CYP102A1.1) from Bacillus megaterium. Random mutagenesis at the heme domain of the chimera was also used to generate chimeric mutants that were more active and diverse than the chimeras themselves. To determine whether the chimeras and several mutants of the highly active chimera displayed enhanced catalytic activity and, more importantly, whether they acquired activities of biotechnological importance, we measured the oxidation activities of the chimeras and chimeric mutants toward human P450 substrates, mainly drugs. Some of the chimeric mutants showed high activity toward typical human P450 substrates including drugs. Statin leads, especially chiral products, with inhibitory effects toward HMG-CoA reductase could be obtained from metabolites of statin drugs generated using these chimeric mutants.

However, atorvastatin use as a CNS therapeutic is limited by poor blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration. Therefore, we examined regulation and functional expression of the known statin transporter organic anion transporting polypeptide 1a4 (Oatp1a4) at the BBB under H/R conditions. In rat brain microvessels, H/R (6% O2, 60 minutes followed by 21% O2, 10 minutes) increased Oatp1a4 expression. Brain uptake of taurocholate (i.e., Oap1a4 probe substrate) and atorvastatin were reduced by Oatp inhibitors (i.e., estrone-3-sulfate and fexofenadine), suggesting involvement of Oatp1a4 in brain drug delivery. Pharmacological inhibition of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2)/activin receptor-like kinase 5 (ALK5) signaling with the selective inhibitor SB431542 increased Oatp1a4 functional expression, suggesting a role for TGF-\u03b2/ALK5 signaling in Oatp1a4 regulation. Taken together, our novel data show that targeting an endogenous BBB drug uptake transporter (i.e., Oatp1a4) may be a viable approach for optimizing CNS drug delivery for treatment of diseases with an H/R component.", 
    "198": "To examine the association between statin use and the risk of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) in reports submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) between 2004 and 2011.", 
    "199": "Relevant reports in the FAERS were identified and analyzed. The reporting odds ratio (ROR) was used to detect spontaneous report signals, calculated using the case/non-case method. Cases were identified by the presence of reports of an adverse drug reaction (ADR) in which statins were the suspected drug. Non-cases were all the reports of the same reactions induced by drugs other than statins. The reporting odds ratio (ROR) and 95% confidential interval (CI) was calculated as a measure of disproportionality.", 
    "200": "A total of 44,959,104 drug-reaction pairs was found in 2,681,739 reports. Significant RORs were found for both voiding (ROR; 1.16, 95% CI; 1.10 - 1.23) and storage symptoms (ROR; 1.25, 95% CI; 1.20 - 1.30). Analysis of individual statins showed that rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, and lovastatin had significant disproportionality for voiding symptoms, while simvastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin, atorvastatin, pitavastatin, and lovastatin had significant disproportionality for storage symptoms. Of the four voiding symptoms, significant RORs were found for urine flow decrease and dysuria. Of the four storage symptoms, significant RORs were found for pollakiuria and nocturia. No fundamental differences in disproportionality were observed between genders.", 
    "201": "Analysis of the FAERS database showed small but reliable signals for LUTS in statin users. The mechanism responsible for these reactions is unknown. However, these adverse events should be monitored closely.", 
    "202": "Simvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A reductase inhibitor, is used to reduce cholesterol levels. Accumulating evidence has revealed the immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects of simvastatin that prevent cardiovascular diseases. In addition, the beneficial effects of statins on fibrosis of various organs have been reported. However, the functional effect of statins on dermal fibrosis of keloids has not yet been explored. The objective of this study was to determine whether simvastatin could affect dermal fibrosis associated with keloids. We examined the effect of simvastatin on transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21-induced production of type I collagen, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF or CCN2), and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA). Keloid fibroblasts were cultured and exposed to different concentrations of simvastatin in the presence of TGF-\u03b21, and the effects of simvastatin on TGF-\u03b21-induced collagen and CTGF production in keloid fibroblasts were determined. The type I collagen, CTGF, and \u03b1-SMA expression levels and the Smad2 and Smad3 phosphorylation levels were assessed by Western blotting. The effect of simvastatin on cell viability was evaluated by assessing the colorimetric conversion of 3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide. Simvastatin suppressed TGF-\u03b21-induced type I collagen, CTGF, and \u03b1-SMA production in a concentration-dependent manner. The TGF-\u03b21-induced Smad2 and Smad3 phosphorylation levels were abrogated by simvastatin pretreatment. The inhibition of type I collagen, CTGF, and \u03b1-SMA expression by simvastatin was reversed by geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, suggesting that the simvastatin-induced cellular responses were due to inhibition of small GTPase Rho involvement. A RhoA activation assay showed that preincubation with simvastatin significantly blocked TGF-\u03b21-induced RhoA activation. The Rho-associated coiled kinase inhibitor Y27632 abrogated TGF-\u03b21-induced production of type I collagen, CTGF, and \u03b1-SMA. However, Y27632 had no significant effect on TGF-\u03b21-induced phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3. In conclusion, the present study suggests that simvastatin is an effective inhibitor of TGF-\u03b21-induced type I collagen, CTGF, and \u03b1-SMA production in keloid fibroblasts.", 
    "203": "To generate comparative clinical data in Indian patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in terms of safety and efficacy of atorvastatin 80 mg vis-\u00e0-vis atorvastatin 40 mg", 
    "204": "A total of 236 patients with diagnosed ACS (with TIMI Risk score > or = 3) within preceding 10 days were randomized to receive either atorvastatin 80 mg or atorvastatin 40 mg once daily for 12 weeks. Out of 236 patients, data for 173 was analyzed who had both baseline and post-baseline lipid assessment. The primary end point of the trial was percentage change in LDL-C at the end of treatment from baseline. Other end points were change in high sensitivity C reactive protein, incidence of increase in liver enzymes > or = 3 times upper limit of normal and incidence of myotoxicity (with or without elevation of creatinine phosphokinase) at the end of treatment.", 
    "205": "A dose-dependent response was observed with greater reduction of LDL -C in atorvastatin 80 mg (27.5% vs 19.04%) than that of atorvastatin 40 mg group. Both the treatment groups had a significant reduction (p < 0.001) in LDL-C at the end of 6 and 12 weeks in comparison to baseline. hs-CRP was also significantly reduced (p < 0.001) in both the treatment groups i.e. atorvastatin 80 mg (76.15%) and atorvastatin 40 mg (84.4%) from baseline at the end of 12 weeks. Both doses of atorvastatin were well tolerated. No patient had elevation of (> or = 3 times of upper limit of normal) liver enzymes or creatinine phosphokinase. One patient on atorvastatin 80 mg complained of myalgia. There were no dose-related differences in incidence of adverse events between two treatment groups.", 
    "206": "The CURE-ACS trial indicated that atorvastatin 80 mg was more effective than atorvastatin 40 mg in terms of reduction in LDL cholesterol and was as safe and well tolerated as 40 mg dose in Indian patients with ACS."
