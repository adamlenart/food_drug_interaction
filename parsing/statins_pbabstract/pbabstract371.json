    "0": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase is the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. HMG-CoA reductase converts HMG-CoA to mevalonate, which is then converted into cholesterol or various isoprenoids through multiple enzymatic steps. In this study, we examined the cytotoxic effects of lovastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, in C6 glial cells. Lovastatin at concentrations higher than 10 microM suppressed cell proliferation and induced cell death, which were prevented completely by mevalonate (300 microM). The data from lactate dehydrogenase assay and fluorescence microscopic assay using Hoechst 33342 and propidium iodide showed that mevalonate at a concentration of 100 microM could prevent lovastatin-induced cell death, whereas it could not prevent lovastatin-induced inhibition of cell proliferation. These data suggest that the lovastatin-induced interruption of cell cycle transition was not sufficient to induce cell death in C6 glial cells. In the presence of lovastatin at concentrations higher than 10 microM, DNA laddering, the typical finding of apoptosis, was identified. Lovastatin-induced apoptosis was prevented by mevalonate (100 microM). Both cycloheximide (0.5 microgram/ml) and actinomycin D (0.1 microgram/ml) prevented lovastatin-induced DNA laddering. In this study, we demonstrated that the cytotoxic effects of lovastatin fall into two categories: suppression of cell growth and induction of apoptosis in C6 glial cells.", 
    "1": "The action of LY295427 [(3alpha,4alpha, 5alpha)-4-(2-propenylcholestan-3-ol)], a compound that derepresses low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) expression in a cell-based model, was examined in hamsters. It was found that the compound does not have an effect in normal chow-fed hamsters, in which LDL-R levels are not repressed, but exerts a marked hypocholesterolemic effect (>70% decrease) in cholesterol-coconut oil-fed hamsters, in which LDL-R is repressed. In this model, there is a dose-response for cholesterol lowering with an approximate ED50 value of 40 mg/kg/day and an inverse relationship between serum cholesterol and serum LY295427 levels. LDL-R mRNA is increased (2-fold) and liver cholesterol ester content is decreased (>90%). Unlike the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarylcoenzyme A reductase inhibitor lovastatin, the decreased serum cholesterol is confined to the non-high-density lipoprotein fraction. Furthermore, LY295427 does not affect cholesterol biosynthesis, and it does not have a significant effect on cholesterol absorption. These data suggest that LY295427 acts in the hypercholesterolemic hamster by derepressing LDL-R transcription, thereby enhancing cholesterol clearance from the blood. The results with LY295427 suggest that compounds that act to increase LDL-R may represent a novel approach in the pharmacotherapy for hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "2": "The retinoblastoma protein plays a critical role in regulating the G1/S transition. Less is known about the function and regulation of the homologous pocket protein p107. Here we present evidence for the posttranslational regulation of p107 by the Ca2+-activated protease calpain. Three negative growth regulators, the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin, the antimetabolite 5-fluorouracil, and the cyclic nucleotide dibutyryl cAMP were found to induce cell type-specific loss of p107 protein which was reversible by the calpain inhibitor leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal but not by the serine protease inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, caspase inhibitors, or lactacystin, a specific inhibitor of the 26S proteasome. Purified calpain induced Ca2+-dependent p107 degradation in cell lysates. Transient expression of the specific calpain inhibitor calpastatin blocked the loss of p107 protein in lovastatin-treated cells, and the half-life of p107 was markedly lengthened in lovastatian-treated cells stably transfected with a calpastatin expression vector versus cells transfected with vector alone. The data presented here demonstrate down-regulation of p107 protein in response to various antiproliferative signals, and implicate calpain in p107 posttranslational regulation.", 
    "3": "Ten patients who take hydroxy-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, or statin medications, and experience adverse reactions are described. All patients experienced various manifestations of hypersensitivity while receiving the drugs. One patient is described with hypersensitivity pneumonitis, which was graphically demonstrated by both high resolution computerized axial tomography and open lung biopsy.", 
    "4": "To report a case of chronically elevated creatine kinase (CK) concentration that is possibly associated with renal insufficiency and prostatic carcinoma. The goal is to raise awareness among clinicians who monitor CK concentrations in patients receiving hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors.", 
    "5": "Because of an elevated CK concentration, a 64-year-old African-American man with a history of chronic heart disease and renal insufficiency was assessed for possible myositis relating to his treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. However, an association between the elevated enzyme concentration and drug treatment could not be clearly established. The patient was subsequently diagnosed with prostatic cancer and underwent a radical retropubic prostatectomy. The CK enzyme concentration declined following the surgery despite continuation of the drug therapy.", 
    "6": "CK is relatively nonspecific because of its wide distribution in human tissues. Although several findings of elevated CK concentrations, particularly the CK-BB isoenzyme, in patients with carcinoma or chronic renal insufficiency have been documented, these may not be common knowledge among clinicians. This case report provides an example of an unusually high CK enzyme concentration that may be linked to prostatic carcinoma and renal insufficiency.", 
    "7": "It is important to be aware of different causes for CK enzyme concentration elevation, especially when it is used as a monitoring parameter during HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor treatment. In a case of persistent elevated CK enzyme concentration without evidence of myositis, renal insufficiency may be a contributing factor and malignancy must be ruled out.", 
    "8": "Insulin resistance is associated with hypertriglyceridemia, low serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations and high serum total cholesterol (TC) to HDL-C ratios. Several reports have demonstrated that either lovastatin or gemfibrozil may favorably lower serum lipid concentrations. However, their effects on insulin sensitivity are unknown. The primary aim of this study was to compare the effects of lovastatin and gemfibrozil on insulin sensitivity and serum leptin concentrations in subjects with high TC/HDL-C ratios. We enrolled 25 nondiabetic patients, similar in terms of age and weight with TC/HDL-C ratios greater than 5. Thirteen subjects were treated with lovastatin 20 mg per day, and 12 received gemfibrozil 300 mg twice per day. Plasma lipids, glucose, and leptin were measured, and a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and a modified insulin suppression test were performed before and after 3 months of treatment. The study showed the mean plasma TC, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations, and TC/HDL-C ratio were significantly reduced in the lovastatin-treated group, but no obvious effects on plasma triglyceride (TG) and HDL-C were noted. In the gemfibrozil group, plasma TG and HDL-C were markedly lowered, but no significantly different effects in other plasma lipids were found. Gemfibrozil did not affect steady-state plasma glucose (SSPG) concentrations, whereas lovastatin significantly increased SSPG concentrations. Neither drug affected the serum leptin concentration during the OGTT. We conclude that lovastatin significantly lowers plasma TC and LDL-C ratio, and TC/HDL-C concentrations and adversely affects insulin sensitivity, while gemfibrozil markedly reduces plasma TG concentrations without altering insulin sensitivity in subjects with high TC/HDL-C ratios.", 
    "9": "Intermediary metabolites of cholesterol synthetic pathway are involved in cell proliferation. Lovastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, blocks mevalonate synthesis, and has been shown to inhibit mesangial cell proliferation associated with diverse glomerular diseases. Since inhibition of farnesylation and plasma membrane anchorage of the Ras proteins is one suggested mechanism by which lovastatin prevents cellular proliferation, we investigated the effect of lovastatin and key mevalonate metabolites on the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) and Ras in murine glomerular mesangial cells. The preincubation of mesangial cells with lovastatin inhibited the activation of MAP kinase stimulated by either FBS, PDGF, or EGF. Mevalonic acid and farnesyl-pyrophosphate, but not cholesterol or LDL, significantly prevented lovastatin-induced inhibition of agonist-stimulated MAP kinase. Lovastatin inhibited agonist-induced activation of Ras, and mevalonic acid and farnesylpyrophosphate antagonized this effect. Parallel to the MAP kinase and Ras data, lovastatin suppressed cell growth stimulated by serum, and mevalonic acid and farnesylpyrophosphate prevented lovastatin-mediated inhibition of cellular growth. These results suggest that lovastatin, by inhibiting the synthesis of farnesol, a key isoprenoid metabolite of mevalonate, modulates Ras-mediated cell signaling events associated with mesangial cell proliferation.", 
    "10": "The LIPID study is a placebo-controlled, double-bind, randomized trial, performed in 9014 patients with coronary heart disease and total cholesterol levels of 155 to 271 mg/dl. After a mean follow-up of 6.1 years, patients receiving pravastatin (40 mg/day) had significantly (p < 0.001) lower death rate from coronary heart disease (24%), lower overall mortality (22%) and lower incidence of all cardiovascular outcomes (20 to 29% depending on the event). Interestingly enough, the reduction in death from coronary heart disease or nonfatal myocardial infarction was observed whatever the initial cholesterol concentration, and already significant if total cholesterol was < 213 mg/dl and LDL cholesterol was < 135 mg/dl. Thus, in secondary prevention, the favourable effect of the statin on the coronary heart disease outcomes is observed even in case of initial cholesterol levels yet considered as \"normal\".", 
    "11": "Pravastatin, a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor was found to inhibit DNA synthesis of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) in a dose-dependent manner. Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that pravastatin induced G1 arrest. Mevalonate restored the inhibitory effect of pravastatin on DNA synthesis and on cell cycle progression, suggesting the importance of mevalonate itself and/or its metabolites in VSMC proliferation. The major intermediate metabolites of mevalonate, geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate (GGPP), farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and IPP (isopentenyl pyrophosphate) were prepared in the form of liposomes, and the effects of GGPP, FPP and IPP on pravastatin induced inhibition of VSMC proliferation and G1 arrest were examined. Only GGPP restored the pravastatin-induced inhibition of DNA synthesis and G1 arrest. Pravastatin inhibited translocation of Rho small GTPase from cytosol to membrane. By the addition of GGPP, Rho small GTPase are geranylgeranylated and translocated to membranes during G1/S transition. These data suggest that GGPP, rather than FPP or IPP, is an essential metabolite among mevalonic acid metabolites for VSMC proliferation and the G1/S transition.", 
    "12": "NK-104 is an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase with a very potent lipid-lowering effect. Biotransformation profiles of NK-104 in bile from rat, rabbit and dog given an intravenous infusion of NK-104 were investigated. Structural assignment was made by liquid chromatography (LC)-mass spectrometry (MS)-MS and proton NMR analyses. The predominant component was intact NK-104 in all the animals. At least eight other metabolites were present in rat, four in rabbit, and 10 in dog. These bile metabolites were purified and isolated by preparative HPLC. Biotransformation pathways elucidated for NK-104 were as follows: (a) lactonization ; (b) beta-oxidation of the side-chain; (c) hydroxylation of the quinoline ring; (d) conjugation with Beta-glucuronic acid and taurine. Beta-oxidative degradation of the side-chain in the case of other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors is necessary for epimerization of the hydroxy group which has an R-configuration. However, M-16, glucuronide of the ketolactone derivative, was obtained as a key metabolite suggesting another beta-oxidation pathway for the side-chain.", 
    "13": "Fluvastatin (Fluva), a synthetic inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, induces CYP2B1/2 in rat liver and primary cultured rat hepatocytes. However, the overall profile of CYP induction, which includes induction of CYP4A, suggests that Fluva is not a typical \"phenobarbital (PB)-like\" inducer. Several treatments affecting diverse cell signaling pathways have been reported to modify PB-inducible CYP2B expression in primary cultured rat hepatocytes. We examined the effects of selected treatments on the ability of Fluva to induce CYP2B1/2 mRNA. Only dexamethasone (Dex) produced effects on Fluva-inducible CYP2B1/2 mRNA expression that differed from those produced on PB-inducible CYP2B1/2 mRNA expression. Dex concentrations up to 10(-7) M of potentiated PB (10(-4) M)-mediated CYP2B1/2 mRNA induction, while higher Dex concentrations produced a progressive reduction in PB-induced CYP2B1/2 mRNA levels. By contrast, Dex concentrations up to 10(-8) M had no effect on Fluva (3 x 10(-5) M)-induced CYP2B1/2 mRNA levels, while Dex concentrations of 10(-7) M and higher markedly suppressed Fluva-mediated CYP2B1/2 mRNA induction. The concentrations of several glucocorticoids that produced suppression of Fluva-induced CYP2B1/2 mRNA levels were the same concentrations that induced CYP3A mRNA. Treatment with pregnenolone 16 alpha-carbonitrile also produced a concentration-dependent suppression of Fluva-induced CYP2B1/2 mRNA levels. Dex-mediated suppression of Fluva-induced CYP2B1/2 mRNA was concentration-dependently reversed when hepatocytes were cotreated with troleandomycin, a selective CYP3A inhibitor. The amounts of Fluva detected in culture medium and cells were reduced significantly when hepatocytes were incubated with Dex. However, Dex-mediated suppression of Fluva-induced CYP2B1/2 mRNA expression was not overcome when hepatocytes were incubated with Fluva concentrations greater than 3 x 10(-5) M, suggesting that mechanisms other than CYP3A-catalyzed metabolism may contribute to Dex-mediated suppression of Fluva-induced CYP2B1/2 expression.", 
    "14": "Stimulated bile acid synthesis preferentially utilises newly synthesised cholesterol, raising the possibility that combination of simvastatin (an inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis) with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA; a stimulator of bile acid synthesis) may result in reduced bile acid synthesis and greater enrichment of the pool with UDCA than that achieved with UDCA treatment alone.", 
    "15": "To investigate the effect of simvastatin and UDCA given alone and in combination on serum and biliary lipid and biliary bile acid composition.", 
    "16": "Eighteen patients with primary non-familial hypercholesterolaemia were studied during treatment with simvastatin 20 mg/day, UDCA 10 mg/kg/day, and a combination of the two drugs. Each regimen was given in random order for three months following a three month lead in period.", 
    "17": "Simvastatin significantly reduced serum low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol but biliary cholesterol concentration remained unchanged. Combination of the two drugs had no synergistic effect on serum cholesterol concentration, but significantly increased the proportion of UDCA in the bile acid pool from 35% during UDCA to 48% during combination treatment (p<0.04).", 
    "18": "Results showed that: (1) simvastatin reduces serum LDL cholesterol but has no effect on biliary cholesterol concentration, supporting the concept that newly synthesised cholesterol is not the preferential source for biliary cholesterol; and (2) combination of simvastatin with UDCA has the predicted effect of enhancing the proportion of UDCA in the pool. This effect may be of benefit in the treatment of cholestatic liver diseases.", 
    "19": "The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors competitively inhibit biosynthesis of mevalonate, a precursor of non-sterol compounds involved in cell proliferation. Experimental evidence suggests that fluvastatin may, independent of any lipid lowering action, exert a greater direct inhibitory effect on proliferating vascular myocytes than other statins. The FLARE (Fluvastatin Angioplasty Restenosis) Trial was conceived to evaluate the ability of fluvastatin 40 mg twice daily to reduce restenosis after successful coronary balloon angioplasty (PTCA).", 
    "20": "Patients were randomized to either placebo or fluvastatin 40 mg twice daily beginning 2-4 weeks prior to planned PTCA and continuing after a successful PTCA (without the use of a stent), to follow-up angiography at 26+/-2 weeks. Clinical follow-up was completed at 40 weeks. The primary end-point was angiographic restenosis, measured by quantitative coronary angiography at a core laboratory, as the loss in minimal luminal diameter during follow-up. Clinical end-points were death, myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass graft surgery or re-intervention, up to 40 weeks after PTCA.", 
    "21": "Of 1054 patients randomized, 526 were allocated to fluvastatin and 528 to placebo. Among these, 409 in the fluvastatin group and 427 in the placebo group were included in the intention-to-treat analysis, having undergone a successful PTCA after a minimum of 2 weeks of pre-treatment. At the time of PTCA, fluvastatin had reduced LDL cholesterol by 37% and this was maintained at 33% at 26 weeks. There was no difference in the primary end-point between the treatment groups (fluvastatin 0.23+/-0.49 mm vs placebo 0.23+/-0.52 mm, P=0.95) or in the angiographic restenosis rate (fluvastatin 28%, placebo 31%, chi-square P=0.42), or in the incidence of the composite clinical end-point at 40 weeks (22.4% vs 23.3%; logrank P=0.74). However, a significantly lower incidence of total death and myocardial infarction was observed in six patients (1.4%) in the fluvastatin group and 17 (4.0%) in the placebo group (log rank P=0.025).", 
    "22": "Treatment with fluvastatin 80 mg daily did not affect the process of restenosis and is therefore not indicated for this purpose. However, the observed reduction in mortality and myocardial infarction 40 weeks after PTCA in the fluvastatin treated group has not been previously reported with statin therapy. Accordingly, a priori investigation of this finding is indicated and a new clinical trial with this intention is already underway.", 
    "23": "Our understanding of the factors that regulate the secretion of apoB100 lipoproteins remains incomplete with considerable debate as to the role, if any, for cholesterol ester in this process. This study examines this issue in primary cultures of hamster hepatocytes, a species in which both cholesterol and apoB100 metabolism are very similar to man. Addition of oleate to medium increased the mass of triglyceride and cholesterol ester within the hepatocyte and also increased the secretion of triglycerides, cholesterol ester, and apoB100 into the medium. Next, the responses of hamster hepatocytes to addition of either an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (lovastatin) or an acyl-CoA cholesterol acyltransferase inhibitor (58-035) to the medium, with or without added oleate, were determined. Effects of either agent were only evident in the oleate-supplemented medium in which cholesterol ester mass had been increased above basal. If oleate was not added to the medium, neither agent reduced apoB100 secretion; equally important, over the 24-hour incubation, neither agent, at the concentration used, produced any detectable change in intracellular cholesterol ester mass. However, in contrast to the estimates of mass, which were unchanged, under the same conditions radioisotopic estimates of cholesterol ester synthesis were markedly reduced. Any conclusion as to the relation of cholesterol ester mass to apoB100 secretion would therefore depend on which of the 2 methods was used. Overall, the data indicate a close correlation between the mass of cholesterol ester within the hepatocyte and apoB100 secretion from it and they go far to explain previous apparently contradictory data as to this relation. More importantly, though, taken with other available data, they indicate that the primary response of the liver to increased delivery of lipid is increased secretion rather than decreased uptake. These results point, therefore, to a hierarchy of hepatic responses to increased flux of fatty acids and increased synthesis of cholesterol that in turn suggests a more dynamic model of cholesterol homeostasis in the liver than has been appreciated in the past.", 
    "24": "gamma-Tocotrienol (gamma-T3), a naturally occurring analog of tocopherol (vitamin E), has been shown to have a hypocholesterolemic effect in animals and humans. Unlike tocopherol, it has also been shown to reduce plasma apoB levels in hypercholesterolemic subjects. The aim of this study was to define the mechanism of action of gamma-T3 on hepatic modulation of apoB production using cultured HepG2 cells as the model system. HepG2 cells preincubated with gamma-T3 were initially shown to inhibit the rate of incorporation of [14C]acetate into cholesterol in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, with a maximum 86+/-3% inhibition at 50 micromol/L observed within 6 hours. gamma-T3, on the other hand, had no significant effect on the uptake of [14C]glycerol into pools of cellular triacylglycerol and phospholipid relative to untreated control. The rate of apoB synthesis and secretion was then studied by an [35S]methionine pulse-labeling experiment and quantified by immunoprecipitating apoB on chasing up to 3 hours. An average reduction of 24+/-3% in labeled apoB in the media was apparent with gamma-T3 despite a 60+/-2% increase in apoB synthesis. Fractionation of secreted apoB revealed a relatively denser lipoprotein particle, suggesting a less stable particle. Using a digitonin-permeabilized HepG2 cell system, the effects of gamma-T3 on apoB translocation and degradation in the endoplasmic reticulum were further investigated. The generation of a specific N-terminal 70-kDa proteolytic fragment proved to be a sensitive measure of the rate of apoB translocation and degradation. The abundance of this fragment increased significantly in gamma-T3-treated cells relative to untreated control cells (50+/-21%) after 2 hours of chase. In addition, the presence of gamma-T3 resulted in an average decrease of 64+/-8% in intact apoB. Taken together, the data suggest that gamma-T3 stimulates apoB degradation possibly as the result of decreased apoB translocation into the endoplasmic reticulum lumen. It is speculated that the lack of cholesterol availability reduces the number of secreted apoB-containing lipoprotein particles by limiting translocation of apoB into the endoplasmic reticulum lumen.", 
    "25": "The primary objectives of the pilot study were to: (1) evaluate the feasibility of recruiting patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD); (2) measure the efficacy and safety of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-raising treatment, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-lowering therapy, antioxidant therapy, antithrombotic therapy, and their combinations; and (3) assess adherence to a complex multiple drug regimen. Secondary objectives included measurement of the effect of the interventions on prespecified biochemical markers, maintenance of therapy masking (in particular with niacin), and measurement of the intervention's impact on functional status and on quality of life. To date, no secondary prevention trial has been conducted specifically among patients with PAD. Intermittent claudication affects about 0.5% to 1.0% of persons aged >35 years. There is a striking increase in incidence of PAD with age, particularly among those aged >50 years in both sexes, although men are twice as likely as women to develop PAD. The Arterial Disease Multiple Intervention Trial was a double-blind randomized pilot trial of 468 participants with documented PAD. A 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design was used to evaluate the effect of 3 interventions. The pilot incorporated several major novel design features: first, the use of a simple noninvasive method (measurement of ankle brachial index) to identify a population with either symptomatic or asymptomatic PAD; and second, a lipid modifying strategy to increase HDL with nicotinic acid in the intervention group while lowering LDL levels equally with an hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor as needed in the intervention and control group. Two other arms, the antioxidant arm (consisting of beta-carotene and vitamins E and C) and the antithrombotic arm (using warfarin) were also added. Adherence to therapy was measured by pill count, and success in treatment was measured by the proportion of values in target range for HDL, LDL, and the international normalized ratio.", 
    "26": "Because of the importance of treating dyslipidaemia in the prevention of ischaemic heart disease and because patient selection criteria and outcomes in clinical trials do not necessarily reflect what happens in normal clinical practice, we compared outcomes from bezafibrate, gemfibrozil and simvastatin therapy under conditions of normal use.", 
    "27": "A random sample of 200 patients was selected from the New Zealand Intensive Medicines Monitoring Programme's (IMMP) patient cohorts for each drug. Questionnaires sent to prescribers requested information on indications, risk factors for ischaemic heart disease, lipid profiles with changes during treatment and reasons for stopping therapy.", 
    "28": "80% of prescribers replied and 83% of these contained useful information. The three groups were similar for age, sex and geographical region, but significantly more patients on bezafibrate had diabetes and/or hypertension than those on gemfibrozil or simvastatin. After treatment and taking the initial measure into account, the changes in serum lipid values were consistent with those generally observed, but with gemfibrozil being significantly less effective than expected. More patients (15.8%S) stopped gemfibrozil because of an inadequate response compared with bezafibrate (5.4%) and simvastatin (1.6%). Gemfibrozil treatment was also withdrawn significantly more frequently due to a possible adverse reaction compared with the other two drugs.", 
    "29": "In normal clinical practice in New Zealand gemfibrozil appears less effective and more frequently causes adverse effects leading to withdrawal of treatment than either bezafibrate or simvastatin.", 
    "30": "To investigate the possibility that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMGCoA) reductase inhibitors ameliorate renal disease via direct effects on the tubulointerstitium, primary cultures of human proximal tubule cells (PTC) and renal cortical fibroblasts (CF) were exposed for 24 h to simvastatin (0.1-10 micromol/l) under basal conditions and in the presence of 1,000 ng/ml of cyclosporin (CsA), which we have previously shown to promote in vitro interstitial matrix accumulation at least partially via activation of local cytokine networks. Simvastatin, in micromolar concentrations, engendered cholesterol-independent inhibition of CF and PTC thymidine incorporation and cholesterol-dependent suppression of PTC apical Na+/H+ exchange (NHE) (ethylisopropylamiloride-sensitive apical 22Na+ uptake). Similarly, CF secretion of insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and IGF binding protein-3 were depressed, whereas CF collagen synthesis ([3H]proline incorporation) and PTC secretion of the fibrogenic cytokines, transforming growth factor-beta1, and platelet-derived growth factor were unaffected. A lower concentration (0.1 micromol/l) of simvastatin did not affect any of the above parameters under basal conditions but completely prevented CsA-stimulated CF collagen synthesis (control, 6.6 +/- 0.6; CsA, 8.3 +/- 0.6; CsA+simvastatin, 6.2 +/- 0.5%; P < 0.05) and IGF-I secretion (89.5 +/- 16.6, 204.7 +/- 57.0, and 94.6 +/- 22.3 ng. mg protein-1. day-1, respectively; P < 0.05). The results suggest that simvastatin exerts direct cholesterol-dependent and -independent effects on the human kidney tubulointerstitium. HMGCoA reductase inhibitors may ameliorate interstitial fibrosis complicating CsA therapy via direct actions on human renal cortical fibroblasts.", 
    "31": "Previous studies suggested that certain lipid-lowering drugs such as statins suppress ubiquinone, affect mitochondrial function, and may have deleterious effect on skeletal or cardiac muscles with potentially serious clinical consequences, especially in patients with established coronary heart disease and left ventricular dysfunction. In this double-blind study, we assessed the effects of 20 mg simvastatin (S, n = 32) or 200 mg micronized fenofibrate (F, n = 32, control group) on rest and exercise left ventricular function in hypercholesterolemic survivors of a previous Q-wave acute myocardial infarction. Left ventricular radionuclide imaging was performed at rest and during submaximal exercise and global and segmental (nine segment regional wall-motion score) ejection fractions were measured before treatment and 12 weeks later. Serum ubiquinone was reduced after treatment (p = 0.03) in the S but not the F group, whereas total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol were significantly reduced in both groups. Before treatment, mean global ejection fraction was 52.1+/-12.2% and 49.3+/-11.8% at rest in F and S patients, respectively, and increased (56.0+/-13.7% in F and 52.1+/-12.9% in S) at peak exercise (no difference between groups). After treatment, the increase in ejection fraction tended to be lower in S (0) than in F (+3.8%) but not significantly. However, ejection fraction at rest increased after treatment in S (p = 0.009) but not in F. Subgroup analyses indicated that the improvement in rest ejection fraction in S was essentially observed in patients with ejection fraction <40% (n = 8, +6%), whereas it was stable in patients with ejection fraction >40% (+1.8%). Finally, the numbers of akinetic or hypokinetic segments at rest and during exercise were not different in the two groups before and after treatment. Mean maximal exercise load (113+/-23 watts in F vs. 104+/-27 W in S before treatment) was not modified by the treatment (111+/-21 and 104+/-27 W). Thus a 12-week lipid-lowering treatment with either S or F did not negatively alter left ventricular function during exercise in dyslipidemic patients with established coronary heart disease and did not affect their ability to exercise. The improvement in left ventricular function at rest after simvastatin in patients with left ventricular dysfunction warrants confirmation in further studies with large sample size.", 
    "32": "To reveal the metabolic parameters of lipoproteins (L), which determine the benefits of hypolipidemic effects of simvastatin (S) and fluvastatin (F); to trace changes in the activity of lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCA) and cholesterol (C) ester transfer (CET) from high density lipoproteins to very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and low density lipoproteins (LDL) and the levels of apoE in the blood and in some L classes during therapy with the above drugs.", 
    "33": "Thirty six patients took S, 10 mg/day, and 25 received F, 20 mg/day, for 3 months. The levels of lipids were measured by enzyme assays, apoprotein (apo) was determined by immunoturbidimetry and immunodiffusion.", 
    "34": "The hypocholesterolemic and hypotriglyceridemic effect of S (19.6 and 25.5, respectively) and F (19.0 and 30.5%) were similar. With S, the reduction in the blood levels of C and LDL C positively correlated with the baseline apoE levels. With F, it did with C and LDL C before treatment. Lower blood apoE was found with S and F and lower HDL apoE/(VLDL + LDL) ratio was detected only with F. F treatment significantly lowered the activity of CET and LCA; before and after S treatment, they did not differ significantly.", 
    "35": "Analyzing the relationship between the benefits of the hypolipidemic effect and the baseline parameters of L metabolism indicates that the changes in serum C, LDL C and HDL C are due to the composition of HDL particles and the distribution of apoE among different L classes in the patient to a greater degree.", 
    "36": "Fluvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, was metabolized by human liver microsomes to 5-hydroxy-, 6-hydroxy-, and N-deisopropyl-fluvastatin. Total metabolite formation was biphasic with apparent Km values of 0.2 to 0.7 and 7.9 to 50 microM and intrinsic metabolic clearance rates of 1.4 to 4 and 0.3 to 1.5 ml/h/mg microsomal protein for the high and low Km components, respectively. Several enzymes, but mainly CYP2C9, catalyzed fluvastatin metabolism. Only CYP2C9 inhibitors such as sulfaphenazole inhibited the formation of both 6-hydroxy- and N-deisopropyl-fluvastatin. 5-Hydroxy-fluvastatin formation was reduced by compounds that are inhibitors of CYP2C9, CYP3A, or CYP2C8. Fluvastatin in turn inhibited CYP2C9-catalyzed tolbutamide and diclofenac hydroxylation with Ki values of 0.3 and 0.5 microM, respectively. For CYP2C8-catalyzed 6alpha-hydroxy-paclitaxel formation the IC50 was 20 microM and for CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP3A catalyzed reactions, no IC50 could be determined up to 100 microM fluvastatin. All three fluvastatin metabolites were also formed by recombinant CYP2C9, whereas CYP1A1, CYP2C8, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4 produced only 5-hydroxy-fluvastatin. Km values were approximately 1, 2.8, and 7.1 microM for CYP2C9, CYP2C8, and CYP3A, respectively. No difference in fluvastatin metabolism was found between the CYP2C9R144 and CYP2C9C144 alleles, suggesting the absence of polymorphic fluvastatin metabolism by these alleles. CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, CYP2E1, and CYP3A5 did not produce detectable amounts of any metabolite. This data indicates that several human cytochrome P-450 enzymes metabolize fluvastatin with CYP2C9 contributing 50-80%. Any coadministered drug would therefore only partially reduce the metabolic clearance of fluvastatin; therefore, the likelihood for serious metabolic drug interactions is expected to be minimal.", 
    "37": "The benefit of cholesterol-lowering therapy in the prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) is well established. The secondary prevention Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S) and the primary prevention West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS) demonstrated that lipid lowering with a statin can dramatically and cost-effectively reduce CHD morbidity and mortality with no increase in noncardiovascular mortality. The Cholesterol and Recurrent Events (CARE) trial extended benefit to CHD patients without high cholesterol. Post hoc analyses of data from these large trials are contributing to speculation, driven by subset analyses and meta-analyses, about whether cholesterol intervention should be target based, as current guidelines recommend. Whereas CARE data support the importance of baseline LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), with greatest clinical event risk reduction in the upper part of the LDL-C range in the trial, 4S found no difference in outcome according to baseline LDL-C in a quartile analysis, and WOSCOPS found no linear relation between decrease in LDL-C and decrease in relative risk for CHD. Furthermore, WOSCOPS showed no additional clinical benefit with LDL-C lowering beyond approximately 24%. Questions raised by such analyses require answers from prospective, hypothesis-based data, and at present there is no compelling argument for moving away from LDL-C targets. The hypothesis-based findings of 4S, CARE, and WOSCOPS support current clinical guidelines, and lowering LDL-C may reduce risk more substantially than might have been predicted.", 
    "38": "The HMG CoA reductase inhibitors have quickly become the most widely prescribed family of agents for the treatment of patients with elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. The incidence of side effects with these agents increases as the dose increases within the recommended dosage range. A lower dosage presumably would have a lower incidence of adverse effects. In addition, lower doses should translate into reduced drug costs.", 
    "39": "We compared the efficacy of 10 mg of pravastatin and 10 mg of lovastatin in a randomized, crossover design trial among 30 patients with hypercholesterolemia. At baseline, their total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels were 249.0 +/- 27.3 and 185.1 +/- 25.5 mg/dL. After 4 weeks of treatment with lovastatin, the total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels fell to 202.8 +/- 29.6 and 141.0 +/- 25.3 mg/dL, decreases of 19% and 24%, respectively. Four weeks of pravastatin treatment resulted in levels of 212.6 +/- 30.8 and 150.5 +/- 25.5 mg/dL, or 15% and 19%, respectively.", 
    "40": "There were highly significant changes in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels with each agent and no differences in effect between the 2 agents. In 13 (43%) of the 30 patients, LDL levels were reduced to </=130 mg/dL with one of the agents. Both agents were generally well tolerated, with no clinically important change in liver function tests or creatinine kinase levels.", 
    "41": "We investigated the protective effect of fluvastatin sodium on the oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) induced in vitro by copper ions. The extent of lipid peroxidation was assessed by monitoring the increase of UV absorbance at 234 nm, which is the peak absorbance of a conjugated diene. Fluvastatin sodium (1-30 microM) not only prolonged the lag time of oxidation in the initiation step, but also decreased the rate of oxidation in the propagation step, both concentration dependently. Fluvastatin sodium and alpha-tocopherol showed an additive effect when both compounds were added before oxidation. However, when the lag time was prolonged initially by alpha-tocopherol, and fluvastatin sodium and alpha-tocopherol, were further added into the reaction mixture at the end point of the lag phase, fluvastatin sodium still showed an antioxidative effect, whereas alpha-tocopherol showed a pro-oxidative effect. Therefore, the antioxidative property of fluvastatin sodium differs from that of alpha-tocopherol. In this experiment, as neither the double bond-reduced derivative of fluvastatin sodium nor pravastatin sodium showed any protective effect, we concluded that the antioxidative effect of fluvastatin sodium is not a common property of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, but may be derived from its unique chemical structure. Since the oxidative modification of LDL plays an important role in the genesis of atherosclerosis, fluvastatin sodium may help reduce the risk of atherosclerosis, not only by reducing plasma LDL levels but also by protecting LDL from oxidative modification.", 
    "42": "In the rat thyroid cell lines PC Cl3, FRTL- 5 and WRT, proliferation is mainly regulated by insulin or IGF, and TSH. However, the mechanism regulating cell mass doubling prior to division is still unknown. Our laboratory has shown that in dog thyroid cells insulin promotes growth in size while TSH in the presence of insulin triggers DNA replication. In the absence of insulin, TSH has no effect on cell growth. In this report we investigated insulin action on both cell mass and DNA synthesis and its modulation by TSH and insulin in PC Cl3 and FRTL-5 cells. In PC Cl3 cells, insulin activated not only DNA synthesis but also protein synthesis and accumulation. Although TSH potentiated the stimulation of DNA synthesis induced by insulin, enhancement of protein synthesis by both agents was additive. All TSH effects were reproduced by forskolin. Similar effects were also obtained in FRTL-5 cells. This suggests that insulin and TSH, via cAMP, modulate both growth in size and DNA replication in these cell lines. Lovastatin, which blocks 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, decreased the induction of DNA synthesis, but not of protein synthesis induced by insulin or TSH in PC Cl3 cells. In FRTL-5 cells, lovastatin reduced protein and DNA synthesis stimulated by insulin but not TSH-induced protein synthesis. Taking these data together, we propose that insulin and/or TSH both modulate cell mass doubling and DNA synthesis in these cell lines, presumably via different pathways, and that there are at least two pathways which regulate growth in size in FRTL-5 thyroid cells: one triggered by insulin, which is lovastatin sensitive, and the other activated by TSH, which is not sensitive to lovastatin.", 
    "43": "Our previous studies have shown that the HMG-CoA reductase (HCR) inhibitor (HCRI), simvastatin, causes myopathy in rabbits and kills L6 myoblasts. The present study was designed to elucidate the molecular mechanism of HCRI-induced cell death. We have demonstrated that simvastatin induces the tyrosine phosphorylation of several cellular proteins within 10 min. These phosphorylations were followed by apoptosis, as evidenced by the occurrence of internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and by morphological changes detected with Nomarski optics. Simvastatin-induced cell death was prevented by tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The MTT assay revealed that the addition of mevalonic acid into the culture medium partially inhibited simvastatin-induced cell death. Thus, these results suggested that protein tyrosine phosphorylation might play an important role in the intracellular signal transduction pathway mediating the HCRI-induced death of myoblasts.", 
    "44": "Adverse reactions in two patients who received HMG CoA reductase inhibitor therapy were reinvestigated because of their rarity. A case of permanent forearm myalgia was thought to be caused by atorvastatin. Closer evaluation and work-up revealed underlying lateral epicondylitis, and atorvastatin was not considered the cause of the disability. In another patient, rhabdomyolysis was suspected to be secondary to simvastatin. However, after an extensive review, the reaction was believed to be compartment syndrome of the anterior tibial area. An adverse drug reaction report requires careful and judicious assessment to assign the correct probability for the event.", 
    "45": "We examined whether improving insulin resistance augments the antiatherosclerotic effect of LDL reduction. Since WHHL rabbits show hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance, we administered troglitazone (100 mg/kg), an insulin action enhancer, pravastatin sodium (50 mg/kg), an HMG CoA reductase inhibitor, and a combination of both drugs to 2-month-old WHHL rabbits for 32 weeks. As compared to the control, total cholesterol levels in the plasma and LDL were decreased significantly by 20% in the pravastatin and combination groups. Basal immunoreactive insulin levels and insulin index were decreased significantly by approximately 50% in the troglitazone and combination groups. Surface lesion area of atherosclerosis on the thoracic aorta was decreased significantly by 36% in the combination group and was less in the troglitazone group. Coronary atherosclerosis was decreased significantly by 39% in the combination group and was less in the pravastatin and troglitazone groups. The collagen content in the plaques was decreased in the troglitezone and combination groups and the extracellular lipid deposits were decreased in the pravastatin and combination groups. The incidence and severity of xanthomata in the digital joints were also decreased significantly in the three treated groups. In conclusion, the antiatherogenic effect of the combination treatment is stronger than that of the monotherapy.",

    "47": "A randomized, double-blind, cross-over study design with two phases, which were separated by a washout period of 4 weeks, was used. In each phase ten healthy volunteers took 200 mg itraconazole or matched placebo orally once daily for 4 days according to a randomization schedule. On day 4, 0.3 mg cerivastatin was administered orally. Serum concentrations of cerivastatin, its major metabolites, active and total HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, itraconazole and hydroxyitraconazole were measured up to 24 h.",

The elimination half-life (t1/2) of cerivastatin lactone was increased 3.2-fold (P < 0.001). Itraconazole decreased the AUC(0-24h) of the active M-1 metabolite of cerivastatin by 28% (P < 0.05), whereas the AUC(0- 24h) of the more active metabolite, M-23, was increased by 36% (P < 0.05).

    "50": "Within the past 3 years seven cases of reversible peripheral neuropathy apparently caused by statins have been reported. Here we report seven additional cases associated with long-term statin therapy, in which other causes of neuropathy were thoroughly excluded. The neuropathy was in all cases axonal and with affection of both thick and thin nerve fibers. The symptoms of neuropathy persisted during an observation period lasting from 10 weeks to 1 year in four cases after statin treatment had been withdrawn. We suggest that long-term statin treatment may be associated with chronic peripheral neuropathy.", 
    "51": "Hypercholesterolemia and hypertension are frequently associated with elevated sympathetic activity. Both are independent cardiovascular risk factors and both affect endothelium-mediated vasodilation. To identify the effects of cholesterol-lowering and antihypertensive treatments on vascular reactivity and vasodilative capacity, we studied 30 hypercholesterolemic hypertensive subjects. They received placebo for 4 weeks, either enalapril or simvastatin for 14 weeks, and, finally, both medications for an additional 14 weeks. Postischemic forearm blood flow (MFBF) and minimal vascular resistance (mFVR) were used as indices of vasodilative capacity and structural vascular damage, respectively. Total (resting-stress-recovery phases) cardiovascular (blood pressure [BP] and heart rate [HR]) and regional hemodynamic (FBF and FVR) reactivity to stressful stimuli were calculated as area-under-the-curve (auc) (valuextime). Compared with baseline levels, simvastatin reduced total (TOT-C) and LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) (1.27 mmol/L, P<0.001 and 1.33 mmol/L, P<0.001, respectively). Enalapril also reduced TOT-C and LDL-C (0.6 mmol/L, P<0.001 and 0.58 mmol/L, P<0.05, respectively). MFBF was increased substantially by both treatments (P<0.001). Enalapril had a greater effect (-1.7 arbitrary units (AU), P<0.001) than simvastatin (-0.6 AU, P<0.05) on mFVR. During stress, FBF increased more with enalapril (4.4 FBFxminutes, P<0.001) than with simvastatin (1.8 FBFxminutes, P<0.01). Conversely, FVR stress response was reduced more with enalapril (9.1 FVRxminutes, P<0.001) than with simvastatin (2.9 FVRxminutes, P<0.01). During combination treatment, a significant (0.001>P<0.05) additive effect on hypercholesterolemia, structural vascular damage, BP, and FVR was shown. The findings suggest that angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition induces a larger reduction than HMG-CoA reductase blockade in vascular reactivity and structural damage in hypercholesterolemic hypertensive subjects.", 
    "52": "The effects of combination therapy with chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and simvastatin on serum cholestanol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and lathosterol levels were investigated in seven adult patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) who were on long-term treatment with CDCA. The patients were treated with a combination of CDCA 750 mg daily and an increasing dose of simvastatin from 10 mg to 40 mg daily for a period of 6 months. We found a significant effect of this combination therapy compared with CDCA alone in terms of decreasing the serum cholestanol and LDL cholesterol levels, particularly with a daily dose of 40 mg simvastatin. The mean cholestanol level decreased from 9.27 micromol/L (baseline) to 6.69 micromol/L (40 mg simvastatin), while the mean LDL cholesterol level decreased from 5.08 mmol/L (baseline) to 3.04 mmol/L (40 mg simvastatin). No side effects were reported, and there were no effects on the clinical condition, cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), visual evoked potentials, and electroencephalographic features. We conclude that a combination of 750 mg CDCA and 40 mg simvastatin daily is effective to further reduce serum cholestanol, LDL cholesterol, and lathosterol in adult CTX patients treated with long-term CDCA. Whether this combination treatment will be effective for the long-term prevention of neurological deterioration and atherosclerosis remains to be established.", 
    "53": "BACKGROUND--Patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) commonly have low HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) and mildly elevated LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), leading to uncertainty as to whether the appropriate goal of therapy should be lowering LDL-C or raising HDL-C. METHODS AND RESULTS--Patients in the Lipoprotein and Coronary Atherosclerosis Study (LCAS) had mildly to moderately elevated LDL-C; many also had low HDL-C, providing an opportunity to compare angiographic progression and the benefits of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor fluvastatin in patients with low versus patients with higher HDL-C. Of the 339 patients with biochemical and angiographic data, 68 had baseline HDL-C <0.91 mmol/L (35 mg/dL), mean 0.82+/-0.06 mmol/L (31. 7+/-2.2 mg/dL), versus 1.23+/-0.29 mmol/L (47.4+/-11.2 mg/dL) in patients with baseline HDL-C >/=0.91 mmol/L. Among patients on placebo, those with low HDL-C had significantly more angiographic progression than those with higher HDL-C. Fluvastatin significantly reduced progression among low-HDL-C patients: 0.065+/-0.036 mm versus 0.274+/-0.045 mm in placebo patients (P=0.0004); respective minimum lumen diameter decreases among higher-HDL-C patients were 0. 036+/-0.021 mm and 0.083+/-0.019 mm (P=0.09). The treatment effect of fluvastatin on minimum lumen diameter change was significantly greater among low-HDL-C patients than among higher-HDL-C patients (P=0.01); among low-HDL-C patients, fluvastatin patients had improved event-free survival compared with placebo patients. CONCLUSIONS--Although the predominant lipid-modifying effect of fluvastatin is to decrease LDL-C, patients with low HDL-C received the greatest angiographic and clinical benefit.",

    "59": "We have studied the effects of two cholesterol-lowering medications, lovastatin and pravastatin, on different sleep parameters in hypercholesterolemic subjects. These medications are 3-hydroxy-methylglutaryl coenzyme A inhibitors. Only subjects who had complained of sleep disturbance while on previous treatment with lovastatin were enrolled. Sixteen subjects (11 men and 5 women) underwent a randomized, double-blind, three-way crossover treatment with lovastatin, pravastatin, and placebo. Each phase of the study lasted 4 weeks. A placebo wash-out period of 4 weeks separated each treatment phase. At the end of each treatment phase, subjects were admitted to the sleep laboratory for 2 consecutive nights. No statistical differences were detected during treatment with lovastatin, pravastatin, and placebo for sleep parameters such as total sleep time, total awake time, wake time after sleep onset, efficiency of sleep, and percent of different phases of sleep. Our study suggests that lovastatin and pravastatin do not have a significant effect on sleep parameters in hypercholesterolemic subjects that could explain their complaints of insomnia. Nevertheless, the subjects did have moderate sleep disturbances that could account for insomnia and most likely predate the use of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.",

Mean international normalized ratio (INR) significantly increased from 2.42 to 2.74, p = 0.002. Although warfarin doses were reduced in 7 patients and increased in 4 patients following the post-conversion INR measurements, the pre- and postconversion median weekly warfarin dose of all 46 patients did not differ significantly. The number of patients with an INR > 3.0 increased significantly from 6 to 16 following the conversion. There was no report of unusual episodes of bleeding.

    "65": "Meta-analyses have investigated the efficacy of cholesterol-lowering interventions in relation to the underlying risk of coronary heart disease and the extent and duration of cholesterol reduction. We systematically reviewed the efficacy of antilipidemic interventions on major mortality outcomes in relation to drug classes. We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE from 1966 through October 1996 for randomized, controlled trials of any cholesterol-lowering interventions reporting mortality data. We included 59 trials involving 85 431 participants in the intervention and 87 729 participants in the control groups. We pooled these trials into 7 pharmacological categories of cholesterol-lowering interventions: statins (13 trials), fibrates (12 trials), resins (8 trials), hormones (8 trials), niacin acid (2 trials), n-3 fatty acids (3 trials), and dietary interventions (16 trials). Of the cholesterol-lowering interventions, only statins showed a large and statistically significant reduction in mortality from coronary heart disease (risk ratio, 0.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.54 to 0. 79) and from all causes (risk ratio, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.65 to 0.86). For both all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, the difference between statins and the combined estimate of the other classes of agents was unlikely to be due to chance (P<0.02 for both comparisons). Meta-regression analysis demonstrated that variability in results across trials could be largely explained on the basis of differences in the magnitude of cholesterol reduction. Statins have the largest effect on the reduction of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality, and this result recommends their use in preference to other antilipidemic agents. The greater effect of statins is likely due to the larger reduction in cholesterol.", 
    "66": "The filamentous dimorphic fungus Mucor racemosus possesses three ras genes, Mras1, 2, and 3, whose expression is correlated to morphogenesis of the fungus. Lovastatin, an indirect inhibitor of protein prenylation, altered the processing of MRas1 protein, blocked the accumulation of MRas3 protein, and caused the MRas1/p20 protein complex to disappear in M. racemosus. Concurrently it arrested sporangiospore germination, decreased growth rate, caused a loss of cell viability accompanied by cell shrinkage, increased cell density and cytoplasm condensation, and triggered DNA fragmentation, resulting in nucleosomes and nucleosome multimers. The specific morphological and biochemical events seen in Mucor cell death, particularly DNA fragmentation, resemble the best known characteristics of classical apoptosis in mammalian cells and prompted us to classify lovastatin-induced cell death as an apoptosis-like process. Lovastatin did not cause cell death in a leucine auxotroph of Mucor grown in YNB minimal medium, conditions which support only spherical growth during spore germination. Exogenous dibutyryl-cAMP initiated morphogenesis from hyphal (polar) growth to yeast-like (spherical) growth during spore germination and strongly prevented cell death which resulted from lovastatin treatment. Wortmannin added together with dibutyryl-cAMP showed a synergistic effect in the prevention of fungal cell death. These data suggest that the regulation of lovastatin-induced cell death in Mucor requires a signal transduction pathway(s) involving cAMP whose function is specific to a particular developmental stage.",

The perfusion solitions differed regarding concentrations of fluvastatin (0-2500 microM) and surface tension (58.9-43.7 mN/m). A cellulose derivative, ethyl-(hydroxyethyl) cellulose (EHEC), was added to lower the surface tension of one of the perfusion solutions. The surface tension of perfusion solutions containing R/S-verapamil (8-814 microM) and R/S-verapamil + chlorpromazine (814 microM + 10 mM) were related to the corresponding P(eff)-values from the literature.",

    "75": "We recently demonstrated that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme of de novo cholesterol synthesis, was a potential mediator of the biological effects of retinoic acid on human neuroblastoma cells. The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, lovastatin, which is used extensively in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, induced a potent apoptotic response in human neuroblastoma cells. This apoptotic response was triggered at lower concentrations and occurred more rapidly than had been previously reported in other tumor-derived cell lines, including breast and prostate carcinomas. Because of the increased sensitivity of neuroblastoma cells to lovastatin-induced apoptosis, we examined the effect of this agent on a variety of tumor cells, including leukemic cell lines and primary patient samples. Based on a variety of cytotoxicity and apoptosis assays, the 6 acute lymphocytic leukemia cell lines tested displayed a weak apoptotic response to lovastatin. In contrast, the majority of the acute myeloid leukemic cell lines (6/7) and primary cell cultures (13/22) showed significant sensitivity to lovastatin-induced apoptosis, similar to the neuroblastoma cell response. Of significance, in the acute myeloid leukemia, but not the acute lymphocytic leukemia cell lines, lovastatin-induced cytotoxicity was pronounced even at the physiological relevant concentrations of this agent. Therefore, our study suggests the evaluation of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors as a therapeutic approach in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia.",

Both PRA and simvastatin (SIM) are equally effective in reducing LDL, but only PRA reduces platelet aggregation and is an effective vasodilator. Nitric oxide (NO) also inhibits platelet aggregation and vasodilates.", 
    "78": "We determined PRA and SIM effects on vasorelaxation in aortic rings and NO production by cultured bovine aortic endothelial cells. Nitric oxide was measured by using a NO electrode and by an assay for conversion of hemoglobin to methemoglobin. Specificity of NOS activation was tested by using the NOS inhibitor nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 1 mmol/liter) in the presence or absence of excess L-arginine (L-ARG, 1 mmol/liter).", 
    "79": "Endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation was maximal with acetylocholine (ACH, 100%), followed by PRA (62.8%) and then SIM (37.1%). Direct measurement of NO confirmed that vasorelaxation is due to NO release and showed that PRA and ACH had similar dose-dependent effects on NO production, while SIM was only 25% to 30% as effective. Methemoglobin assay confirmed these results and demonstrated their specificity for NOS activity. The L-NAME blunted the responses to 45% of initial values. Excess L-ARG reversed this effect and potentiated NO production to 133% of initial levels.", 
    "80": "Both PRA and SIM activate eNOS, but SIM is much less effective. Clinical benefits with PRA not explained by LDL reductions may be the result of an independent action of PRA on eNOS activation.",

    "82": "The CARE study cohort provided a relatively unique opportunity to examine the relation between lipid levels and clinical events in a post-myocardial infarction (MI) population with relatively low cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol values.", 
    "83": "There were 4,159 patients with a previous infarct and a total cholesterol level <240 mg/dl, LDL cholesterol level 115 to 174 mg/dl and triglyceride level <350 mg/dl randomly allocated to placebo (n=2,078) or pravastatin 40 mg/day (n=2,081). Time to either coronary death or nonfatal MI (primary end point) or to the secondary end point, which included undergoing a coronary revascularization procedure, was determined as a function of baseline lipids (total, LDL, high density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol and triglyceride levels).", 
    "84": "Quartile analysis indicated important effects for LDL cholesterol, in which a higher LDL was associated with greater cardiac event rates (in the placebo group, every 25-mg/dl increment in LDL was associated with a 28% increased risk [5% to 56%, p=0.015]) in the primary event. The differential event rates with respect to baseline LDL cholesterol for placebo and pravastatin groups reduced the difference in clinical outcomes at lower LDL cholesterol levels. In both the placebo and pravastatin groups, an inverse relation between baseline HDL cholesterol and cardiac events was observed (10 mg/dl lower baseline HDL cholesterol level was associated with a 10% [0% to 19%, p=0.046] increase in coronary death or nonfatal MI).", 
    "85": "Within the LDL cholesterol levels in CARE (115 to 174 mg/dl), baseline values influenced both the risk of events in the placebo group as well as the clinical effectiveness of pravastatin therapy.", 
    "86": "The problem of choosing between detection of asymptomatic coronary heart disease (CHD) in patients at risk and primary prevention was assessed in a decision analysis model. Most of the relevant data were derived from the WOSCOP study, which evaluated the effects of statins in asymptomatic hypercholesterolaemic subjects. This study is considered to be a model of primary prevention measurement. Over a 5-year period, 10% of control subjects had events related to CHD, with a 20% mortality rate which was reduced by 33% under statin administration. A decision tree was used to compare these two sets of data (controls and treated patients) with those of a third option in which an exercise test, 201Tl scintigraphy and, in certain cases, coronary arteriography were used to detect and treat CHD at an asymptomatic stage. The test characteristics and outcomes correspond as closely as possible to previously reported data, concerning what can be expected in this particular situation. Over a wide range of CHD probabilities, screening appeared to be better than primary prevention. This result is robust since it was not modified by sensitivity analysis for most of the data. A sharp decrease in the sensitivity of the first two tests and a marked increase in the effectiveness of primary prevention would alter the decision in favour of primary prevention, whereas an increased death rate from CHD and higher CHD probability would favour the utility of screening. As the cost-effectiveness of screening compares favourably with that of primary prevention, it may be useful to assess the validity of this model in a prospective controlled study.", 
    "87": "Accumulation of oxidatively modified low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) in the vascular wall is a characteristic feature of atherosclerosis. oxLDL can be taken up into monocytes, smooth muscle cells, and endothelial cells by several known scavenger receptors such as scavenger receptor class A I and II, CD36, and CD68. A new lectin-like oxLDL receptor (LOX-1) was recently found in bovine and human endothelial cells. We studied whether LOX-1 is also expressed in other cells present in the atherosclerotic lesion and whether its expression can be modified. We found LOX-1 expression in human blood monocytes, umbilical smooth muscle and endothelial cells, and 3T3 fibroblasts. LOX-1 mRNA expression in monocytes could be significantly suppressed by lovastatin. Thus, LOX-1 expression is not restricted to endothelial cells and its down-regulation by HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors could contribute to the clinical benefits of these drugs.", 
    "88": "Tumor cell arrest and tumor migration are two of the critical steps in the metastatic cascade. We hypothesized that these steps may be facilitated by the low density lipoprotein (LDL)-induced activation of microvessel endothelial cells (MVEC). The purpose of our study was to investigate the biological effects of an LDL-enriched milieu and the effects of the anticholesterol drug Lovastatin on metastatic behavior. The SW480 and SW620 are primary and metastatic human colonic adenocarcinoma cell lines derived from the same patient. We investigated the effect of LDL on adhesion and migration of the two tumor cell lines across human brain, lung, liver and dermal endothelial monolayers. Adhesion and migration assays were done before and after pretreatment of the MVEC or tumor cells with LDL (100 microg/ml) for 24 h. Although metastatic SW620 cells were more adherent to MVEC compared with primary SW480 cells, LDL pretreatment of SW480 and SW620 cells did not affect tumor cell adhesion to MVEC. In contrast, tumor cell migration was significantly increased across endothelial monolayers when MVEC were pretreated with LDL. Transendothelial cell migration was not significantly affected by pretreatment of the tumor cells with LDL. Lovastatin is an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. It has been shown to have anti-tumor activity in vitro. We investigated the effect of Lovastatin on tumor cell kinetics and tumor cell migration across MVEC. Growth curves and migration assays were done before and after pretreatment of the tumor cells with Lovastatin (30 microg/ml). Migration assays were also done after treatment of unstimulated or LDL-stimulated MVEC (100 microg/ml) for 24 h with Lovastatin. Lovastatin inhibited the in vitro growth of the metastatic SW620 cell line to a greater extent than the invasive SW480E cell line. On the other hand, pretreatment of tumor cells with Lovastatin (30 microg/ml) did not suppress transendothelial tumor cell migration of tumor cells. Finally, Lovastatin given to mice effectively suppressed the number of MCA-26 tumor colonies in the liver of Balb/c mice compared with untreated mice.",

We therefore studied the biliary precipitable and soluble cholesterol and noncholesterol sterols, including the cholesterol precursor sterols (including lanosterol and lathosterols), and the plant sterols campesterol and sitosterol, and cholestanol, which usually reflect cholesterol synthesis and absorption, respectively, before and after a 6-month treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid (UCDA), 15.4 +/- 4 mg/kg/day (standard error of the mean) or simvastatin (40 mg/day) in 21 patients with cholesterol gallstones, to obtain further information about the factors contributing to the formation of gallstones.",

    "91": "At the base line (n = 21) 50% +/- 3% of biliary cholesterol and a variable amount of the noncholesterol sterols (from 14% of lanosterol to 62% of cholestanol) were in the sediment fraction. The pattern of the noncholesterol sterols in the sediment resembled that of gallstones described previously. At base line body mass index was positively related to the percentage of precipitable cholesterol in bile (r = 0.46, P < 0.05), and the serum sitosterol proportion negatively related to the molar percentage of biliary cholesterol and positively to that of bile acids (r = -0.46 and r = 0.50, P < 0.05 for both). UDCA decreased the precipitable percentage of cholesterol from 46% to 31% (P < 0.03) and simvastatin from 57% to 42% (P = 0.05). Both drugs also decreased the precipitable percentages of lathosterols and cholestanol while increasing that of lanosterol. In relation to cholesterol, the sediment to supernatant ratios of all methylsterols were increased, whereas those of polar lathosterols tended to decrease during UDCA treatment.", 
    "92": "Patients with high body mass index have more precipitable cholesterol in their bile. Although both UDCA and simvastatin decreased the precipitable cholesterol, the bile still contained one-third of its cholesterol in the sedimentable form.",

    "95": "Eighty-three patients with hyperlipidemia were treated with combined pravastatin and gemfibrozil therapy for a median of 44 months (range 9-78 months). Plasma lipids, serum liver function tests, creatinine, and creatinine kinase (CK) levels were measured every 3 to 4 months.",

Three patients had transient elevations in CK levels that ranged from 3 to 5 times the upper limits of \"normal\" and that returned to normal upon repeat testing. Liver function tests did not change significantly from baseline. In a subset of 26 previously untreated patients, combined pravastatin (mean daily dose 22 mg) and gemfibrozil (mean daily dose 1,154 mg) therapy lowered total cholesterol by 25% (p < 0.001), triglycerides by 53% (p = 0.0001), LDL cholesterol by 14% (p = 0.24), and increased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by 20% (p = 0.012).",

    "98": "In an in vitro study, the cytochrome P-450 3A (CYP3A)-dependent metabolism and drug interactions of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Co A reductase inhibitors lovastatin and pravastatin were compared. Lovastatin was metabolized by human liver microsomes to two major metabolites: 6'beta-hydroxy [Michaelis-Menten constant (Km): 7.8 +/- 2.7 microM] and 6'-exomethylene lovastatin (Km,10.3 +/- 2.6 microM). 6'beta-Hydroxylovastatin formation in the liver was inhibited by the specific CYP3A inhibitors cyclosporine (Ki, 7.6 +/- 2.3 microM), ketoconazole (Ki, 0.25 +/- 0.2 microM), and troleandomycin (Ki, 26.6 +/- 18.5 microM). Incubation of pravastatin with human liver microsomes resulted in the generation of 3'alpha,5'beta, 6'beta-trihydroxy pravastatin (Km, 4,887 +/- 2,185 microM) and hydroxy pravastatin (Km, 20,987 +/- 9,389 microM). The formation rates of 3'alpha,5'beta,6'beta-trihydroxy pravastatin by reconstituted CYP3A enzymes were (1,000 microM pravastatin) 1.9 +/- 0.6 pmol.min-1.pmol CYP3A4 and 0.06 +/- 0.04 pmol.min-1.pmol CYP3A5, and the formation rates of hydroxy pravastatin were 0.12 +/- 0.02 pmol.min-1.pmol CYP3A4 and 0.02 +/- 0.004 pmol.min-1.pmol CYP3A5. The specific CYP3A inhibitors cyclosporine, ketoconazole, and troleandomycin significantly inhibited hydroxy pravastatin formation by human liver microsomes, but only ketoconazole inhibited 3'alpha, 5'beta,6'beta-trihydroxy pravastatin formation, suggesting that other CYP enzymes are involved in its formation. It is concluded that, compared with lovastatin [CLint formation 6'beta-hydroxylovastatin (microl.min-1.mg-1): 199 +/- 248, 6'-exomethylene lovastatin: 138 +/- 104)], CYP3A-dependent metabolism of pravastatin [CLint formation 3'alpha,5'beta, 6'beta-trihydroxy pravastatin (microl.min-1.mg-1): 0.03 +/- 0.03 and hydroxy pravastatin: 0.02 +/- 0.02] is a minor elimination pathway. In contrast to lovastatin, drug interactions with pravastatin CYP3A-catalyzed metabolism cannot be expected to have a clinically significant effect on its pharmacokinetics.", 
    "99": "Recommendations for the prescription of lipid-lowering drugs emphasise the importance of an assessment of absolute coronary heart disease (CHD) risk based on all risk factors, rather than simply the serum cholesterol concentration. If, however, the methods recommended for risk assessment are inaccurate, recommended prescribing will not occur. We compared several sets of guidelines for such treatment in a series of patients referred to a lipid clinic, to assess the difference in degree of risk of CHD at which lipid-lowering medication is recommended by each set of guidelines.",

The Framingham equation estimated a CHD risk of more than 3% per year in 22% of the men and 7% of the women, which shows that the UK tables underestimated CHD risk. European guidelines could be applied to only 261 patients, and were reasonably accurate in assessment of a CHD risk of 2% per year.",

    "104": "In an open clinical trial, CFR was studied in 15 patients with angiographically documented multivessel CAD and hypercholesterolemia (LDL >160 mg/dL). Dynamic 13N-labeled ammonia PET imaging in conjunction with adenosine was used to assess regional and global CFR at baseline as well as at 2 and 6 months during treatment with fluvastatin (60 to 80 mg/d). Despite a rapid decrease in total cholesterol (29+/-6%) and LDL (37+/-9%), myocardial blood flow at rest and during stress was unchanged after 2 months of treatment (2.7+/-0.9 versus 2.5+/-0.6 mL x g-1 x min-1). At 6 months, stress blood flow as well as CFR increased significantly (3.4+/-1.0 mL x g-1 x min-1). No change in hemodynamic parameters was noted during the entire study. Nine of 15 patients increased CFR by >20%. All responders demonstrated improvement in anginal symptoms, whereas nonresponders stated no change (n=4) or worsening of symptoms (n=2). The improvement in CFR was not related to the amount of lipid lowering and was independent of the severity of stenoses.",

    "106": "The inhibitors of protein prenylation have been proposed for chemotherapy of tumors. Lovastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, displays proapoptotic activity in tumor cells blocking the synthesis of isoprenoids compounds. To test whether HMG-CoA reductase inhibition can induce apoptosis in proliferating thyroid cells, we studied the effects of lovastatin in normal and neoplastic thyroid cells and in primary cultures from normal human thyroids. In an immortalized human thyroid cell line (TAD-2) and in neoplastic cells, lovastatin induced cell rounding within 24 h of treatment. After 48 h the cells were detached from the plate and underwent apoptosis, as evidenced by DNA fragmentation. Morphological changes and apoptosis did not occur in serum-starved quiescent TAD-2 cells or in primary cultures of normal thyrocytes. Mevalonate, the product of the HMG-CoA reductase enzymatic activity, and the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide completely blocked the effects of lovastatin in a dose-dependent fashion. The geranylgeranyl transferase GGTI-298 inhibitor mimicked the effects of lovastatin on cell morphology and induced cell death, whereas the farnesyl transferase inhibitor FTI-277 was less effective to induce both cell rounding and apoptosis. Resistance to lovastatin-induced apoptosis by expression of the viral serpine CrmA and by the peptide inhibitor of caspases, Z-DEVD-fmk, demonstrated the involvement of CrmA-sensitive, caspase-3-like proteases. Inhibition of endogenous p53 activity did not affect the sensitivity of thyroid cells to lovastatin, demonstrating that this type of apoptosis is p53 independent. We conclude that lovastatin is a potent inducer of apoptosis in proliferating thyroid cells through inhibition of protein prenylation. This type of apoptosis requires protein synthesis, is CrmA sensitive and caspase-3-like protease dependent, and is independent from p53.", 
    "107": "Fluvastatin (FV) is a highly potent inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase. Recently, its antioxidant effect caused by inhibiting the formation of low density lipoproteins (LDL) in vitro has been reported. In this study, we reported the antioxidant effects of FV and its major metabolites in human (M-2, M-3, M-4, M-5, and M-7) on lipid peroxidation using rat liver microsomes. The extent of NADPH-induced microsomal (Ms) lipid peroxidation was determined by the thiobarbituric acid (TBA) assay. The antioxidant effect of each compound was shown as the percentage of inhibition on the formation of TBA reactive substances (TBARS) against the vehicle control. Probucol (PR), a potent antioxidant drug, was used as a reference control. The concentration of each compound in this experiment was set at 0.1 mM (final conc.). FV inhibited the formation of TBARS by 30 to 60% without depending on the used Ms concentrations (0.025-0.2 mg protein/ml). The antioxidant effects of M-2, M-3, and M-5 were comparable to that of FV at low Ms concentrations. At the highest Ms concentration, however, the antioxidant effects of these metabolites were considerably higher than that of FV. Inhibition of the formation of TBARS by M-4 or M-7 was approximately 30% of the control and independent of the used Ms concentrations. The antioxidant effect of PR was comparable to those of M-2, M-3, and M-5 in this study. Pravastatin (PV), a potent inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, reduced the formation of TBARS around 20% at 0.25 or 0.5 mg protein/ml of Ms concentrations. But the value of percentage of inhibition was around 5% at 0.1 or 0.2 mg protein/ml of Ms concentrations. In conclusion, the antioxidant effects of FV, M-2, M-3, and M-5 were found to be comparable to that of PR.", 
    "108": "The endothelium contributes to the regulation of vascular tone by producing nitric oxide (NO) and the endothelium-derived hyperpolarising factor (EDHF). In hypercholesterolemia, endothelium-dependent relaxation is impaired but can be restored by treatment with lovastatin (LOVAS). We investigated the effects of LOVAS on NO and EDHF-mediated relaxation. Rabbits were fed 1% cholesterol diet for 4 weeks and 0.5%) cholesterol for the following 12 weeks (CHOL-group). The LOVAS group additionally received 10 mg of lovastatin over the last 12-week period. Experiments were performed in carotid artery rings. Relaxant responses to acetylcholine (ACh) were recorded in the presence of indomethacin. Nitro-L-arginine (NOARG, 100 microM) and potassium chloride (KCl, 35 mM) were used to differentiate between NO- and EDHF-mediated relaxations. Cholesterol impaired ACh-induced relaxations and this effect was prevented by LOVAS (control 100+/-1%, CHOL 81+/-6%, LOVAS 98+/-1%). In the presence of NOARG, relaxations to ACh were not different between the LOVAS and CHOL groups (control 78+/-4%, CHOL 64+/-6%, LOVAS 64+/-5%). When KCl was used, ACh-induced relaxations were similar in the LOVAS and control group (control 75+/-5%, CHOL 49+/-6%, LOVAS 76+/-2%). In arteries treated with NOARG and KCl together, no relaxations were observed. Relaxations of arteries from the control group were not affected by 18 h preincubation with lovastatin (10 microM). Lovastatin selectively maintains nitric oxide-mediated endothelium-dependent relaxation in hypercholesterolemic rabbit carotid arteries.", 
    "109": "3-Hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors currently used as cholesterol-lowering drugs produce side effects in patients, one of which is myopathy. In the present study we compared the effect of a 3-month chronic treatment with two different compounds, simvastatin and pravastatin, on the excitation-contraction coupling of rat skeletal muscle fibers, the mechanism which links membrane depolarization to the movements of cytosolic Ca2+ from intracellular stores. The voltage threshold for mechanical activation of extensor digitorum longus muscle fibers in response to depolarizing pulses of various durations was studied in vitro by the two intracellular microelectrode method in 'point' voltage clamp mode. Simvastatin (5-50 mg/kg) modified the mechanical threshold of striated fibers in a dose-dependent manner. The muscle fibers of rats treated with 10 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg of simvastatin needed significantly less depolarization to contract than did untreated fibers at each pulse duration, suggesting that levels of cytosolic Ca2+ were higher. Consequently, the rheobase voltage for fiber contraction was significantly shifted toward more negative potentials with respect to controls by 2.4 mV and 7.1 mV in the 10 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg simvastatin-treated animals, respectively. Pravastatin treatment at 100 mg/kg did not produce any alteration of excitation-contraction coupling since the rheobase voltage was similar to that of controls. The different physicochemical properties of the two drugs may underlie the different effect observed because lipophilic agents, such as simvastatin, have been shown to affect sterol biosynthesis in many tissues, whereas the hydrophilic pravastatin is hepato-selective.", 
    "110": "Atheroma is related to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) composition. LDL in diabetic patients-a group with increased risk of severe atheroma-has been shown by our group and others to have various compositional alterations that are potentially atherogenic. Little is known about the relationship between LDL turnover and composition. This study examined the relationship between LDL composition and turnover in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) patients. Twenty-two NIDDM patients with a mean plasma cholesterol of 6.6+/-1.5 mmol/L were studied. Twelve subjects were hypercholesterolemic (mean cholesterol, 7.7+/-0.8 mmol/L), and eight of these agreed to be studied a second time after 4 weeks of treatment with simvastatin. LDL was isolated by density gradient ultracentrifugation, iodinated, and reinjected into the patient. LDL turnover was determined by measuring the clearance of [125I]-LDL from plasma over a 10-day period. The LDL residence time, determined using a biexponential model, correlated negatively with the body mass index (BMI) (r = -.73, P<.001) and serum triglycerides (r = - .57, P<.01). There was a significant inverse correlation between LDL residence time and the LDL esterified to free cholesterol ratio in hypercholesterolemic subjects (r = -.94, P<.001). There was a significant inverse relationship between LDL residence time and both hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and fasting blood glucose in these subjects before treatment (P<.005). After simvastatin therapy, the relationships were no longer significant. Simvastatin treatment was associated with a shorter LDL residence time (P<.01) and a decrease in LDL glycation (P<.001) with virtually no change in diabetic control (HbA1c, 6.0%+/-3.1% v. 6.3%+/-3.3%, NS). This study suggests that a decrease in residence time by upregulation of the LDL receptor with simvastatin alters LDL composition in a way that is likely to render the particle less atherogenic.", 
    "111": "To investigate the potential effects of high-dose 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor on plasma phytosterol, total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglyceride (TG), hypercholesterolemic subjects received 40 or 80 mg/d simvastatin in a 24-week prospective clinical trial. Plasma lipid levels were analyzed enzymatically, and plasma phytosterol concentrations were determined using gas-liquid chromatography. The change in the plasma phytosterol-campesterol level was used as an indicator of cholesterol absorption in humans. Simvastatin treatment reduced plasma campesterol (-24%, P = .017) but did not affect circulating stigmasterol and sitosterol levels. A dose of 80 mg/d simvastatin produced a larger decrease (P = .050) in plasma campesterol (0.1680 mmol/L) than 40 mg/d (0.0237 mmol/L) versus baseline. There was a positive correlation between plasma campesterol and TC both before (r = .54, P = .027) and after (r = .63, P = .009) treatment. Plasma TC and TG levels did not differ between groups receiving 40 or 80 mg/d simvastatin. Simvastatin treatment reduced circulating TC, LDL-C, and TG by 40%, 50%, and 33% (P<.007), respectively. There was no significant effect of simvastatin on plasma HDL-C, but the HDL-C/LDL-C ratio increased 1.3-fold (P<.0001). In conclusion, this HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor reduces the plasma campesterol level, a marker of cholesterol absorption, which may contribute to the mechanism by which simvastatin decreases circulating cholesterol levels.", 
    "112": "The most appropriate therapy for combined hyperlipidemia remains to be determined. We compared the lipid-regulating effects of gemfibrozil and lovastatin in 30 patients with familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL) in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study including 8-week courses of one drug followed by a washout period and a crossover phase to the alternate drug. After completion of the trial, open-label combination therapy was given for up to 12 months. Lovastatin was more efficacious than gemfibrozil in the reduction of total cholesterol (23% v. 9%, P<.001) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (28% v. 2%, P<.001), whereas gemfibrozil surpassed lovastatin in the reduction of triglycerides (48% v. 0%, P<.001) and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol (50% v. 19%, P = .005) and the increase of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (18% v. 4%, P = .005). Lovastatin caused a greater decline in total apolipoprotein B (apo B) and LDL apo B than gemfibrozil, whereas VLDL apo B decreased only after gemfibrozil therapy. Drug-induced changes in lipoprotein composition indicated that gemfibrozil reduced both the number and size of VLDL particles and lovastatin decreased the number of LDL particles. Combined treatment was safe and had additive effects on lipids, causing significant (P<.001) reductions in total cholesterol (32%), triglycerides (51%), LDL cholesterol (34%), and apo B (26%) and an increase in HDL cholesterol (19%). Target LDL cholesterol levels were achieved only in 11% of patients given gemfibrozil alone and triglycerides decreased to target levels in 22% after lovastatin alone, whereas combined therapy normalized both lipid fractions in 96% of patients. Thus, in FCHL, gemfibrozil has no effect on LDL cholesterol levels but favorably influences the putative atherogenic alterations of lipoprotein composition that are related to hypertriglyceridemia. Conversely, lovastatin markedly decreases LDL cholesterol but has little effect on triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. Combination treatment safely corrects all of the lipid abnormalities in most patients.",

Flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery (by ultrasonography) improved (all P<0.001 versus baseline values) on CE (4.0+/-2.6% to 10.2+/-3.9%), simvastatin (4.3+/-2.4% to 10.0+/-3.9%), and CE combined with simvastatin (4.6+/-2.0% to 9.8+/-2.6%), but similarly among therapies (P=0.507 by ANOVA). None of the therapies improved the dilator response to nitroglycerin (all P>/=0.184). Only therapies including CE lowered levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 and the cell adhesion molecule E-selectin (all P<0. 05 versus simvastatin).", 
    "119": "Although estrogen and statin therapies have differing effects on lipoprotein levels, specific improvement in endothelium-dependent vasodilator responsiveness is similar. However, only therapies including estrogen improved markers of fibrinolysis and vascular inflammation. Thus, estrogen therapy appears to have unique properties that may benefit the vasculature of hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal women, even if they are already on cholesterol-lowering therapy.", 
    "120": "Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) is a common disorder associated with early coronary artery disease, especially in men. The age at which drug therapy should be started is still controversial, as is the use of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins).", 
    "121": "To assess the lipid-lowering efficacy, biochemical safety, and effect on growth and sexual development of lovastatin in adolescent boys with HeFH.", 
    "122": "One-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled, balanced, 2-period, 2-arm randomized trial. In the first period (24 weeks), lovastatin was increased at 8 and 16 weeks and the dosage remained stable during the second period (24 weeks). The study was conducted between 1990 and 1994.", 
    "123": "Fourteen pediatric outpatient clinics in the United States and Finland.", 
    "124": "Boys aged 10 to 17 years with HeFH. Of 132 randomized subjects (67 intervention, 65 placebo), 122 (63 intervention, 59 placebo) and 110 (61 intervention, 49 placebo) completed the first and second periods, respectively.", 
    "125": "Lovastatin, starting at 10 mg/d, with a forced titration at 8 and 16 weeks to 20 and 40 mg/d, respectively, or placebo.", 
    "126": "The primary efficacy outcome measure was low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Primary safety measures were growth and sexual development.", 
    "127": "Compared with placebo, LDL-C levels of patients receiving lovastatin decreased significantly (P<.001) by 17%, 24%, and 27% receiving dosages of 10, 20, and 40 mg/d, respectively, and remained 25 % lower than baseline at 48 weeks. Growth and sexual maturation assessed by Tanner staging and testicular volume were not significantly different between the lovastatin and placebo groups at 24 weeks (P = .85) and 48 weeks (P = .33); neither were serum hormone levels or biochemical parameters of nutrition. However, the study was underpowered to detect significant differences in safety parameters. Serum vitamin E levels were reduced with lovastatin treatment consistent with reductions in LDL-C, the major carrier of vitamin E in the circulation.", 
    "128": "This study in adolescent boys with HeFH confirmed the LDL-C-reducing effectiveness of lovastatin. Comprehensive clinical and biochemical data on growth, hormonal, and nutritional status indicated no significant differences between lovastatin and placebo over 48 weeks, although further study is required.", 
    "129": "Combined use of niacin with a statin is an attractive option, since these types of medication have the best records in clinical trials for reduction in cardiovascular events and improvement in progression/regression of coronary lesions. In early use, the niacin-statin combination generated a few case reports documenting severe myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Subsequent prospective trials in >400 patients, however, have not encountered myopathy. This experience includes 165 patients who took a statin in combination with Niaspan, a new, extended-release niacin administered once nightly. Hepatic toxicity with immediate-release niacin and with Niaspan used in combination with statins has been minimal. However, substantial transaminase elevations occurred with the use of a sustained-release niacin (Nicobid) given twice daily. The niacin-statin treatment regimens gave augmented low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol reduction along with favorable changes in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, lipoprotein(a), and triglycerides. This combination therapy can be used safely as long as (1) careful attention is given to niacin formulation and dosing; (2) liver functions are monitored; and (3) patients are educated to recognize symptoms of myopathy. However, special caution should apply to use of niacin in combination with high doses of statins, or with statins introduced into clinical practice in 1997 or later, since little experience has accumulated in these circumstances."
