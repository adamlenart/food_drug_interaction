    "0": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) converts HMG-CoA to mevalonate, a key intermediate in the formation of cholesterol and several nonsterol isoprenoid compounds. Using the bromodeoxyuridine/bisbenzimide photosensitization technique, we isolated a mutant clone of Chinese hamster ovary cells that requires mevalonate for growth. This mutant, designated UT-2 cells, expresses 2-5% of the HMG-CoA reductase activity of parental Chinese hamster ovary cells, even after growth for 9 months in the absence of selective pressure. By immunoblotting, no cross-reactive HMG-CoA reductase protein was detected in UT-2 cells. Incorporation of [14C]acetate and [14C]pyruvate into cholesterol was less than 5% of that in parental Chinese hamster ovary cells. In contrast, [3H]mevalonate incorporation into cholesterol was normal. The activities of acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase and HMG-CoA synthase, the two enzymes that precede HMG-CoA reductase in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, were normal or slightly elevated in UT-2 cells. No gross deletions or rearrangements in the gene for HMG-CoA reductase were apparent when DNA from UT-2 cells was digested with restriction endonucleases, subjected to Southern blotting, and probed with a 32P-labeled cDNA for HMG-CoA reductase. We conclude that UT-2 cells have a mutation that specifically prevents the production of normal amounts of HMG-CoA reductase.", 
    "1": "Dichloroacetate (DCA) markedly reduces circulating cholesterol levels in animals and in patients with combined hyperlipoproteinemia or homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). To investigate the mechanism of its cholesterol-lowering action, we studied the effects of DCA and its hepatic metabolites, glyoxylate and oxalate, on the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG CoA reductase) obtained from livers of healthy, reverse light-cycled rats. Oral administration of DCA for 4 d decreased HMG CoA reductase activity 46% at a dose of 50 mg/kg per d, and 82% at a dose of 100 mg/kg per d. A 24% decrease in reductase activity was observed as early as 1 h after a single dose of 50 mg/kg DCA. The inhibitory effect of the drug was due to a fall in both expressed enzyme activity and the total number of reductase molecules present. DCA also decreased reductase activity when added to suspensions of isolated hepatocytes. With chronic administration, DCA inhibited 3H2O incorporation into cholesterol by 38% and into triglycerides by 52%. When liver microsomes were incubated with DCA, the pattern of inhibition of reductase activity was noncompetitive for both HMG CoA (inhibition constant [Ki] 11.8 mM) and NADPH (Ki 11.6 mM). Inhibition by glyoxylate was also noncompetitive for both HMG CoA (Ki 1.2 mM) and NADPH (Ki 2.7 mM). Oxalate inhibited enzyme activity only at nonsaturating concentrations of NADPH (Ki 5.6 mM). Monochloroacetate, glycollate, and ethylene glycol, all of which can form glyoxylate, also inhibited reductase activity. Using solubilized and 60-fold purified HMG CoA reductase, we found that the inhibitory effect of glyoxylate was reversible. Furthermore, the inhibition by glyoxylate was an effect exerted on the reductase itself, rather than on its regulatory enzymes, reductase kinase and reductase phosphatase. We conclude that the cholesterol-lowering effect of DCA is mediated, at least in part, by inhibition of endogenous cholesterol synthesis. The probable mechanisms are by inhibition of expressed reductase activity by DCA per se and by conversion of DCA to an active metabolite, glyoxylate, which noncompetitively inhibits HMG CoA reductase. These studies thus identify a new class of pharmacological agents that may prove useful in regulating cholesterol synthesis and circulating cholesterol levels in man.", 
    "2": "The availability of multicopy plasmid vectors for the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae allows the selective amplification of individual segments of the genome. Increased dosage of particular genes results in overproduction of specific gene products and thereby confers resistance to certain metabolic inhibitors. Advantage was taken of this fact to isolate recombinant clones that increase the activities of the enzymes UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-1-P transferase and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase.", 
    "3": "Decreased activities of both 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) synthase and HMG CoA reductase are observed in the presence of sterol in the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) fibroblast. In three different genotypes of CHO cell mutants resistant to 25-hydroxycholesterol both enzyme activities exhibit a decreased response to 25-hydroxycholesterol compared to wild-type cells. Permanently repressed levels of both HMG CoA synthase and HMG CoA reductase activities are observed in another CHO mutant, phenotypically a mevalonate auxotroph. Mevinolin, a competitive inhibitor of HMG CoA reductase, has no effect on HMG CoA synthase activity measured in vitro. Incubation of CHO cells with sublethal concentrations of mevinolin produces an inhibition of the conversion of [14C]acetate to cholesterol and results in elevated levels of both HMG CoA synthase and HMG CoA reductase activities. Studies of CHO cells in sterol-free medium supplemented with cycloheximide indicate that continuous protein synthesis is not required for the maximal expression of HMG CoA synthase activity and provide an explanation for the lack of temporal similarity between HMG CoA synthase and reductase activities after derepression. These results support the hypothesis of a common mode of regulation for HMG CoA synthase and HMG CoA reductase activities in CHO fibroblasts.", 
    "4": "We studied two children who developed normally for the first 3-4 months of life and then displayed a failure-to-thrive syndrome, regression in psychomotor development, pronounced muscular hypotonia, and liver damage. At the age of about 1-2 years, optic atrophy and spastic parapareses were evident. One child died at the age of 2.5 years the other at an age of 4 years. Both children excreted 3-methylglutaconic acid, 0.1-0.4 mol/mol creatinine and 3-methylglutaric acid, 0.02-0.05 mol/mol creatinine. The excretion of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid was not increased. One of the children was available for further biochemical studies. The activity of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA lyase (EC 4.1.3.4) was moderately reduced in leucocytes and fibroblasts. During a 21-h fast there was a normal formation of ketone bodies and we conclude that the cause of the syndrome is not a deficiency of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA lyase. Normal formation of 14CO2 from [1-14C]isovaleric acid and [2-14C]leucine in fibroblasts and leucocytes apparently excludes a deficiency of methylglutaconyl CoA-hydratase (EC 4.2.1.18).", 
    "5": "MDCK Cells seeded on extracellular matrix- (ECM) coated dishes and exposed to medium supplemented with high-density lipoproteins (HDLs, 750 micrograms protein/ml) and transferrin (10 micrograms/ml) have a proliferative rate, final cell density, and morphological appearance similar to those of cells grown in serum-supplemented medium. The mitogenic stimulus provided by HDLs is not limited by the initial cell density at which cultures are seeded, nor is it limited in time, since cells grown in medium supplemented with transferrin and HDLs grew to at least 50 generations. The presence of HDLs in the medium is required in order for cells to survive, since cells actively proliferating in the presence of medium supplemented with HDLs and transferrin begin to die within 2 days after being transferred to medium supplemented only with transferrin. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is mitogenic for MDCK cells when present at low concentrations (from 2.5 to 100 micrograms protein/ml). Above 100 micrograms protein/ml, LDL is cytotoxic and therefore cannot support cell proliferation at an optimal rate. The mitogenic effect of HDLs is also observed when cells are maintained on fibronectin-coated dishes. However, the proliferative rate of the cells is suboptimal and cultures cannot be passaged on this substrate indefinitely, as they can be on ECM-coated dishes. A close association between the ability of HDLs to support cell proliferation and their ability to induce the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase is observed. HMG CoA reductase activity is 18 times higher (70 pmoles/min/10(6) cells) in proliferating cells than in confluent, nondividing cells (4 pmoles/min/10(6) cells). The HMG Coa reductase activity of sparse cells is more sensitive to induction by HDLs (eight-fold higher than control cells) than is the enzyme activity of confluent cells (two-fold higher than control levels). The dose-response relationship between the abilities of HDLs to support proliferation and to induce HMG CoA reductase activity are similar. The time course of the stimulation of proliferation and the increase in enzyme activity of sparse, quiescent cells after exposure to HDLs are parallel. The HMG CoA reductase activity of sparse MDCK cells is induced six-fold by exposure to compactin, a competitive inhibitor of HMG CoA reductase. This induction of HMG CoA reductase is prevented by mevalonic acid, not affected by LDL, and synergistically enhanced by simultaneous exposure to HDLs. HDLs effect a rescue from the cytotoxic effect of compactin, whereas LDL does not.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "6": "Hepatocytes were prepared from rats previously fed either a normal diet or diets containing cholestyramine or cholestyramine plus mevinolin. The rates of synthesis and degradation of HMG-CoA reductase were determined by immunoprecipitation of the enzyme from cells radiolabeled with [35S]methionine during standard pulse or pulse-chase experiments. In cells prepared from rats fed either a normal diet or a diet supplemented with cholestyramine or cholestyramine plus mevinolin, the relative rates of reductase synthesis were 0.08, 0.21, and 0.99%, respectively, of the rates of total cellular protein synthesis. The corresponding apparent half-lives of the enzyme were approximately 114 min, 153 min, and greater than 10 h. We propose that the elevated reductase activity observed in rats fed cholestyramine and mevinolin (Tanaka, R. D., Edwards, P. A., Lan, S.-F., Knoppel, E. M., and Fogelman, A. M. (1982) J. Lipid Res. 23, 1026-1031) is a result of both increased enzyme synthesis and stabilization of the enzyme. We demonstrate that enzyme stabilization is not an inherent property of the enzyme but is dependent on the presence of mevinolin. We propose that enzyme stabilization results from the decreased cellular levels of some product produced endogenously from mevalonate.", 
    "7": "It has been proposed that a platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) may play an important role in the genesis of atherosclerosis by promoting proliferation of smooth muscle cells. The present study shows evidence that fenofibric acid inhibits the growth promoting activity of PDGF on cultured smooth muscle cells. When smooth muscle cells are in a quiescent state by feeding them a PDGF -and lipoproteins- deficient medium, addition of a platelet extract induces DNA synthesis in a synchronous fashion. A 6 hours' exposure of cells to this extract is sufficient for this effect. Fenofibric acid could inhibit this synthesis when the compound was present in the culture medium concomitantly with platelet extract. This result suggests that fenofibric acid target is a cellular event attendant on PDGF-induced growth promotion. Fenofibric acid is a hypolipidemic drug which inhibits 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCoA reductase) activity, the limiting step of endogenous cholesterol synthesis. If any endogenous cholesterol is available, smooth muscle cell cholesterol needs for proliferation can be supplied by LDL-cholesterol. As the addition of LDL to the culture medium did not overcome fenofibric acid inhibition, this demonstrates a cholesterol independent mechanism for the anti-PDGF growth promoting activity. The fact that fenofibric acid, a hypolipidemic drug, can also inhibit growth promoting activity of PDGF suggests that this drug can be effective on the prevention of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases by at least two independent mechanisms.", 
    "8": "Chinese hamster V79 cell mutants resistant to compactin (ML236B) were isolated. A resistant clone, MF-2, grown in the presence of 2 micrograms/ml of ML236B for 1 week showed a 30-fold increase in 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-Co A) reductase activity compared to MF-2 grown in the absence of ML236B, and cells grown for 4 weeks showed a 53-fold increase. Apparent ultrastructural changes in thin sections of the MF-2 cells were observed after growth in ML236B: dilated cisternae in the rough endoplasmic reticulum had or did not have flocculated contents; there was significant distension of perinuclear space; and vesicular inclusion bodies were present in nuclei.", 
    "9": "Three actinomycetes having capability of 3 beta-hydroxylation of ML-236B were isolated from soil samples collected in Australia. Strain SANK 62781 was identified as Nocardia autotrophica. Strain SANK 62881 and strain SANK 62981 were identified as new subspecies of N. autotrophica for which the name N. autotrophica subsp. canberrica and N. autotrophica subsp. amethystina are proposed, respectively. The type strains of N. autotrophica subsp. canberrica and N. autotrophica subsp. amethystina are ATCC 35203 and ATCC 35204.", 
    "10": "Liver cholesterogenesis in rats was measured by giving [l-14C]octanoate i.p.; 1 h later digitonin-precipitable sterols were isolated and counted. In rats fed normal chow and given 7 daily p.o. doses of compounds and then fasted, at 20 h after the last dose, clofibrate or bezafibrate had no effect at lower doses or inhibited incorporation at higher doses, while compactin or gemfibrozil caused increases; cholestyramine added to the diet also caused marked increases. When rats were fed chow containing 0.1% cholesterol and 5.5% peanut oil, again at 20 h following the last of 7 daily doses, gemfibrozil caused increases of incorporation which diminished at higher levels of dosage, while clofibrate caused only inhibition. A single dose of gemfibrozil caused inhibition at 3 h postdose followed by increases over control at 36 and 48 h; a single dose of compactin caused inhibition at 3 h but not subsequent increase, and a single dose of clofibrate had no effect over the entire period. In rats fed chow containing 1.5% cholesterol and 5.5% peanut oil, gemfibrozil given orally or cholestyramine in the diet prevented the diet-induced decreases of plasma HDL cholesterol and increases of liver cholesterol content, while bezafibrate treatment did not have those effects. The effects of cholestyramine rapidly disappeared when it was withdrawn from the diet, while the effects of gemfibrozil persisted after dosage was stopped. These results suggest that some of the actions of gemfibrozil on rat sterol metabolism are quantitatively different from those of the other agents tested.", 
    "11": "The relationships between cholesterogenesis and cell division were studied by using two inhibitors of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity--25-hydroxycholesterol and compactin. The effects of both compounds on DNA synthesis were compared in synchronized rat fibroblasts cultured in a cholesterol-containing medium. Compactin did not inhibit DNA synthesis, except after a long time of contact and at high and almost cytotoxic concentrations. 25-Hydroxycholesterol inhibited DNA synthesis (without cytotoxic effects) after only 9-16 h of contact, depending on the phase of the cell cycle at which this compound was added to the culture medium. Sensitivity of cells to 25-hydroxycholesterol was maximal at the end of the S phase/beginning of the G2M phase. The rapid effect of 25-hydroxycholesterol on DNA synthesis appears to be separate from the inhibitory effect on sterol or non-sterol mevalonate-derived compound synthesis. Indeed, under our experimental conditions, the suppression of cholesterol biosynthesis is compensated by the presence of cholesterol in the culture medium, as demonstrated by the lack of effect of compactin on DNA synthesis; moreover, addition of mevalonolactone to the culture medium did not reverse the effect of 25-hydroxycholesterol. 25-Hydroxycholesterol could inhibit DNA synthesis by a direct action on the nucleus, after transfer by the intermediary of a specific hydroxysterol-binding protein.", 
    "12": "A marked reduction of serum cholesterol was obtained by treatment with probucol in heterozygous as well as in homozygous cases of familial hypercholesterolemia. A strict dietary regimen (low-fat, low-calories) intensified the hypocholesterolemic effect of the drug. The drug was also useful in diminishing the rebound of serum cholesterol after plasma exchange. Probucol reduced serum triglycerides in heterozygous cases of familial hypercholesterolemia, but there was a slight increase in triglycerides in homozygous cases. Treatment with probucol resulted in the regression of cutaneous and tendon xanthomas. Although it caused a decrease in HDL, it seems to be very effective in the treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "13": "Mevinolin is demonstrated to inhibit the degradation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Evidence is presented that this effect of mevinolin is not general to degradation of total cellular proteins and is not due to the block to mevalonate synthesis produced by this compound.", 
    "14": "We used an established Drosophila cell line (Kc cells), which neither synthesized nor required cholesterol for growth, to determine if sterol and nonsterol modulators of vertebrate 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity were also active in this biological system. Drosophila HMG-CoA reductase was membrane-bound and required NADPH for catalysis. In contrast to the vertebrate enzyme, Kc cell HMG-CoA reductase activity was not modulated by cholesterol (10 micrograms/ml), human low density lipoprotein (83 micrograms of cholesterol/ml), or oxygenated sterols (5-10 micrograms/ml). However, mevalonate caused a rapid strong suppression of Kc HMG-CoA reductase activity; 18 microM R-mevalonate produced 50% suppression of the enzyme within 24 h. Compactin, a competitive inhibitor, decreased HMG-CoA reductase activity in Drosophila embryo cell-free extracts with an apparent Ki of 1.0 nM. Kc cells, grown in the presence of compactin, had a HMG-CoA reductase specific activity 5- to 10-fold higher than untreated cells. Mevalonate blocked this increase. We have concluded that HMG-CoA reductase activity in Kc cells is (a) not responsive to feedback inhibition by sterols, and (b) is controlled by a fundamental sterol-independent regulatory process. The signal for modulation of HMG-CoA reductase activity may be mevalonate and/or its magnitude conversion to a nonsterol isopentenoid precursor and/or end product. These observations may have broader validity, not only for other insect cells, but for eukaryotic cells in general.", 
    "15": "32P-labeled cDNA probes were used to study levels of genomic DNA and regulation of mRNA for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase in UT-1 cells, a clone of compactin-resistant Chinese hamster ovary cells that have a 100-1000-fold increase in the amount of reductase protein. Similar measurements were made for the 53-kDa protein, a cytosolic protein of unknown function that is also expressed at high levels in UT-1 cells. The number of copies of the gene for reductase was increased by 15-fold in UT-1 cells as compared to the parental Chinese hamster ovary cells, as judged from Southern gel analysis of restriction endonuclease-digested genomic DNA. In contrast, there was no detectable increase in the number of gene copies for the 53-kDa protein. The amount of cytoplasmic mRNA for both proteins was markedly elevated in UT-1 cells, as determined by filter hybridization studies using 32P-labeled cDNA probes. The amount of mRNA for both reductase and the 53-kDa protein declined in parallel after addition of low density lipoprotein, 25-hydroxycholesterol, or mevalonate to the culture medium. The decline in reductase mRNA was associated with a marked decrease in the rate of [3H]uridine incorporation into hybridizable cytoplasmic mRNA. When UT-1 cells were grown for 3-4 months in the absence of compactin, the level of reductase mRNA and enzymatic activity decreased markedly, but the number of copies of the reductase gene did not decline. When the compactin-withdrawn cells were rechallenged with compactin, high levels of reductase mRNA and enzymatic activity promptly returned. We conclude that the gene for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, but not for the 53-kDa protein, has been stably amplified in UT-1 cells. Despite this differential gene amplification, the levels of cytoplasmic mRNA for both gene products are markedly elevated, and both are reduced in parallel by either sterols (low density lipoprotein-cholesterol or 25-hydroxycholesterol) or mevalonate, the product of the reductase-catalyzed reaction.", 
    "16": "Rat hepatocytes isolated by the procedure described here showed 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity in the range of that reported for rat liver at the maximum of the circadian cycle, even if they were taken from rats at the time of the minimum. The enzyme was present in cells as both its active dephosphorylated (20 +/- 8%) and the inactive phosphorylated forms. The enzyme activity and the ratio between the two forms were unaltered during 3 h of cell incubation. 25-Hydroxycholesterol (50 microM) induced about 50% inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase activity during 1 h incubation but the relative amount of the two forms was not modified by the sterol. Cells isolated by the described procedure may therefore be a useful tool in studies on the regulation of cholesterol neogenesis, both through the synthesis of the enzyme, which can be shown by measuring the activity after complete dephosphorylation of the enzyme, and via the rapid reversible shift of the inactive to the active form, resulting from the ratio between the two enzyme forms. The latter mechanism for the modulation of cholesterol synthesis cannot be tested in cell cultures because full activation of the enzyme occurs during hepatocyte plating.", 
    "17": "Various microorganisms were tested for capability to hydroxylate of ML-236B at the 3 beta-position. As the result, it was found that this ability was limited to a small group of microorganisms, mainly Zygomycetes in fungi, and Nocardia in actinomycetes.", 
    "18": "Incubation of the four purified HMG-CoA reductase phosphatases with the sodium salts of eleven polycarboxylic acids at concentrations of 40 mM, inactivated the enzymes to different degrees depending on the structure of the carboxylic acids. Maleate, malonate, oxalate, citrate, and hydroxymethylglutarate produced full inactivation at the concentration tested. When the four phosphatases were incubated with these acids, a concentration-dependent inactivation was observed. Fumarate, the trans isomer of maleate, produced little inactivation of the four phosphatases. Mevalonate did not inactivate at all. A relationship between those concentrations of acid that produced a 50% inactivation and the logarithm of the stability constant of Mg2+ or Mn2+ salts of polycarboxylic acids was observed. When reductase phosphatases were incubated with mixtures of polycarboxylic sodium salts and Mg2+ or Mn2+, an increase in the molar ratio divalent cation/carboxylic acid determined an increase in the four reductase phosphatase activities. The inactivating effect of citrate was on the phosphatases (high and low forms) and not on the substrates (HMG-CoA reductase, phosphorylase, and glycogen synthase). Reactivation of the citrate-inactivated phosphatases by Mn2+ and Mg2+ depended on the phosphorylated substrates, Mn2+ being the better activator. It is concluded that HMG-CoA reductase phosphatases are metalloenzymes.", 
    "19": "In subject with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a 50% deficiency of receptors for plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) impairs the removal of LDL from plasma and produces hypercholesterolemia. In these patients mevinolin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, blocks cholesterol synthesis and lowers plasma LDL levels. To determine the mechanism for the LDL-lowering effect, we administered 131I-labeled LDL intravenously to six FH heterozygotes before and during treatment with mevinolin and calculated the apparent fractional catabolic rate (FCR) and synthetic rate for LDL. After mevinolin treatment, the mean plasma LDL-cholesterol level declined from 262 to 191 mg/dl (27% decrease), the mean FCR for 131I-labeled LDL increased from 0.30 to 0.41 pools per day (37% increase), and the mean calculated synthetic rate for LDL-protein did not change significantly. In one of FH heterozygote with an ileal bypass and in another who received colestipol, the addition of mevinolin caused, respectively, a 41% and 60% decrease in plasma LDL levels and a 60% and 100% increase in the FCR for plasma LDL. The contribution of receptor-dependent pathways to the FCR for plasma LDL was estimated in three FH heterozygotes by simultaneous measurements of the FCR for native 131I-labeled LDL and 125I-labeled glucosylated LDL, which does not bind to LDL receptors. Whereas the removal rate for native LDL increased after mevinolin treatment, the removal rate for glucosylated LDL did not change. The current data suggest that mevinolin alone or mevinolin plus bile acid depletion (i.e., ileal bypass or colestipol therapy) decreases plasma LDL levels primarily by raising the number of LDL receptors and, thus, enhancing the removal of LDL from plasma.", 
    "20": "The effect of growth factors such as fibroblast growth factor on the production of a basement lamina by cultured endothelial cells has been investigated. The ability of these cells to grow and differentiate properly correlated with their ability to produce a basement lamina. The effect of such a substrate on the growth, differentiation, and aging of cells in vitro, as well as its use for the long-term culture of either normal diploid cells or tumor cells, is reviewed.", 
    "21": "Diets high in carbohydrate and low in fat led to a decrease in the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase in livers of healthy, reverse light-cycled rats. The effect on reductase was due both to a decline in expressed enzyme activity and to a decrease in total number of enzyme molecules. Inhibition of reductase activity was paralleled by a fall in hepatic cholesterolgenesis and by an increase in triglyceride formation. Thus, a reduction in endogenous cholesterol synthesis may explain the serum cholesterol-lowering effect of high carbohydrate, low fat diets in man.", 
    "22": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl(HMG)-coenzyme A reductase purified from rat liver in the absence of protease inhibitors is composed of two distinct polypeptides of Mr = 51,000 and 52,500. Antibody raised to enzyme purified from rats fed a diet supplemented with cholestyramine and mevinolin inactivated HMG-CoA reductase. The antibody specifically precipitated a polypeptide of Mr = 94,000 from rat liver cells that had been previously incubated with [35S]methionine. The immunoprecipitation of the 35S-labeled polypeptide of Mr = 94,000 was prevented by addition of unlabeled pure HMG-CoA reductase (Mr = 51,000 and 52,500). Incubation of rat liver cells with mevalonolactone resulted in a decreased activity of HMG-CoA reductase and in a 40% decrease in the rate of incorporation of [35S]methionine into the immunoprecipitable reductase polypeptide of Mr = 94,000. In pulse-chase experiments, mevalonolactone enhanced the rate of degradation of the Mr = 94,000 polypeptide 3-fold. We propose that endogenous microsomal HMG-CoA reductase has a subunit of Mr = 94,000 and that the synthesis and degradation of this polypeptide are regulated by either mevalonolactone or, more likely, a product of mevalonolactone metabolism.", 
    "23": "A growing body of evidence indicates that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (EC 1.1.1.34, reductase) is degraded by proteolytic enzymes during solubilization by traditional freeze-thaw techniques. We have solubilized reductase in an active, stable form with nonionic detergents [Lubrol WX or poly(oxyethylene) ether type W-1]. Solubilization proceeded in high (greater than 70%) yield in the presence of the proteolytic inhibitors leupeptin, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,-N',N'-tetraacetic acid and was independent of prior freeze-thawing of the microsomes. We have purified detergent-solubilized reductase 40-fold in high yield by means of sucrose density gradient centrifugation and dye-ligand chromatography. Detergent-solubilized reductase is heat labile, unlike reductase solubilized by the freeze-thaw method. Detergent-solubilized reductase can be inactivated up to 90% by use of reductase kinase. This inactivation requires both adenosine 5'-triphosphate and adenosine 5'-diphosphate, as has been previously observed for both microsomal and freeze-thaw solubilized reductase. Inactivation is reversed by subsequent treatment with a phosphoprotein phosphatase.", 
    "24": "Hydroxymethyl glutaryl Co A reductase (HMG Co A reductase) is the key regulatory enzyme in the conversion of acetate to mevalonate. Mevalonate is the precursor for sterol and non-sterol isoprenes involved in membrane biogenesis, DNA replication and protein glycosylation. The influence of two inhibitors of HMG Co A reductase, Compactin (or ML236B) and an oxygenated sterol, Diosgenin, were tested on preimplantation development of mouse embryos. Compactin arrested development at about the 32-cell stage, leaving the blastomeres decompacted. Ultrastructural examination of the embryos revealed reduced membrane apposition but no major effects on cell organelles. There was however a predominance of nuclei with highly condensed chromatin. Glycosylation of proteins also appeared to be inhibited as shown by reduced incorporation of sugar precursors but not that of amino acids. The influence of Compactin was judged to be highly specific since only 10 micrograms/ml (0.08 mM) mevalonic acid abolished the effects of Compactin. Mevalonate in embryos may not be primarily utilized in the synthesis of sterols since a specific inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis, DL-4,4,10-beta-trimethyl-trans-decal-3-beta-ol had no detectable effect on development. The non-sterol isoprenes of mevalonate such as dolichol and isopentenyl adenine may play a more significant role during early development since the influence of Compactin resembled that previously described using tunicamycin, a specific inhibitor of dolichol mediated synthesis of N-glycosidically linked glycoproteins. Hence, lack of dolichol may partly be the cause of arrest of embryonic development by Compactin. Diosgenin caused embryonic arrest at about the 16-cell stage and the influence was not reversible by mevalonic acid. Cholesterol was able to rescue 50% of the embryos but the effect of Diosgenin could be non-specific and probably caused by its entry into the plasma membrane.", 
    "25": "Different concentrations of polar fractions, methanol-soluble (MESF), or water-soluble (WASF), of 1-8% equivalent to fresh garlic paste were added to yellow corn-soybean based diets and fed to 5-week-old male broiler chickens for 3 weeks to measure the inhibition of hepatic beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (7 alpha-hydroxy) and fatty acid synthetase (FAS). Dose-related decreases in the activities of these enzymes were obtained. Decreases in serum total cholesterol and in low density lipoprotein (LDL) levels were also observed. There was no effect on the level of cholesterol in high density lipoprotein (HDL). The most effective dose for these decreases was found 0.54% (MESF) and 1.2% (WASF) equivalent to 6% of the fresh garlic. The inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase and FAS by 25-300 micrograms of MESF or WASF for 15 min was tested in vitro, in male and female chicken hepatocytes. Inhibitions of activity were dose-dependent and the degree of inhibition increased with duration of incubation (150 micrograms of MESF or WASF 5 to 60 min). Dietary supplementation of odorless WASF of garlic was found to be very effective in lowering the total and LDL cholesterol levels compared to control chickens.", 
    "26": "The ability of cultured hepatocytes to maintain a constant rate of bile acid synthesis and secretion in a chemically defined serum-free culture medium allowed us to examine the direct effects of bile acids on their synthesis. Mass quantitation of bile acids by gas liquid chromatography showed that adding taurochenodeoxycholate at concentrations which were from 2 to 20 times the concentration of bile acids found in rat portal blood increased rather than decreased the secretion of cholic acid. Using a more direct approach to measure relative rates of bile acid synthesis and secretion, we determined the rate of de novo 14C-bile acid synthesis. Adding taurocholate at concentrations ranging from 2 to 60 times the concentration found in rat portal blood did not inhibit 14C-bile acid synthesis. Furthermore, free and conjugated di- and tri-hydroxy bile acids did not inhibit bile acid synthesis. In contrast, mevinolin, a potent inhibitor of cholesterol biosynthesis, inhibited 14C-bile acid synthesis by 63%. Since previous demonstration of bile acid negative feedback regulation was achieved in vivo by infusing taurocholate into the intestines of bile-diverted rats, we examined the possibility that bile acid synthesis must be induced in order for bile acids to inhibit their synthesis. Hepatocytes obtained from bile-diverted rats exhibited a 5-fold increase in the synthesis and secretion of 14C-bile acids. However, taurocholate did not inhibit bile acid synthesis by cells from bile-diverted rats. These data show that bile acids do not interact directly with the hepatocyte to inhibit their synthesis.", 
    "27": "ML-236B is a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, the key regulatory enzyme in the sequence that catalyzes the conversion of acetate to mevalonic acid in cholesterol biosynthesis. This compound caused marked inhibition of human bone marrow granulocyte progenitor cell (CFU-C) proliferation, the 50% inhibitory concentration (IHD50) being 2.0 X 10(6)M. Inhibition of colony formation was reversed by mevalonic acid but not by cholesterol. ML-236B also inhibited DNA synthesis and acetate incorporation into cholesterol in marrow mononuclear cells (IHD50 = 5.6 x 10(6)M and 3.2 x 10(7)M, respectively). No inhibition of mevalonate incorporation into cholesterol was observed. These results differ from those observed with 25-hydroxycholesterol, another inhibitor of HMG CoA reductase. The latter compound also inhibited CFU-C proliferation and cholesterol biosynthesis from acetate; inhibition of colony formation was reversed by cholesterol but not by mevalonic acid. In addition, 25-hydroxycholesterol inhibited cholesterol synthesis from mevalonic acid precursor. We conclude that: (1) ML-236B is a potent inhibitor of CFU-C proliferation, DNA synthesis, and cholesterol biosynthesis from acetate precursor in marrow mononuclear cells; (2) the effects of ML-236B are completely reversed by mevalonic acid but not by cholesterol, suggesting that mevalonic acid per se or one or more of its nonsterol products are critical for cell growth; (3) the inhibitory effects of 25-hydroxycholesterol on CFU-C proliferation and cholesterol biosynthesis are not solely a result of its inhibition of HMG CoA reductase, but are due in part to inhibition of enzymatic steps distal to mevalonic acid in the sterol synthetic pathway; and (4) mevalonic acid and cholesterol are independent requirements for CFU-C proliferation and differentiation in vitro.", 
    "28": "Cell line C-4-1 which produces alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.1.4) of the placental type in response to glucocorticoids was grown in the presence of inhibitors of mevalonate formation for periods ranging from 1 to 4 days. When C-4-1 cells were incubated in the presence of 25-hydroxycholesterol (1 microM) or compactin (11.6 microM) the induction of alkaline phosphatase by 0.2 microM dexamethasone was suppressed. This suppression could be partially prevented by the addition of mevalonolactone to the growing culture. The reversal effect by mevalonate was most evident with compactin, a well known competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase. In contrast, the effect of tunicamycin which inhibits N-linked protein glycosylation and also prevents alkaline phosphatase induction by glucocorticoids could not be reversed by mevalonate. These results implicate mevalonate in alkaline phosphatase induction, possibly through its role as a precursor of dolichols.", 
    "29": "We studied the effects of the bile acid sequestrant cholestyramine, alone and in combination with the experimental agent compactin (ML-236B), a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, on serum levels of lipoproteins in 10 heterozygous patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. After cholestyramine treatment alone for 2 to 16 months, serum total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased by 20 and 28 per cent, respectively. With the addition of compactin for 12 weeks there was a 39 per cent total decrease in serum cholesterol from the control value--from 356 +/- 14 to 217 +/- 10 mg per deciliter (9.27 +/- 0.36 to 5.64 +/- 0.26 mmol per liter [mean +/- S.E.M.]; P less than 0.001)--and a 53 per cent decrease in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol--from 263 +/- 13 to 125 +/- 10 mg per deciliter (6.84 +/- 0.34 to 3.25 +/- 0.26 mmol per liter; P less than 0.001). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol, which had increased during cholestyramine treatment, remained at its higher level. No adverse effects were observed. If long-term safety can be demonstrated, the compactin-cholestyramine regimen may prove useful in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. prove useful in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "30": "1. Compactin, (-)-hydroxycitrate and dexamethasone gave rise to a decrease in the rate of cholesterol production in hepatocytes from fed rats by interfering with the flow of substrate into the sterol biosynthetic pathway. The cells responded to the deficit of biosynthetic sterol by increasing the activity of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMG-CoA reductase). 2. Compactin and (-)-hydroxycitrate gave similar results in hepatocytes from rats starved for 24 h but in this case dexamethasone had no significant effect. 3. Exogenous oleate interferes with the production of carbohydrate-derived acetyl-CoA and also gives rise initially to opposing effects on the rate of sterol synthesis and HMG-CoA reductase activity. Over a longer period, however, oleate itself was capable of replacing carbohydrate as the major source of carbon for sterol synthesis. 4. The increase in HMG-CoA reductase activity observed when liver cells were incubated in the presence of compactin, (-)-hydroxycitrate or oleate could be partially reversed by the simultaneous presence of glucagon. 5. Under some physiological conditions, a deficiency of biosynthetic cholesterol or of a related precursor may lead to an increase in the activity of HMG-CoA reductase.", 
    "31": "After incubation in the presence of tritiated water, incorporation of tritium into cholesterol and into different bile acids was several-fold higher using hepatocytes of cholestyramine-fed rats than that found using hepatocytes of control rats. Labeling of the trihydroxylated cholic and beta-muricholic acids was markedly greater than that of dihydroxycholanoic acid. The total amount of label in all bile acids was 30% or less of that in free cholesterol, in both types of hepatocytes. In combination with the data on bile acids mass production we could calculate the average number (N(a)) of tritium atoms incorporated per molecule of newly-formed bile acid. The experimental values of N(a) for cholic and beta-muricholic acid were compared with values of N(n) or N(o), theoretically predicted if these bile acids were derived entirely from newly made or pre-existent cholesterol, respectively. It was deduced for hepatocytes of cholestyramine-fed rats that the bile acids produced in the first hour of incubation should be totally derived from pre-existent cholesterol, whereas 50% and 25% of the cholic and beta-muricholic acid, respectively, produced during the second and third hours of incubation should be derived from newly synthesized cholesterol. The contribution of newly made cholesterol as substrate for bile acid production was also estimated by using ML-236B. In a concentration of 12 micro M, it depressed cholesterol synthesis by 90% during 1 or 3 hours of incubation of hepatocytes of cholestyramine-fed rats. Mass production of cholic acid was depressed by 25% and that of beta-muricholic acid was not inhibited at all by ML-236B during the first hour of incubation, while they were depressed by 71 and 52%, respectively, during the second plus third hours of incubation. It is concluded that 1) in isolated hepatocytes newly made cholesterol can be a significant substrate for bile acid formation; 2) there are separate cholesterol substrate pools for the productions of cholic or beta-muricholic acid; 3) of the total carbon flux directed into cholesterol synthesis, the major part ends up as free cholesterol and only a minor part as bile acids, even in hepatocytes with a derepressed bile acid production.-Kempen, H. J., M. Vos-van Holstein, and J. de Lange. Bile acids and lipids in isolated rat hepatocytes. II.

    "32": "We describe a cell line, designated C100, that displays a 100-fold increase in the major regulatory enzyme of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase [HMG-CoA; mevalonate:NADP(+) oxido-reductase (CoA-acylating), EC 1.1.1.34]. Immunoprecipitation of [(35)S]methionine-labeled enzyme from C100 microsomal membranes prepared in the presence of the protease inhibitors phenyl-methylsulfonyl fluoride and leupeptin revealed two up regulated proteins: a major band of M(r) 92,000 and a minor band of M(r) 63,000. We conclude that the M(r) 92,000 protein is probably the intact form of HMG-CoA reductase protomer based on the following criteria. (i) It is a highly up regulated microsomal membrane protein that coincides with the increase in HMG-CoA reductase specific activity in this cell line. (ii) It is recognized by a specific HMG-CoA reductase antiserum under a variety of stringencies. (iii) Isolation and solubilization of [(35)S]methionine-labeled C100 microsomal membranes in the absence of protease inhibitors resulted in the disappearance of the M(r) 92,000 protein and the appearance of two proteins of M(r) 52,000 and 38,000. (iv) Analysis of cells labeled for 30 min with [(35)S]methionine, well under the half-life of HMG-CoA reductase, revealed only the M(r) 92,000 protein to be present in total cell extract. (v) The previously reported single immunoprecipitation polypeptide for HMG-CoA reductase of M(r) 62,000 [Chin, D. J., Luskey, K. L., Anderson, R. G. W., Faust, J. R., Goldstein, J. L. & Brown, M. S. (1982) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 79, 1185-1189] can be isolated and appears to be the result of both proteolysis and sample preparation for NaDodSO(4) gel electrophoresis. Analysis of C100 cells labeled with [(35)S]methionine for 24 hr indicates that the predominant steady-state form of the enzyme is the M(r) 92,000, rather than the M(r) 63,000, protein, further suggesting that the two proteins do not have a classical precursor-product relationship.", 
    "33": "1) In kinetic studies, mevinolin proved to be a highly specific inhibitor of partially purified yeast HMG-CoA reductase (Ki = 3.5 nM towards HMG-CoA) and of microsomal HMG-CoA reductase from etiolated radish seedlings (Ki = 2.2 nM). At low concentrations of NADPH, the inhibitor counteracts the sigmoidal response of plant HMG-CoA reductase activity towards the cosubstrate. At higher concentrations of NADPH, the inhibition pattern is of non-competitive type. 2) Our results are extensively compared with that obtained by the use of animal tissue and yeast as an enzyme source in order to discuss model systems probably valid to evaluate properties and regulation of plant as well as yeast HMG-CoA reductase.", 
    "34": "Rat hepatic HMGCoA reductase was found to be at least 50% inhibited 17 hr after administration of a single oral dose of 3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexanyl mandelate (cyclandelate), a vasoactive substance. This inhibition was also found in rats given the 3,3,5-trimethylcyclohexanol component but only slight inhibition was seen after an equimolar dose of mandelate. The inhibition of HMGCoA was observed both around the high point and near the low point of the diurnal activity cycle. The effect did not persist to 41 hr after treatment. There was no direct inhibition of HMGCoA reductase by trimethylcyclohexanol when added to the assay system in vitro. The in vivo effect of these inhibitors was specific for HMGCoA reductase. There was no change, neither elevation nor depression, of the amount of microsomal membrane components cytochromes b5 and P-450, not was the activity of another microsomal enzyme, arylesterase, affected by dosing with cyclandelate or trimethylcyclohexanol.", 
    "35": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, the regulatory enzyme of cholesterol synthesis in liver, is bound to the microsomal fraction. Lipoprotein-bound cholesterol (from human serum) in vitro inhibits the microsomal bound 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase. The solubilized enzyme, however, is not inhibited. Immunotitration of the microsomal enzyme with a monospecific antibody reveals that the loss in enzyme activity caused by cholesterol corresponds well with the lowering of the equivalence points. In contrast, the equivalence points of the solubilized enzyme remain unchanged. This indicates that the inhibitory effect of cholesterol is restricted to the microsomal bound enzyme. In vivo different physiological conditions lead to relatively small changes in the cholesterol content in the microsomes while drastic changes in the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase are observed. When microsomes from these rats are incubated with exogenous cholesterol, the activity of the enzyme is always found to be decreased to the same extent independent of the physiological condition of the animals. The findings suggest that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase may be \"masked\" by a cholesterol-mediated modification of the microsomal membrane.", 
    "36": "The relation of cellular cholesterol content of a biochemical expression of oligodendroglial differentiation was studied in cultured C-6 glial cells. Induction of the oligodendroglial marker enzyme 2':3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphohydrolase (CNP) was determined after alteration of the sterol content of cellular membranes by exposure to compactin, a specific inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and cholesterol synthesis. The sterol content and, as a consequence, the sterol/phospholipid molar ratio of C-6 glial cells were decreased by treating the cells, in 10% lipoprotein-poor serum, with various concentrations of compactin for 24 h. The degrees of sterol depletion thus produced were maintained for 48 h after removal of the compactin if the cells were maintained in serum-free medium, the culture conditions necessary for induction of CNF in untreated cells. Forty-eight hours after removal of serum, no induction of CNP occurred in cells previously treated with 0.5 micrograms/ml of compactin, whereas untreated cells exhibited a three- to fourfold increase in CNP activity. Intermediate degree of sterol depletion resulted in intermediate degrees of inhibition of the CNP induction. Moreover, the morphological expressions of glial differentiation observed in the untreated cells did not occur in the sterol-depleted cells. That the effect of compactin on the induction of CNP relates to depletion of sterol was indicated by the finding that when low-density lipoprotein was added to the compactin-treated cells, the induction of CNP, the morphological expressions of differentiation, and the sterol/phospholipid molar ratios were preserved. The degree of sterol depletion that totally prevented the induction of CNP had no effect on (Na+ R K+)-activated ATPase activity, total protein synthesis, and cell viability. The data define a critical role for sterol in oligodendroglial differentiation in this model system.", 
    "37": "The current results show that one can exploit the normal regulation of receptor synthesis to stimulate the single normal gene in FH heterozygotes to produce an increased number of LDL receptors. This stimulation can be achieved by drugs that inhibit HMG CoA reductase in the liver and by maneuvers that cause bile acid depletion. These two therapeutic approaches are most effective when they are combined. It seems reasonable to speculate that such a profound lowering of plasma cholesterol levels will minimize the development of atherosclerosis in FH heterozygotes. In a broader sense, the success of this regulatory manipulation raises the possibility that other genetic diseases may be treated through manipulation of regulatory signals that control the rates of synthesis of gene products.",

Significantly higher levels of the two catabolites were observed in the first two weeks of life of the pre-term newborns. A peak of excretion of both ketone bodies and HMG was found between the 7th and the 10th day after birth in both groups of newborns. After the 3rd month there is no significant difference between full-term and pre-term children as far as the excretion of the two analytes is concerned.", 
    "39": "A new assay has been developed for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase, the final enzyme in the leucine degradative pathway. The assay was performed by incubating lysates of fibroblasts with [glutaryl-3-14C](D,L)-3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A. The products were analysed by high performance liquid chromatography with continuous liquid scintillation counting. This provided simultaneous identification and quantification of one of the enzymatic products, [3-14C]acetoacetic acid. The mean 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase activity in fibroblasts from five controls was 732 +/- 81 (SD) pmol/min X mg protein. Using this assay, we have studied skin fibroblasts cultured from a patient with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric aciduria and found 3% of normal 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase activity. The activities in skin fibroblasts cultured from the parents were 46 and 53% of control activity which is consistent with heterozygocity. Kinetic studies of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase in skin fibroblasts cultured from two normal subjects yielded Km values of 14.4 and 18.8 mumol/l for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA.", 
    "40": "Detailed studies of apolipoprotein E (apoE)-containing lipoproteins in abetalipoproteinemia have been performed in an attempt to resolve the apparent paradox of a suppressed low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor pathway in the absence of apoB-containing lipoproteins. It was hypothesized that apoE-containing high density lipoproteins (HDL) in abetalipoproteinemia might functionally substitute for LDL in regulation of cholesterol metabolism in these patients. The mean (+/-standard deviation) plasma concentration of apoE in nine patients with abetalipoproteinemia was 44.8+/-8.2 mug/ml, slightly higher than the corresponding value for a group of 50 normal volunteers, 36.3+/-11 mug/ml. Fractionation of plasma lipoproteins by agarose column chromatography or by ultracentrifugation indicated that in abetalipoproteinemia, plasma apoE was restricted to a subfraction of HDL. This was in contrast to the results obtained with plasma from 30 normal volunteers, in whom apoE was distributed between very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and HDL. Consequently, the mean apoE content of HDL in abetalipoproteinemia (44.8 mug/ml) was more than twice that found in the normal volunteers (20.3 mug/ml).ApoE-rich and apoE-poor subfractions of HDL(2) were isolated by heparin-agarose affinity chromatography. ApoE comprised a mean of 81% of the protein mass of the apoE-rich subfraction. Compared with the apoE-poor subfraction, the apoE-rich HDL(2) was of larger mean particle diameter (141+/-7 vs. 115+/-15 A) and had a higher ratio of total cholesterol/protein (1.01+/-0.11 vs. 0.63+/-0.14). Plasma and HDL fractions from three patients were studied with respect to their ability to compete with (125)I-LDL in specific binding to receptors on cultured human fibroblasts. The binding activity of plasma from patients (per milligram of protein) was about half that of plasma from normal volunteers. All binding activity in the patients' plasma was found to reside in the HDL fraction. The binding activity of the patients' HDL (on a total protein basis) was intermediate between that of normal HDL and normal LDL. However, the large differences in binding between patients' HDL and normal HDL entirely disappeared when data were expressed in terms of the apoE content of these lipoproteins. This suggested that the binding activity was restricted to that subfraction of HDL particles that contain apoE. These apoE-rich HDL particles had calculated binding potencies per milligram of protein 10-25 times that of normal LDL. Direct binding studies using (125)I-apoE-rich HDL(2) and (125)I-apoE-poor HDL(2), confirmed the suggestion that binding is restricted to the subfraction of HDL particles containing apoE. The apoE-rich HDL(2) were found to be very potent inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity in cultured fibroblasts, providing direct evidence of the ability of these lipoproteins to regulate cholesterol metabolism. On the basis of binding potencies of apoE-rich HDL, apoE concentrations, and the composition of apoE-rich HDL, it could be calculated that apoE-rich HDL in abetalipoproteinemia have a capacity to deliver cholesterol to tissues via the LDL receptor pathway equivalent to an LDL concentration of 50-150 mg/dl of cholesterol. Thus, these apoE-rich lipoproteins are capable of producing the suppression of cholesterol synthesis and LDL receptor activity previously observed in abetalipoproteinemia.", 
    "41": "Incubation of rat hepatocytes with oleate for a period of 1 h gave rise to a decrease in the total (esterified plus unesterified) cholesterol associated with very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). This effect was no longer apparent after longer incubation periods. The rate of cholesterol biosynthesis decreased during the first hour of incubation in the presence of oleate. After longer incubation periods, however, more cholesterol was synthesised in the presence of oleate than in its absence. The extracellular presence of oleate gave rise to a 2-fold increase in the concentration of cellular cholesteryl ester. Under these conditions cholesteryl ester contributed a larger proportion of the total cholesterol secreted with the VLDL. The cholesteryl ester associated with VLDL was derived predominantly from cholesteryl ester synthesised intracellularly. Inhibition of cholesterol synthesis with compactin did not significantly alter the rate of secretion of VLDL-cholesterol. Newly synthesised non-esterified cholesterol equilibrated with the bulk of pre-existing cellular cholesterol before secretion with the VLDL. This was true irrespective of the rate of endogenous cholesterol synthesis.", 
    "42": "A fungal metabolite, ML236B (Compactin), isolated from Penicillium citrinum, is a specific inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-coenzyme A reductase (EC 1.1.1.34). Three ML236B-resistant (ML236Br) mutants, MF-1, MF-2, and MF-3, were isolated from V79 after N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine mutagenesis. The fluctuation test showed 2.2 X 10(-6) mutants per cell per generation of a spontaneous mutation frequency of ML236Br clones. These ML236Br clones showed a four- to fivefold-higher resistance to the drug than did their parental V79. Radioactive acetate, but not mevalonate, incorporation into the sterol fraction increased about 10-fold in ML236Br clones in comparison with that in V79. The cellular level of HMG-coenzyme A reductase in three ML236Br mutants was found to be a few-fold higher than that of V79 when cultured in the presence of lipoproteins. The 125I-labeled low-density lipoprotein-binding assay showed binding activity in three ML236Br clones comparable to that of the parental V79 cells. By contrast, an internalization assay of 125I-labeled low-density lipoprotein into the cells showed significantly reduced activity in three ML236Br clones in comparison with V79.", 
    "43": "We used two model systems to investigate the effect of compactin, a competitive inhibitor of beta-hydroxy beta-methylglutarylcoenzyme A reductase, on the shape of Swiss 3T3 cells. We maintained cells in a quiescent state in medium deficient in platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), or we added PDGF to quiescent cells to initiate traverse through a single cell cycle. In both systems, the cells responded to compactin by acquiring a characteristic rounded shape. Cell rounding seemed to depend on an induced deficiency of mevalonic acid (MVA) since the response could be prevented or reversed by adding MVA to the culture medium. Compactin-induced rounding appeared in PDGF-stimulated cells concomitantly with a compactin-mediated inhibition of DNA synthesis, and both effects had similar sensitivities to exogenous compactin and MVA. However, cell rounding seemed to be unrelated to other, previously observed effects of MVA deficiency. Compactin did not influence the total content of cell cholesterol, and little cholesterol was formed when we added radioactive MVA to round cells to effect shape change reversal. Measurement of the dolichol-dependent glycosylation of cell protein revealed no evidence of dolichol deficiency. In addition, reversal of cell rounding by MVA was not prevented by concentrations of tunicamycin that effectively blocked the incorporation of radioactive mannose into cell protein or by concentrations of cycloheximide that blocked protein synthesis. Taken together, our results suggest a new role for MVA or its products in the maintenance of cell shape.", 
    "44": "Two brothers, aged 7 and 5 years, who excreted large amounts of the leucine metabolites 3-methylglutaconic acid, 3-methylglutaric acid, and 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid, are described. The excretion of these metabolites could be enhanced by increasing the leucine intake. Restriction of the protein intake resulted in a marked reduction of the metabolite excretion. However, the excretion of the ultimate leucine metabolite, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid, remained unchanged at a low level. The only clinical abnormality was speech retardation. A (partial) deficiency of 3-methylglutaconyl coenzyme A hydratase is proposed to be the most likely underlying defect.", 
    "45": "A proprietary mixture of pure cyclic monoterpenes (Rowachol) inhibited hepatic HMGCoA reductase by 50-60% when measured 17 hr after the oral administration of a single dose to rats. The extent of this inhibition was independent of the normal activity range of HMGCoA reductase within its diurnal cycle and the same inhibition (65%) was found in 24 hr starved animals where the control reductase activity was less than 20% that of normal fed rats. De novo sterol and fatty acid synthesis in intact, fed rats was measured by incorporation of 3H from injected H2O. In rats treated with Rowachol the rate of sterol synthesis in vivo was inhibited 52% in liver and 44% in testis with no significant effects in other tissues. The synthesis of non sterol (isoprenoid) compounds in testis was unaffected and the inhibition of sterol synthesis in this tissue probably reflects decreased acquisition of newly synthesized material from liver rather than any effect on the endogenous process. In the same animals the rate of fatty acid synthesis was inhibited 55% in liver. These effects were associated with a significant depletion of liver glycogen which may account for the reduction in rate of fatty acid synthesis. We conclude that the reported cholelitholytic action of monoterpenes is associated with the physiological inhibition of hepatic sterol synthesis mediated by decrease HMGCoA reductase activity.", 
    "46": "The effects of highly purified preparations of cathepsine D from human liver, spleen and some tumours on synthetic hexa- and heptapeptides were studied. The cathepsins were obtained by repeated chromatography on pepstatin-Sepharose with subsequent gel filtration through Sephadex G-100. The peptides tested were structural analogs of pepstatin, a natural inhibitor of carboxylic proteinases. In these analogs the amino acid statin essential for the inhibitory action was substituted for the residues of natural amino acids serine, threonine and glycine. It was shown that the peptides Ac-Val-Leu-Ser-Leu-Thr, Ac-Val-Val-Ser-Leu-Leu-Ser and Ac-Val-Val-Gly-Leu-Leu-Ser are appropriate substrates for cathepsins D. When leucine was substituted for isoleucine, the peptides were virtually resistant to the action of cathepsins D. The cathepsins from normal liver and spleen hydrolyzed only the peptide bonds formed by leucine. Cathepsins from malignant tumours exhibited a broader specificity in comparison with those from normal tissues, producing slight hydrolysis of other bonds.", 
    "47": "Rats were fed powdered rat chow or a rat chow diet containing 5% cholestyramine or 5% cholestyramine with Mevinolin (112 mg/100 g food, 200 mg/kg body weight per day). The specific activity of hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase was determined at different times during the diurnal cycle of the enzyme. Animals fed cholestyramine had higher specific activities of HMG-CoA reductase at all time points tested when compared to controls. The specific activity at the peak in the diurnal cycle was approximately 8-fold higher in cholestyramine-treated animals. Rats administered the cholestyramine-Mevinolin diet had higher specific activities of the enzyme than either cholestyramine-treated or control animals. In the cholestyramine-Mevinolin-treated animals the peak in the diurnal cycle was shifted to D-12 (12th hour of the dark cycle) and the specific activity at this point was approximately 133-fold greater than the basal (L-6) activity in control animals. Optimal conditions for immunotitration studies were determined such that valid conclusions could be drawn from these data. Based on immunotitration experiments, the increased hepatic HMG-CoA reductase activity in cholestyramine-treated animals resulted in part from a 3-fold activation of the enzyme, while the increased specific activity in the cholestyramine-Mevinolin-treated animals was due solely to increased enzyme mass. Hence the administration of Mevinolin blocked the activation of the enzyme induced by feeding cholestyramine alone. This was confirmed by purifying the enzyme to apparent homogeneity from cholestyramine-Mevinolin-treated animals; the specific activity of this enzyme was 4,000-7,700 nmol NADPH oxidized/min per mg protein. Cholestyramine-Mevinolin treatment affords a novel system for generating milligram quantities of rat hepatic HMG-CoA reductase.-Tanaka, R. D., P. A. Edwards, S. Lan, E. M. Kn\u00f6ppel, and A. M.

HMG and beta-HB uptake show a Na+ gradient-induced overshoot, suggesting luminal cotransport of these organic acids. Kinetic analysis of HMG and beta-HB uptake revealed a single component carrier system and a diffusional component for each compound. Vesicles from starved rats exhibit the same transport characteristics as those from normal rats. The transport interactions of other organic acids with HMG were examined and revealed that citrate is a competitive inhibitor, which implies that the compounds share a common organic acid carrier.", 
    "49": "Mevinolin, a fungal metabolite isolated from cultures of Aspergillus terreus, is a potent competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase, the rate-controlling enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. In the current studies we demonstrate that mevinolin significantly lowers serum cholesterol in rabbits fed a cholesterol free, low-fat semi-synthetic diet. Rabbits maintained on this diet developed endogenous hypercholesterolemia with average cholesterol concentrations of 310 mg/dl over a 66-day period. Treatment with mevinolin for 39 days at a dose of 2 mg/kg per day lowered serum cholesterol levels by an average of 37% (P less than 0.05), while a dose of 6 mg/kg per day resulted in a 48% (P less than 0.05) decrease when compared with the control group. When the administration of mevinolin was discontinued, serum cholesterol levels of the 6 mg/kg per day group increased significantly to a maximum post-treatment value of 319 mg/dl (P less than 0.0001). The results of this study demonstrate that rabbits with endogenous hypercholesterolemia are a useful animal model for the study of cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitors like mevinolin.", 
    "50": "Assay of HMG-CoA reductase kinase activity requires HMG-CoA reductase (reductase, E.C. 1.1.1.34) free of associated reductase kinase. Microsomal reductase insensitive to inactivation by Mg-nucleotides alone may be prepared by heating microsomes at 50 degrees C for 15 min. The reductase in these microsomes may subsequently be inactivated by Mg-nucleotides only after addition of reductase kinase. Inactivation is a linear function of time and of cytosol protein concentration and may be reversed by treatment with a phosphoprotein phosphatase. The extent of inactivation observed under standard conditions provides an assay for reductase kinase activity. Factors present in cytosol that hinder measurement of either reductase or reductase kinase activity must be removed or inhibited. Reductase phosphatase is inhibited by 50 mM NaF. Reductase kinase kinase activity is not expressed under the assay conditions used. Mg-Nucleotide-independent inhibitors of reductase activity are removed by chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel or Blue Sepharose. Mevalonate kinase and reductase kinase are separable by chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel or Sephadex G-200. We describe a rapid chromatographic procedure for separating reductase kinase of crude fractions from mevalonate kinase and from Mg-nucleotide-independent inhibitors of reductase activity. The 1.0 M KCl eluate from DEAE-Sephacel contains all of the cytosol reductase kinase activity. This method is applicable to measurement of reductase kinase activity in cytosol or more purified fractions.", 
    "51": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid (HMGA) is a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCoAR) and strongly reduces cholesterol biosynthesis both in vitro and in vivo. Since the effects of this compound on biliary lipid composition are hitherto unknown, we have investigated whether it prevents dietary cholesterol induction of saturated bile in the hamster. Female Golden Syrian hamsters have been divided into four groups and treated for 10 weeks as follows: I) Standard diet, containing 0.8 mg cholesterol/g food; II) Standard diet plus HMGA (100 mg/kg b.w./day per os); III) Lithogenic diet containing 2.4 mg cholesterol/g food; IV) Lithogenic diet plus HMGA as above. The results indicate that HMGA is effective in reducing both bile cholesterol supersaturation and hypercholesterolemia. Inhibition of hepatic cholesterogenesis at the level of mevalonate synthesis by HMGCoAR and reduction of intestinal cholesterol absorption may be responsible for these effects.", 
    "52": "A discriminating system capable of recognizing the oxygenated sterols was investigated in human lymphocytes. After labelling entire cells with 25-hydroxy [3H] cholesterol (10 nM) the cytosol was ultracentrifuged on a linear sucrose density gradient. Bound 25-hydroxy [3H] cholesterol was located in a single peak with a sedimentation coefficient of 8.3 S. Pronase treatment abolished the radioactive peak. This 8.3 S protein had a low binding capacity for 25-hydroxy [3H] cholesterol and probably a high affinity. This last parameter was not determined on account of some difficulties encountered in a cell-free system relating to the physico-chemical properties of 25-hydroxycholesterol. Only the hydroxylated sterols closely related to 25-hydroxycholesterol were capable of specifically binding to the 8.3 S protein, in contrast with cholesterol. This protein differed from the binding proteins of oxygenated derivatives of vitamin D3 and glucocorticoids. With the human lymphocyte as a model and under our experimental conditions, this hydroxylated sterol-binding protein seems to be involved rather in the cell division control than in the regulation of HMG-CoA reductase activity: indeed, the hydroxysterols able to inhibit thymidine [3H] incorporation into DNA are recognized by this protein whereas the hydroxysterols active on HMG-CoA reductase activity without affecting thymidine [3H] incorporation into DNA are not.", 
    "53": "Concanavalin A induction of DNA synthesis in mouse spleen lymphocytes cultured in serum-free medium was shown to be very sensitive to inhibition by compactin (ML-236B), a specific competitive inhibitor of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase. As low as 0.1 microM compactin could give 98% inhibition of mitogen induction of a 5.10(6) cells/ml culture. This inhibition could be reversed completely by addition of exogenous mevalonate, but could not be reversed by either exogenous cholesterol or isopentenyladenine. Oxygenated sterol inhibition of mitogen-induced DNA synthesis could be reversed by cholesterol or by mevalonate, whereas cyclic AMP inhibition could not be reversed by either compound. These results suggest that endogenous cholesterol production is a necessary but not sufficient factor co-ordinated with mitogen-induced DNA synthesis, and that the presence of some additional product of mevalonate metabolism is involved also. Isopentenyladenine, though, did not have as significant effect of alleviating any of the above inhibitions. Since mevalonate could not relieve cyclic AMP inhibition, but could overcome compactin inhibition, cyclic AMP inhibition cannot be explained as due only to blockage of mevalonate production.", 
    "54": "Mevinolin reduces cholesterol synthesis by inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase. The safety and effectiveness of this agent was evaluated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 59 healthy men (serum cholesterol 3.88--7.76 mmol/liter) in five centers. Subjects maintained their usual diet and activities. Doses of 6.25, 12.5, 25, or 50 mg twice daily for 4 wk produced mean reductions of total serum cholesterol fo 23--27% [vs. placebo (4%), P less than 0.01]. Mean low density lipoprotein cholesterol fell 35--45%, while high density lipoprotein and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides were not significantly affected. Mean apolipoprotein B fell 27--34%. 50 mg was not significantly more effective than 6.25 mg. Mevinolin was generally well tolerated, and no serious clinical or laboratory abnormalities occurred. One subject (12.5 mg) was withdrawn because of abdominal pain and diarrhea. These results suggest that if long-term safety can be demonstrated, inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase are likely to prove useful in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "55": "Urinary levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid (HMG) were measured by gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) after an extraction with tetrahydrofuran in normal rats, streptozotocin-diabetic rats and starved rats. The analysis was also carried out in the urine of three diabetic patients after suspending the insulin treatment. Detectable amounts of HMG are excreted in urine by normal humans and rats and such an excretion increases in the diabetic condition. Starved rats present only traces of HMG in the urine.", 
    "56": "The developmental aspects of the renal uptake of 3-OH-3-CH3-glutaric acid (HMG) was examined using isolated renal tubules prepared from both newborn and adult rats and isolated renal brush border membranes vesicles from adult rats. The accumulation of 70 microM HMG by both newborn and adult tubules reached a steady state and achieved a distribution ratio (DR) of 4.9 and 6.5, respectively; decreased DR's at higher substrate concentrations suggest concentration-dependent uptake. Lineweaver-Burk analysis of the 5 min calculated velocities of HMG uptake by newborn and adult tubules indicate a single transport system with the same apparent Km of 0.2 mM in both age groups. The Vmax in adult rats was twofold greater than in newborn (0.95 versus 0.44 mM/1/5 min). The carrier system for HMG is assumed to be distinct from those of amino acids and sugars because tubule uptake of HMG is not affected by the presence of alpha-NH2-isobutyric acid and alpha-methyl-D-glucoside. Sodium maleate and acetoacetate significantly decreased HMG uptake in tubules of both age groups. HMG uptake by isolated renal brush border membrane vesicles from adult rats suggests that uptake is both carrier-mediated and Na+-dependent. These observations are consistent with renal tubular HMG uptake by an energy-dependent, carrier-mediated system.", 
    "57": "Seventeen hours after a single oral dose of the cyclic monoterpenes cineole or menthol, rat liver 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity was inhibited by up to 70%. The transient nature of this effect (no inhibition 41 h after dosing) was compatible with the rapid metabolism and excretion of these terpenes. Neither menthol, and its major metabolite, menthylglucuronide, nor cineole acted as direct inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase activity in vitro, although menthol was found to bind to liver microsomes Ks approximately 0.1 mM). Unlike the short term effects of dietary cholesterol, terpene administration did not affect HMG-CoA reductase activity by modulation of the lipid microenvironment of the enzyme. Thus, following menthol or cineole treatment, we found no deviations from the normal kinetic responses to changes in temperature or in concentration of HMG-CoA. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect was still seen after solubilization of the enzyme from microsomes. The loss of HMG-CoA reductase activity was not associated with increased phosphorylation of the enzyme. Immunotitration of HMG-CoA reductase from terpene-treated rats showed that activity loss was due to less enzyme molecules (together with some possibly \"cripple\" enzyme), indicating that rates of enzyme synthesis or degradation had been altered. Since menthol inhibition of reductase was still observed in rats deprived of foods, we conclude that the effect is not mediated by those hormones whose concentration is changed during fasting (insulin, glucagon, and adrenaline).", 
    "58": "A protein kinase which phosphorylates and inactivates acetyl-CoA carboxylase has been purified to apparent homogeneity from rat liver. The kinase was found to exist in two forms: bound to carboxylase in a complex or in a free form that is in different stages of aggregation over a wide range of molecular weights. The purification of the kinase involved first partial purification of acetyl-CoA carboxylase through polyethylene glycol precipitation and DEAE-cellulose chromatography. The kinase was then separated from acetyl-CoA carboxylase by Sepharose 2B chromatography. The molecular weight of the kinase subunit was 170,000 as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. The incorporation of 1 mol of phosphate/mole of carboxylase subunit caused complete inactivation of the carboxylase. Acetyl-CoA carboxylase, inactivated by the kinase, can be dephosphorylated and reactivated when incubated with phosphorylase phosphatase. The Km values of the kinase for acetyl-CoA carboxylase and ATP are 90 nM and 20 microM, respectively. The kinase was found to be cyclic AMP-independent, but activated by CoA. The protein kinase can phosphorylate acetyl-CoA carboxylase, protamine, and histones, but could not act on hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase or phosphorylase b.", 
    "59": "Human granulosa cells cultured in the presence of estradiol, FSH, and LH secreted relatively little progesterone during the first 3-5 days of culture. The cells then underwent a morphological transformation associated with a 10-fold or more increase in progestin production. Cells not cultured with the tropic hormones usually produced progestin at a lower rate. Serum was required for the expression of maximal steroidogenic activity. Inhibitors of de novo sterol synthesis, ML-236B and 5-cholesten-3 beta,25-diol, did not affect progestin secretion by luteinized cells cultured in 20% serum, but these inhibitors did reduce [14C]acetate incorporation into sterols by 90%. ML-236B also did not affect hCG-stimulated progesterone secretion by the cells. However, when the cells were changed into lipoprotein-deficient medium, progestin production was markedly reduced within 24 h. The addition of low density lipoproteins (LDL) to the culture fluid restored progestin production, whereas high density lipoproteins tended to further inhibit steroid secretion. The effects of LDL on steroidogenesis were dose dependent and saturable. We conclude that luteinized human granulosa cells use LDL-carried sterol as the primary substrate for steroidogenesis.", 
    "60": "We have developed a line of Chinese hamster ovary cells with a 500-fold increase in 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, the membrane-bound enzyme that controls cholesterol synthesis. This line, designated (UT-1, was obtained by stepwise adaptation of cells to growth in increasing concentrations of compactin, a competitive inhibitor of reductase. Reductase accounts for approximately 2% of total cell protein in UT-1 cells, as calculated from enzyme specific activity and by immunoprecipitation of reductase after growth of cells in [35S]methionine. After solubilization in the presence of the protease inhibitor leupeptin and electrophoresis in NaDodSO4/polyacrylamide gels, reductase subunits from UT-1 cells were visualized by immunoblotting as a single band (Mr = 62,000). To accommodate the increased amounts of reductase, UT-1 cells developed marked proliferation of tubular smooth endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes, as revealed by immunofluorescence and electron microscopy. The ER tubules were packed in crystalloid hexagonal arrays. When UT-1 cells were incubated with low density lipoprotein, reductase activity was suppressed by 90% in 12 hr and the crystalloid ER disappeared. UT-1 cells should be useful for studies of the regulation of reductase and also for studies of the synthesis and degradation of smooth ER.", 
    "61": "Cholesteryl ester transfer to low density lipoproteins (LDL) was achieved either by incubation of a cholesteryl ester-rich lipid microemulsion with whole plasma or by incubation of the cholesteryl ester-rich microemulsion with lipoprotein-free plasma and LDL. Sequential ultracentrifugal isolation gave LDL that contained between 5 and 37% of the cholesteryl ester derived from the artificial cholesteryl ester donor. The labeling was essentially complete within 2 h of incubation. Resonance energy transfer of LDL, labeled with fluorescent cholesteryl esters and with the surface probe 5-(N-hexadecanoylamino) fluorescein, indicated that the added cholesteryl ester was located in the inner core of the lipoprotein. In addition, biological screening of the labeled LDL in cultured cells in vitro and in the rat in vivo showed that this labeling procedure had no detectable deleterious effect on LDL. This method of labeling lipoproteins allows a rapid and specific introduction of cholesteryl esters into lipoproteins.", 
    "62": "Mevalonic acid (5 x 10(-4)-1 x 10(-2) M) stimulates DNA synthesis, morphologic transformation and cell cycling in peripheral blood human lymphocytes. Other organic acid anions which serve as cholesterol and mevalonate precursors are devoid of such effects. Both ML-236B and 25-hydroxycholesterol, inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, inhibit concanavalin A-induced lymphocyte transformation, but only the inhibition by ML-236B can be overcome by exogenous mevalonate. In contrast, only 25-hydroxycholesterol inhibits mevalonate-induced lymphocyte DNA synthesis. The effects of mevalonic acid on lymphocytes cannot be reproduced by isopentenyl adenine or isopentenyl adenosine. Unregulated endogenous cellular synthesis of mevalonic acid may contribute to uncontrolled growth in certain malignant cell lines.", 
    "63": "Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry was used for the detection of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA lyase (EC 4.1.3.4) deficiency in double first cousins. This enzyme is in the last step of leucine catabolism and is also involved in ketogenesis. Quantitation of urinary organic acids as their cyclohexyl esters demonstrated increased concentrations of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid, 3-methylglutaconic acid, 3-methylglutaric acid, and 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid. The procedure is more rapid, sensitive, and specific than previously reported gas-chromatographic methods for acid quantitation. The affected children initially presented with symptoms similar to Reye's syndrome; the acids were quantitated during periods of altered intake of protein and fat. Both leucine and fat intake contributed to increased acid excretion. These studies suggest that life-threatening episodes of hypoglycemia are best prevented with a low-protein, low-fat diet.", 
    "64": "Mevinolin (MK-803) is a potent inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase. After a placebo run-in period, mevinolin 5,15 or 50 mg, or placebo was given twice daily for 7-11 days under double -blind conditions ot 4 groups of 6 normocholesterolemic male volunteers. After 7 days, mean serum cholesterol fell 14%, 25% and 24% on 5, 15 and 50 mg, respectively, which was significantly greater than the fall on placebo (4%) in the case of the two higher doses (P less than 0.01). Serum triglycerides did not change significantly. Mevinolin was generally well-tolerated and there were no serious adverse effects.", 
    "65": "The fungal metabolite mevinolin, known to be a potent hypocholesterolemic agent, exerts in vitro a strong inhibitory effect on microsomal HMG-CoA reductase from etiolated radish seedlings at a concentration of about three magnitudes lower than the Km towards the natural substrate (S)-HMG-CoA (I50 = 2.5 x 10(-9)M). Beside this, mevinolin significantly inhibits the root elongation of radish as well as of wheat seedlings already at low concentrations of 10 to 100 ppb (= 2.5 x 10(-8) to 2.5 x 10(-7)M).", 
    "66": "Cholesterol biosynthesis was evaluated in different parts of the human gastro-intestinal tract by incorporation of labelled acetic or mevalonic acid into non-saponifiable metabolites and also by measuring squalene epoxidase activity, oxido=squalene cyclase activity and dihydrolanosterol demethylation rate. With respect to rat liver, whole cholesterol biosynthesis was generally low and we found an anatomic localization of activity towards the end of the gastro-intestinal tract. The results of analysis of mevalonic acid metabolites implied the existence of post-HMG CoA regulation. A comparison with the corresponding dat obtained from homologous cancerous tissues (inthe case of high cholesterogenic activity) did not show a greater activity in the tumor, in spite of higher levels of epoxidase concentration.", 
    "67": "The endocrine regulation of the key enzyme of cholesterol synthesis, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (EC 1.1.1.34) and of the brush border enzyme alkaline phosphatase (EC 3.1.3.1) was studied in short (2 h) and long term (24 h) organ culture of rabbit ileum mucosa. In contrast to the hepatic enzyme, intestinal reductase is not subject to regulation by insulin or glucagon even at a pharmacological level. This applies to both 'total' and 'active' reductase, prepared in the absence or presence of sodium fluoride, respectively. During culture, there is a gradual, time-dependent increase in the active, dephosphorylated enzyme form. This endogenous activation was found to be unaffected by all hormones tested. Similarly, alkaline phosphatase was not influenced by both pancreatic hormones. In contrast, triamcinolone significantly (P less than 0.05) suppressed reductase in a dose-dependent fashion to 38% of controls after 24 h, but not after 2 h culture. Alkaline phosphatase was induced after both periods, but the effect was more marked after 24 h. A parallel minor stimulation of both enzyme activities was noted in the presence of 10(-9)M triiodothyronine (P less than 0.05), lower and very high (10(-5)M) concentrations were ineffective. In view of the role of glucocorticoids as intestinal growth inhibitors and of thyroid hormones as growth stimulators, it is suggested that changes in reductase reflect alterations of crypt membrane cholesterol synthesis, whereas the induction of alkaline phosphatase is mediated through an enhanced enterocyte regeneration and/or maturation.", 
    "68": "KF 1492, a new phenylalanine derivative, was administered at a dose of 100 mg/kg or 0.25% (w/w) diet to Wistar rats. After different periods of drug administration, incorporation of 14 C-acetate or 14 C-mevalonic acid into digitonin-precipitable sterols and hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Co A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity were measured. KF 1492 feeding was associated with depressed incorporation of 14 C-acetate into sterols in liver slices or homogenate. There was no effect on incorporation of 14 C-mevalonic acid into sterols. Thus, KF 1492 administration induced inhibition of hepatic HMG-CoA reductase correlated with reduction of incorporation of 14 C-acetate into digitonin-precipitable sterols. KF 1492 feeding also inhibited in vivo sterol synthesis in rats, which was intraperitoneally injected with 14 C-acetate. Stereoisomers, metabolites adn chemically similar compounds of KF 1492 reduced HMG-CoA reductase activity, and this was correlated with lowering the activity of plasma cholesterol. These findings indicate that a major site of the action of KF 1492 in the inhibition of sterol synthesis may be at the level of HMG-CoA reductase.", 
    "69": "1. The effects of the cholesterol-lowering drug probucol on lipoprotein metabolism and on the key enzymes that regulate hepatic cholesterol metabolism in the rat were studied. 2. Probucol given for 2 weeks was accompanied by a significant reduction in plasma concentrations of low-density and high-density lipoproteins (LDL,HDL). The fractional catabolic rates of the apolipoproteins of HDL and LDL (apoHDL, apoLDL) were not affected by probucol, although the absolute rates of catabolism of both the apolipoproteins were significantly reduced. 3. The activities of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (CoA) reductase and cholesterol 7 alpha-mono-oxygenase, as well as the rate of hepatic sterol synthesis, were unchanged during the first 2 weeks of probucol. More prolonged probucol led to inhibition of the activity of these enzymes and reduction in sterol synthesis, although the liver cellular content of cholesterol significantly increased. 4. It is postulated that a principal mode of action of the drug is to reduce the rate of lipoprotein synthesis.", 
    "70": "Beta-Hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl coenzyme A hydrolase, or deacylase, (EC 3.1.2.5) is important, at least potentially, in the regulation of mammalian cholesterol synthesis. This is so for two reasons, both related to the enzyme generally regarded as rate-limiting for cholesterogenesis, namely beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl CoA reductase: (i) the hydrolase competes for the same substrate as the reductase and (ii) its end product, hydroxymethylglutamic acid, is a known inhibitor of the reductase. Consequently we have examined some of the properties of the hydrolase, as found in rat liver, after first developing a simple isotopic technique for its assay. Beta-Hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl CoA hydrolase is both soluble and microsomal. The microsomal enzyme is inactivated by pre-incubation at 37 degree C, but not a 4 degree C, has an apparent pH optimum of approximately 7.6, and has Km and V values of 270 (microM) and 33.3 (nmol HMG/10 per mg protein), respectively, at 37 degree C. For the cytosolic enzyme the corresponding Km and V values are 830 and 111.1. From our observations it seems unlikely that beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl CoA hydrolase plays a significant role in the regulation of hepatic cholesterol synthesis since, in contrast to microsomal beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, we could find for the microsomal hydrolase no evidence of a diurnal rhythm of activity, no inhibition of activity by short-term cholesterol feeding and no evidence from Arrhenius-plot data for any membrane-mediated control of enzyme activity. Thus, the significance of the enzyme in mammalian systems remains unknown.", 
    "71": "Effects of vitamin B2-butyrate, nicomol, ML-236B, KF 1492 and pantethine, which are hypolipidemic drugs, on biochemical values and on hepatic peroxisomal enzymes of normolipemic rat. 1) Vitamin B2-butyrate (100 mg/kg) and nicomol (lg/Kg) increased carnitine acetyltransferase and D-amino acid oxidase activities, respectively, while these drugs had no influence on body weight, liver weight, serum and liver triglyceride, and serum and liver cholesterol levels. 2) ML-236B (300 mg/kg) had no influence on biochemical values and on activities of peroxisomal enzymes containing catalase. 3) KF 1492 (300 mg/kg) had no influence on the biochemical values, but an increase in the activities of fatty acyl-CoA oxidizing system (FAOS) and carnitine acetyltransferase (CAT) participating hepatic lipid metabolism was observed. 4) Pantethine (lg/kg) had no influence on the biochemical values, except a little decrease in the growth rate. However, increase by about 10% in the activities of urate oxidase and D-amino acid oxidase was observed. Catalase activity was decreased to 60% of control level. From these results, it is concluded that, in contrast to clofibrate, vitamin B2-butyrate, nicomol, ML-236B, KF 1492 and pantethine have little influence on the lipid metabolism of normolipemic animal and on the hepatic peroxisomal enzymes, indicating that the action mechanism of these drugs may be different from that of clofibrate and that the participation of hepatic peroxisomes in hypolipidemic activities of these drugs may be little if any.", 
    "72": "Major endogenous regulatory controls of cholesterol synthesis including dietary-feedback inhibition, circadian rhythms, feeding/fasting fluctuations, and enterohepatic bile acid circulation are discussed in terms of biochemical control mechanisms of liver cholesterol biosynthesis. Other likely control mechanisms such as cofactors, enzyme levels, and enzyme activities are noted. The current state of the biochemical knowledge is very dependent upon integrated data from one experimental animal - the rat. Inferences and implications in the human are thus limited.", 
    "73": "The effect of decreasing cellular sterol content on neurite outgrowth in C1300 (Neuro 2A) neuroblastoma cells in serum-free medium has been studied. Sterol-depleted, undifferentiated neuroblastoma cells were obtained by growing cells for 24 h in medium containing lipoprotein-poor serum and 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OHC). Under these conditions the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase and the incorporation of [14C] acetate into sterols were almost completely suppressed, and the sterol/phospholipid ratio of the cells declined to 60% of that in cultures grown without 25-OHC. The sterol-depleted cells were viable and exhibited rats of DNA, RNA, protein and fatty acid synthesis comparable to those measured in control cultures. Sterol depletion had no detectable effect on the number of cells that were able to undergo morphological differentiation within 3 h after removal of serum from the medium. However, by 24 h most of the sterol-depleted cells had retracted their neurites. The observation that addition of low-density lipoprotein was able to restore neurite outgrowth in cultures treated with 25-OHC indicates that the inability of sterol-depleted cells to maintain their neurites is related specifically to the decline in the sterol content rather than to a general cytotoxic effect of 25-OHC. Our findings suggest that incorporation of cholesterol into the cell membrane is important for long-term maintenance and elongation of neuroblastoma neurites, but that the initial morphological change (e.e., within 3 h after removal of serum) is apparently a separate and distinct event, not dependent on the availability of cholesterol.", 
    "74": "Compactin, a fungal metabolite, is a well-characterized competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, the enzyme which generally controls the rate of cholesterol biosynthesis in mammalian cells. Various products of cholesterol oxidation, e.g., 25-hydroperoxycholesterol and 25-hydroxycholesterol, also inhibit HMG CoA reductase but by an unknown mechanism which operates only in intact cells. In addition, oxidized cholesterol increases cholesterol esterification and suppresses the increase in low-density lipoprotein receptors which is the normal consequence of decreasing low-density lipoprotein supply. There are therefore, three ways in which the availability of nonesterified cholesterol to mammalian cells is decreased by oxidized cholesterol. It has been suggested that potent in vitro immunosuppression by compounds such as 25-hydroxycholesterol in the presence of cholesterol-containing fetal calf serum is a consequence of their ability to suppress cholesterol biosynthesis. This has been disputed in a previous paper (Humphries, G. M. K., and McConnell, H. M., J. Immunol., 122: 121-126, 1979) because mevalonate, the product of HMG CoA reductase activity, fails to abrogate the suppression. The present paper reports that compactin fails to suppress in vitro immune responses at concentrations known to inhibit HMG CoA reductase (either in the isolated or cellular form). This finding supports the previous conclusion that suppression of HMG CoA reductase activity is not sufficient to inhibit in vitro immune responses in the presence of an exogenous source of cholesterol."
