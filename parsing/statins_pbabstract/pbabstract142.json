    "0": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR), ligand-activated transcription factors, belong to the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily regulating expression of genes involved in different aspects of lipid metabolism, inflammation and cardiac energy production. Activation of PPAR-\u03b1 isoform by its natural ligands, fatty acids (FA) and eicosanoids, promotes mitochondrial FA oxidation as the primary ATP-generating pathway. On the other hand, PPAR-\u03b3 regulates lipid anabolism or storage, while, until recently, the function of PPAR-\u03b2/\u03b4 has been less explored. Under conditions associated with acute or chronic oxygen deprivation, PPAR-\u03b1 modulates expression of genes that determine substrate switch (FA vs. glucose) aimed at maintenance of basic cardiac function. Although PPAR-\u03b1 and PPAR-\u03b3 synthetic agonists, hypolipidemic and antidiabetic drugs, have been reported to protect the heart against ischemia/reperfusion injury, it is still a matter of debate whether PPAR activation plays a beneficial or detrimental role in myocardial response to ischemia, in particular, in pathological conditions. This article reviews some findings demonstrating the impact of PPAR activation on cardiac resistance to ischemia in normal and pathologically altered heart. Specifically, it addresses the issue of susceptibility to ischemia in the diabetic myocardium, with particular regards to the role of PPAR. Finally, involvement of PPAR in the mechanisms of lipid-independent cardioprotective effects of some hypolipidemic drugs is also discussed.", 
    "1": "Statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, have been used as a cholesterol-lowering drug to treat hyperlipidemia clinically. In recent years, accumulating evidence indicates the possible beneficial effect of statins on osteoporosis. The aim of present study was to investigate whether protection against osteoporosis by statins is linked to a reduction of oxidative stress and restoration of nitric oxide (NO) formation in aged and ovariectomized rats. The aged and ovariectomized rats were used as two models of osteoporosis for evaluation of the effect of simvastatin. It was found that simvastatin abated oxidative stress, increased NO production, subsequently attenuating osteoporosis in two models. In the in vitro studies, the protective effects against H(2)O(2)-induced cell injury were examined in the MG-63 human osteoblastic cells. It was found that simvastatin ameliorated H(2)O(2)-induced cell loss and cell apoptosis and increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity in osteoblastic cells. Simvastatin abated oxidative stress through enhancing catalase, heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and suppressing NADPH oxidase activity. In addition, simvastatin raised nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity and eNOS expression at basal condition; inhibited NOS activity and iNOS expression when treated with H(2)O(2). In conclusion, protection against osteoporosis by statins is linked to a reduction of oxidative stress and restoration of NO formation in aged and ovariectomized rats.",

Participants were enrolled in a randomized controlled clinical trial to determine whether a telephone counseling intervention can help PAD patients achieve an LDL-C level < 70 mg/dl, compared to usual care and attention control conditions, respectively. Adjusting for age, race, comorbidities, PAD severity, and other covariates, male sex (odds ratio = 3.33, 95% confidence interval = 1.64 to 6.77, p = 0.001) was associated with a higher likelihood of adding cholesterol-lowering medication during follow-up, but was not associated with achieving an LDL-C < 70 mg/dl (odds ratio = 1.09, 95% confidence interval = 0.55 to 2.18).

Consecutive patients treated with EVAR (Zenith(\u00ae) stent grafts; Cook) between May 1998 and February 2006 were prospectively enrolled in a computerized database, together with retrospectively collected data on medication, and electrocardiographic and echocardiographic variables. Mortality was assessed on 1 December 2010. The median follow-up time was 68 months and the median age was 74 years (range 53-89) for the 304 patients. Mortality at the end of follow-up was 54.3% (165/304). The proportion of deaths caused by vascular diseases was 61% (101/165). In the univariate analysis, low preoperative ejection fraction (EF) (p = 0.004), absence of statin medication (p = 0.007), and medication with diuretics (p = 0.028) or digitalis (p = 0.016) were associated with an increased long-term mortality rate. Myocardial ischemia on electrocardiogram (ECG) (hazard ratio (HR) 1.6 [95% CI 1.1-2.4]) and anemia (HR 1.5 [95% CI 1.0-2.1]) were found to be independent predictors for long-term mortality after Cox regression analysis. There was a trend that chronic kidney disease, stage \u2265 3 (HR 1.5 [95% CI 1.0-2.2]), and age 80 years and above (HR 1.5 [95% CI 1.0-2.4]) were independently associated with long-term mortality.

The study aimed to calculate their growth rate, identify risk factors and determine appropriate screening intervals. The local screening programme and hospital records were used to identify patients with a small (< 5.5 cm) AAA. The dates and maximum diameter of serial scans of patients with two or more scans were obtained. Patients were subdivided by 0.5 cm increments above 3.0 cm. The rate of growth was calculated by linear regression for each patient using both the absolute measurements and logarithmically (ln) transformed measurements. The 95th centile of growth rate within each subgroup was used to estimate the minimum time to grow to 5.5 cm. A total of 252 were included. The mean (\u00b1 SD) AAA size on the initial scan was 3.9 (\u00b1 0.7) cm. Statin use and initial size were predictive factors for the growth rate. The median rate of growth increased according to size from 0.075 to 0.432 cm/year for AAA < 3.5 cm and > 5.0 cm, respectively. It also steadily increased for ln measurements from 0.022 (or 2.2%/year) to 0.078 or (7.8%/year). The minimum time (months) to reach 5.5 cm was 61, 17, 11 and 5 for AAA < 3.5 cm, 3.5-3.9 cm, 4.0-4.4 cm and 4.5-4.9 cm, respectively. Based on ln measurements, the times were similar at 60, 17, 10 and 4 months. In conclusion, the rate of growth increased steadily with AAA size. An aneurysm < 3.5 cm does not require a repeat scan for 5 years, while those measuring 3.5-3.9 cm and 4.0-4.4 cm require a repeat scan after 17 and 11 months.",

In the present study, we examined the effects of simvastatin on the SPC-induced \u03b1-SMA expression and Smad2 phosphorylation in hASCs. Simvastatin inhibited the SPC-induced \u03b1-SMA expression and sustained phosphorylation of Smad2 in hASCs. SPC treatment caused RhoA activation via a simvastatin-sensitive mechanism. The SPC-induced \u03b1-SMA expression and Smad2 phosphorylation were abrogated by pretreatment of the cells with the Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632 or overexpression of a dominant negative RhoA mutant. Furthermore, SPC induced secretion of TGF-\u03b21 and pretreatment with either Y27632 or simvastatin inhibited the SPC-induced TGF-\u03b21 secretion. These results suggest that simvastatin inhibits SPC-induced differentiation of hASCs into smooth muscle cells by attenuating the RhoA/Rho kinase-dependent activation of autocrine TGF-\u03b21/Smad2 signaling pathway.",

It has no value in patients at high risk who would be treated regardless of CRP (eg, patients with coronary disease or of equivalent risk), in patients at low risk who do not warrant treatment, and those with other acute or chronic inflammatory conditions that amplify CRP. Drawbacks to the widespread clinical use of CRP include its small impact on risk prediction beyond other risk factors, and evidence from JUPITER and other trials that baseline CRP is unable to identify patients who obtain greater absolute benefits from statin therapy. Furthermore, the within-person variability of CRP is about the same as the reduction in CRP from intensive statin therapy, and this leads to many patients registering an increase in CRP with treatment. For these reasons, CRP has no clear role in determining who should receive statin therapy or for monitoring the success of treatment.",

Experimental studies with statins have shown an enormous variety of other effects that could extend the clinical benefit beyond the lipid profile modification itself. Statin-based therapies benefit other important components of the atherothrombotic process: inflammation, oxidation, coagulation, fibrinolysis, endothelial function, vasoreactivity and platelet function. The demonstration of the effects that do not depend on cholesterol lowering or the pleiotropic effects of statins provides the theoretical basis for their potential role as adjunctive therapy in acute coronary syndromes.

Coronary angiography, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), IVUS-derived virtual histology (VH) and genetic polymorphism analysis were performed at study entry. Patients were randomized 1:1 to standard or aggressive hypolipidaemic treatment, and a follow-up evaluation was performed after twelve months. Plaque magnitude was significantly higher in carriers of HO1 risk variants when compared with carriers of the protective variants (< 25 GT repeats). Similarly, the total coronary atherosclerotic burden was significantly greater in HO1 risk variant carriers than in HO1 protective variant carriers. Both parameters did not differ with respect to the ENOS genotype. A higher prevalence of thin-cap fibroatheroma (TCFA) in HO1 risk variant carriers was observed, compared with the HO1 protective variant carriers. The prevalence of TCFA was not influenced by the ENOS genotype. Baseline plaque composition did not differ significantly with respect to both polymorphisms. Significant interactions between plaque composition changes and ENOS and HO1 genotypes were observed during statin treatment. In conclusion, the protective HO1 promoter polymorphism correlates with a lower coronary artery plaque burden, whereas the protective ENOS 894 G/T polymorphism seems to favourably influence changes of coronary artery plaque composition during statin therapy, but has no significant correlation to the magnitude of coronary atherosclerosis.",

    "63": "The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have been shown to exert several protective effects on the vasculature that are unrelated to changes in the cholesterol profile, and to induce angiogenesis. The proangiogenic effect exerted by statins has been attributed to the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway in endothelial cells; however, it is unclear how statins activate this pathway. Pravastatin-mediated activation of Akt and MAPK occurs rapidly (within 10 min.) and at low doses (10 nM). Here, we hypothesized that FGF-2 contributes to the proangiogenic effect of statins. We found that pravastatin, a hydrophilic statin, induced phosphorylation of the FGF receptor (FGFR) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. SU5402, an inhibitor of FGFR, abolished pravastatin-induced PI3K/Akt and MAPK activity. Likewise, anti-FGF-2 function-blocking antibodies inhibited Akt and MAPK activity. Moreover, depletion of extracellular FGF-2 by heparin prevented pravastatin-induced phosphorylation of Akt and MAPK. Treatment with FGF-2 antibody inhibited pravastatin-enhanced endothelial cell proliferation, migration and tube formation. These observations indicate that pravastatin exerts proangiogenic effects in endothelial cells depending upon the extracellular FGF-2.",

The NO2(-) + NO3(-) concentration in erythrocytes decreases in hypertensive patients but is completely restored after therapy with lisinopril alone or in combination with simvastatin.

    "73": "Diabetes mellitus in the 'elderly' poses unique management challenges that contribute to conflicting priorities. Individualized management requires taking into account each patient's medical history, functional ability, home care situation, life expectancy and his/her health beliefs; individuals value trade-offs (e.g. quantity versus quality of life, and side effects as well as risks versus long-term benefits) differently. Moreover, this decision making relies on imperfect evidence. Target goals for three intermediate outcomes - glycaemic control (glycosylated haemoglobin [HbA(1c)]), blood pressure control and lipid control (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C]) - help keep management on track. Of these, glycaemic control is usually the most complex. Glycaemic control alleviates symptoms of hyperglycaemia and can improve micro- and macrovascular outcomes. Tight glycaemic control (HbA(1c) <7%) clearly improves microvascular outcomes. However, hypoglycaemia and polypharmacy are the main drawbacks of tight control. Factors that influence the benefits and drawbacks include age, longevity and co-morbidities, including the geriatric 'syndromes' of frailty and falls. We favour the explicit risk-stratified approach of the Department of Veterans Affairs/Department of Defense (VA/DoD) guidelines, which set HbA(1c) target ranges based on physiological age or the presence/severity of major co-morbidities and microvascular complications. There are clear benefits of blood pressure and cholesterol control (primarily reduction of macrovascular events, but also microvascular events), and their overall cost effectiveness exceeds that of glycaemic control. Issues with treatment for hypertension include potential side effects of drugs, a potential increased risk of falls and risks of polypharmacy. Nevertheless, the evidence for a blood pressure target of <140/80 mmHg is reasonably strong if it can be achieved safely. In general, we recommend use of an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) and an LDL-C target of <100 mg/dL, especially if an individual cannot tolerate a moderate dose of a statin.",

Recently, pharmacovigilance data has suggested that statin drugs may have rare but significant adverse psychiatric effects, such as amnesia, anxiety and even aggression. In order to investigate the effects of statins on cognitive function in an animal model, we studied the effect of 6 weeks of daily administration of oral simvastatin (1 mg/kg) or atorvastatin (0.5mg/kg) in guinea pig on performance in the Morris water maze (MWM). Animals were also re-tested in the MWM, 2 weeks after drug cessation, to test for any changes in performance as a result of drug de-challenge. Guinea pigs treated with either statin showed a significant (P<0.001) decrease in total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), which remained partially reduced after the 2 week drug washout period. Guinea pigs receiving either statin did not show any difference in latency to reach the platform, nor any difference in total distance travelled during testing. Also, analysis of probe trials revealed no significant differences between drug and vehicle groups. However, both groups spent a significantly (P<0.01) greater proportion of time in the outer zone of the maze (indication of increased anxiety) and showed an increase in swimming speed (P<0.05) compared with the vehicle group. Differences between groups for swimming speed, and time spent in the outer zone, were not retained in the drug de-challenge phase.

Hyperlipidemia was induced in vivo in golden Syrian hamsters and in monocyte cell culture (U937) by feeding the animals with a high-fat Western diet and by exposing the cells to hyperlipidemic serum. Blood samples, heart, lung and cells were harvested for biochemical, morphological, Western blot, quantitative polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analyses. The data revealed that, in the atherosclerotic animal model, the protein HMGB1 and its gene expression were increased and that fluvastatin treatment significantly reduced the release of HMGB1 into the extracellular space. The cell culture experiments demonstrated the relocation of HMGB1 protein from the nucleus to cytoplasm under hyperlipidemic stress. The high level of detected HMGB1 correlated positively with the up-regulation of the advanced glycation end product receptors (RAGE) in the lung tissue from hyperlipidemic animals. During hyperlipidemic stress, the AKT signaling pathway could be activated by HMGB1-RAGE interaction. These results support the existence of a direct correlation between experimentally induced hyperlipidemia and the extracellular release of HMGB1 protein; this might be controlled by statin treatment. Moreover, the data suggest new potentials for statin therapy, with improved effects on patients with systemic inflammation induced by hyperlipidemia.",

There were no serious side effects or abnormal laboratory data that would have required the protocol to have been terminated except for 1 patient with myalgia. Coadministration of ezetimibe and granulated colestimide further lowered serum LDL cholesterol more than rosuvastatin alone without changing plasma coenzyme Q10 and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 levels.

    "99": "Persistent oxidative stress in the vascular wall may lead to endothelial dysfunction, a pathological process widely implicated in the morbidities observed in a spectrum of cardiovascular disease. The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is regulated by various oxidase enzymes and mitochondrial electron transport mechanisms. Nitric oxide (NO) is a key mediator of endothelial function via its effect on endothelium dependent vascular relaxation. Therapeutic interventions aimed to increase NO bioavailability in the vasculature may improve the long term cardiovascular outcome for healthy individuals, high-risk subjects, and patients with advanced atherosclerosis. Current therapeutic strategies focus on enhancing synthesis or lowering oxidative inactivation of NO in human vasculature. Of the available therapeutic agents, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and statins have shown most promise at improving endothelial function and cardiovascular outcome after long term administration. Other therapeutic approaches may also be useful towards improving endothelial dysfunction. These strategies include targeting NO synthesis by modulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) coupling, such as folates and tetrahydrobiopterin.

Endothelial dysfunction has been identified as a major mechanism involved in all the stages of atherogenesis. Evaluation of endothelial function seems to have a predictive role in humans, and therapeutic interventions improving nitric oxide bioavailability in the vasculature, may improve the long-term outcome in healthy individuals, high-risk subjects or patients with advanced atherosclerosis. Several therapeutic strategies (including statins, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptors blockers, insulin sensitizers, antioxidant compounds) are now available, targeting both the synthesis and oxidative inactivation of NO in human vasculature, reversing in that way endothelial dysfunction which is enhanced by the release of nitric oxide from the endothelium.",

The effect of APS (0.25 g/kg/d) on plasma and liver lipids, fecal bile acids and neutral sterol, cholesterol absorption and synthesis, HMG-CoA reductase activity, and gene and protein expressions in the liver and small intestine was investigated in twenty-four hypercholesterolemia hamsters. Treatment periods lasted for three months. APS significantly lowered plasma total cholesterol by 45.8%, triglycerides by 30%, and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol by 47.4%, comparable to simvastatin. Further examinations revealed that APS reduced total cholesterol and triglycerides in the liver, increased fecal bile acid and neutral sterol excretion, inhibited cholesterol absorption, and by contrast, increased hepatic cholesterol synthesis and HMG-CoA reductase activity. Plasma total cholesterol or low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels were significantly correlated with cholesterol absorption rates. APS up-regulated cholesterol-7\u03b1-hydroxylase and LDL-receptor gene expressions. These new findings identify APS as a potential natural cholesterol lowering agent, working through mechanisms distinct from statins.",

The study included 650 patients with severe hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol\u22657.5mmol/l; LDL\u22654.9mmol/l). The treatment groups were administered 80mg simvastatin over a period of one month. The results indicated a reduction in ADMA and tHcy levels and an increase in %FMD in the treatment groups, compared with the control groups (receiving placebo or 40mg simvastatin). There was a statistically significant correlation between the %FMD changes and the baseline levels of Apo-B, ADMA and tHcy, as well as between the %ADMA changes and %LDL, % apolipoprotein-B and %tHcy-changes in patients on 80mg Simvastatin. A statistical linear regression analysis (in the treatment group) indicated that the baseline ADMA level is the most important statistically significant predictor related to %FMD-changes. A linear regression analysis additionally documented that % apolipoprotein-B-changes is a predictor of %ADMA-changes. In conclusion, in cases with optimized LDL-target levels (patients on 80mg Simvastatin), the baseline level of ADMA appears to be a major modulator of %FMD-changes.",

    "147": "Aspergillus fumigatus is the most common airborne fungal pathogen for humans. In this mold, iron starvation induces production of the siderophore triacetylfusarinine C (TAFC). Here we demonstrate a link between TAFC and ergosterol biosynthetic pathways, which are both critical for virulence and treatment of fungal infections. Consistent with mevalonate being a limiting prerequisite for TAFC biosynthesis, we observed increased expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase (Hmg1) under iron starvation, reduced TAFC biosynthesis following lovastatin-mediated Hmg1 inhibition, and increased TAFC biosynthesis following Hmg1 overexpression. We identified enzymes, the acyl-CoA ligase SidI and the enoyl-CoA hydratase SidH, linking biosynthesis of mevalonate and TAFC, deficiency of which under iron starvation impaired TAFC biosynthesis, growth, oxidative stress resistance, and murine virulence. Moreover, inactivation of these enzymes alleviated TAFC-derived biosynthetic demand for mevalonate, as evidenced by increased resistance to lovastatin. Concordant with bilateral demand for mevalonate, iron starvation decreased the ergosterol content and composition, a phenotype that is mitigated in TAFC-lacking mutants.",

Under anaesthesia, 12 fetal sheep at 118 \u00b1 1 days of gestation (term\u2002ca\u2002145 days) were instrumented with vascular catheters and a femoral artery Transonic flow probe for chronic recording.

In half of the fetuses (n\u2002= 6), responses to hypoxia post-pravastatin were evaluated during NO synthesis blockade. Fetal exposure to pravastatin did not affect fetal basal cardiovascular function. Fetal was similarly reduced in all acute hypoxia experiments from\u2002ca\u200221 to 10 mmHg. Fetal exposure to pravastatin markedly diminished the fetal femoral vasoconstrictor (5.1 \u00b1 0.9\u2002vs.\u20022.5 \u00b1 0.5 mmHg (ml min(-1))(-1)) and lactic acidaemic (4.4 \u00b1 0.5\u2002vs.\u20023.0 \u00b1 0.3 mm) responses to acute hypoxia (both\u2002P\u2002< 0.05), without affecting plasma catecholamine responses. Post-pravastatin, the circulatory (5.8 \u00b1 1.5 mmHg (ml min(-1))(-1)) and metabolic (3.9 \u00b1 0.3 mm) responses could be restored to control levels during fetal treatment with NO synthase blockade.

    "149": "Statins, among the most commonly prescribed drugs worldwide, are cholesterol-lowering agents used to manage and prevent cardiovascular and coronary heart diseases. Recently, a multifaceted action in different physiological and pathological conditions has been also proposed for statins, beyond anti-inflammation and neuroprotection. Statins have been shown to act through cholesterol-dependent and -independent mechanisms and are able to affect several tissue functions and modulate specific signal transduction pathways that could account for statin pleiotropic effects. Typically, statins are prescribed in middle-aged or elderly patients in a therapeutic regimen covering a long life span during which metabolic processes, aging, and concomitant novel diseases, including cancer, could occur. In this context, safety, toxicity, interaction with other drugs, and the state of health have to be taken into account in subjects treated with statins. Some evidence has shown a dichotomous effect of statins with either cancer-inhibiting or -promoting effects. To date, clinical trials failed to demonstrate a reduced cancer occurrence in statin users and no sufficient data are available to define the long-term effects of statin use over a period of 10 years. Moreover, results from clinical trials performed to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of statins in cancer did not suggest statin use as chemotherapeutic or adjuvant agents. Here, we reviewed the pharmacology of the statins, providing a comprehensive update of the current knowledge of their effects on tissues, biological processes, and pathological conditions, and we dissected the disappointing evidence on the possible future use of statin-based drugs in cancer therapy.",

Based on all the data obtained, new potential therapeutic agents have been proposed. Statins have a variety of direct effects on gene expression and the function of cells of both the innate and adaptive immune systems, many of which are related to blockade of GTPase isoprenylation. In APS, statins have multiple profound effects on monocyte, lymphocyte, and endothelial cell activities, all of which may contribute to thrombosis prevention in APS patients. Nevertheless, larger randomized trials are needed to validate the role of statins in the treatment of this autoimmune disease.",

Meta-regression showed the existence of minor heterogeneity (I\u00b2 = 19%) could be largely accounted for by baseline serum creatinine. Two studies conducted in patients with CKD Stage \u2265 3 did not reveal a statistically significant difference in CIN incidence between the statin and placebo groups (6.5% vs. 7.2%) (RR = 0.89, 0.46 - 1.73), without evidence of heterogeneity (I\u00b2 = 0%, p = 0.79).

    "158": "Inclusion body myopathy with Paget disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by progressive myopathy that is often accompanied by bone weakening and/or frontotemporal dementia. Although it is known to be caused by mutations in the gene encoding valosin-containing protein (VCP), the underlying disease mechanism remains elusive. Like IBMPFD, neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is an autosomal dominant disorder. Neurofibromin, the protein encoded by the NF1 gene, has been shown to regulate synaptogenesis. Here, we show that neurofibromin and VCP interact and work together to control the density of dendritic spines. Certain mutations identified in IBMPFD and NF1 patients reduced the interaction between VCP and neurofibromin and impaired spinogenesis. The functions of neurofibromin and VCP in spinogenesis were shown to correlate with the learning disability and dementia phenotypes seen in patients with IBMPFD. Consistent with the previous finding that treatment with a statin rescues behavioral defects in Nf1(+/-) mice and providing further support for our hypothesis that there is crosstalk between neurofibromin and VCP, statin exposure neutralized the effect of VCP knockdown on spinogenesis in cultured hippocampal neurons. The data presented here demonstrate that there is a link between IBMPFD and NF1 and indicate a role for VCP in synapse formation.",

Preoperative statin medication (P = .01), contralateral carotid occlusion (P = .02), and shunting use (P = .03) were more frequent among female patients. No perioperative deaths occurred in the series as a whole, while the perioperative stroke risk (0.6% vs 0.5%), and the combined late carotid restenosis and occlusion rate (1.1% vs 0.4%) were comparable between female and male patients.

    "172": "Staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) is one of a family of toxins secreted by Staphylococcus aureus that act as superantigens, activating a large fraction of the T-cell population and inducing production of high levels of inflammatory cytokines that can cause toxic shock syndrome (TSS) and death. Extracellular engagement of the TCR of T-cells and class II MHC of antigen presenting cells by SEB triggers the activation of many intracellular signaling processes. We engineered chimeric antibodies to block the extracellular engagement of cellular receptors by SEB and used a statin to inhibit intracellular signaling. Chimeric human-mouse antibodies directed against different neutralizing epitopes of SEB synergistically inhibited its activation of human T-cells in vitro. In the in vivo model of lethal toxic shock syndrome (TSS) in HLA-DR3 transgenic mice, two of these antibodies conferred significant partial protection when administered individually, but offered complete protection in a synergistic manner when given together. Similarly, in vivo, lovastatin alone conferred only partial protection from TSS similar to single anti-SEB antibodies. However, used in combination with one chimeric neutralizing anti-SEB antibody, lovastatin provided complete protection against lethal TSS in HLA-DR3 transgenic mice. These experiments demonstrate that in vivo protection against lethal doses of SEB can be achieved by a statin of proven clinical safety and chimeric human-mouse antibodies, agents now widely used and known to be of low immunogenicity in human hosts.", 
    "173": "Apoptosis of leukocytes is known to strongly influence the immunopathogenesis of infection. In this study, we dissected the death pathways of murine macrophages (M\u03a6s) infected with the intracellular pathogen Histoplasma capsulatum. Yeast cells caused apoptosis of M\u03a6s at a wide range of multiplicity of infection, but smaller inocula resulted in delayed detection of apoptosis. Upon infection, caspases 3 and 1 were activated, and both contributed to cell death; however, only the former was involved in apoptosis. The principal driving force for apoptosis involved the extrinsic pathway via engagement of TNFR1 by TNF-\u03b1. Infected M\u03a6s produced IL-10 that dampened apoptosis. The chronology of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-10 release differed in vitro. The former was detected by 2 h postinfection, and the latter was not detected until 8 h postinfection. In vivo, the lungs of TNFR1(-/-) mice infected for 1 d contained fewer apoptotic M\u03a6s than wild-type mice, whereas the lungs of IL-10(-/-) mice exhibited more. Blockade of apoptosis by a pan-caspase inhibitor or by simvastatin sharply reduced the release of TNF-\u03b1 but enhanced IL-10. However, these treatments did not modify the fungal burden in vitro over 72 h. Thus, suppressing cell death modulated cytokine release but did not alter the fungal burden. These findings provide a framework for the early pathogenesis of histoplasmosis in which yeast cell invasion of lung M\u03a6s engenders apoptosis, triggered in part in an autocrine TNF-\u03b1-dependent manner, followed by release of IL-10 that likely prevents apoptosis of newly infected neighboring phagocytes.",

    "187": "Unlike controlled release systems that deliver a single drug, dual or multidrug delivery systems with distinct release profiles are more likely to promote timely and effective tissue regeneration as they provide both temporally and concentration-dependent release of different molecules to mimic natural biological events. In this study, an injectable and biodegradable delivery system was developed to sequentially release an antiresorptive drug (clodronate) followed by an osteogenic agent (simvastatin) to treat bone disease. The injectable delivery system comprised simvastatin-loaded gelatin microspheres suspended in a viscous solution of carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) containing clodronate. Several factors (CMC concentration, glutaraldehyde concentration, simvastatin loading, and gelatin microsphere processing conditions) were investigated for their effects on drug release. Clodronate release was not affected by CMC concentration, with complete delivery within 12 hr, and simvastatin release could be modulated by cross-linking of the gelatin microspheres, loading, and washing conditions. Burst release of simvastatin was reduced from 70% to 6% in conjunction with sustained release for up to 3 weeks. The combined system showed early release of the antiresorptive clodronate sequentially followed by sustained delivery of the osteogenic simvastatin. This robust and flexible two-phase delivery system may prove useful for applications in which multiple drug delivery is desired.",

Scientific evidence implicates low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and high triglycerides (TG) in the CVR observed after LDL-C lowering. However, the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) lipid trial with fenofibrate, the Investigation of Lipid Level Management to Understand its Impact in Atherosclerotic Events (ILLUMINATE) study with torcetrapib, and the recently terminated Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome with Low HDL Cholesterol/High Triglyceride and Impact on Global Health Outcomes (AIM-HIGH) study with niacin, do not clearly attribute risk reduction value to HDL-C/TG modulation. The optimum approach to long-term lipid-modifying therapies for CVR reduction remains uncertain. Consequently, absolute risk modulation via lifestyle changes remains the centerpiece of a strategy addressing the physiologic drivers of CVR associated with HDL-C/TG, especially in the context of diabetes/metabolic syndrome.", 
    "189": "Statins inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis. Their main effect is a decrease in circulating levels of LDL cholesterol, which translates into a ~ 20% relative reduction of major vascular events and coronary mortality per mmol/L LDL reduction achieved. Statins are efficient in preventing first cardiovascular events, but the cost-efficiency of primary prevention remains controversial. In primary prevention particularly, the pros and cons of statin therapy should be weighted by considering patient-specific life circumstances and assessing the individual cardiovascular risk, as provided by risk calculators. Since diabetes mellitus poses a high risk even in the absence of known coronary artery disease, statin treatment is generally indicated in these patients. There is no lower LDL threshold defining the limit of treatment benefit; rather, LDL target levels should be sought according to individual cardiovascular risk. If the necessary precautions are taken, e.g., by considering age, co-morbidities and co-medication when choosing the dose, statins are well tolerated and safe, as evidenced by many randomised controlled trials and meta-analyses. If a patient will not tolerate a statin dose necessary to achieve his or her LDL target level, ezetimibe may be added. There is no indication that statins alter cancer risk. Despite recent evidence that statin treatment is associated with a small risk of incident diabetes mellitus, this disadvantage is outweighed by the vascular benefits. Statins have pleiotropic effects, such as anti-inflammatory properties. It is still debated to what extent these effects translate into cardiovascular risk reduction beyond that conferred by LDL reduction.",

There was no significant increase in CHE (from 16.1% to 17.6%, p for trend = 0.053). Individual changes in HDL-C correlated significantly (p<0.05) with individual changes of CHE (r=0.76).",

Thus, there remains an unmet medical need for more effective and well tolerated lipid-lowering agents. Guidelines recommend combining additional lipid-lowering agents with a complementary mode of action for these patients. One approach to complementing statin therapy is combination with inhibitors that block the intestinal absorption of dietary and biliary cholesterol. This review summarizes what is currently known about intestinal sterol transporters and cholesterol absorption inhibitors (CAIs).",

It is effective in lowering LDL-C, both when given alone and when combined with a statin. Clinical outcome data with ezetimibe combined with simvastatin have recently become available, and definitive evidence that the incremental LDL-C lowering attributable to the ezetimibe component reduces cardiovascular events beyond simvastatin alone is currently under study. Other novel CAIs have been evaluated based upon the structure and properties of ezetimibe, but none remain in development.",

Total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were significantly decreased by both treatments, but the percent reduction with add-on ezetimibe was significantly greater (p<0.05). High-density lipoprotein cholesterol was significantly increased by both treatments and there was no significant difference between them. The apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A-I ratio and remnant-like particle cholesterol were only significantly decreased by add-on ezetimibe.

    "207": "Kawasaki disease (KD) is acute systemic vasculitis that occurs mainly in infants and children under 5 years of age. The etiology of KD remains unknown. KD is liable to be complicated by coronary artery lesions (CALs), which develop in approximately 15-25% of untreated KD children and in approximately 5% of KD children after intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy. A single high dose of IVIG (2 g/kg) is the gold standard therapy in the acute stage of KD. However, approximately 8--38% of children are unresponsive to initial IVIG treatment and at increased risk for CAL development. Anti-inflammatory high doses of aspirin are recommended in conjunction with IVIG, but our study demonstrated that there is no evidence of efficacy in preventing CAL development. The usefulness of steroids in initial therapy for KD or treatment of IVIG-resistant patients is not well established. Other immunosuppressive therapies, including infliximab, have been used in the treatment of refractory KD, but merit additional investigation. Subclinical atherosclerosis may develop early in KD patients, which makes early initiation of therapy to improve chronic inflammation an important issue. Future multicenter studies may help to define the optimal management of KD patients.", 
    "208": "As healthcare budgets are continuously rising in Europe, governments implement a wide variety of policies to control them. Reference pricing is a popular tool for governments to contain pharmaceutical expenditures, as 22 European countries have implemented this system. This article evaluates the impact of reference-pricing systems on drug use, drug prices, drug expenditure and health outcomes. In addition, two case studies, one for statins and one for proton-pump inhibitors, were carried out. Reference pricing drives down prices of drugs subject to the system and the use of these drugs has increased. Reference pricing creates short-term savings but the long-term growth of drug expenditure has not been reduced by reference pricing. Health outcomes of patients were not negatively affected by the system."
