    "1": "Eighty-two patients with hypercholesterolemia were retrospectively studied before and after 3 months of treatment with pravastatin. Forty-four patients had hypertension (HT group) and were receiving antihypertensive treatment, while the remaining 38 patients were normotensive (NT group). Patients in the HT group were further subdivided into those with uncontrolled or controlled BP. Pravastatin treatment significantly reduced systolic BP (SBP) in the HT group (134+/-16 to 130+/-13 mmHg, p<0.005) but not in the NT group (124+/-10 to 123+/-9 mmHg, p=0.52), despite the fact that treatment significantly reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in both groups (HT group 178+/-27 to 132+/-17 mg/dl, p<0.0001; NT group 169+/-27 to 125+/-21 mg/dl, p<0.0001). Further, pravastatin significantly decreased SBP in the uncontrolled BP group (148+/-7 to 138+/-12 mmHg, p<0.005) but not in the controlled BP group (122+/-10 to 123+/-9 mmHg, p=0.72).",

    "3": "Combination therapy with multiple sclerosis (MS) therapeutics is gaining momentum over monotherapy for improving MS. Lovastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin), was immunomodulatory in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of MS. Lovastatin biases the immune response from Th1 to a protective Th2 response in EAE by a different mechanism than 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-D-ribofuranoside, an immunomodulating agent that activates AMP-activated protein kinase. Here we tested these agents in combination in an EAE model of MS. Suboptimal doses of these drugs in combination were additive in efficacy against the induction of EAE; clinical symptoms were delayed and severity and duration of disease was reduced. In the central nervous system, the cellular infiltration and proinflammatory immune response was decreased while the anti-inflammatory immune response was increased. Combination treatment biased the class of elicited myelin basic protein antibodies from IgG2a to IgG1 and IgG2b, suggesting a shift from Th1 to Th2 response. In addition, combination therapy lessened inflammation-associated neurodegeneration in the central nervous system of EAE animals. These effects were absent in EAE animals treated with either drug alone at the same dose. Thus, our data suggest that agents with different mechanisms of action such as lovastatin and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-beta-D-ribofuranoside, when used in combination, could improve therapy for central nervous system demyelinating diseases and provide a rationale for testing them in MS patients.",

Every CG rat surviving at 24 weeks (4/4) had lung metastasis, against only 5/8 in PG. Moreover, the percentage of lung surface occupied by metastasis was 10-fold smaller in PG than CG (p<0.016). Pravastatin decreased liver matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 activity and mostly suppressed MMP-2 activation (p<0.004), likely because it decreased expression of MMP-14 and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases-2 (p<0.01), required for MMP-2 activation.",

First, we investigated the participation of CHF patients in randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials designed to evaluate the efficacy of statins in reducing major cardiovascular events and mortality. Second, we assessed the association between serum cholesterol and outcome in CHF. Finally, we evaluated the ability of statin treatment to modify surrogate endpoint parameters in CHF. Using validated search strategies, we systematically searched PubMed for our three queries. In addition, we searched the reference lists from eligible studies, used the \"see related articles\" feature for key publications in PubMed, consulted the Cochrane Library, and searched the ISI Web of Knowledge for papers citing key publications. Search 1 resulted in the retrieval of 47 placebo-controlled clinical statin trials involving more than 100,000 patients. CHF patients had, however, been systematically excluded from these trials. Search 2 resulted in the retrieval of eight studies assessing the relationship between cholesterol levels and outcome in CHF patients. Lower serum cholesterol was consistently associated with increased mortality. Search 3 resulted in the retrieval of 18 studies on the efficacy of statin treatment in CHF. On the whole, these studies reported favorable outcomes for almost all surrogate endpoints.",

    "22": "Non-infarct-related coronary arteries of 48 patients with acute myocardial infarction who had undergone successful percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty were examined. Three groups were studied: hyperlipidemia with use of atorvastatin (Group 1, n=17), hyperlipidemia without statin use (Group 2, n=18), and normal cholesterol level controls (Group 3, n=13). Statin treatment was started at discharge. Acetylcholine (Ach) was infused into the coronary artery and the diameter was assessed by quantitative angiography at baseline and after 6 months.",

Pioglitizone (PIO), an insulin sensitizing agent, has been shown to have favorable lipid effects in diabetic patients. Little information is available regarding the effect of combined statin and PIO therapy in non-diabetic patients with the metabolic syndrome. We report our experience of adding PIO to statin therapy in non-diabetic patients with the metabolic syndrome. Pioglitazone was administered to 24 non-diabetic patients in our lipid clinic who were already on a statin yet continued to have significant lipid abnormalities. All patients had characteristic lipid abnormalities and clinical features of the metabolic syndrome. The treatment period was 59+/-29 (range 7-123) weeks. Lipid profiles, fasting glucose, and alanine aminotransferase were assessed before and at least 6 weeks after pioglitazone was added to statin. Triglyceride levels decreased from 307+/-295mg/dL to 173+/-129mg/dL (P=0.003), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL) decreased from 151+/-53mg/dL to 130+/-49mg/dL, (P=0.003), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) levels increased from 42+/-11mg/ dL to 45+/-12mg/dL, (P=0.039). The addition of PIO to statin in non-diabetic patients with metabolic sydrome produced significant additional benefits in the lipid profile over statin monotherapy. Favorable effects were seen in triglycerides, HDL, and non-HDL levels. Study limitations include: this is a small non-blinded observational study in which patients served as their own controls. The duration of combination therapy and type of statin employed were variable.", 
    "26": "Statins, a family of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, are used primarily to reduce atherogenesis and cardiovascular morbidity. Surprisingly, they have also been shown to have immunomodulatory properties that might be of benefit for the treatment of autoimmune disorders. Statins can prevent and even reverse ongoing paralysis in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis--the mouse model for multiple sclerosis--and on the basis of these findings, statins are now being tested in patients with multiple sclerosis in clinical trials.", 
    "27": "Statins inhibit 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, an enzyme crucial to cholesterol synthesis. Drugs of this class reduce the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke, in large part through lipid modulation. Emerging evidence indicates that statins have additional modes of action. These actions, which encompass modification of endothelial function, plaque stability, thrombus formation and inflammatory pathways, are widely referred to as 'pleiotropic effects'. These pleiotropic effects indicate that the therapeutic potential of statins might extend beyond cholesterol lowering and cardiovascular disease to other inflammatory disorders or conditions such as transplantation, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and chronic kidney disease. Experimental and clinical data provide evidence to support these broader applications of statins; however, more large-scale trials are needed to clarify the therapeutic benefit.", 
    "28": "In our study we hypothesized that statins improve endothelial function in patients with lacunar infarctions (LI). Cerebral and systemic endothelial function was determined before and after 3-months treatment with atorvastatin.", 
    "29": "Cerebral endothelial function was determined by L-arginine reactivity and systemic endothelial function by flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) in patients with LI (18 patients, aged 61.1+/-7.6 years), 20 age- and gender-matched patients with similar risk factors (SR) and 19 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. The mean arterial velocity (v(m)) in both middle cerebral arteries was measured by transcranial Doppler sonography before, during and after a 30-minute intravenous infusion of L-arginine. FMD of the brachial artery after hyperaemia was determined. The measurements were repeated after 3-months treatment with 40 mg of atorvastatin per day.",

FMD was more impaired in patients with LI (0.06+/-4.9%) compared with patients with SR and healthy controls (P < or = 0.01). After atorvastatin treatment, L-arginine reactivity and FMD improved in both patients with LI (17.1+/-7.6%; 7.0+/-5.7%) and patients with SR (P < or = 0.01).

We examined risk factors, medications, and prognosis of outpatients with PAD enrolled in two national, prospective, practice-based Canadian registries that encompassed 484 physician practices: the Vascular Protection and Guideline Oriented Approach in Lipid Lowering registries.", 
    "33": "The 2 registries were combined to analyze 9810 patients with vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, or age 65 years or older plus at least 2 additional cardiovascular risk factors. Risk factors, medications, and major cardiovascular events were recorded at baseline and again at 6 months' follow-up.", 
    "34": "Compared with patients without PAD (n = 8303), those with PAD (n = 1507) had substantially worse risk factor profiles and were more likely to have coexisting coronary or cerebrovascular disease. Both groups received high rates of treatment with evidence-based therapies, including antiplatelet drugs, statins, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Despite this, patients with PAD had a nearly twofold higher risk of major cardiovascular events at 6 months than non-PAD patients (7.3% vs 4.1%; P < .0001). After adjustment for multiple confounding factors, the presence of PAD at baseline continued to predict a heightened risk of adverse vascular sequelae (odds ratio, 1.54; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-2.01; P < .0001).", 
    "35": "These data support a strong relationship between PAD and worsened vascular prognosis that is independent of both conventional vascular risk factors and concomitant cardiovascular disease. The presence of PAD should therefore provide a clear impetus for intensive risk factor modification and use of preventive medical therapy in affected patients.", 
    "36": "Sepsis continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Evidence is emerging from observational studies and basic science research that statins (3-hydroxy, 3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A [HMG CoA] reductase inhibitors) might be associated with reduced mortality in sepsis. Statins have become the most widely used drugs for lowering serum cholesterol levels, being used by at least 15% of patients requiring admission to hospital, and this number is growing each year. Current prescribing information suggests withholding statin therapy in acutely ill patients for fear of serious side effects. However, statins have been postulated to have beneficial effects independent of their lipid-lowering effects, including anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory roles. This review discusses the basis of these observations and the current place of statin therapy in patients with sepsis. This is a rapidly growing field of fascinating experimental biology. It suggests an urgent need to investigate the pharmacology of these drugs and reappraise their therapeutic indications in critically ill patients. This may provide new insights into the role of lipids and the endothelium in sepsis. Statins are significantly cheaper than other therapies that have been shown to improve outcome in sepsis, and the demonstration of a mortality benefit would have enormous cost-benefit implications.", 
    "37": "Recent studies have described the incidence (approximately one in eight high-risk patients will experience a further atherothrombotic event over a 2-year period) of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) resistance and its possible background. The aim of this study was to compare the characteristics (risk profile, previous diseases, medications and haemorrheological variables) of patients in whom aspirin provided effective platelet inhibition with those in whom aspirin was not effective in providing platelet inhibition.", 
    "38": "599 patients with chronic cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases (355 men, mean age 64 +/- 11 years; 244 women, mean age 63 +/- 10 years) taking aspirin 100-325 mg/day were included in the study. Blood was collected between 8:00am and 9:00am from these patients after an overnight fast. The cardiovascular risk profiles, history of previous diseases, medication history and haemorrheological parameters of patients who responded to aspirin and those who did not were compared. Platelet and red blood cell (RBC) aggregation were measured by aggregometry, haematocrit by a microhaematocrit centrifuge, and plasma fibrinogen by Clauss' method. Plasma and whole blood viscosities were measured using a capillary viscosimeter.", 
    "39": "Compared with aspirin-resistant patients, patients who demonstrated effective aspirin inhibition had a significantly lower plasma fibrinogen level (3.3 g/L vs 3.8 g/L; p < 0.05) and significantly lower RBC aggregation values (24.3 vs 28.2; p < 0.01). In addition, significantly more patients with effective aspirin inhibition were hypertensive (80% vs 62%; p < 0.05). Patients who had effective platelet aggregation were significantly more likely to be taking beta-adrenoceptor antagonists (75% vs 55%; p < 0.05) and ACE inhibitors (70% vs 50%; p < 0.05), whereas patients with ineffective platelet aggregation were significantly more likely to be taking HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) [52% vs 38%; p < 0.05]. Use of statins remained an independent predictor of aspirin resistance even after adjustment for risk factors and medication use (odds ratio 5.92; 95% CI 1.83, 16.9; p < 0.001).", 
    "40": "The mechanisms underlying aspirin resistance are multifactorial. Higher fibrinogen concentrations increase RBC aggregation and can also result in increased platelet aggregation. The higher rate of hypertension in patients with effective platelet aggregation on aspirin could explain the differences in beta-adrenoceptor antagonist and ACE inhibitor use between these patients and aspirin-resistant patients. Furthermore, an additive effect of these drugs may contribute to effective antiplatelet therapy. It is also possible that drug interactions with statins might reduce aspirin bioavailability and/or activity, thereby reducing platelet inhibition in aspirin-resistant patients.", 
    "41": "Statins slow atherosclerosis progression and can even induce atherosclerosis regression. The reduction of cardiovascular events with statins by approximately one-third demonstrates not only their clinical efficacy but also the unmet clinical need. The aging of the population and the epidemics of the metabolic syndrome and diabetes contribute to the increasing burden of atherosclerosis in society, and fuel the need for novel complementary therapies to further improve clinical outcomes. Some targets, such as acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase inhibition, have yielded disappointing clinical results. In contrast, there is strong evidence linking lower high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels and greater cardiovascular risk, thus providing the rationale for targeting HDL in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Therapeutic approaches include direct infusions of HDL cholesterol or HDL-mimetic agents, as well as the inhibition of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP). CETP inhibition appears to be one particularly promising strategy. The CETP inhibitor torcetrapib increases plasma HDL cholesterol levels by 40% to 60%, while modestly decreasing low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Combining the HDL cholesterol-elevating properties of a CETP inhibitor with the LDL cholesterol-lowering properties of a statin may offer improved outcomes over targeting LDL cholesterol alone. This hypothesis is being extensively evaluated in a comprehensive program that involves several imaging studies and a large-scale clinical end point trial. The additional cardiovascular protection required for patients with atherosclerosis or risk equivalents will likely be provided by therapies that go beyond LDL reduction.", 
    "42": "The Rho family of guanine 5'-triphosphatases (GTPases) play a key role in regulating cell proliferation, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and glomerular hemodynamics. The post-translational prenylation of RhoGTPases by the addition of a geranylgeranyl moiety is critical for cellular localization and signaling activity. This study investigates the effects of (i) inhibiting geranylgeranylation (GG) in human mesangial cell (HMC) proliferation and apoptosis, using GGTI 298, a specific inhibitor of GG and (ii) lovastatin, an HMG-coacetyl A-reductase inhibitor, which depletes the availability of prenylation substrates. HMC proliferation was assessed using an assay of viable cell number and measuring bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation. Hoechst 33342 staining was used to determine apoptosis. Extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (Erk)1/2 and Akt activation were analysed by Western blotting. Rho activation was determined using the Rhotekin pull-down assay. Immunocytochemistry was performed to study the effects on the actin cytoskeleton and RhoA localization. GGTI 298 (10-20 muM) and lovastatin (5-10 muM) potently inhibited platelet-derived growth factor and serum-stimulated HMC proliferation and induced apoptosis. These effects of lovastatin were attenuated by co-incubation with geranylgeranylpyrophosphate. C3 exoenzyme, a clostridial toxin that specifically targets Rho also inhibited BrdU incorporation and promoted apoptosis. GGTI 298 increased cytosolic expression of RhoA, prevented RhoA activation, and inhibited the activation of Erk1/2 and the survival protein Akt. GGTI 298, lovastatin, and C3 exoenzyme inhibit HMC proliferation and promote apoptosis. Inhibiting GG increases cytosolic RhoA expression, disrupts the actin cytoskeleton, and inhibits RhoA activation. These results suggest that targeting geranylgeranylated proteins with statins or GGTI 298 is a promising therapeutic strategy in human mesangioproliferative renal disease.", 
    "43": "A pooled analysis was designed to evaluate the effects of fluvastatin on the kidney, in terms of renal adverse events, laboratory abnormalities, and renal function over time. An analysis of adverse events was performed on data from 30 completed clinical trials of fluvastatin in 11,815 patients. An analysis of renal function was also performed on data from patients who participated in long-term studies >6 months in treatment duration. Creatinine clearance was calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula. Mean creatinine clearance values were in the normal to near-normal range at baseline. Changes in creatinine clearance and serum creatinine from baseline were similar in fluvastatin-treated patients and placebo-treated patients. In the all-fluvastatin group, mean creatinine clearance (+/-standard deviation) increased from 87.8 (+/-42.8) mL/min at baseline to 89.4 (+/-41.2) mL/min at endpoint. In the placebo group, mean creatinine clearance (+/- standard deviation) increased from 87.7 (+/- 43.9) mL/min at baseline to 88.7 (+/-41.4) mL/min at endpoint. In the all-fluvastatin group, mean serum creatinine (+/- standard deviation) decreased from 1.14 (+/-0.20) mg/dL at baseline to 1.11 (+/-0.20) mg/dL at endpoint. In the placebo group, mean serum creatinine (+/-standard deviation) decreased from 1.15 (+/-0.22) mg/dL at baseline to 1.12 (+/-0.22) mg/dL at endpoint. The incidence of renal adverse events was low and comparable between the fluvastatin and placebo treatment groups. This pooled analysis demonstrates that fluvastatin treatment across the approved daily dose range of 20 mg to 80 mg does not adversely affect creatinine or creatinine clearance over time in dyslipidemic patients.", 
    "44": "Statins reduce coronary heart disease risk by altering blood lipids and other mechanisms. One of the possible other mechanisms is through an effect on thrombosis. We assessed the effect of simvastatin 80 mg daily versus placebo given in a single blind crossover fashion on platelet size in response to standard ex vivo stimuli, a surrogate for platelet activation, in 12 subjects with type 2 diabetes and mixed dyslipidemia. Exposure to collagen, cold, and heat caused the expected changes in platelet volume. Contrary to our expectations, ex vivo platelet size during collagen and cold exposure increased by 2.6 and 1.7%, respectively (P < 0.05), during simvastatin treatment as opposed to the placebo period. We conclude that some of the effects of high dose simvastatin therapy on platelets may not necessarily be anti-atherogenic.", 
    "45": "Although the effectiveness of statins is well established, analyses of spontaneous adverse event reports have recently questioned the safety of rosuvastatin.", 
    "46": "We evaluated the risks and benefits of rosuvastatin and compared it with other statins presently on the market. Information was obtained from a search of medical and scientific literature that produced 3001 entries, of which 591 publications containing particularly relevant data were identified, and from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Events Reporting System (AERS) and Spontaneous Reporting System through June 30, 2004. For the AERS data and to control for overreporting in the first postmarketing year and the effect on reporting due to the withdrawal of cerivastatin in 2001, we used the rate of a given adverse event among all adverse events as a measure of risk. We found that adverse effects of rosuvastatin in skeletal muscle, liver, and kidney function did not substantially differ in frequency from those reported for those of other statins in the market in 2004, except for the uncommon development of a mild form of presumably \"tubular\" proteinuria at doses of 40 mg/day or greater. In contrast, cerivastatin had significantly higher rates of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis than rosuvastatin's, but there was no additional effect on renal failure beyond that mediated through rhabdomyolysis. From our literature review, we found that rosuvastatin reduces abnormal lipids on a milligram-per-milligram comparison more than atorvastatin.", 
    "47": "We conclude that rosuvastatin at approved doses incurs no greater risk for adverse events than other marketed statins, except for a mild form of tubular proteinuria when doses at or above the maximum recommended levels (> or = 40 mg/day) were administered. Its risk-benefit ratio is acceptable when compared with other statins on the market in 2006.", 
    "48": "The pharmacological regulation of lipid metabolism in patients with dyslipidaemia is unequivocally associated with significant reductions in risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. There is strong clinical trial data to support of the use of statin therapies in the settings of both primary and secondary prevention. This paper addresses: i) the mechanisms of action of antilipidaemic medications; ii) dosing regimens and the pharmacokinetic differences among drugs of the same class; iii) risk for drug interactions; and iv) reviews the clinical trial evidence used to support the use of particular antilipidaemic medications in specific physiological settings.", 
    "49": "The paper presents an analysis of correlations between long-term results of coronary arterial stenting and anticholesterol therapy with statins in 131 patients with chronic forms of coronary heart disease. The study revealed that anticholesterol therapy, when administered regardless the initial cholesterol level, improved the clinical condition of patients with initial hypercholesterolemia, and lowered the necessity of repeated endovascular procedures for restenosis and the progression of atherosclerotic changes. The necessity of repeated interventions is lowered by statin application rather than by normal levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoproteins.", 
    "50": "Cholesterol-reducing statin drugs are the most frequently prescribed agents for reducing morbidity and mortality related to coronary heart disease. In this publication a validated, highly sensitive, and selective isocratic HPLC method is reported for quantitative determination of the major statin drug atorvastatin (ATV) and its metabolite 2-hydroxyatorvastatin (HATV). Detection was performed with an electrospray ionization triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an ESI interface operating in positive-ionization mode. Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) was used for MS-MS detection. The calibration plot was linear in the concentration range 0.10-40.00 ng mL(-1) for both ATV and HATV. Inter-day and intra-day precision and accuracy of the proposed method were characterized by measurement of relative standard deviation (RSD) and percentage deviation, respectively; both were less than 8% for both analytes. The limit of quantitation was 0.02 ng mL(-1) for ATV and 0.07 ng mL(-1) for HATV. The method was used for pharmacokinetic study of ATV and HATV. Pharmacokinetic data for all analytes are also reported.",

We set out to identify whether there was a correlation between disease activity and levels of different lipid fractions in a stable population of patients with rheumatoid arthritis on disease-modifying therapy.", 
    "52": "Patients with rheumatoid arthritis were selected from our database and requested to have inflammatory markers and a fasting lipid profile taken at their next visit for monitoring of their disease modifying therapy.", 
    "53": "204 patients were recruited for the study. A statistically significant relationship exists between reduced HDL and elevated CRP (p=0.01) and ESR (p=0.041). Elevated ESR, but not elevated CRP, was associated with raised LDL cholesterol (p=0.014). Fourteen patients (6.8%) were receiving statin therapy and 71 (34.8%) were taking prednisone. Use of prednisone, independent of dose, was associated with elevated triglyceride levels (p=0.041).", 
    "54": "This study supports previous work showing that rheumatoid arthritis is associated with an adverse lipid profile. While good disease control is clearly important, we should not neglect management of traditional cardiovascular risk factors.", 
    "55": "This 48-year-old man with possible underlying myopathy was successfully treated with ezetimibe 10 mg/day and rosuvastatin 5 mg every other day for 17 months. Three weeks before presentation, he began drinking pomegranate juice (200 ml twice weekly). He presented urgently with thigh pain and an elevated serum creatine kinase level (138,030 U/L, normal < 200 U/L). In conclusion, because both grapefruit and pomegranate juice are known to inhibit intestinal cytochrome P450 3A4, this report suggests that pomegranate juice may increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis during rosuvastatin treatment, despite the fact that rosuvastatin is not known to be metabolized by hepatic P450 3A4.", 
    "56": "Although increased cholesterol levels predict mortality in patients with coronary artery disease, it is unclear whether hypercholesterolemia is associated with adverse survival in patients with heart failure. A cohort of subjects derived from the Intermountain Heart Collaborative Study Registry (1993 to 2003) who had ejection fractions < or = 40% or clinical diagnoses of heart failure and long-term follow-up for death were studied (n = 1,646). Total cholesterol (TC) was divided into quartiles: quartile 1, < 141.3 mg/dl; quartile 2, 141.3 to 167.9 mg/dl; quartile 3, 168.0 to 201.0 mg/dl; and quartile 4, > 201.0 mg/dl. Multivariate Cox regression models were used to evaluate the associations of cholesterol, statin therapy, and C-reactive protein to mortality. The mean age was 65.5 years; 65% of the subjects were men and 65% had coronary artery disease. Although 53% were using statins, statin use was not different across TC quartiles. Average time to death was 2.4 years (maximum 10). Mortality for quartile 4 versus quartile 1 was not different (hazard ratio [HR] 1.12, p = 0.52); mortality was reduced for quartile 3 versus quartile 1 (HR 0.66, p = 0.027) and tended to be reduced for quartile 2 versus quartile 1 (HR 0.77, p = 0.14). Subanalysis of patients not using statins (n = 737, death = 20.2%) found no association between TC and survival (for quartile 3 vs quartile 1, HR 0.97, p = 0.89), but for patients using statins (n = 848, death = 16.3%), the effect was even greater for quartile 3 versus quartile 1 (HR 0.40, p = 0.002) than in the overall population. Nonsurvivors had higher levels of C-reactive protein than survivors. In conclusion, elevated TC appears to be associated with improved survival. The effect was stronger in patients receiving statin therapy, but the cause of this differential effect is uncertain.", 
    "57": "1. The present study was designed to determine whether pravastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, could attenuate acute lung injury (ALI) induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in BALB/c mice. 2. Acute lung injury was induced successfully by intratracheal administraiton of LPS (3 microg/g) in BALB/c mice. Pravastatin (3, 10 and 30 mg/kg, i.p.) was administered to mice 24 h prior to and then again concomitant with LPS exposure. 3. Challenge with LPS alone produced a significant increase in lung index and the wet/dry weight ratio compared with control animals. Pulmonary microvascular leakage, as indicated by albumin content in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and extravasation of Evans blue dye albumin into lung tissue, was apparently increased in LPS-exposed mice. Lipopolysaccharide exposure also produced a significant lung inflammatory response, reflected by myeloperoxidase activity and inflammatory cell counts in BALF. Furthermore, histological examination showed that mice exposed to LPS also exhibited prominent inflammatory cell infiltration and occasional alveolar haemorrhage. 4. Pravastatin (3, 10 or 30 mg/kg, i.p.) produced a significant reduction in multiple indices of LPS-induced pulmonary vascular leak and inflammatory cell infiltration into lung tissue. Elevated tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha levels in lung tissue homogenates of ALI mice were significantly decreased after administration of 10 or 30 mg/kg pravastatin. 5. These findings confirm significant protection by pravastatin against LPS-induced lung vascular leak and inflammation and implicate a potential role for statins in the management of ALI. The inhibitory effect of pravastatin was associated with its effect in decreasing TNF-alpha.",

    "62": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have now become one of the most powerful pharmacological strategies in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Originally, the cardioprotective effects of statins were thought to be mediated through lipid lowering actions. However, it has now become increasingly clear that the beneficial effects of statins are not related to the lipid lowering effects, but rather to a number of pleiotropic actions. Of particular interest, statins have been shown to increase bioavailability of nitric oxide and protect against vascular inflammation and cardiac cell death in a number of cardiovascular disease states. In this present issue of the British Journal of Pharmacology, Zhao and colleagues provide a novel mechanism of action for statins with the observation that simvastatin reduces myocardial 'no-reflow' after ischemia and reperfusion by activating the mitochondrial K(ATP) channel. The findings of the present study have very profound implications for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. This commentary discusses the implications of these findings and how they relate to the established cardioprotective actions of statins.", 
    "63": "Patients with systemic lupus erythematosus develop accelerated atherosclerosis independent of traditional risk factors. The 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors are widely prescribed for hyperlipidemia, but they also exhibit anti-inflammatory actions that appear to be independent of their suppressive actions on plasma cholesterol levels. In this study, we analyzed the effect of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin on disease manifestations in gld.apoE-/- mice that lack functional Fas ligand and apolipoprotein E and exhibit accelerated atherosclerosis and aggravated lupus-like features. Wild-type, gld, apoE-/-, and gld.apoE-/- mice were maintained on a high cholesterol Western diet and received daily simvastatin (0.125 mg/kg) or saline for 12 wk. Serum cholesterol levels were unaffected by simvastatin treatment, but atherosclerotic lesion area was reduced in both apoE-/- and gld.apoE-/- mice treated with simvastatin. Simvastatin also reduced the lymphadenopathy, renal disease, and proinflammatory cytokine production seen in gld.apoE-/-, but not gld, mice. The immunomodulatory effects in gld.apoE-/- mice were associated with enhanced STAT6 and decreased STAT4 induction in submandibular lymph node cells. Along with reductions in serum TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma levels, there was also an increase in IL-4 and IL-10 transcript levels in lymph nodes. These data indicate that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors ameliorate atherosclerosis and lupus-like autoimmunity independent of their cholesterol-lowering effects via a shift from a Th1 to a Th2 phenotype in the gld.apoE-/- model. Thus, the anti-inflammatory activities of statins may have utility for the treatment of both autoimmunity and atherosclerosis in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.", 
    "64": "The bioequivalence of combination tablets containing amlodipine besylate/atorvastatin calcium with coadministered matching doses of amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium tablets was investigated in randomized, 2-way crossover studies in healthy volunteers (N = 126). Subjects received a single dose of the amlodipine/atorvastatin tablet or coadministered matching doses of amlodipine and atorvastatin at the highest (10/80 mg; n = 62) and lowest (5/10 mg; n = 64) dose strengths. Atorvastatin geometric mean ratios for maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) for the highest and lowest dose strengths were 94.1 and 98.8, and 104.5 and 103.8, respectively. Amlodipine geometric mean ratios for C(max) and AUC for the highest and lowest dose strengths were 100.8 and 103.4, and 100 and 102.7, respectively. The 90% confidence intervals for all comparisons were within 80% to 125%, demonstrating bioequivalence for amlodipine and atorvastatin at both dose strengths.

We therefore aimed to establish whether use of evidence-based multidrug regimens for patients at high risk for cardiovascular disease would be cost-effective in low-income and middle-income countries.", 
    "66": "We used a Markov model to do a cost-effectiveness analysis with two combination regimens. For primary prevention, we used aspirin, a calcium-channel blocker, an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor, and a statin, and assessed them in four groups with different thresholds of absolute risks for cardiovascular disease. For secondary prevention, we assessed the same combination of drugs in one group, but substituted a beta blocker for the calcium-channel blocker. To compare strategies, we report incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER), in US dollars per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).", 
    "67": "We recorded that preventive strategies could result in a 2-year gain in life expectancy. Across six developing World Bank regions, primary prevention yielded ICERs of US746-890 dollars/QALY gained for patients with a 10-year absolute risk of cardiovascular disease greater than 25%, and 1039-1221 dollars/QALY gained for those with an absolute risk greater than 5%. ICERs for secondary prevention ranged from 306 dollars/QALY to 388 dollars/QALY gained.", 
    "68": "Regimens of aspirin, two blood-pressure drugs, and a statin could halve the risk of death from cardiovascular disease in high-risk patients. This approach is cost-effective according to WHO recommendations, and is robust across several estimates of drug efficacy and of treatment cost. Developing countries should encourage the use of these inexpensive drugs that are currently available for both primary and secondary prevention.", 
    "69": "One response of the brain to stressors is to increase microglial activation with the consequent production of proinflammatory cytokines like interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), which has been shown to exert an inhibitory effect on long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus. It has been consistently shown, particularly in vitro, that amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides increase activation of microglia, while its inhibitory effect on LTP is well documented, and associated with the Abeta-induced increase in IL-1beta. Here we set out to establish whether the Abeta-induced inhibition of LTP in perforant path-granule cell synapses, was coupled with evidence of microglial activation and to assess whether atorvastatin, which is used primarily in the treatment of hyperlipidaemia but which possesses anti-inflammatory properties, might modulate the effect of Abeta on LTP. We report that intracerebroventricular injection of Abeta increased expression of several markers of microglial activation, and in parallel, inhibited LTP in dentate gyrus. The data show that atorvastatin abrogated the Abeta-induced microglial activation and the associated deficit in LTP. On the basis of the evidence presented, we propose that the action of atorvastatin is mediated by its ability to increase production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-4, which we report mimics several of the actions of atorvastatin in the rat hippocampus.", 
    "70": "Statins have been shown to have pleiotropic effects apart from serum lipid-lowering effect in human. One of the major target organs for the effects of statins is the vascular endothelium, which plays an important role in the development of atherosclerosis and angiogenesis. Recent numerous studies have shown that the statins' cholesterol-independent vascular effects appear to involve directly restoring or improving endothelial function by increasing NO production, promoting re-endothelialization after arterial injury, and inhibiting inflammatory responses within the vessel wall that are thought to contribute to atherosclerosis. This review provides an update of the unique effects of statins on endothelial cells including endothelial progenitor cells as well as highlighting the therapeutic potential of statins beyond their established lipid-lowering effects.", 
    "71": "In order to calculate the structural and compositional characteristics of microemulsions, used as eluents in the investigation of HPLC separation of simvastatin and its six impurities, predictive molecular thermodynamic approach is developed. For calculating fundamental interfacial properties of microemulsions, from pure component properties, the lattice fluid self-consistent field theory (SCF), in conjunction with new classical thermodynamic expressions, was applied. Calculation of predicted radii (PR), area per surfactant (ApS) and film thickness (FT), as well as is interfacial tension and bending moment enabled better understanding of separation of such a complex mixture. The microemulsion, which contained 1% (w/w) of diisopropyl ether, 2% (w/w) of sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), 6.6% (w/w) of co-surfactant such as n-butanol and 90.4% (w/w) of aqueous 25 mM disodium phosphate pH 7.0 enabled appropriate chromatographic separation between investigated compounds. It has been proved that this microemulsion had the smallest droplet radii and film thickness, which enabled optimal separation. Also the interfacial tension is the smallest, so the free energy change associated with dispersing the drops favoured a large number of small droplets. Hydrophobic interactions between solutes and stationary phase, as well as the microstructural characteristics of microemulsion eluents had a significant influence on chromatographic behavior of simvastatin and its six impurities.", 
    "72": "Statins, inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, elicit various actions on vascular cells including the modulation of proliferation and migration of smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Here, we have elucidated the mechanism by which statins, in particular pitavastatin, attenuate the migration activity of SMCs. The expression of LR11, a member of the LDL receptor family and an enhancer of cell surface localization of urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), is increased in cultured SMCs by treatment with PDGF-BB. Pitavastatin attenuates the PDGF-BB -induced surface expression of LR11 and uPAR. The increased migration of SMCs observed both upon overexpression of LR11 and via stimulation of secretion of soluble LR11 is not reversed by pitavastatin. In vivo studies showed that the SMCs expressing LR11 in plaques are almost congruent with intimal cells expressing nonmuscle myosin heavy chain (SMemb). Pitavastatin reduced the expression of LR11 and SMemb, and the levels of LR11, uPAR, and SMemb in cultured intimal SMCs were reduced to those seen in medial SMCs. We propose that this statin reduces PDGF-induced migration through the attenuation of the LR11/uPAR system in SMCs. Modulation of the LR11/uPAR system with statins suggests a novel treatment strategy for atherogenesis based on suppression of intimal SMC migration.",

At a typical dose of 4 capsules/day, Omacor significantly lowers plasma triglyceride levels either as monotherapy or in combination with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) or fibrates. Omacor also modestly increases plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and has favorable effects on lipoprotein particle size and subclass distribution. Omacor is well tolerated, with few side effects other than mild gastrointestinal symptoms. Hyperglycemia, abnormal bleeding, elevations in muscle or liver enzymes, and/or abnormalities in kidney or nerve function have not been reported. Through its intensive purification process, Omacor has minimal \"fishy\" smell and taste, and it has not been reported to cause hypervitaminosis or illness due to exposure to environmental toxins. Omacor provides a safe, effective, well-tolerated approach to management of hypertriglyceridemia.", 
    "74": "Combined dyslipidemia is the concurrent presence of multiple abnormalities in various lipid subfractions, including elevated concentrations of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglycerides (TGs), as well as decreased concentrations of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. The Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) guidelines of the US National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) lowered the cut points for classification of TG levels, established non-HDL cholesterol levels as a secondary target of therapy in patients with TGs of >or=2.26 mmol/L (200 mg/dL), and defined the metabolic syndrome as a secondary target of therapy. Although 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) are first-line therapy for most patients with elevated LDL cholesterol, statin monotherapy may not be sufficient to achieve recommended non-HDL cholesterol goals, and statins have only modest effects on reducing TG levels. Similarly, patients whose TG levels remain elevated despite treatment with a TG-lowering agent may require the addition of a statin to provide further TG reduction. In addition, statin therapy may be needed to offset the secondary increase in levels of LDL cholesterol that frequently results from treatment with a TG-lowering agent in patients with marked hypertriglyceridemia. In a number of small studies, the combination of statins and omega-3 fatty acids has been consistently shown to be an effective, safe, and well-tolerated treatment for combined dyslipidemia. Patients with recent myocardial infarction may also benefit from this combination. When considering risks and benefits of adding a second agent to statins for treatment of combined dyslipidemia, omega-3 fatty acids provide additional lipid improvements without requiring additional laboratory tests and do not increase risk for adverse muscle or liver effects.", 
    "75": "Atherosclerosis is a slow, complex process involving many different cell types and their interactions producing excessive oxidant stress, increased inflammation, abnormal endothelium-dependent vasodilation, and localized increases in thrombogenic and decreases in fibrinolytic factors. Numerous factors incite these processes, but oxidized LDL particles seem the most essential component of this pathologic cascade. These oxidized particles set up a chain of biochemical events eventually leading to clinical atherosclerotic events. Statins have been shown to reduce such events by 40 to 50% when LDL cholesterol is lowered to less than 80 mg/dL. But in-vitro studies have shown that the provision of mevalonate, not cholesterol, can result in reversal of some of the beneficial effects of statins, suggesting that other mechanisms such as inhibiting the formation of the isoprenoids, farnesyl pyrophosphate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, and thus prenylation of many cell-signaling proteins may be important in the preventive effects of statins. Clinically, these more rapid, non-lipid-altering effects may be more apparent in acute coronary syndromes. Now that we have more LDL-cholesterol lowering agents which lower LDL-cholesterol without blocking HMG CoA reductase, we may be better able to dissect and understand the importance of these non-lipid-altering effects of statins in human disease.", 
    "76": "A low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol goal of less than 100 mg/dl is recommended for patients at moderate to high risk of cardiovascular disease with an optional LDL goal of less than 70 mg/dl for patients at a very high risk of cardiovascular disease. Most patients will require reductions in LDL of more than 50% in order to achieve these more aggressive goals. Only a few agents will lower LDL by at least 50%. This review will focus on the efficacy and safety ezetimibe/simvastatin coadministered as a therapy with enhanced LDL-lowering efficacy, while minimizing the adverse effects of statins in a wide range of patients. Ezetimibe 10 mg/simvastatin 80 mg lowers LDL by approximately 60% and has been demonstrated to be superior to the highest doses of atorvastatin and rosuvastatin for lowering LDL and raising high-density lipoprotein.", 
    "77": "Pravastatin is mainly taken up from the circulation into the liver via organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1 (SLCO1B1 gene product). We examined the contribution of genetic variants in the SLCO1B1 gene and other candidate genes to the variability of pravastatin efficacy in 33 hypercholesterolemic patients. In the initial phase of pravastatin treatment (8 weeks), heterozygous carriers of the SLCO1B1*15 allele had poor low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction relative to non-carriers (percent reduction: -14.1 vs -28.9%); however, the genotype-dependent difference in the cholesterol-lowering effect disappeared after 1 year of treatment. Cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and apolipoprotein E (APOE) are known to contribute to lipid metabolism. Homozygous carriers of the CYP7A1 -204C allele or heterozygotes for both CYP7A1 -204C and APOE epsilon4 alleles showed significantly poorer LDL-C reduction compared to that in other genotypic groups after 1 year of treatment (-24.3 vs -33.1%). These results suggest that the SLCO1B1*15 allele is associated with a slow response to pravastatin therapy, and the combined genotyping of CYP7A1 and APOE genes is a useful index of the lipid-lowering effect of pravastatin.",

    "81": "Despite advances in the treatment of multiple myeloma, it remains an incurable disease because of primary and secondary drug resistance. Mevalonate pathway inhibitors like bisphosphonates and statins have antimyeloma activity in vitro at very high concentrations, which may probably not be reached in vivo. NCI-H929, OPM-2, U266 and RPMI-8226 myeloma cell lines were treated in the presence or absence of bone marrow stromal cells with simvastatin or zoledronate in combination with classical antimyeloma drugs like melphalan or bortezomib. Zoledronate did not show substantial antimyeloma activity at low and intermediate concentrations, whereas simvastatin potently induced apoptosis in myeloma cells without signs of primary, cell-adhesion-mediated drug resistance. Furthermore, sequential blockage of the mevalonate pathway by zoledronate and simvastatin demonstrated synergistic induction of apoptosis and reversal of cell-adhesion-mediated drug resistance. Our data provide a rationale for combining zoledronate and simvastatin with classical antimyeloma drugs.",

    "87": "Flaxseed (Linum usitatissimum L.) is a major source of dietary intake of lignans by virtue of the high concentrations (0.7-1.5%) that are present in the seed. The principal lignan present in flaxseed is secoisolariciresinol diglucoside (SDG), which occurs as a component of a linear ester-linked complex in which the C6-OH of the glucose of SDG is esterified to the carboxylic acid of hydroxymethylglutaric acid. Also present in flaxseed and in resulting lignan extracts are significant quantities of 2 cinnamic acid glycosides. Our emerging understanding of the biological activity of flax lignans is based on studies using a variety of materials ranging from whole ground seed to pure SDG. The underlying assumption of most of these studies is that the biological activity of flax lignans results from their conversion to the mammalian lignans enterolactone (EL) and enterodiol (ED). There are, however, several intermediate compounds generated during the digestion and metabolism of flax lignans, including SDG and its aglycones and secoisolariciresinol (Seco), that are good candidates to be the principal bioactive molecule. This review will document the history of the development of lignan analytical methods and illustrate how analytical methods have influenced the interpretation of animal and human trials and our understanding of the biological activity of flax lignans.",

In randomized trials of secondary and primary prevention, and their meta-analyses, statins confer statistically significant, clinically important reductions in myocardial infarction, stroke, and CVD death. In 2001, the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III included LDL as the primary target, recommending optional goals of < 100 mg/dL for high-risk patients, < 130 mg/dL for moderate-risk patients, and < 160 mg/dL for low-risk patients. We conducted a search of randomized trials of statins whose results were published since May 15, 2001. We extracted overall trial results and data on adverse events, when available. We reviewed 7 published trials of statins, some of which contributed to the recent addendum to the NCEP ATP III guidelines that recommend reducing LDL goals to < 70 for very high-risk and < 100 for moderately high-risk patients via statins. Data from these trials demonstrate that greater LDL reductions produce larger CVD benefits in various categories of high- and moderate-risk patients, including a large number of primary prevention patients with metabolic syndrome who should be treated as aggressively as patients who have survived a myocardial infarction or stroke. Together, these recent statin trials and the NCEP ATP III revised guidelines, if implemented by primary healthcare providers, would result in many more patients receiving statins of proven benefit and reassuring adverse event profile.",

Liver dysfunction induced by statins is rare and usually mild, with asymptomatic transaminase elevation or acute cholecystitis. Progression to liver failure is exceedingly rare, and transaminase elevations is usually reversible with dose reduction. Statin-associated myopathy is generally a concern when patients have more than one risk factor for muscle syndromes, such as an elderly patient with poor renal function.

Monacolin K (a secondary metabolite of Monascus, a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase) in inhibition of mevalonate synthesis may result in reductions of isoprenoid prenylation in cells. Impairment of protein isoprenoid prenylation has been related to anticancer effect in cancer cells. As a functional food for Monascus, however, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the anti-proliferate effect of monacolin K in cancer cells are not clear. We used proteomic analysis by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight/time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF MS), tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), and database interrogation to separate and identify the proteins of Caco-2 cells treated with monacolin K. The results showed that monacolin K inhibited the proliferation of Caco-2 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The identified proteins in proteomic analysis included anti-oxidation enzymes related to reactive oxygen species stress, cytoskeleton proteins, glycolytic enzymes, and enzymes involved in mediating protein interactions. Furthermore, glutathione S-transferase P 1 and cytoskeleton-8, -18, and -19 revealed a down-regulation in a dose-dependent manner in exposure of Caco-2 cells to monacolin K.", 
    "104": "Cardiovascular prevention should only be considered if the treatment reduces the incidence of coronary and cerebrovascular events and death. In elderly people, such treatment should also, and most importantly, help maintain a good quality of life, without increasing the risk of iatrogenic side-effects. These key-elements should be kept in mind when prescription of a statin is envisaged in the old (> 70 years) and especially the very old (> 80 years) individual. Randomised controlled trials in people above 70 years are rather rare. In the field of cardiovascular prevention, two studies provide information, on post-hoc analysis of the Heart Protection Study (HPS) with simvastatin and the PROSPER trial with pravastatin. The protection observed in the general population of HPS was also present in the subgroup of subjects aged above 70, both for coronary and cardiovascular events. The difference was less impressive in PROSPER, without any significant difference as far as the incidence of stroke was concerned. None of these two prospective trials provide specific data on individuals above 80. Interestingly, some experimental and epidemiological observations suggested that statins may prevent Alzheimer disease. However, the data from HPS and PROSPER are not convincing in this respect. Thus, results from new ongoing trials should be awaited, especially in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease. Finally, it is noteworthy that low serum cholesterol level can be used as a marker of poor nutrition in very old people. Such condition is rather common, especially among institutionalised subjects, and is usually associated with a higher risk of morbidity and mortality.", 
    "105": "Several studies have shown that increased levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol predict cardiovascular events. The Adult Treatment Panel II (ATP II) introduced the principle of therapeutic lifestyle changes, including plant sterols/stanols for the management of LDL cholesterol. Plant sterols and stanols in fat matrices effectively lower LDL cholesterol levels in hypercholesterolemic, diabetic, and healthy human volunteers. Recent studies also show that sterols (2 g/d) lower LDL cholesterol even when incorporated in nonfat matrices. In addition, they may reduce biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation. Plant sterols and stanols exert their hypocholesterolemic effects possibly by interfering with the uptake of both dietary and biliary cholesterol from the intestinal tract. Present evidence is accumulating to promote their use for lowering LDL cholesterol levels, as a first line of therapy (as well as adjunctive therapy) in patients on statin therapy.", 
    "106": "Besides the action on plasma lipid levels, statins show a series of ancillary effects defined as all of their vascular and nonvascular effects independent from the cholesterol reduction. It has been recently hypothesized that one of these ancillary effects could be the improvement of bone health, due to the interference with bone metabolism. This may potentially represent the rationale for statins' use in the treatment of osteoporosis, the most common disease of the bone. Both experimental observations and clinical studies on this topic generated a number of conflicting results; however, the largest randomized clinical trials, the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S), Long Term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischemic Disease (LIPID), and Heart Protection Study (HPS), indicate that statins do not prevent or reduce fracture risk.", 
    "107": "We investigated the lipid lowering and anti-atherosclerotic effects of atorvastatin in patients with hypercholesterolemia. Thirty patients were given atorvastatin 10 mg daily, and assessed for serum lipids, intima-media thickness (IMT), and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (ba-PWV) at the baseline, 6 months, and 12 months. Remnant-like particle-cholesterol (RLP-C), lipoprotein (a)(Lp(a)), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were measured in some patients at the baseline and at 6 months. Total cholesterol, triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly decreased by 32%, 23% and 44% at 6 months, respectively, and these effects were sustained at 12 months. There was no change in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. IMT at the baseline was 0.88 +/- 0.16 mm and decreased to 0.76 +/- 0.13 mm at 6 months, remaining at 0.75 +/- 0.12 mm at 12 months. We did not observe any significant changes in ba-PWV. RLP-C and hs-CRP were significantly reduced from 7.3 +/- 10.8 mg/dL to 4.3 +/- 5.3 mg/dL and 0.075 +/- 0.065 mg/dL to 0.039 +/- 0.043 mg/dL at 6 months, respectively. There was no change in Lp(a). The observed decrease in IMT suggests that atorvastatin possibly improves atherosclerosis, in addition to the significant reduction of serum lipids.",

In experiment 2, rats received water; PIO 10 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)+ATV 10 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1); PIO+ATV and valdecoxib, a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor; PIO+ATV and zileuton, a selective 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor; or zileuton alone. There were 4 rats in each group. Hearts were harvested and analyzed for myocardial lipoxin-A4 and 15-epi-LXA4 levels and for COX-2 and 5-lipoxygenase protein expression. ATV and PIO at 5 and 10 mg x kg(-1) . d(-1) significantly increased myocardial 15-epi-LXA4 levels compared with the sham-treated group (0.51 +/- 0.02 ng/mg). Myocardial 15-epi-LXA4 were significantly higher in the PIO+ATV group (1.29 +/- 0.02 ng/mg; P < 0.001 versus each other group). Both valdecoxib and zileuton abrogated the PIO+ATV increase in 15-epi-LXA4, whereas zileuton alone had no effect. PIO, ATV, and their combination resulted in a small increase in myocardial lipoxin-A4 levels, which was not statistically significant. ATV alone or in combination with PIO markedly augmented COX-2 expression. PIO had a much smaller effect on COX-2 expression. Myocardial expression of 5-lipoxygenase was not altered by PIO, ATV, or their combination.",

Rates of prothrombin and factor V activation (FVa), fibrinogen (Fbg) cleavage and FVa inactivation showed that both quinapril and atorvastatin decreased the rates of: formation of thrombin B-chain (by 30.6%, P=0.007; and by 34.3%, P=0.003), formation of thrombin-antithrombin complexes (by 30.4%, P=0.0002; and by 40%, P=0.001), FV activation (by 19.1%, P=0.03; and by 21.8%, P=0.005) and Fbg depletion (by 29.2%, P=0.004; and by 32.7%, P=0.001).

Addition of atorvastatin to quinapril, but not quinapril to the statin, enhanced the anticoagulant effects.

    "119": "Statins are a class of drugs widely used for lowering high cholesterol levels through their action on 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, a key enzyme in the synthesis of cholesterol. We studied the effects of two major statins, simvastatin and atorvastatin, on five Candida species and Aspergillus fumigatus. The statins strongly inhibited the growth of all species, except Candida krusei. Supplementation of Candida albicans and A. fumigatus with ergosterol or cholesterol in aerobic culture led to substantial recovery from the inhibition by statins, suggesting specificity of statins for the mevalonate synthesis pathway. Our findings suggest that the statins could have utility as antifungal agents and that fungal colonization could be affected in those on statin therapy.", 
    "120": "Hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors represent the most successful class of drugs for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia and dyslipidaemia implicated in the pathogenesis of coronary heart disease and atherosclerosis. However, the popular profile of statins in terms of efficacy has been maligned by its adverse events. The myotoxicity, ranging from mild myopathy to serious rhabdomyolysis, associated with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, during treatment of hypercholesterolaemia is of paramount importance. Rhabdomyolysis is a rare but idiosyncratic muscle wasting disorder of different etiologies. Statin-associated rhabdomyolysis causes skeletal muscle injury by self-perpetuating events leading to fatal irreversible renal damage through a series of biochemical reactions. Preferential distribution and action of statins in liver could be the key to minimise myotoxicity concerns. Hepato-specific distribution of statins is governed by various factors such as physicochemical properties, pharmacokinetic properties and selective transporter-mediated uptake in liver rather in extrahepatic cells. The interactions of statins with concomitant drugs of different classes merit attention for their safety profile. Although pharmacokinetic as well as pharmacodynamic interactions have been implicated in pathophysiology of statin-induced muscle wasting, the underlying mechanism is not clearly understood. Besides, pharmacokinetic and phramcodynamic factors, statin-associated myotoxcity may also implicate pharmacogenomic factors. The pharmacogenomics characterised by CYP polymorphism and other genetic factors is responsible for inter-individual variations to efficacy and tolerability of statins. The pathophysiological mechanisms may include statin-induced differences in cholesterol:phospholipid ratio, isoprenoid levels, small GTP binding proteins and apoptosis. However, the present understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms, does not offer a reliable approach to address the same at preclinical level. Although statin-associated myotoxicity affects compliance, quality of life of patient and discontinuation rate, yet the low incidence of myotoxicty including rhabdomyolysis and less severity of commonly occurring myopathy and myalgia do not raise doubts about the clinical efficacy and tolerability of statins. Medical management of myotoxicity seems to be pivotal for the proper compliance of patients with statin treatment. The appropriate and judicious use of drugs would substantially reduce the likelihood of developing clinically important myopathy.", 
    "121": "Statins are widely prescribed, effective cholesterol-lowering drugs. Indeed, atorvastatin and simvastatin were the most commonly prescribed drugs in the US in 2004, with > 70 million prescriptions written for atorvastatin alone. Statins are pleiotropic agents and, after an early study of patients with coronary heart disease showed a lower than expected incidence of cancers, preclinical studies were carried out that have supported the potential anticancer activity of these compounds. However, clinical reports on the relationship between statin use and breast cancer risk have yielded mixed results, with no association and both positive and negative associations being observed. Because breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in women, any link between statin use and breast cancer risk would have major public health implications. The current evidence suggests that statins are safe and effective agents in treating hyperlipidaemia and no evidence of increase or decrease risk of breast cancer. Indeed, more research is needed to define whether long-term statin therapy may decrease or increase the risk of breast cancer.", 
    "122": "Statins provide strong clinical benefits via reducing stroke deaths, and they are also considered for tumor reduction and chemo-sensitization. High dose atorvastatin in adults (80 mg daily, approx. 1 mg/kg) is proven to afford greater protection against cardiac deaths than does a standard lipid-lowering dose in coronary syndrome. For cancer trials, mega doses up to 30 mg/kg have been used for short term treatments but neither a high nor a mega-dose of atorvastatin has been tested for long term cardiac safety. This may be of special concern, since some animal studies showed deleterious effects of statins on cardiac tissue, which may be related with coenzymeQ (CoQ) depletion. We performed an electron microscopic analysis of rat hearts after low, high-or mega-dose atorvastatin therapy and with or without MNU (methyl-nitrosourea)-stress. MNU + daily high dose atorvastatin treatment for 13 months did not produce severe cardiac toxicity with CoQ. However, at mega doses (30 mg/kg) and with MNU, mitochondrial damage and myofibrillary disintegration was obvious. Strong proliferation of mitochondria under high dose atorvastatin therapy with CoQ may explain the lack of cardiotoxicity; and this finding seems to parallel recent data that statins induce HNF-4 and PPAR-alpha, both responsible for mitochondria-proliferation. Employment of statins for tumor chemo-sensitization at high-dosage and for long term treatments may require strategies to direct the mevalonate-entry differentially into cardiac and tumor cells and to develop a protocol analogous to folic acid salvage of methotrexate toxicity.",

    "129": "Our purpose was to test the impact of single and/or combined treatment with the AT(1)-receptor blocker candesartan and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor rosuvastatin on infarct size and neuroscore in transient cerebral ischemia in rats. L-NAME was used to test whether any potential effect was due to activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Therefore, the middle cerebral artery was occluded for 1 h (MCAO) followed by 7 days reperfusion. Rats received candesartan 2h before and daily after MCAO (pretreatment) or daily after MCAO (posttreatment); rosuvastatin was given daily for 7 days before MCAO without or with candesartan pre- and posttreatment. In addition, candesartan and rosuvastatin were combined with L-NAME. Infarct size and neuroscore at day 7 were compared to those of controls. As result, compared to controls (109+/-12 mm(3)) infarct size with candesartan (pretreatment: 21+/-5 mm(3); posttreatment: 68+/-29 mm(3); P<0.05) or rosuvastatin (69+/-14 mm(3); P<0.05) was smaller. Combined treatment also reduced infarct size (pretreatment: 37+/-15 mm(3); posttreatment 57+/-20mm(3); P<0.05); but there was no benefit of combined treatment over candesartan pretreatment alone. Compared to controls (2.08+/-0.28) only candesartan pretreatment and combined treatment improved the neuroscore (0.97+/-0.05, 1.10+/-0.33; P<0.05). L-NAME abolished the reduction in infarct size and improvement in neuroscore. In conclusion, both, candesartan or rosuvastatin treatment alone reduced infarct size in transient cerebral ischemia, and the best result was achieved with candesartan pretreatment. Combined treatment was superior to rosuvastatin alone, but not to candesartan. The therapeutic benefit of both agents was at least in parts mediated by eNOS-activation.",

The Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS) is a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial designed to compare the effects of atorvastatin with placebo in preventing primary coronary events in diabetic patients. After a median of only 3.9 years (the study was terminated approximately 2 years early due to the magnitude of benefit attributable to atorvastatin therapy), risk for major cardiovascular events was decreased by 37%, acute coronary heart disease-related events were also reduced by 36%, coronary revascularizations by 31%, and stroke by 48%.

Treating elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol has been shown to be very effective in reducing the rate of coronary heart disease (CHD) in primary prevention trials; however, the data are not as robust for treating individuals categorized at either lower risk for CHD or with below-average LDL cholesterol levels. The next frontier for investigation will include strategies to determine who in these lower risk categories should be treated with statins. The growing epidemics of obesity, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome also loom as major problems that need to be incorporated into any strategy that focuses on the prevention of cardiovascular disease. In individuals with multiple cardiovascular risk factors, combination therapies tailored to address each individual's risk profile need to be considered to best decrease the likelihood of their first coronary event.", 
    "132": "In the 1960s, epidemiologic studies established a link between elevated serum cholesterol and increased risk of cardiovascular events. Extensive clinical trial data subsequently highlighted 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (ie, statins) as the most effective pharmacotherapy for lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and showed that statin-mediated LDL cholesterol reductions were associated with significant improvements in cardiovascular outcomes. Such findings are reflected in current cardiovascular disease management guidelines, which focus on LDL cholesterol as the primary therapeutic target. These guidelines recommend target LDL cholesterol levels. However, a number of clinical trials have failed to identify an LDL cholesterol threshold level below which no further cardiovascular risk reduction occurs. Such findings suggest that optimal risk reduction may require greater reductions in LDL cholesterol than are currently being achieved. This review examines recent data highlighting the benefits of more pronounced LDL cholesterol reductions and considers how this could be achieved in clinical practice when many patients are not even reaching current targets.",

Identification of individuals with elevated Lp-PLA(2) may improve risk assessment, and Lp-PLA(2) may also provide an additional target of therapy. Statin therapy has been shown to reduce Lp-PLA(2), and selective inhibitors of Lp-PLA(2) are under development. Additional research is needed to further determine the role of Lp-PLA(2) in atherogenesis and atherothrombotic events.", 
    "134": "Patients with metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus are usually in moderately high-risk, high-risk, or very high-risk cardiovascular categories and present major therapeutic challenges. The dyslipidemia in such patients is typically a disorder of the triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein axis (TG/HDL axis) characterized by an excess of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and a reduction of HDL. Very often, lifestyle therapy and statin monotherapy fail to achieve guideline goals, necessitating combination therapies. Fibric acids (or fibrates), are agonists of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha,which have amassed significant lipid-surrogate and clinical outcome trial data, especially in insulin-resistant patients, typical of those with metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes mellitus. Current guidelines advocate fibrate use as an add-on to statin therapy when TG/HDL abnormalities exist in such patients. In this paper, we review pertinent and recent trial data, mechanisms of action, and the safety of fibrate therapy."
