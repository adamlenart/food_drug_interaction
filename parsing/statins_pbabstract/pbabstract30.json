However, the risk of incident diabetes is not the same among statins. Pitavastatin lowers low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol but also seems to be neutral in terms of risk of incident diabetes. Clinical and experimental evidence shows that pitavastatin increases adiponectin levels and reduces oxidative stress, effects that seem to be implicated in the beneficial effect of the drug on carbohydrate metabolism variables. Pitavastatin is a useful hypolipidemic drug, which is promising for patients with increased diabetes risk or established diabetes.",

In the present study, patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes were treated with oral CoQ10, 100\u00a0mg twice daily for 12\u00a0weeks. We assessed total antioxidant capacity, intra- and extracellular levels of the redox regulating protein glutaredoxin 1 (Grx1), CoQ10, oxidized LDL-cholesterol, lipid profile and HbA1c. We have previously shown that extracellular Grx1 is increased in patients with type 2 diabetes compared to healthy subjects. In the present study, CoQ10 treatment significantly decreased serum Grx1 activity as well as total antioxidant capacity independent of type of diabetes, indicating an improvement to a less oxidized extracellular environment. The effect on serum Grx1 activity was more prominent in patients not on statin treatment. Conversely, intracellular Grx1 activity as well as mRNA levels increased independent of statin treatment. There was a significant improvement in oxidized LDL-cholesterol and lipid profile, with a tendency to improved metabolic control (HbA1c). Additionally, we describe for the first time that CoQ10 is a direct substrate for glutathione, and that Grx1 catalyzes this reaction, thus presenting a novel mechanism for CoQ10 reduction which could explain our findings of an increased intracellular Grx1. In conclusion, 12\u00a0weeks CoQ10 treatment significantly improved the extracellular redox balance and lipid profile, indicating that prolonged treatment may have beneficial effects also on clinical outcome in diabetes.",

    "3": "Classical epidemiology has established the incremental contribution of the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol measure in the assessment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk; yet, genetic epidemiology does not support a causal relationship between HDL cholesterol and the future risk of myocardial infarction. Therapeutic interventions directed toward cholesterol loading of the HDL particle have been based on epidemiological studies that have established HDL cholesterol as a biomarker of atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk. However, therapeutic interventions such as niacin, cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors increase HDL cholesterol in patients treated with statins, but have repeatedly failed to reduce cardiovascular events. Statin therapy interferes with ATP-binding cassette transporter-mediated macrophage cholesterol efflux via miR33 and thus may diminish certain HDL functional properties. Unraveling the HDL puzzle will require continued technical advances in the characterization and quantification of multiple HDL subclasses and their functional properties. Key mechanistic criteria for clinical outcomes trials with HDL-based therapies include formation of HDL subclasses that improve the efficiency of macrophage cholesterol efflux and compositional changes in the proteome and lipidome of the HDL particle that are associated with improved antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. These measures require validation in genetic studies and clinical trials of HDL-based therapies on the background of statins.",

In this context diabetic dyslipidemia is of utmost importance as it represents the crucial link between diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Although hypertriglyceridemia is usually the most prominent lipid abnormality in diabetic patients, reduction of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is the most important strategy to prevent cardiovascular disease. Statin trials and more recently the combination of statin with ezetimibe clearly showed that diabetic patients benefit from low LDL cholesterol levels. In this context the newly developed proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors are of great interest as they reduce LDL cholesterol by 50-70\u2009% independent of co-medication and largely independent of the underlying dyslipidemia. Subgroup analyses of phase 2 and phase 3 studies indicated that diabetic patients show a similar response to PCSK9 inhibitors as non-diabetic patients. Furthermore, the overall very low rate of side effects seems to be comparable between diabetic and non-diabetic patients. In contrast to statins PCSK9 inhibitors do not lead to an increased rate of new onset diabetes. Although data from safety studies (post hoc analyses) are very promising concerning the prevention of cardiovascular events, data from outcome studies will only become available in 2016. Until then PCSK9 inhibitors should be restricted to patients with very high risk and a significant distance from the LDL cholesterol target values (despite maximum possible lipid-lowering therapy with statins and ezetimibe).

The objective of this study was to develop a protocol for the analytical quantification of MVAL in bacterial systems and to utilise this approach to analyse the effects of Rosuvastatin (RSV) on bacterial MVAL formation. To determine the effective concentration range of RSV, we examined the dose-dependent inhibition of growth in the HMG-R(+) bacterial pathogens Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium at various concentrations of pure RSV. Growth inhibition generally correlated with a reduction in bacterial MVAL levels, particularly in culture supernatants at high RSV concentrations, as determined using our ultra-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry protocol. This work therefore outlines a refined protocol for the analysis of MVAL in microbial cultures and provides evidence for statin-mediated inhibition of bacterial HMG-R.

We illustrate cases when adherence is of primary importance and in which dose individualization is of primary importance. The concept of a priori forgiveness and a posteriori forgiveness provides a quantitative measure that allows the influence of adherence to be disentangled from dose individualization and could be used to provide clear guidelines about the relative importance of each in clinical practice.",

    "41": "The relationship between lipids and the development and/or severity of diabetic retinopathy (DR) is complex. Large epidemiologic studies suggest an inconsistent and overall modest association between serum triglycerides or major cholesterol species and the severity of DR; however, certain specific lipoprotein species may have stronger associations with DR severity, suggesting a pathophysiological role for lipoproteins analogous to that seen in atherosclerosis. In this lipoprotein-mediated DR pathogenesis model, damage to the blood-retinal barrier allows extravasation of lipoprotein species, which are modified in the intraretinal environment, creating substantial local damage. Additionally, hypolipidemic therapy with statins and fibrates--particularly the latter--have been shown to modulate DR in large-scale studies. Since serum lipid profile changes do not necessarily correlate with DR modulation, the efficacy of these agents may be due to their tissue-specific changes in lipoproteins and/or their anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, antiangiogenic, and antiapoptotic functions.",

The hyperlipidaemic rats were treated with Gynostemma pentaphyllum (120\u2009mg/kg) and atorvastatin (1.8\u2009mg/kg) for 4 weeks, and the rats were intragastric administration one time every day.

Results After feeding with a high-fat diet, the TC and LDL-C values of the hyperlipidaemic mode rats increased dramatically (p\u2009<\u20090.01). The established method allowed a target analysis of 12 kinds of amino acids. PCA studies showed that the plasma amino acids had not returned to normal after GP treatment, but those had recovered slightly after atorvastatin treatment. GP has almost no impact on the metabolism of amino acids, while atorvastatin can modify the metabolism of amino acids via self-regulatory mechanisms. Discussion and conclusion UPLC/DAD combined with SCX-SPE can be successfully used for profiling analysis of amino acids. By the comparison of biomarkers following treatment with GP and atorvastatin, the influence of the two drugs on biomarkers is revealed.", 
    "44": "Hepatic adverse effects are one of the most commonly known adverse effects reported with statins. Frequently, fear of serious hepatic effects contributes to underutilization of statins as well as unnecessary discontinuation of its use among those indicated. There are changing data on the occurrence of these negative hepatic effects, recommendations on their actual risk, monitoring required, and safety of use in those with preexisting hepatic disorders. Based on reviewed literature, statins appear to be associated with a very low risk of true and serious liver injury. Unprecedented fears regarding hepatic adverse effects of statins among prescribers and patients can deny patients of the significant benefits of these agents. Routine periodic monitoring of liver function does not appear to detect or prevent serious liver injury and hence may not be indicated. But the potential of statins to cause significant and serious hepatic effects should not be overlooked in daily clinical practice. Statin use need not be avoided in patients with preexisting liver dysfunction such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, compensated cirrhosis, and compensated chronic liver disease if its use is clearly indicated. Physician's judgment based on the risk and benefit for an individual patient does matter when a strategy is chosen regarding the use of statins and monitoring patients while on statins.", 
    "45": "Statins have often been used in atherosclerosis treatment because of its pleiotropic effects on inflammation. However, some adverse effects of high doses of statin show reverse effects after withdrawal. Cyanidin-3-glucoside (C3G) is a powerful anti-inflammation and antioxidant that has been of interest for use in combination with low doses of statin, which may be alternative treatment for atherosclerosis. The objective is to investigate the synergistic effect of atorvastatin and C3G in angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced inflammation in vascular smooth muscle cells. Human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs) were exposed to Ang II with or without atorvastatin and C3G alone, or in combination. The results revealed that the combination of atorvastatin and C3G produces synergism against inflammation and oxidative stress. The mechanism of the combination of atorvastatin and C3G suppressed the translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-\u03baB from cytosol to nucleus, and attenuated the expression of proteins including inducible nitric oxide synthase, intracellular adhesion molecule 1(ICAM-1), and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1(VCAM-1), in addition to nitric oxide (NO) production. Moreover, C3G exerts the antioxidative properties of atorvastatin through down-regulating NOX1 and promoting the activity of the Nrf2(-)ARE signaling pathway and downstream proteins including heme oxygenase (HO-1), NAD(P)H:quinoneoxidoreductase 1 (NQO-1), and glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (\u03b3-GCLC), besides increasing the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzymes. Taken together, these results suggest that a combination of low dose statins and C3G might serve as a potential regulator of the atherosclerosis process which is mediated by attenuating oxidative stress, thereby inhibiting NF-\u03baB and activating Nrf2 signaling pathways induced by Ang II.", 
    "46": "Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been suggested to play a role in the progression of plaque vulnerability and the occurrence of acute complications of coronary atherosclerosis. Atorvastatin is known to exert pleiotropic effects on the cardiovascular system. The present study aimed to examine the stabilizing effects of atorvastatin on vulnerable plaques within hyperhomocysteinemic apolipoprotein E\u2011deficient (ApoE\u2011/\u2011) mice, and to investigate the potential mechanisms underlying ER stress in ApoE\u2011/\u2011 mice and macrophages. In the present study, ApoE\u2011/\u2011 mice were administrated methionine or atorvastatin, and were sacrificed after 2 months. Necrotic core size, collagen content and inflammatory cytokine infiltration were subsequently measured in the aortic lesions, in order to investigate plaque stability. Treatment with atorvastatin decreased the number and size of necrotic cores, increased collagen content, and downregulated tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u2011\u03b1 and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)\u20119 mRNA expression, as compared with the methionine group. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that atorvastatin administration prevented ER stress activation in aortic lesions of hyperhomocysteinemic mice. Furthermore, macrophages were challenged with homocysteine (Hcy) in the presence or absence of atorvastatin and thapsigargin (an ER stress inducer). Atorvastatin suppressed Hcy\u2011induced ER stress, and downregulated TNF\u2011\u03b1 and MMP\u20119 mRNA expression in the macrophages. Conversely, thapsigargin attenuated the inhibitory effects of atorvastatin against Hcy\u2011induced TNF\u2011\u03b1 and MMP\u20119 expression. These results indicated that hyperhomocysteinemia may promote atherosclerotic plaque development and instability. In addition, atorvastatin was able to improve atherosclerotic plaque stability in hyperhomocysteinemic mice by inhibiting ER stress.",

    "65": "A small but significant link between new-onset diabetes mellitus (NOD) and statin therapy was noted with rosuvastatin users in the Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin study. Since then multiple analyses have further confirmed this association, with most studies demonstrating a modest increase in NOD with statin therapy, especially among individuals with risk factors for developing diabetes mellitus. More recent observational analyses suggest a stronger correlation between statin use and NOD, however. A definitive mechanism confirming causation between statins and glucose impairment remains elusive, but many have been proposed. Although considered a class effect by the US Food and Drug Administration, most data indicate NOD is dependent upon the dose and potency of the statin, with certain agents appearing to be less diabetogenic. The consensus is that the benefits of statin therapy far outweigh the risk of NOD, especially among patients with high cardiovascular risk. Nonetheless, more studies are needed to better understand this association and long-term clinical implications. In the meantime, we provide clinicians with a practical guide to assist with clinical decision making when prescribing statin therapy. Overall, this article serves to provide the primary care physician with a timely review of the most clinically relevant data regarding statins and NOD, with hopes to ultimately optimize statin prescribing and limit any potential drug-induced glucose impairment.",

The release profile showed that the release of SIM from MHA-SIM-PNIPAAM lasted 16 days and the cumulative amount of released SIM was almost seven-fold than MHA-SIM. Besides, SIM loaded MHA-PNIPAAM exhibited better performance on cell proliferation, ALP activity, and calcium deposition than pure MHA due to the sustained release of SIM. The quantity of ALP in MHA-SIM-PNIPAAM group was more than two fold than pure MHA group at 7 days. Compared to pure MHA, better BMSC attachment on PNIPAAM modified MHA was observed using fluorescent microscopy, indicating the better biocompatibility of MHA-PNIPAAM.",

However, mechanism of statin in ADP-induced platelet PAR-1 expression is also unknown. Aggregometry, flow cytometry, immunoblotting and ELISA were used to determine role of pravastatin participating in ADP-induced platelet activation and PAR-1 expression. ADP stimulation significantly increased PAR-1 expression on platelets. PAR-1 antagonist SCH-79797 inhibited platelet aggregation as well as decreased platelet P-selectin expression induced by ADP. CRP inhibited PAR-1 expression induced by ADP in a concentration-dependent manner. Pravastatin treatment reduced PAR-1 expression in a concentration-dependent manner. Combination treatment of CRP and Pravastatin significantly reduced platelet PAR-1 expression induced by ADP. By western-blot analysis, pravastatin treatment did not influence total PAR-1 after ADP treatment. CRP decreased platelet total PAR-1 expression induced by ADP. Pravastatin and CRP reduced TXB2 formation by ADP significantly. CRP decreased thrombin fragment F1+2 level with ADP treatment. Pravastatin, in contrast, did not influence F1+2 level. Upon treatment with Pravastatin reduced platelet LOX-1 expression induced by ADP. In conclusion, PAR-1 served as a critical mechanism to relay platelet activation process induced by ADP.

Here, we evaluated the potential role of HMGCR (rs3846662) in AD-related pathology by assessing neuroimaging biomarkers. We enrolled in 812 subjects from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset. In general, it is possible that HMGCR (rs3846662) could be involved in preventing the atrophy of right entorhinal (P=0.03385) and left hippocampus (P=0.01839) in the follow-up research of two years. What's more, it lowered the drop rate of glucose metabolism in right temporal. We then further validated them in the AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), normal control (NC) sub-groups. All the results in the MCI groups confirmed the association.

    "86": "Pravastatin is a lipid-lowering agent that attenuates atherosclerosis. However, the multifactorial pathogenesis of atherosclerosis requires other drugs with different anti-atherogenic mechanisms. We chose sarpogrelate as an anti-platelet agent and a novel component of a complex drug with pravastatin due to its high potential but little information on its beneficial effects on atherosclerosis. Low-density lipoprotein receptor-knockout mice were fed a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet and treated with pravastatin alone, sarpogrelate alone, or a combination of both drugs. Although sarpogrelate alone did not significantly reduce atherosclerotic plaque areas, co-treatment with pravastatin significantly decreased aortic lesions compared to those of the pravastatin alone treated group. The combined therapy was markedly more effective than that of the single therapies in terms of foam cell formation, smooth muscle cell proliferation, and inflammatory cytokine levels. These results suggest that pravastatin and sarpogrelate combined therapy may provide a new therapeutic strategy for treating atherosclerosis.",

First, the effects of PBAE microparticles on ISI architecture and material properties throughout degradation were investigated. Second, the influence of PBAE microparticles on drug release kinetics was quantified. Over a 15 d period, ISIs containing PBAE microparticles possessed greater porosity, ranging from 42-80%, compared to controls, which ranged from 24-54% (p < 0.001), and these ISIs also developed significantly greater accessible volume to simulated cell-sized spheres after 5 d or more of degradation (p < 0.001). PBAE-containing ISIs possessed a more uniform microarchitecture, which preserved mechanical resilience after cyclical loading (p < 0.001), and the materials swelled to fill the injected space, which significantly increased interfacial strength in an artificial periodontal pocket (p < 0.0001). PBAE microparticles eliminated the burst of freely-mixed simvastatin compared to 36% burst from controls (p < 0.0001), and high-dose doxycycline release was prolonged from 2 d to 7 d by pre-loading drug into the microparticles.

LDL-C/CAD-associated SNPs showed consistent effect directions (binomial P\u00a0=\u00a06.85\u00a0\u00d7\u00a010(-5)). Conversely, a 1-SD increase in LDL-C was causally protective of diabetes (OR 0.86; 95\u00a0% CI 0.81, 0.91), however LDL-cholesterol/diabetes-associated SNPs did not show consistent effect directions (binomial P\u00a0=\u00a00.15). HMGCR, our positive control, associated with LDL-C, CAD and a glycemic composite (derived from GWAS meta-analysis of four glycemic traits and diabetes). In contrast, PCSK9, APOB, LPA, CETP, PLG, NPC1L1 and ALDH2 were identified as \"druggable\" loci that alter LDL-C and\u00a0risk of\u00a0CAD without displaying associations with dysglycemia. In conclusion, LDL-C increases the risk of CAD and the relationship is independent of any association of LDL-C with diabetes. Loci that encode targets of emerging LDL-C lowering drugs do not associate with dysglycemia, and this provides provisional evidence that\u00a0new LDL-C lowering drugs (such as PCSK9 inhibitors) may not influence risk of diabetes.",

However, 5% to 10% of statin-treated patients report intolerance, mostly due to muscle-related adverse effects. Challenges exist to objective identification of statin-intolerant patients. Evolocumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), resulting in marked LDL-C reduction. We report the design of Goal Achievement After Utilizing an Anti-PCSK9 Antibody in Statin-Intolerant Subjects 3 (GAUSS-3), a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, ezetimibe-controlled study to compare effectiveness of 24 weeks of evolocumab 420 mg monthly vs ezetimibe 10 mg daily in hypercholesterolemic patients unable to tolerate an effective statin dose. The study incorporates a novel atorvastatin-controlled, double-blind, crossover phase to objectively identify statin intolerance. Eligible patients had LDL-C above the National Cholesterol Education Project Adult Treatment Panel III target level for the appropriate coronary heart disease risk category and were unable to tolerate \u22653 statins or 2 statins (one of which was atorvastatin \u226410 mg/d) or had a history of marked creatine kinase elevation accompanied by muscle symptoms while on 1 statin. This trial has 2 co-primary endpoints: mean percent change from baseline in LDL-C at weeks 22 and 24 and percent change from baseline in LDL-C at week 24. Key secondary efficacy endpoints include change from baseline in LDL-C, percent of patients attaining LDL-C <70 mg/dL (1.81 mmol/L), and percent change from baseline in total cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B.

    "116": "A simple, sensitive, and efficient method has been developed for simultaneous estimation of valsartan and atorvastatin in human plasma by combination of solid-based dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction and high performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection. In the proposed method, 1,2-dibromoethane (extraction solvent) is added on a sugar cube (as a solid disperser) and it is introduced into plasma sample containing the analytes. After manual shaking and centrifugation, the resultant sedimented phase is subjected to back extraction into a small volume of sodium hydrogen carbonate solution using air-assisted liquid-liquid microextraction. Then the cloudy solution is centrifuged and the obtained aqueous phase is transferred into a microtube and analyzed by the separation system. Under the optimal conditions, extraction recoveries are obtained in the range of 81-90%. Calibration curves plotted in drug-free plasma sample are linear in the ranges of 5-5000\u03bcgL(-1) for valsartan and 10-5000\u03bcgL(-1) for atorvastatin with the coefficients of determination higher than 0.997. Limits of detection and quantification of the studied analytes in plasma sample are 0.30-2.6 and 1.0-8.2\u03bcgL(-1), respectively. Intra-day (n=6) and inter-days (n=4) precisions of the method are satisfactory with relative standard deviations less than 7.4% (at three levels of 10, 500, and 2000\u03bcgL(-1), each analyte). These data suggest that the method can be successfully applied to determine trace amounts of valsartan and atorvastatin in human plasma samples.",

Here, we estimated the association between influenza vaccination and dementia risk in patients with CKD. Data from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan were used in this study. The study cohort included all patients diagnosed with CKD (according to International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes) at healthcare facilities in Taiwan (n = 32,844) from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2007. Each patient was followed up to assess dementia risk or protective factors: demographic characteristics of age and sex; comorbidities of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, cerebrovascular diseases, parkinsonism, epilepsy, substance and alcohol use disorders, mood disorder, anxiety disorder, psychotic disorder, and sleep disorder; urbanization level; monthly income; and statin, metformin, aspirin, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) use. A propensity score was derived using a logistic regression model for estimating the effect of vaccination by accounting for covariates that predict receiving the intervention (vaccine). A time-dependent Cox proportional hazard model was used to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) of dementia among vaccinated and unvaccinated CKD patients. The study population comprised 11,943 eligible patients with CKD; 5745 (48%) received influenza vaccination and the remaining 6198 (52%) did not. The adjusted HRs (aHRs) of dementia decreased in vaccinated patients compared with those in unvaccinated patients (influenza season, noninfluenza season, and all seasons: aHRs\u200a=\u200a0.68, 0.58, and 0.64; P\u200a<\u200a0.0001, P\u200a<\u200a0.0001, and P\u200a<\u200a0.0001, respectively). In the sensitivity analysis, adjustments were made to estimate the association of age and sex; diabetes, dyslipidemia, hypertension, cerebrovascular diseases, anxiety disorder; and statin, metformin, ACEI, and aspirin use with the incidence of dementia in various models. A stronger protective effect against dementia risk was demonstrated during the noninfluenza season. Regardless of comorbidities or drug use, influenza vaccination was an independent protective factor and dose-dependently reduced the risk of dementia in CKD patients. Influenza vaccination exerts dose-response and synergistic protective effects against dementia in CKD patients with dementia risk factors by reducing the incidence of dementia.",

In the Treating to New Targets (TNT) study (NCT00327691), patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) were randomized to atorvastatin 10 or 80 mg/day and followed for 4.9 years. The relation between intrastudy change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) from baseline and the risk of major cardiovascular events (MCVEs, defined as CHD death, nonfatal non-procedure-related myocardial infarction, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or fatal or nonfatal stroke) was assessed among 9,500 patients stratified by renal function: improving (change in eGFR more than +2 ml/min/1.73 m(2)), stable (-2 to +2 ml/min/1.73 m(2)), and worsening (less than -2 ml/min/1.73 m(2)). Compared with patients with worsening renal function (1,479 patients, 15.6%), the rate of MCVEs was 28% lower in patients with stable renal function (2,241 patients, 23.6%) (hazard ratio [HR] 0.72; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.60 to 0.87; p = 0.0005) and 64% lower in patients with improving renal function (5,780 patients, 60.8%; HR 0.36; 95% CI 0.30 to 0.43; p <0.0001). For each 1 ml/min/1.73 m(2) increase in eGFR, the absolute reduction in the rate of MCVEs was 2.7% (HR 0.973; 95% CI 0.967 to 0.980; p <0.0001). An absolute MCVE rate reduction per 1 ml/min/1.73 m(2) increase in eGFR of 2.0% was reported with atorvastatin 10 mg and 3.3% with atorvastatin 80 mg. In conclusion, intrastudy stabilization or increase in eGFR in atorvastatin-treated patients with CHD from the TNT study was associated with a reduced rate of MCVEs. Statin-treated CHD patients with progressive renal impairment are at high risk for future cardiovascular events.",

However, statins can cause a variety of skeletal muscle problems, and exercise leads to an increase in statin-induced muscle injury. Exercise induces the protein content of monocarboxylate transporter 4 (MCT4), which is expressed strongly in skeletal muscle and is thought to play a major role in the transport of metabolically important monocarboxylates such as l-lactate. We previously reported that \u03b1-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamate, an MCT4 inhibitor, increased the inhibition of growth of RD cells, a prototypic embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma cell line (an RD cell line), as a model of in\u00a0vitro skeletal muscle, induced by a statin. However, it is unclear whether statin-induced RD cell cytotoxicity is associated with MCT4 expression. We, therefore, examined the relationship between statin-induced cytotoxicity and MCT4 expression in RD cells. Atorvastatin reduced the number of viable cells and upregulated MCT4, but not MCT1, mRNA level in a concentration-dependent manner. MCT4 knockdown suppressed atorvastatin-, simvastatin-, and fluvastatin-induced reduction of cell viability and apoptosis compared with negative control-treated cells.

Seventy-two healthy male New Zealand rabbits weighing between 2.5 and 3.2 kg were randomly divided into three groups: the SAH group (n=24), sham-operated group (n=24) and the SAH + atorvastatin group (n=24). A double SAH model was employed. The sham-operated group were injected with the same dose of saline solution, the SAH + atorvastatin group received atorvastatin 20 mg/kg/day after SAH. All rabbit brain samples were taken at 72 h after the SAH model was established successfully. Brain edema was detected using the dry-wet method after experimental SAH was induced; AQP4 and caspase-3 expression was measured by western blot analysis, and neuronal apoptosis was detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) staining at 72 h after SAH. The results indicated that brain edema and injury appeared soon after SAH, while brain edema and EBI were ameliorated and increased behavior scores were noted after prophylactic use of atorvastatin. Compared with the SAH group, the level of AQP4 and the cerebral content of water was significantly decreased (P<0.01) by atorvastatin, and TUNEL staining and studying the expression of caspase-3 showed that the apoptosis of neurons was reduced markedly both in the hippocampus and brain cortex by atorvastatin. The results suggest that atorvastatin ameliorated brain edema and EBI after SAH, which was related to its inhibition of AQP4 expression. Our findings provide evidence that atorvastatin is an effective and well-tolerated approach for treating SAH in various clinical settings.",

In addition to lowering triglycerides, these agents can also decrease very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) as well as raise high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Based on the 2013 ACC/AHA Guideline on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults and the National Lipid Association, pharmacologic therapy to reduce triglycerides should be considered when triglyceride levels are \u2265500 mg/dL. While the use of gemfibrozil has decreased over the years for a variety of reasons, muscle-associated adverse effects is the predominant reason and the one that is most clinically relevant. However, despite these concerns, there are situations in which the use of gemfibrozil in combination with a statin may be necessary.

Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) was implicated as the most common genetic cause of PD. We previously established a LRRK2-G2019S Drosophila model that displayed the crucial phenotypes of LRRK2 parkinsonism. Here, we used a two-step approach to identify compounds from the FDA-approved licensed drug library that could suppress neurite degeneration in LRRK2-G2019S parkinsonism. Of 640 compounds, 29 rescued neurite degeneration phenotypes and 3 restored motor disability and dopaminergic neuron loss in aged LRRK2-G2019S flies. Of these three drugs, lovastatin had the highest lipophilicity, which facilitated crossing the blood-brain barrier. In LRRK2-G2019S knock-in mice and stably transfected human dopaminergic cells, lovastatin significantly rescued neurite degeneration in a dose-dependent manner, within a range of 0.05-0.1 \u03bcm The beneficial effect of lovastatin was exerted by activating anti-apoptotic Akt/Nrf signaling and decreasing caspase 3 levels. We also observed that lovastatin inhibited GSK3\u03b2 activity, a kinase downstream of Akt, by up-regulating GSK3\u03b2 (Ser9) phosphorylation. This inhibition subsequently decreased tau phosphorylation, which was linked to neuronal cytoskeleton instability. Conversely, pre-treatment with the Akt inhibitor, A6730, blocked the lovastatin-induced neuroprotective effect. The rescuing effects of lovastatin in dendritic arborization of LRRK2-G2019S neurons were abolished by co-expressing either a mutant allele of Akt (Akt1(04226)) or a constitutively active form of GSK3\u03b2 (sgg(S9A)). Our findings demonstrated that lovastatin restored LRRK2-G2019S neurite degeneration by augmenting Akt/NRF2 pathway and inhibiting downstream GSK3\u03b2 activity, which decreased phospho-tau levels. We suggested that lovastatin is a potential disease-modifying agent for LRRK2-G2019S parkinsonism.",

Similar survival benefit was observed in individuals with and without functional impairments.", 
    "222": "Greater impairment in preadmission functional status, using a measure derived from claims data, was associated with less use of secondary prevention medications after AMI. Survival benefits of taking these medications were consistent across functional impairment levels.", 
    "223": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the consistency of the proportional effect of fixed-dose combination therapy (the 'polypill') on the use of recommended cardiovascular preventative medications among indigenous M\u0101ori and non-indigenous adults in New Zealand.", 
    "224": "We randomised M\u0101ori and non-M\u0101ori primary care patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease (either because of a prior event or with an estimated 5-year risk of a first event of at least 15%) to a polypill (containing aspirin, statin and two antihypertensives) or usual care for a minimum of 12 months. All patients had indications for all polypill components according to their general practitioner, and all medications (including the polypill) were prescribed by the patient's general practitioner and dispensed at community pharmacies. The main outcome for this study was the use of all recommended medications (antiplatelet, statin and two antihypertensives) at 12 months. Heterogeneity in the effect of polypill-based care compared with usual care on this outcome by ethnicity was assessed by logistic regression.", 
    "225": "Baseline use of recommended medications was 36% (93/257) among M\u0101ori and 51% (130/156) among non-M\u0101ori participants. Polypill-based care was associated with an increase in the use of recommended medications among M\u0101ori (relative risk [RR]: 1.87; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.50-2.34) and non-M\u0101ori (RR: 1.66; 95% CI: 1.37-2.00) when compared with usual care at 12 months, and there was no statistically significant heterogeneity in this outcome by ethnicity (p\u2009=\u20090.92).", 
    "226": "Polypill-based care is likely to reduce absolute inequities between M\u0101ori and non-M\u0101ori in the use of recommended cardiovascular preventative medications given baseline absolute differences and the consistency of the proportional effect of this intervention by ethnicity in this pragmatic trial in primary care.", 
    "227": "Pre-operative statin use has shown to reduce the incidence of post-operative atrial fibrillation (AF), but not mortality in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. This association, however, has not been examined in a heart transplant (HT) cohort.", 
    "228": "Adults (\u226518 yr) who underwent HT between 1997 and 2007 at the University of Minnesota were retrospectively identified. Primary outcome was 30-d mortality after HT. Secondary outcomes were 30-d incidence of AF and time to all-cause mortality.", 
    "229": "Data from 259 patients (mean age 52.0 \u00b1 11.7 yr, 81% males) were analyzed. Total of 133 (51%) patients were on statin pre-operatively at the time of HT and constituted the statin group. During a mean follow-up of 6.7 \u00b1 3.7 yr, 82 (32%) deaths occurred, 21 (8%) of which occurred within 30 d of HT. The incidence of 30-d mortality was not significantly different between the statin and no-statin groups (9% vs. 7%, p = 0.58). Further, cumulative long-term survival after HT was not significantly different between the study groups (log-rank p = 0.49). Pre-transplant statin use did not impact the 30-d incidence of post-transplant AF (16% vs. 19%, p = 0.59).", 
    "230": "Pre-operative statin therapy does not seem to influence the risk of mortality or early post-operative AF after HT. Future large-scale studies are required to validate these preliminary findings.", 
    "231": "Statins are widely prescribed to lower plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels. They also modestly reduce plasma triglyceride (TG), an independent cardiovascular disease risk factor, in most people. The mechanism and inter-individual variability of TG statin response is poorly understood. We measured statin-induced gene expression changes in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from 150 participants of a simvastatin clinical trial and identified 23 genes (false discovery rate, FDR=15%) with expression changes correlated with plasma TG response. The correlation of insulin-induced gene 1 (INSIG1) expression changes with TG response (rho=0.32, q=0.11) was driven by men (interaction P=0.0055). rs73161338 was associated with INSIG1 expression changes (P=5.4 \u00d7 10(-5)) and TG response in two statin clinical trials (P=0.0048), predominantly in men. A combined model including INSIG1 expression level and splicing changes accounted for 29.5% of plasma TG statin response variance in men (P=5.6 \u00d7 10(-)(6)). Our results suggest that INSIG1 variation may contribute to statin-induced changes in plasma TG in a sex-specific manner.", 
    "232": "Statins are potent modulators of immune responses, resulting in their ability to enhance host survival from primary bacterial infections. Alterations in primary immune responses that may be beneficial for survival following infection may also result in alterations in the generation of the immunologic memory response and subsequently affect immune responses mounted during secondary bacterial infection. In this study, we report that levels of total serum IgG2c, following primary infection, were decreased in simvastatin pretreated mice, and investigate the effect of simvastatin treatment, prior to primary infection, on immune responses activated during secondary S. aureus infection. A secondary infection model was implemented whereby simvastatin pretreated and control mice were reinfected with S. aureus 14 days after primary infection, with no additional simvastatin treatment, and assessed for survival and alterations in immune function. While survivability to secondary S. aureus infection was not different between simvastatin pretreated and control mice, memory B and T lymphocyte functions were altered. Memory B cells, isolated 14 days after secondary infection, from simvastatin pretreated mice and stimulated ex vivo produced increased levels of IgG1 compared to memory B cells isolated from control mice, while levels of IgM and IgG2c remained similar. Furthermore, memory B and T lymphocytes from simvastatin pretreated mice exhibited a decreased proliferative response when stimulated ex vivo compared to memory cells isolated from control mice. These findings demonstrate the ability of a short term, low dose simvastatin treatment to modulate memory immune function.", 
    "233": "The advancing science of transplantation has led to more transplants and longer survival. As a result, primary care physicians are more involved in the care of transplant recipients. Immunosuppressive therapy has significantly decreased rates of transplant rejection but accounts for more than 50% of transplant-related deaths, often due to infections and other risks related to long-term use. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of non-transplant-related mortality. Aggressive risk factor management is recommended for transplant recipients, including a blood pressure goal of less than 130/80 mm Hg and statin therapy in kidney, liver, and heart recipients. Fertility typically increases posttransplant, and female transplant recipients should avoid pregnancy for one year after surgery. The best contraceptive choice is usually an intrauterine device. Because of the increased risk of infection, patients should be tested for graft dysfunction or infection if suspicion arises. Testing should be coordinated with the transplant center. Malignancies are a common cause of death in transplant recipients, requiring careful attention to screening recommendations and informed discussions with patients. Family physicians should maintain an ongoing relationship with the transplant team to discuss medication changes and the risk of infection or graft rejection.", 
    "234": "Available experimental evidence suggests a role for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in incident chronic kidney disease (CKD) and its progression. However, clinical studies are inconsistent. We therefore built a cohort of 1,943,682 male US veterans and used survival models to\u00a0examine the association between HDL-C and risks of incident CKD or CKD progression (doubling of serum creatinine, eGFR decline of 30% or more), or a composite outcome of ESRD, dialysis, or renal transplantation. Models were adjusted for demographics, comorbid conditions, eGFR, body mass index, lipid parameters, and statin use over a median follow-up of 9 years. Compared to those with HDL-C of 40 mg/dl or more, low HDL-C (under 30 mg/dl) was associated with increased risk of incident eGFR under 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) (hazard ratio: 1.18; confidence interval: 1.17-1.19) and risk of incident CKD (1.20; 1.18-1.22). Adjusted models demonstrate an association between low HDL-C and doubling of serum creatinine (1.14; 1.12-1.15), eGFR decline of 30% or more (1.13; 1.12-1.14), and the composite renal end point (1.08;\u00a01.06-1.11). Cubic spline analyses of the relationship between HDL-C levels and renal outcomes showed a U-shaped relationship, where risk was increased in lowest\u00a0and highest deciles of HDL-C. Thus, a significant association exists between low HDL-C levels and risks of incident CKD and CKD progression. Further studies are needed to explain the increased risk of adverse renal outcomes in patients with high HDL-C.", 
    "235": "The 4D (Die Deutsche Diabetes Dialyse) Study was a randomized, double-blind trial comparing 4 years of treatment with atorvastatin to placebo in 1255 hemodialysis patients with type 2 diabetes. The primary end point of cardiovascular events (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and stroke) was non-significantly reduced by 8%. However, long-term effects remained uncertain. Therefore, surviving patients were invited to a follow-up survey done by questionnaire. Post-trial statin therapy was at nephrologist discretion, and outcomes were centrally adjudicated and analyzed by intention to treat and time to first event in the original treatment groups. Median overall follow-up was 11.5 years. Post-trial statin use and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels did not differ between groups. Statin treatment non-significantly affected the former primary outcome (relative risk, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.78-1.07). The risk of all cardiac events combined and the risk of cardiac death were significantly lower in the original statin group compared to placebo (0.83, 0.70-0.97, and 0.80, 0.66-0.97). No significant effect was detected on cerebrovascular events, fatal stroke, fatal cancer, non-vascular, or all-cause death. No rhabdomyolysis was reported. Thus, after 4 years of atorvastatin treatment in diabetic hemodialysis patients, similar effects on outcomes were found after 11.5 years of follow-up as were found at the end of the original study. There was no evidence of emerging hazards in the long term, confirming current clinical practice guidelines.", 
    "236": "Circulating levels of cholesterol are derived from either endogenous production or intestinal absorption of dietary and biliary cholesterol. Niemann-Pick C1-Like 1 (NPC1L1) is a transmembrane protein that plays a key role in the intestinal absorption of cholesterol by facilitating its uptake through vesicular endocytosis. NPC1L1 is the molecular target of ezetimibe which binds its extracellular loop and inhibits sterol absorption without affecting the absorption of other molecules. Ezetimibe significantly reduces plasma levels of total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) as monotherapy or when added to statins, the association with a low dose of statin is of particular interest for patients experiencing statin-related side effects. The recent results of the IMPROVE-IT study, which evaluated the cardiovascular effect of ezetimibe added to simvastatin therapy in subjects who had had an acute coronary syndrome and with LDL-C levels within the recommended range, showed that a further LDL-C lowering reduced the incidence of cardiovascular events. To date, ezetimibe represents the only inhibitor of NPC1L1 available for clinical use, however, novel amino\u00df- lactam ezetimibe derivatives have been synthesized and their efficacy to inhibit NPC1L1 protein and decrease plasma cholesterol levels is under evaluation.",

    "239": "An open study, before and after, which assessed the effect of ezetimibe plus pravastatin treatment, was performed. Twenty two patients (21 women and one man) with diagnosis of SLE were studied, with a mean age 40\u2009\u00b1\u20095 years. Endothelial dysfunction was evaluated using vascular ultrasound of the brachial artery in order to measure the flow-mediated vasodilation (FMV) basal and after 12 months of treatment with pravastatin 40\u2009mg/day plus ezetimibe 10\u2009mg/day. In addition, a lipid profile: total cholesterol (TC), HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), and serum C-reactive protein (CRP), was done.",

    "242": "Statins have been found to exert antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of intensive and less aggressive statin treatment on thyroid autoimmunity and hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis activity in patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis.", 
    "243": "The study included 38 adult women with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, who required statin therapy and were allocated into one of two groups. Patients at very high cardiovascular risk (n=16) received intensive statin treatment (rosuvastatin 20-40mg daily), while patients at moderate or moderately high cardiovascular risk (n=22) were treated with simvastatin (20-40mg daily) for the following 6 months. Serum levels of thyrotropin, total and free thyroid hormones, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), as well as titers of thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies were measured at the beginning and at the end of the study.", 
    "244": "Thirty-six individuals completed the study and were included in the final analyses. Apart from improving plasma lipids and reducing circulating levels of hsCRP, intensive, but not less aggressive, statin therapy reduced thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibody titers, as well as tended to reduce circulating levels of thyrotropin. The effect of intensive statin therapy on thyroid antibody titers was lipid-independent but correlated with treatment-induced changes in thyrotropin and hsCRP.", 
    "245": "Although 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors are able to reduce thyroid autoimmunity in women with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, intensive statin therapy is required to produce this effect."
