MFS in the dentate gyrus (DG) is an important feature of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) and is highly related to the severity and the frequency of spontaneous recurrent seizures. However, the molecular mechanism of MFS is mostly unknown. GSK-3\u03b2 and CRMP-2 are the genes responsible for axonal growth and neuronal polarity in the hippocampus, therefore this pathway is a potential target to investigate MFS. Pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus animal model was taken as our researching material. Western blot, histological and electrophysiological techniques were used as the studying tools. The results showed that the expression level of GSK-3\u03b2 and CRMP-2 were elevated after seizure induction, and the administration of lovastatin reversed this effect and significantly reduced the extent of MFS in both DG and CA3 region in the hippocampus. The alteration of expression level of GSK-3\u03b2 and CRMP-2 after seizure induction proposes that GSK-3\u03b2 and CRMP-2 are crucial for MFS and epiletogenesis. The fact that lovastatin reversed the expression level of GSK-3\u03b2 and CRMP-2 indicated that GSK-3\u03b2 and CRMP-2 are possible to be a novel mechanism of lovatstain to suppress MFS and revealed a new therapeutic target and researching direction for studying the mechanism of MFS and epileptogenesis.",

Statins may have an impact on clinical outcomes beyond their lipid-lowering effects. The aim of the present study was to delineate whether statin therapy has an impact on cancer risk and total mortality after heart transplantation.", 
    "2": "A total of 255 patients who underwent heart transplantation at the University Hospital Zurich between 1985 and 2007 and survived the first year were included in the present study. The primary outcome measure was the occurrence of any malignancy; the secondary end point was overall survival. During follow-up, a malignancy was diagnosed in 108 patients (42%). The cumulative incidence of tumors 8 years after transplantation was reduced in patients receiving a statin (34% versus 13%; 95% confidence interval, 0.25-0.43 versus 0.07-0.18; P<0.003). Statin use was associated with improved cancer-free and overall survival (both P<0.0001). A Cox regression model that analyzed the time to tumor formation with or without statin therapy, adjusted for age, male sex, type of cardiomyopathy, and immunosuppressive therapy (including switch to mTOR inhibitors or tacrolimus), demonstrated a superior survival in the statin group. Statins reduced the hazard of occurrence of any malignancy by 67% (hazard ratio, 0.33; 95% confidence interval, 0.21-0.51; P<0.0001).", 
    "3": "Although it is not possible to adjust for all potential confounders because of the very long follow-up period, this registry suggests that statin use is associated with improved cancer-free and overall survival after cardiac transplantation.

An attempt at switching over to a placebo was made with resolution of symptoms. This is the second described case in the literature of lone cough associated with statin therapy necessitating treatment discontinuation in our patient.

Cholesterol level goal attainment rates were compared in patients receiving simvastatin 40 mg/day, which was the statin dose promoted in the 2006 Dutch cardiovascular risk management guidelines, or simvastatin 20 mg/day, which was the most frequently prescribed dose up to 2006, versus other statins at various dose levels. Relative risks (RRs) were adjusted for age, sex, year of therapy initiation, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, and adherence during the 3 months before the 12-month follow-up cholesterol measurement. Compared with simvastatin 40 mg/day, cholesterol goal attainment rates were significantly higher with atorvastatin 40 mg/day (RR 1.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.28) and rosuvastatin 10 mg/day (RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.04-1.23), were similar with atorvastatin 20 mg/day (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.97-1.16) and rosuvastatin 20 mg/day (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.93-1.39), and were significantly lower with all other frequently used statin dose levels. Compared with simvastatin 20 mg/day, cholesterol goal attainment was significantly higher with any dose of atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, but were lower with any dose of pravastatin. Goal attainment rates were similar among patients with lower and higher cardiovascular risk. Among the 13-18% of patients who had follow-up cholesterol level measurements at 12 months in all statin groups, the proportion of adherent patients was approximately 75%; this was higher than the proportion of adherent patients in the total population (48-55%), which included patients without follow-up cholesterol levels.",

Cholesterol level goals were achieved by many patients using the recommended simvastatin 40 mg/day, but by fewer patients among those using the more commonly prescribed simvastatin 20 mg/day. Therefore, especially in high-risk patients, the choice of statin should be based on baseline cholesterol levels and expected reductions in these levels, and treatment should be adapted if targets are not met. Improved cholesterol level monitoring may increase adherence and cholesterol management.", 
    "16": "Mevalonic aciduria (MA), the most severe form of mevalonate kinase deficiency (MKD), is still an orphan drug disease and the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying neuronal dysfunction is still poorly understood. In our study we have investigated the apoptotic mechanism mediated by the exposure of the cultured neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y, to lovastatin in absence or in presence of the isoprenoid, geranylgeraniol, with the aim of unraveling the pathogenesis of MA. Lovastatin, blocks the mevalonate pathway inhibiting the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMG-CR), an enzyme of the mevalonate pathway upstream the mevalonate kinase enzyme, reproducing biochemical features similar to those found in MKD. We demonstrate that apoptosis in neuronal lovastatin treated-cells is induced by the mitochondrial pathway, with caspase-9 as the initiator and caspase-3 as the effector caspase. The presence of geranylgeraniol modulates both the caspase-9 and caspase-3 activity in a dose-dependent way, confirming that this isoprenoid enters the mevalonate pathway, is metabolized and finally is able to by-pass the statin biochemical block reconstituting the mevalonate pathway. According to our findings, it should not be the time course adopted that modulates the apoptotic response but rather the isoprenoid itself. Being aware that our results have been obtained using a biochemical model of MKD, and not cells from patients with the disease, we believe our findings increase the knowledge of MA pathogenesis, and may possibly contribute to the development of novel therapeutic strategies.",

Many risk factors have been identified for venous thrombosis that alter blood flow, activate the endothelium, and increase blood coagulation. However, the precise mechanisms that trigger clotting in large veins have not been fully elucidated. The most common site for initiation of the thrombus appears to be the valve pocket sinus, due to its tendency to become hypoxic. Activation of endothelial cells by hypoxia or possibly inflammatory stimuli would lead to surface expression of adhesion receptors that facilitate the binding of circulating leukocytes and microvesicles. Subsequent activation of the leukocytes induces expression of the potent procoagulant protein tissue factor that triggers thrombosis. Understanding the mechanisms of venous thrombosis may lead to the development of new treatments.",

In this study, we report for the first time direct improvement by EPA of statin-induced toxicity in cultured myoblasts and the mechanistic involvement of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Differentiated rhabdomyosarcoma cells (RD cells) were treated with statins and EPA for 1-4days. Statins induced various toxic changes in RD cells, and EPA attenuated all of these changes. Interestingly, statins increased mRNA expression of ER stress markers (XBP-1 and CHOP) and EPA attenuated both. Further, in a statin-induced rat model of rhabdomyolysis, these markers in skeletal muscle were significantly correlated with plasma CPK activity. In RD cells, statins also increased p-c-Jun protein content and caspase-3/7 activity, while 4-PBA, an ER stress attenuator, PPAR-\u03b4 agonist, and EPA attenuated them.

Here, lymphoblasts obtained from Japanese participants in the International HapMap Project were evaluated for association of expression microarray results with SNPs in the FADS gene cluster. Six SNPs in the first intron of the FADS2 gene were associated with FADS1 expression. A 10-SNP haplotype in FADS2 (rs2727270 to rs2851682) present in 24% of the population was associated with lower expression of FADS1. A highly conserved region coinciding with the most significant SNPs contained predicted binding sites for SREBP and PPAR\u03b3. Lymphoblasts homozygous for either the major or minor haplotype were treated with agonists for these transcription factors and expression of FADS1 and FADS2 determined. Simvastatin and the LXR agonist GW3965 both upregulated expression of FADS1 and FADS2; no response was found for PPAR\u03b3 agonist rosiglitazone. The minor haplotype homozygotes had 20-40% higher induction of FADS1 and FADS2 after simvastatin or GW3965 treatment. A 22 bp polymorphic insertion-deletion (INDEL) was found 137 bp downstream from the putative sterol response element, as well as a 3 or 1 bp INDEL 81-83 bp downstream.

    "63": "Pharmacogenetics primarily uses genetic variation to identify subgroups of patients who may respond differently to a certain medication. Since its first description, the field of pharmacogenetics has expanded to study a broad range of cardiovascular drugs and has become a mainstream research discipline. Three principle classes of pharmacogenetic markers have emerged: 1) pharmacokinetic; 2) pharmacodynamic; and 3) underlying disease mechanism. In the realm of cardiovascular pharmacogenetics, significant advances have identified markers in each class for a variety of therapeutics, some with a potential for improving patient outcomes. While ongoing clinical trials will determine if routine use of pharmacogenetic testing may be beneficial, the data today support pharmacogenetic testing for certain variants on an individualized, case-by-case basis. Our primary goal is to review the association data for the major pharmacogenetic variants associated with commonly used cardiovascular medications: antiplatelet agents, warfarin, statins, beta-blockers, diuretics, and antiarrhythmic drugs. In addition, we highlight which variants and in which contexts pharmacogenetic testing can be implemented by practicing clinicians. The pace of genetic discovery has outstripped the generation of the evidence justifying its clinical adoption. Until the evidentiary gaps are filled, however, clinicians may choose to target therapeutics to individual patients whose genetic background indicates that they stand to benefit the most from pharmacogenetic testing.",

These results appeared independent of internal changes in ubiquinone or juvenile hormone levels. Rather, they appeared to involve decreased protein prenylation. Simvastatin decreased the membrane association (prenylation) of specific small Ras GTPases in mice. Both farnesyl (L744832) and type 1 geranylgeranyl transferase (GGTI-298) inhibitors increased Drosophila lifespan.

    "93": "Vascular aging is the term that describes the structural and functional disturbances of the vasculature with advancing aging. The molecular mechanisms of aging-associated endothelial dysfunction are complex, but reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and altered vascular expression and activity of NO synthase (NOS) enzymes have been implicated as major players. Impaired vascular relaxation in aging has been attributed to reduced endothelial NOS (eNOS)-derived NO, while increased inducible NOS (iNOS) expression seems to account for nitrosative stress and disrupted vascular homeostasis. Although eNOS is considered the main source of NO in the vascular endothelium, neuronal NOS (nNOS) also contributes to endothelial cells-derived NO, a mechanism that is reduced in aging. Pharmacological modulation of NO generation and expression/activity of NOS isoforms may represent a therapeutic alternative to prevent the progression of cardiovascular diseases. Accordingly, this review will focus on drugs that modulate NO bioavailability, such as nitrite anions and NO-releasing non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, hormones (dehydroepiandrosterone and estrogen), statins, resveratrol, and folic acid, since they may be useful to treat/to prevent aging-associated vascular dysfunction.

Therefore, the aims of this study were to develop a novel method for determining drug switching from routinely acquired NHS health data and to explore the aspect of continuation of care for patients. Patients who were first prescribed ramipril, simvastatin and an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) between 1 March 2004 and 28 February 2007 and discontinued their medication within 6 months of the index prescription were identified from the PTI database. The identified patients were then categorized into three groups: i) patients who were switched to a different drug for the same medical condition, ii) patients who were being prescribed with other types of antihypertensive/lipid-regulating drug prior to the initiation of study; and iii) patients who were without any continuation of care or therapy. Twenty percent (808), 29%(1429) and 14%(455) of the identified patients discontinued ramipril, simvastatin and ARB, respectively, within 6 months of an index prescription. Among the ramipril discontinuation group, 36.4% of the patients were switched to another antihypertensive, while another 31.6% of them were without continuation of care.

The nanoparticles were prepared by nanoprecipitation method. The effects of polymer concentration, PEG content and polysorbate 80 coating on the particle size, drug loading efficiency and release behaviour of nanoparticles were investigated. Additionally, cellular uptake and brain targeting of formulated nanoparticles were studied. Particle sizes were in the range of 30-172\u2009nm depending on formulation parameters. Increasing the polymer concentration significantly increased the nanoparticle size. Decreasing the PEG content from 15% to 5% (w/w) in polymer composition increased the nanoparticle size from 69 to 172\u2009nm.

    "102": "The underlying disorder in the vast majority of cases of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is atherosclerosis, for which low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is recognized as the first and foremost risk factor. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, popularly called statins, are highly effective and remarkably safe in reducing LDL-C and non-HDL-C levels. Evidence from clinical trials have demonstrated that statin therapy can reduce the risk of myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, death, and the need for coronary artery revascularization procedures (CARPs) by 25-50%, depending on the magnitude of LDL-C lowering achieved. Benefits are seen in men and women, young and old, and in people with and without diabetes or prior diagnosis of CVD. Clinical trials comparing standard statin therapy to intensive statin therapy have clearly demonstrated greater benefits in CVD risk reduction (including halting the progression and even reversing coronary atherosclerosis) without any corresponding increase in risk. Numerous outcome trials of intensive statin therapy using atorvastatin 80 mg/d have demonstrated the safety and the benefits of lowering LDL-C to very low levels. This led the USNCEP Guideline Committee to standardize 40 mg/dL as the optimum LDL-C level, above which the CVD risk begins to rise. Recent studies have shown intensive statin therapy can also lower CVD events even in low-risk individuals with LDL-C <110 mg/dL. Because of the heightened risk of CVD in Asian Indians, the LDL-C target is set at 30 mg/dL lower than that recommended by NCEP. Accordingly, the LDL-C goal is < 70 mg/dL for Indians who have CVD, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, or chronic kidney disease. Intensive statin therapy is often required in these populations as well as others who require a > or = 50% reduction in LDL-C. Broader acceptance of this lower LDL-C targets and its implementation could reduce the CVD burden in the Indian population by 50% in the next 25 years. Clinical trial data support an extremely favorable benefit-to-risk ratio of intensive statin therapy with some but not all statins. Atorvastatin 80 mg/d is 100 times safer than aspirin 81 mg/d and 10 times safer than diabetic medications. Intensive statin therapy is more effective and safe compared to intensive control of blood sugar or blood pressure in patients with diabetes.", 
    "103": "The clinical importance of lowering of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) to decrease cardiovascular (CV) risk has been verified over many years starting with significant support in 1984 of the then previous lipid hypothesis. Significant support of this hypothesis began that year with publication of the Lipid Research Clinic study. Since then, multiple other studies including outcomes studies have established the value of LDL-C reduction in decreasing CV risk. In addition, multiple other factors such as inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, nitric oxide, antioxidant properties, and plaque stabilization appear important for modifying CV risk and possible favorable alterations by medications such as statins must be considered. Nevertheless, reduction of LDL-C has well-established value and is being accepted by clinicians as a major guideline for CV disease prevention. However, there are still problems with adherence by many clinicians to CV risk modification. Therefore, abandoning LDL-C reduction as a target, as has been advocated by some, appears premature and contraindicated. A strategy of LDL-C reduction in no way interferes with increased understanding of the complexities of atherosclerosis and new approaches to CV disease prevention as they become supported by outcomes studies.", 
    "104": "Lovastatin is an important statin prescribed for the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Biosynthesis of lovastatin uses an iterative type I polyketide synthase (PKS). LovC is a trans-acting enoyl reductase (ER) that specifically reduces three out of eight possible polyketide intermediates during lovastatin biosynthesis. Such trans-acting ERs have been reported across a variety of other fungal PKS enzymes as a strategy in nature to diversify polyketides. How LovC achieves such specificity is unknown. The 1.9-\u00c5 structure of LovC reveals that LovC possesses a medium-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (MDR) fold with a unique monomeric assembly. Two LovC cocrystal structures and enzymological studies help elucidate the molecular basis of LovC specificity, define stereochemistry, and identify active-site residues. Sequence alignment indicates a general applicability to trans-acting ERs of fungal PKSs, as well as their potential application to directing biosynthesis.",

We studied the effect of rosuvastatin on acute myocardial infarction induced experimentally in rats focusing on angiogenesis as a potential mechanism underlying the drug effect. Acute myocardial infarction was induced by injecting the rats with two doses of isoproterenol (85 mg/kg/24 h, s.c.). Rats were examined for their electrocardiographic pattern and myocardial fibrosis one week after injection of isoproterenol (time for initiating therapy) and eight weeks thereafter (the end of therapeutic period) to examine the progression of the injury. Examination of the heart tissues at the end of week 9 showed a non significant decrease in the degree of myocardial fibrosis compared to those observed at week 1, indicating a slow rate of recovery from isoproterenol-induced injury. Treatment with rosuvastatin (5 or 10 mg/kg) for 8 weeks in myocardial-infarct rats enhanced the electrocardiographic pattern, reduced serum cardiac biomarkers, reduced tissue tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and upregulated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) level. In addition, immunohistochemical staining revealed higher expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), VEGF and CD(34) (a marker for microvessel density) in the cardiac tissues after treatment with rosuvastatin compared to control group. The immunostaining for VEGF was positively correlated with microvessel density and iNOS. Overall, the current results provide evidence that the effect of rosuvastatin on myocardial-infarct rats involves induction of angiogenesis.",

Furthermore, statin therapy significantly reduces vascular mortality and morbidity in patients with less than 1% annual risk of a major vascular event.

Proinflammatory responses including MCP-1, Iba-1, and TNF-\u03b1 preceded and possibly contributed to SP formation. Pitavastatin has the same significant pleiotrophic effect to prevent and ameliorate inflammation and also has a long-term effect compared with atorvastatin, and both of them have high potential for a preventative approach in patients at risk of AD.",

Rats with mean arterial blood pressure \u2265 140 mm Hg (1 mm Hg = 133.322 Pa) were selected as hypertensive. Vascular endothelium dysfunction was assessed in terms of attenuation of acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation (isolated aortic ring preparation), decrease in serum nitrate and (or) nitrite level, as well as reduced level of glutathione and disruption of integrity of vascular endothelium (histopathology). Five weeks of DOCA administration were followed by 7 days of daily administration of PI3K\u03b3 inhibitor (5-[[5-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-furanyl]methylene]-2,4-thiazolidinedione (CAY10505), 0.6 mg\u00b7kg(-1), per os (p.o.)), atorvastatin (30 mg\u00b7kg(-1), p.o.), and losartan (25 mg\u00b7kg(-1), p.o.) (positive control of hypertension), which significantly improved acetylcholine-induced endothelium dependent relaxation, serum nitrate and (or) nitrite level, glutathione level, and the vascular endothelial lining in hypertensive rats.Therefore, it may be concluded that CAY10505, a specific inhibitor of PI3K\u03b3, improves hypertension-associated vascular endothelial dysfunction. Thus, inhibition of PI3K\u03b3 might be a useful approach in the therapeutics of vascular endothelium dysfunction.", 
    "129": "Cirrhosis is a major health problem, being the 5th cause of death in the U.K. and 12th in the U.S., but 4th in the 45 to 54 age group. Until recently cirrhosis was considered a single and terminal disease stage, with an inevitably poor prognosis. However, it is now clear that 1-year mortality can range from 1% in early cirrhosis to 57% in decompensated disease. As the only treatment for advanced cirrhosis is liver transplantation, what is urgently needed is strategies to prevent transition to decompensated stages. The evidence we present in this review clearly demonstrates that management of patients with cirrhosis should change from an expectant algorithm that treats complications as they occur, to preventing the advent of all complications while in the compensated phase. This requires maintaining patients in an asymptomatic phase and not significantly affecting their quality of life with minimal impairment due to the therapies themselves. This could be achieved with lifestyle changes and combinations of already licensed and low-cost drugs, similar to the paradigm of treating risk factors for cardiovascular disease. The drugs are propranolol, simvastatin, norfloxacin, and warfarin, which in combination would cost \u00a3128/patient annually-equivalent to U.S. $196/year. This treatment strategy requires randomized controlled trials to establish improvements in outcomes. In the 21st century, cirrhosis should be regarded as a potentially treatable disease with currently available and inexpensive therapies.",

We aimed to evaluate the association between statin use before onset and both initial severity and functional outcome in ischemic stroke patients. All cases of first-ever ischemic stroke that occurred in Dijon, France (151,000 inhabitants) between 2006 and 2011 were prospectively identified from the Dijon Stroke Registry. Vascular risk factors, clinical severity at onset assessed by the NIHSS score, stroke subtypes, prestroke statin use, and lipid profile were collected. Functional outcome was defined by a six-level categorical outcome using the modified Rankin scale. Analyses were performed using ordinal logistic regression models. Among the 953 patients with first-ever ischemic stroke, 127 (13.3 %) had previously been treated with statins. Initial stroke severity did not differ between statin users and non-users [median NIHSS score (interquartile range) 4.0 (7.0) versus 4.0 (9.0) p = 0.104]. In unadjusted analysis, statin use was associated with a lower risk of an unfavorable functional outcome at discharge (OR 0.69; 95 % CI 0.49-0.96; p = 0.026) that was no longer significant in multivariate analyses (OR 0.76; 95 % CI 0.53-1.09; p = 0.134). After adjustment for admission plasma LDL cholesterol levels, the non-significant association was still observed (OR 0.76; 95 % CI 0.49-1.18; p = 0.221). This population-based study showed that prestroke statin therapy did not affect initial clinical severity but was associated with a non-significant better early functional outcome after ischemic stroke.",

The underlying mechanisms of AV fistula failure in diabetes are still poorly understood and there are limited therapeutic approaches that can increase the lifespan of these fistulas. The present study demonstrates that oral administration rosuvastatin improves blood flow and endothelial function of AC fistulas in rats with diabetes, which results from attenuating the activity of proinflammatory genes in the remodeled vasculature, thereby reducing the generation of tissue superoxide anions. Our results may thus enhance our ability to prevent and manage vascular access failure in patients with diabetes with chronic renal disease.",

While statin therapy and therefore low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction could lower coronary heart disease considerably; cardiovascular morbidity and mortality still occur in a significant portion of subjects already receiving therapy. Therefore, new strategies and therapies are needed to further reduce the risk. Raising HDL-C was thought to achieve this goal. However, established drug therapies resulting in substantial HDL-C increase are scarce and their effect is controversial. Furthermore, it is becoming increasingly evident that HDL particle functionality is at least as important as HDL-C levels since HDL particles not only promote reverse cholesterol transport from the periphery (mainly macrophages) to the liver but also exert pleiotropic effects on inflammation, haemostasis and apoptosis.

In the first part of this review, we describe the potential mechanisms whereby statins can modulate the pathological processes associated to experimental and human AAA. Among them, statins are able to regulate leukocyte recruitment and immuno-inflammatory responses, platelet activation, oxidative stress, proteolysis and extracellular matrix breakdown. However, controversial results have been obtained in experimental models of AAA. In the second part of this review, we analyze the effect of statins in both, cardiovascular events on AAA patients and AAA growth. Although statin treatment is recommended for all AAA patients with the aim of reducing the incidence of cardiovascular events and death, controversial results have been shown between experimental and clinical studies regarding the potential preventive effect on AAA growth. One potential reason for these discrepancies could be related to the fact that statins reduce total cholesterol concentrations but do not modify HDL concentrations, the most sensitive predictor of AAA among lipid markers.

The Zol and Fluva transcriptomic profiles of treated MDA-MB-231 cells revealed analogous patterns of affected genes, but each of them reached with different kinetics. The observable changes in gene expression started after 24 h for Fluva IC(50 72 h) and only after 48 h for Zol IC(50 72 h). To obtain early changes in gene expression of Zol-treated cells, a 3 times higher dose of Zol IC(50 72 h) had to be applied. Combining Fluva and Zol in vivo showed no synergy, but a benefit of several days in survival of mice. This study demonstrated that Zol or Fluva is of potential clinical use for the treatment of established metastasis.", 
    "179": "The premature stopping of the AIM-HIGH (Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome with Low HDL/High Triglycerides: Impact on Global Health) study due to futility has called into question the clinical value of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) increases. The failure of estrogen therapy in the HERS (Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study) trial and the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors torcetrapib (in the ILLUMINATE [Investigation of Lipid Level Management to Understand Its Impact in Atherosclerotic Events] trial) and, most recently, dalcetrapib in the dal-OUTCOMES trial has cast doubt on the \"HDL-raising hypothesis\" for providing additional benefits on top of statin therapy. The AIM-HIGH trial was designed to equalize low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels between the two treatment groups while the niacin arm would have a higher HDL-C. The study population included patients with low HDL-C and cardiovascular disease (CVD); because this population has a high residual risk for CVD on statin therapy, these patients were most likely to benefit from the niacin HDL-C-raising effect. These findings are disappointing because clinicians have used extended-release niacin to treat patients with low HDL-C because niacin has demonstrated benefit in earlier reported studies in conjunction with statins and other drugs, as observed in the Cholesterol Lowering Atherosclerosis Study (CLAS) and the HDL-Atherosclerosis Treatment Study (HATS). In the Coronary Drug Project, niacin alone was shown to reduce myocardial infarction, stroke, and the need for coronary bypass surgery. Niacin does not increase the number of HDL particles to the same extent it raises HDL-C. Niacin alters the composition of HDL, making the particle larger, which is similar to the effects of CETP inhibition on HDL. Both niacin and CETP inhibitors decrease the catabolism of HDL, thereby increasing the size of the HDL particle and raising HDL-C. Dalcetrapib, which does not decrease LDL-C while raising HDL-C, was recently discontinued from clinical development due to a interim analysis that determined that the study was futile. Anacetrapib, which markedly increases HDL-C while also significantly lowering LDL-C, remains in clinical development, with a large cardiovascular end point trial currently enrolling 30,000 high-risk patients. For now, the goal remains the achievement of LDL-C and non-HDL targets, and low HDL-c remains a significant independent risk factor, but there is insufficient evidence that raising HDL-C will provide a clinical benefit.", 
    "180": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a common cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Several factors contribute to the onset and progression of atherosclerosis and CVD in CKD patients. Most of the cases of coronary heart disease in the general population can be explained by traditional risk factors, whereas non-traditional risk factors, including oxidative stress, anemia, inflammation, malnutrition, vascular calcification, and endothelial dysfunction, have been proposed to play a central role in the pathogenesis of CVD in CKD patients. However, the precise mechanism of CVD initiation in CKD patients remains unclear. Lipid-lowering therapies may decrease proteinuria, and increase or maintain renal function. Because the serum levels of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins are increased in CKD patients, particularly in advanced stages, the serum non-HDL cholesterol level may be a better biomarker of dyslipidemia than the serum LDL cholesterol level in this population. A meta-analysis showed that statin therapy was associated with decreased albuminuria in comparison with a placebo. Moreover, lipid-lowering therapy with statins is effective in reducing the risk of CVD in the early stages of CKD, whereas the benefit of statins in patients with end-stage renal disease may be limited.", 
    "181": "LC-UV-MS/MS analysis of leaf extracts from 146 accessions of 71 species of Rosa revealed that some taxa accumulated flavonol O-glycosides acylated with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid, which are relatively uncommon in plants. The structures of two previously unrecorded examples isolated from Rosa spinosissima L. (syn. Rosa pimpinellifolia L.) were elucidated using spectroscopic and chemical methods as the 3-O-\u03b1-L-rhamnopyranosyl-(1\u21922)-[6-O-(3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl)-\u03b2-D-galactopyranosides] of kaempferol (3,5,7,4'-tetrahydroxyflavone) and quercetin (3,5,7,3',4'-pentahydroxyflavone). The corresponding 3-O-[6-O-(3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl)-\u03b2-D-galactopyranoside] of quercetin was also present in R. spinosissima, but at lower levels, together with 17 other flavonol O-glycosides for which structures were assigned using LC-UV-MS/MS. The distribution of flavonol 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarylgalactosides in Rosa was limited to some species of subgenus Rosa section Pimpinellifoliae and Rosa roxburghii Sw. of the monotypic subgenus Platyrhodon, indicating that this character could be of value in phylogenetic analyses of the genus.", 
    "182": "We have demonstrated previously that focal adhesion kinase (FAK)/RhoA alteration by the aryl-hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonist 3-methylcholanthrene (3MC) is involved in the antimigratory effects of 3MC in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells. Here, we identified that signaling properties and molecular mechanisms of RhoA/\u03b2-catenin were both implicated in alterations to blood-brain barrier integrity. The mechanisms of action were the down-regulation of integrin, the extracellular matrix, and adherens junction stability. PTEN phosphorylation by 3MC-mediated AhR/RhoA activation increased the proteasomal degradation of \u03b2-catenin through PKC\u03b4/pGSK3\u03b2-mediated \u03b2-catenin phosphorylation; the crucial roles of AhR/RhoA in this process were verified by using gain- or loss-of-function experiments. The decrease in \u03b2-catenin led to decreased expression of fibronectin and \u03b15\u03b21 integrin. Additionally, protein interactions among FAK, VE-cadherin, vinculin, and \u03b2-actin were simultaneously decreased, resulting in adherens junction instability. Novel functional TCF/LEF1 binding sites in the promoter regions of fibronectin and \u03b15/\u03b21 integrin were identified by electrophoretic mobility shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. The results indicate that the binding activities of \u03b2-catenin decreased in mouse cerebrovascular endothelial cells treated with 3MC. In addition, simvastatin and pravastatin treatment reversed 3MC-mediated alterations in mouse cerebrovascular endothelial cells by RhoA inactivation, and the in vitro findings were substantiated by an in vivo blood-brain barrier assay. Thus, endothelial barrier dysfunction due to 3MC occurs through AhR/RhoA-mediated \u03b2-catenin down-regulation, which is reversed by simvastatin treatment in vivo.", 
    "183": "The hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors, better known as statins, are principally used in the treatment of hyperlipidemia and play a pivotal role in the primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic heart disease and stroke. Evidence also exists for the potential benefits from statin use in a variety of other disease processes, conferred via their non-lipid lowering properties, which are known as pleiotropic effects. Our paper serves as a focused and updated discussion on the pleiotropic effects of statins in neurological disorders. Emphasis is placed on the discussion of randomized, placebo-controlled trials, and their importance in further elucidating this interesting phenomenon.", 
    "184": "Although intensive lipid lowering by statins can enhance plaque stability, few data exist regarding how early statins change plaque composition and morphology in clinical setting. Therefore, to examine early changes in plaque composition and morphology by intensive lipid lowering with statins, we evaluate coronary plaques from acute coronary syndrome (ACS) before and 3 weeks after lipid lowering by coronary CT angiography. We enrolled 110 patients with suspected ACS and underwent coronary CT. We defined plaque as unstable when CT number of plaque< 50HU and remodeling index (lesion diameter/reference diameter) >1.10. Rosuvastatin (5 mg/day) or atorvastatin (20 mg/day) were introduced to reduce low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Then, CT was again performed by the same condition 3 weeks after lipid lowering therapy. Total 10 patients (8 men, mean age 72.0 years), in whom informed consent regarding serial CT examination was obtained, were analyzed. Among them, 4 patients who denied to have intensive lipid lowering were served as controls. In remaining 6 patients, LDL-C reduced from 129.5\u00b126.9 mg/dl to 68.5\u00b111.1 mg/dl after statin treatment. Under these conditions, CT number of the targeted plaque significantly increased from 16.0\u00b115.9 to 50.8\u00b135.0 HU (p<0.05) and remodeling index decreased from 1.22\u00b10.11 to 1.11\u00b10.06 (p<0.05), although these values substantially unchanged in controls. These results demonstrate that MDCT-determined plaque composition as well as volume could be changed within 3 weeks after intensive lipid lowering. This may explain acute effects of statins in treatment of acute coronary syndrome.", 
    "185": "Growing human atherosclerotic plaques show a progressive loss of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) becoming soft and vulnerable. Lipid loaded-VSMC show impaired vascular repair function and motility due to changes in cytoskeleton proteins involved in cell-migration. Clinical benefits of statins reducing coronary events have been related to repopulation of vulnerable plaques with VSMC. Here, we investigated whether HMG-CoA reductase inhibition with rosuvastatin can reverse the effects induced by atherogenic concentrations of LDL either in the native (nLDL) form or modified by aggregation (agLDL) on human VSMC motility. Using a model of wound repair, we showed that treatment of human coronary VSMC with rosuvastatin significantly prevented (and reversed) the inhibitory effect of nLDL and agLDL in the repair of the cell depleted areas. In addition, rosuvastatin significantly abolished the agLDL-induced dephosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain as demonstrated by 2DE-electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Besides, confocal microscopy showed that rosuvastatin enhances actin-cytoskeleton reorganization during lipid-loaded-VSMC attachment and spreading. The effects of rosuvastatin on actin-cytoskeleton dynamics and cell migration were dependent on ROCK-signalling. Furthermore, rosuvastatin caused a significant increase in RhoA-GTP in the cytosol of VSMC. Taken together, our study demonstrated that inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase restores the migratory capacity and repair function of VSMC that is impaired by native and aggregated LDL. This mechanism may contribute to the stabilization of lipid-rich atherosclerotic plaques afforded by statins.", 
    "186": "Mitochondrial translation, essential for synthesis of the electron transport chain complexes in the mitochondria, is governed by nuclear encoded genes. Polymorphisms within these genes are increasingly being implicated in disease and may also trigger adverse drug reactions. Statins, a class of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors used to treat hypercholesterolemia, are among the most widely prescribed drugs in the world. However, a significant proportion of users suffer side effects of varying severity that commonly affect skeletal muscle. The mitochondria are one of the molecular targets of statins, and these drugs have been known to uncover otherwise silent mitochondrial mutations. Based on yeast genetic studies, we identify the mitochondrial translation factor MEF2 as a mediator of atorvastatin toxicity. The human ortholog of MEF2 is the Elongation Factor Gene (EF-G) 2, which has previously been shown to play a specific role in mitochondrial ribosome recycling. Using small interfering RNA (siRNA) silencing of expression in human cell lines, we demonstrate that the EF-G2mt gene is required for cell growth on galactose medium, signifying an essential role for this gene in aerobic respiration. Furthermore, EF-G2mt silenced cell lines have increased susceptibility to cell death in the presence of atorvastatin. Using yeast as a model, conserved amino acid variants, which arise from non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the EF-G2mt gene, were generated in the yeast MEF2 gene. Although these mutations do not produce an obvious growth phenotype, three mutations reveal an atorvastatin-sensitive phenotype and further analysis uncovers a decreased respiratory capacity. These findings constitute the first reported phenotype associated with SNPs in the EF-G2mt gene and implicate the human EF-G2mt gene as a pharmacogenetic candidate gene for statin toxicity in humans.", 
    "187": "The type 2 iodothyronine selenodeiodinase (D2) is a critical determinant of local thyroid signaling, converting T(4) to the active form T(3) at the cytoplasmic face of the endoplasmic reticulum, thus supplying the nucleus with T(3) without immediately affecting circulating thyroid hormone levels. Although inhibitors of the cholesterol synthesis/isoprenylation pathway, such as hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) have been to shown to down-regulate selenoproteins via interruption of normal selenocysteine incorporation, little is known about the effect of statins on D2. Here, we report that statins and prenyl transferase inhibitors actually increase D2 activity in cells with endogenous D2 expression. Although we confirmed that lovastatin (LVS) decreases the activity of transiently expressed D2 in HEK-293 cells, the prenyl transferase inhibitors increase activity in this system as well. LVS treatment increases endogenous Dio2 mRNA in MSTO-211H cells but does not alter transiently expressed Dio2 mRNA in HEK-293 cells. The prenyl transferase inhibitors do not increase Dio2 mRNA in either system, indicating that a posttranscriptional mechanism must exist. Cotreatment with LVS or the prenyl transferase inhibitors with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 did not lead to additive increases in D2 activity, indirectly implicating the ubiquitin-proteasomal system in the mechanism. Finally, C57BL/6J mice treated with LVS or farnesyl transferase inhibitor-277 for 24 h exhibited increased D2 activity in their brown adipose tissue. These data indicate that statins and downstream inhibitors of the isoprenylation pathway may increase thyroid signaling via stimulation of D2 activity.", 
    "188": "Diabetes is a significant risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD), particularly in the presence of high blood pressure, poor glycaemic control and high total cholesterol. While efforts to control blood pressure or blood glucose beyond levels considered 'normal' in patients with diabetes have not produced the expected reduction in CVD, treatment with statins to reduce levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) has been much more successful. However, many patients with diabetes who receive statins (even at high doses) remain at significant residual risk of CVD due to the presence of atherogenic dyslipidaemia. Markers of persisting risk include low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), high levels of triglycerides (TG) and LDL-C levels above target despite high-dose statin therapy. Combining statins with drugs that target HDL-C and TG, such as fibrates, niacin and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) ethyl esters, may offer further protection from CVD in patients with diabetes.", 
    "189": "For the first time, a carboxyl group derivatization assay has been developed and validated for the determination of the cholesterol-lowering drug rosuvastatin in human serum at picogram level by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. The assay procedure involved a simple one-step liquid-liquid extraction of rosuvastatin with lovastatin as internal standard from serum with an ethyl acetate-methyl tertiary buthyl ether (1:1) mixture. After pre-column derivatization with 9-anthryldiazomethane at room temperature for one hour, the reaction mixture was injected onto a Phenomenex, Synergi C18 column (250 \u00d7 4.6 mm, 4 \u00b5 i.d.). The analytes were separated with a mobile phase composed of acetonitrile-water in gradient elution mode and detected at \u03bb(em) = 410 nm, exciting at 366 nm. Calibration curves were constructed in concentration range of 0.01-20.0 ng/mL and limit of detection and limit of quantification values were found to be 0.68 and 2.30 pg/mL, respectively. To test suitability of the developed methods for clinic use, the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin were investigated after oral administration of a 20 mg rosuvastatin film tablet to a healthy volunteer and maximum plasma concentration, time to reach that concentration and elimination half life were found to be 17.5 ng/mL, 3.5 h and 18.09 h, respectively.", 
    "190": "Statins, a class of naturally-occurring compounds that inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, are known to increase endogenous bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) expression. Local administration of statins has been shown to stimulate fracture repair in in vivo animal experiments. However, the ability of statins to heal more challenging critical-sized defects at the mid-diaphyseal region in long bones has not been investigated. In this study, we examined the potential of injectable lovastatin microparticles combined with biodegradable polyurethane (PUR) scaffolds in preclinical animal models: metaphyseal small plug defects and diaphyseal segmental bone defects in rat femora. Sustained release of lovastatin from the lovastatin microparticles was achieved over 14 days. The released lovastatin was bioactive, as evidenced by its ability to stimulate BMP-2 gene expression in osteoblastic cells. Micro-computed tomography (CT) and histological examinations showed that lovastatin microparticles, injected into PUR scaffolds implanted in femoral plug defects, enhanced new bone formation. Furthermore, bi-weekly multiple injections of lovastatin microparticles into PUR scaffolds implanted in critical-sized femoral segmental defects resulted in increased new bone formation compared to the vehicle control. In addition, bridging of the defect with newly formed bone was observed in four of nine defects in the lovastatin microparticle treatment group, whereas none of the defects in the vehicle group showed bridging. These observations suggest that local delivery of lovastatin combined with PUR scaffold can be an effective approach for treatment of orthopaedic bone defects and that multiple injections of lovastatin may be useful for large defects.", 
    "191": "Evidences from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for the efficiency of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) on the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are conflicting. Here we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs to evaluate the efficiency and safety of TCM in the treatment of NAFLD. Studies were searched on PubMed and China National Knowledge Infrastructure from January 1995 to June 2010. RCTs comparing either TCM formulations alone or in combination with placebo, ursodeoxycholic acid, insulin sensitizers, lipid-lowering drugs, or antioxidants were included. The category of most usually used herbs in the treatment of NAFLD was also calculated. Five thousand nine hundred and four patients from 62 RCTs were included for meta-analysis and 25,661 patients from 419 clinical studies were for TCM formulation analysis. Comparing with western medicines mentioned above, TCM had a better effect on the normalization of alanine aminotransferase and disappearance of radiological steatosis in the treatment of NAFLD. Furthermore, 246 kinds of Chinese herbs were included in our present study, with an average of 10 herbs (range 1-31) in each formulation. Hawthorn Fruit (321 times in 17,670 patients) was the most often used herb in the treatment of NAFLD. In conclusion, TCM is of modest benefit to the treatment of NAFLD.",

During the last decade, an increasing number of studies have therefore focused on the anti-angiogenic treatment of the disease. The present review provides a systematic overview of these studies and critically discusses the future role of anti-angiogenic therapy in the multimodal management of endometriosis. METHODS Literature searches were performed in PubMed, MEDLINE and ISI Web of Knowledge for original articles published before the end of March 2012, written in the English language and focusing on anti-angiogenic approaches for the therapy of endometriosis. The searches included both animal and human studies. RESULTS Numerous compounds of different substance groups have been shown to exert anti-angiogenic effects on endometriotic lesions under experimental in vitro and in vivo conditions. These include growth factor inhibitors, endogenous angiogenesis inhibitors, fumagillin analogues, statins, cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors, phytochemical compounds, immunomodulators, dopamine agonists, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists, progestins, danazol and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists. However, clinical evidence for their efficacy in anti-angiogenic endometriosis therapy is still lacking. CONCLUSIONS Anti-angiogenic compounds hold great promise for the future treatment of endometriosis because they may inhibit the establishment of new endometriotic lesions in early stages of the disease or after surgical treatment. Further experimental studies, controlled clinical trials in particular, are required now to clarify which compounds fulfil these expectations without inducing severe side effects in patients with endometriosis.", 
    "193": "Despite potent antibiotics, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains the most common cause of death from infection and the eighth overall leading cause of death in the United States. For this reason, adjunctive therapeutic measures directed at the host response rather than the pathogen are attractive. The immunomodulatory effects of macrolide antibiotics may play a significant role in management of severe CAP. The existing literature does not demonstrate a clear benefit for corticosteroids, but larger prospective randomized trials are needed. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs may benefit oxygenation but have no documented effect on mortality. Statin use before CAP diagnosis is associated with improved outcome but requires further research to determine if initiation at the time of diagnosis will affect outcome positively. Activation of the coagulation system appears to be a major pathophysiological event in severe pneumonia, but neither drotrecogin alfa activated nor tifacogin (recombinant tissue factor pathway inhibitor) have demonstrated a survival benefit. Other therapies have theoretical benefit but are not yet in the stage of clinical trials.", 
    "194": "Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) are often caused by rupture of non-flow limiting \"vulnerable\" atherosclerotic plaque, characterised by a large necrotic core pool and a thin, inflamed fibrous cap that are unidentifiable with diagnostic coronary angiography. The implementation of novel invasive imaging modalities, such as intravascular ultrasound-virtual histology (IVUS-VH) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), could help identify high-risk patients who are in need of aggressive medical therapy. The intake of high dose rosuvastatin has been shown to reduce plaque containing necrotic core in the carotid arteries, however it remains unknown whether there is a similar effect in the coronary arteries.",

All patients undergoing diagnostic angiography or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) are eligible for participation. Recruitment started in early 2010 and will continue until 350 patients are included. The effect on the lipid core containing plaque will be assessed with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) at 12-months. In addition, multiple biomarkers will be measured and their levels correlated with the imaging results.",

    "197": "3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are cholesterol-lowering drugs that exert other cellular effects and underlie their beneficial health effects, including those associated with myocardial remodeling. We recently demonstrated that statins induces apoptosis and autophagy in human lung mesenchymal cells. Here, we extend our knowledge showing that statins simultaneously induces activation of the apoptosis, autophagy and the unfolded protein response (UPR) in primary human atrial fibroblasts (hATF). Thus we tested the degree to which coordination exists between signaling from mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum and lysosomes during response to simvastatin exposure. Pharmacologic blockade of the activation of ER-dependent cysteine-dependent aspartate-directed protease (caspase)-4 and lysosomal cathepsin-B and -L significantly decreased simvastatin-induced cell death. Simvastatin altered total abundance and the mitochondrial fraction of proapoptotic and antiapoptotic proteins, while c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase mediated effects on B-cell lymphoma 2 expression. Chemical inhibition of autophagy flux with bafilomycin-A1 augmented simvastatin-induced caspase activation, UPR and cell death. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts that are deficient in autophagy protein 5 and refractory to autophagy induction, caspase-7 and UPR were hyper-induced upon treatment with simvastatin. These data demonstrate that mevalonate cascade inhibition-induced death of hATF manifests from a complex mechanism involving co-regulation of apoptosis, autophagy and UPR. Furthermore, autophagy has a crucial role in determining the extent of ER stress, UPR and permissiveness of hATF to cell death induced by statins.", 
    "198": "Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), atorvastatin (ATST), and their combination have been previously shown to inhibit colon carcinogenesis in animal models. We further investigated their inhibitory activities in azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-treated Balb/cJ mice and CD-1 mice in 2 slightly different models. The mice were maintained on the AIN93M diet, or a similar diet containing 0.03%, 0.1%, or 0.3% EGCG; 60-ppm ATST; or a combination of 0.1% EGCG and 60-ppm ATST. Unexpectedly, no significant inhibitory activity was observed, and some of the treatment groups resulted in higher tumor multiplicity. To study the effects of EGCG on colon inflammation, CD-1 or C57BL/6 mice were treated with 1.5% DSS for 7 days and sacrificed 3 days later. DSS induced rectal bleeding and colon shortening; treatment with 0.5% EGCG exacerbated the bleeding and decreased mouse body weight. Dietary 0.5% EGCG also increased serum levels of leukotriene B4 and prostaglandin E2. These results suggest that, in mice bearing colon inflammation, high concentrations of EGCG and ATST enhance colon bleeding and may promote colon carcinogenesis."
