The intraluminal wire injury of the mouse femoral artery induced significant leukocyte recruitment to the injured area and oxidative stress within 24\u2009h. Administration of low-dose amlodipine (0.5\u2009mg\u2009kg(-1) per day) or atorvastatin (1\u2009mg\u2009kg(-1) per day) alone for 7 days failed to modulate leukocyte adhesion, whereas their co-administration for 7 days significantly inhibited leukocyte adhesion. Moreover, flow cytometric analysis showed that injury-induced oxidative stress and CD11b expression in three leukocyte fractions were elevated after injury and then reduced after the co-administration. Next, adoptive transfer of mononuclear cells (MNCs) was performed and MNCs were harvested from mice after wire injury exhibited adhesion to the recipient injured artery. Furthermore, the co-administration of low-dose atorvastatin and amlodipine to MNCs or the vasculature reduced the recruitment of MNCs to the injured artery. Our findings indicate that amlodipine and atorvastatin synergistically inhibit vascular inflammation. The underlying mechanisms of their effect involve, at least in part, stabilizing oxidative stress at the point of injury, suggesting the clinical efficacy of this drug combination for the treatment of vascular diseases.",

    "15": "PPARs and LXRs are ligand-activated transcription factors that are emerging as promising therapeutic targets for limiting atherosclerosis, an inflammatory disorder orchestrated by cytokines. The potent anti-atherogenic actions of these nuclear receptors involve the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism along with attenuation of the inflammatory response. Similarly, cholesterol-lowering drugs, statins, inhibit inflammation. Unfortunately, the mechanisms underlying such inhibitory actions of these agents in human macrophages are poorly understood and were therefore investigated in relation to IFN-\u03b3, a key pro-atherogenic cytokine, which mediates its cellular effects mainly through STAT1. Simvastatin and PPAR agonists had no effect on the IFN-\u03b3-induced, phosphorylation-mediated activation of STAT1 and its DNA binding but attenuated its ability to activate gene transcription. On the other hand, LXR activators attenuated both DNA binding and trans-activation potential of STAT1 induced by IFN-\u03b3. These studies reveal differences in the mechanism of action of agonists of PPARs (and simvastatin) and LXRs on the IFN-\u03b3-induced, STAT1-mediated gene transcription in human macrophages.", 
    "16": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) increases in a curvilinear fashion after 65 years in men and 75 years in women and the majority of all cardiovascular events occur in individuals older then 65 years. There are notable differences in the clinical assessment of hyperlipidaemia, cardiovascular risk estimation as well as the safety and tolerability profiles in the elderly compared to younger individuals. Clinical trial data have now demonstrated the benefits of statin treatment in the elderly in both the primary and secondary prevention settings. There is however limited data for individuals older than 80 years. Little data is available on other lipid modifying medication in the elderly. With continuing increases in average life expectancy, preventive efforts will become increasingly important for preventing morbidity, improving quality of life, and reducing healthcare expenditures for older persons. This emphasizes the importance of clinical decision-making and weighing up the risks and benefits of treatment.", 
    "17": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease with a global prevalence estimated at 26.55 million in 2006. During the past decades, several agents have been approved that enhance cognition of AD patients. However, the effectiveness of these treatments are limited or controversial and they do not modify disease progression. Recent advances in understanding AD pathogenesis have led to the development of numerous compounds that might modify the disease process. AD is mainly characterized neuropathologically by the presence of two kinds of protein aggregates: extracellular plaques of Abeta-peptide and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles. Abeta and tau could interfere in an original way contributing to a cascade of events leading to neuronal death and transmitter deficits. Investigation for novel therapeutic approaches targeting the presumed underlying pathogenic mechanisms is major focus of research. Antiamyloid agents targeting production, accumulation, clearance, or toxicity associated with Abeta peptide, are some approaches under investigation to limit extracellular plaques of Abeta-peptide accumulation. We can state as an example: Abeta passive and active immunization, secretases modulation, Abeta degradation enhancement, or antiaggregation and antifibrillization agents. Tau-related therapies are also under clinical investigation but few compounds are available. Another alternative approach under development is neuroprotective agents such as antioxidants, anti-inflammatory drugs, compounds acting against glutamate mediated neurotoxicity. Neurorestorative approaches through neurotrophin or cell therapy also represent a minor avenue in AD research. Finally, statins, receptor for advanced glycation end products inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, insulin, and hormonal therapies are some other ways of research for a therapeutic approach of Alzheimer's disease. Taking into account AD complexity, it becomes clear that polypharmacology with drugs targeting different sites could be the future treatment approach and a majority of the recent drugs under evaluation seems to act on multiple targets. This article exposes general classes of disease-modifying therapies under investigation.", 
    "18": "The major public health concern worldwide is coronary heart disease, with dyslipidemia as a major risk factor. Statin drugs are recommended by several guidelines for both primary and secondary prevention. Rosuvastatin has been widely accepted because of its efficacy, potency, and superior safety profile. Inflammation is involved in all phases of atherosclerosis, with the process beginning in early youth and advancing relentlessly for decades throughout life. C-reactive protein (CRP) is a well-studied, nonspecific marker of inflammation which may reflect general health risk. Considerable evidence suggests CRP is an independent predictor of future cardiovascular events, but direct involvement in atherosclerosis remains controversial. Rosuvastatin is a synthetic, hydrophilic statin with unique stereochemistry. A large proportion of patients achieve evidence-based lipid targets while using the drug, and it slows progression and induces regression of atherosclerotic coronary lesions. Rosuvastatin lowers CRP levels significantly. The Justification for Use of statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) trial was designed after the observation that when both low density lipoprotein and CRP were reduced, patients fared better than when only LDL was lowered. Advocates and critics alike acknowledge that the benefits of rosuvastatin in JUPITER were real. After a review, the US Food and Drug Administration extended the indications for rosuvastatin to include asymptomatic JUPITER-eligible individuals with one additional risk factor. The American Heart Association and Centers of Disease Control and Prevention had previously recognized the use of CRP in persons with \"intermediate risk\" as defined by global risk scores. The Canadian Cardiovascular Society guidelines went further and recommended use of statins in persons with low LDL and high CRP levels at intermediate risk. The JUPITER study focused attention on ostensibly healthy individuals with \"normal\" lipid profiles and high CRP values who benefited from statin therapy. The backdrop to JUPITER during this period was an increasing awareness of a rising cardiovascular risk burden and imperfect methods of risk evaluation, so that a significant number of individuals were being denied beneficial therapies. Other concerns have been a high level of residual risk in those who are treated, poor patient adherence, a need to follow guidelines more closely, a dual global epidemic of obesity and diabetes, and a progressively deteriorating level of physical activity in the population. Calls for new and more effective means of reducing risk for coronary heart disease are intensifying. In view of compelling evidence supporting earlier and aggressive therapy in people with high risk burdens, JUPITER simply offers another choice for stratification and earlier risk reduction in primary prevention patients. When indicated, and in individuals unwilling or unable to change their diet and lifestyles sufficiently, the benefits of statins greatly exceed the risks. Two side effects of interest are myotoxicity and an increase in the incidence of diabetes.",

For more than 3 decades, HDL cholesterol has been employed as the principal clinical measure of HDL and cardiovascular risk associated with low HDL-cholesterol concentrations.

To facilitate future characterization of HDL subfractions, we propose the development of a new nomenclature based on physical properties for the subfractions of HDL that includes very large HDL particles (VL-HDL), large HDL particles (L-HDL), medium HDL particles (M-HDL), small HDL particles (S-HDL), and very-small HDL particles (VS-HDL). This nomenclature also includes an entry for the pre-\u03b2-1 HDL subclass that participates in macrophage cholesterol efflux.",

In this scenario, the average cost for 1 year of life gained was SwF352, SwF421, and SwF485 thousand, respectively, and it was always higher in women than in men. In men, the average cost for 1 year of life without CHD was SwF30.7, SwF42.5, and SwF51.9 thousand for the ESC, IAS, and ATP-III strategies, respectively, and decreased with age. Statin drug costs represented between 45% and 68% of the overall preventive cost. Changing the cost of statins, inflation rates, or number of fatal and non-fatal cases of CHD averted showed ESC guidelines to be the most cost effective.",

Inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) by statins has shown potential efficacy against a number of cancers. Here, we show that inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by atorvastatin (AT) blocks both MYC phosphorylation and activation, suppressing tumor initiation and growth in vivo in a transgenic model of MYC-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as well as in human HCC-derived cell lines. To confirm specificity, we show that the antitumor effects of AT are blocked by cotreatment with the HMG-CoA reductase product mevalonate. Moreover, by using a novel molecular imaging sensor, we confirm that inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase blocks MYC phosphorylation in vivo. Importantly, the introduction of phosphorylation mutants of MYC at Ser62 or Thr58 into tumors blocks their sensitivity to inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase. Finally, we show that inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase suppresses MYC phosphorylation through Rac GTPase. Therefore, HMG-CoA reductase is a critical regulator of MYC phosphorylation, activation, and tumorigenic properties. The inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase may be a useful target for the treatment of MYC-associated HCC as well as other tumors.", 
    "32": "Reducing circulating LDL-cholesterol (LDL-c) reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease in people with hypercholesterolemia. Current approaches to reduce circulating LDL-c include statins, which inhibit cholesterol synthesis, and ezetimibe, which blocks cholesterol absorption. Both elevate serum PCSK9 protein levels in patients, which could attenuate their efficacy by reducing the amount of cholesterol cleared from circulation. To determine whether PCSK9 inhibition could enhance LDL-c lowering of both statins and ezetimibe, we utilized small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to knock down Pcsk9, together with ezetimibe, rosuvastatin, and an ezetimibe/rosuvastatin combination in a mouse model with a human-like lipid profile. We found that ezetimibe, rosuvastatin, and ezetimibe/rosuvastatin combined lower serum cholesterol but induce the expression of Pcsk9 as well as the Srebp-2 hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Pcsk9 knockdown in combination with either treatment led to greater reductions in serum non-HDL with a near-uniform reduction of all LDL-c subfractions. In addition to reducing serum cholesterol, the combined rosuvastatin/ezetimibe/Pcsk9 siRNA treatment exhibited a significant reduction in serum APOB protein and triglyceride levels. Taken together, these data provide evidence that PCSK9 inhibitors, in combination with current therapies, have the potential to achieve greater reductions in both serum cholesterol and triglycerides.",

In clinical studies, statin therapy appears to be useful in the prevention of AF in patients with coronary artery disease and possibly congestive heart failure and in the prevention of perioperative AF in cardiac surgery. Its utility in patients with paroxysmal AF may be limited to the prevention of incident AF, but it does not appear to inhibit the progression of paroxysmal AF to chronic AF.

We identified tissue factor (TF) as a crucial mediator of fetal and placental damage in mouse models of recurrent miscarriages and preeclampsia.

Phantom studies were performed using gels with varying concentrations of USPIOs. In the phantom study, 12 gels were prepared with a range of freely distributed concentrations of USPIO nanoparticles (0-0.05\u2009mg/mL). Relative signal intensity measurements were obtained from a T(2)*-weighted sequence as well as quantitative T(2)* (qT(2)*) measurements. In the patient study, 40 patients with >40% carotid stenosis were randomised to low- and high-dose statin therapy (10 and 80\u2009mg of atorvastatin). Pre- and post- (36\u2009h) USPIO-enhanced MRI were performed at baseline, and at 6 and 12 weeks. A linear mixed-effects model was applied to account for the inherent correlation of multiple-plaque measurements from the same patient and to assess dose-response differences to statin therapy. In the phantom study, the T(2)*-weighted sequence demonstrated an initial increase (T(1) effect), followed by a decrease (T(2)* effect), in relative signal intensity with increasing concentrations of USPIO. The qT(2)* values decreased exponentially with increasing concentrations of USPIO. In the patient study, there was a highly significant difference in post-USPIO T(2)* measurements in plaques between the low- and high-dose statin groups. This was observed for both the difference in qT(2)* measurements (post-USPIO minus pre-USPIO) (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and for qT(2)* post-USPIO only (p\u2009<\u20090.001). The post-USPIO qT(2)* values were as follows: baseline: low dose, 13.6\u2009\u00b1\u20095.5\u2009ms; high dose, 12.9\u2009\u00b1\u20096.2\u2009ms; 6 weeks: low dose, 13.3\u2009\u00b1\u20096.7\u2009ms; high dose, 14.3\u2009\u00b1\u20097.7\u2009ms; 12 weeks: low dose, 14.0\u2009\u00b1\u20097.6\u2009ms; high dose, 18.3\u2009\u00b1\u200911.2\u2009ms.

In this open-label, 8-week study, 15 TS 1 children were treated initially with atorvastatin 5 mg/day and 24 TS \u2265 2 children with 10 mg/day. Doses were doubled at week 4 if the LDL-C target (<3.35 mmol/l [130 mg/dl]) was not achieved. The efficacy variables were the percentage change from baseline in LDL-C, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), very low density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), and apolipoprotein (Apo) A-I and Apo B. Safety evaluations included clinical monitoring, subject-reported adverse events (AEs), vital signs, and clinical laboratory tests. The mean values for LDL-C, TC, VLDL-C, and Apo B decreased by week 2 among all TS 1 and TS \u2265 2 patients, whereas TG, HDL-C, and Apo A-I varied considerably from week to week. After 8 weeks, the mean reduction in LDL-C was -40.7% \u00b1 8.4 for the TS 1 children and -39.7% \u00b1 10.3 for the TS \u2265 2 children. For the TS 1 patients, the mean reductions were -34.1% \u00b1 6.9 for TC and -6.0% \u00b1 32.1 for TG. The corresponding changes for the TS \u2265 2 patients were -35.6% \u00b1 9.5 for TC and -21.1% \u00b1 29.7 for TG. Four patients experienced mild to moderate treatment-related AEs. No serious AEs or discontinuations were reported. Overall, no difference in safety or tolerability was observed between the younger and older cohorts. Across the range of exposures after atorvastatin 5 to 10 mg (TS 1) or atorvastatin 10 to 20 mg (TS \u2265 2) doses for 8 weeks, clinically meaningful reductions in LDL-C, TC, VLDL-C, and Apo were observed with atorvastatin in pediatric patients who had HeFH.

Global determination of metabolite concentrations in body fluid and tissues provides novel anatomical aspects of pathological conditions that cannot be obtained from target-specific measurements. Here, we characterised metabolic imbalance in Watanabe heritable hyperlipidaemic rabbits as a model of hypercholesterolaemia. Using a mass spectrometry-based system, we measured a total of 335 metabolites in plasma and tissues (liver, aorta, cardiac muscle, and brain) from WHHL and healthy control rabbits. From the comparison between two metabolomic profiles, pathophysiological features including glutathione and phosphatidylcholine metabolism indicated the occurrence of oxidative stress in several tissues. Especially for the liver, imbalanced purine catabolism shed light on the transcriptional activation of xanthine oxidase, which is thought to act in absorbing or possibly triggering oxidative stress. We also applied this system to assess the therapeutic effects of simvastatin administration. After the treatment, a portion of the metabolomic features in pathological conditions showed alterations suggesting restoration of metabolism to the healthy condition. These changes were considered to be due to the pleiotropic action of statin, including antioxidant effects, rather than its main inhibitory action on cholesterol biosynthesis.",

IR phosphorylated and activated the metabolic sensor and tumor suppressor AMPK, but lovastatin enhanced basal and IR-induced AMPK phosphorylation. The drug inhibited IR-induced expression of p53 and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21(cip1) and p27(kip1), but caused a redistribution of cells from G1-S phase (control and radiated cells) and G2-M phase (radiated cells) of cell cycle into apoptosis.

Our purpose was to compare the effects of maximum doses of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin on the plasma levels of the insulin, glycated albumin, adiponectin, and C-reactive protein compared to baseline in hyperlipidemic patients. We studied 252 hyperlipidemic men and women who had been randomized to receive atorvastatin 80 mg/day or rosuvastatin 40 mg/day during a 6-week period. Atorvastatin and rosuvastatin were both highly effective in lowering the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels, with rosuvastatin more effective than atorvastatin in increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Atorvastatin and rosuvastatin at the maximum dosage both significantly (p <0.05) increased the median insulin levels by 5.2% and 8.7%, respectively, from baseline. However, only atorvastatin increased the glycated albumin levels from baseline (+0.8% for atorvastatin vs -0.7% for rosuvastatin, p = 0.002). Both atorvastatin and rosuvastatin caused significant (p <0.001) and similar median reductions in the C-reactive protein level of -40% and -26% compared to the baseline values. However, no statistically significant difference was found between the 2 groups in the adiponectin changes from baseline (-1.5% vs -4.9%, p = 0.15).

Results from breast cancer treatment trials suggest that aromatase inhibitors may be even more effective in preventing breast cancer than SERMs. However, while SERMs and aromatase inhibitors do prevent the development of many ER-positive breast cancers, these drugs do not prevent ER-negative breast cancer. These results show that new approaches are needed for the prevention of this aggressive form of breast cancer. Our laboratory and clinical efforts have been focused on identifying critical molecular pathways in breast cells that can be targeted for the prevention of ER-negative breast cancer. Our preclinical studies have demonstrated that other nuclear receptors, such as RXR receptors, vitamin D receptors, as well as others are critical for the growth of ER-negative breast cells and for the transformation of these cells into ER-negative cancers. Other studies show that growth factor pathways including those activated by EGFR, Her2, and IGFR, which are activated in many ER-negative breast cancers, can be targeted for the prevention of ER-negative breast cancer in mice. Clinical studies have also shown that PARP inhibitors are effective for the treatment of breast cancers arising in BRCA-1 or -2 mutation carriers, suggesting that targeting PARP may also be useful for the prevention of breast cancers arising in these high-risk individuals. Most recently, we have demonstrated that ER-negative breast cancers can be subdivided into four distinct groups based on the kinases that they express. These groups include ER-negative/Her-2-positive groups (the MAPK and immunomodulatory groups) and ER-negative/Her2-negative groups (the S6K and the cell cycle checkpoint groups). These groups of ER-negative breast cancers can be targeted with kinase inhibitors specific for each subgroup. These preclinical studies have supported the development of several clinical trials testing targeted agents for the prevention of breast cancer. The results of a completed Phase II cancer prevention trial using the RXR ligand bexarotene in women at high risk of breast cancer will be reviewed, and the current status of an ongoing Phase II trial using the EGFR and Her2 kinase inhibitor lapatinib for the treatment of women with DCIS breast cancer will be presented.

Net reclassification improvement using risk categories of 0-<3%, 3-10% and >10% was 25.1%, p=0.01, largely driven by a 32.6% correct up-classification in persons with events. Yet, only 38 (2%) of participants were identified being at high risk using CAC imaging in addition to traditional risk factor assessment.", 
    "108": "Adding CAC to traditional risk assessment in persons without indication for statin therapy improves discrimination. However, reclassification to the high risk category and overall event rates seem too low to justify liberal CAC testing in all these individuals.", 
    "109": "Fluvastatin, a lipophilic statin, was known to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in many cancer cells. Its potential anticancer was evaluated in three hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines (HepG2, SMMC-7721 and MHCC-97H). Cells were treated with fluvastatin in vitro and its effect on cell proliferation, cell cycle, invasion and apoptosis was determined. Mechanism of apoptosis induced by fluvastatin on HCC cell lines was also investigated through western blotting and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) analysis. It was observed that fluvastatin inhibited proliferation of HCC cells by inducing apoptosis and G2/M phase arrest in a dose-dependent manner. The results of cell invasion assay revealed that fluvastatin significantly decreased the invasion potency of HCC cells. A mitochondria-operated mechanism for fluvastatin induced apoptosis might be involved and was supported by Western blotting and MMP analysis. After fluvastatin treatment, expression of Bcl-2 and procaspase-9 were downregulated, cytochrome c (cytosolic extract), Bax and cleaved-caspase-3 protein expression were increased. Furthermore, a breakdown of MMP in HCC cells was observed. To conclude, these results have provided a rationale for clinical investigations of fluvastatin in future as a potential anticancer reagent for growth control of HCC.",

Outcomes included all cause mortality, fatal and non-fatal CHD, CVD and stroke events, combined endpoints (fatal and non-fatal CHD, CVD and stroke events), change in blood total cholesterol concentration, revascularisation, adverse events, quality of life and costs. Relative risk (RR) was calculated for dichotomous data, and for continuous data pooled weighted mean differences (with 95% confidence intervals) were calculated.",

Eleven trials recruited patients with specific conditions (raised lipids, diabetes, hypertension, microalbuminuria). All-cause mortality was reduced by statins (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.95) as was combined fatal and non-fatal CVD endpoints (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.61 to 0.79). Benefits were also seen in the reduction of revascularisation rates (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.83).

The first part inquired demographic and clinical characteristics, duration of hyperlipidemia, referral to a dietician, risk factors and, if present, the reasons for drug discontinuation. The second part consisted of 23 questions (total score 30) inquiring the knowledge levels of patients about hypercholesterolemia.",

The mean knowledge score was 18.2 \u00b1 5. When the threshold score was taken as 18 (median), attainment of the target LDL level was significantly higher in patients having a score of \u2265 18 (32%) compared to those with a lower score (14.9%). There were 77 patients (40%) who sought dietician counseling. Patients with a high school or higher education and those with dietician counseling had higher knowledge scores compared to those with a lower education level and without dietician counseling (p<0.0001). Intermittent drug discontinuation was seen in 109 patients (56.2%), the most common reason being decrease in cholesterol levels to normal (35%).",

    "121": "Type III hyperlipoproteinemia is a rare familial disease characterized by marked elevations of serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels caused by an accumulation of remnant lipoproteins in apolipoprotein E2/E2 homozygotes. It is associated with an increased risk for premature atherosclerotic vascular disease. A 55-year-old woman was diagnosed as having type III hyperlipoproteinemia on the basis of skin lesions, serum lipid levels, lipid electrophoresis, and apolipoprotein E genotyping and stable angina pectoris on the basis of typical symptoms and treadmill exercise electrocardiographic results. After 1 year of combination therapy with atorvastatin and fenofibrate, skin xanthomata disappeared, leaving minimal remnants. In addition, there was no exertional chest pain, and treadmill exercise electrocardiographic results were negative. This finding was confirmed by coronary computed tomographic angiography. This case suggests that proper medical therapy can induce the regression of uncomplicated coronary lesions in type III hyperlipoproteinemia.", 
    "122": "Guidelines for lipid-lowering therapy recommend intensive low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol lowering for patients with coronary artery disease. Previous studies have found that many high-risk patients are not achieving their LDL cholesterol goals, and many patients, despite being treated with lipid-lowering therapy, also have elevated triglycerides or low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. To evaluate lipid goals in a \"real world\" clinical setting, the electronic medical records of 10,040 patients with coronary artery disease from a large cardiology subspecialty practice from September 2008 to September 2009 were reviewed. Overall, 79% of patients achieved an LDL cholesterol goal of <100 mg/dl, while only 35% achieved the more aggressive goal of <70 mg/dl. Non-HDL cholesterol goals of <130 and <100 mg/dl were achieved in 79% and 44% of patients, respectively. Only 69% achieved normal triglyceride levels, and only 63% of men and 56% of women achieved normal levels of HDL cholesterol. Women and younger men were less likely to achieve their lipid goals. In conclusion, most patients with coronary artery disease achieve the minimal LDL cholesterol goal of 100 mg/dl, but few achieve the more aggressive goals of <70 mg/dl. Many high-risk patients have elevated levels of triglycerides or low levels of HDL cholesterol despite treatment. Combination lipid-lowering therapy is used infrequently in practice. There exists a significant opportunity for physicians to more aggressively treat lipids to achieve the levels recommended by clinical guidelines.", 
    "123": "The combination of fibrate and statin therapies may be a treatment option for women with multiple lipid abnormalities. We, therefore, initiated the present safety and efficacy analysis to address the paucity of such data in women with mixed dyslipidemia. A total of 1,393 women with mixed dyslipidemia (low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol \u2265 130 mg/dl, triglycerides [TG] \u2265 150 mg/dl, high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol <50 mg/dl), who had enrolled in any 1 of 3 randomized clinical trials, were evaluated. The eligible women were randomized to receive fenofibric acid plus a low- or moderate-dose statin (combination treatment); or low-, moderate-, or high-dose statin monotherapy; or fenofibric acid monotherapy. With low-dose combination treatment, the baseline HDL cholesterol level increased 20% and TG decreased 46% compared to an 8% HDL cholesterol increase and 20% TG decrease with low-dose statins alone. With the moderate-dose combination, the baseline HDL cholesterol increased 21% and TG decreased 44% compared to an 8% HDL cholesterol increase and 26% TG decrease with moderate-dose statins alone. The reduction in baseline LDL cholesterol with low-dose and moderate-dose combinations (37% and 39%, respectively) was comparable to the reduction with corresponding-dose statins (36% and 43%, respectively). High-dose statins decreased the baseline LDL cholesterol 47%; however, the increase in HDL cholesterol (9%) and decrease in TG (25%) were similar to the changes observed with lower doses of statins. The safety profiles of the combinations were comparable to those of the component therapies. In conclusion, these data suggest that a combination of fenofibric acid and a statin could be considered safe and efficacious for treating women with mixed dyslipidemia.", 
    "124": "Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality globally. The disease is largely controlled with interventions managing atherogenic lipids including LDL and triglycerides. However a number of studies have shown that increasing HDL levels is likely to provide better outcomes for patients suffering from this disease. There has been an extensive research effort into understanding how HDL levels are regulated in the body and which pathways can be targeted therapeutically. The HDL metabolic pathway is however overwhelmingly complex. This has provided only limited success in trialing drugs designed to raise HDL. To add to the complexity HDL itself is a heterogeneous population of particles and there is controversy surrounding which HDL particle is the most cardio-protective. In addition there is varying opinions on which of the HDL cellular receptors are more important in humans (as opposed to what has been discovered in mice) in regulating these effects. In this article we explore the evidence for and against using the currently suggested methods of raising HDL and provide some evidence for how the adverse effects of these drugs could be corrected.", 
    "125": "This review describes the mouse knockout models of cholesterol synthesis, together with human malformations and drugs that target cholesterogenic enzymes. Generally, the sooner a gene acts in cholesterol synthesis, the earlier the phenotype occurs. Humans with loss of function of early cholesterogenic enzymes have not yet been described, and in the mouse, loss of Hmgcr is preimplantation lethal. Together, these results indicate that the widely prescribed cholesterol-lowering statins are potentially teratogenic. The Mvk knockout is early embryonic lethal in the mouse, the absence of Fdft1 is lethal at E9.5-12.5 dpc, while the Cyp51 knockouts die at 15.0 dpc. Fungal CYP51 inhibitor azoles are teratogenic in humans, potentially leading to symptoms of Antley-Bixler syndrome. The X-linked mutations in Nsdhl and Ebp are embryonic lethal in male mice, while heterozygous females are also affected. Consequently, the anticancer drugs, tamoxifen and toremifene, inhibiting human EBP, may be harmful in early pregnancy. The Dhcr7 and Dhcr24 knockout mice die shortly after birth, while humans survive with Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome or desmosterolosis. Since cholesterol is essential for hedgehog signaling, disturbance of this pathway by antipsychotics and -depressants explains some drug side effects. In conclusion, defects in cholesterol synthesis are generally lethal in mice, while humans with impaired later steps of the pathway can survive with severe malformations. Evidence shows that drugs targeting or, by coincidence, inhibiting human cholesterol synthesis are better avoided in early pregnancy. Since some drugs with teratogenic potential still stay on the market, this should be avoided in new cholesterol-related drug development.", 
    "126": "Cardiovascular disease accounts for the majority of deaths in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Dyslipidemia is a well established cardiovascular risk factor. We summarize key aspects of available evidence relating to beneficial effects of statins in nondialysis-dependent CKD, dialysis-dependent CKD and renal transplant recipients.", 
    "127": "Previous trials and their meta-analyses suggested that statins reduce lipid levels, the risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality in nondialysis-dependent CKD. The Study of Heart and Renal Protection (SHARP) study that enrolled both dialysis-dependent and nondialysis-dependent CKD patients showed a 17% decrease in major atherosclerotic events with statins or ezetimibe. Similar cardiovascular benefits are observed in renal transplant recipients. However, such positive effects were not found in two recent clinical trials that enrolled hemodialysis patients alone. This lack of benefit might be attributed to differences in the cause of cardiovascular death seen in dialysis patients and smaller sample size. The overall benefits-harms tradeoff may benefit from meta-analysis and individual patient data meta-analysis in hemodialysis patients including the SHARP data.",

    "130": "Retinal ischemia was induced monocularly by elevating intraocular pressure. Visual function was tested behaviorally with a virtual reality optomotor system, physiologically with optical imaging of intrinsic signals, and histologically by counting the surviving retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in the same animal.", 
    "131": "Visual acuity (-38%) and contrast sensitivity (-78%) were significantly reduced 6 days after ischemia compared with controls. The number of RGCs was reduced by 16%. In contrast, optical imaging revealed essentially unchanged cortical activity maps in spite of the lesion. Treatment of mice with simvastatin applied after the ischemic insult significantly improved both visual function as measured behaviorally (~95% visual acuity, ~165% contrast sensitivity) and RGC survival (~30%) compared with vehicle-treated animals (~42% visual acuity, ~85% contrast sensitivity).", 
    "132": "This specific combination of behavioral measurements of visual function, cortical activity imaging, and histologic analyses is ideally suited to follow ischemia-induced changes and to monitor the effect of therapeutic approaches. Statin therapy may be a promising pharmacologic tool for the treatment of acute retinal ischemia in particular because, in our study, simvastatin was applied after ischemia, a treatment regimen with much greater clinical relevance than preventive administration, as in previous studies.", 
    "133": "Hydroxmethylglutaryl (HMG)-coenzyme A (CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) lower serum cholesterol but exhibit pleiotropic biological effects that are difficult to ascribe solely to cholesterol depletion. Here, we investigated the effect of lovastatin on protein prenylation and cell signaling. We show that high concentrations (50 \u03bcM) of lovastatin inhibit Ras, Rho, and Rap prenylation but that therapeutic levels of lovastatin (50 nM to 500 nM) do not. In contrast, depletion of cellular cholesterol by therapeutic levels of lovastatin increased Ras GTP loading and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and rodent fibroblasts. Elevated Ras signaling was not seen in statin-treated cells if cholesterol levels were maintained by supplementation. Activation of Ras-MAPK signaling was a consequence of, and dependent on, activation of phospholipase D2 (PLD2). Expression of dominant interfering PLD2 or biochemical inhibition of PLD2 abrogated Ras and MAPK activation induced by lovastatin. In contrast, ectopic expression of wild-type PLD2 enhanced Ras and MAPK activation in response to therapeutic levels of lovastatin. Statin-induced cholesterol depletion also modestly activated the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), resulting in downregulation of EGFR expression. These results suggest that statins modulate key cell signaling pathways as a direct consequence of cholesterol depletion and identify the EGFR-PLD2-Ras-MAPK axis as an important statin target.", 
    "134": "The importance of membrane transporters for drug pharmacokinetics has been increasingly recognized during the last decade. Organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) is a genetically polymorphic influx transporter expressed on the sinusoidal membrane of human hepatocytes, and it mediates the hepatic uptake of many endogenous compounds and xenobiotics. Recent studies have demonstrated that OATP1B1 plays a major, clinically important role in the hepatic uptake of many drugs. A common single-nucleotide variation (coding DNA c.521T>C, protein p.V174A, rs4149056) in the SLCO1B1 gene encoding OATP1B1 decreases the transporting activity of OATP1B1, resulting in markedly increased plasma concentrations of, for example, many statins, particularly of active simvastatin acid. The variant thereby enhances the risk of statin-induced myopathy and decreases the therapeutic indexes of statins. However, the effect of the SLCO1B1 c.521T>C variant is different on different statins. The same variant also markedly affects the pharmacokinetics of several other drugs. Furthermore, certain SLCO1B1 variants associated with an enhanced clearance of methotrexate increase the risk of gastrointestinal toxicity by methotrexate in the treatment of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Certain drugs (e.g., cyclosporine) potently inhibit OATP1B1, causing clinically significant drug interactions. Thus, OATP1B1 plays a major role in the hepatic uptake of drugs, and genetic variants and drug interactions affecting OATP1B1 activity are important determinants of individual drug responses. In this article, we review the current knowledge about the expression, function, substrate characteristics, and pharmacogenetics of OATP1B1 as well as its role in drug interactions, in parts comparing with those of other hepatocyte-expressed organic anion transporting polypeptides, OATP1B3 and OATP2B1.",

As compared with baseline, serum levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol:HDL cholesterol ratio and apolipoprotein B were decreased after 1, 3 and 6 months of treatment with atorvastatin and pitavastatin. Serum triglyceride levels were decreased after 1, 3 and 6 months of atorvastatin, but only at 3 months of pitavastatin. Serum HDL cholesterol was increased after 1, 3 and 6 months of pitavastatin, whereas HDL cholesterol was even decreased after 6 months of atorvastatin. Cholesterol levels of most VLDL and LDL subclasses were decreased equally in both groups. However, only pitavastatin increased cholesterol of medium HDL subclass. Serum triglyceride and triglyceride contents in VLDL and LDL subclasses were decreased only by atorvastatin.", 
    "138": "The impact on lipoprotein subclass profiles was different between pitavastatin and atorvastatin.

Both Alzheimer's and dementia have tripled the cost of health care for elderly people, amounting to about $148 billion each year. Although there have been numerous drugs designed so far, no ideal or successful drug treatment for Alzheimer's and dementia has been translated into clinical setups. One of the most widely accepted theories of Alzheimer's pathology is the aggregation of amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) into extracellular cortical and hippocampal plaques. It has also been postulated that excessive cholesterol build-up in the brain plays an integral role in A\u03b2 aggregation, and using HMG-coA reductase inhibitors may reduce A\u03b2 accumulation by lowering brain cholesterol levels. Based on the success of animal studies and phase II clinical trials, HMG-coA reductase inhibitors may provide a viable alternative therapy in AD treatment. This review highlights the results of both pre-clinical and clinical trials on HMG-coA reductase inhibitors in order to give a comprehensive overview of their recent progress in Alzheimer's disease research.",

Colesevelam, a bile acid sequestrant (BAS), which was FDA approved 10 years ago for the reduction of LDL-C in patients with dyslipidemia is also the only BAS that is approved for glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes to date. From both the physician and patient standpoint, safety and tolerability are the most important factors when considering initiating pharmacological therapy. Several randomized controlled studies have examined the safety, tolerability and efficacy of colesevelam over the last decade.",

    "143": "Statins are among the most prescribed drugs in recent clinical practice. They are also known for their pleiotropic actions, which are independent of their lipid-lowering properties. The effect of lovastatin was investigated against carrageenan-induced paw edema in male Wistar rats (200-250 g) and on leukocyte migration, as measured by carrageenan-induced peritonitis in male Swiss mice (20-25 g), which are models of acute inflammation. Lovastatin (administered 1 h prior to carrageenan), at oral doses of 2, 5, and 10 mg/kg, markedly attenuated paw edema formation in rats at the 4th hour after carrageenan injection (25, 43, and 37% inhibition, respectively). Inhibitions of 20, 45 and 80% were observed in the leukocyte migration, as evaluated by carrageenan-induced peritonitis in mice with lovastatin doses of 0.5, 1 and 5 mg/kg, as compared to controls. Furthermore, lovastatin (administered 1 h before initiation) reduced the nociceptive effect of the formalin test in mice, at both phases, at doses of 2, 5, and 10 mg/kg: first phase (51, 65, and 70%, respectively) and second phase (73, 57, and 66% inhibition of licking time, respectively). The anti-nociceptive activity of lovastatin was inhibited by naloxone (3 mg/kg, sc). Lovastatin (0.01, 0.1, and 1 \u00b5g/mL) inhibited by 23, 79, and 86%, respectively, the release of myeloperoxidase from human neutrophils. Leukocyte (predominantly neutrophils) infiltration was almost completely reduced by lovastatin treatment, as observed in the model of acute paw edema with hematoxylin and eosin staining. In addition, lovastatin decreased the number of cells expressing tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activity. Therefore, the alterations in leukocyte activity and cytokine release could contribute to the anti-inflammatory activity of lovastatin.", 
    "144": "Statins reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in appropriately selected patients. However, statin-associated myopathy is a significant risk associated with these agents. Recently, variation in the SLCO1B1 gene was reported to predict simvastatin-associated myopathy. The aim of this study was to replicate association of the rs4149056 variant in SLCO1B1 with severe statin-associated myopathy in a cohort of patients using a variety of statin medications and to investigate the association with specific statin types. We identified 25 cases of severe statin-associated myopathy and 84 controls matched for age, gender, statin type and dose. The rs4149056 variant in SLCO1B1 was not significantly associated with myopathy in this group as a whole. However, when subjects were stratified by statin type, the SLCO1B1 rs4149056 genotype was significantly associated with myopathy in patients who received simvastatin, but not in patients who received atorvastatin. Our findings provide further support for a role for SLCO1B1 genotype in simvastatin-associated myopathy, and suggest that this association may be stronger for simvastatin compared with atorvastatin.",

    "148": "ROCKs are important regulators of the actin cytoskeleton. Because changes in the actin cytoskeleton underlie vascular contractility and remodeling, inflammatory cell recruitment, and cell proliferation, it is likely that the Rho/ROCK pathway will play a central role in mediating vascular function. Indeed, increased ROCK activity is observed in cerebral and coronary vasospasm, hypertension, vascular inflammation, arteriosclerosis, and atherosclerosis. Recent experimental and clinical studies suggest that inhibition of ROCK could be a promising target for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. For example, inhibition of ROCK might be the underlying mechanism by which statins or HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors exert their therapeutic benefits beyond cholesterol reduction. In this review we summarize current understanding of the crucial role of RhoA/ROCK pathway in the regulation of vascular function and discuss its therapeutic potential in the treatment of atherosclerosis and vascular disease.", 
    "149": "The aim was to assess the impact of the short-term anti-inflammatory therapy on coronary endothelial function in non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome patients. In 30 patients, coronary endothelial function was assessed by acetylcholine test. Vessel response was calculated as a percent change of mean lumen diameter (MLD). Then patients were randomized into three groups: A (n = 11) placebo, B (n = 11) 80 mg atorvastatin, C (n = 8) 80 mg atorvastatin and 25 mg rofecoxib. After 7 days control test was performed. Recovery of coronary endothelial function was calculated as delta in percent changes of MLD between Days 1 and 7. On Day 1, percent change of MLD between baseline and maximum acetylcholine did not differentiate the groups: -20 \u00b1 3.5% in A, -25 \u00b1 3.9% in B and -26 \u00b1 3.7% in C, P = .20. On Day 7, percentage changes in MLD were as follows: -21 \u00b1 3.9% in A, -15 \u00b1 3.0% in B and -10 \u00b1 4.0% in C, P=.002. The delta in percentage change in MLD between Days 1 and 7 were as follows: -1% in A, + 10% in B and +16% in C, P = .02. In conclusion, short-term, anti-inflammatory therapy with high-dose atorvastatin and selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor improves coronary endothelial function within 7 days in non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndrome patients.",

Plasma analysis by enzymatic method or ELISA showed that high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) and apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) contents were remarkably increased by treatment with simvastatin. And plasma lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity was markedly increased by simvastatin treatment. Real-time PCR detection disclosed that the expression of several transporters involved in reverse cholesterol transport, including macrophage scavenger receptor class B type I, hepatic ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters ABCG5, and ABCB4 were induced by simvastatin treatment, the expression of hepatic ABCA1 and apoA-I, which play roles in the maturation of HDL-C, were also elevated in simvastatin treated groups.", 
    "152": "We demonstrated the anti-atherogenesis effects of simvastatin in apoE-/- mice fed a high-fat diet. We confirmed here for the first time simvastatin increased the expression of hepatic ABCB4 and ABCG5, which involved in secretion of cholesterol and bile acids into the bile, besides upregulated ABCA1 and apoA-I. The elevated HDL-C level, increased LCAT activity and the stimulation of several transporters involved in RCT may all contribute to the anti-atherosclerotic effect of simvastatin.",

Diabetes mellitus was induced in rats using streptozotocin (55 mg/kg, i.v. once), while hypercholesterolemia was produced by feeding high cholesterol diet. After 4 weeks of streptozotocin and Cholesterol rich diet administration, vascular endothelium dysfunction was assessed, in terms of attenuation of acetylcholine-induced, endothelium-dependent relaxation (Isolated Aortic Ring Preparation), a decrease in serum nitrate/nitrite level, as well as mRNA expression of eNOS (rtPCR) and disruption of integrity of vascular endothelium (Electron microscopy). After 14 days of daily administration, sodium orthovanadate (8 mg/kg, p.o., 16 mg/kg, p.o and 24 mg/kg, p.o) and atorvastatin (30 mg/kg, p.o) (positive control) significantly improved acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation, serum nitrate/nitrite level, mRNA expression of eNOS and maintained integrity of vascular endothelium. However, this ameliorative effect of SOV was significantly blocked by UCN-01, (PDK inhibitor) and L-NAME (Inhibitor of eNOS). Therefore, it may be concluded that sodium orthovanadate, a specific inhibitor of PTPase, may stimulate PDK and eNOS and consequently improve vascular endothelium dysfunction. Thus, inhibition of PTPase might be a useful approach in the therapeutics of vascular endothelium dysfunction.", 
    "163": "The isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway provides the cell with a variety of compounds which are involved in multiple cellular processes. Inhibition of this pathway with statins and bisphosphonates is widely applied in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and metabolic bone disease, respectively. In addition, since isoprenylation of proteins is an important therapeutic target in cancer research there is interest in interfering with isoprenoid biosynthesis, for which new inhibitors to block farnesylation and geranylgeranylation of small GTPases are being developed. We recently developed a sensitive method using UPLC-MS/MS that allows the direct detection and quantification of all intermediates of the mevalonate pathway from MVA to GGPP which can be used to verify the specificity of inhibitors of the isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway. We here investigated the specificity of several inhibitors of the isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway in HepG2 cells, fibroblasts and lymphoblasts. The nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates pamidronate and zoledronate specifically inhibit farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase indicated by the accumulation of IPP/DMAPP. However, zaragozic acid A, a squalene synthase inhibitor, causes an increase of MVA in addition to the expected increase of FPP. Analysis of isoprenoid intermediate profiles after incubation with 6-fluoromevalonate showed a very nonspecific result with an increase in MVA, MVAP, MVAPP and IPP/DMAPP. These results show that inhibitors of a particular enzyme of the isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway can have additional effects on other enzymes of the pathway either direct or indirect through accumulation of isoprenoid intermediates. Our method can be used to test new inhibitors and their effect on overall isoprenoid biosynthesis.",

This new model of cerebral ischemia allows the assessment of the very early phase of the ischemic process, with the functional preservation of the vascular and neuronal compartments and the blood-brain barrier (bbb). The middle cerebral artery was transiently tied for 30\u00a0min followed by reperfusion for 60\u00a0min. Statins (nanomolar doses) were administered by intravascular continuous infusion starting 60\u00a0min before ischemia induction. Brain cortical activity and arterial vascular tone were continuously recorded. At the end of the experiment immunoreactivity for microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2), expression of survival kinases (ERK and Akt) and total anti-oxidant capacity were assayed. Brains treated with simvastatin lactone showed i) reduced amplitude and delayed onset of ischemic depressions, ii) preservation of MAP-2 immunoreactivity, iii) activation of ERK signaling in the ischemic hemisphere and iv) increase in whole-brain anti-oxidant capacity. Treatment with the bbb-impermeable simvastatin acid was ineffective on the above-mentioned parameters. Vascular resistance recordings and Akt signaling were unchanged by any statin treatment. Our findings suggest that intravascular-delivered simvastatin exerts an acute lipophilicity-dependent protective effect in the early phase of cerebral ischemia.",

They also describe the potential pathways believed to link psoriasis with atherosclerosis and the role of hyperlipidemia therapy in this setting. A few studies indicated clinical improvement in psoriasis with treatment of associated hyperlipidemia. Some studies showed that a low-fat diet improved psoriasis. Others indicated a decreased risk of psoriasis associated with intake of cholesterol-lowering drugs such as \"statins.\" Treatment with statins increased lactate dehydrogenase level and diminished Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score, ie, reduced cutaneous lesion in psoriasis. Beneficial effects of statin therapy on psoriasis included downregulation of lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1, inhibition of leukocyte endothelial adhesion, extravasation and natural killer cell activity, inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin 1 and 6, lowering of C-reactive protein, promotion of a T(H)1 to T(H)2 cells and inhibition of T(H)1 cytokine receptors on T cells, leading to inhibition of activation of lymphocytes and infiltration into the inflammation sites.

    "187": "Statins are known to inhibit signaling of Ras superfamily GTPases and reduce T cell adhesion to ICAM-1. Here, we address the hypothesis that statins affect T cell adhesion and migration by modulating the function of specific GTPases. Statins inhibit the synthesis of mevalonic acid, which is required for farnesyl and geranylgeranyl isoprenoid synthesis. Ras superfamily GTPases are post-translationally isoprenylated to facilitate their anchorage to membranes, where they function to stimulate signal transduction processes. We demonstrate that 1 \u03bcM statin inhibits the adhesion, migration, and chemotaxis of the T-ALL cell line CCRF-CEM and TEM of CCRF-CEM and PEER T-ALL cells, but higher statin concentrations are needed to inhibit adhesion of primary T cells. Similar effects are observed following treatment with GGTI-298 or RNA interference-mediated knockdown of Rap1b but not Rap1a, Rac1, Rac2, RhoA, or Cdc42. Statins also alter Rap1 activity and Rap1b localization. Rap1 levels are higher in primary T cells than T-ALL cells, which could explain their reduced sensitivity to statins. These results demonstrate for the first time that the closely related Rap1a and Rap1b isoforms have different functions and suggest that statins or Rap1b depletion could be used to reduce tissue invasion in T-ALL.",

Treatment with pitavastatin at doses of 20 and 40 ppm decreased the total number of polyps dose-dependently to 85.2% and 65.8% (P < 0.05) of the untreated value, respectively. Serum levels of total cholesterol and triglyceride were slightly reduced and those of IL-6, leptin, and MCP-1 were decreased by 40-ppm pitavastatin treatment. mRNA expression levels of cyclooxygenase-2, IL-6, inducible nitric oxide (iNOS), MCP-1, and Pai-1 were significantly reduced in intestinal nonpolyp parts by pitavastatin treatment. Among them, iNOS mRNA levels were also reduced in the intestinal polyps. Moreover, oxidative stress represented by 8-nitroguanosine in the small intestinal epithelial cells was reduced by pitavastatin treatment. Related to these proinflammatory genes, PPAR\u03b3 activity was activated in the intestinal nonpolyp parts and in the liver of Min mice with pitavastatin treatment. These results indicated that pitavastatin has potential benefit for the suppression of intestinal polyp development.",

The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was determined by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study formula and the patients classified into the five traditional stages of kidney disease. The 1-year survival in relation to prescription of statin at discharge was assessed in a Cox regression analysis adjusted by a propensity score that described each individual's likelihood of being treated with a statin, established by 36 baseline characteristics and in-hospital therapies. Statin use at discharge decreased with increased renal impairment from 81% in eGFR stage 1 to 31% in eGFR stage 5. After adjusting for the propensity score and discharge medication, statin use was associated with a significant reduction in overall risk of death (hazard ratio 0.63), with a statistically significant interaction between statin therapy and the stage of renal function. Thus, statin use at discharge was associated with improved 1-year survival of patients in stages 2-4 (mild-to-severe) of renal insufficiency. This effect appears attenuated in those with stage 5 renal failure.",

We describe \"time-window bias\" in the context of a case-control study, reporting that statin use was associated with a 45% reduction in the incidence of lung cancer. This bias results from the use of time-windows of different lengths between cases and controls to define time-dependent exposures. We illustrate the bias using a population of 365,467 patients from the United Kingdom's General Practice Research Database, including 1786 incident cases of lung cancer during 1998-2004. The case-control approach used in the published study yielded a rate ratio of lung cancer incidence of 0.62 with statin use (95% confidence interval = 0.55-0.71). A case-control approach that properly accounts for time produces a rate ratio of 0.99 (0.85-1.16)-suggesting no benefit of statins on lung cancer risk. We show analytically that the magnitude of the bias is proportional to the ratio of the unequal time-window lengths.", 
    "196": "Since the publication of the 4S trial in 1994, there has emerged a consensus that statins save lives and decrease myocardial infarctions and strokes in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients irrespective of baseline serum cholesterol. However, there is controversy over the correct dose and the utility of the treatment-to-goal (cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein) approach. To answer remaining questions about the optimal statin dose in CAD patients, we have performed simple and meta-analyses of 3 large long-term (approx. 5 years) dose-clinical response studies (TNT, IDEAL, and SEARCH) and compared the results with older data including long-term safety data. The results show that raising the dose of simvastatin or atorvastatin to 80 mg confers no mortality advantage, an increase in adverse reactions and only a slight decrease in myocardial infarctions and stroke versus a lower dose. These results suggest a cost-effective approach of a single safe dose (40 mg of inexpensive generic simvastatin or atorvastatin) for almost all CAD patients and makes treatment-to-goal and cholesterol monitoring (except to check for medication compliance) unnecessary; moreover, it is likely to improve the weakness in statin use - medication compliance.",

The GRTIs for those without and with CHD backcalculate to LDLc thresholds of 5.65 mmol/L (95% CI, 5.50-5.82 mmol/L) and 4.39 mmol/L (95% CI, 4.21-4.59 mmol/L), respectively. Scotland and North England showed dissimilar GRTIs, which backcalculated to LDLc thresholds of 5.06 mmol/L (95% CI, 4.83-5.28 mmol/L) and 5.44 mmol/L (95% CI, 5.19-5.69 mmol/L), respectively, for all women.", 
    "201": "The findings illustrate how genotype frequencies can be a proxy for treatment thresholds used in clinical practice. Genome-wide studies have identified>500 disease-relevant polymorphisms. GRTIs from cost-efficient genotyping, in combination with phenotypic data, may have wide potential in health services research.", 
    "202": "Exposure of the human malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor cell lines STS-26T, ST88-14, and NF90-8 to nanomolar concentrations of both lovastatin and farnesyl transferase inhibitor (FTI)-1 but not to either drug alone induced cell death. ST88-14 and NF90-8 cells underwent apoptosis, yet dying STS-26T cells did not. FTI-1 cotreatment induced a strong and sustained autophagic response as indicated by analyses of microtubule-associated protein-1 light chain 3 (LC3)-II accumulation in STS-26T cultures. Extensive colocalization of LC3-positive punctate spots was observed with both lysosome-associated membrane protein (LAMP)-1 and LAMP-2 (markers of late endosomes/lysosomes) in solvent or FTI-1 or lovastatin-treated STS-26T cultures but very little colocalization in lovastatin/FTI-1-cotreated cultures. The absence of colocalization in the cotreatment protocol correlated with loss of LAMP-2 expression. Autophagic flux studies indicated that lovastatin/FTI-1 cotreatment inhibited the completion of the autophagic program. In contrast, rapamycin induced an autophagic response that was associated with cytostasis but maintenance of viability. These studies indicate that cotreatment of STS-26T cells with lovastatin and FTI-1 induces an abortive autophagic program and nonapoptotic cell death."
