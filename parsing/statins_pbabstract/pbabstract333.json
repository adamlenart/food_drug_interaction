To our knowledge there has been no comparative study of these two HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on endothelial dysfunction measured by flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery in patients with hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "1": "Fourteen middle-aged males with hypercholesterolemia (means +/- SD: total cholesterol 7.03 +/- 0.88 mmol/l, LDL cholesterol 5.02 +/- 0.63 mmol/l, HDL cholesterol 1.3 +/- 0.38 mmol/l and triglycerides 1.47 +/- 0.26 mmol/l) were randomised, after a 6 weeks' run-in phase with AHA step I diet treatment, to 12 weeks' treatment either with simvastatin or pravastatin. Both statins were given in a daily dose of 10 mg for 6 weeks, which was increased to 20 mg daily in patients who did not achieve an LDL-cholesterol goal of < 3.4 mmol/l. Endothelial dysfunction was measured as flow-mediated brachial artery dilation (FMD) using high resolution ultrasound.", 
    "2": "There were no significant differences between the drugs in reduction of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, or elevation of HDL cholesterol. FMD increased in the simvastatin group from 6.8 +/- 3.2 to 12.3 +/- 2.9% (p < 0.03) and in the pravastatin group from 6.3 +/- 4.8 to 13.3 +/- 4.7% (p = 0.001). The improvement in FMD was the same in both groups (p = 0.64) and did not correlate with changes of the lipid parameters measured.", 
    "3": "Both simvastatin and pravastatin reduce endothelial dysfunction to the same degree in patients with hypercholesterolemia, independently of changes in lipid parameters.", 
    "4": "Endothelial dysfunction is now recognised as an important process in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Nitric oxide (NO) release by the endothelium regulates blood flow, inflammation and platelet aggregation, and consequently its disruption during endothelial dysfunction can decrease plaque stability and encourage the formation of atherosclerotic lesions and thrombi. Inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (statins) are often utilised in the prevention of coronary heart disease due to their efficacy at lowering lipid levels. However, statins may also prevent atherosclerotic disease by non-lipid or pleiotropic effects, for example, improving endothelial function by promoting the production of NO. There are various mechanisms whereby statins may alter NO release, such as inhibiting the production of mevalonate and important isoprenoid intermediates, thereby preventing the isoprenylation of the small GTPase Rho, which negatively regulates the expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Furthermore, statins may also increase eNOS activity via post-translational activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase Akt (PI3 K/Akt) pathway and/or through an interaction with the molecular chaperone heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90). Data suggest that statins may vary in their efficacy for enhancing the release of NO, and the mechanisms dictating these differences are not yet clear. By increasing NO production, statins may interfere with atherosclerotic lesion development, stabilise plaque, inhibit platelet aggregation, improve blood flow and protect against ischaemia. Therefore, the ability of statins to improve endothelial function through the release of NO may partially account for their beneficial effects at reducing the incidence of cardiovascular events.", 
    "5": "There are a number of theoretical reasons as to why 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) should be prescribed to patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). These agents are proven to prevent coronary heart disease, the major etiological factor in the development of CHF. Potential additional effects of these agents include inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine activity and other potential beneficial effects on cardiac remodeling. However, there are also possible adverse effects of this strategy, supported by the overriding observation that low plasma lipid levels portend a poorer prognosis in patients with established CHF. Potential mechanisms by which statins may directly confer adverse effects include a reduction in levels of the antioxidant ubiquinone and an increase in blood endotoxin levels, both of which may contribute to CHF disease progression. Given these uncertainties, an answer to the question of whether or not therapy for CHF should include statins requires a definitive clinical trial. The importance of such a trial is further highlighted by the already commonplace usage of statins amongst patients with CHF.", 
    "6": "This study compared the relative efficacy of a once-daily niacin extended-release (ER)/lovastatin fixed-dose combination with standard doses of atorvastatin or simvastatin, with a special emphasis on relative starting doses. Subjects (n = 315) with elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol blood levels (defined as LDL cholesterol blood levels > or =160 mg/dl without coronary artery disease, or > or =130 mg/dl if coronary artery disease was present, and HDL cholesterol <45 mg/dl in men and <50 mg/dl in women) were randomized to atorvastatin, simvastatin, or niacin ER/lovastatin for 16 weeks. The primary efficacy variables were the mean percent change in LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol levels from baseline. After 8 weeks, the starting dose niacin ER/lovastatin 1,000/40 mg and the 10-mg starting dose atorvastatin both lowered mean LDL cholesterol by 38%. After 12 weeks, niacin ER/lovastatin 1,000/40 mg lowered LDL cholesterol by 42% versus 34% with the 20-mg starting dose of simvastatin (p <0.001). Niacin ER/lovastatin increased HDL cholesterol significantly more than atorvastatin or simvastatin at all compared doses (p <0.001). Niacin ER/lovastatin also provided significant improvements in triglycerides, lipoprotein(a), apolipoprotein A-1, apolipoprotein B, and HDL subfractions. A total of 6% of study subjects receiving niacin ER/lovastatin withdrew because of flushing. No significant differences were seen among study groups in discontinuance due to elevated liver enzymes. No drug-induced myopathy was observed. Niacin ER/lovastatin was comparable to atorvastatin 10 mg and more effective than simvastatin 20 mg in reducing LDL cholesterol, was more effective in increasing HDL cholesterol than either atorvastatin or simvastatin, and provided greater global improvements in non-HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, and lipoprotein(a).", 
    "7": "Statins reduce coronary and cerebrovascular mortality and morbidity in middle-aged individuals. Until recently, their efficacy and safety in elderly people had not yet been firmly established. PROSPER was a controlled, randomised study involving 2,804 men and 3,000 women aged 70-82, with a history of, or risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Their baseline cholesterol level was 135-350 mg/dl; they were randomised to either 40 mg pravastatin per day, or matching placebo. Average follow-up was 3.2 years. The primary endpoint was a composite of coronary death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and fatal or non-fatal stroke. Pravastatin lowered LDL-cholesterol (-34%), and reduced the incidence of the primary endpoint (-15%; CI 95%: 3-26%; p = 0.014). Coronary death and non-fatal myocardial infarction risk was also reduced (-19%; p = 0.006), and mortality from coronary disease fell by 24% (p = 0.043). The risk for stroke, however, was unaffected (p = 0.8), whereas the incidence of transient ischemic attacks was reduced by 25%, which was (marginally) insignificant (p = 0.051). Pravastatin had no effect on cognitive functions or incapacity. New cancers were more frequent amongst pravastatin-treated individuals (+25%; p = 0.020). However incorporation of this new data in a meta-analysis of all pravastatin and all statin trials revealed no overall increase of cancer risk.",

    "9": "Baseline characteristics among subjects who received their first ever-recorded LLD prescription in general practice between 1 January 1990 and 31 December 1997, and hyperlipidaemic patients without LLD therapy during the same period were obtained from the UK General Practice Research Database. Differences between patients who received and patients who did not receive LLDs, as well as patients who received different classes of LLDs were compared by fitting multivariate logistic regression models that adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, smoking status, and year of treatment initiation or hyperlipidaemia diagnosis.", 
    "10": "We found that there were many differences in the baseline characteristics, such as number of general practitioner visits, diagnosis and severity of cardiovascular diseases, and concurrent medications, between the 25 331 patients who received and the 16 287 patients who did not receive LLDs. We also noted that patients with statin therapy had more prior hospitalization, more recent myocardial infarction/stroke, and more concurrent cardiovascular medications, than those patients who received other LLDs.", 
    "11": "Patients who received LLDs in primary care, especially patients with statin therapy, were more likely to be elderly and to have more concomitant severe cardiovascular comorbidities than those hyperlipidaemic patients who did not receive LLDs. Examining the medical records of individuals eligible for LLD therapy is an important first step in selectively targeting who will experience the greatest benefit to risk ratio for the treatment of hyperlipidaemia, and is an important step in avoiding confounding by indication when designing epidemiological studies comparing the risks and benefits of treatments for hyperlipidaemia.", 
    "12": "Response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to study the effect of the composition of the rice-glycerol complex medium on the production of lovastatin (Lvs) by the ascomycete Monascus ruber in mixed solid-liquid (or submerged) cultures at 25 degrees C. Four components (rice powder, peptone, glycerol, glucose) were studied to evaluate the approximate polynomial for all dependent variables, explaining their effects on the production of Lvs. The best composition derived from RSM regression was (in g/L) rice powder 34.4, peptone 10.8,, glucose 129, KNO3 8.0, MgSO4.7H2O 4.0 and glycerol 36.4 mL/L. With this composition, the Lvs production was 157 mg/L after 10 d of cultivation. In comparison with glycerol and glucose, the rice powder becomes a more suitable carbon source and represents a great potential for the production of Lvs.", 
    "13": "Statins, known as inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, exhibit numerous functions related to inflammation, such as MHC class II down-regulation, interference with T cell adhesion, and induction of apoptosis. Here we demonstrate that both subcutaneous and oral administration of atorvastatin inhibit the development of actively induced chronic experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in SJL/J mice and significantly reduce the inflammatory infiltration into the central nervous system (CNS). When treatment was started after disease onset, atorvastatin reduced the incidence of relapses and protected from the development of further disability. Both the reduced autoreactive T cell response measured by proliferation toward the encephalitogenic peptide PLP139-151 and the cytokine profile indicate a potent blockade of T helper cell type 1 immune response. In in vitro assays atorvastatin not only inhibited antigen-specific responses, but also decreased T cell proliferation mediated by direct TCR engagement independently of MHC class II and LFA-1. Inhibition of proliferation was not due to apoptosis induction, but linked to a negative regulation on cell cycle progression. However, early T cell activation was unaffected, as reflected by unaltered calcium fluxes. Thus, our results provide evidence for a beneficial role of statins in the treatment of autoimmune attack on the CNS.", 
    "14": "Recent epidemiological studies revealed inhibitors of the hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, so-called statins, to be effective in lowering the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In vitro, statins strongly reduced the cellular amyloid beta-protein load by modulating the processing of the amyloid beta precursor protein. Both observations are probably linked to cellular cholesterol homeostasis in brain. So far, little is known about brain effects of statins. Recently, we could demonstrate that treatment of mice with the lipophilic compound lovastatin resulted in a discrete reduction of brain membrane cholesterol levels. To follow up these findings, we subsequently carried out a further in vivo study including lovastatin and simvastatin as lipophilic agents, as well as pravastatin as a hydrophilic compound, focussing on their efficiency to affect subcellular membrane cholesterol pools in synaptosomal plasma membranes of mice. In contrast to the hydrophilic pravastatin, the lipophilic lovastatin and simvastatin strongly reduced the levels of free cholesterol in SPM. Interestingly, lovastatin and pravastatin but not simvastatin significantly reduced cholesterol levels in the exofacial membrane leaflet. These changes were accompanied by modified membrane bulk fluidity. All three statins reduced the expression of the raft marker protein flotillin. Alterations in transbilayer cholesterol distribution have been suggested as the underlying mechanism that forces amyloidogenic processing of APP in AD. Thus, our data give some first insight in the mode of action of statins to reduce the prevalence of AD in clinical trials.", 
    "15": "The latest report from the National Cholesterol Education Program has reaffirmed that the primary lipid goal for the prevention of atherosclerotic vascular disease (AVD) is to achieve a normal low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (<130 mg/dL) by diet in normal individuals, and by diet and statin therapy in patients with multiple risk factors. Patients with any clinical AVD (which includes diabetes) will need a statin to achieve an optimal LDL cholesterol (<100 mg/dL). The recent Heart Protection Study might revise our thinking further. Patients at high risk achieved a reduction in mortality and vascular events taking simvastatin 40 mg, even if they had a low baseline LDL value. Individuals with the metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance do not typically have a very high LDL, but rather have elevated triglycerides and a low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. They, too, need to be treated with a statin, first to achieve an appropriate LDL goal. This is insufficient if the triglyceride value exceeds 200 mg/dL. They should be treated to achieve a non-HDL cholesterol goal (equal to total cholesterol minus HDL cholesterol) that is 30 mg/dL higher than the LDL goal.", 
    "16": "Typical randomized clinical dose-finding studies consist of the comparison of several doses of a drug versus a placebo. Interest lies in estimating relevant doses among those under investigation for efficacy and safety variables, such as the minimum effective dose or the maximum safe dose (or estimating both doses simultaneously). Step-down procedures have been proposed for comparing the standardized differences of the dose groups against placebo. In this paper we consider the ratio of population means and propose stepwise confidence intervals for these ratios. These confidence intervals do not require multiplicity adjustments and yield the same decisions as the associated test procedures. In addition, several power concepts are investigated within the present framework. The results allow sample size determination in the design phase of a study for the probability of estimating correctly the dose of interest. Auxiliary results of a numerical study show the range of application of these methods.", 
    "17": "Neuroinflammatory diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS), result from aberrant leukocyte traffic into the central nervous system (CNS). To breach the specialized blood-brain barrier, activated leukocytes interact with CNS endothelial cells (EC) and activate a CD54-mediated signaling pathway controlling the Rho GTPase. To function correctly Rho requires posttranslational prenylation, and this can be inhibited by depleting the supply of isoprenoids through inhibition of the cholesterol synthesis pathway with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMG-CoA reductase) inhibitors (statins). Here we show that treatment of brain EC in vitro with lovastatin inhibits Rho-mediated transendothelial T cell migration. This effect can be reversed by supplementation with mevalonolactone, the downstream product of HMG-CoA reductase, or by ectopic expression of myristoylated Rho, which remains active in the absence of prenylation. In a relapsing-remitting mouse model of MS, lovastatin treatment inhibited leukocyte migration into the CNS and significantly attenuated the development of both acute and relapsing clinical disease. These studies demonstrate that the indirect pharmacological inhibition of Rho proteins in brain EC by statins can inhibit a key stage in the pathogenesis of neuroinflammation, namely leukocyte migration across the blood-brain barrier. These studies demonstrate a novel effect of statins in modulating the immune response in neuroinflammtory diseases and may provide additional rationale for their use in the treatment of MS.", 
    "18": "Most studies examining the potential cardioprotective effects of postmenopausal estrogen have been undertaken in healthy women, with doses that may not be appropriate for long-term intervention. New low-dose estrogen-progestin regimens alleviate postmenopausal symptoms with a favorable side-effect profile; however, little is known of the impact of such regimens in women at increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Hence, we have evaluated the effects of low-dose oral estrogen-progestin therapy on serum lipoprotein lipids, brachial artery reactivity and fibrinogen in hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal women in direct comparison with the effects of pravastatin, a lipid-lowering agent known to reduce cardiovascular events in women.", 
    "19": "In a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel trial, we studied the effects of continuous combined estrogen-progestin therapy (1 mg 17beta-estradiol with 500 micro g norethisterone acetate daily) or pravastatin (20 mg daily) in 72 postmenopausal women with fasting serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels greater than 124 mg/dl after an 8-week run-in diet, over a 24-week period. The primary end-point was percentage change in LDL cholesterol from baseline.", 
    "20": "The intention-to-treat population comprised 65 women, mean age 59 +/- 6.3 years, and 29 in each group completed the trial. Diet alone reduced LDL cholesterol significantly in both treatment groups, in association with a reduction in weight during this period. Compared with respective baseline values, pravastatin decreased LDL cholesterol and total cholesterol to a greater extent than hormone therapy (p = 0.0001 and 0.003 for difference between treatments, respectively). High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels decreased with hormone therapy, but did not change with pravastatin (p = 0.01). Lipoprotein(a) decreased significantly with hormone therapy only (-14%, 95% confidence interval (CI) -21 to -6%, p = 0.01 for difference between groups). Brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) was impaired at baseline, and this increased with hormone therapy (absolute mean change in artery diameter as percentage units 2.07, 95% CI 0.57-3.57, p = 0.009) versus no change with pravastatin (0.19, 95% CI -1.1 to 1.5, p = 0.78), with a near-significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.058). A significant correlation between improved brachial artery FMD and reduction in LDL cholesterol was not observed. Fibrinogen decreased significantly in both treatment groups with no difference between treatments.", 
    "21": "In postmenopausal hypercholesterolemic women, pravastatin and hormone therapy exhibited divergent effects. The former lowered total and LDL cholesterol more effectively, whereas hormone therapy lowered lipoprotein(a) significantly and improved brachial artery endothelium-dependent dilatation, independent of the reduction in LDL cholesterol. The modest increase in brachial artery FMD seen is consistent with hypercholesterolemia compromising endothelial integrity, and suggests that the important effect of estrogen on the endothelial microenvironment may be attenuated in women with endothelial dysfunction.", 
    "22": "Neuritic plaques composed of amyloid beta-protein (A beta) are an early and invariant neuropathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The current preclinical search for drugs is mainly focused on decreasing A beta production by inhibiting beta- or gamma-secretase, blocking the formation of these plaques by preventing A beta protofibril and fibril formation, and alleviating the toxic effects of neuritic plaque deposition. Increasing numbers of drugs currently used as therapies for other diseases are now entering clinical trials for AD, but the molecular targets of these drugs and their relevance to A beta toxicity needs to be thoroughly addressed. This knowledge will allow us to fully understand the A beta-related pathways in AD pathogenesis and explore novel therapeutic interventions.", 
    "23": "3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) reduce the risk of coronary event by cholesterollowering dependent and independent mechanisms. We have already described that the inhibitory effect of cerivastatin on angiogenesis contribute to the cholesterol-independent beneficial effect and was due to the inhibition of the cell signaling cascade RhoA/FAK/Akt. In this study, new insights in the molecular mechanism of action were provided. It indicates an inhibition of exposure of alpha V beta 3 integrin on cell membrane and a modification of gene expression. The inhibition of angiogenesis could be related to 1) an increase in genes involved in the inhibition of cell proliferation (p19(INK4), p21(Waf/Cip1),Wnt-5a), the inhibition of cell migration (Rho-GDI 1, alpha E-catenin) and 2) a downregulation of genes involved in angiogenesis (PAI-1, Vitronectin, HoxD3, Notch4) or in cell invasion (Semaphorin E). In addition, DNA repair protein genes (MLH1, XRCC1) were increased. This study may indicate new biological interest of genes involved in angiogenesis control.", 
    "24": "Proliferation, a key determinator of vascular proliferative diseases, is dependent on cyclin/cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) complexes, which are controlled by cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) such as p27(Kip1) and p21(Cip1). Both have prognostic significance in various human malignancies. We have determined the levels of p27(Kip1) and p21(Cip1) in human directional coronary atherectomy specimens of primary lesions (n = 15) and lesions of in-stent restenosis (n = 18) in comparison to those of other vascular regions and have correlated CKI levels with clinical data. Quantitative immunoblotting demonstrated low expression of p27(Kip1) in primary lesions (5.9 +/- 0.5 ng/mg protein) compared with that in aorta (14.9 +/- 0.9 ng/mg), internal mammary artery (16.7 +/- 1.1 ng/mg), and carotid artery thrombendarterectomy specimens (16.5 +/- 1.7 ng/mg). Similarly, p27(Kip1) levels in lesions of in-stent restenosis were found to be significantly reduced (6.3 +/- 1.1 ng/mg; mean time of restenosis development 367 +/- 61 days). p27(Kip1) levels did, however, not have prognostic significance for the development of restenosis, and expression levels of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and CDK2 were similar in all groups examined, indicating low proliferative activity. Clinically, p27(Kip1) was not of value in predicting the development of restenosis. Furthermore, p27(Kip1) tissue levels were not increased in statin-treated patients, implying that the favorable effect of these drugs is not a result of p27(Kip1) stabilization. However, the relative content of p21(Cip1) was found to be significantly up-regulated in restenosis compared with that in primary lesions (225%) and the other vascular regions. Our data imply that negative-feedback mechanisms are still intact in coronary proliferative disease, thereby contrasting the finding of deregulated proliferation in malignancies.", 
    "25": "Elevated plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels constitute a major risk factor for coronary heart disease. The plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration is dictated partly by the efficiency of intestinal cholesterol absorption. The efficacy of treatments designed to block cholesterol absorption is partially offset to the extent that the liver compensates for the interruption to the enterohepatic movement of cholesterol by increasing the rate at which it synthesizes cholesterol. Currently, the most widely-used treatment for hypercholesterolemia is based on a class of agents (statins) that partially inhibit cholesterol synthesis within the body. Recent clinical trials with a unique, potent, and selective cholesterol absorption inhibitor (ezetimibe) used in combination with lower doses of various statins showed an additive reduction in plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels which equaled the reduction achieved with maximal doses of statins given alone. Combination therapy using a statin and this novel cholesterol absorption inhibitor represents an efficacious new approach to the treatment of hypercholesterolemia in the general population.", 
    "26": "Statins have a variety of cardioprotective properties following chronic treatment. In contrast, little is known about the acute effects. Reperfusion acutely injures the heart by activation of neutrophils as well as endothelial cells. Because statins are known to influence the processes pathogenetically involved, we hypothesized that acute application of statins attenuates the sequelae of cardiac reperfusion. In rats, myocardial infarction (MI) was induced by ligature of the left coronary artery followed by reperfusion. Myocardial blood flow (MBF) was determined by H2 clearance and regional myocardial function (fractional thickening, FT) by pulsed Doppler. MI size was measured by triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining, neutrophil extravasation by determination of myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity, and nitric oxide generation via measurement of cGMP. Treatment with fluvastatin, administered intravenously 20 min before the onset of ischemia, significantly attenuated the decline of FT and MBF at the end of the reperfusion period and significantly reduced MI size. Furthermore, fluvastatin induced a significant reduction of MPO activity and an increase of cGMP level compared with the control group. The effect of fluvastatin was completely abolished following pretreatment of NG-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester (l-NAME). These findings suggest that acute application of fluvastatin reduces MI size and attenuates reperfusion injury. We propose that the underlying mechanism is at least partially an inhibition of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction by preventing the activation and extravasation of neutrophils.", 
    "27": "Combined treatment of statins and calcium channel blockers has been suggested to be superior to statin therapy alone. We quantified the anti-atherosclerotic potential of amlodipine, atorvastatin and their combination on existing atherosclerotic plaques in the aorta of APOE*3-Leiden transgenic mice. Sixty-two mice were fed a high cholesterol containing diet for 18 weeks. A subgroup of 10 mice was then killed. All other mice received the diet for another 18 weeks, alone (late control group), along with 0.01% atorvastatin, 0.002% w/w amlodipine, or their combination (all groups, n = 13). Atherosclerotic lesions, collagen content and monocyte adherence were quantified using standard histology (aortic root). Raman spectroscopy was used to quantify the content of cholesterol and calcification (aortic arch). Compared to the late control group, treatment with amlodipine, atorvastatin or the combination, reduced atherosclerostic lesion area by, respectively, 25%, 39% and 46% in the aortic root (P < 0.01) and by 53%, 55% and 60% in the aortic arch (P < 0.05). Atorvastatin, but not amlodipine reduced the adherence of monocytes in the intima. Lesion severity and plaque contents of collagen, cholesterol and calcification were equal for all treatment groups. Neither treatment resulted in regression of atherosclerotic plaque size. In conclusion, both atorvastatin and amlodipine significantly retard the progression of existing atherosclerotic lesions. No additive effect of the combination of amlodipine and atorvastatin could be observed in this study.", 
    "28": "Emerging data suggest that the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) offer important benefits for the large population of individuals at high risk for coronary heart disease. This population encompasses a sizable portion of individuals who are also at high risk for drug-drug interactions due to their need for multiple medications. In general, statins are associated with a very small risk for myopathy (which may progress to fatal or nonfatal rhabdomyolysis); however, the potential for drug-drug interactions is known to increase this risk in specific high-risk groups. The incidence of myopathy associated with statin therapy is dose related and is increased when statins are used in combination with agents that share common metabolic pathways. Of particular concern is the potential for interactions with other lipid-lowering agents such as fibrates and niacin (nicotinic acid), which may be used in patients with mixed lipidemia, and with immunosuppressive agents, such as cyclosporine, which are commonly used in patients after transplantation. Clinicians should be alert to the potential for drug-drug interactions to minimize the risk of myopathy during long-term statin therapy in patients at high risk for coronary heart disease.",

    "30": "We recently reported that lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) acts on vascular smooth muscle cells ( VSMCs ) to produce a mitogenic response through the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (ERK1/2). In this study, we examined the role of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on lysoPC-induced VSMC proliferation. Pitavastatin, a new HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, suppressed lysoPC-induced DNA synthesis in primary cultured rat VSMCs. Since lysoPC-induced ERK1/2 activation contributes to smooth muscle cell proliferation, we explored the effect of pitavastatin on ERK1/2 activation. Pitavastatin inhibited lysoPC-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation and ERK1/2 activation. The other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, atrovastatin and fluvastatin, also inhibited lysoPC-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Pitavastatin also inhibited lysoPC-induced c-fos mRNA expression. To gain insight into the mechanism of the inhibitory effect of pitavastatin on ERK1/2 activation by lysoPC, we examined the role of the mevalonate pathways. Mevalonate and farnesylpyrophosphate reduced the inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation by pitavastatin. These studies demonstrate that pitavastatin may inhibit lysoPC-induced VSMC proliferation, at least in part, by inactivating ERK1/2, which is linked to mevalonate metabolism.", 
    "31": "We conducted a prospective study to investigate the relationship between the decrease of serum lipid levels during pravastatin therapy and changes of coronary angiography parameters in Japanese patients with coronary atherosclerosis. The patients were predominantly male, aged between 18 and 75 years (mean: 58 years), had at least 25% stenosis of one or more major coronary arteries, and had a serum total cholesterol ( TC) level > or = 200 mg/dl (5.18 mM/l). Treatment with pravastatin (10 mg/day) was continued for 3 years. Coronary angiography was performed before and 3 years after the start of pravastatin therapy to assess the relationship between the mean segment diameter (MSD), the minimal lumen diameter (MLD), and the annual changes of percent stenosis and TC levels. of 265 patients who were initially registered, 129 were followed for an average of 35 months. Consequently, second angiograms were only obtained in 68 patients for various reasons, so this group was used for analysis. During pravastatin therapy, the TC level significantly decreased from 239 mg/dl (6.19 mM/l) to 210 mg/dl (5.44 mM/l) (a 12% reduction; p<0.001). In addition, HDL-cholesterol increased by 5% (p=0.007), but the triglyceride level did not show a significant change. Both MSD and MLD were significantly improved on follow-up angiography, increasing from 2.67 mm to 2.76 mm and from 2.09 mm to 2.13 mm, respectively. However, no change of percent stenosis was observed. The mean TC level during treatment did not show any significant correlation with the changes of angiography parameters. However, a significant correlation was observed between the percent reduction of TC and the annual change of MSD (r=-0.272, p=0.027). A similar relationship was also found between the change of MLD and the percent reduction of TC (r=-0.260, p=0.035). In conclusion, the percent decrease of serum cholesterol may be a better indicator of clinical efficacy than the absolute cholesterol level during pravastatin therapy.", 
    "32": "The aim of this study was to observe the efficacy of atorvastatin and the related factors of meeting the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP)-recommended low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia. A total of 107 patients were treated with atorvastatin 10 mg/day for 12 weeks. Eighty % of the patients achieved the target goals. There was a significant difference in the initial body mass index (BMI) between patients achieving the target goals and those not achieving the target goals (p < 0.05). In multiple stepwise logistic regression analysis, initial BMI and complications correlated with reaching the NCEP-recommended target goals (p < 0.05). A great number of patients treated with atorvastatin, including those previously poorly controlled with other therapies, reached the target goals at the starting dose 10 mg/day. BMI may be a useful index of achieving the NCEP-recommended target goals with atorvastatin.", 
    "33": "Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase is the primary target in the current clinical treatment of hypercholesterolemias with specific inhibitors of the \"statin\" family. Statins are excellent inhibitors of the class I (human) enzyme but relatively poor inhibitors of the class II enzymes of important bacterial pathogens. To investigate the molecular basis for this difference we determined the x-ray structure of the class II Pseudomonas mevalonii HMG-CoA reductase in complex with the statin drug lovastatin. The structure shows lovastatin bound in the active site and its interactions with residues critically involved in catalysis and substrate binding. Binding of lovastatin also displaces the flap domain of the enzyme, which contains the catalytic residue His-381. Comparison with the structures of statins bound to the human enzyme revealed a similar mode of binding but marked differences in specific interactions that account for the observed differences in affinity. We suggest that these differences might be exploited to develop selective class II inhibitors for use as antibacterial agents against pathogenic microorganisms.",

    "40": "The effects of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor atorvastatin on electrophoretic characteristics of LDL particles were evaluated in 46 patients (28 males and 18 females) with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) aged 20-61 carrying either a negative or a defective LDL receptor gene mutation. Following a 6 week drug-free baseline period, FH heterozygotes were treated with atorvastatin (median dose: 20 mg/day, range 10-80 mg/day)) for 6 months to maintain their plasma LDL-cholesterol concentrations between 4.0 and 5.0 mmol/l. Atorvastatin treatment significantly reduced plasma total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride levels and increased plasma HDL-cholesterol. Furthermore, atorvastatin treatment significantly increased LDL peak particle diameter (LDL-PPD) by 0.5% (from 255.0+/-6.2 to 256.4+/-5.5 A, P=0.004) and reduced the absolute concentration of cholesterol among small (<255 A) and large (>260 A) LDL particles by 35% (P<0.001). Changes in LDL-PPD and plasma triglyceride levels were inversely correlated (R=-0.34; P=0.02). Stepwise multiple linear regression analyses showed that 41.6% of the variation in the LDL-PPD response to atorvastatin was attributable to the initial LDL-PPD (14.4%, P=0.003), the apo E polymorphism (12.4%, P=0.02), the nature of the LDL receptor gene mutation (9.6%, P=0.01) and change in triglyceride levels (5.2%, P=0.04). Moreover, the reduction in the cholesterol content of LDL <255 A was directly correlated with the daily dosage of atorvastatin (P=0.05). Results of the present study showed that atorvastatin alters significantly LDL heterogeneity in patients at high risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) such as FH heterozygotes. These results also suggest that genetic and metabolic factors may be important determinants of atorvastatin-induced changes of LDL particle size and distribution among FH heterozygotes.", 
    "41": "A ubiquitously expressed member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily, CYP51, encodes lanosterol 14alpha-demethylase, the first step in the conversion of lanosterol into cholesterol in mammals. The biosynthetic intermediates of lanosterol 14alpha-demethylation are oxysterols, which inhibit HMG-CoA reductase and sterol synthesis in mammalian cells in vitro. These oxysterols (5alpha-lanost-8-en-3beta,32-diol and 3beta-hydroxy-5alpha-lanost-8-en-32-al) are efficiently converted into cholesterol in vitro and are generally considered to be natural cholesterol precursors. When added to hepatocytes in high concentrations, besides their conversion into cholesterol, they are also rapidly metabolized into more polar sterols and into steryl esters. The 15alpha- and 15beta-hydroxy epimers of 5alpha-lanost-8-en-3beta-ol are also rapidly metabolized into more polar sterols and steryl esters but are not converted efficiently into cholesterol. Polar sterol formation from all these oxysterols is dependent on an active form of cytochrome P450. Oxysterols are potent regulators of the activities of transcription factors of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein family and of liver X-receptor alpha. It is proposed that the rapid, cytochrome P450-dependent metabolism of naturally occurring regulatory oxysterols provides a route for their deactivation so that they become incapable of affecting gene transcription. Inhibition of cytochrome P450 by the drug ketoconazole prevents the inactivation of such oxysterols, leading to a prolonged suppression of hepatic HMG-CoA reductase in vivo and in vitro.", 
    "42": "This review summarizes the pharmacokinetic properties of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (or statins) reported in animals. Lovastatin and simvastatin are administered as lactone prodrugs in contrast to other statins, which are generally formulated in the pharmacological active hydroxy acid form. Pharmacokinetics vary with the statin and animal species considered. Oral absorption is rapid and the bioavailability low due to an extensive first-pass metabolism. Pitavastatin is the exception, with high bioavailability in all species except monkeys (80% vs. 18%). Plasma protein binding is high for all statins (> 95%) except pravastatin (60%). Regardless of the dosing schedule (single or multiple), animal species and statin, the highest tissue levels are found in the liver--the target organ. Elimination is rapid with metabolism being the main elimination route for all statins, except for pitavastatin, which is only slightly metabolized, and pravastatin, which aside from metabolism is also eliminated by renal excretion. Statins undergo enterohepatic circulation and are recovered mainly in feces via bile, the extent of which is species-dependent. Metabolism varies with the statin and animal species, particularly the beta-oxidation of the dihydroxy heptanoic side chain that occurs primarily in rodents.",

Anti-inflammatory effects of statins are considered to be exerted in part through inhibition of leukocyte-endothelial interactions. We investigated the in vivo effects of simvastatin treatment in hypercholesterolemic patients and the influence of various statins on expression of cellular adhesion molecules in vitro.", 
    "44": "A total number of 107 hypercholesterolemic patients were treated with 20 mg (n=52) or 40 mg (n=55) of simvastatin daily. After 6 weeks of treatment, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) expressed lower amounts of CD54-, CD18-, and CD11a-mRNA compared with pretreatment values. Surface expression of CD54 and CD18/CD11a on CD14+-monocytes also decreased significantly in both groups of patients. Moreover, simvastatin, atorvastatin, and cerivastatin were found to downregulate tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha-induced expression of CD54 and CD18/CD11a in isolated PBMCs obtained from normal donors as well as TNF-alpha-dependent expression of these CAMs in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Furthermore, all three statins were found to reduce the binding of PBMCs to TNF-alpha-stimulated HUVECs in vitro.",

    "46": "The vascular endothelium is a dynamic endocrine organ that regulates contractile, secretory, and mitogenic activities in the vessel wall and hemostatic processes within the vascular lumen. Risk factors for cardiovascular disease, such as cigarette smoking, hypertension, and elevated serum lipid levels, impair endothelial function and lead to the development of atherosclerotic vessels. Recent studies suggest that statins reduce cardiovascular events in part by improving endothelial function. Statins reduce plasma cholesterol levels, thereby decreasing the uptake of modified lipoproteins by vascular wall cells. There is increasing evidence, however, that statins may also exert effects beyond cholesterol lowering. Indeed, many of these cholesterol-independent or \"pleiotropic\" vascular effects of statins appear to involve restoring or improving endothelial function through increasing the bioavailability of nitric oxide, promoting re-endothelialization, reducing oxidative stress, and inhibiting inflammatory responses. Thus, the endothelium-dependent effects of statins are thought to contribute to many of the beneficial effects of statin therapy in cardiovascular disease.", 
    "47": "3-hydroxyl-3-methyl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) can function to protect the vasculature in a manner that is independent of their lipid-lowering activity.

We investigated the effect of statins on the expression of TM and TF by endothelial cells.", 
    "48": "The incubation of endothelial cells with pitavastatin led to a concentration- and time-dependent increase in cellular TM antigen and mRNA levels. In contrast, the expression of TF mRNA was not induced under the same conditions. A nuclear run-on study revealed that pitavastatin accelerates TM transcription rate. The stimulation of TM expression by pitavastatin was prevented by either mevalonate or geranylgeranylpyrophosphate. Specific inhibition of geranylgeranyltransferase-I and Rac/Cdc42 by GGTI-286 and Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin, respectively, enhanced TM expression, whereas inactivation of Rho by Clostridium botulinum C3 exoenzyme was ineffective.",

    "50": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) are widely used antilipidemic agents that are also immunomodulatory. We evaluated possible effects of these agents after lung transplantation by comparing outcomes of 39 allograft recipients, who were prescribed statins for hyperlipidemia, with those of 161 contemporaneous control recipients who did not receive these drugs. Acute rejection (>or= Grade II) was less frequently found in the statin group (15.1 versus 25.6% of biopsies, p < 0.01). None of 15 recipients started on statins during postoperative Year 1 developed obliterative bronchiolitis, whereas the cumulative incidence of this complication among control subjects was 37% (p < 0.01). Total cellularity, as well as proportions of inflammatory neutrophils and lymphocytes, were significantly lower in bronchoalveolar lavages of statin recipients. Among double lung recipients, those taking statins had significantly better spirometry: FVC (80 +/- 2 versus 70 +/- 1%) and FEV1 (87 +/- 2 versus 70 +/- 1%), as percentages of predicted values, and absolute FEV1/FVC (83.4 +/- 1.2 versus 78.6 +/- 0.5) (all p < 0.01). The 6-year survival of recipients taking statins (91%) was much greater than that of control subjects (54%) (p < 0.01). These data suggest statin use may have substantial clinical benefits after pulmonary transplantation.", 
    "51": "According to the Third Report of the Expert Panel on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults (Adult Treatment Panel III), patients with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol > or = 130 mg/dL should be discharged on lipid-lowering therapy. When LDL cholesterol levels are between 100 and 129 mg/dL, evaluation of ratios of LDL cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol or total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol may provide additional insight into a patient's risk status. Patients who were using statin therapy before admission for an acute coronary syndrome should be continued on lipid-lowering therapy. The American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) 2002 guideline update for management of patients with unstable angina and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction recommends statin therapy at discharge as a class I indication, level of evidence A. Furthermore, studies confirm that statin therapy begun early during hospitalization can prevent ischemic events in patients who are treated by an invasive strategy and those who are treated only by a medical strategy. However, studies suggest that patient compliance with a statin regimen after discharge is far from optimal. There are 2 programs available to help ensure that appropriate patients receive and continue taking lipid-lowering therapy. These programs are the Cardiac Hospitalization Atherosclerosis Management Program (CHAMP) and the Guidelines Applied in Practice (GAP).", 
    "52": "Stroke is a major cause of mortality and morbidity. The epidemiologic association between elevated serum cholesterol and stroke risk is controversial. However, recent secondary prevention studies with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) have demonstrated a significant reduction in ischemic stroke without an increase in hemorrhagic stroke. Statins probably reduce stroke by a variety of mechanisms, including modulation of precerebral atherothrombosis in the aorta and the carotid artery, thus preventing plaque disruption and artery-to-artery thromboembolism. Statins also improve endothelial homeostasis by increasing the bioavailability of nitric oxide, which orchestrates the paracrine antiatherosclerotic functions of the endothelium. Studies in experimental models of ischemic stroke show that statin therapy reduces brain infarct size and improves neurologic outcome by directly upregulating brain endothelial nitric oxide synthase. Putative anti-inflammatory actions of statins may also contribute to neuroprotection and stroke prevention. Although the clinical benefit of statins largely depends on lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, accumulating data indicate that many of the pleiotropic effects of statins are attributable to the cellular consequences of depletion of intermediates in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway (isoprenoids). These molecules play fundamental roles in cell growth, signal transduction, and mitogenesis. In addition to reducing stroke risk, emerging data suggest that statins may reduce dementia. Further studies are needed to fully address the role of statins in the prevention of stroke in patients without established vascular disease and the role of cholesterol modulation in the treatment of dementia.", 
    "53": "The cardiovascular metabolic syndrome is a family of risk factors that predispose patients to develop diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Indeed, macrovascular, not microvascular, disease is the leading cause of death in these patients. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) exert both direct and indirect (cholesterol-lowering) effects on the vasculature. Clinical trials have shown that these agents reduce cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease in persons with diabetes. However, their beneficial effects on diabetic dyslipidemia do not account for all of the observed risk reduction. Positive effects on nitric oxide metabolism, inflammation, coagulability, and adhesion of cells to the vascular endothelium likely contribute to the mechanism of action of these agents. These pleiotropic effects of statins on the vasculature will be discussed in this review.", 
    "54": "Inflammation plays a crucial role in the cell biology of atherosclerosis. Coronary risk factors, and particularly low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, injure the endothelium and decrease the bioavailability of nitric oxide to promote the expression of proinflammatory genes, cellular adhesion molecules, cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. For example, the expression of CD40/CD40 ligand increases cell-mediated immune responses to activate a number of inflammatory cells and destabilize atherosclerosis. As part of this response, soluble markers of inflammation that are released into the blood offer insights into the cell biology of inflammation in atherosclerosis. In groups of patients, these markers have provided a means to study inflammatory mechanisms and have supported the value of many of our interventions that prevent cardiovascular disease. Statins have potent effects to reduce LDL cholesterol in the plasma and the artery wall and also appear to have a number of nonlipid effects that decrease inflammatory stimuli. Because statins also reduce some soluble markers of inflammation, it is likely that at least part of their benefit reflects a reduction in vascular inflammation in stable and unstable coronary syndromes. Although these inflammatory markers are valuable tools for studying the mechanisms of atherosclerosis, their use in clinical practice to stratify cardiovascular risk or assess treatment in individual patients requires further evaluation.", 
    "55": "The traditional view of cardiovascular disease held that the degree of stenosis defined high-risk lesions and that removal of cholesterol shrank these lesions and thereby enlarged the lumen. Advances in understanding of the pathophysiology of the acute coronary syndromes refute this view. We now appreciate that vascular biology determines plaque stability and that statins stabilize plaque by favorably altering this biology. They do so chiefly (but probably not exclusively) by cholesterol lowering. In addition to reducing the cholesterol content of plaque, lipid lowering inhibits inflammation, and decreases collagenolytic activity and thrombotic potential. The role of lipid-independent effects remains unclear because many studies used statin concentrations too high to have any clinical relevance. However, data suggest that statin-induced alterations in the function of small G proteins may contribute to the anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic actions of statins in clinical practice.", 
    "56": "The 'statin story' began in 1987 when the first-generation, fungal HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin received FDA approval in the USA. Ten years later, the sixth compound of this class came onto the world market--the fully synthetic statin cerivastatin. A number of clinical studies had confirmed its high pharmacological efficacy, its excellent pharmacokinetic properties with fast and nearly complete absorption after oral uptake, a linear kinetic over a broad concentration range, and its favorable safety profile. The greatest advantages, of cerivastatin, however, are its lipophilicity, its high bioavailability of about 60% after oral application and its potency at 100-fold lower doses compared to other lipophilic statins. Nevertheless, the most exciting findings are certainly its non-lipid-related, pleiotropic effects at the cellular and molecular level. Statin therapy was also found to reduce mortality in cases where cholesterol levels or atherosclerotic plaque formation remained unaltered. However, cerivastatin improves endothelial dysfunction, possesses anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticoagulant, antithrombotic, antiproliferative, plaque-stabilizing, immunmodulatory, and angiogenic effects, and may even prevent tumor growth, Alzheimer's disease, and osteoporosis. Most of these effects seem to be based on the inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis. Although cerivastatin is no longer on the market because of some problematic side effects, it could be one of the most potent cellular and molecular drugs for the future.", 
    "57": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of simvastatin on guided bone regeneration in the mandibles of ovariectomized rats, and to observe their blood cholesterol levels. Seventy female rats were divided into two groups: control and treated, both groups containing normal and ovariectomized rats. A month after ovariectomy a bone defect was created in the mandible, and was covered by a polytetrafluoroethylene membrane. The treated groups received simvastatin orally for 15 or 30 days. The rats were sacrificed 15, 30 or 60 days after surgery, at which time a blood sample was extracted for blood cholesterol level analysis and the mandible was extracted for densitometric, histological and morphometric analysis. All specimens underwent analysis of variance. The ovariectomized animals had higher cholesterol levels than the treated normal animals, and no significant difference was found between the different treatment periods and the sacrifice times. The densitometric, histological and morphometric analysis showed that the treated ovariectomized animals developed more new bone than the control ovariectomized rats, but no significant difference was observed between the treatment periods. It can be concluded that the deficiency of estrogen increased the level of blood cholesterol and that the simvastatin aided new bone formation in the ovariectomized animals.", 
    "58": "The results of several large therapeutic cardiovascular trials were reported in 2002. The LIFE study concluded that losartan is superior compared to atenolol in terms of prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, the benefit being for CVA without changing the incidence of myocardial infarction. The OPTIMAAL study stated the disappointing results of post-infarct losartan. The IONA study represents a first demonstration with nicorandil of benefit not only in angina crises but equally on cardiac morbidity and mortality. The HPS study confirms the benefit of a statin in secondary prevention but for the first time, no matter what the initial level of LDL-cholesterol. Finally in the LIPS study, it is reported that statins reduce major cardiovascular events after coronary angioplasty. The year 2002 was marked elsewhere by imagination after the publication of the RAVEL study on coated stents delivering anti-proliferative drugs in order to avoid coronary restenosis. Three drugs were the subject of work confirming their potential significance in cardiovascular pathology: a) ezetimibe, representing a new class of cholesterol lowering drugs with which the association with statins seems especially synergic, b) nesiritide recombinant type B natriuretic peptide, whose significance was confirmed in acute cardiac insufficiency. c) levosimendan (calcium sensitisor) which moreover can be a significant treatment in cardiac decompensation as suggested by the LIDO study with a follow up of 180 days. By contrast, omapatrilate did not confirm its potential superiority over ACE inhibitors in the treatment of cardiac insufficiency. Some encouraging data were reported in 2002 in the field of therapeutic angiogenesis as much at the myocardial level as in lower limb arteritis. Finally, 2002 was marked by the publication of the WHI study which intensified suspicions regarding hormonal substitution treatment, confirming the advantage of not only secondary but perhaps primary cardiovascular prevention.",

The effects of atorvastatin (40 mg/day) and micronised fenofibrate (200 mg/day) on the kinetics of apoAI and apoB were investigated in a controlled cross-over trial of 11 dyslipidemic men with the metabolic syndrome. ApoAI and apoB kinetics were studied following intravenous d(3)-leucine administration using gas-chromatography mass spectrometry with data analyzed by compartmental modeling. Compared with placebo, atorvastatin significantly decreased (P < 0.001) plasma concentrations of cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL cholesterol, VLDL apoB, intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) apoB, and LDL apoB.

Both agents significantly lowered plasma triglycerides and apoCIII concentrations, but only atorvastatin significantly lowered (P < 0.001) plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity. Neither treatment altered insulin resistance. In conclusion, these differential effects of atorvastatin and fenofibrate on apoAI and apoB kinetics support the use of combination therapy for optimally regulating dyslipoproteinemia in the metabolic syndrome.",

Using actual prescribing data for statins for a 12-month period, a statistically significant correlation was found between net ingredient cost per patient and STAR-PUs per patient (Spearman's rank coefficient 0.36; P < 0.01). However, the correlation between average daily quantities per patient and PASS-PUs per patient was not statistically significant.

Current statin prescribing across GP practices in this study correlates with national prescribing cost patterns (as measured by STAR-PUs) although not with expected prevalence of treated CHD (as measured by PASS-PUs). PASS-PUs reflect prevalence of treated CHD and may therefore be used to monitor and predict GP prescribing arising from the implementation of the National Service Framework targets for CHD. In addition, PASS-PUs maybe derived for a wide range of therapeutic areas.",

It provides important new information on the use of statins in women, the elderly, diabetics and people with low baseline cholesterol pretreatment and those with prior occlusive non-coronary vascular disease. In this report, the paper is discussed with the significance of the results outlined in view of existing evidence from previously published trials. In addition, ongoing trials and future directions are explored.", 
    "91": "The effect of five statins, i.e. atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin was investigated on the proliferation of the human breast cancer cell line MCF-7. All statins except of pravastatin were able to inhibit cell proliferation up to 90 % at a concentration of 50 micro M. Between the effective statins no significant difference was observed indicating a class-specific effect. These data suggest that statins may have clinical significance in the primary prevention of human breast cancer beyond their cholesterol-lowering effect. However, clinical proof must be awaited before drawing any further conclusions.", 
    "92": "In addition to their lipid-lowering properties, statins improve endothelial function by increasing the activity of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). It was hypothesized that, by this mechanism, statins protect the myocardium from ischemia/reperfusion injury in normocholesterolemic animals. Rats were pretreated for 1 week with either cerivastatin (0.3 mg/kg/d) or placebo. Anesthetized animals underwent 30 minutes of coronary artery occlusion (CAO) followed by 180 minutes of reperfusion. In a separate set of experiments, the NOS inhibitor l-NAME (15 mg/kg; N -nitro-l-arginine methyl ester) was administered 15 minutes before CAO. Cerivastatin decreased infarct size by 49% (P < 0.05) without reducing plasma cholesterol levels. Cerivastatin increased myocardial eNOS mRNA and NOS activity and by 52% and 58% (P < 0.05), respectively. Cardioprotection and upregulation of eNOS activity evoked by cerivastatin were not observed in rats cotreated with l-NAME. These results show that statins reduce the extent of myocardial necrosis in normocholesterolemic rats after acute ischemia/reperfusion injury by increasing myocardial eNOS activity. Therefore, statins may protect the heart not only by reducing the incidence of ischemic events, but also by limiting cell damage during acute myocardial infarction.", 
    "93": "Statins exert pleiotropic effects on several other cellular functions besides lipid-lowering. Previously, it was found that cerivastatin is a very potent inhibitor of human arterial smooth muscle cell (haSMC) growth. However, because increased extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis also accounts mainly for intimal plaque formation, the effects of cerivastatin on ECM expression was examined in this study. Furthermore, the influence of varying glucose and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels on cerivastatin-treated haSMCs was analyzed to mimic the conditions in patients with diabetes or hypercholesterolemia. The haSMCs were treated with 0.001-5.0 microM cerivastatin in the presence of 5.5-18.9 m glucose and 10-1000 microg/ml LDL. After 3 days, the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of eight ECM proteins was analyzed and, after 7 days, mitotic and mitochondrial activities and thrombospondin (TSP)-1 protein expression were analyzed. TSP-1 and TSP-2 mRNA expression was inhibited highly significantly at cerivastatin doses >or=0.01 microM with maximums of 72% and 35%, respectively, at high glucose levels. The mRNA signals of the third glycoprotein fibronectin were not influenced. Furthermore, collagen-1 mRNA was inhibited highly significantly up to 71% and biglycan mRNA was similarly inhibited up to 45%. The mRNA expression of the matrix-stimulating transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 was not altered significantly, whereas mRNA expression of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-2 was stimulated clearly up to 150%. Mevalonate, but not LDL replacement, reversed the effects. Immunofluorescence staining showed an unaltered TSP-1 pattern with cerivastatin doses up to 0.1 microM whereas higher doses impaired TSP-1 excretion. The effects of cerivastatin on haSMC growth and mRNA expression of the eight ECM components were not diminished by the increase in LDL and glucose levels. Since accelerated SMC growth and ECM formation contribute mainly to intimal thickening, cerivastatin may be protective against the development of atherosclerotic and restenotic lesions by its direct cellular effects. Increased LDL and glucose levels, as in diabetes, do not mitigate the beneficial effects of cerivastatin on cell growth and ECM formation in vitro.",

    "99": "Several pieces of evidence support a role of inflammatory processes in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis; it is also known that endothelial dysfunction is the initial lesion of the atherosclerotic process. Among other markers of endothelial dysfunction, some adhesion molecules seem to play an interesting role. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of atorvastatin vs placebo on some indexes of leukocytes adhesion in a group of Type 2 diabetic patients. Twenty-five Type 2 diabetic patients free from microangiopathic complications and with LDL-cholesterol lower than 180 mg/dl were randomized to receive either atorvastatin (T2DA) or placebo (T2Dp) for twelve months. BMI, fasting plasma glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), albumin excretion rate (AER), lipid profile, and serum concentrations of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM1), E-selectin and cadherin-5 were measured at baseline and at the end of the follow-up. At T0 E-selectin was 16 +/- 6 ng/ml in T2DA and 17 +/- 13 in T2Dp; VCAM1 was 413 +/- 112 ng/ml in T2DA and 411 +/- 112 in T2Dp. At T12 VCAM1 and E-selectin did not vary in T2Dp, while a significant reduction was observed in T2DA (VCAM1 275 +/- 104 ng/ml and E-selectin 8 +/- 3 ng/ml; p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively). T2DA also showed a reduction of total and LDL cholesterol and an improved glycemic control respect to T2Dp. Hypolipidemic therapy was the strongest independent predictor of the cytokines variations along the time. These results confirm the role of statins in modulating endothelial function also in Type 2 diabetes, outlining a therapeutic role of these molecules probably independent from the hypolipidemic effect.",

Our aim was to evaluate their effect on fibrinogen and lipid plasma levels compared with a well-known HMGCoA reductase inhibitor. Seventy Wistar male adult rats on a fat-enriched diet were treated orally with P. notoginseng pulverized root (43 mg/kg/day or 86 mg/kg/day; 20 animals per group), fluvastatin (3 mg/kg/day; 20 animals) or physiological saline (5 mL/kg/day; 10 animals). The ten rats on a normocaloric diet were also treated with 5 mL/kg/day of physiological saline. After a 28-day treatment, the rats were killed and their blood analysed with standard procedures. Treatment with 43 mg/kg/day of P. notoginseng or 3 mg/kg/day of fluvastatin showed similar activity in decreasing total cholesterol (-23.70%, -19.29%, respectively) and triglycerides (-21.59%, -18.55%). The most evident effect of P. notoginseng was the reduction of fibrinogenaemia in treated rats compared with the control values (-38.10%; p < 0.001), no dose-relationship being shown in this effect. Moreover, no significant variation in HDL cholesterol and glucose levels was observed nor did relevant behavioural changes occur in association with the root intake. Besides a moderate, non dose-related decrease in the plasma lipid levels, P. notoginseng appeared to induce a significant reduction in the rat fibrinogenaemia.",

We have recently demonstrated increased expression of the gap junction protein connexin43 (Cx43) in specific subsets of cells in atherosclerotic lesions. Because the development of atherosclerosis depends critically on paracrine cell-to-cell interactions, we hypothesized that direct intercellular communication via gap junctions may be another factor controlling atherogenesis.", 
    "102": "The role of Cx43 in atherogenesis was examined by use of both a genetic and a pharmacological approach. First, atherosclerosis-susceptible LDL receptor-deficient (LDLR-/-) mice with normal (Cx43+/+) or reduced (Cx43+/-) levels of Cx43 were fed a cholesterol-rich diet for 14 weeks. The progression of atherosclerosis was reduced by 50% (P<0.01) in the thoracoabdominal aorta and in the aortic roots of Cx43+/-LDLR-/- mice compared with Cx43+/+LDLR-/- controls. Atheroma in Cx43+/-LDLR-/- mice contained fewer inflammatory cells and exhibited thicker fibrous caps with more collagen and smooth muscle cells. Next, we observed that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, or \"statins,\" lipid-lowering drugs well known for their pleiotropic antiatherogenic effects, reduced Cx43 expression in primary human vascular cells in vitro. Atheroma of LDLR-/- mice treated orally with pravastatin contained fewer inflammatory cells and exhibited thicker fibrous caps than controls. This was associated with reduced Cx43 expression in lesions of statin-treated mice.",

    "104": "Advanced pulmonary arterial hypertension is characterized by extensive vascular remodeling that is usually resistant to vasodilator therapy. Mevastatin is an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting step for cholesterol synthesis. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have been shown to upregulate the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 and to block cell proliferation through cholesterol-independent pathways. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of mevastatin on DNA synthesis, cell cycle progression, and cell proliferation in rat pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). We found that mevastatin induced G1 arrest and decreased DNA synthesis in rat PASMCs and did so in association with an increase in both total and cyclin E-bound p27Kip1. This caused a marked decrease in cyclin E kinase activity, which suggests an important role for p27Kip1 in the ability of mevastatin to induce G1 arrest. However, in PASMCs lacking functional p27Kip1, mevastatin still decreased cyclin E kinase activity, caused G1 arrest, and decreased DNA synthesis. In p27Kip1-deficient PASMCs, mevastatin induced a greater reduction of cyclin E protein levels (to 35% of control) than in wild-type cells (to 70% of control) and also reduced the phosphorylation of cdk2 on threonine 160. Mevastatin also caused apoptosis in both wild-type and p27Kip1-deficient PASMCs and was able to do so at a dose that did not induce cell cycle arrest. These data suggest that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors can both inhibit cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in PASMCs through p27Kip1-independent pathways and may be important therapeutic agents in pulmonary arterial hypertension.", 
    "105": "Atherosclerosis is the most common disease in the industrialised world and by 2020 is predicted to be the number 1 cause of death worldwide. It is a disease of the intima and media of small to medium sized arteries that develop slowly over many years. A number of risk factors for atherosclerosis have been identified, some of these are reversible and some are not. Most prominent amongst these is an elevated level of plasma cholesterol. The lowering of cholesterol reduces the risk of heart attacks, strokes and all forms of atherosclerotic vascular disease. Nonetheless, 70% of patients go on to get symptomatic disease. The disease process sets off an inflammatory response involving the vascular endothelium and both T and B cells of the immune system. Adhesion molecules are induced and proinflammatory cytokines and growth factors are produced by cells that orchestrate the atherosclerotic process. Narrowing the lumen of the artery leads to ischaemic symptoms. Within lesions under the influence of proteolytic enzymes released from activated macrophages (or foam cells--the hallmark of atherosclerosis) the centre of the plaque becomes liquefied to take on it's characteristic \"gruel\" like appearance. The shoulders of such plaque weaken and it becomes prone to rupture. Plaque rupture may lead to catastrophic thrombosis of coronary or cerebral arteries. The large amounts of tissue factor produced by macrophages make this a particularly likely event. On ulcerated plaques adherent platelets and thrombus create showers of emboli leading to ischaemic attacks. Like the effective treatment of LDL and it's role in the prevention of ischaemic attacks there has been a move to develop new drugs that raise HDL. The discovery of the role of a new class of ABC transporter, defective in Tangiers disease, responsible for cholesterol efflux from peripheral cells including the macrophage has created great excitement around ABC1 as a drug target. New areas, new possible targets and new genetic and genomic approaches will be discussed.",

Two tobacco lines, BC3 and rCAB8, that produce PHB in both the cytosol and plastids were used. An acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibitor, D-(+)-Quizalofop-ethyl, increased PHB accumulation in both lines 2-fold. The accumulation rate of plastidial PHB in the rCAB8 line was 2.5-fold higher than that of cytosolic PHB in the BC3 line. A specific inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, mevastatin, also increased PHB accumulation but only in the BC3 line. These results indicated that chemical regulation of the native metabolic flows by the specific enzyme inhibitors increased secondary-metabolite production in the transgenic tobacco plants we used.",

The risk of fibrate/statine myopathy, the most common side effect of fibrate/statine therapy, increases with dosage, combination of a fibrate with a statine,hypothyroidism, renal insufficiency, and intake of cytochrome P450 inhibitors. In case of clinical signs of a fibrate/statine myopathy such as proximal myalgias, stiffness,weakness, and dark urine, appropriate investigations should be initiated. If they establish the diagnosis of fibrate/statine myopathy, lipid lowering drugs should be immediately withdrawn. If rhabdomyolysis is present, prompt and adequate therapy is required. Though muscle abnormalities are rare side effects, fibrate/statine therapy should be regularly monitored with regard to clinical and laboratory alterations.

To examine the role of c-Src in vivo, we exercised C57Blk/6 and c-Src heterozygous (c-Src(+/-)) mice on a treadmill for 3 wk. Western analysis demonstrated that c-Src(+/-) mice express less than one-half the normal amount of c-Src. Exercise increased heart rate and blood pressure to identical levels in both strains as determined using radiotelemetry. Exercise training increased eNOS protein >2-fold in the aorta and 1.7-fold in the heart in C57Blk/6 mice but had no effect on eNOS protein levels in c-Src(+/-) mice. In contrast to exercise, treatment of mice with mevastatin, which stimulates expression of eNOS posttranscriptionally, increased eNOS protein in both strains. Training also increased aortic extracellular superoxide dismutase protein expression, which is regulated by nitric oxide, in C57Blk/6 mice but not in c-Src(+/-)mice. These data indicate that c-Src has an important role in modulating vascular adaptations to exercise training, in particular increasing eNOS and extracellular superoxide dismutase protein expression.",

Moreover, VSMC proliferation stimulated with native low-density lipoprotein (100 microg of protein/mL) was prevented by either human recombinant BMP-2 or BMP-7 at concentrations of 100 ng/mL (P<0.05). Both BMPs also inhibited basal cell proliferation (P<0.05).

Twenty-eight patients who met study entry criteria were randomized to policosanol 10 mg or lovastatin 20 mg tablets once daily. Walking distances in a treadmill (constant speed 3.2 km/hr, slope 10 degrees, temperature 25 degrees C) were assessed before and after 20 weeks of treatment. Both groups were similar at randomization. Compared with baseline, policosanol increased significantly (p < 0.01) the initial claudication distance (ICD) from 160.39 +/- 15.82 m to 211.31 +/- 21.48 m (+33.7%) and the absolute claudication distance (ACD) (p < 0.001) from 236.39 +/- 25.44 m to 288.09 +/- 28.47 m (+24.3%); meanwhile both variables remained unchanged after lovastatin therapy. Changes in ICD and ACD were significantly larger in the policosanol than in the lovastatin group (p < 0.01). Policosanol, but not lovastatin, significantly increased (p < 0.05) the ankle/arm index, although between-group differences were not significant. The frequency of patients reporting improvement on quality of life domains was greater in the policosanol than in the lovastatin group. Policosanol significantly (p < 0.001) lowered total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) by 17.5% and 31.0%, respectively, and meanwhile increased (p < 0.01) high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels by 31.5%. Lovastatin reduced (p < 0.01) TC (18.0%), LDL-C (22.6%), and (p < 0.05) triglycerides (9.8%). In addition, policosanol, but not lovastatin, moderately, but significantly, reduced (p < 0.05) fibrinogen levels, so that final values and percent changes in both groups were different (p < 0.01). Treatments were well tolerated. Only 1 lovastatin patient withdrew from the study because of a nonfatal myocardial infarction. Five lovastatin patients, but none from the policosanol group, experienced 6 adverse events (AE) (p < 0.01).

    "116": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors have been reported to inhibit vascular smooth muscle cell growth, a key event in the pathogenesis of proliferative vascular diseases. The mechanism by which HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors exert their antiproliferative activity is not fully understood, especially their effect on DNA replication. We therefore investigated the effects of atorvastatin on minichromosome maintenance (MCM) protein 6 and 7 expression in vascular smooth muscle cells, two proteins essential for initiation of DNA replication. Stimulation of quiescent rat aortic vascular smooth muscle cells with fetal bovine serum induced MCM6 and MCM7 protein and mRNA expression, which was potently attenuated by atorvastatin in a dose-dependent fashion. Mevalonate completely abrogated the inhibitory effect on serum-induced MCM6 and MCM7 expression, demonstrating that biosynthesis of isoprenoids was likely the specific pathway blocked by atorvastatin. Transient transfection experiments revealed that atorvastatin inhibited MCM6 and MCM7 promoter activity, implicating a transcriptional mechanism. The MCM6 and MCM7 promoters contain several E2F sites critical for their transcriptional activation. Activity of a luciferase reporter plasmid containing four E2F elements was also strongly inhibited by atorvastatin. The inhibitory effect of atorvastatin on MCM6 and MCM7 was reversed by adenoviral-mediated overexpression of E2F, indicating that their downregulation by atorvastatin involves an E2F-dependent mechanism. These findings demonstrate that MCM proteins play an essential role during the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells and may provide a novel therapeutic target for proliferative vascular diseases. Inhibition of MCM6 and MCM7 expression by blocking E2F function may contribute importantly to the inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cell DNA synthesis by atorvastatin.", 
    "117": "Lipid lowering therapy by statins and antiaggregation have become the basis of any anti-atherosclerotic prophylaxis either as primary or secondary prophylaxis. As several recent papers indicated immunosuppressive properties of statins we investigated changes in lymphocyte subpopulations, apoptosis markers, and cellular immune response towards mitogens after a short-term therapy with atorvastatin and clopidogrel. Nine healthy volunteers (four male, five female, age ranging from 26 to 43 years) were treated with 20 mg atorvastatin for 4 weeks and for 2 additional weeks with 20 mg atorvastatin and 75 mg clopidogrel after oral consent was given. Lymphocyte subpopulations were counted by flow cytometry. To assess cellular in vitro immune function, lymphocyte transformation tests with four mitogens (PHA, ConA, PWM, and OKT3) were performed. Absolute leucocyte counts remained unchanged as well as the granulocyte, monocyte, lymphocyte, and lymphocyte subpopulation counts. There were no detectable changes in markers of cell activation (HLA-DR, CD25, CD69, and CD86) or apoptosis (CD95, annexin). Cellular in vitro responses towards four mitogens did not show significant changes after atorvastatin nor after atorvastatin plus clopidogrel treatment.In conclusion, our data show that atorvastatin is not an immunosuppressive drug under therapeutical conditions.",

This article is a summary of what is known about how PTHs stimulate bone growth. The controversial bone anabolic activities of the cholesterol-lowering lipophilic statins are also described, and mechanisms by which they may stimulate bone growth are presented. Finally, evidence is presented for the body's \"fat-o-stat\" cytokine--leptin--indirectly restraining bone growth via a hypothalamic factor, while at the same time serving as a local PTH-like autocrine/paracrine stimulator of osteoblast activity, as well as an inhibitor of osteoclast generation.",

Bezafibrate (400 mg/day) and pravastatin (10 mg/day) were given to 27 Japanese diabetics in a randomized crossover design. RLP cholesterol (RLP-C) and RLP triglyceride (RLP-TG) were measured by an immunoseparation technique. LDL and HDL were separated each into three subclasses (large, medium, small) and their cholesterol (C) contents were measured by an HPLC method. RLP-C was reduced more effectively by pravastatin (bezafibrate -16.0% vs. pravastatin -40.6%, P < 0.05), whereas RLP-TG was reduced more effectively by bezafibrate (-55.2% vs. -35.0%, P < 0.05). Further, pravastatin decreased large and small LDL-C levels equally (large; -23.6%; medium; -17.2%, small; -21.0%), while bezafibrate produced a relatively larger reduction in small LDL-C (-12.1; -16.9; -21.5%). Whereas bezafibrate significantly decreased large HDL-C and increased medium and small HDL-C (-49.6; 34.1; 35.8%), pravastatin significantly increased only medium HDL-C (5.2; 9.4; 5.9%). Bezafibrate reduced RLP-C and RLP-TG more effectively in patients with high TG levels, whereas pravastatin's effect was not markedly influenced by the initial TG level. Thus measurements of RLP-C, RLP-TG, and HPLC subclasses revealed that bezafibrate and pravastatin differently influence the lipoprotein status in type 2 diabetes.",

    "121": "Brain ischemia was induced in rats by the permanent occlusion of middle cerebral artery (MCAO) and the brain infarct size followed up in alive animals 2, 24, and 48 hours after MCAO, using the trace of apparent diffusion coefficient [Tr(D)] maps and T2-weighted images. In vehicle-treated rats, the infarct volumes increased by 38.5% and 89% after 24 and 48 hours, respectively, compared with the damage detected at 2 hours after MCAO. Treatment with simvastatin (20 mg/kg) after MCAO prevented the increase in brain infarct volume occurring at 24 hours and induced a 46.6% reduction after 48 hours. This effect was similar to that observed when simvastatin was administered before the induction of focal ischemia. T2W-MRI images confirmed these findings. The neuroprotective effects of simvastatin were paralleled by an increase in endothelial NO synthase immunoreactivity, detectable in the brain of simvastatin-treated rats.", 
    "122": "Statins, in addition to their preventive effect on cerebral ischemia, exert a neuroprotective role in the attenuation of brain damage after acute stroke."
