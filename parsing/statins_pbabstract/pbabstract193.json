The regulation of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), the enzyme responsible for metabolizing ADMA, is poorly understood. The transcription factor sterol response element binding protein (SREBP) is activated by statins via a reduction of membrane cholesterol content. Because the promoters of both DDAH1 and DDAH2 isoforms contain sterol response elements, we tested the hypothesis that simvastatin regulates DDAH1 and DDAH2 transcription via SREBP. In cultured endothelial cells, simvastatin increased DDAH1 mRNA expression compared with vehicle. In an ADMA loading experiment, simvastatin treatment resulted in a decrease in ADMA content, an indication of increased DDAH activity. The knockdown of SREBP1c protein led to an increase in DDAH1 mRNA expression and activity, whereas the knockdown of SREBP2 led to a decrease in DDAH1 mRNA expression. The role of SREBP2 in the activation of the DDAH1 was supported by chromatin immunoprecipitation studies demonstrating increased binding of SREBP2 to the DDAH1 promoter upon simvastatin stimulation. These data indicate that SREBP1c might act as a repressor and SREBP2 as an activator of DDAH transcription and activity. This study describes a novel mechanism of reciprocal regulation by the SREBP family members of the DDAH-ADMA system, which represents a potential link between cellular cholesterol content and endothelial dysfunction observed in cardiovascular disease.", 
    "1": "Beta1-containing adhesions at the plasma membrane function as dynamic complexes to provide bidirectional communication between the cell and its environment, yet commonly are used by pathogens to gain host cell entry. Recently, the cholesterol-lowering drug simvastatin was found to inhibit host invasion through beta1-containing adhesion complexes. To better understand the regulatory mechanisms controlling adhesion formation and uptake and the use of these complexes by Staphylococcus aureus, the primary etiologic agent in sepsis, bacteremia and endocarditis, we investigated the mechanism of inhibition by simvastatin. In response to simvastatin, adhesion complexes diminished as well as beta1 trafficking to the plasma membrane required to initiate adhesion formation. Simvastatin stimulated CDC42 activation and coupling to p85, a small-guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) activating protein (GAP), yet sequestered CDC42 coupled to p85 within the cytosol. Loss of p85 GAP activity through use of genetic strategies decreased host cell invasion as well as beta1 trafficking. From these findings, we propose a mechanism whereby p85 GAP activity localized within membrane compartments facilitates beta1 trafficking. By sequestering p85 within the cytosol, simvastatin restricts the availability and uptake of the receptor used by pathogenic strains to gain host cell entry.",

Fibrates have been shown to reduce plasma triglycerides and increase HDL cholesterol, while improving inflammation, thrombogenesis and endothelial dysfunction. Clinical trials with fibrates have demonstrated their potential to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality too, often through other mechanisms than those of statins. Combination trials of statins with fibrates have shown a more complete improvement of lipid profile and risk markers than each class separately. In contrast with gemfibrozil, fenofibrate does not interact significantly with the pharmacokinetics of statins, and its combination with statins has been shown to have a low risk of muscular side-effects or liver toxicity.

However, statin can also activate protein kinase C (PKC), which augments hepatic fibrogenesis and is thereby likely to reduce the antifibrotic efficacy of statin. This study was designed to explore the hypothesis that simultaneous treatment with statin and PKC inhibitor may synergistically enhance antifibrotic efficacy in hepatic fibrosis. Hepatic fibrosis models were established in BALB/c mice by intraperitoneal injection of carbon tetrachloride or thioacetamide for 6 wk. Pravastatin and enzastaurin (PKC inhibitor) were administered by gavage for 5 wk. Cellular apoptosis was explored using 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole or terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate biotin nick end-labeling (TUNEL) staining and immunoblot analysis. Hepatic fibrosis and hepatic stellate cell (HSC) activation were assessed by morphometric analysis of histological findings and immunohistochemistry for alpha-smooth muscle actin. In vitro, the addition of PKC inhibitor significantly increased statin-induced LX-2 cell apoptosis by enhancing the activation of mitochondrial apoptotic signals. TUNEL-positive HSCs were significantly increased in mice treated with statin + PKC inhibitor compared with those in control or single compound-treated mice. The percentage of area occupied by activated HSCs and the extent of collagen deposition were significantly decreased in mice treated with statin + PKC inhibitor compared with those in control or statin-treated mice. In conclusion, simultaneous treatment with statin and PKC inhibitor synergistically enhanced the antifibrotic efficacy in both in vitro and in vivo models of hepatic fibrosis and may therefore have therapeutic implication for reducing hepatic fibrosis.", 
    "30": "Pre-eclampsia, a pregnancy-specific multi-organ syndrome characterized by widespread endothelial damage, is a new risk factor for cardiovascular disease. No therapies exist to prevent or treat this condition, even to achieve a modest improvement in pregnancy length or birth weight. Co-administration of soluble VEGFR-1 [VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) receptor-1; more commonly known as sFlt-1 (soluble Fms-like tyrosine kinase-1)] and sEng (soluble endoglin) to pregnant rats elicits severe pre-eclampsia-like symptoms. These two anti-angiogenic factors are increased dramatically prior to the clinical onset of pre-eclampsia and are quite possibly the 'final common pathway' responsible for the accompanying signs of hypertension and proteinuria as they can be reversed by VEGF administration in animal models. HO-1 (haem oxygenase-1), an anti-inflammatory enzyme, and its metabolite, CO (carbon monoxide), exert protective effects in several organs against oxidative stimuli. In a landmark publication, we showed that the HO-1 pathway inhibits sFlt-1 and sEng in cultured cells and human placental tissue explants. Both CO and NO (nitric oxide) promote vascular homoeostasis and vasodilatation, and activation of VEGFR-1 or VEGFR-2 induced eNOS (endothelial nitric oxide synthase) phosphorylation, NO release and HO-1 expression. Our studies established the HO-1/CO pathway as a negative regulator of cytokine-induced sFlt-1 and sEng release and eNOS as a positive regulator of VEGF-mediated vascular morphogenesis. These findings provide compelling evidence for a protective role of HO-1 in pregnancy and identify it as a target for the treatment of pre-eclampsia. Any agent that is known to up-regulate HO-1, such as statins, may have potential as a therapy. Any intervention achieving even a modest prolongation of pregnancy or amelioration of the condition could have a significant beneficial health impact worldwide.", 
    "31": "Biological pathways are seen as highly critical in our understanding of the mechanism of biological functions. To collect information about pathways, manual curation has been the most popular method. However, pathway annotation is regarded as heavily time-consuming, as it requires expert curators to identify and collect information from different sources. Even with the pieces of biological facts and interactions collected from various sources, curators have to apply their biological knowledge to arrange the acquired interactions in such a way that together they perform a common biological function as a pathway. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for automated pathway synthesis that acquires facts from hand-curated knowledge bases. To comprehend the incompleteness of the knowledge bases, our approach also obtains facts through automated extraction from Medline abstracts. An essential component of our approach is to apply logical reasoning to the acquired facts based on the biological knowledge about pathways. By representing such biological knowledge, the reasoning component is capable of assigning ordering to the acquired facts and interactions that is necessary for pathway synthesis. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach with the development of a system that synthesizes pharmacokinetic pathways. We evaluate our approach by reconstructing the existing pharmacokinetic pathways available in PharmGKB. Our results show that not only that our approach is capable of synthesizing these pathways but also uncovering information that is not available in the manually annotated pathways.",

    "63": "All interventions were equally effective at reducing total cholesterol, although only the statins also blunted the progressive reductions to vascular NO bioavailability, evidenced by greater maintenance of acetylcholine-induced dilator responses, an attenuation of adrenergic constrictor reactivity, and an improvement in agonist-induced NO production. Comparably, while minimal improvements to arteriolar wall mechanics were identified with any of the interventions, chronic statin treatment reduced the rate of microvessel rarefaction in OZR. Associated with these improvements was a striking statin-induced reduction in inflammation in OZR, such that numerous markers of inflammation were correlated with improved microvascular reactivity and density. However, using multivariate discriminant analyses, plasma RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted), interleukin-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and tumor necrosis factor alpha were determined to be the strongest contributors to differences between groups, although their relative importance varied with time.", 
    "64": "While the positive impact of chronic statin treatment on vascular outcomes in the metabolic syndrome are independent of changes to total cholesterol, and are more strongly associated with improvements to vascular NO bioavailability and attenuated inflammation, these results provide both a spatial and temporal framework for targeted investigation into mechanistic determinants of vasculopathy in the metabolic syndrome.", 
    "65": "Vascular surgery is associated with a high risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality that is partly attributable to inflammatory stress induced by the surgical procedure. Preoperative initiation of a long-acting statin is a strategy intended to reduce the inflammatory stress response and the excess risk associated with vascular surgery. The Dutch Echocardiographic Cardiac Risk Evaluation Applying Stress Echo III demonstrated significant reductions in perioperative myocardial ischemia and the composite end point of myocardial infarction or cardiovascular death with extended-release fluvastatin (relative to placebo) initiated 30 days prior to vascular surgery. These benefits were achieved with no increase in liver dysfunction, evidence of myopathy, or other side effects. Observational data suggest that perioperative statin use is associated with improved recovery from acute kidney injury after high-risk vascular surgery and with improved long-term survival in patients undergoing such surgery.", 
    "66": "It has been proposed that paraoxonase1 (PON1), a high density lipoprotein (HDL)-associated esterase/lactonase, has anti-atherosclerotic properties. The activity of PON1 is influenced by PON1 polymorphisms. However, the influence of PON1 polymorphisms on PON1 activity and oxidative stress in response to lipid-lowering drugs remains poorly understood. The objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of atorvastatin on PON1 activity and oxidative status. The influence of PON1 polymorphisms on PON1 activity and oxidative status in response to atorvastatin treatment was also evaluated. In total, 22 hypercholesterolemic patients were treated with atorvastatin at a dose of 10 mg/day for 3 months. Lipid profile, lipid oxidation markers (malondialdehyde (MDA), conjugated diene (CD), total peroxides (TP)), total antioxidant substance (TAS), oxidative stress index (OSI), and paraoxonase1 activity were determined before and after treatment. L55M, Q192R, and T(-107)C PON1 polymorphisms were also determined. Atorvastatin treatment significantly reduced the levels of total cholesterol (24.5%), low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (25.4%), triglycerides (24.4%), CD (4.4%), MDA (15.2%), TP (13.0%) and OSI (24.0%), and significantly increased the levels of TAS (27.3%), and PON1 activity (14.0%). Interestingly, the increase in PON1 activity and the reduction in oxidative stress in response to atorvastatin were influenced only by the PON1 T-107C polymorphism. Atorvastatin treatment improved the lipid profile, lipid oxidation, and oxidative/antioxidative status markers including the activity of PON1 towards paraoxon. These beneficial effects may be attributed to the antioxidant properties of statins and the increase in PON1 activity. The increase in PON1 activity was enhanced by the PON1 T-107C polymorphism.",

Targeting p38MAPK using drugs reported to interfere with its phosphorylation, namely statins and all-trans retinoic acid (atRA), might play a role in ameliorating this remodeling.", 
    "68": "Cardiac remodeling was induced in male albino rats by chronic inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis by N-nitro L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). Daily oral administration of L-NAME for 4 weeks resulted in the elevation of mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) together with cardiac remodeling evidenced by an increase in left ventricular-body weight ratio together with an increase in cardiac hydroxyproline concentration and a decrease in left ventricular papillary muscle-developed tension. An elevation in cardiac phosphorylated p38MAPK concentration, tumor necrosis factor alpha concentration and in cardiac caspase 3 activity was also observed. Administration of either rosuvastatin or all-trans retinoic acid (atRA), starting 4 weeks after L-NAME administration, ameliorated remodeling and improved all studied parameters.",

The purpose of this study was to determine the contribution of isolated low HDL cholesterol to endothelial function. Thirty-nine subjects with low HDL cholesterol who had no other cardiovascular risk factors were selected from the 5,417 participants from our population. We evaluated flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) before and after 4 wk of treatment with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor pravastatin in 29 of the 39 subjects with isolated low HDL cholesterol. FMD was lower in the low-HDL-cholesterol group (n = 29) than in the control group (n = 29), whereas NTG-induced vasodilation was similar in the two groups. Pravastatin increased HDL cholesterol, urinary excretion of nitrite/nitrate, circulating levels of progenitor cells, and cell migration response to vascular endothelial growth factor in 15 subjects with low HDL cholesterol but not in 14 placebo control subjects. FMD increased in the pravastatin treatment group but not in the control group. NTG-induced vasodilation was similar before and after 4 wk of treatment in the two groups. Multiple regression analysis revealed that changes in HDL cholesterol, the number of progenitor cells, and migration of progenitor cells were independent predictors of augmentation of FMD with pravastatin. These findings suggest that low HDL cholesterol is an independent risk factor for endothelial dysfunction and that pravastatin improves endothelial function in individuals with isolated low HDL cholesterol through, at least in part, an increase in circulating progenitor cells.", 
    "77": "Farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), a key intermediate in the mevalonate pathway and protein farnesylation, can act as an agonist for several nuclear hormone receptors. Here we show a novel mechanism by which FPP inhibits wound healing acting as an agonist for glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Elevation of endogenous FPP by the squalene synthetase inhibitor zaragozic acid A (ZGA) or addition of FPP to the cell culture medium results in activation and nuclear translocation of the GR, a known wound healing inhibitor. We used functional studies to evaluate the effects of FPP on wound healing. Both FPP and ZGA inhibited keratinocyte migration and epithelialization in vitro and ex vivo. These effects were independent of farnesylation and indicate that modulation of FPP levels in skin may be beneficial for wound healing. FPP inhibition of keratinocyte migration and wound healing proceeds, in part, by repression of the keratin 6 gene. Furthermore, we show that the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA-reductase inhibitor mevastatin, which blocks FPP formation, not only promotes epithelialization in acute wounds but also reverses the effect of ZGA on activation of the GR and inhibition of epithelialization. We conclude that FPP inhibits wound healing by acting as a GR agonist. Of special interest is that FPP is naturally present in cells prior to glucocorticoid synthesis and that FPP levels can be further altered by the statins. Therefore, our findings may provide a better understanding of the pleiotropic effects of statins as well as molecular mechanisms by which they may accelerate wound healing.",

We report efficient expression of the lovastatin nonaketide synthase (LovB) from an engineered strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, as well as complete reconstitution of its catalytic function in the presence and absence of cofactors (the reduced form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate and S-adenosylmethionine) and its partner enzyme, the enoyl reductase LovC. Our results demonstrate that LovB retains correct intermediates until completion of synthesis of dihydromonacolin L, but off-loads incorrectly processed compounds as pyrones or hydrolytic products. Experiments replacing LovC with analogous MlcG from compactin biosynthesis demonstrate a gate-keeping function for this partner enzyme. This study represents a key step in the understanding of the functions and structures of this family of enzymes.", 
    "79": "Quantitative measurements of the progression (or regression) of carotid plaque burden are important in monitoring patients and evaluating new treatment options. We previously developed a quantitative metric to analyze changes in carotid plaque morphology from 3-D ultrasound (US) on a point-by-point basis. This method requires multiple segmentations of the arterial wall and lumen boundaries to obtain the local standard deviation (SD) of vessel-wall-plus-plaque thickness (VWT) so that t-tests could be used to determine whether a change in VWT is statistically significant. However, the requirement for multiple segmentations makes clinical trials laborious and time-consuming. Therefore, this study was designed to establish the relationship between local segmentation SD and local signal difference on the arterial wall and lumen boundaries. We propose metrics to quantify segmentation SD and signal difference on a point-by-point basis, and studied whether the signal difference at arterial wall or lumen boundaries could be used to predict local segmentation SD. The ability to predict the local segmentation SD could eliminate the need of repeated segmentations of a 2-D transverse image to obtain the local segmentation standard deviation, thereby making clinical trials less laborious and saving time. Six subjects involved in this study were associated with different degrees of atherosclerosis: three carotid stenosis subjects with mean plaque area >3 cm(2) and >60% carotid stenosis were involved in a clinical study evaluating the effect of atorvastatin, a cholesterol-lowering and plaque-stabilizing drug; and three subjects with carotid plaque area >0.5 cm(2) were subjects with moderate atherosclerosis. Our results suggest that when local signal difference is higher than 8 greyscale value (GSV), the local segmentation SD stabilizes at 0.05 mm and is thus predictable. This information provides a target value of local signal difference on the arterial boundaries that should be achieved to obtain an accurate prediction of local segmentation SD.

    "82": "A total of 21,581 hospitalizations of 12,769 patients with primary diagnosis of HF were studied (average age 75). Monthly admission rate decreased by 10% over the study period, primarily due to a decrease in HF admissions of IHD etiology. Between 2000 and 2004 there was a significant increase in post-discharge purchase of beta-blockers (from 44.0% to 69.0%, p < 0.001) and statins (from 27.1% to 47.5%, p < 0.001). Mortality at 18 months post-discharge decreased from 38.9% to 33.9%. Multivariable analysis demonstrated that an annual mortality hazard decline could be explained by an increase in beta-blocker and statin use.",

Still, the reduction in the exercise group was not negligible (17.5%). Furthermore, reduced levels of IL-18 were significantly associated with improvement of an increasing number of components of the metabolic syndrome (P = 0.034). This effect is likely to be caused by exercise, because this intervention had a beneficial effect on components of the syndrome compared to the control group (P = 0.029).",

    "88": "Dyslipidemia is one of the major causes of atherosclerosis, although in the last few years an increase in cholesterol control rates has been reported. However, results from the European Action on Secondary and Primary Prevention by Intervention to Reduce Events (EUROASPIRE) surveys indicate that approximately 50% of the patients with ischemic heart disease still do not attain LDL-cholesterol goals despite the use of lipid-lowering therapy (including statins). Rosuvastatin is a new and potent statin that produces greater reductions of LDL-cholesterol when compared with other agents in this class. Furthermore, rosuvastatin provides additional benefits in the lipid profile such as increased HDL-cholesterol, and decreased triglycerides, total cholesterol, apolipoprotein B and apolipoprotein B:A-1 ratio. Cardiovascular disease is a continuum: from risk factors to subclinical organ damage and finally to overt clinical cardiovascular disease. Several trials have investigated the effects of rosuvastatin along this cardiovascular continuum. The results provided by the GALAXY program emphasize the importance of the early treatment with rosuvastatin in the cardiovascular continuum to achieve the greatest benefit. In this paper, the efficacy and safety of rosuvastatin along the cardiovascular continuum is reviewed.",

The treatments include heating (H), ozonation (O), drug (D) application using fluvastatin, Na2SO4(S) dosing and their combinations to make up for the total of 9 pretreatment methods. Heat treatment at 95 degrees C for 45 min provided a complete methanogen repression and good enhancement of hydrogen production activity. The remaining pretreatments were imperfect either for repression or enhancement based on the application conditions and concentration ranges. The order of methane repression was: H > HO > HD > HS > O > D > OD > OS > S while hydrogen production was: HO > H > HS > OD > HD > OS > D > O > S. Heat treatment at the specified condition was considered sufficient and suitable for pretreatment of anaerobic sludge. The practical application was explored using Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME) containing different amounts of solid content (15.830 g VSS L(-1), namely LPOME and 21.445 g VSS L(-1), namely HPOME) as substrate. Beside the difference in COD of nearly 16% which is higher for HPOME, a higher specific hydrogen production rate was obtained at 0.81 and 0.17 mL H2g (-1) COD h for LPOME and HPOME, respectively. It should also be noted that a prolonged lag-time during start-up was observed for HPOME as well as hydrogen suppression which may be associated with the solid content mainly lipids in wastewater. Thus, high solid content of wastewater may be of concerned for bio-hydrogen production.",

The pharmacokinetic parameters of verapamil and norverapamil in rats were measured after the oral administration of verapamil (9 mg/kg) in the presence or absence of lovastatin (0.3 or 1.0 mg/kg). The pharmacokinetic parameters of verapamil were significantly altered by the presence of lovastatin compared to the control group (given verapamil alone). The presence of lovastatin significantly (p < 0.05, 0.3 mg/kg; p < 0.01, 1.0 mg/kg) increased the total area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of verapamil by 26.5-64.8%, and the peak plasma concentration (C(max)) of verapamil by 34.1-65.9%. Consequently, the relative bioavailability (R.B.) of verapamil was increased by 1.27- to 1.65-fold than that of the control group. However, there was not significant change in the time to reach the peak plasma concentration (T(max)) and the terminal half-life (t(1/2)) of verapamil in the presence of lovastatin. The AUC and C(max) of norverapamil were significantly (p < 0.05) higher than those of presence of 1.0 mg/kg of lovastatin compared with the control group. However, there was no significant change in the metabolite-parent ratio (M.R.) of norverapamil in the presence of lovastatin. The presence of lovastatin significantly enhanced the oral bioavailability of verapamil. The enhanced oral bioavailability of verapamil may be due to inhibition both of the CYP3A-mediated metabolism and the efflux pump P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in the intestine and/or in liver by the presence of lovastatin.",

Migration and activation of donor-derived T lymphocytes play critical roles in the development of GVHD. Leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) regulates T cell adhesion and activation. We previously demonstrated that the I-domain, the ligand-binding site of LFA-1, changes from the low-affinity state to the high-affinity state on LFA-1 activation. Therapeutic antagonists, such as statins, inhibit LFA-1 activation and immune responses by modulating the affinity state of the LFA-1 I-domain. In the present study, we report that lovastatin blocked mouse T cell adhesion, proliferation, and cytokine production in vitro. Furthermore, blocking LFA-1 in the low-affinity state with lovastatin reduced the mortality and morbidity associated with GVHD in a murine BMT model. Specifically, lovastatin prevented T lymphocytes from homing to lymph nodes and Peyer's patches during the GVHD initiation phase and after donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) after the establishment of GVHD.

We have addressed the outcome of simvastatin treatment on the activation and effector function of human macrophages in the pathophysiologically relevant context of challenge with an opportunistic pathogen. We provide evidence that: simvastatin blocks the biological effects rapidly triggered by IgG-opsonized bacteria (phagocytosis and oxidative burst) while enhancing the delayed effects elicited by FcgammaR stimulation (production of proinflammatory mediators); these opposite effects of simvastatin result from enhancement of the JNK pathway and concomitant impairment of other signaling modules activated by FcgammaR engagement; and these activities are dependent on the capacity of simvastatin to block protein prenylation.

It is therefore not surprising that much research has been devoted to improving outcomes associated with this condition. Traditionally thought of as lipid-lowering agents, the 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (hereafter referred to as statins) have \"pleiotropic\" effects of clinical relevance. Several studies have reported an association between statin use and improved health outcomes, including those associated with pneumonia. While many of these are limited by their retrospective or observational methodology, the finding that statin use may improve pneumonia outcomes is tantalizing and worthy of further exploration. Our review of the literature found several potential mechanisms by which statins could influence the course of bacterial pneumonia. For instance, statins directly attenuate inflammation and inflammatory markers, are antioxidative and immunomodulatory, and exert in vitro antibacterial effects on microbial pathogens. On the other hand, statin use is also thought to be a surrogate marker for better health and may simply be a confounding variable when it comes to pneumonia. This article explores some of the potential mechanisms by which statin therapy may impact the course of pneumonia.

In addition to the critical role that LDL-C plays, recent studies have shown the contribution of other lipid fractions, such as high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides (TG), to overall cardiovascular health. Managed care initiatives to reduce cardiovascular risk typically focus on highly effective statin therapies, which are primarily LDL-C-lowering agents and have lesser TG-lowering and HDL-C-raising effects. However, clinical and epidemiologic data illustrate the need to expand the scope of therapies to reduce the residual cardiovascular risk associated with low HDL-C levels and elevated TG levels, even when LDL-C is managed successfully.", 
    "140": "To address the value of treating beyond LDL-C level to improve patient health outcomes and reduce health care-related costs.", 
    "141": "Several large trials and meta-analyses have investigated the effects of lipid-lowering statin therapy and have consistently demonstrated that statin therapy significantly reduces LDL-C levels and incidence of cardiovascular events. In spite of the efficacy of statin therapy in these studies, statins did not eliminate cardiovascular risk. Rather, significant residual cardiovascular risk remains after treatment with statins, especially in high-risk patients such as those with diabetes. Residual cardiovascular risk stems, at least partially, from low HDL-C and elevated TG. Low HDL-C levels have been identified as a significant, independent predictor of cardiovascular risk, and increases in HDL-C are associated with reductions in cardiovascular events. High TG levels are a significant risk factor for cardiovascular disease and are a marker for atherogenic remnant lipo-proteins, such as very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C). Additionally, with elevated TG levels, a combination of LDL-C with VLDL-C in the measure of non-HDL-C may be a better predictor of cardiovascular risk than LDL-C alone. Recent national treatment guidelines suggest that combination therapy may be necessary to address multiple lipid targets (i.e., LDL-C, non-HDL-C, HDL-C, and TG); adding niacin or a fibrate to a statin is a therapeutic option that should be considered. As monotherapy agents, fibrates and niacin have been demonstrated to alter several lipid parameters and reduce cardiovascular events. Niacin appears to exert the greatest beneficial effects on the widest range of lipoprotein abnormalities, in addition to possessing an established safety profile. Moreover, niacin/statin combination therapy may provide greater benefits, as manifested through a correction of atherogenic lipid abnormalities, a slowing of atherosclerosis progression in coronary heart disease (CHD) patients, and a reduction of residual cardiovascular risk. Pharmacoeconomic modeling studies have been used to describe the potential effects on both cardiovascular events and health care costs by the achievement of, or failure to achieve, combined optimal lipid values (OLVs). Achievement of OLVs is predicted to be associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular events, in which greater magnitudes of risk reduction accompany the achievement of a greater number of lipid goals. Based on patient baseline lipid values and product labeling information, mathematical models estimate that OLVs are achieved more frequently with extended-release niacin (niacin ER)/simvastatin combination therapy than with other high-potency agents. These modeling estimates were maintained in different patient groups, including those with diabetes or the metabolic syndrome. Finally, these modeling studies estimated that a fixed-dose niacin ER/simvastatin combination therapy would reduce direct medical costs of CHD events more effectively than would high-dose simvastatin monotherapy.", 
    "142": "Statins are highly effective for lowering LDL-C levels and, consequently, cardiovascular event rates. However, statins do not eliminate cardiovascular risk. Even in the presence of tightly controlled LDL-C levels, evidence indicates that high TG and low HDL-C levels are independent cardiovascular risk factors. Treating lipid parameters beyond LDL-C may require the addition of niacin or a fibrate to statin therapy. Niacin is the most effective agent for raising HDL-C levels, and pharmacoeconomic modeling suggests that niacin ER/statin combination therapy may promote the cost-effective achievement of OLVs in several at-risk patient populations.", 
    "143": "Experimental data, results of retrospective studies and of small randomized trials suggest an efficacy of upstream therapy of atrial fibrillation (AF) with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, statins and n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). These drugs seem to act by antagonizing the renin-angiotensin system, inflammation, oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction, all factors that play an important role in the genesis of the substrate of AF and atrial remodeling. However, the recent Italian GISSI-AF study, which is the first large, multicenter, prospective and randomized trial (valsartan vs placebo) dealing with upstream therapy in the secondary prevention of AF, offered negative results. A trend toward a lower incidence of AF recurrence was apparent only in the valsartan group in patients presenting with heart failure, even if statistical significance was not reached. On the basis of these recent data, we analyzed the contributions offered by the literature on upstream therapy of AF in patients with heart failure in order to evaluate a possible use of this treatment in clinical practice. Six retrospective studies dealing with the primary prevention of AF (3 with ACE-inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers and 3 with statins) have been published; in these studies, upstream therapy was constantly effective. A recent meta-analysis, which included trials dealing with the primary prevention of AF with ACE-inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, showed that patients with heart failure benefited the most. Up to now, the contributions on upstream therapy in the secondary prevention of AF in patients with heart failure are very few. These results are still not enough to recommend the clinical use of upstream therapy of AF in patients with heart failure because of the retrospective design of the studies. However, it emerges a background to plan a large-scale prospective, randomized trial on upstream therapy in the primary prevention of AF in patients with heart failure.", 
    "144": "Even with optimal statin therapy, many patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus or metabolic syndrome fail to achieve all lipid targets and remain at high risk of cardiovascular events. Add-on lipid-modifying therapy that is effective in improving the triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol abnormalities characteristic of these conditions is a recommended approach to reduce this risk. Fibrates or niacin is a logical option, supported by clinical studies showing improved lipid control in combination with a statin. Of the fibrates, fenofibrate may offer microvascular benefits in type 2 diabetes--as demonstrated by the Diabetes Atherosclerosis Intervention Study (DAIS) and the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) study--as well as a low risk of myopathy when combined with statins compared with gemfibrozil. Although there is good evidence that both agents favorably affect clinical outcome, we need to evaluate their impact against a baseline of statin therapy. We await data from ongoing large-scale studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these combinations and to determine the most appropriate option for reducing residual cardiovascular risk in this important patient population.", 
    "145": "The Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) study provides an extensive evidence base for the efficacy and tolerability of fenofibrate treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, predominantly in a primary prevention setting. The FIELD study did not show a significant effect with fenofibrate on the primary end point, coronary artery disease death or nonfatal myocardial infarction (p = 0.16). Treatment with fenofibrate did reduce all cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, the secondary end point (by 11%, p = 0.035). The primary end point was reduced by the same percentage. The modest percent reduction in the primary and secondary end points is probably a result of a number of study confounders, notably an excess of statin drop-in therapy and disproportionate treatment with other drugs for CVD prevention in the placebo arm. Estimates of relative risk reduction used by the FIELD investigators to equalize the use of statins in the fenofibrate and placebo groups suggest a true benefit of treatment on reduction of CVD events of 17%-21%. There was no excess of elevated serum liver enzymes and no cases of rhabdomyolysis in patients receiving both fenofibrate and a statin. Prevention of microvascular disease, specifically, reduction in the rate of laser treatment for retinopathy (by 30%, p = 0.0003), progression of albuminuria (p = 0.002), and nontraumatic amputations (by 38%, p = 0.011), may well be the most innovative finding of the FIELD study, especially in view of the current lack of effective preventative treatments for diabetic retinopathy and the need for additional treatments that slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy. These findings also give impetus to investigate mechanisms by which fenofibrate and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha activation may protect the endothelium of small blood vessels in patients with type 2 diabetes.", 
    "146": "Current treatment guidelines recommend lowering elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels with a statin as the primary lipid-modifying intervention to reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus or metabolic syndrome. However, even with high-dose statin therapy or the combination of statin plus ezetimibe, many patients remain at substantial risk of a cardiovascular event. Increasingly, there is recognition of the importance of treating all components of the atherogenic dyslipidemic profile associated with both conditions, specifically low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and elevated triglyceride levels, in addition to lowering LDL cholesterol. Both niacin (nicotinic acid) and fibrates are recommended as options for combination with a statin in this setting. Data from ongoing prospective outcomes studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of these combinations.",

In particular, a common genetic variant of organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1 reduces the hepatic uptake of many statins, increasing the risk of statin-induced myopathy. Similarly, genetically impaired adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette G2 transporter efflux activity results in a marked increase in systemic exposure to various statins.

In multivariable analysis, statins were not associated with AF (odds ratio (OR) 0.93, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.7 to 1.2; p = 0.59). However, in a subgroup analysis, the patients treated with Simvastatin >20 mg daily had a 36% reduction in the risk of postoperative AF (OR 0.64, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.6; p = 0.03) in comparison to those taking lower dosages.",

    "174": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) carries a high burden of morbidity and mortality and is associated with significant utilization of health care resources, especially in the elderly. Numerous randomized trials have established the efficacy of cholesterol reduction with statin medications in decreasing mortality in high-risk populations. However, it is not known what the effect of the utilization of these medications in complex older adults has had on mortality and on the utilization of health services, such as physician visits, hospitalizations or cardiovascular procedures.", 
    "175": "This project linked clinical and hospital data from the Improving Cardiovascular Outcomes in Nova Scotia (ICONS) database with administrative data from the Population Health Research Unit to identify all older adults hospitalized with ischemic heart disease between October 15, 1997 and March 31, 2001. All patients were followed for at least one year or until death. Multiple regression techniques, including Cox proportional hazards models and generalized linear models were employed to compare health services utilization and mortality for statin users and non-statin users.", 
    "176": "Of 4232 older adults discharged alive from the hospital, 1629 (38%) received a statin after discharge. In multivariate models after adjustment for demographic and clinical characteristics, and propensity score, statins were associated with a 26% reduction in all- cause mortality (hazard ratio (HR) 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63-0.88). However, statin use was not associated with subsequent reductions in health service utilization, including re-hospitalizations (HR, 0.98, 95% CI 0.91-1.06), physician visits (relative risk (RR) 0.97, 95% CI 0.92-1.02) or coronary revascularization procedures (HR 1.15, 95% CI 0.97-1.36).",

    "178": "Statins are cholesterol-lowering drugs that have been reported to promote bone formation. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of simvastatin on the enhancement of bone formation around titanium implants. Thirty-week-old female rats received pure titanium implants in both tibiae. The animals were intra-peritoneally administered 0, 0.125, 1, 5 or 10 mg kg(-1) of simvastatin daily. After 30 days, the animals were sacrificed, and specimens were prepared. The bone contact ratio of the implant, bone density in the medullary canal and percentage of cortical bone were obtained. Markers for bone turnover were also measured using sera collected at the time of euthanasia. In the medullary canal, a scanty amount of bone was observed in the 0, 0.125 and 1 mg kg(-1) groups. In contrast, in both the 5 and 10 mg kg(-1) groups, thicker bone trabeculae were abundant. Histometric observations showed that the bone contact ratio and the bone density of both groups were significantly greater than those of the other groups (anova, P < 0.01). However, no significant difference in the percentage of cortical bone was found between groups. Serum chemistry showed that statin increased bone formation markers and decreased bone resorption markers. In conclusion, although the dose equivalent to that used in human patients with hypercholesterolemia was not effective, a simvastatin dose of 5 mg kg(-1) or higher increased medullary bone formation around the titanium. In contrast, no effect of simvastatin on pre-existing cortical bone was indicated.",

The preoperative serum prostate-specific antigen levels, tumour volume and percentage of cancer in the RP specimen were significantly lower in patients taking statins. Overall, statin users had a proportionately lower rate of adverse tumour pathology features, including a significantly lower risk of positive (cancerous) surgical margins.",

    "183": "Statins, inhibitors of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, reduce the intracellular synthesis of cholesterol and prevent the onset of atherosclerosis. They also decrease the synthesis of isoprenoid molecules, such as the side chain of ubiquinone and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. As a consequence, statins impair mitochondrial metabolism and the activation of small monomeric GTPases (such as Rho and Ras), causing toxic effects. To date, a successful strategy to prevent statin toxicity is lacking.",

Geranylgeraniol, a cell-permeable analogue of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, reversed all these effects of mevastatin, without affecting its ability to reduce cholesterol synthesis. Notably, geranylgeraniol was more effective than the addition of exogenous ubiquinone, which rescued mitochondrial respiratory activity and reversed mevastatin cytotoxicity, but did not alter the decrease in cell proliferation. The same results were obtained in human liver HepG2 cells.", 
    "186": "Geranylgeraniol had a broader protective effect against the cytotoxicity of statins than exogenous ubiquinone. Therefore, geranylgeraniol may be a more useful and practical means of limiting the toxicities of statins, without reducing their efficacy as cholesterol lowering agents.",

Inhibitors of protein kinase C and tyrosine kinase, antioxidants and intracellular calcium chelator suppressed myoglobin-induced activation of c-Src kinase. Losartan and simvastatin suppressed myoglobin-induced VCAM-1 expression via inhibition of c-Src kinase.",

    "195": "Statins are known to stimulate osteoblast activity and bone formation. This study examines whether local application of fluvastatin enhances osteogenesis around titanium implants in vivo. Ten-week-old rats received a vehicle gel (propylene glycol alginate (PGA)) or PGA containing fluvastatin (3, 15, 75 or 300 microg) in their tibiae just before insertion of the implants. For both histological and histomorphometric evaluations undecalcified ground sections were obtained and the bone-implant contact (BIC), peri-implant osteoid volume and mineralized bone volume (MBV) were calculated after 1, 2 and 4 weeks. Using the same models mechanical push-in tests were also performed to evaluate the implant fixation strength. After 1 week the MBV and push-in strength were significantly lower in the 300 microg fluvastatin-treated group than in the other groups (P<0.01). At 2 weeks, however, the BIC and MBV were both significantly higher in the 75 microg fluvastatin-treated group than in the non-fluvastatin-treated groups (P<0.01). Similar tendencies were observed at week 4. Furthermore, the data showed a good correlation between the MBV and the push-in strength. These results demonstrate positive effects of locally applied fluvastatin on the bone around titanium implants and suggest that this improvement in osseointegration may be attributed to calcification of the peri-implant bone.",

    "197": "In an urban Romanian community there was studied a representative sample of 150 postmenopausal women with cardiovascular disease (62.7% of them with ischemic heart disease-IHD). We considered the secondary prevention by drugs. The results were compared with those registered in a similar sample of 160 men aged >55 years with cardiovascular disease (68.1% of them with IHD). The study was carried out using general practitioner's files.", 
    "198": "According to the literature, there were considered as preventive drugs: antiplatelet agents, statins, beta blockers and ACEI. Aspirin was used in 56.4% of the women and 72.5% of the men (p<0.05), ACEI in 69.1% and 79.8 % (p>0.05), beta blockers in 69.1% and 74.3 % (p>0.05) and statins in 48.9% and 48.6% (p>0.05). The results show that antiplatelet drugs are underused in ischemic patients, but especially in women. The maximum use of preventive drugs in women was registered after acute myocardial infarction (beta blockers 85.7%, statins 50%, aspirin 60.7%, ACEI 75%). In turn, the myocardial revascularization by CABG and PCI is low in both groups, but much less in women than in men: CABG 1.1% in women, 4.6% in men p>0.05, PCI 5.3% in women and 13.8% in men p<0.05.",

    "200": "Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is a key inflammatory response molecule, and associated with many immune functions of monocytes/macrophages. Particularly, interferon gamma (IFNgamma)-induced COX-2 expression appears in inflammatory conditions such as viral infection and autoimmune diseases. Recently, statins have been reported to show variable effects on COX-2 expression, and on their cell and species type dependences. Based on the above description, we compared the effect of simvastatin on IFNgamma-induced COX-2 expression in human monocytes versus murine macrophages. In a result, we found that simvastatin suppresses IFNgamma-induced COX-2 expression in human THP-1 monocytes, but rather, potentiates IFNgamma-induced COX-2 expression in murine RAW264.7 macrophages. However, signal transducer and activator of transcription 1/3 (STAT1/3), known as a transcription factor on COX-2 expression, is inactivated by simvastatin in both cells. Our findings showed that simvastatin is likely to suppress IFNgamma-induced COX-2 expression by inhibiting STAT1/3 activation in human THP-1 cells, but not in murine RAW264.7 cells. Thus, we concluded that IFNgamma-induced COX-2 expression is differently regulated by simvastatin depending on species specific mechanism.", 
    "201": "This project studied the lowering blood lipids effect in atherosclerotic ApoE-deficient mice. Group A mice (n = 6), fed with a normal diet, served as the negative control. The experimental groups used mice fed with a high cholesterol diet (HCD) for eight weeks, and then selected for inclusion in the study on the basis of high blood lipid levels and the formation of atherosclerotic lesion plaque, which was indicated by an ultrasound biomicroscopy test. Eighteen mice met the selection criteria (atherosclerotic mice with high blood lipid levels) and these were randomly assigned into three groups B, C and D (n = 6). Group B fed with a HCD, served as the positive control. The intervention Group C was fed with HCD and Simvastatin. The intervention Group D was fed with a HCD and Hawthorn fruit compound (HFC includes Hawthorn and Kiwi fruit extract) for eight weeks. The results showed that after feeding on a HCD, Group B had significantly higher blood lipid levels compared to Group A and this confirmed the validity of Group A and Group B controls in this study. The results also showed that compared to Group B, in both Group C and D, there was a significant reduction in triglyceride and in the ratio between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and serum cholesterol. Moreover a reduction of LDL-C was evident in Group D, whereas a similar effect did not occur in Group C. The results indicate that HFC can be considered for the treatment of hyperlipidemia and prevention of atherosclerosis.",

Of late, physicians have emphasized the use of statins in diabetic patients, which has resulted in much better levels of LDL-C, but still less than half of the patients are at ideal levels. In conclusion, we should revise our point of view to begin and intensify treatment of dyslipidaemia in diabetic patients, to achieve the goal of treatment and prevent cardiovascular events optimally.", 
    "206": "Statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) are well established in the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia and the prevention of coronary artery disease. Despite this, there is wide inter-individual variability in response to statin therapy, in terms of both lipid-lowering and adverse drug reactions. The major site of statin action is within hepatocytes and recent interest has focussed on genetic variation in hepatic influx and efflux transporters for their potential to explain these differences. In this review we explore current literature regarding the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic influence of the common c.388A>G and c.521T>C single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the solute carrier organic anion transporter 1B1 (SLCO1B1) gene, encoding the organic anion transporter polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1) influx transporter.

However, the effects of statins on G protein-mediated cardiac hypertrophy, which is the main pathway of cardiac hypertrophy, have not yet been studied. We sought to evaluate whether statin treatment directly suppresses cardiac hypertrophy through a large G protein-coupled pathway regardless of the regulation of small GTPases. Using neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, we evaluated norepinephrine-induced cardiac hypertrophy for suppressibility of rosuvastatin and the pathways involved by analyzing total protein/DNA content, cell surface area, immunoblotting and RT-PCR for the signal transduction molecule. In a concentration-dependent manner, rosuvastatin inhibited total protein synthesis and downregulated basal and norepinephrine-induced expressions of myosin light chain2 and the c-fos proto-oncogene in cardiomyocytes. Treatment with norepinephrine induced cardiac hypertrophy accompanied by G(h) expression and membrane translocation. Rosuvastatin inhibited G(h) protein activity in cardiomyocytes by inhibiting basal and norepinephrine-stimulated mRNA transcription, protein expression and membrane translocation; however, norepinephrine-stimulated G(q) protein expression was not inhibited. In addition, the norepinephrine-stimulated protein kinase C (PKC)-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK 1,2)-extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) signaling cascade was inhibited by pretreatment with rosuvastatin. Rosuvastatin treatment also helped maintain expression levels of SERCA2a and intracellular calcium concentration. G(h) protein is a novel target of statins in myocardial hypertrophy, and statin treatment may directly suppress cardiac hypertrophy through a large G(h) protein-coupled pathway regardless of the regulation of small GTPases.",

In routine clinical settings, few patients present with migraine attacks that clearly deviate from the typical frequency and severity of migraine, and migraine that is difficult to control with acute-phase treatment alone is frequently encountered. Under these circumstances, the importance of prophylactic therapy, including lifestyle guidance and drug treatment, has attracted attention. However, in Japan, only a small number of prophylactics are currently indicated for migraine, and the available options are insufficient. In this study, I have outlined the prophylactic strategies for migraine, including lifestyle guidance, on the basis of literature published in Europe and North America. In addition, I have presented my clinical experiences and research reports to introduce cases of migraine for which prophylactic therapy was indicated, to hypothesize the mechanisms of the prophylatic activity of specific drugs (e.g., anti-convulsants, anti-depressants, beta-blockers, AII antagonists, Ca channel blockers, leukotriene receptor antagonists, statins, anti-herpes zoster virus drugs) for their prophylactic effect on migraine, and to determine drug regimens."
