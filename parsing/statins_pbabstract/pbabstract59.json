    "0": "Necrotizing myopathy is defined by the predominant pathological feature of necrosis of muscle fibers in the absence of substantial lymphocytic inflammatory infiltrates. Most commonly necrotizing myopathies are divided into immune mediated (IMNM) and nonimmune mediated (NIMNM). IMNM has been associated with anti-signal recognition particle antibodies, connective tissue diseases, cancer, post-statin exposure with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A antibodies, and viral infections including HIV and hepatitis C. NIMNM is linked to medications and toxic exposures. Both IMNM and NIMNM are typically characterized by proximal weakness, although the severity can vary substantially. Myalgias are reported by some, but not all, patients. Pathological findings on muscle biopsy include predominant fiber necrosis with little or no inflammatory infiltrate. In IMNM, there is variable evidence for the deposition of membrane attack complex on capillaries and muscle fibers, although membrane attack complex deposition on capillaries is typically less than is seen in dermatomyositis; class I major histocompatibility complex expression on muscle fibers is variable but typically less than is seen in polymyositis. Immunohistochemical abnormalities are not typically seen in NIMNM. Treatment of IMNM involves immunosuppressive therapy, although there are no controlled trials to guide particular treatment choices. Treatment of NIMNM involves removal of the toxic exposure.",

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines provide the pharmacist with pertinent treatment recommendations relevant to day-to-day clinical practice and geriatric care. This article reviews these new evidencebased guidelines for cholesterol management in general and for the elderly specifically. The new guidelines have implications for older adults remaining on or starting statin therapy. With this review, and based on the new guidelines, pharmacists will be informed on how to provide hyperlipidemia recommendations for the older adult.

    "2": "Statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) are one of the principal reasons for statin non-adherence and/or discontinuation, contributing to adverse cardiovascular outcomes. This European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) Consensus Panel overviews current understanding of the pathophysiology of statin-associated myopathy, and provides guidance for diagnosis and management of SAMS. Statin-associated myopathy, with significant elevation of serum creatine kinase (CK), is a rare but serious side effect of statins, affecting 1 per 1000 to 1 per 10 000 people on standard statin doses. Statin-associated muscle symptoms cover a broader range of clinical presentations, usually with normal or minimally elevated CK levels, with a prevalence of 7-29% in registries and observational studies. Preclinical studies show that statins decrease mitochondrial function, attenuate energy production, and alter muscle protein degradation, thereby providing a potential link between statins and muscle symptoms; controlled mechanistic and genetic studies in humans are necessary to further understanding. The Panel proposes to identify SAMS by symptoms typical of statin myalgia (i.e. muscle pain or aching) and their temporal association with discontinuation and response to repetitive statin re-challenge. In people with SAMS, the Panel recommends the use of a maximally tolerated statin dose combined with non-statin lipid-lowering therapies to attain recommended low-density lipoprotein cholesterol targets. The Panel recommends a structured work-up to identify individuals with clinically relevant SAMS generally to at least three different statins, so that they can be offered therapeutic regimens to satisfactorily address their cardiovascular risk. Further research into the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms may offer future therapeutic potential.", 
    "3": "Hypercholesterolemia is a major risk factor for atherosclerosis. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering drugs reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, many individuals treated with statins do not achieve their target levels of LDL-C. So, there is great need for new drugs to reduce cholesterol in those patients who have not achieved target levels with statins as well as those who are statin intolerant. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a novel agent, which plays an important role in the regulation of cholesterol metabolism. It increases degradation of the low-density lipoprotein receptor, modulates cholesterol metabolism, and transport. This review will address new therapeutic strategies targeting PCSK9, including monoclonal antibodies, small interfering RNAs, and other small molecule inhibitors.", 
    "4": "Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is caused by genetic deficiency of LDL receptors leading to extremely high cholesterol levels and atherosclerosis at early ages. For the prevention of early atherosclerotic cardiovascular events, effective reduction of LDL-cholesterol is necessary from the early ages. However, particularly in homozygous patients, it's almost impossible to achieve target LDL-cholesterol levels with antilipid agents including statin agents, due to the severe LDL receptor dysfunction. LDL apheresis is an effective treatment modality in severe AH patients. However, the invasive, chronic time consuming nature of this treatment decreases the compliance of these patients. Moreover, atherosclerosis progress in 25% of the patients undergoing regular and effective apheresis even though since early ages. Clinical data also indicate that there is still an unmet medical need for new effective treatments for AH patients. This review will address new therapeutic strategies targeting Apolipoprotein (Apo) B including MTTP inhibitor Lomitapideand oligonucleotide Mipomersen. As both agents are targeted against ApoB, they are expected to be effective even in receptor negative homozygous AH patients.", 
    "5": "Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) is an autosomal co-dominant inherited disease associated with increased risk of early cardiovascular disease. Plasma low-density lipoprotein concentrations of the affected individuals are 2 to 3 times higher than the normal population. The prevalence of the HeFH is 1/500 and only 20% of the cases are diagnosed. A minority of the diagnosed patients (16%) are able to reach treatment. Early identification of the patients with HeFH enables exact treatment and prevention of the premature coronary artery disease. So, screening of the relatives of the index cases is essential. HeFH is diagnosed by the use of clinical criteria like family history, physical examination, and cholesterol levels. Mutation analysis may provide an accurate diagnosis in suspicious cases. Treatment strategies mostly aim to provide a reduction of low-density cholesterol levels of >50% from baseline. First-line treatment is statins. However, most of the patients with HeFH do not achieve target cholesterol levels with maximum tolerated doses of statins. Combinations of statins with ezetimibe, niacin or bile acid sequestrants have limited value. New classes of drugs for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia include microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitors, apolipoprotein B synthesis inhibitors, and pro-protein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 inhibitors.

This view has been embraced by the recent AHA/ACC guidelines, but is being challenged by recent studies including nonstatin medications and by the development of a new class of cholesterol-lowering agents that seems destined to early US Food and Drug Administration approval. The discovery of PCSK9 - a circulating protein that regulates hepatic low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and serum LDL cholesterol levels - has led to a race for its therapeutic inhibition.

ApoC-III is a potent modulator of many established CVD risk factors, and is found on chylomicrons, very-low density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, and high-density lipoprotein particles. Recent studies show that in humans, apoC-III levels are an independent risk factor for CVD, and its presence on lipoproteins may promote their atherogenicity. This year, two large-scale epidemiological studies have linked mutations in apoC-III with increased incidence of CVD and hypertriglyceridemia. ApoC-III raises plasma triglycerides through inhibition of lipoprotein lipase, stimulation of very-low density lipoprotein secretion, and is a novel factor in modulating intestinal triglyceride trafficking. ApoC-III also stimulates inflammatory processes in the vasculature and the pancreas. The combination of raising plasma triglycerides and independently stimulating inflammatory processes makes apoC-III a valuable target for reducing the residual CVD risk in patients already on statin therapy, or for whom triglycerides are poorly controlled. Clinical trials on apoC-III antisense oligonucleotides are in progress.",

We report here the metabolic reprogramming of the antibiotics producer Penicillium chrysogenum toward an industrial pravastatin production process. Following the successful introduction of the compactin pathway into the \u03b2-lactam-negative P. chrysogenum DS50662, a new cytochrome P450 (P450 or CYP) from Amycolatopsis orientalis (CYP105AS1) was isolated to catalyze the final compactin hydroxylation step. Structural and biochemical characterization of the WT CYP105AS1 reveals that this CYP is an efficient compactin hydroxylase, but that predominant compactin binding modes lead mainly to the ineffective epimer 6-epi-pravastatin. To avoid costly fractionation of the epimer, the enzyme was evolved to invert stereoselectivity, producing the pharmacologically active pravastatin form. Crystal structures of the optimized mutant P450(Prava) bound to compactin demonstrate how the selected combination of mutations enhance compactin binding and enable positioning of the substrate for stereo-specific oxidation. Expression of P450(Prava) fused to a redox partner in compactin-producing P. chrysogenum yielded more than 6 g/L pravastatin at a pilot production scale, providing an effective new route to industrial scale production of an important drug.",

As a consequence, there is the need for new therapeutic approaches with different mechanisms of action to reach recommended lipid targets in high-risk patients. One potential approach is to inhibit PCSK9, a serum protein with an active role in controlling the expression of LDL receptors, by reducing their recycling and targeting it for lysosomal destruction. Monoclonal antibodies against PCSK9, in particular alirocumab and evolocumab, have been shown to reduce LDL substantially, either with or without concomitant statin therapy with good tolerability.

    "54": "Diabetes mellitus is a powerful risk factor of coronary artery disease (CAD), leading to death and disability. In recent years, given the accumulating evidence that prediabetes is also related to increasing risk of CAD including cardiovascular events, a new guideline has been proposed for the treatment of blood cholesterol for primary prevention of cardiovascular events. This guideline recommends aggressive lipid-lowering statin therapy for primary prevention in diabetes and other patients. The ultimate goal of patient management is to inhibit progression of systemic atherosclerosis and prevent fatal cardiovascular events such as acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Because disruption of atherosclerotic coronary plaques is a trigger of ACS, the high-risk atheroma is called a vulnerable plaque. Several types of novel diagnostic imaging technologies have been developed for identifying the characteristics of coronary atherosclerosis before the onset of ACS, especially vulnerable plaques. According to coronary angioscopic evaluation, atherosclerosis severity and plaque vulnerability were more advanced in prediabetic than in nondiabetic patients and comparable to that in diabetic patients. In addition, pharmacological intervention by statin therapy changed plaque color and complexity, and the dynamic changes in plaque features are considered plaque stabilization. In this article, we review the findings of atherosclerosis in prediabetes, detected by intravascular imaging modalities, and the therapeutic implications.",

Relatively low numbers of atherothrombotic events among HF patients, in the context of their elevated competing risks for non-atherothrombotic causes of death, may have prevented previous analyses of clinical trials from detecting a benefit for statins. We pooled data from two landmark trials of HF patients not on statin therapy randomized to rosuvastatin 10\u2009mg daily vs. placebo, CORONA and GISSI-HF, in order to improve our power to detect statistically significant differences in atherothrombotic events.

However, intolerability because of myopathic symptoms often limits their use. We investigated the effects of simvastatin on parameters of mitochondrial function and muscle gene expression in 11 subjects with type 2 diabetes, none of whom had statin intolerance. After withdrawal of statins for 2 months, we obtained blood samples, performed vastus lateralis muscle biopsies, and assessed whole body resting energy expenditure (REE). We then reinitiated therapy using simvastatin, 20 mg/d, for 1 month before repeating these studies. As expected, simvastatin lowered low-density lipoprotein, but did not induce myalgias or significant increases in serum creatine kinase. However, we found subtle but significant reductions in muscle citrate synthase activity and REE. In addition, quantitative polymerase chain reaction and gene set enrichment analysis of muscle samples revealed significantly repressed gene sets involved in mitochondrial function and induced gene sets involved in remodeling of the extracellular matrix. Furthermore, the effects of simvastatin on muscle gene sets showed some similarities to previously described changes that occur in Duchenne muscular dystrophy, polymyositis, and dermatomyositis. Although statins inhibit an early step in coenzyme Q (CoQ) biosynthesis, we observed no differences in CoQ content within skeletal muscle mitochondria, muscle tissue, or circulating platelets. In summary, we report subtle changes in whole body energetics, mitochondrial citrate synthase activity, and microarray data consistent with subclinical myopathy. Although the benefits of statin therapy are clear, further understanding of muscular perturbations should help guide safety and tolerability.",

    "80": "Oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) and its homologues (ORPs) are lipid-binding/transfer proteins with affinity for oxysterols, cholesterol and glycerophospholipids. In addition to a ligand-binding domain, a majority of the ORPs carry a pleckstrin homology domain that targets organelle membranes via phosphoinositides, and a motif targeting the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) via VAMP-associated proteins (VAPs). We employed here Bimolecular Fluorescence Complementation (BiFC) to systematically assess the effects of sterol manipulation of HuH7 cells on complexes of established sterol-binding ORPs with their ER receptor, VAMP-associated protein A (VAPA). Depletion of cellular cholesterol with lipoprotein-deficient medium and Mevastatin caused concentration of OSBP-VAPA complexes and Golgi complex markers at a juxtanuclear position, an effect reversed by low-density lipoprotein treatment. A similar redistribution of OSBP-VAPA but not of sterol-binding deficient mutant OSBP(\u0394ELSK)-VAPA, occurred upon treatment with the high-affinity ligand, 25-hydroxycholesterol (25OHC), which reduced total and free cholesterol. ORP2-VAPA complexes, which localize in untreated cells at blob-like ER structures with associated lipid droplets, were redistributed upon treatment with the ORP2 ligand 22(R)OHC to a diffuse cytoplasmic/ER pattern and the plasma membrane. Analogously, distribution of ORP4L-VAPA complexes between the plasma membrane and vimentin intermediate filament associated compartments was modified by statin or 25OHC treatment. The treatments resulted in loss of vimentin co-localization, and sterol-binding deficient ORP4L(\u0394ELSR)-VAPA localized predominantly to the plasma membrane. In conclusion, treatment with statin or oxysterol ligands modify the subcellular targeting of ORP-VAPA complexes, consistent with the notion that this machinery controls lipid homeostasis and signaling at organelle interfaces.",

As such, alerting individuals on hypercholesterolemic conditions is a crucial component in averting onset of atherosclerosis and its outcome-cardiovascular diseases. While common diagnostic tools such as cholesterol and lipoproteins determination are widely employed for hypercholesterolemia screening, their effectiveness has been questioned since they do not shed light on critical physiological factors like lipid oxidation and inflammation levels, which constitute prominent determinants for development of atherosclerotic diseases. The objective of this study is to develop a simple assay for identifying hypercholesterolemia, and assessing the impact of therapeutic treatments.",

    "90": "Despite anticoagulation therapy, up to one-half of patients with deep vein thrombosis (DVT) will develop the post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). Improving the long-term outcome of DVT patients at risk for PTS will therefore require new approaches. Here we investigate the effects of statins--lipid-lowering agents with anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory properties--in decreasing thrombus burden and decreasing vein wall injury, mediators of PTS, in established murine stasis and non-stasis chemical-induced venous thrombosis (N = 282 mice). Treatment of mice with daily atorvastatin or rosuvastatin significantly reduced stasis venous thrombus burden by 25% without affecting lipid levels, blood coagulation parameters, or blood cell counts. Statin-driven reductions in VT burden (thrombus mass for stasis thrombi, intravital microscopy thrombus area for non-stasis thrombi) compared similarly to the therapeutic anticoagulant effects of low molecular weight heparin. Blood from statin-treated mice showed significant reductions in platelet aggregation and clot stability. Statins additionally reduced thrombus plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), tissue factor, neutrophils, myeloperoxidase, neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), and macrophages, and these effects were most notable in the earlier timepoints after DVT formation. In addition, statins reduced DVT-induced vein wall scarring by 50% durably up to day 21 in stasis VT, as shown by polarized light microscopy of picrosirius red-stained vein wall collagen. The overall results demonstrate that statins improve VT resolution via profibrinolytic, anticoagulant, antiplatelet, and anti-vein wall scarring effects. Statins may therefore offer a new pharmacotherapeutic approach to improve DVT resolution and to reduce the post-thrombotic syndrome, particularly in subjects who are ineligible for anticoagulation therapy.", 
    "91": "High level of Low Density Lipoprotein-Cholesterol (LDL-C) in circulation in the blood is associated with an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and stroke. Currently the statin drugs which inhibit the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase responsible for cholesterol synthesis in the liver are very effective in lowering LDL-cholesterol. However these drugs are often associated with serious side effects particularly for \u223c10-12% of cases. Therefore there is a need to develop non-statin based cholesterol reducing agents. Recently it was revealed that the secreted Proprotein Convertase Subtilisin Kexin 9 (PCSK9) binds with LDL-receptor (LDL-R) causing its degradation in the lysosome with the result of LDL-C accumulating in the blood. Thus PCSK9 has become an alternative target for development of non-statin cholesterol reducing agents. It is established that the catalytic domain of PCSK9 (aa153-421) and the EGF-A domain of LDL-R (aa314-355) are involved in the above bind leading to the reduction of LDL-R level and accumulation of LDL-C.", 
    "92": "The major goal of this study is to identify peptide/s from the catalytic domain of hPCSK9 that can block the binding of hPCSK9 and LDL-R and therefore can reduce LDL-R degradation leading to the clearance of LDL-C from the plasma.", 
    "93": "Using 51 synthetic linear peptides (P1-P51) of 15aa long with 10 amino acids overlapping sequences spanning the entire catalytic segment of hPCSK9 (aa153-421), we identified two domains of hPCSK9 namely (aa323-358) and (aa365-384) that exhibited strong binding affinity towards synthetic EGF-A peptide. The results were based on mass spectrometry, fluorescence spectroscopy and native gel electrophoresis. Thus peptides containing the above segments in part (P35-P39 and P42-P47) exhibited LDL-R promoting activity when added exogenously to culture medium of growing human hepatic cells like HepG2 and HuH7. The effects were particularly significant with peptides P36, P37, P46 and P47. Interestingly, the first two peptides are present within the disulphide loop Cys(323)-Cys(358) and contain the key gain of function mutation D(374)/Y site while the last two peptides contain another disulphide bridge loop Cys(375)-Cys(378) and the second most potent gain of function mutation R(357)/H. Further studies revealed that S-S bridged cyclic loop peptide hPCSK9(365-384) exhibited the highest (\u223c3.5-fold) LDL-R promoting activity in both HepG2 and HuH7 when applied at 5\u00a0\u03bcM concentration level. This effect is completely abrogated when one of the Cys residues is substituted by Ala thereby preventing any S-S bond formation. This suggested its critical role in the bioactivity. It is proposed that LDL-R promoting activity of this and other selected PCSK9 catalytic peptides such as P36, P37, P46 and P47 are most likely mediated via intervention of PCSK9:LDL-R complex formation. Our findings may find useful application in future development of small molecule PCSK9 inhibitors for intervention of hypercholesterolemia and associated cardiovascular disease.",

It was concluded that the test and the reference drug exhibited comparable values of pharmacokinetic parameters. It was also concluded that since there was no significant difference between the rate and extent of absorption of the drug from the test and the reference formulations: these two formulations could thus be declared bioequivalent.", 
    "95": "Reducing serum levels of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) is an important treatment objective in both the primary and secondary prevention settings. Although statin therapy remains the gold standard for reducing LDL-C, for a variety of reasons, many patients taking statins do not achieve adequate cholesterol lowering. This has created a need for new treatment approaches to manage dyslipidemia. One potential emerging treatment option to promote greater LDL-C reduction is the class of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) monoclonal antibodies, currently in phase 3 development. This study evaluated the impact of continuing medical education (CME) on increasing knowledge and awareness of the role of PCSK9 in lipid metabolism and analyzed persistent educational gaps to determine needs for future education. For cardiologists who participated in the CME activity, comparison of individually linked preassessment question responses to their respective postassessment question responses demonstrated improvement (n = 83; P < 0.05). Correct responses on postassessment questions ranged between 63% and 253% higher after CME, with an overall effect size of 0.72. Between 24% and 47% of learners showed improvement in understanding individual learning concepts. In the ever-evolving landscape of dyslipidemia management, CME demonstrably impacted knowledge of the PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies.",

It consists of 8 items classified into 3 categories as follows: (1) stroke prevention: antithrombotic use, statin use, glucose control, blood pressure control; (2) prevention of complications: deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis, temperature control; and (3) recovery and disposition: fluids and nutrition, mobility and therapy. The Stroke 8 checklist has been implemented in 3 formats over an 8-year period: laminated cards, an electronic documentation template, and an electronic template supplemented with clinical data autopopulated from the electronic health record.

This study aimed to determine whether atorvastatin, the most commonly used statin for lowering cholesterol, exerted beneficial pleiotropic effects via a similar mechanism. The mesenteric microcirculation of anaesthetised male Wistar rats (308\u2009\u00b1\u200963\u00a0g, n\u2009=\u200954) was prepared for fluorescent intravital microscopy.

LPS decreased mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) (4\u00a0h, control 113\u2009\u00b1\u200920\u00a0mmHg; LPS 70\u2009\u00b1\u200923\u00a0mmHg), being reversed by atorvastatin (105\u2009\u00b1\u20093\u00a0mmHg) (p\u2009<\u20090.05). LPS also increased macromolecular leak measured after 100\u00a0mg\u00a0kg(-1) of i.v FITC-BSA (arbitrary grey level adjacent to venules), which again was attenuated by atorvastatin (control 1.9\u2009\u00b1\u20094.0; LPS 12.0\u2009\u00b1\u20092.4; LPS + atorvastatin 4.5\u2009\u00b1\u20092.2) (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Furthermore, immunohistochemistry identified that atorvastatin decreased LPS-induced upregulation of endothelial cell NOSII expression, but NOSIII was unchanged in all groups. Atorvastatin improved MAP and reduced microvascular inflammation during endotoxaemia, associated with a reduction of pro-inflammatory NOSII. This differs from previous studies, whereby pravastatin increased expression of NOSIII. Thus preoperative statins have beneficial anti-inflammatory effects during endotoxaemia, but careful consideration must be given to the specific statin being used.",

HBV-infected individuals may also have an increased incidence of nonliver cancers. Taking statin or metformin may decrease inflammation and infiltration, which may, as a result, reduce the risk of liver cancer or other major cancers in patients with HBV infection. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the hypothesis that statin and metformin could reduce the incidence of liver cancer (HCC) or nonliver cancers in patients with HBV.Using the Taiwan Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000 to 2008, this cohort study comprised patients with a recorded diagnosis of HBV (N\u200a=\u200a71,847) between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2008. Each patient was followed-up until the end of 2008. The occurrence of HCC or a nonliver cancer was evaluated in patients who either were or were not taking statin or metformin. Cox proportional hazard regressions were used to evaluate the cancer incidence after adjusting for known confounding factors.In total, 71,824 HBV-infected patients comprised the study cohort. Our study showed that either metformin or statin use was associated with a reduction in the incidence of cancer. This was most prominent in patients taking both statin and metformin. The adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for patients using only statin were 0.52 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48-0.57) for all cancers, 0.28 (95% CI, 0.23-0.35) for liver cancer, and 0.63 (95% CI, 0.57-0.70) for nonliver cancers. Patients taking only metformin had risk-adjusted HRs of 0.82 (95% CI, 0.75-0.90) for all cancers, 0.97 (95% CI, 0.84-1.14) for liver cancer, and 0.75 (95% CI, 0.67-0.84) for nonliver cancers. A dose-dependent effect of statin use for chemoprevention was observed for all cancers, including both liver cancer and nonliver cancers. A dose-dependent effect of metformin was also seen in liver cancer and nonliver cancers without stratification into different cumulative daily doses of statin use.This population-based cohort study investigated the protective effect of statin and metformin against cancer events in patients with HBV infection. Our study demonstrated that either statin or metformin served as independent chemopreventive agents with a dose-response effect in reducing the incidence of cancer with a dose-response effect of the agents and an additive or synergistic effect of combining statin and metformin use in reducing the incidence of many cancers.",

Spinal cord and blood samples were obtained for histopathological and biochemical analyses.", 
    "153": "All of the rabbits in group II exhibited severe neurological deficits. Atorvastatin treatment (groups III and IV) significantly reduced the level of motor dysfunction. No significant differences were observed between the motor function scores of groups III and IV at the evaluated time points. Light microscopic examination of spinal cord tissue samples obtained at the 72nd hour of reperfusion indicated greater tissue preservation in groups III and IV than in group II.", 
    "154": "This study demonstrates the considerable neuroprotective effect of atorvastatin on the neurological, biochemical and histopathological status of rabbits with ischemia-induced spinal cord injury. Moreover, the acute withdrawal of atorvastatin therapy following the induction of spinal cord ischemia did not increase the neuronal damage in this rabbit model.", 
    "155": "Athough it is well known that apoptosis contributes to cancer cell death, the role of autophagy in cancer cell death has remained in dispute. Atorvastatin has been suggested to exhibit anti-cancer effects. The present study aimed to examine atorvastatin-induced autophagy-associated cell death and the autophagy\u2011associated gene expression profile in the PC3\u00a0prostate carcinoma cell line. The atorvastatin\u2011induced process of autophagy in PC3\u00a0cells was determined via evaluation of the cellular expression levels of autophagosomal marker light-chain-3 (LC3)\u2011II, using immunoblotting and counting of green fluorescent protein (GFP)\u2011LC3-transfected autophagic cells. Apoptosis was examined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay and an MTT assay was used to evaluate cell viability. Total RNA of PC3\u00a0cells was isolated for characterization of the gene expression profile following atorvastatin treatment. Atorvastatin treatment of PC3 cells for 24\u00a0h increased the expression of green fluorescent protein\u2011LC3\u2011II by >25%, and expression continued for >72\u00a0h, while apoptosis was not significantly induced within this time period. Four genes associated with the autophagy machinery were also significantly upregulated. In the presence of atorvastatin, autophagy may be unable to abrogate cell damage and may therefore contribute to cellular dysfunction, leading to autophagic/type\u00a0II programmed cell death. In response to atorvastatin treatment, the expression of genes involved in autophagic mediating pathways may have a role in tumor suppression.", 
    "156": "Serum carbamylated albumin (C-Alb) levels are associated with excess mortality in patients with diabetic end-stage renal disease. To gain insight into the pathophysiology of carbamylation, we determined associations between C-Alb and causes of death in patients on chronic hemodialysis. The Die Deutsche Diabetes Dialyse Studie (4D study) was a randomized controlled trial testing the effects of atorvastatin on survival in diabetic patients on dialysis during a median follow-up of 4 years. We stratified 1161 patients by C-Alb to see whether differences in carbamylation altered the effects of atorvastatin on survival. Baseline C-Alb significantly correlated with serum cardiac stress markers troponin T and N-terminal pro-B-type-natriuretic peptide and was associated with a history of heart failure and arrhythmia. C-Alb was strongly associated with 1-year adjusted risk of cardiovascular mortality, sudden cardiac death, and the 4-year risk of death from congestive heart failure (hazard ratios of 3.06, 3.78, and 4.64, respectively) but not with myocardial infarction or stroke. Patients with low C-Alb, treated with atorvastatin, experienced a significant improvement in their 4-year survival (hazard ratio 0.692). High C-Alb levels are associated with ongoing cardiac damage, risk of congestive heart failure, and sudden cardiac death. Thus, carbamylation and uremic cardiomyopathy are associated in patients with diabetes mellitus and kidney disease. In addition, statins were specifically beneficial to hemodialysis patients with low C-Alb.",

Current guidelines recommend an LDL-C target of <70 mg/dL (<1.8 mmol/L) for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients, and the first-line treatment to lower lipids is statin therapy. Despite current guidelines and the efficacious lipid-lowering agents available, about half of patients at very high risk, including ACS patients, fail to achieve their LDL-C goal. This study assessed LDL-C goal attainment according to use of high and low potency statins in routine practice in Thailand.",

Included were ACS patients treated with statins at baseline and with follow-up of LDL-C levels. Patients were divided into high or low potency statin users, and the proportion reaching the LDL-C goal of <70 mg/dL was determined. A Cox proportional hazard model was applied to determine the relationship between statin potency and LDL-C goal attainment. Propensity score adjustment was used to control for confounding by indication.",

A quarter reached their target LDL-C goal (25% for patients on high potency statins and 23% on low potency statins). High potency statins were not associated with increased LDL-C goal attainment (adjusted hazards ratio 1.22, 95% confidence interval 0.79-1.88; P=0.363).", 
    "161": "There was no significant effect of high potency statins on LDL-C goal attainment. Moreover, this study showed low LDL-C goal attainment for patients on either low or high potency statins. The reasons for the low LDL-C goal attainment rate warrants further investigation.", 
    "162": "The current study focuses on utilization of the natural biocompatible polymer zein to formulate simvastatin (SMV) nanoparticles coated with caseinate, to improve solubility and hence bioavailability, and in addition, to modify SMV-release characteristics. This formulation can be utilized for oral or possible depot parenteral applications. Fifteen formulations were prepared by liquid-liquid phase separation method, according to the Box-Behnken design, to optimize formulation variables. Sodium caseinate was used as an electrosteric stabilizer. The factors studied were: percentage of SMV in the SMV-zein mixture (X1), ethanol concentration (X2), and caseinate concentration (X3). The selected dependent variables were mean particle size (Y1), SMV encapsulation efficiency (Y2), and cumulative percentage of drug permeated after 1 hour (Y3). The diffusion of SMV from the prepared nanoparticles specified by the design was carried out using an automated Franz diffusion cell apparatus. The optimized SMV-zein formula was investigated for in vivo pharmacokinetic parameters compared with an oral SMV suspension. The optimized nanosized SMV-zein formula showed a 131 nm mean particle size and 89% encapsulation efficiency. In vitro permeation studies displayed delayed permeation characteristics, with about 42% and 85% of SMV cumulative amount released after 12 and 48 hours, respectively. Bioavailability estimation in rats revealed an augmentation in SMV bioavailability from the optimized SMV-zein formulation, by fourfold relative to SMV suspension. Formulation of caseinate-coated SMV-zein nanoparticles improves the pharmacokinetic profile and bioavailability of SMV. Accordingly, improved hypolipidemic activities for longer duration could be achieved. In addition, the reduced dosage rate of SMV-zein nanoparticles improves patient tolerability and compliance.", 
    "163": "Although statins have been shown to prevent contrast-induced acute kidney injury in patients with acute coronary syndromes, the benefit of statins is not known for patients at high risk for nephropathy who undergo elective coronary angiography. Two hundred twenty consecutive statin-naive patients with chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/min/1.73 m(2)) who underwent elective coronary or peripheral angiography were randomly assigned to receive rosuvastatin (40 mg on admission, followed by 20 mg/day; n = 110) or no statin treatment (control group, n = 110). Contrast-induced acute kidney injury was defined by an absolute increase in serum creatinine of \u22650.5 mg/dl or a relative increase of \u226525% measured 48 or 72 hours after the procedure. Contrast-induced acute kidney injury occurred in 15 patients (7.2%), 9 (8.5%) in the control group and 6 (5.8%) in the rosuvastatin group (p = 0.44). The incidences of adverse cardiovascular and renal events (death, dialysis, myocardial infarction, stroke, or persistent renal damage) were similar between the two groups at follow-up. In conclusion, rosuvastatin did not reduce the risk for contrast-induced acute kidney injury or other clinically relevant outcomes in at-risk patients who underwent coronary and peripheral vascular angiography.",

Preclinical data showed ASV inhibition of human OATP1B1 (IC50 = 0.3 \u03bcM), OATP2B1 (0.27 \u03bcM), and, to a lesser extent OATP1B3 (3.0 \u03bcM), confirmed by modest (<2-fold) clinical elevations in rosuvastatin exposure with concomitant ASV. Although no significant OATP transport of ASV was observed in vitro at standard micromolar assay concentrations, clinical coadministration of ASV with a single dose of the OATP inhibitor rifampin gave large, variable increases in ASV plasma Cmax (21-fold mean) and AUCinf (15-fold mean), consistent with reduced hepatic uptake. In vitro reevaluation at therapeutically relevant low-nanomolar concentrations of unbound ASV showed active, saturable human hepatocyte uptake (Km = 0.685 \u03bcM) and rifampin-reversible transport by OATP1B1 and OATP2B1, but not OATP1B3. At therapeutically relevant concentrations, ASV is therefore a sensitive substrate for, and weak inhibitor of, human OATP1B1, 1B3 and 2B1.",

In the present review, the most pertinent controversies in lipid management are discussed and the current evidence is summarized. Treatment with statins increases the risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) but this increase appears to be small and outweighed by the benefits of statins on cardiovascular disease prevention. Accordingly, statin treatment-associated T2DM should not affect management decisions. In patients who cannot achieve low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) targets despite treatment with the maximum tolerated dose of a potent statin, adding ezetimibe appears to be the treatment of choice. Finally, patients who achieved LDL-C targets with a statin but have elevated triglyceride levels appear to have increased cardiovascular risk and adding fenofibrate appears to reduce this risk. Even though additional large randomized controlled trials are unlikely to be performed with the existing lipid-lowering agents, mechanistic, genetic and epidemiological studies, as well as careful analyses of the existing trials will provide further insights in these controversial issues and will allow the optimization of the management of dyslipidemia aiming at further reductions in cardiovascular morbidity.",

It is well-known that statins have pleiotropic effects including improving endothelial function and inhibiting vascular inflammation and oxidation. However, the cellular responses to statins and corresponding pleiotropic effects are largely unknown at the proteome level. Emerging mass spectrometry-based proteomics provides a unique opportunity to systemically investigate protein and phosphoprotein abundance changes as a result of statin treatment. Many lipid-related protein abundances were increased in HepG2 cells treated by atorvastatin, including HMGCR, FDFT, SQLE, and LDLR, while the abundances of proteins involved in cellular response to stress and apoptosis were decreased. Comprehensive analysis of protein phosphorylation demonstrated that several basic motifs were enriched among down-regulated phosphorylation sites, which indicates that kinases with preference for these motifs, such as protein kinase A and protein kinase C, have attenuated activities. Phosphopeptides on a group of G-protein modulators were up-regulated, which strongly suggests that cell signal rewiring was a result of the effect of protein lipidation by the statin.

On the other hand, inter- and intra-subject variability values in saliva were higher than in plasma, leading to the need for a slightly higher number of subjects to be used in saliva studies. Non-invasive saliva sampling instead of the invasive plasma sampling method can be used as a surrogate for bioequivalence of SECS class III drugs when an adequate sample size is used.",

    "210": "The objective of our study was to determine the association between statin use and endometrial cancer survival in a nationally-representative elderly population with endometrial cancer in the U.S.", 
    "211": "We employed the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results registries and Medicare claims files to collect data from 2987 patients who were diagnosed with endometrial cancer between 2007 and 2009 and who received a hysterectomy. The association between statin use and overall survival was examined using Cox regression models adjusting for follow-up time, age, race, neighborhood income, cancer stage, tumor grade, hysterectomy type, chemotherapy, radiation, impaired glucose tolerance, obesity, dyslipidemia and diabetes.", 
    "212": "The mortality rate was lower in statin users compared to non-users for both type I (4.6 vs. 5.7 deaths/100 person-years, p=0.08) and type II (11.2 vs. 16.5 deaths/100 person-years, p=0.01) cancer types. However, after adjustment for the time from surgery to statin use and confounding, statin use after a hysterectomy was not significantly associated with a reduction in hazard of death for both type I (hazard ratio [HR] 0.92, 95%CI 0.70,1.2) and type II (HR=0.92, 95%CI 0.65, 1.29, p=0.62) endometrial cancer patients.", 
    "213": "Accounting for all confounders and biases considered, statin use on or after a hysterectomy was not associated with survival in those with type I or type II disease.", 
    "214": "Patients with coronary heart disease are recommended to use statins following hospital discharge. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a common complication of hospitalization, but the use of statins following discharge among patients who were not initially hospitalized for AMI has not been assessed adequately.", 
    "215": "Using the Medicare 5% national random sample, we determined statin use among beneficiaries who were hospitalized and who had a secondary discharge diagnosis of AMI and among beneficiaries who had a primary discharge diagnosis of AMI, coronary artery bypass grafting, or percutaneous coronary intervention in 2007-2009. Statin use was defined by a pharmacy (Medicare Part D) claim within 90 days following discharge. Of 8175 Medicare beneficiaries who did not take statins prior to hospitalization, 31.2% with AMI as a secondary discharge diagnosis, 60.5% with AMI as the primary discharge diagnosis, 67.6% with coronary artery bypass grafting, and 63.9% with a percutaneous coronary intervention initiated statins. After multivariable adjustment, the risk ratio for statin initiation comparing beneficiaries with a secondary versus primary discharge diagnosis of AMI was 0.59 (95% CI 0.54 to 0.65). Among 5468 Medicare beneficiaries taking statins prior to hospitalization, statin use following discharge was lower for those with AMI as a secondary discharge diagnosis (71.8%) compared with their counterparts with AMI, coronary artery bypass grafting, and percutaneous coronary intervention (84.1%, 83.8%, and 87.3%, respectively) as the primary discharge diagnosis.",

    "217": "Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have greater rates of cardiovascular mortality and RA is an independent cardiovascular risk factor. For the management of cholesterol, the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) developed new guidelines for the general population. None of the European or American guidelines are specific to RA. The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommends applying a coefficient to cardiovascular risk equations based on the characteristics of RA. Our objective was to compare the three different sets of guidelines for the eligibility of statin therapy in RA-specific population with very high risk of cardiovascular disease.", 
    "218": "We calculated the proportion of patients eligible for statins according to the guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), the Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP-III) and the ACC/AHA in a French cohort of statin-na\u00efve RA patients at least 40 years age. Of the 547 women and 130 men analyzed, statins would be recommended for 9.1% of the women and 26.4% of the men, 15.6% of the women and 53.1% of the men, 38.8% of the women and 78.5% of the men, according to the ESC, ATP-III and ACC/AHA guidelines respectively.", 
    "219": "In RA patients, as has been observed in the general population, discordance in risk assessment and cholesterol treatment was observed between the three sets of guidelines. The use of the new ACC/AHA guidelines would expand the eligibility for statins and may be applied to RA population a condition at very high risk of cardiovascular disease.", 
    "220": "Recent guidelines expand indications for statins. However, research on practical economic feasibility and cost-effectiveness in low-risk people is lacking. We aimed to describe the incidence of cardiovascular events (CVE), their total direct costs and the hypothetical effects of wide provision of statins on those rates and expenditures.", 
    "221": "We conducted a population-based cohort study using administrative data among low risk individuals. Estimators of effects of statins were taken from Cholesterol Treatment trialist metaanalysis and from Heart Protection Study trial. Two statin prices were used for analyses: National Italian Health System (\u20ac 0.36) and the International Drug Price Indicator (\u20ac 0.021).", 
    "222": "Overall, 920,067 persons at low risk were identified and 14,849 CVE were registered (incidence rate 27.3 per 10,000 person-years). Direct costs for hospitalizations for CVE were 143 M \u20ac. Universal provision of statins would result in a significant decrease in CVE rates, from 27.3 to 17.5 per 10,000 person-years (PY) (95% confidence interval (CI): 15.8-19.4). Universal prescription of simvastatin 20 mg would cost 802 M \u20ac. Otherwise, provision of simvastatin at International Drug Price Indicator's prices would be both clinically effective and cost saving in men older than age 44 (observed expenditures 120 M \u20ac, expected 97.4 M \u20ac) but not in women (observed expenditures 22.7 M \u20ac, expected 36.5 M \u20ac).",

PVS has a short elimination half-life (1-3 h), suffers from instability at gastric pH, extensive hepatic first-pass metabolism and low absolute bioavailability (18%). The current work aimed to develop enteric surface-coated spanlastic dispersions as controlled-release duodenum-triggered systems able to surmount PVS drawbacks. PVS-loaded spanlastic dispersions were prepared by ethanol-injection method using span(\u00ae) 60. Tween(\u00ae) 60 and Tween(\u00ae) 80 were explored as edge activators. As a novel approach, the fine spanlastic dispersions were surface-coated with an enteric-polymer (Eudragit(\u00ae) L100-55) via freeze-drying. The systems were evaluated, before and after enteric-coating, for particle size, zeta potential, PVS entrapment efficiency (EE%), morphology and PVS release studies. PVS pharmacokinetics from the best achieved system and an aqueous solution were estimated in rats by UPLC-MS/MS. The best achieved enteric surface-coated spanlastic dispersion (E-S6) displayed spherical nanosized vesicles (647.60 nm) possessing negative zeta potential (-6.93 mV), promising EE% (63.22%) and a biphasic drug-release pattern characterized by a retarded-release phase (0.1 N HCl, 2 h) and a controlled-release phase (pH 6.8, 10 h). The higher Cmax, delayed Tmax, prolonged MRT(0-\u221e), longer elimination t50% and enhanced oral bioavailability unravel E-S6 potential for oral PVS delivery.", 
    "225": "Treating cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, including dyslipidemia, is important in HIV care. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) target achievement is a readily available benchmark for dyslipidemia control, although use of this target is not uniformly endorsed by professional societies. We examined whether HIV serostatus is associated with not achieving LDL-c target. Among Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) participants completing visit 56 (10/1/2011-3/31/2012), we categorized each man as on or off statin therapy and used NCEP ATP III guidelines to determine if each man was at LDL-c target or not at target. We compared proportions of men not at target and determined predictors using multivariate logistic regression. Sixty of 543 (11.1%) HIV-infected men and 87 of 585 (14.9%) HIV-uninfected men not receiving statin therapy were not at target (p=0.07), while 31 of 230 (13.5%) HIV-infected and 29 of 204 (14.2%) HIV-uninfected men receiving statin therapy were not at target (p=0.82). Factors associated with not being at target (among men not receiving statin therapy) included current smoking (OR=2.31, 95% CI 1.31, 4.06) and a diagnosis of hypertension (OR=4.69, 95% CI 2.68, 8.21). Factors associated with not being at target (among men receiving statin therapy) included current smoking (OR=2.72, 95% CI 1.30, 5.67) and diabetes (OR=5.31, 95% CI 2.47, 11.42). HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected men receiving statin therapy demonstrated similar nonachievement of LDL-c targets. Comorbidities (e.g., diabetes) lowered targets and may explain why goals were less likely to be met.", 
    "226": "An analysis of high-sensitive factor I and C-reactive proteins as biomarkers for coronary artery disease has been performed from 19 anticipated cohort studies that included 21,567 participants having no information about coronary artery disease. Besides, the clinical implications of statin therapy initiated due to assessment of factor I and C-reactive proteins have also been modeled during studies. The measure of risk discrimination (C-index) was increased (by 0.0101) as per the prognostic model for coronary artery disease with respect to sex, smoking status, age, blood pressure, total cholesterol level along with diabetic history characteristic parameters. The C-index was further raised by 0.0045 and 0.0053 when factor I and C-reactive proteins based information were added, respectively which finally predicted 10-year risk categories as: high (> 20%), medium (10% to < 20%), and low (< 10%) risks. We found 2,254 persons (among 15,000 adults (age \u2265 45 years)) would initially be classified as being at medium risk for coronary artery disease when only conventional risk factors were used as calculated risk. Besides, persons with a predicted risk of more than 20% as well as for persons suffering from other risk factors (i.e. diabetes), statin therapy was initiated (irrespective of their decade old predicted risk). We conclude that under current treatment guidelines assessment of factor I and C-reactive proteins levels (as biomarker) in people at medium risk for coronary artery disease could prevent one additional coronary artery disease risk over a period a decade for every 390-500 people screened.", 
    "227": "Mutations in the Mevalonate Kinase gene (MVK) are causes of a rare autoinflammatory disease: Mevalonate Kinase Deficiency and its more acute manifestation, Mevalonic Aciduria. The latter is characterized, among other features, by neuroinflammation, developmental delay and ataxia, due to failed cerebellar development or neuronal death through chronic inflammation. Pathogenesis of neuroinflammation in Mevalonate Kinase Deficiency and Mevalonic Aciduria has not yet been completely clarified, however different research groups have been suggesting the inflammasome complex as the key factor in the disease development. A strategy to mimic this disease is blocking the mevalonate pathway, using HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (Statins), while knock-out mice for Mevalonate Kinase are non-vital and their hemyzygous (i.e only one copy of gene preserved) littermate display almost no pathological features.", 
    "228": "We sought to generate a murine cellular model closely resembling the pathogenic conditions found in vivo, by direct silencing of Mevalonate Kinase gene. Knockdown of Mevalonate Kinase in a murine microglial cellular model (BV-2 cells) results in neither augmented NALP3 expression nor increase of apoptosis. On the contrary, statin treatment of BV-2 cells produces an increase both in Mevalonate Kinase and NALP3 expression.", 
    "229": "MKD deficiency could be due or affected by protein accumulation leading to NALP3 activation, opening novel questions about strategies to tackle this disease.", 
    "230": "Preventive care, referring to medical interventions with anticipated long-term benefits, is often inappropriately continued near the end of life. We examined the use of statin medications in patients with brain metastases receiving whole brain radiation therapy to determine the effect of short life expectancy and regular interaction with oncology providers on statin discontinuation. We propose reasons for the unnecessary continuation of preventive care and suggest that it is a frequently missed communication opportunity to discuss prognosis in a concrete manner.", 
    "231": "This is a retrospective study examining statin use in patients receiving whole brain radiotherapy for brain metastases. A total of 206 patients at two cancer centers were studied, and information on statin use and clinical characteristics was obtained from review of the medical record.", 
    "232": "Of the 206 patients, 53 (26 %) were on a statin at their initial radiation oncology consultation. Of these patients, 13 (25 %) had their statin discontinued by the time of their last follow-up visit, but 40 patients (75 %) were continued on their statin despite their limited life expectancy and low likelihood of benefit.", 
    "233": "The majority of patients who were on statins prior to starting palliative whole brain radiation therapy remained on a statin after completing treatment despite an estimated survival of months and regular visits with an oncologist. This represents a missed opportunity for doctors and patients to discuss the appropriateness of continuing preventive care as part of an important conversation about prognosis.", 
    "234": "Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in developed countries. The management of blood cholesterol with the use of statin drugs in at-risk patients is a pillar of medical therapy for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Although the standard lipid panel is adequate to accurately assess cardiovascular disease risk in most patients, there are some situations in which conventional cholesterol testing does not fully identify cardiovascular risk or reflect disease progression. A number of advanced lipid tests can assist the clinician when assessing a patient's cardiovascular disease risk, including measurement of low-density lipoprotein particle number.", 
    "235": "Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the leading cause of death and disability in developed nations, and it is rising rapidly in other parts of the developing world. Levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) are directly correlated with atherogenic risk, and statin-based therapy is the most common management for these patients. However, many patients exhibit resistance to and/or adverse effects from statin therapy, and there is a need for adjunctive therapies or statin alternatives for these patients. The recently discovered human protein proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) plays an important role in LDL-C metabolism. PCSK9 promotes LDL receptor (LDL-R) degradation with a consequent reduction in LDL-R density and an increase in LDL-C levels. Consequently, PCSK9 inhibition to reduce LDL-C levels has become a primary focus for drug development. Numerous clinical trials focusing on monoclonal antibodies against PCSK9 have demonstrated efficacy equal to or greater than statin therapy for lowering LDL-C levels. Long-term trials are underway to assess safety, tolerability, and ability to reduce ASCVD."
