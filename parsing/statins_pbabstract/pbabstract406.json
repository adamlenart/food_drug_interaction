    "0": "A comparative trial was carried out on the effect on lipid metabolism of two drugs which inhibit the enzyme systems involved in cholesterol synthesis: tiadenol and simvastatin. The trial was performed in 40 patients with non familial and non secondary hypercholesterolemia. Subjects were divided into two groups of 20 patients each, one to be treated with tiadenol, the other with simvastatin. During the study period all patients followed a dietary regime of about 1500 cal daily. Thirty days before the trial, patients were given a placebo daily, and this was followed by thirty days with the drugs studied. Prior to the placebo period and at the end of the experimental period, blood was drawn for the assessment of total cholesterol, esterified cholesterol, VLDL-, LDL- and HDL-cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, phospholipids, and triglycerides. Both drugs were found to induce significant reductions of total cholesterol, VLDL, and LDL, a relative increase of HDL, and reduction of apolipoprotein B. Triglyceride blood level was markedly reduced in tiadenol-treated subjects, and to a lesser extent also in simvastatin-treated ones. This difference is attributed to the different levels at which the drugs interfere with the early steps of cholesterol synthesis. The authors conclude by pointing out that the two drugs should be used selectively according to the type of metabolic disorder prevalent in the individual patient.", 
    "1": "Cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase, the cytochrome P-450-dependent and rate-controlling enzyme of bile acid synthesis, was purified from rat and human liver microsomes. The purified fractions were assayed in a reconstituted system containing [4-14C]cholesterol, and cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activities in these fractions increased 500-600-fold relative to whole microsomes. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of rat microsomes followed by immunoblotting with polyclonal rabbit antisera raised against purified cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylases revealed two peaks at molecular masses of 47,000 and 49,000 daltons for both rat and human fractions. Increasing amounts of rabbit anti-rat and anti-human antibodies progressively inhibited rat microsomal cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity up to 80%. In contrast, monospecific antibodies raised against other purified cytochrome P-450 enzymes (P-450f, P-450g, and P-450j) did not inhibit rat or human cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity. Immunoblots of rat microsomes with the rabbit anti-rat cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase antibody demonstrated that the antibody reacted quantitatively with the rat microsomal enzyme. Microsomes from cholesterol-fed rats showed increased cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase mass, whereas treatment with pravastatin, an inhibitor of hydroxy-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, reduced enzyme mass. Microsomes from starved rats contained slightly less cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase protein than chow-fed control rats. These results indicate a similarity in molecular mass, structure, and antigenicity between rat and human cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylases; demonstrate the production of inhibiting anti-cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase antibodies that can be used to measure the change in cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase enzyme mass under various conditions; and emphasize the unique structure of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase with respect to other cytochrome P-450-dependent hydroxylases.", 
    "2": "Twenty elderly (mean age, 69 years), hypercholesterolemic patients (low-density lipoprotein [LDL] levels greater than or equal to 160 mg/dl) were supplied a lipid-lowering diet for one month and then received 10 mg of simvastatin daily for 12 months. Total cholesterol levels fell significantly, from 304.6 mg/dl at baseline to 277.4 mg/dl after one month on the diet, to 245.9 mg/dl after one month of simvastatin, and to 216.1 mg/dl after two months of simvastatin; total cholesterol levels remained significantly lower (221.6 mg/dl at month 12). LDL levels decreased significantly, from 217.6 mg/dl at baseline to 130.4 mg/dl at month 12. High-density lipoprotein levels increased significantly only at months 2 and 3. Apolipoprotein (apo) A levels increased significantly, from 147.2 mg/dl at baseline to 217.9 mg/dl at month 12. There were no significant changes in triglyceride or apo B levels. No changes in blood pressure, heart rate, or body weight or in results of laboratory tests were noted. Few side effects were reported. It is concluded that simvastatin is safe and effective in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia in elderly patients.", 
    "3": "The kinetics of oxidation of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors lovastatin, simvastatin, L-157,012, and L-647,318 were studied in an aqueous surfactant solution. A thermally labile free radical initiator was used to attain measurable reaction rates at 40 degrees C and rate constants were determined by measuring oxygen consumption using an oxygen electrode. The stability of the drugs was found to increase in the order lovastatin = simvastatin less than L-157,012 less than L-647,318. The addition of butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) was found to stabilize the drugs. For the oxidation of lovastatin, the effectiveness of antioxidants increased in the order propyl gallate less than BHA less than alpha-tocopherol. It is concluded that the stability of oxidizable drugs can be rapidly and conveniently assessed by the techniques described herein.", 
    "4": "Mortality from coronary artery disease is a common problem in treated hypertensive patients, and these people have a high prevalence of elevated cholesterol levels. A study was undertaken to determine whether cholesterol could be lowered effectively without major side effects in patients with treated hypertension. Forty-nine patients (mean age 67.6 years) with cholesterol greater than 5.5 mmol/l were placed on a reduced-fat (less than 30% of calories from fat with a ratio of polyunsaturated to saturated fats of less than 1) diet for 3 months. If the cholesterol was between 5.5 and 7.5 mmol/l and total cholesterol divided by high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was greater than 4.5, the patients were randomly allocated either to the simvastatin (24 patients) or the placebo group (25 patients). Diet and placebo caused minor and insignificant falls in cholesterol and no change in triglycerides or lipids. Treatment with simvastatin reduced cholesterol levels from 6.85 to 4.75 mmol/l (P less than 0.001), triglycerides from 2.7 to 2.1 mmol/l (P less than 0.01), low-density lipoproteins from 4.6 to 2.6 mmol/l (P less than 0.001) and high-density lipoproteins rose from 1.09 to 1.18 mmol/l (P less than 0.01). Total cholesterol divided by high-density lipoprotein cholesterol fell from 6.3 to 4.0 (P less than 0.001). The drug was well tolerated and the side-effect profile did not differ from the placebo in clinical or biochemical events. The active drug was stopped in one patient (abdominal pain, dizziness, headache, tiredness) and in two patients taking the placebo (elevated creatine phosphokinase, cardiovascular collapse). Simvastatin effectively lowered total cholesterol and improved the lipoprotein profile. The dose required in most patients was 40 mg/day. Simvastatin may be an acceptable drug to improve the lipoprotein profile in order to determine whether this improves the prognosis in patients treated for hypertension.", 
    "5": "The present study was undertaken to define the effects of lipoprotein-derived cholesterol and endogenous, de novo synthesized cholesterol on the ultrastructure and function of undifferentiated rat adrenocortical cells [lipoprotein (HDL3 and LDL) receptor-negative, zona glomerulosa-like adrenocortical cells] in primary culture. For this purpose human plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL3) or low density lipoprotein (LDL) was added to culture medium devoid of cholesterol. Steroid secretion remained at the low basal level even after addition of lipoproteins, and the amount of intracellular lipid droplets did not increase. When mevinolin (0.96 microgram/ml), an inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis, was added to the culture medium, a low secretion of corticosterone was measured both in serum-free and serum-containing media. Ultrastructurally, lipid droplets disappeared after treatment with mevinolin in both media used. At this concentration of mevinolin cell proliferation was similar to that in the controls, but at higher concentrations (4.8 or 9.6 micrograms/ml) proliferation was inhibited to 42% and 26% in serum-free medium, and 20% and 12% in serum-supplemented medium, respectively. This study demonstrates that cell proliferation and synthesis of corticosterone by undifferentiated rat adrenocortical cells is identical in the absence or presence of exogenous lipoprotein cholesterol. Inhibition of de novo cholesterol synthesis by mevinolin over a period of 7 days does not inhibit corticosterone secretion or proliferation of cells but decreases the amount of intracellular lipid droplets, thus suggesting utilization of intracellular cholesterol esters. However, higher concentrations of mevinolin inhibit proliferation of cells both in serum-free and serum-containing media.", 
    "6": "We examined the relationship between cholesterol synthesis and high affinity low density lipoprotein (LDL) catabolism in freshly isolated mononuclear leukocytes and plasma sterols and apolipoprotein concentrations in three homozygous and one heterozygous subject with sitosterolemia with xanthomatosis and in 12 control subjects. Observations in untreated subjects were compared during therapy with lovastatin or interruption of the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids. Plasma cholesterol, plant sterol, and apolipoprotein B concentrations declined more than 50% in the two homozygous sitosterolemic subjects after ileal bypass surgery. In contrast, plasma cholesterol, plant sterol, and apolipoprotein B concentrations remained constant in a homozygous sitosterolemic subject and declined only 7% in a heterozygous sitosterolemic subject during 20 weeks of lovastatin (40 mg/day) treatment compared to a 28% decrease in similarly treated control subjects. Lovastatin treatment decreased cholesterol synthesis more than 60% but did not increase high affinity catabolism of LDL further in the sitosterolemic cells, compared to a more than 20% rise in control mononuclear leukocytes. Conversely, bile acid malabsorption increased cholesterol synthesis 59%, total hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity 13%, and receptor-mediated LDL degradation 41% in control cells, but did not stimulate cholesterol synthesis or microsomal HMG-CoA reductase activity in sitosterolemic mononuclear leukocytes although receptor-mediated LDL catabolism rose an additional 26%. These results demonstrate a greater than expected decrease in plasma sterols and apolipoprotein B concentrations in sitosterolemic subjects after stimulation of bile acid synthesis because of the inability to up-regulate cholesterol production. We suggest that bile acid-sequestering drugs or ileal exclusion surgery may be more effective treatments to mobilize accumulated sterol deposits and prevent atherosclerosis in this disease.", 
    "7": "This study was designed to test the hypothesis that in patients with elevated plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) apolipoprotein-apoB, chylomicron remnant clearance can be modulated by therapy with a hepatic hydroxymethyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor. Accordingly, chylomicron triglyceride and remnant clearance were determined following a vitamin-A fat load in 12 such patients, before and after therapy with Lovastatin (Merck, Sharp & Dohme, Rahway, NJ). Such therapy had no significant overall effect on plasma triglyceride clearance, although there was a trend to lower levels of Sf greater than 400 triglycerides at the later time points. By contrast, retinol clearance in plasma and Sf greater than 400 lipoproteins was markedly increased (30% and 40%, respectively). The data indicate, therefore, that following therapy with Lovastatin in this group of patients, chylomicron plasma remnant clearance was significantly enhanced. The exact mechanisms responsible remain to be explicated.", 
    "8": "A therapeutic strategy is presented which combines the use of HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA) reductase inhibitors with extracorporeal HELP-apheresis for the simultaneous elimination of LDL and plasma fibrinogen to ideal plasma concentrations. With HELP-treatment alone LDL (low density lipoprotein)-cholesterol and fibrinogen could be reduced to approx. 50-60% of original plasma levels; medication with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors alone caused a LDL-cholesterol decrease by a mean of 40% from the untreated values. A combination of both methods led to a reduction in the LDL-cholesterol values of 70-80%. The high efficacy and safety of this combined treatment in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) offers the possibility to normalize even markedly severe heterozygous hypercholesterolemia with plasma-LDL concentrations of about 450 mg/dl to ideal LDL-levels of below 120 mg/dl. This therapeutic strategy may be useful in the secondary prevention of CAD in patients with and without familial hypercholesterolemia if plasma cholesterol cannot be reduced by diet and drug treatment to a sufficient extent. Presumably one to two years of treatment will be required to retard the CAD and could initiate a regression of coronary sclerosis.", 
    "9": "Lovastatin (mevinolin) caused a strong and dose-dependent inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in six types of cultured human cells. Fifty percent inhibition of cholesterol synthesis in human enterocytes was observed at a lovastatin concentration of about 0.004 ng/ml and in other cells at a lovastatin concentration of about 0.03 ng/ml. At lovastatin concentrations between 1.0 and 100.0 ng/ml, a moderate tissue selectivity of lovastatin action was noted. At optimal concentrations, lovastatin inhibited cholesterol synthesis in hepatocytes by 98%, in normal and LDL-receptor negative fibroblasts, arterial smooth muscle cells and hepatoma G-2 cells by about 90%, and in enterocytes by 75%. In rat enterocytes lovastatin inhibited cholesterol synthesis by only 60%.", 
    "10": "Pravastatin, a novel inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, was administered to nine hypercholesterolemic patients with diabetes mellitus to examine its effects on diabetic nephropathy. Pravastatin treatment resulted in lowering serum total cholesterol by 22.1% on the average (p less than 0.001), and led to a significant reduction in urinary excretion of albumin and beta 2-microglobulin in patients with an elevated urinary protein excretion rate at the baseline period. But glycemic control, blood pressure, urinary excretion of creatinine and that of N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase showed no significant change during the study. These results suggest that reduction of atherogenic lipids and lipoproteins with pravastatin could alleviate diabetic glomerular injury.", 
    "11": "Nine patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia were treated for eight weeks with either 40 mg pravastatin or placebo under double blind conditions. Six patients received pravastatin, a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. Treatment with pravastatin resulted in a significant decrease in plasma cholesterol caused by a decrease in low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) of 30% (p less than 0.005). We determined the effect of this medication on the lithogenicity of bile. Cholesterol saturation index of fasting gall bladder bile decreased with 23% (p less than 0.01) from 1.06 to 0.75 during treatment with pravastatin. A reduction of 24% (p less than 0.01) in molar percentage of biliary cholesterol was seen. After treatment the total bile acid excretion in faeces and the molar percentage of biliary bile acids were not significantly changed, suggesting that pravastatin does not influence bile acid biosynthesis to a significant extent. These findings indicate that treatment with pravastatin can decrease the incidence and complications of cholesterol gall stones.", 
    "12": "This study compares the effects of cholestyramine (16 g/d) and pravastatin (40 mg/d) on lipoprotein particles defined by their apolipoprotein composition (Lp A-I, Lp A-II:A-I, Lp E:B, and Lp C-III:B). Analysis was performed after 4, 8, and 12 weeks of therapy. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol decreased by 25.1% to 35.0% with cholestyramine and 26.2% to 30.7% with pravastatin, while triglycerides decreased slightly with pravastatin therapy and increased slightly during cholestyramine administration. The fall in cholesterol was mainly due to a decrease in very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and LDL cholesterol; high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol increased. Apolipoprotein B was reduced dramatically (by 21.7% to 30.5% with cholestyramine and 27.7% to 37.4% with pravastatin). No significant effect on apolipoproteins C-III and E was observed with cholestyramine, while pravastatin reduced these parameters slightly. Apolipoprotein A-I increased during therapy with both drugs, while apolipoprotein A-II was slightly decreased. Although the drugs had nearly the same effects on plasma lipids, their influence on lipoprotein particles defined by their apolipoprotein composition was substantially different. Lp A-II:A-I was increased by both drugs (+8.1% to +41.2% for cholestyramine and +7.2% to +32.6% for pravastatin). Lp A-I was also increased with both drugs, but cholestyramine had a more constant and pronounced effect than pravastatin (+15.1% to +21.7% for cholestyramine and +1.7% to +13.0% for pravastatin). Lp E:B and Lp C-III:B were consistently decreased by pravastatin (-10.2% to -36.5% for LP E:B and -7.2% to -20.9% for Lp C-III:B), while cholestyramine had variable effects on these particles.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "13": "Metabolism of lovastatin, a new cholesterol-lowering drug, by liver microsomes from rats and mice was investigated. Liver microsomes from rats catalyzed biotransformation of lovastatin at a rate of 3 nmol/mg of protein/min, whereas the rate of metabolism was 37% higher with liver microsomes from mice. The profiles of metabolites were similar, but the relative abundance of individual metabolites was species dependent. Hydroxylation at the 6'-position was the principal pathway of lovastatin biotransformation, whereas hydroxylation at the 3\"-position of the side chain was a minor pathway. In both species the 6'-beta-hydroxy-lovastatin accounted for half of the total metabolism. Liver microsomes from rats produced 2- to 4-fold higher amounts of the other three metabolites, namely, 6'-exomethylene-, 3\"-hydroxy-, and the hydroxy acid form, than mouse liver microsomes. The conversion of lovastatin to the novel 6'-exomethylene metabolite was catalyzed by cytochrome P-450 since it required microsomes and NADPH and was inhibited by SKF-525A, metyrapone, and 2,4,-dichloro-6-phenylphenoxyethylamine (DPEA). Furthermore, neither 6'-beta-hydroxy-lovastatin nor the 6'-hydroxymethyl analogs could be demonstrated to be intermediates in the formation of the 6'-exomethylene metabolite. The hydroxy acid form of lovastatin was not a substrate for liver microsomes from either species.", 
    "14": "Structures of in vitro microsomal and in vivo metabolites of lovastatin, a new cholesterol-lowering drug, were elucidated with the combined application of HPLC, UV, fast atom bombardment-MS, and NMR spectroscopy. Liver microsomes from rats and mice catalyzed the biotransformation of lovastatin, primarily at the 6'-position of the molecule, to form 6'-hydroxy-lovastatin and a novel 6'-exomethylene derivative. Hydroxylation at the 6'-position occurred stereoselectively, giving 6'-beta-hydroxy-lovastatin. Stereoselective hydroxylation at the 3\"-position of the methylbutyryl side chain and hydrolysis of the lactone group to the corresponding hydroxy acid were the other two pathways of microsomal metabolism. 3'-Hydroxy-iso-delta 4',5'-lovastatin was isolated, but is not believed to be a direct metabolite since 6'-beta-hydroxy-lovastatin rearranges to this compound under mildly acidic conditions. The major metabolites excreted in bile of rats treated with the hydroxy acid form of the drug were identified as the 3'-hydroxy analog and a taurine conjugate of a beta-oxidation product of lovastatin. The pentanoic acid derivative of lovastatin, formed by beta-oxidation of the heptanoic acid moiety, was a major metabolite in livers of mice dosed with the hydroxy acid form of lovastatin. The microsomal metabolites, in their hydroxy acid forms, were active inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase. The relative enzyme inhibitory activities of hydroxy acid forms of lovastatin, 6'-beta-hydroxy-, 6'-exomethylene-, and 3\"-hydroxy-lovastatin were 1, 0.6, 0.5, and 0.15, respectively.", 
    "15": "The biosynthesis of cholesterol is mainly regulated by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. Because the liver is the major site of cholesterol synthesis, it is the primary target of the class of drugs known as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Simvastatin (SV) is a lactone prodrug which undergoes reversible metabolism. In the hydroxy acid form (SVA) it is a potent inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase. SV is well absorbed by rats, dogs, and humans. After an oral dose of SV, tissue distribution studies were consistent with high hepatic extraction of SV and relatively poor tissue penetration of SVA. The majority of a radioactive dose of SV is eliminated in bile. A high portal/systemic gradient for 6'-OH-SVA, an active biliary metabolite, suggests its probable reentry and indicates potential for prolongation of HMG-CoA reductase inhibition. AUC comparisons in dogs after simultaneous iv (3H) and intraportal (14C) infusions indicate that hepatic extraction is high with only 8% of SV reaching the systemic circulation unchanged. Approximately 98% and 96% of SV was bound to human and dog plasma protein, respectively. The physiological disposition of SV in dog appears to be a suitable paradigm for man. Because of its high hepatic extraction SV should be both specific and selective with respect to the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase.", 
    "16": "This is a report of an infant with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA-lyase deficiency. During infancy vomiting and feeding difficulties had been found repeatedly. Nutrition consisted in a mixture of one third of milk diluted with two thirds of water. Shortly before admission a change to whole milk had taken place. The one year old girl was admitted to the hospital because of vomiting and diarrhoea. Liver was enlarged and consciousness reduced. There was acidosis, hypoglycemia and an elevation of the transaminases. The typical pattern of organic acids in urine and dicarboxylic aciduria was pathognomonic. The diagnosis was proved by a deficiency of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA-lyase in fibroblasts. A protein and fat restricted diet, but also carnitine supplement was introduced. With the exception of severe hypoglycemia seizures on one morning the more than 2 1/2 year old girl is developed normally. It is of importance for future to avoid hypoglycemia after fasting, infections diseases or stress. The possible impairment of pancreatic function even in a normal clinical condition with normal values of transaminases is especially pointed out.", 
    "17": "As many as 10% of middle-aged men in the United States may have asymptomatic but active coronary artery disease. Additional patients have silent disease after a myocardial infarction or a combination of silent ischemia and angina. Silent and painful episodes have similar hemodynamic and electrical properties, and antianginal medications appear to have global anti-ischemic effects.", 
    "18": "The preventive effects of simvastatin (MK-733) and pravastatin (CS-514), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarylcoenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, on hypercholesterolemia induced by 0.25% cholesterol feeding were compared in rabbits. MK-733 (6, 2 and 0.7 mg/kg) was found to prevent the increase in serum total cholesterol levels dose-dependently. High dose CS-514 (18 mg/kg) also limited the increase in the cholesterol levels, but medium (6 mg/kg) and low doses (2 mg/kg) of CS-514 were ineffective in preventing it. MK-733 inhibited the increase in VLDL and LDL cholesterol levels dose-dependently. MK-733 suppressed the increase in serum phospholipid levels. MK-733 inhibited the accumulation of cholesterol in the liver. The high dose of CS-514 also limited it. High dose MK-733 (6 mg/kg) reduced the cholesterol concentration in gallbladder bile. Neither MK-733 nor CS-514 affected bile acid excretion in the gallbladder bile. High dose MK-733 decreased the lithogenic index. MK-733 increased the number of LDL receptors, and high dose CS-514 also increased it. The suppressive effect of CS-514 on serum cholesterol levels at 18 mg/kg was found to be less than that of MK-733 at 0.7 mg/kg.", 
    "19": "The relationship between cholesterol synthesis and uptake in proliferating lymphocytes has been examined. [14C]Acetate incorporation into lymphocytes cultured under lipoprotein-deficient conditions increased initially in response to mitogen, decreased after 24 h, and increased rapidly between 72 and 96 h. Addition of LDL (10 micrograms/ml) to the culture during the 'trough' period caused [14C]acetate incorporation to return rapidly to baseline, while at peak periods LDL suppression of cholesterol synthesis was minimal. Lymphocytes cultured in the presence of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, mevinolin, exhibited a time-dependent increase in their capacity to incorporate [14C]acetate into cholesterol, evident when mevinolin was removed by washing prior to assay. PHA enhanced 125I-labelled LDL receptor-mediated binding by lymphocytes cultured in lipoprotein-deficient medium over a 4 day period and mevinolin augmented the effect. [3H]Thymidine incorporation into mitogen-stimulated lipoprotein-deficient cultures was inhibited up to 75% by mevinolin (1 mumol/l). LDL (2.5-10 micrograms/ml) substantially reversed this inhibition in 72 h cultures, but only partially overcame inhibition in cells cultured for 96 h. Results suggest that endogenous cholesterol synthesis may be obligatory for lymphocyte proliferation after the initial round of cell division.", 
    "20": "We have studied the effects of lovastatin, an inhibitor of hydroxy-methylglutaryl-CoA-reductase, on cultures of Trypanosoma cruzi epimastigotes. It inhibits growth at 10 and 30 micrograms per ml; these effects are reverted by 100 microM of squalene, but not by 100 microM of cholesterol. Lovastatin at the same amounts inhibits [14C]acetate incorporatin into sterols, isolated either by digitonin precipitation or thin layer chromatography. At 50 micrograms per ml it kills most of the trypanosomes. These concentrations are below reported toxic levels for mammals; this drug and its analogs should, therefore, be tested as chemotherapeutic agents against Chagas' disease.", 
    "21": "Biotransformation of three analogs of simvastatin, L-672,201, L-157,012 and L-672,220, by rat liver microsomes has been examined. These compounds differ from each other at the 6' position of the hexahydronaphthalene system. When 6'-substituents were in the alpha configuration, rat liver microsomes catalysed biotransformation primarily at the 6' position. Hydroxylation was stereoselective giving 6' beta-hydroxy derivatives as major metabolites. In contrast, when the 6'-substituent had a beta-configuration, metabolism at this site was blocked. Rates of metabolism (nmols/mg protein/min) also indicated that 6' beta-derivatives were poorer substrates than their 6' alpha-counterparts. The results indicate that cytochrome P-450 exhibits a high degree of regio- and stereoselectivity in the metabolism of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.", 
    "22": "The efficacy of simvastatin therapy for hypercholesterolaemia was evaluated in 26 patients with coronary heart disease, 20 of whom had undergone coronary artery bypass grafting. Simvastatin reduced total- and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol from 8.3 to 5.1 (38%) and 6.3 to 3.3 mmol/L (48%) respectively, p less than 0.001; high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol increased from 1.19 to 1.24 mmol/L, p = NS. The changes in apoproteins A1 and B paralleled those of HDL- and LDL-cholesterol. There were no clinically important adverse effects. We conclude that simvastatin is effective lipid lowering therapy and can be used safely, in the short term, in patients with coronary heart disease.", 
    "23": "4-Aminopyrazolopyrimidine (4-APP) treatments to rats for 3 days induced 2-fold increase of circulating ACTH and 11-fold increase of adrenal 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase mRNA compared to NaCl-treated controls. This in vivo model was used to study the effect of the suppression of ACTH secretion on the adrenal HMG-CoA reductase mRNA level. Dexamethasone (Dex) administration to 4-APP-treated rats caused a rapid and parallel decline of the levels of plasma ACTH and adrenal HMG-CoA reductase mRNA to 50% within 2.5 h, whereas the free and esterified cholesterol content was increased 5 and 9.4 times respectively. These changes could be counteracted by the co-administration of ACTH with Dex. Aminoglutethimide (AG) administration to 4-APP-treated rats, which increased the adrenal esterified cholesterol content (7.5 times), decreased the HMG-CoA reductase mRNA level (44%), despite plasma ACTH level remaining elevated. Moreover, the participation of newly synthesized protein(s) in the lowering of adrenal HMG-CoA reductase mRNA level induced by ACTH suppression is suggested by the fact that cycloheximide (Cyclo), when co-administered with AG, completely blocked the decrease of HMG-CoA reductase mRNA level, despite the plasma ACTH level decreasing by 68% and the free and esterified cholesterol content increasing 3.9 and 12.3 times, compared to 4-APP-treated rats. Furthermore, the specificity of these effects was established by the fact that the beta-actin mRNA level was not affected by the administration of either Dex, AG, Cyclo, or AG + Cyclo to 4-APP-treated rats.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "24": "We have studied the effect of simvastatin, an inhibitor of the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, alone and in combination with cholestyramine in 48 patients. Simvastatin 40 mg decreased total serum cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B by 35%, 40% and 35%, respectively, while HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I increased by 10% (p less than 0.01) and 7% (p less than 0.05), respectively. The addition of 8 g cholestyramine caused a further decrease in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol to a total of 42% and 49%, respectively. Eighteen of the 48 patients have now been under combined treatment for 2 years. The initial high decreases in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were stabilized for the whole period. Some patients developed gastrointestinal complaints, which made necessary a reduction of simvastatin in two cases. Biochemical side effects (e.g. increases in CK and transaminases) were not observed.", 
    "25": "Mevalonate kinase may play a key role in regulating cholesterol biosynthesis because its activity may be regulated via feedback inhibition by intermediates in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. To study the regulation of mevalonate kinase, the enzyme was purified to homogeneity from rat liver, and monospecific antibody against mevalonate kinase was prepared. The purified mevalonate kinase had a dimeric structure composed of identical subunits, and the Mr of the enzyme determined by gel chromatography was 86,000. Based on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the subunit Mr was 39,900. The pI for mevalonate kinate was 6.2. The levels of mevalonate kinase protein and enzyme activity were determined in the livers of rats treated with either cholesterol-lowering agents (cholestyramine, pravastatin, and lovastatin) or with dietary modifications. Diets containing cholestyramine alone or cholestyramine and either pravastatin or lovastatin increased mevalonate kinase activity 3-6-fold. Mevalonate kinase activity decreased approximately 50% in rats treated with diets containing either 5% cholesterol or 5% cholesterol and 0.5% cholic acid. Fasting did not significantly change mevalonate kinase activity. The amount of mevalonate kinase protein in the liver was quantitated using immunoblots, and the changes in the levels of kinase activity induced by either drug treatment or by cholesterol feeding were correlated with similar changes in the levels of mevalonate kinase protein. Therefore, under these experimental conditions, mevalonate kinase activity in the liver was regulated principally by changes in the rates of enzyme synthesis and degradation.", 
    "26": "Several proteins in mammalian cells are modified post-translationally by the isoprenoid, farnesol. Incubation of cultured cells with [3H]mevalonate, an isoprenoid precursor, results in the labeling of multiple polypeptides, the most prominent of which migrate in the range of 21-26 kDa on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. In Rat-6 fibroblasts transformed by H-ras, one of the farnesylated proteins was identified as p21ras by two-dimensional immunoblotting. However, this protein accounted for only a small proportion of the [3H]mevalonate-derived radioactivity incorporated into 21-26-kDa proteins. Murine erythroleukemia cells, which did not express immunodetectable quantities of p21ras, contained several 21-26-kDa farnesylated proteins distributed in both the cytosolic and particulate fractions. At least eight of these proteins were capable of binding [alpha-32P]GTP on nitrocellulose membranes. Pulse-chase studies showed that the isoprenoid modification did not necessarily result in the translocation of the cytosolic proteins to the cell membrane. A prominent group of carboxyl-methylated proteins in murine erythroleukemia cells overlapped with the 21-26-kDa farnesylated proteins on one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate gels. Methylation of this group of proteins was selectively abolished when cells were treated with lovastatin, an inhibitor of isoprenoid synthesis. Addition of exogenous mevalonate to the lovastatin-treated cells fully restored carboxyl methylation. These studies suggest that the 21-26-kDa farnesylated proteins in mammalian cells are members of a recently discovered family of low molecular mass GTP-binding proteins which, although ras-related, appear to be distinct structurally and possibly functionally from the products of the ras genes. The observed isoprenoid-dependent carboxyl methylation of a group of 21-26-kDa proteins suggests that the low molecular mass GTP-binding proteins may undergo a series of post-translational C-terminal cysteine modifications (i.e. farnesylation, carboxyl methylation) analogous to those recently elucidated for p21ras.", 
    "27": "Following treatment of Chinese hamster ovary cells with inhibitors of mevalonate biosynthesis in the presence of exogenous cholesterol, the cellular concentration of phosphorylated dolichol and the incorporation of [3H]mannose into dolichol-linked saccharides and N-linked glycoproteins declined coincident with a decline in DNA synthesis. Addition of mevalonate to the culture medium increased rates of mannose incorporation into lipid-linked saccharides and restored mannose incorporation into N-linked glycoproteins to control levels within 4 h. After an additional 4 h, synchronized DNA synthesis began. Inhibition of the synthesis of lipid-linked oligosaccharides and N-linked glycoproteins by tunicamycin prevented the induction of DNA synthesis by mevalonate, indicating that glycoprotein synthesis was required for cell division. The results suggest that the rate of cell culture growth may be influenced by the level of dolichyl phosphate acting to limit the synthesis of N-linked glycoproteins.", 
    "28": "Simvastatin, a potent inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, was compared with cholestyramine resin in a randomized open-label 12-week multicenter study of 251 high-risk patients with familial or nonfamilial hypercholesterolemia. Simvastatin, 20 mg and 40 mg daily, produced mean reductions in total cholesterol of 26% and 33%, respectively, and reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of 32% and 40%. Cholestyramine resin, 4 to 12 g twice daily, reduced total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels 15% and 21%, respectively. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were increased 8% to 10% by all treatments. Plasma triglyceride levels were moderately decreased by simvastatin treatment, while triglyceride levels increased with cholestyramine treatment. Simvastatin was better tolerated than cholestyramine, which had numerous gastrointestinal tract side effects. No patient had a serious drug-related adverse event.", 
    "29": "Treatment of rat intestinal epithelial cells (IEC-6 cells) with lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylase inhibitors, ketoconazole and miconazole, had similar effects on 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity and cholesterol biosynthesis but the drugs differed in their ability to prevent the low density lipoprotein (LDL) suppression of reductase activity. Miconazole, at concentrations that inhibited the metabolism of lanosterol and epoxylanosterol to the same degree as ketoconazole, did not prevent low density lipoprotein action on reductase activity, whereas ketoconazole totally abolished the low density lipoprotein action on reductase activity. Both drugs caused: 1) a biphasic response in reductase activity such that at low concentrations (less than 2 microM) reductase activity was inhibited and at high concentrations (greater than 5 microM) the activity returned to control or higher than control levels; 2) an inhibition of metabolism of lanosterol to cholesterol, and 24(S), 25-epoxylanosterol to 24(S), 25-epoxycholesterol. Neither drug prevented suppression of reductase activity by 25-hydroxylanosterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol, or mevalonolactone added to the medium. Each drug increased the binding, uptake, and degradation of 125I-labeled LDL and inhibited the re-esterification of free cholesterol to cholesteryl oleate and cholesteryl palmitate. The release of free cholesterol from [3H]cholesteryl linoleate LDL could not account for the differential effect of ketoconazole and miconazole on the prevention of low density lipoprotein suppression of reductase activity. The differential effect of the drugs on low density lipoprotein suppression of reductase activity was not unique to IEC-6 cells, but was also observed in several cell lines of different tissue origin such as human skin fibroblast cells (GM-43), human hepatoblastoma cells (HepG2), and Chinese hamster ovary cells (wild type, K-1; 4 alpha-methyl sterol oxidase mutant, 215). These observations suggest that the suppressive action of low density lipoprotein on reductase activity 1) does not require the de novo synthesis of cholesterol, or 24(S), 25-epoxysterols; 2) is not mediated via the same mechanism as that of mevalonolactone; and 3) does not involve cholesteryl reesterification. Ketoconazole blocks a site in the process of LDL suppression of reductase activity that is not affected by miconazole.", 
    "30": "Cyclandelate was an effective inhibitor of rat hepatic acycloenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) with a concentration of 80 microM being required for half maximal inhibition. A similar effect was seen with human and rabbit liver microsomal enzymes. The drug did not compete with oleoyl CoA or cholesterol and could be removed from enzyme preparations by washing. It was hydrolysed rapidly by rat liver microsomes to products which were non inhibitory. No hydrolysis of the drug was seen with non hepatic microsomes and the concentration of cyclandelate required to cause half maximal inhibition of ACAT in the transformed mouse macrophage J774 microsomal fraction was less than 30 microM. The possible significance of the differential actions of cyclandelate towards hepatic and extra hepatic ACAT in vivo is discussed.", 
    "31": "Apolipoprotein E (apo E) phenotypes have been previously shown to influence plasma lipoprotein concentrations in normal populations and to affect the response to some lipid lowering drugs. The purpose of the present study was to determine if variations in the apo E phenotype also affect basal lipoprotein concentrations in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and if the apo E phenotype influenced their subsequent response to lovastatin. Apo E phenotypes were determined on plasma from 134 FH patients. The relative frequencies of the epsilon 2, epsilon 3, and epsilon 4 alleles were .090, .772, and .138, respectively. Plasma triglycerides were found to be 34% higher in E3/2 heterozygotes relative to E3/3 patients. Baseline concentrations of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in untreated FH patients were not influenced by the apo E phenotype; the hypolipidemic response to lovastatin (20 or 40 mg twice daily) was also independent of the apo-E phenotype of the patients.", 
    "32": "A variety of trans-6-[2-(substituted-1-naphthyl)ethyl(or ethenyl)]-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-4-hydroxy-2H-pyran-2-ones were prepared and, upon conversion to their 3,5-dihydroxy carboxylates, were found to have good inhibitory activity against the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, the rate-determining enzyme in cholesterogenesis. The most active compounds are 2,4,6- and 2,4,7-trichloro derivatives and would be expected to display about the same potency as the standard compactin upon resolution.", 
    "33": "Cholesteryl ester transfer activity is increased in plasma of cholesterol-fed rabbits. To investigate the mechanisms leading to changes in activity, we measured cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) mass by RIA and CETP mRNA abundance by Northern and slot blot analysis using a human CETP cDNA probe in control (n = 8) and cholesterol-fed rabbits (n = 10). Cholesterol feeding (chow plus 0.5% cholesterol, 10% corn oil) for 30 d increased CETP mass in plasma 3.2-fold in the cholesterol-fed rabbits (12.45 +/- 0.82 micrograms/ml) compared with controls (3.86 +/- 0.38 micrograms/ml). In the hypercholesterolemic rabbit, liver CETP mRNA levels were increased 2.8 times control mRNA levels. Actin, apo E, lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase, and albumin mRNA abundances were unchanged. In contrast to the widespread tissue distribution in humans, CETP mRNA was not detected in extrahepatic tissues of either control or cholesterol-fed animals. Using a sensitive RNase protection assay, the increase in liver CETP mRNA was detectable within 3 d of beginning the high cholesterol diet. Thus, in response to the atherogenic diet there is an early increase in liver CETP mRNA, probably causing increased CETP synthesis and secretion, and increased plasma CETP. The results indicate that the CETP gene may be regulated by diet-induced changes in lipid metabolism.", 
    "34": "Statin has previously been identified to be a 57-kD protein present in the nuclei of quiescent and senescent human fibroblasts, but not in their replicating counterparts (Wang, E. 1985. J. Cell Biol. 100: 545-551). In the present report we demonstrate by immunoprecipitation analysis of fractionated cellular extracts the existence of two populations of statin. The Triton X-100-soluble statin is found in replicating sparse cultures as well as in quiescent confluent cultures and quiescent serum-starved cultures of young human fibroblasts, but the Triton X-100-insoluble, nuclear envelope-localized statin is present only in the quiescent cultures. Two-dimensional gel analysis of the immunoprecipitated cellular fractions reveals that both populations of statin have an isoelectric point of 5.3. Pulse-chase experiments show that statin is synthesized as a 57-kD polypeptide and is not processed from a precursor of different molecular mass. Experiments on serum stimulation of quiescent cells show that synthesis of the Triton X-100-insoluble statin decreases rapidly during the transition from the G0 to S phase, and that this decrease is accompanied by a slower reduction in synthesis of the Triton X-100-soluble statin. These results suggest that the cellular expression of the two populations of statin may be associated with the mechanisms controlling the transition between the growing state and the quiescent state and confirm the previous finding that the Triton X-100-insoluble, nuclear envelope-localized statin could be used as a marker for cells arrested at the G0 phase of the cell cycle.", 
    "35": "Cells from six human colonic adenocarcinoma lines (CaCo-2, HT29, LS174T, SW480, SW403, and SW1417) and a normal skin fibroblast cell line (AG1519) were assayed in vitro for their ability to use low density lipoprotein (LDL). All tumor cell lines grew well in lipoprotein-deficient serum, implying that LDL in culture medium was not critical for cell growth. When cell growth was inhibited with mevinolin, a cholesterol synthesis inhibitor, the addition of LDL to the medium had no effect on the growth of cells from five of six tumor cell lines. CaCo-2 cells showed a moderate reversal while the fibroblast control showed total reversal of inhibition. A monoclonal antibody to bovine/human LDL receptor, used in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, indicated that only CaCo-2 cells and human skin fibroblast cells consistently demonstrated the presence of LDL receptors. Thus, five of six colon tumor cell lines were unable to overcome a mevinolin block in cholesterol metabolism indicating that these cells were deficient in LDL receptors.", 
    "36": "The expression of statin, a 57,000 Mr nuclear protein specifically present in non-proliferating cultured fibroblasts, was studied in vivo in the differentiating epithelial cells of the rat intestine. Using immunofluorescence microscopy we found that undifferentiated, proliferating crypt enterocytes are statin negative, whereas the differentiated non-proliferating villus enterocytes are statin positive. The epithelial cells of the intestine were isolated according to different stages of differentiation and the expression of statin was studied biochemically by immunoblotting assays. The prominent band (57,000 Mr) was present in abundance in villus cell fractions but undetectable in crypt cell fractions. These findings were also confirmed by immunofluorescence microscopy on individual intestinal epithelial cells of the different isolated fractions. The results presented here, which are similar to observations made in cell cultures, suggest that statin is a unique protein associated with the non-proliferative state of differentiated cells in tissue.", 
    "37": "The effects and safety of simvastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, were investigated alone or in association with cholestyramine in 66 patients with hypercholesterolaemia, in a 1-year study. In type IIa hypercholesterolaemia (41 patients), the association was more effective than simvastatin used alone in lowering total cholesterol (37% vs 29%) and LDL-cholesterol (45% vs 37%). In type IIb hypercholesterolaemia (23 patients), the association simvastatin-cholestyramine did not appear more effective than simvastatin used alone. The decrease of apoprotein B was parallel to the LDL-cholesterol decrease. Apoprotein A1 did not change significantly. The long-term safety of simvastatin was good. No lens opacity was noted. The most serious side-effect in our study was myolysis which occurred in two patients with a marked increase in creatine phosphokinase.", 
    "38": "The HMG CoA reductase inhibitors are the most effective drugs for treating hypercholesterolaemia currently available. They inhibit cholesterol synthesis and thus stimulate receptor-mediated uptake and degradation of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by the liver. In 30 patients with severe hypercholesterolaemia administration of lovastatin alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering manoeuvres maintained reductions of 25 to 31 per cent in serum cholesterol over five years. The drug was easy to take and well tolerated, the only significant side effect being a reversible myopathy. Two similar compounds, simvastatin and pravastatin, exert comparable effects on serum lipids, including modest reductions in triglycerides and increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The use of these drugs seems likely to exert a beneficial effect on atherosclerosis.", 
    "39": "Pravastatin sodium, a competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, is a new orally effective hypocholesterolaemic agent. In a two-way crossover study, eight healthy male subjects each received an intravenous and an oral dose of [14C]-pravastatin sodium. The oral absorption of [14C] activity from pravastatin sodium was about 34% and the oral bioavailability was about 18%, suggesting first-pass metabolism of pravastatin. After the intravenous dose, the recovery of radioactivity averaged 60% and 34% in urine and faeces, respectively. Corresponding values were 20% (urine) and 71% (faeces) for the oral dose. The estimated average plasma elimination half-life of pravastatin was 0.8 and 1.8 h for the intravenous and oral routes, respectively. The average values for total and renal clearances were 13.5 and 6.3 ml min-1 kg-1, respectively, and the steady-state volume of distribution averaged 0.51 kg-1. These results suggest that both kidney and liver are important sites of elimination for pravastatin.", 
    "40": "This study examined the actions of pravastatin on the metabolism of apolipoprotein B (apo B) in very low-, intermediate-, and low-density lipoproteins (VLDL, IDL, and LDL) in 10 patients with primary moderate hypercholesterolaemia. 131I-VLDL apo B was used as a tracer, and appearance of label was followed into IDL apo B and LDL apo B. Compared to placebo, pravastatin therapy reduced levels of cholesterol in total plasma. LDL, VLDL, and IDL cholesterol by 25%, 29%, 31%, and 47%, respectively. Pravastatin treatment also significantly decreased concentrations of apo B in LDL, IDL, and VLDL. The drug significantly reduced the mean production rate for VLDL apo B by 40%, and decreased production rates for LDL apo B in eight of 10 patients. In contrast, fractional catabolic rates (FCRs) were not altered significantly in any of the three lipoprotein fractions on pravastatin therapy. Further, pravastatin produced no consistent changes in LDL particle size, composition, or LDL subclass pattern. Thus pravastatin seemingly reduced input rates for all apo B-containing lipoproteins. Consistent with previous studies, this response was most likely the result of enhanced removal of nascent lipoproteins by increased activity of LDL receptors, although decreased synthesis of apo B in the liver is a possible second action.", 
    "41": "Leucine and protein metabolism were studied using stable isotope techniques in 6-year-old twins with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric aciduria during acute metabolic decompensation. The decompensation was preceded by prolonged fasting in twin 1 and by an upper respiratory infection in twin 2. Twin 2 was also studied when well (control study). During infection, leucine oxidation (36 mumol/kg per hour), protein catabolism (6.0 g/kg per day) and urinary excretion of major leucine metabolites (104 mumol/kg per hour) were all increased compared with the control study (16 mumol/kg per hour, 4.7 g/kg per day and 28 mumol/kg per hour respectively). During fasting, leucine oxidation (18 mumol/kg per hour) was unchanged and protein catabolism (4.1 g/kg per day) was decreased despite substantially increased urinary metabolite excretion (87 mumol/kg per hour) compared with the control study. These results indicate that protein mobilisation and leucine oxidation played important roles in metabolic decompensation during infection but not during fasting. It is likely that the increased metabolite excretion during fasting arose primarily from fatty acid catabolism, indicating the importance of this substrate in metabolic decompensation in 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric aciduria.", 
    "42": "Simvastatin (synvinolin MK-733) is a potent inhibitor of 3-HMG-CoA-reductase, the key enzyme for cholesterol biosynthesis. To investigate the efficiency and safety of this new drug on a long term basis, simvastatin was administered for 3 years to ten patients with type II hyperlipoproteinemia. Daily dosages were 20 or 40 mg. The drug therapy produced a significant reduction in serum levels of total cholesterol (19-34%), LDL-cholesterol (26-44%) and Apo B (19-33%). Triglycerides decreased moderately (2-23%) while HDL-cholesterol and Apo A1 changed only slightly (-3 to 6% and 5-13% respectively). Simvastatin was well tolerated. No consistent adverse clinical or biochemical effects were observed during the three-year therapy. The results indicate that simvastatin is a promising new therapy for high risk hypocholesterolemic patients.", 
    "43": "Human hepaotoblastoma cells (Hep G2) were cultured with a competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, CS-514. The synthesis of cholesterol was markedly inhibited after 1 h preincubation with CS-514. The synthesis and secretion of apolipoprotein (apo) B and A-1, however, were not affected. A long-term incubation (21-24 h) of cells with CS-514 did not change apo B synthesis and secretion, although a slight depression of apo A-1 synthesis was observed. Hep G2 cells were found to secrete LDL- and HDL-like lipoproteins which were poor in cholesterol when cells were incubated with the drug. These results suggest that the modulation of cholesterol synthesis affects neither the synthesis and secretion of apo B and A-1 nor the formation of lipoproteins.", 
    "44": "Epidemiological evidence suggests that elevated serum cholesterol, especially the low density lipoprotein (LDL) fraction, the total/high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol ratio, and the LDL/HDL-cholesterol ratio, remains a risk factor for atheromatous disease up to the age of 79 years. We studied the efficacy and tolerability of simvastatin, an HMG CoA reductase inhibitor, in 20 patients aged 65 to 75 years with clinical evidence of atheromatous disease. After four weeks of treatment, there was a 29% fall in LDL-cholesterol levels (P less than .01 vs placebo) with low dose simvastatin and a 38% fall with high dose simvastatin (P less than .001 vs placebo). Similar falls were seen in total cholesterol levels and the LDL/HDL-cholesterol and total/HDL-cholesterol ratios. Apoprotein B levels decreased by approximately 20% with both doses (P less than .05 vs placebo). In an open extension of the study, the decreases in lipid parameters were sustained for a further 48 weeks of treatment with doses of simvastatin ranging from 10 to 40 mg. Two patients required the addition of cholestyramine. Although a small study like this cannot establish safety and tolerance, side effects were minor and did not require stopping therapy in any patient. Simvastatin is an effective cholesterol lowering agent in older patients.", 
    "45": "Familial dysbetalipoproteinemia (type III hyperlipoproteinemia) is characterized by an increase of serum lipids caused by an accumulation of remnant particles of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. We studied the efficacy of simvastatin, an inhibitor of the biosynthesis of cholesterol, in this disorder.", 
    "46": "Twelve patients participated in an open-label study. After a three-week placebo period, they were treated with increasing doses (10 mg twice a day, 20 mg twice a day, and 40 mg twice a day) of simvastatin in six-week periods.", 
    "47": "With the 80-mg dose, the mean serum cholesterol level decreased from 12.30 +/- 4.96 to 5.29 +/- 1.24 mmol/L (mean reduction, 54%) and the mean serum triglyceride level decreased from 8.77 +/- 7.16 to 3.61 +/- 1.33 mmol/L (-48%); this was due to a decrease in very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) lipids. There was a decrease in the ratio of VLDL cholesterol to serum triglycerides and in the apolipoproteins B and E, suggesting a reduction in the amount of circulating atherogenic remnant particles. Except for a slight increase in serum alanine aminotransferase levels in three patients, no side effects were observed.", 
    "48": "These data show that levels of serum lipids can be effectively reduced by simvastatin in familial dysbetalipoproteinemia.", 
    "49": "Under most experimental conditions, the activities of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA reductase) and cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase, change together in parallel directions. It has been suggested that newly synthesized cholesterol may be the preferred substrate for cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase, which may account for the observed synchronous behavior of the two enzymes. To test this hypothesis, mevinolinic acid, a potent competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, was administered as a single intravenous bolus (10 mg/kg) to rats with a chronic bile fistula. Bile acid synthesis was determined following inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by mevinolinic acid over a 27-h time course and specific activities of HMG-CoA reductase and cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase were determined in liver microsomes. At 3, 6, and 27 h after a bolus dose of mevinolinic acid, bile acid synthesis was reduced by 54 +/- 5%, 42 +/- 8%, and 23 +/- 13%, respectively, from preinfusion baseline. Within 30 min after administration of mevinolinic acid, HMG-CoA reductase activity was inhibited by at least 87%. At 0.5, 1.5, 3, 6, and 27 h after mevinolinic acid injection, cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity was decreased by 6%, 25%, 54%, 41%, and 17%, respectively. By 27 h, the activities of both enzymes had returned to baseline levels. The reduction of bile acid synthesis correlated closely with the observed changes in the activities of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase. In vitro addition of mevinolinic acid (up to 20 microM) to rat liver microsomes failed to inhibit cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity, suggesting no direct effect of mevinolinic acid on enzyme activity. When a bolus dose of mevinolinic acid was coupled with a continuous infusion of mevalonate, the product of the reaction catalyzed by HMG-CoA reductase, the mevinolinic acid-induced decrease in cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity and bile acid synthesis was prevented. The results of this study provide evidence that, under the experimental conditions described, there is a linkage between the rates of cholesterol synthesis and the activities of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase. The data also emphasize the importance of the newly synthesized cholesterol in the regulation of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity.", 
    "50": "The administration of high dosages of various hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors has resulted in the development of subcapsular lenticular opacities in dogs. While dogs receiving cataractogenic doses of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors experienced profound decreases in circulating serum cholesterol concentrations (40-60% reductions in total serum cholesterol), a causal relationship between serum cholesterol lowering and cataractogenesis was not established. A strong relationship was demonstrated, however, between the systemic exposure to inhibitor (plasma drug levels) and the cataractogenic potential of the various compounds studied. Analysis of lenses from dogs chronically dosed with various HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors revealed the presence of low drug levels in the lens (less than 500 ng equivalents g-1), but no correlation was observed between the amount of drug associated with the lens after chronic treatment and cataract development. In addition, no abnormalities in cholesterol content or sterol composition were observed in clear and/or cataract containing lenses from dogs chronically dosed with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. The kinetics of drug appearance in the aqueous and lens cortex was assessed after doses of various HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, and suggested somewhat higher but not statistically significant peak concentrations of inhibitor were achieved by compounds which produced a higher incidence of cataracts. These data have suggested that high doses of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may increase lenticular exposure to drug via the aqueous humor by producing a substantial systemic exposure to drug substance. This may result in an increased concentration of inhibitor in the outer cortical region of the lens where cholesterol synthesis is critical, thereby resulting in the development of opacities. The production of lenticular changes by a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor of diverse chemical structure establishes, with reasonable assurance, that these lens changes are mechanism based (i.e. a product of the biochemical mechanism of action of this class of compounds). An extrapolation of these findings to patients receiving therapeutic dosages enables a favorable risk evaluation since the doses to be employed clinically are much lower and result in a far lower systemic exposure to drug substance.", 
    "51": "The effects of the H2-receptor antagonists, cimetidine and famotidine, on the microsomal metabolism of [14C]lovastatin were investigated. Liver microsomes were prepared from control, phenobarbital- and 3-methylcholanthrene-pretreated rats and humans (male and female). Concentration-dependent inhibition of the metabolism of lovastatin (0.1 mM) was observed with cimetidine (0.1 to 1.0 mM). In contrast, famotidine at a similar concentration was a very weak inhibitor. The formation of 6'beta-hydroxy-lovastatin, the major microsomal metabolite of lovastatin, was similarly inhibited. The results suggest that in vivo metabolic interaction with concomitantly administered lovastatin is less likely with famotidine than with cimetidine. Phenobarbital pretreatment produced 58% stimulation in overall metabolism, whereas 3-methylcholanthrene pretreatment had no effect relative to control rats (5.4 nmol/mg protein/min). Liver microsomes from phenobarbital-pretreated rats produced 67% more of the 6'beta-hydroxy-lovastatin but 63-66% less of the 3''-hydroxy and 6'-exomethylene metabolites. Liver microsomes from 3-methylcholanthrene-treated rats also produced less 3\"-hydroxy-lovastatin (49%) but similar quantities of the other two metabolites. 6'beta-Hydroxy-lovastatin was a major metabolite with human liver microsomes. Interestingly with these microsomes, hydroxylation at the 3''-position of the molecule was a negligible pathway and hydrolysis to the hydroxy acid form was not observed. The formation of 6'-exomethylene-lovastatin was also catalyzed by human liver microsomes (0.5 to 0.8 nmol/mg protein/min).", 
    "52": "Lactones of pyridine- and pyrimidine-substituted 3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoic (-heptanoic) acids 2-4 have been synthesized. Extensive exploration of structure-activity relationships led to several compounds exceeding the inhibitory activity of mevinolin (1b) on HMG-CoA reductase, both in vitro and in vivo. First clinical trials with 2i (HR 780) are in preparation.", 
    "53": "A series of 1,3,5-trisubstituted pyrazole mevalonolactones were prepared and evaluated for their ability to inhibit the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase in vitro. Since previous studies suggested that the 5-(4-fluorophenyl) and 3-(1-methylethyl) substituents afforded optimum potency, attention was focused on variations in position 1 of the pyrazole ring. Biological evaluation of analogues bearing a variety of 1-substituents suggested that, although most substituents were tolerated, none afforded an advantage over phenyl, which exhibited potency comparable to that of compactin in vitro.", 
    "54": "A novel series of trans-6-(2-pyrrol-1-ylethyl)-4-hydroxypyran-2-ones and their dihydroxy acid derivatives were prepared and evaluated for their ability to inhibit the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase in vitro. A systematic study of substitution at the 2- and 5-positions of the pyrrole ring revealed that optimum potency was realized with the 2-(4-fluorophenyl)-5-isopropyl derivative 8x, which possessed 30% of the in vitro activity of the potent fungal metabolite compactin (I). A molecular modeling analysis led to the description of a pharmacophore model characterized by (A) length limits of 5.9 and 3.3 A for the 2- and 5-substituents, respectively, as well as an overall width limit of 10.6 A across the pyrrole ring from the 2- to the 5-substituent and (B) an orientation of the ethyl(ene) bridge to the 4-hydroxypyran-2-one ring nearly perpendicular to the planes of the parent pyrrole, hexahydronaphthalene, and phenyl rings of the structures examined (Figure 3, theta = 80-110 degrees). Attempts to more closely mimic compactin's polar isobutyric ester side chain with the synthesis of 2-phenylpyrroles containing polar phenyl substituents resulted in analogues with equal or slightly reduced potencies when compared to the 2-[(unsubstituted or 4-fluoro)phenyl]pyrroles, supporting the hypothesis that inhibitory potency is relatively insensitive to side-chain polarity or charge distribution in this area.", 
    "55": "Hypercholesterolemia may pose a substantial risk for cardiovascular disease. The present investigation was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the cholesterol synthesis inhibitor, lovastatin, in 13 nephrotic patients with 5.6 +/- 0.7 g/24 h of albuminuria. All patients were maintained on a low cholesterol diet throughout the study. After a 4-week placebo period, lovastatin was administered, 20 mg twice daily for 6 weeks. Lovastatin reduced total cholesterol by 27% from 8.6 +/- 0.6 mmol/L (331 +/- 24 mg/dL) to 6.3 +/- 0.4 mmol/L (242 +/- 17 mg/dL) (P less than 0.01), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 27%, from 5.8 +/- 0.5 mmol/L (223 +/- 20 mg/dL) to 4.2 +/- 0.6 mmol/L (163 +/- 22 mg/dL) (P less than 0.01), and apolipoprotein B by 29%, from 153 +/- 12 mg/dL to 109 +/- 8 mg/dL to 109 +/- 8 mg/dL P less than 0.01). Triglycerides and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) cholesterol levels were also reduced by 30% and 37%, respectively (P less than 0.01). High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and apolipoproteins A-1 and A-2 were not significantly altered. Renal function and urine protein excretion were not affected by lovastatin. Although one patient developed diarrhea and discontinued treatment before completing 6 weeks of lovastatin, the other 12 patients had no adverse effects. In this short-term study, lovastatin therapy had few side effects and had favorable effects on the lipoprotein profile of nephrotic syndrome patients.", 
    "56": "The nephrotic syndrome was induced in uninephrectomized Sprague-Dawley rats using repeated injections of puromycin and protamine sulfate. Preliminary studies demonstrated that the administration of lovastatin (4 mg/kg body weight [BW] subcutaneously [SC] daily) was effective at lowering plasma cholesterol over a 63-day period, although not to normal values. Subsequently, two groups of rats that had been made nephrotic were studied; one group (n = 8) received lovastatin, the other (n = 9) received the vehicle alone. Blood and urine collections were made at days 0, 23, and 60. Clearance studies and renal histology were obtained at day 60. Lovastatin-treated rats had significantly lower cholesterol at day 23 and 60 than vehicle-treated rats (270.5 +/- 39.7 v 501.7 +/- 81.9 and 148.2 +/- 10.7 v 268.2 +/- 40.8 mg/dL, P less than 0.05). Both groups of rats developed equivalent degrees of proteinuria and hypoalbuminemia. At day 60, the lovastatin-treated rats had a lower urea: 18.3 +/- 4.1 v 55.8 +/- 9.6 mmol/L (blood urea nitrogen [BUN] 51.2 +/- 111.5 v 156.2 +/- 27.0 mg/dL, P less than 0.02) and greater unulin clearance (1.83 +/- 0.42 v 0.82 +/- 0.41 mL/min/kg BW, P less than 0.05) than the vehicle-treated rats. Neither group was hypertensive and the blood pressure (BP) was similar in both groups. The percentage of glomeruli showing no changes or minimal histological changes was significantly greater in the lovastatin-treated group (26.5% +/- 5.7% v 8.33% +/- 3.33%, P less than 0.02), and there were more glomeruli with global sclerosis in the vehicle-treated group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "57": "Two hundred and ten patients (119 men and 91 women, mean age 54) with primary hypercholesterolemia (97% with total serum cholesterol greater than 240 mg/dl) were treated with lovastatin during 12 weeks in a placebo-controlled multicenter trial (10 cities and 21 investigators). All patients remained under an isocaloric low-fat, low-cholesterol diet throughout the study, and received placebo on a single-blind basis for the first 4 weeks (pretreatment period). Serum total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG) and HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) were measured at the beginning (week-4) and again at week 12. TC was also measured at weeks 0, 4, 8 and 12, while LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) was calculated by a modification of Friedewald's formula. At the 5 clinic visits vital signs and body weight were recorded, and patients were questioned about adverse experiences. Safety laboratory tests (complete blood count, serum creatinine and creatinine phosphokinase, fasting plasma glucose, serum bilirubin, transaminases and alkaline phosphatase) plus a resting electrocardiogram (EG) and a complete (slit lamp) ophthalmologic examination were also carried out at weeks-4 and 12. During the treatment period lovastatin dosage was adjusted from 20 mg/day to 40 or 80 mg/day, if the TC value was greater than 200 mg/dL, with the resulting mean daily increasing doses of 28 mg (weeks 0-4), 37 mg (weeks 4-8), and 55 mg (weeks 8-12).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "58": "The authors review the results of the clinical use of lovastatin in 150 patients with associated coronary heart disease and coronary atherosclerosis (according to coronarography). All the patients suffered from primary non-familial hyperlipoproteinemia (of the IIa and IIb types) and were entered into the placebo-controlled studies of the effectiveness of lovastatin. After 3 months of the treatment there was a decrease in the levels of total cholesterol (by 36%) (p less than 0.001); the content of cholesterol LDLP dropped by 48% (p less than 0.001), and that of triglycerides by 19% (p less than 0.01), while the level of cholesterol HDLP rose. Side effects were recorded in an insignificant number of cases. Therefore, lovastatin is a highly effective and well tolerable drug for the treatment of patients with coronary heart disease and hyperlipoproteinemia.", 
    "59": "Cytokinetic analyses of gliomas and other neoplasms rely exclusively on the use of proliferation-dependent markers such as [3H]-thymidine and BuDR incorporation and the detection of growth-dependent proteins such as proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and Ki-67. In normal tissues, the monoclonal antibody S-44 recognizes statin, a nuclear protein expressed only in nonproliferating cells. In the present study, indirect immunofluorescence microscopy using S-44 identified nuclear statin in 5.9% of a population of untreated human SK-MG-1 glioma cells in vitro. Incremental doses of the alkylating agent sarcosinamide chloroethylnitrosourea (SarCNU) induced a linear increase in the fraction of statin-positive SK-MG-1 cells. Labeling of nuclear statin with the monoclonal antibody S-44 may be a potentially useful marker of the cytotoxic effects of anticancer drugs in gliomas and other neoplastic tissues.", 
    "60": "The in vivo effect of clofibrate on the main regulatory enzymes of cholesterogenesis has been comparatively studied for the first time in chick liver and brain. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase and mevalonate 5-pyrophosphate decarboxylase from chick liver were significantly inhibited by this hypocholesterolenic drug, while mevalonate kinase and mevalonate 5-phosphate kinase were not affected. No enzyme from chick brain was significantly inhibited by the in vivo treatment. However, both liver and brain reductase activity was inhibited in vitro by clofibrate, inhibition that was progressive with increasing concentrations (1.25-5.00 mM) of drug.",

    "62": "Post-mortem biochemical analyses of dog lenses and of aqueous humour of a 2 year oral toxicity study in the dog with Fluvastatin (control, 1, 8 and 16 mg/kg/day) did not show any relationship to the observed lens opacities (3 animals out of 8 at 16 mg/kg/day). With respect to lens transparency, a daily dosage of 8 mg/kg/day Fluvastatin to dogs over a period of 2 years is non-cataractogenic. Mean data on lenticular enzyme activities (GPX, G6PH, GAPDH, ALD, AR, LDH, PFK and SDH) as well as measurements of GSH/GSSG, ATP, ADP, AMP, Gluc, Fruc, Sorb, G6P and F6P do not indicate changes which may directly lead to lens opacifications. Conformational changes of lens proteins (heat lability of PFK-activity), a shift in the albumin/IgG ratio of aqueous humour and equatorial lens protein composition changes (after isoelectrofocusing) were observed. The biological significance of these changes is unknown as the non-cataractogenic dose for lens opacities in beagle dogs is 8 mg/kg/day.", 
    "63": "35 pravastatin-treated patients with familial hypercholesterolemia were included in an ocular drug-safety study. Besides general examinations performed by the department of internal medicine a complete ophthalmological examination with special respect to lens opacities was carried out at the beginning, followed by control visits every six months. Scheimpflug photography of the eyes and densitometric image analysis provided objective data on lens transparency. After 18 months of treatment there is no evidence for any pathological lens changes induced by the drug applied. A decrease in visual acuity of 0.2 or more as seen in two eyes was not accompagnied by a corresponding increase in lens opacities. These observations correspond with the results of other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors tested so far.", 
    "64": "Pravastatin, a new HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor, was administered to hypercholesterolemic 14 patients with coronary heart disease for a period of two years. This drug reduces the plasma LDL-cholesterol concentrations approximately 30-40%. No development of cataracts or other ocular side effects could be observed during this two year follow-up.", 
    "65": "The efficacy and safety of the HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor pravastatin was assessed in a double-blind, placebo controlled study. Thirty patients (51 y) with hyperlipoproteinaemia Type IIa (N = 22) or IIb (N = 8) received for 16 weeks either pravastatin 5 mg b.d. for 8 weeks followed by 10 mg b.d. for 8 weeks (Group I), or 10 mg b.d. for 8 weeks followed by 20 mg b.d. to 16 weeks (Group II), or placebo (Group III). In Groups I and II, mean serum total cholesterol was reduced by -26% and -22%, respectively; low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol decreased by -28% and -27%, apolipoprotein B by -25% and -23%, and apolipoprotein E by -9% (NS) and -16%, respectively. Serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol was increased by 11% in Group II, and so the total/HDL-cholesterol ratio fell by 33%. Apoprotein A1 and A2 were not significantly changed. No serious clinical and laboratory abnormalities were observed. The data suggest considerable therapeutic efficacy of pravastatin in the treatment of Type II hyperlipoproteinaemia.", 
    "66": "We reported previously that cholesterol feeding induced an increase in hepatic secretion of VLDL and a decrease in that of LDL, especially LDL-apo B100, using monkey liver perfusion. In the present study we conducted rat liver perfusion using the HMG Co A reductase inhibitor (CS-514) and Kampo medicine (Daisaikoto) to elucidate the mechanism of the effect of dietary cholesterol on hepatic lipoprotein and apolipoprotein synthesis. Although the secretion of VLDL was increased by cholesterol feeding, that of LDL and especially of apo B100 of LDL were markedly decreased, and apo E of the LDL was increased as observed in the monkey liver perfusion experiments. The effect of CS-514 was clearly different from the effect of dietary cholesterol in spite of the suppression of hepatic cholesterogenesis which was comparable to that induced by cholesterol feeding, suggesting that the decrease in secretion of LDL-apo B100 induced by the dietary cholesterol is not due to suppressed cholesterogenesis. Daisaikoto, which was added to the diet together with cholesterol, diminished the effects of dietary cholesterol on the plasma and hepatic cholesterol levels. When the liver treated with Daisaikoto was perfused, the effect of dietary cholesterol on the production of lipoprotein and apolipoprotein was markedly diminished. This evidence indicates that the decrease in LDL-apo B100 and the increase in apo E were mediated by the hepatic cholesterol level.", 
    "67": "Pravastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, suppresses new synthesis of cholesterol via HMG-CoA in hepatocytes. As a result, low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor activity in the liver is enhanced, which leads to lowering of plasma cholesterol. Inhibitors are shown to be effective in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH). Although FH heterozygotes are defined genetically as possessing half the normal LDL receptor activity, some heterogeneity of LDL receptor activity is observed in these patients. To see whether the effect of an inhibitor is related to LDL receptor activity in each patient, pravastatin was administered to 7 FH heterozygotes for 3 months at a daily dose of 10 mg; their mean LDL receptor activities measured before the therapy were 45.0 +/- 9.9% of the normal control. After medication, mean serum total cholesterol decreased from 349.0 to 279.7 mg/dl (p less than 0.05), and LDL-cholesterol decreased from 272.6 to 207.7 mg/dl (p less than 0.05). A significant correlation between the initial LDL receptor activity and the effect of pravastatin was not proved. However, the pre-treatment level of LDL-cholesterol was positively correlated (r = 0.795) with the absolute decrement of LDL-cholesterol after 3 months (p less than 0.05). This implies that the more LDL-cholesterol was elevated, the more pravastatin was effective.", 
    "68": "The treatment of hypercholesterolemia in renal transplant recipients has been problematic. In the present double-blind study, 11 patients were treated with diet for at least 4 weeks. They were then randomized to placebo or the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, lovastatin (20 mg/day) for 6 weeks, followed by crossover to an additional 6 weeks of lovastatin or placebo. All patients had stable allograft function 8.4 +/- 1.2 years (mean +/- SEM) after transplantation, and received low-dose prednisone and azathioprine immunosuppression. Compared with diet alone, lovastatin caused a 21% reduction in total cholesterol from 307 +/- 14 mg/dL to 244 +/- 13 mg/dL (P less than 0.05). Lovastatin reduced LDL cholesterol 28% from 214 +/- 12 mg/dL to 155 +/- 11 mg/dL (P less than 0.05). Trends toward favorable changes in HDL cholesterol, serum triglycerides, and apolipoproteins were not statistically significant. Liver enzymes, creatine phosphokinase, and renal function remained stable. With lovastatin there was a 27% increase in the WBC (from 6220 +/- 530 cells/mm3 to 7780 +/- 510 cells/mm3, P less than 0.05) that was attributable to a 45% increase in neutrophils (P less than 0.05). This effect of lovastatin, possibly the result of reduced azathioprine bone marrow suppression, could have important implications for immunosuppressive therapy in this patient population. Altogether, these results suggest that lovastatin may be a safe and effective treatment for hypercholesterolemia in renal transplant recipients receiving conventional immunosuppression.", 
    "69": "45 patients suffering from a primary hypercholesterolemia were treated with Simvastatin. Additionally to internal visits regular ophthalmologic examinations were performed. The main interest concerning the ophthalmologic examination was directed toward the documentation and measurement of lens opacities by means of Scheimpflug photography. Moreover, every 6 months a complete regular ophthalmologic examination was carried out. We present the results after a time period of 2 years. Relevant changes in clinical findings could not be found. In some patients the Scheimpflug measurement revealed an increase in light scattering. These findings, however, were within the limit of normal age related changes.", 
    "70": "The cholesterol requirements of the lens for the formation of plasma membranes are met by self-synthesis immediately after birth, this capacity, however, decreases considerably with increasing age, so that the deficit can only be met by exogenous supply. These findings are of great importance with respect to the qualitative assessment of extra-hepatical side effects of the substance class of HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors on possible disturbances of lens transparency. In contrast to investigations of Mosley et al. (23) with rat and rabbit lenses, we did not find any activity of the HMG-CoA-reductase in our experiments with the lens cortex of calf, bovine, Beagle dog. The disturbances in lens transparency observed in chronical toxicity tests with high doses of HMG-CoA- reductase inhibitors might rather be due to the impairment of the exogenous cholesterol supply by a considerable decrease of the normal cholesterol level in the blood. The therapeutical treatment of pathologically increased blood cholesterol levels of patients should therefore not affect the transparency of human lenses. Relevant drug-safety-clinical studies confirm this experimentally substantiated supposition.", 
    "71": "Normal bovine lenses and bovine lenses after incubation in TC 199 in the presence of a lipid lowering drug were divided into four parts: the equatorial ring, the nucleus, the anterior cortex and posterior cortex. The lipids were extracted according to Egge et al. (1). Total lipids were determined gravimetrically, the lipid fractions phospholipids (PL), cardiolipin (CL), free fatty acids (FFA) and cholesterol (CH) were separated by thin layer chromatography and determined quantitative by densitometry after charring with 10% sulfuric acid. There are differences in lipid distribution between the four lens compartments, but there are no differences between normal and drug treated lenses in total lipids and lipid fractions. This result could be explained in different ways: either during this incubation time of 24 hours at 37 degrees C there will be no effect on the lens epithelial cells or there is no de-novo synthesis of lipids, especially of cholesterol in the bovine lens epithelium which could be influenced by lipid lowering drugs like HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.", 
    "72": "The effect of lovastatin on the hyperlipidemia induced in rats with experimental nephrotic syndrome was investigated; toxicity and the effects on common blood chemistry parameters were also assessed. Hyperlipoproteinemia in this particular model is associated with an increase in hepatic synthesis of lipoproteins, and treatment with lovastatin could be the most suitable, since the drug inhibits cellular cholesterol synthesis. Lovastatin treatment resulted in a considerable reduction in plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels. The decrease in cholesterol levels with treatment was mainly confined to the low-density lipoproteins (LDL) although there was a reduction in the nephrotic-syndrome-induced incremental level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Other lipoprotein fractions were unaffected by lovastatin. LDL apoprotein B was increased in both groups of rats, but to a lesser degree in the lovastatin-treated group, suggesting a double effect, inhibition of both, cholesterol and apoprotein synthesis. Both groups of rats showed a certain degree of renal impairment as shown by significant elevations in plasma urea and creatinine levels. Hepatic damage was also observed, chemically and microscopically, in both groups of rats, being more pronounced in those rats treated with lovastatin in which a 50% mortality ensued after 2 weeks of treatment. At the dosage used this may have some implications in its therapeutic use in certain conditions.", 
    "73": "There is increasing evidence that conventional lipid-lowering therapy can arrest the progression of coronary atherosclerosis. Trials are now under way to determine whether more radical reduction of low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol will reverse atherosclerosis and lead to regression of coronary lesions. The ability to effect such reductions has been markedly enhanced by the introduction into clinical practice of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors.", 
    "74": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors are gaining widespread use in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Clinical experience with lovastatin, which is approaching 4 years in many patients, indicates that it is well tolerated. Short-term adverse effects have usually been self-limited and have included abdominal pain, cramps, bloating, and flatus in 4-6% of cases. Raised hepatic transaminases and myopathy have occurred in 1.3 and 0.1% of cases, respectively; both, however, are reversible upon discontinuation of drug. To date, there is no evidence that lovastatin adversely affects the human lens. Overall, the drug has been well tolerated by the vast majority of patients over the long term. Early clinical experience with simvastatin shows a pattern and frequency of side effects similar to that reported with lovastatin.", 
    "75": "Five centers participated in a double-blind, randomized, active-drug controlled study. The selected patients had a diagnosis of primary hypercholesterolemia (phenotype IIa or IIb, total cholesterol [TC] greater than 300 mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol greater than 195 mg/dl, triglycerides [TG] less than 350 mg/dl). Throughout the study the patients observed a lipid-lowering diet (American Heart Association). After a baseline placebo period (4 weeks), the patients were randomly assigned to simvastatin 20 mg q.p.m. or fenofibrate 200 mg b.i.d. If after 6 weeks of treatment the LDL cholesterol level remained over 140 mg/dl the dose of simvastatin was doubled. The total duration of treatment was 10 weeks. One hundred eighty-four patients completed the study; age ranged from 17 to 72 years (mean 46; 129 men, 55 women). Seventy-nine patients had ischemic heart diseases. Simvastatin significantly reduces TC, LDL, and apolipoprotein (apo) B (30%, 35%, and 27%, respectively). These effects are larger than those of fenofibrate (19%, 22%, and 14%, respectively). Fenofibrate decreased very-low-density lipoprotein and TG, and increased high-density lipoprotein and apo A1, to a larger extent than simvastatin. However, the difference reached statistical significance only for TG (29% versus 17%). Both drugs were well tolerated. Clinical adverse experiences occurred with a low frequency, and few of these were considered drug related (6 and 8% in the simvastatin and fenofibrate groups, respectively). Only two patients had serious laboratory adverse experiences considered drug related or possibly drug related (one in each treatment group with increased SGPT, gamma-GT, and/or creatine phosphokinase).", 
    "76": "A subanalysis was performed on data acquired from 67 subjects having serum cholesterol levels of 6.2 mmol/l or above (greater than or equal to 240 mg/dl) and triglyceride levels of 2.25 to 4.00 mmol/l (199-354 mg/dl) (excluding patients with familial hypercholesterolemia), who were participating in a multicenter study comparing lovastatin and gemfibrozil, to evaluate the role of these agents in the treatment of combined hyperlipidemia (type IIb phenotype). In stratum 1 (cholesterol measures of 62.-7.79 mmol/l [240-301 mg/dl]), patients received either lovastatin 20 mg nightly (n = 17) or gemfibrozil 600 mg twice daily (n = 8), and in stratum 2 (cholesterol levels greater than or equal to 7.8 mmol/l [greater than or equal to 302 mg/dl]), patients received either lovastatin 40 mg nightly (n = 23) or gemfibrozil 600 mg b.i.d. (n = 19) for 6 weeks. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels were reduced significantly more by lovastatin than by gemfibrozil (stratum 1, -23 versus +1%, stratum 2, -34 versus -12%, respectively). A treatment goal of 4.0 mmol/l (155 mg/dl) for LDL cholesterol was achieved by 59 and 35% of patients receiving lovastatin and by 0 and 11% of patients receiving gemfibrozil in strata 1 and 2, respectively. Gemfibrozil was more effective in reducing triglyceride levels and in increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in both strata, although increases in HDL/LDL cholesterol ratios were greater with lovastatin. We conclude that, although lovastatin was more useful in normalizing LDL cholesterol, neither agent was ideal for all patients with combined hyperlipidemia. Further development of treatment regimens is called for in this group of patients.", 
    "77": "Single-drug therapy is often not sufficient to lower total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia to desirable or target levels. Therefore, combination drug therapy is often necessary. The most potent therapy to achieve this goal is a combination of a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitor, which reduces cholesterol synthesis, and a bile acid sequestrant, which indirectly depletes the intrahepatic cholesterol pool. LDL cholesterol reductions reportedly vary between 52 and 54% in short-term trials. Combining a bile acid sequestrant with nicotinic acid reduces LDL cholesterol 34-55%, and with a fibrate, 12-42%. The triple-drug regimen of bile acid sequestrant, an HMG CoA reductase inhibitor, and nicotinic acid is even more effective, achieving reductions of 59-67%. All these regimens elevate high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels concomitantly by 2-37%.", 
    "78": "Lovastatin and benzafibrate have proved effective in lowering low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and elevating high-density-lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. We compared their tolerability, safety, and effects on lipoproteins and urinary mevalonate excretion in a short-term study. Forty patients with primary hypercholesterolemia were enrolled in a single-blind randomized study with a diet/placebo period of 8 weeks and a treatment period of 12 weeks. Twenty patients received lovastatin (final average dose 70.5 mg/day), and 20 patients received bezafibrate 400 mg/day. LDL cholesterol was lowered by 35% (from 323 to 208 mg/dl) with lovastatin and by 8% (from 289 to 264 mg/dl) with benzafibrate. HDL cholesterol increased by 21 and 20% with lovastatin and benzafibrate, respectively. Twenty-four-hour urinary mevalonic acid output decreased by 37% during treatment with lovastatin and by 2% during treatment with bezafibrate. Thus, the lowering of cholesterol by lovastatin, but not by bezafibrate, can be attributed to inhibition of HMG CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase. Both lovastatin and bezafibrate are well tolerated.", 
    "79": "The microsomal enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase is a key rate-controlling step early in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway that catalyzes the conversion of HMG CoA to mevalonic acid. Since this enzyme plays a significant role in regulating cholesterol synthesis, it is a rational target for pharmacologic intervention. The first potent, specific inhibitor of HMG CoA was mevastatin (compactin, ML-236B), which was discovered in 1976 by Endo et al. [J Antibiot 1976:29:1346-1348]. Subsequently, lovastatin, a novel, more active fungal metabolite was isolated from a strain of Aspergillus terreus. Lovastatin, the first of this class of agents to be approved for clinical use, was chemically modified to form simvastatin. Simvastatin is superior to lovastatin in intrinsic inhibitory potency. Both are inactive lactone prodrugs that must be converted to their respective dihydroxy open-acid forms to elicit inhibitory activity. Pharmacologic characterization of lovastatin and simvastatin has demonstrated that these potent inhibitors of HMG CoA reductase specifically inhibit cholesterol synthesis in animal cells, as well as in vivo after oral administration of the agents. Oral administration of either lovastatin or simvastatin to dogs in the presence or absence of the bile acid sequestrant cholestyramine results in a marked, sustained lowering of plasma cholesterol. Associated with the cholesterol lowering is a decrease in urinary and plasma levels of mevalonic acid, the end product of the HMG CoA reductase reaction. The target organ for inhibitors of HMG CoA reductase is the liver, the primary site of cholesterol biosynthesis. Both lovastatin and simvastatin are preferentially extracted by this organ.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "80": "The frequency of all forms of atherosclerotic vascular disease is much greater in diabetics than in nondiabetics. Abnormalities in both the quantity and the quality of lipoproteins are among the many factors that can contribute to this. The most frequent quantitative lipoprotein abnormality in diabetics is hypertriglyceridemia. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels may be reduced, normal, or increased depending on the type of diabetes, its treatment, and the presence or absence of obesity. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in diabetics generally are not different from those in nondiabetics. The qualitative changes in lipoprotein composition may include alterations in the C apolipoproteins that could retard very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) catabolism, enrichment of LDL and HDL with triglyceride, and modifications of LDL (e.g., glycosylation or oxidation) that makes it more atherogenic. The present rationale for the treatment of LDL abnormalities in diabetics is based on extrapolation from intervention trials in nondiabetics. These trials have suggested targets for plasma and LDL cholesterol levels. To date, no similar trials have been conducted in diabetics. Hence, it is not known whether the same or even lower LDL targets should apply to diabetics. Primary intervention trials have also shown the benefits, at least in nondiabetics, of increasing HDL levels. There is increasing evidence to support a cardiovascular risk effect of hypertriglyceridemia and one secondary intervention trial has demonstrated benefit associated with the correction of this. An added benefit of triglyceride reduction, at least in the milder diabetics, appears to be an improvement in insulin sensitivity. Fibrates are the drugs of choice for the correction of hypertriglyceridemia.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
