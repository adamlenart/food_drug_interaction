The stents were implanted in both common iliac arteries of 8 pigs. Prior to sacrifice at 1 month, angiography was performed to determine patency. Specimens were harvested for quantitative histomorphometry; vascular injury and inflammation scores were assigned to the stented iliac segments.", 
    "2": "All stented arteries were angiographically patent. The mean luminal diameter (3.05 mm) and area (30.36 mm2) of DEX-eluting PLA stents were decreased compared to other stents (PLA + P(D,L)LA: 3.66 mm and 43.92 mm2; PLA + SIM: 4.21 mm and 56.48 mm2; PLA + PCL: 4.19 mm and 54.64 mm2; Wallstent: 5.01 mm and 81.19 mm2). Wallstents and DEX-eluting PLA stents induced minimal intimal hyperplasia: PLA + DEX: 0.16 mm, PLA + P(D,L)LA: 0.35 mm, PLA + SIM: 0.33 mm, PLA + PCL: 0.29 mm, and Wallstent: 0.18 mm. The vascular injury scores demonstrated only mild vascular trauma for all stents. Only mild to moderate inflammatory reaction was noted around stent struts with a vascular inflammation score.", 
    "3": "Biodegradable polymer stents appear to be biocompatible and reliable, causing minimal neointimal hyperplasia. Furthermore, the new biodegradable poly-D/L-lactic acid stent can be used as a local drug delivery vehicle. The DEX-eluting PLA stent reduces neointimal hyperplasia. The findings show a need for further investigation to prove the efficacy and safety of this new biodegradable drug-eluting stent.", 
    "4": "The \"Treating to New Targets\" (TNT) trial compared atorvastatin 80 mg (aiming at reducing LDL cholesterol < or = 75 mg/dl) and atorvastatin 10 mg (LDL < or = 100 mg/dl as target) in 10,001 patients with stable coronary heart disease followed up for 5 years. A reduction of major cardiovascular events of 22% was observed in the atorvastatin 80 mg group as compared to the atorvastatin 10 mg group (hazard ratio: 0.78; 95 % interval of confidence: 0.69-0.89; p < 0.001). Such clinical efficacy was obtained while a good drug safety profile was maintained. Total mortality was not significantly different between the two groups. However, and remarkably, cardiovascular death was not the first cause of death anymore in this atorvastatin-treated population. The results of TNT in patients with stable coronary heart disease thus confirm the results of PROVE-IT in patients with acute coronary syndrome. These two randomised controlled trials should encourage considering a LDL cholesterol level of 75 mg/dl (rather than 100 mg/dl) as a new target in any patient with coronary heart disease.", 
    "5": "Our previous demonstration of an antimetastatic effect of lovastatin, both in rat sarcoma and lymphoma tumor-models, as well as the fact that lovastatin and radiation are able to stop the cell cycle in different phases, suggested the feasibility of a combined treatment. We studied the effect of the in vitro combined treatment of a B-cell rat lymphoma (L-TACB) with lovastatin and irradiation. The results herein obtained provide new information about the role of statins as radiosensitizers. The antitumor effect of the combined treatment was higher than that elicited by either treatment alone. This effect could be a consequence, at least in part, of an enhanced apoptosis.", 
    "6": "Reduction of serum cholesterol levels with statin therapy decreases the risk of coronary heart disease. Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by statin results in decreased synthesis of cholesterol and other products downstream of mevalonate, which may produce adverse effects in statin therapy. We studied the reductions of serum ubiquinol-10 and ubiquinone-10 levels in hypercholesterolemic patients treated with atorvastatin. Fourteen patients were treated with 10 mg/day of atorvastatin, and serum lipid, ubiquinol-10 and ubiquinone-10 levels were measured before and after 8 weeks of treatment. Serum total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels decreased significantly. All patients showed definite reductions of serum ubiquinol-10 and ubiquinone-10 levels, and mean levels of serum ubiquinol-10 and ubiquinone-10 levels decreased significantly from 0.81 +/- 0.21 to 0.46 +/- 0.10 microg/ml (p < 0.0001), and from 0.10 +/- 0.06 to 0.06 +/- 0.02 microg/ml (p = 0.0008), respectively. Percent reductions of ubiquinol-10 and those of total cholesterol showed a positive correlation (r = 0.627, p = 0.0165). As atorvastatin reduces serum ubiquinol-10 as well as serum cholesterol levels in all patients, it is imperative that physicians are forewarned about the risks associated with ubiquinol-10 depletion.", 
    "7": "Insulin resistance plays an important role not only in the development and progression of diabetes mellitus but also in the establishment of metabolic syndrome. Improvement of insulin resistance is thus of great importance both in improving glucose metabolism and preventing atherosclerosis. Although HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors appear to favorably affect glucose metabolism, as indicated by the results of a subanalysis in the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS), their effects on glucose metabolism and insulin resistance have not been thoroughly investigated in animal models. In this study, the effects of atorvastatin on the glucose metabolism and insulin resistance of KK/Ay mice, an animal model of type II diabetes, were investigated. Atorvastatin significantly decreased the non-HDL-cholesterol level in the oral glucose tolerance test, inhibited increase in the 30-min glucose level, decreased plasma insulin levels before and 30 and 60 minutes after glucose loading, and decreased the insulin resistance index, compared with corresponding values in controls, indicating that atorvastatin appeared to improve glucose metabolism by improving insulin resistance. Northern blot analysis revealed decreases in levels of mRNA of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), and it may play a role in the improvement of glucose metabolism and insulin resistance.", 
    "8": "Comparisons of the relation of diet with coronary heart disease (CHD) between countries with similar socioeconomic environments have been few. Patients in Australia and New Zealand (n = 9014) who participated in a large secondary prevention trial had significantly different CHD mortality rates.",

    "11": "Within the entire cohort of 9014 patients, the New Zealanders had significantly (40%) more cardiovascular deaths than did the Australians. In the subgroup of 1077 patients, the New Zealanders were found at entry to have eaten significantly more total (69.34 +/- 12.35 compared with 66.45 +/- 12.9 g/d) and saturated (26.23 +/- 8.41 compared with 24.37 +/- 7.36 g/d) fat (P < 0.001 for each) and to have significantly (4%) higher concentrations of LDL cholesterol (3.96 +/- 0.74 compared with 3.8 +/- 0.76 mmol/L; P < 0.001) than did the Australians. At baseline, patients with previous coronary artery bypass grafting had diets that were significantly different from those of patients without previous coronary artery bypass grafting. Relations between nutrients and plasma lipids confirmed the direct effects of saturated fatty acids on LDL cholesterol and of alcohol on plasma triacylglycerol and HDL cholesterol. Dietary counseling throughout the trial led to significant improvements in compliance with guidelines. However, neither the baseline nor the improved 1-y nutrient intakes predicted future changes in cardiovascular events.",

    "13": "The HIV-1 protease inhibitors (PIs) are widely used in combination antiretroviral therapy for the management of HIV-1 infection. Certain characteristics of the PIs, in particular their metabolism being mainly via the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme group and their gastric absorption being pH dependent, make them prone to clinically significant drug interactions with other antiretrovirals, concomitant medication and complementary treatments. Owing to the nature of the disease, individuals with HIV are frequently prescribed complex treatment regimens (both for the management of intolerance, toxicity and viral resistance to antiretroviral therapy, and in the management of co-morbid states) that may interact with PI therapy. For many of these potential interactions, few data are available. This review will focus on the current use of PIs, highlighting some important management issues encountered with common pharmacokinetic interactions seen in clinical practice.", 
    "14": "In late 2004, the British government decided to allow a lipid-lowering agent to be sold as an over-the-counter medication. In contrast, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently decided not to do so. The United States and other countries will soon face similar decisions for other statins. Although statins have infrequent side effects and have been shown to be effective in moderate-risk primary prevention populations, many questions remain unanswered about their effectiveness at lower doses in over-the-counter use, the ability of patients to self-select themselves for appropriate therapy, and the social and economic implications associated with this method of distribution for preventive medications. A rational policy decision concerning over-the-counter statin use will require an effectiveness trial to provide data on how such drugs would be used in this context, as well as on the clinical outcomes that could be expected from this novel \"route of administration.\"", 
    "15": "Drugs in the same class are generally thought to be therapeutically equivalent because of similar mechanisms of action (the so-called \"class effect\"). However, statins differ in multiple characteristics, including liver and renal metabolism, half-life, effects on several serum lipid components, bioavailability and potency. Some are fungal derivatives, and others are synthetic compounds. The percentage absorption of an oral dose, amount of protein binding, degree of renal excretion, hydrophilicity, and potency on a weight basis is variable. These differences may be even greater in diabetic patients, who may present diabetes-induced abnormalities in P450 isoforms and altered hepatic metabolic pathways. Thus, it is obvious that head-to-head comparisons between different statins are preferable than trial-to-trial comparisons. Such assessments are of utmost importance, especially in cases in which specific populations with a distinct lipid profile and altered metabolic pathways, like diabetics, are studied. It should be specially pinpointed that patients with metabolic syndrome and diabetes constitute also a special population regarding their atherogenic dyslipidemia, which is usually associated with low HDL-cholesterol, hypertriglyceridemia and predominance of small dense LDL-cholesterol. Therefore, these patients may benefit from fibrates or combined statin/fibrate treatment. This policy is not accomplished since in the real world things are more complex. Trials would require very large sample sizes and long-term follow-up to detect significant differences in myocardial infarction or death between two different statins. Moreover, the fact that new compounds are under several phases of research and development represents an additional drawback for performing the trials. Ideally, head-to-head trials regarding clinically important outcomes should be conducted for all drugs. Nonetheless, the desirability of performing such trials, which epitomize modern evidence-based medicine, is frequently superseded by the feasibility dictated by pragmatic and economic circumstances. In the latter case, in absence of solid systematic documentation of comparable health benefits and long-term safety, both researchers and practicing physicians should allude to the weight of scientific endorsement behind the arguments and seek for the possible strengths and weaknesses intrinsic to each specific study. In any case, conclusions based on surrogate endpoints cannot completely substitute head-to-head comparisons regarding patients' outcome.", 
    "16": "Statins block expression of protein subunits of Gi-proteins (p22phox and gp91phox) which determine oxidase activity of NADPH oxidases and expression of GTP-ase (NADPH activator). This leads to suppression of activity of prooxidant enzyme systems (NADPH oxidase, xanthine oxidase, oxidase activity of endothelial NO-synthase) and diminishment of production of most aggressive free radicals -- superoxide anion and peroxinitrite. Hyperproduction of these radicals is associated with lowering of nitric oxide (NO) level and augmented NO destruction, the state of oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction. Statins increase expression of enzymes with antioxidant properties (catalases, paroxonases), augment resistance of low density lipoproteins to oxidation, decrease take up of oxidized low density lipoproteins by monocytes and differentiation of monocytes into macrophages at the account of suppression of cellular scavenger receptor CD36 gene expression. Thus statins are powerful antioxidants.", 
    "17": "Statins and angiotensin II type I receptor blockers have synergistic effects on vascular smooth-muscle-cell proliferation and the progression of renal diseases. We evaluated whether combined treatment with losartan (LSRT) and pravastatin (PRVT) affords superior protection compared with their respective monotherapies in treating chronic cyclosporine (CsA)-induced nephropathy in rats.", 
    "18": "Rats maintained on a low salt diet were given vehicle, CsA (15 mg/kg), CsA and LSRT (10 mg/kg), CsA and PRVT (5 mg/kg), or a combination of CsA, LSRT, and PRVT for 28 days. Basic parameters (renal function, systolic blood pressure, serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP], and lipid profiles), histopathology (arteriolopathy, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and inflammatory cell infiltration), and inflammatory and fibrotic factors (intrarenal CRP, angiotensin II, osteopontin, and transforming growth factor [TGF]-beta1) were studied.", 
    "19": "LSRT or PRVT treatment significantly attenuated the histopathologic changes induced by CsA, and combined treatment with LSRT and PRVT further decreased these parameters compared with giving each drug alone. Increased levels of angiotensin II, intrarenal CRP, osteopontin, and TGF-beta1 in CsA-treated rat kidney were reduced by treatment with either LSRT or PRVT and were further decreased by the combination of the two drugs. There were no significant differences in systolic blood pressure or serum lipid parameters between groups.", 
    "20": "Combined treatment with LSRT and PRVT provided synergistic effects in attenuating inflammatory and fibrotic processes in a rat model of chronic CsA-induced nephropathy, and this effect was independent of their hypolipidemic and hypotensive actions.", 
    "21": "Inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase are antilipidemic agents (statins) widely used for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Recent studies have suggested that the overall benefits of statin therapy cannot be accounted for solely by its antilipidemic effect. To obtain further insight into the mechanism of action of statins, we studied the effect of pitavastatin on the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by peritoneal polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) obtained from control and hyperlipidemic guinea pigs. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the amount of ROS generated by PMN from the hyperlipidemic animals that had been administered a laurate-containing diet (LD) for 4 weeks was larger than that from the normal diet (ND) group (837% increase, ND; 82.17 arbitrary units, LD; 688.10 arbitrary units, P < 0.01, n = 6). Administration of pitavastatin to the LD group significantly decreased plasma levels of total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) with a reduction in ROS generation by PMN (19% decrease, LD control; 688.10 arbitrary units, LD + pitavastatin; 556.87 arbitrary units, P < 0.01, n = 6). Western blotting analysis revealed that the expression of protein kinase C alpha (PKC alpha) and betaI was higher in PMN from the LD group than in PMN from the ND group (PKC alpha; 74% increase, PKC betaI; 339% increase, P < 0.05, n = 4, respectively). Furthermore, expression of NADPH oxidase gp91phox in PMN from the LD group was higher than that in PMN from the ND group (18% increase, P < 0.05, n = 4). By administration of pitavastatin to the LD group, the expression of PKC alpha, betaI and gp91phox was suppressed compared with the control LD group (PKC alpha; 41% decrease, PKC beta; 28% decrease, gp91phox; 56% decrease, P < 0.05, n = 4, respectively). These results indicate that PMN from hyperlipidemic animals is associated with an accelerated respiratory burst of ROS by increasing the expression of PKC alpha, betaI and gp91phox, and pitavastatin inhibits this by suppressing the expression of those proteins.", 
    "22": "The effect of fosmidomycin and mevinoline, inhibitors of the nonmevalonate and the mevalonate pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis, respectively, on the growth of 34 anaerobic and 10 aerobic prokaryotic strains was studied. Fosmidomycin at the concentrations used was shown to inhibit the growth of 9 (of 10) representatives of the family Microbacteriaceae, 4 (of 5) strains of Thermoanaerobacter, and 11 (of 12) strains of Clostridium, whereas mevinoline inhibited the growth of lactobacilli (Carnobacterium), methanogenic and sulfate-reducing bacteria insensitive to fosmidomycin. During the late growth phase, four strains of actinobacteria (of nine) accumulate the compound, which, upon oxidation, generates a long-lived free radical; three strains synthesize 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-2,4-cyclopyrophosphate (MEC). It was concluded that the difference in the sensitivity of the organisms to fosmidomycin and mevinoline might serve as a test to differentiate several representatives of the family Microbacteriaceae. The use of mevinoline for inhibiting methanogens in ecological investigations seems to be promising.", 
    "23": "Statins reduce serum cholesterol and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The mechanisms for these beneficial effects are reviewed. Altered inflammatory responses and improved endothelial function mediated by statins are thought to be partly responsible for the reduction of morbidity and mortality as a result of cardiovascular events. In analogy, whether statins confer similar benefits on the kidney has not been established. This review critically considers the available data whereby dyslipidemia mediates renal dysfunction by modulating the inflammatory response to diverse cytokines. Also reviewed is the emerging database indicating that statins may modulate renal function by altering the response of the kidney to dyslipidemia.", 
    "24": "According to the amyloid cascade hypothesis, sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) is caused by the production and aggregation of beta-amyloid (Abeta), and the production of Abeta has recently been linked to the metabolism of cholesterol. We have previously published clinical studies where the effect of statin treatment on Abeta production has been investigated. No effect on Abeta was found, which is in disagreement with cell and animal studies. In the present study we investigated the effect of statin treatment on a disease-specific pattern consisting of a C-terminally-truncated quintet of Abeta peptides. Nineteen patients with AD were treated with simvastatin for 12 months and the quintet of Abeta peptides were analysed in cerebrospinal fluid before and after treatment. Also included was a group of 15 untreated patients with AD. We found that the Abeta peptide pattern at baseline was in agreement with earlier findings; however, we did not find any change in the Abeta peptide pattern after statin treatment. We suggest that clinical studies with extended treatment periods are performed where higher dosages of statins are used. We also believe that the pleiotropic effects of statins should be investigated further in order to elucidate the connection between Alzheimer's disease and statin treatment.", 
    "25": "This study tested the hypothesis that the opportunity to start secondary prevention therapy before discharge after coronary revascularisation is being missed. The study assessed current prescribing practice and identified discrepancies in prescribing for patients managed by surgeons (especially) and cardiologists.", 
    "26": "200 consecutive patients from the Manchester Heart Centre percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass (CABG) registries were identified (100 from each registry) and the notes analysed.

    "27": "After exclusion of two patients with contraindications, 100% (98 of 98) of PCI patients and 92% (90 of 98) CABG patients were prescribed aspirin at discharge. Eight two per cent of eligible PCI patients and 70% of eligible CABG patients were prescribed beta blockers at discharge. Ninety six per cent (96 of 100) of PCI patients and 73% (73 of 100) of CABG patients were prescribed statins of any dose at discharge, (p<0.001). Sixty five per cent of PCI but only 26% of CABG patients were discharged prescribed ACE inhibitors (eligible patients based on HOPE, heart outcomes prevention evaluation trial), (p<0.001).", 
    "28": "Secondary prevention prescription after coronary revascularisation remains suboptimal in all but aspirin use. Patients in the PCI group were statistically more likely to be discharged prescribed a statin or an ACE inhibitor, or both, than patients after CABG. Both interventional cardiologists and (especially) cardiac surgeons must improve their use of secondary prevention therapy.", 
    "29": "Recent observational studies suggest that patients using statins have higher bone densities and lower fracture rates. However, this finding has not been supported by a secondary analysis of a large randomized controlled trial, assessing pravastatin. It has been suggested that the latter finding might be attributable to the failure of pravastatin, which is hydrophilic, to gain access to bone. The recently published TIMI 22 study, which compared pravastatin with more intensive therapy with the bone-active statin, atorvastatin, offers the possibility of re-assessing the effects of these agents, on fractures. This study assessed 4162 patients over a mean period of 24 months, and compared 40 mg of pravastatin daily with 80 mg of atorvastatin daily. There were 30 fractures in the pravastatin group and 31 in the atorvastatin group, producing a relative risk for any fracture of 1.02 (95% CI, 0.62-1.68) in the atorvastatin group. This study has sufficient fractures for a relative risk of fracture of 0.52 to be significant, which is of the order that has been observed in some of the observational studies. These data do not provide any support for the hypothesis that pravastatin and atorvastatin have different effects on fracture, and are consistent with the conclusions from the other controlled trials-that currently available statins do not impact on fracture risk.", 
    "30": "The effects of statins on immune response depend on the inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A (HMG-CoA) reductase and leukocyte function-associated antigen (LFA)-1, which is a ligand of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1. Simvastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor with mild inhibition of LFA-1, induced the production of interleukin (IL)-18, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interferon (IFN)-gamma in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The IL-18 production is located upstream of the cytokine cascade activated by simvastatin. Moreover, simvastatin concentration-dependently inhibited the expression of ICAM-1 and induced the expression of CD40 on monocytes. In the presence of IL-18, simvastatin suppressed the expression of ICAM-1 and CD40 as well as the production of IL-12, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma in PBMC, contributing to the anti-inflammatory effect of simvastatin. The effects of simvastatin were abolished by the addition of the product of the HMG-CoA reductase, mevalonate, indicating the involvement of HMG-CoA reductase in the action of simvastatin.",

The ester percentage was lower in the third than in the first triad (47% vs. 56%; p < 0.01) and lower than in serum triads (70%; p < 0.001). Ratios to cholesterol of non-cholesterol sterols decreased in increasing tissue triads, but were unchanged in serum. A major new observation was that the higher the ratio to cholesterol of the surrogate absorption sterols (cholestanol, campesterol, sitosterol, and avenasterol) in serum, the higher was their ratio also in the carotid artery wall (e.g., r = 0.683 for campesterol). Despite undetectable differences in serum and tissue cholesterol concentrations off and on statins, an additional important novel finding was that statin treatment was associated with increased ratios of the absorption sterols in serum and also in the arterial plaque.",

    "40": "The elderly differ from younger people in the relation of cholesterol to heart disease and mortality. Clinical trial evidence supports epidemiological findings in showing that high cholesterol weakens in its relationship to heart disease with age and loses (and in older age reverses) its relation to mortality. Randomised trial data confirm that lowering cholesterol no longer extends life in the elderly, even those at high risk of heart disease, and no evidence supports the presumption that the impact on all-cause morbidity is any more favourable. These findings increase the importance of statin adverse effects (AEs) in this group. Furthermore, the elderly may be more vulnerable to known AEs, and evidence provides cause for concern that new risks may supervene, including cancer, neurodegenerative disease and heart failure. Physiological evidence regarding the impact of statins on mitochondrial function, and mitochondrial function on ageing, support these concerns. Additionally, the impact of statin AEs (e.g., muscle and cognitive problems) may be amplified in this group. Effects may be misattributed to ageing. Even modestly lower cognitive and physical function in older elderly prognosticates increased disability, hospitalisation, institutionalisation, and mortality. Disability, once present, is less likely to recover. Because the risk for AEs is unattended by evidence of net benefit to the person, the use of statins in the elderly should be undertaken, if at all, with circumspection and close scrutiny for adverse effects.", 
    "41": "The evaluation and management of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) undergoing noncardiac surgery are becoming important medical issues in modern society with the aging of the population and prevalence of CAD. For patients with CAD, medical therapy (beta-blockers, statins), percutaneous coronary artery intervention (PCI) with/without stenting, and coronary artery bypass grafting have been the modalities for management. Although balloon angioplasty is effective in selected patients, bare-metal stents (BMS) require post-PCI antiplatelet therapy for 4-6 weeks delaying noncardiac procedures As recently reported patients with drug-eluting stents (DES) experienced late stentthrombosis due to discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy in the long-term period before noncardiac surgery, suggesting the need for life-long anticoagulant therapy after DES placement. Recently, offpump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) has become a safe and effective procedure for direct coronary revascularization. OPCAB, without cardiopulmonary bypass and its adverse effects, can be performed simultaneously with noncardiac surgery such as carotid endoarterectomy, abdominal aortic aneurysm resection, and peripheral arterial reconstruction. OPCAB is a promising option as a simultaneous or staged procedure for patients with CAD and noncardiac disease.", 
    "42": "The aim of the present study was to develop a chromatographic method for the analysis of atorvastatin, o- and p-hydroxyatorvastatin (acid and lactone forms) in human plasma after administration of atorvastatin at the lowest registered dose (10 mg) in clinical studies. Sample preparation was performed by solid-phase extraction and was followed by separation of the analytes on an HPLC system with a linear gradient and a mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile, water and formic acid. Detection was achieved by tandem mass spectrometry operated in the electrospray positive ion mode. Validation of the method for the compounds for which reference compounds were available (acid forms of atorvastatin, o- and p-hydroxyatorvastatin) showed linearity within the concentration range (0.2-30 ng/ml for atorvastatin acid and p-hydroxyatorvastatin acid, and 0.5-30 ng/ml for o-hydroxyatorvastatin acid) (r2 > or = 0.99, n = 5 for all analytes). Accuracy and precision (evaluated at 0.5, 3 and 30 ng/ml for atorvastatin, p-hydroxyatorvastatin and 1, 3 and 30 ng/ml for o-hydroxyatorvastatin) were both satisfactory. The detection limit was 0.06 ng/ml for atorvastatin and p-hydroxyatorvastatin, and 0.15 ng/ml for o-hydroxyatorvastatin. The method has been successfully applied in a clinical study where atorvastatin, o- and p-hydroxyatorvastatin (both acid and lactone forms) could be detected in a 24-h sampling interval after administration of the lowest registered dose of atorvastatin (10 mg) for one week.",

Left ventricular weight (LVW)/body weight (BW) ratio was determined. The relative expression of myocardium TNF-alpha mRNA was assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Left ventricular myocardium MMPs activities were assessed by Zymography.", 
    "49": "There were no significant differences among the four AMI groups in infarction size (P > 0.05). In comparison with the AMI group, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, LVW/BW all decreased significantly (P < 0.05 - 0.01); while dp/dtmax, dp/dtmin, fractional shortening (FS) and ejection fraction (EF) increased significantly in all three drug-treated groups (P < 0.05 - 0.01); increments of FS, LVEF and dp/dtmax were more evident in the combination group than either the fosinopril or pravastatin group (P < 0.05). The levels of TNF-alpha mRNA in AMI rats treated with fosinopril, pravastatin and their combination reduced 29%, 26% and 33%, respectively (P < 0.01); MMP-2 activity reduced 25%, 30% and 35%, respectively (P < 0.01); MMP-9 activity reduced 20%, 18% and 24%, respectively (P < 0.01). There were no significant differences in other variables among the 3 treatment groups (P > 0.05).",

The combined treatment group yielded better results in the context of improving left ventricular systolic function. These effects could be relevant to the attenuation of increased MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities and left ventricular expression of TNF-alpha.",

Pravastatin (20 mg/d) was prescribed for 16 weeks. The main outcome was the percentage variation in LDL-C concentration relative to baseline. Blood analyses and genotyping were performed centrally. The results indicated that LDL-C decreased by 20.5% (range, +21% to -66%) after pravastatin treatment. Baseline concentration of LDL-C (the higher the concentration, the greater the decrease), lipoprotein (a) levels (the lower the concentration, the greater the response), and Ava II polymorphism of the LDL-receptor gene significantly influenced the hypolipemic effect ( P < .001, P = .014, and P = .004, respectively). These 3 factors combined explained 10.6% of the variation in LDL-C response. Age, sex, smoking habit, alcohol consumption, body mass index, and apolipoprotein E genotype had no significant effect on response. We conclude that baseline levels of LDL-C and lipoprotein (a) together with the Ava II polymorphism of the LDL-receptor gene have a significant influence on the LDL-C response to pravastatin treatment in patients monitored in a standard primary health care outpatient clinic setting.",

While the concentration of this neurotoxic oxysterol decreases with age, 24S-hydroxycholesterol is elevated in Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we examined the effects of 24S-hydroxycholesterol on gene expression in human neural cells, a primary coculture of neurons and glia useful for studying pathogenic mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease. DNA array and Western analysis revealed elevations in the expression of a pro-inflammatory gene family that included beta-amyloid precursor protein, cyclooxygenase-2, cytosolic phospholipase A2 and heat shock protein 70, an effect that was partially suppressed by simvastatin. These data indicate that cholesterol oxides induce atypical gene expression in neural cells that may contribute to the etiology or pathogenesis of inflammatory brain disease.",

The presence of CAC was defined on the basis of total CAC score of > or =100. We used generalized estimating equations to estimate odds ratios for the presence of CAC across quintiles of linolenic acid. The average consumption of dietary linolenic acid was 0.82+/-0.36 g/d for men and 0.69+/-0.29 g/d for women. From the lowest to the highest quintile of linolenic acid, adjusted odds ratios (95% CI) for the presence of CAC were 1.0 (reference), 0.61 (0.42 to 0.88), 0.55 (0.35 to 0.84), 0.57 (0.37 to 0.88), and 0.35 (0.22 to 0.55), respectively (P for trend <0.0001), after we controlled for age, gender, education, family risk group, smoking, fruit and vegetable intake, history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and statin use. When linolenic acid was used as a continuous variable, the multivariate adjusted odds ratio was 0.38 (95% CI, 0.24 to 0.46) per gram of linolenic acid intake.

IM-9 human lymphoblasts (2 x 10(4) cells/cm2) were seeded into tissue culture plates and incubated with five kinds of statins. Statin-treated cells were first incubated with biotin-annexin V, followed by addition of avidin-FITC and propidium iodide, and then subjected to flow cytometry. The fluorescence intensity was enhanced using an avidin-biotin complex system, resulting in successful separate determination of the statin-induced apoptosis and necrosis by flow cytometry, which enabled us to quantitatively evaluate the statin-induced cell damage. Flow cytometric analysis results in the intensity of statin-induced apoptosis in IM-9 cells as follows: atorvastatin cerivastatin>fluvastatin simvastatin>pravastatin. The intensity of statin-induced necrosis in IM-9 cells was expressed as follows: atorvastatin cerivastatin>fluvastatin simvastatin>pravastatin. The total damage of IM-9 cells induced by five kinds of statins were expressed as the sum of both percentages of apoptosis and necrosis as follows: atorvastatin cerivastatin>fluvastatin simvastatin>pravastatin. Our studies show that fluorescence enhancement with avidin-biotin complex is useful for the identification and quantitation of annexin-positive apoptosis cells and thus, the fluorescence-enhanced flow cytometry was shown to be applicable for screening of statins as new anti-leukemia agents.",

A PE Sciex API 3000 tandem mass spectrometer interfaced with a turbo ionspray source was used for mass detection. Compared to solid-phase extraction, liquid-liquid extraction and solid-supported liquid-liquid extraction methods that were developed and previously used in our laboratory, this method reduced the labor cost and was less time consuming in sample preparation, due to the fact that post-extraction solvent evaporation and reconstitution steps were avoided using this microElution solid-phase extraction plate.

    "90": "Statins, the most widely used lipid lowering drugs, have been demonstrated to play a protective role in stroke. Animal studies confirmed the observations obtained in clinical trials and provided additional data on the putative mechanism/s of action underlying this beneficial effect. We have shown that simvastatin reduced the size of the infarct to a different extend, according to the animal model used. Indeed, in the rat neonatal model of hypoxia/ischemia simvastatin affords protection only when is administered before the ischemic insult. In contrast, in adult rats bearing middle cerebral artery occlusion, simvastatin exerted its beneficial effect on brain injury when injected for 3 days either before or after induction of ischemia. Studies carried out to determine the therapeutic window of simvastatin demonstrated that the protective effect is observed after a single dose and when the drug is administered within 3-6 hours after ischemia. Simvastatin-dependent activation of eNOS has been claimed to be one of the main mechanisms responsible for neuroprotection. This hypothesis is confirmed in the adult animal model where eNOS is activated by either pre- or post- simvastatin treatment but is not supported by the data obtained in the neonate where eNOS activity is not affected by drug treatment. These observations suggest that the protective effect of simvastatin on stroke may be mediated by multiple mechanisms as can be expected by its pleiotropic effects.",

However, it has become increasingly apparent that the effects of statins extend well beyond their lipid lowering actions, and these pleiotropic effects have a major role in protecting the myocardium against ischemic injury. There have been a large number of clinical studies demonstrating the safety and efficacy of statins in reducing total mortality as well as many other secondary endpoint markers in patients with cardiovascular disease. In addition, statins appear to benefit patients with a variety of clinical conditions such as acute coronary syndromes and severe heart failure. Recent experimental studies demonstrated that stains can rapidly (i.e. within hours) upregulate endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity and nitric oxide (NO) production. These landmark studies of statins and eNOS function set the foundation for the investigation of the protective effects of statins. Many experimental studies investigating the effects of statins on eNOS and cardiac injury in the setting of ischemia and reperfusion have been performed in an attempt to determine the extent of the protection as well as the mechanism of the protection. This review article will focus on our current understanding of statin-mediated protection of the myocardium against ischemia-reperfusion injury and infarction.",

This effect was inhibited by diltiazem and mevalonate, but not by the Rho-kinase inhibitor, Y-27632. Simvastatin prevented contraction induced by phenylephrine, calcium ionophore A-23187 and CaCl2 in Ca2+-free medium. Y-27632 decreased the effect of simvastatin. On the contrary, contraction induced by noradrenaline in Ca2+-free medium was not affected.

Although plasma Abeta42 is not useful for diagnosis of AD, it might be a biological risk factor. In the elderly population a considerable variety of concomitant medication is used for the treatment of various disorders. How this co-medication might influence Abeta42 levels is still to be investigated. Through the Vienna Transdanube Aging study (VITA), the authors measured cross-sectional Abeta42 plasma levels during the initial examination of 526 individuals aged 75 years without dementia. The medication considered included: treatment with calcium channel blockers, digitalis, anticoagulants, antihistamines, ergotamine, histamine H(2) receptor antagonists, bronchodilators, pentoxyfilline, neuroleptics, insulin, oral antidiabetics, l-dopa, benzodiazepines, oestrogen, Gingko biloba, vitamins, piracetam, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and statins. Of the study population aged 75 years, 90% were users of some of the above-mentioned medication. Depending on their medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA), users of insulin showed significantly increased levels of Abeta42, while users of gingko biloba for at least 2 years of drug intake had significantly decreased Abeta42 plasma levels, independent of their MTA. Users of NSAIDs showed a non-significant trend to reduced Abeta42 plasma levels, while users of biguanides showed an increase in Abeta42 plasma levels. In the multiple regression analysis considering possible interactions between various medications statin users showed a significant decrease of Abeta42; insulin users had again significantly higher and long-term gingko biloba users lower plasma Abeta42 levels. Persons with a low degree of MTA had significantly increased Abeta42 plasma levels. Considering the increase of Abeta42 plasma levels as a risk factor for AD, any changes induced by medication by long-term use in the peripheral and possibly also in the central compartment, could be of clinical relevance.",

In rare cases, side effects occur in skeletal muscle, including myositis or even rhabdomyolysis. However, the molecular mechanisms are not well understood that lead to these muscle-specific side effects. Here, we show that statins cause apoptosis in differentiated human skeletal muscle cells. The prototypical representative of statins, simvastatin, triggered sustained intracellular Ca(2+) transients, leading to calpain activation. Intracellular chelation of Ca(2+) completely abrogated cell death. Moreover, ryanodine also completely prevented the simvastatin-induced calpain activation. Nevertheless, an activation of the ryanodine receptor by simvastatin could not be observed. Downstream of the calpain activation simvastatin led to a translocation of Bax to mitochondria in a caspase 8-independent manner. Consecutive activation of caspase 9 and 3 execute apoptotic cell death that was in part reversed by the coadministration of mevalonic acid. Conversely, the simvastatin-induced activation of calpain was not prevented by mevalonic acid. These data delineate the signaling cascade that leads to muscle injury caused by statins. Our observations also have implications for improving the safety of this important medication and explain to some extent why physical exercise aggravates skeletal muscle side effects.",

According to the classification guide of Hawksworth and Pitt on Monascus genus, they belong to Monascus pilosus Sato. The conditions of solid state fermentation of M12-69 were optimized. At the optimum conditions, the concentrations of monacolin K and citrinin in RFR, which was dried at 50 degrees C to a constant weight, were 2.52 mg/g and 0.13 ng/g, respectively.

Based on the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines, therapy for dyslipidemia is focused initially on targeting low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC), and in patients with hypertriglyceridemia, secondarily on targeting non-HDLC. When HDLC remains low, the decision to target HDLC depends on the assessment of risk of cardiovascular events. We often consider drug therapy specifically to raise HDLC in high-risk patients, such as those with established atherosclerotic vascular disease, type 2 diabetes, or a Framingham risk score of 20% or above. The majority of high-risk patients require drug therapy, usually a statin, to achieve aggressive LDLC and non-HDLC goals, and thus many patients with low HDLC are candidates for statin therapy. However, a second drug is often required to achieve substantial HDL raising. Although no formal goals for HDLC exist, reasonable goals are HDLC greater than 40 mg/dL in men and greater than 50 mg/dL in women. We often add either niacin or a fibrate to a statin in high-risk patients with low HDLC levels. Targeting HDLC with pharmacologic therapy is a more difficult decision in moderate-risk patients, in whom therapy must be highly individualized.",

We tested whether the age-related decrease in PPARalpha is prevented by atorvastatin (ATV), a hypolipidemic statin. We determined the activity and expression of Liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha) and PPARalpha in the liver of 18-month-old rats treated with 10 mg kg(-1) of ATV for 21 days. We measured fatty acid oxidation (FAO), the expression of PPARalpha-target genes, liver triglyceride (TG) and cholesteryl ester (CE) contents and plasma concentrations of TG, cholesterol, glucose, nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA), insulin and leptin. While old female rats were practically unresponsive, ATV-treated old males showed lower liver TG (-41%) and CE (-48%), and plasma TG (-35%), glucose (-18%) and NEFA (-39%). Age-related alterations in LXRalpha expression and binding activity were reverted in ATV-treated old males. These changes were related to an increase in hepatic FAO (1.2-fold), and PPARalpha mRNA (2.2-fold), PPARalpha protein (1.6-fold), and PPARalpha-binding activity. Hepatic nuclear factor-4 (HNF-4) and chicken ovalbumin upstream-transcription factor-II participate in the transcriptional regulation of the PPARalpha gene, while peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1 (PGC-1) behaves as a PPAR coactivator. Ageing reduced the hepatic content of HNF-4 (74%) and PGC-1 (77%) exclusively in male rats. ATV administration to old males enhanced the hepatic expression and binding activity (two-fold) of HNF-4. ATV-induced changes in hepatic HNF-4 and PPARalpha may be responsible for the improvement of the lipid metabolic phenotype produced by ATV administration to senescent male rats.",

This suggests that variation in the cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase gene (CYP7A1), a key enzyme in bile-acid biosynthesis, may influence the statin response. To test this hypothesis, a promoter polymorphism (A-204C) in CYP7A1 was examined in 324 hypercholesterolemic patients treated with atorvastatin 10mg.

The epidemiologic evidence is complimented by clinical data showing that interventions that raise HDL-C are associated with reductions in CHD risk, as well as by a growing body of experimental data demonstrating biologically plausible mechanisms that may underlie the observed clinical findings. Analyses of large statin trials also indicate that the significant and independent relationship between HDL-C and CHD risk persists despite the therapeutic effects of statins, and that HDL-C levels in statin-treated patients, both at baseline and in response to statin therapy, are relevant. Early studies on novel HDL targeting therapies are promising, but their long term safety profile and impact on clinical outcomes is yet to be determined in larger studies. Recent guidelines emphasize low HDL-C as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease, specifically identify HDL-C as a target for intervention, and encourage the use of HDL-C raising interventions in high-risk patients with low HDL-C levels.",

    "177": "Improvement of endothelial function caused by statin treatment is not related to lowering of the cholesterol levels but results primarily from statin pleiotropic effects. Accordingly, we designed a pilot study in 10 normocholesterolaemic and 10 hypercholesterolaemic patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease to investigate potential biological effects of statins in relation to their effects on endothelial function. The patients were treated with simvastatin 40 mg/daily for 3 months. Simvastatin led to significant reduction in total cholesterol and trigliceride levels in normocholesterolaemic and hypercholesterolaemic patients. Elongation of pain-free and total walking distance was observed in both groups studied. Inconsiderable changes in rest ankle brachial index were seen. Flow-mediated dilation increased in normocholesterolaemic group by 153% and in the hypercholesterolaemic group by 180% after 3 months of treatment. Euglobulin clot lysis time was shortened significantly in both groups each time after drug intake. Platelet aggregates ratio was increased in normocholesterolaemic patients by 8.9% and in hypercholesterolaemic patients by 17.6% each time after intake and remained significantly increased during the observation after 1 and 3 months. Simvastatin inhibited platelet aggregation induced by collagen and ADP in both study groups 3 hr after intake, but the platelets of hypercholesterolaemic patients were less sensitive to these aggregatory agents after 3 months of treatment. Simvastatin therapy caused clinical improvement in normocholesterolaemic and hypercholesterolaemic patients with peripheral occlusive disease. It is suggested that this effect is due to the restoration of endothelial function.",

After the introduction of the NSF in-hospital mortality was significantly reduced (95 patients (4.8%) v 43 (3.2%), p = 0.02). This was associated with a reduction in the development of Q wave myocardial infarction (40.6% v 33.3%, p < 0.0001) and in the incidence of left ventricular failure (15.9% v 12.3%, p = 0.003).

We hypothesized that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors decrease exocytosis of Weibel-Palade bodies, endothelial cell granules whose contents promote thrombosis and vascular inflammation. We pretreated human aortic endothelial cells with simvastatin for 24 hours, then stimulated the cells with thrombin, and measured the amount of vWF released into the media. We then measured the effect of simvastatin on myocardial infarction in mice. Simvastatin decreased thrombin-stimulated Weibel-Palade body exocytosis by 89%. Simvastatin inhibited exocytosis in part by increasing synthesis of nitric oxide (NO), which S-nitrosylated N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor (NSF), a critical regulator of exocytosis. Simvastatin treatment attenuated myocardial infarct size by 58% in wild-type but not eNOS knockout mice. Furthermore, simvastatin decreased endothelial exocytosis and neutrophil infiltration into ischemic-reperfused myocardium, which was mediated in part by P-selectin contained in Weibel-Palade bodies. However, simvastatin did not affect exocytosis and inflammation in myocardial infarcts of eNOS knockout mice. Inhibition of endothelial exocytosis is a novel mechanism by which HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may reduce vascular inflammation, inhibit thrombosis, and protect the ischemic myocardium. These findings may explain part of the pleiotropic effects of statin therapy for patients with cardiovascular disease.", 
    "184": "The 3' poly(A) tail is important in messenger RNA stability and translational efficiency. In somatic tissues, 3' polyadenylation of mRNAs has been thought to largely be a constitutively active process. We have reported that laminar shear stress causes a brief increase in endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) transcription, followed by a prolonged increase in eNOS mRNA stability. We sought to determine whether shear stress and other stimuli affected eNOS 3' polyadenylation in endothelial cells. Under basal (static) conditions, eNOS mRNA possessed short 3' poly(A) tails of <25 nt. In contrast, laminar shear stress increased expression of eNOS transcripts with long poly(A) tails. ENOS transcripts with longer poly(A) tails had prolonged half-lives (6 hours in static cells versus 18 hours in sheared cells). Polysome analysis revealed that eNOS mRNA from sheared cells was shifted into more translationally active polysome fractions compared with eNOS mRNA from static cells. Shear-induced lengthening of the eNOS 3' poly(A) tail was the result of increased nuclear polyadenylation. Furthermore, hydrogen peroxide and HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors, other stimuli known to modulate eNOS expression posttranscriptionally, also induced eNOS 3' poly(A) tail lengthening. These results support the concept that shear stress modulates eNOS mRNA stability and translation via increased 3' polyadenylation. We suggest that mRNA 3' polyadenylation is a posttranscriptional mechanism used by endothelial cells to regulate gene expression.", 
    "185": "mRNA transcripts encoding multiple proteins from the cholesterol biosynthetic and uptake pathways in livers are controlled by sterol regulatory element binding protein-2 (SREBP-2), a membrane-bound mammalian transcription factor. The aims of the present study were to investigate whether SREBP-2 responds to plasma cholesterol levels and modulates expression of factors involved in the cholesterol metabolism of chickens. Supplementing the diets of chickens with 0.1% pravastatin, a drug used to control hypercholesterolemia, decreased plasma LDL-cholesterol concentrations. It also increased levels of the nuclear forms of SREBP-2 and increased gene expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMGR) and low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLr) in livers, relative to a control group. In contrast, feeding of 3% cholesterol-supplemented diet increased plasma total- and LDL-cholesterol concentrations but decreased levels of nuclear forms of SREBP-2 and reduced gene expression of HMGR and LDLr. However, the LDL-binding activities of chicken liver membranes were not affected by plasma cholesterol concentrations or by hepatic levels of the nuclear form of SREBP-2. LDL-binding proteins were detected as bands of 90 and 515 kDa on a ligand blot and the intensity of these bands was unaffected by pravastatin and cholesterol supplementation. These findings suggest that the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway is regulated by the nuclear form of SREBP-2 in chickens as well as in mammals, but that there may be species-specific differences in the regulatory mechanisms of hepatic cholesterol uptake.", 
    "186": "Statin therapy decreases low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and the risk of coronary heart disease but has a considerable short-term effect on health care budgets. The cost effectiveness of rosuvastatin (Crestor) has been compared with those of atorvastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin in lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and achieving National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals. The analysis was conducted from the perspective of health care payers in the United States. Clinical data were obtained from the Statin Therapies for Elevated Lipid Levels Compared Across Doses to Rosuvastatin (STELLAR) trial. Drug costs were based on wholesale acquisition costs. Cost effectiveness was assessed with the net monetary benefit approach and a 1-year time horizon. Rosuvastatin at 10 mg, the recommended starting dose, was the most cost-effective statin over a large range of \"willingness-to-pay\" values for a unit of clinical effect (i.e., a 1% decrease in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol or a patient achieving the goal).", 
    "187": "We investigated whether change in coronary artery atherosclerosis as measured by quantitative coronary angiography is related to cardiovascular event risk. Although many studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of statins in decreasing atherosclerotic progression and cardiovascular event risk, a relation between coronary atherosclerotic progression and event risk has not been documented in clinical trials that have evaluated statin therapy. The Monitored Atherosclerosis Regression Study (MARS) was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to test whether lovastatin would decrease coronary atherosclerotic progression as measured by quantitative coronary angiography. We followed 173 subjects in the MARS who had minimum luminal diameter and percent diameter stenosis measured at the beginning and end of a 2-year intervention. Postintervention follow-up events over a mean period of 9.4 years were reported by subjects and verified by medical records. Two-year percent stenosis and minimum luminal diameter changes were tested in relation to clinical event risk in multivariate Cox's regression models. Events ascertained were (1) coronary death and myocardial infarction, (2) coronary death, myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass grafting, and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty, and (3) any cardiovascular event. Increased percent stenosis was associated with significantly increased hazard ratios (HRs) in all event categories (category 1 HR 1.55 per SD percent stenosis, p <0.01; category 2 HR 1.58, p <0.01; category 3 HR 1.47, p = 0.01). Conversely, event risks were decreased for subjects who had increased minimum luminal diameter (category 1 HR 0.79, p = 0.04) and were not associated with category 2 (HR 0.79, p = 0.12) or category 3 (HR 0.81, p = 0.17). These results indicate that quantitative coronary angiographic changes are associated with cardiovascular events and support the long-term benefit of early intervention to decrease atherosclerosis."
