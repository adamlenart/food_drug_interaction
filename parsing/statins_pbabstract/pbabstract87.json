This study sought to investigate the effects of inflammation on the no-reflow phenomenon in a rabbit model of acute myocardial infarction and reperfusion (AMI/R) and to evaluate the effects of single-dose atorvastatin on inflammation and myocardial no-reflow. Twenty-four New Zealand white male rabbits (5-6 months old) were randomized to three groups of eight: a sham-operated group, an AMI/R group, and an atorvastatin-treated group (10 mg/kg). Animals in the latter two groups were subjected to 4 h of coronary occlusion followed by 2 h of reperfusion. Serum levels of interleukin (IL)-6 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The expression of interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3) in normal and infarcted (reflow and no-reflow) myocardial tissue was determined by immunohistochemical methods. The area of no-reflow and necrosis was evaluated pathologically. Levels of serum IL-6 were significantly lower in the atorvastatin group than in the AMI/R group (P<0.01). Expression of IFN-\u03b3 in infarcted reflow and no-reflow myocardial tissue was also significantly lower in the atorvastatin group than in the AMI/R group. The mean area of no-reflow [47.01% of ligation area (LA)] was significantly smaller in the atorvastatin group than in the AMI/R group (85.67% of LA; P<0.01). The necrosis area was also significantly smaller in the atorvastatin group (85.94% of LA) than in the AMI/R group (96.56% of LA; P<0.01). In a secondary analysis, rabbits in the atorvastatin and AMI/R groups were divided into two groups based on necrosis area (90% of LA): a small group (<90% of LA) and a large group (>90% of LA). There was no significant difference in the area of no-reflow between the small (61.40% of LA) and large groups (69.87% of LA; P>0.05). Single-dose atorvastatin protected against inflammation and myocardial no-reflow and reduced infarct size during AMI/R in rabbits. No-reflow was not dependent on the reduction of infarct size.",

    "18": "The Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) organization developed clinical practice guidelines on lipid management for all adults and children with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Thirteen recommendations were obtained from the available evidence outlining a three-step management including assessment in all, treatment in many, and follow-up measurements in few. A key element is the recommendation of statin or statin/ezetimibe treatment in adults aged \u2a7e50 years with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60\u2009ml/min per 1.73\u2009m(2) but not treated with chronic dialysis or kidney transplantation. In dialysis patients, the magnitude of any relative reduction in risk appears to be substantially smaller than in earlier stages of CKD and initiation of statin treatment is not recommended for most prevalent hemodialysis patients. In the past, clinical practice guidelines suggested the use of targets for LDL cholesterol, which require repeated measurements. Treatment escalation with higher doses of statin would be a consequence when LDL cholesterol targets are not met. The KDIGO Work Group did not recommend this strategy because higher doses of statins have not been proven to be safe in the setting of CKD. Since LDL cholesterol levels do not necessarily suggest the need to increase statin doses, follow-up measurement of lipid levels is not recommended.", 
    "19": "Prediabetes is the most important risk factor for developing type-2 diabetes mellitus, an important and growing epidemic. Prediabetes is often associated with comorbidities including hypercholesterolemia. While statin drugs are indicated to treat hypercholesterolemia, recent reports suggest a possible increased risk of developing overt diabetes associated with the use of statins. Association rule mining is a data mining technique capable of identifying interesting relationships between risks and treatments. However, it is limited in its ability to accurately calculate the effect of a treatment, as it does not appropriately account for bias and confounding. We propose a novel combination of propensity score matching and association rule mining to account for this bias, and find meaningful associations between a treatment and outcome for various subpopulations. We demonstrate this technique on a real diabetes data set examining the relationship between statin use and diabetes, and identify risk and protective factors previously not clearly defined.",

In contrast, high-affinity transport of fexofenadine was only modestly inhibited by GFJ, while significant inhibition of the low-affinity site was observed. Contribution analysis indicated that both drugs are transported via the low-affinity site on OATP2B1 at therapeutically relevant concentrations. These findings indicate that only fexofenadine is expected to interact with GFJ on OATP2B1 at therapeutic concentrations, in accordance with the clinical observations.",

Additions of inter-occasional variability to the absorption parameters significantly improved the model's fit. The disposition parameter estimates were significantly different when different absorption models were applied, indicating the importance of the appropriate absorption modeling. Pharmacokinetic modeling preferred the inter-conversion between simvastatin and simvastatin acid.",

    "33": "Regardless of its effect on the concentrations of serum cholesterol, statins exert pleiotropic effects, including the regulation of endothelial function, reduced oxidative stress and inflammation, as well as a slight improvement in the concentrations of high density lipoprotein (HDL). However, its role on the composition of HDL is not yet established. The aim of this study was to evaluate the composition of HDL subfractions, HDLsub>2 and HDL3, after 14 days of placebo and atorvastatin (10 mg/day) use in 30 asymptomatic volunteers. The serum parameters and the HDL subfractions compositions were determined using radiometric, nephelometric and biochemical enzymatic methods. We observed significant reductions of total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) and apolipoprotein B-100 by 28%, 40% and 38%, respectively. The analyses of chemical composition of the subfractions revealed a lower lipid protein ratio in HDL2, suggesting enrichment in proteins, and also lower in HDL3, probably by an increase in the number of particles. Several mechanisms can be suggested for the effects observed after the use of atorvastatin, such as a possible action on the reverse cholesterol transport (decreased activity of hepatic lipase and increased phospholipid transfer protein, PLTP), which would explain the enrichment of HDL. The results suggest that statin use may be relevant in the primary prevention of atherosclerosis not only by its lowering effect on LDLcholesterol and its anti-inflammatory effect but also by beneficial changes in HDL subfractions.", 
    "34": "The clinical benefits of statins are strongly related to their low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering properties. However, considering that the pharmacological target of statins, the 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-3-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, is one of the upstream enzyme of the mevalonate pathway, its inhibition may determine a substantial impoverishment of additional lipid moieties required for a proper cellular function. From this hypothesis, several experimental and clinical evidences have been reported indicating additional effects of statins beyond the LDL-C lowering, in particular anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. Thus statin therapy, indicated for hyperlipidemic patients for primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD) has begun to be considered effective in other diseases not necessarily linked to altered lipid profile. In the present review we summarized the current clinical evidence of the efficacy and safety profile of statins in a variety of diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, venous thromboembolism, liver diseases, polycystic ovary syndrome, and age-related macular degeneration. As discussed in the review, pending large, well designed, randomized trials, it is reasonable to conclude that there is no definitive evidence for the use of statins in the aforementioned diseases.",

The apparent risk did decline over time as might be expected from a pharmacokinetic mechanism. Fenofibrate was a potent in vitro inhibitor of CYP2C19 (IC50 = 0.2\u2009\u03bcm) and CYP2B6 (IC50 = 0.7\u2009\u03bcm) and a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C9 (IC50 = 9.7\u2009\u03bcm). The predicted CYP-based AUCRs for fenofibrate-glyburide and gemfibrozil-glyburide interactions were only 1.09 and 1.04, suggesting that CYP inhibition is unlikely to explain such an interaction.", 
    "38": "Use of fenofibrate or gemfibrozil together with glyburide was associated with elevated overall risks of serious hypoglycaemia. CYP inhibition seems unlikely to explain this observation.

Moving away from \"one-size-fits-all\" medicine, personalized medicine seemed to have the potential of tailoring therapies to subsets of patients. Despite the rapid progress in drug development for diabetes, it is still challenging to achieve good glycemic control in a substantial population. Different diabetes management algorithms have been proposed: most agree with a HbA1c target of <7.0 % for the majority of people with diabetes, except the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) that claims for a lower HbA1c target (<6.5 %). The recently released American guidelines on the treatment of blood cholesterol recommends moderate-intensity statin therapy for primary prevention for persons aged 40-75 years with type 1 or 2 diabetes and LDL-cholesterol levels between 70 and 189 mg/dl. The Eighth Joint National Committee recommends pharmacologic treatment in the population aged 18 years or older with diabetes, with a goal systolic blood pressure of lower than 140 mmHg and a goal diastolic blood pressure lower than 90 mmHg. There are differences and similarities among these recent guidelines for people with diabetes, with the main differences related to the level of the evidence. There are recommendations based on expert opinions (insufficient evidence or existing evidence unclear or conflicting) in almost all guidelines. The ultimate decision about care of a particular patient is left to clinicians, as the way to manage unavoidable guideline uncertainty: clinician's opinion does matter.",

In keeping with the recent 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Guideline on the treatment of blood cholesterol to reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular risk in adults, the major focus of prevention lies with LDL-cholesterol reduction.", 
    "57": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have been shown to reduce cardiovascular morbidity in patients with normal and abnormal kidney function but not in patients with end-stage kidney disease. Evidence supports a role for statins in delaying the progression of kidney disease in a variety of experimental models in animals. However, the evidence that statins may retard CKD progression in humans is scant. In this review, we critically consider the available data supporting a role for statins in CKD progression in humans and the possibility that there might be differences among statins in regards to effects on the kidneys. Finally, we review the evidence that statins may increase the risk of acute kidney injury.",

Although many risk factors for shoulder pain are postulated, the effects of shoulder pain on functional level and perceived quality of life are poorly characterized in older adults. In this study, we set out to determine the prevalence and impact of shoulder symptoms and dysfunction in an older adult veteran population.", 
    "59": "A chart review, cross-sectional survey, and examination were performed. A sample of 93 individuals, aged 60 years or older, was recruited from a primary clinic outpatient waiting room at the Clement J. Zablocki VA Medical Center in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Patients were asked about shoulder symptoms and self-assessed health and completed the Stanford Modified Health Assessment Questionnaire. A series of 3 shoulder maneuvers was used to assess shoulder mobility and pain. The presence of diabetes and statin use was documented. A more thorough chart review was performed on individuals who reported shoulder pain and disability.", 
    "60": "Severe shoulder pain was common in the study group, reported by 31% of all participants. Functional limitation measured by the Modified Health Assessment Questionnaire and answering \"yes\" to greater difficulty performing daily tasks was associated with reduced internal rotation, which was present in almost 36% of all participants. Symptoms were often bilateral. No statistically significant risk factors emerged in this small sample, but suggestive trends were apparent. Interestingly, few patients reported discussing these problems with their providers, and shoulder-related problems were documented in only 10% of corresponding problem lists of symptomatic patients.",

    "62": "Aspergillus terreus ATCC 20542 was cultivated in various culture media in order to activate its genome-encoded biosynthetic pathways and explore the secondary metabolic repertoire. In addition to mevinolinic acid (lovastatin) and its precursor monacolin L, a number of other secondary metabolites were found in the analyzed cultures, namely terreic acid, citrinin, (+)-geodin, terrein, and dehydrocurvularin. In contrast to previously described gene clusters responsible for production of lovastatin, monacolin L, (+)-geodin and dehydrocurvularin, the gene clusters of A. terreus associated with the formation of terreic acid, citrinin and terrein still await identification. Putative gene clusters potentially related to citrinin and terreic acid biosynthesis were suggested in the publicly available genome of A. terreus NIH 2624. The functions of putative genes in the previously identified cluster of (+)-geodin biosynthesis were predicted by confronting the annotation results with the proposed biosynthetic pathway and published biochemical studies on the underlying enzymes. Since there were no available data regarding genetic aspects of terrein biosynthesis, the candidate gene cluster potentially responsible for the production of terrein was not suggested.",

    "64": "In the review article presented here, we demonstrate that the connective tissue is more than just a matrix for cells and a passive scaffold to provide physical support. The extracellular matrix can be subdivided into proteins (collagen, elastin), glycoconjugates (structural glycoproteins, proteoglycans) and glycosaminoglycans (hyaluronan). Our main focus rests on the anionic biopolyelectrolytes of the perlecan/syndecan superfamily which belongs to extracellular matrix and cell membrane integral proteoglycans. Though the extracellular domain of the syndecans may well be performing a structural role within the extracellular matrix, a key function of this class of membrane intercalated proteoglycans may be to act as signal transducers across the plasma membrane and thus be more appropriately included in the group of cell surface receptors. Nevertheless, there is a continuum in functions of syndecans and perlecans, especially with respect to their structural role and biomedical significance. HS/CS proteoglycans are receptor sites for lipoprotein binding thus intervening directly in lipid metabolism. We could show that among all lipoproteins, HDL has the highest affinity to these proteoglycans and thus instals a feedforward forechecking loop against atherogenic apoB100 lipoprotein deposition on surface membranes and in subendothelial spaces. Therefore, HDL is not only responsible for VLDL/IDL/LDL cholesterol exit but also controls thoroughly the entry. This way, it inhibits arteriosclerotic nanoplaque formation. The ternary complex 'lipoprotein receptor (HS/CS-PG) - lipoprotein (LDL, oxLDL, Lp(a)) - calcium' may be interpreted as arteriosclerotic nanoplaque build-up on the molecular level before any cellular reactivity, possibly representing the arteriosclerotic primary lesion combined with endothelial dysfunction. With laser-based ellipsometry we could demonstrate that nanoplaque formation is a Ca(2+)-driven process. In an in vitro biosensor application of HS-PG coated silica surfaces we tested nanoplaque formation and size in clinical trials with cardiovascular high-risk patients who underwent treatment with ginkgo or fluvastatin. While ginkgo reduced nanoplaque formation (size) by 14.3% (23.4%) in the isolated apoB100 lipid fraction at a normal blood Ca(2+) concentration, the effect of the statin with a reduction of 44.1% (25.4%) was more pronounced. In addition, ginkgo showed beneficial effects on several biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation. Besides acting as peripheral lipoprotein binding receptor, HS/CS-PG is crucially implicated in blood flow sensing. A sensor molecule has to fulfil certain mechanochemical and mechanoelectrical requirements. It should possess viscoelastic and cation binding properties capable of undergoing conformational changes caused both mechanically and electrostatically. Moreover, the latter should be ion-specific. Under no-flow conditions, the viscoelastic polyelectrolyte at the endothelium - blood interface assumes a random coil form. Blood flow causes a conformational change from the random coil state to the directed filament structure state. This conformational transition effects a protein unfurling and molecular elongation of the GAG side chains like in a 'stretched' spring. This configuration is therefore combined with an increase in binding sites for Na(+) ions. Counterion migration of Na(+) along the polysaccharide chain is followed by transmembrane Na(+) influx into the endothelial cell and by endothelial cell membrane depolarization. The simultaneous Ca(2+) influx releases NO and PGI2, vasodilatation is the consequence. Decrease in flow reverses the process. Binding of Ca(2+) and/or apoB100 lipoproteins (nanoplaque formation) impairs the flow sensor function. The physicochemical and functional properties of proteoglycans are due to their amphiphilicity and anionic polyelectrolyte character. Thus, they potently interact with cations, albeit in a rather complex manner. Utilizing (23)Na(+) and (39)K(+) NMR techniques, we could show that, both in HS-PG solutions and in native vascular connective tissue, the mode of interaction for monovalent cations is competition. Mg(2+) and Ca(2+) ions, however, induced a conformational change leading to an increased allosteric, cooperative K(+) and Na(+) binding, respectively. Since extracellular matrices and basement membranes form a tight-fitting sheath around the cell membrane of muscle and Schwann cells, in particular around sinus node cells of the heart, and underlie all epithelial and endothelial cell sheets and tubes, a release of cations from or an adsorption to these polyanionic macromolecules can transiently lead to fast and drastic activity changes in these tiny extracellular tissue compartments. The ionic currents underlying pacemaker and action potential of sinus node cells are fundamentally modulated. Therefore, these polyelectrolytic ion binding characteristics directly contribute to and intervene into heart rhythm.", 
    "65": "Statins are currently able to stabilize atherosclerotic plaques by lowering plasma cholesterol and pleiotropic effects, but a residual risk for atherosclerotic disease remains. Therefore, effective prevention of atherosclerosis and treatment of its complications is still a major clinical challenge. A large body of evidence indicates that mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors such as rapamycin or everolimus have pleiotropic anti-atherosclerotic effects so that these drugs can be used as add-on therapy to prevent or delay the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Moreover, bioresorbable scaffolds eluting everolimus trigger a healing process in the vessel wall, both in pigs and humans, that results in late lumen enlargement and plaque regression. At present, this phenomenon of atheroregression is poorly understood. However, given that mTOR inhibitors suppress cell proliferation and trigger autophagy, a cellular survival pathway and a process linked to cholesterol efflux, we hypothesize that these compounds can inhibit (or reverse) the basic mechanisms that control plaque growth and destabilization. Unfortunately, adverse effects associated with mTOR inhibitors such as dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia have recently been identified. Dyslipidemia is manageable via statin treatment, while the anti-diabetic drug metformin would prevent hyperglycemia. Because metformin has beneficial macrovascular effects, this drug in combination with an mTOR inhibitor might have significant promise to treat patients with unstable plaques. Moreover, both statins and metformin are known to inhibit mTOR via AMPK activation so that they would fully exploit the beneficial effects of mTOR inhibition in atherosclerosis.",

    "74": "Although disruptions in the maintenance of iron and cholesterol metabolism have been implicated in several cancers, the association between variants in the HFE gene that is associated with cellular iron uptake and cholesterol metabolism has not been studied. The C282Y-HFE variant is a risk factor for different cancers, is known to affect sphingolipid metabolism, and to result in increased cellular iron uptake. The effect of this variant on cholesterol metabolism and its possible relevance to cancer phenotype was investigated using wild type (WT) and C282Y-HFE transfected human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Expression of C282Y-HFE in SH-SY5Y cells resulted in a significant increase in total cholesterol as well as increased transcription of a number of genes involved in its metabolism compared to cells expressing WT-HFE. The marked increase in expression of NPC1L1 relative to that of most other genes, was accompanied by a significant increase in expression of NPC1, a protein that functions in cholesterol uptake by cells. Because inhibitors of cholesterol metabolism have been proposed to be beneficial for treating certain cancers, their effect on the viability of C282Y-HFE neuroblastoma cells was ascertained. C282Y-HFE cells were significantly more sensitive than WT-HFE cells to U18666A, an inhibitor of desmosterol \u039424-reductase the enzyme catalyzing the last step in cholesterol biosynthesis. This was not seen for simvastatin, ezetimibe, or a sphingosine kinase inhibitor. These studies indicate that cancers presenting in carriers of the C282Y-HFE allele might be responsive to treatment designed to selectively reduce cholesterol content in their tumor cells.", 
    "75": "Dyslipidemia is highly prevalent among women. The management of dyslipidemia is a cornerstone in the prevention of both primary and secondary cardiovascular events, such as myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and coronary death. All major international guidelines on the treatment of dyslipidemia recommend similar approaches to the management of dyslipidemia in both men and women. Estrogen replacement therapy should not be considered as a therapeutic option for managing dyslipidemia in women. The reduction of atherogenic lipoprotein burden (reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol based on risk-stratified thresholds and treatment targets) provided the framework for managing dyslipidemia in the US, Europe, Canada, and elsewhere in the world. Very recently, new guidelines in the US have changed this paradigm, whereby rather than focusing on treatment targets, risk now defines the intensity of treatment with statin therapy, with no specific goals for what level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol should be attained. It is not clear if this will lead to changes in lipid guidelines in other parts of the world. In the meantime, region-specific guidelines should be followed. Lipid lowering with statin therapy does correlate with reductions in cardiovascular event rates in women. The clinical impact of treating dyslipidemias in women with nonstatin drugs (eg, fibrates, nicotinic acid, bile acid-binding resins, omega-3 fish oils) is as yet not determined.", 
    "76": "RV infections frequently trigger exacerbations of respiratory diseases, such as asthma, yet treatment and intervention options remain limited. Statin drugs are the treatment of choice for dyslipidemia and can also modulate immune cell function. To determine whether statin drugs modify antiviral responses of human monocytic cells, we obtained blood monocytes from donors with allergies and/or asthma and treated the cells with sim prior to challenge with RV. RV-induced secretion of CXCL10 was attenuated significantly, irrespective of RV type (RV-16, -14, or -1A), which corresponded with decreases in IFN-\u03b1 secretion and pSTAT1. Sim pretreatment also reduced RV-induced CXCL10 secretion from human alveolar macrophages. The addition of mev and GGPP-two intermediates of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway-was able to rescue CXCL10 release fully, demonstrating that effects of sim were related to inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis and not to an off-target effect. In addition, sim pretreatment attenuated IFN-\u03b1-induced pSTAT1 and CXCL10 secretion, providing evidence that sim additionally can affect type I IFNR signaling. SOCS1 and 3 mRNA are both induced with RV stimulation, but sim did not elevate SOCS1 or SOCS3 mRNA expression basally or in the presence of RV. Our findings suggest that sim inhibition of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway leads to decreased RV-induced chemokine secretion in monocytes and macrophages. These findings suggest that statin drugs have the potential to curb the inflammatory response to RV infection.", 
    "77": "A high disease prevalence, the presentation in older age, a frequently slowly progressing course of disease, and high costs make diagnosis and therapy of prostate cancer a special challenge for urologists. Effective prevention of the disease may help to resolve some of the problems mentioned above. Two randomised, controlled studies prove that effective chemoprevention of prostate cancer is possible using 5-\u03b1 reductase inhibitors (finasteride, dutasteride) (LoE 1) both in individuals at low and those at high risk developing prostate cancer. Furthermore, there is evidence that other compounds, e.g. selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and statins might also be effective. This review investigates potential risks and benefits of chemoprevention including a consideration of health economic aspects. The authors conclude that chemoprevention in a high risk cohort using 5-\u03b1 reductase inhibitors is a viable option and may even be cost effective. In consequence, the options of chemoprevention in prostate cancer should be further explored in an open and unbiased way.",

Patient assessment of symptoms as ADRs fell into two major themes: medicine-related factors and external factors. Timing relationships were mentioned most frequently (74), followed by information received (55), seeing similar symptoms in others (7) and diagnosis through blood tests (4). Use of multiple medicines, consideration of the medicine versus diseases, symptoms occurring with more than one medicine or relieved through treatment reduced confidence in ADR attribution. Many participants proposed alternative explanations for symptoms, including old age. Lack of information and knowledge were obstacles to the assessment process.",

The diagnosis of RAS was suspected after physical examination revealed an abdominal bruit. Renal ultrasound with Doppler revealed normal appearing kidneys with high velocity in the aorta and renal arteries. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the chest and abdomen demonstrated generalized calcified atherosclerotic narrowing of the arteries including the renal, celiac, superior mesenteric and coronary arteries in the setting of hyperlipidemia. The lipid panel revealed hypercholesterolemia with elevated serum plant sterol concentrations, suggesting the diagnosis of sitosterolemia. Cardiac catheterization demonstrated left anterior descending artery and left circumflex artery stenosis, which required bypass of the left anterior descending artery and stenting of the left circumflex artery. Aggressive lipid control was recommended and he was treated medically with a beta-blocker, low-dose angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, aspirin, statin, and clopidogrel.",

Morphology, thickness, stability and loading of the polypyrrole (PPY) film were significantly affected by the structure and morphology of the sub-layer of carbon nanomaterials. Electrochemical oxidation of atorvastatin (ATOR) was investigated. Under the optimized conditions, a significant increase in the peak current (compared to other modified electrodes and bare GCE) and a negative shift in the peak potential (compared to bare GCE) were observed on the surface of the CNTs/PPY modified electrode. The electrode was able to completely resolve the voltammetric response of ATOR from potentially interfering species, e.g. ascorbic acid (AA), uric acid (UA) and dopamine (DA) which are present in many biological systems. Two linear dynamic ranges of 0.005-0.1\u03bcM and 0.1-1\u03bcM with a detection limit of 1.5nM and a sensitivity of 267.68 (\u00b11.26) \u03bcA/\u03bcM were obtained for ATOR from linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) measurements.

The present study was therefore planned to clarify whether atorvastatin can prevent diabetes development in a rat model of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Eight week old male Wistar rats were randomized into three groups (n = 12 each group). Group A was given standard chow diet, while group B and group C were offered high sucrose diet. In addition to high sucrose diet, group C was given atorvastatin (20mg/kg/day) from beginning of study till 26th week. After 26 weeks, a low dose of streptozotocin (15 mg/kg, i.p.) was given to all 3 groups and further followed for 4 weeks. Oral glucose tolerance tests were done at week 4, 26 and week 30. Development of impaired glucose tolerance at week 26 (16.66% vs 100%, P = <0.001) and diabetes at week 30 (16.66% vs 81.81%, P = 0.002) was significantly lower in rats pretreated with atorvastatin along with high sucrose diet viz group C compared to group B rats who received high sucrose diet only respectively. Also, metabolic indices like body weight, hypertriglyceridemia, glucose area under the curve (Gl-AUC) were significantly lower in group C compared to group B (P = <0.05) while insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was also lower in group C (P = 0.05).

    "95": "Statins are lipid-lowering drugs used widely to prevent and treat cardiovascular and coronary heart diseases. These drugs are among the most commonly prescribed medicines intended for long-term use. In general, statins are well tolerated. However, muscular adverse effects appear to be the most common obstacle that limits their use, resulting in poor patient compliance or even drug discontinuation. In addition, rare but potentially fatal cases of rhabdomyolysis have been reported with the use of these drugs, especially in the presence of certain risk factors. Previous reports have investigated statin-induced myotoxicity in vivo and in vitro using a number of cell lines, muscle tissues, and laboratory animals, in addition to randomized clinical trials, observational studies, and case reports. None of them have compared directly results from laboratory investigations with clinical observations of statin-related muscular adverse effects. To the best of our knowledge this is the first review article that combines laboratory investigation with clinical aspects of statin-induced myotoxicity. By reviewing published literature of in vivo, in vitro, and clinically relevant studies of statin myotoxicity, we aim to translate this important drug-related problem to establish a clear picture of proposed mechanisms that explain the risk factors and describe the diagnostic approaches currently used for evaluating the degree of muscle damage induced by these agents. This review provides baseline novel translational insight that can be used to enhance the safety profile, to minimize the chance of progression of these adverse effects to more severe and potentially fatal rhabdomyolysis, and to improve the overall patient compliance and adherence to long-term statin therapy.",

Although potent statins and maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy (LLT) have greatly reduced the risk of premature coronary heart disease (CHD) and death, all patients with HoFH and many with severe HeFH remain far from treatment goals and are thus at risk of cardiovascular disease. LDL apheresis is the treatment of choice for these patients but remains underutilized. No formal studies or epidemiologic data have estimated the prevalence of HoFH. An HeFH prevalence of 1:500 and a simplified Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium model was used to determine the probability of finding HoFH as 1:1 million in the general population. A\u00a0US population of approximately 314.8 million was used to determine the number of cases of HoFH and HeFH. The following key parameters were used to estimate the prevalence of severe HeFH: baseline pretreatment LDL-C level and distribution of patients with FH, posttreatment LDL-C level and distribution after maximally tolerated LLT, and baseline percentage of patients with HeFH who have CHD. We assumed an HeFH prevalence of 1:500 and used statistics for a Gaussian distribution after the posttreatment means and standard deviations of LDL-C levels in patients with HeFH receiving maximally tolerated LLT, as has been documented by data from clinical trials and cross-sectional studies. These estimates do not include the statin-intolerant population. The objective of this analysis was to determine the prevalence of the US population with severe HeFH with or without CHD who still will be eligible for LDL apheresis despite maximally tolerated LLT. We estimated that there are 315 US patients with HoFH and 650,000 with HeFH. The estimated prevalence of the severe HeFH population eligible for apheresis is approximately 1:20,000 (range, 1:11,700-1:62,500).

Bilayer tablets composed of sustained-release layer (10% w/w of xanthan gum and guar gum) and fast-release layer [1 : 3 (drug/cyclodextrin)] showed the desired release profile. The atorvastatin contained in the fast-release layer showed an initial fast-release of more than 60% of its drug content within 2 h, followed by sustained release of the atenolol for a period of 12 h. The pharmacokinetic study illustrated that the fast absorption and increased oral bioavailability of atorvastatin as well as therapeutic concentration of atenolol in blood were made available through adoption of formulation strategy of bilayer tablets.

The dissolution, contact angle and water absorption rate of these solid dispersions were measured to elucidate the relationship between wettability and dissolution. An abrupt increase of dissolution was observed when PVP amount exceeded a critical value. Contact angle was decreased with increasing of PVP amount. And the dissolution efficiency of the solid dispersion was increased with the decreasing of the contact angle, which was divided by a critical angle of 40.8\u00b0 into two linear parts. The result was validated in the dissolution of SDS incorporated solid dispersions. Contact angle correlated well with water absorption rate. A critical water absorption rate, with value of 0.535 \u03bcL/min, was also observed for the transition of dissolution efficiency. In conclusion, both contact angle and water absorption rate are good indicators for dissolution transition of solid dispersion, which show great potential in formula screening of solid dispersion.",

In the case of some transporters, it is advisable to evaluate an NCE with more than one test system and/or more than one probe substrate in order to convince oneself (and regulatory authorities) that a clinical drug interaction study is not warranted. Finally, each test system has its own unique set of advantages and disadvantages. One has to really appreciate the nuances of the available tools (test systems, probe substrates, etc.) to select the best tools for the job and design the optimal in vitro experiment. In this chapter, several examples are used to illustrate the successful interpretation of in vitro data for both efflux and uptake transporters. Some data presented in this chapter is unpublished at the time of compilation of this book. It has been incorporated in this chapter to provide a sense of complexities in transporter kinetics to the reader.",

Loss of V2R function prevents plasma membrane expression of the AQP2 water channel in the kidney collecting duct cells and impairs the kidney concentration ability. In an attempt to develop strategies to bypass V2R signaling in X-NDI, we evaluated the effects of secretin and fluvastatin, either alone or in combination, on kidney function in a mouse model of X-NDI. The secretin receptor was found to be functionally expressed in the kidney collecting duct cells. Based on this, X-NDI mice were infused with secretin for 14 days but urinary parameters were not altered by the infusion. Interestingly, secretin significantly increased AQP2 levels in the collecting duct but the protein primarily accumulated in the cytosol. Since we previously reported that fluvastatin treatment increased AQP2 plasma membrane expression in wild-type mice, secretin-infused X-NDI mice received a single injection of fluvastatin. Interestingly, urine production by X-NDI mice treated with secretin plus fluvastatin was reduced by nearly 90% and the urine osmolality was doubled. Immunostaining showed that secretin increased intracellular stores of AQP2 and the addition of fluvastatin promoted AQP2 trafficking to the plasma membrane. Taken together, these findings open new perspectives for the pharmacological treatment of X-NDI.",

To this end NAFLD fibrosis score and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were assessed in 570 White individuals with ultrasonography-diagnosed NAFLD. As compared with subjects at low probability of liver fibrosis, individuals at high and intermediate probability showed an unfavorable cardio-metabolic risk profile having significantly higher values of waist circumference, insulin resistance, high sensitivity C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, uric acid and lower insulin-like growth factor-1 levels.

The implementation region included prescriptions from the province of Groningen where the educational intervention was implemented and where the health insurer is most active. The control region comprised all other provinces covered by the database. We modelled the effect of the intervention using a state-space approach. Significant differences in prescribing and cost patterns between regions were observed for statins and PPIs.

Lovastatin decreased, whereas Cho increased, the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) respectively by decreasing or increasing the expression of p47-phox and gp91-phox (NOX2). Reducing intracellular ROS with either a mimetic superoxide dismutase (TEMPOL) or an NADPH oxidase inhibitor (apocynin) inhibited cell proliferation, particularly in Cho-treated cells. The effects of TEMPOL or apocynin were mimicked by inhibition of TRPC6 with SKF-96365. Lovastatin decreased TRPC6 expression and activity via a Cho-dependent mechanism, whereas Cho increased TRPC6 expression and activity via an ROS-dependent mechanism. Consistent with the fact that TRPC6 is a Ca(2+)-permeable channel, lovastatin decreased, but Cho increased, intracellular Ca(2+) also via ROS.

As of today, the accumulated epidemiological evidence does not support the hypothesis that statin use affects the risk of developing breast cancer when taken at low doses for managing hypercholesterolemia. However, current evidence cannot exclude an increased risk of breast cancer with statin use in subsets of individuals, for example, the elderly. On the other hand, some studies show that statins might be useful to prevent recurrence and improve survival in patients already suffering from certain breast cancer types. They could also be combined with certain anticancer drugs and potentiate their effects, ameliorate their side effects or prevent the development of resistance. Further research is warranted to clarify these issues.", 
    "219": "The long half-life of atorvastatin and fenofibrate makes them suitable for alternate day therapy. Hence, we aimed to study the efficacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness of alternate day therapy with atorvastatin and fenofibrate combination in mixed dyslipidemia.", 
    "220": "Eligible patients with mixed dyslipidemia were randomly allotted into 2 equal parallel groups-alternate day therapy group (group 1) and daily therapy group (group 2). Patients in groups 1 and 2 received fixed dose combination of atorvastatin 10 mg and fenofibrate 160 mg on alternate days and daily, respectively, for 12 weeks. Mean percentage change from baseline in triglycerides (TGLs), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C), HDL-C, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), and TC-HDL ratio, incidence of adverse effects, and cost-effectiveness were compared in both the groups.", 
    "221": "Among 110 patients randomized, 99 completed the study till 12 weeks treatment duration. The TGLs, non-HDL-C, TC, and LDL-C decreased by 56.4%, 49.7%, 36.5%, and 39.2%, respectively, in alternate day therapy group and by 57.5%, 51.2%, 37.5%, and 39.4%, respectively, in daily therapy group. The HDL-C levels increased by 20.1% in alternate day therapy group compared to 21.8% in daily therapy group. No statistically significant difference was seen between both the groups in mean percentage change in lipid parameters from baseline to end of 12 weeks. Incidence of adverse events was reasonably less in alternate day therapy group.", 
    "222": "Alternate day therapy with atorvastatin-fenofibrate combination is an effective and safe alternative to daily therapy in mixed dyslipidemia. Apart from significant cost savings, reasonable reduction in the incidence of adverse events is seen with alternate day regimen. However, larger studies are needed to more reliably confirm our interesting but preliminary results.", 
    "223": "The liver plays a central role in metabolism and mediating insulin action. To dissect the effects of insulin on the liver in vivo, we have studied liver insulin receptor knockout (LIRKO) mice. Because LIRKO livers lack insulin receptors, they are unable to respond to insulin. Surprisingly, the most profound derangement observed in LIRKO livers by microarray analysis is a suppression of the cholesterologenic genes. Sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-2 promotes cholesterologenic gene transcription, and is inhibited by intracellular cholesterol. LIRKO livers show a slight increase in hepatic cholesterol, a 40% decrease in Srebp-2, and a 50-90% decrease in the cholesterologenic genes at the mRNA and protein levels. In control mice, SREBP-2 and cholesterologenic gene expression are suppressed by fasting and restored by refeeding; in LIRKO mice, this response is abolished. Similarly, the ability of statins to induce Srebp-2 and the cholesterologenic genes is lost in LIRKO livers. In contrast, ezetimibe treatment robustly induces Srepb-2 and its targets in LIRKO livers, raising the possibility that insulin may regulate SREBP-2 indirectly, by altering the accumulation or distribution of cholesterol within the hepatocyte. Taken together, these data indicate that cholesterol synthesis is a key target of insulin action in the liver.", 
    "224": "Cheyne-Stokes respiration and cardiac arrhythmias are associated with increased morbidity and mortality in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). Enhanced carotid body chemoreflex (CBC) sensitivity is associated with these abnormalities in CHF. Reduced carotid body (CB) nitric oxide and nitric oxide synthase (NOS) levels play an important role in the enhanced CBC. In other disease models, Simvastatin (statin) treatment increases endothelial NOS, in part, by increasing Kr\u00fcppel-like Factor 2 expression. We hypothesized that statin treatment would ameliorate enhanced CBC sensitivity as well as increased respiratory variability, apnea/hypopnea index, and arrhythmia index, in a rodent model of CHF. Resting breathing pattern, cardiac rhythm, and the ventilatory and CB chemoreceptor afferent responses to hypoxia were assessed in rats with CHF induced by coronary ligation. CHF was associated with enhanced ventilatory and CB afferent responses to hypoxia as well as increased respiratory variability, apnea/hypopnea index, and arrhythmia index. Statin treatment prevented the increases in CBC sensitivity and the concomitant increases in respiratory variability, apnea/hypopnea index, and arrhythmia index. Kr\u00fcppel-like Factor 2 and endothelial NOS protein were decreased in the CB and nucleus tractus solitarii of CHF animals, and statin treatment increased the expression of these proteins. Our findings demonstrate that the increased CBC sensitivity, respiratory instability, and cardiac arrhythmias observed in CHF are ameliorated by statin treatment and suggest that statins may be an effective treatment for Cheyne-Stokes respiration and arrhythmias in patient populations with high chemoreflex sensitivity.", 
    "225": "Inhibitors of the mevalonate pathway, including the highly prescribed statins, reduce the production of cholesterol and isoprenoids such as geranylgeranyl pyrophosphates. The Rho family of small guanine triphosphatases (GTPases) requires isoprenylation, specifically geranylgeranylation, for activation. Because Rho GTPases are primary regulators of actin filament rearrangements required for process extension, neurite arborization, and synaptic plasticity, statins may affect cognition or recovery from nervous system injury. Here, we assessed how manipulating geranylgeranylation affects neurite initiation, elongation, and branching in neuroblastoma growth cones. Treatment with the statin, lovastatin (20 \u03bcM), decreased measures of neurite initiation by 17.0 to 19.0 % when a source of cholesterol was present and increased neurite branching by 4.03- to 9.54-fold (regardless of exogenous cholesterol). Neurite elongation was increased by treatment with lovastatin only in cholesterol-free culture conditions. Treatment with lovastatin decreased growth cone actin filament content by up to 24.3 %. In all cases, co-treatment with the prenylation precursor, geranylgeraniol (10 \u03bcM), reversed the effect of lovastatin. In a prior work, statin effects on outgrowth were linked to modulating the actin depolymerizing factor, cofilin. In our assays, treatment with lovastatin or geranylgeraniol decreased cofilin phosphorylation in whole cell lysates. However, lovastatin increased cofilin phosphorylation in cell bodies and decreased it in growth cones, indicating differential regulation in specific cell regions. Together, we interpret these data to suggest that protein geranylgeranylation likely regulates growth cone actin filament content and subsequent neurite outgrowth through mechanisms that also affect actin nucleation and polymerization.",

    "235": "Large-scale randomized clinical trials have established the efficacy of cholesterol-lowering, blood pressure-lowering, and anti-platelet therapy to prevent cardiovascular diseases. A challenge for clinicians is to apply group-level evidence from these trials to individual patients. Trials typically report a single treatment effect estimate which is the average effect of all participants, comprising patients who respond poorly, intermediately, and well. Clinicians would preferably make patient-tailored treatment decisions. Therefore, one would require an estimate of an individual patient's response to therapy. Although not yet widely recognized, trials contain this type of information. In this paper, we show how available information from landmark trials can be translated to an individual 'treatment score' through the use of multivariable therapeutic prediction models. These models provide an individual estimate of the absolute risk reduction in cardiovascular events given the specific combination of multiple clinical characteristics of a patient under care. Based on this individualized treatment estimate and metrics such as the individual number-needed-to-treat, clinicians together with their patients can decide whether drug treatment or what treatment intensity is worthwhile. Selective treatment of those who can anticipate the greatest benefit and the least harm on an individualized basis could reduce the number of unnecessary treatments and healthcare costs beyond that currently achievable by subgroup analyses based on single patient characteristics."
