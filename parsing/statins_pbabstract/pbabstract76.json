Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing preprocedural statin administration before coronary catheterization with standard strategies were searched in MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect databases. The outcome of interest was the incidence of postprocedural CI-AKI. Prespecified subgroup analyses were performed according to baseline glomerular filtration rate (GFR), statin type, and N-acetylcysteine use. Eight RCTs were included for a total of 4,984 patients. The incidence of CI-AKI was 3.91% in the statin group (n\u00a0= 2,480) and 6.98% in the control group (n\u00a0= 2,504). In the pooled analysis using a random-effects model, patients receiving statins had 46% lower relative risk (RR) of CI-AKI compared with the control group (RR 0.54, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.38 to 0.78, p\u00a0= 0.001). A moderate degree of non-significant heterogeneity was present (I(2)\u00a0= 41.9%, chi-square\u00a0= 12.500, p\u00a0= 0.099, \u03c4\u00b2\u00a0= 0.100). In the subanalysis based on GFR, the pooled RR indicated a persistent benefit with statins in patients with GFR <60\u00a0ml/min (RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.45 to 1.00, p\u00a0= 0.050) and a highly significant benefit in patients with GFR \u226560\u00a0ml/min (RR 0.40, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.61, p <0.0001). Statin type and N-acetylcysteine or hydration did not significantly influence the results. In conclusion, preprocedural statin use leads to a significant reduction in the pooled RR of CI-AKI.",

Current evidence suggests that preoperative statin therapy, tight glycemic control or urine alkalinization with bicarbonate do not protect the kidneys from harm. The theoretical kidney protective effect of preoperative aspirin therapy or renal vasodilatation with atrial natriuretic peptide or fenoldopam is only supported by low-quality evidence that needs further evaluation.

Although statins have been considered to stabilize atherosclerotic plaque, this effect has not been well characterized in\u00a0vivo. We investigated the relation between potent statin therapy and plaque microstructures imaged by frequency-domain optical coherence tomography. Two hundred ninety nonculprit lipid plaques in 275 patients with stable coronary artery disease receiving atorvastatin or rosuvastatin were analyzed. Patients were stratified into no statin, low-, and high-dose statin groups. Plaques in the high-dose statin group demonstrated a smaller lipid arc (p\u00a0= 0.02) and a greater fibrous cap thickness (p\u00a0= 0.01). In patients receiving statin therapy, high-dose statin therapy was associated with a greater fibrous cap thickness in patients with smaller (148.2 \u00b1 30.5 vs 105.3 \u00b1 41.1 \u03bcm, p\u00a0= 0.004) but not larger lipid index (91.1 \u00b1 32.6 vs 78.1 \u00b1 43.3 \u03bcm, p\u00a0= 0.21). In conclusion, potent statin therapy is associated with less vulnerable plaque features on frequency-domain optical coherence tomography imaging. This finding varies according to the size of plaque lipid content, being less effective in lipid-loaded plaques.",

However, currently, there is still not enough evidence to advocate pharmacogenetic testing before initiating statin therapy. Patients with inflammatory states and HIV infection also have diminished LDL-C lowering as a response to statin treatment. Pseudo-resistance due to nonadherence or non-persistence in real-life circumstances is probably the main cause of insufficient LDL-C response to statin treatment.",

    "41": "In individuals with diabetes, a log linear relationship exists between cholesterol levels and cardiovascular disease. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and Statins, a cholesterol lowering drug, have a complex relationship. Statins are potent modulators of CYP3A4 2 enzyme and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) functions in a number of cholesterol-independent, cardio protective actions in T2D. The aim of this study was to evaluate the CYP3A4 2 and eNOS gene mutations in a large number of T2D patients undergoing statin treatments. Blood samples were collected from 386 subjects in which 196 diabetic patients with hyperlipidemia were undergoing statin treatment (108 females and 88 males). The 190 healthy non-diabetic volunteers formed the control group. We investigated single nucleotide polymorphisms in diabetic patients and controls, and found that the statin therapy was not found to be effective in lowering LDL-cholesterol levels. Statistical analysis showed that T2D patients had significantly higher values of not only glucose levels but also a very high value of Triglycerides and cholesterol at the time of presentation. Our results for CYP3A4 2 showed that the genotype TT (wild type) had lower LDL when compared to TC (heterozygous). Similarly, the genotype TC (heterozygous) had lower LDL when compared to CC (homozygous). A similar trend was observed in the GG (wild type) and GT (heterozygous) of eNOS. In conclusion, we have described for the first time a significant correlation of statin treatment and CYP3A4 2 and eNOS gene polymorphisms in T2D, suggesting a new genetic susceptibility factor for insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia in T2D.", 
    "42": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have been shown to improve cardiovascular (CV) outcomes in the general population as well as in patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD). Statins' beneficial effects have been attributed to both cholesterol-lowering and cholesterol-independent \"pleiotropic\" properties. By their pleiotropic effects statins have been shown to reduce inflammation, alleviate oxidative stress, modify the immunologic responses, improve endothelial function and suppress platelet aggregation. Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) exhibit an enormous increase in CVD rates even from early CKD stages. As considerable differences exist in dyslipidemia characteristics and the pathogenesis of CVD in CKD, statins' CV benefits in CKD patients (including those with a kidney graft) should not be considered unequivocal. Indeed, accumulating clinical evidence suggests that statins exert diverse effects on dialysis and non-dialysis CKD patients. Therefore, it seems that statins improve CV outcomes in non-dialysis patients whereas exert little (if any) benefit in the dialysis population. It has also been proposed that dyslipidemia might play a causative role or even accelerate renal injury. Moreover, ample experimental evidence suggests that statins ameliorate renal damage. However, a high quality randomized controlled trial (RCT) and metaanalyses do not support a beneficial role of statins in renal outcomes in terms of proteinuria reduction or retardation of glomerular filtration rate (GFR) decline.", 
    "43": "We have previously described the use of a double coated agarose-agarose porcine islet macrobead for the treatment of type I diabetes mellitus. In the current study, the long-term viral safety of macrobead implantation into pancreatectomized diabetic dogs treated with pravastatin (n = 3) was assessed while 2 dogs served as nonimplanted controls. A more gradual return to preimplant insulin requirements occurred after a 2nd implant procedure (days 148, 189, and >652) when compared to a first macrobead implantation (days 9, 21, and 21) in all macrobead implanted animals. In all three implanted dogs, porcine C-peptide was detected in the blood for at least 10 days following the first implant and for at least 26 days following the second implant. C-peptide was also present in the peritoneal fluid of all three implanted dogs at 6 months after 2nd implant and in 2 of 3 dogs at necropsy. Prescreening results of islet macrobeads and culture media prior to transplantation were negative for 13 viruses. No evidence of PERV or other viral transmission was found throughout the study. This study demonstrates that the long-term (2.4 years) implantation of agarose-agarose encapsulated porcine islets is a safe procedure in a large animal model of type I diabetes mellitus.",

MIN6 cells were, respectively, treated with 0\u2009 \u03bc M, 2\u2009 \u03bc M, 5\u2009 \u03bc M, and 10\u2009 \u03bc M simvastatin for 48\u2009h. Radio immunoassay was performed to measure the effect of simvastatin on insulin secretion in MIN6 cells. Luciferase method was used to examine the content of ATP in MIN6 cells. Real-time PCR and western blotting were performed to measure the mRNA and protein levels of inward rectifier potassium channel 6.2 (Kir6.2), voltage-dependent calcium channel 1.2 (Cav1.2), and glucose transporter-2 (GLUT2), respectively. ATP-sensitive potassium current and L-type calcium current were recorded by whole-cell patch-clamp technique. The results showed that high concentrations of simvastatin (5\u2009 \u03bc M and 10\u2009 \u03bc M) significantly reduced the synthesis and secretion of insulin compared to control groups in MIN6 cells (P < 0.05). ATP content in simvastatin-treated cells was lower than in control cells (P < 0.05). Compared with control group, the mRNA and protein expression of Kir6.2 increased with treatment of simvastatin (P < 0.05), and mRNA and protein expression of Cav1.2 and GLUT2 decreased in response to simvastatin (P < 0.05). Moreover, simvastatin increased the ATP-sensitive potassium current and reduced the L-type calcium current. These results suggest that simvastatin inhibits the synthesis and secretion of insulin through a reduction in saccharometabolism in MIN6 cells.", 
    "45": "The objective of this investigation was to improve the solubility of the poorly water soluble drug atorvastatin (ATR), using solid dispersion (SD) techniques, with Neem Gum (NG) as a hydrophilic carrier. The effects of the polymer concentration and method of preparation on the solubility and dissolution rate were studied. The results showed that the solubility of ATR increases with increasing NG concentration. However, dissolution rate of ATR from its SD was dependent on the method used to prepare SD. An in vitro drug release study revealed that the solvent evaporation technique is a more convenient and effective method of preparing SD than kneading method. The SD was characterized using DSC, SEM, and XRD study. An in vivo study was performed in which the 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibition activity was measured. A significant reduction in HMG CoA reductase activity was observed with SD of ATR compared with the plain drug. An ex vivo absorption study was carried out using modified apparatus developed in our laboratory. The in vitro drug release and in vivo and ex vivo studies clearly demonstrated the potential of hydrophilic NG in enhancing the solubility, dissolution rate, and bioavailability of ATR.",

    "48": "Therapy with statins reduced total and LDL cholesterol levels as expected. CX3CL1 levels were significantly reduced from no statin control levels (89.9\u2009\u00b1\u200918.5\u00a0pg/mL) after treatment with atorvastatin (60.0\u2009\u00b1\u20097.8\u00a0pg/mL), pravastatin (54.2\u2009\u00b1\u20097.0\u00a0pg/mL) and rosuvastatin (65.6\u2009\u00b1\u20097.3\u00a0pg/mL) (\u03c7 (2)(2)\u2009=\u200917.4, p\u2009\u2264\u20090.001). Cholesterol is not a known regulator of CX3CL1. We found GM-CSF (r(2)\u2009=\u20090.524; p\u2009<\u20090.005) and VEGF-A (r(2)\u2009=\u20090.4; p\u2009<\u20090.005) levels were highly and positively correlated with CX3CL1. Total (r(2)\u2009=\u20090.086) and LDL cholesterol (r(2)\u2009=\u20090.059) levels weakly correlated with CX3CL1 levels. Finally, we tested whether LDL cholesterol could induce CX3CL1, GM-CSF, and VEGF-A in human endothelial cells, versus TNF\u03b1. LDL cholesterol alone resulted in small, non-significant increases in CX3CL1 and GM-CSF, while TNF\u03b1 resulted in\u2009>\u200910-fold induction.", 
    "49": "Our findings suggest that while statins suppress CX3CL1 levels, inflammatory cytokines may be the major regulator of CX3CL1 levels rather than cholesterol itself. Additional studies in a larger patient population are needed to confirm these findings, determine if CX3CL1 levels reflect inflammation levels, and potentially add to standard risk factors in prediction of atherosclerotic disease events.", 
    "50": "Palliative care is increasingly seen as a standard component of high-quality comprehensive cancer care. However, several challenges remain to its widespread integration into clinical oncology practice, including workforce problems, reimbursement concerns, and a fledgling evidence base. This article discusses issues surrounding evidence base development in palliative cancer care, using the example of a recently published randomized controlled trial of oxygen versus room air. The Oxygen Trial randomized patients with refractory dyspnea and adequate Pao2 to oxygen or room air, administered via nasal cannula. Both groups experienced improvements in self-rated dyspnea scores, but no statistical differences were seen between intervention arms. These results suggest that supplementary oxygen is often unnecessary in the palliative setting, and that room air is similarly efficacious. This example highlights the importance and need for ongoing development of the evidence base in palliative medicine. The Palliative Care Research Cooperative (PCRC) is a novel National Institute of Nursing Research-funded research infrastructure that seeks to expand the palliative care evidence base. Its first multisite trial was recently completed, assessing the pragmatic question of whether statin medications can be safely discontinued in end-of-life settings. The PCRC will be a vehicle through which a high-quality evidence base will continue to expand and develop. Such ongoing research efforts are needed to inform and improve palliative care practice.", 
    "51": "New therapies are urgently needed for hematologic malignancies, especially in patients with relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and multiple myeloma. We and others have previously shown that FDA-approved statins, which are used to control hypercholesterolemia and target the mevalonate pathway (MVA), can trigger tumor-selective apoptosis. Our goal was to identify other FDA-approved drugs that synergize with statins to further enhance the anticancer activity of statins in vivo. Using a screen composed of other FDA approved drugs, we identified dipyridamole, used for the prevention of cerebral ischemia, as a potentiator of statin anticancer activity. The statin-dipyridamole combination was synergistic and induced apoptosis in multiple myeloma and AML cell lines and primary patient samples, whereas normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells were not affected. This novel combination also decreased tumor growth in vivo. Statins block HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), the rate-limiting enzyme of the MVA pathway. Dipyridamole blunted the feedback response, which upregulates HMGCR and HMG-CoA synthase 1 (HMGCS1) following statin treatment. We further show that dipyridamole inhibited the cleavage of the transcription factor required for this feedback regulation, sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 2 (SREBF2, SREBP2). Simultaneously targeting the MVA pathway and its restorative feedback loop is preclinically effective against hematologic malignancies. This work provides strong evidence for the immediate evaluation of this novel combination of FDA-approved drugs in clinical trials.", 
    "52": "Nonrandomized studies suggested lower mortality rates with statin pretreatment in patients with acute ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). However, clinical data are still inconclusive and the mechanisms of these presumed beneficial effects require further exploration. Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging offers the possibility of studying a variety of markers of myocardial damage and reperfusion injury after myocardial infarction. The aim of this study was to assess a possible link of statin pretreatment with myocardial damage in acute STEMI. The multicenter Abciximab i.v. versus i.c. in ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction CMR substudy enrolled 795 consecutive patients with acute STEMI who underwent primary angioplasty within 12\u00a0hours of symptom onset. CMR studies assessing left ventricular ejection fraction, infarct size, microvascular obstruction, area at risk, and myocardial salvage index were performed in a median of 3\u00a0days after the clinical event. We performed a retrospective analysis to evaluate the impact of statin pretreatment on myocardial damage. Information on statin pretreatment was available in 791 of 795 patients (99%). Of these, 122 (15%) had long-term statin pretreatment. CMR results showed no significant differences in the area at risk, left ventricular ejection fraction, infarct size, microvascular obstruction, and myocardial salvage index between patients with and without statin pretreatment. Furthermore, no differences in short- and long-term outcomes could be observed. In conclusion, in this CMR study, statin pretreatment in patients with STEMI was not associated with lesser myocardial damage.",

A random sample of 1,000,000 subjects covered by the National Health Insurance in 2005 was recruited. A total of 494,002 men and 502,948 women and without lung cancer were followed for the annual cumulative incidence of lung cancer in 2005, with calculation of the risk ratios between diabetic and non-diabetic subjects. Logistic regression estimated the adjusted odds ratios for risk factors.",

Such an association was not related to a higher detection with chest X-ray examination. Insulin use and medications including oral anti-diabetic drugs, statin, fibrate, and anti-hypertensive agents were not significantly associated with lung cancer.

    "65": "Statins are known as agents promoting a biphasic dose-dependent effect on angiogenesis under experimental conditions. Dysregulation of angiogenesis plays an important role in the development of atherosclerosis and it may be affected by metabolic factors. The aim of this research was to explain how low doses of statins modify serum concentrations of pro-angiogenic factors MCP-1 and angiogenin in type 2 diabetic patients. Measurements of metabolic control parameters were performed in 30 patients with type 2 diabetes treated with low doses of statin, and in 34 statin-free patients with type 2 diabetes. The serum levels of MCP-1 and VCAM-1 in statin-treated patients were lower than those of the statin-free group. ANCOVA results revealed that these effects were dependent only on the use of statins. In type 2 diabetic subjects, overall positive correlation was found between total cholesterol or LDL serum concentration and MCP-1 serum level. The angiogenin concentration in the serum did not show differences and was comparable in both groups. The angiogenin serum level correlated negatively with HDL, LDL and with HbA1c. Multivariate regression analysis indicated that angiogenin serum levels in type 2 diabetic patients were determined mainly by HbA1c, HDL-cholesterol and diabetes duration. It has been shown that statins used in low doses in type 2 diabetic subjects decrease MCP-1 and VCAM-1serum levels, most likely due to the statins-related effect on the lipid profile, while angiogenin serum levels in this group are determined rather by the current metabolic control.",

Statins were ultrasonically extracted with 50% (v/v) methanol. Clean-up was performed using an Oasis MAX mini-cartridge column with methanol and methanol containing 0.2% (v/v) phosphoric acid as an eluting solvent. UPLC separation was performed on an ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 column (2.1 mm i.d. \u00d7 150 mm, 1.7 \u03bcm) with 0.2% (v/v) phosphoric acid aqueous solution-acetonitrile gradient. The method was validated for dietary supplements spiked with the 12 statins at the quantitation limits and 10 times the quantitation limits, and the recoveries of statins were between 89.2% and 100.9%. Relative standard deviation values of repeatability and intermediate precision were not more than 7%. The analytical method was applied to 24 commercial dietary supplements. LO and LOA were found at maximum concentrations of 4.85 mg/packet and 1.28 mg/capsule, respectively. Other statins were not detected. When a dietary supplement was consumed according to the directions on the package, the daily intake of LO was 6.74 mg. This could be dangerous to consumers because it exceeds one half of the lowest recommended daily dose of LO (10 mg).", 
    "67": "Simvastatin (SV) leads to reduction of ventricular rhythm during atrial fibrillation on rabbit atrioventricular (AV) nodes. The aim of our study was (i) to determine the frequency-dependent effects of SV in a functional model, and (ii) to assess the effects of SV to suppress experimental AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT). Selective stimulation protocols were used with two different pacing protocols, His to atrial, and atrial to atrial (AA). An experimental AVNRT model with various cycle lengths was created in three groups of perfused rabbit AV nodal preparations (n\u00a0=\u00a024) including: SV 3\u00a0\u03bcm, SV 7\u00a0\u03bcm, and verapamil 0.1\u00a0\u03bcm. SV increased nodal conduction time and refractoriness by AA pacing. Different simulated models of slow/fast and fast/slow reentry were induced. SV caused inhibitory effects on the slow anterograde conduction (origin of refractoriness) more than on the fast anterograde conduction time, leading to an increase of tachycardia cycle length, tachycardia wavelength and termination of slow/fast reentrant tachyarrhythmia. Verapamil significantly suppressed the basic and frequency-dependent intrinsic nodal properties. In addition, SV decreased the incidence of gap and echo beats. The present study showed that SV in a concentration and rate-dependent manner increased the AV effective refractory period and reentrant tachycardia wavelength that lead to slowing or termination of experimental fast AVNRT. The direction-dependent inhibitory effect of SV on the anterograde and retrograde dual pathways explains its specific antireentrant actions.",

    "69": "Immunohistochemical analysis of samples with atherosclerosis of various stages showed increased CCL19, CCL21, and CCR7 expression in atherosclerotic coronary plaques compared with nonatherosclerotic controls. Expression levels increased in positive correlation with coronary lesion stage. Cell adhesion assays confirmed that CCL19 promoted monocyte adhesion, which was induced by CCR7, to human umbilical vein endothelial cells, an effect partially antagonized by atorvastatin. After the human umbilical vein endothelial cells were treated with CCR7-neutralizing antibody, both CCL19- and CCL21-induced monocyte to human umbilical vein endothelial cell migration and CCL19-induced monocyte to human umbilical vein endothelial cell adhesion were abolished. The associations between genetic variants of CCL19, CCL21, CCR7, and coronary artery disease in a Chinese Han population were determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The following single nucleotide polymorphisms were associated with coronary artery disease: CCL19 rs2227302, CCL21 rs2812377, and CCR7 rs588019. Individuals with the CCL19 rs2227302 T allele or CCL21 rs2812377 G allele had higher plasma CCL19 levels than those with C/C genotype and higher CCL21 levels than those with T/T genotype in both case and control subjects.",

    "71": "Organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATP) 1B1 and OATP1B3 are drug transporters mediating the active hepatic uptake of their substrates. Because they exhibit overlapping substrate specificities, the contribution of each isoform to the net hepatic uptake needs to be considered when predicting drug-drug interactions. The relative contribution of OATP1B1- and OATP1B3-mediated uptake of statins into hepatocytes was estimated based on either relative transporter protein expression data or relative activity data. Therefore, kinetics of eight statins and OATP1B1- and OATP1B3-specific reference substrates was determined in OATP1B1- and OATP1B3-expressing human embryonic kidney 293 cells and in human cryopreserved hepatocytes. Absolute OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 protein abundance was determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in all expression systems. Transporter activity data generated in recombinant cell lines were extrapolated to hepatocyte values using relative transporter expression factors (REF) or relative activity factors (RAF). Our results showed a pronounced OATP1B1 and comparatively low OATP1B3 protein expression in the investigated hepatocyte lot. Based on REF scaling, we demonstrated that the active hepatic uptake clearances of reference substrates, atorvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin were well predicted within twofold error, demonstrating that OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 were major contributors. For other statins, the net hepatic uptake clearance was underpredicted, suggesting the involvement of other hepatic uptake transporters. Summarized, we showed that REF- and RAF-based predictions were highly similar, indicating a direct transporter expression-activity relationship. Moreover, we demonstrated that the REF-scaling method provided a powerful tool to quantitatively assess the transporter-specific contributions to the net uptake clearance of statins in hepatocytes.",

Diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal injections of 60\u2009mg/kg streptozotocin, and 10\u2009mg/kg/day of oral atorvastatin was administered for 4\u2009weeks via orogastric tubes. The animals were euthanized, and blood samples were collected via cardiac puncture for biochemical analysis. Bilateral hysterectomy was performed for the histopathologic examination. Endometrial gland degeneration and stromal fibrosis scores concomitant with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) immunoexpressions were analyzed. The endometrial gland degeneration scores, stromal fibrosis scores and VEGF immunoexpression was significantly lower, and the EGFR immunoexpression was significantly higher in the atorvastatin-treated diabetic rats when compared to the non-treated diabetic group, suggesting that atorvastatin ameliorates the uterine microenvironment in diabetes mellitus.",

    "100": "Patients at increased cardiovascular risk commonly display high levels of plasma triglycerides (TGs), elevated LDL cholesterol, small dense LDL particles and low levels of HDL-cholesterol. Many remain at high risk even after successful statin therapy, presumably because TG levels remain high. Lipoprotein lipase (LPL) maintains TG homeostasis in blood by hydrolysis of TG-rich lipoproteins. Efficient clearance of TGs is accompanied by increased levels of HDL-cholesterol and decreased levels of small dense LDL. Given the central role of LPL in lipid metabolism we sought to find small molecules that could increase LPL activity and serve as starting points for drug development efforts against cardiovascular disease. Using a small molecule screening approach we have identified small molecules that can protect LPL from inactivation by the controller protein angiopoietin-like protein 4 during incubations in vitro. One of the selected compounds, 50F10, was directly shown to preserve the active homodimer structure of LPL, as demonstrated by heparin-Sepharose chromatography. On injection to hypertriglyceridemic apolipoprotein A-V deficient mice the compound ameliorated the postprandial response after an olive oil gavage. This is a potential lead compound for the development of drugs that could reduce the residual risk associated with elevated plasma TGs in dyslipidemia.",

Therefore, we sought to investigate whether chronic cholesterol depletion by lovastatin is feasible and, if so, suppresses the expression of GMUC5AC in NCI-H292 cells.

Thus, the aim of this study was to understand the antiatherosclerotic effects of \u03b23-AR. Thirty-six male homozygous apolipoprotein E-deficient mice and wild-type C57BL/6J mice were randomized into 6 treatment groups: wild-type, atherosclerotic model, atorvastatin, low-dose \u03b23-AR agonist, high-dose \u03b23-AR agonist, and \u03b23-AR antagonist groups. The serum lipids, aortic-free cholesterol (FC), and cholesteryl ester (CE) concentrations were measured at the end of the treatments. The mRNA expression levels of liver apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b1 (PPAR\u03b1), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) were detected by quantitative real-time PCR. Protein expression levels of apoA1, PPAR\u03b1, and PPAR\u03b3 in the liver were determined by western blot analysis. Treatment with \u03b23-AR significantly increased the plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apoA-I, whereas the levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased. The \u03b23-AR agonist treatment markedly decreased both the FC and the CE concentrations in the aorta compared with the atherosclerotic model mice. The \u03b23-AR agonist increased the mRNA and protein expression levels of apoA-I, PPAR\u03b1, and PPAR\u03b3 in the liver. This study demonstrates that long-term \u03b23-AR activation can regulate lipid metabolic disorders and reduces the aortic FC and the CE concentrations.

Application of this evidence reveals that many people (including younger ones) with high LDL-C levels can benefit more than people currently receiving statin treatment solely on the basis of their absolute CVD risk, whereas others at higher CVD risk, but with lower LDL-C, will derive little benefit. This does not seem to have been adequately considered in recent clinical guidelines.",

Importantly, use of ETC-1002 in statin-intolerant patients has shown statin-like lowering of LDL-C without the muscle pain and weakness responsible for discontinuation of statin use by many patients.

There were no differences between mortality of patients with STEMI and NSTEMI with respect of use of heparine, salicylate, nitrate, beta-blocker, ACE inhibitor, statin and trimetazidine. While examining the effect of clopidogrel, we observed a significantly lower mortality rate in patients with NSTEMI compared to the STEMI group (p = 0.005).

In this study, we investigated the outcomes of mevalonate inhibition in immature and mature mouse cerebellar Purkinje cells in culture. Specifically, we found that the inhibition of the mevalonate pathway by mevastatin resulted in cell death, and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP) supplementation significantly enhanced neuronal survival. The surviving immature Purkinje cells, however, exhibited dendritic developmental deficits. The morphology of mature cells was not affected. The inhibition of squalene synthase by zaragozic acid caused impaired dendritic development, similar to that seen in the GGPP-rescued Purkinje cells. Our results indicate GGPP is required for cell survival and squalene synthase for the cell development of Purkinje cells. Abnormalities in Purkinje cells are linked to motor-behavioral learning disorders such as cerebellar ataxia. Thus, serious caution should be taken when using drugs that inhibit geranylgeranylation or the squalene-cholesterol branch of the pathway in the developing stage.", 
    "152": "Statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, are important for preventing adverse cardiovascular events not only in patients with a high risk of vascular disease but also in those with a low risk, by reducing the levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Statin is associated with deteriorating glucose homeostasis and an increased risk of diabetes mellitus. Moreover, these off-target effects are dose-dependent; it has also been suggested that renal insult can be caused dose-dependently by statin treatment, in contrast to previous studies showing a renoprotective effect. The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines recommend the use of high-intensity statin therapy, and extend its use to more people at risk of vascular diseases. However, a European committee has expressed concerns about the potential side effects of using statins in a large fraction of the population for extended periods. This is true of Asian people, for whom the disease burden from cardiovascular disorders is not as great as among Western ethnic groups. There are still many unanswered questions on how to balance the cardiovascular benefits with the potential renometabolic risks of statins. Therefore, genetic or pharmacogenetic approaches are needed to define who is more vulnerable to developing diabetes mellitus or acute kidney injury. In particular, more information is required regarding the metabolism of statins, and their off-target or unknown actions and overall impact. These different renometabolic effects of statins should help in formulating optimal therapeutic strategies for patients for reducing overall morbidity and mortality and not just those associated with cardiovascular diseases.", 
    "153": "A Mediterranean diet, with and without small daily amounts of red wine, and physical activity reduce the risk of cerebrovascular disease and improve cognition. An increase in cerebral blood flow may be the underlying mechanism. Under normal conditions, cerebral blood flow velocity changes in the internal carotid arteries and in large basal cerebral arteries correlate closely with cerebral blood flow changes, as the diameter of these vessels hardly changes and only the smaller vessels downstream change their diameter.", 
    "154": "A prospective randomized controlled trial was performed in 108 patients with carotid atherosclerosis (mean age 64 years, 67% men, 66% on statin therapy). Half of them were advised to follow a polyphenol-rich modified Mediterranean diet including 1-2 tomatoes, 3-5 walnuts and a bar of dark chocolate (25 g) a day and to perform moderate physical exercise for 30 min/day (lifestyle changes). Within these two groups, half of the patients were randomized either to avoid any alcohol or to drink 100 ml of red wine (women) or 200 ml of red wine (men) daily. Bilateral middle cerebral and internal carotid blood flow velocity (peak systolic, peak end-diastolic and mean) was measured at baseline and after 4 and 20 weeks using colour-coded duplex ultrasound. Insonation depth and insonation angle were used to identically place the sample volume during follow-up investigations. A general linear model with Tukey-Kramer adjustment for multiple comparisons was used to assess the primary end points. For the analysis we used the mean values of the right and left artery.",

    "156": "Advice on lifestyle changes, including a modified polyphenol-rich Mediterranean diet, a glass of red wine daily and physical exercise, did not affect middle cerebral and internal carotid blood flow velocity in our patient group with carotid atherosclerosis. An increase in cerebral blood flow is thus unlikely to be the cause of the reduced risk of cerebrovascular disease and improved cognitive functioning described in the literature. One possible explanation for the fact that blood flow velocity was not affected by red wine, diet and physical activity advice is that two thirds of our patients were already on statin therapy. Statins increase cerebral blood flow and vasomotor reactivity via nitric oxide.",

The study sample consisted of adult patients aged 18-64 years on an index date with continuous enrollment 12 months prior to and 12 months after the index date (the first fill date of a statin between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2010). Study subjects also needed to have a minimum of 2 ICD-9-CM diagnoses for hyperlipidemia or diabetes in the pre-index date period. Main data sources were medical and prescription (Rx) claims, as well as enrollment files provided by a health benefit program and a medical carrier of state government and public school employees in a midwestern state. Study subjects were stratified into 8 groups based on statin MPR level: less than \u200940%, 40%-59%, 60%-69%, 70%-79%, 80%-84%, 85%-89%, 90%-95%, and 96%-100%. Total medical and Rx costs, as well as all-cause hospital admission rates and ER visits in a year after the index date, were computed based on medical and Rx claims.

Mean total costs (medical\u2009+\u2009Rx) in a year after the index date were $6,064.36. There were significant variations in Rx costs and total health care costs as well as ER visits among the 8 patient groups stratified using the statin MPR level.

Based on a logistic regression model of hospital utilization for this study population, all the odds ratios of all-cause hospitalization among the groups with higher statin MPR were not statistically significant, suggesting that the likelihood of hospitalization for patients with higher statin MPR was not statistically lower than that of the reference group with statin MPR less than 40%. After controlling for all other covariates, another GLM model based on the Poisson distribution and log link function showed that ratios of ER visits among groups with statin MPR from 60%-69%, 80%-84%, 85%-89%, 90%-95%, and 96%-100% were smaller than 1 and statistically significant, suggesting the groups had fewer ER visits than the reference group with statin MPR less than \u200940%.

He re-presented 3\u2005years later with pelvic bone pain which had responded to a course of oral steroids started by the general practitioner, who was treating a presumed diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica. However, MRI of the pelvis showed bone marrow oedema and the diagnosis was changed to mastocytosis. He did not tolerate or respond to initial treatment.

    "181": "Endometriosis, defined as the presence of endometrial glands and/or stroma outside the uterine cavity, is an estrogen-dependent disease that affects about 10% of reproductive age women. Theories to explain the etiology of endometriosis abound. These include the alteration of epithelial cells on peritoneal surface, metaplasia of embryonic remnants of the mullerian ducts, immune system abnormalities, and the dissemination of endometrial cells through the circulation or lymphatic system, as well as retrograde menstruation, the hypothesis currently favored for the development of endometriosis. Angiogenesis, the development of new capillaries from pre-existing blood vessels, has been proposed as a key mechanism in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. Again from an etiological perspective, the formation of endometriotic implants requires ectopic fixation and proliferation of endometrial stroma and glands. The process of invasive insertion of endometriotic tissues involves the degradation of the extracellular matrix, and altered expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the eutopic and ectopic endometrium. Considering the antiproliferative, antiangiogenic, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory properties and matrix metalloproteinase activity inhibition of statins and the original studies addressing the possible mechanisms of action in endometriosis, the aim of this systematic review was to synthesize the research conducted to date in order to propose statins as possible and effective tools for controlling this disease.",

However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the anti-proliferative and anti-invasive properties of statins still remain elusive. In this study, we investigated the involvement of nitric oxide, iron homeostasis and antioxidant defence mechanisms in mediating the anti-proliferative and anti-invasive properties of hydrophobic statins in MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-453 and BT-549 metastatic triple negative breast cancer cells. Fluvastatin and simvastatin significantly increased cytotoxicity which was reversed with mevalonate. Interestingly, fluvastatin downregulated transferrin receptor (TfR1), with a concomitant depletion of intracellular iron levels in these cells. Statin-induced effects were mimicked by geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor (GGTI-298) but not farnesyl transferase inhibitor (FTI-277). Further, it was observed that TfR1 downregulation is mediated by increased nitric oxide levels via inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression. NOS inhibitors (asymmetric dimethylarginine and 1400W) counteracted and sepiapterin, a precursor of tetrahydrobiopterin, exacerbated statin-induced depletion of intracellular iron levels. Notably, fluvastatin increased manganese superoxide dismutase (by repressing the transcription factor DNA damage-binding protein 2), catalase and glutathione which, in turn, diminished H2 O2 levels. Fluvastatin-induced downregulation of TfR1, matrix metalloproteinase-2, -9 and inhibition of invasion were reversed in the presence of aminotriazole, a specific inhibitor of catalase. Finally, we conclude that fluvastatin, by altering iron homeostasis, nitric oxide generation and antioxidant defence mechanisms, induces triple negative breast cancer cell death.",

This therapy also reduced aortic endoplasmic reticulum stress induced by CKD. The short hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of CHOP and activating transcription factor-4 in vascular smooth muscle cells attenuated oxysterol-induced mineralization, osteogenic differentiation, and endoplasmic reticulum stress.

    "206": "PCSK9 inhibitors have demonstrated their good safety and tolerability in a large number of subjects with different clinical conditions, including statin-intolerance, enlarging their potential use in a broader range of patients. Further data on long-term mipomersen safety are required.", 
    "207": "Oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) has been strongly suggested as the key factor in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Mushrooms have been implicated in having preventive effects against chronic diseases due especially to their antioxidant properties. In this study, in vitro inhibitory effect of Hericium erinaceus on LDL oxidation and the activity of the cholesterol biosynthetic key enzyme, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG Co-A) reductase, was evaluated using five liquid-liquid solvent fractions consisting of methanol : dichloromethane (M : DCM), hexane (HEX), dichloromethane (DCM), ethyl acetate (EA), and aqueous residue (AQ). The hexane fraction showed the highest inhibition of oxidation of human LDL as reflected by the increased lag time (100 mins) for the formation of conjugated diene (CD) at 1 \u00b5g/mL and decreased production (68.28%, IC50 0.73 mg/mL) of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) at 1 mg/mL. It also mostly inhibited (59.91%) the activity of the HMG Co-A reductase at 10 mg/mL. The GC-MS profiling of the hexane fraction identified the presence of myconutrients: inter alia, ergosterol and linoleic acid. Thus, hexane fraction of Hericium erinaceus was found to be the most potent in vitro inhibitor of both LDL oxidation and HMG Co-A reductase activity having therapeutic potential for the prevention of oxidative stress-mediated vascular diseases.", 
    "208": "Easily detectable predictors of nonadherence to long-term drug treatment are lacking. We investigated the association between lifestyle factors and nonadherence to statin therapy among patients with and without cardiovascular comorbidities.", 
    "209": "We included 9285 participants from the Finnish Public Sector Study who began statin therapy after completing the survey. We linked their survey data with data in national health registers. We used prescription dispensing data to determine participants' nonadherence to statin therapy during the first year of treatment (defined as < 80% of days covered by filled prescriptions). We used logistic regression to estimate the association of several lifestyle factors with nonadherence, after adjusting for sex, age and year of statin initiation.", 
    "210": "Of the participants without cardiovascular comorbidities (n = 6458), 3171 (49.1%) were nonadherent with their statin therapy. Obesity (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.86, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.74-0.99), overweight (adjusted OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.79-0.98) and former smoking (adjusted OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.74-0.92) predicted a reduced risk of nonadherence in this group after adjustment for sex, age and year of statin initiation. Of the participants with cardiovascular comorbidities (n = 2827), 1155 (40.9%) were nonadherent. In this group, high alcohol consumption (adjusted OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.12-2.15), extreme drinking occasions (adjusted OR 1.48, 95% CI 1.11-1.97) and a cluster of 3-4 lifestyle risks (adjusted OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.15-2.27) predicted increased odds of nonadherence after adjustment for sex, age and year of statin initiation.", 
    "211": "People with cardiovascular comorbidities who had risky drinking behaviours or a cluster of lifestyle risks were at increased risk of nonadherence. Among individuals without cardiovascular comorbidities, information on lifestyle factors was unhelpful in identifying those at increased risk of nonadherence; that overweight, obesity and former smoking were predictors of better adherence in this group provides insight into mechanisms of adherence to preventive medication that deserve further study.", 
    "212": "For the primary prevention of cardiovascular (CV) disease, aspirin reduces the risk for major vascular events by approximately 15% to 20% with an absolute reduction of approximately 0.1%. Major bleeding occurs at an excess of approximately 2 cases per 1000 patient-years with aspirin therapy. For primary prevention, statin therapy has been shown to reduce the risk of CV events by approximately 30% to 40% with an absolute reduction of 1% to 2%. Rhabdomyolysis is rare, with an incidence of 3.4 cases per 100 000 patient-years. Compared with aspirin, statins have a more favorable risk-to-benefit profile for primary prevention.", 
    "213": "Statins are the most-effective therapy currently available for lowering the LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) level and preventing cardiovascular events. Additional therapies are necessary for patients who cannot reach the target LDL-C level when taking the maximum-tolerated dose of a statin. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is an enzyme with an important role in lipoprotein metabolism. Rare gain-of-function mutations in PCSK9 lead to a high LDL-C level and premature coronary heart disease, whereas loss-of-function variants lead to a low LDL-C level and a reduced incidence of coronary heart disease. Furthermore, the PCSK9 level is increased with statin therapy through negative feedback, which promotes LDL-receptor degradation and decreases the efficacy of LDL-C lowering with statins. PCSK9 inhibition is, therefore, a rational therapeutic target, and several approaches are being pursued. In phase I, II, and III trials, inhibition of PCSK9 with monoclonal antibodies has produced an additional 50-60% decrease in the LDL-C level when used in combination with statin therapy, compared with statin monotherapy. In short-term trials, PCSK9 inhibitors were well tolerated and had a low incidence of adverse effects. Ongoing phase III trials will provide information about the long-term safety of these drugs, and their efficacy in preventing cardiovascular events.",

    "215": "Retrospective cohort study using electronic health records and pharmacy claims data from Sutter Health's ambulatory-care medical network", 
    "216": "Managed-care beneficiaries, \u2265 18 years of age, who were switched from branded to generic statins between 1 January 2003 and 31 December 2012 MAIN MEASURES: Compliance was calculated as days of therapy dispensed divided by days from first to last generic prescription fill over 6 months, and was defined as a medication possession ratio \u2265 0.80. We used multivariable logistic regression to assess factors associated with compliance. Adjusted ORs and 95% CI were generated.", 
    "217": "We identified 5,156 patients who were switched from branded to generic statins; 73% of patients were compliant in the 6 months after switching. After statistical adjustment, higher compliance was associated with each 10-year increase in age (OR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.19; p\u2009<\u20090.001), receipt of a generic statin equivalent in potency to the prior branded statin (OR: 1.41; 95% CI: 1.16, 1.70; p\u2009<\u20090.001), and compliance with prior branded statin (OR: 4.68; 95% CI: 4.07, 5.39; p\u2009<\u20090.001). Lower compliance was seen among Hispanic patients compared to non-Hispanic white patients (OR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.52, 0.91; p\u2009=\u20090.009). Also, a switch to a higher potency generic statin, regardless of prior dose/potency, was negatively associated with compliance after switching (OR: 0.87; 95% CI: 0.80, 0.94; p\u2009=\u20090.001).", 
    "218": "The majority of patients switched from branded to generic agents were compliant with therapy in the first 6 months after switching. The potential for non-compliance to generic statin therapy, particularly among younger or Hispanic patients or when dose/potency changes are made, should be considered prior to switching. For these patients, counseling or close monitoring may be required to optimize generic interchange.", 
    "219": "A novel positron emission tomography (PET) tracer, [(11)C]-rosuvastatin (RSV), was developed to dynamically and noninvasively measure hepatobiliary transport and tissue distribution of [(11)C]-RSV in rats.", 
    "220": "Male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered either an Oatp inhibitor, rifampin (RIF, 40 mg/kg iv bolus plus 1.85 mg/min/kg iv infusion, n = 3), or the corresponding vehicle (saline, n = 3) for at least 90 min. Then, while these infusions were ongoing, the animals received [(11)C]-rosuvastatin (\u223c1 mCi/30 s, iv infusion). After [(11)C]-RSV administration, the lower abdominal region of the rats was imaged for 90 min. Time-activity curves for liver, intestine, and kidney were obtained and corrected for vascular content prior to noncompartmental and compartmental (five-compartment model) analysis.", 
    "221": "The majority of the [(11)C]-RSV dose was distributed into the liver. In the presence of RIF, the area under the [(11)C]-RSV radioactivity blood concentration-time profile (AUC0-90 min) was increased by \u223c3-fold. Relative to the control animals, RIF reduced the distribution of [(11)C]-RSV radioactivity into the liver and kidney (tissue AUC0-15 min/blood AUC0-15 min) by 54% and 73% respectively. Compartmental modeling showed that RIF decreased CLBL, CLLI, CLBK, and CLK0 but had no effect on CLLB, where B, L, I, K, and 0 represent blood, liver, intestine, kidney, and irreversible loss.", 
    "222": "[(11)C]-RSV can be used to dynamically and noninvasively quantify hepatobiliary transport and hepatic concentration of the drug, in the absence and presence of drug interactions, in rats and could be used for the same purpose in humans.", 
    "223": "This study investigated the effect of leptin (LEP) 2548A/G and leptin receptor (LEPR) Q223R polymorphisms on the levels of HDL, LDL, TG, and total cholesterol (t-chol). In addition, the interactions between examined polymorphisms, statin therapy and environmental factors on lipid profile were examined.", 
    "224": "Adult diabetic patients (n-418) were recruited from diabetes/endocrine clinics in north of Jordan. Lipid profile was measured using standard protocols. Genotyping of LEP 2548A/G and LEPR Q223R polymorphisms was carried out using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphisms.", 
    "225": "No significant association between LEP 2548A/G and LEPR genotypes and levels of HDL (P = 0.83), LDL (P = 0.40), TG (P = 0.23) and t-chol (P = 0.91). However, in patient on atorvastatin, those with GG or GA genotypes of LEP 2548 experienced significantly higher levels of LDL compared with AA genotype of LEP 2548 (P < 0.002). Patients with dyslipidemia had higher TG in comparison with those without (P < 0.03). Smokers had lower HDL and higher TG levels compared with none smokers or previous smokers (P < 0.002 and P < 0.02, respectively). Female patients tend to have a higher HDL in comparison with male patients (P < 0.05). Patients with HbA1c value greater than or equal to 7 had higher LDL and t-chol compared with patients who had an HbA1c levels of <7 (P < 0.02 and < 0.005, respectively). Patients with disease duration of 5 or more years had a lower HDL compared with those patients with duration of <5 years (P < 0.03).", 
    "226": "In conclusion, and although lipid profile regulation is a multifactorial process, -2548G/A LEP polymorphism seems to affect statins treatment response among diabetic patients. More studies are required to specifically define factors that influence lipid profiles interaction with statin treatment response especially among patients with diabetes.", 
    "227": "ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters play various roles in cancer biology and drug resistance, but their association with outcomes in serous epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is unknown.", 
    "228": "The relationship between clinical outcomes and ABC transporter gene expression in two independent cohorts of high-grade serous EOC tumors was assessed with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, analysis of expression microarray data, and immunohistochemistry. Associations between clinical outcomes and ABCA transporter gene single nucleotide polymorphisms were tested in a genome-wide association study. Impact of short interfering RNA-mediated gene suppression was determined by colony forming and migration assays. Association with survival was assessed with Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank tests. All statistical tests were two-sided.", 
    "229": "Associations with outcome were observed with ABC transporters of the \"A\" subfamily, but not with multidrug transporters. High-level expression of ABCA1, ABCA6, ABCA8, and ABCA9 in primary tumors was statistically significantly associated with reduced survival in serous ovarian cancer patients. Low levels of ABCA5 and the C-allele of rs536009 were associated with shorter overall survival (hazard ratio for death = 1.50; 95% confidence interval [CI] =1.26 to 1.79; P = 6.5e-6). The combined expression pattern of ABCA1, ABCA5, and either ABCA8 or ABCA9 was associated with particularly poor outcome (mean overall survival in group with adverse ABCA1, ABCA5 and ABCA9 gene expression = 33.2 months, 95% CI = 26.4 to 40.1; vs 55.3 months in the group with favorable ABCA gene expression, 95% CI = 49.8 to 60.8; P = .001), independently of tumor stage or surgical debulking status. Suppression of cholesterol transporter ABCA1 inhibited ovarian cancer cell growth and migration in vitro, and statin treatment reduced ovarian cancer cell migration.", 
    "230": "Expression of ABCA transporters was associated with poor outcome in serous ovarian cancer, implicating lipid trafficking as a potentially important process in EOC."
