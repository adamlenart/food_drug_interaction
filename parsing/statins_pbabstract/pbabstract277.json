Male Sprague-Dawley rats (200 +/- 25 g) were randomized into the following four groups: (1) control group, (2) isoproterenol-treated group, (3) atorvastatin-treated group, and (4) isoproterenol- and atorvastatin-treated group. Various serum and tissue parameters as well as histopathological studies were carried out in all groups. Isoproterenol administration produced severe myocardial damage and oxidative stress in rats. Atorvastatin treatment reduced myocardial infarction which has been reflected by improvement in serum parameters, ATPase activities and histopathological lesions. However, it could not reduce oxidative stress and hypertrophy induced by isoproterenol. Hence, it can be concluded that atorvastatin may protect myocardial infarction induced by isoproterenol independent of its antioxidant properties.",

    "2": "Using insurance claims and electronic medical record data, we identified 5101 whites and 1987 blacks with diabetes mellitus receiving care within a multispecialty group practice from 1997 to 2001. We assessed rates of annual low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level testing, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level control (<130 mg/dL [<3.37 mmol/L]), statin therapy, annual glycosylated hemoglobin level testing, glycosylated hemoglobin level control (<7.0%), and annual dilated eye examinations. We used logistic regression models with generalized estimating equations to adjust for race, year, race x year interactions, age, and sex.", 
    "3": "Rates of annual low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level testing increased from 39% to 64%, while the white-black disparity decreased from 14% to 4%; rates of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level control increased from 15% to 43%, while the white-black disparity decreased from 9% to 6% (P<.001 for both race x year interactions). Statin therapy rates increased from 20% to 37%; however, black patients remained less likely than white patients to receive therapy. The 1997 rates of annual glycosylated hemoglobin level testing (76%) and annual eye examinations (74%) were high, and there was no white-black disparity over time. Rates of glycosylated hemoglobin level control remained low (31%), and the white-black disparity remained constant at 10%.",

    "5": "Statins, the widely used inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis, also have immunomodulatory properties. Statins have recently been shown to have beneficial prophylactic and therapeutic effects in actively induced, short-term animal models of the autoimmune diseases multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, leading to clinical trials. We therefore investigated whether statins' protective effects could be reproduced in the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse, a spontaneous, chronic model of autoimmune diabetes. Mice were treated with 0, 1, 10, or 50 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) oral atorvastatin from 6 or 12 weeks of age, without effect on the rate or prevalence of diabetes development, islet infiltration, or islet major histocompatibility complex class II expression. However, there was clear evidence of a disease-relevant immunological effect of statins in vivo, since short-term (12-day) treatment significantly reduced the number of proinflammatory (gamma-interferon-producing) CD8 cells recognizing a dominant pathogenic epitope. This effect was absent in mice treated for longer periods, suggesting that atorvastatin loses efficiency in inhibiting autoantigen-specific T-cells over time. This observation may explain the discrepancy between the reported success of statins in acutely induced models and the lack of it in a chronic, spontaneous model of autoimmune disease and has implications for the adoption of such therapy in humans.", 
    "6": "Recommendations from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence say more people with high cholesterol levels should be prescribed statins. But some professionals have reservations. Currently 2 million people in England and Wales take statins. This figure will rise to 3.3 million with the change in threshold for statin treatment. The threshold for considering statin use has changed from a 30 per cent ten-year risk of developing cardiovascular disease to a 20 per cent or more risk. Statins in low dosage are available over the counter.", 
    "7": "Lipid rafts/caveolae are membrane platforms for signaling molecules that regulate various cellular functions, including cell survival. To better understand the role of rafts in tumor progression and therapeutics, we investigated the effect of raft disruption on cell viability and compared raft levels in human cancer cell lines versus their normal counterparts. Here, we report that cholesterol depletion using methyl-beta cyclodextrin caused anoikis-like apoptosis, which in A431 cells involved decreased raft levels, Bcl-xL down-regulation, caspase-3 activation, and Akt inactivation regardless of epidermal growth factor receptor activation. Cholesterol repletion replenished rafts on the cell surface and restored Akt activation and cell viability. Moreover, the breast cancer and the prostate cancer cell lines contained more lipid rafts and were more sensitive to cholesterol depletion-induced cell death than their normal counterparts. These results indicate that cancer cells contain increased levels of rafts and suggest a potential use of raft-modulating agents as anti-cancer drugs.", 
    "8": "Both angiotensin receptor antagonists and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors have been shown to attenuate cardiomyocyte hypertrophy after myocardial infarction. Whether combination treatment may be superior to either drug alone on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy remains unclear. After ligation of the left anterior descending artery, rats were randomized to both, one, or neither of the angiotensin receptor antagonists olmesartan (0.01, 0.1, 1, and 2 mg.kg-1.day-1) and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor pravastatin (5 mg.kg-1.day-1) for 4 wk. Each drug, when given alone, decreased cardiomyocyte sizes isolated by enzymatic dissociation at the border zone when compared with vehicles. However, compared with either drug alone, combined olmesartan and pravastatin prevent cardiomyocyte hypertrophy to a larger extent, which was further confirmed by downregulation of the left ventricular atrial natriuretic peptide mRNA. The myocardial endothelin-1 levels at the border zone were 6.5-fold higher (P<0.0001) in the vehicle group compared with the sham group, which can be inhibited after pravastatin administration. Combination treatment significantly attenuated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in a dose-dependent manner, although tissue endothelin-1 levels remained stable in combination groups of different olmesartan doses. Measurements of the arrhythmic score mirrored those of cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Dual therapy with pravastatin and olmesartan, which produced an additive reduction in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and cardiac fibrosis after myocardial infarction through different mechanisms, decreases the propensity of the heart to arrhythmogenesis. Pravastatin administration provided favorable ventricular remodeling, probably through decreased tissue endothelin-1 level. In contrast, olmesartan-related attenuated cardiomyocyte hypertrophy is independent of endothelin-1 pathway.", 
    "9": "In glomerular diseases with nephrotic syndrome or protracted severe proteinuria, alterations of the lipid metabolism occur and are characterized mainly by increase of LDL cholesterol and frequently also of triglycerides and by qualitative abnormalities of HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol. In all renal diseases, when renal insufficiency develops, hyperlipidemia also occurs, with a near-elective increase in VLDL and intermediate-density lipoprotein cholesterol and a decrease of mature HDL cholesterol. There is clear evidence that these abnormalities may induce cardiovascular complications and, probably, also an accelerated progression of the renal damage. The inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase, the so-called statins, are effective in controlling hypercholesterolemia, even in the more advanced stages of renal failure and in patients who are on maintenance dialysis. This antilipidemic effect of statins combines with other effects--antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and antithrombotic (called \"pleiotropic\" effects)--as a result of the inhibition of the mevalonate pathway induced by these agents. Also because of these non-lipid-dependent effects, statins could have an antiatherosclerotic and renoprotective effect, which has been demonstrated clearly in vivo on renal cells and in experimental models of nephropathy but is still less evident in human renal diseases. Ongoing large trials will establish more clearly whether such effects are present in renal patients.", 
    "10": "Chronic renal disease is accompanied by characteristic abnormalities of lipid metabolism, which appear as a consequence of nephrotic syndrome or renal insufficiency and are reflected in an altered apolipoprotein profile as well as elevated plasma lipid levels. Experimental and clinical studies have suggested a correlation between the progression of renal disease and dyslipidemia. High cholesterol and triglyceride plasma levels have been demonstrated to be independent risk factors for progression of renal disease in humans. The underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms for the relationship between lipid levels and progression of renal disease are not yet fully understood, although there are data that oxidative stress and insulin resistance may mediate the lipid-induced renal damage. In the animal model, lipid-lowering agents seem to ameliorate glomerular damage, preventing glomerulosclerosis and interstitial fibrosis. Although evidence from clinical studies indicates that statin therapy is associated with significant benefit in individuals with established chronic renal failure, whether lipid reduction can slow the renal functional decline awaits a primary renal outcome lipid-lowering therapy study.", 
    "11": "Excessive vascular oxidant stress has been implicated in cardiac transplant-associated arteriosclerosis (TxAA). In a recent placebo-controlled study of 40 cardiac transplant recipients, vitamin C 500 mg twice a day and vitamin E 400 IU twice a day for 1 year retarded the progression of TxAA, as assessed by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Endothelial dysfunction is a key feature of TxAA and reflects oxidant stress. We hypothesized that coronary endothelial dysfunction portends greater TxAA progression and a larger therapeutic response to anti-oxidant vitamins.",

    "15": "Combined hyperlipidemia is associated with endothelial dysfunction. Atorvastatin has lipid-lowering and pleiotropic properties, including a protective effect on endothelial function. This study investigated the short- and medium-term effects of therapy with atorvastatin and of its discontinuation on lipid lowering and endothelial function. In 33 patients with combined hyperlipidemia who had been randomized and treated for 6 weeks with 40 mg of atorvastatin twice daily (n = 23) or placebo (n = 10), fasting lipid levels and flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery were measured at baseline, after 12 hours, 1 week, and 6 weeks during therapy, and 36 hours after discontinuation of therapy. Thereafter, all patients received 20 mg/day of atorvastatin for another 6 weeks. In the atorvastatin group, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was decreased by 30% and 46% after 1 and 6 weeks, respectively (p <0.0001 for the 2 comparisons). In patients who already showed an impaired FMD at the beginning of the study (n = 15), atorvastatin caused a significant improvement in FMD, from 2.6% at baseline to 4.0% and 6.3% after 1 and 6 weeks, respectively (p <0.05 and <0.001). Thirty-six hours after withdrawal of atorvastatin, the FMD in this group decreased again to 2.8% (p <0.05), whereas low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level remained unchanged. The 6 patients with normal FMD at baseline showed no improvement in FMD during therapy or any decrease after withdrawal of the drug. In conclusion, only patients with endothelial dysfunction profit from high-dose atorvastatin treatment. When the treatment is abruptly discontinued, the effect on FMD disappears in 36 hours.", 
    "16": "Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) plays a central role in antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions, which may be mediated through its formation of biliverdin/bilirubin and carbon monoxide. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) induce in vitro HO-1 expression and are reported to have pleiotropic benefits that reduce oxidative stress in the vasculature. We characterized the effects of statins on in vivo HO-1 expression in various extravascular tissues: liver, lung, brain, and heart. Adult mice were orally administered simvastatin, lovastatin, atorvastatin, or rosuvastatin. HO activity significantly increased in a statin- and tissue-specific manner, with all statins increasing heart and lung activity within 24 h. Significant elevations of HO-1 protein and mRNA were also observed in heart and lung after atorvastatin treatment. We conclude that in vivo HO-1 induction is statin- and tissue-specific. Through this pathway, statins may confer antioxidant and anti-inflammatory actions in the vasculature and extravascular systems.",

An effective therapeutic intervention is urgently required. Statins are 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors that also have pleiotropic actions. They have been reported to increase the survival of septic or infectious patients. But the effect of simvastatin, a widely used statin, on sepsis-induced AKI is unknown. The effects of simvastatin and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha neutralizing antibody were studied in a clinically relevant model of sepsis-induced AKI using cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) in elderly mice. Simvastatin significantly improved CLP-induced mortality and AKI. Simvastatin attenuated CLP-induced tubular damage and reversed CLP-induced reduction of intrarenal microvascular perfusion and renal tubular hypoxia at 24 h. Simvastatin also restored towards normal CLP-induced renal vascular protein leak and serum TNF-alpha. Neither delayed simvastatin therapy nor TNF-alpha neutralizing antibody improved CLP-induced AKI.

    "35": "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in patients with end-stage renal disease. Besides traditional risk factors, disturbances in mineral and bone metabolism and inflammation are thought to be responsible for the increased risk of death. In the last years C-reactive protein (CRP) has gained a lot of attention in the general population, especially with regard to its link with atherosclerosis. Although several studies suggest that CRP may be useful as a parameter in predicting future cardiovascular events in both the general population and in patients with end-stage renal disease, there is doubt about the clinical evidence of this assumption. A statistical association between CRP and cardiovascular disease was observed in various studies, but the predictive power of this association is markedly diminished when adjusted for other risk factors. The relative contributions of CRP as a marker, as a causative agent, or as a consequence of atherosclerotic vascular disease are unclear, both in the general population and in the dialysis population. The CRP levels are highly variable and influenced by intercurrent events in dialysis patients. In dialysis patients, it is possible to reduce the CRP levels by statins, although these agents do not reduce the cardiovascular mortality in diabetic dialysis patients.", 
    "36": "Vascular calcification is clinically important in the development of cardiovascular disease. It is reported that hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) inhibited vascular calcification in several clinical trials. However, the mechanism is poorly understood. Recently, it has been suggested that apoptosis is one of the important processes regulating vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) calcification. In this study, we investigated the effect of statins on VSMC calcification by testing their effect on apoptosis, focusing in particular on regulation of the survival pathway mediated by growth arrest-specific gene 6 (Gas6), a member of the vitamin K-dependent protein family, and its receptor, Axl. In human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMC), statins significantly inhibited inorganic phosphate (Pi)-induced calcification in a concentration-dependent manner (reduced by 49% at 0.1 micromol/L atorvastatin). The inhibitory effect of statins was mediated by preventing apoptosis, which was increased by Pi in a concentration-dependent manner, and not by inhibiting sodium-dependent phosphate cotransporter (NPC) activity, another mechanism regulating HASMC calcification. Furthermore, the antiapoptotic effect of statins was dependent on restoration of Gas6, whose expression was downregulated by Pi. Restoration of Gas6 mRNA by statins was mediated by mRNA stabilization, and not by an increase in transcriptional activity. Suppression of Gas6 using small interfering RNA and the Axl-extracellular domain abolished the preventive effect of statins on Pi-induced apoptosis and calcification. These data demonstrate that statins protected HASMC from Pi-induced calcification by inhibiting apoptosis via restoration of the Gas6-Axl pathway.",

The median year of treatment initiation was 1999 and the mean duration of follow-up was 39 months. The initial prescription remained unchanged at year 1 for most patients (69%), whereas 17% discontinued drug treatment.

    "42": "Vascular endothelial dysfunction is a complex phenomenon that is caused by an imbalance of vasodilator and vasoconstrictor factors that regulate the equilibrium-maintaining vascular tone. In the early phase of hypercholesterolemia, endothelial dysfunction precedes vascular wall lesions. One of the earliest recognizable benefits of treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) is the normalization of endothelium-dependent relaxation in hypercholesterolemia; this effect occurs before significant lowering of serum cholesterol levels. Recent insights into cellular mechanisms indicate that statins promote vasorelaxation by upregulating the expression of endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase, activating the phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway, inhibiting superoxide anion generation and endothelin synthesis, and by anti-inflammatory effects. These effects appear to be linked to the inhibition of geranylgeranylation of small G proteins such as Rho and Rac GTPases. In this regard, statins preserve endothelial function through the improvement of NO bioavailability and the reduction of oxidative stress, thereby shifting the balance from vasoconstriction to vasodilation. This review highlights the various mechanisms underlying the vasculoprotective effects of statins, independent of their effects on cholesterol lowering.", 
    "43": "Protection of ischemic myocardium has been attempted by a variety of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical methods. When the coronary intervention is not indicated by some reasons in patients with ischemic heart failure, medical treatments are expected to offer cardioprotection against the persistence of stenotic/occlusive lesions of the epicardial coronary artery. The pharmaceuticals such as the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, angiotensin receptor blocker, beta blocker, Ca antagonist, ATP-sensitive K channel opener and statin, or non-pharmaceutical approaches such as physical exercise, cardiac resynchronization, ventricular assist devices, and preconditioning upon ischemic insults appear to improve myocardial endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS) function. Such eNOS activation contributes to amelioration of the cardiac dysfunction and remodeling induced by myocardial ischemia. Therefore, based on clinical evidence and basic research on clinical demand, we postulate a concept of 'myocardial endothelial NO activator' from the standpoint of mechanistic insights beyond the class-effects of each pharmaceutical category and each non-pharmaceutical intervention. In addition to such continuous eNOS activation for treating chronic ischemic heart failure, rapid eNOS activation in the setting of acute ischemic events upon chronic myocardial ischemia by new strategies such as postconditioning seems to be also essential for developing further effective anti-heart-failure therapies.",

However, the effects of hypertension on the risk of coronary events and stroke have not been well established in Japanese hypercholesterolemic patients. This study aimed to determine the relationship between the risk of coronary events or stroke and blood pressure and cholesterol levels during low-dose simvastatin treatment using data from the Japan Lipid Intervention Trial (J-LIT) study (a large scale nationwide cohort study). In the present study, 47,294 hypercholesterolemic patients were treated with open-labeled simvastatin (5 to 10 mg/day) for 6 years by a large number of physicians in a clinical setting. The adjusted incidence rates of coronary events in males and females were 8.9 and 2.3 and those of stroke were 17.6 and 11.3/1000 patients during the 6-year period, respectively. The incidence rate of stroke was higher than that of coronary events in both males and females. An obvious sex difference was observed in terms of the incidence of coronary events. The risk of coronary events, stroke, and total cardiovascular events were increased, with elevations in blood pressure observed in patients treated for hypercholesterolemia. The risk of total cardiovascular events in the groups exhibiting less lipid control increased, with lower blood pressure levels than those of the well-controlled group. For patients with hypercholesterolemia and hypertension, blood pressure should be strictly controlled in order to prevent both coronary events and stroke, and the serum total cholesterol levels should be maintained at low levels as well.", 
    "45": "The proliferation and migration of arterial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are key events in the vascular restenosis that frequently follows angioplasty. Furthermore, SMC migration and neointimal hyperplasia are promoted by degradation of the extracellular matrix by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Because we demonstrated previously that the proinflammatory and proatherogenic cytokine interleukin-18 (IL-18) stimulates SMC proliferation (Chandrasekar, B., Mummidi, S., Valente, A. J., Patel, D. N., Bailey, S. R., Freeman, G. L., Hatano, M., Tokuhisa, T., and Jensen, L. E. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 26263-26277), we investigated whether IL-18 induces SMC migration in an MMP-dependent manner and whether the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor atorvastatin can inhibit this response. IL-18 treatment increased both mRNA and protein expression of MMP9 in human coronary artery SMCs. Gel shift, enzyme-linked immunosorbent, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays revealed a strong induction of IL-18-mediated AP-1 (c-Fos, c-Jun, and Fra-1) and NF-kappaB (p50 and p65) activation and stimulation of MMP9 promoter-dependent reporter gene activity in an AP-1- and NF-kappaB-dependent manner. Ectopic expression of p65, c-Fos, c-Jun, and Fra-1 induced MMP9 promoter activity. Specific antisense or small interfering RNA reagents for these transcription factors reduced IL-18-mediated MMP9 transcription. Furthermore, IL-18 stimulated SMC migration in an MMP9-dependent manner. Atorvastatin effectively suppressed IL-18-mediated AP-1 and NF-kappaB activation, MMP9 expression, and SMC migration. Together, our results indicate for the first time that the proatherogenic cytokine IL-18 induces human coronary artery SMC migration in an MMP9-dependent manner. Atorvastatin inhibits IL-18-mediated aortic SMC migration and has therapeutic potential for attenuating the progression of atherosclerosis and restenosis.", 
    "46": "Sepsis occurs when the immune system responds to a localised infection at a systemic level, thereby causing tissue damage and organ dysfunction. Statins have proven health benefits in many diseases involving vascular inflammation and injury. Recent animal data suggest that the administration of a statin before a sepsis-inducing insult reduces morbidity and improves survival. The immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects of statins, collectively referred to as pleiotropic effects, lend biological plausibility to such findings. Limited human data hint at reduced mortality rates in bacteraemic patients, and a reduced risk of sepsis in patients with bacterial infections concurrently taking statins. These lines of evidence point to a potential new treatment and prevention modality for sepsis. The stage is set for randomised controlled clinical trials that will determine whether statins represent a safe and beneficial treatment in critically ill, septic patients and whether statins are effective at preventing sepsis in high-risk clinical settings.",

    "53": "Bile acid sequestrants (BAS) continue to command a position in the treatment of dyslipidemias 25 years after their introduction. Partial diversion of the enterohepatic circulation using BAS depletes the endogenous bile acid pool by approximately 40%, thus stimulating an increase in bile acid synthesis from cholesterol, which lowers low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by 15 to 26%. Three BAS are currently used for treating hypercholesterolemia in the United States: the conventional sequestrants, cholestyramine and colestipol, and the specifically engineered BAS, colesevelam hydrochloride (HCl). Compared with conventional BAS, colesevelam HCl has enhanced specificity, greater affinity, and higher capacity for binding bile acids, due to its polymer structure engineered for bile acid sequestration. BAS are not absorbed by the intestine and thus have no systemic drug-drug interactions, but may interfere with the absorption of some drugs. Although BAS monotherapy effectively lowers LDL-C, combination therapy, especially with BAS and statins, is becoming increasingly common due to complementary mechanisms of action. Low-dose statin plus BAS combinations lead to greater or similar LDL-C reductions compared with high-dose statin monotherapy and may have a better safety profile. Combinations of BAS with nonstatin lipid-lowering agents, including niacin, fibrates, and cholesterol absorption inhibitors, may be useful in those patients who require intensive lipid-lowering, but are statin intolerant. BAS treatment can significantly reduce coronary artery disease (CAD) progression and the risk of CAD-associated outcomes. It is also becoming clear that BAS and other therapies that manipulate the bile acid synthetic pathway may have clinically useful therapeutic effects on other metabolic disorders including type 2 diabetes.",

While serious adverse events are rare, less serious events are frequently seen. Published guidelines recommend initial screening labs as well as ongoing monitoring of liver enzymes during therapy. Up to 5% of patients will have some muscle complaints while taking statins. Therefore, primary care clinicians will often be faced with real or potential complications of statin therapy. There are well established risk factors for development of these complications. Being aware of a patient's risk and using the lowest effective dose minimizes the occurrence of adverse events. The great majority of these abnormalities either do not require discontinuation of therapy or require only brief interruption of therapy. Judicious and systematic use of laboratory testing will minimize needless evaluation and premature discontinuation of statin therapy.",

    "63": "Atherosclerosis is a progressive pathological process based on endothelial dysfunction and chronic inflammation. Monocytes, macrophages, and modified lipoproteins, especially oxidized LDLs (oxLDLs), play a fundamental role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Monocytes evolve into macrophages in the vascular wall and then accumulate oxLDLs, forming foam cells. OxLDLs are toxic and activate foam cells, stimulate the replication of macrophages and their migration into atherosclerotic plaque, and increase the expression of metaloproteinases. Macrophages bind oxLDLs through many types of receptors, among them scavenger receptors. One of these is CD36, a membrane glycoprotein expressed by endothelial cells, adipocytes, smooth and skeletal muscle cells, cardiomiocytes, platelets, monocytes, and macrophages. CD36 recognizes and binds many ligands, such as oxLDLs, long-chain fatty acids, collagen, thrombospondin 1, apoptotic cells, anionic phospholipids, and Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes. CD36 is involved in many processes, e.g. inner immune system responses, removal of apoptotic cells and Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes, and the transport of long-chain fatty acids, and it also mediates collagen and thrombospondin action. Recent reports indicate that CD36 may play a role in the development of atherosclerosis. An animal model revealed that lack of CD36 expression restrains atheroslerosis. Increased expression of CD36 was shown in atheroslerotic plaque and damaged vascular tissue. Contradictory data about the effects of antiatherosclerotic drugs on CD36 expression indicate the necessity for further investigation of the role of CD36 in the development of atherosclerosis.",

For this reason, testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) in older men with late-onset hypogonadism has been advocated. Testosterone has an anti-resorptive effect that may increase bone density at lumbar spine. Androgens may also have cardio-protective effects by improving endothelial function and reducing the risk factors for atherosclerosis. It has been proposed that atherosclerosis and osteoporosis share common pathophysiological mechanisms. The role of inflammatory cells, citokynes and calcium deposition into the vascular walls has been reviewed to explore the causal nexus between these frequently associated diseases. Experimental studies indicate that a deregulation in the commitment of pluripotent mesenchimal stem cells toward specialized phenotypes might participate in the development of these conditions. The crossed-over beneficial effect of bisphosphonate on the cardiovascular system and statins on bone metabolism supports the research for a unitary pharmacological approach to both conditions. The findings that androgens regulate mesenchimal cell differentiation, as well as body composition, lipid profile and bone metabolism, have claimed a role for TRT in aging men with late onset-hypogonadism.", 
    "75": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) and osteoporosis (OP) are public health problems with numerous epidemiological links and important economic consequences. Recent studies have demonstrated that CVD and cardiovascular mortality are associated with reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and bone fractures. These two conditions may be sustained by similar or common pathophysiological mechanisms and risk factors. There are several matrix proteins, such as type 1 collagen, proteoglycan, osteopontin, and osteonectin, which are found in bone and vascular matrix components. Matrix proteins play an important role both in bone formation and in the development of atherosclerosis. Estrogens also play a role in both CVD and OP through their effects on cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-alpha and osteoprotegerin (OPG). The lack of estrogens induces an increase in these cytokines and a decrease in OPG, both implicated in the mechanisms of bone loss and atherogenesis. An additional link between CVD and OP seems to be related to the action of some drugs, such as bisphosphonates, statins and raloxifene. Several studies suggest that the mechanism of action of these drugs at cellular level may not be mutually exclusive, acting either in bone or in atherosclerotic plaque. However, further studies are necessary to define the relationship between CVD and OP more specifically and to understand the complex interaction of similar or common risk factors and genetic or molecular determinants.", 
    "76": "Simvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, has long been thought to exert its benefits by reducing cholesterol synthesis, and has been shown to significantly reduce cardiovascular events and mortality in patients with or without coronary artery disease. However, it is still unknown whether acute administration of simvastatin beneficially affects the cardiac function prior or during ischemia-reperfusion. The aim of this study is to evaluate the cardioprotective effect of acute simvastatin treatment on isolated rat hearts or isolated ischemia-reperfusion hearts. Hearts were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats and attached to a Langendorff apparatus. The isolated hearts with or without ischemia (15 min) and reperfusion (60 min) were perfused with different concentrations of simvastatin. The parameters of cardiac function (such as left ventricular developed pressure [LVDP], +dp/dt max, and -dp/dt max), heart rate, and coronary flow were recorded. Simvastatin (3-30 micromol/l) significantly increased LVDP, +dp/dt max, and -dp/dt max in isolated rat hearts perfused for 60 min. Heart rate was depressed by 30 micromol/l simvastatin and the coronary flow was increased by 10 and 30 micromol/l simvastatin. At a concentration of 100 micromol/l simvastatin, worsening of heart function and subsequent cardiac arrest occurred. Administration of simvastatin (3-30 micromol/l) significantly preserved cardiac function detected by LVDP, +dp/dt max, and -dp/dt max in the isolated ischemia/reperfused (15/60 min) rat hearts. Simvastatin also significantly decreased heart rate at 30 micromol/l, and increased coronary flow at 10 and 30 micromol/l in these rat hearts. However, the protective effect of simvastatin reverted to increased damage at 100 micromol/l. Only 3 micromol/l simvastatin pretreatment before 15/60 min ischemia-reperfusion altered LVDP, +dp/dt max, and -dp/dt max. Both heart rate and coronary flow were unaltered after simvastatin pretreatment. Since simvastatin at a concentration lower than 100 micromol/l exerted beneficial effects on cardiac function in isolated perfused rat hearts, it could be applied just after myocardial ischemia and reperfusion.",

From a pathophysiological point of view, combining complementary drugs that act on different cholesterol metabolism pathways is particularly interesting. This interest has been confirmed in clinical studies combining ezetimibe and statins, which inhibit cholesterol synthesis in the liver. Adding ezetimibe (10 mg/d) to statin therapy decreased LDL cholesterol by as much as an additional 20%.

Both EP2306 and EP2302 inhibited squalene synthase activity dose-dependently. In rabbit liver microsomes, the IC50 values were 33 microM for EP2306 and 0.6 microM for EP2302 whereas in human liver microsomes, they were 63 microM for EP2306 and 1 microM for EP2302. Both EP2300 compounds inhibited cholesterol production by HepG2 cells dose dependently with IC50 values of 13.3 microM for EP2306 and 3 microM for EP2302. Furthermore, both EP2300 compounds and simvastatin significantly reduced triglyceride synthesis and apoB secretion and increased LDL receptor expression and LDL uptake in HepG2 cells. In summary, we have shown that EP2300 compounds are potent inhibitors of squalene synthase activity in rabbit and human liver microsomes and also they are effective inhibitors of cholesterol and triglyceride biosynthesis in HepG2 cells.

Orally administered cholesterol-lowering HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (known as statins), which exhibit immunomodulatory properties and are effective in treatment of the MS model EAE, are being tested in MS. As atorvastatin can enhance protective Th2 responses and has a different mechanism of action than glatiramer acetate (GA), a parenterally administered immunomodulatory agent approved for MS treatment, we tested whether the combination of these agents could be beneficial in EAE. Combination therapy using suboptimal doses of atorvastatin and GA prevented or reversed clinical and histologic EAE. Secretion of proinflammatory Th1 cytokines was reduced--and conversely Th2 cytokine secretion was increased--in these mice, but not in mice treated with each drug alone at the same doses. Monocytes treated with the combination of suboptimal doses of atorvastatin and GA secreted an antiinflammatory type II cytokine pattern and, when used as APCs, promoted Th2 differentiation of naive myelin-specific T cells. Our results demonstrate that agents with different mechanisms of immune modulation can combine in a synergistic manner for the treatment of CNS autoimmunity and provide rationale for testing the combination of atorvastatin and GA in MS.",

HMDSO surfaces were activated by the introduction of an OH group and/or O(2)-functional groups by O(2)-plasma treatment. In contrast, titanium surfaces showed no appreciable compositional changes by O(2)-plasma treatment. The QCM-D technique enabled evaluation even at the adsorption behavior of a substance with a low molecular weight such as simvastatin. The largest amount of SVA was adsorbed on O(2)-plasma treated HMDSO surfaces compared to untreated titanium, HMDSO-coated titanium, and O(2)-plasma treated titanium. These findings suggested that the adsorption of SVA was enhanced on more hydrophilic surfaces concomitant with the presence of an OH group and/or O(2)-functional group resulting from the O(2)-plasma treatment, and that an organic film of HMDSO followed by O(2)-plasma treatment is a promising method for the adsorption of SVA in dental implant systems.",

    "96": "Cerivastatin, a lipid-lowering agent, was voluntarily withdrawn from the market because of high risk of rhabdomyolysis when used as monotherapy and as comedication with fibrates, especially gemfibrozil. Thereafter, investigators found a five-fold increase in the area under the curve (AUC) when cerivastatin was used as comedication with gemfibrozil and theorized that the increase was associated with inhibition of the hepatic uptake and metabolism. By contrast, a number of pharmacoepidemiological investigations--one of which involved evaluation of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) database for suspected adverse drug reactions and 11 cohort studies of statin and fibrate users in United States showed the risk of rhabdomyolysis to be greater in cerivastatin than in other statins used in either monotherapy or in comedication with fibrates, especially gemfibrozil. This incident regarding risk of rhabdomyolysis in cerivastatin monotherapy was taken to court in the United States and unpublished company (manufacturer of cerivastatin) documents were opened. The incident was then analyzed and discussed in the Journal of American Medical Association (JAMA) as a concern of the current US post-marketing surveillance system. The company's action and timing were judged and found to be inappropriate (although companies of this sort generally have insurmountable conflicts of interest), and the work of the US regulatory system and funding for post-marketing safety management were found to be insufficient. On the basis of the current situation, the authors and editors recommend further improvement of post-marketing regulations including the establishment of an independent drug safety board to oversee post-marketing surveillance. Among the opened, unpublished data, was the finding that cerivastatin obviously induced myopathy in a dose-dependent manner when administrated as monotherapy. As for other statins, only limited data was available for the relationship between the dosage and the rate of myopathy. For the safety use of statins, this should be clarified by proper surveillance system.", 
    "97": "Cyclosporine is an indispensable immunosuppressant used in organ transplant patients, who frequently manifest hyperlipidemia. Statins, which are cholesterol-lowering agents, are often combined with cyclosporine in the treatment of hyperlipidemia of organ transplant patients. Since cyclosporine is a substrate and inhibitor of CYP3A4, researchers suspect that the immunosuppressant inhibits CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of statins, leading to an increase in statin plasma concentration and infrequently resulting in rhabdomyolysis. However, a number of clinical trials have shown cyclosporine to increase the plasma concentration of all developed statins, including those not metabolized by CYP3A4. Furthemore, recent mechanistic studies have shown organic anion transporting peptides (OATP) C to mediate the uptake of some statins and cyclosporine has been shown to inhibit the uptake via OATP-C in cultured cells. Therefore, the inhibition of hepatic uptake of statins is considered to be one of the mechanisms by which cyclosporine incrementally increases statin blood concentration. However, most current Japanese package inserts of statins give no information on change in pharmacokinetic parameters such as AUC and Cmax in the combined medication with cyclosporine. Furthermore, in the Japanese package inserts, it is either stated that cyclosporine inhibits CYP3A4-mediated metabolism or no comment is made on the mechanism. The package insert should properly provide available quantitative information on the change of pharmacokinetic parameters and the probable mechanism of action.",

The diagnosis was confirmed at the enzymatic and molecular level. In vivo brain MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) was performed at 3.0 T, and one-dimensional and two-dimensional in vitro NMR spectroscopy of body fluids of the patient was performed at 11.7 T. Additionally, we measured 1D (1)H-NMR spectra of urine of seven patients with a total of four different inborn errors of leucine metabolism. Increased concentrations of 3HIVA, 3MGA (cis and trans) and 3MG were observed in the NMR spectra of the patient's urine. In the cerebrospinal fluid, the 3HIVA concentration was 10 times higher than in the plasma of the patient and only the cis isomer of 3MGA was observed. In vivo brain MRSI showed an abnormal resonance at 1.28 ppm that may be caused by 3HIVA. Comparison of (1)H-NMR spectra of urine samples from all eight patients studied, representing five different inborn errors of leucine metabolism, showed that each disease has typical NMR characteristics. Our leukoencephalopathy patient suffers from a late-onset form of 3-methylglutaconic aciduria type I. In the literature, only very few adult patients with this conditions have been described, and 3HIVA accumulation in white matter in the brain has not been presented before in these patients. Our data demonstrate that (1)H-NMR spectroscopy of urine can easily discriminate between the known inborn errors of leucine metabolism and provide the correct diagnosis.",

The assay exhibited a linear dynamic range of 2-500 ng/mL for fluvastatin in human plasma. The lower limit of quantification was 2 ng/mL with a relative standard deviation of less than 5%. Acceptable precision and accuracy were obtained for concentrations over the standard curve range.

Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) that lower LDL and triglyceride levels are widely used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Recently, a new class of drugs, cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors, which significantly raise HDL and lower LDL, has been developed. Torcetrapib, a CETP inhibitor, has been shown to be effective, safe and well tolerated when used in combination with atorvastatin therapy. Torcetrapib has been shown to increase HDL cholesterol levels by 46% when given alone and by 61% when given in combination with atorvastatin, as well as to decrease LDL cholesterol levels by more than that achieved by atorvastatin alone. When the dosage of torcetrapib was doubled (at maximum tolerated dose), HDL increased by over 100%. Combination therapy appeared safe and well tolerated. Large trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of torcetrapib in combination therapy with atorvastatin are now in progress in order to establish whether CETP inhibition in combined therapy with statins will reduce the risk for atherosclerosis.",

Statins induce apoptosis in different cell culture systems including rat neonatal cardiomyocytes. We investigated possible effects of different statins in vitro in human adult cardiac myocytes on the expression of proteins thought to be involved in the regulation of apoptosis such as Mcl-1, an inhibitor of apoptosis, Bax, an inducer of apoptosis, as well as on cytoplasmic histone-associated-DNA-fragments. Human adult cardiac myocytes (HACM) were treated with different statins at concentrations from 0.01 to 5 microM for up to 96 h. Whereas the lipophilic statin simvastatin at a concentration of 5 microM downregulated Mcl-1 mRNA by 49%, the hydrophilic pravastatin had no effect. Bax mRNA levels were not affected by neither of the statins. Simvastatin but not pravastatin reduced Mcl-1 protein expression whereas Bax protein was not detectable in HACM as determined by Western blotting. Simvastatin, atorvastatin and fluvastatin induced an up to seven-fold increase in histone-associated-DNA-fragments whereas pravastatin did not. Simvastatin up regulated histone-associated-DNA-fragments dose-dependently, and mevalonate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate reversed this effect to control levels. Our results show that lipophilic statins can induce a pro-apoptotic state in human adult cardiac myocytes in vitro. We speculate that, similar to findings in animal models, statins might be involved in the attenuation of cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling in humans by modulating the balance between cell survival and apoptosis.",

In the first set of experiments (early phase of osteogenesis) CFW/Ll mice were randomly divided into three groups. Two groups were injected with Moloney-murine sarcoma virus (Mo-MSV) into right thighs to induce orthotopic bone formation. Mice in the experimental group received fluvastatin for 11 consecutive days. Thirty days after Mo-MSV inoculation, total serum cholesterol, triglycerides, high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, alkaline phosphatase (AP) were measured and bone mineral increase was calculated. In the second set of experiments (late phase of osteogenesis), fluvastatin was administered from day 11 after Mo-MSV inoculation for 20 consecutive days. Fluvastatin administration in the early phase of osteogenesis made no significant difference in average bone increase compared with mice receiving placebo. Lipid profile and AP were not significantly affected. During late phase of osteogenesis, the average increase in femural dry mass was significantly lower in the group of mice receiving fluvastatin than in the control group. Also, Mo-MSV-initiated tumors disappeared earlier in mice treated with fluvastatin. This may be attributed to the antioncogenic potential of fluvastatin. These results also point out that orthotopic bone formation at the sites of Mo-MSV inoculation in mice seems to be a useful model to examine the pleiotropic effects of statins.",

The correlation between statin cardiotoxicity, assessed in vitro, and cardiac efficiency, investigated in vivo has not been estimated so far. The aim of the present experiment was to establish the impact of high-dose simvastatin on the hemodynamic parameters, especially on myocardium efficiency, after continuous infusion of dopamine. Moreover, hemodynamic interaction between simvastatin and nifedipine, metabolized by the same izoenzyme CYP3A4 was examined. The experiments were performed on twenty seven New Zealand white rabbits. The animals were divided into four groups receiving: 0.2% methylcellulose (MC) (control group), nifedipine, simvastatin or simvastatin + nifedipine, for 14 days (p.o.). The following hemodynamic parameters were estimated: cardiac output index (COI), heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), mean blood pressure (MBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and total peripheral resistance index (TPRI). The registration of hemodynamic parameters was performed by Doppler method (Hugo Sachs Electronic Haemodyn). Dopamine did not cause a statistically significant increase in COI in rabbits receiving simvastatin alone or concomitantly with nifedipine. Nifedipine significantly lowered COI, BP and HR in rabbits if given simultaneously with simvastatin. In conclusion, administration of nifedipine may elicit detrimental impact on statin therapy, resulting in the worsening of cardiac performance. This may suggest another mechanism of drug-drug interaction than the one based on CYP3A4 inhibition.", 
    "151": "Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are highly prevalent among older men and have a negative impact on health-related quality of life. Frequent comorbidity with potential prostatic disease adds complexity to the management of male LUTS. In this review, we discuss the pathophysiological conditions that underlie male LUTS, and examine the relationship between symptoms and urodynamic findings. The contribution of bladder dysfunction to male LUTS, with a particular emphasis on overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms, is explored. We also consider pharmacotherapeutic options for male LUTS. Pharmacotherapies that target the prostate (alpha1-receptor antagonists and 5alpha-reductase inhibitors) often fail to alleviate OAB symptoms, and may not be the most appropriate therapy for men with storage LUTS. Multiple studies have suggested that antimuscarinic therapy alone or in combination with alpha1-receptor antagonists improve OAB symptoms in men with and without bladder outlet obstruction. Although these agents may represent appropriate first-line therapies for men with OAB symptoms, the therapeutic potential of antimuscarinics alone or in combination with alpha1-receptor antagonists in this population should be evaluated in large-scale, well-designed clinical trials.", 
    "152": "Activation of endothelial cells is an incipient process in atherogenesis and leads to induction of the cellular adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1. Their expression can be induced by cytokines as well as other inflammatory mediators. The effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) include mediation of anti-inflammatory properties. The aim of this study was the comparison of cerivastatin and simvastatin-mediated effects on inflammation-induced ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression in human umbilical venous endothelial cells (HUVEC). In HUVEC, TNF-alpha induced ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 mRNA and surface expression. Co-incubation with cerivastatin, but not simvastatin reduced TNF-alpha-induced up-regulation of ICAM-1 surface expression whereas both statins reduced VCAM-1 surface expression; all reductions in surface expression correlated with an increase in the soluble forms of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in cell culture supernatants. Mevalonate and nonsteroidal isoprenoids significantly reversed protein expression and shedding. Both statins caused an aggravation of TNF-alpha-induced ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 mRNA expression which was dependent on RNA synthesis. The statin-mediated increase in ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 mRNA expression correlated with the degradation of IkappaBa. Nuclear translocation of p65 was not significantly affected by statin-treatment of cytokine-treated cells. We conclude that cerivastatin and simvastatin reduce TNF-alpha-induced up-regulation of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 surface expression via increased protein shedding mediated by HMG-CoA reductase inhibition and subsequent isoprenoid depletion.", 
    "153": "Heme oxygenase (HO)-1 is the inducible isoform of the first and rate-controlling enzyme of heme degradation. HO-1 is up-regulated by a host of oxidative stress stimuli and has potent cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory functions via decreasing tissue levels of the prooxidant heme along with production of bilirubin and the signaling gas carbon monoxide. This review deals with recent findings that highlight the emerging significance of HO-1 in cardiovascular disease. Evidence is presented on how heme and various oxidative stress stimuli may cause endothelial cell dysfunction and how HO-1 may counteract the detrimental effects of oxidative stress in the endothelium. Recent advances in the understanding of the role of endothelial HO-1 for the regulation of the inflammatory response are summarized, including the modulation of leukocyte recruitment and transmigration through the endothelial barrier. Furthermore, experimental evidence from various cell culture and animal models is discussed which suggests an association of HO-1 with the complex sequence of events that cause atherosclerosis. In the second part of the review we present potential strategies that apply HO-1 as a therapeutic target in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Specific inducers of HO-activity which may ultimately lead to the development of clinically relevant pharmacological applications are introduced.", 
    "154": "Reactive oxygen species (ROS) contribute to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis in part by promoting vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) growth. Previously we demonstrated that cyclophilin A (CyPA) is a secreted oxidative stress-induced factor (SOXF) that promotes inflammation, VSMC growth, and endothelial cell apoptosis. However, the mechanisms that regulate CyPA secretion are unknown. In this study, we hypothesized that ROS-induced CyPA secretion from VSMC requires a highly regulated process of vesicle transport, docking, and fusion at the plasma membrane. Conditioned medium and plasma membrane sheets were prepared by exposing VSMC to 1 micromol/L LY83583, which generates intracellular superoxide. A vesicular transport mechanism was confirmed by colocalization at the plasma membrane with vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP). CyPA transport to the plasma membrane and secretion were significantly increased by LY83583. Reduction of VAMP-2 expression by small interfering RNA inhibited LY83583-induced CyPA secretion. Pretreatment with 3 micromol/L cytochalasin D, an actin depolymerizing agent, abrogated CyPA secretion. Infection with dominant-negative RhoA and Cdc42 adenovirus inhibited CyPA secretion by 72% and 63%, respectively, whereas dominant-negative Rac1 had a small effect (11%). Pretreatment with the Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632 (3 to 30 micromol/L) and myosin II inhibitor blebbistatin (1 to 10 micromol/L) inhibited CyPA secretion in a dose-dependent manner. Simvastatin (3 to 30 micromol/L) also dose-dependently inhibited LY83583-induced CyPA secretion likely via decreased isoprenylation of small GTPases. Our findings define a novel VSMC vesicular secretory pathway for CyPA that involves actin remodeling and myosin II activation via RhoA-, Cdc42-, and Rho kinase-dependent signaling events.", 
    "155": "In this work, a liquid chromatography stability-indicating method was developed and applied to study the hydrolytic behavior of simvastatin in different pH values and temperatures. The selected chromatographic conditions were a C18 column; acetonitrile-28 mM phosphate buffer solution, pH 4 (65 + 35) as the mobile phase; 251 degrees C column temperature; and flow rate 1 mL/min. The developed method exhibited an adequate repeatability and reproducibility (coefficient of variation 0.54 and 0.74%, respectively) and a recovery higher than 98%. Furthermore, the detection and quantification limits were 9.1 x 10(-7) and 2.8 x 10(-6) M, respectively. The degradation of simvastatin fitted to pseudo-first order kinetics. The degradation was pH dependent, being much higher at alkaline pH than at acid pH. Activation energy, kinetic rate constants (k) at different temperatures, the half life (t1/2) and the time for 10% degradation to occur (t90) values are also reported.",

Consequently there is a big interest of IHD prevention options in diabetic patients, not only by hypertension therapy, but also by hypolipidemic treatment. That is why the results of FIELD study were expected with a great interest. FIELD study randomized 9 795 patients with the Type II diabetes mellitus and initial values of total cholesterol 3.0 to 6.5 mmol/l and in addition with total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol rate > or = 4.0 or with the values of plasmatic triglycerides between 1.0 and 5.0 mmol/l for treatment with 200 mg of micronized phenophibrate or placebo. As phenophibrate positively influences the typical lipid disorder at diabetic patients, the throughout positive results of phenophibrate had been expected. Study did not fulfil the primary objective of the study of coronary deaths/ non fatal myocardial infarctions (insignificant decrease by 11%). Although phenophibrate significantly decreased non fatal myocardial infarctions and myocardial revascularizations, total mortality and cardiovascular mortality were not positively influenced and they even show non significant aggravating trend. Moreover, the positive effect of phenophibrate on non fatal myocardial infarctions and revascularizations was present only at the persons who had not experienced a cardiovascular disease and only at the persons under 65 years. Phenophibrate positively influenced some diabetic micro vascular complications (nephropathy and retinopathy). Thus, the results of FIELD study present a disappointment and that is why the recommendations of the statin therapy as a priority therapy of dislipidemia stay unchanged also for the patients with Type II diabetes mellitus.", 
    "157": "Various indices have been used for the diagnosis and prognosis of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) is a logarithmically transformed ratio of molar concentrations of triglycerides to HDL-cholesterol. The strong correlation of AIP with lipoprotein particle size may explain its high predictive value. Here we summarize data on AIP calculated in 8394 subjects from 6 population and clinical studies.", 
    "158": "AIP values increase with increasing CV risk. Thus umbilical cord, young children, healthy women have values below 0.1 while men and subjects with CV risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia have increasing values up to 0.4. Based on these data we suggest that AIP values of -0.3 to 0.1 are associated with low, 0.1 to 0.24 with medium and above 0.24 with high CV risk. In the population study men had higher AIP values than women. In a cohort undergoing coronary angiography AIP, in model that included age, BMI, waist circumference, type 2. DM, blood pressure, smoking, TG, TC, LDL-C, apoB, HDL-C, and TC/HDL-C, AIP was the best predictor of positive findings. AIP was also a highly sensitive marker of differences of lipoprotein profiles in families of patients with premature myocardial infarction and control families. Treatment with ciprofibrate, and combination of statin and niacin dramatically decreased AIP. Combination with hypoglycemic therapy that included pioglitazone decreased AIP in patiens with type 2. diabetes.",

    "160": "Organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) mediate the uptake of a broad range of compounds into cells. Substrates for members of the OATP family include bile salts, hormones, and steroid conjugates as well as drugs like the HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors (statins), cardiac glycosides, anticancer agents like methotrexate, and antibiotics like rifampicin. OATPs are expressed in a variety of different tissues, including intestine, liver, kidney, and brain, suggesting that they play a critical role in drug absorption, distribution, and excretion. The identification and functional characterisation of naturally occurring variations in genes encoding human OATP (SLCO) family members is in the focus of transporter research. As a result of their broad substrate spectrum and their wide tissue distribution, altered transport characteristics or protein localisation can contribute significantly to interindividual variations of drug effects. The analysis of the consequences of genetic variations in genes encoding transport proteins may, therefore, contribute to a better understanding of interindividual differences in drug effects and to individualise treatment regimens with drugs that are substrates for human OATP proteins. In this review, we summarise the current knowledge on genetic variations in transporter genes encoding human OATP family members and their functional consequences analysed by in vitro and in vivo studies.", 
    "161": "An extensive literature base documents the substantial incremental prognostic value of nuclear cardiology compared with information provided by risk factors, clinical history, electrocardiographic stress testing results, and coronary arteriography. A smaller, well-established and growing literature addresses the unique potential of nuclear cardiology to assess therapeutic response of ischemic heart disease to lifestyle and medical therapies in individual patients. General guidelines focus on management of individual risk factors based on large studies, but may not reflect the optimum treatment strategy for an individual patient. The central rationale for noninvasive serial monitoring is to optimize the effectiveness and timing of lifestyle, medical, and revascularization therapies to minimize coronary event risk. Ideally, this monitoring of therapy should be early in the management of coronary artery disease (CAD) and guide the need for more intensive therapeutics. The application of technical advances in serial monitoring has the potential to revolutionize the way we diagnose and prevent CAD, even in asymptomatic patients. The potential long-term cost effectiveness of positron emission tomography and single-photon emission CT myocardial perfusion scintigraphy in detecting and monitoring treatment of CAD offers great promise for reducing coronary events in known or suspected ischemic heart disease.", 
    "162": "Many elderly enrolling in the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit, which began January 1, 2006, have low annual incomes and few countable assets. Although some are eligible for special assistance to pay for prescription medications, many others will still have significant out-of-pocket expenses while enrolled. The inability to pay for medications is an important cause of nonadherence in the elderly and has been associated with an increase in adverse drug events, acute hospitalizations, and nursing home admissions. This case describes a 77-year-old woman residing in a retirement community who was failing to respond to drug therapy for her hypertension and diabetes. The physician was unaware of her inability to pay for medications, and the patient was too embarrassed to discuss the issue. The case demonstrates some of the techniques that a pharmacist can use to adjust a patient's medication regimen to reduce the cost load, improve adherence, and maintain treatment goals.",

    "164": "Retrospective cohort study.", 
    "165": "Study subjects included 2589 patients with diabetes mellitus in a managed care plan in 2000-2001. We compared the quality of lipid management in men and women using the following 3 measures: (1) the traditional screening measure (measurement of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C] level), (2) the LDL-C level (ie, among those with an LDL-C level measured, an LDL-C level < 130 mg/dL [< 3.37 mmol/L]), and (3) a more detailed appropriate management measure (an LDL-C level < 130 mg/dL or an LDL-C level >or= 130 mg/dL plus statin initiation or intensification). Multivariate models were adjusted for clustering within clinic and for patient age, insulin use, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, congestive heart failure, and number of visits.", 
    "166": "In unadjusted analyses, using the traditional screening measure, women were less likely to be screened than men (P < .001). Using the LDL-C measure, women were less likely to have an LDL-C level less than 130 mg/dL (P = .047). However, using the appropriate management measure, women were as likely to receive appropriate management as men once their lipid levels were measured (P = .08).", 
    "167": "Quality measures that only examine LDL-C screening or LDL-C levels may demonstrate that women receive poorer lipid management than men among patients with diabetes mellitus. However, this gender disparity does not persist with the use of a more detailed measure.", 
    "168": "The PROactive study was a multicentre, multinational, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial that was intended to show a benefit of pioglitazone in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes. However, the result for the primary composite endpoint was not significant. The most important secondary endpoint (time to death, myocardial infarction or cerebrovascular accident) did show a significant reduction of 16%, but any potential benefit was outweighed by a major increase in the incidence ofhospitalisation for heart failure in the pioglitazone-treated group. Moreover, in this secondary prevention trial, there was marked undertreatment with statins while no effect of pioglitazone was observed in those who did receive a statin. Finally, no adjustment was made for the poorer glycaemic control in the placebo group. Based on these data, broadening the indication for pioglitazone in patients with diabetes cannot be recommended."
