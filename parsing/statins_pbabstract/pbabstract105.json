    "1": "Co-administrations of clopidogrel together with well-established CYP3A4 inhibitors, CYP3A4 inducers, and atorvastatin were investigated in a population-based pharmacoepidemiological study utilizing data from the national healthcare registers and in more detail from a university hospital register in Finland. The main outcome measures were all-cause mortality and mortality and morbidity related to thrombosis or bleeding.", 
    "2": "In the nationwide analysis, 6.1%, 1.0%, and 20.8% of the clopidogrel-treated patients were exposed to concomitant use of CYP3A4 inhibitors, CYP3A4 inducers, and atorvastatin, respectively. In the survival analysis, the adjusted hazard ratio for overall mortality was 2.29 (P\u00a0<\u00a00.001) for CYP3A4 inducer users and 0.74 (P\u00a0=\u00a00.003) for atorvastatin users compared with controls (patients receiving clopidogrel without interacting medication). CYP3A4 inhibitor use seemed to prevent from thrombosis: HR 0.67, P\u00a0<\u00a00.001. The hospitalizations due to bleedings were rarer in atorvastatin and CYP3A4 inhibitor groups compared with controls. Thrombosis complications leading to hospitalizations were more often seen in the atorvastatin group than in the control group.", 
    "3": "No uniform untoward effect of concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitor use on the clinical efficacy of clopidogrel was found. In patients receiving concomitant atorvastatin and clopidogrel, the antithrombotic effect of clopidogrel was moderately attenuated, but the combination significantly reduced the overall mortality. CYP3A4 inhibitors and atorvastatin may reduce bleedings in clopidogrel users.", 
    "4": "Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) after kidney transplantation may result in delayed graft function. We used rat renal artery clamping and transplantation models to investigate cholesterol-independent effects of clinically relevant single-dose peroral simvastatin treatment 2 h before renal ischemia on microvascular injury. The expression of HMG-CoA reductase was abundant in glomerular and peritubular microvasculature of normal kidneys. In renal artery clamping model with 30-min warm ischemia, simvastatin treatment prevented peritubular microvascular permeability and perfusion disturbances, glomerular barrier disruption, tubular dysfunction and acute kidney injury. In fully MHC-mismatched kidney allografts with 16-h cold and 1-h warm ischemia, donor simvastatin treatment increased the expression of flow-regulated transcription factor KLF2 and vasculoprotective eNOS and HO-1, and preserved glomerular and peritubular capillary barrier integrity during preservation. In vitro EC Weibel-Palade body exocytosis assays showed that simvastatin inhibited ischemia-induced release of vasoactive angiopoietin-2 and endothelin-1. After reperfusion, donor simvastatin treatment prevented microvascular permeability, danger-associated ligand hyaluronan induction, tubulointerstitial injury marker Kim-1 immunoreactivity and serum creatinine and NGAL levels, and activation of innate and adaptive immune responses. In conclusion, donor simvastatin treatment prevented renal microvascular dysfunction and IRI with beneficial effects on adaptive immune and early fibroproliferative responses. Further studies may determine potential benefits in clinical cadaveric kidney transplantation.", 
    "5": "The inter-relationship between vascular dysfunction and Alzheimer's disease pathology is not clearly understood; however, it is clear that the accumulation of amyloid-beta peptide and loss of vascular function contribute to the cognitive decline detected in patients. At present, imaging modalities can monitor the downstream effects of vascular dysfunction such as cerebral blood flow alterations, white and gray matter lacunes, and ischemic lesions; however, they cannot distinguish parenchymal plaques from cerebrovascular amyloid. Much of our understanding regarding the relationship between amyloid and vascular dysfunction has come from longitudinal population studies and mouse models. In this review, we will discuss the breadth of data generated on vascular function in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease and cerebrovascular amyloid angiopathy. We will also discuss therapeutic strategies targeting the reduction of cerebrovascular amyloid angiopathy and improvement of vascular function.", 
    "6": "The aim of this study was to investigate the association between glycemic control in Type 2 diabetes mellitus patients and common genetic variants of ADIPQO gene. A total of 427 Type 2 diabetes patients were recruited in the study and divided into two groups: 172 patients with good glycemic control and 249 with poor glycemic control. Genotyping of C11377G, G276T and T45G ADIPQO SNPs were carried out using restriction fragment length polymorphisms-polymerase chain reaction. The results showed that C11377G ADIPQO SNP is strongly associated with glycemic control in Type 2 diabetes patients. Patients with the GG genotype at adiponectin C11377G had better glycemic control than those with CC or CG genotypes. However, other examined SNPs were not correlated with glycemic control in Type 2 diabetes patients. Other parameters that impacted glycemic control include duration of the disease (p\u2009<\u20090.01), use of insulin therapy (p\u2009<\u20090.01) and presence of neuropathy complications (p\u2009<\u20090.01). However, no contribution was observed for gender, statin use, lipid profile and other oral medications to glycemic control (p\u2009>\u20090.05). Glycemic control among Type 2 diabetes patients might be affected by variants in ADIPQO gene.",

A total of 50,165 adults aged between 65 and 90\u00a0years in 1998 without records of statin therapy or diagnosis of cataracts between July 1997 and December 1997 were included in the analysis. The first record of lens extraction within the follow-up period (1998-2009) was set as the study endpoint. A propensity score was derived using a logistic regression model to model the receipt of statin therapy as a function of the baseline characteristics for every subject. We used the time-dependent Cox regression model to test the relative hazard of undergoing cataract surgery between statin users and non-users, while use of statins was treated as a time-dependent variable, controlling for baseline age and individual propensity score.",

    "12": "The European Guidelines on Dyslipidaemias (2011) and Cardiovascular Prevention (2012) have incorporated important changes. Firstly, it highlights the identification of a group of \"very high risk\" patients: patients with atherosclerotic disease in any vascular area, diabetes with associated risk factors, advanced chronic renal failure, or a SCORE estimate >10%. Patients with diabetes and no other risk factors, moderate renal failure, severe hypertension, genetic dyslipidaemias, or a SCORE estimate 5-10%, are considered as \"high risk\". The HDL cholesterol and triglycerides levels are considered as modulators of risks, but not therapeutic objectives per se. The therapeutic objectives are set at LDL cholesterol levels < 70 mg/dl (or at least a reduction of at least 50%) for patients at very high risk, and an LDL < 100 mg/dl for high risk patients. As well as the changes in lifestyle, pharmacological treatment with statins is the focal point of lipid lowering treatments. Other pharmacological options may be considered if the treatment with the maximum tolerable doses of statins do not achieve the therapeutic objectives.", 
    "13": "Many previous studies in animal models and clinical investigations have suggested that statins are useful chemotherapeutics against rheumatoid arthritis, whereas in vitro experiments using synovial cell lines showed no significant effect of statins on cell proliferation until now. Since synovial fluid in rheumatoid joint knee was found to be acidic, we examined the effect of statins on human synovial sarcoma cell line SW982 cells in acidic medium. Statins suppressed the proliferation of SW982 cells at pH6.7, while the suppression was very weak in pH7.5 medium. It was shown that the suppression was caused by the decrease in geranylgeranyl diphosphate, suggesting that a geranylgeranylated protein(s) has an essential role in cell proliferation of SW982 cells under acidic conditions. Our present data clearly implied that statins had high efficacy against SW982 cells in acidic medium whose pH is close to that of rheumatoid arthritis loci in patients. These results lead us to anticipate that screening of chemicals having high therapeutic efficacy in acidic medium promotes the development of new microenvironment-dependent medicines for chemotherapies against rheumatoid arthritis.", 
    "14": "Simvastatin has been shown to stimulate osteogenic cell differentiation. Our previous study showed osteoblasts on trabecular surface are increased by simvastatin treatment in animal study. However, whether simvastatin stimulates osteoblast proliferation and by what molecular mechanism have not been adequately investigated. Because the mitochondrial function is crucial for cell survival and proliferation, we hypothesize that simvastatin may promote human osteoblast (hOBs) proliferation and it may be related to mitochondrial function. Our results showed that simvastatin significantly enhanced proliferation and increased both mRNA and protein levels of cyclin D2, Bcl-2 and the ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax (Bcl-2/Bax). Furthermore, simvastatin increased mitochondrial activity and ATP content of hOBs. Most importantly, treatment with ATP synthase blocker, oligomycin, significantly decreased both simvastatin-stimulated ATP content and cell proliferation, and completely reversed the simvastatin-induced up-regulation of cyclin D2 and Bcl-2 expression in hOBs. On the other hand, rotenone, the complex I blocker, also partially blocked simvastatin-stimulated ATP content and cell proliferation, but the blocker did not suppress the effect of simvastatin on cyclin D2 and Bcl-2 expression. These results indicate that the up-regulation of cyclin D2 and Bcl-2/Bax by simvastatin depends on the intact function of ATP synthase in the mitochondria of hOBs. It suggests that simvastatin may promote hOB proliferation, at least partly, via up-regulating mitochondrial function and subsequently cyclin D2 and Bcl-2/Bax expression. The findings provide new information for the basic medical science in bone physiology and for new therapy strategy of simvastatin on bone formation in future.",

Changes in hemodynamic parameters were recorded after the final drug administration. Histological diagnosis was made by reviewing hematoxylin and eosin (HE) stained tissue. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to determine the expressions of type I and type III collagen, matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2), and tissue matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor-2 (TIMP-2). Further, primary rat cardiac fibroblasts were cultured and the MTT assay was performed to determine the effect of atorvastatin on cardiac fibroblast proliferation.", 
    "17": "The model of heart failure was established and the results of HE staining and Masson's trichrome staining revealed that the rats in the heart failure group showed obvious hyperplasia of fibrotic tissue, which was significantly reduced in the atorvastatin group. Real-time quantitative PCR showed that the MI group showed a significantly increased expression of type I and type III collagen, MMP-2, and TIMP-2, but a significantly reduced MMP-2/TIMP-2 ratio. Compared with the MI group, the atorvastatin group showed significantly reduced expression of type I and III collagen, unchanged expression of MMP-2, significantly reduced expression of TIMP-2, and an increased MMP-2/TIMP-2 ratio. We further found that atorvastatin significantly inhibited the Ang II-induced fibroblast proliferation and the expression of type I and type III collagen in cardiac fibroblasts while increasing the MMP-2/TIMP-2 ratio.",

New agents, under research, such as antibodies neutralizing PCSK9, will have a special place for the management of patients with intolerance to statins of severe dyslipemias. Drugs used to modify the concentration of high density lipoproteins-cholesterol and triglycerides have not been accompanied by the expected reductions in the rate of cardiovascular complications.", 
    "20": "Statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, are widely prescribed as cholesterol-lowering drugs. Statins have recently been found to have pleiotropic effects that are independent of their lipid-lowering properties. Phosphorylation of serine, threonine, and tyrosine residues of functional proteins are considered to be important in the endothelial signaling cascade. In this study, protein phosphorylation status in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (ECs) after rosuvastatin treatment was examined. The proteins were collected from rosuvastatin-treated ECs and then the phosphorylated peptides purified by a Fe(3+)-immobilized metal-affinity chromatography bead system were examined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Alterations of the phosphorylation status of proteins were noticed after rosuvastatin treatment. There were 277 and 530 phosphorylated proteins identified from the control and rosuvastatin-treated ECs, respectively. Among those proteins, T78, in addition to S156 of the Ras-GTPase-activating protein, was phosphorylated after rosuvastatin treatment. Rosuvastatin reduced the phosphorylation of Y455 in HSP90 protein. Decreased phosphorylation of T211 with a concurrent increase in the T291 phosphorylation of Akt1 was observed under rosuvastatin treatment. Increased S633 phosphorylation was detected in endothelial nitric oxide synthase. Western blot analysis further showed an earlier and greater S633 phosphorylation than that of S1177 in endothelial nitric oxide synthase after rosuvastatin treatment. Changes in the phosphorylation status of these proteins may alter the protein's function and affect endothelial physiology. The current study provides new insights leading to a better understanding of the pleiotropic effects of statins on the vascular system.",

Following liquid-liquid extraction, the analytes and an internal standard, atorvastatin (ATO), were separated using an isocratic mobile phase comprising 0.1% (v/v) formic acid-methanol (20 + 80, v/v) on an RP-C18 column. Detection was performed on a mass spectrometer by selected ion monitoring using their respective [M-H]- ions, m/z 480 for ROS, m/z 408 for EZE, and m/z 557 for ATO. For both analytes, the method was linear in the range of 0.1 to 10 nglmL. Acceptable precision and accuracy were obtained for concentrations over the standard curve range. A run time of 4 min made it possible to determine many plasma samples/day. The validated LC/ESI-MS method can be used to study pharmacokinetics, bioavailability, and bioequivalence of combined dosage forms of ROS and EZE.", 
    "25": "Sudden cardiac death (SCD) is still a major public health issue with an estimated annual incidence ranging from 184,000 to > 400,000 per year. The ACC/AHA/ESC 2006 guidelines define SCD as \"death from an unexpected circulatory arrest, usually due to a cardiac arrhythmia occurring within an hour of the onset of symptoms\". A recent study of sudden cardiac death using multiple sources of ascertainment found that coronary artery disease was present in more than 50% of patients older than 35 years who died suddenly and underwent autopsy. Antiarrhythmic drugs have failed to show any mortality benefit even when compared to placebo or implantable cardiovertor defibrillators (ICDs). While patients with systolic heart failure are at higher risk of dying suddenly, most of the patients experiencing sudden cardiac death have left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) > 50%. \u03b2-blockers, Angiotensin enzymes (ACE) inhibitors as well as aldosterone antagonists prevent ischemia and remodelling in the left ventricle especially in post myocardial infarction (MI) patients and in patients with systolic heart failure. This article will review the data on the effects of traditional heart failure medications, especially \u03b2-blockers, Renin Angiotensin system blockers, as well as Statin therapy on sudden cardiac death in post MI patients and in patients with systolic heart failure.",

In univariate analysis, CAVI, mean arterial pressure (MAP)-asleep, overall diastolic BP, overall systolic BP, duration of hypertension, and statin use were significantly higher among patients with a nondipper pattern than that in dippers. Multivariate linear regression analyses showed that the difference between MAP-asleep and MAP-awake was associated independently with CAVI (\u03b2 coefficient=0.514, P<0.001).

The objective of this study was to compare the risk of CTD diagnoses in statin users and nonusers. This study was a propensity score-matched analysis of adult patients (30 to 85 years old) in the San Antonio military medical community. The study was divided into baseline (October 1, 2003 to September 30, 2005), and follow-up (October 1, 2005 to March 5, 2010) periods. Statin users received a statin prescription during fiscal year 2005. Nonusers did not receive a statin at any time during the study. The outcome measure was the occurrence of 3 diagnosis codes of the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification consistent with CTD. We described co-morbidities during the baseline period using the Charlson Comorbidity Index. We created a propensity score based on 41 variables. We then matched statin users and nonusers 1:1, using a caliper of 0.001. Of 46,488 patients who met study criteria (13,640 statin users and 32,848 nonusers), we matched 6,956 pairs of statin users and nonusers. Matched groups were similar in terms of patient age, gender, incidence of co-morbidities, total Charlson Comorbidity Index, health care use, and medication use. The odds ratio for CTD was lower in statin users than nonusers (odds ratio: 0.80; 95% confidence interval: 0.64 to 0.99; p = 0.05). Secondary analysis and sensitivity analysis confirmed these results. In conclusion, statin use was associated with a lower risk of CTD.",

Following RhoC knockdown, there was reduced mRNA or protein expression of protein kinase B (Akt), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (stat3), bcl-xL, surviving and phosphorylated p70S6 kinase (p-p70s6k), while the converse was true for Bax and caspase-3. Lovastatin induced apoptosis, suppressed proliferation, migration and invasion, and disrupted lamellipodia formation in OVCAR3. Lovastatin exposure induced lower RhoC, bcl-2, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), survivin, Akt, bcl-xL, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and p-p70s6k expression in OVCAR3 compared to the control, but higher caspase-3 and Bax expression. RhoC mRNA and protein expression was significantly higher in ovarian carcinoma than in benign tumors and normal ovary tissue (p<0.05) and was positively associated with dedifferentiation, FIGO staging and p-p70s6k expression of ovarian carcinoma (p<0.05).",

    "36": "The effects of simvastatin on the blood oxygen transport function and indices of prooxidant - antioxidant balance at incubation have been studied. Simvastatin at a concentration of 100 ng/ml increases p50 (the blood pO2 corresponding to its 50% oxygen saturation) at real values of pH and pCO2 from 39.53 + 2.41 (p <0.05) to 36.60 (36, 40, 37, 60) (p <0.05) mm Hg. An increase in the drug concentration led to a decrease in the level of this parameter, but in a dose-independent manner. In addition, the level of nitrates/nitrites in the blood plasma was also increased, which was evidence of increasing activity of the L-arginine-NO system. The indices of prooxidant - antioxidant balance exhibited no significant changes. The results demonstrate a new pleiotropic effect of simvastatin, which is realized via a change in the hemoglobin - oxygen affinity through modification of NO production. This effect must be taken into account in the treatment of pathology in the blood circulation.", 
    "37": "The risk of death due to heart disease and stroke is up to four times higher in individuals with diabetes compared to individuals without diabetes. Most guidelines that address treatment of dyslipidemia in patients with diabetes consider diabetes a cardiovascular disease (CVD) \"risk equivalent\" and recommend intensive treatment of dyslipidemia for the purpose of CVD prevention. Statins (3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase [HMG-CoA reductase] inhibitors) are first-line agents in achieving lipid goals as an adjunct to diet and exercise and should be used in most patients. In addition to lipid management and blood pressure control, glycemic control is a basic component in the management of diabetes. Glycemic control is achieved by combining diabetes self-management education, diet and exercise, and, where required, antihyperglycemic agents (OHAs). Persistence and adherence to therapy are critical in achieving recommended treatment goals. However, overall compliance with concomitantly prescribed OHAs and statins is low in patients with type 2 diabetes. Fixed-dose combination (FDC) therapies have been shown to improve adherence by reducing pill burden, the complexity of treatment regimen, and, potentially, cost. Based on the available evidence regarding the pharmacokinetics and the efficacy and safety profiles of each component drug, the sitagliptin/simvastatin FDC may provide a rational and well-tolerated approach to achieving better adherence to multiple-drug therapy and improved lipid lowering and glycemic control, with consequent reduction in cardiovascular risk, diabetic microvascular disease, and mortality in diabetic patients for whom treatment with both compounds is appropriate.", 
    "38": "Statins are potent drugs, used as lipid-lowering agents in cardiovascular diseases. Hepatotoxicity is one of the serious adverse effects of statins, and the exact mechanism of hepatotoxicity is not yet clear. In this study, the cytotoxic effects of the most commonly used statins, that is, atorvastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin toward isolated rat hepatocytes, were evaluated. Markers, such as cell death, reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation, lipid peroxidation, mitochondrial membrane potential, and the amount of reduced and oxidized glutathione in the statin-treated hepatocytes, were investigated. It was found that the statins caused cytotoxicity toward rat hepatocytes dose dependently. An elevation in ROS formation, accompanied by a significant amount of lipid peroxidation and mitochondrial depolarization, was observed. Cellular glutathione reservoirs were decreased, and a significant amount of oxidized glutathione was formed. This study suggests that the adverse effect of statins toward hepatocytes is mediated through oxidative stress and the hepatocytes mitochondria play an important role in the statin-induced toxicity.",

Here, we utilized electrochemistry/mass spectrometry for the detection and subsequent generation of six phase I metabolites of simvastatin and lovastatin. Both simvastatin and lovastatin are widely used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. There are known drug-drug interaction issues of statin therapy, and it has been suggested that the oxidative metabolites may contribute to the cholesterol-lowering effect of both statins. Of the known phase I metabolites of simvastatin and lovastatin, none are commercially available, and chemical means for the synthesis of a very few of them have been previously reported. Here, we report that electrochemical oxidation of less than 1\u00a0mg each of simvastatin and lovastatin led to the generation of three oxidative metabolites of each parent to allow complete nuclear magnetic resonance characterization of all six metabolites. The yields obtained by the electrochemical approach were also compared with incubation of parent drug with commercially available bacterial mutant CYP102A1 enzymes, and it was found that the electrochemical approach gave higher yields than the enzymatic oxidations for the generation of most of the observed oxidative metabolites in this study.",

Of these patients, 169 patients were treated with statins. Successful EVT was defined as direct-line flow to the pedal arch with <30 % residual stenosis. The multicenter data were analyzed retrospectively for outcomes of overall survival, amputation-free survival (AFS), cardiovascular death, limb salvage, freedom from repeat revascularization, and major adverse limb events [MALE: repeat revascularization for the limb or major amputation (defined as above-the-ankle amputation)]. The mean follow-up period was 19.4 \u00b1 17.6 months. Overall survival, AFS and freedom from repeat revascularization at 4 years were significantly higher in patients treated with statins (64.5 vs. 45.9 %, P = 0.004; 64.1 vs. 43.0 %, P = 0.003; and 56.4 vs. 45.4 %, P = 0.03, respectively).

The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) have well-established anti-inflammatory properties. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of statins on the adverse functional and morphological changes in blood vessels induced by PM10. New Zealand White rabbits fed with a high fat diet were subjected to balloon injury to their abdominal aorta followed by PM10/saline exposure for 4weeks\u00b1lovastatin (5mg/kg/day) treatment. PM10 exposure accelerated balloon catheter induced plaque formation and increased intimal macrophages and lipid accumulation while lovastatin attenuated these changes and promoted smooth muscle cell recruitment into plaques. PM10 impaired vascular acetylcholine (Ach) responses and increased vasoconstriction induced by phenylephrine as assessed by wire myograph. Supplementation of nitric oxide improved the impaired Ach responses. PM10 increased the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) in blood vessels and increased the plasma levels of endothelin-1 (ET-1). Incubation with specific inhibitors for iNOS, COX-2 or ET-1 in the myograph chambers significantly improved the impaired vascular function. Lovastatin decreased the expression of these mediators in atherosclerotic lesions and improved endothelial dysfunction. However, lovastatin was unable to reduce blood lipid levels to the baseline level in rabbits exposed to PM10. Taken together, statins protect against PM10-induced cardiovascular disease by reducing atherosclerosis and improving endothelial function via their anti-inflammatory properties.",

    "70": "Motivated by a study about prompt coronary angiography in myocardial infarction, we propose a method to estimate the causal effect of a treatment in two-arm experimental studies with possible noncompliance in both treatment and control arms. We base the method on a causal model for repeated binary outcomes (before and after the treatment), which includes individual covariates and latent variables for the unobserved heterogeneity between subjects. Moreover, given the type of noncompliance, the model assumes the existence of three subpopulations of subjects: compliers, never-takers, and always-takers. We estimate the model using a two-step estimator: at the first step, we estimate the probability that a subject belongs to one of the three subpopulations on the basis of the available covariates; at the second step, we estimate the causal effects through a conditional logistic method, the implementation of which depends on the results from the first step. The estimator is approximately consistent and, under certain circumstances, exactly consistent. We provide evidence that the bias is negligible in relevant situations. We compute standard errors on the basis of a sandwich formula. The application shows that prompt coronary angiography in patients with myocardial infarction may significantly decrease the risk of other events within the next 2\u2009years, with a log-odds of about \u2009-\u20092. Given that noncompliance is significant for patients being given the treatment because of high-risk conditions, classical estimators fail to detect, or at least underestimate, this effect.", 
    "71": "Psoriasis represents a common skin disease which is clinically manifested by chronic cutaneous lesions. It has been observed that psoriasis is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, which is contributed to the inappropriate lipid metabolism. Statins are commonly used in clinical practice to lower cholesterol concentration and, accordingly, decrease the individual risk of developing a cardiovascular episode. There have been reports that statin administration could also result in better management of psoriasis. The observed beneficial effects are contributed to the effects on lipid metabolism, including that in skin, as well as anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of statins. Simvastatin and atorvastatin were found to improve the clinical outcome in patients with psoriatic skin lesions. Clinically, the effectiveness of this novel treatment was confirmed by the significant reduction in PASI score. To date several cases have been reported in which atorvastatin or pravastatin worsened psoriasis. Based on these results, it seems that statins represent a promising class of medications which could be extensively used in psoriasis.", 
    "72": "Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the number one cause of death globally, and lipid modification, particularly lowering of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc), is one of the cornerstones of prevention and treatment. However, even after lowering of LDLc to conventional goals, a sizeable number of patients continue to suffer cardiovascular events. More aggressive lowering of LDLc and optimization of other lipid parameters like triglycerides (TG) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc) have been proposed as two potential strategies to address this residual risk. These strategies entail use of maximal doses of highly potent HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and combination therapy with other lipid modifying agents. Though statins in general are fairly well tolerated, adverse events like myopathy are dose related. There are further risks with combination therapy. In this article, we review the adverse effects of lipid modifying agents used alone and in combination and weigh these effects against the evidence demonstrating their efficacy in reducing cardiovascular events, cardiovascular mortality, and all cause mortality. For patients with established CVD, statins are the only group of drugs that have shown consistent reductions in hard outcomes. Though more aggressive lipid lowering with high dose potent statins can reduce rates of non fatal events and need for interventions, the incremental mortality benefits remain unclear, and their use is associated with a higher rate of drug related adverse effects. Myopathy and renal events have been a significant concern with the use of high potency statin drugs, in particular simvastatin and rosuvastatin. For patients who have not reached target LDL levels or have residual lipid abnormalities on maximal doses of statins, the addition of other agents has not been shown to improve clinical outcomes and carries an increased risk of adverse events. The clinical benefits of drugs to raise HDLc remain unproven. In patients without known cardiovascular disease, there is conflicting evidence as to the benefits of aggressive pursuit of numerical lipid targets, particularly with respect to all cause mortality. Certainly, in statin intolerant patients, alternative agents with a low side effect profile are desirable. Bile acid sequestrants are an effective and safe choice for decreasing LDLc, and omega-3 fatty acids are safe agents to decrease TG. There remains an obvious need to design and carry out large scale studies to help determine which agents, when combined with statins, have the greatest benefit on cardiovascular disease with the least added risk. These studies should be designed to assess the impact on clinical outcomes rather than surrogate endpoints, and require a comprehensive assessment and reporting of safety outcomes.", 
    "73": "Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that the Mediterranean diet, which is rich in resveratrol, is associated with a significantly reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the beneficial effects of resveratrol on cardiovascular function remain incompletely understood. Therefore, we set out to identify the molecular target(s) mediating the protective action of resveratrol on vascular function. To this end, we performed vascular reactivity studies to evaluate the effects of resveratrol on superior thyroid artery obtained from 59 patients with hypertension and dyslipidemia. We found that resveratrol evoked vasorelaxation and reduced endothelial dysfunction through the modulation of NO metabolism via (1) an 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase-mediated increase in endothelial NO synthase activity; (2) a rise in tetrahydrobiopterin levels, which also increases endothelial NO synthase activity; and (3) attenuation of vascular oxidative stress, brought about by overexpression of manganese superoxide dismutase via an nuclear factor erythroid-derived 2-like 2-dependent mechanism. The effects of resveratrol on acetylcholine vasorelaxation were also tested in vessels from patients with nonhypertensive nondyslipidemia undergoing thyroid surgery. In this setting, resveratrol failed to exert any effect. Thus, our finding that resveratrol reduces endothelial dysfunction, an early pathophysiological feature and independent predictor of poor prognosis in most forms of cardiovascular disease, supports the concept that the risk of vascular events could be further reduced by adherence to a set of dietary and behavioral guidelines.",

Interindividual gene expression differences among these enzymes may explain part of the variability in tolerance and effect for statin treatment. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of statin treatment on these genes in human liver tissue. Levels of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, SLCO1B1, SLCO2B1, ABCB1, and ABCG2 mRNA in liver tissue from a previously performed clinical trial in 29 patients randomized to treatment with placebo, 80 mg/day of atorvastatin, or 20 mg/day of fluvastatin for 4 weeks were measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Treatment with atorvastatin (n = 10), but not with fluvastatin (n = 10), resulted in 3-fold higher expression of SLCO2B1 compared with placebo-treated patients (n = 9) (P < 0.05). Atorvastatin increased the expression of both ABCB1 and ABCG2 by more than 2-fold (P < 0.05).

Here we show for the first time that atorvastatin treatment leads to increased expression of the membrane transporters SLCO2B1, ABCB1, and ABCG2 in human liver tissue, which potentially may counteract the efficacy of the treatment, and our findings may cast light on the mechanisms of clinical problems with adverse reactions and drug interactions in statin treatment.",

Of 985 identified citations, 7 (4 observational studies and 3 randomised controlled trials (RCTs)) met the inclusion criteria. Two studies (both observational) were concerned with trauma patients in general, two with patients who had suffered traumatic brain injury (one observational, one RCT), two with burns patients (one observational, one RCT), and one with fracture healing (RCT). Two of the RCTs relied on surrogate outcome measures. The observational studies were deemed to be at high risk of confounding, and the RCTs at high risk of bias. Three of the observational studies suggested improvements in a number of clinical outcomes in patients taking statins prior to injury (mortality, infection, and septic shock in burns patients; mortality in trauma patients in general; mortality in brain injured patients) whereas one, also of trauma patients in general, showed no difference in mortality or infection, and an increased risk of multi-organ failure. Two of three RCTs on statin treatment in burns patients and brain injured patients showed improvements in E-selectin levels and cognitive function. The third, of patients with radial fractures, showed no acceleration in fracture union. In conclusion, there is some evidence that pre-injury statin use and post-injury statin treatment may have a beneficial effect in patients who have suffered general trauma, traumatic brain injury, and burns. However, these studies are at high risk of confounding and bias, and should be regarded as 'hypothesisgenerating'.

The sFlt-1 group received either Pra (sFlt-1 + Pra) or water (sFlt-1). Mice were sacrificed at day 18, and serum levels of sFlt-1 and soluble endoglin (sEng) were measured. Placental expression of placental (PLGF) and vascular endothelial (VEGF) growth factors and other markers of angiogenesis and hypoxia were assayed. We observed that Pra treatment in sFlt-1 mice reduced sFlt-1 and sEng concentrations at day 18 to levels similar to control group. Placental PLGF and VEGF expression were upregulated, and markers of hypoxia downregulated to levels similar to control group.

The cross-sectional study was conducted in 230 subjects (age range: 30-86 y) stratified according to statins treatment.

Subjects on statin treatment showed higher telomerase activity (P<0.0001) and longer LTL (P=0.028) levels compared to the nonstatin group. Statin therapy was associated with higher telomerase activity independently of multiple covariates, including age, gender, smoking habits, lipid, systemic inflammation, glucose, and blood pressure levels (P=0.019). Indeed, subjects on statin treatment showed significant lower telomere erosion along with aging. Every 1 y increment in age, LTL decreases by 0.058 Kb in no statin and 0.033 Kb in statin groups, respectively, as well as the major difference in telomere attrition between groups was found after the age of 65 yr (P<0.0001).

Levels of cMPs carrying parental cell markers from vascular and circulating cell origin (platelet, endothelial cell, pan-leukocyte and specific-leukocyte subsets) were significantly lower in blood of LLT+ compared to LLT--patients. Moreover, MPs from LLT+-patients had reduced markers of activated platelets (\u03b1IIb\u03b23-integrin), activated inflammatory cells (\u03b1M-integrin) and tissue factor. The effect of LLT on cMP shedding was found to be accumulative in years. cMP shedding associated to cardiovascular risk in LLT+-patients.

Hepatic lipoperoxidation was reduced in sedentary+simvastatin (\u224821%) and trained+simvastatin groups (\u224857%) compared to the sedentary group. Correlation analysis involving all animals demonstrated that cardiac lipoperoxidation was negatively related to the vagal effect (r = -0.7) and positively correlated to the sympathetic effect (r = 0.7).

    "152": "Among stable patients with CAD and with an LDL-C >70 mg/dL on simvastatin 20 mg, increasing simvastatin dose to 80 mg or adding ezetimibe 10 mg promoted similar further cholesterol reduction but did not have incremental effects on circulating EPCs. These data suggest that the effects of simvastatin moderate doses on EPCs are not increased by intensive lipid-lowering strategies (clinicaltrials.gov: NCT00474123).", 
    "153": "Although statins increase the plasma concentration of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), it has not been elucidated whether the increased HDL particles possess normal antiatherosclerotic properties. Pitavastatin functions to increase the plasma HDL-C level and decrease the lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level. In the present study, we sought to examine the qualitative changes in HDL during pitavastatin treatment.", 
    "154": "A total of 30 patients with dyslipidemia were treated with 2 mg of pitavastatin for four weeks. The cholesterol efflux capacity and activities of the antioxidative enzymes paraoxonase-1 (PON-1) and platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) were evaluated using polyethethylene glycol-treated HDL fractions before and after pitavastatin treatment.", 
    "155": "Pitavastatin treatment decreased the serum LDL-C level by 39% and increased the serum HDL-C level by 9% (p\uff1c0.05). In addition, pitavastatin increased the phospholipid content of HDL by 7.8% (p\uff1c0.05). The pitavastatin-induced increase in the HDL-C level coincided with an increase in the cholesterol efflux capacity of the isolated HDL fraction of 8.6% (p\uff1c0.05). The post-pitavastatin treatment activity of HDL-associated PON-1 (paraoxonase and arylesterase) was increased by 9% (p\uff1c0.05) and 11% (p\uff1c0.05), respectively, while the HDL-associated PAF-AH activity was not affected by pitavastatin.", 
    "156": "In addition to its LDL-C-lowering effects, pitavastatin elevates the HDL-C level and enhances the cholesterol efflux capacity and antioxidative properties of HDL. Pitavastatin therefore increases the amount of functional HDL without attenuating HDL quality.", 
    "157": "Hybrid P450 systems in which P450 monooxygenases are reconstituted with non-native or surrogate redox partners have become important for the engineering of this class of versatile enzymes. P450sca-2 from Streptomyces carbophilus stereoselectively hydroxylates mevastatin to yield pravastatin, a cholesterol-lowering drug. While S. carbophilus has been successfully applied in the industrial biotransformation process for pravastatin, the molecular study and engineering of P450sca-2 has been very limited. We have previously established a functional P450sca-2/Pdx/Pdr hybrid system. In this study, on the basis of a more active P450sca-2 mutant (R8-5C), five sites located in the substrate binding pocket, substrate access entrance, and presumed Pdx interaction interface were rationally chosen, and systematically subjected to site-directed saturation mutagenesis (SDSM), and three rounds of iterative saturation mutagenesis (ISM). A best mutant (Variant III) was obtained, which showed a whole cell biotransformation activity (377.5\u2009mg/L) and an overall apparent k(cat) (6.37\u2009min\u207b\u00b9) that was 7.1- and 10.0-fold that of the starting template R8-5C, respectively. Kinetic characterization revealed that most of the improvements seen for the SDSM and ISM mutants came from enhanced overall electron transfer, with the two sites at the interface between P450sca-2 and Pdx (T119 and N363) being most critical. Our study underscores the important role of electron transfer in a hybrid P450 system, and also demonstrates the utility of ISM in optimizing the redox partner interface. This should facilitate engineering of this and other important hybrid P450 systems.", 
    "158": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and premature mortality in Europe and the United States, and is increasingly common in developing countries. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is an independent risk factor for CVD and is superior to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) as a predictor of cardiovascular events. The residual risk conferred by low HDL-C in patients with a satisfactory LDL-C was recently highlighted by the European Atherosclerosis Society. Despite the lack of randomized controlled trials, it has been suggested that raising the level of HDL-C should be considered as a therapeutic strategy in high-risk patients because of the strong epidemiological evidence, compelling biological plausibility, and both experimental and clinical research supporting its cardioprotective effects.",

Statins currently form the standard of care but are not able to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) adequately in all patients - particularly those with familial hypercholesterolaemia and those with statin intolerance.", 
    "162": "Combination therapy with statins is well established and ezetimibe is often used as an additional LDL-C-lowering agent reducing LDL-C by 20%. However, its clinical efficacy still remains controversial. Newer, more potent methods of LDL-C reduction are in development. Both lomitapide, a microsomal transfer protein inhibitor (MTPI), and mipomersen, an antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), have been shown to improve LDL-C levels by 25-50% in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia. In patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia or statin intolerance antibody-based inhibitors of preprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) produce reductions in LDL-C of 30-65%. Cholesterol ester transfer protein inhibitors (CETPIs) reduce LDL-C by 30-40% as well as raising levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and may also have a role as additional LDL-C-reducing drugs.",

Two studies have evaluated the clinical outcomes following HDL-C raising with niacin. Data from the Heart Protection 2 Treatment of HDL to Reduce the Incidence of Vascular Events and The Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome with Low HDL/High Triglycerides: Impact on Global Health trials both demonstrated no clinical benefit from use of niacin therapy when added to background statin therapy with regard to short-term and long-term cardiovascular risk reduction. Both studies demonstrated excess side-effects from use of niacin. A number of clinical trials have evaluated HDL-C modification from use of a CETP inhibitor. All of the studies have demonstrated significant increases in HDL-C. To date, the outcome data are not favorable. Use of torcetrapib was associated with excess mortality. Use of dalcetrapib had no effect on short-term and long-term cardiovascular events. Two outcome studies with anacetrapib and evacetrapib are ongoing and will report out in a few years' time.", 
    "166": "Pharmacological manipulation of HDL-C has not improved the cardiovascular outcomes. Several agents have caused harm or unacceptable side-effects. Further studies are needed before one can recommend the use of additional lipid-modifying therapies beyond statins.", 
    "167": "Vasomotor responses conducted from terminal arterioles to proximal vessels may contribute to match tissue demands and blood supply during skeletal muscle contraction. Conduction of vasodilatation (CVD) from distal resistance arterioles to the proximal arterioles and feeding arteries during metabolic demand is mediated by intercellular gap junctions in the vascular endothelium. The role of hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) in the musculoskeletal system during CVD is unclear. We hypothesize that during HHcy, there is impaired CVD due to decreased expression of endothelial-associated connexins and thus decreased tissue perfusion to the contracting skeletal muscles.",

Expression of connexins and myostatin protein (an antiskeletal muscle statin) was studied by Western blot and immunohistochemistry methods. Tissue perfusion to acetylcholine was assessed by the laser Doppler technique.", 
    "169": "There was decreased CVD and tissue perfusion in response to acetylcholine in CBS-/+ mice compared to wild-type controls. There was decreased expression of connexins 37, 40 and 43 and increased expression of myostatin in CBS-/+ mice compared to wild-type controls.", 
    "170": "Our findings suggest that CVD in skeletal muscle is decreased during HHcy due to decreased expression of gap junction connexins.", 
    "171": "Statins are widely used in the evidence-based lowering of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. The use of these drugs for secondary prevention of CVD is well founded, but their expanding use in primary prevention--in individuals without documented CVD--has raised some concerns. Firstly, evidence suggests that, in primary prevention, statins substantially decrease CVD morbidity, but only moderately reduce CVD mortality. Secondly, long-term statin use might cause adverse effects, such as incident diabetes mellitus. Thirdly, the cost-effectiveness of such a strategy is unclear, and has to be balanced against the risk of 'overmedicating' the general population. Data clearly support the use of statins for primary prevention in high-risk individuals, in whom the strategy is cost-effective and the benefits exceed the risks. Whether primary prevention is beneficial in individuals at low or moderate risk is not certain. Therefore, the prescription of statins for primary prevention should be individualized on the basis of clinical judgment, particularly for low-risk individuals. In appropriately selected individuals, statins should also be used for primary prevention of ischaemic stroke and transient ischaemic attack.",

Patients with cerebrovascular disease only were least frequently observed to have low HDL-C (24%) and elevated triglycerides (36%). Overall, elevated LDL-C was the most frequent lipid anomaly observed, and preexisting heart failure was strongly and positively associated with dyslipidemia.",

Prescribing to patients with low risk (<15%) also increased (from 1.9% to 5.0%). Only about half the patients initiating statin treatment were high risk according to CVD risk score. The 5-year CVD risks, as observed during statin treatment, reduced over calendar time (from 17.0% to 7.1%). There was a large variation between general practices in the percentage of high-risk patients prescribed a statin in 2007 onwards, ranging from 8.2% to 61.5%.

The concept of \"mosaic of autoimmunity\" deals with the multi-factorial origin and diversity of expression of ADs in humans. Genetic leads to a predisposition in developing an autoimmune syndrome, but the presence of an external or endogenous environmental factor, recently called \"exposome,\" is essential in triggering the immune response. Infections as well as the expositions to different other external environmental agents have been identified as potential trigger for ADs. A new syndrome, namely the autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants, has recently been defined alluding to the key role of adjuvant in inducing an immune-mediated condition. Aluminum and silicone, respectively found in vaccines and breast implants, are the most commonly known adjuvants charged with development of autoimmune conditions. Similarly to playing chess, unraveling the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases with every new discovery is adding a move to the game aiming at checkmating ADs.",

In particular, the lipophilic forms (i.e. lovastatin, simvastatin, or similar) would have a therapeutic but not a preventive role. The pleiotropic effects that statins possess mainly explain this phenomenon, influencing the natural history of disease and the response to currently available therapies. By inhibiting the mevalonate pathway, statins would have a systemic effect, similar to that observed in atherosclerosis, reducing the inflammatory stimuli present in the tumor micro-environment and inhibiting the activation of intracellular signaling cascades critical for proliferation, migration/invasion and metastasis of the cancer cell. Despite all this evidence, randomized trials are needed to confirm the benefit of statins on cancer, before promoting their widespread use as a therapeutic or preventive strategy for this condition.",

HF patients with preserved LVEF (HFpEF) were older and more often female than patients with reduced LVEF (HFrEF). Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank test results showed that HFpEF patients had a better prognosis than HFrEF patients. However, there were no significant differences in clinical outcomes between HFpEF and HFrEF patients when the analysis was limited to inpatients. Cox regression analysis showed that HFpEF patients had a significantly lower risk of all-cause death (p=0.027; hazard ratio, 0.547, 95% confidence interval, 0.321-0.933). Multivariate analyses performed separately showed that the independent predictors of all-cause death in HFrEF were advanced age, lower body mass index, diabetes mellitus, and the absence of statin treatment, whereas those for HFpEF were advanced age, absence of dyslipidemia, anemia, and left ventricular hypertrophy.",
