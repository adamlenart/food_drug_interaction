We screened 195 hypercholesterolemic, statin-treated patients, all of whom received either atorvastatin, simvastatin, or pravastatin. Patients were classified as having no myalgia, probable myalgia, or definite myalgia, and assigned a myalgia score of 0, 0.5, or 1, respectively. Fourteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected from candidates within the 5-HT receptor gene families [5a-hydroxytryptamine receptor genes (HTR) 1D, 2A, 2C, 3A, 3B, 5A, 6, 7] and the serotonin transporter gene (SLC6A4). SNPs in the HTR3B and HTR7 genes, rs2276307 and rs1935349, respectively, were significantly associated with the myalgia score. Individual differences in pain perception and nociception related to specific serotonergic gene variants may affect the development of myalgia in statin-treated patients.", 
    "1": "HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) are well-established therapies in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease, reducing all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events in many disease states. Studies have also suggested that statins given to patients after myocardial infarction improve event-free survival even in short time frames; however, evidence for the benefit of statins in established HF (heart failure) has not been demonstrated with the same rigour of a randomized clinical trial setting. In fact, clinical data examining the effect of statins in HF have been limited by the retrospective or observational nature of these analyses, examination of incompletely validated surrogate end points, small prospective studies in subgroups of HF subjects, and non-uniform doses and different statins being used. In this review, we examine the evidence for the effect of statins on mortality in HF, taking into account theoretical arguments, appropriateness of surrogate markers, animal data and analysis of the predominantly retrospective clinical data that is currently available.", 
    "2": "A case of spontaneous biceps tendon rupture in a physician during therapy with the combination of simvastatin and ezetimibe (Vytorin) is reported. Rechallenge produced tendinopathy in the contralateral biceps tendon that abated with drug discontinuation. Tendon rupture generally occurs in injured tendons. Physiological repair of an injured tendon requires degradation and remodeling of the extracellular matrix through matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Statins are known to inhibit MMPs. It was hypothesized that statins may increase the risk of tendon rupture by altering MMP activity. In conclusion, statins may increase the risk of tendon rupture by altering MMP activity.", 
    "3": "Several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) have been implicated in the development and outcome of coronary artery disease (CAD). We investigated whether MMP-12 and TIMP-1 levels were associated with risk, severity, and outcome of CAD. Plasma MMP-12 and TIMP-1 levels are measured in 50 and 44 patients with CAD, respectively, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Of all patients, 16 were taking statins. Patients who were not on statins were classified into 3 groups according to number of >50% stenotic vessels. Compared with 29 volunteers without CAD, patients without statins (n = 34) had higher MMP-12 concentrations (1.71 vs 1.08 ng/ml, p = 0.021). MMP-12 levels were significantly lower in patients with than in those without statin treatment (0.99 vs 1.71 ng/ml, p = 0.008). There was no association between MMP-12 levels and number of >50% stenotic vessels. MMP-12 concentrations were not associated with outcome of CAD. However, plasma TIMP-1 levels were associated with restenosis independently of number of stenotic vessels and age (p = 0.035) but not with risk or severity of CAD. In conclusion, plasma MMP-12 concentration was associated with the presence of CAD. Statin therapy decreases plasma MMP-12 levels in patients with CAD. Increased TIMP-1 levels may prevent restenosis after angioplasty.", 
    "4": "High-dose statin treatment has been recommended as a primary strategy for aggressive reduction of LDL cholesterol levels and protection against coronary artery disease. The effectiveness of high-dose statins may be limited by their potential for myotoxic side effects. There is currently little known about the molecular mechanisms of statin-induced myotoxicity. Previously we showed that T-91485, an active metabolite of the squalene synthase inhibitor lapaquistat acetate (lapaquistat: a previous name is TAK-475), attenuated statin-induced cytotoxicity in human skeletal muscle cells [Nishimoto, T., Tozawa, R., Amano, Y., Wada, T., Imura, Y., Sugiyama, Y., 2003a. Comparing myotoxic effects of squalene synthase inhibitor, T-91485, and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 66, 2133-2139]. In the current study, we investigated the effects of lapaquistat administration on statin-induced myotoxicity in vivo. Guinea pigs were treated with either high-dose cerivastatin (1 mg/kg) or cerivastatin together with lapaquistat (30 mg/kg) for 14 days. Treatment with cerivastatin alone decreased plasma cholesterol levels by 45% and increased creatine kinase (CK) levels by more than 10-fold (a marker of myotoxicity). The plasma CK levels positively correlated with the severity of skeletal muscle lesions as assessed by histopathology. Co-administration of lapaquistat almost completely prevented the cerivastatin-induced myotoxicity. Administration of mevalonolactone (100 mg/kg b.i.d.) prevented the cerivastatin-induced myotoxicity, confirming that this effect is directly related to HMG-CoA reductase inhibition. These results strongly suggest that cerivastatin-induced myotoxicity is due to depletion of mevalonate derived isoprenoids. In addition, squalene synthase inhibition could potentially be used clinically to prevent statin-induced myopathy.",

A control group (group II) consisted of 32 patients with previous myocardial infarction also treated invasively (24 CABG and 8 PTCA), but not subjected to rehabilitation. The two analyzed groups did not differ significantly from each other as to age, applied drug regimen, current clinical status, echocardiographic parameters and BMI values. Group I was subjected to 6-month cardiac rehabilitation program, comprising 45-minute training on cycle ergometer (three times per week) and generally improving exercises (2 times per week).

    "18": "The purpose of this paper is to discuss whether the randomized clinical trial (RCT) is indeed the gold standard among epidemiological studies. This paper illustrates to what extent different study designs may contribute to the answer of the following therapeutic research question based on a study of Wanner et al.: 'Is the use of a statin associated to less cardiac mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who receive hemodialysis?' If a therapeutic study is feasible, like the research question of the clinical example, the RCT is almost unbeatable: the problems that may occur in the other study designs do not exist or to a lesser extent using an RCT. The main advantage of an RCT is that the randomization procedure helps to prevent selection bias by the clinician by breaking the link between the clinician's therapy prescription and the patient's prognosis. Within observational studies, however, selection by the clinician may occur, and, even after adjustment for potential confounders in the statistical analysis, it may not be possible to make a fair comparison between the groups. Usually, results from observational studies are needed to come to a hypothesis that can subsequently be tested within an RCT. Moreover, observational data are most often more useful than RCTs for non-therapeutic studies.",

Patients receiving a statin preoperatively and not receiving a statin preoperatively varied in respect to a number of important pre- and peri- operative characteristics. Patients receiving preoperative statin therapy were more likely to have had a history of diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or high cholesterol and to be smokers, but less likely to be undergoing urgent/emergent surgery or surgery utilizing a cardiopulmonary bypass pump (p < 0.05 for all comparisons). In total, 151 (7.8%) patients developed an infectious complication.

Endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery and circulating levels of endothelial and inflammatory markers were measured before and 8 h after the vaccine. Vaccination produced a decline on FMD at 8 h (absolute decrease of 2.55%, P = 0.001), indicating an unfavourable effect on endothelial function. In contrast, in atorvastatin-treated subjects, FMD was preserved after vaccination (decrease of 0.15%, P = 0.005 vs. placebo). The vaccination-induced decline in plasma level of nitric oxide metabolites (by 6.0 micromol/L, P = 0.007) and antioxidant capacity (by 20.6 micromol/L, P = 0.001) in the placebo group were completely abolished by atorvastatin (P = 0.038 and P = 0.005, respectively, vs. placebo).

    "27": "In cirrhosis, increased RhoA/Rho-kinase signaling and decreased nitric oxide (NO) availability contribute to increased intrahepatic resistance and portal hypertension. Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) regulate intrahepatic resistance. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) inhibit synthesis of isoprenoids, which are necessary for membrane translocation and activation of small GTPases like RhoA and Ras. Activated RhoA leads to Rho-kinase activation and NO synthase inhibition. We therefore investigated the effects of atorvastatin in cirrhotic rats and isolated HSCs. Rats with secondary biliary cirrhosis (bile duct ligation, BDL) were treated with atorvastatin (15 mg/kg per day for 7 days) or remained untreated. Hemodynamic parameters were determined in vivo (colored microspheres). Intrahepatic resistance was investigated in in situ perfused livers. Expression and phosphorylation of proteins were analyzed by RT-PCR and immunoblots. Three-dimensional stress-relaxed collagen lattice contractions of HSCs were performed after incubation with atorvastatin. Atorvastatin reduced portal pressure without affecting mean arterial pressure in vivo. This was associated with a reduction in intrahepatic resistance and reduced responsiveness of in situ-perfused cirrhotic livers to methoxamine. Furthermore, atorvastatin reduced the contraction of activated HSCs in a 3-dimensional stress-relaxed collagen lattice. In cirrhotic livers, atorvastatin significantly decreased Rho-kinase activity (moesin phosphorylation) without affecting expression of RhoA, Rho-kinase and Ras. In activated HSCs, atorvastatin inhibited the membrane association of RhoA and Ras. Furthermore, in BDL rats, atorvastatin significantly increased hepatic endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) mRNA and protein levels, phospho-eNOS, nitrite/nitrate, and the activity of the NO effector protein kinase G (PKG).", 
    "28": "In cirrhotic rats, atorvastatin inhibits hepatic RhoA/Rho-kinase signaling and activates the NO/PKG-pathway. This lowers intrahepatic resistance, resulting in decreased portal pressure. Statins might represent a therapeutic option for portal hypertension in cirrhosis.", 
    "29": "Over the past decade, statins have been proven to significantly decrease coronary events in primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease. Recent clinical trials have indicated that statins significantly reduce stroke risk in patients with vascular disease. The Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' Collaborators in a meta-analysis including 90,056 patients found that the use of statins determined a significant 17% proportional reduction in the incidence of first-ever stroke of any type per 1 mmol/l low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol reduction. During an average of 5 years of treatment, the reduction in the overall incidence of stroke was about one sixth per 1 mmol/l LDL cholesterol decrease meaning that 8 fewer participants have any stroke per 1,000 among those with preexisting coronary artery disease at baseline, compared with 5 fewer per 1,000 among the participants with no such history. It is not known whether these findings might be due to the cholesterol reduction effect of statins or to pleiotropic effects of statins, such as improved endothelial function, decreased platelet aggregability, and reduced vascular inflammation. In secondary prevention of stroke, the Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) study found that treatment with atorvastatin reduced the risk of recurrent cerebrovascular events in patients with recent stroke or transient ischemic attack but no history of heart disease. Combining the results of patients with no history of heart disease from the SPARCL study and Heart Protection Study in a mini meta-analysis, compared with placebo, statins were associated with a barely nonsignificant difference in recurrent stroke (OR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.75-1.01, p = 0.07) and a significant difference in the occurrence of major vascular events (OR = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.68-0.88, p = 0.0001) at final follow-up.",

The PPAR family, including PPAR-alpha, play important roles in glucose and lipid metabolism and atherosclerosis and thus are potential therapeutic targets. Fibrates act upon PPAR-alpha and appear to target the typical dyslipidaemia of diabetes. Several large prospective clinical trials have shown both primary prevention and secondary prevention benefit with fibrates, although they only had small subgroups of patients with diabetes. The first large outcome study to exclusively study those with diabetes was the FIELD study, which showed no reduction in the primary cardiovascular end-point and only some benefit in the secondary end-point. There are many potential explanations for these results; however, it would appear that at present, there is no role for fibrates as monotherapy for the reduction of cardiovascular risk among those with diabetes.

Patients were treated with ACE-I (n = 31) or ARB (n = 18) or statins (n = 50) prior to ablation and for the duration of follow-up.", 
    "56": "After a mean follow-up of 13.8 +/- 8.6 months, 72% of patients were free of AF. For patients taking statins, 33 of 50 (60%) were free of AF. In patients treated with ACE-I, 17 of 31 (55%) were free from AF, while in the group of patients treated with ARB, 17 of 18 (94%) were free from AF. Using Cox regression analysis to correct for baseline variables, treatment with statins did not decrease the recurrence rate (HR = 1.10 [95% CI: 0.55-2.27] p = 0.79); nor did treatment with renin angiotensin system (RAS) blockers (HR 0.94 [95% CI: 0.46-1.93] p = 0.87). However, subgroup analysis showed that treatment with ARB was associated with a trend towards lower AF recurrence [HR 0.17, (95% CI: 0.02-1.34) p = 0.09].", 
    "57": "Even though statins and RAS blockers possess anti-inflammatory properties, they did not decrease the recurrence of AF following ablation. However, the subset of patients taking ARB exhibited a trend towards lower AF recurrence. Larger, randomized studies are needed to address this observation.", 
    "58": "Recently, statins have appeared to have additional benefits beyond their lipid lowering effects, which has led to the interest in the use of this class of drugs outside the realm of cardiovascular disease. Simvastatin (SIM) is a commonly prescribed statin with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Excessive generation of oxygen-derived free radicals (ODFR) and proinflammatory mediators has been implicated in the pathogenesis of gastric ulcers. This investigation aimed to study the effect of SIM on experimentally induced gastric acid secretion and ulcer formation.", 
    "59": "Adult Wistar rats were divided into experimental groups containing six animals. Acid secretion studies were undertaken using pylorus-ligated rats pretreated with SIM (20, 40, and 60 mg/kg). The effect of orally administered SIM was also studied on indomethacin- and ethanol-induced gastric ulcers. The levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO), non-protein sulfhydryls (NP-SH), nitric oxide (NO), antioxidant enzymes, and gastric wall mucus were measured in the glandular stomach of rats following ethanol-induced gastric lesions.", 
    "60": "Administration of SIM significantly and dose-dependently inhibited the volume of gastric secretion and the acidity. Pretreatment with SIM significantly reduced the formation of indomethacin- and ethanol-induced gastric lesions. The antiulcer activity of SIM was associated with significant attenuation of adverse effects of ethanol on gastric wall mucus, NP-SH and MPO. SIM modified the gastric NO levels and reversed the ethanol-induced decrease in glutathione-S-transferase and increase in superoxide dismutase and catalase.", 
    "61": "These findings clearly suggest the involvement of proinflammatory agents and ODFR in the pathogenesis of gastric lesions. The gastroprotective effects of SIM are mediated by inhibition of neutrophils activity, reduction of oxidative stress, and maintenance of vascular integrity. This study was conducted in rats; its relevance to human gastric ulcers is not known and warrants further study.", 
    "62": "It has been well established that statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, reduce mortality from cardiovascular diseases. Statins, a class of cholesterol-lowering drug, may also affect mortality from various diseases by their pleiotropic effects of anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative activities. However, there are only few reports concerning the effects of statins on diseases other than cardiovascular diseases. We therefore designed a population-based analysis, using the data from marketing surveys on statin sales and government reports on mortalities. We compared the statin use as expressed by statin sales per capita in the aged (> or = 65-year-old) population with mortality from major causes of death among 47 prefectures in Japan. As expected, there were significant negative correlations between statin sales per capita and mortality from cardiovascular diseases (p < 0.05). In addition, we found that there was a correlation between statin sales and the decrease in mortality from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (p < 0.0001), senility (p < 0.01), pneumonia (p < 0.05), accidents (p < 0.05), or all death causes (p < 0.05). However, statin sales were not associated with mortalities from renal failure, liver diseases, suicide, and malignant diseases. These results suggest a broad spectrum of beneficial effects of statins, including reduction of mortality rate of COPD as well as cardiovascular diseases. It will be worthy to confirm the protective effect of statins on COPD by prospective randomized clinical trials.",

Angiotensin II (Ang II) contributes to cardiovascular damage through the production of profibrotic factors, such as connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). Our aim was to investigate whether HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors could modulate Ang II responses, evaluating CTGF expression and the mechanisms underlying this process. In cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) atorvastatin and simvastatin inhibited Ang II-induced CTGF production. The inhibitory effect of statins on CTGF upregulation was reversed by mevalonate and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate, suggesting that RhoA inhibition could be involved in this process. In VSMCs, statins inhibited Ang II-induced Rho membrane localization and activation. In these cells Ang II regulated CTGF via RhoA/Rho kinase activation, as shown by inhibition of Rho with C3 exoenzyme, RhoA dominant-negative overexpression, and Rho kinase inhibition. Furthermore, activation of p38MAPK and JNK, and redox process were also involved in Ang II-mediated CTGF upregulation, and were downregulated by statins. In rats infused with Ang II (100 ng/kg per minute) for 2 weeks, treatment with atorvastatin (5 mg/kg per day) diminished aortic CTGF and Rho activation without blood pressure modification. Rho kinase inhibition decreased CTGF upregulation in rat aorta, mimicking statin effect. CTGF is a vascular fibrosis mediator. Statins diminished extracellular matrix (ECM) overexpression caused by Ang II in vivo and in vitro. In summary, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors inhibit several intracellular signaling systems activated by Ang II (RhoA/Rho kinase and MAPK pathways and redox process) involved in the regulation of CTGF. Our results may explain, at least in part, some beneficial effects of statins in cardiovascular diseases.",

The themes of the panel discussion were the design features of three trials, WOSCOPS, AFCAPS/TexCAPS, and Japan's MEGA Study; comparison of their primary endpoints; and the implications of their results. Among the topics discussed by the panel of experts from Japan, USA, and UK were observations on the benefits associated with pravastatin at low dose as demonstrated in the MEGA Study as well as that study's implications for women, who represented the majority of subjects. Several suggestions were put forth to explain how the low dose used in MEGA elicited similar LDL-C reductions to those observed in WOSCOPS and AFCAPS/TexCAPS at higher doses including the body size hypothesis, genetic variation, and statin-diet interaction. It was felt that in Japan, the current guidelines are adequate; there seemed no merit in radically reducing LDL-C levels since in the Japanese population the risk is generally low. Japanese physicians tend to use small doses of statin and believe that these are effective in lowering cholesterol sufficiently with few side effects and encourage good compliance.",

Older individuals benefited as much as younger ones from lovastatin. Subjects with > or =2 risk factors benefited more from statin than those with <2 risk factors. At baseline, HDL-C but not TC or LDL-C was determined a significant predictor of risk. On treatment, ApoB and ApoA1 were the best predictors.

Ezetimibe reduces the small intestinal enterocyte uptake and absorption of cholesterol by binding to Niemann-Pick C1 Like 1 (NPC1L1), which keeps cholesterol in the intestinal lumen for excretion. Ezetimibe undergoes glucuronidation to a single metabolite and localizes at the intestinal wall, where it binds with higher affinity for NPC1L1 than ezetimibe to prevent cholesterol absorption. Enterohepatic recirculation of ezetimibe and/or its glucuronide ensures repeated delivery to the intestinal site of action and limited peripheral exposure. Ezetimibe has no effect on the activity of major drug metabolizing enzymes (CYP450), which reduces any potential drug-drug interactions with other medications. Ezetimibe (10 mg/day) was found to inhibit cholesterol absorption by an average of 54% in hypercholesterolemic individuals and by 58% in vegetarians. Ezetimibe alone reduced plasma total and LDL-Cholesterol (18%) levels in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia.

    "94": "Erythropoietin (Epo) is a cytokine that is required for the survival of erythroid progenitors through interaction with its receptor on the surface of these cells. Recent studies showed that erythropoietin receptor (EpoR) is expressed on many cancer cells. The factors that govern EpoR expression on the cell surface are poorly understood. Using both biotinlyation and radiolabeled Epo binding experiments, we show here that Epo starvation of the Epo-dependent erythroleukemia cell line, ASE2, leads to a time-dependent increase in both forms of EpoR, the maturing 64 kDa and the mature 66 kDa proteins. Mevalonate depletion inhibits the formation of the highly glycosylated mature form of EpoR without affecting the other form. Treatment of cells with lovastatin, a selective inhibitor of the rate-limiting enzyme in the mevalonate pathway leads to inhibition of cell surface EpoR that is induced by Epo starvation. The effect of lovastatin appears to be the consequence of inhibition of two processes, glycosylation and geranylgeranylation. Adding back geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate to lovastatin-treated cells completely prevents the lovastatin effect on EpoR expression. Dolichol, the sugar carrier in N-linked glycosylation that is derived from the mevalonate pathway, partially reverses lovastatin's effect. The glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin also partially suppresses EpoR surface expression. Inhibiting protein geranylgeranylation mimics the effect of lovastatin and inhibits EpoR surface expression in a concentration-dependent manner. Finally, lovastatin inhibits Epo's stimulatory effects on cell proliferation. These results indicate that mevalonate derivatives are required for normal EpoR expression on the cell surface through two pathways, glycosylation and geranylgeranylation.",

Before statins were available, physicians did not know whether cholesterol lowering improved cardiovascular health. Pioneering studies such as the Framingham Study and MR FIT identified high blood cholesterol as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. However, because total cholesterol (TC) < or =300 mg/dL was common physicians were not convinced that this was abnormal. Cholesterol reduction by cholestyramine, nicotinic acid, and fibrates reduced the risk of coronary artery disease, but these treatments did not improve survival and quality of life. In 1987, the first statin arrived. This class of agents lowered cholesterol effectively with minimal side effects. Guidelines started to recognize the importance of cholesterol reduction. There followed a series of endpoint studies that emphatically demonstrated that statins improved cardiovascular outcomes. The WOSCOPS trial showed in a large cohort of men with TC >250 mg/dL and no prior MI that pravastatin dramatically reduced MI incidence, cardiovascular and total mortality, and revascularizations versus placebo over 5 years. WOSCOPS revealed for the first time that statin was effective for primary prevention. The benefits appeared early and persisted even after treatment ended.

This represents an approximate 10% net saving in health care costs (total of 227,111 versus 203,415 Euros for the placebo and treatment groups, respectively). As such, based on the 95% CI calculated for observed event rates per 1000 person years at risk, the cost impact of fenofibrate therapy ranged from a 24% net saving to a 4% net increase in health care costs relative to treatment with placebo.

Fixed effect logit and Poisson regressions estimate the effect of copays on monthly likelihood of high compliance and average monthly days of supply respectively. Higher copays reduce compliance among statin users, with less compliant patients responding more strongly to copay change than compliant patients.

In 48 dogs, 10 to 14 epicardial leads were recorded on the anterior surface of the left ventricle in the distribution and vicinity of the site of occlusion of a branch of the left anterior descending coronary artery. The average S-T segment elevation for each animal was determined at 5-min intervals after occlusion. This elevation was used as an index of the presence and severity of myocardial ischemic injury. Isoproterenol, ouabain, glucagon, bretylium, and tachycardia given prior to a repeated occlusion each increased the severity and extent of ischemic injury, while propranolol decreased it. Elevation of arterial pressure with methoxamine reduced the occlusion-induced S-T segment elevation, and lowering of the mean arterial pressure by hemorrhage had the opposite effect. In 19 additional experiments, propranolol, isoproterenol, and alterations in arterial pressure produced similar alterations in S-T segment elevation when these interventions were applied as long as 3 hr after ligation. Myocardial creatine phosphokinase (CPK) activity determined 24 hr after coronary artery ligation correlated well with S-T segment elevation at the same sites recorded 15 min after ligation. Moreover, isoproterenol increased and propranolol decreased the area of depression of myocardial CPK activity. We conclude that the hemodynamic status and neurohumoral background at the time of coronary occlusion and for at least 3 hr thereafter can alter the extent and severity of myocardial ischemic injury and myocardial necrosis.",

Clinical trials have demonstrated that renal excretion and, in particular, tubular secretion, plays a role in rosuvastatin clearance. The aim of this study was to determine the involvement of the basolateral organic anion transporters, OAT1 and OAT3, in the renal uptake of rosuvastatin. Expression of human (h) OAT3 in Xenopus oocytes significantly increased the uptake of rosuvastatin above control levels (K(m) = 7.4 microM). In contrast hOAT1 did not mediate rosuvastatin uptake. Furthermore, hOAT3-mediated estrone-3-sulfate uptake could be inhibited, with a rank order of potency, by atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin, whereas hOAT1-mediated PAH uptake was only significantly inhibited by simvastatin. To estimate the contribution of hOAT3 to the overall renal uptake of rosuvastatin, a series of experiments were conducted using rat kidney slices. Rosuvastatin uptake in rat renal slices was abolished in the presence of the rat (r) Oat3-specific inhibitor benzylpenicillin, suggesting that rOat3 is responsible for the majority of rosuvastatin uptake across the basolateral membrane in rat kidney. From these findings, we can suggest that hOAT3 contributes to the renal uptake of rosuvastatin in humans.",

By 2005, the use of all drug types had increased; at least half of the patients received each type of drug. However, only one-third of patients received all three medication types and combined blood pressure treatment was limited. Older age, a diagnosis of TIA rather than stroke and absence of co-existing coronary heart disease were associated with lower rates of use of specific medication categories.",

    "114": "Endothelial dysfunction has been shown to be a prognostic factor for cardiovascular disease and improvement of endothelial dysfunction prevents cardiovascular event presentation. Endothelial dysfunction is associated to a reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioactivity, as a result of the impairment of NO synthesis/release by the endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) or by inactivation of NO. Endothelial dysfunction measurements are valuable surrogate markers to assess the effectiveness of interventions addressed to prevent or treat coronary heart disease (CHD). Dyslipemia and other cardiovascular risk factors promote endothelial dysfunction and life style changes and pharmacological treatment, particularly HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), have shown early improve of endothelial-dependent vasomotion. Statins efficiently reduce plasma LDL cholesterol, an effect that may account for their beneficial effect on endothelial function, but they also reduce cellular levels of isoprenoid compounds relevant for the bioavailability of NO. Statins restore NO production by several mechanisms, including up-regulation of eNOS mRNA and protein levels and preservation of NO inactivation by reactive oxygen species (ROS). These effects are mediated, at least in a part, through mechanisms independent of their lipid lowering effect (pleiotropic effects). In this article we discuss the relevance of endothelium-dependent effects on the early and delayed clinical benefit of statins, as well as the multiple ways by which statins may restore endothelial function acting not only on the endothelium but also on endothelial progenitor cells (EPC), which likely could contribute to both ischemia-induced neovascularization and endothelial regeneration after injury.", 
    "115": "It wasn't until 1990, when the existence of two different cyclooxygenases was hypothesized, based on the evidence that steroids inhibited the increase in COX activity induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharides in macrophages, without any effects on the basal production of prostaglandins or leukotrienes. The first isoform, COX-1 is responsible for the production of \"housekeeping\" prostaglandins critical to the maintenance of normal renal function, gastric mucosal integrity, platelet aggregation, and the autocrine response to circulating hormones. COX-2 on the other hand is an inducible enzyme, upregulated 20-fold in macrophages, monocytes, synoviocytes, chondrocytes, fibroblasts, osteoblasts and endothelial cells by various inflammatory stimuli and cytochines. Classical findings shown that the therapeutics effects of NSAIDs are largely dependent on COX-2 inhibition, whereas some undesirable side effects are bound to COX-1 blockade, such as gastrointestinal bleeding and renal failure. Therefore, agents that selectively inhibit COX-2 over COX-1 are desirable for the treatment of inflammation. However, since September 2004 reports of increased risk of thrombotic cardiovascular events had accumulated for coxibs, the COX-2 inhibitors. Our goal is to provide an overview of the relevant biology and pharmacology of this enzyme in atherosclerosis.",

    "120": "Alzheimer's disease is characterised by the loss of neurons and the production of Abeta peptides. We report that the addition of Abeta(1-42) to neurons resulted in activation of cytoplasmic phospholipase A(2) (cPLA(2)), the production of prostaglandin E(2), synapse damage and reduced neuronal survival. Pre-treatment with simvastatin, a clinically relevant statin that penetrates the brain, protected against Abeta(1-42) induced synapse damage and neuronal death in vitro. The neuroprotective effects of simvastatin were shared by squalestatin, a squalene synthase inhibitor that reduces neuronal cholesterol production and crucially, does not affect isoprenoid formation. The protective effect of both these drugs was reversed by the addition of exogenous cholesterol. These drugs did not alter the amounts of extracellular Abeta(1-42) ingested by neurons; rather they reduced Abeta(1-42) induced activation of cPLA(2) and prostaglandin E(2) production. Treatment prevented the migration of Abeta(1-42) and cPLA(2) to caveolin-1 containing lipid rafts. We propose that critical concentrations of Abeta(1-42) trigger the amalgamation of individual micro-domains containing signalling molecules to form lipid raft platforms in which sustained activation of cPLA(2) leads to neuronal dysfunction and ultimately neuronal death. This process is dependent on the amounts of cholesterol in neuronal membranes and is susceptible to treatment with squalestatin or simvastatin.",

By multivariate analysis, ABI provided the strongest prediction of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 2.34; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.36 to 4.05; P = .002). Conversely, DSE with inducible or fixed wall motion abnormalities showed no association with cardiovascular events or increased mortality in multivariate analysis. The only DSE variable independently predictive of mortality was decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (<50%) at peak stress (HR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.22 to 2.36; P = .002).

This has lead to a series of international and national recommendations for a further reduction in target values for LDL-cholesterol, which is often difficult to achieve with the usual dosage of statins. The combination of a statin with ezetimibe, acting as a dual inhibition mechanism against the synthesis and absorption of cholesterol, reduces LDL-cholesterol significantly more than treatment with a statin in monotherapy. This allows many more patients to achieve the target value for LDL-cholesterol. At present a drug combination comprising ezetimibe 10 mg and simvastatin in all doses (10, 20, 40 and 80 mg) is being introduced into our market under the company name Inegy. In addition to reducing LDL-cholesterol by up to 61% this combination has a positive effect on a range of other parameters for lipid metabolism and inflamation. A typical initial dose of ezetimibe 10 mg/simvastatin 20 mg reduces LDL-cholesterol by around 50%, which is necessary for the stabilisation of atherosclerotic plaque. For patients requiring more aggressive reduction of LDL-cholesterol it is best to start with a dose of ezetimibe 10 mg/simvastatin 40 mg. The highest dose of 10 mg/80 mg is intended for patients with the highest level of risk and reduces LDL-cholesterol by around 60%. In all the studies that have been carried out so far, the combination of ezetimibe and statin was very well tolerated and the safety profile of this combination was the same a treatment with the statin alone. At present a wide range of large clinical studies are underway to test whether LDL-cholesterol reduction using the ezetimibe + statin combination will also lead to a lower risk of cardiovascular events.",

Fenofibrate therapy combined with a single lifestyle intervention in the form of individual interview resulted in the following improvement of the risk profile of the above patients: significant decrease in body weight and waist circumference, decrease in blood pressure and fasting glycemia; improvement of typical dyslipidemia in 90% of patients, however, only 30% of patients achieved the target TG levels below 1.7 mmol/l and the HDL-cholesterol levels above 1.3 mmol/l and 1 mmol/l in women and men, respectively. A total of 60% of patients no longer met the criteria for MS after 6 months of therapy. However, LDL-cholesterol and total cholesterol levels in patients with IHD or with diabetes were very unsatisfactory; only 6% of patients had achieved the recommended level of target LDL-cholesterol below 2.5 mmol/l before the intervention, i.e. 94% of the patient sample was indicated for statin therapy. 86% of patients with LDL-cholesterol above 2.5 mmol/l remained in our patient sample after non-pharmacological and pharmacological fibrate therapy.

The extent of inflammation was determined by U937 adhesion assay as well as analysis of the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, interleukin (IL)-8, IL-6, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), p38, and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)-3. The activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) was determined by Western blot.",

The activation of JNK and NF-kappaB was also blocked by rosuvastatin. The inhibitors of JNK, NF-kappaB, and STAT-3 produced a statistically significant decrease of the TNF-alpha induced U937 adhesion and IL-6 protein release.",

    "164": "A 35-year-old male was diagnosed as angina pectoris and showed severe stenosis with soft plaque in the proximal segment of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery as detected by multi-detector row computed tomography (MDCT). Although percutaneous coronary stent implantation to the LAD lesion was performed, soft plaque remained in the proximal lesion of the stent. Atorvastatin increased the coronary plaque density at the 6-month follow-up MDCT examination, and the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level fell from 141 to 63 mg/dl after 6 months. This case may indicate that assessment of the shape or composition of coronary plaque by MDCT is a useful strategy for judging the effects of intensive lipid-lowering therapy using statin.", 
    "165": "Statins, commonly used to treat hypercholesterolemia, have been shown to trigger tumor-specific apoptosis in certain cancers, including multiple myeloma (MM), a plasma cell malignancy with poor prognosis. In this article, we show that of a panel of 17 genetically distinct MM cell lines, half were sensitive to statin-induced apoptosis and, despite pharmacodynamic evidence of drug uptake and activity, the remainder were insensitive. Sensitive cells were rescued from lovastatin-induced apoptosis by mevalonate, geranylgeranyl PPi, and partially by farnesyl PPi, highlighting the importance of isoprenylation. Expression profiling revealed that Rho GTPase mRNAs were differentially expressed upon lovastatin exposure in sensitive cells, yet ectopic expression of constitutively active Rho or Ras proteins was insufficient to alter sensitivity to lovastatin-induced apoptosis. This suggests that sensitivity involves more than one isoprenylated protein and that statins trigger apoptosis by blocking many signaling cascades, directly or indirectly deregulated by the oncogenic lesions of the tumor cell. Indeed, clustering on the basis of genetic abnormalities was shown to be significantly associated with sensitivity (P = 0.003). These results suggest that statins may be a useful molecular targeted therapy in the treatment of a subset of MM.", 
    "166": "HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors (statins) influence lipid metabolism and have pleiotropic effects. Several statins reduce various forms of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in animal models. The relationship between atorvastatin and expression of serotonin transporter protein (5-HTT) remains unknown. This study focused on the effects of atorvastatin on the course of monocrotaline (MCT)-induced PH and its relation to 5-HTT expression. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were challenged with MCT with or without subsequent daily oral treatment with 0.1, 1, and 10 mg/kg of atorvastatin for 28 days. Over the 4-wk course, the progression of PH was followed by transthoracic echocardiography [pulmonary artery pressure was assessed by pulmonary artery flow acceleration time (PAAT), an estimate reciprocal to pulmonary artery pressure], and, at the end of the 4-wk course, invasive right ventricular pressure, right ventricular weight, quantitative morphology, and 5-HTT expression were measured. MCT caused significant PH as early as 7 days after injection. Atorvastatin treatment increased PAAT and reduced right ventricular pressure, right ventricular hypertrophy, and vascular remodeling over the 4-wk course. MCT challenge was associated with increased pulmonary vascular 5-HTT expression, and atorvastatin treatment reduced the 5-HTT expression. MCT-induced PH over the course of 4 wk can be easily followed by transthoracic echocardiography, and atorvastatin is effective in reducing the PH. Atorvastatin's effects are associated with a decrease of 5-HTT expression.", 
    "167": "High plasma homocysteine (Hcy) has been linked to impaired endothelial function. We investigated whether treatment with pravastatin affects the Hcy levels. Moreover, we studied whether the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T polymorphism affects coronary vasomotion at baseline and during the treatment with pravastatin. Fifty-one healthy, mildly hypercholesterolemic men (mean age 35+/-4 years) attended this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The volunteers were randomised into groups with 6-month treatment with pravastatin (40 mg/day, n=25) or placebo (n=26). Coronary blood flow measurements with positron emission tomography at rest and during adenosine infusion as well as biochemical analyses were done at baseline and at the end of the treatment period. The Hcy concentration decreased significantly during the pravastatin therapy (-0.81+/-1.46 micromol/l, p=0.01), but not during placebo (0.02+/-2.39 micromol/l, p=0.97). The MTHFR polymorphism did not affect the Hcy concentration or coronary flow indices. Neither did the MTHFR polymorphism modulate the effects of pravastatin on coronary vasomotion. In conclusion, a 6-month therapy with pravastatin decreases Hcy concentration in Finnish healthy young men. The MTHFR genotype is neither a determinant of baseline coronary flow indices nor does it modulate the effect of pravastatin on coronary reactivity.",

MMPs in aortic biopsies were measured using gelatin zymography. Although recruitment closed early because of increasing statin use among eligible patients, with only 21 patients we demonstrated a 40% reduction in MMP-9 levels in the AAA wall in patients randomised to simvastatin. This provides a possible molecular mechanism to explain the reportedly beneficial effects of statins to slow AAA growth.",

    "171": "We deal with the design problem of early phase dose-finding clinical trials with monotone biologic endpoints, such as biological measurements, laboratory values of serum level, and gene expression. A specific objective of this type of trial is to identify the minimum dose that exhibits adequate drug activity and shifts the mean of the endpoint from a zero dose to the so-called minimum effective dose. Stepwise test procedures for dose finding have been well studied in the context of nonhuman studies where the sampling plan is done in one stage. In this article, we extend the notion of stepwise testing to a two-stage enrollment plan in an attempt to reduce the potential sample size requirement by shutting down unpromising doses in a futility interim. In particular, we examine four two-stage designs and apply them to design a statin trial with four doses and a placebo in patients with Hodgkin's disease. We discuss the calibration of the design parameters and the implementation of these proposed methods. In the context of the statin trial, a calibrated two-stage design can reduce the average total sample size up to 38% (from 125 to 78) from a one-stage step-down test, while maintaining comparable error rates and probability of correct selection. The price for the reduction in the average sample size is the slight increase in the maximum total sample size from 125 to 130.",

    "176": "Over the past two decades, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (HMGCRIs), originally designed to lower cholesterol blood levels, have been found to affect GTPase signaling during normal intracellular tasks. This finding has prompted use of these drugs in pathological situations, where such signaling processes need to be manipulated. Here, we review recent progress on the outcome of modulating GTPase signaling after inhibition of protein prenylation by HMGCRIs. We also discuss current controversies over the direct implications of these cholesterol-lowering agents on cholesterol-rich membrane lipid rafts and associated signaling. By reviewing these two different cellular events and the evidence from clinical studies, an overall assessment can be made of the concept of interfering with the HMG-CoA reductase pathway in different brain pathologies. We thereby provide a rational link between the benefit of applying HMGCRIs in brain pathologies, such as multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and stroke, and the impact on signaling in specific cell types crucial to disease pathogenesis.",

The exact mechanisms regulating eNOS protein expression in human vasculature are still under intensive investigation. Recent evidence suggests that statin treatment induces the expression of eNOS in vascular endothelium, leading to a respective improvement of endothelial function. Among other mechanisms, it seems that statins increase eNOS protein levels in the vasculature, partly by up-regulating klotho protein expression. This novel observation is consistent with several lines of clinical evidence suggesting that statins have antiatherogenic effects in human vasculature, by mechanisms other than lipid-lowering.",

Cerebral vasospasm (CV) is ure to consistently respond to treatment, emphasizing the need for further research into the underlying mechanisms of SAH-induced cerebrovascular dysfunction. To this end, our paper reviews the relevant literature on the main therapies employed for CV after aSAH and discusses possible avenues for future investigations. Current management of this condition consists of maximal medical therapy, including triple H regimen and oral administration of calcium antagonists, followed by endovascular balloon angioplasty and/or injection of vasodilatory agents for refractory cases.

Several studies have identified a beneficial effect of statins on diabetic nephropathy; however, the molecular mechanisms are unclear. In this study, we show that statin ameliorates nephropathy in db/db mice, a rodent model of type 2 diabetes, via downregulation of NAD(P)H oxidase NOX4, which is a major source of oxidative stress in the kidney. Pitavastatin treatment for 2 weeks starting at 12 weeks of age significantly reduced albuminuria in the db/db mice concomitant with a reduction of urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine and 8-epi-prostaglandin F(2alpha). Immunohistochemical analysis found increased amounts of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine and NOX4 protein in the kidney of db/db mice. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction also showed increased levels of NOX4 mRNA. Pitavastatin normalized all of these changes in the kidneys of diabetic animals. Additionally, 12-week treatment with the statin completely normalized the levels of transforming growth factor-beta1 and fibronectin mRNA as well as the mesangial expansion characteristic of diabetic nephropathy. Our study demonstrates that pitavastatin ameliorates diabetic nephropathy in db/db mice by minimizing oxidative stress by downregulating NOX4 expression. These findings may provide insight into the mechanisms of statin therapy in early stages of diabetic nephropathy.",
