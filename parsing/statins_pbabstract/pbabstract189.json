    "0": "C-reactive protein (CRP) is well-known inflammatory marker, and recognized as a risk predictor of pulmonary arterial diseases. Although statins have a beneficial effect in animal models and patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), the underlying mechanisms of their actions have less been investigated. The aims of this study was to examined the effects of CRP on expressions of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and the possible mechanisms of atorvastatin on CRP-induced IL-6 and MCP-1 production in cultured human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). In a preliminary study, the human PASMCs were stimulated by a variety of concentrations of CRP (5-200 microg/mL) at different time points (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 h) for the purpose of determining the dose- and time-dependent effects of CRP on inflammatory response of the cells. Then, the cells were pre-incubated for 2 h with atorvastatin (0.1-10 micromol/L) in the presence of CRP. The supernatant levels of both IL-6 and MCP-1 secretion were examined by ELISA. The cellular mRNA expressions of IL-6 and MCP-1 and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activity were determined by real-time reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), respectively. CRP resulted in elevated IL-6 and MCP-1 secretion and mRNA expression in a dose- and time-dependent manner. In addition, CRP also significantly activated the NF-kappaB pathway. Preincubation with 0.1-10 micromol/L of atorvastatin significantly decreased the secretions of IL-6 and MCP-1 induced by CRP. Moreover, 10 micromol/L of atorvastatin completely abrogated CRP-induced increase in IL-6 and MCP-1 by attenuating the activation of NF-kappaB. The present study demonstrated that inhibiting effect of atorvastatin on CRP-induced inflammatory response in cultured PASMCs was associated with NF-kappaB pathway. This pathway might represent a promising target for controlling CRP-induced inflammatory response in pulmonary arterial diseases.", 
    "1": "Acute lung injury (ALI) remains a significant source of morbidity and mortality in the critically ill patient population. Defined by a constellation of clinical criteria (acute onset of bilateral pulmonary infiltrates with hypoxemia without evidence of hydrostatic pulmonary edema), ALI has a high incidence (200,000 per year in the US) and overall mortality remains high. Pathogenesis of ALI is explained by injury to both the vascular endothelium and alveolar epithelium. Recent advances in the understanding of pathophysiology have identified several biologic markers that are associated with worse clinical outcomes. Phase III clinical trials by the NHLBI ARDS Network have resulted in improvement in survival and a reduction in the duration of mechanical ventilation with a lung-protective ventilation strategy and fluid conservative protocol. Potential areas of future treatments include nutritional strategies, statin therapy, and mesenchymal stem cells.", 
    "2": "Decreased risk of advanced prostate cancer has been reported among men using statins. However, the evidence on overall prostate cancer risk is conflicting. We compared the relative risk between current users and non-users of statins or other cholesterol-lowering medications in a population undergoing systematical prostate cancer screening. The study cohort comprised of 23,320 men participating in the screening arm of the Finnish prostate cancer screening trial during 1996-2004. Information on medication use was obtained from a comprehensive national prescription database. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to calculate multivariable adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for prostate cancer. Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level was compared between current users and non-users of cholesterol-lowering drugs. Compared with medication non-users, the overall prostate cancer incidence was decreased among statin users [HR 0.75, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.63-0.89]. The inverse association was dose-dependent with cumulative amount of statin use, and strongest for low-grade and early stage tumors. The incidence was nonsignificantly lower also among users of other types of cholesterol-lowering drugs (HR 0.62, 95% CI 0.28-1.38), but without dose-dependence. Age-adjusted median serum PSA tended to be lower among users of cholesterol-lowering drugs, but the relative risk decrease among statin users was not related to decreased PSA. Overall incidence of prostate cancer was lowered among statin users when bias due to differential PSA testing between medication users and non-users was eliminated by systematical prostate cancer screening. Cholesterol-lowering with statins seems beneficial for prostate cancer prevention.",

    "5": "Statin users had a non-statistically significantly lower PSA than non-users (0.90 vs. 0.95 ng/mL, p = 0.22), especially in men without comorbidities (n = 1,680; 0.86 vs. 0.99 ng/mL p = 0.02). In men with comorbidities, statin users had a non-statistically significantly higher PSA than non-users (0.91 vs. 0.83 ng/mL, p = 0.14). Men with lower cholesterol had lower PSA (bottom vs. top quintile: 0.92, 1.02 ng/mL, p-trend = 0.06).",

    "7": "When rates of uptake of other drugs differ between treatment arms in long-term trials, the true benefit or harm of the treatment may be underestimated. Methods to allow for such contamination have often been limited by failing to preserve the randomization comparisons. In the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) study, patients were randomized to fenofibrate or placebo, but during the trial many started additional drugs, particularly statins, more so in the placebo group. The effects of fenofibrate estimated by intention-to-treat were likely to have been attenuated. We aimed to quantify this effect and to develop a method for use in other long-term trials.", 
    "8": "We applied efficacies of statins and other cardiovascular drugs from meta-analyses of randomized trials to adjust the effect of fenofibrate in a penalized Cox model. We assumed that future cardiovascular disease events were reduced by an average of 24% by statins, and 20% by a first other major cardiovascular drug. We applied these estimates to each patient who took these drugs for the period they were on them. We also adjusted the analysis by the rate of discontinuing fenofibrate. Among 4,900 placebo patients, average statin use was 16% over five years. Among 4,895 assigned fenofibrate, statin use was 8% and nonuse of fenofibrate was 10%. In placebo patients, use of cardiovascular drugs was 1% to 3% higher. Before adjustment, fenofibrate was associated with an 11% reduction in coronary events (coronary heart disease death or myocardial infarction) (P = 0.16) and an 11% reduction in cardiovascular disease events (P = 0.04). After adjustment, the effects of fenofibrate on coronary events and cardiovascular disease events were 16% (P = 0.06) and 15% (P = 0.008), respectively.",

However, rSRdia for VA demonstrated a weak, but significant, decrease from -2.25 +/- 0.71/sec to -2.04 +/- 0.71/sec (P = 0.003) 1 day after CAG. However, because of the wide overlap between rSRdia values in normal and ischemic segments for VA patients, predictability of remote ischemia based solely on the rSRdia was limited. Subgroup analysis according to statin prescription showed that statin administration contributed to the elimination of rSRdia reduction (-2.28 +/- 0.84/sec on pre-CAG vs. -2.29 +/- 0.77/sec on post-CAG, P = 0.72 for patients without statin premedication; -2.23 +/- 0.64/sec for pre-CAG vs. -1.88 +/- 0.65/sec for post-CAG, P = 0.002 for those without).

In ST, prostacyclin metabolites and NO concentrations were not significantly increased and autoantibodies against ox-LDL concentrations did not change. In ST, the decrease in BP correlated with increase in NO and decrease in autoantibodies against ox-LDL.",

The phase solubility profile indicated that the solubility of ATN Ca was significantly increased in the presence of beta-CD and was classified as AL-type, indicating the 1:1 stoichiometric inclusion complexes. Solid complexes prepared by physical mixing, kneading, co-evaporation, and freeze-drying methods were characterized using differential scanning calorimetry, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and powder X-ray diffractometry. In vitro studies showed that the solubility and dissolution rate of ATN Ca were significantly improved by complexation with beta-CD with respect to the drug alone. In contrast, freeze-dried product showed higher solubility and dissolution rates than the other complexes. ATN Ca unit dosage form was developed and evaluated for physico-chemical properties, stability, and dissolution rate. The stability of tablets was studied and no significant changes were detected in the dissolution profile of tablets after 1 month.",

We sought to determine whether the administration of statins reduces the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation in cardiac surgery patients. We performed a meta-analysis on all studies published between 2004 and 2008 that reported comparisons between statin treatment or nontreatment in these patients. Our primary focus was the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation. Random-effects modeling and sensitivity analysis were used to evaluate the consistency of the calculated treatment effect. Ten qualifying studies generated a total of 4,459 patients. The incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation was 22.6% (622/2,758) in the statin-treated group and 29.8% (507/1,701) in the untreated group. Using the random-effects model, we calculated an odds ratio (OR) of 0.60 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.48-0.76). When we considered only the 4 randomized studies (919 patients) in order to reduce the effects of heterogeneity, this significant reduction in the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation in the statin group was maintained (OR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.41-0.73) with no heterogeneity (chi2 of heterogeneity, 2.96; P = 0.4). In studies wherein only coronary artery bypass grafting was performed, statin treatment decreased postoperative atrial fibrillation (OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.43-0.95). We conclude that statin administration results in a reduction in the incidence of atrial fibrillation in patients who undergo cardiac surgery.

The transition probabilities for CV events in the 'no statin treatment' group were derived from the risk equations reported from the large UKPDS. Risk reductions from the CARDS clinical trial were used to adjust these CV event probabilities in the atorvastatin 10 mg treatment group. The characteristics of type 2 diabetes patients without a CV history were derived from the Belgian OCAPI survey. The public healthcare payers' perspective was taken into account for costing. The direct medical costs of CV events were based on the Public Health Authorities' hospital database for acute care costs and on the literature for the follow-up costs.

Normally fed animals: a Control group with no additional intervention, a Sim group treated with simvastatin for 3 weeks at a dose of 3 mg kg(-1), a POC group subjected to POC with eight cycles of 30-s ischemia/reperfusion, a Sim-POC group treated with simvastatin, and POC. Cholesterol fed (6 weeks) animals: a Chol group with no additional interventions, a Chol-Sim group treated with simvastatin for 3 weeks, a Chol-POC group subjected to POC, and a Chol-Sim-POC group treated with simvastatin and POC. Infarct size and plasma levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), nitrotyrosine (NT), NOx, total cholesterol, and LDL were evaluated. In a second series of experiments, heart tissue samples were taken for MDA, NT, and NOx assessment. Infarct size, circulating MDA, NT, NOx and cardiac MDA, NT, and NOx levels declined in POC and all Sim groups compared with Control, Chol, and Chol-POC (p < 0.05). Simvastatin also reduced total cholesterol and LDL plasma levels. In conclusion, a 3-week simvastatin treatment limits the infarct size and attenuates the oxidative and nitrosative stress both in normo- and in hyper-cholesterolemic rabbits subjected to ischemia-reperfusion irrespective of the presence of POC, while POC is effective only in normocholesterolemic animals.",

    "49": "One month on atorvastatin lowered LDL cholesterol by 24% (131 to 100 mg/dL, p<0.001). In addition, RLP-C, sCD40L and hsCRP significantly decreased, whereas FMD did not change. After 6 months of this therapy, FMD significantly improved compared to baseline values (5.1 vs 3.6%, p=0.04). Changes in FMD and in total and RLP cholesterol significantly correlated. Moreover, FMD was remarkably improved in patients who achieved target LDL levels (<100 mg/dL).", 
    "50": "Switching from a regular to an aggressive statin can improve endothelial function at 6 months in patients with previous coronary artery disease.

    "51": "Inflammation drives the formation, progression, and rupture of atherosclerotic plaques. Experimental studies have demonstrated that an inflammatory subset of monocytes/macrophages preferentially accumulate in atherosclerotic plaque and produce proinflammatory cytokines. T lymphocytes can contribute to inflammatory processes that promote thrombosis by stimulating production of collagen-degrading proteinases and the potent procoagulant tissue factor. Recent data link obesity, inflammation, and modifiers of atherosclerotic events, a nexus of growing clinical concern given the worldwide increase in the prevalence of obesity. Modulators of inflammation derived from visceral adipose tissue evoke production of acute phase reactants in the liver, implicated in thrombogenesis and clot stability. Additionally, C-reactive protein levels rise with increasing levels of visceral adipose tissue. Adipose tissue in obese mice contains increased numbers of macrophages and T lymphocytes, increased T lymphocyte activation, and increased interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) expression. IFN-gamma deficiency in mice reduces production of inflammatory cytokines and inflammatory cell accumulation in adipose tissue. Another series of in vitro and in vivo mouse experiments affirmed that adiponectin, an adipocytokine, the plasma levels of which drop with obesity, acts as an endogenous antiinflammatory modulator of both innate and adaptive immunity in atherogenesis. Thus, accumulating experimental evidence supports a key role for inflammation as a link between risk factors for atherosclerosis and the biology that underlies the complications of this disease. The recent JUPITER trial supports the clinical utility of an assessment of inflammatory status in guiding intervention to limit cardiovascular events. Inflammation is thus moving from a theoretical concept to a tool that provides practical clinical utility in risk assessment and targeting of therapy.", 
    "52": "Recent investigations suggest that proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-8 are involved in the development of colorectal cancer (CRC), whereas statins, primarily used to decrease high levels of blood cholesterol, exhibit pleiotropic effects on carcinogenesis. In the present study we compared the expression of IL-8 and IL-6 in tissue samples of tumor and adjacent normal colon mucosa obtained from patients with advanced colorectal cancer (CRC). The analysis of mRNAs expression for these proinflammatory cytokines determined by RT-PCR showed a higher level of IL-8-mRNA in tumor tissue than in normal mucosa, while IL-6 was similarly expressed in tumor and normal tissue. The mean values of serum levels of both IL-6 and IL-8 were significantly higher in CRC patients than in healthy volunteers. Surgical removal of the tumor resulted in a prompt decrease of serum level of IL-8 already on the third day, whereas IL-6 level was transiently increased to become lower only after 7-10 days. Treatment of CRC with simvastatin (80 mg/day for 14 days) led to a significant decrease of serum IL-6, while the IL-8 level was less affected. The in vitro experiments on colorectal cancer-derived cell lines (HT-29 and Caco-2) demonstrated that application of simvastatin decreased generation of both IL-6 and IL-8. The differences in response of serum levels of IL-6 and IL-8 after tumor removal and treatment with simvastatin are novel observations suggesting distinct pathological roles of the two cytokines in CRC development. We conclude that 1) colorectal carcinogenesis is accompanied by increased synthesis and release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-8; 2) simvastatin therapy results in a decrease in serum level of proinflammatory cytokines, especially IL-6 in CRC and 3) simvastatin inhibits release of IL-8 and IL-6 from colorectal cell lines.",

    "69": "Elderly or older adults constitute a rapidly growing segment of the United States population, thus resulting in an increase in morbidity and mortality related to cardiovascular disease-an increase that is reaching epidemic proportions. Dyslipidemia is a well established risk factor for cardiovascular disease and is estimated to account for more than half of the global cases of coronary artery disease. Despite the increased prevalence of dyslipidemia in the older adult population, controversy persists regarding the benefits of treatment in this group. Epidemiologic studies have shown that dyslipidemia is often underdiagnosed and under treated in this population probably as a result of a paucity of evidence regarding the impact of treatment in delaying the progression of atherosclerotic disease, concerns involving increased likelihood of adverse events or drug interactions, or doubts regarding the cost effectiveness of lipid-lowering therapy in older adults. In conclusion, despite the proven efficacy of lipid-lowering therapy in decreasing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, these therapies have been underutilized in older patients.", 
    "70": "Sustained activation of Akt kinase acts as a focal regulator to increase cell growth and survival, which causes tumorigenesis including breast cancer. Statins, potent inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, display anticancer activity. The molecular mechanisms by which statins block cancer cell growth are poorly understood. We demonstrate that in the tumors derived from MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cell xenografts, simvastatin significantly inhibited phosphorylation of Akt with concomitant attenuation of the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl(XL). In many cancer cells, Bcl(XL) is a target of NFkappaB. Simvastatin inhibited the DNA binding and transcriptional activities of NFkappaB resulting in marked reduction in transcription of Bcl(XL). Signals transmitted by anti-neoplastic mechanism implanted in the cancer cells serve to obstruct the initial outgrowth of tumors. One such mechanism represents the action of the tumor suppressor protein PTEN, which negatively regulates Akt kinase activity. We provide the first evidence for significantly increased levels of PTEN in the tumors of simvastatin-administered mice. Importantly, simvastatin markedly prevented binding of NFkappaB to the two canonical recognition elements, NFRE-1 and NFRE-2 present in the PTEN promoter. Contrary to the transcriptional suppression of Bcl(XL), simvastatin significantly increased the transcription of PTEN. Furthermore, expression of NFkappaB p65 subunit inhibited transcription of PTEN, resulting in reduced protein expression, which leads to enhanced phosphorylation of Akt. Taken together, our data present a novel bifaceted mechanism where simvastatin acts on a nodal transcription factor NFkappaB, which attenuates the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl(XL) and simultaneously derepresses the expression of anti-proliferative/proapoptotic tumor suppressor PTEN to prevent breast cancer cell growth.", 
    "71": "This study investigated the protective effects of pravastatin against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity and the possible mechanisms in mice. Pravastatin showed significant protection as evidenced by the decrease of elevated serum creatinine (CRE) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and improvement of histopathological injury induced by cisplatin. The formation of kidney malondialdehyde (MDA) with a concomitant reduction of reduced glutathione (GSH) were inhibited by pravastatin, while the activities of kidney superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-px) were increased. The over expressions of kidney induced nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and nitrotyrosine (3-NT) were suppressed by pravastatin. Pravastatin suppressed cisplatin-induced p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation in the kidney of mice. These results suggest that pravastatin pre-administration can prevent the nephrotoxicity induced by cisplatin. Pravastatin may exert the protective effect via inhibiting oxidative and nitrosative stress.", 
    "72": "Vascular cell apoptosis, an active form of programmed cell death, plays an integral role in atherosclerosis and in-stent restenosis after angioplasty, thus promoting the precipitation of acute cardiovascular events. Beyond their cholesterol-lowering effects, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, or statins, have been persistently reported to influence the apoptotic process. In this review we discuss the effect of statin treatment on vascular cell apoptosis, and therefore on atherosclerosis development, plaque rupture and in-stent restenosis, based on the results of up-to-date experimental and clinical studies. Lipophilic statins have been shown to induce apoptosis in a variety of cell types, including vascular smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells, whereas hydrophilic statins (rosuvastatin and pravastatin) have not. The clinical importance of statin induced apoptosis remains controversial, as it may blunt vascular wall thickening in the early stages of atherosclerosis or reduce the neointimal response to injury on the one hand, but on the other hand it may also promote destabilization of vulnerable plaques precipitating acute cardiovascular events. Current data support the initiation of statin treatment early enough to inhibit both the formation of atherosclerotic plaques (primary prevention) and in-stent restenosis (secondary prevention).", 
    "73": "Nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs) made from mixtures of Precirol and squalene were prepared to investigate whether the bioavailability of lovastatin can be improved by oral delivery. The size, zeta potential, drug-loading capacity, and release properties of the NLCs were compared with those of lipid nanoparticles containing pure Precirol (solid lipid nanoparticles, SLNs) and squalene (lipid emulsions, LEs). Stable nanoparticles with a mean size range of 180-290 nm and zeta potential range of -3 to -35 mV were developed. More than 70% lovastatin was entrapped in the NLCs and LEs, which was significantly higher compared to the SLNs. The in vitro release kinetics demonstrated that lovastatin release could be reduced by up to 60% with lipid nanoparticles containing Myverol as the lipophilic emulsifier, which showed a decreasing order of NLCs>LEs>SLNs. Drug release was further decreased by soybean phosphatidylcholine (SPC) incorporation, with NLCs and SLNs showing the slowest delivery. The oral lovastatin bioavailability was enhanced from 4% to 24% and 13% when the drug was administered from NLCs containing Myverol and SPC, respectively. The in vivo real-time bioluminescence imaging indicated superior stability of the Myverol system over the SPC system in the gastric environment.",

However, there remain some properties of material to be improved for drug delivery, such as the biodegradability and biocompatibility. In this study, we demonstrate that a biodegradable hydrogel of gelatin can achieve the sustained release of water-insoluble simvastatin. Biologically active simvastatin can be released accompanied with the biodegradation of hydrogel. The biocompatibility issue of material remaining after drug release can be practically resolved. Simvastatin was water-solubilized by gelatin grafted with L-lactic acid oligomer and mixed with gelatin, followed by chemical crosslinking to obtain gelatin hydrogels incorporating simvastatin water-solubilized. The hydrogel augments the simvastatin-induced bone regeneration given biocompatible gelatin fragments and has its potential to deliver a wide range of water-insoluble drugs.",

Seven studies on risk prediction, one clinical decision-analytic modeling study, and three decision-analytic cost-effectiveness studies were included. The adjusted relative risk of high hs-CRP-level ranged from 0.7 to 2.47 (p < .05 in four of seven studies). Adding hs-CRP to the prediction models increased the areas under the curve by 0.00 to 0.027. Based on the clinical decision analysis, both individuals with elevated hs-CRP-levels and those with hyperlipidemia have a similar gain in life expectancy following statin therapy. One high-quality economic modeling study suggests favorable incremental cost-effectiveness ratios for persons with elevated hs-CRP and higher risk. However, many model parameters were based on limited evidence.",

LDL-Cholesterol was reduced by 36.6% at four weeks and 37.5% at eight weeks from baseline. Total cholesterol and triglycerides were significantly reduced. There were no drug-related serious adverse events.

Inflammation-related fluorescent signal was observed in the carotid bifurcation area and around ulcero-hemorrhagic lesions. Pathologically proven unstable plaques had high cathepsin-B-related fluorescent signal. The distribution patterns of the mean cathepsin-B imaging signals showed a difference between the symptomatic vs asymptomatic plaque groups. However, the degree of carotid stenosis or ultrasonographic echodensity was weakly correlated with the inflammatory proteolytic enzyme-related signal, suggesting that molecular imaging yields complimentary new information not available to conventional imaging.",

Statins seem to have multiple effects beyond cholesterol lowering, that is, pleiotropic effects that may include changes in renal function. This study tests the hypothesis that acute treatment with atorvastatin may change glomerular filtration rate, tubular function, vasoactive hormones, blood pressure, and pulse rate in patients with type 2 diabetes. In an acute, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, crossover trial, the effects of atorvastatin on renal function, vasoactive hormones, blood pressure, and pulse rate are measured in 21 patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients are randomized to either 2 doses of atorvastatin 80 mg or placebo before 2 different study days. Treatment with atorvastatin induces a significant reduction in fractional sodium excretion compared with placebo, and sodium clearance tends to be reduced. No significant differences in glomerular filtration rate, albumin/creatinine ratio, vasoactive hormones, and blood pressure by acute treatment with atorvastatin are found in diabetic patients. Acute treatment with atorvastatin reduces renal fractional sodium excretion in patients with type 2 diabetes. No changes are measured in glomerular filtration rate, albumin/creatinine ratio, vasoactive hormones, and blood pressure.", 
    "89": "Cardiovascular events are the dominant cause of death in patients with ESRD. Until recently, plaque rupture due to atherogenic dyslipoproteinemias was presumed to be a major mechanism of cardiovascular events in dialysis patients. But how reasonable was that hypothesis and was it entirely discredited by the results of 4D and AURORA? This article places the conventional lipids-cholesterol and triglyceride-within the more physiologic framework of the apoB lipoproteins. Viewed from the perspective of atherogenic particle number, the failure of statins to lower cardiovascular mortality in hemodialysis patients versus the continuing potential for success in peritoneal dialysis patients becomes comprehensible. In the former, apoB is characteristically not elevated and therefore apoB-lowering therapy can have only limited effect; in the latter, apoB is characteristically high and therefore apoB-lowering therapy might have considerable clinical benefit. Nevertheless, plaque rupture is only one mechanism leading to cardiac death. In addition to those previously noted, a new mechanism is suggested for consideration-recurrent reperfusion injury. The coronaries of dialysis patients are often narrowed, the microcirculation underdeveloped, and the left ventricle hypertrophied-all of these plus transient hypotension could produce severe ischemia followed by reperfusion necrosis. The minor but common elevations of troponin that are so well known yet widely disregarded may be markers of an adverse sequence of events that could each trigger a fatal arrhythmia and tend to reduce left ventricular function. Thus sudden death due to arrhythmia and slow progressive death due to heart failure could be manifestations of reperfusion injury.",

Our estimates detected strong heritability for total (0.53+/-0.10), HMW (0.51+/-0.10) and the HMW/total adiponectin ratio (0.68+/-0.11). Univariate linkage analysis showed suggestive evidence of linkage on chromosome 11p15 for total adiponectin and on 3q13.2-q24 and 6p21 for the HMW adiponectin. The strongest environmental cross-correlation between the adiponectins and lipids was seen between HDL-C and total adiponectin (rhoe=0.64, p<0.05), whereas the strongest genetic correlation was detected between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and the HMW adiponectin (rhog=-0.48, p<0.05).",

Similarly, rats were kept at high fat diet for 90 days and subjected to chronic swimming training (CST) at 46th day and continued up to 90th day. Obesity was assessed by % age change in body weight, WHR ratio and adiposity index whereas cardiac hypertrophy was assessed by using index of cardiac hypertrophy, i.e., left ventricular weight, left ventricular weight to body weight, (LVW/BW), left ventricular wall thickness (LVWT), cardiomyocyte diameter, LV, protein content and collagen content. Further, mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) was also recorded. Oxidative stress was assessed by measuring the levels of thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS), levels of superoxide anion generation and levels of reduced glutathione in left ventricular tissue. The PAAC and CST increased the index of cardiac hypertrophy. Moreover, PAAC has significantly increased MABP. Fluvastatin, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, significantly attenuated PAAC induced left ventricular cardiac hypertrophy and MABP whereas no significant change was observed in CST-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Furthermore, fluvastatin significantly attenuated the oxidative stress by decreasing the levels of TBARS and superoxide anion generation and increasing the levels of reduced glutathione. These results suggest that fluvastatin prevented the PAAC-induced cardiac hypertrophy.", 
    "95": "Hypertension is associated with endothelial dysfunction and increased cardiovascular risk. Caveolin-1 regulates nitric oxide (NO) signaling by modulating endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). The purpose of this study was to examine whether HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor improves impaired endothelial function of the aorta in spontaneous hypertensive rat (SHR) and to determine the underlying mechanisms involved. Eight-week-old male SHR were assigned to either a control group (CON, n=11) or a rosuvastatin group (ROS, n=12), rosuvastatin (10 mg/kg/day) administered for eight weeks. Abdominal aortic rings were prepared and responses to acetylcholine (10(-9)-10(-4) M) were determined in vitro. To evaluate the potential role of NO and caveolin-1, we examined the plasma activity of NOx, eNOS, phosphorylated-eNOS and expression of caveolin-1. The relaxation in response to acetylcholine was significantly enhanced in ROS compared to CON. Expression of eNOS RNA was unchanged, whereas NOx level and phosphorylated-eNOS at serine-1177 was increased accompanied with depressed level of caveolin-1 in ROS. We conclude that 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl Coenzyme-A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor can improve impaired endothelial dysfunction in SHR, and its underlying mechanisms are associated with increased NO production. Furthermore, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor can activate the eNOS by phosphorylation related to decreased caveolin-1 abundance. These results imply the therapeutic strategies for the high blood pressure-associated endothelial dysfunction through modifying caveolin status.", 
    "96": "Because macrophages play an important role in the destabilization of atherosclerotic plaques, and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) contribute to plaque stability, selective clearance of macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques is a promising strategy for plaque stabilization. In the present study, we investigated the effects of fluvastatin, simvastatin, lovastatin, and pravastatin on the viability of macrophages and SMCs. All statins, except pravastatin, induced cell death of J774A.1 macrophages after 24 hours, albeit with different sensitivity. The viability of rabbit aortic SMCs was hardly affected. Fluvastatin-induced macrophage cell death was characterized as apoptosis and could be reversed by isoprenoid intermediates of the mevalonate pathway. Peritoneal macrophages from male or female mice were much more resistant to statin-induced cell death. The high sensitivity of J774A.1 macrophages to statin-induced cell death was related to the strong 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity in these cells. Macrophage and SMC content of rabbit atherosclerotic plaques was not affected after in vitro treatment with fluvastatin or lovastatin for 3 days. In conclusion, fluvastatin, simvastatin, and lovastatin, but not pravastatin, can selectively induce apoptosis in J774A.1 macrophages, but not in SMCs, primary macrophages or rabbit atherosclerotic plaques. This effect was related to the degree of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity in the different cell types.",

In the present study, LNCaP cells were cultured in regular medium containing fetal bovine serum or in medium supplemented with charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum to mimic androgen deprivation treatment. We found that atorvastatin (Lipitor) or celecoxib (Celebrex) treatment of LNCaP cells cultured in regular or androgen-depleted medium inhibited growth and stimulated apoptosis. A combination of atorvastatin and celecoxib was more effective than either agent alone. In animal studies, severe combined immunodeficient mice were injected s.c. with LNCaP cells in Matrigel. After 4 to 6 weeks, mice with LNCaP tumors (about 0.6 cm wide and 0.6 cm long) were surgically castrated and received daily i.p. injections of vehicle, atorvastatin (10 microg/g body weight/d), celecoxib (10 microg/g/d), or a combination of atorvastatin (5 microg/g/d) and celecoxib (5 microg/g/d) for 42 days. In all groups, the androgen-dependent LNCaP tumors regressed initially in response to castration, but the tumors eventually progressed to androgen independence and started to grow. Treatment of the mice with atorvastatin or celecoxib alone suppressed the regrowth of LNCaP tumors after castration. A combination of low doses of atorvastatin and celecoxib had a more potent effect in inhibiting the growth and progression of LNCaP tumors to androgen independence than a higher dose of either agent alone. Our results indicate that administration of a combination of atorvastatin and celecoxib may be an effective strategy for the prevention of prostate cancer progression from androgen dependence to androgen independence.",

All patients are advised secondary prevention with antiplatelet therapy, a statin, treatment of hypertension and smoking cessation. Depending on comorbidity, the indication for an operation is an AAA diameter of 5.5 cm. The anatomical characteristics of the AAA guides the choice for an open operation or endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). In view of the lower perioperative mortality, EVAR is the treatment of choice. Due to the high prevalence of AAA in siblings of patients with an AAA the screening of these family members should be considered.

    "99": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder, affecting millions of people worldwide. Apart from age, the major risk factor identified so far for the sporadic form of AD is possession of the epsilon4 allele of apolipoprotein E (APOE), which is also a risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD). Other apolipoproteins known to play an important role in CAD such as apolipoprotein B are now gaining attention for their role in AD as well. AD and CAD share other risk factors, such as altered cholesterol levels, particularly high levels of low density lipoproteins together with low levels of high density lipoproteins. Statins--drugs that have been used to lower cholesterol levels in CAD, have been shown to protect against AD, although the protective mechanism(s) involved are still under debate. Enzymatic production of the beta amyloid peptide, the peptide thought to play a major role in AD pathogenesis, is affected by membrane cholesterol levels. In addition, polymorphisms in several proteins and enzymes involved in cholesterol and lipoprotein transport and metabolism have been linked to risk of AD. Taken together, these findings provide strong evidence that changes in cholesterol metabolism are intimately involved in AD pathogenic processes. This paper reviews cholesterol metabolism and transport, as well as those aspects of cholesterol metabolism that have been linked with AD.",

Recent major trials have focused on exercise training programs and the widely available nutraceutical omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids or fish oil and statins in patients with HF. In this article, we provide insight into the interpretation of the evidence base for these distinct interventions in HF and provide guidance for the clinical incorporation of exercise training and fish oil therapy for additional CV protection in chronic HF.", 
    "105": "Elevated fasting and postprandial serum triglyceride concentrations are associated with cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. Aerobic exercise reduces serum triglyceride concentrations in the presence or absence of weight loss. Although pharmacological interventions are often used in combination with aerobic exercise to achieve target triglyceride concentrations, information on the combined effects of aerobic exercise and lipid-modifying agents on serum triglycerides is limited. This review examines the independent and combined effects of both interventions on serum fasting and postprandial triglyceride concentrations from the available literature. Reductions in serum triglycerides after aerobic exercise are associated with an increase in skeletal muscle lipoprotein lipase activity and a decrease in hepatic triglyceride and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) synthesis and secretion. Lipid-modifying agents such as niacin, omega-3 fatty acids, and statins also decrease fasting and postprandial triglycerides by increasing lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity and/or decreasing VLDL synthesis. When combined, lipid-modifying agents may reduce fasting and postprandial triglyceride secretion to an extent in which aerobic exercise cannot provide any additional benefit. These observations indicate that aerobic exercise and pharmacological strategies reduce serum triglycerides by similar mechanisms, which may attenuate the triglyceride-lowering capacity of the concordant treatment.",

We utilized the fructose diet-induced dyslipidemic hamsters as an in vivo model and rosuvastatin to examine its effects on liver PCSK9 and LDL receptor (LDLR) expression and serum lipid levels. We showed that rosuvastatin induced PCSK9 mRNA to a greater extent than LDLR mRNA in the hamster liver. The net result was that hepatic LDLR protein level was reduced. This correlated closely with an increase in serum LDL-C with statin treatment. More importantly, we demonstrated that in addition to an increase in sterol response element binding protein 2 (SREBP2) expression, rosuvastatin treatment increased the liver expression of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF1alpha), the newly identified key transactivator for PCSK9 gene expression. Our study suggests that the inducing effect of rosuvastatin on HNF1alpha is likely a underlying mechanism accounting for the higher induction of PCSK9 than LDLR because of the utilization of two transactivators (HNF1alpha and SREBP2) in PCSK9 transcription versus one (SREBP2) in LDLR transcription. Thus, the net balance is in favor of PCSK9-induced degradation of LDLR in the hamster liver, abrogating the effect of rosuvastatin on LDL-C lowering.",

While statin therapy reduces CVD in these patients, residual risk remains high. Fenofibrate corrects atherogenic dyslipidaemia, but it is unclear whether adding fenofibrate to statin therapy lowers CVD risk. We investigated whether fenofibrate improves endothelial dysfunction in statin-treated Type 2 diabetic patients. In a cross-over study, 15 statin-treated Type 2 diabetic patients, with LDL (low-density lipoprotein)-cholesterol <2.6 mmol/l and endothelial dysfunction [brachial artery FMD (flow-mediated dilatation) <6.0%] were randomized, double-blind, to fenofibrate 145 mg/day or matching placebo for 12 weeks, with 4 weeks washout between treatment periods. Brachial artery FMD and endothelium-independent NMD (nitrate-mediated dilatation) were measured by ultrasonography at the start and end of each treatment period. PIFBF (post-ischaemic forearm blood flow), a measure of microcirculatory endothelial function, and serum lipids, lipoproteins and apo (apolipoprotein) concentrations were also measured. Compared with placebo, fenofibrate increased FMD (mean absolute 2.1+/-0.6 compared with -0.3+/-0.6%, P=0.04), but did not alter NMD (P=0.75). Fenofibrate also increased maximal PIFBF {median 3.5 [IQR (interquartile range) 5.8] compared with 0.3 (2.1) ml/100 ml/min, P=0.001} and flow debt repayment [median 1.0 (IQR 3.5) compared with -1.5 (3.0) ml/100 ml, P=0.01].

However, the efficacy of the non-prescription time-release niacin, Slo-Niacin\u00ae, is little studied alone and not at all with atorvastatin. We gave Slo-Niacin\u00ae and atorvastatin, singly and together to determine efficacy on the combined abnormalities of triglyceride, LDL and HDL. METHODS: 42 men and women with LDL-C>130mg/dL HDL-C <45 (men or 55mg/dL (women) were randomized to 3 months of atorvastatin 10 mg/day or incremental doses of Slo-Niacin\u00ae to 1500 mg/day. The alternate drug was added in the next 3-month segment. Lipid profiles and transaminases were measured monthly and other measures at baseline and the end of each treatment sequence. RESULTS: Mean entry lipids (mg/dL) were: TG 187, LDL-C 171, and HDL-C 39. Mean BMI was 32.6 Kg/m(2). Monotherapy with Slo-Niacin\u00ae decreased median triglyceride 15%, mean LDL-C 12% and non-HDL-C 15% and increased HDL-C 8%. Atorvastatin decreased median triglyceride 26%, and mean LDL-C 36%, non-HDL-C 36% and increased HDL-C 6%. Combined therapy decreased median triglyceride 33% and mean LDL-C and non-HDL-C each 43%. HDL-C increased 10% (all p<0.001). Median remnant-like lipoprotein-C decreased 55%, mean apo-B 40%, median hsCRP 23% (all p<0.05), TNFa 12% and no change in IL-6. Mean LDL buoyancy increased 15%, apo-A-I 5% and median HDL(2)-C 20% (all p<0.05). ALT declined with Slo-Niacin\u00ae treatment alone compared to atorvastatin and also decreased when Slo-Niacin\u00ae was added to atorvastatin. Six subjects dropped out, 3 for niacin related symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Slo-Niacin\u00ae 1.5g/day with atorvastatin 10 mg/day improved lipoprotein lipids, apoproteins and inflammation markers without hepatotoxicity. Slo-Niacin\u00ae deserves further study as a cost-effective treatment of hyperlipidemia.",

Therefore, it is important for diabetic patients to control blood fat. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl enzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins), like pravastatin, are frequently administered to diabetic patients for this purpose. Although the alterations of metabolic enzymes and transporters in the diabetic liver maybe change the disposition of pravastatin, the effect has not been fully investigated. In the present study, we investigated the disposition of pravastatin and the mRNA expression of transporters in the liver. Pravastatin (5 mg.kg(-1) body weight) was administered intravenously to diabetic rats, and the pravastatin concentrations in the plasma, urine, and bile were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. Changes in the mRNA expressions of multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) and organic anion transporting polypeptide 2 (OATP2) in the liver were also estimated using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We found that the plasma pravastatin concentration was lower in the diabetic rat because the transportation of pravastatin into hepatocytes was promoted along with increased expression of OATP2. The biliary excretion ratio of pravastatin was significantly lower in the diabetic rat because the pravastatin transportation into bile was reduced along with the decreased expression of MRP2. To clarify these phenomena, the analysis of mRNA expression using real-time PCR and the measurement of the amount and the activity of proteins are necessary in future study.",

Inhibition of RhoA activity by overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant of RhoA or a Rho kinase inhibitor decreased EL levels. Pitavastatin reduced phospholipase activities of endothelial cells, and concomitant treatment with mevalonate reversed its inhibitory effect. Pitavastatin reduced RhoA activity and EL expression in mouse tissues. Furthermore, plasma EL concentrations in human subjects were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Plasma EL levels were negatively associated with plasma HDL levels in 237 patients with cardiovascular diseases, and pitavastatin treatment reduced plasma EL levels and increased HDL-C levels in 48 patients with hypercholesterolaemia.",

[40]). However, in the liver, the uptake of statins would also be mediated by organic anion transporting polypeptides (Oatps) like Oatp2 a member of this family. Thus, a novel biochromatographic approach was developed in our laboratory to study the transmembrane transport of statins and an Oatp2 inhibitor via this carrier family. For this, the Oatp2 protein was immobilized via its amino groups on a chromatographic support using an \"in situ\" immobilization technique. For the first time, using this novel biochromatographic concept, the effect of magnesium chloride salt (MgCl(2)) on the pharmacomolecule-Oatp2 binding was investigated. It was shown an Mg(2+)-dependent pharmacomolecule-protein association and a potential facilitated diffusion of these pharmacomolecules into biological membrane. This association process was due to the central positive potential pore of the Oatp2. Indeed, at pH 7.4, all the pharmacomolecules studied were ionized (i.e. negatively charged) and so interact with this positive potential pore. However, an increase of the Mg(2+) concentration led a decrease of the pharmacomolecule-Oatp2 association attributed to ion pair formations between the Mg(2+) cation and molecules. Moreover, the decrease of this affinity could be explained by an ion attraction between the Cl(-) anion of the MgCl(2) salt and the positively charged pore of the protein. This novel biochromatographic column could be useful to find a specific reversible inhibitor for these transporters and so open new perspectives to be investigated.",

Statin monotherapy has shown, in different prospective trials, significant reductions in cardiovascular events and mortality. However, the residual risk in these subjects remains elevated, probably due to the incomplete control of diabetic dyslipidemia. In this review we discuss the global therapeutic approach, underlying the need of combining statins with agents that more effective in reducing triglycerides and elevating HDL cholesterol, even in subjects whose LDL cholesterol values are at target. Available data supports that such combinations contribute to normalize the lipid profile with possible beneficial effects on the cardiovascular risk.

Understanding their mechanism of action could point to new therapies, thus we investigated the response of primary cultured human airway mesenchymal cells, which play an effector role in asthma and chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD), to simvastatin exposure. Simvastatin induced apoptosis involving caspase-9, -3 and -7, but not caspase-8 in airway smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts. HMG-CoA inhibition did not alter cellular cholesterol content but did abrogate de novo cholesterol synthesis. Pro-apoptotic effects were prevented by exogenous mevalonate, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate and farnesyl pyrophosphate, downstream products of HMG-CoA. Simvastatin increased expression of Bax, oligomerization of Bax and Bak, and expression of BH3-only p53-dependent genes, PUMA and NOXA. Inhibition of p53 and silencing of p53 unregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) expression partly counteracted simvastatin-induced cell death, suggesting a role for p53-independent mechanisms. Simvastatin did not induce mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, but did promote release of inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) proteins, Smac and Omi. Simvastatin also inhibited mitochondrial fission with the loss of mitochondrial Drp1, an essential component of mitochondrial fission machinery. Thus, simvastatin activates novel apoptosis pathways in lung mesenchymal cells involving p53, IAP inhibitor release, and disruption of mitochondrial fission.",

Although statins target cholesterol biosynthesis, the beneficial effects on cardiovascular disease remain to be fully elucidated. In this work, we explored the in vitro effects of pravastatin on vascular functionality. We studied the effect of the incubation with this statin on acetylcholine relaxation using aorta from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Consistent with a cholesterol-independent mechanism of action, we show that pravastatin induces a significant improvement of endothelium-dependent relaxation that is not completely reversed by mevalonic acid. Assays with 250microM of lucigenin were carried out to verify whether such action could be mediated by the scavenger properties of pravastatin. Treatment of aortic rings derived from Wistar rats with lucigenin promotes superoxide generation (O(2)(-)) and the subsequent loss of both endothelium-dependent and independent relaxations. The addition of pravastatin reduced the lucigenin-triggered O(2)(-) levels as well as its inhibitory effects on acetylcholine- and sodium nitroprusside-dependent responses. These effects were not counteracted by mevalonic acid, further supporting the idea that the effects of pravastatin do not entail alterations in cholesterol biosynthesis. In conclusion, this study can contribute to elucidate the mechanism responsible for the antioxidant activity of pravastatin, and describes relationship between a scavenger effect of pravastatin and the improvement of vascular reactivity.",

Interestingly, the simvastatin-induced apoptosis was accompanied by p53 stabilization involving Mdm2 degradation. The apoptosis was ameliorated in p53 knockdown clones of MethA cells as well as p53(-/-) HCT116 cells. The stabilized p53 protein translocated to mitochondria with Bax, and cytochrome c was released into cytosol. Moreover, knockdown or deficiency of p53 expression reduced both Bax translocation to mitochondria and MMP disruption in simvastatin-induced apoptosis.

None of the variants identified in this review suggested novel metabolic mechanisms leading to statin myopathy.", 
    "158": "Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) are a family of lipids including some subgroups identified by the position of the last double bond in their structure. PUFA n-3 include alpha linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), while PUFA n-6 include linoleic acid (LA) and arachidonic acid (AA). Since PUFA n-3 consumption has been shown to be inversely correlated with coronary heart diseases (CHD) incidence, clinical trials have been principally conducted by administering fish oil supplements or purified PUFA n-3. The relationship between dietary PUFA n-3 and CHD is believed to be only partially mediated by their effects on plasma lipoprotein profile. PUFA n-3 have shown to reduce only slightly total and LDL cholesterol, probably as they crowd saturated fatty acids out of diet. Data on HDL cholesterol suggest that PUFA n-3 produce only a small increase in this fraction. The effect of PUFA n-3 supplementation on plasma triglycerides (TG) is much more important, with a reduction of about 25% in normolipidemic subjects and about 50% in hypertriglyceridemic patients. This effect seems to be mediated by an inhibition of hormone-sensitive lipase, and VLDL secretion, and an increase in apo B liver degradation. They also increase lipoprotein lipase activity resulting in a reduction of post-prandial TG. PUFA n-3 might be used as second line therapy, additional or alternative to fibrates and nicotinic acid, in the treatment of severe hypertriglyceridemia. Furthermore, the addition of PUFA n-3 to statin therapy might contribute to normalize TG levels in patients with combined hyperlipidemia.",

A significant amount of clinical data are available to demonstrate the positive influence that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin) therapy has on slowing the progression of cardiovascular disease and improving clinical outcomes. Achieving the treatment goals for cholesterol in cardiovascular disease continues to present challenges. Recent clinical trial information is available assessing the use of more aggressive initial doses of statin therapy based on initial low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) measurements in an attempt to reach treatment goals sooner. Six clinical trials assessed low-, moderate- and high-risk individuals as well as those with type 2 diabetes mellitus to determine if this treatment approach is both safe and effective. The studies concluded that initial dosing of statin therapy determined by a baseline LDL-C measurement demonstrates good achievement in reaching treatment goals and does not result in a higher rate of adverse effects.",

A unique property of the method is that the treatment and outcome models are combined via Bayes theorem. However, this estimation procedure can be problematic if the outcome model is misspecified. We observe feedback that can bias propensity score estimates. Building on new innovation in Bayesian computation, we propose a technique for cutting feedback in a Bayesian propensity analysis. We use the posterior distribution of the propensity scores as an input in the regression model for the outcome. The method is approximately Bayesian in the sense that it does not use the full likelihood for estimation. Nonetheless, it severs feedback between the treatment and outcome giving propensity score estimates that are free from bias but modeled with uncertainty. We illustrate the method in a matched cohort study investigating the effect of statins on primary stroke prevention.",

In some cases statin therapy alone is insufficient to achieve adequate lipid levels whereas other patients are unable to tolerate statins. This calls for additional treatment options. Niacin has a long history of success in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides, and increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. It was the first lipid-lowering drug to demonstrate a reduction in cardiovascular events, and remains the only one that has consistently shown benefits on surrogate outcomes when added to background therapies of other lipid-lowering drugs, including statins. Niacin's uptake in clinical practice has been less successful due to its side-effect profile, most notable being flushing. The uncovering of the mechanism by which flushing is induced, together with the development of a prostaglandin D(2) receptor inhibitor (laropiprant) which reduces this downstream flushing effect of niacin, has sparked new promise in therapeutic lipid management. It provides an additional treatment option into managing lipid abnormalities. The uptake in clinical practice of the niacin-laropiprant combination will depend on the relative improvements experienced by the patient in the side-effect profile compared to other treatment options, as well as on the the keenly-awaited outcome studies currently underway. Until these data become available guidelines and recommendations are unlikely to change and niacin's position in therapeutic cardiovascular risk prevention will be determined by clinician opinion and experience, and patient preferences.", 
    "183": "Scientific investigation of the relationship between atherosclerosis, inflammation, and lipoprotein metabolism originated in the mid-19(th) century and has increased exponentially over the past 50 years. Basic research that characterized the lipoproteins and their metabolism was followed by clinical and epidemiologic studies that began to link elevated levels of cholesterol in the blood to the development of atherosclerosis and increased risk for cardiovascular disease. The link between elevated serum cholesterol levels and cardiovascular disease, known as the \"lipid hypothesis,\" was confirmed with the discoveries of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and of the statins. Subsequent results of multiple clinical trials, particularly with statins, have established that reductions in LDL cholesterol are associated with reduced risk for coronary heart disease (CHD). A growing body of evidence suggests that measures of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), may enhance cardiovascular risk assessment and help guide clinical decision-making. Reductions in CRP in individuals with low serum levels of LDL cholesterol have been shown to reduce cardiovascular events. A variety of agents designed to further reduce LDL cholesterol, increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and target inflammation are currently in development. Future research can help clarify the roles of emerging biomarkers and lipid fractions other than LDL cholesterol in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cardiovascular disease.",

    "185": "Background and Aims. An arterial blood supply and phenotypic changes of the sinusoids characterise the liver vasculature in human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We investigated the effects of rosuvastatin on liver vessel anomalies, tumour growth and survival in HCC. Methods. We treated transgenic mice developing HCC, characterized by vessel anomalies similar to those of human HCC, with rosuvastatin. Results. In the rosuvastatin group, the survival time was longer (P < .001), and liver weight (P < .01) and nodule surface (P < .01) were reduced. Rosuvastatin decreased the number of smooth muscle actin-positive arteries (P < .05) and prevented the sinusoid anomalies, with decreased laminin expression (P < .001), activated hepatic stellate cells (P < .001), and active Notch4 expression. Furthermore, rosuvastatin inhibited endothelial cell but not tumour hepatocyte functions. Conclusions. Rosuvastatin reduced the vessel anomalies and tumour growth and prolonged survival in HCC. These results represent new mechanisms of the effects of statin on tumour angiogenesis and a potential target therapy in HCC."
