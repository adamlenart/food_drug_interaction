    "0": "About half of all patients with heart failure (HF) have preserved left ventricular systolic function. Statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and beta blockers have been shown to improve survival in patients with HF and low ejection fraction. However, no large national study has investigated these agents in patients with HF and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction. We evaluated a nationwide sample of 13,533 eligible Medicare beneficiaries aged >or=65 years who were hospitalized with a primary discharge diagnosis of HF and had chart documentation of preserved left ventricular ejection fraction between April 1998 and March 1999 or between July 2000 and June 2001. In Cox proportional hazard model accounting for demographic profile, clinical characteristics, treatments, physician specialty, and hospital characteristics, discharge statin therapy was associated with significant improvements in 1- and 3-year mortality (RR 0.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.61 to 0.78; RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.79, respectively). Irrespective of total cholesterol level or coronary artery disease status, diabetes, hypertension, and age, statin therapy was associated with significant differences in mortality rates. Similarly, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors were associated with better survival at 1 year (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.95) and 3 years (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.89 to 0.98). Beta-blocker therapy was associated with a nonsignificant trend at 1 year (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.10) and significant survival benefits at 3 years (RR 0.92%, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.97). In conclusion, our data demonstrate that statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and beta blockers are associated with better short- and long-term survival in patients >or=65 years with HF and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction.", 
    "1": "The present study was undertaken to assess the effect of statins on collagen type I degradation and C-reactive protein in patients with coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation. One hundred six patients with coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation were studied: 40 (36 men, mean age 72 +/- 8 years) treated with a statin and 66 (48 men, mean age 74 +/- 9 years) not treated with a statin. Serum concentrations of carboxy-terminal telopeptide of collagen type I, an index of collagen type I degradation, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein were measured in all patients. Carboxy-terminal telopeptide of collagen type I levels were significantly higher (p <0.001) in statin-treated patients (0.64 ng/ml, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.57 to 0.71) compared with nonstatin-treated patients (0.38 ng/ml, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.44). These changes were independent of cholesterol levels (before or after therapy). Statin-treated patients had significantly lower (p <0.001) C-reactive protein levels (0.25 mg/dl, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.28) compared to statin nonusers (1.1 mg/dl, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.25). In conclusion, this study suggests that therapy with statins in patients with coronary artery disease and atrial fibrillation is associated with an increase in collagen degradation and an attenuation of inflammation, independently of cholesterol lowering.",

This study sought to evaluate the impact of statin pretreatment in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) on level of systemic inflammation and myocardial perfusion. A total of 253 consecutive patients undergoing primary angioplasty on a native vessel within 12 hours of AMI were divided into a group with statin pretreatment (n = 86) and control patients (n = 167). Angiographic myocardial blush grade (MBG) after revascularization of the infarct-related artery was determined to evaluate myocardial perfusion. Statin pretreatment was associated with a lower frequency of increased C-reactive protein (>or=5 mg/L) on admission compared with the control group (48% vs 64%; p = 0.019). The frequency of normal perfusion (MBG 3) was higher in the statin-pretreatment group than the control group (45% vs 26%, respectively; p <0.001). Statin pretreatment was an independent predictor of normal myocardial perfusion (MBG 3; odds ratio 2.53, 95% confidence interval 1.15 to 9.53, p = 0.022) in addition to age <or=70 years and C-reactive protein <5 mg/L.

    "7": "Statins are widely used to treat hypercholesterolemia, but they are associated with muscle-related adverse events, by as yet, inadequately resolved mechanisms. In this study, we report that statins induced autophagy in cultured human rhabdomyosarcoma A204 cells. Potency differed widely among the statins: cerivastatin induced autophagy at 0.1muM, simvastatin at 10muM but none was induced by pravastatin. Addition of mevalonate, but not cholesterol, blocked induction of autophagy by cerivastatin, suggesting that this induction is dependent on modulation of isoprenoid metabolic pathways. The statin-induced autophagy was not observed in other types of cells, such as human hepatoma HepG2 or embryonic kidney HEK293 cells. Muscle-specific abortive induction of autophagy by hydrophobic statins is a possible mechanism for statin-induced muscle-related side effects.",

In a cohort study, 1693 consecutive patients > or =65 years undergoing major non-cardiac vascular surgery were preoperatively screened for cardiac risk factors and medication. During follow-up (median: 8.2 years), mortality was noted. Hospital mortality occurred in 8.1% and long-term mortality in 28.5%. In multivariate analysis, age, coronary artery disease, heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, renal failure and diabetes were significantly associated with increased hospital and long-term mortality. Perioperative aspirin (OR: 0.53, 95% confidence interval: 0.34-0.83), beta-blockers (OR: 0.32, 95% CI: 0.19-0.54) and statins (OR: 0.35, 95% CI: 0.18-0.68) were significantly associated with reduced hospital mortality.

Heterogeneity tests revealed a gradient decrease of mortality risk in patients from low to high age using statins (p=0.03). In conclusion, age is an independent predictor of hospital and long-term mortality in elderly patients undergoing major vascular surgery. Aspirin, ACE-inhibitors, beta-blockers and statins reduce long-term mortality risk. Especially the very elderly may benefit from statin therapy.", 
    "9": "1. Free radical-induced lipid peroxidation and changes in protein and nucleic acid structures can result in various human ailments, including ageing, neurodegenerative disorders and cancer. High body fat or dietary fat further enhances the free radical-mediated pathogenesis of various diseases. 2. In the present study, the in vitro anti-oxidant and DNA protective effects of the novel cardiovascular drug rosuvastatin were evaluated. Anti-oxidant activity was evaluated on the basis of inhibition of lipid peroxidation, scavenging of superoxide radical and the reduction of ferric ions (Fe(3+)). Inhibition of lipid peroxidation was determined using Fenton's reaction-induced lipid peroxidation in rat liver and brain homogenates and liver mitochondria. Superoxide radical-scavenging activity was evaluated by scavenging of the superoxide anion generated by photo illumination of riboflavin and Fe(3+)-reducing activity was determined by the ferric-reducing anti-oxidant power (FRAP) assay. DNA protection was evaluated according to changes in H(2)O(2)-induced pBR322 plasmid DNA and Fenton's reaction-induced-fragmentation of rat liver DNA. 3. The results indicate that rosuvastatin (1.5 or 2 mg/mL) is able to protect against lipid peroxidation. Furthermore, H(2)O(2)-induced changes in pBR322 plasmid DNA and fragmentation of hepatic DNA were alleviated by rosuvastatin. However, rosuvastatin did not show any superoxide anion-scavenging activity. The protective mechanism of rosuvastatin can be correlated with the reducing equivalent donating property or direct hydroxyl radical-scavenging activity of the drug. 4. The pleiotropic activities of rosuvastatin exhibited suggest its clinical advantages against oxidative stress-induced human ailments in addition to its widely using hypolipidaemic effect.",

However, the effects of statins in head and neck carcinoma have not been reported. In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which fluvastatin induces apoptosis in HSC-3 cells. An increase in caspase-3 activity was observed. The apoptosis induced by fluvastatin was inhibited by the addition of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) to the cell culture. When we examined the survival signals at the time of apoptotic induction, we also found that fluvastatin had caused a remarkable decrease in the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2. Moreover, we also found that U0126, a MEK1/2 inhibitor, induces apoptosis in HSC-3 cells. These results suggested that fluvastatin induces apoptosis by inhibiting GGPP biosynthesis and consequently decreasing the level of phosphorylated ERK1/2. The results of this study also indicate that fluvastatin may be used as an anticancer agent for tongue carcinoma.", 
    "19": "Various mechanisms can influence the intestinal absorption and oral bioavailability of drugs. The barrier effects of efflux transporters may be one of the critical factors limiting the bioavailability of certain drugs. It has been reported that multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (Mrp2) is expressed in the mucosal membrane of the epithelium of the small intestine and secretes various drugs into the jejunum lumen. However, it is possible that total intestinal secretion of Mrp2 substrates is accounted for the contribution of Mrp2 and other transporter(s) to the intestinal secretion of Mrp2 substrates. In this study, we found that phenolsulfonphthalein and pravastatin, both Mrp2 substrates, are transported by different transport systems in the intestine. These results suggest that contribution of transporters to the drug transport may be a critical factor affecting drug disposition and drug-drug interaction. In addition to evaluating the substrate specificity of a transporter, it is important to be aware of the contribution of a transporter to drug disposition.",

There does, however, appear to be a positive relationship between total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and the risk of ischemic stroke, with an inverse relationship between cholesterol levels and hemorrhagic stroke. Treatment with statins is associated with the reduction in the risk of a first stroke in various populations of patients at increased risk of cardiovascular events. Treatment of patients with prior cerebrovascular disease is associated with a reduction in major cardiovascular events and, in a single study, with a reduction in fatal and nonfatal stroke in patients with prior stroke or transient ischemic attack and no known coronary heart disease. Whether the benefit of statins in reducing the risk of stroke is due to their potent lipid-lowering effects, pleiotropic effects, or a combination of the two cannot be determined based on data available from clinical trials.",

After a stroke or transient ischemic attack due to IAS, patients face a 12% annual risk of recurrent stroke on medical therapy, with most strokes occurring in the first year. Warfarin has been shown to be no better than aspirin in preventing recurrent strokes but poses a higher risk of serious bleeding and death. Groups with the highest risk of recurrent stroke are those with high-grade (> or = 70%) stenosis, those with recent symptom onset, and women. Endovascular treatment of IAS is a rapidly evolving therapeutic option. Antiplatelet agents are currently recommended as the primary treatment for symptomatic IAS, with endovascular therapy reserved for appropriate high-risk cases refractory to medical therapy.", 
    "62": "There is considerable disparity between the major clinical guidelines on lipid targets in diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Over the past few years, several trials have reported results that contribute to the evidence base for such lipid targets. The Treat to New Targets study data provide support for the efficacy and safety of using high-dose statin therapy for reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) to at least 2 mmol/L in patients with diabetes and established cardiovascular disease (CVD). The Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study and the Heart Protection Study provide support for the efficacy and safety of lowering LDL-C to at least 2 mmol/L with lower doses of statins. Once these LDL-C targets have been reached, it is unknown whether targeting high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides is more efficacious than further lowering of LDL-C. The optimal treatment strategy, therefore, is unclear. Trials are underway to resolve this question. Patients with metabolic syndrome derive similar relative reduction in CVD from statin therapy as those without, and the appropriate treatment and targets depend on the estimated CVD risk. Prediction of CVD risk with currently available risk scores is imperfect but there is little evidence that including metabolic syndrome improves risk prediction beyond Framingham Risk Score mainly because the latter already includes blood pressure and HDL-C.", 
    "63": "Cardiovascular risk factors, particularly low-density lipoproteins (LDL), give rise to atherosclerosis and its complications by triggering a dysfunctional endothelium, inflammation, and a procoagulant vascular surface. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibition by statins leads to a fall in circulating and plaque LDL concentrations and improvement in many cellular dysfunctions, but controlled trials only show partial benefit with regard to myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular death. Emerging clinical evidence now shows that these risk factors also stimulate the activation (isoprenylation) of small G-binding proteins and, through their effectors (Rho-associated kinase) they can activate many or most of the subcellular and vessel wall pathophysiology of atherosclerosis. Inhibition of Rho-kinase can improve these dysfunctions with no changes in LDL. Similarly, statins can diminish the activation of these small G-binding proteins and their downstream effectors in atherosclerosis. This review compares and contrasts the effects of statins on atherosclerosis that are related to changes in LDL with those effects occurring through these alternate lipid pathways, and suggests that the therapeutic control of these small G-binding proteins and their downstream effectors may significantly add to the partial benefits of using statins in patients with atherosclerotic heart disease.", 
    "64": "Atherosclerotic narrowing of the proximal internal carotid artery is an important mechanism in ischemic stroke. Optimal medical management of internal carotid stenosis includes antiplatelet agent and statin administration, blood pressure reduction, weight control, and smoking cessation. Decisions regarding the use of invasive procedures to treat carotid disease--specifically carotid endarterectomy and carotid angioplasty and stenting--must weigh the long-term risk reduction in ipsilateral ischemic stroke against the immediate intervention risks. Clinical trials evaluating the benefits of carotid endarterectomy were conducted before widespread use of statins and newer blood pressure-lowering agents such as angiotensin-receptor blockers; it is unclear what impact this may have had on trial results. Regardless, carotid endarterectomy is clearly superior to medical therapy for patients with symptomatic severe stenosis. Conversely, the benefit from endarterectomy is muted in individuals with symptomatic moderate stenosis or asymptomatic stenosis, and decisions regarding surgical intervention must incorporate surgeon proficiency and patient comorbidity. Currently, there is a lack of evidence to support the use of carotid artery angioplasty and stenting in the routine management of carotid disease. Selected patients with severe symptomatic stenosis for whom endarterectomy cannot be safely performed may still benefit from endovascular management. However, it is unlikely that asymptomatic patients or symptomatic patients with moderate stenosis considered at high risk for endarterectomy would benefit from any intervention.",

In our study, we investigated the combinational effects of atorvastatin and celecoxib in 2 human colon cancer cell lines HCT116 and HT29. Celecoxib moderately inhibited the growth of both cell lines with a similar IC(50) of 40-50 microM, whereas atorvastatin showed stronger growth inhibitory effect in HCT116 cells than in HT29 cells (IC(50) of 5-8 microM vs. 30-35 microM) after treatment for 48-72 hr. The combination of these 2 agents produced strong synergistic actions, as determined by isobologram analysis. Flow cytometry analysis indicated that the combination treatment for 24 hr caused extensive cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase; whereas at 48 hr or longer, apoptosis was induced significantly. The effects produced by the combination were much stronger than that by atorvastatin or celecoxib alone. Our results further demonstrated that the combinational effects of atorvastatin/celecoxib were associated with increased levels of p21(Cip1/Waf1), p27(Kip1), and phospho-JNK; decreased levels of phospho-AKT and hyper-phosphorylated Rb; and activation of caspase cascade. Atorvastatin/celecoxib combination also selectively modified membrane localization of small G-proteins, such as RhoA, RhoB and RhoC, which may contribute to the anti-cancer effects. Taken together, the results demonstrated a strong synergy between the actions of atorvastatin and celecoxib in growth inhibition and killing of human colon cancer cells. The present work suggests the possible therapeutic application of this combination and provides leads for mechanistic and biomarker investigations in clinical trials.", 
    "74": "Concerns have been raised because of observations of proteinuria associated with rosuvastatin treatment. In this open-label study, a potential dose-dependent effect was investigated of rosuvastatin on urinary protein excretion and renal function parameters in 90 hyperlipidemic patients randomly assigned to rosuvastatin 10 mg/day (n = 45) or 20 mg/day (n = 45). Urinary samples were collected from patients and 40 age- and gender-matched controls to determine electrolyte, uric acid, creatinine, and protein (total, albumin, IgG, and alpha1-microglobulin) levels at baseline and after 12 weeks. A dose-dependent increase in the excretion of alpha1-microglobulin (17.6% in rosuvastatin 10 vs 34.9% in rosuvastatin, 20 mg/day; P = .03 for the comparison between groups) was observed. A trend toward an increase in the estimated glomerular filtration rate was noted in only patients receiving 20 mg/day of rosuvastatin. These findings indicate that rosuvastatin treatment increases the urinary excretion of alpha1-microglobulin urinary excretion in a dose-dependent manner without adversely affecting renal function.", 
    "75": "Activation of reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase by angiotensin II is integral to the formation of oxidative stress in the vasculature and the kidney. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibition is associated with reductions of oxidative stress in the vasculature and kidney and associated decreases in albuminuria. Effects of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibition on oxidative stress in the kidney and filtration barrier integrity are poorly understood. To investigate, we used transgenic TG(mRen2)27 (Ren2) rats, which harbor the mouse renin transgene and renin-angiotensin system activation, and an immortalized murine podocyte cell line. We treated young, male Ren2 and Sprague-Dawley rats with rosuvastatin (20 mg/kg IP) or placebo for 21 days. Compared with controls, we observed increases in systolic blood pressure, albuminuria, renal NADPH oxidase activity, and 3-nitrotryosine staining, with reductions in the rosuvastatin-treated Ren2. Structural changes on light and transmission electron microscopy, consistent with periarteriolar fibrosis and podocyte foot-process effacement, were attenuated with statin treatment. Nephrin expression was diminished in the Ren2 kidney and trended to normalize with statin treatment. Angiotensin II-dependent increases in podocyte NADPH oxidase activity and subunit expression (NOX2, NOX4, Rac, and p22(phox)) and reactive oxygen species generation were decreased after in vitro statin treatment. These data support a role for increased NADPH oxidase activity and subunit expression with resultant reactive oxygen species formation in the kidney and podocyte. Furthermore, statin attenuation of NADPH oxidase activation and reactive oxygen species formation in the kidney/podocyte seems to play roles in the abrogation of oxidative stress-induced filtration barrier injury and consequent albuminuria.",

In atrial myocytes, activation of STAT3 by Rac1 was mediated by direct association of Rac1 with STAT3; however, in atrial fibroblasts, it was mediated by an indirect paracrine effect. Constitutively active STAT3 increased protein synthesis, and dominant-negative STAT3 abrogated Ang II-induced protein synthesis in atrial myocytes and fibroblasts. Rats infused long term with Ang II exhibited higher levels of activated Rac1, phospho-STAT3, collagen synthesis, and atrial fibrosis in the atria, all of which were attenuated by oral losartan and simvastatin.

PDTC dose-dependently inhibited the acceleration of expression of MCP-1 mRNA and protein in the PMCs induced by high concentration glucose (P < 0.05 or P < 0.01).

Besides normal concentrations of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, dyslipidemia is very common and includes elevated triglyceride levels and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. Recent findings also showed that women with PCOS have qualitative LDL alterations, with increased levels of atherogenic small, dense LDL particles. Such lipid abnormalities constitute a common form of dyslipidemia, the so-called atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype (ALP), associated with a greater cardiovascular risk. Weight reduction and increased physical activity may constitute first-line therapy for ALP in PCOS, and lipid lowering drugs, particularly nicotinic acid and fibrates, should be used in patients with severe dyslipidemia. Statins have usually a lower impact on ALP, and their beneficial effect is often moderate. Insulin-sensitizing medications favorably alter each component of ALP and combined therapy with these agents remains an option; in particular, the combination pioglitazone plus metformin seems to be particularly beneficial.",

Male Syrian Golden hamsters were fed a high-fat diet containing 0.025% fenofibrate or 0.025% resveratrol for 8 weeks. The concentrations of serum total cholesterol and triglyceride were significantly lower in the resveratrol-fed group than in the control group. The resveratrol contained diet significantly decreased Apo B, Lp(a), and cholesterol-ester-transport protein (CETP) concentrations, but increased Apo A-I levels and the Apo A-I/Apo B ratio. The contents of cholesterol and triglyceride in hepatic tissue were significantly lower in the resveratrol group than in the control group. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that HMGR mRNA expression was significantly lower in the resveratrol group than in the control group. These results indicate that dietary resveratrol reduces serum cholesterol by down-regulating hepatic HMGR mRNA expression in hamsters fed a high-fat diet.", 
    "88": "There has been a fascinating interplay between the discovery of some of the key enzymes, receptors and transporters in cholesterol biosynthesis and transfer and the development of drugs for the regulation of cholesterol metabolism. The discovery of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor led to the realization that circulating LDL cholesterol could be decreased when hepatic LDL receptor expression was stimulated by decreasing intrahepatic cholesterol levels. The first class of drugs which operate in this way were the bile-acid sequestrating agents, which, by interrupting the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids, deplete the liver of cholesterol used to replenish the pool of bile salts. Ezetimibe, which was developed to block cholesterol absorption from the intestine, led to the discovery of the Nieman-Pick C1-Like 1 sterol transporter channel. The statins, which have proved enormously successful in preventing cardiovascular disease, were discovered amongst fungal metabolites which inhibit hydroxyl methyl CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme for hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis. Drugs which block enzymes at other stages of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, particularly the squalene synthase inhibitors, are entering the clinical phase of their development. Drugs which interfere with hepatic very low-density lipoprotein assembly in the liver, such as microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitors and apolipoprotein B mRNA antisense oligonucleotides, are currently undergoing evaluation. Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors, which decrease cholesteryl ester heteroexchange within the circulation, have undergone development to the point of clinical evaluation, and this will eventually settle the controversy about whether CETP is pro- or antiatherogenic.",

Whether statins promote the development of nasal polyps has so far been uncertain. No studies have evaluated the frequency of the development of nasal polyps in patients using statins. To better define the relationship of statin use to the presence of nasal polyps, the investigators explored the frequency of the development of nasal polyps in patients who were using statins. A total of 200 patients who were using statins and 200 who were not using statins (400 cases) were investigated. All patients were examined for nasal polyps by anterior rhinoscopy or investigation with a fiberoptic endoscope. In addition, immunoglobulin E levels were measured, a skin prick test was performed, and the results from the 2 groups were compared. Nasal polyps were detected in 4 subjects who were using statins, whereas 5 nasal polyps were found in the control group; differences between the 2 groups were statistically insignificant (P>.05). When the atopy status of the 2 groups was compared, prick test positivity and serum immunoglobulin E levels were found to be 15% and 44+/-31 IU/mL in the statin group and 19% and 68+/-23 IU/mL in the control group (P>.05). These results show that nasal polyposis is a multifactorial disease with several different causes; however, the frequency of the development of nasal polyps does not increase in patients who use statins.",

    "91": "A recent report of an inverse relationship between achieved low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and cancer incidence has refueled the debate on cholesterol lowering and cancer. This is timely, since aggressive cholesterol lowering with statins is the trend. There are data suggesting that cholesterol lowering increases cancer at the expense of decreasing cardiovascular disease in certain populations, such as the elderly and those treated with immunotherapy for cancer. Furthermore, there may be a relationship between statin dose and cancer. Future statin trials should accurately tract the incidence of new cancers over extended time periods. These issues deserve our attention.", 
    "92": "Our previous studies have shown vascular dysfunction in small coronary and mesenteric arteries in Zucker obese rats, a model of the metabolic syndrome, and Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats, a model of type 2 diabetes. Because of their lipid lowering action and antioxidant activity, we predicted that treatment with Rosuvastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) or Enalapril, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor would improve vascular dysfunction associated with the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes.", 
    "93": "20-week-old Zucker obese and 16-week-old ZDF rats were treated with Rosuvastatin (25 mg/kg/day) or Enalapril (20 mg/kg/day) for 12 weeks. We examined metabolic parameters, indices of oxidative stress and vascular dysfunction in ventricular and mesenteric small arteries (75-175 microm intraluminal diameter) from lean, Zucker obese and ZDF rats (untreated and treated).", 
    "94": "Endothelial dependent responses were attenuated in coronary vessels from Zucker obese and ZDF rats compared to responses from lean rats. Both drugs improved metabolic parameters, oxidative stress, and vascular dysfunction in Zucker obese rats, however, only partial improvement was observed in ZDF rats, suggesting more aggressive treatment is needed when hyperglycemia is involved.",

    "96": "Pravastatin is reported to increase the adiponectin level in humans, but the mechanism remains unclear. We examined plasma and gene expressions of adiponectin, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-*, interleukin (IL)-6 and protein carbonyl level, an indicator of oxidative stress, in visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue from 32 patients with coronary artery disease undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Fourteen patients with serum LDL-cholesterol level >100mg/dl were treated with pravastatin at 10mg/day for 2 months before CABG (Statin), and the other 18 with LDL-cholesterol <or=100mg/dl were not (Control). The plasma adiponectin level was higher in the Statin than the Control group (P<0.05), but TNF-* and IL-6 levels were not different. Adiponectin gene expression in visceral tissue was 3-fold higher in the Statin than the Control group (P<0.01), but was not different in subcutaneous tissue. TNF-* and IL-6 gene expressions in each tissue were not different between the 2 groups. Protein carbonyl levels in plasma and visceral tissue were lower in the Statin than the Control group (both, P<0.05). Thus, adiponectin expression and generation in visceral adipose tissue is increased in men with coronary artery disease treated with pravastatin. Pravastatin-initiated attenuation of oxidative stress could be involved.", 
    "97": "Statins improve the endothelial function in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). However, they contribute to the substantial decrease in coronary heart disease by reducing plasma cholesterol levels. They also, reduce oxidative stress, stabilize the atherosclerotic plaque and inhibit inflammatory response. These functions of statins have been briefly described as pleiotropic effects. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effect of atorvastatin therapy on endothelial functions in patients with CAD.",

If the target cholesterol levels has not been achieved 6 weeks after the treatment, then the daily atorvastatin dosage has been increased. The endothelial function was evaluated by flow mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery.", 
    "99": "It has been figured out that 12 weeks later, atorvastatin caused a statistically significant decrease in the plasma levels of LDL-cholesterol and total cholesterol (p < 0,0001). Meanwhile, it was determined that the FMD got statistically significant improved 12 weeks after the atorvastatin therapy (8,1%-4,2%, p < 0,001). However there was no statistically significant change in non-endothelium dependent dilatation (NID).",

    "101": "3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase inhibitors (the so-called statins: atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pravastatin, lovastatin, rosuvastatin and simvastatin) are a well-established class of drugs in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Statin monotherapy is generally well tolerated, with a low frequency of adverse events. The most important adverse effects associated with statins are myopathy and an asymptomatic increase in hepatic transaminases, both of which occur infrequently. Since statins are prescribed on a long-term basis, possible interactions with other drugs deserve particular attention, as many patients will typically receive pharmacological therapy for concomitant conditions during the course of statin treatment. Moreover, a combination of therapy between statins and other classes of lipid-lowering agents (e.g., ezetimibe, fibrates, resins and nicotinic acid) is recommended for some patients by current guidelines. Therefore, the potential for drug-drug interactions emerges as a relevant factor in determining the safety profile of statins. This review summarizes the pharmacokinetic properties of statins and emphasizes their clinically relevant drug interactions.",

    "103": "We obtained prescription claims data for statins from the BC Ministry of Health for the period Jan. 1, 1996, to Dec. 31, 2006. We estimated the number of tablets per day, based on the ratio of the number of tablets to days-supply in each prescription, to estimate the frequency with which splitting occurred with each statin. We used multivariable logistic regression to assess patient and physician characteristics and the level of public drug plan coverage associated with tablet splitting. To estimate related cost savings, we used information on drug costs and quantities of dispensed statins reported by pharmacies.", 
    "104": "During the 11-year study period, we estimated that tablet splitting occurred in 2.6% of 7.2 million statin prescriptions. There was an increasing trend in the practice over time, to 4.5% of prescriptions in 2006. Lovastatin was the only scored tablet and was the most likely to be split, followed by rosuvastatin and atorvastatin. Fifty percent of the prescriptions in which tablet splitting occurred were prescribed by only 7.9% of the routine statin prescribers (i.e., >\u00a010 statin prescriptions over the study period). Specialists were less likely than general practitioners to prescribe statins that were subsequently split (odds ratio [OR] 0.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.40-0.46). Statin prescriptions that were fully covered by the public drug plan were half as likely as those with no such coverage to involve tablet splitting (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.44-0.92). Having no public drug coverage, having a low annual household income and being female were patient factors found to be positively associated with tablet splitting. In 2006, the cost savings associated with tablet splitting was $2.3 million.", 
    "105": "The frequency of tablet splitting in statin prescriptions in British Columbia was low but increased over time. It varied between patients, physicians and different levels of insurance coverage. In the final study year, 94.5% of the statin prescriptions were dispensed at strengths for which a tablet of twice the strength was available and could have been split, which suggests a potentially enormous cost savings.",

    "107": "Clopidogrel therapy is the standard for prevention of cardiovascular thrombotic events. Clopidogrel is converted to an active thiol by the cytochrome P450 CYP 3A4 and 2C19 enzymes. Recent studies suggest that statins metabolized by CYP3A4 attenuate the anti-aggregatory effect of clopidogrel. We evaluated the effect of CYP3A4-metabolized statins (atorvastatin, group 1) and partially-CYP3A4-metabolized statins (simvastatin, group 2) on platelet aggregation inhibition (PAI) when given concomitantly with clopidogrel as compared to patients who were statin naive (group 3). PAI was measured by PlateletWorks (Helena Laboratories ICHOR) using the platelet P2Y12 receptor agonist ADP (20 micromol). All patients were on clopidogrel therapy (75 mg/day). Non-responsiveness was defined as a PAI of < 35%. There was no statistical difference in mean PAI among groups; a higher prevalence of clopidogrel non-responders was noted in group 1 compared to group 3 (p=0.002). Multivariate analysis, adjusting for unequal presence of metabolic syndrome and hypertension, we found no statistical difference between groups. Our data suggests that statins, either fully or partially metabolized by CYP3A4, do not influence PAI when clopidogrel is used at 75 mg/day, even after adjusting for risk factors. We concluded that concomitant statins with clopidogrel therapy does not influence the effect of clopidogrel in PAI.",

Potentially modifiable risk factors for CVD include tobacco use, physical inactivity, hypertension, elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and a cluster of interrelated metabolic risk factors. Over the last several decades, efforts to prevent or treat CVD risk factors have resulted in significantly lower rates of CVD-related mortality. However, many patients never achieve adequate control of CVD risk factors even when these factors have been identified. In addition, the growing prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) threatens to undermine the improvements in CVD that have been achieved. In the United States, approximately two thirds of adults are overweight or obese, and even modest excess body weight is associated with a significantly increased risk of CVD-related mortality. Lifestyle interventions to promote weight loss reduce the risk of CVD-related illness but are difficult for patients to sustain over long periods of time. The increased incidence of obesity has also contributed to significant increases in the prevalence of other important CVD risk factors, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and type 2 DM. Pharmacologic therapies are currently available to address individual CVD risk factors, and others are being evaluated, including endocannabinoid receptor antagonists, inhibitors of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor subtypes alpha and gamma, and several agents that modulate the activity of glucagon-like peptide-1. The new agents have the potential to significantly improve several CVD risk factors with a single medication and may provide clinicians with several new strategies to reduce the long-term risk of CVD.",

    "155": "A 7-year cost model incorporated patient-level CV event rates and mortality data from the ALLIANCE study. To address the managed-care perspective, costs for clinical end points were estimated from administrative claims data for equivalent events. Direct medical costs included drugs, acute events, and a maximum of 36 months of follow-up costs. Average wholesale pricing was used for drug costs. Differences in patient copayments were incorporated and a 3 % discount factor was applied. Scenario analyses explored 3- and 5-year time frames, varying discount rates, drug costs, and copayment assumptions.",

Over 7 years, the number needed to treat to avoid a clinical end point was 11 patients. Using a realworld economic model that considered atorvastatin becoming generic in 3 years, starting patients on branded and converting them to generic atorvastatin would be a cost-saving strategy compared with current generic statin use.", 
    "157": "Intensive lipid-lowering using atorvastatin increased prescription drug costs of treating CV disease patients but reduced CV events. Medical cost offsets associated with reduced events, based on data from the ALLIANCE study, resulted in ICERs within accepted cost-effectiveness ranges comparing atorvastatin with a generic statin. Atorvastatin-based regimens produced cost savings from a managed-care perspective when the anticipated impact of the generic availability of atorvastatin was modeled.",

A significant reduction in serum levels of total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, triglycerides and mean IMT was observed in patients randomized to the simvastatin group compared to their baseline values. No correlation was demonstrated between the changes in total or LDL-cholesterol concentration and IMT in the simvastatin group. L-T4 replacement resulted in a significant reduction in IMT but serum lipid levels did not change significantly.",

Lesion protection was evident as late as 5 days after brain ischemia and was associated with functional improvements in the pole-test and wire-hanging test (2.0 mg kg(-1) dose). Neuroprotection with i.v. rosuvastatin was achieved with peak plasma concentrations <0.5 ng ml(-1) (ie, with 0.2 mg kg(-1)) and was associated with increased levels of phosphorylated Akt kinase and endothelial nitric oxide synthase in the vasculature.",

Here, we investigated whether the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor rosuvastatin can inhibit atherosclerotic lesion development with favorable effects on endothelial cells in ApoE-deficient mice. Rosuvastatin rapidly phosphorylated Akt and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in human endothelial cells. Endothelial cell death induced by serum starvation was significantly inhibited by rosuvastatin (percent cell death; 45.9+/-2.4% vs. 37.3+/-1.1%, p<0.05). Eight-week-old ApoE-deficient mice were orally administered vehicle or rosuvastatin at a dose of 20mg/kg/day for 24 weeks. There was no significant difference in cholesterol profile. Rosuvastatin preserved endothelial lining at the aortic root (CD31-positive luminal side; 63.8+/-2.8% vs. 81.7+/-3.9%, p<0.05). En face Sudan IV staining of aorta revealed that rosuvastatin significantly decreased the atherosclerotic area (21.9+/-2.9% vs. 11.9+/-1.9%, p<0.05). Lipid deposition at the atherosclerotic area was also suppressed by rosuvastatin with more stabilized morphologic features as determined by oil red O staining (3.4+/-0.4% vs. 1.7+/-0.4%, p<0.05). Our findings indicate that rosuvastatin protects endothelial cells from death with phosphorylation of Akt and eNOS. These effects may contribute, at least in part, to the anti-atherosclerotic effects of rosuvastatin.", 
    "172": "This study investigated the genotoxic potential of atorvastatin on human lymphocytes using comet assay, structural chromosome aberrations (CA) and sister-chromatid exchange (SCE) analysis. Lymphocyte cultures were treated with a single drug at a concentration of 30.21 ng/mL. For comet assay, cells exposed to atorvastatin for 24 h, 48 h and 72 h were embedded in agarose slides, lysed with alkaline lysis solution and exposed to an electric field. DNA migrated within the agarose and formed comets whose length depends on the amount of DNA damage. For analysis of structural CA, cells were grown on medium for 48 h and for SCE analysis for 72 h. Structural CA did not induce significant damage to the genome, although a higher CA frequency was observed in cells treated with atorvastatin for 3 h, 20 h and 48 h than in control samples. Results of the SCE analysis did show statistically significant differences in the mean SCE number between atorvastatin-exposed and control human lymphocytes and between different exposure times. Comet assay also showed increased DNA damage caused in atorvastatin-exposed human lymphocytes than in corresponding control cells for exposure times of 24 h, 48 h and 72 h for the tail length and for 72 h for the tail moment. Results obtained in this study point to the significance of biological indicators providing information on the primary genome damage after long-term exposure, which can help to establish drug therapeutic concentrations that do not put patients with high blood cholesterol to a greater treatment-related risk.",

An analytical method is presented for the determination of the drug from human plasma making use of the fluorescent property of the drug. The drug is extracted from plasma using ethyl acetate under neutral condition and then analyzed by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with fluorescence detection (lambda(Ex) 245 nm; lambda(Em) 420 nm). Analysis of pitavastatin was carried out on a C18 HPLC column using a gradient flow of mobile phase (0.01 mol/L monobasic potassium phosphate (pH 3.20) -acetonitrile, 63:37, v/v). Fluorescein isothiocyanate was used as internal standard. The dynamic range of assay was 3 to 50 ng/mL. The intraday precision was less than 10% and accuracy ranged from 95.2% to 112.6%. The same for interday check was less than 12% and 92.8% to 105.1%, respectively. The drug was found to be stable under the assay conditions.

    "178": "Statins provide effective secondary prevention of cardiovascular events after acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Current guidelines recommend that statins be initiated in ACS patients before hospital discharge. In this retrospective study, we investigated the influence of early compared with late in-hospital initiation of statin therapy on the clinical outcomes of ACS patients. Two hundred and ten ACS patients who had no history of statin treatment before hospitalization were enrolled. The patients were divided into early (statin treatment initiated < or = 2 days after admission) and late (statin treatment initiated > 2 days after admission and before discharge) statin groups. We examined the association between early statin use and clinical outcomes in these patients using Cox proportional hazards models. Four months after discharge, event-free survival was 85% in the early statin group and 79% in the late statin group. In multivariate analyses, Killip IV classification and abnormal renal function were independent predictors of the composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, recurrent myocardial infarction, angina requiring rehospitalization, revascularization, and stroke. Early statin treatment had no significant influence (hazard ratio: 1.11; 95% confidence interval: 0.54 to 2.25; P = 0.78) on the composite endpoint 4 months after discharge. At 12 months after discharge, early statin treatment still had no significant influence on the composite endpoint (hazard ratio: 1.53; 95% confidence interval: 0.83 to 2.81; P = 0.17). We concluded that ensuring all eligible ACS patients begin statin therapy during their hospital stay is more important than emphasizing immediate statin use after admission.",

Lipid levels were similar between LAA and SVD patients. Total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), and triglyceride:HDL ratio were significantly higher in LAA vs non-LAA, non-SVD patients. After adjustment for age, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, body mass index, and premorbid statin use, significant odds ratios (ORs) for LAA compared with all other ischemic stroke subtypes for patients in the uppermost lipid quartiles (vs lowest) were triglycerides (OR 2.69, 95% CI 1.44 to 5.02) and non-HDL (OR 2.39, 95% CI 1.40 to 4.11).

We have recently shown that mutant glucocerebrosidase variants present variable degrees of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention and undergo ER associated degradation (ERAD) in the proteasomes. The degree of ERAD is one of the factors that determine GD severity. In order to define what factors affect the ERAD process of glucocerebrosidase in GD, we focused on two brothers with GD, carrying the same mutations but presenting extremely different clinical manifestations. One is mildly affected while the other developed severe GD with nervous system complications. Our results strongly indicated that both brothers presented variable degrees of ERAD, which was more extensive in the severely affected brother. Measurement of cholesterol demonstrated high intracellular levels in cells that derived from the severely affected brother. Growing the cells in cholesterol depleted medium led to lessening in the degree of ERAD in cells that derived from the severely affected brother and thus to improvement in stabilization, maturation, lysosomal localization and activity of the mutant glucocerebrosidase variants. The same effect was achieved by treating the cells with the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor mevastatin. None of the treatments had a significant effect on glucocerebrosidase properties in normal cells or in cells that derived from the mildly affected brother, indicating that intracellular cholesterol is one of the factors that affect the ERAD process of glucocerebrosidase and may influence the severity of GD.",

Carotid endarterectomy has proven effective in preventing ipsilateral stroke, however, the studies providing the evidence were conducted before the use of statins, newer antiplatelet and antihypertensive drugs, and at a time when less emphasis was on lifestyle modification. Therefore, it is likely that, not only would all patients with carotid stenosis benefit from modern medical treatment, in addition, some patients could have similar risk reduction to that of endarterectomy, were these effective preventive drugs used systematically, as recommended, in this patient group. This article reviews the evidence that is available concerning medical therapy for patients with carotid stenosis, with special emphasis on antiplatelet and statin therapy.

In this study, we investigated the characteristics of the intestinal efflux ABC transporters in LEC rats.

We aimed to investigate how atorvastatin affects extracellular nucleotide degradation in human endothelial cells, as increased activity of this pathway would facilitate conversion of pro-inflammatory nucleotides into anti-inflammatory adenosine. Primary cultures of human endothelial cells were treated with 1 microM, 10 microM and 100 microM atorvastatin for 24 h. Enzyme assays were performed as well as intact cell studies, to evaluate capacity of cells to degrade ATP to adenosine. Atorvastatin significantly increased ATP breakdown and adenosine formation in the medium of intact cells in a dose-dependent manner. The activities of ATPase, ADPase and ecto-5'-nucleotidase (eN) in cell homogenates following Atorvastatin treatment were also increased while no change was observed in the lactate dehydrogenase activity.

However, it is unknown whether statin therapy could reduce the incidence of a second stroke in patients without evidence of heart disease. This article reviews the results of the Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels trial, a prospective, randomized, multicentered, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international trial designed to examine the effect of high-dose atorvastatin on secondary stroke prevention. Trial participants (4,731) had experienced a stroke or transient ischemic attack within 1 to 6 months before randomization into the study. Over the 5-year follow-up period, incidence of second stroke or transient ischemic attack was significantly reduced in the atorvastatin treatment group compared with the placebo group. In addition, high-dose atorvastatin therapy significantly decreased major coronary artery and other negative cardiovascular events. The reduction in incidence of secondary stroke was specific to ischemic stroke as opposed to hemorrhagic stroke. Results of the trial are clinically significant and support extension of the latest secondary stroke prevention guidelines to include statin therapy for those patients without coronary heart disease.",

    "210": "A total of 268 patients were randomized to treatment, and 222 (82.8%) completed the study (149 women, 73 men; mean age, 59 years; mean weight, 63.5 kg). At the end of the study, there was no significant difference between the pitavastatin and atorvastatin groups in the proportion of patients achieving the LDL-C goal (92.7% [102/110] vs 92.0% [103/112], respectively). In addition, there were no significant differences between groups in terms of the percent changes from baseline in LDL-C, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), or hs-CRP. Twenty-six of 136 patients (19.1%) taking pitavastatin reported 35 treatment-emergent adverse reactions; 33 of 132 patients (25.0%) taking atorvastatin reported 39 treatment-emergent adverse reactions. Elevations in creatine kinase were observed in 6 patients (4.4%) in the pitavastatin group and 7 patients (5.3%) in the atorvastatin group. There were no serious adverse drug reactions in either group.", 
    "211": "In these adult Korean patients with hypercholesterolemia, pitavastatin and atorvastatin did not differ significantly in terms of the proportions of patients achieving the LDL-C goal; reductions in LDL-C, total cholesterol, and triglycerides; or increases in HDL-C. Both drugs were well tolerated.", 
    "212": "Previous research has documented an increase in metabolic syndrome among patients who use androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). Given that metabolic syndrome is related to diabetes, this research examined whether use of ADT was associated with an increase in the incidence of diabetes.", 
    "213": "A retrospective, claims database was used to compare men diagnosed with prostate cancer who received ADT (N = 1231) with men diagnosed with prostate cancer who did not receive ADT (N = 7250). Unjustified comparisons among the cohorts were examined using chi-square statistics for categorical variables and t-statistics for continuous variables. A multivariate logistic regression was estimated to examine the association between receipt of ADT and the incidence of diabetes, while controlling for a wide range of factors that also potentially affect the probability of being newly diagnosed with diabetes.", 
    "214": "Descriptive statistics revealed that the patients who initiated ADT were significantly older (P <0.01), in poorer health (P <0.01), and more likely to have a prior diagnosis of hypertension (P = 0.04). Results from the multivariate regression indicate that for men diagnosed with prostate cancer, demographic characteristics, comorbid conditions, prior statin use, and receipt of ADT all affect the probability of incident diabetes. While controlling for other factors, the estimated relative risk of incident diabetes associated with the receipt of ADT was 1.36 (P = 0.01).", 
    "215": "Results from this study suggest that among prostate cancer patients, those initiating ADT are more likely to develop incident diabetes within 1 year. This finding supports previous research that established the relationship between ADT and metabolic syndrome.", 
    "216": "Pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) was associated with atherosclerotic plaque vulnerability, whereas statin therapy was associated with increased plaque stability. Eighty-six patients presenting with clinical indications (non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction, unstable angina, and stable angina) for invasive coronary angiography and subsequent verified coronary artery disease (CAD) were randomly assigned in a double-blind manner to atorvastatin 10 or 80 mg/day. PAPP-A, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and lipids were measured at baseline (before statin therapy) and at 1 and 6 months. PAPP-A was significantly increased in 35 patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) compared with 51 patients with stable CAD (p <0.001). Patients randomly assigned to atorvastatin 10 mg did not show a significant decrease in PAPP-A from baseline at 1 or 6 months. Patients treated with atorvastatin 80 mg showed a significant decrease at 1 month compared with baseline, but not at 6 months. hs-CRP was not significantly different between the ACS and stable CAD groups. Patients receiving atorvastatin 10 mg showed no hs-CRP decrease at 1 or 6 months, whereas it significantly decreased in the 80-mg group at 6 months, but not at 1 month. In conclusion, PAPP-A significantly increased in patients with ACS compared with those with stable coronary disease. High-dose atorvastatin significantly decreased PAPP-A at 1 month and hs-CRP at 6 months in patients with verified CAD. Low-dose atorvastatin did not produce this effect.", 
    "217": "Cementless fixation depends on bone ingrowth for long-term success. Simvastatin as a lipid lowering agent has been demonstrated to have osteoanabolic effects. This study was designed to measure the possible effect of simvastatin on implant osseointegration. Bilateral femoral implantation of titanium cylinders was performed in 20 rabbits. Blood lipid levels were measured pre- and postoperatively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to measure the percentage of the surface of each implant in contact with bone and mechanical pull-out testing was performed. The blood lipid levels were significantly reduced in the simvastatin group. Histomorphometric examination revealed increased bone ingrowth and mechanical examination showed increased interface strength in the simvastatin group. Mechanical and histological data showed superior stability and osseous adaptation at the bone/implant interface for the simvastatin group. We conclude that simvastatin has potential as a means of enhancing bone ingrowth, which is a key factor in the longevity of cementless implants."
