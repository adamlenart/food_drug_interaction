With evidence of an ASCVD risk reduction benefit greatly outweighing the potential for adverse effects, the guideline recommends statin therapy for primary prevention in those with \u22657.5% 10-year ASCVD risk and consideration of statin therapy in those with 5% to <7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk. Subsequent meta-analyses of the statin trials support these recommendations and have additionally found a reduction in total mortality in lower-risk subjects. Additional evidence from imaging trials and epidemiologic studies suggests that initiation of statin therapy earlier in the course of ASCVD could have the potential to more effectively prevent age-related progression of atherosclerosis. Given the high levels of suboptimal risk factors in adults and the safety and availability of low-cost generic statins, a consideration of all the available evidence strongly supports earlier intervention for the primary prevention of ASCVD. In conclusion, earlier initiation of statin therapy has the potential to have a large long-term impact on the heavy burden of cardiovascular disease in the aging populations.", 
    "1": "This study aimed to study the combined effect of rosuvastatin and probucol on atherosclerosis (AS) in rats. In total, 95 male Wistar rats were divided into 5 groups: 25 in the control group (A), 25 in the model group (B), 15 in the rosuvastatin group (C), 15 in the probucol group (D), and 15 in the rosuvastatin combined probucol group (E). A high-lipid diet and vitamin D3 were administered to establish AS rat model. Groups C, D, and E received corresponding drugs. Blood lipids, oxidized low-density lipoprotein (OX-LDL), malonaldehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), adiponectin (APN), and vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin) were measured. Platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1) was detected by immune histochemistry. In groups B-E, AS rat models were successfully constructed. In groups C-E, blood lipids, OX-LDL, VE-cadherin, MDA, PECAM-1, and intimal thickness were decreased (p < 0.01), while SOD and APN were increased (p < 0.05), compared with that in group B. Furthermore, group E had lower levels of OX-LDL, MDA, and PECAM-1 but higher levels of SOD and APN and attenuated intimal thickening compared with groups C or D (p < 0.05). Administering rosuvastatin and probucol could attenuate AS lesions through modulation of oxidative stress, PECAM-1, and APN. Both drugs might help slow the progression of AS.",

    "3": "A decade ago, immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy was recognized as a distinct form of myositis. Recent evidence now suggests that immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy is not one disease, but can be divided on the basis of the presence of distinct autoantibodies recognizing either the signal recognition particle or 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. Anti-HMG-CoA reductase-positive patients can be further subdivided into those with and without statin exposure, the latter of which may be particularly refractory to immunosuppressive therapy.",

This biopsy finding occurs in various forms myositis, including the antisynthetase syndrome, scleroderma-associated myopathy, antisignal recognition particle-associated myopathy, statin-associated anti-HMG-CoA reductase-positive autoimmune myopathy, and statin-na\u00efve anti-HMG-CoA reductase-positive myopathy. Future progress in elucidating pathogenic mechanisms and defining optimal treatment strategies may depend upon recognizing these distinct forms of myositis and analyzing them as separate entities.",

The Food and Drug Administration recently published enhanced warnings for statin use, including the possible relationship between statins and cognitive impairment, especially in the elderly. Significant cognitive decline associated with statin use in elderly patients with Alzheimer's disease has also been reported recently. However, the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association blood cholesterol guidelines stated that no evidence is available supporting the conclusion that statins cause an adverse effect on cognition or risk of dementia. Because of the increasing number of elderly patients with dementia, this relationship needs to be examined. This article will review cognitive changes associated with statin use in elderly patients with dementia and offer clinical recommendations.",

    "14": "Hyperlipidemia and arterial cholesterol accumulation are primary causes of cardiovascular events. Monogenic forms of hyperlipidemia and recent genome-wide association studies indicate that genetics plays an important role. Zebrafish are a useful model for studying the genetic susceptibility to hyperlipidemia owing to conservation of many components of lipoprotein metabolism, including those related to LDL, ease of genetic manipulation, and in vivo observation of lipid transport and vascular calcification. We sought to develop a genetic model for lipid metabolism in zebrafish, capitalizing on one well-understood player in LDL cholesterol (LDL-c) transport, the LDL receptor (ldlr), and an established in vivo model of hypercholesterolemia. We report that morpholinos targeted against the gene encoding ldlr effectively suppressed its expression in embryos during the first 8 days of development. The ldlr morphants exhibited increased LDL-c levels that were exacerbated by feeding a high cholesterol diet. Increased LDL-c was ameliorated in morphants upon treatment with atorvastatin. Furthermore, we observed significant vascular and liver lipid accumulation, vascular leakage, and plaque oxidation in ldlr-deficient embryos. Finally, upon transcript analysis of several cholesterol-regulating genes, we observed changes similar to those seen in mammalian systems, suggesting that cholesterol regulation may be conserved in zebrafish. Taken together, these observations indicate conservation of ldlr function in zebrafish and demonstrate the utility of transient gene knockdown in embryos as a genetic model for hyperlipidemia.",

ICAM-1-dependent activation and monocytes adhesion was increased in mature endothelial cells. In parallel, the ability to generate microvascular networks in matrigel was decreased for endothelial progenitors. The effects of protease inhibitor treatment on nuclear shapes were reversed when cells were treated in combination with Pravastatin and Zoledronate in both mature and progenitor endothelial cells.

The cells used were non-aged as extracted from cord blood or umbilical vein, allowing one to consider that other senescence pathways were not activated and that the observed alterations were specific of prelamin A accumulation. Both mature endothelial cells and precursors were sensitive to prelamin accumulation and thus, could be used in the future as a valuable model to test different approaches aimed at specifically reversing lamin A-related cells senescence.",

Target identification by Mendelian randomization, human monoclonal antibodies, gene therapy, RNA-based targets, and atherogenic lipoproteins other than LDL cholesterol have fuelled intense development efforts that might bear fruit in the very near future.", 
    "28": "Eimeria bovis macromeront formation in bovine endothelial host cells is an energy- and nutrient-demanding process. Obligate intracellular replicating coccidians are generally considered as auxotrophic for cholesterol synthesis and scavenge cholesterol from the host cell by either enhancing the uptake of extracellular cholesterol sources or by upregulating the host cellular de novo biosynthesis. We here focused on the latter mechanism and analyzed the effects of several inhibitors targeting the host cellular mevalonate biosynthesis pathway and cholesterol processing. The following inhibitors were used: lovastatin, squalestatin, CI976 and C75 targeting HMG-CoA reductase, squalene synthase, acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase, and fatty acid synthase, respectively. In summary, all inhibitors significantly interfered with E. bovis meront formation and merozoite production in a dose-dependent manner. Dose effect responses identified lovastatin as the most effective compound, followed by CI976, C75, and squalestatin, respectively. Overall, merozoite production was inhibited by 99.6, 99.7, 84.6, and 70.2% via lovastatin (1 \u03bcM), CI976, C75, and squalestatin (all 5 \u03bcM) treatments, respectively. Concerning macromeront formation, both the rate and size of developing meronts were affected by inhibitor treatments. The effects were characterized by developmental arrest and meront degradation. In the case of CI976 treatment, we additionally observed detrimental effects on host cellular lipid droplet formation leading to meront developmental arrest irrespective of the time point of treatment onset. These analyses clearly indicate that successful E. bovis intracellular development strictly depends on the host cellular de novo biosynthesis of cholesterol and on the adequate subsequent processing thereof.", 
    "29": "Low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) have been associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease in prospective population studies and clinical trials of high-risk patients treated with a low to moderate intensity statin. As a result, therapeutic targets were developed to increase concentrations of HDL-C. Subsequently, clinical trials of high-intensity statins have not supported this previously well-established association. In trials of high-intensity statin therapy, low HDL particle concentration (HDL-P) has been associated with an increased risk of future cardiovascular events. Therefore, strategies that increase HDL-C without expanding the pool of HDL-P with its rich proteome/lipidome do not seem to be an effective strategy. In this review, we discuss potential mechanisms of action for the anti-atherogenic effect of HDL and the impact of current and emerging therapies on the functional capacity of HDL-P. Finally, we discuss emerging therapies that increase the concentration and functional properties of HDL.",

Secondly, we postulate that postoperative reduction in heart rate and catecholamine-induced tachycardia with ivabradine will correlate with a reduction in cardiovascular novel biomarkers which will reduce atrial stretch and postoperative incidence of arrhythmia. We aim to demonstrate that treatment with ivabradine and atorvastatin will cause a reduction in the incidence and magnitude of PMI, the benefit of which is derived primarily in patients with greater atherosclerotic burden as measured by higher CT coronary calcium scores.",

Subgroup analysis showed that statin pretreatment could decrease the incidence of CIN in patients with preexisting renal dysfunction or diabetes mellitus. In addition, patients on rosuvastatin had a similar reduced incidence of CIN compared to patients on atorvastatin.", 
    "37": "This updated meta-analysis demonstrated that preprocedural statin treatment could reduce the risk of CIN and the need for RRT in patients undergoing coronary angiography/percutaneous interventions. Moreover, statin therapy would be helpful in reducing the incidence of CIN in high-risk patients with preexisting renal dysfunction or diabetes mellitus. Additionally, rosuvastatin and atorvastatin had similar efficacies in preventing CIN development.", 
    "38": "The rate-limiting step in branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) disposal is catalyzed by the mitochondrial branched-chain \u03b1-ketoacid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDH). BCKDH activity is regulated mainly by a reversible dephosphorylation (activation)/phosphorylation (inactivation) cycle catalyzed by a specific phosphatase (BDP) and kinase (BDK). Current catalytic activity of BCKDH, described as BCKDH activity state, and thus also BCAAs catabolic rate depend directly on the portion of BCKDH occurring in its active dephosphorylated form. Liver BCKDH activity state alters in response to different nutritional factors. Feeding rats a low-protein diet decreases BCKDH activity. It has been previously shown that lipid lowering drugs, fibrates upregulate liver BCKDH activity and stimulate BCAAs catabolism, especially under the condition of dietary protein deprivation. Effect of statins on liver BCKDH activity has not been studied yet. The present study was aimed at investigating the in vivo effect of simvastatin on liver BCKDH activity, as well as E1, E2 and BDP and BDK mRNA levels in rats fed with either a standard (23% protein) or a low protein (8% protein) diet. For 14 days, simvastatin (80 mg/kg b wt/day) or the vehicle (0.3% methylcellulose) were administrated orally by gavage to the treated and control groups, respectively. The actual BCKDH and total BCKDH activities were assayed spectrophotometrically prior to and following incubation with lambda phosphatase, respectively. The mRNA levels of the selected genes were quantified by means of a semi-quantitative RT-PCR. In rats fed with the low protein diet simvastatin administration reversed physiological adaptation of liver BCKDH to protein restriction and increased liver BCKDH activity state by 39% (p<0.05). Changes in BCKDH activity did not correspond to any changes in mRNA levels for BCKDH catalytic and regulatory enzymes. On the contrary, in rats fed with standard diet liver BCKDH activity state did not alter substantially in response to simvastatin administration. In conclusion, the obtained results indicate that simvastatin stimulates liver BCKDH activity and BCAAs degradation in rats fed with the low protein diet, whereas it exerts no effect on BCKDH in rats fed with the standard diet. Stimulation of liver BCKDH activity can be attributed to altered phosphorylation status of the complex (increased dephosphorylation), and it is not associated with changes in mRNA levels for complex enzymes. It is conceivable that in protein malnourished rats simvastatin effect on liver BCKDH activity and BCAAs metabolism can contribute to the myotoxicity observed during treatment with this agent.", 
    "39": "The incidence of contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) is rising due to increased use of coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention. Many agents, including statins, have been evaluated in several studies for the prevention of CI-AKI. To date, there have been 14 prospective randomized studies regarding the efficacy of statins on the patient. Most of these studies and 3 recent meta-analyses have concluded that statins should be used for this purpose, even in patients with reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. However, there are also conflicting results, most likely due to marked heterogeneity of patient characteristics, dosage and administration patterns of statins, definition of CI-AKI, and different statistical analyses. In conclusion, it is uncertain whether statins should be prescribed to prevent CI-AKI in the absence of other indications.", 
    "40": "The risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis is considerably increased in statin users with end-stage renal failure (ESRF). Uremic toxins, which accumulate in patients with ESRF, exert cytotoxic effects that are mediated by various mechanisms. Therefore, accumulation of uremic toxins might increase statin-induced cytotoxicity. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of four uremic toxins-hippuric acid, 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropionate, indole-3-acetic acid, and 3-indoxyl sulfate-on statin-induced myopathy. Differentiated rhabdomyosarcoma cells were pre-treated with the uremic toxins for seven days, and then the cells were treated with pravastatin or simvastatin. Cell viability and apoptosis were assessed by viability assays and flow cytometry. Pre-treatment with uremic toxins increased statin- but not cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity (p < 0.05 vs. untreated). In addition, the pre-treatment increased statin-induced apoptosis, which is one of the cytotoxic factors (p < 0.05 vs. untreated). However, mevalonate, farnesol, and geranylgeraniol reversed the effects of uremic toxins and lowered statin-induced cytotoxicity (p < 0.05 vs. untreated). These results demonstrate that uremic toxins enhance statin-induced apoptosis and cytotoxicity. The mechanism underlying this effect might be associated with small G-protein geranylgeranylation. In conclusion, the increased severity of statin-induced rhabdomyolysis in patients with ESRF is likely due to the accumulation of uremic toxins.",

For each coronary plaque (\u226550% plaque burden that was \u22655 mm in length), we evaluated plaque characteristics and the extent of lipid-rich plaque [LRP, defined as the 4 mm long segment with the maximum lipid-core burden index (maxLCBI4 mm)] on NIRS. Among 66 patients (age 63.0 \u00b1 10.1 years; 82% statin use at baseline), 94 plaques were identified. The extent of LRP at baseline was positively correlated with IVUS plaque burden (r = 0.317, P = 0.002). A large LRP (maxLCBI4 mm \u2265500) was present only in plaques with a large plaque burden (\u226570%). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that plaque burden was the best predictor of the extent of LRP (P < 0.001). In lesions with a large plaque burden and a large amount of LRP at baseline, a reduction in LRP was seen in all lesions in patients receiving intensive statin therapy (P = 0.004) without a significant change in plaque burden.",

    "61": "Targeting the EGFR, with inhibitors such as erlotinib, represents a promising therapeutic option in advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). However, they lack significant efficacy as single agents. Recently, we identified the ability of statins to induce synergistic cytotoxicity in HNSCC cells through targeting the activation and trafficking of the EGFR. However, in a phase I trial of rosuvastatin and erlotinib, statin-induced muscle pathology limited the usefulness of this approach. To overcome these toxicity limitations, we sought to uncover other potential combinations using a 1,200 compound screen of FDA-approved drugs. We identified monensin, a coccidial antibiotic, as synergistically enhancing the cytotoxicity of erlotinib in two cell line models of HNSCC, SCC9 and SCC25. Monensin treatment mimicked the inhibitory effects of statins on EGFR activation and downstream signaling. RNA-seq analysis of monensin-treated SCC25 cells demonstrated a wide array of cholesterol and lipid synthesis genes upregulated by this treatment similar to statin treatment. However, this pattern was not recapitulated in SCC9 cells as monensin specifically induced the expression of activation of transcription factor (ATF) 3, a key regulator of statin-induced apoptosis. This differential response was also demonstrated in monensin-treated ex vivo surgical tissues in which HMG-CoA reductase expression and ATF3 were either not induced, induced singly, or both induced together in a cohort of 10 patient samples, including four HNSCC. These results suggest the potential clinical utility of combining monensin with erlotinib in patients with HNSCC.",

Fear of pain may prevent patients from carrying out exercise or diminish their motivation to return and engage in it, even though both the statins and the exercise have a proven benefit in both treatment and prevention, and a synergistic effect enhances this benefit. Prevalence of muscular pain ranges from 1-30%. Pain usually appears at the beginning of treatment, but can occur even after months and under any of the existing agents. The creatine phosphokinase (CPK) enzyme level may rise, but not necessarily. Increases to exceptional values (10 times the upper normal level) are relatively rare and rhabdomyolysis is extremely rare. The risk increases with age, co-morbidities and especially when taken concurrently with drugs that are metabolized in a similar pathway. Pain usually passes within a month after discontinuing treatment, but may persist for six months or more. Studies have examined the effect of statin therapy on the ability to perform physical activity, but results are inconsistent. The increased rise of CPK was observed under statin therapy, a tendency that increased with age. However, it was not accompanied by an increased incidence of muscle pain or rhabdomyolysis. Considering the above we recommend encouraging patients to exercise. However, patients should be instructed to report new or worsening muscular pains. Discontinuation, lowering dose or replacement should be considered when pain is suspected to be related with treatment.",

    "68": "Chlorogenic acid (CGA) is one of the most abundant polyphenols in the human diet and is suggested to be a potential antiatherosclerotic agent due to its proposed hypolipidemic, anti-inflammatory and antioxidative properties. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of CGA on atherosclerosis development in ApoE(-/-) mice and its potential mechanism. ApoE(-/-) mice were fed a cholesterol-rich diet without (control) or with CGA (200 and 400 mg/kg) or atorvastatin (4 mg/kg) for 12 weeks. During the study plasma lipid and inflammatory parameters were determined. Treatment with CGA (400 mg/kg) reduced atherosclerotic lesion area and vascular dilatation in the aortic root, comparable to atorvastatin. CGA (400 mg/kg) also significantly decreased plasma levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol as well as inflammatory markers. Supplementation with CGA or CGA metabolites-containing serum suppressed oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL)-induced lipid accumulation and stimulated cholesterol efflux from RAW264.7 cells. CGA significantly increased the mRNA levels of PPAR\u03b3, LXR\u03b1, ABCA1 and ABCG1 as well as the transcriptional activity of PPAR\u03b3. Cholesterol efflux assay showed that three major metabolites, caffeic, ferulic and gallic acids, significantly stimulated cholesterol efflux from RAW264.7 cells. These results suggest that CGA potently reduces atherosclerosis development in ApoE(-/-) mice and promotes cholesterol efflux from RAW264.7 macrophages. Caffeic, ferulic and gallic acids may be the potential active compounds accounting for the in vivo effect of CGA.", 
    "69": "Inhibition of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) lowers plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration and raises high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, suggesting it might prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD). From the outset, however, the concept has been controversial owing to uncertainty about its effects on HDL function and reverse cholesterol transport (RCT). Although there has long been good evidence that CETP inhibition reduces atherosclerosis in rabbits, the first information on CETP as a CVD risk factor in a prospectively followed cohort was not published until after the first Phase 3 trial of a CETP inhibitor had begun. The worrying finding that CVD incidence was related inversely to plasma CETP has since been reproduced in each of five further prospective cohort studies. Similar results were obtained in subjects on or off statin therapy, for first and second CVD events, and for mortality as well as CVD morbidity. Additionally, two recent studies have found alleles of the CETP gene that lower hepatic CETP secretion to be associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction. Meanwhile, CETP gene transfer in mice was found to increase RCT from peripheral macrophages in vivo, and human plasma with high CETP activity was shown to have a greater capacity to remove cholesterol from cultured cells than plasma with low activity. This mounting evidence for a protective function of CETP has been given remarkably little attention, and indeed was not mentioned in several recent reviews. \u00a0It appears to show that CETP inhibition does not test the HDL hypothesis as originally hoped, and raises a pressing ethical issue regarding two Phase 3 trials of inhibitors, involving more than forty thousand subjects, which are currently in progress. As the weight of evidence now clearly supports an adverse effect of CETP inhibition on CVD, an urgent review is needed to determine if these trials should be discontinued.",

We have identified small molecules that protect ECs via ERK5 activation and determined their contribution to preventing cardiac allograft rejection. Using high-throughput screening, we identified certain statins and antimalarial agents including chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and quinacrine as strong ERK5 activators. Pitavastatin enhanced ERK5 transcriptional activity and Kruppel-like factor-2 expression in cultured human and bovine ECs, but these effects were abolished by the depletion of ERK5. Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine upregulated ERK5 kinase activity and inhibited VCAM-1 expression in an ERK5-dependent but MAPK/ERK kinase 5- and Kruppel-like factor 2/4-independent manner. Leukocyte rolling and vascular reactivity were used to evaluate endothelial function in vivo, and we found that EC-specific ERK5 knockout (ERK5-EKO) mice exhibited increased leukocyte rolling and impaired vascular reactivity, which could not be corrected by pitavastatin. The role of endothelial ERK5 in acute cardiac allograft rejection was also examined by heterotopic grafting of the heart obtained from either wild-type or ERK5-EKO mice into allomismatched recipient mice. A robust increase in both inflammatory gene expression and CD45-positive cell infiltration into the graft was observed. These tissue rejection responses were inhibited by pitavastatin in wild-type but not ERK5-EKO hearts. Our study has identified statins and antimalarial drugs as strong ERK5 activators and shown that ERK5 activation is preventive of endothelial inflammation and dysfunction and acute allograft rejection.",

We conducted an EMBASE and MEDLINE search for studies in which patients were randomized to treatment with a statin plus standard treatment (or placebo) versus standard treatment (or placebo). We included studies that provided data on creatinine clearance, and incidence of CIN before the initiation of the treatment and at the end of the follow-up period. We identified 9 prospective randomized studies of high-dose statin treatment compared with placebo treatment for CIN prevention with 2504 controls and 2480 patients that received statins.

If a protective effect of statins on breast cancer recurrence is supported by trial evidence, then the indications for a safe, well tolerated, and inexpensive treatment can be expanded to improve outcomes for breast cancer survivors.

Patients were treated with high-intensity rosuvastatin (40 mg/day) throughout 13 months and serial intracoronary imaging with the analysis of matched segments was available for 82 patients with 146 non-IRA. The primary IVUS end-point was the change in per cent atheroma volume (PAV). After 13 months, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) had decreased from a median of 3.29 to 1.89 mmol/L (P < 0.001), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels had increased from 1.10 to 1.20 mmol/L (P < 0.001). PAV of the non-IRA decreased by -0.9% (95% CI: -1.56 to -0.25, P = 0.007). Patients with regression in at least one non-IRA were more common (74%) than those without (26%). Per cent necrotic core remained unchanged (-0.05%, 95% CI: -1.05 to 0.96%, P = 0.93) as did the number of RF-IVUS defined thin cap fibroatheromas (124 vs. 116, P = 0.15).",

Although genetic studies have highlighted the causal relationship between coronary disease and Lp(a), it is uncertain which strategies maximize the therapeutic benefit of patients with high Lp(a) levels. We report the challenging case of a young coronary heart disease (CHD) patient who underwent 10 percutaneous coronary interventions due to repeated acute coronary syndromes (2006-2009) despite an optimally controlled, traditional risk-factor profile. For the first time, we performed specific Lp(a) immunoadsorption in the presence of very low levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) while the patient was on a high-dose statin regimen. There have been no previous reports of patients with high Lp(a) levels who achieved LDL-C goals when treated with an isolated Lp(a)-lowering method. Despite the very high risk of cardiovascular death, targeting Lp(a) resulted in dramatic improvement of the patient's clinical condition. Thus, we suggest that specific Lp(a) apheresis should be considered an effective new treatment strategy for patients with progressive CHD who have reached LDL-C goals but harbor elevated Lp(a) levels.", 
    "104": "Personalized medicine is an emerging field with a goal of applying genomic information as a predictor of disease risk as well as individualization of drug therapy. For optimization of drug therapy, significant progress has been made in the past decade in linking genetic variation in genes associated with drug disposition to prediction of drug response and adverse reactions. For most drugs in clinical use, the interplay of many factors, including genetics, demographics, drug-drug interactions, disease states and the environment, result in the interindividual variability observed during drug therapy. Broadly speaking, such determinants of drug response are mediated through modulation of drug concentrations reflective of pharmacokinetic factors, as well as drug targets, often referred to as pharmacodynamics. It is clear that for personalized medicine to become clinically meaningful, genomic as well as clinical and environmental influences must be considered together. We show, for a number of drugs in clinical use, that genomics-guided treatment options not only are becoming feasible but are also on the cusp of showing superiority in terms of clinical outcomes as well as cost-benefit. One of the most widely studied drugs with regard to genomics-guided dosing options is the oral anticoagulant, warfarin. Genetic polymorphisms in the gene encoding cytochrome P450 2C9 (CYP2C9) and those in the target gene responsible for the warfarin anticoagulant effect, vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKORC1), account for much of the variability in the warfarin maintenance dose; however, routine genotyping in warfarin therapy remains controversial. We will outline the importance of understanding all of the variables that mediate warfarin response as the prerequisite to successful utilization of genotype-guided warfarin therapy. Similarly, HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors, commonly known as statins, also display wide interindividual variability in plasma concentration, response and toxicity due in part to polymorphisms in transporter genes, including SLCO1B1 and ABCG2. Genetic factors are also important considerations in treatment with other therapeutic agents discussed, including clopidogrel and tamoxifen. Implementation of personalized medicine-based treatment options for these and other drugs, the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of which are impacted by functional genetic variations, will require overcoming a number of challenges, including cost, turnaround time, and demonstration of clinical benefit, as well as better training of health care professionals about genomics in general, and pharmacogenomics in particular.",

    "147": "The current standard for treating infected bony defects, such as those caused by periodontal disease, requires multiple time-consuming steps and often multiple procedures to fight the infection and recover lost tissue. Releasing an antibiotic followed by an osteogenic agent from a synthetic bone graft substitute could allow for a streamlined treatment, reducing the need for multiple surgeries and thereby shortening recovery time. Tailorable bilayered calcium sulfate (CS) bone graft substitutes were developed with the ability to sequentially release multiple therapeutic agents. Bilayered composite samples having a shell and core geometry were fabricated with varying amounts (1 or 10 wt.%) of metronidazole-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) particles embedded in the shell and simvastatin directly loaded into either the shell, core, or both. Microcomputed tomography showed the overall layered geometry as well as the uniform distribution of PLGA within the shells. Dissolution studies demonstrated that the amount of PLGA particles (i.e., 1 vs. 10 wt.%) had a small but significant effect on the erosion rate (3% vs. 3.4%/d). Mechanical testing determined that introducing a layered geometry had a significant effect on the compressive strength, with an average reduction of 35%, but properties were comparable to those of mandibular trabecular bone. Sustained release of simvastatin directly loaded into CS demonstrated that changing the shell to core volume ratio dictates the duration of drug release from each layer. When loaded together in the shell or in separate layers, sequential release of metronidazole and simvastatin was achieved. By introducing a tunable, layered geometry capable of releasing multiple drugs, CS-based bone graft substitutes could be tailored in order to help streamline the multiple steps needed to regenerate tissue in infected defects.",

However, when lipid management goals are not achieved with lifestyle modification, we should consider pharmacological treatments, and statins are the drugs with the most abundant evidence to support LDL-C-lowering and ASCVD prevention.", 
    "158": "The gene product ABCB1 (formerly MDR1 or P-glycoprotein) is hypothesized to be involved in cholesterol cellular trafficking, redistribution and intestinal re-absorption. Carriers of the ABCB1:3435T allele have previously been associated with decreases in ABCB1 mRNA and protein concentrations and have been correlated with changes in serum lipid concentrations. The aim of this study was to investigate possible association between the ABCB1:3435T>C polymorphism and changes in lipids in patients following statin treatment. Outpatients (n=130) were examined: 43 men (33%), 87 women (67%): treated with atorvastatin or simvastatin (all patients with equivalent dose of 20 or 40 mg/d simvastatin). Blood was taken for ABCB1:3435T>C genotyping, and before and after statin treatment for lipid concentration determination (total cholesterol, high-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides). Change (\u0394) in lipid parameters, calculated as differences between measurements before and after treatment, were analyzed with multiple regression adjustments: gender, diabetes, age, body mass index, equivalent statin dose, length of treatment. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed significant differences in \u0394HDL-C (univariate p=0.029; multivariate p=0.036) and %\u0394HDL-C (univariate p=0.021; multivariate p=0.023) between patients with TT (-0.05 \u00b1 0.13 g/l; -6.8% \u00b1 20%; respectively) and CC+CT genotypes (0.004 \u00b1 0.15 g/l; 4.1 \u00b1 26%; respectively). Reduction of HDL-C in homozygous ABCB1:3435TT patients suggests this genotype could be associated with a reduction in the benefits of statin treatment.", 
    "159": "In previous studies, it was reported that the protein isolated from the cowpea interferes favourably in lipid metabolism, and reduces cholesterol synthesis. The present study investigated the role of cowpea peptide fractions in the micellar solubilisation of cholesterol, in the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) activity, and in the in vitro antioxidant capacity, considering the effects of thermal processing. The protein was isolated from the raw and cooked beans and digested to simulate human digestion. The peptides from the protein isolate of raw bean with molecular mass lower than 3kDa reduced 89% of the HMGCR enzymatic reaction velocity. The cooked cowpeas were more effective in inhibiting the micellar solubility of cholesterol than the raw ones but not the antioxidant activity. This is the first report that cowpea peptides inhibit cholesterol homeostasis in vitro in two distinct routes, and act as an antioxidant.", 
    "160": "Atherosclerosis is the commonest and most important vascular disease. Andrographolide (AND) is the main bioactive component of the medicinal plant Andrographis paniculata and is used in traditional medicine. This study was aimed to evaluate the antiatherogenic effect of AND against atherosclerosis induced by Porphyromonas gingivalis in White New Zealand rabbits. Thirty rabbits were divided into five groups as follows: G1, normal group; G2-5, were orally challenged with P. gingivalis five times a week over 12 weeks; G2, atherogenic control group; G3, standard group treated with atorvastatin (AV) 5 mg/kg; and G4 and G5, treatment groups treated with AND 10 and 20 mg/kg, respectively over 12 weeks. Serums were subjected to antioxidant enzymatic and anti-inflammatory activities, and the aorta was subjected to histological analyses. Groups treated with AND showed a significant reversal of liver and renal biochemical changes, compared with the atherogenic control group. In the same groups, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), total glutathione (GSH) levels in serum were significantly increased (P < 0.05), and lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde (MDA)) levels were significantly decreased (P < 0.05), respectively. Furthermore, treated groups with AV and AND showed significant decrease in the level of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 compared with the atherogenic control group. In aortic homogenate, the level of nitrotyrosine was significantly increased, while the level of MCP1 was significantly decreased in AV and AND groups compared with the atherogenic control group. In addition, staining the aorta with Sudan IV showed a reduction in intimal thickening plaque in AV and AND groups compared with the atherogenic control group. AND has showed an antiatherogenic property as well as the capability to reduce lipid, liver, and kidney biomarkers in atherogenic serum that prevents atherosclerosis complications caused by P. gingivalis.", 
    "161": "Radiotherapy (XRT) delivered with the antibody cetuximab is a standard treatment option for squamous cell carcinomas of head and neck (SCCNH). Cetuximab acts by blocking epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling to inhibit cancer progression. However, a significant percentage of patients will not respond to XRT and cetuximab. Statins reduce the synthesis of cholesterol and isoprenoid derivates that may be required for efficient EGFR signaling. We assessed whether the statin simvastatin could improve this combined therapy. In vitro, simvastatin enhanced the effects of XRT alone and in combination with cetuximab in wound healing, cell proliferation, and clonogenic assays in FaDu cells. These results were reflected in xenoimplanted tumors growing into subcutaneous tissue of athymic mice where concomitant treatment with simvastatin decreased tumor growth. Consistently, lower levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT-protein kinase B, and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 oncoproteins and higher levels of caspase-3 and apoptosis in cell cultures and xenografts were observed. The EGFR-overexpressing A431 cell line was used to reproduce these antitumor effects of simvastatin. Our findings suggest that simvastatin may improve the efficiency of concomitant XRT and cetuximab. Further investigation in the treatment of SCCNH is warranted.",

Leg isokinetic extension average power at 60\u00b0 per second (-8.8 \u00b1 10.5N-M, p = 0.02) and average peak torque at 60\u00b0 per second (-14.0 \u00b1 19.7N-M, p = 0.04) decreased slightly with statin use, but 8 of 10 other variables for leg strength did not change (all p >0.13). Handgrip, muscle pain, respiratory exchange ratio, and daily activity also did not change (all p >0.09). In conclusion, statin myalgia is not associated with reduced muscle strength or muscle performance.",

The positive correlations between PCSK9/TCh and PCSK9/LDL-Ch have been found only in patients not treated with statins. The elevated circulating PCSK9 level is corrected by maintenance hemodialysis treatment and normalized by a successful kidney transplantation.", 
    "172": "Administration of high intensity statins prior to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) or stable coronary artery disease has been shown to reduce short-, mid-, and long-term cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality as well as overall mortality compared with lower intensity statins or no statin treatment. The mechanisms involved are probably related to the pleiotropic effects of statins. Improved endothelial function, reduced low grade inflammation and decreased thrombotic diathesis might reduce cardiac injury, diffuse cardiac necrosis, myocardial infarction and no-reflow phenomenon. A decreased risk of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) post-PCI might be an extracardiac mechanism that contributes to the reduction in all cause and CVD mortality.

Depending on the Monascus strains and the fermentation conditions, the products may contain monacolins, pigments and citrinin as secondary metabolites. Authentic and commercial RYR samples were analyzed using UHPLC-DAD-QToF-MS for monacolins, pigments and citrinin. A separation by UHPLC was achieved using a reversed-phase column and a gradient of water/acetonitrile each containing formic acid as the mobile phase. Accurate mass QToF spectrometry was used to distinguish isobaric monacolins. Principle component analysis (PCA), a chemometric technique was used to discriminate between authentic RYR, commercial RYR raw materials and dietary supplements. Three authentic RYR samples, 31 commercial RYR raw materials and 14 RYR dietary supplements were analyzed. Monacolin K content in 600mg of authentic RYR samples ranged from 1.2mg to 1.38mg. Amounts of monacolin K in dietary supplements labeled as containing 600mg of RYR varied more than 40-fold from 0.03mg to 2.18mg. Monacolin K content of dietary supplements labeled as containing 1200mg RYR varied more than 20-fold from 0.22mg to 5.23mg. In addition to large variations in quantity of monacolin K found in dietary supplements, RYR dietary supplements contained ratios of monacolins that differed significantly from authentic samples.
