Aim of report: To investigate the risk of gastrointestinal hemorrhage among statin-users compared with non-users.", 
    "1": "This was a retrospective cohort study using clinical, administrative, and pharmacy data encompassing October 2003 to March 2012 from patients enrolled in the San Antonio military health care system. Two treatment groups were defined: statin-users (use for at least 90\u2009days) and non-users (never received statin). A propensity score-matched cohort was generated to match statin-users and non-users based on 82 variables. Main outcome measures were defined by the International Classification of Diseases, ninth revision-clinical modification diagnoses codes or procedural codes for gastrointestinal hemorrhage, gastritis/doudenitis, gastroduodenal ulcers, endoscopy procedures, and endoscopy procedures related to gastrointestinal hemorrhage.", 
    "2": "A total of 43,438 patients were identified; 13,626 (31.4%) were statin-users and 29,812 were non-users. We propensity score-matched 6342 non-users with 6342 statin-users. The risk of outcomes was similar between the two groups for gastrointestinal hemorrhage (Odds Ratio [OR]: 1.0; 95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 0.91, 1.11); gastrointestinal ulcers (OR: 0.99; 95%CI [0.80, 1.24]); gastritis/duodenitis (OR: 0.92; 95%CI [0.83, 1.02]); and endoscopic procedures (OR: 1.07; 95%CI [0.98, 1.17]).",

    "4": "Atorvastatin is known to both inhibit and induce the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzyme in vitro. Some clinical studies indicate that atorvastatin inhibits CYP3A4 but there are no well-controlled longer term studies that could evaluate the inducing effect of atorvastatin. We aimed to determine if atorvastatin induces or inhibits CYP3A4 activity as measured by the 4\u03b2-hydroxycholesterol to cholesterol ratio (4\u03b2HC : C).",

    "8": "Strokes are preceded by oxidative stress and inflammation, two processes linked to atherosclerosis and hypertension. Statins have been widely employed to control atherosclerosis; however, there could be neurological implications to its use\u2014including cognitive impairment. Thus,we aimed to determine whether alpha-tocopherol is capable of reversing the neurological side effects of statins and enhancing its anti-inflammatory properties. To assess these effects, 15-week-old stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSPs) were divided into four groups (n = 6, each): alpha-tocopherol (AT), lovastatin (LoV), alpha-tocopherol + lovastatin (AT + LoV), and control (C).We administered 120 IU of alpha-tocopherol diluted in 0.1 ml of coconut oil,whereas the dose of lovastatin was administered at a ratio of 1 mg/kg of rat body weight. The control group received 0.1 ml coconut oil. All animals received the treatments via orogastric gavage.We assessed body weight, diuresis, food and water intake, oxidative stress (malondialdehyde levels), the total cellular injury marker (lactate dehydrogenase), short and long-term memory, cognition, and histopathological changes in the hippocampus. The results demonstrated that lovastatin treatment did not negatively affect the memory of our animal model. In fact, the animals treated with AT and LoV showed improvement in memory and cognition. Additionally, both treatments decrease lactate dehydrogenase and oxidative stress levels. Furthermore, our study also demonstrated hippocampal tissue preservation in the treated groups.",

    "10": "Self microemulsified liquids (SELS) were prepared with oleic acid, Span 40 and Tween 80. SELS were converted into SMET by adsorption, followed by compression using factors such as CP, maltodextrin and MCC, which were optimized through a 2(3)-factorial design considering responses such as the disintegration time and, the times for 50% and 80% of the drug to be released.", 
    "11": "The results indicated that CP and MCC were inversely related to the responses, while maltodextrin was directly related to the responses. The droplet size of the disintegrated SMET oil globules was within 2.73 to 4.77 \u03bcm. The Cmax and AUC0-\u221e of the optimized SMET were found to be 32.5% and 38.8% higher, respectively, than those of the commercial tablet.",

    "13": "This study aimed to investigate the protective effects of pravastatin on hyperbaric hyperoxia-induced lung injury (HILI). C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned into three groups: control group, HILI group and pravastatin (Pra) group. Mice in the HILI and Pra groups were subjected to exposure to pure oxygen at 2.5 atm abs for six hours. Mice in the Pra group were intraperitoneally treated with pravastatin at 15 mg/kg. immediately after exposure. At 24 hours, the lungs were collected for HE staining, TUNEL staining and detection of lung edema, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and cytokines, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was harvested for cell-counting. Pravastatin treatment significantly improved the pathology of the lung after HILI (reduction in thickness of alveolar septum, attenuation of lung edema, fracturing of alveolar septa and decrease in infiltrated leukocytes); reduced the number of apoptotic cells; inhibited lung MPO activity; and regulated the balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Our findings suggest that pravastatin may exert a protective effect on lung injury after hyperbaric hyperoxia exposure by inhibiting inflammation.", 
    "14": "Decompression sickness (DCS) is a specific diving injury which sometimes may be life-threatening. Previous studies suggested that simvastatin (SIM) can protect against pathological inflammation and tissue damage. This study aimed to investigate whether SIM pretreatment could exert its beneficial effects on DCS. SIM was administered orally to adult male Sprague-Dawley rats for two weeks (2 mg/kg/day), then rats were subjected to a simulated dive at 700 kPa air pressure for 100 minutes before rapid decompression. After 30 minutes of symptom observation, lung tissue and blood samples were collected for further analysis. Compared to the vehicle-control, SIM pretreatment significantly decreased the incidence of DCS and ameliorated all parameters of pulmonary injuries, including lung dry/wet weight ratio, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid protein concentration, lung tissue malondialdehyde level and morphology. Moreover, SIM pretreatment abolished increases in systemic and pulmonary inflammation by reducing tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 levels in blood plasma and lung tissue. The results indicate that SIM may offer a novel pharmacological protection against injuries in DCS rats by inhibiting inflammatory responses. Further study is needed to understand the exact mechanisms.",

Persistence was defined as continuation of aspirin, adenosine diphosphate receptor inhibitors, \u03b2-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, and statins from discharge to 6 months post-MI. Multivariable logistic regression modeling was used to determine factors associated with nonpersistence, defined as <80% persistence with all medication classes.",

We examined the association of brand versus generic statin prescription and 1-year adherence after adjusting for demographics, clinical factors, predischarge lipid values, prior statin use, and socioeconomic status. Overall, 65.5% of statin fills were for brand-name statins. There were few baseline differences in demographics and clinical factors among generic versus brand users. Patient copay amounts were higher for brand versus generic statins (median = $25 vs $5, P < .001), yet the mean proportion of days covered over 1 year was similar (71.5% vs 68.9%; P = .97; unadjusted odds ratio 1.15 [95% CI 0.96-1.37]). Proportion of days covered \u226580% was low for both generic (56.2%) and brand statins (55.9%; P = .93).

Recent clinical evidence shows that cardioprotection in patients receiving a chronic statin treatment can be \"recaptured\" by a high-dose statin therapy given shortly before an ischemia-reperfusion sequence. Evaluation of this novel therapeutic approach in the setting of CABG seems promising because myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury plays a pivotal role in poor clinical outcomes that may be improved by a simple preoperative statin recapture treatment.",

The trial aims to evaluate whether a high-dose statin recapture therapy given shortly before CABG reduces the incidence of MACCE at 30 days after surgery (primary composite outcome: all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events). Consenting patients who are on chronic statin therapy before surgery will be randomized to receive either oral statin reloading therapy or matching placebo 12 and 2 hours before CABG. Key secondary end points include enzymatic myocardial injury; new-onset atrial fibrillation; length of stay in the intensive care unit and hospital; need for repeat coronary revascularization at 30 days; and, finally, all-cause mortality at 12 months after surgery.",

With inputs from stroke patients themselves, a series of comparative safety and effectiveness analyses will be performed across 3 prioritized therapeutic areas identified as important by stroke survivors: oral anticoagulants, statin therapy, and antidepressants. We obtained data from Get With the Guidelines-Stroke linked with Medicare claims and follow-up telephone interviews. Our combined retrospective and prospective research strategy allows the evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of various treatment options and patient-centered longitudinal outcomes.

    "32": "The current therapeutic strategies are based on the design of multifunctional drug candidates able to interact with various disease related targets. Drugs that have the ability to scavenge reactive oxygen species (ROS), beyond their main therapeutic action, may prevent the oxidative damage of biomolecules. Therefore, analytical approaches that monitor in a continuous mode the ability of drugs to counteract peroxidation of physiologically relevant biotargets are required. In the present work, a microplate spectrophotometric assay is proposed to evaluate the ability of selected cardiovascular drugs, including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, \u03b2 -blockers and statins to prevent protein peroxidation. Myoglobin, which is a heme protein, and peroxyl radicals generated from thermolysis of 2,2'-azo-bis(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride at 37 \u00b0C, pH 7.4 were selected as protein model and oxidative species, respectively. Myoglobin peroxidation was continuously monitored by the absorbance decrease at 409 nm and the ability of drugs to counteract protein oxidation was determined by the calculation of the area under the curve upon the myoglobin oxidation. Fluvastatin (AUC\u2085\u2080=12.5 \u00b1 1.2 \u03bcM) and enalapril (AUC\u2085\u2080=15.2 \u00b1 1.8 \u03bcM) showed high ability to prevent myoglobin peroxidation, providing even better efficiency than endogenous antioxidants such as reduced glutathione. Moreover, labetalol, enalapril and fluvastatin prevent the autoxidation of myoglobin, while glutathione showed a pro-oxidant effect.", 
    "33": "Rosuvastatin (RST), a synthetic statin, is a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, with a number of pleiotropic properties, such as anti-inflammation, antioxidation and cardiac remodelling attenuation. According to IMS Health, rosuvastatin was the third best-selling drug in the United States in 2012. RST was recently found in European effluent samples at a detection frequency of 36%. In this study, we evaluate the identification process of major transformation products (TPs) of RST generated during the heterogeneous photocatalysis process with ZnO. The degradation of the parent molecule and the identification of the main TPs were studied in demineralised water. The TPs were monitored and identified by liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-QTOF-MS/MS). Ten TPs were tentatively identified and some of them originated from the hydroxylation suffered by the aromatic ring during the initial stages of the process. Structural elucidation of some of the most abundant or persistent TPs was evaluated by computational analysis, which demonstrated that this approach can be used as a tool to help the elucidation of structures of unknown molecules. The analysis of the parameters obtained from ab initio calculations for different isomers showed the most stable structures and, consequently, the most likely to be found.", 
    "34": "At a given level of serum cholesterol, patients with T2D have an increased risk of developing atherosclerosis compared with nondiabetic subjects. We hypothesized that T2D patients have an increased interstitial fluid (IF)-to-serum gradient ratio for LDL, due to leakage over the vascular wall. Therefore, lipoprotein profiles in serum and IF from 35 T2D patients and 35 healthy controls were assayed using fast performance liquid chromatography. The IF-to-serum gradients for VLDL and LDL cholesterol, as well as for apoB, were clearly reduced in T2D patients compared with healthy controls. No such differences were observed for HDL cholesterol. Contrary to our hypothesis, the atherogenic VLDL and LDL particles were not increased in IF from diabetic patients. Instead, they were relatively sparser than in healthy controls. The most probable explanation to our unexpected finding is that these lipoproteins are more susceptible to retainment in the extravascular space of these patients, reflecting a more active uptake by, or adhesion to, tissue cells, including macrophages in the vascular wall. Further studies are warranted to further characterize the mechanisms underlying these observations, which may be highly relevant for the understanding of why the propensity to develop atherosclerosis is increased in T2D.",

In addition, we extended the graphical augmentation approach to assess potential changes in the pooled effect estimate after updating a current meta-analysis and applied the three graphical contour definitions to data from meta-analyses on statin use and acute kidney injury risk.", 
    "37": "In the considered example data, the pooled effect estimates and heterogeneity indices demonstrated to be considerably robust to the addition of a future study. Supportingly, for some previously inconclusive meta-analyses, a study update might yield statistically significant kidney injury risk increase associated with higher statin exposure.",

    "39": "Myocardial infarction and stroke are frequent after surgical procedures and consume a considerable amount of benefit of surgical therapy. Perioperative stress, induced by surgery, is composed of hemodynamic and inflammatory reactions. The effects of perioperative stress on atherosclerotic plaques are ill-defined. Murine models to investigate the influence of perioperative stress on plaque stability and rupture are not available. We developed a model to investigate the influence of perioperative stress on plaque growth and stability by exposing apolipoprotein-E-deficient mice, fed a high cholesterol diet for 7\u2005weeks, to a double hit consisting of 30\u2005min of laparotomy combined with a substantial blood loss (approximately 20% of total blood volume; 400\u2005\u00b5l). The innominate artery was harvested 72\u2005h after the intervention. Control groups were sham and baseline controls. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and serum amyloid A (SAA) plasma levels were determined. Plaque load, vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) and macrophage content were quantified. Plaque stability was assessed using the Stary score and frequency of signs of plaque rupture were assessed. High-dose atorvastatin (80\u2005mg/kg body weight/day) was administered for 6\u2005days starting 3\u2005days prior to the double hit. A single dose of an IL-6-neutralizing antibody or the fusion protein gp130-Fc selectively targeting IL-6 trans-signaling was subcutaneously injected. IL-6 plasma levels increased, peaking at 6\u2005h after the intervention. SAA levels peaked at 24\u2005h (n=4, P<0.01). Plaque volume increased significantly with the double hit compared to sham (n=8, P<0.01). More plaques were scored as complex or bearing signs of rupture after the double hit compared to sham (n=5-8, P<0.05). Relative VSMC and macrophage content remained unchanged. IL-6-inhibition or atorvastatin, but not blocking of IL-6 trans-signaling, significantly decreased plaque volume and complexity (n=8, P<0.01). Using this model, researchers will be able to further investigate the pathophysiology of perioperative plaque stability, which can result in myocardial infarction, and, additionally, to test potential protective strategies.", 
    "40": "While statins play an indisputable role in primary and secondary prevention of ischemic cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, a concern exists regarding a possible association between low lipoprotein levels and statin use on the risk of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). While these data may incline physicians to discontinue statins after ICH, an increasing amount of preclinical and clinical evidence suggests that statins might have a beneficial effect on outcome and recovery in this context that goes beyond lipid lowering effects. Different etiologies of ICH and the related risk of recurrence should also be taken into account when deciding about statin use/avoidance in patients with high risk of ICH. The problem is compounded by paucity of data from randomized controlled trials and well-designed prospective observational studies. This review will discuss the existing evidence on potential interactions between statins and risk of ICH as well as outcomes in order to provide practical recommendations for clinical decision-making.", 
    "41": "Statin drugs are one of the most commonly prescribed pharmaceuticals by physicians. By blocking the rate-limiting step in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, statins inhibit cholesterol synthesis, which benefits patient health. However, since many other important cellular processes are regulated within this pathway, they may also be influenced by statin therapy. These pleiotropic effects of statins have not been fully investigated, but are believed to positively influence endothelial cells (ECs), which line the vasculature in a confluent monolayer. Few studies have considered the effect of blood flow on ECs and how this may augment EC response to statins.", 
    "42": "In this study, the effect of statin treatment on ECs is investigated for cells stimulated with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), an inflammatory cytokine that promotes an atheroprone endothelium. Additionally, ECs are exposed to a physiologically relevant wall shear stress (WSS) of 12.5 dynes/cm(2) using a three-dimensional tissue culture model to provide a realistic hemodynamic environment. ECs are analyzed for morphology using light microscopy as well as cytoskeletal structure and alignment using confocal microscopy. Statistical analysis is performed on the results using both the one-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni post-tests and the two-tailed t test.", 
    "43": "We have shown that statin treatment caused cells to adapt to a rounded, atheroprone morphology, with a significantly higher shape index. Oppositely, TNF-\u03b1 stimulation caused cells to elongate to an atheroprotective morphology, with a significantly lower shape index. WSS and TNF-\u03b1 were unable to reverse any statin-induced cell rounding or F-actin disruption.", 
    "44": "Further work is therefore needed to determine why statin drugs cause cells to have an atheroprone morphology, but an atheroprotective genotype, and why TNF-\u03b1 stimulation causes an atheroprotective morphology, but an atheroprone genotype. Despite the morphological changes due to statins or stimulation, ECs still respond to WSS. Understanding how statins influence ECs will allow for more targeted treatments for hypercholestemia and potentially other diseases.", 
    "45": "Clinical success of coronary drug-eluting stents (DES) is hampered by simultaneous reduction of smooth muscle cell (HCASMC) and endothelial cell proliferation due to unspecific cytotoxicity of currently used compounds. Previous in vitro data showing SMC-specific inhibition of proliferation suggested that statins may be suitable candidates for DES. It was aim of this study to further investigate statins as DES drug candidates to identify mechanisms contributing to their cell-selectivity. In vitro proliferation assays comparing the influence of various statins on HCASMC and endothelial cells confirmed that atorvastatin exhibits HCASMC-specificity. Due to similar expression levels of the drug target HMG-CoA reductase in both cell types, cellular accumulation of atorvastatin was assessed, revealing enhanced uptake in HCASMC most likely driven by significant expression of OATP2B1, a known uptake transporter for atorvastatin. In accordance with the finding that endogenous OATP2B1 influenced cellular accumulation in HCASMC we used this transporter as a tool to identify teniposide as new DES candidate drug with HCASMC-specific effects. We describe OATP2B1 as a determinant of pharmacokinetics in the coronary artery. Indeed, endogenously expressed OATP2B1 significantly influences the uptake of substrate drugs, thereby governing cell specificity. Screening of candidate drugs for interaction with OATP2B1 may be used to promote SMC-specificity.",

Accordingly, this article evaluates whether combination therapy may further reduce HCC. Newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) patients, excluding those with history of malignancy prior to the date of DM diagnosis, were recruited to a DM cohort. DM patients developed HCC as the cancer cohort and the date for HCC diagnosis as index date. Non-cancer cohort was frequency matched with 4:1 according to age, sex, DM-year, and index date as case group from DM cohort. Patients who were treated with statins showed a 63% decreased risk of HCC (odds ratio [OR] = 0.37; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.27-0.49). Patients who consumed simvastatin, atorvastatin, or rosuvastatin significantly decreased risk for HCC (OR = 0.32, 0.31, and 0.22; 95% CI = 0.18-0.58, 0.19-0.52, and 0.08-0.61, respectively). Metformin combinations with simvastatin, atorvastatin, or rosuvastatin may decrease HCC (OR = 0.30, 0.30, and 0.24; 95% CI = 0.15-0.59, 0.16-0.54, and 0.08-0.70, respectively). The comorbidities for HCC were decreased by consuming simvastatin and atorvastatin (OR = 0.31 and 0.29; 95% CI = 0.14-0.67 and 0.15-0.57, respectively). Only combination therapy of metformin and simvastatin may significantly decreased HCC comorbidities (OR = 0.26; 95% CI = 0.11-0.60) in our study. In Asia, not all metformin combinations with statins may reduce the incidence of HCC and not all of this kind of combination therapy may decrease the HCC comorbidities.", 
    "47": "There is a controversy about the extent to which the primary and secondary dielectric relaxations influence the crystallization of amorphous organic compounds below the glass transition temperature. Recent studies also point to the importance of fast molecular dynamics on picosecond-to-nanosecond time scales with respect to the glass stability. In the present study we provide terahertz spectroscopy evidence on the crystallization of amorphous naproxen well below its glass transition temperature and confirm the direct role of Johari-Goldstein (JG) secondary relaxation as a facilitator of the crystallization. We determine the onset temperature T\u03b2 above which the JG relaxation contributes to the fast molecular dynamics and analytically quantify the level of this contribution. We then show there is a strong correlation between the increase in the fast molecular dynamics and onset of crystallization in several chosen amorphous drugs.

Solubility and emulsification tests were performed to select a suitable combination of oil, surfactant, and cosurfactant. A D-optimal mixture design was used to optimize the concentration of components used in the SMEDDS formulation for achieving excellent physicochemical characteristics, such as small droplet size and high dissolution. The optimized ATV-loaded SMEDDS formulation containing 7.16% Capmul MCM (oil), 48.25% Tween 20 (surfactant), and 44.59% Tetraglycol (cosurfactant) significantly enhanced the dissolution rate of ATV in different types of medium, including simulated intestinal fluid, simulated gastric fluid, and distilled water, compared with ATV suspension. Good agreement was observed between predicted and experimental values for mean droplet size and percentage of the drug released in 15 minutes. Further, pharmacokinetic studies in rats showed that the optimized SMEDDS formulation considerably enhanced the oral absorption of ATV, with 3.4-fold and 4.3-fold increases in the area under the concentration-time curve and time taken to reach peak plasma concentration, respectively, when compared with the ATV suspension. Thus, we successfully developed an optimized ATV-loaded SMEDDS formulation by using the D-optimal mixture design, that could potentially be used for improving the oral absorption of poorly water-soluble drugs.", 
    "57": "Coronary atherosclerosis has been considered a chronic disease characterized by ongoing progression in response to systemic risk factors and local pro-atherogenic stimuli. As our understanding of the pathobiological mechanisms implicated in atherogenesis and plaque progression is evolving, effective treatment strategies have been developed that led to substantial reduction of the clinical manifestations and acute complications of coronary atherosclerotic disease. More recently, intracoronary imaging modalities have enabled detailed in vivo quantification and characterization of coronary atherosclerotic plaque, serial evaluation of atherosclerotic changes over time, and assessment of vascular responses to effective anti-atherosclerotic medications. The use of intracoronary imaging modalities has demonstrated that intensive lipid lowering can halt plaque progression and may even result in regression of coronary atheroma when the highest doses of the most potent statins are used. While current evidence indicates the feasibility of atheroma regression and of reversal of presumed high-risk plaque characteristics in response to intensive anti-atherosclerotic therapies, these changes of plaque size and composition are modest and their clinical implications remain largely elusive. Growing interest has focused on achieving more pronounced regression of coronary plaque using novel anti-atherosclerotic medications, and more importantly on elucidating ways toward clinical translation of favorable changes of plaque anatomy into more favorable clinical outcomes for our patients.",

Little is known about achievement of non-HDL-C goals outside clinical trials. Within a population of 146,064 patients with dyslipidemia in the PINNACLE Registry and a subgroup of 36,188 patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), we examined the proportion of patients and patient characteristics associated with having LDL-C, non-HDL-C, and both LDL-C and non-HDL-C levels at National Cholesterol Education Program goals. LDL-C, non-HDL-C, and both LDL-C and non-HDL-C goals in the overall cohort were achieved by 73%, 73.4%, and 68.9% patients, respectively. Significant predictors of meeting all 3 goals were age, male gender, statin, nonstatin, and combined statin plus nonstatin use. Patients with co-morbidities of hypertension, previous stroke or transient ischemic attack, peripheral arterial disease, myocardial infarction, and smoking were less likely to have LDL-C, non-HDL-C, and both LDL-C and non-HDL-C levels at National Cholesterol Education Program goal. In the overall cohort, patients with DM were less likely to meet non-HDL-C and both LDL-C and non-HDL-C goals. In the subgroup of patients with DM, predictors of meeting lipid goals were similar to the overall cohort. In conclusion, these data suggest contemporary treatment patterns by cardiologists successfully achieve lipid goals in most patients. Younger, female patients and those with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and risk factors, such as hypertension and DM, are less likely to achieve goals and may require more careful follow-up after statin initiation. Both LDL-C and non-HDL-C goals are achieved in <70% of patients, suggesting room for improvement if a goal-targeted individualized strategy is adopted.",

Thrombosis is the major manifestation in patients with aPLs, but the spectrum of symptoms and signs associated with aPLs has broadened considerably, and other manifestations, such as thrombocytopenia, non-thrombotic neurological syndromes, psychiatric manifestations, livedo reticularis, skin ulcers, hemolytic anemia, pulmonary hypertension, cardiac valve abnormality, and atherosclerosis, have also been related to the presence of those antibodies. Several studies have contributed to uncovering the basis of antiphospholipid antibody pathogenicity, including the targeted cellular components, affected systems, involved receptors, intracellular pathways used, and the effector molecules that are altered in the process. Therapy for thrombosis traditionally has been based on long-term oral anticoagulation; however, bleeding complications and recurrence despite high-intensity anticoagulation can occur. The currently accepted first-line treatment for obstetric APS (OAPS) is low-dose aspirin plus prophylactic unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH). However, in approximately 20% of OAPS cases, the final endpoint, i.e. a live birth, cannot be achieved. Based on all the data obtained in different research studies, new potential therapeutic approaches have been proposed, including the use of new oral anticoagulants, statins, hydroxychloroquine, coenzyme Q10, B-cell depletion, platelet and TF inhibitors, peptide therapy or complement inhibition among others.

Interestingly, atorvastatin (ATV) is able to increase both endoglin and eNOS expression and reduce plaque size beyond its lipid lowering effects but by unknown mechanisms. We hypothesized whether inflammation modulates ATV-dependent induction of endoglin and eNOS expression in vitro in endothelial cells and whether ATV-induced eNOS expression is regulated via endoglin. After treatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with TNF-\u03b1, endoglin and eNOS protein expression was reduced, concomitantly with increased levels of cell surface VCAM-1 and soluble endoglin, as determined by flow cytometry, Western blot and ELISA analyses. By contrast, ATV treatment increased endoglin and eNOS protein expression, while preventing TNF-\u03b1-mediated downregulation of endoglin and eNOS protein levels. Moreover, suppression of endoglin using small interfering RNA (siRNA), but not inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 signaling with SB431542, abrogated ATV-induced eNOS expression. These results suggest that ATV treatment prevents inflammation-reduced endoglin and eNOS expression in endothelial cells and that ATV-induced eNOS expression strongly depends on the proper expression of endoglin in HUVECs. Possible implications of these findings might be reflected in pathological conditions characterized by reduced expression of endoglin and eNOS as for example in hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia or in other endothelial dysfunctions.",

In meta-analyses of large statin trials no increased risk of ICH was found, most likely as a consequence of a low absolute risk of ICH. Results of available studies indicate that the possibility that use of statins increases the risk of ICH cannot be excluded but that this is only of clinical relevance in patients with a history of ICH. Statins do not need to be terminated immediately in patients with ICH.

ABCG2 variants have been shown to alter rosuvastatin disposition. The objective of this study is to determine the impact of ABCG2 34/421 compound haplotypes on rosuvastatin pharmacokinetics in healthy Chinese volunteer subjects. Eight hundred healthy Chinese males were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-pyrosequencing for ABCG2 34G>A, ABCG2 421C>A, SLCO1B1 521T>C, and CYP2C9*3 variants. Sixty-two male subjects with wild-type SLCO1B1 c.521TT and CYP2C9*3 were recruited for this pharmacokinetic study of rosuvastatin. A single oral dose of 10 mg rosuvastatin was administrated to each subject, and blood samples were collected before and at various time points after drug administration. Plasma concentration of rosuvastatin was determined by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and pharmacokinetic analysis was carried out using the WinNonlin program. In Chinese males, high allele frequency of ABCG2 c.34G>A (0.275) and c.421C>A (0.282) was observed, resulting in a considerable portion (23.3%) of subjects being ABCG2 34/421 compound heterozygotes. Compared with subjects with ABCG2 wild-type (c.34GG/421CC), plasma rosuvastatin Cmax and area under the curve, AUC0-\u221e, were significantly higher, while the apparent oral clearance, CL/F, was significantly lower in subjects with c.34AA, c.421AA, and c.34GA/421CA genotypes. Both t1/2 and Tmax were similar among subjects with different genotypes. A high frequency of ABCG2 c.34G>A and c.421C>A variants was present in Chinese males, and the disposition of rosuvastatin was significantly affected by both variants. These data suggest that it is advisable to genotype these variants when prescribing rosuvastatin to Chinese subjects, leading to a precise dose for each individual.",

However, simple steatosis has a benign clinical course without excess mortality. In contrast, the advanced form of NAFLD, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with liver fibrosis increases mortality by approximately 70%, due to an increase in CVD mortality by approximately 300%. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) may be caused by NAFLD/NASH and it substantially increases CVD risk, especially in the presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Moreover, CKD may trigger NAFLD/NASH deterioration in a vicious cycle. NAFLD/NASH is also related to increased arterial stiffness (AS), an independent CVD risk factor that further raises CVD risk. Diagnosis of advanced liver fibrosis (mainly by simple non-invasive tests), CKD, and increased AS should be made early in the course of NAFLD and treated appropriately. Lifestyle measures and statin treatment may help resolve NAFLD/NASH and beneficially affect the CVD risk factors mentioned above.",

To minimize these harms, several frameworks have been developed by which prescribing can be optimized. In the context of diminishing life expectancy, these frameworks can be used to reduce medications that are no longer necessary, but appear to fall short of actual guidelines that incorporate a consideration of stopping medications. In this commentary, we present recommendations that could be incorporated into prescribing processes for all healthcare professionals and, ultimately, used to support the rationalization or deprescribing of medication in diminished life expectancy. We frame these recommendations in the same context as guidance for the initiation and discontinuation of implantable cardiac devices and argue that the two processes-with regards to decision-making-should be the same. We present our recommendations with preventive medication use in mind, and use statin therapy as an illustrative example.",

This review will present clinical evidence examining the outcomes of drug-eluting stents compared to coronary artery bypass graft surgery for unprotected left main coronary artery disease and discuss the anatomic factors, patient variables, and clinical strategies that may dictate choice of revascularization modality for patients with left main disease. If percutaneous coronary intervention is selected to treat unprotected left main disease, meticulous technique is essential to optimize outcomes, including use of procedural physiology and imaging guidance, optimal stent and adjunct pharmacology use, and expert management of the distal bifurcation.

Although FH is one of the most common genetic disorders, this disorder remains mostly undetected and its management is often suboptimal. High-intensity statins are standard treatment for patients with FH, but LDL-C levels in most patients treated with statin monotherapy remain above those recommended by guidelines. Combination therapy to lower LDL-C levels further-such as treatment with statins plus ezetimibe-has been successful, and combination of apheresis with high-intensity statin treatment is used in patients with homozygous FH and in those with heterozygous FH who are statin-refractory. Mipomersen, an inhibitor of apolipoprotein B-100 synthesis, and lomitapide, a microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitor, reduce LDL-C levels further when added to high-intensity statin treatment in homozygous FH, but both have important adverse effects, such as increasing liver fat content. At present, PCSK9 inhibition (with alirocumab or evolocumab) is well tolerated and reduces LDL-C levels considerably in patients receiving the maximally tolerated statin treatment, and seems the most promising emerging treatment option. Nevertheless, data from outcome trials with hard end points for PCSK9 inhibitors, mipomersen, and lomitapide are still needed before these therapies become standard for patients with FH.",

The purpose of this study was to determine the change of IL-37 in atherosclerotic plaque, the effect of atorvastatin on IL-37 and the association between IL-37 and Smad3 in atherosclerotic disease. Rabbits were subjected to atherosclerosis by the immunologic injury composite with balloon injury (BI). Some rabbits received atorvastatin treatment from 6 weeks to 12 weeks. Serum levels of IL-37 were assessed at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks in normal, atherosclerotic and atorvastatin groups. Protein and RNA levels of IL-37 atherosclerotic plaque from abdominal aorta were processed at 12 weeks. Abdominal aorta including atherosclerotic plaque was immunostained with IL-37 and Smad3. Serum IL-37 significantly increased in atherosclerotic disease, and this increase could be reduced by the atorvastatin treatment. IL-37 and Smad3 were accumulated in the macrophage-derived foam cells in the plaque and significantly increased in protein and RNA levels. Atorvastatin treatment could significantly suppress the increase of both IL-37 and Smad3. Plasma level of IL-37 and the IL-37 expression of the plaque were significantly increased in atherosclerotic disease. This increase could be suppressed by the atorvastatin treatment. In addition, Smad3 might be required for IL-37 activity during the atherosclerotic physiologic process.",

Statins are the mainstay of hypercholesterolemia treatment, but because of adherence and tolerability issues that limit dose titration, there is a need for additional therapies with good efficacy and better tolerability. Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) citrate lyase, a cytoplasmic enzyme responsible for the generation of acetyl coenzyme A for the de novo synthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol, is a very interesting molecular target for the reduction of plasma lipids. Furthermore, ATP citrate lyase inhibition may be accompanied by activation of 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, a key signaling molecule that acts a central hub in cellular metabolic regulation. ETC-1002 is a small molecule inhibitor of ATP citrate lyase that also activates 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase, effectively reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and inducing some other positive metabolic changes. Recent evidence from phase I and II clinical trials in humans has shown a positive efficacy and safety profile of ETC-1002, with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reductions similar to those attainable by usual doses of many statins and with no major apparent side effects. These results potentially introduce a new family of medications that may expand our therapeutic arsenal against hypercholesterolemia.",

In HCV-infected patients, addition of statins to the earlier standard of care therapy (pegIFN-\u03b1 and ribavirin) resulted in increased sustained virological response rates. The mechanism by which statins inhibit HCV replication has not yet been elucidated. In an attempt to gain insight in the underlying mechanism, hepatoma cells carrying an HCV replicon were passaged in the presence of increasing concentrations of fluvastatin. Fluvastatin-resistant replicon containing cells could be generated and proved \u223c8-fold less susceptible to fluvastatin than wild-type cultures. The growth efficiency of the resistant replicon containing cells was comparable to that of wild-type replicon cells. The fluvastatin-resistant phenotype was not conferred by mutations in the viral genome but is caused by cellular changes. The resistant cell line had a markedly increased HMG-CoA reductase expression upon statin treatment. Furthermore, the expression of the efflux transporter P-gp was increased in fluvastatin-resistant replicon cells (determined by qRT-PCR and flow cytometry). This increased expression resulted also in an increased functional transport activity as measured by the P-gp mediated efflux of calcein AM. In conclusion, we demonstrate that statin resistance in HCV replicon containing hepatoma cells is conferred by changes in the cellular environment.",

A remarkable red-shift in the absorption band with a gap of 200 nm in the H2S response can efficiently switch off the F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from BODIPY1 to BODInD-Cl, subsequently recovering the donor fluorescence. Impressively, both the interior hydrophobicity of supramolecular micelles and electron-withdrawing nature of indolium unit in BODInD-Cl can sharply increase aromatic nucleophilic substitution with H2S. The ratiometric strategy based on the unique self-assembled micellar aggregate NanoBODIPY achieves an extremely fast response, enabling in situ imaging of endogenous H2S production and mapping its physiological and pathological consequences. Moreover, the amphiphilic copolymer renders the micellar assembly biocompatible and soluble in aqueous solution. The established FRET-switchable macromolecular envelope around BODInD-Cl and BODIPY1 enables cellular uptake, and makes a breakthrough in the trapping of endogenous H2S generation within raw264.7 macrophages upon stimulation with fluvastatin. This study manifests that cystathione \u03b3-lyase (CSE) upregulation contributes to endogenous H2S generation in fluvastatin-stimulated macrophages, along with a correlation between CSE/H2S and activating Akt signaling pathway.",

    "211": "Ten dry eye and blepharitis (DEB) patients were enroled in a prospective pilot study. All patients were treated with topical atorvastatin (50 \u03bcM) 8 times a day for 4 weeks and allowed to continue with their existing dry eye treatment. The patients were examined weekly for 4 weeks. The primary outcome measure was corneal fluorescein staining. Secondary outcome measures were tear film break-up time (BUT), Schirmer I testing, blepharitis score and bulbar conjunctival injection. The subjective efficacy was evaluated with global symptom and facial analogue scores.", 
    "212": "An improvement in corneal fluorescein staining in the treated eye by >1 point from baseline to completion of the trial at week 4 was found in 9 of 10 patients (p < 0.01). Topical atorvastatin significantly improved the tear film BUT (p < 0.01), blepharitis score (p < 0.05) and bulbar conjunctival injection (p < 0.05). The global symptom score and facial analogue score also improved (p < 0.05). There were no side effects.", 
    "213": "Topical atorvastatin is a potential therapy for DEB patients. Larger comparative clinical studies are required to establish the efficacy and safety of topical atorvastatin.", 
    "214": "To examine the impact of a two-part special edition of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's science journalism program Catalyst (titled Heart of the matter), aired in October 2013, that was critical of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (\"statins\").", 
    "215": "Population-based interrupted time-series analysis of a 10% sample of Australian long-term concessional beneficiaries who were dispensed statins under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (about 51% of all people who were dispensed a statin between 1 July 2009 and 30 June 2014); dispensing of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) was used as a comparator.", 
    "216": "Change in weekly dispensings and discontinuation of use of statins and PPIs, adjusting for seasonal and long-term trends, overall and (for statins only) stratified by the use of cardiovascular and diabetes medicines.", 
    "217": "In our sample, 191 833 people were dispensed an average of 26 946 statins weekly. Following the Catalyst program, there was a 2.60% (95% CI, 1.40%-3.77%; P < 0.001) reduction in statin dispensing, equivalent to 14 005 fewer dispensings Australia-wide every week. Dispensing decreased by 6.03% (95% CI, 3.73%-8.28%; P < 0.001) for people not dispensed other cardiovascular and diabetes medicines and 1.94% (0.42%-3.45%; P = 0.01) for those dispensed diabetes medicines. In the week the Catalyst program aired, there was a 28.8% (95% CI, 15.4%-43.7%; P < 0.001) increase in discontinuation of statin use, which decayed by 9% per week. An estimated 28 784 additional Australians ceased statin treatment. Discontinuation occurred regardless of the use of other cardiovascular and diabetes medicines. There were no significant changes in PPI use after the Catalyst program.", 
    "218": "Following airing of the Catalyst program, there was a temporary increase in discontinuation and a sustained decrease in overall statin dispensing. Up until 30 June 2014, there were 504 180 fewer dispensings of statins, and we estimate this to have affected 60 897 people."
