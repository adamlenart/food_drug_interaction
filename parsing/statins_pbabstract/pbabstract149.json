The ratio was substantially increased (0.93\u00b10.03) in patients with advanced ICAS (\u22653 intracranial stenoses). With a multivariable analysis, the highest apoB/apoAI ratio quartile was an independent predictor of ICAS (OR, 2.13; 95% CI, 1.05 to 4.33). A dose-response relationship was observed between the presence of advanced ICAS and the apoB/apoAI ratio quartiles (OR, 4.03; 95% CI, 1.26 to 12.88 for the second quartile; OR, 4.88; 95% CI, 1.54 to 15.49 for the third quartile; and OR, 7.79; 95% CI, 2.41 to 25.16 for the fourth quartile when referenced to the first quartile).

    "4": "Only few studies have investigated the use of HA in elderly subjects and there are no data in very elderly subjects. We assessed the prescription of HA and analyzed the relationship between such prescriptions and frailty markers among persons aged 80 and more in an observational study. We recorded the prescriptions for 13,211 patients aged 80-109 years and affiliated to the \"Mutualit\u00e9-Sociale-Agricole (MSA)\" of Burgundy over a 1-month period. The prescription of a HA among all included patients, and the existence of serious long-term disease(s) (LTD), polypharmacy or a prescription of cardiovascular drugs among patients receiving a HA were recorder. Among the 13,211 patients, 3412 aged 80-98 years were treated with an HA. The main HA were statins (70.4%), and fibrates were used in 27.3% of cases. Of these 3412 patients, 2250 had one or several LTD mainly coronaropathy, hypertension, diabetes mellitus or peripheral artery disease. The mean number of drugs per prescription was 6.37. Among subjects treated with HA, 40% also received antiplatelets, 35.6% \u03b2-blockers and 30% inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system. For 99% of the patients, the prescription of HA was a renewal. Prescribers were mainly general practitioners (96.8%). Statins are the most widely prescribed HA even among very elderly subjects. However, after 80 years the prescription of HA, mainly statins, decreases with aging. This could be explained by polypathology, polypharmacy and the deterioration in metabolic functions which are markers of frailty. This study should encourage research into the use of statins in very elderly subjects.",

According to World Health Organization adverse reaction terminology, cases were defined as reports of lupus-like syndrome. Each case was matched with 5 noncases by age, gender, and time of reporting. Use of statins was classified according to the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical classification code system. Covariates, ie, use of corticosteroids, immunosuppressive drugs, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antidepressants, antiepileptics, proton pump inhibitors, and cardiovascular drugs, were determined. Multivariate logistic regression was used to calculate the reporting odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals.",

    "9": "We attempted to elucidate the relationship between cholesterol absorption and kidney damage by investigating the renoprotective effect of ezetimibe, a cholesterol absorption inhibitor, in 5/6 nephrectomized rats (Nx). The Nx or sham-operated rats (Sham) were fed 1% high-cholesterol diet (HC) containing ezetimibe (10 mg/[kg d]), pitavastatin (3 mg/[kg d]), or both for 8 weeks. Pathological changes, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) messenger RNA (mRNA), and oxidative stress were assessed in the kidney. The Sham fed HC exhibited hypercholesterolemia and glomerulosclerosis with macrophage infiltration in the kidney, and ezetimibe attenuated these changes. The Nx exhibited hypercholesterolemia, increased urinary 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), glomerulosclerosis with macrophage infiltration and interstitial fibrosis, and downregulation of eNOS mRNA. The HC increased cholesterol further and worsened the kidney damage with increased 8-OHdG. Ezetimibe attenuated the hypercholesterolemia, kidney dysfunction, and pathological changes. The beneficial effects of ezetimibe were significantly associated with reduced 8-OHdG (P < .01). Pitavastatin did not reduce cholesterol or 8-OHdG, but it did significantly suppress the kidney damage with upregulated eNOS mRNA by 2.5-fold (P < .02). The combination of ezetimibe and pitavastatin synergistically ameliorated the kidney damage. The kidney dysfunction and pathological changes were significantly associated with cholesterol, markers of cholesterol absorption (campesterol and cholestanol), and 8-OHdG (P < .001-.05). Multiple regression analysis revealed that the markers of cholesterol absorption were independently associated with the kidney damage. Ezetimibe confers renoprotective effects by inhibiting cholesterol absorption, which in turn reduces oxidative stress; and pitavastatin additively ameliorates kidney damage by increasing NO production via mechanisms independent of cholesterol reduction.",

More recently, experimental studies suggested the potential of simvastatin as a novel therapy for pulmonary hypertension (PH); however, the underlying mechanism remains to be investigated. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether HO-1 is required for the pulmonary vascular protective effects of simvastatin. Simvastatin (2 mg/kg/day) was administered once daily to rats for 4 weeks after monocrotaline (MCT) injection. Zn-protoporphyrin (Znpp), a potent inhibitor of HO, was used to confirm the role of HO-1. The hemodynamic changes, right heart hypertrophy, interleukin-6 (IL-6) level, and HO-1 protein expression in lungs were measured at day 28. Simvastatin significantly ameliorated mean pulmonary arterial hypertension (20.6 mm Hg). In addition, perivascular infiltration of inflammatory cells and the level of IL-6 were decreased in simvastatin treatment group. Simvastatin also increased significantly lung HO-1 protein expression. Inhibiting HO-1 using Znpp resulted in a loss of the effect of simvastatin in MCT rats. These results suggest that HO-1 expression is critical for the vascular protective effects of simvastatin in MCT-induced PH rats.",

Dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate declined significantly only in the S group. Total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol significantly declined only in the S and SM groups. Ongoing reduction of ovarian volume, decreased hirsutism, acne and testosterone were observed between 0 and 3 months as well as between 3 and 6 months. Improvement of lipid profile, C-reactive protein, and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 occurred only during the first 3 months of treatment, with little change thereafter.

    "35": "A novel approach to improve the bioavailability and stability of atorvastatin (AT) was developed by constructing a nano-sized polymer-atorvastatin conjugate. Firstly, a novel chitosan-atorvastatin (CH-AT) conjugate was efficiently synthesized through amide coupling reaction. The formation of conjugate was confirmed by (1)H NMR and FT-IR spectrometry. Nano-sized conjugate with a mean size of 215.3\u00b114.2 nm was prepared by the process of high pressure homogenization (HPH). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed that CH-AT nano-conjugate possess smooth surface whereas X-ray diffraction (XRD) spectra demonstrated amorphous nature of nano-conjugate. Further, CH-AT nano-conjugate showed solubility enhancement of nearly 4-fold and 100-fold compared to CH-AT conjugate and pure AT, respectively. In vitro drug release studies in simulated gastric fluid and simulated intestinal fluid suggested sustained release of AT from the conjugate. Additionally, the nano-conjugate significantly reduced the acidic degradation of AT. The plasma-concentration time profile of AT after oral administration of CH-AT nano-conjugate (2574\u00b195.4 ng/mL) to rat exhibited nearly 5-fold increase in bioavailability compared with AT suspension (583\u00b155.5 ng/mL). Finally, variable bioavailability, as observed for AT suspension was also reduced when AT was administered in form of CH-AT nano-conjugate. Taken together these data demonstrate that chitosan conjugate nano-prodrugs may be used as sustained polymeric prodrugs for enhancing bioavailability.",

Selective inhibitors of geranylgeranyl transferase-1 (GGT1; GGTI-286, 10 \u03bcM) and farnesyl transferase (FT; FTI-277, 10 \u03bcM) were used to determine whether GGT1 and FT contribute to TGF\u03b21-induced fibronectin expression. In addition, we studied the effects of co-incubation with simvastatin and mevalonate (1 mM), geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (30 \u03bcM) or farnesylpyrophosphate (30 \u03bcM).", 
    "38": "Immunoblotting revealed concentration-dependent simvastatin inhibition of TGF\u03b21 (2.5 ng/ml, 48 h)-induced fibronectin. This was prevented by exogenous mevalonate, or isoprenoids (geranylgeranylpyrophosphate or farnesylpyrophosphate). The effects of simvastatin were mimicked by GGTI-286, but not FTI-277, suggesting fundamental involvement of GGT1 in TGF\u03b21-induced signaling. Asthmatic fibroblasts exhibited greater TGF\u03b21-induced fibronectin expression compared to non-asthmatic cells; this enhanced response was effectively reduced by simvastatin.", 
    "39": "We conclude that TGF\u03b21-induced fibronectin expression in airway fibroblasts relies on activity of GGT1 and availability of isoprenoids. Our results suggest that targeting regulators of isoprenoid-dependent signaling holds promise for treating airway wall fibrosis.", 
    "40": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) remains a leading cause of preventable vision loss, despite advances in diabetes care. The burden of DR is likely to increase as the evolving pandemic of type 2 diabetes progresses. Tight control of blood glucose levels and blood pressure are essential for preventing or arresting the development of diabetic retinopathy, but are often difficult to achieve, and DR thus develops in a high proportion of patients. Current treatments for DR such as laser photocoagulation, intravitreous injections of corticosteroids or anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents are indicated for advanced DR and have significant adverse effects. Therefore, new pharmacological treatments for the early stages of DR are needed. The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial included a lipid management arm, in which patients satisfying additional inclusion criteria for the atherogenic dyslipidemia phenotype were randomly assigned to fenofibrate or placebo, each with a statin. In the ACCORD-EYE substudy, randomization to fenofibrate was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of progression of DR. These data confirm and extend the results of the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) study, in which type 2 diabetes patients randomized to fenofibrate benefitted from a significantly lower incidence of laser treatment for retinopathy, progression of retinopathy or a composite measure of retinopathy outcomes. The results of ACCORD-EYE, together with those of FIELD, identify a place for fenofibrate for the prevention of retinopathy alongside intensive management of traditional risk factors, such as hyperglycemia and high blood pressure.", 
    "41": "Statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have beneficial impact on the serum cholesterol and blood pressure. It is supposed that statins and ACE inhibitors may modify the antioxidative status of erythrocytes. The study objective was to compare the effects of two treatments, lisinopril alone vs lisinopril plus simvastatin, on erythrocyte antioxidant enzyme activities. The study involved 32 patients with arterial hypertension, the initial serum total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides within the normal range. Patients of two groups, each of 16 subjects, were treated with lisinopril (10 mg/day) or with lisinopril (10 mg/day) plus simvastatin (20 mg/day). Before and after 3 and 6 months of follow-up therapy, activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione reductase (GLR) in purified erythrocytes were determined. In all patients, significantly higher catalase activity (by 79.3-106.5%, p < 0.0001) and significantly lower GPx activity (by 20.7-30.6%, p < 0.001) were observed after therapy as compared to the baselines. Just the same results were obtained in both groups (lisinopril and lisinopril + simvastatin), after both periods (3 and 6 month) of treatments. SOD activity was increased only in the lisinopril group and only after 6 months (p = 0.0345). No changes of GLR reductase activity were seen under all conditions indicated. Thus, the lisinopril monotherapy and combined lisinopril plus simvastatin therapy exhibit specific, pronounced and equipotent effects on antioxidant enzymes in human erythrocytes. Administration of lisinopril or lisinopril plus simvastatin may protect erythrocytes and other tissues from oxidative damage.", 
    "42": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is still associated with an increased mortality mainly due to an increase in cardiovascular risk. This increase is not solely explained by traditional cardiovascular risk factors but also by disease characteristics, e.g. inflammation, positive rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPA). Control of disease activity with disease-modifying drugs (DMARDs) was shown to reduce cardiovascular risk in RA patients. Use of non-steroidal antirheumatic drugs (NSAIDs) and glucocorticoids might be associated with an increased risk. The EULAR recommendations for cardiovascular risk management in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and other forms of inflammatory arthritis have been established. These recommendations are based on national guidelines regarding control of traditional cardiovascular risk factors.", 
    "43": "Deferoxamine (DFX), a potent iron-chelating agent, reduces brain edema and neuronal cell injury that develop due to the hemolysis cascade. Statins have neuroprotective effects via anti-inflammatory action and increment of cerebral blood flow after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). The purpose of this study was to identify the effects of combined DFX and statins treatment in an experimental ICH rat model. The treatments were: intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of DFX (group I), combined treatment of i.p. DFX and oral statins (group II), statins only (group III) and treatment with vehicle (group IV). Induction of ICH was performed with injection of bacterial collagenase type IV into the left striatum. After removal of the brain, hematoma volume, water content and brain atrophy were measured. Immunohistochemistry in the perihematomal region was performed for identification of microglial infiltration, astrocyte expression and apoptotic cell presence. Statistical analysis was performed using the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test and significance was evaluated when the p value was less than 0.05. According to behavioral tests, significant differences among treatment groups were noted 4 weeks after ICH induction (p < 0.05). However, there were no significant differences among treatment groups in hematoma volume, brain water content or brain atrophy. In the perihematomal area, the activated microglial cells were reduced in the combined treatment group. Among the four groups, a significant difference in immunohistochemical staining was identified (p < 0.05). These results suggest that combined treatment with DFX and statins improves neurologic outcomes after ICH through reduction of microglial infiltration, apoptosis, inflammation and brain edema.",

Unphysiologic loading of articular cartilage was simulated by transecting anterior cruciate ligaments of the right knees of 18 rats consisting of groups 1 and 2. Nine animals in group 2 received orally administered simvastatin 20\u00a0mg/kg per day by gavage for 8\u00a0weeks. Animals in group 3 were sham operated. All animals were sacrificed at postoperative 8\u00a0weeks. Effects of simvastatin on disease progression was evaluated by documenting OA changes in cartilage specimens using Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) OA cartilage histopathology assessment system scores combined with the percentage of MMP-3 expression in chondrocytes.", 
    "46": "Simvastatin treatment significantly down-regulated the percentage of MMP-3 expression in chondrocytes as assessed by immunohistochemistry methods. Suppression of this matrix-degrading enzyme by simvastatin also reduced OARSI scores, suggesting the potential for statins against OA progression.", 
    "47": "Following knee trauma, OA initiates at the molecular level in a short period of time. Irreversible structural changes in cartilage that require demanding treatment strategies led us to focus on effective measures to prevent OA. Statins have immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties independent from their serum-cholesterol-lowering effects. One of these widely used drugs, simvastatin, showed beneficial effects on OA progression and extent by reducing cartilage degradation in our experimental setting. If these results are confirmed by human trials, simvastatin might be considered by orthopedic surgeons as a disease-modifying drug during the early inflammatory phase of posttraumatic OA.",

The aim of this study was to examine whether differences occur between the two forms in affecting fasting serum lipid levels. 150 dyslipidemic statin-treated participants were randomized to corn oil as a placebo or fish oil either as rTAG or EE in identical doses (1.01g EPA+0.67g DHA). No changes in total cholesterol, HDL or LDL levels were observed. In the rTAG-group, but not in the EE-group, fasting serum TAG levels were significantly reduced from baseline after three and six months.

    "57": "THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THE USE OF STATINS IN PREVENTION: an intervention trial evaluating rosuvastatin (JUPITER) study was a real breakthrough in primary cardiovascular disease prevention with statins, since it was conducted in apparently healthy individuals with normal levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C < 130 mg/dL) and increased inflammatory state, reflected by a high concentration of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP \u2265 2 mg/L). These individuals would not have qualified for statin treatment according to current treatment guidelines. In JUPITER, rosuvastatin was associated with significant reductions in cardiovascular outcomes as well as in overall mortality compared with placebo. In this paper the most important secondary analyses of the JUPITER trial are discussed, by focusing on their novel findings regarding the role of statins in primary prevention. Also, the characteristics of otherwise healthy normocholesterolemic subjects who are anticipated to benefit more from statin treatment in the clinical setting are discussed. Subjects at \"intermediate\" or \"high\" 10-year risk according to the Framingham score, those who exhibit low post-treatment levels of both LDL-C (< 70 mg/dL) and hs-CRP (< 1 mg/L), who are 70 years of age or older, as well as those with moderate chronic kidney disease (estimated glomerular filtration rate < 60 mL/min every 1.73 m(2)) are anticipated to benefit more from statin treatment. Unlikely other statin primary prevention trials, JUPITER added to our knowledge that statins may be effective drugs in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in normocholesterolemic individuals at moderate-to-high risk. Also, statin treatment may reduce the risk of venous thromboembolism and preserve renal function. An increase in physician-reported diabetes represents a major safety concern associated with the use of the most potent statins.", 
    "58": "Preeclampsia (PE) is a life-threatening, pregnancy-induced disease and a leading cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Despite considerable research, the causes of PE remain unclear, and there is no effective treatment. Studies in animal models that resemble this complex pregnancy-related disorder may help to identify possible therapies for PE. Complement component C1q has an important role in trophoblast migration, spiral arteries remodeling, and normal placentation. Here we show that pregnant C1q-deficient (C1q(-/-)) mice recapitulate the key features of human PE: hypertension, albuminuria, endotheliosis, decreased placental vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and elevated levels of soluble VEGF receptor 1 (sFlt-1) that correlate with increased fetal death. In addition, decreased blood flow and increased oxidative stress are observed in placentas from C1q(-/-) mice. Treatment of C1q(-/-) mice with pravastatin restored trophoblast invasiveness, placental blood flow, and angiogenic balance and, thus, prevented the onset of PE. Serum-soluble receptors for VEGF-1 levels were reduced and placental VEGF levels were significantly increased in C1q(-/-) mice treated with pravastatin compared with untreated C1q(-/-) mice (VEGF: 1067\u00b1171 versus 419\u00b1194 pg/mL; P<0.01). Pravastatin treatment reduced hypertension (change in mean arterial pressure: 1\u00b11 versus 18\u00b13 mm Hg in C1q(-/-) untreated mice), and albuminuria (of creatinine) was reduced from 820\u00b1175 to 117\u00b145 \u03bcg/mg (both P<0.01). Renal damage and endothelial dysfunction were significantly attenuated with pravastatin. This model that highlights the causative role of impaired trophoblast invasion in the pathogenesis of PE allowed us to identify pravastatin as a good therapeutic option to prevent PE.",

    "73": "X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (XNDI), a severe pathological condition characterized by greatly impaired urine-concentrating ability of the kidney, is caused by inactivating mutations in the V2 vasopressin receptor (V2R) gene. The lack of functional V2Rs prevents vasopressin-induced shuttling of aquaporin-2 (AQP2) water channels to the apical plasma membrane of kidney collecting duct principal cells, thus promoting water reabsorption from urine to the interstitium. At present, no specific pharmacological therapy exists for the treatment of XNDI. We have previously reported that the cholesterol-lowering drug lovastatin increases AQP2 membrane expression in renal cells in vitro. Here we report the novel finding that fluvastatin, another member of the statins family, greatly increases kidney water reabsorption in vivo in mice in a vasopressin-independent fashion. Consistent with this observation, fluvastatin is able to increase AQP2 membrane expression in the collecting duct of treated mice. Additional in vivo and in vitro experiments indicate that these effects of fluvastatin are most likely caused by fluvastatin-dependent changes in the prenylation status of key proteins regulating AQP2 trafficking in collecting duct cells. We identified members of the Rho and Rab families of proteins as possible candidates whose reduced prenylation might result in the accumulation of AQP2 at the plasma membrane. In conclusion, these results strongly suggest that fluvastatin, or other drugs of the statin family, may prove useful in the therapy of XNDI.",

In Group B (n=37), although fluvastatin achieved a significant improvement in baPWV, L/H ratio, and hsCRP, baPWV was significantly greater than that in Group A and showed a significant correlation with that of hsCRP alone after fluvastatin treatment. In a subgroup of patients (n=26), switching from fluvastatin to rosuvastatin further improved baPWV and the L/H ratio without altering hsCRP after 12 months.", 
    "76": "Low-dose rosuvastatin would be more effective than fluvastatin in improving arterial stiffness in high-risk Japanese patients with dyslipidemia. The results suggest that improvement in arterial stiffness by rosuvastatin mainly depends on its strong lipid-lowering effects, whereas that by fluvastatin is strongly dependent on the pleiotropic effects, especially an anti-inflammatory action.", 
    "77": "Subsequent to the clinical trial of simvastatin in patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RR MS), which demonstrated the ability of simvastatin to inhibit new inflammatory CNS lesion formation, the current in vitro study has characterized the mechanisms through which simvastatin inhibits Th17 cell differentiation. The anti-inflammatory effects of statins are mediated by the inhibition of isoprenylation, which ensures proper membrane insertion and function of proteins. Small GTPases, involved in multiple signal transduction pathways, are the key targets for isoprenylation. We report that simvastatin, one of the most hydrophobic statins with good CNS penetration, inhibited Th17 cell differentiation and IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, and IL-22 secretion in in vitro-differentiated naive CD4(+) T cells from RR MS patients. Simvastatin exerted a less prominent effect on the cells from healthy controls, as it inhibited only IL-17F secretion. The inhibition of Th17 cell differentiation was mediated via inhibition of IFN regulatory factor 4 (IRF4) expression, which was identified as a key transcription factor for human Th17 cell differentiation using both IRF4 gene knockdown and overexpression experiments. In studies addressing which isoprenylation pathway--geranylgeranylation or farnesylation--is inhibited by simvastatin, we demonstrated that the geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor replicated the effect of simvastatin. Selective inhibition of geranylgeranylated RhoA-associated kinase replicated the effect of simvastatin on the inhibition of IRF4 expression and IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-21, and IL-22 secretion, presenting a promising new therapeutic approach for this disabling disease.",

Here we investigated the reverse reaction, atorvastatin \u03b4-lactone hydrolysis, in a human liver bank. Screening of microarray data revealed paraoxonases PON1 and PON3 among 17 candidate esterases. Microsomal \u03b4-lactone hydrolysis was significantly correlated to PON1 and PON3 protein (r(s)\u2009=\u20090.60; r(s)\u2009=\u20090.62, respectively; P\u2009<\u20090.0001). PON1 and PON3 were strongly correlated to each other (r(s)\u2009=\u20090.60) but PON1 was shown to be more extensively glycosylated than PON3.

However, carriers of the common PON1 polymorphisms L55M or Q192R showed no difference in \u03b4-lactone hydrolysis or PON expression. Haplotype analysis revealed decreased \u03b4-lactone hydrolysis in carriers of the most common haplotype *1 compared to carriers of haplotypes *2, *3, *4, and *7. Analysis of non-genetic factors showed association of hepatocellular and cholangiocellular carcinoma with decreased PON1 and PON3 expression, respectively. Increased C-reactive protein and \u03b3-glutamyl transferase levels were associated with decreased protein expression of both enzymes, and increased bilirubin levels, cholestasis, and presurgical exposure to omeprazole or pantoprazole were related to decreased PON3 protein. In conclusion, PON-locus polymorphisms affect PON1 expression whereas non-genetic factors have an effect on PON1 and PON3 expression.

Mitochondrial impairments may play an important role in the development of muscular symptoms following statin treatment. Our objective was to characterize mitochondrial function and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in skeletal muscle after exhaustive exercise in atorvastatin-treated rats. The animals were divided into four groups: resting control (CONT; n = 8) and exercise rats (CONT+EXE; n = 8) as well as resting (ATO; n = 10) and exercise (ATO+EXE; n = 8) rats that were treated with atorvastatin (10 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7day(-1) for 2 wk). Exhaustive exercise showed that the distance that was covered by treated animals was reduced (P < 0.05). Using dihydroethidium staining, we showed that the ROS level was increased by 60% in the plantaris muscle of ATO compared with CONT rats and was highly increased in ATO+EXE (226%) compared with that in CONT+EXE rats. The maximal mitochondrial respiration (V(max)) was decreased in ATO rats compared with that in CONT rats (P < 0.01). In CONT+EXE rats, V(max) significantly increased compared with those in CONT rats (P < 0.05). V(max) was significantly lower in ATO+EXE rats (-39%) compared with that in CONT+EXE rats (P < 0.001).

While cholesterol reduction and plaque stabilisation likely play a role in reducing cardiovascular events in ischaemic HF patients, the mechanisms underlying the benefit in non-ischaemic HF patients is less clear. This review suggests the pleiotropic effects of statin therapy can beneficially alter the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the clinical benefit observed in non-ischaemic HF patients.",

Experimental studies demonstrate that increasing optical energy and photosensitizer dose leads to increased volume of tumor necrosis. However, increasing the light dose delivered to the tumor may increase the risks of inducing permanent neurological deficits. In the current study, we sought to test the behavioral deficits induced in normal rats by brain PDT and the neurorestorative effects of atorvastatin on PDT-induced behavioral deficits. Considering its potential as a combination treatment of brain tumors, we investigated both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo whether atorvastatin treatment promotes brain tumor growth. Non-tumored Fischer rats received PDT (n=18). Nine of the PDT-treated animals were treated with atorvastatin. Control animals underwent the same surgical procedure, but did not receive Photofrin and laser light. PDT-treated animals had significant behavioral deficits on days 2, 5, 7, 9 and 14 after PDT, compared with surgery controls. PDT-treated animals receiving atorvastatin displayed significantly ameliorated behavioral deficits on days 7, 9 and 14 after PDT, compared to PDT-treated rats. In\u00a0vitro tumor cell viability and growth were evaluated. Atorvastatin did not affect the growth of glioma cells. Fischer rats with intracranial 7-day-old 9L glioma tumor cell implantation were randomly subjected to no treatment, PDT alone, atorvastatin alone, or combined treatment with atorvastatin and PDT (6\u00a0rats/group). Our data indicate that atorvastatin did not promote tumor growth in either PDT treated and non-treated rats. However, atorvastatin significantly reduced the cell damage caused by PDT. To further test the mechanisms underlying the atorvastatin-mediated reduction of functional deficits, we investigated the effects of atorvastatin on angiogenesis and synaptogenesis. Our data demonstrate that atorvastatin significantly induced angiogenesis and synaptogenesis in the PDT-damaged brain tissue. Our data indicate that PDT induces functional deficits. Atorvastatin treatment promotes functional restoration after PDT, but does not promote glioma growth in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. Atorvastatin reduces astrocyte and endothelial cell damage caused by PDT and induces angiogenesis and synaptogenesis after PDT. Thus consideration and further testing of the combination of atorvastatin and PDT for the treatment of glioma is warranted.",

Simvastatin, a potent inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, suppressed 15(S)-HETE-induced Rac1 activation in HDMVECs affecting their migration and tube formation. 15(S)-HETE by inducing HMG-CoA reductase expression caused increased farnesylation and membrane translocation of Rac1 where it became activated by Src-dependent \u03b1Pix stimulation. Mevalonate rescued 15(S)-HETE-induced Rac1 farnesylation and membrane translocation in HDMVECs and the migration and tube formation of these cells from inhibition by simvastatin. Down-regulation of \u03b1Pix inhibited 15(S)-HETE-induced HDMVEC migration and tube formation. Hind-limb ischemia induced Rac1 farnesylation and activation leading to increased angiogenesis and these effects were blocked by simvastatin and rescued by mevalonate in WT mice. In contrast, hind-limb ischemia failed to induce Rac1 farnesylation and activation as well as angiogenic response in 12/15-Lox(-/-) mice. Activation of Src and \u03b1Pix were also compromised at least to some extent in 12/15-Lox(-/-) mice compared with WT mice in response to hind-limb ischemia.

The association remained significant after adjusting for more covariates (P = 0.002), but was attenuated after further adjusting for glycosylated hemoglobin, insulin resistance index, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (P = 0.043). The use of lovastatin, rosuvastatin, and cerivastatin was associated with lower total bilirubin levels in the full adjustment model (P < 0.05).",

Our results do not suggest that the anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of statins are due to HO-1 induction and increased serum bilirubin levels.", 
    "177": "Statins are widely used to prevent cardiovascular diseases. They are well-tolerated, with side-effects mainly seen in skeletal muscle. How these side-effects are caused is unknown. We compared isolated primary mouse skeletal muscle myocytes, C2C12 myotubes and liver HepG2 cells to detect differences that could uncover why statins are toxic in skeletal muscle but less so in the liver. 10\u03bcM simvastatin caused a decrease in mitochondrial respiration in the primary mouse myocytes and C2C12 myotubes, but had no effect in the HepG2 cells. Mitochondrial integrity is maintained by multiple signaling pathways. One of these pathways, Igf-1/Akt signaling, is also heavily implicated in causing statin-induced toxicity by upregulating atrogin-1. We found that phosphorylated Akt was reduced in C2C12 myotubes but not in HepG2 cells. HepG2 mitochondrial respiration became susceptible to simvastatin-treatment after Akt inhibition, and mitochondrial respiration was rescued in Igf-1-treated C2C12 myotubes. These results suggest that disruption of Igf-1/Akt signaling is a causative factor in simvastatin-induced mitochondrial dysfunction in C2C12 myotubes, whereas HepG2 cells are protected by maintaining Igf-1/Akt signaling. We conclude that phosphorylation of Akt is a key indicator of susceptibility to statin-induced toxicity. How statins can disrupt Igf-1/Akt signaling is unknown. Statins reduce geranylgeranylation of small GTPases, such as Rap1. Previous studies implicate Rap1 as a link between cAMP/Epac and Igf-1/Akt signaling. Transient transfection of constitutively active Rap1 into C2C12 myotubes led to a partial rescue of simvastatin-induced inhibition of mitochondrial respiration, providing a novel link between signaling and respiration.",

Despite this, little is known about the risk factors for hyperlipidemia or the role of lipid-lowering therapy early after transplantation. We performed a retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute from 1998 to 2008 and who survived more than 100 days. The incidence of hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia in the first 2 years after transplantation was 73.4% and 72.5%, respectively. In multivariable analysis, the development of acute graft-versus-host disease was independently associated with both hypercholesterolemia (odds ratio [OR] = 1.62) and hypertriglyceridemia (OR = 1.54) after transplantation. Statin use was instituted in 29% of patients and was associated with a significant net reduction in total cholesterol (65 mg/dL, P < .0001), triglyceride (118 mg/dL P < .0001), and LDL levels (59 mg/dL P < .0001) without any significant adverse effects. These data suggest that hyperlipidemia is common in the first 2 years after allogeneic transplantation when most patients remain under the care of the transplantation physician and lipid-lowering therapy may be underutilized. Given the cardiovascular risk associated with hyperlipidemia and the tolerability of statins, further prospective evaluation of lipid abnormalities and their treatment seems well warranted.",

In response to these data, the US Food and Drug Administration label for rosuvastatin in primary prevention came closest to the actual JUPITER trial population by stipulating that those eligible for treatment should be older men and women with hsCRP >2 mg/L, plus one additional risk factor for heart disease. The Canadian label is silent on age and hsCRP (the major trial inclusion criterion), stipulating instead that treatment can be considered for those with 'at least two conventional risk factors for cardiovascular disease,' a group more inclusive than that studied. In contrast, the European Medicines Agency label limits treatment only to 'high risk individuals' ignoring hsCRP and using instead a post hoc definition of 'high risk' that comprised a subgroup of less than 10% of the study population who contributed but 67 events to the study total and did not show statistical significance when compared to placebo.

    "202": "Total cholesterol levels in whole populations have fallen substantially in the USA, UK and most other developed countries. This has greatly contributed to decreases in cardiovascular disease deaths. The evidence identifying diet as the major contributor to these historical falls in cholesterol is powerful and consistent. Large falls occurred before statins were introduced. Additional substantial falls occurred before statins were widely used.Now, up to 14% adults in Western populations currently receive statins for primary prevention. Furthermore, because diet is now only slowly improving, the statin contribution currently appears proportionately larger.",

Furthermore, many middle income countries may have neither the resources nor the infrastructure for mass statin therapy.Further substantial falls in cholesterol are therefore unlikely to be obtained simply by increased use of statins or dietary advice to individuals if unsupported by the wider environment. This further emphasises the need for more effective structural policies.

We hypothesised that pre-treatment with high-dose atorvastatin, on a background of chronic standard 'statin' therapy, would reduce myocardial injury in patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. One hundred and one consenting patients undergoing elective CABG surgery at a single tertiary cardiac centre were recruited into two randomised controlled, single-blinded clinical studies. Study 1: 45 patients were randomised to receive either 160\u00a0mg of atorvastatin 2\u00a0h preoperatively and 24\u00a0h following surgery or their standard statin therapy.

The biosynthesis of rubber is dependent on isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) precursors derived from the mevalonate (MVA) pathway. The cDNA sequences of seven MVA pathway genes from latex of T. brevicorniculatum were isolated, including three cDNA sequences encoding for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductases (TbHMGR1-3). Expression analyses indicate an important role of TbHMGR1 as well as for the HMG-CoA synthase (TbHMGS), the diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase and the mevalonate kinase in the provision of precursors for rubber biosynthesis. The amino acid sequences of the TbHMGRs show the typical motifs described for plant HMGRs such as two transmembrane domains and a catalytic domain containing two HMG-CoA and two NADP(H) binding sites. The functionality of the HMGRs was demonstrated by complementation assay using an IPP auxotroph mutant of Escherichia coli. Furthermore, the transient expression of the catalytic domains of TbHMGR1 and TbHMGR2 in Nicotiana benthamiana resulted in a strong accumulation of sterol precursors, one of the major groups of pathway end-products.",

Although statins have been widely used to lower serum cholesterol levels, the effect of these drugs on diabetic nephropathy has not been fully elucidated. In the present study, therefore, we addressed the role of different kinds of statins on diabetic nephropathy in db/db mice. Mice were fed with a standard diet with 0.005% (w/w) of pitavastatin, rosuvastatin, and pravastatin for 8 weeks starting from 8 weeks of age. The treatment with statins did not affect the food intake, body weight gain, adiposity, or blood pressure in db/db mice. Treatment with statins also had no effect on plasma lipid levels. In terms of the effect on albuminuria, pitavastatin and rosuvastatin reduced the urinary excretion of albumin by 60 and 40%, respectively, but not pravastatin, suggesting the effect of these two drugs on diabetic nephropathy. Furthermore, pitavastatin and rosuvastatin improved glomerular hypertrophy. All statins treatment improved insulin resistance. In addition, rosuvastatin and pravastatin treatment reduced oxidative stress measured by urinary 8-OHdG level, whereas the statins had no effect on the inflammatory response in the kidney of db/db mice. These results are not consistent with the renoprotective effect of statins. In conclusion, our data suggest that pitavastatin and rosuvastatin can improve diabetic nephropathy through the suppression of glomerular hypertrophy, independent of lipid-lowering or anti-oxidative effects.", 
    "218": "Normal tissue damage limits the efficacy of anticancer therapy. For anthracyclines, the clinically most relevant adverse effect is cardiotoxicity. The mechanisms involved are poorly understood and putative cardioprotectants are controversially discussed. Here, we show that the lipid-lowering drug lovastatin protects rat H9c2 cardiomyoblasts from doxorubicin in vitro. Protection by lovastatin is related to inhibition of the Ras-homologous GTPase Rac1. It rests on a reduced formation of DNA double-strand breaks, resulting from the inhibition of topoisomerase II by doxorubicin. Doxorubicin transport and reactive oxygen species are not involved. Protection by lovastatin was confirmed in vivo. In mice, lovastatin mitigated acute doxorubicin-induced heart and liver damage as indicated by reduced mRNA levels of the pro-fibrotic cytokine connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, respectively. Lovastatin also protected from doxorubicin-provoked subacute cardiac damage as shown by lowered mRNA levels of CTGF and atrial natriuretic peptide. Increase in the serum concentration of troponin I and cardiac fibrosis following doxorubicin treatment were also reduced by lovastatin. Whereas protecting the heart from harmful doxorubicin effects, lovastatin augmented its anticancer efficacy in a mouse xenograft model with human sarcoma cells. These data show that statins lower the incidence of cardiac tissue injury after anthracycline treatment in a Rac1-dependent manner, without impairing the therapeutic efficacy.", 
    "219": "Clearance of atorvastatin occurs through hepatic uptake by organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) and subsequent metabolism by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4. To demonstrate the relative importance of OATPs and CYP3A4 in the hepatic elimination of atorvastatin in vivo, a clinical cassette microdose study was performed. A cocktail consisting of a microdose of atorvastatin along with probe substrates for OATPs (pravastatin) and CYP3A4 (midazolam) was orally administered to eight healthy volunteers. The pharmacokinetics of this cocktail was observed at baseline, after an oral dose of 600 mg rifampicin (an inhibitor of OATPs), and after an intravenous dose of 200 mg itraconazole (a CYP3A4 inhibitor). Rifampicin increased the pravastatin dose-normalized area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) (4.6-fold), and itraconazole significantly increased the midazolam dose-normalized AUC (1.7-fold). The atorvastatin dose-normalized AUC increased 12-fold when coadministered with rifampicin but did not change when coadministered with itraconazole. These results indicate that hepatic uptake via OATPs makes the dominant contribution to the hepatic elimination of atorvastatin at a subtherapeutic microdose.",

AIM-HIGH (Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic syndrome with Low HDL/High Triglycerides and Impact on Global Health Outcomes), a trial of statin/niacin, has been prematurely halted for futility.

Osteoclast differentiation is an important factor related to the pathogenesis of bone-loss related diseases. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) acts as a signal mediator in osteoclast differentiation. Simvastatin, which inhibits 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A, is a hypolipidemic drug which is known to affect bone metabolism and suppresses osteoclastogenesis induced by receptor activator of nuclear factor-\u03baB ligand (RANKL). In this study, we analyzed whether simvastatin can inhibit RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis through suppression of the subsequently formed ROS and investigated whether simvastatin can inhibit H2O2-induced signaling pathways in osteoclast differentiation. We found that simvastatin decreased expression of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), a genetic marker of osteoclast differentiation, and inhibited intracellular ROS generation in RAW 264.7 cell lines. ROS generation activated NF-\u03baB, protein kinases B (AKT), mitogen-activated protein kinases signaling pathways such as c-JUN N-terminal kinases, p38 MAP kinases as well as extracellular signal- regulated kinase. Simvastatin was found to suppress these H2O2-induced signaling pathways in osteoclastogenesis. Together, these results indicate that simvastatin acts as an osteoclastogenesis inhibitor through suppression of ROS-mediated signaling pathways. This indicates that simvastatin has potential usefulness for osteoporosis and pathological bone resorption.",

Study patients with ART-induced elevated non-HDL cholesterol levels (> 160 mg/dL) were enrolled. Participants received packets of freeze-dried P. ostreatus (15 gm/day) to be administered orally for the 8 week trial period. Lipid levels were drawn every two weeks to assess efficacy. Safety assessments included self-reported incidence of muscle aches and measurement of liver and muscle enzymes. Mean within-person change in lipid levels were estimated using generalized estimating equations to account for repeated observations on individuals. A 30 mg/dL decrease in non-HDL cholesterol was deemed clinically significant.", 
    "226": "126 patients were screened to enroll 25, of which 20 completed the 8-week study. The mean age was 46.4 years (36-60). Patients had a mean 13.7 yrs of HIV infection. Mean non-HDL cholesterol was 204.5 mg/dL at day 0 and 200.2 mg/dL at day 56 (mean within-person change = -1.70; 95% confidence interval (CI) = -17.4, 14.0). HDL cholesterol levels increased from 37.8 mg/dL at day 0 to 40.4 mg/dL on day 56 (mean within-person change = 2.6; 95% CI = -0.1, 5.2). Triglycerides dropped from 336.4 mg/dL on day 0 to 273.4 mg/dL on day 56 (mean within-person change = -63.0; 95% CI = -120.9, -5.1). Only 3 individuals achieved a sustained clinically significant (30 mg/dL) decline in non-HDL cholesterol after 8 weeks of therapy. There were no adverse experiences reported other than patients' distaste for the preparation. Liver function tests and muscle enzymes were not affected by the 8 weeks of treatment.", 
    "227": "Pleurotus ostreatus as administered in this experiment did not lower non-HDL cholesterol in HIV patients with ART-induced hypercholesterolemia. Small changes in HDL and triglycerides were not of a clinical magnitude to warrant further study.", 
    "228": "Statins are inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis. The inhibition of this key enzyme in the mevalonate pathway leads to suppression of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis. However, the molecular mechanism of apoptosis induction by statins is not well understood in glioblastoma. In the present study, we attempted to elucidate the mechanism by which statins induce apoptosis in C6 glioma cells.", 
    "229": "The cytotoxicity of statins toward the C6 glioma cells were evaluated using a cell viability assay. The enzyme activity of caspase-3 was determined using activity assay kits. The effects of statins on signal transduction molecules were determined by western blot analyses.", 
    "230": "We found that statins inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in these cells. We also observed an increase in caspase-3 activity. The apoptosis induced by statins was not inhibited by the addition of farnesyl pyrophosphate, squalene, ubiquinone, and isopentenyladenine, but by geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate (GGPP). Furthermore, statins decreased the levels of phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and Akt.", 
    "231": "These results suggest that statins induce apoptosis when GGPP biosynthesis is inhibited and consequently decreases the level of phosphorylated ERK1/2 and Akt. The results of this study also indicate that statins could be used as anticancer agents in glioblastoma.", 
    "232": "In aging men, serum endogenous testosterone is inversely associated with common carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and directly with beneficial plasma lipid levels; however, the relationship to endothelial function is poorly characterized. We examined the association between serum testosterone and endothelium-dependent brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) in middle-aged to elderly men. A group of 83 men aged 40?69 years (mean 55.9 \u00b1 7.5 [SD]) with andropausal symptoms were studied. We measured their serum lipids, testosterone, luteinizing hormone, mean carotid IMT and brachial artery FMD by high resolution B-mode ultrasound. Brachial FMD correlated inversely with vessel diameter (r = -0.38, p = 0.0004), alcohol consumption (r = -0.22, p = 0.047) and serum testosterone (r = -0.27, p = 0.01), but not with luteinizing hormone. In multivariate analysis, FMD was explained by testosterone (\u03b2 = -0.17, p = 0.0226), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (\u03b2 = 4.17, p = 0.0312) and vessel diameter (\u03b2 = -4.37, p < 0.0001) when adjusted for age, body mass index, triglycerides, blood pressure, carotid IMT, smoking, alcohol consumption, cardiovascular diseases and use of lipid lowering medication (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors). In middle-aged to elderly men, there is an inverse correlation between serum testosterone and brachial FMD. These data suggest that testosterone may have an adverse effect on systemic endothelial function.", 
    "233": "Recent evidence suggests that lower HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) may worsen the atherosclerotic process by promoting inflammation and progression from subclinical lesion to clinical event. Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) is recognized as a marker of early atherosclerosis and used to predict future vascular events. Among the common lipid parameters, LDL has strongest relation with carotid plaque. Cumulative effect of achieving optimal levels of LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides and blood pressure is a reduced risk of recurrent stroke and major cardiovascular events. The protective effect of higher HDL-C is maintained at low levels of LDL-C. Studies have demonstrated a trend toward a higher risk of stroke with lower HDL-C and support HDL-C as an important modifiable stroke risk factor. In patients with recent stroke or transient ischemic attack and no coronary heart disease, only lower baseline HDL-C predicted the risk of recurrent stroke. Substantial amount of residual cardiovascular risk remains in patients treated with statins due to elevated triglycerides and low HDL-C, even when LDL-C is well controlled. Niacin promotes significant increase in HDL-C and reduces cardiovascular risk. By combining niacin with the LDL-lowering therapy of statins, the progression of atherosclerosis is slowed down and residual cardiovascular and risk of stroke is reduced. Non-pharmacological control of serum lipids includes regular physical activity and modification in daily diet. In primary prevention, when HDL-C is below the average and other risk factors are present, a statin added to non-pharmacological therapy is appropriate choice. Fibrate therapy may be appropriate in men with manifest coronary disease with isolated low HDL-C. If HDL-C remains low, with or without high triglyceride levels, a fibrate or niacin may be added."
