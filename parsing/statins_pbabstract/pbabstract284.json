We designed the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) study to assess the effect of fenofibrate on cardiovascular disease events in these patients.", 
    "1": "We did a multinational, randomised controlled trial with 9795 participants aged 50-75 years, with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and not taking statin therapy at study entry. After a placebo and a fenofibrate run-in phase, we randomly assigned patients (2131 with previous cardiovascular disease and 7664 without) with a total-cholesterol concentration of 3.0-6.5 mmol/L and a total-cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio of 4.0 or more or plasma triglyceride of 1.0-5.0 mmol/L to micronised fenofibrate 200 mg daily (n=4895) or matching placebo (n=4900). Our primary outcome was coronary events (coronary heart disease death or non-fatal myocardial infarction); the outcome for prespecified subgroup analyses was total cardiovascular events (the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and coronary and carotid revascularisation). Analysis was by intention to treat. The study was prospectively registered (number ISRCTN 64783481).", 
    "2": "Vital status was confirmed on all but 22 patients. Averaged over the 5 years' study duration, similar proportions in each group discontinued study medication (10% placebo vs 11% fenofibrate) and more patients allocated placebo (17%) than fenofibrate (8%; p<0.0001) commenced other lipid treatments, predominantly statins. 5.9% (n=288) of patients on placebo and 5.2% (n=256) of those on fenofibrate had a coronary event (relative reduction of 11%; hazard ratio [HR] 0.89, 95% CI 0.75-1.05; p=0.16). This finding corresponds to a significant 24% reduction in non-fatal myocardial infarction (0.76, 0.62-0.94; p=0.010) and a non-significant increase in coronary heart disease mortality (1.19, 0.90-1.57; p=0.22). Total cardiovascular disease events were significantly reduced from 13.9% to 12.5% (0.89, 0.80-0.99; p=0.035). This finding included a 21% reduction in coronary revascularisation (0.79, 0.68-0.93; p=0.003). Total mortality was 6.6% in the placebo group and 7.3% in the fenofibrate group (p=0.18). Fenofibrate was associated with less albuminuria progression (p=0.002), and less retinopathy needing laser treatment (5.2%vs 3.6%, p=0.0003). There was a slight increase in pancreatitis (0.5%vs 0.8%, p=0.031) and pulmonary embolism (0.7%vs 1.1%, p=0.022), but no other significant adverse effects.", 
    "3": "Fenofibrate did not significantly reduce the risk of the primary outcome of coronary events. It did reduce total cardiovascular events, mainly due to fewer non-fatal myocardial infarctions and revascularisations. The higher rate of starting statin therapy in patients allocated placebo might have masked a moderately larger treatment benefit.",

The relation between statin therapy at discharge and clinical outcome was evaluated in these patients. Compared with patients who were not discharged on statins, those who were had a lower incidence of death, reinfarction, or stroke at 6 months (29.0% vs 9.5%, p=0.005). These results suggest that patients who have an acute coronary syndrome and a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level<or=80 mg/dl in the absence of statin therapy may benefit from such therapy at discharge.",

Study 2--Rats were divided into two groups, control and cerivastatin groups, which had 0.1 mg/kg cerivastatin intravenously after anesthesia. LAD was occluded for 10, 15, or 20 minutes.

    "9": "Hyperhomocysteinemia is regarded as an independent risk factor for vascular diseases, and homocysteine is supposed to contribute to oxidative stress and endothelial damage. Statin therapy is an established intervention to reduce the risk of acute events in patients suffering from cardiovascular diseases. Apart from their lipid-lowering capacity, statins also exert anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects. As cellular immune activation and oxidative stress play a major role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases, the anti-inflammatory capacity of statins could partly be responsible for the beneficial effects observed in patients. Earlier we reported that stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) release homocysteine. Here we studied the influence of atorvastatin on homocysteine production in stimulated PBMCs and compared changes in cysteine concentrations and in neopterin production, which is a sensitive indicator of cellular immune activation. Stimulation of human PBMCs with the mitogens concanavalin A and phytohemagglutinin induced significant homocysteine and neopterin production compared to unstimulated cells, whereas cysteine concentrations remained unchanged. Treatment of PBMCs with increasing doses of atorvastatin (10-100 microM) suppressed both biochemical pathways in a dose-dependent manner, and cell proliferation was inhibited in parallel. Again, cysteine levels were not influenced by any treatment. The down-regulating effect of atorvastatin on homocysteine formation in vitro indicates that statins may prevent homocysteine accumulation in the blood via immunosuppression.",

Genomic DNA was extracted from blood leukocytes using a salting-out method and APOA1 polymorphisms were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism.", 
    "12": "G-75A polymorphism was associated with differences in serum concentrations of triglyceride and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-cholesterol (p=0.026) in HC men. After atorvastatin treatment, women carrying the GG/CC haplotype had lower serum triglyceride and VLDL-cholesterol (p=0.020) than non-carriers. In men, the reduction in serum triglyceride in response to atorvastatin was found to be slightly lower in GG/CC haplotype carriers (p=0.051).",

    "14": "Statins play an important role in the treatment and prevention of coronary artery disease and atherosclerosis. Currently, however, despite its important qualities, the use of statin therapy in the treatment of CAD patients ranges only between 30 and 60% in Europe, the United States and Israel. A wide gap still exists between the numerous scientific publications demonstrating the beneficial effects of statins and the low rate of implementing the guidelines in practice. A Medline search up to June 2005 on all prospective, double-blind, randomized clinical trials evaluating the impact of intensive statin therapy (any statin dose >40 mg/daily) on clinical outcomes after a 1 year follow-up revealed only eight trials. In all the eight trials, with a follow-up period of 12-60 months, intensive statin therapy was significantly more effective than and at least as safe as placebo or other standard statin regimens. Thus, based on the current evidence-based medicine, intensive statin therapy enables more patients with CAD to achieve the current National Cholesterol Education Program goal for low density lipoprotein, while ensuring a relatively high safety profile.",

Average LDL-C reductions of 32% (37% for high-risk patients) were initially required to reach goal. At the study visit, patients had been treated for an average of 4.3 years and 24.2% were using a high statin dose. Despite statin therapy, 27.2% of all patients and 36.4% of those at high CAD risk had not achieved LDL-C targets. For 67.4% of these patients, the current therapy was not modified at the study visit.",

The effect of pravastatin on betaig-h3 expression was evaluated using in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and immunoblotting. Functional parameters, histopathology (tubulointerstitial fibrosis, TIF, and arteriolopathy), and levels of transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase were compared for the different treatment groups.", 
    "22": "Co-administration of pravastatin significantly inhibited betaig-h3 mRNA production and gene expression within the tubulointerstitium of the CsA-treated kidneys, and this paralleled an attenuation of TIF (12.7 +/- 2.2 vs. 35.9 +/- 5.4%, p < 0.01 vs. CsA) and the expression of TGF-beta1 mRNA (279 +/- 40 vs. 719 +/- 85%, p < 0.01 vs. CsA). Pravastatin treatment reduced endothelial nitric oxide synthase protein levels and reversed the renal dysfunction caused by CsA. Neither CsA nor pravastatin affected total serum cholesterol or triglyceride levels in the treatment groups.",

Pitavastatin enhanced the migration, proliferation and viability of HMVECs at a low concentration (0.01 micromol/L) but inhibited them at high concentration (1 micromol/L). The inhibitory effect on cell viability by high concentration of pitavastatin was recovered by geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, but the effect on migration and proliferation was not. The cell activating effect of a low concentration of pitavastatin was reversed by both farnesyl pyrophosphate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. A quail chorioallantoic membrane assay showed that high concentration (1 micromol/L) of pitavastatin reduced fibroblast growth factor-2-induced angiogenesis, whereas low concentration (0.3 micromol/L) tended to increase angiogenesis.",

A significant positive correlation was found between pre-interventional CRP level and NIH area (r=0.52, p<0.001). In patients with normal CRP, an association between statin therapy and restenosis was not observed. However, when the analysis was confined to patients with elevated CRP, statin therapy significantly reduced the restenosis rate (20% vs 37.5%, p=0.031). In the normal CRP group, the intra-stent neointimal area at 6 months was not different between the non-statin and statin groups (2.2+/-1.4 mm2 vs 1.8+/-1.1 mm2).

Use of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor antagonists either individually or in combination, certain beta-receptor blockers, and judicious use of aldosterone antagonists, has reduced hospital admission rates and mortality from CHF with reduced LV ejection fraction. More clinical trials are needed, however, particularly in patients with CHF and preserved LV ejection fraction. In patients who remain symptomatic despite medical therapy, and who have long QRS intervals (>0.12 s) and markedly reduced LV ejection fraction, the value of cardiac resynchronization therapy with a biventricular pacemaker has now been demonstrated. Yet, morbidity and mortality remain high, indicating a major need for further improvement. Novel therapies include medical management with statins, vasopressin antagonists, erythropoietin, oxypurinol and levosimendan, which improve vascular and myocardial function and reduce fluid overload, in addition to surgical approaches, which reduce LV remodeling. These routes might not, however, suffice in patients with CHF and LV dysfunction. Prevention of apoptosis and particularly regeneration of cardiac muscle would represent a shift of the current paradigm. Stem-cell-based therapies are rapidly evolving, and while basic science is needed to optimize these strategies, medium-sized clinical studies could help to verify the beneficial effects on LV function. In this review, we discuss current treatment methods and new strategies to improve treatment of CHF.", 
    "43": "The objective of the present study was to investigate the glass forming capability of a model drug simvastatin. The glassy material produced by melt quench technique was subjected to physico-chemical characterization and subsequent stability and enthalpy relaxation study. The chemical stability of drug during preparation of glass was tested by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and Infrared (IR) spectroscopy. The presence of amorphous form was confirmed by DSC and XRPD. Surprisingly, glassy simvastatin was almost stable throughout the period of stability, inspite of its Tg being relatively low. The stability and very low enthalpy recovery of glassy simvastatin perhaps could be attributed to strong inter-molecular hydrogen bonding.",

The aim of this study was to detect and quantify the changes of endothelial expression of VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 in the vessel wall after the short-term administration of simvastatin, atorvastatin, and micro dispersed derivatives of oxidised cellulose (MDOC) in apolipoprotein-E-deficient (apoE(-/-)) mice atherosclerotic model. Hyperlipidemic apoE(-/-) mice (n = 32) received normal chow diet or diet containing simvastatin or atorvastatin 10 mg/kg/day or MDOC 50 mg/kg/day. Total cholesterol, VLDL, LDL, HDL and TAG were measured and the endothelial expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 was visualized and quantified by means of immunohistochemistry and stereology, respectively. Total cholesterol levels was insignificantly lowered only in MDOC treated mice but not in mice treated with statins. ICAM-1 endothelial expression was not affected by neither simvastatin nor MDOC treatment. However, significant diminution of VCAM-1 endothelial expression was observed in both atorvastatin and MDOC treated mice. These results provide new information of potential hypolipidemic substance MDOC and its potential anti-inflammatory effects. Furthermore, we have confirmed anti-inflammatory effects of atorvastatin independent of plasma cholesterol lowering. Thus, the results of this study show potential benefit of both MDOC and atorvastatin treatment in apoE(-/-) mouse model of atherosclerosis suggesting their possible combination might be of interest.",

Dose optimization studies revealed 600 microg of beta-CA and 750 microg of AVN significantly (p<0.05) inhibited the synthesis of sphingosine and cholesterol, respectively and prevented their replenishment to normal levels till 48 hr in viable rat skin. Co-application of calcium chloride (0.1 mM) inhibited the synthesis of both micro constituents of epidermis to a greater magnitude, whereas verapamil reduced this effect. The in vitro permeation of levodopa across treated skin portions was directly correlated with percentage of sphingosine and cholesterol inhibited by the treatments. The in vitro permeation of levodopa across skin excised after treatment with beta-CA or AVN was enhanced 3-fold. Effective plasma concentration (1.58 microg/ml) of levodopa in rats was achieved within 2 hr and maintained till 12 hr after AVN treatment, and increased to 36 hr with the co-application of calcium chloride. However, when the skin was treated with beta-CA, Ceff was achieved after 4 hr and was maintained till 36 hr. The inclusion of calcium chloride maintained Ceff for 48 hr. Hence, synthesis inhibition of skin lipids seems to offer a feasible means to enhance the systemic delivery of polar drugs like levodopa.", 
    "47": "Atrial fibrillation is the most prevalent sustained cardiac arrhythmia. To terminate or prevent atrial fibrillation, conventional \"channel-blocking antiarrhythmics\" are generally administered, which directly inhibit current flows through transmembrane sodium, calcium and/or potassium channels that give rise to the atrial action potential. However, prospective, randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that cardiomyocyte ion channel blocking antiarrhythmic drugs have limited long-term-efficacy for preventing recurrences of atrial fibrillation, their safety is far from ideal (because of the high incidence of proarrhythmic and extracardiac side-effects), and do not reduce mortality. Researchers during the last 10 years have revealed that the pathogenetic basis of the recurrence, persistence or permanence of atrial fibrillation is electrical and structural remodelling established by profound alterations in the electrophysiological, contractile and (ultra)structural properties of the myocardium (atrial remodelling). Accordingly, recent interest has shifted from ion channel blockers to the development of drugs that target underlying arrhythmogenic substrates by interference with receptors and specific signal transduction pathways involved in electrical and structural remodelling (non-channel drugs). They include antifibrotic angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II AT1 receptor and aldosterone antagonists, beta-adrenergic blockers, anti-inflammatory statins and glucocorticoids, and a series of new atrioselective antifibrillatory agents that are currently undergoing clinical trials.",

Conventional revascularization therapies reduce the risk of further ischemia but do not affect the underlying atherosclerotic disease. Statins have a proven record in the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. Furthermore, statins have been shown to exert varying degrees of pleiotropic effects, which may stabilize vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques. A compelling body of evidence from randomized controlled trials demonstrates that high-dose, potent statin therapy initiated immediately after an acute coronary event can significantly reduce early as well as longer-term morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, high-dose, potent statin therapy displays a reasonable safety profile. National guidelines now recommend that in patients with ACS, statin therapy should be initiated in hospital prior to discharge, irrespective of baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, to improve clinical outcomes. Every effort should be made to ensure all eligible patients with ACS are initiated and maintained on statin therapy.",

The ALERT study is the first trial to evaluate the effect of statin therapy on cardiac outcomes following renal transplantation. Patients initially randomized to fluvastatin or placebo in the 5-6 year ALERT study were offered open-label fluvastatin XL 80 mg/day in a 2-year extension to the original study. The primary endpoint was time to first major adverse cardiac event (MACE). Of 1787 patients who completed ALERT, 1652 (92%) were followed in the extension. Mean total follow-up was 6.7 years. Mean LDL-cholesterol was 98 mg/dL (2.5 mmol/L) at last follow-up compared to a pre-study level of 159 mg/dL (4.1 mmol/L). Patients randomized to fluvastatin had a reduced risk of MACE (hazards ratio [HR] 0.79, 95% CI 0.63-0.99, p = 0.036), and a 29% reduction in cardiac death or definite non-fatal MI (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.55-0.93, p = 0.014). Total mortality and graft loss did not differ significantly between groups. Fluvastatin produces a safe and effective reduction in LDL-cholesterol associated with reduced risk of MACE in RTR. The lipid-lowering and cardiovascular benefits of fluvastatin are comparable to those of statins in other patient groups, and support use of fluvastatin in RTR.", 
    "62": "Increasing comorbidity with aging reduces the predictive power of cardiovascular risk factors. From the age of 70 onward, total cholesterol levels decrease, perhaps associated with changes in the composition of some lipoprotein fractions. In subjects older than 75 years, being in the lowest quartile of cholesterol, insulinemia or serum albumin concentrations is associated with increased mortality. Cholesterol levels below 189 mg/dL in subjects older than 75 years should be considered an early sign of unidentified comorbidity or of rapid functional decline. HDL cholesterol levels, rather than total or LDL cholesterol, were inversely associated with increased mortality from ischemic coronary disease and stroke appears to rise as HDL cholesterol levels fall, rather than total or LDL cholesterol. On the other hand, LDL concentrations below 106 mg/dL and HDL concentrations below 36 mg/dL were associated with an increased risk of death from infectious disease. Stroke incidence, in particular, ischemic stroke, is highest in subjects older than 75 years. HDL cholesterol levels above 35 mg/dL appear to have a protective effect against ischemic stroke in subjects younger than 70 years. Two interventional drug studies investigating the effects of two statins (simvastatin and pravastatin) found that in subgroups of subjects older than 75 these drugs were associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality and cardiovascular morbidity, regardless of total cholesterol levels, but had no short-term effect on cognitive function.",

CCK enhanced the levels of these proteins, and the levels of Src and RhoA were reduced by the Src inhibitor herbimycin A and the Rho inhibitor pravastatin. The PI3-K inhibitor wortmannin reduced the level of PI3-K. These inhibitors also decreased amylase secretion in CCK-treated pancreatic acini without altering basal secretion. Immunoprecipitation studies indicated that CCK caused Src to associate with Vav-2, RhoA, and PI3-K and RhoA and Src to associate with Vav-2. Ras, RasGAP, and SOS did not coimmunoprecipitate with Vav-2, and RasGAP and SOS did not coimmunoprecipitate with RhoA. CCK also enhanced Vav-2 and RhoA to coimmunoprecipitate with G(alpha13). We conclude that CCK stimulates the recruitment of the Src-RhoA-PI3-K signaling pathway by Vav-2 downstream of G(alpha13) in pancreatic acini.", 
    "71": "Statins confer therapeutic benefits in systemic and pulmonary vascular diseases. Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) receptors serve essential signaling functions in cardiovascular development and skeletal morphogenesis. Mutations in BMP receptor type II (BMPR2) are associated with human familial and idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension, and pathologic neointimal proliferation of vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells within small pulmonary arteries. In severe experimental pulmonary hypertension, simvastatin reversed disease and conferred a 100% survival advantage. Here, modulation of BMPR2 gene expression by simvastatin is characterized in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T, pulmonary artery smooth muscle, and lung microvascular endothelial cells (HLMVECs). A 1.4kb BMPR2 promoter containing Egr-1 binding sites confers reporter gene activation in 293T cells which is partially inhibited by simvastatin. Simvastatin enhances steady-state BMPR2 mRNA and protein expression in HLMVEC, through posttranscriptional mRNA stabilization. Simvastatin induction of BMPR2 expression may improve BMP-BMPR2 signaling thereby enhancing endothelial differentiation and function.",

The control group had subsequent low and comparable cholesterol levels in Years 2 to 10 of the study compared with the patients originally randomized to pravastatin. Intent-to-treat analysis demonstrated that the pravastatin group compared with control had increased 10-year survival (68% vs 48%, p = 0.026).

The main side effects of these medications are a variety of skeletal muscle complaints ranging from mild myalgia to frank rhabdomyolysis. To search for physiologic factors possibly influencing statin muscle toxicity, we screened for genetic associations with serum creatine kinase (CK) levels in 102 patients receiving statin therapy for hypercholesteremia. A total of 19 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) were selected from ten candidate genes involved in vascular homeostasis. Multiple linear regression was used to rank the SNPs according to probability of association, and the most significant associations were analyzed in greater detail. SNPs in the angiotensin II Type 1 receptor (AGTR1) and nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3) genes were significantly associated with CK activity. These results demonstrate a strong association between CK activity during statin treatment and variability in genes related to vascular function, and suggest that vascular smooth muscle function may contribute to the muscle side effects of statins.", 
    "77": "Recent studies suggest that the biological effects of saturated fatty acids depend on the length of their chain. We compared the effect of diets containing different fatty acids on plasma lipids and lymphocyte proliferation in the presence of lovastatin and with increasing amounts of LDL. Lymphocytes from rats fed with a diet rich in palmitic acid had a greater lymphocyte proliferation capacity than those from rats fed with diets rich in oleic acid, linoleic acid, or fish oil. This effect was maintained when small amounts of polyunsaturatwed fatty acids (PUFA; sunflower oil) were added to the palmitic acid diet. LDL receptor activity, measured by the capacity of lovastatin to revert the inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation with increasing amounts of LDL in the medium, was greater in the rats fed with palmitic acid, and was similar to the other groups when small amounts of PUFA were added. All the groups had similar levels of plasma cholesterol, but the LDL levels were significantly lower in the group fed with palmitic acid plus PUFA. The highest HDL-cholesterol (HDLc) levels were found in the palmitic acid group and the lowest LDL-cholesterol (LDLc)/HDLc ratio in the palmitic acid plus PUFA group. These results suggest that diets rich in palmitic acid do not raise total cholesterol, but reduce LDLc or keep it normal, and raise HDLc levels. This effect may be partly due to an increase in LDL receptor activity. The inclusion of small amounts of PUFA in the diet rich in palmitic acid substantially modified the LDL receptor response in the lymphocytes, suggesting that the proportion of different families of dietary fatty acids may be more important than the individual amount of each in absolute terms to explain their effects on plasma lipids and lipoproteins.",

    "91": "Oxidative damage by reactive nitrogen species is linked to the pathogenesis of numerous inflammatory disorders, including atherosclerosis. 3-Nitrotyrosine (NO2Tyr), a posttranslational modification of proteins generated by reactive nitrogen species, serves as a \"molecular fingerprint\" for protein modification by nitric oxide (NO)-derived oxidants. Studies demonstrate that systemic levels of protein-bound NO2Tyr serve as an independent predictor of cardiovascular risks and are modulated by statin therapy. Measurement of NO2Tyr in biological matrices may thus serve both as a quantitative index of nitrative stress in vivo and an important new prognostic marker of clinical relevance. Analytical methods for the accurate detection and quantification of trace levels of NO2Tyr in biological tissues and fluids are, thus, of considerable interest. Here, we describe a rapid, sensitive, and specific method for the quantification of NO2Tyr in biological matrices using readily available benchtop ion-trap mass spectrometry instrumentation (e.g., LCQDeca) combined with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) interface. Through judicious use of stable isotopically labeled precursors as synthetic internal standards, the tandem mass spectrometric method described simultaneously adjusts for potential intrapreparative sample losses and monitors potential artifactual generation of NO2Tyr during processing. The described method permits rapid and reproducible quantification of NO2Tyr in biological and clinical specimens at the 100 fmol on column detection limit and should prove useful for studies defining the impact of reactive nitrogen species in cardiovascular disease and other inflammatory disorders.", 
    "92": "Statins are widely prescribed and are established as first-line therapy for the primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease. However, the benefit of treatment varies between patients. Genetic variation can contribute to interindividual variations in clinical efficacy of drug therapy, and significant progress has been made in identifying common genetic polymorphisms that influence responsiveness to statin therapy. To date, >30 candidate genes related to pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of statins have been investigated as potential determinants of drug responsiveness in terms of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering. Genetic variation at gene loci that affect intestinal cholesterol absorption include apolipoprotein (apo) E; adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette transporter G5 and G8; cholesterol production, such as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase; and lipoprotein catabolism, such as apoB and the low-density lipoprotein receptor, all may play a role in modulating responsivesness as well genes involved in metabolism of statins such as cytochrome P450. However, there is considerable variation in results reported, and the data suggest that combined analysis of multiple genetic variants in several genes, all of which have possible functional significance, is more likely to give significant results than single gene studies in small sample populations. In the future, pharmacogenomic studies with a greater number of participants (>2,000 participants) should provide a better picture as to who is most likely and who is least likely to benefit from statin therapy.", 
    "93": "The clinical importance of low serum levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is often under-recognized and underappreciated as a risk factor for premature atherosclerosis as well as for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Low serum levels of HDL are frequently encountered, especially in patients who are obese or have the metabolic syndrome. In prospective epidemiologic studies, every 1-mg/dL increase in HDL is associated with a 2% to 3% decrease in coronary artery disease risk, independent of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglyceride (TG) levels. The primary mechanism for this protective effect is believed to be reverse cholesterol transport, but several other anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, and antiproliferative functions for HDL have also been identified. In recognition of these antiatherogenic effects, recent guidelines have increased the threshold for defining low levels of HDL for both men and women. The first step in achieving these revised targets is therapeutic lifestyle changes. When these measures are inadequate, pharmacotherapy specific to the patient's lipid profile should be instituted. Niacin therapy, currently the most effective means for raising HDL levels, should be initiated in patients with isolated low HDL (HDL <40 mg/dL, LDL and non-HDL at or below National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) targets based on global cardiovascular risk evaluation). Patients who have both low HDL and elevated LDL should receive a statin or statin-niacin combination therapy, and patients with concomitant low HDL and elevated TGs should receive a fibrate initially, with a statin, niacin, or ezetimibe added thereafter as needed to help attain NCEP lipoprotein targets.",

This article reviews the pharmacokinetics between statins and fibrates, addressing risks associated with drug-drug interactions and combination therapy.", 
    "95": "Despite a growing body of research on the benefit of combination drug therapy for dyslipidemia in the metabolic syndrome or diabetes mellitus, there are insufficient outcome data on the use of combination therapy as well as inadequate data to compare certain combination regimens. The focus of the therapeutic approach in treating the metabolic syndrome has been almost exclusively on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol for approximately the past 10 years, and specifically on statin therapy. Although results of epidemiologic studies as well as clinical trials using angiographic and clinical end points confirm the association of LDL cholesterol and risk of coronary artery disease, data are lacking regarding the effects of combination therapy in the management of coronary artery disease. Management of the metabolic syndrome focusing on the modification of plasma LDL as well as high-density lipoprotein cholesterol is reviewed. Future management strategies with the use of novel combination therapy is also discussed.", 
    "96": "Clinical trials of statin therapy have consistently demonstrated significant reductions in coronary artery disease (CAD) events, yet statin-treated patients remain at risk for CAD despite substantial reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Recent evidence from clinical trials supports reduction of LDL cholesterol to lower targets, and the updated treatment guidelines include optional, more aggressive LDL cholesterol goals for patients at very high and moderately high risk. Achievement of these lower goals will require enhanced treatment strategies. Targeting multiple lipid pathways can provide greater reductions in LDL cholesterol as well as improvements in other lipid parameters. Clinical trials are needed to determine which treatment strategies provide optimal cardiovascular risk reduction.",

An important clinical challenge exists in reducing residual CAD risk with optimal therapies without increasing adverse effects. Combination therapy appears most appropriate for patients with a high rate of events of residual risk despite optimal statin therapy. This article discusses the role of combination therapy in managing CAD and in achieving optional targets in high-risk patient populations.",

The treatment group had lower median CRP levels at study end and experienced a significant reduction in the number of episodes of PAF compared with the placebo group. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation was completely resolved in 26 (65%) of 40 patients in the treatment group versus 4 (10%) of 40 in the placebo group.

Stratified analyses were conducted to examine whether these associations differed across sex and statin use. In the overall analysis, CRP was not significantly associated with IMT or presence of CAC but was negatively and significantly associated with quantity of CAC (P = .01).

A significant component of the risk associated with type 2 diabetes is thought to be because of its characteristic lipid \"triad\" profile of raised small dense low-density lipoprotein levels, lowered high-density lipoprotein, and elevated triglycerides (TGs). Trials of statins and fibrates have included substantial numbers of patients with diabetes and indicate that lipid lowering reduces cardiovascular event rates in these patients. However, statins alone do not always address all the lipid abnormalities of diabetes. Fibrates, which have low affinity for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha), improve most aspects of the atherogenic dyslipidemia of diabetes. Chronic elevations of free fatty acids (FFA) induce insulin resistance and contribute to the lipid triad of diabetes. Therefore, reducing their levels is likely to ameliorate insulin resistance and improve the lipid triad of diabetes. PPARs are intimately involved in the regulation of FFA: PPARalpha modulation increases FFA catabolism and PPARgamma agonism (eg, by thiazolidinediones) increases TG lipolysis, FFA transport, conversion of FFA to TGs, and safe storage of FFA. Integrating potent PPARalpha and PPARgamma activity may deliver greater improvement of the diabetic dyslipidemic profile and its attendant risks than selective PPAR activation.",

The aim of this study was to examine whether atorvastatin had any effect on heart rate variability (HRV), an important predictor of sudden cardiac death. Eighty patients previously treated with coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) were studied. The study was designed as a randomized, placebo-controlled, double blinded crossover study. The patients were randomized in two groups, and were treated with 80 mg atorvastatin or placebo for 6 weeks before crossing over to the opposite treatment for another 6 weeks. There was no washout between treatments. Twenty-four-hour Holter recording and plasma lipids and lipoprotein measurements were performed at baseline and after each 6-week period.

A significant reduction in total cholesterol (46%, p</=0.001), LDL cholesterol (61%, p</=0.001) and triglycerides (35%, p</=0.001) were observed during treatment with atorvastatin. Therapy with 80 mg atorvastatin daily for 6 weeks reduced total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides significantly, while there was no effect on 24-h HRV indices.

In most patients with type 2 diabetes, the major features of dyslipidemia are increased triglyceride levels, decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, and changes in the composition and level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Clinical trials evaluating both primary and secondary prevention of CVD demonstrate that lipid-lowering therapy results in a substantial reduction of cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol is the first priority for treatment, with a statin in adequate dosage as the first choice for pharmacological therapy. The first statin trial conducted solely in patients with type 2 diabetes and no prior CVD demonstrated a 37% reduction in cardiovascular events in patients randomized to atorvastatin 10 mg compared with placebo. Additional trials that further address the benefits of lipid-lowering therapy in patients with diabetes are near completion, or are underway, and should provide important information about further attenuating risk in patients with diabetes.",

Therefore, we examined the effect of pitavastatin on cell proliferation and the association between chemokine receptors (CCR2 and CCR5) and their ligands, RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T cell-expressed and secreted) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), in monocytes. Pitavastatin but not pravastatin inhibited cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner and showed S-phase arrest associated with the downregulation of CCR2 and CCR5 expression in human monocytic tumor cells (U937 cells). Although the anti-proliferative effects of pitavastatin were not inhibited by lower concentrations of RANTES and MCP-1, overexpression of CCR2/CCR5 significantly blocked the anti-proliferation with a low concentration of RANTES or MCP-1. Pitavastatin upregulated p21(waf1) but not p27(kip1), and did not change the expression levels of cyclin D1 or cdk4. In addition, RANTES and MCP-1 upregulated cyclin D1 in the presence of pitavastatin. In conclusion, the anti-proliferative effect of pitavastatin, but not pravastatin, through the downregulation of CCR2/CCR5 may be a pleiotropic effect. This effect may be anti-atherogenic in monocytes.",

This study was planned to determine whether LOX-1 genetic variations could affect anti-platelet action of atorvastatin. We studied by platelet P-selectin (P-sel), CD36 and LOX-1 expression (cytofluorimetric detection) whether differences in cellular activation could be suitable in 109 3'UTR/T carriers out of 201 hypercholesterolemic subjects treated with atorvastatin 20mg/day. Hyperactivated platelets (P-sel in resting cells and % variation upon thrombin activation, p<0.001) were detected at baseline in patients without significant differences between T or C carriers. P-sel and platelet-associated ox-LDL, were significantly decreased (all p<0.001) in C carriers after one week of treatment before LDL reduction. In 3'UTR/T carriers P-sel was reduced (p<0.01) after 6 weeks of treatment according to LDL and ox-LDL reduction. In 3'UTR/T carriers atorvastatin reduced platelet activity by LDL and ox-LDL lowering and not by rapid CD36 and LOX-1 downregulation as in C carriers.

LDL-cholesterol (C) level was not successfully controlled despite the administration of a statin, pravastatin, a fibrate, clinofibrate and probucol at maximum doses Concomitantly. Therefore, as combination therapy, LDL-apheresis was introduced in May 1997. However, the patient strongly complained of the economic, physical, and mental burdens of LDL-apheresis and requested discontinuation of apheresis. Therefore, LDL-apheresis was discontinued in July 2000, and oral medication was subsequently changed to a combination of atorvastatin and cholestimide, resulting in successful control of serum LDL-C level by oral medication alone.

Vehicle-treated ZO rats had significantly higher fasting insulin, total cholesterol (TC), and triglyceride (TG) levels compared with ZL rats. In addition, in the ZO rats, dilator responses of the BA to acetylcholine, iloprost, cromakalim, and potassium chloride were significantly reduced when compared with ZL rats. One-day RSV treatment improved dilator responses of the ZO BAs without altering lipid levels. Four-week RSV treatment lowered both TC and TG by 30% and also improved dilator responses of the ZO BAs, although without additional effects compared with the 1-day RSV treatment. NAD(P)H oxidase-dependent superoxide production was significantly higher in the cerebral arteries of vehicle-treated ZO rats compared with ZL rats, but both 1-day and 4-wk RSV treatments normalized elevated superoxide levels in the ZO arteries. These findings demonstrate that RSV improves cerebrovascular function in insulin-resistance independently from its lipid-lowering effect by the inhibition of NAD(P)H oxidase.",

Interestingly, numerous studies have suggested that statins exert potentially important effects independent of lipid lowering (ie, improve endothelial function, reduce oxidant stress), and have direct anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic, and plaque-stabilizing effects. These beneficial effects may contribute to cardiovascular protection by statin therapy beyond low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol lowering. Therefore, it remains unclear at present to what extent the beneficial cardiovascular effects of statin treatment are dependent on LDL cholesterol lowering (ie, whether the same effect would be achieved by other modes of lipid lowering). Consequently, statins should be used as a first-line therapy for lipid lowering. Importantly, the observation of LDL cholesterol-independent effects of statins has stimulated clinical studies testing a wider use of statin treatment for diseases that are not thought to be related to increased LDL cholesterol levels, such as in patients with chronic heart failure (in particular dilated cardiomyopathy) and even in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis.",

Minor effects of statins on brain cholesterol metabolism have been reported in some in vivo animal studies, and it seems that this is due to a local effect of the drug. We treated male mice of the inbred strain C57/BL6 with a high daily dose of lipophilic simvastatin (100 mg/kg b.wt.) or hydrophilic pravastatin (200 mg/kg b.wt.) or vehicle (controls) by oral gavage for 3 days. To compare the impact of both statins on brain cholesterol synthesis and degradation, levels of cholesterol, its precursor lathosterol, and its brain metabolite 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol as well as statin concentrations were determined in whole-brain lipid extracts using mass spectrometry. The expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-coenzyme A (CoA) reductase mRNA and of other target genes were evaluated using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. In addition, analysis of liver and serum samples was performed. Similar levels of simvastatin and pravastatin were detected in whole-brain homogenates. Cholesterol contents in the brain, liver, and serum were not affected by high-dose statin treatment. Whereas brain cholesterol precursor levels were reduced in simvastatin-treated animals only, no effect was observed on the formation of the brain cholesterol metabolite, 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol. Polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that mRNA expression of HMG-CoA reductase and ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 in the brain was significantly up-regulated in simvastatin-treated animals compared with pravastatin-treated or control animals. We conclude that, under the present experimental conditions, brain cholesterol synthesis is significantly affected by short-term treatment with high doses of lipophilic simvastatin, whereas whole-brain cholesterol turnover is not disturbed.", 
    "166": "Myocardial injury during coronary intervention occurs in 10-40% of cases and is often characterized by a slight increase in the markers of myocardial necrosis, without symptoms, electrocardiographic changes or impairment of cardiac function. However, even small increases in creatine kinase (CK)-MB levels are an expression of a true and detectable infarction and may be associated with a higher follow-up mortality. The cause of CK-MB elevation in case of procedural complications is obvious; however, most cases of minor CK-MB elevation occur in patients with uncomplicated procedures with excellent final angiographic results. It has been suggested that the main mechanism explaining the occurrence of myocardial necrosis during otherwise successful coronary intervention may be distal microembolization of plaque components, an enhanced inflammatory state or total plaque burden and/or instability. Different treatments have been proposed to prevent myocardial injury during coronary intervention, including nitrate infusion, intracoronary beta-blockers, adenosine and IIb/IIa inhibitors, but none of these (apart from the use of IIb/IIIa inhibitors) have been routinely introduced into clinical practice. Previous observational studies suggested a beneficial effect of pre-treatment with statins in this setting; the ARMYDA (Atorvastatin for Reduction of Myocardial Damage During Angioplasty) trial is the first prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study, evaluating the effects of 7-day therapy with 40 mg/day of atorvastatin on post-procedural release of markers of myocardial damage in patients with stable angina undergoing percutaneous intervention. In this study therapy with atorvastatin was associated with an 80% risk reduction in the occurrence of periprocedural myocardial infarction, as well as with a significant reduction in post-intervention peak levels of all markers of myocardial damage. The mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of atorvastatin may be an inflammatory action reducing myocardial injury necrosis due to microembolization, an improvement in endothelial function on microcirculation, and direct myocardial protection.", 
    "167": "To examine anti-inflammatory effect of statins on outcomes of acute coronary syndrome (ACS).", 
    "168": "The trial included 211 ACS patients without ST elevation at ECG. The patients were followed up for 180 days. The anti-inflammatory action was studied for 30 days. The patients were divided into two groups by the treatment: simvastatin 10 mg + aspirin 325 mg (104 patients, group 1) and simvastatin 40 mg + aspirin 325 mg (107 patients, group 2) for 30 days.", 
    "169": "Simvastatin in maximal dose lowed LDLP cholesterol from 101 +/- 9.8 to 72 +/- 3.3 mg/dl, in a minimal dose--from 104 +/- 11.3 to 81 +/- 2.1 mg/dl (p < 0.05). Only maximal dose simvastatin produced a significant reduction of C-reactive protein (CRP) to the disease day 14. The integral index including all cases of cardiovascular death +acute myocardial infarction+progressive angina+rehospitalization was 70 scores for group 1 and 137 for group 2 (p = 0.047).", 
    "170": "Use of simvastatin in ACS patients, initially normal level of LDLP cholesterol and elevated level of CRP produced a dose-dependent effect, alleviated inflammation and improved the disease course.", 
    "171": "The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and oxidative stress play a major role in the pathogenesis of hypertension.", 
    "172": "We examined the effects of simvastatin, an HMG-CoA inhibitor, and losartan, an angiotensin type 1 receptor antagonist, in Dahl rats fed a high salt diet (8% NaCl), and treated with either simvastatin (3 mg/kg/d), losartan (10 mg/kg/d), or their combination using the drinking water as vehicle, for 3 weeks. Mean blood pressure (MAP) was measured by tail-cuff plethysmography. Plasma levels of nitric oxide (NO) and prostanoids, as well as plasma and tissue angiotensin II (Ang II) and aldosterone (ALDO) were analyzed by enzyme immunoassay. Renal and aortic superoxide production was determined by fluorescence spectrometry. Vascular reactivity of second-order mesenteric arteries was assessed in vitro.", 
    "173": "Simvastatin, losartan, and the drug combination attenuated the salt-induced increase in MAP. Plasma NO was elevated by simvastatin, losartan, and the combination, whereas plasma thromboxane was reduced by losartan. Simvastatin, losartan, and the combination reduced renal Ang II, but only the combination reduced cardiac Ang II. Heart and renal ALDO were reduced by simvastatin, losartan, and the combination. Aortic and renal NADPH-dependent superoxide production was reduced by simvastatin, losartan, and the combination. The response to acetylcholine, in mesenteric arteries preconstricted with norepinephrine, was greater in the losartan group.", 
    "174": "Thus, treatment with simvastatin and losartan lowered oxidative stress and improved endothelial function. Simvastatin significantly reduced the effect of losartan on vascular reactivity in mesenteric arteries, suggesting that their combination may be contraindicated.", 
    "175": "The effects of statins on intima-media thickness (IMT) are well documented, whereas those of fibrates are unknown. Therefore we compared IMT under treatment with each class of drugs.", 
    "176": "We studied a cohort of consecutive dyslipidemic subjects treated with statin (n = 291) or fibrate (n = 82) drugs. Fibrate-treated subjects were matched with the same number of statin-treated subjects to obtain two subgroups of similar demographic and risk factors including LDL cholesterol. Common carotid far wall IMT and lumen diameter were measured by ultrasonography.", 
    "177": "In the entire study population, IMT was greater in the fibrate group than in the statin group (P < .001), even after adjustment for LDL cholesterol and other covariates (P < .05). In the matched groups, IMT was greater in fibrate group than in the statin group (P < .01), even after adjustment for LDL cholesterol and other covariates including treatment duration (P < .01). The IMT correlated positively with treatment duration in the fibrate group (P < 0.05) but not in the statin group. In addition, IMT correlated positively with carotid lumen diameter in both the fibrate and statin groups (P < .05, P < .01) but with a lower slope in the former (P < .05).", 
    "178": "In this study fibrate treatment was associated with greater IMT, steeper IMT-time relationship, and lower compensatory carotid enlargement than was statin treatment. These differences were not explained by differences in LDL cholesterol.", 
    "179": "Relatively little has been written about the practicalities of the closeout of large, multi-centre clinical trials, but this aspect of trial conduct and design is both important and requires careful planning in order to be accomplished in a timely and orderly fashion. Here, we document our recent experiences of closing down the Prospective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk (PROSPER). This five-year study with over 5800 subjects was closed down and published in 2002. We describe the methods used to ensure the speedy progression from the start of the closeout period through data lock to publication and presentation of the results. We discuss the strategic planning of all aspects of the closeout process, the training of staff for final visits, the methods used to follow-up all study participants including those used in dealing with \"difficult to contact\" and defaulted patients, and the strategies employed to ensure that study participants were left with positive feelings about the study. We also detail the methods employed to expedite the throughput of study paperwork and endpoints and the cleaning of data in preparation for data lock and subsequent publication and presentation of the results. Based on our experiences we summarize the most important aspects of closeout design and make recommendations for future studies, the most important of which is that a well-planned and well-managed closeout is a key feature of any large scale clinical trial and a coherent and practicable closeout strategy should be an integral part of the design.", 
    "180": "The gold standard clinical trial design is the double-blind, randomized, controlled trial. No standard practice exists for the \"unblinding\" of trial participants and no legal obligation is placed on investigators to inform participants of their treatment allocation or study results at the end of a trial. Here we document our experiences of unblinding the 2520 Scottish participants in the Prospective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk (PROSPER).", 
    "181": "The objectives of the PROSPER unblinding process were to provide all study participants with their study medication status and on-trial cholesterol levels and to respect the rights of participants not to be unblinded. It was considered imperative by the study executive that the blind was maintained until the presentation and publication of the results. Staff therefore remained \"blinded\" throughout the unblinding process. Inappropriate contact with the PROSPER participants was avoided by confirming their current vital status and health status.", 
    "182": "To coincide with the presentation of the PROSPER results, all participants, for whom it was deemed appropriate, were sent a summary of the results and were offered the opportunity to be advised of their treatment allocation and on-trial lipid profiles. The majority of participants opted for telephone unblinding. All primary care physicians who had patients randomised to the study were also sent a summary of the study results and sealed documents detailing the treatment allocation and lipid profiles for each patient. Relocated patients were traced and the information forwarded to their new primary care physicians.", 
    "183": "The dissemination of study results and treatment allocation to study participants is an integral part of the research process and should be included in the design of any clinical trial.", 
    "184": "Statins stimulate bone formation partly by inducing osteoblast differentiation, although there is controversy about the effects of statins on bone mineral density and fracture risk. Several studies have revealed that statins suppress bone resorption. However, the mechanism by which statins inhibit bone resorption is still unclear. The present study was performed to clarify the effects of statins on osteoclast formation as well as the levels of osteoprotegerin (OPG) and receptor activator of NFkappaB ligand (RANKL) mRNA in mouse bone-cell cultures by semiquantitative RT-PCR. 10(-8) M 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] significantly stimulated osteoclast formation and 10(-6) M statins (mevastatin and simvastatin) significantly antagonized osteoclast formation stimulated by 1,25(OH)2D3 in mouse bone-cell cultures, including both osteoblasts and osteoclasts. 10(-6) M mevastatin and simvastatin increased the level of OPG mRNA in mouse bone-cell cultures. On the other hand, 10(-6) M mevastatin and simvastatin inhibited the level of RANKL mRNA in these cultures. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that statins inhibit osteoclast formation in mouse bone-cell cultures. Moreover, statins also increased and decreased the levels of OPG and RANKL mRNA expression in these cultures, respectively. The modulation of OPG/RANKL may be involved in the inhibition of osteoclast formation by statins.", 
    "185": "Whether osteoporosis and calcification of atherosclerotic plaque are two independent, age-related processes or linked by similar mechanisms of bone mineralization and plaque calcification is unknown. This study examines the sex-specific association between bone mineral density (BMD) and coronary artery calcification with a particular focus on hormone therapy (HT).", 
    "186": "Participants were 180 men (aged 47-86 years) and 186 women (aged 58-81 years) without a history of heart disease who had hip and spine BMD assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and coronary artery calcium score (CACS) measured by electron-beam computed tomography. Calcium scores were categorized into none/minimal (<or=10), mild (11-100), moderate (101-399), and severe (>or=400). Ordinal and binary logistic regressions examined the associations between site-specific BMD and CACS.", 
    "187": "In men and women not using HT, there was no age-independent association between BMD at any site and CACS. In contrast, among current HT users an inverse association of BMD with coronary artery calcification was observed at the total hip (odds ratio [OR] = 0.56, 95% CI, 0.33-0.95), trochanter (OR = 0.55, 95% CI, 0.32-0.93), and intertrochanter area (OR = 0.60, 95% CI, 0.41-0.86) after adjustment for age and other risk factors. Other skeletal sites showed similar, but not statistically significant, associations (P < 0.1).", 
    "188": "Lack of association between BMD and CACS in men and women not using HT and the inverse association in women on HT suggest that the association between coronary and bone calcium might be mediated by estrogen.", 
    "189": "The purpose of the present study was to comparatively evaluate human HERG currents and QT intervals following challenge with suspected torsadogenic and nontorsadogenic drugs. Various concentrations of 14 different drugs were initially evaluated in terms of their relative potency to block I(HERG) in stably transfected human embryonic kidney cells. Four general categories of drugs were identified: high-potency blockers (IC50 < 0.1 microM) included lidoflazine, terfenadine, and haloperidol; moderate-potency blockers (0.1 microM < IC50 < 1 microM) included sertindole, thioridazine, and prenylamine; low-potency blockers (IC50 > 1 microM) included propafenone, loratadine, pyrilamine, lovastatin, and chlorpheniramine; and ineffective blockers (IC50 > 300 microM) included cimetidine, pentamidine, and arsenic trioxide. All measurements were performed using similar conditions and tested acute drug effects only (<30 min of drug exposure per measurement). Since two of the drugs that were ineffective I(HERG) blockers, arsenic trioxide and pentamidine, have been associated with cardiac repolarization delays (QT interval lengthening) and torsades de pointes ventricular arrhythmias in patients, we chose to evaluate them further using the isolated perfused rabbit heart model. Neither arsenic trioxide nor pentamidine had any significant effect on QT intervals in this model, even at relatively high (micromolar) concentrations. Similar results were obtained for loratadine in this model. When the hearts were challenged with a known torsadogenic drug such as cisapride, significant QT lengthening was rapidly induced. These results demonstrate that arsenic trioxide and pentamidine are essentially devoid of direct acute effects on cardiac repolarization or inhibition of I(HERG).", 
    "190": "There is mounting evidence to support the influence of inflammation in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation (AF). Indeed, AF is associated with increased levels of known inflammatory markers, even after adjustment for confounding factors. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) appears to play a key role in this process. Atrial biopsies from patients with AF have also confirmed the presence of inflammation. Furthermore, there is preliminary evidence to support a number of drug therapies that have the potential to reduce the clinical burden of AF. In this review, we present an overview of the evidence supporting a link between inflammation and AF, and some of the drug therapies, such as the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, steroids, fish oils, and vitamin C, that might be efficacious in the prevention of AF by modulating inflammatory pathways.", 
    "191": "The cellular prion protein PrP(c) is attached to the plasma membrane by a glycosyl-phosphatidyl-inositol (GPI-) anchor and is localized in lipid rafts, membrane microdomains characterized by a high content of sphingolipids and cholesterol. Previous studies revealed that perturbation of cholesterol synthesis prevents prion conversion, explained by redistribution of PrP(c) at the plasma membrane. We investigated the influence of inhibition of cholesterol synthesis by the HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor mevinolin on the trafficking of PrP(c) in neuronal cells. Treatment with mevinolin significantly reduces the amount of surface PrP(c) and leads to its accumulation in the Golgi compartment. Analysis of mutant PrPs highlights the importance of the GPI-anchor for raft localization and provides information about domains implicated in lipid raft association of PrP in the secretory pathway. Our data show that cholesterol is essential for the cell surface localization of PrP(c), known to be necessary for prion conversion."
