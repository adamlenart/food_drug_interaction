    "0": "Despite the importance of reducing cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, detailed in guidelines in many countries, repeated surveys show poor physician performance in attaining guideline lipid targets, which is associated with reluctance by physicians to up-titrate statins from starting doses. Data from randomised, double-blind trials comparing common starting doses of atorvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin and simvastatin for 12 weeks in hypercholesterolaemic patients were therefore analysed for achievement of lipid-lowering goals recommended by the England National Service Framework (NSF) for coronary heart disease (CHD). In three pooled trials, rosuvastatin 10 mg (n = 389) reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and total cholesterol more significantly than atorvastatin 10 mg (n = 393) (p < 0.001). NSF goals were achieved by 83% of rosuvastatin patients vs. 55% of atorvastatin patients (p < 0.001) at relevant starting doses. In two pooled trials, rosuvastatin 10 mg (n = 226) reduced LDL-C and total cholesterol more significantly than simvastatin 20 mg (n = 249) and pravastatin 20 mg (n = 252) (p < 0.001). NSF goals were achieved at starting doses by 83% of rosuvastatin patients vs. 51% of simvastatin patients and 19% of pravastatin patients (p < 0.001 vs. each comparator). This improved achievement of NSF lipid target, at starting doses, was also seen in high-risk patients (those eligible for secondary prevention or primary prevention because of a 10-year CVD risk of >30%) with 84% patients on rosuvastatin vs. 58% on atorvastatin and 75% of patients on rosuvastatin vs. 49% on simvaststin and 24% on pravastatin. In summary, there are considerable and clinically significant variations in the achievement of lipid goals between common starting doses of statins in hypercholesterolaemic patients.",

    "2": "The Conversion to Atorvastatin in Patients Intolerant or Refractory to Simvastatin Therapy (CAPISH) study was designed in 2 parts: a retrospective cohort study of patients (group A), identified from a large pharmacy database, who converted from simvastatin to atorvastatin at a single academic military medical center (between April 1998 and March 2002) and a prospective cohort study of patients (group B) monitored in a lipid clinic at the same institution (between April 2002 and March 2003). Group A was identified by 2 or more simvastatin prescription fills and at least 1 atorvastatin prescription fill. Group B was identified by a physician-perceived need to switch from simvastatin to atorvastatin. Clinical, pharmaceutical, and laboratory records of both cohorts were reviewed.", 
    "3": "Approximately 1 in 4 simvastatin-treated patients discontinued therapy during a 4-year period. The most common reason for switching to atorvastatin was inadequate low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol control, although asymptomatic creatine kinase (CK) elevation and myalgias were also common. In most cases of myositis and in nearly all cases of rhabdomyolysis, patients were taking 80 mg of simvastatin. Achievement of National Cholesterol Education Program LDL cholesterol goals increased from 25% to 63% in group A and from 13% to 78% in group B, both P<.001. Significant reductions in CK also were seen in both groups. Adherence to atorvastatin was greater than 80% in both groups after 28.1+/-13.2 months (group A, 841 patients) and 8.1+/-3.8 months (group B, 104 patients). Among patients not taking atorvastatin at follow-up, 58% were no longer taking statins.",

    "5": "The effects of statins on gene expression of cerebral endothelial cells (ECs) in vivo have not been investigated after stroke. We developed a rapid double immunofluorescent staining protocol with antibodies against von Willebrand factor (a marker for endothelium) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (a marker for astrocytes) for laser capture microdissection to isolate single ECs in brain tissue of the rat. Using this protocol in combination with real-time PCR, we found that stroke significantly increased mRNA levels of protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR-1) and tissue factor (TF) in ECs isolated from ischemic cerebral microvessels compared with nonischemic vessels. Treatment of embolic stroke with recombinant human tissue plasminogen activator (rht-PA) 4 h after stroke further elevated PAR-1 mRNA levels nearly 1000-fold in the core and 500-fold in the boundary above the nonstroke group 30 h after stroke, while TF mRNA levels were elevated approximately 10 fold above the nonstroke group. Furthermore, stroke significantly increased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 2 and 9 mRNA levels in the ischemic core and boundary regions 6 and 30 h after stroke. Treatment with rht-PA-upregulated MMP2 expression in the ischemic boundary and core. Atorvastatin completely blocked rht-PA upregulation of the above genes, when atorvastatin in combination with rht-PA was administered 4 h after stroke. Monotherapy of atorvastatin 4 h after stroke did not significantly reduce expression of genes examined in the present study. These data provide evidence that atorvastatin reduces exogenous tPA-aggravated cerebral endothelial genes that mediate thrombosis and blood-brain barrier permeability, which could contribute to the beneficial effects of statins on thrombolytic treatment of acute stroke.",

Subjects were classified into six medication categories of LLM use based partly on efficacy levels on package inserts.

The NNT is a simple way to express the absolute therapeutic yield of an intervention. It is essential to take baseline risk and length of follow-up into account when calculating and interpreting absolute or relative measures of therapeutic yield. Patients may have difficulty understanding what the NNT tells them about the benefits and harms associated with an intervention, and confidence intervals for the NNT can be difficult to interpret. Relative measures of benefits are advantageous for comparing benefits across populations with different risks. The use of absolute measures to describe therapeutic options leads to more conservative decision-making and is potentially more useful. Among the absolute measures, the absolute risk reduction may be easier to understand than the NNT. These measures are most helpful when the best options are not clear or when patient input is needed. Personal digital assistants and Web-based tools can assist with calculations.",

Although this may be predominantly due to their known anti-ischaemic actions, these drugs are known to have other beneficial effects. 2. Because pathological deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) material is a key component of remodelling after MI, we sought to determine whether atorvastatin could inhibit ECM production in vitro. 3. The addition of atorvastatin to rat cardiac fibroblasts stimulated with either transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 (TGF-beta1) or angiotensin (Ang) II reduced collagen synthesis in a dose-dependent manner (3.7-fold reduction (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.8-15; P < 0.01) and 5.3-fold reduction (95% CI 1.8-7.7; P < 0.01), respectively, compared with stimulant alone). Similar observations were made in human cardiac fibroblast cell culture. Atorvastatin also dose-dependently reduced TGF-beta1 and AngII-induced increases in alpha(I)-procollagen mRNA (P < 0.01 for both), as well as gene expression of the profibrotic peptide connective tissue growth factor. 4. Atorvastatin appears to directly inhibit collagen production by cardiac fibroblasts. This antifibrotic action may contribute to the antiremodelling effect of statins.",

Raising HDL-C reduces this risk significantly, making HDL-C levels an important target of treatment for dyslipidaemia, especially in pre-existent atherosclerosis. HDL-C is protective against atherosclerosis, largely due to its function of reverse cholesterol transport. Additionally, some important roles include fibrinolysis, antioxidant functions, and reduction of platelet aggregability. A number of agents potentially modify HDL favourably. Niacin is the most potent HDL-C raising agent currently available in clinical practice, followed by fibrates. CETP inhibitors show greater HDL-C rising, but are still used in trial settings only. HDL mimetic agents are another group of agents that offer much promise. Clinical outcome data are awaited for these newer therapeutic agents.", 
    "19": "Lovastatin, a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase, inhibits the conversion of mevalonate from HMG-CoA. Previously, we have reported that lovastatin treatment induced the occurrence of apoptosis and differentiation in ARO anaplastic thyroid cancer cells. Here, we demonstrated that lovastatin inhibited the ARO cell invasiveness and delineated the underlying molecular mechanism. Lovastatin significantly suppressed the EGF-induced cell adhesion, actin filament reorganization and transmigration. Lovastatin also reduced EGF-induced increases in the levels of phosphorylated p125(FAK) and paxillin. These inhibitory effects mediated by lovastatin can be prevented by pretreatment of the cells with mevalonate or geranylgeraniol (GGOH), but not farnesol (FOH). Accordingly, the consuming and depletion of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate and consequent suppression of the protein geranylgeranylation, which is essential for activation of Rho GTPases, might account for the lovastatin-induced inhibition of cell motility and invasion. Western blot analysis showed that lovastatin inhibited membrane translocation of Rho (e.g. RhoA and Rac1) through decreasing post-translational geranylgeranyl modification of Rho. In addition, treatment of the cells with specific inhibitors against Rho (Clostridium botulinum C3 transferase) or ROCK (Y-27632) abolished the GGOH-mediated prevention of, and restored the lovastatin-induced decrease of cell invasion. Taken together, our results suggested that lovastatin suppressed EGF-induced ARO cell invasiveness through the reduction of Rho geranylgeranylation, which in turn suppressed the membrane translocation, and subsequent suppression of Rho/ROCK and FAK/paxillin signaling.", 
    "20": "The metabolic syndrome is strongly associated with insulin resistance and consists of a constellation of factors such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia that raise the risk for cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus. There is a growing body of evidence to show that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, statins, reduce cardiovascular-related morbidity and mortality in patients with or without coronary artery disease. Recent clinical observations argue for a simple strategy of considering routine statin therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, statin therapy is also found to be effective in allowing LDL-cholesterol goal achievement in hypercholesterolemic high-risk patients with the metabolic syndrome. However, the effects of statins on the pathogenesis of the metabolic syndrome remain to be elucidated. Several types of statins are commercially available now. Among them, pravastatin is unique because it is the only statin that has been shown to have protective role against the development of diabetes in a large clinical trial. Moreover, a recent clinical study revealed that pravastatin treatment improved insulin sensitivity in 25 women with the metabolic syndrome with impaired glucose intolerance. These observations let us to speculate that pravastatin is a promising strategy for the treatment of hypercholesterolemic patients with the metabolic syndrome. It may improve the insulin sensitivity in these patients and subsequently prevent the development of type 2 diabetes. In this paper, we would like to propose the possible ways of testing our hypothesis as follows. (1) Does pravastatin treatment improve insulin resistance in patients of the metabolic syndrome or in insulin resistant hypertensive or obese patients? If the answers are yes, are these beneficial effects of pravastatin superior to those of other anti-hyperlipidemic statins with equihypolipidemic properties? (2) Does pravastatin treatment actually reduce the development of diabetes in these insulin resistant patients? At that time, does pravastatin treatment increase serum levels of adiponectin, a key adipokine with insulin-sensitizing property? How about the effects of pravastatin treatment on adipokines that could elicit insulin resistance such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha? These clinical studies will provide further information whether pravastatin treatment can improve insulin resistance and subsequently reduce the development of diabetes in insulin resistant patients with the metabolic syndrome.", 
    "21": "Atrial fibrillation is one of the most frequent heart rhythm disturbances found in clinical practice. Anticoagulation, rate control, cardioversion, and ablative procedures have been the mainstay of treatment. The frequent recurrence of atrial fibrillation and the side effects when antiarrhythmic drugs are used have led to dissatisfaction with available treatment of this arrhythmia. Pharmacologic therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, statins, and perhaps aldosterone and calcium channel blockers may have a role in the prevention of atrial fibrillation onset and recurrence. We summarize the possible biologic mechanisms and the clinical observations supporting the use of non-antiarrhythmic medications in the prevention of atrial fibrillation.",

Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to discern factors that were associated with the utilization of medical therapies and with perioperative events.", 
    "24": "Demographics and comorbidities reflected a population with diffuse, advanced atherosclerosis. Perioperative mortality was 2.7%, and major morbidity included myocardial infarction in 4.7% and stroke/transient ischemic attack in 1.4%. Among this population of CLI patients, 33% were not on antiplatelet therapy at study entry, and 24% were not receiving antithrombotics of any type. In addition, 54% of patients were not receiving lipid-lowering therapy, and 52% were not prescribed beta-blocker medications at study entry. On multivariate analysis, race was a significant determinant of antithrombotic utilization, with African-American patients less frequently treated both at baseline and discharge (adjusted odd ratios, 0.5 and 0.6, P < .0001). Antithrombotic and beta-blocker drug usage increased in the overall cohort from baseline (76% and 48%) to discharge (88% and 60%; P < .0001). Patients treated in a university hospital setting were more likely to be prescribed antiplatelet, lipid-lowering, and beta-blocker medications. Advanced age (>75 years), coronary artery disease (prior myocardial infarction or revascularization), and dialysis-dependent renal failure were associated with an increased 30-day risk of death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Protective effects of beta-blocker and lipid-lowering medications were noted in these defined subgroups.", 
    "25": "A significant percentage of the population that undergoes surgical revascularization for CLI is not prescribed therapies of proven benefit in reducing cardiovascular events. Utilization of antithrombotics and beta-blockers increases during hospitalization for limb salvage surgery but that of lipid-lowering therapy does not. African-American patients appear to be at greater risk for undertreatment with antithrombotics, and the data suggest that patients undergoing leg bypass surgery in a university hospital setting receive more comprehensive medical treatment of atherosclerosis. Treatment guidelines for medical therapy are needed to standardize care and improve outcomes for patients with CLI.", 
    "26": "The impact of the 3-hydroxy-3methylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin on human small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell growth and survival was investigated. Simvastatin profoundly impaired basal and growth factor-stimulated SCLC cell growth in vitro and induced apoptosis. SCLC cells treated with simvastatin were sensitized to the effects of the chemotherapeutic agent etoposide. Moreover, SCLC tumour growth in vivo was inhibited by simvastatin. These responses correlated with the inhibition of stem cell factor (SCF)-stimulated activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk), protein kinase B (PKB) and ribosomal S6 kinase by simvastatin. Constitutive activation of the Erk pathway was sufficient to rescue SCLC cell from the effects of simvastatin. The drug did not directly affect activation of c-Kit or its localization to lipid rafts, but in addition to its ability to block Ras membrane localization, it selectively downregulated H-Ras protein levels at the post-translational level. Downregulation of either H- or K-Ras by RNA interference (RNAi) did not impair Erk activation by growth factors, whereas an RNAi specific for N-Ras inhibited activation of Erk, PKB and SCLC cell growth. Together our data demonstrate that inhibiting Ras signalling with simvastatin potently disrupts growth and survival in human SCLC cells.",

We examined the effect of simvastatin on heart rate variability (HRV) in patients with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy to evaluate for an antisympathetic effect of statins independent of anti-ischemic properties.", 
    "28": "The study was a prospective, open-label, self-controlled trial. Frequency domain analysis of HRV was assessed in 25 patients with non-ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy at baseline and after a 6-week course of simvastatin. The primary end point was the change in 5-minute sitting total spectral power (TSP) as a composite measurement of autonomic nervous system modulation. Secondary end points included the change in respiratory frequency area (RFa) with deep breathing (parasympathetic stress) and in low-frequency area (LFa) with Valsalva (sympathetic stress).", 
    "29": "Simvastatin had no effect on 5-minute sitting TSP (baseline 1932 +/- 1165 vs posttreatment 2570 +/- 1877 square milliseconds, P = .770), RFa with deep breathing (baseline 19 +/- 7 vs posttreatment 14 +/- 4 [beat/min]2, P = .31), or LFa with Valsalva (baseline 26 +/- 6 vs posttreatment 32 +/- 8 [beat/min]2, P = .342). Bivariate analysis demonstrated no correlation between low-density lipoprotein (LDL) change and change in TSP or RFa, but did demonstrate an inverse relationship between change in LDL and change in LFa with Valsalva stress (r = -0.45 and P = .041).",

    "34": "Despite endorsements from practice guidelines, less than half of all admitted AMI patients received lipid testing within 24 hours of hospital admission. Because inhospital lipid testing was strongly associated with the initiation of statin therapy at discharge, many opportunities to initiate statin therapy were lost.

The protocol is based on an affinity purification step followed by a strong cation-exchange chromatography and a refolding procedure adapted to epidermal growth factor domains and also to the high tendency of the protein to precipitate in concentrated solutions. The purified protein is pure as assessed by SDS-PAGE, immunoblot and mass spectrometry, and is biologically active as a repressor of human aortic smooth muscle cell migration induced by platelet-derived growth factor-BB.", 
    "36": "We have demonstrated that SC-435, an apical sodium codependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) inhibitor, lowers plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations in guinea pigs. The purpose of this study was to further examine the hypocholesterolemic effects of SC-435, by measuring the activity and RNA expression of regulatory enzymes of hepatic cholesterol and lipoprotein metabolism. In addition, the use of a combination (COMBO) therapy with simvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, was also tested. Male Hartley guinea pigs were randomly allocated to one of three diets (n=10 per group), for 12 weeks. The control diet contained no ASBT inhibitor or simvastatin. The monotherapy diet (ASBTi) contained 0.1% of SC-435. The COMBO therapy consisted of a lower dose of SC-435 (0.03%) and 0.05% simvastatin. Cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) and HMG-CoA reductase mRNA abundance were determined using RT-PCR techniques. Hepatic HMG-CoA reductase and cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7) activities were measured by radioisotopic methods. Compared to the control group, CETP activity was 34% and 56% lower with ASBTi and COMBO, respectively. Similarly, CETP mRNA expression was reduced by 36% and 73% in ASBTi and COMBO groups, respectively. Cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase and HMG-CoA reductase activities were increased approximately 2-fold with ASBTi and COMBO treatments, respectively. Likewise, HMG-CoA reductase mRNA expression was increased 33% with ASBTi treatment. These results suggest that both SC-435 monotherapy and combination therapy lower LDL cholesterol concentrations by altering both hepatic cholesterol homeostasis and the intravascular processing of lipoproteins in guinea pigs.",

Epidemiological, clinical, and economic data were collected from published articles. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) in yen per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) were calculated. To confirm the effects of different variables, a sensitivity analysis was performed. The assumptions of our model were in accordance with the Japan Atherosclerosis Society Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular disease.",

Novel evidence suggests that overexpression of the small heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27) in neurons protects against neurotoxic stimuli and may act as an inhibitor of neurodegeneration. Overexpression of Hsps has been achieved by different means including pharmacological induction. Here, we show that intravitreal injection of the 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor simvastatin induces Hsp27 expression in axotomized retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and enhances RGC survival 7 and 14 days after optic nerve (ON) axotomy by 90% and 19%, respectively. The flavonoid quercetin inhibited Hsp27 induction and abrogated simvastatin-mediated neuroprotection. Simvastatin increased Akt phosphorylation in vivo, indicating that the PI3K/Akt pathway contributes to central nervous system (CNS) protective effects achieved. We propose the use of statins as a feasible approach to reduce lesion-induced CNS neuronal degeneration in vivo.",

We also revealed that fluvastatin treatments prevented the hypoxia-induced decrease in cGMP production in the rat lung and restored the endothelium-dependent relaxation in the pulmonary artery. We revealed that this beneficial effect was not dependent on the increase in eNOS mRNA or protein expression, but was dependent on the inhibition of the eNOS-tight coupling with caveolin-1, the eNOS dissociation from heat shock protein 90, and the decrease in eNOS Ser1177-phosphorylation induced by hypoxia. Furthermore, in a whole-mount immunostaining the hypoxia-induced eNOS protein condensation with caveolin-1 of pulmonary endothelial cells was restored by the fluvastatin-treatment.",

T. cruzi contains sterol biosynthesis enzymes, and produces sterol products similar to those found in fungi. Antifungal drugs that inhibit ergosterol biosynthesis have potent anti-T. cruzi activity in vitro and in animal models. In this report, we describe the effects of sterol biosynthesis inhibitors (simvistatin, zaragosic acid, terbinafine, a lanosterol synthase inhibitor, ketoconazole, and tridemorph) on the regulation of two sterol biosynthesis genes and their protein products. Culturing T. cruzi in the presence of the lanosterol synthase inhibitor, terbinafine, or ketoconazole increased mRNA levels of the sterol C14-demethylase gene approximately 7-12-fold. The sterol C14-demethylase protein levels were also elevated. The effects of the sterol biosynthesis inhibitors on hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase expression were minimal. Control of the upregulation of sterol C14-demethylase appears to be mediated through the 3'-untranslated region of the gene. The findings demonstrate that T. cruzi can specifically regulate gene expression in response to derangements in its cellular functions.",

However, the high dose of this drug markedly improved indices of diastolic function (early diastolic myocardial velocity) and systolic function (LV fractional shortening) at 18 weeks of age and increased the survival rate. It also prevented a decrease in the ratio of reduced to oxidized glutathione and an increase in NADPH oxidase activity in the left ventricle induced by the high-salt diet. The activities of MMP2 and MMP9 and the abundance of TIMP1 and TIMP2 in LV tissue were increased at 18 weeks of age, and pravastatin also prevented these changes.", 
    "50": "Although pravastatin did not attenuate LV hypertrophy, it prevented the transition from compensated hypertrophy to heart failure in this rat model. This effect of pravastatin may result from a reduction both in the level of oxidative stress and in MMP activity in the heart.", 
    "51": "Endothelial dysfunction is associated with a reduction in nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. Positive effects of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) on the improvement of endothelial dysfunction have been shown. We investigated the effects of rosuvastatin and isoprenoid metabolites on endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) mRNA and protein expression in human umbilical venous endothelial cells after exposure to 10(-8)-10(-5) mol/l rosuvastatin for 8 and 12 h. Cell viability was not significantly altered after exposure to the statin for 12h. In a concentration-dependent manner, rosuvastatin upregulated eNOS mRNA and protein expression. The effects on eNOS expression mediated through rosuvastatin could be reversed by treatment with mevalonate indicating inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase as the underlying mechanism. Treatment with geranylgeranylpyrophosphate, but not farnesylpyrophosphate, reversed the increase of eNOS expression induced by rosuvastatin. Rosuvastatin may have beneficial effects on endothelial dysfunction associated with cardiovascular diseases beyond its effects on lowering cholesterol.",

Group I patients was given tablets Simvastatin 20 mg once daily and group II patients received tablet Gemfibrozil 600 mg twice daily. The study period comprised of 12 weeks. Fasting lipid profile and fasting blood sugar was analyzed on week 0 (day of inclusion), week 6 and week 12.", 
    "54": "At week 12 simvastatin decreased serum LDL cholesterol by 36.97 percent (P < 0.001). In contrast gemfibrozil did not reduce it significantly with a reduction of only 1.33 percent (P = N.S). Simvastatin reduced serum total cholesterol and serum triglyceride by 29.88 percent (P < 0.001) and 21.78 percent (P < 0.001) respectively and increased serum HDL cholesterol by 16.67 percent (P < 0.001). While gemfibrozil decreased serum total cholesterol by 9.14 percent (P < 0.001) and serum triglyceride by 30.84 percent (P < 0.001). Gemfibrozil raised serum HDL cholesterol levels by 18.08 percent (P < 0.001).",

Simvastatin was found to be more effective in lowering serum total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels in comparison to gemfibrozil, which was found to be more effective in lowering serum triglyceride and elevating serum HDL cholesterol levels. Both of these drugs were well tolerated and none of the patients exhibited any significant adverse effects. Both can be given as monotherapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and abnormal lipid profile.",

The reports were classified as prospective (reported prior to pregnancy outcome) or retrospective (reported after pregnancy outcome) and were evaluated for timing of exposure, outcome, congenital anomalies, and other events. Outcome rates were calculated for prospective pregnancies.", 
    "58": "We identified 477 reports (386 prospective and 91 retrospective) with 225 prospective outcomes reported: 154 live born infants, 49 elective abortions, 18 spontaneous abortions, and 4 fetal deaths. Six congenital anomalies were reported: chromosomal translocation, trisomy 18, hypospadias, duodenal atresia, cleft lip, and skin tag. The rate of congenital anomalies (congenital anomalies/live births plus fetal deaths) was 3.8%, which is similar to the background population rate (3.2%; relative ratio, 1.21; 95% 1-sided upper confidence interval [CI], 2.02). There were 13 retrospective reports describing a range of congenital anomalies. No specific pattern of anomalies was identified in either the prospective or retrospective reports. Rates for other outcomes were similar to background rates.", 
    "59": "Although the number of reports was relatively small, there was no evidence of a notable increase in congenital anomalies in women exposed to simvastatin or lovastatin versus the general population. Greater reporting of congenital abnormalities in the retrospective cohort is not unexpected and may reflect a reporting bias. Drugs should be used during pregnancy only if the benefits outweigh the risks. Simvastatin and lovastatin remain contraindicated during pregnancy.", 
    "60": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are effective lipid-altering drugs for the treatment of dyslipidemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design trial to determine the effects of simvastatin, 80 mg/day, on plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels and on the metabolism of apolipoprotein B (apoB) in VLDL, intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), and LDL and of triglycerides (TGs) in VLDL. Simvastatin therapy decreased TG, cholesterol, and apoB significantly in VLDL, IDL, and LDL. These effects were associated with reduced production of LDL-apoB, mainly as a result of reduced secretion of apoB-lipoproteins directly into the LDL density range. Statin therapy also reduced hepatic production of VLDL-TG. There were no effects of simvastatin on the fractional catabolic rates of VLDL-apoB or -TG or LDL-apoB. The basis for decreased VLDL-TG secretion during simvastatin treatment is not clear, but recent studies suggest that statins may activate peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha). Activation of PPARalpha could lead to increased hepatic oxidation of fatty acids and less synthesis of TG for VLDL assembly.",

    "63": "Prevalence of use of all drugs increased in 2003 and was markedly higher in patients with a history of myocardial infarction than angina. Older age was related to lower prevalence of drug use, particularly statins. In 2000, older subjects (74-85 years) were 60% [95% confidence interval (CI) = 41-72 per cent] less likely to receive statins compared with younger subjects (62-73 years); this pattern changed very little between 2000 and 2003. Although social class appeared to have little relation to drug use, the prevalence of use of all medications decreased with increasing time since diagnosis.",

It was revealed that both simvastatin and metoprolol diminish significantly plasma nitric oxide concentration by 24.6% and 23.7% respectively. It was also compared nitric oxide concentrations in plasma of rabbits, after 3 week of mononitrate isosorbitol and molsidomine administration--assuming that applied doses are relevant to maximal doses applied to the human. It was found that molsidomine releases more nitric oxide than mononitrate isosorbitol.",

To-date studies have demonstrated that C-reactive protein is the best marker of this type of inflammation because its concentrations not only reflect the intensity of the process but they also carry prognostic information in apparently healthy general population as well as in patients with symptomatic atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the correlation between high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) and the extent of coronary atherosclerosis in men undergoing coronary angiography. The secondary aim was to assess the influence of statin treatment on hsCRP levels by comparing these levels in statin-treated and statin-naive patients.", 
    "67": "112 men with symptoms of ischemic heart disease were included in the study. In 98 cases coronary angiography was performed 52 patients were treated with statins. The extent of atherosclerosis in the coronary bed was evaluated according to four indexes: Gensini score (G), Friesinger score (F), Number of Vessels Diseased (NVD) and Arterial Segment Score (ASS). Concentrations of hsCRP concentrations were obtained with NB100 Dade-Behring kit. Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated for CRP concentrations following their logarithmic transformation. Correlation evaluation was confined to statin-naive patients due to convincing data about the influence of statins on CRP levels.",

The mean concentration of hsCRP was 27.7% lower in the patients on statins than in statin-naive patients within the low and moderate range of concentrations (up to 70th percentile, 2.4 mg/l) (p<0.02). In 25% of study subjects hsCRP exceeded the level of 3.0 mg/l which is the cut-off value for increased risk of atherothrombotic complications.", 
    "69": "The study showed a significant correlation between hsCRP and the extent of coronary atherosclerosis in men with symptoms of ischemic heart disease. A significantly lower concentration of hsCRP was observed in the group of patients treated with statins compared to statin-naive patients, which may result from the proposed CRP reducing influence of these drugs. A quarter of study subjects had hsCRP levels exceeding the cut-off value for increased cardiovascular risk.", 
    "70": "The studies results of statin influence on hemostasis are various. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effects of simvastatin and atorvastatin on hemostatic parameters, such as activity of factor X, antithrombin III, fibrinogen concentration and Lp(a). 72 patients (pts) aged 40-65 were involved in the study; 49 of them suffered from hyperlipidemia II (hlp II) with the initial concentration of total cholesterol (TC) >200 mg/dL, cholesterol LDL (LDL-C) >145 mg/dL, triglycerides (TG) <400 mg/dL. The control group consisted of 20 healthy persons. The pts with hlp II who underwent 4 weeks long lipid lowering diet were randomized into two groups: I--27 pts treated with simvastatin (20 mg/d), II--22 pts treated with atorvastatin (10 mg/d). The active statin therapy lasted 8 weeks. The activity of factor X and antithrombin III (AT III) was estimated by amidolytic methods, fibrinogen concentration (Fb) by the Clauss method, Lp(a)-immunoenzymatic method. The mean values of factor X activity and Fb serum concentration were higher in pts with hip II than in the control group, the AT III activity was lower. The Lp(a) concentration didn't differ between groups. Statin treatment was associated with significant reduction of factor X activity. Both simvastatin and atorvastatin markedly increased AT III (87%, 98%) in comparison to the initial values. No changes of Lp(a) concentration were observed during statin therapy. Atorvastatin therapy significantly increased the Fb concentration (12.3%). Simvastatin treatment didn't influence Fb concentration.", 
    "71": "Cardiovascular disease is the first cause of morbidity and mortality for both men and women in developed countries. Tracking the progression of the atherosclerotic plaque appears to be an effective way to predict modification of risk in individual patients. Quantitative coronary angiography was initially proposed as a method of choice to assess coronary disease progression. With this methodology it was possible to demonstrate a strong association of plaque regression with reduction in adverse cardiovascular outcomes. More recently, the focus of research has turned to the development of noninvasive modalities to image the atherosclerotic plaque in its preclinical stages and to evaluate the effectiveness of preventive therapies with sequential imaging. The ease of performance of these tests enabled their use as intermediate endpoints in clinical trials to test new strategies to treat atherosclerosis. If proven successful, these imaging tools may allow a reduction in size and duration of clinical trials with a substantial cost benefit for society.", 
    "72": "Several potent drugs are currently available for the treatment of hyperlipidemia. These pharmacotherapies include bile acid sequestrants, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (commonly referred to as 'statins'), fibrates and nicotinic acid. Combination therapy to reduce plasma cholesterol levels in hyperlipidemic patients is becoming more popular, as concerns about toxicity resulting from the long-term used of systemically acting drugs are raised. One of the more widespread combinations used to reduce plasma cholesterol levels is that of a bile acid sequestrant and a statin. Combinations of bile acid sequestrants with either niacin or fibrates have been found to be very effective in patients with mixed hyperlipidemia, since the triglyceride-lowering effect of niacin or a fibrate complements the cholesterol-lowering effect of the sequestrant. One major advantage of combination therapy is the ability to reduce the dose of each component to more tolerable levels for the patient. An additional advantage is the reduced cost to achieve the cholesterol reduction goal, as the dose response is relatively good at greatly reduced doses for each component.", 
    "73": "Information of the effect of statin on lipoproteins such as apolipoprotein (apo) A-I, lipoprotein (a) [Lp (a)], or apolipoprotein B levels is limited. This investigation was a crossover study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of atorvastatin and simvastatin in patients with hyperlipidemia. Sixty-six patients were involved in the study. Group I consisted of 32 patients, who were first treated with atorvastatin (10 mg) then switched to simvastatin (10 mg). Group II consisted of 34 patients, who were first treated with simvastatin then switched to atorvastatin. Each regimen was used for 3 months (phase I), stopped for 2 months, and then restarted for another 3 months (phase II). Both statins effectively reduced total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), apo B, and Lp (a) (P < 0.001 in all comparisons). A significant increase in the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) was noted after both statin treatments (P < 0.05 in all comparisons). Both statins caused an increase in the apo A-I levels, and the extent of changes in apo A-I revealed no difference between the two drugs. Compared to the simvastatin group, there were more patients in the atorvastatin group achieving the National Cholesterol Education Program ATP-III LDL-C goal (P < 0.05) and European LDL-C goal (P < 0.001). Both treatments were well tolerated; no patient was withdrawn from the study. This study demonstrates that both statins can effectively improve lipid profiles in patients with hyperlipidemia. Atorvastatin is more effective in helping patients reach the ATP-III and European LDL-C goals than simvastatin at the same dosage.", 
    "74": "The purpose of this study was to examine whether coadministration of olmesartan medoxomil (OLM), an AT1 subtype specific angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), and pravastatin (PRV), a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, could enhance the antiatherogenic effect compared with monotherapy. Vehicle, PRV (25 mg/kg), OLM (0.5 mg/kg), and PRV (25 mg/kg) and OLM (0.5 mg/kg) in combination were administered to Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits for 8 months. OLM alone and in combination lowered blood pressure to a similar degree, whereas PRV alone had no effect. PRV alone and in combination lowered blood cholesterol to a similar degree, whereas OLM alone had no effect. The combination of PRV and OLM decreased effectively both surface lesion area and lesional thickness in aortic tissue, producing a greater reduction in aortic cholesterol content than either drug alone. Immunohistological examination of the aorta revealed that PRV reduced macrophage infiltration and lipid deposition and that OLM reduced macrophage infiltration accompanied by reduction in monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 expression and N-(carboxymethyl)lysine protein adduct, an oxidative stress marker. It is concluded that OLM, an ARB, and PRV, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, in combination produce a greater antiatherogenic effect than monotherapy via the combination of the different antiatherosclerotic mechanisms of each drug.", 
    "75": "Increased cardiovascular mortality is an unresolved problem of chronic renal failure. Cardiac hypertrophy, observed in many patients with chronic renal failure, is a major risk factor for cardiovascular death. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of pitavastatin on cardiac hypertrophy in a progressive renal injury rat model by subtotal nephrectomy (SNx). Because we previously reported that angiotensin II played a pivotal role in cardiac hypertrophy of SNx rats, we first investigated the effects of pitavastatin on angiotensin II-induced activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and serum response element (SRE) DNA-binding activity using neonatal rat cardiomyocytes. Angiotensin II-induced ERK activation was attenuated by pretreatment with pitavastatin. Luciferase assay revealed that angiotensin II-induced increase in SRE DNA-binding activity was inhibited by pitavastatin. We next examined the effect of pitavastatin on cardiac hypertrophy of SNx rats in vivo. Treatment with pitavastatin prevented ERK activation and cardiac hypertrophy in SNx rats without changes in blood pressure. The increased expression of atrial natriuretic factor mRNA in SNx rat hearts was significantly attenuated by the treatment with pitavastatin. These results suggest that pitavastatin has a beneficial effect on cardiac hypertrophy in renal failure through preventing the activation of ERK.", 
    "76": "The beneficial effects of statins are usually assumed to stem from their ability to reduce cholesterol biosynthesis. However, because statins are potent inhibitors of the mevalonate, which governs diverse cell signaling pathways, inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme-A reductase may also result in pleiotropic effects. The present study describes a novel pleiotropic effect of statins on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced glomerular endothelial cell (GEnC) hyperpermeability. Using live cell imaging with green fluorescent protein-tagged myosin regulatory light chain (MLC) and correlative biochemical analyses, we investigated 1) VEGF signaling pathway leading to GEnC hyperpermeability and 2) the modulatory effects of statins on VEGF signaling. Our findings indicate that VEGF stimulation elicits a robust increase in GEnC permeability. The signaling pathway that mediates VEGF-induced GEnC hyperpermeability involves RhoA activation leading to actin cytoskeletal remodeling, MLC diphosphorylation, and enhanced paracellular gap formation. Remarkably, cotreatment of endothelial cells with simvastatin, a hydrophobic statin, reversed VEGF-induced GEnC hyperpermeability by preventing MLC diphosphorylation, and cytoskeletal remodeling. In summary, this study identifies RhoA and MLC phosphorylation as key mediators of VEGF-induced endothelial cell hyperpermeability and demonstrates the modulatory effects of statins on VEGF signaling pathway.",

For high elevations, the prevalence ratios were lower for low doses of lovastatin than for high doses of simvastatin. A higher prevalence ratio was associated with elevated serum creatinine (SCr) levels (2.44), exposure to interacting drugs (1.62), male gender (1.48), and evidence of diabetes (1.34). For mild to moderate elevation, a higher prevalence ratio was associated with elevated SCr (1.45), exposure to interacting drugs (1.21), male gender (3.19), age < or =65 years (1.35), and evidence of diabetes (1.34). Lower prevalence ratios were associated with all doses of lovastatin compared with those of high doses of simvastatin.",

The AVs were examined for cellular proliferation, Lrp5/beta-catenin, and bone matrix markers. Bone formation was assessed by micro-computed tomography, calcein injection, and osteopontin expression. Low-density lipoprotein with and without atorvastatin was also tested in AV myofibroblasts for cellular proliferation and regulation of the Lrp5/beta-catenin pathway. Our results demonstrate that the cholesterol diet induced complex bone formations in the calcified AVs with an increase in the Lrp5 receptors, osteopontin, and p42/44 expression. Atorvastatin reduced bone formation, cellular proliferation, and Lrp5/beta-catenin protein levels in the AVs.

    "105": "Experiments were carried out on 36 male New Zealand White rabbits, 13 normal and 23 CHF. All rabbits were identically instrumented to record mean arterial pressure, heart rate, and renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA). Echocardiography was used to monitor cardiac function. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence were used to measure gene expression of Ang II type 1 receptor and NAD(P)H oxidase subunits and NAD(P)H oxidase activity in the rostral ventrolateral medulla. Compared with the CHF control group, SIM significantly reduced the central Ang II-induced pressor and sympathoexcitatory responses, decreased baseline RSNA (57.3+/-3.2% to 22.4+/-2.1% of maximum, P<0.05), increased baroreflex control of heart rate (gain(max), 1.6+/-0.3 to 4.5+/-0.2 bpm/mm Hg, P<0.05), and increased RSNA (gain(max), 1.7+/-0.2% to 4.9+/-0.6% of maximum/mm Hg, P<0.01). Importantly, SIM improved left ventricular function (EF, 32.4+/-4.1% to 51.7+/-3.2%, P<0.05). SIM also downregulated mRNA and protein expression of Ang II type 1 receptor and NAD(P)H oxidase subunits and inhibited NAD(P)H oxidase activity in the rostral ventrolateral medulla of CHF rabbits. Chronic intracerebroventricular infusion of Ang II completely abolished the aforementioned effects of SIM in CHF rabbits.", 
    "106": "These data strongly suggest that SIM normalizes autonomic function in CHF by inhibiting central Ang II mechanisms and therefore the superoxide pathway. These data also demonstrate that SIM improves left ventricular function in pacing-induced CHF rabbits.",

The mechanisms of these beneficial effects are reviewed. Altered inflammatory responses and improved endothelial function mediated by statins are thought to be, in part, responsible for the reduction in cardiovascular events. It has not been well established whether statins confer similar benefits to the kidney. In this review, we critically consider the available data whereby dyslipidemia mediates renal dysfunction by modulating the inflammatory response to diverse cytokines. We also review the emerging database suggesting that statins may modulate renal dysfunction by altering the response of the kidney to dyslipidemia, particularly in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and post-kidney transplant.", 
    "108": "The high incidence of activating RAS mutations, coupled with accumulating evidence linking RAS to multiple myeloma (MM) pathogenesis, indicate that novel therapies utilising inhibitors of RAS prenylation and signalling may be successful in the management of this disease. While preclinical studies investigating prenylation inhibitors, such as lovastatin, farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTI) and geranylgeranyltransferase inhibitors (GGTI), have been promising, recent phase I/II clinical trials with FTI R115777 were disappointing, suggesting resistance to FTI monotherapy. To address this issue, the effects of FTI, GGTI and lovastatin alone and in combination were analysed in MM cell lines and primary cells. FTI treatment blocked H-RAS processing, but was ineffective at inhibiting K- and N-RAS prenylation because of alternative geranylgeranylation of these isoforms. However, combinations of FTI and GGTI or lovastatin were found to synergistically inhibit MM cell proliferation, migration, K- and N-RAS processing, RAS-to-mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling and to induce apoptosis. In contrast to FTI, lovastatin and some GGTI were found to cause intracellular accumulation of Rho proteins. Our results suggest that clinical efficacy of prenylation inhibitors in MM are limited by alternative prenylation of several small G-proteins, such as RhoB, K- and N-RAS. Furthermore, strategies combining FTI with GGTI or statins may provide greater efficacy in MM treatment.",

    "110": "Gene therapy with vasoactive endothelial growth factor, neurotrophic substances such as nerve growth factor and neurotrophin-3 are reported to reverse or protect against neurotoxicity in animal models. The neuroprotective effects of more established therapeutic agents like vitamin E, tacrolimus (FK 506) and erythropoietin hold promise for the immediate future. Cisplatin and high-dose pyridoxine are used more frequently to produce robust models of peripheral neuropathy in animals. Statins do appear to cause peripheral neuropathy. The incidence is low, however, and compared to its benefits in terms of cardiovascular protection, relatively innocuous. The profile of thalidomide neuropathy is becoming clearer as the indications for this drug increases. The incidence of thalidomide neuropathy is high, up to three quarters in some series, and although the information on dose dependency is variable, lower cumulative doses appear to be less toxic. Like thalidomide bortezomib, a novel proteosome inhibitor, is reportedly effective in the treatment of multiple myeloma and is associated with peripheral neuropathy. Oxaliplatin and epothilone are emerging anticancer drugs with neurotoxic potential. Similarly, leflunomide, a new disease modifying-agent approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, is reported to cause neuropathy.",

Heart rate variability measurements were performed in 86 patients with coronary heart disease and an ICD implant. The number of events with ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia were recorded during a 12-month period. This study lends little support for an antiarrhythmic effect of statins or any relation between plasma lipids and lipoproteins and malignant ventricular arrhythmias in patients with an ICD.",

Compared to 40 mg atorvastatin alone, combination therapy with 10 mg ezetimibe and 10 mg atorvastatin for 8 weeks resulted in significantly decreased total serum cholesterol and triglycerides levels (n = 14). Endothelium-dependent, acetylcholine-mediated vasodilation was significantly better with combination therapy (p < 0.05). In contrast, endothelium-independent forearm blood flow response to sodium nitroprusside was comparable in both groups. Our data suggest a more effective restoration of endothelial function with the statin/ezetimibe combination compared to statin monotherapy in patients with the metabolic syndrome.",

She presented with typical features of dermatomyositis 2 years after she started a treatment with pravastatin. The treatment was discontinued and she slowly improved, with a transient dermocorticosteroid treatment. Eight other patients with dermatomyositis and chronic treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are reported in the literature. All of them presented with classical features of dermatomyositis. The discontinuation of the treatment was followed by spontaneous clinical and biological improvement in 3/9 patients. The other patients received high doses of corticosteroids and improved, except one patient who died of respiratory failure (pulmonary fibrosis) despite the adjunction of oral cyclophosphamide [Endoxan]. In these patients, dermatomyositis can be considered as a severe adverse reaction to HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors although a distinct casual link cannot be definitely established.",

Cholesterol feeding also increased apoB levels but decreased the LDL-PAF-AH/LDL-C ratio and did not change the plasma PAF-AH/lyso-PC ratio. Simvastatin treatment did not affect apoB levels and only slightly increased the LDL-PAF-AH/LDL-C ratio. Secretion of PAF-AH activity from monocyte-derived macrophages was increased by cholesterol feeding but not affected by simvastatin treatment. These results indicate that PAF-AH activity is increased by cholesterol feeding due to increased secretion of PAF-AH activity from macrophages and that PAF-AH activity is decreased by simvastatin due to increased removal of lipid and enzyme contents of LDL particles.",

No significant difference was found between groups with respect to patient age, sex, or body mass index. There was no significant difference in the percent decrease in LDL cholesterol levels (mean [SD], 38.2% [11.6%] decrease for the pitavastatin group vs 39.4% [12.9%] decrease for the simvastatin group [P = 0.648]). Also, there were no significant differences between the 2 study groups in the percent changes in total cholesterol, triglyceride, or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels from baseline to study end. No significant difference was observed for the proportion of patients who achieved the LDL cholesterol goal of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III: 93.9% (46/49) of patients in the pitavastatin group and 91.3% (42/46) of patients in the simvastatin group (P = 0.709) met the target level. At least 1 clinical adverse event and at least 1 adverse drug reaction were observed in 25.0% (13/52) and 11.5% (6/52), respectively, of patients in the pitavastatin group, and 37.3% (19/51) and 23.5% (12/51), respectively, in the simvastatin group; this difference was not statistically significant. The most common adverse event was an elevation in creatine kinase levels >2 times the upper limit of normal in 3.8% of pitavastatin-treated patients and 9.8% of simvastatin-treated patients (P = 0.269).

    "126": "Statins, which are 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, are the most effective agents for the lowering of cholesterol in clinical practice. In addition to their lipid-lowering properties, statins also have immunomodulatory activities. Animal studies have shown that statins promote a T helper 2 (T(H)2) bias and suppress the secretion of T helper 1 (T(H)1) cytokines. We therefore examine whether atorvastatin modulates the T(H)1/T(H)2 responses in human T cells. Using primary T cells as well as differentiated T(H)1 and T(H)2 cells, the immunomodulatory effect of atorvastatin on cells secreting IFN-gamma (T(H)1 response) and IL-4 (T(H)2 response) was investigated. Atorvastatin had no effect on cells secreting IFN-gamma and IL-4 in primary T cells stimulated with anti-CD3 and -CD28 antibodies. Similarly, cells producing IFN-gamma and IL-4 in stable differentiated T(H)1 and T(H)2 cells were unaffected by atorvastatin. Furthermore, atorvastatin had no effect on the ratio of IFN-gamma+/IL-4+ cells during the differentiation of T(H)0 cells to T(H)1 and T(H)2 cells in long-term cultures. These data suggest that atorvastatin does not have any immunomodulatory effect on the T(H)1/T(H)2 balance in human T cells in vitro.", 
    "127": "A forced degradation study was successfully applied for the development of a stability-indicating assay method for determination of rosuvastatin Ca in the presence of its degradation products. The method was developed and optimized by analyzing the forcefully degraded samples. Degradation of the drug was done at various pH values. Moreover, the drug was degraded under oxidative, photolytic, and thermal stress conditions. Mass balance between assay values of degraded samples and generated impurities was found to be satisfactory. The proposed method was able to resolve all of the possible degradation products formed during the stress study. The developed method was successfully applied for an accelerated stability study of the tablet formulation. The major impurities generated during the accelerated stability study of the tablet formulation were matches with those of the forced degradation study. The developed method was validated for determination of rosuvastatin Ca, and the method was found to be equally applicable to study the impurities formed during routine and forced degradation of rosuvastatin Ca.", 
    "128": "Recently, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), potent inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis, have been linked to protective effects on bone metabolism. Because of their widespread use, prevention of bone loss and fractures would be a desirable side effect. However, the mechanisms how statins may affect bone metabolism are poorly defined. Here, we evaluated the effect of atorvastatin on osteoblastic production of receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL) and osteoprotegerin (OPG), cytokines that are essential for osteoclast cell biology. While RANKL enhances osteoclast formation and activation, thereby, promoting bone loss, OPG acts as a soluble decoy receptor and antagonizes the effects of RANKL. In primary human osteoblasts (hOB), atorvastatin increased OPG mRNA levels and protein secretion by hOB by up to three fold in a dose-dependent manner with a maximum effect at 10(-6) M (P < 0.001). Time course experiments indicated a time-dependent stimulatory effect of atorvastatin on OPG mRNA levels after 24 h and on OPG protein secretion after 48-72 h (P < 0.001). Treatment of hOB with substrates of cholesterol biosynthesis that are downstream of the HMG-CoA reductase reaction (mevalonate, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate) reversed atorvastatin-induced enhancement of OPG production. Of note, atorvastatin abrogated the inhibitory effect of glucocorticoids on OPG production. Treatment of hOB with atorvastatin enhanced the expression of osteoblastic differentiation markers, alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin. In summary, our data suggest that atorvastatin enhances osteoblastic differentiation and production of OPG. This may contribute to the bone-sparing effects of statins.", 
    "129": "Dyslipoproteinemias such as elevated LDL-cholesterol, reduced HDL-cholesterol, elevated triglycerides and elevated lipoprotein(a) play a central role in atherosclerosis. An elevated LDL concentration is pro-atherogenic because LDL are intimately linked to oxidative and inflammatory processes in the arterial wall. HDL on the other hand are anti-atherogenic because they mediate cholesterol efflux from the arterial wall, modulate the metabolism of atherogenic lipoproteins, and directly affect endothelial function. The current therapeutic focus is on LDL reduction and much less on HDL elevation, although fibrates and particularly nicotinic-acid/niacin are potent drugs to increase HDL-cholesterol and although both groups of drugs have been proven beneficial in large end-point studies. Furthermore, new HDL raising drugs are being developed. In patients with established atherosclerosis or at high risk for atherosclerosis statin-based LDL reduction will remain the cornerstone of lipid therapy, but many patients may benefit from combination therapy aiming at optimizing all lipid parameters.",

Persistence with statin therapy fell to 67% in the first 6 months after treatment and continued to decline over the next 3 years to 39%. At 3 years, persistence varied significantly with statin agents. After controlling for individual patients' demographic and clinical characteristics, we found that patients who were prescribed fluvastatin, lovastatin and atorvastatin had a higher rate of cessation than those on simvastatin and pravastatin. The adjusted rate ratio of ceasing statin agents in patients with other risk factors of cardiovascular disease, such as diabetes (HR: 0.78; 0.75-0.82) or hypertension (HR: 0.72; 0.69-0.74), demonstrated a lower cessation rate.

Because of their widespread use, many patients undergo surgical procedures while on statins. Statins, in addition to cholesterol-lowering effects, also have anticoagulant, immunosuppressive, and antiproliferative properties that may affect the risk of local wound complications. This study investigated the relationship between statins and postoperative wound complications in a large cohort of patients undergoing inguinal or ventral hernia repair. Data mining was performed in the Veterans Integrated Service Network (VISN)16 Data Warehouse. This database contains clinical and demographic information about all veterans cared for at the ten VA Medical Centers that comprise the South Central VA Healthcare Network in the mid-south region of the US. Aggregate data (age, body mass index, smoking history, gender, race, history of diabetes, statin use, and postoperative wound complications) were obtained for all patients who underwent inguinal or ventral hernia repair during the period October 1, 1996-November 30, 2004. During the period of the query, 10,782 patients (10,676 male, 106 female), 1,242 (11.5%) of whom received statins, underwent herniorrhaphy. Statin use did not affect the risk of wound infection or delayed wound healing. Statin use was, however, associated with an increased rate of local postoperative bleeding complications (P=0.01). When the type of hernia, age, smoking, diabetes, and body mass index were included in a multivariate analysis, statins remained borderline significant as an independent predictor of wound hematoma/postoperative bleeding (P=0.04), odds ratio 1.6 (95% CI 1.03-2.44). Patients who undergo inguinal herniorrhaphy while on statins have an increased risk of postoperative wound hematoma/hemorrhage. Focus on additional factors that may affect the propensity to postoperative bleeding and on meticulous intraoperative hemostasis are particularly important in such patients.",

    "140": "Glioblastoma is a fatal brain tumor that becomes highly vascularized by secreting proangiogenic factors and depends on continued angiogenesis to increase in size. Consequently, a successful antiangiogenic therapy should provide long-term inhibition of tumor-induced angiogenesis, suggesting long-term gene transfer as a therapeutic strategy. In this study a soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (sFlt-1) and an angiostatin-endostatin fusion gene (statin-AE) were codelivered to human glioblastoma xenografts by nonviral gene transfer using the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon. In subcutaneously implanted xenografts, co-injection of both transgenes showed marked anti-tumor activity as demonstrated by reduction of tumor vessel density, inhibition or abolition of glioma growth, and increase in animal survival (P = 0.003). Using luciferase-stable engrafted intracranial gliomas, the anti-tumor effect of convection-enhanced delivery of plasmid DNA into the tumor was assessed by luciferase in vivo imaging. Sustained tumor regression of intracranial gliomas was achieved only when statin-AE and sFlt-1 transposons were coadministered with SB-transposase-encoding DNA to facilitate long-term expression. We show that SB can be used to increase animal survival significantly (P = 0.008) by combinatorial antiangiogenic gene transfer in an intracranial glioma model.",

In certain age groups, the risk can be >50 times that of an age-matched population. This population also has an increased prevalence of several key classic risk factors that contribute to the CHD development. Chronic inflammation, anti-phospholipid antibodies and exposure to steroid therapy are also likely to have an impact. We have adopted a proactive approach to classic risk factor management with 'ideal targets' based on viewing SLE as a CHD equivalent condition. In this context, a significant proportion of SLE patients (approximately 30%) will require statins and the majority would be treated with aspirin prophylaxis. Better control of the underlying inflammatory disease is also likely to play an important role and the relative safety of anti-malarials allows their consideration as an adjunct in a large proportion of patients. Well-conducted clinical trials are now needed to advance beyond these initial recommendations.",

    "143": "Thromboembolism is a common cause of death and disability. Heparin or warfarin, the current standard management for thromboembolism may cause serious bleeding complications. Thrombin is the key enzyme of coagulation. Hirudin, the most potent natural thrombin-specific inhibitor, was first isolated from leech salivary fluid. Synthetic thrombin-specific inhibitors are rationally designed based on the knowledge on the structures of the activate site of thrombin. Thrombin-specific inhibitors are the current best choice for the treatment of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). Recombinant hirudins (such as desirudin) were also approved for the prevention of thrombosis after hip or knee surgery. Bivalirudin (hirulog-1 or Angiomax), in adjunct to aspirin, was approved for prevention of thrombosis in patients with unstable angina following angioplasty. Argatroban has been used for the treatment of HIT, peripheral and cerebral thrombotic diseases. The benefit of using thrombin-specific inhibitors alone in acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina remains uncertain. Some of thrombin-specific inhibitors which are small molecules are orally active. The major concern for the use of thrombin-specific inhibitors is bleeding complication. The efficacy, safety, stability and oral bioavailability may be considerably improved through structural optimization. A growing line of evidence suggests that statins, the most commonly prescribed cholesterol lowering drug, may inhibit thrombin generation. Statins do not cause bleeding and have an outstanding safety profile. The findings suggest that further development of thrombin-specific inhibitors and exploration of the potential applications of non-specific thrombin inhibitors, including statins, may improve the prevention and management of thromboembotic events.",

These cells were used in a panel of cell-based assays for a parallel assessment of CYP3A4 induction, metabolism, and inhibition at the cellular level. CYP3A4 induction in the DPX-2 cell line by various agents was monitored in 96-well plates by a luciferase-based transcriptional activation assay. Of the prototypical CYP3A4 inducers examined, all exhibited elevated luciferase activity in DPX-2 cells. CYP3A4 enzyme activity in noninduced and rifampicin-induced DPX-2 cells was also assessed using Vivid fluorogenic substrates. Significantly elevated CYP3A4 activity levels (2.8-fold +/- 0.2-fold above DMSO-treated cells) were found in DPX-2 cells after 48 hours of exposure to rifampicin, but were undetectable in parental HepG2 cells. Rifampicin-induced activity levels were found to be suitable for assessing the inhibitory potential of new chemical entities in downstream CYP3A4 inhibition assays. The elevated CYP3A4 activity was inhibited 85% by 10 microM ketoconazole. In addition, a cytotoxicity assay to correct for possible toxic effects of compounds at the cellular level was applied. The comparative data obtained with a combination of the above assays suggests that the application of several independent in vitro technologies used in DPX-2 cells is the best possible strategy for the assessment of the complex phenomena of CYP3A4 induction and inhibition.", 
    "149": "Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) are the most commonly used lipid lowering drugs. Recent experimental evidence suggest that these agents appear to display additional cholesterol independent or pleiotropic effects, contributing to prevention and inhibition of atherosclerosis. In addition, clinical trials have demonstrated different effects of statins on diseases that are not directly related to accelerated atherosclerosis. The statins' vascular pleiotropic effects include improvement of endothelial function, slowing the inflammation process, inhibition of the thrombus formation, enhancement of plaque stability and decreasing oxidative stress. Clinical benefits were observed with statins therapy for cardiovascular diseases - ischemic heart disease, cerebral vascular accidents and peripheral vascular disease. Lately, clinical trials have suggested their role in Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, malignant diseases, osteoporosis, chronic renal diseases, transplantations, macular degeneration and autoimmune diseases. The objective of this review is to summarize the data related to the pleiotropic effects of the statin drugs, beyond their lipid lowering effect.", 
    "150": "Changes were observed in the ultrastructure of the pancreatic acinar cells in rats after administration of atorvastatin (Sortis) in the therapeutic and ten times larger dose for the period of 6 weeks. It was found that atorvastatin given to rats in the therapeutic dose (80 mg/day) stimulated the secretion in pancreocytes, whereas the ten times higher dose of atorvastatin distorts the complicated process of the release of the secretion from the cell.", 
    "151": "The rats received atorvastatin in the therapeutical dose and 10x higher, 20% solution of ethanol and ethanol with atorvastatin for 6 weeks. The microscopic investigations (H + E staining, Masson's method, PAS method by McManus) showed no changes in histological picture of intestinal mucosa after giving atorvastatin. The rats receiving alcohol and alcohol with atorvastatin showed similar changes, but different than the first groups. Under the epithelium of intestinal villi there were observed light, vesicle-like spaces, separation of epithelium from connective tissue stroma, also lack of the epithelium of the top of villi and hyperaemia of stroma of villi. The observed changes were stronger in rats receiving simultaneously alcohol and atorvastatin in the dose 10x higher than therapeutical. Hyperaemia of connective tissue of stroma of villi was still visible after month period of administration.", 
    "152": "The investigation was carried out on 15 Wistar rats--males weighing about 200 mg each. The animals were divided into three groups: one control group and two experimental groups, with five animals in each. In experimental group I the animals received emulsion of Atorvastatin in distilled water at the therapeutical dose of 80 mg/kg of body mass, by stomach tube for 6 weeks. In experimental group II the animals received atorvastatin at the maximal dose of 800 mg/kg of body mass. Skeletal muscles of experimental animals (rats) after 6 weeks' administration of atorvastatin in therapeutical and maximal dosages did not show any essential differences in comparison with the control group, when examined under light microscope. Degenerative changes were observed after Atorvastatin administration, when examined under electron microscope. These changes were dependent upon dosage and were directly proportional to dosage rate. Six-week administration of Atorvastatin in the therapeutical dose (80 mg/kg b. m.) produced invagination of the nuclear envelope into the cell nucleus, and within the cytoplasm, numerous vacuoles, some of which included the myelin structures, were evident. Atorvastatin administration in maximal dosage (800 mg/kg) under electron microscope examination, showed the following differences: the appearance of numerous vacuoles in the perinuclear spaces, and between myofibrils; dilation of mitochondria; disintegration of sacomers; fibrinosis within the intercellular spaces.",

    "154": "The supernates of LPS-induced cultured human pulmonary epithelial cells from different intervention groups were collected to measure the concentrations of PGE2 and IL-6 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.", 
    "155": "The concentrations of PGE2 and IL-6 in supernates of LPS-induced human pulmonary epithelial cells were significantly higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05) at different time-points. The concentrations of PGE2 and IL-6 in supernates of atorvastatin intervention groups at different levels were significantly lower than those in non-intervention group (P < 0.05).", 
    "156": "Atorvastatin decreased LPS-induced PGE2 and IL-6 secretions in human pulmonary epithelial cells (A549), which suggests that statins have anti-inflammatory properties on human pulmonary epithelial cells.", 
    "157": "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the US and other industrialised societies. Rosuvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, is the most efficacious lipid-lowering agent of the statin class. New guidelines and recent evidence-based studies confirm the benefit of intensive reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in terms of cardiovascular risk reduction. Both naturally occurring and synthetic statins have demonstrated significant lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, the primary target of cholesterol-lowering therapy. Rosuvastatin, specifically, is a synthetic statin shown to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides, in addition to increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Compared with other statins, there is a similar low risk of serious muscle damage (myopathy and rhabdomyolysis), and no consistent pattern of renal failure or renal injury, despite mild transient tubular proteinuria, as seen with all statins. Therefore, rosuvastatin offers an effective alternative in the clinical management of hyperlipidaemia, while awaiting the results of ongoing cardiovascular risk reduction trials.", 
    "158": "The importance of statin therapy in lipid-lowering and its role in primary and secondary prevention has been borne out of numerous clinical trials conducted over the last two decades. Concurrently, much concern has been expressed over the safety and tolerability of these drugs. Fluvastatin has demonstrated good clinical efficacy and safety. This paper reviews the various pharmacological properties and evidence supporting its use in the prevention of cardiac events.", 
    "159": "A 42-year-old woman received a 6-month course of simvastatin (20 mg/d) for hypercholesterolemia. Despite an infection with fever, fatigue, myalgias, and lumbar pain, she continued to perform her regular sports activities. Neurologic examination revealed bilateral ptosis and slight upper limb weakness. Serum creatine kinase was 41,000 U/L. Needle electromyography was nonspecifically abnormal. Discontinuation of simvastatin and reduction of the sports activities was followed by a prompt continual lowering of the elevated muscle enzymes to normal values over a 2-week period. The patient's infection, regular sports activity despite the infection, and a suspected mitochondrial defect were regarded as triggers of rhabdomyolysis.", 
    "160": "A specific, accurate, precise and reproducible high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method was developed and validated for the simultaneous quantitation of five 3-hydroxy-3-methyglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, viz. atorvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin and simvastatin, in pharmaceutical formulations and extended the application to in vitro metabolism studies of these statins. Ternary gradient elution at a flow rate of 1 mL/min was employed on an Intertisl ODS 3V column (4.6 x 250 mm, 5 microm) at ambient temperature. The mobile phase consisted of 0.01 m ammonium acetate (pH 5.0), acetonitrile and methanol. Theophylline was used as an internal standard (IS). The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and their metabolites were monitored at a wavelength of 237 nm. Drugs were found to be 89.6-105.6% of their label's claim in the pharmaceutical formulations. For in vitro metabolism studies the reaction mixtures were extracted with simple liquid-liquid extraction using ethyl acetate. Baseline separation of statins and their metabolites along with IS free from endogenous interferences was achieved. Nominal retention times of IS, atorvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin and simvastatin were 7.5, 17.2, 21.6, 28.5, 33.5 and 35.5 min, respectively. The proposed method is simple, selective and could be applicable for routine analysis of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in pharmaceutical preparations as well as in vitro metabolism studies.",

    "162": "Patients with the metabolic syndrome with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) > or =3.36 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) and multiple risk factors conferring a 10-year coronary heart disease risk score of >10% were randomized (2:2:1) to receive rosuvastatin 10 mg, atorvastatin 10 mg, or placebo for 6 weeks. Subsequently, the rosuvastatin 10 mg and placebo groups received rosuvastatin 20 mg and the atorvastatin 10 mg group received atorvastatin 20 mg for 6 weeks. LDL-C was reduced significantly more in patients receiving rosuvastatin 10 mg when compared with those receiving atorvastatin 10 mg at 6 weeks [intention-to-treat (ITT) population by randomized treatment: 41.7 vs. 35.7%, P < 0.001; ITT population by as-allocated treatment: 42.7 vs. 36.6%, P < 0.001]. Significant LDL-C reductions were also observed in patients receiving rosuvastatin when compared with those receiving atorvastatin at 12 weeks (48.9 vs. 42.5%, P < 0.001). More patients achieved LDL-C goals with rosuvastatin when compared with atorvastatin. Rosuvastatin increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol significantly more than atorvastatin. Treatments were well tolerated.", 
    "163": "At equivalent doses, rosuvastatin had a significantly greater effect than atorvastatin in lowering LDL-C and improving the lipid profile and was well tolerated in patients with the metabolic syndrome.", 
    "164": "Modified (oxidized) low-density lipoprotein (LDL) plays a significant role in atherosclerosis by accumulation in arteries. Also, glycated LDL, such as in diabetics, are increasing the risk for atherosclerosis, due to an increased oxidizability as compared to native LDL. For these reasons, the potential inhibition of such modifications is of clinical importance. We investigated the influence of simvastatin on oxidation of native and modified LDL as well as high-density lipoprotein (HDL), which plays a protective role in atherosclerosis. Quantitative assessment of the oxidation end-product malondialdehyde (MDA) revealed the highest inhibitory rate for HDL at concentrations of 1.6 microg/ml and 0.8 microg/ml by 30.3% and 20.4%, at 6 h and 4 h, respectively. At 24 h, the inhibition was still persisting amounting to 27.9% and 20.3%, respectively. For native LDL, we found less inhibition of oxidation at a concentration of 1.6 microg/ml amounting to 19.2% and 11.5%, for 4 h and 6 h, respectively. Similar effects were found at a concentration of 0.8 microg/ml. For modified, glycated LDL, the most pronounced effect was found at a concentration of 1.6 microg/ml amounting to 22.4% for the period of 2-24 h of oxidation. For glycoxidated LDL, the inhibition of oxidation was less expressed amounting to 10.1% for the period of 2-6 h at the same concentration. The influence of simvastatin on lag time (protection from oxidation) by diene conjugation was also investigated. At the highest concentration of simvastatin (1.6 microg/ml), we found a prolongation of lag time from 73 min to 99 min for native LDL, for glycoxidated LDL 60 min to 89 min and for HDL 54 min to 64 min. For glycated LDL, only a small decrease of lag time (66 min versus 71 min) at same concentration was observed. For glycated and glycoxidated LDL, we found a moderate increase in relative electrophoretic mobility (REM) by 2.0 and 2.3, respectively, but no changes in the presence of simvastatin were observed. These data show that simvastatin besides its lipid-lowering action has also significant antioxidative properties.",

    "166": "In this observational study, we retrospectively reviewed data pertaining to 5-year follow-up of patients who underwent heart transplantation between 1993 and 1996 and who survived the first 30 days after transplantation. Patients were assigned to groups according to whether or not they received pravastatin after transplantation, and then compared with regard to transplant rejection, transplant coronary artery disease, and survival.", 
    "167": "Ninety-one patients received pravastatin after transplantation, whereas 37 did not receive any statins and served as controls. Pravastatin did not affect the overall incidence of rejections or number of rejection episodes. Hemodynamically significant rejection episodes occurred in 5 patients (5%) in the pravastatin group and 4 patients (11%) in the control group. Thus, pravastatin treatment apparently reduced the incidence of hemodynamically significant rejection episodes by 50% (p = 0.04). Transplant coronary artery disease (CAD) occurred in 10 patients (11%) in the pravastatin group and 9 patients (24%) in the control group. Treatment with pravastatin significantly reduced the incidence of transplant CAD (p = 0.05). Three- and 5-year survival rates in the pravastatin group were significantly better than in the control group (87% vs 68% and 82% vs 58%, respectively; p = 0.009).", 
    "168": "Pravastatin therapy offers long-term benefits to heart transplant recipients. It improves 5-year survival, lowers the risk of transplant CAD, and lowers the incidence of hemodynamically significant rejection episodes.", 
    "169": "Ischemic preconditioning (PC) is a polygenic defensive cellular adaptive phenomenon of the heart to ischemic stress, whereby the heart changes its phenotype to become more resistant to subsequent ischemia. Early and late of PC represent two chronologically and pathophysiologically distinct phases of this phenomenon, which can be recruited pharmacologically. We represent a post hoc analysis examining the late PC-mimetic effects of nitroglycerin (NTG) on peri-procedural myocardial necrosis during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). A group of 66 patients presenting with angina were randomized, 24 h prior to a scheduled PCI for single obstructive CAD, to a 4 h pretreatment with intravenous NTG or saline. Measurements of electrocardiographic ST-segment shifts, echocardiographic regional wall motion and angina scores demonstrated that NTG pre-treatment preconditioned the heart by rendering it resistant to ischemia during balloon inflations. NTG-pretreated patients exhibited trends towards lower average peak CK (131.1 vs. 188.6 U/L, P = 0.38) and CK-MB levels (7.1 vs. 12.6 ng/ml, P = 0.40). NTG, however, had no significant impact on the incidence of post-procedural MI or any cardiac enzyme elevation. The exploitation of ischemic and pharmacological PC may prove a useful strategy to confer cardioprotection during high-risk PCI and is worth exploring.",

Impact on the autonomic nervous system was assessed by anonymised short-term (20 min) standardised supine heart rate variability analyses.", 
    "172": "Two subjects withdrew one due to decompensation and one due to gastric intolerance. The remaining subjects completed both monitoring events without changes in standard medicines. Frequency domain but not time domain HRV indices improved with active statin therapy suggesting beneficial effects in attenuating sympathetic tone.", 
    "173": "In this small study we saw short-term high potency statin treatment had a beneficial impact on frequency domain HRV measures suggestive of an impact on sympatho-activation. We found no effect on time domain HRV indices. This may suggest a lesser or no effect on parasympathetic tone.", 
    "174": "Statins promptly lower rates of adverse cardiovascular events in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS). These therapeutic properties may be mediated by the effects of statins on key hemostatic factors.

Venous blood was sampled as soon as possible upon admission, before and 6 h after administration of study drug and standard anti-ischemic therapy.", 
    "176": "Mean sEPCR concentrations decreased significantly in patients treated with fluvastatin (-8.1 +/- 6.7% from baseline) and was unchanged in the placebo group (-2.3 +/- 14.4%, P = 0.007 vs. fluvastatin). Though fTFPI increased significantly after the administration of both fluvastatin and placebo, the mean increase after fluvastatin (450+/-436%) was significantly greater than after placebo (155+/-141%, P = 0.001).",

    "179": "The subjects were 22 type 2 diabetic patients with hypercholesterolemia, who received atorvastatin at a daily dose of 10 mg for 6 months. Before and after the treatment with atorvastatin, we measured pulse wave velocity (PWV) in the heart-brachial, heart-carotid, heart-femoral and femoral-ankle segments.", 
    "180": "Following treatment with atorvastatin, femoral-ankle PWV showed a significant reduction. The PWV of other arterial segments tended to decrease, although the changes were not statistically significant.

    "182": "It is currently accepted that the consumption of fruit-derived antioxidants such as vitamin C, carotenoids, and flavonoids provides a preventive effect against cardiovascular disease. The purpose of the present study was to investigate potential cardiovascular protective properties of aqueous and 70% ethanol extracts from kiwifruit by analyzing the antioxidative, antihypertensive, hypocholesterolemic, and fibrinolytic activities in vitro. Aqueous and 70% ethanol extracts at 50 mg/ml showed DPPH-radical scavenging activities of 72.31% and 70.75%, respectively. Total antioxidant activity in linoleic acid emulsion was 85-88% at 10 mg/ml and 96-98% at 50 mg/ml of kiwifruit extract. Inhibitory activities against angiogensin I-converting enzyme of kiwifruit extracts were 21-26% at 10 mg/ml and 46-49% at 50 mg/ml, and inhibitory activities on HMG-CoA reductase were 13-14% at 10 mg/ml and 19-30% at 50 mg/ml. Fibrinolytic activity of kiwifruit was also observed at a high concentration of 100 mg/ml in both aqueous and 70% EtOH extracts. Based on our results, kiwifruit have potential cardiovascular protective properties in vitro.", 
    "183": "The role of C-reactive protein (CRP) in atherogenesis has been supported by more recent data. Some studies have demonstrated marked up-regulation inflammatory responses in endothelial cells subjected to CRP. The nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signal transduction is known to play a key role in the expression of these proatherogenic entities. Statins have anti-inflammatory properties independent of their cholesterol-lowering effects. Therefore, we studied the effects of CRP and lovastatin on NF-kappaB activation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). By using an electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA), we found that CRP (50 microg/ml) increased activation of NF-kappaB and degradation of inhibitory kappa B (IkappaB) in HUVECs, reaching a maximal effect after the incubation with CRP for 1 h. Lovastatin (10(-5) mol/l) diminished NF-kappaB activation induced by CRP. Furthermore, lovastatin may block NF-kappaB activation by causing a stabilization of the IkappaB-alpha in cellular cytoplasm with western blotting analysis. Preincubation of HUVECs with pyrrolidinethiocarbamate (PDTC, NF-kappaB inhibitor) diminished CD40 expression induced by CRP with flow cytometry. Our results suggest that CRP increases activation of NF-kappaB and induces CD40 expression in HUVECs partly via activation of NF-kappaB. Lovastatin, through the inhibition of NF-kappaB activation, reduces the inflammation involved in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.", 
    "184": "Three-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors are associated with adverse skeletal muscle effects, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To determine whether toxicity involves the level of drug exposure in muscle tissue and to test the effect of exercise on cerivastatin (CVA)-induced skeletal muscle damage, female rats were administered vehicle or CVA at 0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/kg/day by gavage for two weeks and exercised or not on treadmills for 20 min/day. Clinical chemistry and plasma and tissue pharmacokinetics were evaluated; light and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of Type I and Type II fiber-predominant skeletal muscles were performed. Serum levels of AST, ALT, CK, and plasma lactic acid were significantly elevated dose-dependently. CVA treatment decreased psoas and quadriceps weights. At 1 mg/kg all muscles except soleus demonstrated degeneration. Exercise-exacerbated severity of CVA-induced degeneration was evident in all muscles sampled except soleus and quadriceps. Early mitochondrial involvement in toxicity is suggested by the numerous membranous whorls and degenerate mitochondria observed in muscles at 0.5 mg/kg. No significant differences in CVA concentrations between either EDL and soleus or plasma and muscle were found. We found that CVA had no effect on cleaved caspase 3. In summary, we found that treadmill exercise exacerbated the incidence and severity of CVA-induced damage in Type II fiber-predominant muscles. Tissue exposure is likely not the key factor mediating CVA-induced skeletal muscle toxicity."
