It gives the results of studies of the primary prevention of atherosclerosis and the treatment of hyperlipidemias with lovastatin, pravastatin, and fluvastatin. Emphasis is laid on trial data on the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of simvastatin (zocor). The results of studies, including regression ones, of this drug in different doses, controlled by biochemical, clinical, magnet resonance imaging, and ultrasonic data are summarized. There is a significant reduction in the risk of cardiovascular, coronary, and overall deaths and in that of stroke. There is evidence for the successful use of simvastatin (zocor) in combined therapy with fibrates, nicotinic acid, and ezetrol.", 
    "1": "A randomized trial of a pharmacist-delivered intervention (PI) versus usual care (UC) was conducted; 689 subjects with known coronary heart disease were recruited from cardiac catheterization laboratories. Participants in the PI condition received 5 pharmacist-delivered telephone counseling calls post-hospital discharge. At one year, 65% in the PI condition and 60% in the UC condition achieved an LDL-C level <100\u2009mg/dL (P = .29); mean statin adherence was 0.88 in the PI, and 0.90 in the UC (P = .51). The highest percentage of those who reached the LDL-C goal were participants who used statins as opposed to those who did not use statins (67% versus 58%, P = .05). However, only 53% and 56% of the patients in the UC and PI conditions, respectively, were using statins. We conclude that a pharmacist-delivered intervention aimed only at improving patient adherence is unlikely to positively affect outcomes. Efforts must be oriented towards influencing physicians to increase statin prescription rates.", 
    "2": "The feasibility of using preformed calcium sulfate (CS) space-making devices (SMDs) for bone regeneration was explored using a rabbit calvarial model. Twenty-four CS devices were fabricated. Twelve of these were SMDs, which consisted of a domed head that served as the actual space-maker, and a stalk or \"tail\" portion used to affix the device to the bone. A second set of control devices (CDs) was fabricated that consisted of only the tail portion. CDs were made of medical-grade CS, as were 9 of the SMDs. Six of the CS SMDs were loaded with high or low concentrations of simvastatin. The remaining 3 SMDs were made of a CS/bioactive glass composite. One SMD and 1 CD were implanted bilaterally in the parietal bones of 12 New Zealand White rabbits, which were euthanized 8 weeks following surgery. All implants were well tolerated. In all animals, the side receiving the SMD exhibited greater thickness than did the control sites. The addition of simvastatin resulted in a statistically significant difference in calvarial thickness. The CS/bioactive glass composite also yielded encouraging results. The CS resorbable SMDs are worthy of further investigation.", 
    "3": "Statins, inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, are the most potent pharmacologic agents for lowering total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). They have become an accepted standard of care in the treatment of patients with known atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (secondary prevention) and also those at increased risk of cardiovascular events. There are currently six statin drugs commercially available in the US. Although they are chemically similar and have the same primary mechanisms of action in lowering TC and LDL-C, there are differences in their efficacy or potency, metabolism, drug-drug interactions, and individual tolerability. Considering the numbers of patients who need LDL-C-lowering therapy and questions of individual tolerance and therapeutic response, having a variety of agents to choose from is beneficial for patient care. This paper presents background information on statin treatment and reviews data regarding a new agent, pitavastatin, which has recently been approved for clinical use.",

    "8": "Statin-associated muscle problems are more common than the 1-5% prevalence reported in large clinical trials. Observational studies show a prevalence of about 10%. Muscle problems can occur anytime during statin treatment, but usually occur in the first 6 months. The occurrence of rhabdomyolysis is rare. Depletion of isoprenoids due to HMG-CoA reductase inhibition is probably the main cause of the myopathy. Statin-associated myopathy is treated by prevention and treatment of risk factors. The main risk factors are multiple drug treatment, alcohol abuse, hypothyroidism and a family history of muscle problems due to statin therapy. The first step in the treatment of muscle problems or of elevated creatine kinase levels is lowering or stopping the statin. The chance of another type of statin not having the same muscular effects is about 40%.The benefit of Q10 or other supplements is unproven thus far. In the presence of recurrent creatine kinase elevation or muscle problems, other cholesterol-lowering agents can be considered.",

Self-selected practices were offered a data extraction program ('tool') free of charge, with ongoing division support. Practice representatives, either GPs, practice nurses or other practice staff members, were given instructions on how to extract data using the data extraction tool. This was followed by discussion with division staff regarding which clinical areas might be focused on. Division staff systematically recorded information about the experience of the practices and collated their clinical data.",

The practices chose from the following areas to work on as quality improvement activities: improving data entry; inactivating patient files for those who no longer attended the practice; correcting demographic information; diabetes and coronary heart disease management. The recording of data, according to the extraction tool, was found to be incomplete. For example, one-third of the patients who had HbA1cs recorded were on target, i.e. <7%, but nearly half the patients with diabetes did not have HbA1cs recorded at all. About half the patients with coronary heart disease were not reported as taking aspirin and one-third were not on a statin. Nearly half the patients who had attended their practice in the previous 30 months did not have smoking status recorded.", 
    "17": "While data extraction programs provide GPs with useful tools for examining their clinical databases and identifying clinical practice issues which could be improved, external support, such as that provided by divisions, is helpful. Technical barriers, such as the failure of extraction tools to recognise some data and the failure to comprehensively enter data, are impediments, but in spite of these considerable interest exists in the use of clinical data to improve practice.", 
    "18": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) are extremely effective at reducing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and have been demonstrated to reduce mortality and the risk of major cardiovascular events in a number of large primary and secondary prevention studies. The linear relationship between LDL-cholesterol and cardiovascular risk suggests statins work solely by reducing LDL-cholesterol, and that ancillary properties do not contribute to cardiovascular risk reduction. In recent years, however, a number of additional non-lipid-lowering, or 'pleiotropic', effects of statins have been suggested to contribute to their efficacy in cardiovascular disease. The first data to suggest that statins may have benefits beyond lipid lowering came from the Heart Protection Study, in which simvastatin reduced mortality and morbidity even in patients with 'normal' LDL-cholesterol levels (2.6\u2009mmol/L or 100\u2009mg/dL). It has since been demonstrated, however, that cardiovascular risk remains high at this LDL concentration, but is substantially reduced in those achieving levels below 2.0\u2009mmol/L (77\u2009mg/dL). Evidence for the pleiotropic effects of statins in heart failure comes largely from retrospective and subgroup analyses of large studies. When statin therapy is compared with placebo, or when high-dose statin therapy is compared with low-dose treatment, a lower incidence of heart failure or hospitalization is observed. Despite promising retrospective data, however, two prospective studies of rosuvastatin in the treatment of patients with New York Heart Association class II-IV heart failure showed no impact on the primary endpoint and only one of the studies showed a lower rate of hospitalization favouring rosuvastatin. A number of small studies has shown evidence for mechanisms of action of statins outside of LDL-cholesterol lowering, including improvements in endothelial function, halting or retardation of atheroma development, reduction in inflammation and antithrombotic effects. The linear relationship between LDL-cholesterol lowering and reduction in coronary heart disease risk, as well as a lack of conclusive evidence for other mechanisms of action raise the question of whether any cholesterol-lowering agent is equally effective for reducing cardiovascular risk, but recent data from the torcetrapib clinical trial programme suggest this is not the case. Future cholesterol-lowering modalities must be able to demonstrate efficacy and good tolerability in large-scale clinical trials.", 
    "19": "Evidence is mounting that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) have a number of pleiotropic effects over and above their lipid-lowering properties in patients with cardiovascular disease and heart failure. In addition to lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels, several studies have shown statins to improve survival and reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events in patients without established cardiovascular disease but with cardiovascular risk factors. Statins have also been shown to have beneficial effects, including a reduction in all-cause mortality, in patients with ischemic and non-ischemic congestive heart failure, and have been associated with a reduced incidence of atrial fibrillation. Furthermore, statins have been associated with improvements in renal function in patients with pre-existing renal disease or the prevention of new-onset renal dysfunction, as well as improvements in lung function in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or age-related decline in lung function. The pleiotropic effects of statins appear to result from improvements in endothelial function, a reduction in inflammatory mediators, a decline in the development of atheroma through the stabilization of atheromatous plaques, and the inhibition of cardiac hypertrophy through an antioxidant mechanism. Long-term statin use may reduce morbidity and mortality rates in a broad range of patients, and most patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease may benefit from statin treatment; however, further data are required to demonstrate conclusively whether these trends are truly independent of the lipid-lowering effects of statins.", 
    "20": "Recently, there has been renewed interest in the link between cholesterol and prostate cancer. It has been previously reported that in vitro, prostate cancer cells lack sterol-mediated feedback regulation of the major transcription factor in cholesterol homeostasis, sterol-regulatory element binding protein 2 (SREBP-2). This could explain the accumulation of cholesterol observed in clinical prostate cancers. Consequently, perturbed feedback regulation to increased sterol levels has become a pervasive concept in the prostate cancer setting. Here, we aimed to explore this in greater depth.", 
    "21": "After altering the cellular cholesterol status in LNCaP and PC-3 prostate cancer cells, we examined SREBP-2 processing, downstream effects on promoter activity and expression of SREBP-2 target genes, and functional activity (low-density lipoprotein uptake, cholesterol synthesis). In doing so, we observed that LNCaP and PC-3 cells were sensitive to increased sterol levels. In contrast, lowering cholesterol levels via statin treatment generated a greater response in LNCaP cells than PC-3 cells. This highlighted an important difference between these cell-lines: basal SREBP-2 activity appeared to be higher in PC-3 cells, reducing sensitivity to decreased cholesterol levels.", 
    "22": "Thus, prostate cancer cells are sensitive to changing sterol levels in vitro, but the extent of this regulation differs between prostate cancer cell-lines. These results shed new light on the regulation of cholesterol metabolism in two commonly used prostate cancer cell-lines, and emphasize the importance of establishing whether or not cholesterol homeostasis is perturbed in prostate cancer in vivo.", 
    "23": "In humans, defects in lipid metabolism are associated with a number of severe diseases such as atherosclerosis, obesity and type II diabetes. Hypercholesterolemia is a primary risk factor for coronary artery disease, the major cause of premature deaths in developed countries. Statins are inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR), the key enzyme of the sterol synthesis pathway. Since yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae harbours many counterparts of mammalian enzymes involved in lipid-synthesizing pathways, conclusions drawn from research with this single cell eukaryotic organism can be readily applied to higher eukaryotes. Using a yeast strain with deletions of both HMG1 and HMG2 genes (i.e. completely devoid of HMGR activity) with introduced wild-type or mutant form of human HMGR (hHMGR) gene we investigated the effects of statins on the lipid metabolism of the cell. The relative quantification of mRNA demonstrated a different effect of simvastatin on the expression of the wild-type and mutated hHMGR gene. GC/MS analyses showed a significant decrease of sterols and enhanced conversion of squalene and sterol precursors into ergosterol. This was accompanied by the mobilization of ergosterol precursors localized in lipid particles in the form of steryl esters visualized by confocal microscopy. Changes in the level of ergosterol and its precursors in cells treated with simvastatin depend on the mutation in the hHMGR gene. HPLC/MS analyses indicated a reduced level of phospholipids not connected with the mevalonic acid pathway. We detected two significant phenomena. First, cells treated with simvastatin develop an adaptive response compensating the lower activity of HMGR. This includes enhanced conversion of sterol precursors into ergosterol, mobilization of steryl esters and increased expression of the hHMGR gene. Second, statins cause a substantial drop in the level of glycerophospholipids.", 
    "24": "Oxidative stress in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) increases sympathetic nervous system activity (SNA). Oral treatment with atorvastatin decreases SNA through antioxidant effects in the RVLM of stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP). We aimed to examine whether centrally administered atorvastain reduces SNA in SHRSP and, if so, to determine whether it is associated with the reduction of oxidative stress induced by alteration of activities of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate [NAD(P)H] oxidase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the RVLM of SHRSP. SHRSP received atorvastatin (S-ATOR) or vehicle (S-VEH) by continuous intracerebroventricular infusion for 14 days. Mean blood pressure, heart rate, and SNA were significantly lower in S-ATOR than in S-VEH. Oxidative stress, Rac1 activity, NAD(P)H oxidase activity, Rac1, gp91(phox) and p22(phox) expression in the membrane fraction, and p47(phox) and p40(phox) expression in the cytosolic fraction in the RVLM were significantly lower in S-ATOR than in S-VEH. Rac1 expression in the cytosolic fraction and Mn-SOD activity, however, were significantly higher in S-ATOR than in S-VEH. Our findings suggest that centrally administered atorvastatin decreases SNA and is associated with decreasing NAD(P)H oxidase activity and upregulation of Mn-SOD activity in the RVLM of SHRSP, leading to suppressing oxidative stress.", 
    "25": "Changes in the expression of potassium channels regulate skeletal muscle development. The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression profile and pharmacological role of K(v)7 voltage-gated potassium channels in skeletal muscle differentiation, proliferation, and survival after myotoxic insults. Transcripts for all K(v)7 genes (K(v)7.1-K(v)7.5) were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and/or real-time PCR in murine C(2)C(12) myoblasts; K(v)7.1, K(v)7.3, and K(v)7.4 transcripts were up-regulated after myotube formation. Western blot experiments confirmed K(v)7.2, K(v)7.3, and K(v)7.4 subunit expression, and the up-regulation of K(v)7.3 and K(v)7.4 subunits during in vitro differentiation. In adult skeletal muscles from mice and humans, K(v)7.2 and K(v)7.3 immunoreactivity was mainly localized at the level of intracellular striations positioned between ankyrinG-positive triads, whereas that of K(v)7.4 subunits was largely restricted to the sarcolemmal membrane. In C(2)C(12) cells, retigabine (10 microM), a specific activator of neuronally expressed K(v)7.2 to K(v)7.5 subunits, reduced proliferation, accelerated myogenin expression, and inhibited the myotoxic effect of mevastatin (IC(50) approximately 7 microM); all these effects of retigabine were prevented by the K(v)7 channel blocker 10,10-bis(4-pyridinylmethyl)-9(10H)-anthracenone (XE-991) (10 muM). These data collectively highlight neural K(v)7 channels as significant pharmacological targets to regulate skeletal muscle proliferation, differentiation, and myotoxic effects of drugs.", 
    "26": "Statins inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, and they are widely used to control plasma cholesterol levels and prevent cardiovascular disease. However, emerging evidence indicates that the beneficial effects of statins extend to the CNS. Statins have been shown to improve the outcome of stroke and traumatic brain injury, and statin use has been associated with a reduced prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia. However, prospective studies with statins in AD have produced mixed results. Recently, we reported that simvastatin, a widely used statin in humans, enhances learning and memory in non-transgenic mice as well as in transgenic mice with AD-like pathology on a mixed genetic background. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of simvastatin on learning and memory remain elusive. The present study was undertaken to investigate the effect of acute simvastatin treatment on hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP), a cellular model of learning and memory, in brain slices from C57BL/6 mice. Our results demonstrate that a prolonged in vitro simvastatin treatment for 2-4 h, but not a short-term 20-min exposure, significantly increases the magnitude of LTP at CA3-CA1 synapses without altering basal synaptic transmission or the paired-pulse facilitation ratio in hippocampal slices. Furthermore, we show that phosphorylation of Akt (protein kinase B) is increased significantly in the CA1 region following 2-hour treatment with simvastatin, and that inhibition of Akt phosphorylation suppresses the simvastatin-induced enhancement of LTP. These findings suggest activation of Akt as a molecular pathway for augmented hippocampal LTP by simvastatin treatment, and implicate enhancement of hippocampal LTP as a potential cellular mechanism underlying the beneficial effects of simvastatin on cognitive function.",

    "41": "Statins, as 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, have long been known for having significant effects on plasma lipid and lipoprotein profiles, lowering total and LDL cholesterol and raising HDL-C level. Many studies have previously found that statin therapy reduced the risk of occlusive vascular events in people with diabetes mellitus. In fact, type 2 diabetes is often accompanied by abnormal blood lipid and lipoprotein levels, but most studies on the link between hyperlipidemia and pathogenesis of diabetes have focused on free fatty acids (FFAs), which were believed to enhance hyperglycemia- induced beta cell deterioration and insulin secretion impairment, while the impact of cholesterol in the pathogenesis of diabetes has not been reported. Although the relationship between elevated cholesterol and diabetes has not been extensively examined, there is some evidence supporting a potential link between the two. Firstly, lipoprotein level is closely correlated with the concentration of plasma cholesterol, and the former is a good predictor for onset of diabetes. Secondly, a few clinical studies have indicated that use of statins can delay the progression of diabetes. Though the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is still elusive, it was recently found that elevated serum cholesterol can impair insulin secretion and increase the rate of apoptosis in beta cells, which may offer a promising clue to how statins work.",

Baseline characteristics between the two groups did not significantly differ at the time of ACS onset. Six months after PCI, all patients were treated with statins to achieve an LDL-C value of <100 mg/dL. We compared the first occurrence of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE). Prognostic data were fully documented during the entire follow-up period (mean, 1538+/-707 days). Cumulative event-free survival was significantly higher in the atorvastatin, than in the control group (p=0.041; log-rank test).

The frequency of LDL measurement also increased with longer hospital program participation; the adjusted OR was 1.17 per additional year of GWTG-Stroke participation (95% CI, 1.12 to 1.23; P<0.001). LDL measurement was lower in women, nonsmokers, those with atrial fibrillation, those with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack, and in those with transient ischemic attack (versus ischemic stroke; all P<0.001).

We sought to measure how atorvastatin (AT) treatment might modulate matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) expression and/or activity in human AAA. Tissue from human AAAs at surgical repair was obtained from patients who were either not on statins (NST, n = 19) or treated with AT (n = 19). Immunoblots measured expression and zymography measured activity. Expression of most proteins was greater in the central compared with distal AAA region. Matrix metalloproteinase 1, MMP2, MMP3, MMP9, Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase (TIMP2), TIMP3, TIMP4, or total Sma Mothers Against Decapentaplegia (SMAD2) expression did not differ with treatment. There was a trend toward reduced MMP8 and TIMP1 expression and MMP2 zymographic activity in the AT-treatment group. In contrast, AT-treated samples had significantly reduced MMP13 (P = .02), latent-transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta (P = .02), and phospho-SMAD2 (P = .029) expression than NST-treated samples. We conclude that the AT-mediated decrease in MMP expression and activity reduces TGF-beta signaling in the central region of human AAAs.",

    "58": "Endotoxemia plays an important role in the pathogenesis of sepsis and is accompanied by dysregulated apoptosis of immune and non-immune cells. Treatment with statins reduces mortality in rodent models of sepsis and endotoxemia. Inhibition of protein isoprenylation, including farnesylation, has been proposed as a mechanism to mediate the lipid-lowering-independent effects of statins. Nonetheless, the effects of the inhibition of isoprenylation have not yet been studied. To investigate the role of farnesylation, we evaluated the effects of farnesyltransferase inhibitor and statin on survival following lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge in mice. Both simvastatin (2mg/kg BW) and FTI-277 (20mg/kg BW) treatment improved survival by twofold after LPS injection, as compared with vehicle alone (p<0.01). LPS-induced cleavage (activation) of caspase-3, an indicator of apoptotic change, and increased protein expression of proapoptotic molecules, Bax and Bim, and activation of c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase (JNK/SAPK) in the liver and spleen were attenuated by both simvastatin and FTI-277. These results demonstrate that farnesyltransferase inhibitor as well as statin significantly reduced LPS-induced mortality in mice. Our findings also suggest that inhibition of protein farnesylation may contribute to the lipid-lowering-independent protective effects of statins in endotoxemia, and that protein farnesylation may play a role in LPS-induced stress response, including JNK/SAPK activation, and apoptotic change. Our data argue that farnesyltransferase may be a potential molecular target for treating patients with endotoxemia.",

However, these medications are associated with significant adverse effects that impact growth and development, quality of life (QOL), and sometimes long-term survival after transplantation. Adverse effects can differ between the immunosuppressants, but many result from the overall state of immunosuppression. Strategies to manage immunosuppressant adverse effects often involve minimizing exposure to the drugs while balancing the risk for rejection. Early recognition of immunosuppressant adverse effects may help to reduce morbidities associated with solid organ transplantation, improve QOL, and possibly increase overall patient survival.",

Neutrophil count at presentation, reported as counts x10(9)/L, was categorized by tertiles (lower tertile, <5.7; middle tertile, 5.7 to 8.5; upper tertile, >8.5). From 1979 to 2002, 2047 incident MIs occurred in Olmsted County, Minn (mean age, 68+/-14 years; 44% women). Median (25th to 75th percentile) neutrophil count was 7.0 (5.1 to 9.5). Within 3 years post-MI, 577 patients died, and 770 developed HF. Overall survival and survival free of HF decreased with increased neutrophil tertile (P<0.001).

Sensitivity analyses were also performed to address the potential impact that alternative statin regimens might have on a similar primary prevention population. For the end point of myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularization, or death, the 5-year NNT within JUPITER was 20 (95% CI, 14 to 34). All subgroups had 5-year NNT values for this end point below 50; as examples, 5-year NNT values were 17 for men and 31 for women, 21 for whites and 19 for nonwhites, 18 for those with body mass index <or=25 kg/m(2) and 21 for those with body mass index greater than 25 kg/m(2), 9 and 26 for those with and without a family history of coronary disease, 19 and 22 for those with and without metabolic syndrome, and 14 and 37 for those with estimated Framingham risks greater or less than 10%. For the net vascular benefit end point that additionally included venous thromboembolism, the 5-year NNT was 18 (95% CI, 13 to 29). For the restricted \"hard\" end point of myocardial infarction, stroke, or death, the 5-year NNT was 29 (95% CI, 19 to 56). In sensitivity analyses addressing the theoretical utility of alternative agents, 5-year NNT values of 38 and 57 were estimated for statin regimens that deliver 75% and 50% of the relative benefit observed in JUPITER, respectively. All of these calculations compare favorably to 5-year NNT values previously reported in primary prevention for the use of statins among hyperlipidemic men (5-year NNT, 40 to 70), for antihypertensive therapy (5-year NNT, 80 to 160), or for aspirin (5-year NNT, >300).",

At low doses, only 1 single nucleotide polymorphism met our experiment-wide significance level, ABCA1 rs12003906. Twenty-six subjects carried the minor allele of rs12003906, which was associated with an attenuated LDLc reduction (LDLc reduction in carriers versus noncarriers -24.1+/-2.6% versus -32.2+/-1.5%; P=0.0001). In addition, we replicated the association with the APOE epsilon3 allele and a reduced LDLc reduction. At high doses, carriers of the minor allele of ABCA1 rs12003906 and the APOE epsilon3 allele improved their LDLc reduction but continued to have a diminished LDLc reduction compared with noncarriers (-30.5+/-4.0% versus -42.0+/-2.4%; P=0.005) and (-38.5+/-1.9% versus -45.3+/-2.8%; P=0.009), respectively.",

The scope of the method included acidic, neutral and basic compounds belonging to different therapeutic classes and allows their simultaneous determination in just a single injection, giving realistic information of the most widely consumed pharmaceuticals in only one analysis. An enrichment step based on solid-phase extraction using Oasis HLB cartridges was carried out, followed by UHPLC-MS/MS measurement with a fast-acquisition triple quadrupole mass analyzer. It allowed working with short dwell times and made possible to acquire three simultaneous SRM transitions per compound to assure a reliable identification. Several isotope-labelled internal standards were used as surrogates to correct SPE losses, as well as matrix effects that notably affect quantification of analytes. The method was validated in surface water and effluent and influent urban wastewater at different concentrations from 0.005microg/L (surface water) to 1.25microg/L (influent wastewater). The optimized method was applied to the analysis of 84 urban wastewater samples (influent and effluent), with the result that 17 out of 20 compounds monitored were detected in the samples. Analgesics and anti-inflamatories, cholesterol lowering statin drugs and lipid regulators were the major groups found, with diclofenac, ketoprofen, naproxen, 4-aminoantipyrine, bezafibrate, gemfibrozil and venlafaxine being the most frequently detected. The highest concentration level reached was 277microg/L for salicylic acid in influent wastewater.",

We present a 58-year-old patient in whom the presence of a classic triad of precipitating event (coronary angiography), subacute presentation of renal failure and cutaneous lesions (livedo reticularis and Blue Toe syndrome) suggested this entity. The confirmatory diagnosis was made by means of renal biopsy which revealed cholesterol crystals lodged in arteries. In our patient severe renal insufficiency requiering hemodialysis ensued. Glucocorticoid and statin therapy failed to recover the renal function. The patient died from acute myocardial infarction. Invasive cardiac procedures are increasing in number especially in the elderly population so higher incidence of cholesterol crystal embolism coud be expected in the future.

In atherothrombotic and lacunar infarction, injury of endothelium and arterial vessels and platelet play a crucial role of formation of platelet-rich thrombus. Antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin, clopidogrel and cilostazole are effective for prevention of arterial thrombus and stroke recurrence, but other drugs such as statin for plaque stabilization and improvement of endothelial function could be used to reduce the recurrence of ischemic stroke.", 
    "110": "Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) risk factor assessment and management is no insignificant undertaking. In 2009, 785,000 Americans will experience their first coronary event, 470,000 will have a recurrent event, and an additional 195,000 will suffer a silent myocardial infarction (MI). As family physicians, we see many patients who have angina or MI, and we work aggressively with them to prevent myocardial ischemia and acute coronary syndromes. However, many of our otherwise healthy patients have subclinical atherosclerosis and are at increased risk for a first coronary event. Subclinical atherosclerosis is common, occurring in 39% of men and 36% of women aged > or =65 years in the Cardiovascular Health Study. The presence of subclinical cardiovascular disease roughly doubles the rate of development of clinically apparent disease over an 8-year period in healthy individuals, as well as in those with metabolic syndrome or diabetes mellitus. Unfortunately, for most patients, CHD is not diagnosed during routine screening. Rather, the diagnosis of CHD often is made only after symptoms occur, or when the patient is evaluated incidentally for another health problem.", 
    "111": "While Managing Acute-Care Issues, family physicians are challenged daily to recognize and treat modifiable risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD) and to educate patients on the importance of risk reduction. Time constraints and the imperatives of immediate issues make the challenge of identification and treatment of CHD risk difficult. A stunning number of family medicine patients present with 1 or more of the following CHD risk factors: low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) =130 mg/dL (33% of American adults), total cholesterol =200 mg/dL (45%), hypertension (33%), tobacco use (21%), sedentary lifestyle (69%), excessive body weight (body mass index =25; 67%), diabetes (8%), or pre-diabetes (26%). The objective of comprehensive therapeutic interventions in CHD, from diet and lifestyle changes, to smoking cessation, to medications, is to prevent new (primary prevention) or recurrent (secondary prevention) cardiovascular events, with the ultimate goal of preventing disability and death. Family physicians have the distinct advantage of seeing patients' health status from a global perspective, giving them a greater opportunity to recognize risk and initiate preventive interventions. Although therapeutic efforts have been directed traditionally at patients with established CHD and asymptomatic patients at high risk for cardiac events, new data are emerging that suggest that earlier, more aggressive treatment increases clinical benefit. This article (1) reviews the importance of reaching target goals for LDL-C and other biomarkers of risk in the primary and secondary prevention of CHD, and (2) addresses dosing issues and other practical methods of identifying and treating family medicine patients who are at risk.", 
    "112": "Statins and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) reduce cardiovascular disease incidence during hypertriglyceridemia (HTG). To elucidate possible cardioprotective mechanisms, we focused on gap junction protein connexin 43 (Cx43). Its expression is disturbed during atherogenesis, but little information is available on its expression during HTG. Experiments were performed on adult male hereditary HTG (hHTG) rats treated with n-3 PUFA (30 mg/day) and atorvastatin (0.5 mg/100 g body weight per day) for 2 months. Cx43 expression and distribution in the aorta were investigated by using Western blotting and immunolabeling, followed by quantitative analysis. Transmission electronmicroscopy was used to study ultrastructure of endothelial contact sites. In contrast to age-matched Wistar, Cx43 expression in aorta of hHTG rats was significantly higher (p < 0.05), and prominent Cx43 immunospots were seen in tunica media and less in endothelium of hHTG rats. Changes in Cx43 expression were accompanied by local qualitative subcellular alterations of interendothelial connections. Treatment of hHTG rats with n-3 PUFA and atorvastatin markedly lowered Cx43 expression in aorta and modified connexin distribution in endothelium and media (p < 0.05 vs. untreated hHTG). The protective effect of treatment of HTG was observed on the structural integrity of the endothelium and was readily visible at the molecular level. Results indicate the involvement of altered Cx43 expression in vascular pathophysiology during HTG and during HTG treatment.", 
    "113": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPAR), which are key transcriptional regulators of lipid metabolism and energy production, have been suggested to play an important role in myocardial ischaemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Their role in cardioprotection, however, is not yet fully elucidated. Statins have shown beneficial effects on I/R damage beyond lipid lowering, and some of their cardioprotective cholesterol-independent effects may be related to the regulation of PPAR. To clarify this issue, we explored a potential link between a response to I/R and changes in cardiac PPARalpha protein and gene expression in simvastatin-treated normocholesterolaemic rats. After 5 days of treatment with simvastatin (10 mg/kg per day, p.o.), Langendorff-perfused hearts were subjected to 30 min regional ischaemia (occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery) or global ischaemia and 2 h reperfusion for the evaluation of the infarct size (triphenyltetrazolium chloride and planimetry; as percentage of risk area), ischaemic arrhythmias, and postischaemic contractile recovery. Baseline PPARalpha mRNA and protein levels were increased by 3-fold and 2-fold, respectively, in simvastatin-treated hearts compared with the untreated controls. Simvastatin-treated hearts exhibited smaller size of infarction (11.5% +/- 0.4% vs. 33.7% +/- 4% in controls; p < 0.01), improved postischaemic contractile recovery, and lower severity of arrhythmias during ischaemia and early reperfusion. Enhanced resistance to I/R injury was associated with preservation of mRNA and protein levels of PPARalpha in contrast to their marked downregulation in controls. In conclusion, statin-induced changes in the expression of PPARalpha may contribute to attenuation of myocardial I/R injury and thus suggest the involvement of cardioprotective mechanisms independent of inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase.",

Therefore, Wistar rats were treated six times in 4 days with pravastatin or saline and allowed to survive for 6 hours or 5 days (n=10 per time point and group), respectively. Using quantitative receptor autoradiography, ligand binding densities of [(3)H]MK-801, [(3)H]AMPA, and [(3)H]muscimol for labeling of NMDA, AMPA, and GABA(A) receptors were analyzed in sensorimotor cortices Par1 and Par2, the striatum, and the hippocampus. Statin therapy induced complex alterations of ligand binding densities in different brain regions. Labeling of NMDA receptors was significantly increased in Par2, both after 6 hours and 5 days, respectively. Within the striatum, AMPA as well as GABA(A) receptor binding values were significantly increased on day 5. Furthermore, a marked and significant increase of [(3)H]muscimol ligand binding to GABA(A) receptors throughout all hippocampal subfields was seen after 6 hours. This complexity could easily be unraveled when focusing on the balance between excitatory glutamate and inhibitory GABA(A) receptors, in which case only the increase of hippocampal [(3)H]muscimol ligand binding 6 hours after the first application of pravastatin was accompanied by a net shift towards inhibition. Consequently, our data suggest an additional regulatory pathway induced by statins, namely modification of the abundance of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors.",

    "129": "In primary prevention, traditional risk factors are a useful first step in determining who is at cardiovascular risk, however, it has been noted that a considerable number of those at risk cannot be identified on the basis of traditional risk factors alone. Among blood biomarkers, C-reactive protein (CRP), measured by high-sensitivity assays (hsCRP), has received widespread interest and a large database has been accumulated on its potential role as a predictor of cardiovascular risk, although observed associations between circulating CRP and coronary heart disease (CHD) are unlikely to be causal, as recently indicated by various Mendelian randomization studies. In a meta-analysis of 22 prospective studies, the multivariable adjusted, combined odds ratio for CRP to predict CHD, comparing extreme tertiles, was 1.58 (95% confidence interval, 1.48-1.68). Several recent studies showed a significant contribution of CRP to coronary risk prediction independent of the Framingham Risk Score, with better discrimination, calibration and improved, albeit modest reclassification of subjects at risk. To test the hypothesis whether or not subjects with normal low-density lipoprotein cholesterol but elevated CRP represent a population at increased risk that might benefit from statin treatment, the JUPITER trial randomized 17,802 apparently healthy persons to either 20 mg rosuvastatin daily or placebo. Rosuvastatin significantly reduced the incidence of major cardiovascular events. The rates of the primary endpoint (composite of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, revascularization, and confirmed death from cardiovascular causes) were 0.77 and 1.36 per 100 person-years of follow-up in the rosuvastatin and placebo groups, respectively. Relative risk reduction was 44%. CRP may have more accurately selected high-risk subjects due to its association with very many risk factors, thus representing an integrative marker of the total inflammatory burden of an individual. JUPITER has revitalized the discussion on CRP in clinical practice and will make it more difficult in the future to neglect the evidence built around CRP and cardiovascular risk.",

Renal function was normal in 404 patients and impaired in 191. Patients on therapy (113 patients) were less likely to have ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI) compared with patients not treated (36% vs 53%, respectively, P=.0002). These results have been confirmed in the population of patients with CKD (48% of STEMI in patients receiving chronic therapy and 67% in patients without therapy,P=.01). Multivariate analysis in the group of patients with CKD showed that use of aspirin or statins was an independent predictor of a decreased probability of STEMI (odds ratio, 0.5; 95% confidence interval, 0.2-1.0,P=.05). The authors' results suggest that in a community-based sample of patients with acute MI, chronic aspirin and statin therapy has a cardioprotective role that is evident also in patients with CKD.",

Twenty-three patients, previously receiving aggressive statin therapy, were treated twice weekly with rosuvastatin or atorvastatin in different dosages along with ezetimibe as well as daily doses of bile acid sequestrant for a mean period of 4.5 months. The recommended National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III goals had already been achieved in 78% of patients (n=18) before starting combination pulse therapy. This combination therapy significantly increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol values by 5.82% (t=2.138, P=.044), while the increases in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, and apolipoprotein B levels compared with baseline were not statistically significant. Overall, 3 of 23 patients (13%) discontinued the combination therapy because of muscle-related symptoms over a mean course of 4.5 months of treatment.", 
    "155": "Airway inflammation, airway remodeling and airway hyperresponsiveness are the fundamental components of pathogenesis that lead to symptoms and lung function changes in asthma. Airway remodeling describes the structural changes to the airways in asthma. The remodeling process involves diverse pathological changes including epithelial metaplasia, subepithelial fibrosis, angiogenesis and smooth muscle thickening. Airway remodeling contributes to irreversible loss of lung function and airway hyperresponsiveness. Remodeling is associated with severe and persistent disease but can also occur early in the course of disease pathogenesis and does not resolve spontaneously. Current asthma therapies, for example corticosteroids, are successful in treating allergic inflammation, an important factor contributing to remodeling, but do not specifically target the remodeling process, and remodeling changes progress despite optimal control of inflammation. Moreover, airway remodeling is not eradicated or prevented despite widespread use of anti-inflammatory treatments. There is limited evidence for the effectiveness of leukotriene inhibitors, phosphodiesterase inhibitors, mast cell tryptase inhibitors, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonists in the treatment or prevention of remodeling changes. The search for novel therapies that can specifically reverse or prevent airway remodeling is an active area of research. Treatments that may be useful in preventing airway remodeling include those that directly or indirectly target single or multiple components of the airway remodeling process. Identification of novel asthma genes may also allow disease targeting. A better understanding of airway remodeling in asthma will facilitate the development of new treatments for asthma beyond control of symptoms and inflammation.", 
    "156": "Idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions are unpredictable and thought to have an underlying genetic etiology. With the completion of the human genome and HapMap projects, together with the rapid advances in genotyping technologies, we have unprecedented capabilities in identifying genetic predisposing factors for these relatively rare, but serious, reactions. The main roadblock to this is the lack of sufficient numbers of well-characterized samples from patients with such reactions. This is now beginning to be solved through the formation of international consortia, including developing novel ways of identifying and recruiting patients affected by these reactions, both prospectively and retrospectively. This has been led by the research on abacavir hypersensitivity - its association with HLA-B*5701 forms the gold standard of how we need to identify associations and implement them in clinical practice. Strong genetic predisposing factors have also been identified for hypersensitivity reactions such as are associated with carbamazepine, allopurinol, flucloxacillin, and statin-induced myopathy. However, for most other idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions, the genetic effect sizes have been low to moderate, although this may partly be due to the fact that only small numbers have been investigated and limited genotyping strategies have been utilized. It may also indicate that genetic predisposition will be dependent on multiple genes, with complex interactions with environmental factors. Irrespective of the strength of the genetic associations identified with individual idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions, it is important to undertake functional investigations to provide insights into the mechanism(s) of how the drug interacts with the gene variant to lead to a phenotype, which can take a multitude of clinical forms with variable severity. Such investigations will be essential in preventing the burden caused by idiosyncratic reactions, both in healthcare and in industry.",

Statins work by inhibiting HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase, thus stopping the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, which is found in the cholesterol synthesis cascade. Unfortunately, several studies have shown increased diagnosis and lack of glycemic control of diabetes mellitus when patients are taking high and/or long-term doses of statins, and several mechanisms have been identified that may help explain this side effect.",

Some studies have demonstrated that statins reduce proinflammatory signaling and have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. The inducible heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) catalyzes the stepwise degradation of heme to produce equimolar quantities of biliverdin, iron, and carbon monoxide; it has also been suggested to promote the important cholesterol-independent cytoprotective action of statins against oxidative insults. However, overexpression of HO-1 may have dual effects under oxidative stress, and the overaccumulation of ferric iron from heme may result in detrimental rather than cytoprotective effects. This study was designed to investigate the effect of a specific statin, simvastatin, and the role of HO-1 on the inflammatory status of the capsule surrounding a silicone shell implant in rats.",

Numerous CD68+monocytes or macrophages were diffusely distributed in the capsule in the early stage but not in the late stage postimplantation. In addition, the implantation procedure induced HO-1 expression, which was significantly up-regulated in the first 2 wk but decreased after 1 mo. Although daily feeding of the rats with simvastatin at 2 mg/kg induced HO-1 expression in the capsule throughout the experimental period, simvastatin treatment failed to reduce the production of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and COX-2, or limit NF-\u03baB activation in the early or late stages after implantation. Additionally, simvastatin treatment did not decrease the amount of CD68+cells distributed in the capsule at 1 wk postimplantation.

Atorvastatin, HMG-CoA inhibition has been showed to have protective effects on EPCs. Recent studies have demonstrated that reduced EPCs numbers and activity are associated with EPCs apoptosis. However, the protective mechanisms of atorvastatin on HHcy-induced EPCs apoptosis remain to be determined. This study was designed to examine the effect of atorvastatin on homocysteine-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and apoptosis in EPCs. EPCs were isolated from peripheral blood and characterized, then challenged with Hcy (50-500 micromol/L) in the presence or absence of atorvastatin (0.01-1 micromol/L) or various stress signaling inhibitors, including mevalonate (100 micromol/L), antioxidants N-acetyl cysteine (NAC, 10 micromol/L), the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase inhibitor diphenylene iodonium (DPI 10 micromol/L), the eNOS inhibitor N(G)mono-methyl-l-arginine LNMA (1mmol/L), and the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) inhibitor SB203580 (10 micromol/L). Apoptosis was evaluated by FACS analysis and cell viability was determined by MTT assay. ROS were detected by 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H(2)DCFH-DA). NADPH oxidases were evaluated with lucigenin-enhanced chemiluminescence. Expression of Nox4 mRNA and p-p38MAPK protein was measured by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis, respectively. Our data revealed that atorvastatin significantly suppressed Hcy-induced ROS accumulation and EPCs apoptosis. Atorvastatin also antagonized homocysteine-induced activation of NADPH oxidase and overexpression of Nox4 mRNA and p-p38MAPK protein. Similar effects occurred with EPCs transfected with Nox4 siRNA. These findings demonstrated that atorvastatin may inhibit Hcy-induced NADPH oxidase activation, ROS accumulation, and EPCs apoptosis through Nox4/p38MAPK dependent mechanisms, all of which may contribute to atorvastatin-induced beneficial effects on EPCs function.", 
    "167": "The mechanism of statin-induced skeletal muscle myopathy is poorly understood. We investigated how simvastatin affects cholesterol metabolism, ubiquinone levels, and the prenylation and N-linked glycosylation of proteins in C2C12 myotubes. We used liver HepG2 cells for comparison, as their responses to statins are well-characterized in terms of their cholesterol metabolism (in contrast to muscle cells), and statins are well-tolerated in the liver. Differences between the two cell lines could indicate the mechanism behind statin-induced myopathy. Simvastatin reduced de novo cholesterol production in C2C12 myotubes by 95% after 18h treatment. The reduction was 82% in the HepG2 cells. Total cholesterol pools, however, remained constant in both cell lines. Simvastatin treatment similarly did not affect total ubiquinone levels in the myotubes, unlike in HepG2 cells (22% reduction in CoQ10). Statin treatment reduced levels of Ras and Rap1 prenylation in both cell lines, whereas N-linked glycosylation was only affected in C2C12 myotubes (21% reduction in rate). From these observations, we conclude that total cholesterol and ubiquinone levels are unlikely to be involved in statin-mediated myopathy, but reductions in protein prenylation and especially N-linked glycosylation may play a role. This first comparison of the responses to simvastatin between liver and skeletal muscle cell lines may be important for future research directions concerning statin-induced myopathy.",

However, evidence indicates that subjects with both transient and persistent microalbuminuria have experienced renal damage during puberty and thus reno-protection to prevent long-term complications is warranted.

    "176": "This review summarizes the current evidence on beneficial effect of statins on the atherogenesis and the preventive potential of coenzyme Q 10 to avoid statin-induced myopathy. Statins, originally discovered in molds are the most effective medication to decrease the low-density cholesterol (LDL-C) which is the key participant in atherogenesis. Statins accomplish this by inhibiting the hydroxymethyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase, an enzyme that is rate limiting for cholesterol biosynthesis. Inhibition of HMG CoA reductase stimulates in the liver the LDL receptors. The result is an increased clearance of LDL particles from the bloodstream and by this mechanism statins have proved to be highly effective in reducing the cardiovascular risk, as amply documented in clinical studies confirming inhibition of atherosclerosis. Additional beneficial effect of statins occurs by modulation of endothelial functions and by diminishing vessel wall inflammation. Statins reduce the level of the C-reactive protein, a strong predictor of adverse cardiovascular events. Beneficial effects of statins on endothelial dysfunction and synthesis of nitric oxide NO were described. Different statin preparation might differ in their antioxidant effects (Fig. 2, Ref. 46).

Statin drugs act as inhibitors of the 3-hydroxy-3methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase enzyme early in the mevalonate pathway, thereby reducing the endogenous cholesterol synthesis.

We now report the results from a randomised controlled trial on effects of simvastatin on plasma 25OHD levels. Design and Methods. We randomised 82 healthy postmenopausal women to one year of treatment with either simvastatin 40 mg/d or placebo and performed measurement at baseline and after 26 and 52 weeks of treatment. The study was completed by 77 subjects. Results. Compared with placebo, plasma levels of cholesterol and low-density lipoproteins decreased in response to treatment with simvastatin, but our study showed no effect of simvastatin on vitamin D status. However, plasma levels of triglycerides were inversely associated with tertiles of plasma 25OHD levels and changes in plasma triglycerides levels correlated inversely with seasonal changes in vitamin D status. Conclusion. Our data do not support a pharmacological effect of statins on vitamin D status, but do suggest that vitamin D may influence plasma lipid profile and thus be of importance to cardiovascular health.",

Here, we studied their potential immunomodulatory role in renal inflammation using an autoimmune mouse model of anti-glomerular basement membrane glomerulonephritis. Oral treatment with Atorvastatin dramatically reduced albuminuria and histological changes in the kidneys as compared to vehicle-treated control animals. There was a significant decrease in the Th1 and Th17 response in the regional lymph nodes draining the kidneys. This systemic effect was accompanied by decreased infiltration of the kidneys with inflammatory CD4(+) T and Th17 cells, macrophages, and neutrophils in statin-treated mice. Regulatory T cells were not altered in their number, FoxP3 expression, or suppressive capacity, but their interleukin-10 production was significantly increased by statin treatment. Hence, Atorvastatin systemically and locally decreased the Th1 and Th17 response, thereby protecting the mice against anti-glomerular basement membrane glomerulonephritis.

Recent genome-wide screens have revealed that the sterol biosynthesis genes ERG25 and ERG4 affected the replication of Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) in a yeast model host. To further our understanding of the role of sterols in TBSV replication, we demonstrate that the downregulation of ERG25 or the inhibition of the activity of Erg25p with an inhibitor (6-amino-2-n-pentylthiobenzothiazole; APB) leads to a 3- to 5-fold reduction in TBSV replication in yeast. In addition, the sterol biosynthesis inhibitor lovastatin reduced TBSV replication by 4-fold, confirming the importance of sterols in viral replication. We also show reduced stability for the p92(pol) viral replication protein as well as a decrease in the in vitro activity of the tombusvirus replicase when isolated from APB-treated yeast. Moreover, APB treatment inhibits TBSV RNA accumulation in plant protoplasts and in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. The inhibitory effect of APB on TBSV replication can be complemented by exogenous stigmasterol, the main plant sterol, suggesting that sterols are required for TBSV replication. The silencing of SMO1 and SMO2 genes, which are orthologs of ERG25, in N. benthamiana reduced TBSV RNA accumulation but had a lesser inhibitory effect on the unrelated Tobacco mosaic virus, suggesting that various viruses show different levels of dependence on sterol biosynthesis for their replication.",

Twenty-week-old male ApoE-deficient mice received normal chow or 20 mg rosuvastatin/kg \u00d7 day for 32 weeks. Subsequently, matrix composition was analysed by histochemistry and immunostaining at the aortic root and in innominate arteries of ApoE deficient mice as well as in human carotid endarterectomy specimens. Immunoblotting of proteoglycans was performed from aortic extracts of ApoE-deficient mice. Immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting revealed strongly increased decorin and biglycan deposition in atherosclerotic plaques at the aortic root and in innominate arteries. In contrast, versican and perlecan expression was not changed by rosuvastatin. Furthermore, matrix metalloproteinase 2 and gelatinolytic activity were decreased in response to rosuvastatin and a condensed collagen-rich matrix was formed. In carotid endarterectomy specimens of statin-treated patients increased decorin and biglycan accumulation was detected as well.

For the purpose of this economic analysis, and based on their known differences, statins were categorised as high intensity if they produce greater LDL-cholesterol reductions than simvastatin 40 mg (e.g., simvastatin 80 mg and appropriate doses of atorvastatin and rosuvastatin or combination of statins + ezetimibe).", 
    "200": "A lifetime Markov model was developed to estimate the incremental cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) of treating a hypothetical cohort of 1000 FH patients aged between 20 and 70 years. Baseline coronary heart disease risks reported in the NICE TA 94 on statins, and age-adjusted risk of cardiovascular disease reported in the FH population, were used to populate the model. A meta-analysis estimate of the reduction in cardiovascular events from using high-intensity compared with low-intensity statins was obtained from published trials. Results were interpreted using a cost-effectiveness threshold of pound20 000/QALY.", 
    "201": "Fewer cardiovascular events and deaths were predicted to occur in the group treated with higher-intensity statins, and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was estimated at pound11 103/QALY. The ICER remained below the pound20 000 threshold for 20-39-year-olds and 40-59-year-olds, but rose above this threshold in individuals aged over 60 years. One-way sensitivity analysis showed that results were most sensitive to variation in treatment effect on mortality and the cost of high-intensity statins.", 
    "202": "Modelling demonstrates that high-intensity statins are cost-effective for the treatment of younger FH patients. If, as is likely, the relative price of high-intensity statins fall in the future as they come off patent, then their cost effectiveness will improve further.", 
    "203": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart rhythm disorder, with increasing prevalence in the aging US population and affecting more than 2.3 million people. Current approaches for managing AF are rate- or rhythm-control strategies, both using anti-thrombotic therapy to prevent thromboembolism. While great advances have been made in understanding the pathophysiology of AF, few new strategies have shown promise in prevention or treatment of AF. Recent data suggest that non-antiarrhythmic medication may be useful in modifying the substrate that allows AF precipitation and perpetuation. This article reviews the data on the role of these agents in the prevention and management of AF as an adjunct to standard therapy.", 
    "204": "During 2009, multiple major cardiology trials have been presented or published. In this paper, we summarize and place in clinical context the new trial findings regarding anticoagulation (dabigatran), antiplatelet therapy (ticagrelor, clopidogrel, prasugrel and aspirin), percutaneous coronary management (thrombectomy, multivessel/left main disease and biodegradable polymers), medical therapy for coronary disease (ivabradine and rosuvastatin) and management of heart failure (beta-blocker strategy, atrial fibrillation and resynchronization therapy).",

The model predicts treatment-specific probabilities of major and minor cardiovascular events and death, based on clinical trial data. The quality of life and costs were literature based. Measures included costs per life-year saved (LYS) and QALY gained. Health consequences and costs were discounted at 3.0% annually. Analyses were conducted from the payer perspective and valued in $US, year 2006-7 values.", 
    "208": "Literature-based mortality estimates (base case) increased life-years and QALYs for A80 compared with A10 (incremental cost-effectiveness ratios [ICERs]: $US9600 per LYS; $US13 600 per QALY). At a willingness to pay of $US100 000 per QALY, A80 was cost effective in 80% of simulations. A10 dominated A80 when using trial-based mortality estimates (alternative scenario). At a willingness to pay of $US100 000 per QALY, A80 was cost effective in 48% of simulations.", 
    "209": "Intensive A80 treatment may be cost effective versus A10 in cardiovascular prevention in CHF/CHD patients in the US, due to projected gains in life expectancy and health-related quality of life. However, the results are highly sensitive to assumptions about the mortality rate in the model. When using the mortality rate observed in the trial, A10 dominates A80.",

    "211": "All cases of suspected adverse reactions to statins reported to the Swedish Adverse Drug Reactions Advisory Committee until 15 September 2006 containing the codes myalgia, myopathy, increased serum creatine kinase (CK), myoglobinuria or rhabdomyolysis were included in the study. Cases were classified into different CK categories, where cases with CK levels >10 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) laboratory range were compared with cases with normal CK levels (in some analyses cases with CK not measured were also included as controls). Fisher's test and multiple logistic regression were used to test the degree of association.", 
    "212": "A total of 338 cases with muscle toxicity were identified. CK had not been measured in 148 cases. Of the remaining 190 cases, 59 were classified as rhabdomyolysis, 62 had CK increases below the level of rhabdomyolysis, 69 had normal CK and 2 contained insufficient information to classify the degree of CK increase. A high statin dose and concomitant interacting drug treatment were over-represented among cases with rhabdomyolysis compared with cases with normal CK. Renal disease and unusual strenuous muscular activity were also associated with an increased risk of rhabdomyolysis when the control group included cases with CK not measured.", 
    "213": "Results from our study support previous studies indicating that the risk of rhabdomyolysis with statin treatment increases with increase in systemic exposure to the statin.

The STEMI group was younger and had a higher percentage of men. The utilization rates of coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were highest in the STEMI group. Comparison to earlier ACS data (1997-1998) from the same hospital, showed an increase in the utilization of reperfusion therapy, coronary angioplasty, bypass surgery, aspirin, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzymes (ACE), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), and statins over the past decade (P < .05). This was associated with a significant decrease in hospital mortality (13%-7.7%, P < .01).",

    "218": "The main objective of this study was to compare clinical and laboratory data obtained from patients with primary antiphospholipid syndrome (PAPS) with and without Sneddon's syndrome (SS). A transverse study with 54 (85.2% female) PAPS patients (Sapporo criteria) was performed. Demographic, drug use, and antiphospholipid antibodies data were evaluated, as well as clinical and laboratory findings of SS. Patients were subdivided into one of two groups: PAPS with SS and PAPS without SS. Both groups were similar with respect to age (p\u00a0=\u00a00.05), gender (p\u00a0=\u00a00.34), race (p\u00a0=\u00a00.31), weight (p\u00a0=\u00a00.93), height (p\u00a0=\u00a00.27), and body mass index (p\u00a0=\u00a00.75); however, the SS group exhibited higher disease duration (96.0\u00a0\u00b1\u00a054.9 vs. 55.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a052.0\u00a0months, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). By definition, all PAPS with SS patients suffer from stroke, an arterial event; the frequency of stroke events (28.5 vs. 7.5%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.04), as well as of limb ischemia (100 vs. 30.0%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) was higher in this group than in the PAPS without SS group. On the other hand, patients in the PAPS without SS group had more venous events, such as deep venous thrombosis, than those in the PAPS with SS group (80.0 vs. 50.0%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03). In conclusion, an understanding of the relationship between APS and SS is important in order to identify a subgroup for which more rigorous accompaniment and therapy may be necessary.", 
    "219": "Lovastatin is an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and is metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 isoenzyme. Verapamil is a substrate of both P-gp and CYP3A4. It is therefore likely that lovastatin can alter the absorption and metabolism of verapamil.", 
    "220": "The pharmacokinetic parameters of verapamil and one of its metabolites, norverapamil, were compared in 14 healthy male Korean volunteers (age range 22-28 years) who had been administered verapamil (60 mg) orally in the presence or absence of oral lovastatin (20 mg). The design of the experiment was a standard 2 x 2 crossover model in random order.", 
    "221": "The pharmacokinetic parameters of verapamil were significantly altered by the co-administration of lovastatin compared to the control. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC (0-infinity)) and the peak plasma concentration of verapamil were significantly increased by 62.8 and 32.1%, respectively. Consequently, the relative bioavailability of verapamil was also significantly increased (by 76.5%). The (AUC (0-infinity)) of norverapamil and the terminal half-life of verapamil did not significantly changed with lovastatin coadministration. The metabolite-parent ratio was significantly reduced (29.2%) in the presence of lovastatin.",

    "223": "A limitation of stress myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is the inability to detect non-obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD). One advantage of MPI with a hybrid CT device is the ability to obtain same-setting measurement of the coronary artery calcium score (CACS).", 
    "224": "Utilizing our single-center nuclear database, we identified 760 consecutive patients with: (1) no CAD history; (2) a normal clinically indicated Rb-82 PET/CT stress perfusion study; and (3) a same-setting CAC scan. 487 of 760 patients (64.1%) had subclinical CAD based on an abnormal CACS. Of those with CAC, the CACS was > or =100, > or =400, and > or =1000 in 47.0%, 22.4%, and 8.4% of patients, respectively. Less than half of the patients with CAC were receiving aspirin or statin medications prior to PET/CT imaging. Patients with CAC were more likely to be initiated or optimized on proven medical therapy for CAD immediately following PET/CT MPI compared to those without CAC.", 
    "225": "Subclinical CAD is common in patients without known CAD and normal myocardial perfusion assessed by hybrid PET/CT imaging. Identification of CAC influences subsequent physician prescribing patterns such that those with CAC are more likely to be treated with proven medical therapy for the treatment of CAD.", 
    "226": "There is now evidence that major depression is accompanied by an induction of inflammatory and oxidative and nitrosative stress (IO&NS) pathways and by a lowered antioxidant status. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is a strong antioxidant that has anti-inflammatory effects.", 
    "227": "This paper examines the plasma concentrations of CoQ10 in 35 depressed patients and 22 normal volunteers and the relationships between plasma CoQ10 and treatment resistant depression (TRD), the severity of illness as measured by means of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the presence of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS).", 
    "228": "We found that plasma CoQ10 was significantly (p=0.0002) lower in depressed patients than in normal controls. 51.4% of the depressed patients had plasma CoQ10 values that were lower than the lowest plasma CoQ10 value detected in the controls. Plasma CoQ10 was significantly lower in patients with TRD and with CFS than in the other depressed patients. There were no significant correlations between plasma CoQ10 and the HDRS.", 
    "229": "The results show that lower CoQ10 plays a role in the pathophysiology of depression and in particular in TRD and CFS accompanying depression. It is suggested that depressed patients may benefit from CoQ10 supplementation. The findings that lower CoQ10 is a risk factor to coronary artery disease and chronic heart failure (CHF) and mortality due to CHF suggest that low CoQ10 is another factor explaining the risk to cardiovascular disorder in depression. Since statins significantly lower plasma CoQ10, depressed patients and in particular those with TRD and CFS represent populations at risk to statin treatment.", 
    "230": "Endothelial dysfunction has been linked to reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate reduced (NADPH) oxidase. Angiotensin II (ANG), which levels are elevated in some cardiovascular diseases, can stimulate this enzyme, whereas statins have been demonstrated pleiotropic effects related with the restoration of endothelial function. Therefore, our purpose was to study the mechanism of the possible beneficial effects of pravastatin on ANG-activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). ANG induced an increase in the extracellular superoxide anion produced by NADPH oxidase but had no effect in the intracellular ROS production. Pravastatin, which alone did not have any effect on ROS production, totally blocked the stimulating effects of ANG when combined with it. These effects were not due to a direct action of ANG or pravastatin on the activity of NADPH oxidase measured in HUVEC lisates. On the contrary, the results correlated well with other effects of ANG: a Nox4 and p22phox upregulated expression and an enhanced Nox4 translocation to the cell membrane. All these effects were inhibited by pravastatin, which had no effect when incubated alone. These data reveal for the first time that pravastatin interrupts the signaling pathway activated by ANG that leads to an enhanced NADPH oxidase activity at the cell membrane of HUVEC. For that, pravastatin inhibits ANG-induced upregulation of catalytic NADPH oxidase subunits and blocks the migration of them to the endothelial cell membrane."
