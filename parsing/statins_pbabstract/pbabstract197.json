Conditional on the true propensity score, treated and untreated subjects have similar distributions of observed baseline covariates. Propensity-score matching is a popular method of using the propensity score in the medical literature. Using this approach, matched sets of treated and untreated subjects with similar values of the propensity score are formed. Inferences about treatment effect made using propensity-score matching are valid only if, in the matched sample, treated and untreated subjects have similar distributions of measured baseline covariates. In this paper we discuss the following methods for assessing whether the propensity score model has been correctly specified: comparing means and prevalences of baseline characteristics using standardized differences; ratios comparing the variance of continuous covariates between treated and untreated subjects; comparison of higher order moments and interactions; five-number summaries; and graphical methods such as quantile-quantile plots, side-by-side boxplots, and non-parametric density plots for comparing the distribution of baseline covariates between treatment groups. We describe methods to determine the sampling distribution of the standardized difference when the true standardized difference is equal to zero, thereby allowing one to determine the range of standardized differences that are plausible with the propensity score model having been correctly specified. We highlight the limitations of some previously used methods for assessing the adequacy of the specification of the propensity-score model. In particular, methods based on comparing the distribution of the estimated propensity score between treated and untreated subjects are uninformative.",

This strategy reduces, but does not eliminate the risk for cardiovascular complications, and microvascular complications such as diabetic retinopathy and nephropathy still continue to develop or progress.

The clinical benefits of fenofibrate treatment were greater in patients with marked mixed dyslipidemia (elevated triglycerides >or=200 mg/dL and low plasma levels of HDL-C), features of the metabolic syndrome commonly observed in patients with type 2 diabetes, with a RRR of 27%, p = 0.005. These data are consistent with evidence from other fibrate trials showing increased treatment benefits in patients with metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes and mixed dyslipidemia. The FIELD study also provided promising data for microvascular benefits with fenofibrate, specifically on the need for laser treatment for diabetic retinopathy, progression of albuminuria, and prevention of diabetes-related lower-limb amputation.",

Subjects at high cardiovascular risk (high-risk subjects, HRS) and healthy controls (HC) were also enrolled. To this end, patients with PAD were studied 1 month before surgery, at the time of surgery, and 3 and 6 months after surgery. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes were obtained from venous blood and evaluated for AT1R expression at messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein level and IL-8 production (by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). At baseline, AT1R membrane expression was similar in cells from patients with PAD, HRS, and HC, whereas AT1R mRNA was similar in patients with PAD and HC and higher in HRS. During the follow-up period, AT1R expression progressively decreased both on the cell membrane and at the mRNA level. Both resting and stimulated production of IL-8 was lower in patients with PAD in comparison to HC and HRS and did not change during the follow up period. In PAD patients, femoral endarterectomy is associated with reduction of AT1R expression however with no apparent effect on IL-8 production. The relevance of such effects for cardiovascular protection deserves consideration.", 
    "6": "Sepsis has been reported to impair endothelium-dependent vasodilations mediated by nitric oxide (NO) and endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF). Although some studies demonstrate that statins can improve NO-mediated response in septic animals, little is known about its effect on the EDHF response. The present study examined the effects of atorvastatin pretreatment on sepsis-induced endothelial dysfunctions and hypotension in rats. Eighteen hours after the induction of sepsis by cecal ligation and puncture, thoracic aorta and second generation pulmonary arteries were isolated to examine acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent dilations mediated by NO and EDHF, respectively. The messenger RNA (mRNA) expression for endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) was done by real-time polymerase chain reaction. NO was measured as nitrate/nitrite release using Griess method. Mean arterial pressure was measured by the invasive method. Sepsis significantly decreased (26%) the relaxation response to acetylcholine in the rat aorta. It also markedly inhibited the eNOS mRNA expression and acetylcholine-stimulated NO release in this vessel. Pretreatment of the rats with atorvastatin (10 mg/kg, orally) 48, 24, and 2 hours before induction of sepsis preserved acetylcholine-induced relaxation, eNOS mRNA expression, acetylcholine-stimulated NO release, and attenuated increase in the inducible NO synthase mRNA expression and basal NO production in the aorta. The maximal EDHF response mediated by acetylcholine was 25.30% +/- 3.00% in the pulmonary artery. Sepsis abolished this response but atorvastatin restored it (22.55% +/- 2.50%). Atorvastatin, however, failed to prevent sepsis-induced hypotension. These results suggest that atorvastatin can restore impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilations mediated by NO and EDHF but not hypotension in sepsis.",

Treatment of juvenile TG mice with pitavastatin, an established inhibitor of the Rho family G proteins, or deletion of S1P3, a major myocardial S1P receptor subtype that couples to Rho GTPases and transactivates Smad signalling, both inhibited cardiac fibrosis with concomitant inhibition of SPHK1-dependent Smad-3 phosphorylation. In addition, the anti-oxidant N-2-mercaptopropyonylglycine, which reduces reactive oxygen species (ROS), also inhibited cardiac fibrosis. In in vivo ischaemia/reperfusion injury, the size of myocardial infarct was 30% decreased in SPHK1-TG mice compared with wild-type mice.",

Increased circulating progenitor cells (CPCs) and increased plasma markers of angiogenesis [vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the angiopoietins (Ang-1 and -2)] may be evidence of this damage. Treatment with hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors ('statins') improves outcomes in patients with vascular disease, including diabetic patients.

    "14": "Although treatment with statins significantly reduces adverse cardiovascular outcomes, several studies have shown that cardiovascular events continue to occur in two thirds of all patients. A logical pharmacologic approach to further reduce cardiovascular disease mortality should be focused on direct modifiers of atherosclerosis or lipid-modifying agents with different mechanism of action than existing drugs against dyslipidemia. Squalene synthase inhibitors can decrease circulating low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol by an increased expression of hepatic LDL receptors in a similar manner to statins. Also, depending on their structure, they may possess antiatherosclerotic properties independent of their lipid-modifying effects. This review, following a brief introduction to different classes of squalene synthase inhibitors and representative molecules, presents the accumulating in vitro and in vivo experimental evidence relevant to squalene synthase inhibitors EP2306 and EP2302 and discusses their properties. EP2306 and EP2302 show a similar inhibitory effect in the progression of atherosclerosis in the cholesterol-fed rabbit. Moreover, EP2306 showed a significant long-term antiatherosclerotic effect not shared by simvastatin or their combination in this animal model. EP2302 also showed a favorable effect in the regression of pre-established atherosclerotic lesions. It is reasonable to hypothesize that EP2302, due to its NO-releasing and enhancing properties, could have additional advantages compared to EP2306. Treatment with EP2300 compounds did not adversely affect liver transaminases or cause toxicity on various organs of the cholesterol-fed rabbit. The satisfactory safety profile of EP2300 compounds in this animal model is a promising finding in view of future clinical studies.", 
    "15": "Atherosclerosis is a complex inflammatory process characterized by the cross-talk between excessive inflammation and lipid accumulation. In the past few years, compelling evidence suggests that statins can decrease vascular inflammation and attenuate the development of atherosclerosis through their so-called \"pleiotropic effects\". These cholesterol-independent effects are predominantly due to their ability to inhibit isoprenoid synthesis. In particular, inhibition of geranylgeranylpyrophosphate synthesis leads to inhibition of Rho and its downstream target, Rho-kinase (ROCK). Thus, one of the beneficial effects of statin therapy could be due to inhibitory effects on ROCK. ROCK is involved in mediating diverse cellular functions such as smooth muscle contraction, cell migration and proliferation. While increased ROCK activity is associated with endothelial dysfunction, cerebral ischemia, coronary vasospasms and metabolic syndrome, the inhibition of ROCK by statins or selective ROCK inhibitors leads to up-regulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), decreased vascular inflammation, and reduced atherosclerotic plaque formation. This review will focus on the impact of ROCK in cardiovascular disease and its contributory role to vascular inflammation and the atherosclerosis.",

Monascus secondary polyketide metabolites, including monacolin K (MK) and ankaflavin (AK), have been reported to have antitumor-initiating effects on cancer progression. This paper reports that the oral administration of RMRE dramatically inhibited the metastatic ability of murine Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC) cells in syngeneic C57BL/6 mice caused by the decline of serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels compared with untreated metastatic groups. MK is a key antimetastatic and antiangiogenesis compound in RMRE, as shown by down-regulation of VEGF-stimulated invasive activity in LLC cells by Matrigel-coating transwell and tube-forming assays and reverse transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Therefore, application of RMRE may serve as a nontoxic natural chemopreventive or antineoplastic agent in the development of cancer adjuvant chemotherapy.",

Furthermore, there is a difference between dietary cholesterol and serum cholesterol. Dietary cholesterol, which is found in animal-based foods, raises blood cholesterol in only approximately one-third of people.

We addressed the question whether a general phenotype of extravasated monocytes exists and whether this phenotype differs between healthy individuals and statin treated patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). In vivo extravasated monocytes from CAD patients and healthy controls were collected by use of the skin blister method and compared with peripheral circulating monocytes by flow cytometry. The number of CD14(+)CD16(+) monocytes were significantly higher in the skin blister compared with peripheral circulation in both patients (P < 0.001) and controls (P = 0.005). In vivo extravasated monocytes had in comparison with peripheral monocytes a lower expression of CX(3)CR1, a higher expression of HLA-DR, CD86 and CD36 and a higher binding of acetylated low density lipoprotein (acLDL) (significant for all markers). Skin blister fluid from CAD patients, compared with healthy controls, induced a 20% increase in monocyte CD36 expression (P = 0.008) following 18 h of in vitro incubation. The results indicate that the integrated response to the in vivo extravasation process is similar in statin treated stable CAD patients and healthy controls, with respect to phenotypic alterations.

    "35": "Much of the morbidity and mortality of sickle cell anemia is accounted for by a chronic vasculopathy syndrome. There is currently no identified therapy, interventional or prophylactic, for this problem. For two reasons, development of an effective therapeutic approach will require a systems biology level perspective on the vascular pathobiology of sickle disease. In the first place, multiple biological processes contribute to the pathogenesis of vasculopathy: red cell sickling, inflammation and adhesion biology, coagulation activation, stasis, deficient bioavailability and excessive consumption of NO, excessive oxidation, and reperfusion injury physiology. The probable hierarchy of involvement of these disparate sub-biologies places inflammation caused by reperfusion injury physiology as the likely, proximate, linking pathophysiological factor. In the second place, most of these sub-biologies overlap with each other and, in any case, have multiple points of potential interaction and transactivation. Consequently, an approach modeled upon chemotherapy for cancer is needed. This would be a truly multi-modality approach that hopefully could be achieved via employment of relatively few drugs. It is proposed here that the specific combination of a statin with suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid would provide a suitable, broad, multi-modality approach to chemo-prophylaxis for sickle vasculopathy.",

In the present study, we investigated the potential role of senescent vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in the formation of senescence-associated medial calcification. Replicative senescence was induced by the extended passages (until passages 11-13) in human primary VSMCs, and cells in early passage (passage 6) were used as control young cells. VSMC calcification was markedly enhanced in the senescent cells compared with that in the control young cells. We identified that genes highly expressed in osteoblasts, such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and type I collagen, were significantly upregulated in the senescent VSMCs, suggesting their osteoblastic transition during the senescence. Knockdown of either ALP or type I collagen significantly reduced the calcification in the senescent VSMCs. Of note, runt-related transcription factor-2 (RUNX-2), a core transcriptional factor that initiates the osteoblastic differentiation, was also upregulated in the senescent VSMCs. Knockdown of RUNX-2 significantly reduced the ALP expression and calcification in the senescent VSMCs, suggesting that RUNX-2 is involved in the senescence-mediated osteoblastic transition. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry of aorta from the klotho(-/-) aging mouse model demonstrated in vivo emergence of osteoblast-like cells expressing RUNX-2 exclusively in the calcified media. We also found that statin and Rho-kinase inhibitor effectively reduced the VSMC calcification by inhibiting P(i)-induced apoptosis and potentially enhancing matrix Gla protein expression in the senescent VSMCs. These findings strongly suggest an important role of senescent VSMCs in the pathophysiology of senescence-associated medial calcification, and the inhibition of osteoblastic transition could be a new therapeutic approach for the prevention of senescence-associated medial calcification.",

Blood was collected at 0, 6 and 9 weeks, to determine plasma lipid levels, plasma PAF-AH activity, platelet aggregation (PAF-EC(50)), resistance of plasma to oxidation (RPO) and extent of atheromatous lesions in aortas. The atherogenic diet induced dyslipidemia and increased PAF-AH activity. Dyslipidemia and PAF-activity reduced more effectively in groups C and D. RPO decreased in group B only. PAF-EC(50) values decreased in group C only. Atherogenesis progression in group C was prevented to an extent indistinguishable from that in group D.

We searched the literature (PubMed/Medline) to determine the clinical significance and assess the management of renal dysfunction in these patients. The results of our literature search suggest that impaired renal function is a frequent finding in patients with PAD. The presence of concomitant renal dysfunction in these patients is associated with higher morbidity and mortality rates, as well as the occurrence of cardiovascular events (stroke, myocardial infarction, and vascular death). Additionally, impaired renal function negatively affects survival, limb salvage, and graft patency rates when these patients undergo lower extremity revascularization procedures. The use of statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors is associated with improved renal function and reduced cardiovascular risk in patients with PAD. Based on current evidence, renal function should be assessed and regularly monitored in all patients with PAD. More importantly, initiation of appropriate treatment (e.g., statins and ACE inhibitors) should be implemented to preserve renal function and improve vascular morbidity and mortality in these patients.",

The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes Study was terminated early because of a significant excess all-cause mortality in the intensively-treated group. Furthermore the ADVANCE and VADT trials did not demonstrate cardiovascular benefit with more intensive glycaemic control. Against this background, it is pertinent to re-visit and critically appraise the results of the PROactive study which examined the effects of the thiazolidinedione, pioglitazone, on cardiovascular end-points in a large, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial in type 2 diabetic patients with symptomatic disease. PROactive has been rightly criticized in the choice of its composite primary end-point which included a physician-driven as opposed to a disease-driven outcome, namely peripheral vascular re-vascularization. This was primarily responsible for the primary composite end-point not being achieved; whereas there was a significant beneficial impact on the major secondary end-point of death, non-fatal myocardial infarction and stroke. The results of PROactive have been supported by two subsequent studies examining the impact of pioglitazone on important surrogates of atherosclerosis, namely carotid intima/medial thickness (IMT) and coronary atheroma volume as delineated with intravascular ultrasound. The CHICAGO study demonstrated that IMT in type 2 diabetic patients treated with pioglitazone did not progress whereas those treated with glimepiride showed progression. In PERISCOPE atheroma volume progressed with glimepiride but did not with pioglitazone. This is exciting data pointing to the cardiovascular benefits of pioglitazone. In PROactive, CHICAGO and PERISCOPE there was a sustained effect of pioglitazone on glycaemic control and, in addition, beneficial effects in reducing triglycerides and increasing HDL-cholesterol beyond that seen with concomitant statin therapy. These findings strongly suggest that pioglitazone has an important place in the management of type 2 diabetes.", 
    "66": "This review presents new insights into the regulation of the isoprenoid pathway in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in particular the short-term transcriptional response to two inhibitors, lovastatin and zaragozic acid (ZA). Whereas lovastatin blocks whole isoprenoid pathway, ZA only blocks the sterol branch. Consequently, their effects on the cellular level of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) are different. Lovastatin decreases the FPP level, whereas ZA, by inhibiting the main FPP-consuming enzyme, increases FPP availability in the cell. We discuss the role of genes whose expression is affected by both inhibitors and consider possible association of these genes with the regulation of the isoprenoid pathway.",

    "72": "Apolipoprotein (apo) B may be a more sensitive measure of atherogenicity than low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and a better index for assessing cardiovascular risk. The refined risk assessment provided by apo B may be important in patients at high cardiometabolic risk such as those with diabetes mellitus or metabolic syndrome, as these conditions are often associated with normal LDL-C values but increased numbers of small, dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles (indicating increased levels of apo B). Although apo B is not currently a treatment target in the United States cholesterol-lowering guidelines, a consensus conference endorsed by the American Diabetes Association and the American College of Cardiology recently recommended that apo B be added as a therapeutic target in patients at high cardiometabolic risk and in patients with clinical cardiovascular disease or diabetes. Suggested target goals are < 90 for high risk and < 80 mg/dL for highest risk patients. Current clinical data indicate that intensive statin therapy can lower apo B to meet this aggressive goal. While the proatherogenic/antiatherogenic ratio of apo B/apo A-I is a better risk discriminator than the single proatherogenic measurement (apo B), clinical trial data are lacking regarding the impact of increasing apo A-I and high-density lipoprotein on outcomes.",

Forty-four subjects undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were randomized to treatment with simvastatin (20 mg/day, group A, N. 22) or control (group B, N. 22) before surgery. Plasma levels of interleukins (IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha), and systemic inflammatory response score (SIRS) were measured during the surgical intervention and over the following 48 postoperative hours.

    "77": "Abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) have a prevalence between 1.3-8.9% in men and 1.0-2.2% in women aged above 55 years. Furthermore, AAA cause 1-3% of all deaths among men aged 65-85 years in developed countries. As the disorder is invariably associated with severe atherosclerotic damage of the arterial wall, it has traditionally been regarded as a direct consequence of generalized atherosclerotic disease. In patients with occlusive aortic disease, dyslipidemia is a well established risk factor. However, in patients with aneursymatic aortic disease, the association between dyslipidemia and the development of AAA is less clear. Large clinical trials in patients with cardiac and peripheral arterial disease have shown the strong relation between dyslipidemia, statin therapy and the risk of cardiovascular disease. Importantly, the effects of statin therapy were still present irrespective of the decrease in serum cholesterol levels. These findings resulted in the discussion of potential non-lipid lowering effects of statin therapy. These ''pleiotropic effects'' compose a diversity of cellular events which have an effect on several components of the arterial wall, including: 1) endothelial cells; 2) smooth muscle cells; 3) platelets; 4) monocytes/macrophages; and 5) the process of inflammation. In the general population the role of dyslipidemia as an independent risk factor for AAA is debated. However, as patients with AAA frequently have concomitant arterial disease, statin therapy is often recommended. As a result, the non-lipid lowering effects of statins on aneurysm expansion rate are hardly studied, and most evidence comes from experimental and animal studies. In the current review article we provide an overview of all available literature on the effects of dyslipidemia, statin therapy and the risk of AAA expansion and rupture. In the first part we summarize all population-based studies that investigated the relation between hypercholesterolemia and the development of AAA. In the second part, the available literature regarding the effects of statins on aneurysm growth, expansion rate and the risk of rupture is summarized, including in vitro, animal and clinical human studies.",

Increasing numbers of young female patients with familial hypercholesterolemia raise the issue of pregnancy and its consequences for the familial hypercholesterolemia patient herself but also for her offspring. When pregnancy is considered, lipid-lowering drugs are often discontinued because of the fear for teratogenic effects. The evidence for teratogenesis associated with statin use is scant and conflicting. On the other hand, several studies do suggest that pronounced hypercholesterolemia during pregnancy has adverse effects on both fetus and mother. In fact, human and animal studies reveal an enhanced tendency toward atherosclerosis in the offspring of women who suffer from hypercholesterolemia during pregnancy. In animal studies, some evidence exists that this can be reversed by treatment with lipid-lowering and antioxidative agents. Until today, however, no human studies exist that have evaluated efficacy or safety of lipid-lowering interventions in pregnant women with familial hypercholesterolemia.",

    "85": "The widely used cholesterol-lowering drugs, statins, were reported to reduce the incidence of stroke and the progression of Alzheimer's disease. However, little is known on how statins exert these beneficial effects. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective actions of statins in primary cultured cortical neurons. We found that chronic treatment of neurons with a low dosage of two CNS-permeable statins (lovastatin and simvastatin) selectively reduced NMDA-induced cell death but not the caspase-mediated apoptosis. The protective effects of stains were inhibited by mevalonate, a PI3K inhibitor, and tyrphostin AG538, suggesting roles for cholesterol and insulin/IGF-1 signaling in the neurotoxic response. We further demonstrate that statins block calcium-dependent calpain activation, resulting in complete suppression of protein truncation events on multiple calpain substrates that are involved in neuronal death including CDK5 coactivator p35 cleavage to p25, GSK3 and beta-catenin. This is followed by reduced and increased nuclear translocation of p25 and beta-catenin, respectively. Under excitotoxic conditions, the activities of CDK5 and beta-catenin are exclusively regulated by calpain-mediated cleavage while apoptosis modulates beta-catenin mainly through phosphorylation. Strikingly, our data demonstrate that the calpain-blocking effect of statins is largely mediated by stimulation of alpha-secretase cleavage of APP, resulting in increased secretion of its soluble form, sAPP. Finally, our data suggest that statin-regulated sAPP secretion occurs via activation of the PI3K pathway and inhibition of ROCK signaling. Altogether, our study provides novel insights into statin-mediated neuronal excitoprotection through both cholesterol-dependent and -independent mechanisms and links them to calpain-mediated neuronal death.",

    "90": "In addition to lowering cholesterol, statins may alter endothelial release of the vasodilator NO and harmful superoxide free radicals. Statins also reduce cholesterol intermediates including isoprenoids. These are important for post-translational modification of substances including the GTPases Rho and Rac. By altering the membrane association of these molecules, statins affect intracellular positioning and hence activity of a multitude of substances. These include eNOS(endothelial NO synthase), which produces NO (inhibited by Rho), and NADPH oxidase, which produces superoxide (dependent on Rac). Statins may improve endothelial function by enhancing production of NO while decreasing superoxide production. A total of 40 hypercholesterolaemic patients were randomized to treatment with either atorvastatin or placebo; 20 normolipidaemic patients were also studied. Platelet nitrite, NO and superoxide were examined as was the cellular distribution of the GTPases Rho and Rac at baseline and after 8 weeks of treatment.Following atorvastatin therapy, platelet NO was increased (3.2 pmol/10(8) platelets) and superoxide output was attenuated [-3.4 pmol min(-1) (10(8) platelets)(-1)] when compared with placebo. The detection of both Rho and Rac was significantly reduced in the membranes of platelets, implying reduced activity. In conclusion, the results of the present study show altered NO/superoxide production following statin therapy. A potential mechanism for this is the change in the distribution of intracellular GTPases, which was considered to be secondary to decreases in isoprenoid intermediates, suggesting that the activity of the former had been affected by atorvastatin.",

Because a large fraction of the population is exposed, even a small excess of risk with respect to cancer should be considered. We carried out a record-linkage study in Finland utilizing nationwide databases of reimbursed statin medication and cancer. The study population included all statin users in Finland who had purchased at least 1 prescription between 1996 and 2005 and who had no cancer diagnosis at the date of first purchase. A control population without statin usage was also included. Data consisted of 472,481 pairs of individuals that cumulated 4.2 million person years with an average of 8.8 years of follow-up. Fifty thousand two hundred ninety-four cancer cases were observed. Simvastatin and atorvastatin were the most used substances. The most frequent cancers were prostate, breast, lung, colon, and rectum cancer. In general, no association between the utilization of statins and cancer could be detected.

    "101": "The development of multidrug resistance (MDR) is a major problem during cancer treatment. Drug efflux via ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters is the main mechanism responsible for resistance to chemotherapeutics. We have recently observed that statins enhance susceptibility to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis in human rhabdomyosarcoma cells, which is now also observed in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. We have therefore investigated the ABC transporter activity to confirm a possible inhibition by statins in SH-SY5Y cells. Indeed, simvastatin directly inhibited dye transport at equimolar concentrations of the ABC transporter inhibitor, verapamil. Making use of the fluorescence behavior of doxorubicin the accumulation of anthracycline was monitored in real-time confocal microscopy. The intracellular doxorubicin accumulation was immediately enhanced by statins in SH-SY5Y cells and also in a MYCN-amplified neuroblastoma cell line STA-NB-10. The heavily glycosylated P-glycoprotein (ABCB1, P-gp) transporter appeared as a 180-and 140-kDa species. Atorvastatin and simvastatin reduced the 180-kDa form of P-gp, but not verapamil. Thereby the fully glycosylated species is shifted to the core glycosylated species (140 kDa), which was only seen at statin exposure times longer than 24 hr. The functional importance of glycosylation of the transporter was highlighted by exogenous application of N-glycosidase F, which was sufficient to enhance doxorubicin accumulation. Hence, these novel findings of statins' dual impact on P-gp have clinical implications. The enhanced intracellular accumulation of chemotherapeutics or other ABC transporter substrates in the presence of statins may represent a novel concept to overcome MDR in cancer therapy and improve drug safety.",

Furthermore, the hearing loss and hair cell damage may be caused and exacerbated by hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis. We are therefore seeking an effective treatment to protect the inner ear in ApoE-KO mice. ApoE-KO mice fed with an atherosclerotic diet were treated with simvastatin or with Strauss Heartdrops. The auditory brainstem responses were recorded, and plasma lipid levels and inner ear histology were examined. ApoE-KO and wild-type C57BL/6J mice fed with a normal chow diet served as controls. Compared to ApoE-KO mice fed only the atherosclerotic diet, ApoE-KO mice treated with simvastatin had no significant hearing loss and less severe atherosclerosis and hair cell damage in the inner ear. However, ApoE-KO mice treated with Strauss Heartdrops developed significant hearing loss and severe atherosclerosis and hair cell damage in the inner ear. These results demonstrate that statins may prevent hearing loss and inner ear damage in ApoE-KO mice by reducing the atherosclerotic lesions and levels of glucose, cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and triglyceride. Statins could be used to treat hearing loss associated with hyperlipidemia.",

The objective of this study was to compare nutritional supplements (pectin, polyphenols, and phytosterols) to lovastatin to reduce serum cholesterol. Familial hypercholesterolemic (FH) swine received the same amount of basal diet (control) in addition to pectin (30 g/day), polyphenols (20 g/day), phytosterols (6 g/day), and all possible combinations in contrast to lovastatin (3 mg/kg of body weight). The experimental design consisted of 4 weeks of basal diet followed by 4 weeks of basal diet plus the supplement treatment. All of the supplements, except pectin, reduced total cholesterol by an average of 71 +/- 19 mg/dL in comparison to the control diet (53 +/- 20 mg/dL) and lovastatin (143 +/- 21 mg/dL) during the 5-8-week treatment period. Serum high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol remained unchanged, while serum triglycerides changed independent of diet. During the 5-8-week treatment period serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol was reduced maximally 22%, 19%, 20%, 17%, 18%, and 17% by polyphenols, phytosterols, pectin + polyphenols, pectin + phytosterols, polyphenols + phytosterols, and pectin + polyphenols + phytosterols, respectively, compared to control (8%) and lovastatin (40%). Phytosterols was the most effective supplementation, while both phytosterol and polyphenol supplements enhanced the reduction in LDL-cholesterol of pectin-containing diets. Supplements effectively reduced cholesterol in FH swine by half compared to lovastatin. Results suggest that more research on the use of dietary supplements, alone or in combination with statins, to reduce LDL-cholesterol is justified.",

To evaluate the associations between the 1-year changes in HDL cholesterol and LDL cholesterol with lovastatin and subsequent acute major coronary events (AMCEs), we studied 2,928 patients in the lovastatin arm who were followed for 5.2 years in a post-hoc analysis of the Air Force/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention Study (AFCAPS/TexCAPS). The percentage of HDL cholesterol increase and apolipoproteins at year 1 and the incidence of AMCEs thereafter were assessed stratified by the LDL cholesterol levels. With lovastatin, LDL cholesterol was reduced by 25% on average to 115 mg/dl at year 1, and HDL cholesterol increased 6.0%. Patients with both an increase in HDL cholesterol of > or =7.5% and LDL cholesterol of <115 mg/dl at year 1 had the lowest event rate (3.53/1,000 person-years; p = 0.028). Similar results were found for an increase in HDL cholesterol of > or =7.5% and a decrease in LDL cholesterol of >25%, as well as for apolipoproteins A-I and B. The 1-year percent increase in HDL cholesterol appeared to be associated with a reduction in AMCEs in subsequent follow-up (p = 0.07 with the percentage of HDL cholesterol increase analyzed continuously). Patients with an HDL cholesterol increase of > or =7.5% had an AMCE rate of 5.18 compared with 7.66/1,000 person-years in patients with a lower HDL cholesterol increase (p = 0.08). In conclusion, lovastatin therapy was associated with a greater risk reduction of AMCEs when LDL cholesterol was substantially reduced and the HDL cholesterol increased by > or =7.5%.", 
    "118": "Lowering of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is a fundamental step in the comprehensive management of patients at high risk for cardiovascular events. The combination of a statin with ezetimibe usually provides additional LDL cholesterol lowering compared to statin monotherapy. This open-label observational study evaluated the impact of a 26-week treatment program with uptitration of statin dosages and incorporation of ezetimibe 10 mg therapy in 2,577 men and women (median age 64 years) with hypercholesterolemia and an LDL cholesterol level >2.5 mmol/L (97 mg/dl). Attainment of an LDL cholesterol target of 2.5 mmol/L (97 mg/dl) increased with consecutive visits (63%, 67%, and 71% at the second, third, and final visits, respectively). Current guideline-recommended LDL cholesterol value <2.0 mmol/L (77 mg/dl) was achieved by 36%, 40%, and 41% of the group at the same consecutive follow-up sessions. Median LDL cholesterol decreased from 3.0 mmol/L (116 mg/dl) at baseline to 2.1 mmol/L (81 mg/dl) at the end of the 26-week monitoring period. Favorable changes were concomitantly observed for median total cholesterol (5.1 to 4.1 mmol/L [197 to 159 mg/dl]), total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (4.2 to 3.3), and triglyceride (1.6 to 1.4 mmol/L [142 to 124 mg/dl]). Of those who attended visit 4, 48% exhibited LDL cholesterol lowering of > or =1 mmol/L (39 mg/dl) compared to baseline levels.

    "119": "No data exist on the acute effects of statin therapy on human coronary atherosclerotic plaques. The objective of our study was to evaluate the early (<2 months) effects of newly initiated statin therapy on coronary atherosclerosis as evaluated by intravascular ultrasonography. The study population consisted of 74 patients (mean age 58 +/- 8 years) who had been included in the ERASE trial (evaluating the effects of reconstituted high-density lipoprotein infusions). All patients underwent serial intravascular ultrasonographic (IVUS) evaluation at baseline (3 +/- 2 days after an acute coronary syndrome [ACS]) and after 6 +/- 1 weeks of follow-up. Statin therapy was initiated after ACS in 36 patients who received < or =1 dose of statins before baseline IVUS examination (newly initiated statin therapy group), and 38 patients were already on a stable statin dose before the ACS (long-term statin therapy group). Atorvastatin at a dose of 40 mg/day was the most common regimen in the 2 groups. Percent changes in atheroma volume (prespecified primary efficacy parameter) were -4.71 +/- 0.96% in the newly initiated statin therapy group (p <0.0001) and -0.54 +/- 0.89% in the long-term statin therapy group (p = 0.546; p = 0.002 for comparison between groups). Median nominal changes in atheroma volume were -9.10 mm(3) (interquartile range -12.56 to -3.73, p <0.0001 vs baseline) and 1.21 mm(3) (interquartile range -6.41 to 3.76, p = 0.429 vs baseline) in the newly initiated and long-term statin therapy groups, respectively (p = 0.003 for comparison between groups). Greater decreases in total cholesterol (r = 0.25, p = 0.035), ratio of total to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (r = 0.28, p = 0.018), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (r = 0.31, p = 0.046, for patients with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein measurements within 7 days after IVUS examination) were associated with larger percent changes in atheroma volume. In conclusion, newly initiated statin therapy is associated with rapid regression of coronary atherosclerosis within 2 months. This effect was in part associated with decreases in atherogenic lipid and inflammatory parameters. These results provide insight into the rapid clinical benefits of statin therapy after an ACS.",

Atorvastatin, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, is thought to have pleiotropic effects in various neurologic diseases. Moreover, there are several lines of evidences that atorvastatin inhibits NF-kappaB activation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Thus, this study aims to explore whether atorvastatin attenuates NF-kappaB activation in trigeminal nucleus caudalis in a nitroglycerin-induced migraine model. A significant increase in nuclear content of p65, an indicator of NF-kappaB activation, was detected in trigeminal nucleus caudalis in rats following injection with nitroglycerin. However, the nitroglycerin-induced NF-kappaB activation in trigeminal nucleus caudalis was attenuated by pretreatment with atorvastatin in a dose-dependent fashion. These results suggest that atorvastatin may be a novel and promising candidate for future treatment or prophylaxis of migraine via attenuating activation of NF-kappaB in trigeminal nucleus caudalis.", 
    "125": "Phytosterols and omega-3 fatty acids are natural compounds with potential cardiovascular benefits. Phytosterols inhibit cholesterol absorption, thereby reducing total- and LDL cholesterol. A number of clinical trials have established that the consumption of 1.5-2.0 g/day of phytosterols can result in a 10-15% reduction in LDL cholesterol in as short as a 3-week period in hyperlipidemic populations. Added benefits of phytosterol consumption have been demonstrated in people who are already on lipid-lowering medications (statin drugs). On the other hand, omega-3 fatty acid supplementation has been associated with significant hypotriglyceridemic effects with concurrent modifications of other risk factors associated with cardiovascular disease, including platelet function and pro-inflammatory mediators. Recent studies have provided evidence that the combination of phytosterols and omega-3 fatty acids may reduce cardiovascular risk in a complementary and synergistic way. This article reviews the health benefits of phytosterols and omega-3 fatty acids, alone or in combination with statins, for the treatment/management of hyperlipidemia, with particular emphasis on the mechanisms involved.", 
    "126": "Dyslipidemia, often present in patients with metabolic syndrome and chronic kidney disease, contributes to increased cardiovascular risk and progression of renal impairment. In these patients, the probability of death from cardiovascular complications is higher than death consequent to terminal renal failure. Positive neuroprotective effects ofstatins and fibrates are being attributed to hypolipidemic as well as other, lipid-unrelated, properties. Statins are able to slow down the decline in glomerular filtration rate and may decrease proteinuria. Nevertheless, conclusive evidence that statins decrease the incidence of cardiovascular complications in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease is still lacking. Through their effect on albuminuria, fibrates contribute to slowing down ofthe progression of diabetic nephropathy. Controlled trials and clinical practice have shown that monotherapy with statins as well as fibrates is safe. Management of combined dyslipidemia requires, apart from the selection of a suitable statin-fibrate combination, careful monitoring of potential adverse effects and treatment tolerability and compliance. The results of the Czecho-Slovakian pivot study KOLCHRI have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of fenofibrate combined with low dose statin in patients with metabolic syndrome and stage 2-4 chronic kidney disease.", 
    "127": "Hyperglycaemia is a typical feature of metabolic syndrome (MeTS) and one of its independent diagnostic criteria. The term includes impaired glucose homeostasis (impaired fasting glucose and impaired glucose tolerance) and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Although glycaemic control has been shown to lower the risk of microvascular events, the effect of intensive glycaemic control on macrovascular outcomes is less clear. Epidemiological studies show hyperglycaemia, particularly the postprandial one, to be a clear risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) mortality and morbidity. However, the intervention studies are less conclusive. The large interventional studies published in 2008 and 2009 (UKPDS, VADT, ACCORD, ADVANCE, RECORD) advocate the controlling of nonglycemic risk factors (through blood pressure control, lipid lowering with statin therapy, aspirin therapy, and lifestyle modifications) as the primary strategies for reducing the burden of CV disease in people with diabetes, and demonstrated the need for individualized approach to the patients' care in terms of blood glucose control. The patients with shorter duration of type 2 diabetes and without established atherosclerosis might reap CV benefit from intensive glycemic control. Conversely, it is possible that potential risks of intensive glycaemic control (hypoglycaemia) may outweigh its benefits in other patients, such as those with a very long duration ofdiabetes, known history of severe hypoglycemia, advanced atherosclerosis, and advanced age/frailty. According to the latest recommendations of the Czech Diabetes Society that are in line with the European and US standards the best way to protect type 2 diabetic patients against coronary and cerebrovascular disease is to target all cardiovascular risk factors (blood pressure treatment, including lipid-lowering with statins, aspirin prophylaxis, smoking cessation, and healthy lifestyle behaviors hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity and other symptoms of metabolic syndrome. The target HbA1c levels in patients with the low CV risk shoul be below 4.5%. Less strict goals (HbA1c below 6%) may be appropriate for patients with a history of severe hypoglycemia, limited life expectancy, advanced microvascular or macrovascular complications, or extensive comorbid conditions or those with long-standing diabetes. The individual targets should be achieved safely (without hypoglycaemias). Slow advancing in diabetes compensation is preferred. Lifestyle changes are the cornerstone of therapy. Metformin is the drug of choice; its administration, together with lifestyle changes, should be initiated immediately after the diagnoses of diabetes. If monotherapy does not provide satisfactory glucose control, other oral antidiabetic agents or insulin are added to the combination. Since it is not known which hypoglycaemic agents are beneficial from the perspective of long-term patient prognosis, the selection is liberal. Contraindication of the various farmaceuticals must be respected. It is possible to use a range of different combinations, metformin is administered with a glitazone (zero risk of hypoglycaemias is the advantage) with sulphonylurea derivatives (low price is the advantage) with glinides, with incretins, acarbose, antiobesity agents or insulin. The next step is a triple combination of hypoglycaemic agents with different mechanisms of action. Therapy also includes education focusing on changes to dietary and lifestyle habits, including smoking cessation, and education related to the prevention of complications, with particular regard to prevention of diabetic foot and atherosclerosis.", 
    "128": "Dementia is one of the most important health problems in the aging populations. The most frequent cause of it is Alzheimer's disease (AD) which is characterized by intracellular neuro-fibrillary tangles (NFT) and the extracellular senile plaques. The NFTs are mainly formed by the hyperphosphorylated microtubule-binding protein, the tau, while the senile plaques are composed of beta-amyloid protein cleaved from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the beta- and gamma-secretases. The pharmacotherapy of AD consists of symptomatic and disease-modifying therapies. The most frequently used therapeutic agents are the nootropic drugs supported by personal rather evidence based experiences. The leading-edge therapy of AD at present is the inhibition of the acetylcholine-esterase enzyme (AChEI) with mainly cognitive symptomatic and weak disease-modifying effects; they are licensed in the mild and middle stages of AD (MMSE 26-10), but their effect is proved in the severe stage of the disease and they are effective in the management of the neuropsychiatric symptoms too. Memantine (which is an inhibitor of the N-metil-D-aspartate receptor) is used in the middle and severe stages of AD and it can be effectively combined with AChEIs. The future therapy of AD will possibly be a \"causative\" therapy. The most frequent directions are therapies aiming to decrease the production or the deposition of beta-amyloid peptide. The active vaccination study of AN-1792 was terminated because of immunological side-effects, but several active and passive immunisation therapies are in development nowadays. It is also possible to inhibit the aggregation of the beta-amyloid peptide with peptide fragments or with Cu2+ and Zn2+ ion chelators. A promising direction is the inhibition of the enzymes responsible for the production of the beta-amyloid peptide: beta-secretase inhibitors with low molecular weight and penetrability through the blood-brain barrier are developed while the inhibitors of the gamma-secretase (some of them are the derivatives of the non-steroid anti-inflammatory drug ibuprofen) are tested in phase III trials. The inhibition of NFT formation might be promising too and inhibitors of the enzymes responsible for the hyperphosphorylation of the tau (like the glycogen synthase kinase-3) are in develo ment. Several other therapeutic methods are studied. NSAIDs and statins are useful in the prevention of the disease but they are failed in symptomatic treatment. There are promising studies in few patients using nerve growth factor therapy and some studies proved that peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR) agonist rosiglitazone (which is used to the treat diabetes mellitus) is effective in AD. The presently modest therapeutic interventions of AD will explode in the near future and together with the improved diagnostics of the disease they will cause further specialization with increased treatment and caring costs amplified by the ever growing number of the patients. This means that AD is and will be one of the most important diseases for the health care systems.",

    "147": "Thirty-five outpatients with hypercholesterolemia (61.5+/-12.8 yr) were administered 2 mg oral pitavastatin daily for 6 months. Plasma pentraxin 3 (PTX3), a novel inflammatory marker of atherosclerosis, was measured together with the serum hsCRP and carotid-artery intima-media thickness (IMT).", 
    "148": "Significant improvement of the LDL-C/HDL-C and log (TG/HDL-C) ratios began to be observed from 1 month after using pitavastatin. Significant correlation of the initial PTX3 value was observed with the initial plaque score (PS) (p=0.038, r=0.246), but not between the hsCRP and plasma PTX3 or PS. When patients were divided into 3 groups based on the initial PTX3 values, a significant decrease of the plasma PTX3 was obtained in the highest PTX3 group alone (p=0.034). The change in the plasma PTX3 value (DeltaPTX3) was significantly correlated with the Delta mean IMT during the study period (p=0.008, r=0.456).",

    "150": "Rheumatic Heart Disease (RHD) is well known to be an active inflammatory process which develops progressive calcification and leaflet thickening over time. The potential for statin therapy in slowing the progression of valvular heart disease is still controversial. Retrospective studies have shown that medical therapy is beneficial for patients with calcific aortic stenosis and recently for rheumatic valve disease. However, the prospective randomized clinical trials have been negative to date. This article discusses the epidemiologic risk factors, basic science, retrospective and prospective studies in valvular heart disease and a future clinical trial to target RHD with statin therapy to slow the progression of this disease. Recent epidemiological studies have revealed the risk factors associated with valvular disease include male gender, smoking, hypertension and elevated serum cholesterol and are similar to the risk factors for vascular atherosclerosis. An increasing number of models of experimental hypercholesterolemia demonstrate features of atherosclerosis in the aortic valve (AV), which are similar to the early stages of vascular atherosclerotic lesions. Calcification, the end stage process of the disease, must be understood as a prognostic indicator in the modification of this cellular process before it is too late. This is important in calcific aortic stenosis as well as in rheumatic valve disease. There are a growing number of studies that describe similar pathophysiologic molecular markers in the development of rheumatic valve disease as in calcific aortic stenosis. In summary, these findings suggest that medical therapies may have a potential role in patients in the early stages of this disease process to slow the progression of RHD affecting the valves. This review will summarize the potential for statin therapy for this patient population.", 
    "151": "Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a life-threatening disease affecting almost 10% of the population over age 65. Generation of AAAs by infusion of angiotensin (Ang) II in apolipoprotein E-knockout (ApoE(-/-)) mice is an animal model which supports an imbalance of the renin-angiotensin system in the pathogenesis of AAA. The effect of statins on AngII-mediated AAA formation and the associated neovascularization is not known. Here we determined the effect of simvastatin and the ERK inhibitor, CI1040, on AngII-stimulated AAA formation.", 
    "152": "ApoE(-/-) mice infused for 28 days with AngII using osmotic minipumps were treated with placebo, 10 mg/kg/d simvastatin, or 100 mg/kg/d CI1040. 95% of AngII-treated mice developed AAA with neovascularization of the lesion, increased ERK phosphorylation, MCP-1 secretion, and MMP activity. These effects were markedly reversed by simvastatin and in part by CI1040. Furthermore, simvastatin and the ERK inhibitor U0126 reversed AngII-stimulated angiogenesis and MMP secretion by human umbilical vein endothelial cells.",

Most of the reported cases have been attributed to drug-drug interactions with calcineurin inhibitors, with the majority of interactions reported between cyclosporine and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins). Pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that cyclosporine increases statin drug levels, presumably via competitive inhibition of cytochrome P450 3A4.",

One hundred and thirty-nine patients (51.5%) suffered from unstable angina at inclusion and 131 patients (48.5%) presented with an acute myocardial infarction (MI). The follow-up data were obtained from questionnaires.

    "162": "Feedback inhibition existed in lovastatin biosynthesis from Aspergillus terreus. Exogenous lovastatin and other different polyketide antibiotics biosynthesized by polyketide synthase were supplemented to the cultures of A. terreus to investigate their influences on lovastatin production. Supplementing exogenous lovastatin of 100 mg l(-1) at the early stage of fermentation and the fast stage of its biosynthesis resulted in decreases of 76.4% and 20% in final lovastatin production, respectively. However, the fungal cell growth was not affected; the growing cycle was only prolonged in the submerged cultivation. Separate supplementation of the five kinds of polyketide antibiotics such as tylosin, erythromycin, tetracycline, daunorobin, and rifamycin to the cultures resulted in increases of about 20 approximately 25% in the final lovastatin production. Especially, supplementing tylosin of 50 mg l(-1) at the beginning of lovastatin biosynthesis led to the final lovastatin production of 952.7 +/- 24.3 mg l(-1), which was improved by 42% and 22% compared with that produced in the control and the original culture, respectively. These results are helpful to understand the regulations on lovastatin biosynthesis and improve the final desired metabolite contents in many antibiotics production.", 
    "163": "The purpose of this study is to determine the biologic impact of short-term lipophilic statin exposure on in situ and invasive breast cancer through paired tissue, blood and imaging-based biomarkers. A perioperative window trial of fluvastatin was conducted in women with a diagnosis of DCIS or stage 1 breast cancer. Patients were randomized to high dose (80 mg/day) or low dose (20 mg/day) fluvastatin for 3-6 weeks before surgery. Tissue (diagnostic core biopsy/final surgical specimen), blood, and magnetic resonance images were obtained before/after treatment. The primary endpoint was Ki-67 (proliferation) reduction. Secondary endpoints were change in cleaved caspase-3 (CC3, apoptosis), MRI tumor volume, and serum C-reactive protein (CRP, inflammation). Planned subgroup analyses compared disease grade, statin dose, and estrogen receptor status. Forty of 45 patients who enrolled completed the protocol; 29 had paired Ki-67 primary endpoint data. Proliferation of high grade tumors decreased by a median of 7.2% (P = 0.008), which was statistically greater than the 0.3% decrease for low grade tumors. Paired data for CC3 showed tumor apoptosis increased in 38%, remained stable in 41%, and decreased in 21% of subjects. More high grade tumors had an increase in apoptosis (60 vs. 13%; P = 0.015). Serum CRP did not change, but cholesterol levels were significantly lower post statin exposure (P < 0.001). Fluvastatin showed measurable biologic changes by reducing tumor proliferation and increasing apoptotic activity in high-grade, stage 0/1 breast cancer. Effects were only evident in high grade tumors. These results support further evaluation of statins as chemoprevention for ER-negative high grade breast cancers.",

Angiotensin II (Ang II) type 1 receptor (AT1R) and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) via its lectin-like ox-LDL receptor (LOX-1) are major stimuli for cardiomyocyte growth. We postulated that rosuvastatin, a potent HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, may reduce Ang II-mediated cardiomyocyte growth via AT1R and LOX-1 inhibition. HL-1 adult mouse cardiomyocytes were incubated overnight in serum-free medium, and then treated with rosuvastatin, the AT1R inhibitor losartan or anti-LOX-1 antibody for 3 hours. The cells were then stimulated with Ang II. We measured cardiomyocyte growth, and associated intracellular redox signals using reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time quantitative PCR. Losartan and anti-LOX-1 antibody markedly attenuated Ang II-mediated oxidant stress, and the expression of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (p40(phox) and gp91(phox) subunits) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB). Rosuvastatin attenuated the Ang II-mediated upregulation of both subunits of NAPDH oxidase as well as NF-kappaB. Rosuvastatin also reduced Ang II-mediated upregulation of AT1R and LOX-1. In other experiments, LOX-1 was upregulated in cardiomyocytes by transfection with pCI-neo/LOX-1, which also enhanced the expression AT1R messenger RNA (mRNA), and rosuvastatin pretreatment reduced the expression of both LOX-1 and AT1R in this system. Thus, rosuvastatin attenuates Ang II-mediated cardiomyocyte growth by inhibiting LOX-1 and AT1R expression and suppressing the heightened intracellular redox state.",

Simvastatin is known to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. This study investigated the effect of simvastatin administration in a warm intestinal I/R model on TNF-alpha, antioxidant enzymes and intestinal tissue morphology. Thirty-six male wistar rats underwent laparotomy under general anaesthesia. Simvastatin was administered from four days before ischaemia induction. The rats were divided in to three groups (n = 12): the sham group, the I/R group, and the I/R + simvastatin group. Intestinal ischaemia was induced by superior mesenteric artery ligation with microvascular clamps for 60 minutes, and after ischaemia, blood perfusion was released into the tissue and a reperfusion phase was started, which lasted for 3 hours. After 3 hours, the animals were sacrificed and serum and tissue obtained for biochemical and histological study. In the simvastatin treated group, intestinal tissue injury, TNF-alpha level, and tissue malondealdehyde levels were significantly lower than in the I/R group (p < 0.05). Glutathion peroxidase and superoxide dismutase levels were significantly higher in the simvastatin treated group than in the I/R group (p < 0.05). Simvastatin pretreatment reduced intestinal I/R injury and was associated with down- -regulation of serum TNF-alpha and tissue malondealdehyde level, and simvastatin administration maintained cellular antioxidant enzyme contents compared to the I/R group after 3 hours reperfusion time."
