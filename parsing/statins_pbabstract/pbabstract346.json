The mechanism behind this has not been established. The aim of the present investigation was to study the effect of ACTH on the plasma lipoprotein pattern in patients treated with a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor.", 
    "1": "The ACTH treatment was given to 10 patients who were on long-term treatment with simvastatin 40 mg daily. ACTHI-24 was administered at the dose of 1 mg daily for four consecutive days. Blood samples for analyses of lipids, lipoproteins and apolipoproteins were collected before and after treatment. Second baseline was obtained 2 weeks after the end of treatment.", 
    "2": "The serum concentrations of cholesterol, triglycerides, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, apolipoprotein B and lipoprotein(a) fell significantly by 16, 23, 23, 10 and 38%, respectively. The serum apolipoprotein E concentration increased significantly by 39%; the fraction that was not associated with apolipoprotein B increased by 47% whereas the fraction that was did not change significantly. There were no changes in the serum concentrations of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and apolipoprotein AI. At the second baseline, the lipid variables had generally returned to previous levels.", 
    "3": "In patients on long-term simvastatin treatment, ACTH had marked lowering effects on the lipoproteins that contain apolipoprotein B. Moreover, the serum apolipoprotein E concentration increased significantly in response to ACTH treatment.", 
    "4": "The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, pravastatin, was compared with simvastatin and lovastatin from the viewpoint of susceptibility to interaction with or via the multidrug transporter, MDR1 (P-glycoprotein). This was carried out using the MDR1-overexpressing cell line LLC-GA5-COL150, established by transfection of MDR1 cDNA into porcine kidney epithelial LLC-PK1 cells, and [3H]digoxin, which is a well-documented substrate for MDR1. Pravastatin, at 25-100 microM, had no effect on the transcellular transport of [3H]digoxin whereas simvastatin and lovastatin suppressed the basal-to-apical transport of [3H]digoxin and increased the apical-to-basal transport. It was suggested that recognition by MDR1 was due to the hydrophobicity. In conclusion, simvastatin and lovastatin are susceptible to interaction with or via MDR1, but pravastatin is not. This is important information when selecting the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors for patients taking drugs that are MDR1 substrates.", 
    "5": "In the field of cardiovascular pharmacology the year 2001 has been marked by the demonstration of the clinical significance of new anti-thrombotics and by the interesting results with anti-endothelins. Whereas the failure of oral antiGPIIb-IIIa has been confirmed, melagatran (an anti-thrombin administered orally) and pentasaccharide (a new subcutaneous anti-Xa) have proved their efficacy in the prevention of venous thromboembolic disease compared to low molecular weight heparins, with an acceptable incidence of unwanted effects. Anti-endothelins under development have variable mechanisms of action from one drug to another. Their efficacy in cardiac insufficiency, pulmonary artery hypertension and arterial hypertension is suggested by clinical studies investigating small population; a more important study in decompensated cardiac insufficiency has not however shown a reduction of the morbidity and mortality with one of these drugs. The clinical significance of angiotensin II receptor antagonists has been confirmed for the indications which they share with ACE inhibitors (cardiac insufficiency, prevention of diabetic nephropathy). However, there are not enough comparative trials for these indications between these two classes in order to draw conclusions about the equivalence or superiority of one or the other. Of help elsewhere has been a re-interpretation of the mode of action of arterial wall drugs, and the inflammatory theory of atherosclerosis, putting the accent for example on the reduction of C reactive protein with a statin, or on the anti-inflammatory effect of aspirin. However, one study has not shown any benefit in giving a short course of corticosteroids in unstable angina. A very prominent event in the year 2001 remains the withdrawal of cerivstatin due to fatal rhabdomyolysis. The consequences go far beyond this drug, as its withdrawal justifies a fresh examination of the risk-benefit ratio for all the statins, with the probable corollary of a halt in the escalation of prescriptions. In this context, the new ezetimibe-type cholesterol absorption inhibitors could be a future solution.", 
    "6": "Epidemiological studies demonstrate that hypercholesterolemia is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). As the generation and accumulation of the beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) in the brain appears to be significant for the initiation and progression of AD, it is possible that cholesterol levels regulate Abeta formation and/or clearance. To test the effects of altering cholesterol on Abeta formation, we incubated cells with or without lovastatin acid, the active metabolite of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin, and measured the fraction of Abeta formed from its precursor under each condition. We observed that treatment with lovastatin acid led to a profound decrease in the levels of Abeta formed. This effect was observed at concentrations of 0.05-5 microM, ranges where this compound is effective at inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase. To examine the effects of lovastatin on Abeta in vivo, human subjects who had elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were treated during a double-blind, randomized study with 10-60-mg once-daily doses of a controlled-release formulation of lovastatin, or matching placebo. Serum Abeta concentrations were measured before and after up to 3 months of treatment. Mean and median changes from baseline in serum Abeta concentrations showed a significant (p < 0.0348), dose-dependent decrease. Differences between the 40- and 60-mg dose groups and placebo were statistically significant (Dunnett's p< 0.05). Our results suggest a mechanism by which hypercholesterolemia may increase risk for AD and indicate that lovastatin reduces Abeta formation and may thereby be effective in delaying the onset and/or slowing the progression of AD.", 
    "7": "Lipid-lowering agents have been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) in all patients. However, these agents are more cost-effective in high-risk patients whose absolute risk of CAD is greater than that of low-risk patients. Furthermore, from preliminary data, it appears that there is greater risk reduction in those subjects achieving lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels (ie, lower is better). The identification and aggressive treatment of these patients should therefore be a high priority for clinicians. Guidelines from medical organizations, such as the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III of the US National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP), emphasize that patients with CAD, diabetes, or global risk of CAD >20% over 10 years and LDL-C levels >130 mg/dL should receive drug therapy with a goal of reducing LDL-C levels to <100 mg/dL. The recent results of the United Kingdom's Heart Protection Study (HPS) strongly suggest that even those with CAD or who are at high risk and LDL-C levels >100 mg/dL would benefit from drug therapy. Although optimal LDL-C levels have been set at <100 mg/dL for high-risk patients, recent studies show only about 20% of such patients meet these goals. Thus, a large treatment gap remains that needs to be overcome if we are to continue to make significant inroads into preventing further morbidity and mortality in these high-risk subjects. Of therapeutic options available currently and for the near future, statins remain the most effective and well-tolerated form of lipid-lowering therapy. Other therapies include bile acid sequestrants, niacin, and plant stanols. However, none of these is, in general, sufficiently effective as an initial agent to achieve these more aggressive LDL-C goals in the high-risk patient. However, combination therapy with a statin and 1 of these other lipid-lowering agents is useful in patients who are unable to achieve lipid goals on monotherapy. A number of agents for reducing LDL-C levels currently in development may be available in the near future, including 2 new statins: pitavastatin and rosuvastatin. Rosuvastatin, which is in the later stages of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval process, has been shown to produce significantly greater reductions in LDL-C levels compared with atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin, and allows more patients to meet lipid goals. Ezetimibe, the first of an entirely new class of LDL-C-lowering agents that inhibit intestinal cholesterol absorption, also appears to offer significant therapeutic value. It is anticipated that these new options will allow clinicians to optimize the management of dyslipidemia in high-risk patients, thereby further reducing the morbidity and mortality of CAD.", 
    "8": "Noninvasive imaging techniques offer a unique opportunity to study the relation of surrogate markers to the development of atherosclerosis. These noninvasive imaging modalities include: (1) carotid artery, coronary, and aorta imaging; (2) left ventricular echocardiography imaging; (3) electron-beam computed tomography; (4) magnetic resonance imaging; and (5) ankle-brachial index. Because the incidence of coronary artery disease is a function of the development and progression of atherosclerosis, the use of noninvasive surrogate markers of atherosclerosis can aid in the diagnosis of cardiovascular disease through the identification of subclinical disease. Noninvasive imaging techniques provide an approach for identifying high-risk individuals who may benefit from active intervention to prevent clinical disease.", 
    "9": "The aims of the present study were to (i) determine the presence and concentration of albumin fractions (alpha1, alpha2, beta, gamma), immunoglobulins (IgA, IgG, IgM) and cytokines [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)] in periovulatory ovarian follicular fluid (FF) of in vitro fertilization (IVF) patients, (ii) examine the relationship between these parameters and the etiology of infertility as well as the IVF outcome and (iii) find out if these parameters in FF could be used as a predictive factor of IVF outcome.",

Whereas, the HMG was used for the second set of patients (n=81) - after down regulation with gondotropin-releasing hormone agonists (Gn-RHa) - the protein fractions were determined using electrophoresis separation. Immunoglobulins were measured using a commercial kits and the concentration of cytokines was determined by the highly sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) methods.", 
    "12": "The stimulation regimens used have no effect on albumin (alpha1, alpha2, beta, gamma) and immunoglobulin (IgA, IgG, IgM) concentrations, as no significant difference was observed between the two groups. Besides, no specific relationship was found between the concentration of these investigated parameter in FF and etiology of infertility or fertilization, cleavage and pregnancy rate. Besides, there were no significant differences between the groups for any cytokine investigated. Moreover, there were no correlations between the concentration of IL-6, IL-8 and GM-CSF in FF and steroid hormone concentration in the blood at the day of oocytes retrieval or IVF outcome.", 
    "13": "Total protein, albumin fraction, immunoglobulins and cytokines level in FF of patients undergoing COH for IVF therapy for various etiology of infertility could not be a useful parameter for predicting IVF outcome.", 
    "14": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) increases the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with cardiovascular disease as well as in patients without any previous history of ischaemic heart disease (IHD). The management of IHD in diabetic patients remains a difficult challenge. However, some of these treatments are not as effective or well-tolerated in diabetic patients as in non-diabetic patients. An important effect of diabetes, that in turn influences cardiac function, is the switch from carbohydrate oxidation to free fatty acid and ketone oxidation. The correction of the alterations to cardiac metabolism associated with DM may represent a new approach to the management of IHD in these patients. Results obtained in anginal patients with the metabolic agent trimetazidine and in infarcted patients with glucose-insulin-potassium (GIK) are consistent with this hypothesis.", 
    "15": "The recent \"Lipobay affair\" prompted us to review the biomedical literature focusing on statins, in a prevention and rehabilitation perspective, and to prepare a pertinent evidence-based report. A number of randomized controlled clinical trials have assessed the efficacy and the safety of statins in cardiovascular prevention; these drugs have proved to be effective (number needed to treat values between 20 and 40) and safe (number needed to harm value for myopathy even when in association with fibrates around 833, as deduced from literature data). Fatal rhabdomyolysis is virtually not detectable in current scientific literature when statin therapy is administered in an appropriate fashion and when the patient undergoes periodical check-ups. In the individual patient, the benefits and risks related to his treatment have to be precisely tailored, evaluating his individual risk profile, the strength of the indication to statin therapy, the concomitant presence of other treatments and/or habits and the potential and actual adverse events foreseeable (to an extent) if established risk factors which predispose to myopathy are taken into consideration. The hematological lipids management strategy including a correct diet, physical exercise and statin therapy represents a key component of every evidence-based rehabilitation program too. Cardiovascular prevention and rehabilitation are major priorities at an individual as well as at a public health level. Both these strategies are based on a careful management of known risk factors, among them hypercholesterolemia, that today can be effectively and safely treated with statins.",

This recessive disorder, characterised by severe hypercholesterolaemia, xanthomatosis, and premature coronary artery disease, is rare except on the island of Sardinia, Italy. Our aim was to ascertain why ARH is more common on Sardinia than elsewhere.", 
    "23": "We obtained detailed medical histories, did physical examinations, measured concentrations of lipoproteins, and harvested genomic DNA from 28 Sardinians with ARH from 17 unrelated families. We sequenced the coding regions and consensus splice sites of ARH in probands from these families, and from 40 individuals of non-Sardinian origin who had an autosomal recessive form of hypercholesterolaemia of unknown cause.",

Three of the ARH alleles contained both mutations, as a result of an ancient recombination between ARH1 and ARH2. No regional clustering of the three mutant alleles within Sardinia was apparent. Furthermore, four Italians from the mainland with autosomal recessive hypercholesterolaemia were homozygous for ARH1.",

    "26": "Combination therapy is increasingly recommended for patients with multiple lipid disorders, especially those at high risk for coronary events. We investigated the long-term safety and effectiveness of a new drug formulation containing once-daily extended-release niacin and lovastatin. A total of 814 men and women (mean age 59 years) with dyslipidemia were enrolled in a 52-week multicenter, open-label study. We used 4 escalating doses (niacin/lovastatin in milligrams): 500/10 for the first month, 1,000/20 for the second, 1,500/30 for the third, and 2,000/40 for the fourth month through week 52. Dose-dependent effects were observed for all major lipid parameters. At week 16, mean low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglycerides were reduced by 47% and 41%, respectively; mean high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was increased by 30% (all p <0.001). LDL/HDL cholesterol and total/HDL cholesterol ratios were also decreased by 58% and 48%, respectively. These effects persisted through week 52, except for the mean increase in HDL cholesterol, which had increased to 41% at 1 year. Lipoprotein (a) and C-reactive protein also decreased in a dose-related manner (by 25% and 24%, respectively, on 2,000/40 mg; p <0.01 vs baseline). Treatment was generally well tolerated. The most common adverse event was flushing, which caused 10% of patients to withdraw. Other adverse events included gastrointestinal upset, pruritus, rash, and headache. Drug-induced myopathy did not occur in any patient. The incidence of elevated liver enzymes to >3 times the upper limit of normal was 0.5%. Once-daily niacin/lovastatin exhibits substantial effects on multiple lipid risk factors and represents a significant new treatment option in the management of dyslipidemia.", 
    "27": "The efficacy and safety of atorvastatin 10 mg versus simvastatin 20 mg and atorvastatin 80 mg versus simvastatin 80 mg was determined in a 6-week, prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end-point trial of dyslipidemic patients with and without coronary heart disease. A total of 1,732 patients with hypercholesterolemia and triglycerides < or =600 mg/dl (6.8 mmol/L) were randomized to receive either atorvastatin 10 mg (n = 650), simvastatin 20 mg (n = 650), atorvastatin 80 mg (n = 216), or simvastatin 80 mg (n = 216). The primary efficacy parameter was the change in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol from baseline to week 6. Secondary efficacy parameters included the percent change from baseline to week 6 in total cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and the percent of patients achieving their National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) LDL cholesterol goal at study end. Atorvastatin had significantly greater reductions from baseline in LDL cholesterol than simvastatin in both comparator groups: atorvastatin 10 mg (37.1%) versus simvastatin 20 mg (35.4%) (p = 0.0097), and atorvastatin 80 mg (53.4%) versus simvastatin 80 mg (46.7%) (p <0.0001). Atorvastatin 10 and 80 mg also provided significantly greater reductions in total cholesterol, triglycerides, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B than simvastatin 20 and 80 mg, respectively (all p <0.05). All treatment groups had a significantly decreased LDL cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio from baseline (all p <0.0001). In both comparator groups a higher proportion of atorvastatin-treated patients reached their NCEP LDL cholesterol goal compared with simvastatin. All 4 study treatments were well tolerated.", 
    "28": "We earlier showed that lovastatin potentiated the chemopreventive effects of sulindac against colon neoplasia in a rodent model and augments apoptosis induced by 5-FU and cisplatin in human colon cancer cells. In the present study, we investigated effects of lovastatin in spontaneously immortalized rat intestinal epithelial cells, IEC-18 and their K-ras transformed clones. Lovastatin induced morphologic changes (cell rounding and detachment) and apoptosis that were not influenced by K-ras mutations, but were prevented by geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate or by mevalonate. Clostridium difficile toxin B, which directly inactivates rho, induced similar morphologic changes and apoptosis. Cycloheximide prevented these effects of lovastatin, but not C. difficile toxin B. Lovastatin decreased the amounts of membrane bound rhoA and rhoB. Cycloheximide and geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate prevented lovastatin induced morphologic changes and apoptosis but did not inhibit lovastatin-induced changes in membrane translocation of rho. Our data suggest that lovastatin induces morphologic changes and apoptosis by inhibiting geranylgeranylation of small GTPases of the rho family and thereby inactivating them. Restoration of membrane translocation of rho is not necessary for preventing lovastatin-induced morphologic changes or apoptosis.", 
    "29": "Movement of T-lymphocyte cell surface CD43 is associated with both antigen activation of T-cell clones and chemokine induction of T-lymphocyte motility. Here, we demonstrate that CD43 movement away from the site of T-cell receptor ligation occurs in unprimed CD4(+) T cells as well as T-cell clones. The T-cell receptor (TCR)-dependent movement of CD43 in unprimed T cells is associated with a polarized morphology and CD43 accumulation at the uropods of the cells, unlike that reported for primed T cells. The polarization of CD43 has a requirement for Src kinases and occurs in conjunction with lipid raft coalescence. Thymocytes and T-cell hybridomas, cells that have altered responses to TCR activation and lack lipid raft coalescence, do not polarize CD43 as readily as unprimed T cells. The movement of CD43 depends on the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase. Blockade of this enzyme can specifically prevent CD43 redistribution without affecting cell shape polarization. The likely mechanism of this alteration in CD43 redistribution is through decreased protein prenylation because the cholesterol-dependent lipid rafts still coalesce on activation. These findings suggest that the polarization of cell shape, lipid raft coalescence, and CD43 redistribution on T-cell activation have signaling pathway distinctions. Dissecting out the relationships between various stages of molecular redistribution and lymphocyte activation may facilitate fine-tuning of immunologic responses.", 
    "30": "Three large secondary prevention studies have shown that, in patients with a history of cardiovascular disease, statin treatment reduces the risk of further events and lowers overall mortality. In these studies, total mortality was reduced by as much as 30% in high-risk groups and 22% in average-risk groups. However, these studies did not include patients immediately after the coronary event. There are many benefits to early intervention with statin therapy in patients with acute coronary syndromes, including reduction of the risk of a subsequent event, which is highest immediately after the index event. Early treatment may reduce this likelihood in the first months after a coronary event by stabilizing atherosclerotic plaques and improving endothelial function in addition to lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. This article reviews the case for early statin therapy in patients with a history of coronary heart disease. Results of clinical studies have now shown early statin therapy to be safe and cost-effective in reducing in-hospital and 6-month mortality.",

    "32": "A single-center, open-label, 3-period, crossover drug interaction study was performed with 22 healthy volunteers.

Administration of colesevelam with dinner and lovastatin 4 hours later with a snack resulted in a decreased Cmax and AUC0-t for lovastatin (63% and 37%, respectively; p < 0.05) and an increased Cmax and AUC0-t for lovastatin hydroxyacid (61% and 50%, respectively; p < 0.05), both compared with lovastatin alone administered with dinner.", 
    "34": "Colesevelam had no significant effect on lovastatin pharmacokinetics when coadministered with lovastatin at dinner. A split-dosing regimen resulted in alterations in pharmacokinetic parameters for lovastatin and lovastatin hydroxyacid that are likely due to known differences in the pharmacokinetics of lovastatin when administered to patients with meals or in a fasting state.", 
    "35": "Apoptosis plays a central role in tumor development and it has been hypothesized that lack/failure of apoptosis leads to the development of tumors, including colon tumors. Thus, induction of apoptosis in tumor cells is an effective approach to the regulation of tumor growth. It has been shown by us and other investigators that various chemopreventive agents induce apoptosis and inhibit tumor growth. Identification of agents or combinations of agents that induce tumor cell apoptosis guides the development of novel agents for colon cancer treatment. Experiments were designed to assess the effectiveness of lovastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor, and celecoxib a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, individually or in combination on the induction of apoptosis in human HT-29 colon cancer cells. In addition, we studied the modulatory effect of lovastatin and celecoxib on lamin B levels, caspase-3 activity and expression in relationship to apoptosis in colon cancer cell lines. HT-29 cells exposed to various subtoxic levels of lovastatin or celecoxib or a combination of both were analyzed for apoptosis (by DAPI method), caspase-3 expression (immunoblot analysis) and caspase-3 activity (fluorimetric method). We found that: i) pretreatment with lovastatin (5-30 microM) induces apoptosis in HT-29 cells significantly only at high concentrations (> or = 20 microM) but not at low dose levels; ii) similarly, pretreatment with celecoxib produced apoptosis in colon cancer cells at high concentrations only (> or = 75 microM); iii) caspase-3 protein expression was moderately altered by the treatment with lovastatin or celecoxib at lower concentrations; however, a significant increase (1.6 to 4-fold) in caspase-3 expression and activity was found in HT-29 cells exposed with 20-25 microM lovastatin and/or 5-125 microM celecoxib and iv) importantly, in tumor cells exposed to low doses of (5 or 10 microM) lovastatin, combined with 25-75 microM of celecoxib, apoptosis induction rose 2.5 to 10-fold, caspase-3 expression was 2.3 to 8-fold higher, and enzyme activities were 1.5 to 5.5-fold elevated. This effect was highly synergistic and dose-dependent. Lamin B levels were significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner in cells treated with lovastatin but no such effect was observed with celecoxib. These results indicate that agents with different modes of action when applied in combinations will induce apoptosis synergistically by enhancing caspase-3 activities. These findings further support the hypothesis that HMGCo-R and COX-2 activities play important roles in apoptosis and regulation of apoptosis by selective agents such as lovastatin and celecoxib would provide effective strategies for the prevention of colon cancer.", 
    "36": "Several states have developed prescription-drug discount programs for Medicare beneficiaries. In California, Senate Bill 393, enacted in 1999, requires pharmacies participating in the state Medicaid program (Medi-Cal) to charge customers who present a Medicare card amounts based on Medi-Cal rates. Because Medicare beneficiaries may not be accustomed to presenting their Medicare cards at pharmacies, we assessed the compliance of pharmacies with Senate Bill 393.", 
    "37": "Fifteen Medicare beneficiaries who received special training and acted as \"standardized patients\" visited a random sample of pharmacies in the San Francisco Bay area and Los Angeles County in April and May 2001. According to a script, they asked for the prices of three commonly prescribed drugs: rofecoxib, sertraline, and atorvastatin. The script enabled us to determine whether and when, during their interactions with pharmacists or salespeople, the discounts specified in Senate Bill 393 were offered. Pharmacies at which the appropriate discounts were offered were considered compliant.", 
    "38": "The patients completed visits to 494 pharmacies. Seventy-five percent of the pharmacies complied with the prescription-drug discount program; at only 45 percent, however, was the discount offered before it was specifically requested. The discount was offered at 91 percent of pharmacies that were part of a chain, as compared with 58 percent of independent pharmacies (P<0.001). Compliance was higher in the San Francisco Bay area than in Los Angeles County (84 percent vs. 72 percent, P=0.004) and was higher in high-income than low-income neighborhoods (81 percent vs. 69 percent, P=0.002).

    "40": "Genetic variation at the APOE locus has been associated with plasma lipoprotein concentrations in the fasting (low-density, and high-density lipoproteins and triglycerides), and in the postprandial (triglyceride-rich lipoproteins) states. Resulting from these associations, the APOE locus has been found to be a significant genetic determinant of cardiovascular disease in the general population. Beyond the traditional association studies, APOE genetic variation has been shown to play a significant role, which explains some of the individual variations in therapies aimed at normalizing plasma lipid concentrations. Thus, the APOE E4 allele has been shown in some studies to be associated with increased response to dietary intervention. Conversely, APOE E2 carriers appear to be more responsive to statin therapy. The mechanisms behind these observations, however, have not been elucidated. Moreover, several other gene:environment and gene:therapy interactions have recently been demonstrated, thus further increasing the interest in this remarkable apolipoprotein.",

A reduction in the LDL cholesterol level during the 4 years tended to be associated with a lower odds of impairment (adjusted odds ratio, 0.61; 95% confidence interval, 0.36-1.03) compared with women whose levels increased. Higher total and LDL cholesterol levels, corrected for lipoprotein(a) levels, were also associated with a worse Modified Mini-Mental State Examination score and a higher likelihood of impairment, whereas high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels were not associated with cognition. Compared with nonusers, statin users had higher mean plus minus SD Modified Mini-Mental State Examination scores (92.7 plus minus 7.1 vs 93.7 plus minus 6.1; P =.02) and a trend for a lower likelihood of cognitive impairment (odds ratio, 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.42-1.05), findings that seemed to be independent of lipid levels.",

    "48": "We investigated the relationships of baseline and on-study lipids with subsequent CHD events in separate Cox models. Treatment effect on CHD event reduction was examined by baseline lipids and after adjustment for on-study lipid levels. Baseline lipids were significant predictors of CHD events.

Similar relative effects were observed for different categories of baseline lipids. The proportion of treatment effect explained by on-study lipid levels was 67% (95% CI, 27% to 106%) for the composite and 97% (95% CI, 49% to 145%) for the expanded end point.

    "54": "Freshly solubilized A beta peptides synergistically increase the magnitude of the constriction induced by endothelin-1 (ET-1), via the activation of a pro-inflammatory pathway. We report that mevinolin and mevastatin, two inhibitors of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase are able to completely abolish the vasoactive properties of A beta in rat aortae. Mevinolin also appears to oppose the increased vascular reactivity to ET-1 induced by interleukin 1-beta and phospholipase A(2) suggesting that statins display some anti-inflammatory properties. We show that freshly solubilized A beta stimulates prostaglandin E(2) and F(2 alpha) production (by 6 and 3.6 times, respectively) in isolated rat aortae and that mevinolin completely antagonizes this effect confirming the anti-inflammatory action of mevinolin ex vivo in rat aortae. In addition, we observed that A beta vasoactivity is not mediated nor modulated by mevalonic acid suggesting that the anti-inflammatory action of the statins are not related to an inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase activity. Differentiated human neuroblastoma cells (IMR32) were used to assess the neurotoxic effect of pre-aggregated A beta by quantifying the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the cell culture medium. A beta appears to enhance LDH release by 30% in IMR32 cells, an effect that can be completely opposed by mevastatin. Taken together these data show that statins can antagonize the effect of A beta in different assays and provide new clues to understand the prophylactic action of the statins against Alzheimer's disease.", 
    "55": "Cyclosporin A (CSA) and lovastatin (LV) are lipophilic drugs, which show poor and erratic absorption when administered perorally. The permeability of these compounds can be increased transiently by altering the membrane characteristics of the absorptive epithelium by the use of sorption promoters (SPs). In the present work a simple validated HPLC method utilizing an isocratic mobile phase with short retention times for CSA and LV was developed in order to monitor their concentrations in Kreb's Ringer bicarbonate (KRB) solution in vitro in intestinal sac absorption model. The same method was utilized to determine the apparent permeability coefficients and absorption profiles of CSA and LV by a modified Wilson-Wiseman method. Drugs were analysed by a reversed-phase HPLC method using a Shim-pack C18 column. An isocratic mobile phase containing acetonitrile and water in the proportions 70:30 and 80:20 was used for the HPLC analysis of CSA and LV, respectively. The flow-rate was 2 ml/min and quantitative determinations were carried out at 215 nm at 70 degrees C for CSA. In the case of LV the flow-rate was 1 ml/min and detection was done at 238 nm at 25 degrees C. The method was found to be specific as none of the proposed SPs, components of KRB or intestinal sac artefacts interfered with the drug peaks. Recovery studies and intra- and inter-day variations were within statistical limits. The limits of detection were 250 and 10 ng/ml and the limits of quantitation were 400 and 30 ng/ml for CSA and LV, respectively. The calibration curve was found to be linear in concentration range of 0.5-6 microg/ml for CSA and 0.05-0.4 microg/ml for LV. The proposed method was found to be rapid and selective and hence can be applied for continuous monitoring of CSA and LV in vitro in intestinal sac absorption studies.", 
    "56": "Treatment of acute coronary syndrome is under rapid progress. Nevertheless, the early complication rate remains high. Standard antithrombotic treatment is Aspirin 100 mg/d. Patients with elevated risk should be treated with Aspirin and Clopidogrel if primary invasive strategy ist not intended. Independent of the cholesterol level, statins should be given in the early phase of acute coronary syndrome. Dose adaptation is recommended after three months corresponding to the national guidelines. Mainly in diabetes mellitus, additional treatment with an ACE inhibitor lowers the overall cardiovascular risk also in patients without arterial hypertension or congestive heart failure. Six months after the acute event, risk stratification should be adapted.", 
    "57": "Clinical trials have firmly established that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) can induce the regression of vascular atherosclerosis and reduce cardiovascular-related morbidity and death in patients with and without coronary artery disease. It is usually assumed that these beneficial effects are due to the ability of statins to reduce cholesterol synthesis. However, because mevalonic acid is not only the precursor of cholesterol but also of many non-steroidal isoprenoid compounds, the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase may lead to pleiotropic effects. As shown by the data reported in this review, some statins can interfere with major events involved in the formation of atherosclerotic lesions, regardless of their hypolipidemic properties. The relevance of these effects in humans remains to be established (particularly in view of the high statin doses required to produce a direct vascular action), thus their contribution to the reduction in cardiovascular events observed in clinical trials has become one of the major challenges for future studies aimed at clarifying the anti-atherosclerotic benefits of statins.", 
    "58": "Diabetic dyslipidemia is featured by hypertriglyceridemia, low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, and elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol commonly in the form of small, dense LDL particles. First-line treatment, fibrates versus statins or both, of dyslipidemia in diabetic patients has been the focus of debate. We investigated the potential hypolipidemic effects of atorvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor with good triglyceride lowering properties, in patients with combined dyslipidemia and evidence of impaired fasting glucose or type 2 diabetes. Twenty patients were recruited for the study, and after a 60-day wash out period, baseline measurements of lipoprotein parameters, LDL particle diameter, and apolipoprotein B (apoB) degradation fragments were obtained. The group was then randomized, in a double-blinded manner, into 2 subgroups. Group A received atorvastatin (80 mg) and group B received placebo daily for 60 days. After the first treatment period, all patients were reanalyzed for the above parameters. The treatment regime then crossed over for the second treatment period in which group A received placebo and group B received atorvastatin (80 mg) daily for 60 days. All parameters were remeasured at the end of the study. Treatment with atorvastatin resulted in a statistically significant reduction in total cholesterol (41%), LDL cholesterol (55%), triglycerides (TG) (32%), and apoB (40%). Mean LDL particle diameter significantly increased from 25.29 +/- 0.24 nm (small, dense LDL subclass) to 26.51 < 0.18 nm (intermediate LDL subclass) after treatment with atorvastatin (n = 20, P <.005). At baseline, LDL particles were predominantly found in the small, dense subclass; atorvastatin treatment resulted in a shift in the profile to the larger and more buoyant LDL subclass. Atorvastatin treatment did not produce consistent changes in the appearance of apoB degradation fragments in plasma. Our results suggest that atorvastatin beneficially alters the atherogenic lipid profile in these patients and significantly decreases the density of LDL particles produced resulting in a shift from small, dense LDL to more buoyant and less atherogenic particles.",

    "60": "Extracellular adenosine production by the GPI-anchored Ecto-5'-Nucleotidase (Ecto-5'-Nu) plays an important role in the cardiovascular system, notably in defense against hypoxia. It has been previously suggested that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (HRIs) could potentiate the hypoxic stimulation of Ecto-5'Nu in myocardial ischemia. In order to elucidate the mechanism of Ecto-5'-Nu stimulation by HRIs, Ecto-5'-Nu activity and expression were determined in an aortic endothelial cell line (SVAREC) incubated with lovastatin. Lovastatin enhanced Ecto-5'-Nu activity in a dose-dependent manner. This increase was not supported by de novo synthesis of the enzyme because neither the mRNA content nor the total amount of the protein were modified by lovastatin. By contrast, lovastatin enhanced cell surface expression of Ecto-5'-Nu and decreased endocytosis of Ecto-5'-Nu, as evidenced by immunostaining. This effect appeared unrelated to modifications of cholesterol content or Ecto-5'-Nu association with detergent-resistant membranes. The effect of lovastatin was reversed by mevalonate, the substrate of HMG-CoA reductase, by its isoprenoid derivative, geranyl-geranyl pyrophosphate, and by cytotoxic necrotizing factor, an activator of Rho-GTPases. Stimulation of Ecto-5'-Nu by lovastatin enhanced the inhibition of platelet aggregation induced by endothelial cells. In conclusion, lovastatin enhances Ecto-5'-Nu activity and membrane expression in endothelial cells. This effect seems independent of lowering cholesterol content but could be supported by an inhibition of Ecto-5'-Nu endocytosis through a decrease of Rho-GTPases isoprenylation.", 
    "61": "Estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) is claimed to reduce cardiovascular mortality by about 50% in postmenopausal women. This improvement is caused by favorable changes in lipid and lipoproteins metabolism, however, it also increases the incidence of the endometrial hyperplasia. Addition of progestin to ERT, referred to as hormone replacement therapy (HRT), has been shown to successively reduce this risk to the endometrium. Unfortunately, it has an adverse effect on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC) concentration, thus compromising the benefits of ERT. Therefore the issue here whether HRT given alone and/or concomitantly with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (lovastatin) could exert any significant additional favorable effect on the lipid profile in bilaterally ovariectomized female rats. Sixty female Wistar rats were ovariectomized and treated with ERT (0.625 mg kg (-1)estradiol, E (2), IM every 2 weeks), HRT (estradiol plus progesterone, E (2)+ P, 0.625 mg kg (-1)estradiol and 5 mg progesterone kg (-1) respectively, IM every 2 weeks), and lovastatin (20 mg kg (-1)day (-1)orally) plus HRT (L + HRT) for 6 weeks. Blood aliquots were collected for serum and plasma separation. Serum vitamin E and plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), nitric oxide (NO), lipid profile, and the susceptibility of non-HDLC to oxidation were determined. Moreover, thoracic aortas were dissected and directed for measurement of its lipid peroxide and NO contents. Treatment of ovariectomized rats with HRT showed a significant decrease ( P< 0.0001) in HDLC concentration compared to the group treated alone with ERT and increase ( P< 0.0001) in CRP levels compared to ovariectomized rats. HDLC and CRP are two powerful and significant predictors for increased cardiovascular risk in postmenopausal women. Addition of lovastatin as a complementary therapy to HRT revealed a significant 27% increment in HDLC and 48% decrement in CRP concentrations. Moreover, it significantly increased vitamin E, each of plasma and tissue content of NO and decreased atherogenic indexes (TC/HDLC, LDLC/HDLC), aortic lipid peroxide and susceptibility of non-HDLC to oxidation. In conclusion, this current study demonstrated that lovastatin together with continuous combined HRT seems to be more effective in the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease not only due to lipid lowering properties but also related to several other additive effects such as modification of endothelial function and inflammatory responses.", 
    "62": "In this study, we investigated the effect of atorvastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and CL277082, an ACAT inhibitor, on apolipoprotein B48 synthesis, degradation and secretion in transformed human intestinal enterocytes (CaCo2 cells). Cells were incubated with atorvastatin or CL277082 in the absence or presence of sterol containing media and pulsed with [S35]-methionine and chased with unlabelled methionine. Concomitantly, the effect of atorvastatin and CL277082 on the relative amount of apoB48 protein in cells and media was also quantified by western blotting using an apoB antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence. Suppression of cholesterol synthesis with atorvastatin did not attenuate the production or secretion of apoB48 from CaCo2 cells under basal conditions. On the other hand, suppression of cholesterol biosynthesis with atorvastatin under stimulatory conditions accelerated the degradation of apoB48 in cells without affecting its synthesis or secretion. There was no effect of exogenous sterols on apoB48 secretion. Taken together, neither endogenous nor exogenous cholesterol appears to acutely modulate apoB48 secretion from intestinal cells. In contrast, inhibition of cholesterol esterification with ACAT inhibitor significantly attenuated apoB48 secretion under basal and stimulatory conditions by a mechanism which enhanced apoB48 degradation. Collectively, our results suggest that in CaCo2 cells, newly synthesized cholesterol ester may be an immediate regulator apoB48 secretion.", 
    "63": "The mechanism by which 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) induce apoptosis in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) is unknown. In this work, we demonstrate that treatment of VSMCs with simvastatin and atorvastatin inhibited Bcl-2 expression in a time and dose-dependent manner, while Bax expression was not modified. This effect was reversed by mevalonate (100 micromol/l), farnesylpyrophosphate (5 micromol/l) or geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (5 micromol/l), suggesting the involvement of protein prenylation. The treatment of VSMCs with lipophilic statins was associated with decreased prenylation of p-21 Rho A and mevalonate, farnesyl pyrophosphate (F-PP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (G-PP) reversed prenylation to basal levels. In addition, overexpression of constitutively active Q63L Rho A prevented, at least in part, apoptosis induced by statins and downregulation of Bcl-2. We also investigated the participation of caspases (proteases) in the apoptosis induced by statins. The treatment of VSMCs with lipophilic statins induced activation of the caspase 9, the first caspase of the mitochondrial pathway. Coincubation of VSMCs with the caspase inhibitor ZVAD-fmk (100 micromol/l) significantly inhibited lipophilic statin-induced apoptosis. These findings indicate that the downregulation of Bcl-2 by Rho GTPases mediates statin-induced apoptosis and suggest a new potential mechanism of action for these drugs on the regulation of cell number in the atherosclerotic lesions.", 
    "64": "The mechanism by which atorvastatin lowers plasma triglyceride (TG) levels is mainly through a decrease in hepatic TG secretion. However, it is not clear why atorvastatin, which does not inhibit TG synthesis in vitro, decreases hepatic TG secretion without a prospective increase in hepatic TG concentration. For the investigation of the mechanisms that underlie the hypotriglyceridemic effects of atorvastatin, we characterized the effect of either a single or an 11 day administration of atorvastatin in sucrose-induced hypertriglyceridemic rats. Atorvastatin (30 mg/kg p.o.) strongly decreased the rate of both very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-TG and VLDL-apolipoprotein B secretion. The inhibitor also decreased hepatic TG concentration. Hepatic TG synthesis activity was also decreased by atorvastatin, and its activity was correlated with both hepatic and plasma TG concentration. There was also a strong correlation between the hepatic TG synthesis and hepatic non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) concentration (r(2)=0.815). These effects required chronic administration of the inhibitor and were not observed by acute treatment. Repeated administration of atorvastatin also strongly reduced hepatic acyl-coenzyme A synthase mRNA levels. These results suggest that the reduced hepatic NEFA most likely lowers hepatic TG synthesis and TG secretion in sucrose-fed hypertriglyceridemic rats.", 
    "65": "Besides hyperglycemia and hypertension, a recently recognized risk factor for diabetic retinopathy (DR) appears to be hyperlipidemia. While studies using earlier generation lipid lowering agents in DR were disappointing, a randomized trial using HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors has strong rationale, though hitherto not attempted. The aim of the present study was to compare the HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitor, simvastatin, with placebo in patients having DR in a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial. Fifty patients with diabetes mellitus (Type 1 and 2) with good glycemic control and hypercholesterolemia and having DR (non-clinically significant macular edema and visual acuity 6/24 or better) in either or both eyes were randomized to simvastatin 20-mg per day or placebo, and were followed up for 180 days. On simvastatin therapy, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) decreased (P < 0.001, respectively), and the level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) increased (P < 0.001). VA improved in four patients using simvastatin, (not statistically different from placebo group) and worsening of VA occurred in seven patients in the placebo group and none in the simvastatin group (P = 0.009). Fundus fluorescein angiography and color fundus photograph showed improvement in one patient in the simvastatin group, while seven patients showed worsening in the placebo group (P = 0.009). The observations of the current study suggest that the HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitor simvastatin significantly retards the progression of retinopathy in diabetic patients with hypercholesterolemia. The potential of this class of drugs for the primary prevention of DR and other microvascular complications needs to be explored further.",

Furthermore, we cloned the mutated K-ras gene from the tumors and inserted it into vectors to transfect normal bovine adrenocortical cells to express the mutated K-ras gene. The mRNA level of steroidogenic enzymes such as cholesterol sidechain cleavage enzyme (P450SCC), 17alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase (P450c17), and 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3betaHSD) in the mutant K-ras stably transfected cells were elevated. Cultured normal adrenocortical cells from donors and patients with adrenocortical tumors were then transfected with mutant K-ras expression plasmids constructed from human adrenal tumors. Stable transfectants grew faster than normal cells. Additionally, morphologic change was observed in the transfected cells. Moreover, when the synthesis of hormones was analyzed, the mRNA of P450SCC, P450C17, and 3betaHSD was found to have increased, and the level of cortisol was 18 to 25 times that in control cells. The increased steroid hormone production in mutant K-ras-transfected cells was reversed by lovastatin, a pharmacologic inhibitor of p21ras function. These results, combined with previous reports of steroidogenic K-ras in bovine adrenocortical cells, suggest that the K-ras oncogene is involved in steroidogenesis in human adrenocortical cells.",

This effect was confirmed using quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Actinomycin D studies revealed that Hcy stabilized HMGCR mRNA (tau(1/2), 9.5 +/- 1.0 versus 5.0 +/- 0.2 hours). Expression of immunodetectable HMGCR in both HUVECs and renal microvascular endothelial cells was increased in Hcy-treated cells in association with the increased abundance of caveolin. Application of a cell-permeable superoxide dismutase mimetic, Mn-TBAP, reversed the Hcy-induced expression of HMGCR. Additional biochemical analysis of the abundance of total cellular cholesterol showed that 0, 20, 50, and 100 micromol/L Hcy resulted in 22.2 +/- 7.3%, 39.5 +/- 1.2%, and 50.4 +/- 6.8% increase, respectively. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry analysis of extracted cholesterol from Hcy-treated HUVECs and from the culture medium showed 17.8 +/- 5.2% and 24.0 +/- 14.5% increases, respectively. Application of simvastatin to Hcy-treated cells reduced cellular cholesterol and prevented Hcy-induced suppression of NO production by HUVECs in a dose-dependent manner.",

Simvastatin treatment (either 1 or 2 mg/kg body weight for 12 or 20 weeks) increased superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities in SHR rats compared with untreated control SHR rats. Carbachol-induced relaxation of aortic rings was impaired in control SHR rats and was restored by simvastatin treatment. Addition of SOD improved the response in control SHR rats and did not have any effect in treated SHR rats. Addition of diethyldithiocarbamic acid, a selective inhibitor of SOD, produced a mild non-significant impairment in carbachol-induced relaxation in control SHR rats, suggesting a deficient antioxidant system in these animals. However, in treated SHR and in WKY rats, impairment of the relaxation was marked, implying that SOD activity in these animals was important to maintain endothelial function. In aortic rings without endothelium from SHR rats, contraction induced by free radicals was substantially higher than in WKY rats. This effect was attenuated in 1-mg-treated rats and abolished in 2-mg-treated rats.",

The amount of p27 is greatest in G(0) cells, intermediate in G(1) cells, and lowest in S-phase cells. However, there is little known regarding the pathways and mechanisms controlling p27 accumulation in G(0) cells. We report that inhibition of Rho, by either lovastatin or C3 exoenzyme, can increase the translational efficiency of p27 mRNA. Similar pharmacologic inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, the S6 kinase, and the Mek1 kinase pathways all fail to increase translational efficiency in MDA468 cells. This Rho-responsive element lies within a 300-nucleotide region at the 3'-end of the mRNA. By supporting the significance of this signaling pathway to Rho function, we showed that the suppression of Ras(V12) transformation by RhoA(N19) is blocked in p27-/- cells. In contrast this activity is not blocked in Rb-/- or p16-/- cells. The resistance of p27-/- cells to RhoA(N19) is not associated with a failure of RhoA(N19) to accumulate to amounts sufficient to block Rho activity as measured by the organization of actin stress fibers. Together these results indicate a link between Rho and p27.",

Evidence from the Air Force/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention Study suggests that statin therapy may be effective in reducing incident coronary events among those with elevated levels of C-reactive protein but normal levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. These data, along with accumulating laboratory data, support a potential anti-inflammatory benefit of statins.

The first description after medication with clofibrate dates back to 1968. Apparently, all fibrates can induce myopathy. It usually starts after a few days of medication, or after prolonged use, showing muscle weakness and/or pain. Concomitantly, the enzyme creatininephosphokinase (CPK) is raised dramatically. Muscular necrosis can follow leading secondarily to kidney failure, and eventually to death. For the class of statins, myopathy was more often seen after their introduction, and it became their most feared adverse effect, especially in combination of statins with other drugs (mibefradil, gemfibrozil, cyclosporin). In animal models the evolution of the disease and the mechanism of action may be elucidated. Though strong epidemiological data are lacking, the incidence of myopathy is probably similar for all lipid-lowering drugs and is in the range of 0.1-0.5% with monotherapy, increasing to 0.5-2.5% with combination therapy. Severe cases of rhabdomyolysis are rarer, but may have a significant mortality. The market success of cerivastatin within a short period has led to 100s of myopathies and some dozens of deaths. Though interactions on metabolism and ensuing high plasma levels can partially explain myopathy as intoxication, there are strong indications that other (endocrine, metabolic, genetic) factors might play a role in the pathophysiology. The patient population at risk should better be defined and withheld from myopathy-inducing drugs.", 
    "114": "Considering the therapeutic effect of statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) and simvastatin in patients with coronary heart disease, our first hypothesis was that simvastatin should inhibit apoptosis (programmed cell death) in angiotensin II-treated cultured myocytes. But after realizing that simvastatin stimulates apoptosis, we changed our hypothesis and began to study its apoptotic effect in primary cultured rat cardiomyocytes. We found that simvastatin induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner (0.1 to 3 micromol/L), as evidenced by the appearance of increased DNA fragmentation in agarose gels and characteristic apoptotic patterns in nuclei labeled with Hoechst 33342, as well as increased activity of caspase 3. FACS analysis of simvastatin-treated cardiomyocytes showing annexin V binding and propidium iodide exclusion ruled out the possibility of necrosis. Increased intracellular enzymatic activity of creatine phosphokinase, aldolase, and lactic dehydrogenase, markers for normal cell function, could reflect the hypertrophic effect of simvastatin. The results indicate that simvastatin-induced apoptosis in cultured heart cells is concentration-dependent and additive to the apoptotic effect of angiotensin II.",

This suppressive effect was quickly reversed by geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP) and was mimicked by inhibitors of Rho and Rho kinase. LPC induced the translocation of the GTP-bound active form of RhoA into membranes within 1 minute as determined by a pull-down assay and reduced the levels of RhoA in the cytoplasm, indicating that LPC quickly increases the GTP/GDP ratio of RhoA and induces membrane translocation. Statins prevented the GTP/GDP exchange of RhoA and its membrane translocation from the cytoplasm caused by LPC, and these effects of statins were reversed by GGPP. The responses of RhoA activation to statins and GGPP concurred with their effects on Ca2+ mobilization. LPC also induced a nonselective cation current after a lag.

Cerivastatin stimulated NO release at a favorable rate and scavenged O2-, which led to the preservation of the active concentration of NO. The sustained effect (after approximately 6 hours) of cerivastatin on endothelium was associated with an approximately 35% increase in NO release as compared with the initial effect. In contrast to the initial effect, the sustained effect of cerivastatin was shown at concentrations approximately 100-fold lower and was dependent on inhibition of endothelial HMG-CoA reductase.",

Thus, it can be hypothesized that chronic systemic treatment of elderly patients with a drug that induces angiogenesis by a VEGF-like manner will also promote tumor growth.", 
    "136": "Atherosclerotic peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a common disorder usually associated with silent or symptomatic arterial disease elsewhere in the circulation and a cluster of cardiovascular risk factors inducing atheroma progression and/or thrombotic complications. Because of these strong clinical associations, especially with coronary heart disease, the ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) is of prognostic significance. The clinical management of IC should include relief of symptoms combined with prevention of secondary cardiovascular complications, e.g. acute thrombotic events causing limb- or life-threatening ischaemia, which are often due to atherosclerotic plaque rupture leading to thrombotic vessel occlusion. Many patients with PAD do not receive an optimum package of secondary prevention, tailored to include maximum cholesterol reduction, BP and glycaemic control, ACE inhibition and single or combination anti-platelet therapy. This review considers recent information from large secondary prevention trials, e.g. the PAD subgroups within the HOPE, CAPRIE and statin studies. Slowing progression of atherosclerosis, and inducing stabilisation and regression of atheromatous plaques, is now feasible using long-term combination drug therapy. The phrase angle quotation mark, leftangle quotation mark, leftconservative therapyangle quotation mark, rightangle quotation mark, right, popular among vascular surgeons, implies a passive minimal-intervention strategy of surveillance and lifestyle advice; such terminology is perhaps no longer appropriate since considerable improvements in survival are likely to accrue if all patients with PAD, especially those with low ABPI, receive vigorous, titrated medical therapies, tailored to individual patients, as part of an evidence-based secondary prevention regime.",

In this study, the authors investigated how lipid-lowering therapy effects on the progression of aortic atherosclerosis by using plain and enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the lower abdominal aorta. Twenty-nine hyperlipidemic patients (mean age 61.4 +/- 7.2 yr) were enrolled in a prospective open-labeled study. All patients underwent baseline CT scanning of abdominal aorta, screening for serum lipid profile and coagulation-fibrinolysis measurement, then treatment with simvastatin was begun. After 2 years, a follow-up CT scan was done and atherosclerotic lesions were compared between baseline and on-treatment scan. In spite of significant improvement of lipid and fibrinolytic profiles by simvastatin administration, mean aortic wall thickening volume (AWV) was increased during observation period. When patients were divided into subgroups by the levels of on-treatment LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), development rate of AWV was more potently suppressed in patients whose on-treatment LDL-C were below 125 mg/dL (median LDL-C). We could not find any associations of coagulation-fibrinolysis measurements with atherosclerotic lesions. In regard to aortic calcification volume (ACV), low levels of total and HDL cholesterol and higher age were associated with aortic calcification at baseline. These results suggest that aggressive treatment with LDL-C below 125 mg/dL may suppress the progression of wall thickening and factors that promote arterial calcifications and those for wall thickening may be different.",

To assess the early effects of lipid-lowering treatment on these parameters, six groups of New Zealand male rabbits were studied. Animals in groups I and II were fed regular chow; groups III and IV received a 12-week 0.5% cholesterol diet followed by 12 weeks of 0.05% cholesterol diet. Finally, groups V and VI were fed a 12-week 0.5% cholesterol diet and were then shifted to a regular diet for 12 weeks. During the last four weeks, the rabbits in groups I, III, and V received low-dose pravastatin (2 mg/day), added to the diet. Group IV animals had the highest cholesterol plasma levels (vs. groups I, II, III, and V, p < 0.01) and presented atherosclerotic plaques in a more advanced stage. Nonatherogenic diet was insufficient to restore endothelial function in animals previously fed cholesterol-enriched diets (groups IV and VI). Conversely, pravastatin treatment promoted significant improvement in endothelial function and reduced the progression of atherosclerosis. Marked increase in cholesterol content was seen in aorta and liver in response to the atherogenic diet. However, neither treatment with pravastatin nor nonatherogenic diet was capable of modifying the tissue cholesterol content. Our study supports the hypothesis that the early use of statins can attenuate the progression of atherosclerosis and ameliorate endothelial function. In addition, significant changes in the tissue cholesterol pool probably need a longer period of treatment.",

In the present study, the involvement of rat organic anion transporter 3 (rOat3; Slc22a8) in the renal uptake of pravastatin was investigated. Immunohistochemical staining indicates the basolateral localization of rOat3 in the kidney. rOat1- and rOat3-expressed LLC-PK1 cells exhibited specific uptake of p-aminohippurate (PAH) and pravastatin, respectively, with the Michaelis-Menten constants (Km values) of 60 microM for rOat1-mediated PAH uptake and 13 microM for rOat3-mediated pravastatin uptake. Saturable uptake of PAH and pravastatin was observed in kidney slices with Km values of 69 and 11 microM, respectively. The difference in the potency of PAH and pravastatin in inhibiting uptake by kidney slices suggests that different transporters are responsible for their renal uptake. This was also supported by the difference in the degree of inhibition by benzylpenicillin, a relatively selective inhibitor of rOat3, for the uptake of PAH and pravastatin by kidney slices. These results suggest that rOat1 and rOat3 are mainly responsible for the renal uptake of PAH and pravastatin, respectively.",

Familial hypercholesterolemia is under-recognized and under-treated despite well-known benefits from available lipid-lowering medications. To help address these problems, the humanitarian MEDPED (Make Early Diagnoses, Prevent Early Deaths) organization was developed as a means to find and help persons with familial hypercholesterolemia all over the world. Although some patients with familial hypercholesterolemia can be treated adequately with a statin alone, many require aggressive treatment with a combination of drugs, including a statin, bile acid sequestrant, and niacin to reach LDL goals. Such treatment has resulted in regression of angiographically monitored coronary lesions in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "142": "Lovastatin, the drug used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, has previously been reported to exert antitumor activity in experimental murine models. Butyrate and butyric acid derivatives are well known to induce differentiation and apoptosis of tumour cells and also have recently gained acceptance as potential anticancer agents. In this study, we examined the antitumor effects of the combination of lovastatin and butyrate or its prodrug tributyrin in vitro and in vivo against a murine Lewis lung carcinoma (3LL). This combination therapy showed synergistic antitumor activity against 3LL cells in vitro. These effects were at least in part due to apoptosis induction that occurred after 12 hr of incubation with lovastatin and butyrate and was preceded by changes in cell cycle distribution of treated cells and expression of p21, p53 and cyclin D1. Remarkably, a systemic treatment of syngeneic mice inoculated with 3LL cells with both drugs resulted in significant tumour growth retardation.", 
    "143": "An intense debate has developed as to the risk-benefit ratio of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) following the withdrawal of cerivastatin. The development of rhabdomyolysis in cerivastatin-treated patients should have surprised few since myotoxicity is an accepted class effect of statins. What has sprung from the cerivastatin experience though is a concern for other members of this class. Such misgivings, although understandable, are ill advised. Without question, differences exist in the risk of rhabdomyolysis occurrence amongst the various statins. In this regard, pravastatin and fluvastatin are least likely to produce rhabdomyolysis, which, in part, relates to the fact they are not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 3A4 pathway. When muscle damage occurs with statins it is most often the result of a drug-drug interaction rather than a specific adverse response to statin monotherapy. Such drug-drug interactions increase plasma concentrations of a statin and thereby increase the risk of myotoxicity. A growing consensus exists which supports an expanded use of statins in a range of patient groups including the renal failure patient. Polypharmacy and altered drug metabolism increase the risk of myotoxicity, albeit to an ill-defined degree, in this population. Many factors should enter into the choice of a statin in the multiply medicated renal failure patient.", 
    "144": "Bladder infections caused by uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) depends on the ability of E. coli to express type 1 pili. The adhesive component of the pilus, FimH, mediates the invasion of E. coli into the bladder epithelium, a mechanism that facilitates the survival and persistence of E. coli in the bladder. The invasion mechanism requires actin polymerization, focal adhesion kinase phosphorylation and PI 3-kinase activation as well as the formation of FAK/PI 3-kinase and downstream vinculin/alpha-actinin complexes. In this study, we report a role for Rho-GTPase family members, namely RhoA, Cdc42 and Rac1, in the invasion process. Internalization of type 1-piliated E. coli (fimH+) and FimH-coated micro-spheres was inhibited by compactin, a pan-Rho-GTPase inhibitor and dominant negative isoforms of Rac1 and Cdc42. Expression of active Rac1 induced an internalization of E. coli that was insensitive to wortmannin and genistein. Expression of constitutively active Cdc42 induced the formation of FAK/PI 3-kinase and vinculin/alpha-actinin complexes whereas active Rac1 induced only a vinculin/alpha-actinin complex. Taken together, these data suggest that FimH-mediated invasion is dependent on GTP-binding protein activity that involves Cdc42 and PI 3-kinase activation probably upstream of Rac1.", 
    "145": "Calmodulin (CaM) is a small Ca2+-binding protein highly conserved in eukaryotes. We have reported previously a novel rice CaM-like protein (OsCaM61) which contains an N-terminal CaM domain and a C-terminal extension with a potential prenylation site. Here we report in vitro activity assays confirm OsCaM61 as a functional CaM. Using the green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a visual marker, we further studied the subcellular localization of OsCaM61 in stably transformed tobacco cells. The GFP-OsCaM61 fusion protein was membrane-associated whereas OsCaM61-GFP was mainly detected in the nucleoplasm. GFP-OsCaM61 was transported into the nucleoplasm upon a block in isoprenoid biosynthesis by mevinolin treatment of cells. These results indicate that the prenylated OsCaM61 molecules are mainly membrane-associated whereas its unprenylated counterparts are transported into the nucleoplasm. Thus, OsCaM61 may play functions in co-ordinating Ca2+ signaling with isoprenoid metabolism.", 
    "146": "The guidelines recently released by the National Cholesterol Education Program call for more aggressive lowering of the level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and a significant increase in the number of patients eligible for therapy that lowers the level of LDL. Despite the efficacy of statins in lowering the LDL level and in reducing the risk of a coronary event or stroke, other cholesterol-lowering therapies are needed. Some patients are unable to tolerate statins or are not candidates for statin therapy because of liver enzyme abnormalities, age, a preference for nonsystemic therapy, or a modestly elevated LDL level. For those patients, bile acid sequestrants, intestinal bile acid transport inhibitors, acyl coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase inhibitors, and a number of nonselective cholesterol absorption inhibitors are alternative treatments. However, those agents vary in their effectiveness in reducing the level of LDL. Their use often does not reduce the LDL level to the extent desired or is compromised by patients' poor compliance with therapy because of inconvenient dosing or unpleasant side effects. Ezetimibe, the first selective inhibitor of intestinal cholesterol absorption, is a promising alternative to the agents listed above. When ezetimibe is used either as monotherapy or in combination with a statin, once-daily dosing reduces the level of LDL by an average of 18%.", 
    "147": "Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials evaluating the selective cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe have demonstrated that the drug is safe and effective, both as monotherapy and in combination with several statins. Placebo-controlled phase 2 studies of 8 and 12 weeks' duration established that ezetimibe monotherapy achieved maximum cholesterol lowering at doses between 10 and 20 mg daily. Additional dose-scheduling studies demonstrated that evening dosing was only slightly more effective than morning dosing, and that the drug could be taken with or without food without any impairment in efficacy. These studies also showed that ezetimibe was well tolerated, with side effects no different from those seen with placebo. Short-term, early phase 2 studies evaluating the coadministration of ezetimibe and a number of different statins found that coadministration was safe, that ezetimibe did not alter the pharmacokinetics of the statins or vice versa, and that the reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were complementary, with the degree of cholesterol lowering seen with ezetimibe monotherapy maintained when it was given in combination with a statin. These studies indicate that combination therapy with ezetimibe and a starting dose of a statin produces a reduction in cholesterol levels equivalent to that seen with an 8-fold higher statin dose. Larger, long-term phase 3 trials confirmed the efficacy and safety of the 10-mg dose and also demonstrated that ezetimibe monotherapy is an excellent alternative for patients who cannot tolerate statins.", 
    "148": "Ezetimibe, the first in a new class of selective cholesterol absorption inhibitors, reduces plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by selectively preventing the intestinal uptake of dietary and biliary cholesterol. Initial studies in animals show that ezetimibe lowers both serum and liver cholesterol in a dose-dependent manner without decreasing the absorption of triglycerides or fat-soluble vitamins. It also appears to function primarily as its glucuronidated derivative and, in this form, localizes almost exclusively to the intestinal mucosal cells after initial absorption and glucuronidation in the gut and liver. Preclinical studies show that ezetimibe also lowers LDL effectively, whereas studies in apolipoprotein E knockout mice show that it reduces LDL, very-low-density lipoproteins, and the formation of atherosclerotic plaque in the aorta. Because of its safety and specificity, and because its mechanism of action complements that of the statins, ezetimibe is an attractive component in combination therapy. Coadministration of ezetimibe and a statin in dogs demonstrates larger reductions in cholesterol levels than therapy with either agent alone.", 
    "149": "The relationship between increased serum levels of total cholesterol and increased risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) is widely accepted, as is the corollary that lowering elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, a significant risk factor, reduces CHD mortality. Although statins are the most widely used agents to lower LDL cholesterol levels and demonstrate significant clinical benefits, alternate and/or additional treatment strategies are also being studied. One such approach for which several classes of agents are available is the nonspecific inhibition of intestinal cholesterol and bile acid absorption. Although all of these inhibitors-which include bile acid sequestrants, cholesterol absorption blockers, and plant stanols-reduce cholesterol concentrations within liver cells and increase the expression of LDL receptors, they are limited in their effectiveness because of poor tolerability and compensatory effects by the liver that blunt their ability to lower LDL. Ideally, the combination of a statin and another agent that specifically targets cholesterol absorption and promotes excretion while simultaneously decreasing synthesis may provide the greatest therapeutic benefit. The recent development of selective cholesterol inhibitors, including ezetimibe, provides an approach to lowering LDL that has significant potential both as monotherapy and in combination therapy.", 
    "150": "C3 complement is produced in response to macrophage activation and is a reliable marker of the risk of myocardial infarction in men. This study was designed to ascertain whether the treatment with atorvastatin, a powerful cholesterol lowering drug, and/or vitamin E, a natural antioxidant, may induce a short term decrease in serum C3 in subjects with persistently elevated levels. From an initial random sample of 1100 men aged 55-64 years, 140 subjects with 3 consecutive C3 measurements in the high tertile (>1.19 g/l) were selected. Those with total cholesterol <5.56 mmol/l were double blindly randomized in groups 1 (placebo, N = 28, G1) and 2 (vitamin E 600 IU/day, N= 30, G2). The subjects with total cholesterol values >5.56 mmol/l were randomized in groups 3 (placebo, N= 30, G3), 4 (atorvastatin 10 mg/day, N = 27, G4) and 5 (atorvastatin 10 mg/day + vitamin E 600 IU/day, N = 25, G5). After 3 months C3 levels were substantially unchanged in the first 4 groups, while in G5 a very significant decrement occurred: -0.070 g/l (5.2%); 95% CI 0.043-0.098; p <0.0001. \"Normal\" levels of C3 (< 1.19 g/l) were reached by 28% of G5 subjects. In G2 and G5 vitamin E levels increased by 60 and 36%, while in G4 they decreased by 23% (p < 0.0001), paralleling cholesterol and triglyceride fall. In all groups a progressive decrease in HDL cholesterol occurred (-17%, p < 0.0001). In conclusion, treatment with atorvastatin plus vitamin E for three months can lower persistently elevated C3 levels.", 
    "151": "Reducing elevated levels of low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) significantly reduces the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) events and mortality in hypercholesterolemic patients. CHD risk reduction is proportional to LDL-C reduction. Despite this knowledge, many physicians are not applying existing treatment guidelines to the extent required to achieve target LDL-C levels. Target LDL-C levels are not achievable for most patients without drug therapy. Based on their lipid-lowering abilities, safety, and tolerability profiles, the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are the first-line pharmacotherapeutic agents for hypercholesterolemia. The ability of statins to reduce CHD events and total mortality in primary- and secondary-prevention patients also supports this assertion. For combined dyslipidemia, statin monotherapy is a reasonable initial approach in patients with moderate hypertriglyceridemia because statins effectively lower both LDL-C and triglycerides. Fibrates or niacin are effective therapies for severe hypertriglyceridemia. Resins are moderately effective in isolated hypercholesterolemia, and are a useful alternative to statins in pregnant women or patients with liver disease. For severe hyperlipidemia that does not respond to single drug therapy, combination drug therapy may be required. This article reviews the various manifestations of dyslipidemia and assesses the most efficacious treatments.",

Fluvastatin increased survival (61% versus 86%; P<0.05) without affecting the infarct size (52+/-2% versus 49+/-3%; P=NS). Fluvastatin not only attenuated LV dilatation but also decreased LV end-diastolic pressure and lung weight. Furthermore, it reduced cardiac myocyte hypertrophy and interstitial fibrosis of the noninfarcted LV and also improved LV ejection performance. LV matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-13 were increased in myocardial infarction, which was attenuated in fluvastatin-treated mice.", 
    "159": "Fluvastatin increased survival in a murine model of postinfarct heart failure, which was associated with the amelioration of LV structural remodeling and contractile failure. Moreover, these effects were associated with the attenuation of increased MMP activity.

    "160": "It is becoming increasingly recognized that the beneficial effects of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-Co-A) reductase inhibitors (statins) on reducing clinically important cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction and stroke) are not only attributable to their hypocholesterolemic effect but also to non-lipid mechanisms of action. The nonlipid factors may include the stabilization of arterial plaques, endothelial normalization, anti-inflammatory effects and inhibition of platelet thrombus formation. The inhibition of platelet thrombus formation has not been adequately studied in man and the results are often contradictory. It is the objective of this review to discuss the effects of statins on platelet aggregation in the context of relatively new and specific techniques for the measurement of platelet function as reported by Ma and coinvestigators in this issue of JAAMP. Ma et al. examined the effect of pravastatin given for 8 to 12 weeks on platelet function and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) in 21 Chinese patients with primary hypercholesterolemia. Platelet function was evaluated by adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced aggregation, thromboxane B2 (TXB2) and the expression of alpha granule membrane protein-140 (GMP-140). GMP-140 is considered one of the most sensitive indicators of the state of platelet function. As expected, pravastatin treatment significantly reduced LDL-C and inhibited ADP-induced platelet aggregation, TXB2 synthesis and the expression of GMP-140--all such parameters can lead to thrombus formation and subsequent cardiovascular events. Using the test methods of Ma et al., additional dose-response studies with several statins and standard antiplatelet drugs are needed to confirm their effects on platelet aggregation, if any. Furthermore, we need to determine whether the antiplatelet effect of the statins, if present, is independent of their hypocholesterolemic action. The additional studies could provide important clues toward the development of new and specific antithrombotic drugs.", 
    "161": "The drugs in the group of the \"statins\" lower blood lipids, especially cholesterol, thereby reducing a risk factor for, and diminishing the incidence of, clinically important cerebrocardiovascular events. Cardiovascular events and stroke are significant causes of morbidity and mortality in China and the United States. Statins reduce platelet-mediated thrombus formation and atherosclerotic progression through mechanisms not completely elucidated. While important, the lipid-lowering action of statins does not completely explain their multifaceted benefits. Nonlipid related mechanisms are essential to such effects. The authors explore these nonlipid related mechanisms of action of pravastatin that may translate into clinically relevant benefits. This study was conducted in Guangzhou, China. Twenty-one hypercholesterolemic patients were treated with pravastatin--10-20 mg/day for 12 weeks. Blood for tests was obtained at baseline and after 8 and 12 weeks of pravastatin therapy. After 8- and 12-weeks of therapy, significant decreases were observed in the following: (1) total blood cholesterol and low density lipoprotein-C (P < 0.01), (2) ADP-induced maximum platelet aggregation (P < 0.01), (3) TXB2 or thromboxane B2 in platelets (P < 0.01), and (4) expression of GMP-140 or granule membrane protein-140 (P < 0.01). The therapeutic effects of the drug did not vary significantly with length of therapy. Pravastatin induces inhibition of platelet aggregation and expression of TXB2 and GMP-140, the likely causes of thrombus formation, atherosclerotic progression, and subsequently cardiovascular events. These potential beneficial events occur within 8 weeks of pravastatin therapy."
