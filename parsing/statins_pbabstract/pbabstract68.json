    "43": "The objectives of this study were to measure the apparent surface acidity of common excipients and to correlate the acidity with the chemical stability of an acid-sensitive active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) in binary API-excipient powder mixtures. The acidity of 26 solid excipients was determined by two methods, (i) by measuring the pH of their suspensions or solutions and (ii) the pH equivalent (pHeq) measured via ionization of probe molecules deposited on the surface of the excipients. The chemical stability of an API, atorvastatin calcium (AC), in mixtures with the excipients was evaluated by monitoring the appearance of an acid-induced degradant, atorvastatin lactone, under accelerated storage conditions. The extent of lactone formation in AC-excipient mixtures was presented as a function of either solution/suspension pH or pHeq. No lactone formation was observed in mixtures with excipients having pHeq > 6, while the lactone levels were pronounced (> 0.6% after 6 weeks at 50\u00b0C/20% RH) with excipients exhibiting pHeq < 3. The three pHeq regions (> 6, 3-6, and < 3) were consistent with the reported solution pH-stability profile of AC. In contrast to the pHeq scale, lactone formation did not show any clear trend when plotted as a function of the suspension/solution pH. Two mechanisms to explain the discrepancy between the suspension/solution pH and the chemical stability data were discussed. Acidic excipients, which are expected to be incompatible with an acid-sensitive API, were identified based on pHeq measurements. The incompatibility prediction was confirmed in the chemical stability tests using AC as an example of an acid-sensitive API.",

Though raised triglycerides and reduced HDL-C, contribute to risk statins, are effective in reducing CVD events in all patients. Extra therapies add little in current trials. Niacin will have little role in the treatment of hyperlipidaemia. Other options in development to lower LDL-C further, raise HDL-C or reduce lipoprotein(a), may have the potential to replace niacin in particular. In contrast, fibrates may continue to have a role in the treatment of extreme hypertriglyceridaemia and in mixed hyperlipidaemia as they reduce CVD events and have additional benefits in improving diabetes and microvascular outcomes.", 
    "54": "To identify new approaches to enhance innate immunity to bacterial pneumonia, we investigated the natural experiment of gender differences in resistance to infections. Female and estrogen-treated male mice show greater resistance to pneumococcal pneumonia, seen as greater bacterial clearance, diminished lung inflammation, and better survival. In vitro, lung macrophages from female mice and humans show better killing of ingested bacteria. Inhibitors and genetically altered mice identify a critical role for estrogen-mediated activation of lung macrophage nitric oxide synthase-3 (NOS3). Epidemiologic data show decreased hospitalization for pneumonia in women receiving estrogen or statins (known to activate NOS3). Pharmacologic targeting of NOS3 with statins or another small-molecule compound (AVE3085) enhanced macrophage bacterial killing, improved bacterial clearance, and increased host survival in both primary and secondary (post-influenza) pneumonia. The data identify a novel mechanism for host defense via NOS3 and suggest a potential therapeutic strategy to reduce secondary bacterial pneumonia after influenza.",

A total of 362 consecutive patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute chest pain suggestive of ACS were evaluated by cardiologists as STEMI, NSTEMI, or unstable angina, and non-ACS. Serum biomarkers measured on admission: troponin I, C-reactive protein (Abbott), and Lp-PLA(2) (DiaDexus). Four groups were defined according to the final diagnosis and history of statin medication: ACS/statin-; ACS/statin+; non-ACS/statin-; non-ACS/statin+. Lp-PLA(2) was highest in ACS/statin- group; statins decreased Lp-PLA(2) both in ACS and non-ACS of about 20 %. Lp-PLA(2) was higher in ACS patients in comparison with non-ACS patients group without respect to statin therapy (p<0.001). Lp-PLA(2) predicted worse outcome (in terms of acute coronary syndrome) effectively in patients up to 62 years; limited prediction was found in older patients. C-reactive protein (CRP) failed to discriminate four groups of patients. Statin therapy and age should be taken into consideration while interpreting Lp-PLA(2) concentrations and lower cut-off values should be used for statin-treated persons.",

In sharp contrast to its insignificant effect on MMP-2, simvastatin down-regulated MMP-9 protein expression and mRNA levels in K562 cells. Simvastatin-induced Pin1 down-regulation evoked NF\u03baB/p65 degradation. Meanwhile, simvastatin induced JNK-mediated c-Jun and ATF-2 activation. Over-expression of Pin1 suppressed simvastatin-induced MMP-9 down-regulation. Treatment with SP600125 (a JNK inhibitor) or knock-down of JNK1 reduced MMP-2 expression in simvastatin-treated cells. Simvastatin enhanced the binding of c-Jun/ATF-2 with the MMP-2 promoter. Down-regulation of c-Jun or ATF-2 by siRNA revealed that c-Jun/ATF-2 activation was crucial for MMP-2 expression. Suppression of p65 activation or knock-down of Pin1 by shRNA reduced MMP-2 and MMP-9 expression in K562 cells. Over-expression of constitutively active JNK1 rescued MMP-2 expression in Pin1 shRNA-transfected cells. Simvastatin treatment also suppressed MMP-9 but not MMP-2 expression in human leukemia U937 and KU812 cells. Taken together, our data indicate that simvastatin-induced p65 instability leads to MMP-9 down-regulation in leukemia cells, while simvastatin-induced JNK1/c-Jun/ATF-2 activation maintains the MMP-2 expression underlying p65 down-regulation.",

There is, however, substantial inter-individual variation in the magnitude of statin-induced LDLC reduction. To date, analysis of individual DNA sequence variants has explained only a small proportion of this variability. The present study was aimed at assessing whether transcriptomic analyses could be used to identify additional genetic contributions to inter-individual differences in statin efficacy.", 
    "58": "Using expression array data from immortalized lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from 372 participants of the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics clinical trial, we identify 100 signature genes differentiating high versus low statin responders. A radial-basis support vector machine prediction model of these signature genes explains 12.3% of the variance in statin-mediated LDLC change. Addition of SNPs either associated with expression levels of the signature genes (eQTLs) or previously reported to be associated with statin response in genome-wide association studies results in a combined model that predicts 15.0% of the variance. Notably, a model of the signature gene associated eQTLs alone explains up to 17.2% of the variance in the tails of a separate subset of the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics population. Furthermore, using a support vector machine classification model, we classify the most extreme 15% of high and low responders with high accuracy.",

    "60": "The aims of this study were to investigate the clinical outcomes of patients with low-gradient aortic stenosis despite preserved left ventricular ejection fraction and to assess reliable prognostic clinical-instrumental features in patients experiencing or not experiencing aortic valve replacement (AVR). Clinical-laboratory and echocardiographic data from 167 patients (median age 78 years, interquartile range 69 to 83) with aortic valve areas <1.0 cm(2), mean gradients \u226430 mm Hg, and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction (\u226555%), enrolled from 2005 to 2010, were analyzed. During a mean follow-up period of 44 \u00b1 23 months, 33% of patients died. On multivariate analysis, independent predictors of death were baseline New York Heart Association functional class III or IV (hazard ratio 2.16, p = 0.038) and atrial fibrillation (hazard ratio 2.00, p = 0.025). Conversely, AVR was protective (hazard ratio 0.25, p = 0.01). The magnitude of the protective effect of AVR seemed to be relatively more important in patients with atrial fibrillation than in those in sinus rhythm, independently of the severity of symptoms. Age >70 years showed a trend toward being a prognostic predictor (p = 0.082). In conclusion, in patients with low-gradient aortic stenosis despite a preserved left ventricular ejection fraction, AVR was strongly correlated with a better prognosis.

Patients of the third Tertile had also higher levels of white blood cells, higher triglycerides and lower HDL-cholesterol and higher percentage of dilated cardiomyopathy/valvular disease as indication for angiography and consequently a lower prevalence of PCI. Patients with higher SUA were more often on therapy with ACE inhibitors and diuretics, but less often with statins, nitrate, ASA and Clopidogrel at admission.

The plasma MMP-9 levels were detected before and at 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, and 72 hours after intravenous thrombolysis. The clinical outcome of stroke was measured in terms of the functional outcome and occurrence of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage. The MMP-9 levels increased after thrombolysis in statin group and control group. No significant intergroup difference was found in the MMP-9 levels before and at 6 hours after thrombolysis, but the levels were significantly lower in the statin group than in the control group at 12, 24, and 72 hours (P < .001) after thrombolysis. Similarly, no significant intergroup difference was noted in the occurrence of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage as was the case with the modified Rankin scale (assessed by the Mann-Whitney U test) at 7 days (P = .428) and 90 days (P = .419) after thrombolysis. Our results indicate that pretreatment with statin can inhibit the thrombolysis-induced increase in plasma MMP-9 levels but does not significantly affect the prognosis of acute ischemic stroke patients undergoing intravenous thrombolysis.",

These studies have built on previous smaller scale evidence, providing improved statistical power and enhanced ability to explore the genome. Current evidence suggests that common genetic variants do not alter low-density lipoprotein cholesterol response by more than a few percent, or materially alter the effect of statin on vascular risk reduction, and therefore that patients benefit from statins independent of common genetic variation. However, knowledge of SLCO1B1 genotypes is believed to have clinical utility for predicting myopathy risk and ensuring that statins are prescribed as safely as possible. Furthermore, new hypothesis-generating studies, such as those associating GATM with myopathy risk, offer potential insights for the future.",

Although they are considered to be drugs with a very good safety profile, because of their wide use there are many concerns that their adverse effects might compromise their proven beneficial effects. Therefore this article reviews all the data and provides an evidence- based insight what are the proven adverse effects of statins and what are the \"myths\" about them. The most important side effects include myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Another side effect is increased activity of liver tests which occurs occasionally and is reversible. However, recent studies even suggest that statin therapy can improve hepatic steatosis. It is beyond any doubt that statins do slightly increase the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in people with two or more components of metabolic syndrome but the cardiovascular benefits of such a treatment by far exceed this risk. Statin therapy has also been associated with some adverse renal effects, eg. acute renal failure, but recent data suggest even a possible protective effect of these drugs on renal dysfunction. Concerns that statins might increase cancer have not been proven. On the contrary, several studies have indicated a possible benefit of these drugs in patients with different types of cancer. Early concerns about cognitive dysfunction and memory loss associated with statins use could not be proven and most recent data even suggest a possible beneficial effect of statins in the prevention of dementia. Systematic reviews and clinical guidelines suggest that the cardiovascular benefits of statins by far out-weight non-cardiovascular harms in patients with cardiovascular risk.",

Available data about interactions between green tea and cardiovascular drugs in humans, updated in this review, are limited so far to warfarin, simvastatin and nadolol, and suggest that the average effects are mild to modest. Nevertheless, in cases of unexpected drug response or intolerance, it is warranted to consider a possible green tea-drug interaction, especially in people who assume large volumes of green tea and/or catechin-enriched products with the conviction that \"more-is-better\".",

    "94": "Ab-independent effector functions of B cells, such as Ag presentation and cytokine production, have been shown to play an important role in a variety of immune-mediated conditions such as autoimmune diseases, transplant rejection, and graft-versus-host disease. Most current immunosuppressive treatments target T cells, are relatively unspecific, and result in profound immunosuppression that places patients at an increased risk of developing severe infections and cancer. Therapeutic strategies, which interfere with B cell activation, could therefore be a useful addition to the current immunosuppressive armamentarium. Using a transcriptomic approach, we identified upregulation of genes that belong to the mevalonate pathway as a key molecular event following CD40-mediated activation of B cells. Inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway, by lipophilic statins such as simvastatin and atorvastatin resulted in a specific inhibition of B cell activation via CD40 and impaired their ability to act as stimulatory APCs for allospecific T cells. Mechanistically, the inhibitory effect resulted from the inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation subsequent to the depletion of mevalonate, the metabolic precursor for geranylgeranyl. Thus, inhibition of geranylgeranylation either directly through geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitors or indirectly through statins represents a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of diseases in which Ag presentation by B cells plays a role.",

In the present study, we investigated the effect of atorvastatin on TNF-\u03b1 release and keratinocyte proliferation in vitro and in acute and chronic 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) induced skin inflammation in vivo. Atorvastatin significantly inhibited lipopolysacharide induced TNF-\u03b1 release in THP-1 cells and keratinocyte proliferation in HaCaT cells. In an acute study, topical atorvastatin showed dose dependent reduction in TPA induced skin inflammation with highest efficacy observed at 500 \u00b5g/ear dose. In chronic study, topical atorvastatin significantly reduced TPA induced ear thickness, ear weight, cutaneous cytokines, MPO activity and improved histopathological features comparable to that of dexamethasone. Atorvastatin also inhibited TPA stimulated NF-\u03baB activation in mouse ear. In conclusion, our results suggest that atorvastatin ameliorates TPA induced skin inflammation in mice at least in part, due to inhibition of cytokine release and NF-\u03baB activation and may be beneficial for the treatment skin inflammation like psoriasis.",

The whole series of compounds 4-7 greatly and significantly reduced elevated serum levels of total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides, with series 6 and 7 showing the greatest potency ever found in our laboratory.

Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing short-term high-dose atorvastatin with low-dose atorvastatin on CI-AKI were selected. The main outcomes were the change of acute kidney injury markers and the incidence of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). We combined 14 RCTs consisting of 1,689 patients. Compared with the low-dose atorvastatin, high-dose atorvastatin treatment was associated with a reduction in serum creatinine levels (weighted mean differences [WMD]-0.1\u2009mg/dL; 95%CI -0.14 to -0.05). In addition, high-dose atorvastatin treatment was also associated with a lower incidence of CIN (risk ratios 0.41; 95%CI 0.29-0.56).

The mechanisms responsible are not known but could involve anti-inflammatory or anti-thrombotic effects. Compelling evidence from experimental models and clinical studies suggests that the interplay between inflammatory and thrombotic systems, typified by platelet-monocyte and platelet-neutrophil interactions, might be a key regulator of ischemic vascular events. The study sought to determine if early, high-dose administration of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor rosuvastatin in the setting of ACS exerts beneficial vascular effects by reducing, and inhibiting biomarkers of thromboinflammation, such as platelet-monocyte and platelet-neutrophil interactions, and biomarkers of myocardial necrosis. A total of 54 patients presenting with ACS within 8 h of symptom onset were randomized to rosuvastatin 40 mg or placebo. Rosuvastatin significantly reduced interactions between platelets and circulating neutrophils (P = 0.015) and monocytes (P = 0.009) within 24 h. No significant effects were observed on platelet aggregation or plasma levels of PF4, sP-selectin, or sCD40L, whereas significant reductions of RANTES occurred over time in both treatment groups. Plasma levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO) declined more rapidly with rosuvastatin therapy than placebo. In a subset of patients with normal cardiac necrosis biomarkers at randomization, rosuvastatin therapy was associated with less myocardial damage as measured by troponin-I or CK-MB. Early administration of high-dose statin therapy in patients with ACS appears to improve biomarkers of inflammation within 8 h, which may translate into fewer ischemic events.",

A central composite design after a full factorial design was utilised to examine the different UAE parameters. The studies revealed that HAc%, extraction time and EtOH% had significant influences on the recovery yield of monacolins, while HAc% and EtOH% were key factors for the elimination of citrinin. The resulting optimal conditions were as follows: ultrasound power of 250 W, HAc% of 7.7%, RYR amount of 0.2 g (solvent-to-solid ratio 40 mL/g), extraction time of 50.7 min, EtOH% of 57.2% and extraction temperature of 20 \u00b0C. Under these conditions, at least 94.7% of monacolins was recovered and 87.7% of citrinin was removed from RYR. This optimised UAE condition was further evaluated for potential industrial application in manufacturing of RYR as pharmaceuticals and nutraceuticals.", 
    "112": "The rapid rise in obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes is one of the major healthcare problems of the Western world. Affected individuals are often treated with statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl co-enzyme A [HMG CoA] reductase inhibitors) to reduce circulating cholesterol levels and the risk of developing cardiovascular disease; given the evolving demographic profile of these conditions, such drugs are increasingly prescribed to women of reproductive age. We have previously shown that exposure of placental tissue to statins inhibits the action of insulin-like growth factors (IGF)-I and -II which are key regulators of trophoblast proliferation and placental development. N-linked glycans in the IGF receptor, IGF1R, influence its presentation at the cell surface. This study aimed to determine whether statins, which are known to affect N-glycosylation, modulate IGF1R function in placenta. Treatment of first trimester villous tissue explants with statins (pravastatin or cerivastatin) or inhibitors of N-glycosylation (tunicamycin, deoxymannojirimycin or castanospermine) altered receptor distribution in trophoblast and attenuated proliferation induced by IGF-I or IGF-II (Ki67; P < 0.05, n = 5). Decreased binding of Phaseolus vulgaris lectin and phytohaemagglutinin to IGF1R immunoprecipitated from treated explants demonstrated reduced levels of complex N-linked glycans. Co-incubation of tissue explants with statins and farnesyl pyrophosphate (which increases the supply of dolichol intermediates), prevented statin-mediated disruption of IGF1R localization and reversed the negative effect on IGF-mediated trophoblast proliferation. These data suggest that statins attenuate IGF actions in the placenta by inhibiting N-linked glycosylation and subsequent expression of mature IGF1R at the placental cell surface.",

Male New Zealand white rabbits were randomized into three groups, including the myocardial infarction group (12 rabbits), the simvastatin treatment group (15 rabbits), and the sham group (12 rabbits). In the simvastatin treatment and myocardial infarction groups, the rabbits received myocardial infarction surgeries. While in the sham group, loose knots were tied in the left anterior descending coronary artery branches. The simvastatin treatment group was given simvastatin by oral gavage 24\u00a0h after surgery. Parameters, which included left ventricular end-diastolic diameter, left ventricular end-systolic diameter, left ventricular ejection fraction, and left ventricular mass index, were recorded in these three groups. Edge myocardial infarction and myocardial cell apoptosis were analyzed using TUNEL assay, and Bcl-2, Bax, and Caspase-3 protein levels were detected by Western blot. Acute myocardial infarction model was successfully established in rabbits by ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery. Compared with the myocardial infarction group, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD) and left ventricular end systolic diameter (LVESD) were significantly reduced and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) increased in the simvastatin treatment group. Compared with the sham group, LVEDD and LVESD were significantly increased and LVEF decreased in the simvastatin treatment group. All the differences were statistically significant (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Left ventricular mass index in the simvastatin treatment group was statistically lower than the myocardial infarction group. Compared with the sham group, left ventricular mass index in both the simvastatin treatment and myocardial infarction groups was significantly increased. The differences of the above comparisons were statistically significant (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Compared with the sham group, the apoptosis rate of the myocardial infarction group and the simvastatin treatment groups was significantly increased as shown by TUNEL assay, however, the apoptosis rate of the simvastatin treatment group was significantly lower than that of the myocardial infarction group. All the differences among above comparisons were statistically significant (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05). Bcl-2 levels significantly increased in the simvastatin treatment group compared with the myocardial infarction group, but Bcl-2 levels in both groups were significantly lower than the sham group. However, Bax protein levels showed inverse expression with Bcl-2. Meanwhile, Caspase-3 protein expression showed similar trend with Bcl-2. Simvastatin can improve cardiac function after myocardial infarction and reduce apoptosis of myocardial cells, possibly by decreasing Bax and Caspase-3 expression and increasing the expression level of Bcl-2.",

A total of 40 individuals of hypercholesteremia group were studied, compared with 40 individuals of normal control group. Protein levels and gene expression levels of alpha-defensins 1, 2 and 3 were significantly higher in patients with hypercholesteremia compared with subjects in normal control group. In patients with hypercholesteremia, protein levels of alpha-defensins 1, 2 and 3 correlated positively with the levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Protein levels and gene expression levels of alpha-defensins 1, 2 and 3 were decreased significantly after a treatment with atorvastatin calcium 20mg daily compared with the patients before the treatment.

Selective mechanisms exist for their intestinal uptake and tissue-selective distribution, but these are poorly understood. We investigated the role of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), apolipoprotein (apo) A1 and ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC) A1 in intestinal uptake of lutein in a human polarized intestinal cell culture and a hamster model. Animals received dietary lutein and zeaxanthin and either a liver X receptor (LXR) agonist or statin, which up- or down-regulate intestinal ABCA1 expression, respectively. The role of HDL was studied following treatment with the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) modulator dalcetrapib or the CETP inhibitor anacetrapib. In vitro, intestinal ABCA1 at the basolateral surface of enterocytes transferred lutein and zeaxanthin to apoA1, not to mature HDL. In hamsters, plasma lutein and zeaxanthin levels were markedly increased with the LXR agonist and decreased with simvastatin. Dalcetrapib, but not anacetrapib, increased plasma and liver lutein and zeaxanthin levels. ABCA1 expression and apoA1 acceptor activity are important initial steps in intestinal uptake and maintenance of lutein and zeaxanthin levels by an HDL-dependent pathway. Their absorption may be improved by physiological and pharmacological interventions affecting HDL metabolism.",

Important mechanisms for skeletal muscle toxicity include mitochondrial impairment and increased expression of atrogin-1. The aim was to study the mechanisms of toxicity of simvastatin on H9c2 cells (a rodent cardiomyocyte cell line) and on the heart of male C57BL/6 mice. After, exposure to 10\u00a0\u03bcmol/L simvastatin for 24\u00a0h, H9c2 cells showed impaired oxygen consumption, a reduction in the mitochondrial membrane potential and a decreased activity of several enzyme complexes of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC). The cellular ATP level was also decreased, which was associated with phosphorylation of AMPK, dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of FoxO3a as well as increased mRNA expression of atrogin-1. Markers of apoptosis were increased in simvastatin-treated H9c2 cells. Treatment of mice with 5\u00a0mg/kg/day simvastatin for 21\u00a0days was associated with a 5\u00a0% drop in heart weight as well as impaired activity of several enzyme complexes of the ETC and increased mRNA expression of atrogin-1 and of markers of apoptosis in cardiac tissue. Cardiomyocytes exposed to simvastatin in vitro or in vivo sustain mitochondrial damage, which causes AMPK activation, dephosphorylation and nuclear transformation of FoxO3a as well as increased expression of atrogin-1. Mitochondrial damage and increased atrogin-1 expression are associated with apoptosis and increased protein breakdown, which may cause myocardial atrophy.",

    "149": "Lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease: each 1.0\u00a0mmol/L (38.7\u00a0mg/dL) reduction in LDL-C reduces the incidence of major coronary events, coronary revascularizations, and ischemic stroke by approximately 20%. Statins are a well-established treatment option for dyslipidemia, with LDL-C reduction in the range of 27-55%. Several lipid goal-driven guidelines recommend reducing LDL-C to <2.59\u00a0mmol/L (100\u00a0mg/dL) or <1.81\u00a0mmol/L (70\u00a0mg/dL) in very high-risk patients. Many patients treated with statins do not reach these goals, and remain at risk of future cardiovascular events. The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines move away from advocating LDL-C treatment targets with focus placed on identifying patients most likely to benefit from high-intensity or moderate-intensity statin therapy. While increasing the statin dose can prove efficacious in some patients, this approach typically offers limited additional LDL-C lowering, and is associated with increased incidence of adverse side effects. Indeed, this has led to the investigation of statins in combination with other lipid-modifying agents for the treatment of dyslipidemia. This review of the evidence for statin use in combination with fibrates, niacin, bile acid sequestrants, and the cholesterol absorption inhibitor, ezetimibe, in dyslipidemic patients at increased risk of cardiovascular disease, explores the impact of such combination therapies on lipids, attainment of lipid targets, inflammatory markers, and on cardiovascular outcomes and pathology. Additionally, new and emerging dyslipidemia treatments are summarized.",

We sought to determine whether eligibility for statin therapy as determined by the 2013 ACC/AHA guideline recommendation is better aligned with the actual presence of coronary artery disease (CAD) as detected by coronary CT angiography (CCTA) when compared to prior guidelines including the 2004 NCEP ATP III and 2011 ESC/EAS guidelines. In this secondary analysis of the prospective observational ROMICAT I (Rule Out Myocardial Infarction with Computer Assisted Tomography) cohort study, we included all men and women aged 40-79 years presenting with acute chest pain but not diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome nor on admission statin. Based on risk factor assessment and lipid data, we determined guideline-based eligibility for statin therapy by the 2013 ACC/AHA, the 2004 NCEP ATP III, and the 2011 ESC/EAS guidelines. We determined the presence and severity of CAD as detected by CCTA. The 2013 ACC/AHA algorithm identified nearly twice as many individuals as eligible for statins (n = 77/189; 41%) as compared to the 2004 ATP III criteria: (n = 41/189; 22%), (p < .0001) In addition, the 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines were more sensitive for treatment of CCTA-detected CAD than the 2004 ATP III guidelines [53.4% (42.5-64.1) vs 27.3% (18.3-37.8), p < .001] and the 2011 ESC/EAE guidelines [53.4% (42.5-64.1) vs 34.1% (24.3-45.0), p < .001]. However, the specificity of these guidelines was modestly reduced compared to the 2004 ATP III guidelines [70.3 (60.4-79.0) vs 83.2 (74.4-89.9), p < .001] and the 2011 ESC/EAE guidelines [70.3 (60.4-79.0) vs 86.1 (77.8-92.2), p < .001], suggesting increased treatment of subjects without CCTA-detected CAD. Overall, the 2013 ACC/AHA guidelines are more sensitive to identify patients who have CAD detected by CCTA eligible for statin therapy as compared with prior guidelines, with an acceptable trade-off in specificity for recommending statin therapy in those without CAD.",

Seven-year clinical outcomes of patients with the gray-zone FFR were good. Furthermore, FFR-measured artery-related events in patients with the gray-zone FFR tended to occur less frequently than in patients with better FFR of 0.81-0.85.

Previous experimental findings indicate that a combination of lipophilic statins with phosphodiesterase type-5 inhibitor, sildenafil, can offer preventive effects on rat monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension. The present study is aimed to assess whether therapeutic regimen provides any benefits. Seven days after pulmonary hypertension induction, hydrophilic rosuvastatin and sildenafil were given for 14 days to male Wistar outbred rats. Right ventricular pressure, right ventricle mass and three biomarkers were evaluated after 21 days: brain natriuretic peptide, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and vascular endothelial growth factor. The present study demonstrates that administration of hydrophilic statin with sildenafil results in reduction of pulmonary vascular remodeling and right ventricular pressure. The results of biochemical measurements may suggest that statins play a positive role in right ventricle function or the process of angiogenesis in pulmonary hypertension development.",

In this study we mechanistically monitored the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, amount of cytosolic cytochrome c and caspase 3 activity after treatment by lovastatin and gamma-tocopherol. HT29 cells were treated with different doses of lovastatin and gamma-tocopherol for 48 and 72\u00a0h. Lovastatin and gamma-tocopherol in combination induced the release of cytochrome c, caspase 3 activation, and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential more significantly compared to their controls. Our data showed that lovastatin plus gamma tocopherol potently induced mitochondrial membrane potential collapse, cytochrome c release along with caspase 3 activation that reveals the importance of targeting programmed cell death signaling at different points of its signaling pathway for cancer therapy.",

Thus, patients have been converted to non-CNI immunosuppressives despite the lack of evidence of long-term benefits from CNI free therapy. We now report our 10-year experience converting patients with well functioning transplants from CNI to sirolimus. We retrospectively analyzed outcomes of patients receiving continuous CNI based therapy (CNI, n\u2009=\u2009309) or who were switched to sirolimus within the first year of post-transplantation (CONV, n\u2009=\u200954). The groups were similar for most recipient, graft and donor characteristics, however, diabetes was more common in the CNI group and statin use was more frequent in the CONV group. The average time to conversion was 7.2 months and the creatinine level at the time of switching was 1.4\u2009mg/dl. Ten year graft and patient survival rates were equivalent in both groups. There were no differences in the causes of death or graft loss in both groups. Renal function was available for 5 years posttransplant and was no different between groups. Thus, there is no evidence that routinely switching patients with well functioning renal allografts to sirolimus from CNI based immunosuppression provides long-term benefit.",

High-cholesterol diet and oral administrations of simvastatin were used to modulate serum cholesterol in mice. These treatments only modestly affected cholesterol content in the retina and had no significant effect on retinal expression of the major cholesterol- and vision-related genes; the sterol-regulatory element binding protein pathway of transcriptional regulation does not seem to be operative in the retina under the experimental conditions used. Evidence is obtained that posttranslational mechanisms play a role in the control of retinal cholesterol. Retinal genes were only upregulated by oral administrations of TO901317 activating liver X receptors. Three of the upregulated genes could be of particular importance (apoD, Idol, and Rpe65) and have not yet been considered in the context of cholesterol homeostasis in the retina. Collectively, the data obtained identify specific features of retinal cholesterol maintenance and suggest additional therapies for age-related macular degeneration, a blinding disease characterized by cholesterol and lipid accumulations in chorioretinal tissues.",

Apart from their well-established therapeutic value in cardiovascular disease, there is a long-standing debate on their potential association with cancer. To obtain and discuss the existing clinical evidence, an overview of meta-analysis articles addressing this issue was carried out. As of today, the accumulated evidence does not support the hypothesis that statins affect the risk of developing cancer, when they are taken at low doses for managing hypercholesterolaemia. However, current data cannot exclude an increased cancer risk in elderly patients associated with hydrophilic statin use, or decreases in the risks of certain cancers, such as gastric, oesophageal, liver, colorectal and advanced/aggressive prostate cancer. On the other hand, some recent observational studies have provided evidence that statins might be useful in modifying the prognosis of patients diagnosed with malignancy. Until a definitive benefit is demonstrated in randomized controlled trials, statins cannot be recommended either for cancer prevention or for modifying cancer-related outcomes. Further research is warranted to clarify the potential role(s) of statins in the prevention and treatment of cancer.",

    "219": "In patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia, evolocumab administered either 140 mg every 2 weeks or 420 mg monthly was well tolerated and yielded similar and rapid 60% reductions in LDL cholesterol compared with placebo.",

    "221": "Guidelines now recommend high-intensity statin therapy in all patients with proven atherosclerotic disease. Yet the impact of baseline lipoprotein and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels on measures of disease regression to this therapy are unknown. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that high-intensity statin therapy causes equivalent degrees of coronary atheroma regression irrespective of baseline lipoprotein and CRP levels. In 8 prospective randomized trials using serial coronary intravascular ultrasound, 1,881 patients who maintained or switched to 18- to 24 months of high-intensity statin therapy (rosuvastatin 40 mg or atorvastatin 80 mg) were stratified according to baseline lipoprotein and CRP levels. Changes in coronary percentage atheroma volume (PAV) and total atheroma volume (TAV) were evaluated. High-intensity statin therapy produced significant reductions from baseline in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 38.4%, non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by 33.6%, triglycerides by 13.1%, and CRP by 33.3%, while increasing HDL cholesterol by 11.7% (p <0.001 for all). This was associated with regression of PAV by 0.7% and of TAV by 8.2 mm(3) (p <0.001 for both). No significant differences of changes in PAV and TAV were observed across baseline quintiles of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, or CRP. Moreover, across all measured lipoproteins and CRP, most patients demonstrated plaque regression (defined as any change from baseline in PAV or TAV <0). In conclusion, high-intensity statin therapy attenuated the natural progression of coronary atherosclerosis in all strata of patients with coronary artery disease irrespective of baseline lipoprotein or CRP levels. These findings provide support for the latest United States guideline recommendations for the broad use of high-intensity statin therapy in all patients with atherosclerosis, regardless of baseline lipid status.", 
    "222": "Asthma is a complex syndrome that affects an estimated 26 million people in the United States but gaps exist in the recognition and management of asthmatic subgroups. This article proposes alternative approaches for future treatments of adult obese asthmatics who do not respond to standard controller therapies, drawing parallels between seemingly disparate therapeutics through their common signaling pathways. How metformin and statins can potentially improve airway inflammation is described and supplements are suggested. A move toward more targeted therapies for asthma subgroups is needed. These therapies address asthma and the comorbidities that accompany obesity and metabolic syndrome to provide the greatest therapeutic potential.", 
    "223": "Multiple studies have determined that obesity increases asthma risk or severity. Metabolic changes of obesity, such as diabetes or insulin resistance, are associated with asthma and poorer lung function. Insulin resistance is also found to increase asthma risk independent of body mass. Conversely, asthma is associated with abnormal glucose and lipid metabolism, insulin resistance, and obesity. Here we review our current understanding of how dietary and lifestyle factors lead to changes in mitochondrial metabolism and cellular bioenergetics, inducing various components of the cardiometabolic syndrome and airway disease.", 
    "224": "The concomitant increase in obesity and asthma in recent years has led to the classification of two obese-asthma phenotypes, characterized by the age of asthma onset and atopy. Asthma tends to be more severe, harder to control, and more resistant to standard medications among members of these two groups. Because of the limited effectiveness of inhaled corticosteroids, dietary changes and weight loss measures must be considered in the management of these patients. Furthermore, comorbidities such as depression and obstructive sleep apnea must be addressed to provide optimal care for this group of difficult-to-control asthmatics.", 
    "225": "The biochemical pathway to hypericin biosynthesis is presumed to be polyketide synthase (PKS) mediated, but it has not been experimentally validated, and no alternate route (chorismate/o-succinylbenzoate pathway) has been analyzed. We report here our earlier developed auxin inducible culture systems of Hypericum hookerianum as a model, to study the metabolic pathway to hypericin synthesis. Inhibitors of the alternate pathway at varying concentrations showed steady synthesis of total hypericins with means of 2.80\u00b10.22, 18.75\u00b10.01; 16.39\u00b13.75, 29.60\u00b11.90 (mevinolin) 2.53\u00b10.10, 18.12\u00b10.56; 0.14\u00b10.01, 14.28\u00b11.11 (fosmidomycin) and 2.7\u00b10.35, 18.75\u00b10.61; 0.14\u00b10.01, 12.80\u00b11.09 mg g(-1) DW (glyphosate) in the control and auxin-induced shoot and shoot-forming callus cultures, respectively. SSH analysis classified the differentially expressed sequences into protein synthesis (38%), modification (20%), electron transport (9%) and remaining as unclassified (11%) and unknown proteins (22%). Functional annotation of sequences indicates the presence of additional protein components besides PKS activity. Our results demonstrate direct biochemical and molecular evidence of PKS hypothesis of hypericin biosynthesis for the first time.",

    "233": "We included 183 randomised controlled trials of statins, 103 of which were two-armed or multi-armed active comparator trials. When all of the existing randomised evidence was synthesised in network meta-analyses, there were clear differences in the LDL cholesterol lowering effects of individual statins at different doses. In general, higher doses resulted in higher reductions in baseline LDL cholesterol levels. Of a total of 146 industry sponsored trials, 64 were placebo controlled (43.8%). The corresponding number for the non-industry sponsored trials was 16 (43.2%). Of the 35 unique comparisons available in 37 non-industry sponsored trials, 31 were also available in industry sponsored trials. There were no systematic differences in magnitude between the LDL cholesterol lowering effects of individual statins observed in industry sponsored versus non-industry sponsored trials. In industry sponsored trials, the mean change from baseline LDL cholesterol level was on average 1.77 mg/dL (95% credible interval -11.12 to 7.66) lower than the change observed in non-industry sponsored trials. There was no detectable inconsistency in the evidence network.", 
    "234": "Our analysis shows that the findings obtained from industry sponsored statin trials seem similar in magnitude as those in non-industry sources. There are actual differences in the effectiveness of individual statins at various doses that explain previously observed discrepancies between industry and non-industry sponsored trials."
