A systematic review and meta-analysis was performed including randomized controlled trials of short-term high-dose statins (compared with either low-dose statin or placebo) for CIAKI prevention in patients undergoing coronary angiography. Study-specific odds ratios (ORs) were calculated, and between-study heterogeneity was assessed using the I(2) statistic. We used a random-effects model meta-analysis to pool the OR. Twelve RCTs, including 5,564 patients, were included. CIAKI occurred in 94 of 2,769 patients (3.4%) pretreated with high-dose statins and 213 of 2,795 patients (7.6%) in the low-dose or no-statin group (OR 0.43, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.33 to 0.55, I(2)\u00a0= 19%, p\u00a0<0.001). Subgroup analysis showed that the occurrence of CIAKI did not differ in patients with diabetes (OR 0.60, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.85, I(2)\u00a0= 0%, p\u00a0= 0.004) or in patients with documented renal insufficiency (creatinine clearance <60\u00a0ml/min/m(2); OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.96, I(2)\u00a0= 0%, p\u00a0= 0.03). In conclusion, pretreatment with high-dose statins, compared with low-dose statins or placebo, in patients undergoing coronary angiography reduces the incidence of CIAKI. This benefit was seen irrespective of the presence of diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Future studies should identify optimum dosing protocols for each statin.",

Atorvastatin significantly reduced the enhanced platelet adhesion that was induced by cocaine and PFP from chronic cocaine consumers, as well as the release of the von Willebrand factor. Atorvastatin also avoided striking alterations on cell monolayer structure triggered by both stimuli and enhanced NO reduction because of cocaine stimulation through disrupting interactions between endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and caveolin-1, thus increasing eNOS bioavailability. Cocaine-increased tissue factor-dependent procoagulant activity and reactive oxygen species generation were not counteracted by atorvastatin. Although monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 levels were not significantly higher than controls either under cocaine or PFP stimulation, atorvastatin completely avoided monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 release in both conditions.

Among these are the so-called classical cardiovascular risk factors, the disease itself through its activity, treatments, and complications, and the thrombotic risk due to antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). Observational studies suggest that most classical cardiovascular risk factors are observed more frequently in SLE patients than in the general population, and that these are insufficient to explain the increased cardiovascular risk observed in most studies. Given this high risk, adequate management of cardiovascular risk factors should be recommended in SLE patients. Paradoxically, the benefit due to the anti-inflammatory properties of treatments such as corticosteroids may exceed, in certain cases, their pro-atherogenic effect. Importantly, the tools that were developed for the estimation of cardiovascular risk at the individual level among the general population cannot be used reliably in SLE patients, as these tools appear to underestimate the true cardiovascular risk. The adequate indications and targets of cardiovascular treatments are therefore not fully known in SLE. A better understanding of the determinants of the cardiovascular risk in SLE will allow the identification and more tailored management of these high-risk patients.",

Statins do not only improve the lipid profile, but also induce some 'pleiotropic' anti-inflammatory activities that contribute to carotid plaque stabilization. Statin-mediated protective activities are under active investigation at subclinical levels with the potential benefit of advanced imaging techniques. However, considering that some new techniques (excepted B-mode ultrasound) remain quite expensive, they can have for the moment an important role in research, but not in the clinical field.",

The lack of disease models using human cells has hampered the identification of a clinically effective treatment for these diseases. Here we show that statin treatment can rescue patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) models and a mouse model of FGFR3 skeletal dysplasia. We converted fibroblasts from thanatophoric dysplasia type I (TD1) and ACH patients into iPSCs. The chondrogenic differentiation of TD1 iPSCs and ACH iPSCs resulted in the formation of degraded cartilage. We found that statins could correct the degraded cartilage in both chondrogenically differentiated TD1 and ACH iPSCs. Treatment of ACH model mice with statin led to a significant recovery of bone growth. These results suggest that statins could represent a medical treatment for infants and children with TD1 and ACH.", 
    "69": "The clinical spectrum of muscle- and skeletal-related side-effects of statins includes varied myalgias and weakness, an asymptomatic increase in the concentration of creatine kinase and other biochemical parameters, myositis and rhabdomyolysis. Currently, there is no consensus on the definition of 'statin myopathy'. Evidence suggests that deleterious effects may also be associated with the volume or dosage of structured exercise and/or the intensity of physical activity. Moreover, non-muscle adverse effects on the joints and tendons are often overlooked and underemphasized. The incidence of myopathy associated with statin treatment typically ranges between 1.5% and 10%. Few data are available regarding the prevalence of muscle- related symptoms associated with different statins and the distribution of affected muscles. Furthermore, discrepancies between clinical trials and daily practice may emanate, in part, because of inconsistent definitions or exclusion criteria.The pathophysiology of statin-related myopathy is incompletely understood. A dose-dependent and proapoptotic effect, direct effects on mitochondria, drug interactions and genetic factors, or combinations thereof, may be involved. Recently, a rare immune-mediated myopathy triggered by statin use has been described. With the increasing number of patients treated with statins and with more patients being prescribed high doses of potent statins to achieve low-density lipoprotein targets, muscle-related side-effects will become more prevalent. Currently, the only effective treatment is the discontinuation of statin use. Further research is needed to develop alternative LDL-lowering drugs when statins are not well tolerated and to establish additional effective strategies to manage lipids and lipoproteins.",

Intraperitoneal injection to C57BL/6 mice of recombinant PON1 (rePON1)\u2009+\u2009HDL, in comparison to HDL or to rePON1 alone, significantly increased serum PON1 arylesterase activity (by 20%), and serum-mediated cholesterol efflux from J774A.1 macrophages (by 18%). Similarly, in peritoneal macrophages (MPM) harvested from mice injected with HDL\u2009+\u2009rePON1 versus rePON1 alone, we observed reduction in oxidative stress (by 11%), increase in cellular PON1 activity (by 14%) and in HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux (by 38%). Incubation of serum or HDL with rePON1, substantially increased PON1 arylesterase activity, two-fold more than the expected additive values. HDL2 and HDL3 increased PON1 activity by 199% or 274%, respectively. Macrophage (J774A.1) cholesterol efflux rate significantly increased by HDL3\u2009+\u2009rePON1 versus HDL3 alone (by 19%), but not by HDL2\u2009+\u2009rePON1 versus HDL2 alone. Oxidation of HDL3 reduced its ability to induce macrophage cholesterol efflux, and abolished HDL3 stimulatory effects on rePON1. Addition of exogenous polyphenol quercetin (60 \u00b5M), but not phosphatidylcholine or apolipoprotein A1, to HDL\u2009+\u2009rePON1 increased PON1 activity (by 404%), increased the ability to reduce oxidative stress in J774A.1 macrophages (by 53%) and to stimulate macrophage cholesterol efflux (by 14%). Upon adding the hypocholesterolemic drug simvastatin (15 \u00b5g/mL) to HDL\u2009+\u2009rePON1, PON1 activity and the ability to induce macrophage cholesterol efflux increased, in comparison to HDL\u2009+\u2009rePON1. We thus concluded that HDL (mostly HDL3), stimulates PON1 antiatherogenic activities in macrophages, and these PON1 activities were further stimulated by quercetin, or by simvastatin.",

No evidence of publication bias was observed in this meta-analysis. Similar risk reductions were found in the subgroups analysis of Western and Asian countries, lipophilic and hydrophilia statins.

    "90": "Conditioning refers to endogenous mechanisms rendering the myocardium more tolerant against reperfusion injury. Application of brief ischemia-reperfusion cycles prior to the index ischemia has a beneficial effect and limits the infarct size. This is called preconditioning and is mainly mediated by activation of adenosine, bradykinin, opioid and other receptors, with subsequent activation of intracellular mediators leading to mitochondrial protection. A clinical equivalent of preconditioning is preinfarction angina. Benefits for the ischemic and reperfused myocardium are also provided by repetitive short-lived cycles of ischemia-reperfusion applied after the index ischemia. This is termed postconditioning, shares a common pathway with preconditioning, and is more useful and relevant in clinical practice. Finally, benefits are also derived from remote conditioning, i.e. ischemia applied in a remote vascular territory parallel with or immediately after the index myocardial ischemia. Several pharmacological interventions may interfere with these mechanisms leading to enhanced protection of the myocardium and limitation of the infarct size. Despite the huge interest and the great body of evidence that verify the effectiveness of conditioning, clinical application has remained limited due to controversies over the appropriate intervention protocol, but also interference of medication, comorbidities and other factors that may enhance or blur the protective effect.", 
    "91": "Post-transplant dyslipidemia is exacerbated by mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors. Early clinical trials of mTOR inhibitors used fixed dosing with no concomitant reduction in calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) exposure, leading to concerns when consistent and marked dyslipidemia was observed. With use of modern concentration-controlled mTOR inhibitor regimens within CNI-free or reduced-exposure CNI regimens, however, the dyslipidemic effect persists but is less pronounced. Typically, total cholesterol levels are at the upper end of normal, or indicate borderline risk, in kidney and liver transplant recipients, and are lower in heart transplant patients under near-universal statin therapy. Of note, it is possible that mTOR inhibitors may offer a cardioprotective effect. Experimental evidence for delayed progression of atherosclerosis is consistent with evidence from heart transplantation that coronary artery intimal thickening and the incidence of cardiac allograft vasculopathy are reduced with everolimus versus cyclosporine therapy. Preliminary data also indicate that mTOR inhibitors may improve arterial stiffness, a predictor of cardiovascular events, and may reduce ventricular remodeling and decrease left ventricular mass through an anti-fibrotic effect. Post-transplant dyslipidemia under mTOR inhibitor therapy should be monitored and managed closely, but unless unresponsive to therapy should not be regarded as a barrier to its use.",

Harms from statin drugs are not increased in older patients, so the use of these agents for primary prevention is possible. Because people older than 80 years are biologically heterogeneous with varying life expectancy, may have frailty or comorbid conditions, and may take multiple medications, the decision to treat with statins must be individualized.",

A multifactorial approach is required for CIN prevention including hydration, administration of low- or iso-osmolar CM, minimizing CM volume, and statin administration. Renal function may deteriorate after CM administration, even in the absence of CIN. Therefore, this deterioration may not be an \"all or none\" phenomenon; it may well occur in many patients receiving CM, with/without CIN, and may prove to be an underestimated risk factor.

Moreover, coronary artery disease remains the most common cause of death. Statins are effective lipid-lowering agents, associated with a lowering the risk of cardiovascular events in several interventional randomized clinical trials. However, statins are often underused in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and many physicians are concerned about the prescription of statins to patients with unexplained persistent elevation of liver enzymes or active liver disease. Based on currently available data, statin therapy, at low-to-moderate doses, seems to be safe and has low liver toxicity. Treatment of dyslipidaemia in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is recommended and may also improve liver function tests. In these patients, the risks of not taking statins could outweigh the risks of taking the drug.

Here we used amniotic fluid stem (AFS) cells and focused on the mechanisms occurring during early steps of differentiation along the Schwann cell lineage. Therefore, we initiated Schwann cell differentiation in AFS cells and monitored as well as modulated the activity of the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, the major regulator of anabolic processes. Our results show that mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) activity is essential for glial marker expression and expression of Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Protein (SREBP) target genes. Moreover, SREBP target gene activation by statin treatment promoted lipogenic gene expression, induced mTORC1 activation and stimulated Schwann cell differentiation. To investigate mTORC1 downstream signaling we expressed a mutant S6K1, which subsequently induced the expression of the Schwann cell marker S100b, but did not affect lipogenic gene expression. This suggests that S6K1 dependent and independent pathways downstream of mTORC1 drive AFS cells to early Schwann cell differentiation and lipogenic gene expression. In conclusion our results propose that future strategies for peripheral nervous system regeneration will depend on ways to efficiently induce the mTORC1 pathway.",

However, many patients (up to 25%) cannot tolerate or discontinue statin therapy due to statin-induced myopathy (SIM). Patients will continue to experience SIM at unacceptably high rates or experience unnecessary cardiovascular events (as a result of discontinuing or decreasing their statin therapy) until strategies for predicting or mitigating SIM are identified. A promising strategy for predicting or mitigating SIM is pharmacogenetic testing, particularly of pharmacokinetic genetic variants as SIM is related to statin exposure. Data is emerging on the association between pharmacokinetic genetic variants and SIM. A current, critical evaluation of the literature on pharmacokinetic genetic variants and SIM for potential translation to clinical practice is lacking. This review focuses specifically on pharmacokinetic genetic variants and their association with SIM clinical outcomes. We also discuss future directions, specific to the research on pharmacokinetic genetic variants, which could speed the translation into clinical practice. For simvastatin, we did not find sufficient evidence to support the clinical translation of pharmacokinetic genetic variants other than SLCO1B1. However, SLCO1B1 may also be clinically relevant for pravastatin- and pitavastatin-induced myopathy, but additional studies assessing SIM clinical outcome are needed. CYP2D6*4 may be clinically relevant for atorvastatin-induced myopathy, but mechanistic studies are needed. Future research efforts need to incorporate statin-specific analyses, multi-variant analyses, and a standard definition of SIM. As the use of statins is extremely common and SIM continues to occur in a significant number of patients, future research investments in pharmacokinetic genetic variants have the potential to make a profound impact on public health.",

Apolipoprotein B (apoB), an important structural component of LDL, plays a key role in cholesterol transport and removal in vascular wall. On the other hand, under pathological process, apoB interacts with the arterial wall to initiate the cascade of events that leads to atherosclerosis. However, interactions between apoB and vascular wall remain to be determined. Here, we address a pathological role of apoB per se and whole LDL particle in dysfunction of vascular endothelium and smooth muscle cells i.e. decreased endothelium-dependent vasodilation and increased receptor-mediated vasoconstriction. We intend to discuss: i) how apoB is responsible for the deleterious effects of LDL in the development of ischemic cardiovascular disease; ii) why vaccine based on peptides derived from apoB-100 is a promising therapy for treating ischemic cardiovascular disease, and iii) direct inhibition of apoB production should be a better therapeutic option than simple LDL-cholesterol lowering therapy in the patients with severe hypercholesterolemia at high cardiovascular risk with statin intolerance. In conclusion, apoB, but not cholesterol, plays a major role in LDL-induced dysfunction of endothelium, suggesting that direct apoB-targeting agents might be a promising therapy for the treatment of ischemic cardiovascular disease.",

Besides, statins have other beneficial effects, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. We evaluated whether atorvastatin, a widely used statin, can ameliorate arsenic-induced increase in blood pressure and alteration in lipid profile and also whether the amelioration could relate to altered NO and ROS signaling. Rats were exposed to sodium arsenite (100ppm) through drinking water for 90 consecutive days. Atorvastatin (10mg/kg bw, orally) was administered once daily during the last 30days of arsenic exposure. On the 91st day, blood was collected for lipid profile. Western blot of iNOS and eNOS protein, NO and 3-nitrotyrosine production, Nox-4 and p22Phox mRNA expression, Nox activity, ROS generation, lipid peroxidation and antioxidants were evaluated in thoracic aorta. Arsenic increased systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure, while it decreased HDL-C and increased LDL-C, total cholesterol and triglycerides in serum. Arsenic down-regulated eNOS and up-regulated iNOS protein expression and increased basal NO and 3-nitrotyrosine level. Arsenic increased aortic Nox-4 and p22Phox mRNA expression, Nox activity, ROS generation and lipid peroxidation. Further, arsenic decreased the activities of superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase and depleted aortic GSH content. Atorvastatin regularized blood pressure, improved lipid profile and attenuated arsenic-mediated redox alterations. The results demonstrate that atorvastatin has the potential to ameliorate arsenic-induced hypertension by improving lipid profile, aortic NO signaling and restoring vascular redox homeostasis.",

At 6 - 9-month follow-up, the proportion using these medications had dropped by 8.9% for aspirin, 10.1% for statins, 6.2% for beta-blockers and 17.9% for ACEIs/ARBs. Only 47.2% remained on all four drugs, a reduction of 23.5%. Of the 56.0% of patients who were smokers, 31.4% had stopped smoking.", 
    "196": "A significant decline in adherence to recommended therapy 6 - 9 months after discharge and a poor rate of smoking cessation suggest that efforts to educate patients about the importance of long-term adherence need to be improved.

Identifying therapies to prevent the development of these pathologic processes will likely have a positive impact on clinical outcomes. Simvastatin is a drug with demonstrated anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects in many tissues but had not previously been studied in the context of rotator cuff tears. We hypothesized that after the induction of a massive supraspinatus tear, simvastatin would protect muscles from a loss of force production and fibrosis.",

This study not only evaluated the therapeutic potential and inhibitory mechanism of simvastatin in an ovalbumin (OVA)-specific asthma model in mice but also sought to clarify the future directions indicated by previous studies through a thorough review of the literature. BALB/c mice were sensitized to OVA and then administered three OVA challenges. On each challenge day, 40\u2009mg\u2009kg(-1) simvastatin was injected before the challenge. The airway responsiveness, inflammatory cell composition, and cytokine levels in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid were assessed after the final challenge, and the T cell composition and adhesion molecule expression in lung homogenates were determined. The administration of simvastatin decreased the airway responsiveness, the number of airway inflammatory cells, and the interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5 and IL-13 concentrations in BAL fluid compared with vehicle-treated mice (P<0.05). Histologically, the number of inflammatory cells and mucus-containing goblet cells in lung tissues also decreased in the simvastatin-treated mice. Flow cytometry showed that simvastatin treatment significantly reduced the percentage of pulmonary CD4(+) cells and the CD4(+)/CD8(+) T-cell ratio (P<0.05). Simvastatin treatment also decreased the expression of the vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 proteins, as measured in homogenized lung tissues (P<0.05) and human epithelial cells. The reduction in the T cell influx as a result of the decreased expression of cell adhesion molecules is one of the mechanisms by which simvastatin attenuates airway responsiveness and allergic inflammation. Rigorous review of the literature together with our findings suggested that simvastatin should be further developed as a potential therapeutic strategy for allergic asthma.",

The objective of this study was to compare traditional Cox proportional hazard models (with and without time-dependent covariates) with MSM to study causal effects of time-dependent drug use. The example of primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) with statins was examined using up to 17.7 years of follow-up from 4,654 participants of the observational prospective population-based Rotterdam Study. In the MSM model, the weight was based on measurements of established cardiovascular risk factors and co-morbidity. In general, we could not demonstrate important differences in results from the Cox models and MSM. Results from analysis on duration of statin use suggested that substantial residual confounding by indication was not accounted for during the period shortly after statin initiation. In conclusion, although on theoretical grounds MSM is an elegant technique, lack of data on the precise time-dependent confounders, such as indication of treatment or other considerations of the prescribing physician jeopardizes the calculation of valid weights. Confounding remains a hurdle in observational effectiveness research on preventive drugs with a multitude of prescription determinants.",

The objective of this study was to compare baseline characteristics and the risk of developing psychological and cognitive disorders between persistent and nonpersistent statin users. We performed a retrospective cohort study (October 1, 2003, to March 1, 2010) of 13,626 statin users in a regional US military health-care system. The persistence of statin use was defined by cumulative pharmacy fill data. Outcomes were the occurrence of psychological diseases during follow-up using prespecified groups based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes: (1) schizophrenia and psychosis, (2) major depression and bipolar disorders, (3) all psychological diseases, and (4) dementia and cognitive disorders. Statin users who were nonpersistent at 2\u00a0years were younger, less likely to be men, and had fewer co-morbidities than persistent users. They were also more likely to be diagnosed with schizophrenia or psychosis (odds ratio [OR] 1.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20 to 2.10) and cognitive disorders (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.03) during follow-up compared with persistent users.

The overall effect of high-intensity statins on the change in coronary percent atheroma volume and major adverse cardiovascular events (death/nonfatal myocardial infarction/coronary revascularization) were evaluated in this post hoc analysis. When compared with non-ACS patients (n=678), patients with ACS (n=361) were younger, actively smoking, and have had a previous myocardial infarction (all P<0.001). At baseline, patients with ACS exhibited lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (43.5\u00b111 versus 45.8\u00b111 mg/dL; P=0.002), a higher apolipoprotein B: apolipoprotein A-1 ratio (0.90\u00b10.24 versus 0.83\u00b10.24; P<0.001) and greater percent atheroma volume (37.3\u00b18.5% versus 35.9\u00b18.1%; P=0.01) when compared with non-ACS patients.

    "231": "The number of people taking statins is increasing across the globe, highlighting the importance of fully understanding statins' effects on the cardiovascular system. The beneficial impact of statins extends well beyond regression of atherosclerosis to include direct effects on tissues of the cardiovascular system ('pleiotropic effects'). Pleiotropic effects on the cardiac myocyte are often overlooked. Here we consider the contribution of the caveolin protein, whose expression and cellular distribution is dependent on cholesterol, to statin effects on the cardiac myocyte. Caveolin is a structural and regulatory component of caveolae, and is a key regulator of cardiac contractile function and adrenergic responsiveness. We employed an experimental model in which inhibition of myocyte HMG CoA reductase could be studied in the absence of paracrine influences from non-myocyte cells. Adult rat ventricular myocytes were treated with 10 \u00b5M simvastatin for 2 days. Simvastatin treatment reduced myocyte cholesterol, caveolin 3 and caveolar density. Negative inotropic and positive lusitropic effects (with corresponding changes in [Ca2+]i) were seen in statin-treated cells. Simvastatin significantly potentiated the inotropic response to \u03b22-, but not \u03b21-, adrenoceptor stimulation. Under conditions of \u03b22-adrenoceptor stimulation, phosphorylation of phospholamban at Ser16 and troponin I at Ser23/24 was enhanced with statin treatment. Simvastatin increased NO production without significant effects on eNOS expression or phosphorylation (Ser1177), consistent with the reduced expression of caveolin 3, its constitutive inhibitor. In conclusion, statin treatment can reduce caveolin 3 expression, with functional consequences consistent with the known role of caveolae in the cardiac cell. These data are likely to be of significance, particularly during the early phases of statin treatment, and in patients with heart failure who have altered \u03b2-adrenoceptor signalling. In addition, as caveolin is ubiquitously expressed and has myriad tissue-specific functions, the impact of statin-dependent changes in caveolin is likely to have many other functional sequelae.",

This approach takes into consideration results from clinical trials, adjusted for the patients' characteristics in treatment decision-making. We compared OMES with the French clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the management of dyslipidemia with statin in a computer-generated realistic virtual population, representing the adult French population, in terms of the number of all-cause deaths avoided (number of avoided events: NAEs) under treatment and the individual absolute benefit.

We recently observed that roflumilast N-oxide (RNO), the active metabolite of the PDE4 inhibitor roflumilast, prevents cigarette smoke-induced EMT in differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells. Further, statins were shown to protect renal and alveolar epithelial cells from EMT.", 
    "249": "To analyze how RNO and simvastatin (SIM) interact on CSE-induced EMT in well-differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells (WD-HBEC) from small bronchi in vitro.", 
    "250": "WD-HBEC were stimulated with CSE (2.5%). The mesenchymal markers vimentin, collagen type I and \u03b1-SMA, the epithelial markers E-cadherin and ZO-1, as well as \u03b2-catenin were quantified by real time quantitative PCR or Western blotting. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured using the H2DCF-DA probe. GTP-Rac1 and pAkt were evaluated by Western blotting.", 
    "251": "The combination of RNO at 2 nM and SIM at 100 nM was (over) additive to reverse CSE-induced EMT. CSE-induced EMT was partially mediated by the generation of ROS and the activation of the PI3K/Akt/\u03b2-catenin pathway. Both RNO at 2 nM and SIM at 100 nM partially abrogated this pathway, and its combination almost abolished ROS/ PI3K/Akt/\u03b2-catenin signaling and therefore EMT.",

    "253": "The accumulation of cholesterol is a general feature of cancer tissue, and recent evidence suggests that cholesterol plays critical roles in the progression of cancers, including breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers. The dysregulation of metabolic pathways, including those involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, is implicated in tumor development and cancer progression. Lipid rafts are highly dynamic cholesterol-enriched domains of the cell membrane, involved in various cellular functions, including the regulation of transmembrane signaling at the cell surface. It was recently demonstrated that lipid rafts also play critical roles in cancer cell adhesion and migration. This review focuses on our current understanding of how cholesterol regulation, lipid rafts, and dysregulated cholesterol biosynthesis contribute to cancer development and progression, and the therapeutic potential of cholesterol lowering for cancer prevention and treatment.", 
    "254": "Macrophages express several lysosomal cysteine proteases such as cathepsins and legumain. In this study, we assessed the expression, activity and secretion of legumain in cellular models of monocytes/macrophages. Macrophages were derived from M-CSF- or GM-CSF/IFN\u03b3-stimulated human primary monocytes (M2 and M1, respectively), PMA-treated human THP-1 cells, or murine RAW264.7 macrophages. In both primary monocytes and THP-1 cells, monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation caused highly increased cellular expression and activity of legumain. Also, secretion of legumain from macrophages, but not from monocytes, was observed. Notably, M2 macrophages expressed significantly higher levels of active legumain than M1 macrophages, which are not previously reported. Legumain mRNA has been shown to be down-regulated in monocytes isolated from patients treated with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor atorvastatin. Interestingly, in our study, the active legumain produced by M2 macrophages was found to be inhibited by atorvastatin, which was reflected in aberrant cellular expression and processing."
