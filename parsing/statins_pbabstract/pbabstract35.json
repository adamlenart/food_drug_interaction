    "0": "Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) may concur to endogenous vascular repair. Previous studies have reported that statin treatment increases EPC levels. We investigated whether this occurs in patients on long-term statin treatment who underwent percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs). In a phase A study, 53 patients (atorvastatin reload [AR] 80 mg 12 hours before + 40 mg 2 hours before PCI, n = 27; placebo [P], n = 26) were evaluated for EPC mobilization as CD45dim/CD34+/CD133+/KDR+ cell number by flow cytometry. Assays were run at randomization (12 hours before PCI, R), immediately before PCI (T0) at 8 (T8) and 24 hours (T24). In phase B study, 50 patients (AR, n = 25; P, n = 25) were evaluated for early colony formation by Hill colony forming unit (CFU) assay, with sampling at randomization and 24 hours later. In phase A, EPCs levels were similar at randomization between 2 arms (0.23% [0.14 to 0.54] of total events in AR vs 0.22% [0.04 to 0.37] in P group; p = 0.33). At PCI, EPC levels were higher in AR arm (0.42% [0.06 to 0.30] vs 0.19% [0.06 to 030]; p = 0.009). Higher EPC levels in AR group were also found at 8 and 24 hours. In phase B, EPC CFUs/well numbers at randomization were similar in the 2 arms (8 [6 to 12] in AR vs 12 [6 to 20] in P group, p = 0.109). EPC CFU/well at 24 hours became significantly higher in AR arm (17 [10 to 23] vs 5 [2 to 13], p = 0.002). In conclusion, high-dose AR before PCI in patients on long-term statin therapy promptly increases EPCs mobilization, which are capable of early colony formation and may contribute to cardioprotection.", 
    "1": "Arterial stiffness is associated with atherosclerosis and left ventricular (LV) diastolic function in general or hypertensive patients. However, the relationships between the arterial stiffness index measured at the radial artery and LV diastolic dysfunction in asymptomatic high-risk patients without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) have not been fully established.A total 532 statin-na\u00efve patients (male:female ratio, 230:302, mean age, 56.0 \u00b1 9.2 years) without ASCVD were enrolled from among subjects who simultaneously underwent transthoracic echocardiography and noninvasive semiautomated radial artery applanation tonometry from July 2011 to May 2014. Of these patients, 213 were categorized as the statin benefit group (Benefit) according to guidelines for blood cholesterol treatment, and the rest were placed in the nonbenefit control group (NoBenefit). Each group was subdivided into two groups (Y or N) according to antihypertensive medication administration. Thus, there were 4 groups: BenefitN (n = 80), BenefitY (n = 133), NoBenefitN (n = 251), and NoBenefitY (n = 68). There were significant differences in echocardiographic parameters of LV function and indices of arterial stiffness between the Benefit and NoBenefit groups. After adjusting for several risk factors, independent significant associations between echocardiographic parameters of LV diastolic function and arterial indices were identified with multivariate linear regression analysis in the Benefit patients.Parameters of arterial stiffness measured at the radial artery are associated with echocardiographic indices of LV diastolic function in asymptomatic high-risk patients without ASCVD. Therapies that prevent progression of arterial stiffness and reduce late-systolic pressure overload may help to reduce the prevalence of LV diastolic dysfunction in this population.",

    "3": "From Taiwan Bureau of National Health Insurance database, we enrolled patients with no prior statin therapy admitted for ischemic stroke or TIA between January 2002 and December 2005. Patients were grouped based on statin adherence according to medication possession ratio (MPR): good adherence (MPR >80%; n=2,274), intermittent adherence (MPR=40-80%; n=3,710), and poor adherence (MPR <40%; n=9,424). The study endpoint was the composite outcome of recurrent ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke, and acute coronary event 1 year after statin initiation. Follow-up data were obtained through December 2010. During follow-up, composite endpoints occurred in 5,354 patients (34.7%): good adherence, 798 patients (35.1%); intermittent adherence, 1,338 patients (36.1%); and poor adherence, 3,218 patients (34.1%). Compared with the good adherence group, patients in the poor adherence group and intermittent adherence group had higher risk of worse clinical outcome (adjusted HR, 1.26 and 1.16, respectively; 95% CI: 1.17-1.37 and 1.07-1.27, respectively).",

    "5": "Few studies have examined long-term effects of statin therapy on kidney diseases. The objective of this study was to determine the association of statin use with incidence of acute and chronic kidney diseases after prolonged follow-up. In this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed data from the San Antonio area military health care system from October 2003 through March 2012. Statin users were propensity score matched to nonusers using 82 baseline characteristics including demographics, co-morbidities, medications, and health care utilization. Study outcomes were acute kidney injury, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and nephritis/nephrosis/renal sclerosis. Of the 43,438 subjects included, we propensity score matched 6,342 statin users with 6,342 nonusers. Statin users had greater odds of acute kidney injury (odds ratio [OR] 1.30, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14 to 1.48), CKD (OR 1.36, 95% CI 1.22 to 1.52), and nephritis/nephrosis/renal sclerosis (OR 1.35, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.73). In a subset of patients without co-morbidities, the association of statin use with CKD remained significant (OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.27 to 1.85). In a secondary analysis, adjusting for diseases/conditions that developed during follow-up weakened this association. In conclusion, statin use is associated with increased incidence of acute and chronic kidney disease. These findings are cautionary and suggest that long-term effects of statins in real-life patients may differ from shorter term effects in selected clinical trial populations.", 
    "6": "The objective was to examine real-world treatment patterns of lipid-lowering therapies and their possible associated intolerance and/or ineffectiveness in patients with high cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk initiating statins and/or ezetimibe. Patients aged \u226518 years who initiated statins and/or ezetimibe from January 01, 2007, to June 30, 2011, were retrospectively identified from the IMS LifeLink PharMetrics Plus commercial claims database. Patients were further classified into 2 cohorts: (1) history of cardiovascular event (CVE) and (2) history of coronary heart disease risk equivalent (CHD RE). Patients had continuous health plan enrollment \u22651 year pre- and post-index date (statin and/or ezetimibe initiation date). Primary outcomes were index statin intensity, treatment modifications, possible associated statin/nonstatin intolerance and/or ineffectiveness issues (based on treatment modification), and time-to-treatment modifications. Analyses for each cohort were stratified by age group (<65 and \u226565 years). A total of 41,934 (history of CVE) and 170,344 patients (history of CHD RE) were included. On the index date, 8.8% to 25.1% of patients were initiated on high-intensity statin. Among patients aged <65, 79.2% and 48.8% of those with history of CVE and 78.6% and 47.3% of those with a history of CHD RE had \u22651 and 2 treatment modifications, respectively. Among all patients, 24.6% to 25.6% had possible statin intolerance and/or ineffectiveness issues after accounting for second treatment modification (if any). In conclusion, in patients with high CVD risk, index statin treatment modifications that imply possible statin intolerance and/or ineffectiveness were frequent; low use of high-intensity statins indicates unmet need in the management of hyperlipidemia and possible remaining unaccounted CVD residual risk.", 
    "7": "Long-term treatment of hypercholesterolemia with statins diminishes the risk of cardiovascular events. Statins are recommended in secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. In the absence of preexisting cardiovascular disease, the decision to start a statin or not is most often made by the general practitioner and his patient. An interactive decision aid, developed by the Mayo Clinic, has just been translated in French and adapted to the Swiss epidemiology of cardiovascular risk factors, with the aim of promoting shared decision-making. This paper reviews the conditions and potential benefits of shared decision-making about statin therapy in primary prevention.", 
    "8": "Peripheral arterial disease is a frequent under-diagnosed and poorly recognized clinical entity that can affect a great number of patients. Recognition of risk factors is crucial and a through evaluation of symptoms and use of diagnostic tools to better decide when an intervention is warranted. Lower extremity bypass surgery is one alternative method for treatment of PAD. It is indicated for type D and C lesions with low cardiac risk according to the TASC classification system. Preoperative assessment is imperative for every vascular procedure since it has been associated with major postoperative cardiovascular events; myocardial infarction being the most common. After excluding active disease, functional capacity and clinical risk predictors must be determined via METs and the Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI), respectively. If a patient is considered to have a high cardiac risk, then noninvasive studies should be performed. Aspirin and a statin should be administrated preoperatively and postoperatively. Clopidogrel can be utilized as an alternative if a contraindication to aspirin exists. Periodic follow up consisting of clinical evaluations assessing and return or progression of symptoms of claudication, presence of pulses, ankle-brachial index (ABI) measurement, and smoking cessation counseling should be performed in every patient after vascular surgery.", 
    "9": "The relationship between statin use and non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is unclear with conflicting findings in literature. Data from the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) Observational Study and WHI Clinical Trial were used to investigate the prospective relationship between statin use and NMSC in non-Hispanic white (NHW) postmenopausal women.",

Among 133,541 NHW participants, 118,357 with no cancer history at baseline and complete medication/covariate data comprised the analytic cohort. The association of statin use (baseline, overall as a time-varying variable, duration, type, potency, lipophilicity) and NMSC incidence was determined using random-effects logistic regression models.", 
    "11": "Over a mean of 10.5 years of follow-up, we identified 11,555 NMSC cases. Compared with participants with no statin use, use of any statin at baseline was associated with significantly increased NMSC incidence (adjusted odds ratio (ORadj) 1.21; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.07-1.35)). In particular, lovastatin (OR 1.52; 95% CI: 1.08-2.16), simvastatin (OR 1.38; 95% CI: 1.12-1.69), and lipophilic statins (OR 1.39; 95% CI: 1.18-1.64) were associated with higher NMSC risk. Low and high, but not medium, potency statins were associated with higher NMSC risk. No significant effect modification of the statin-NMSC relationship was found for age, BMI, smoking, solar irradiation, vitamin D use, and skin cancer history.",

The lack of duration-effect relationship points to possible residual confounding. Additional prospective research should further investigate this relationship.", 
    "13": "Coenzyme Q-10 (CoQ10) is a widely used alternative medication or dietary supplement and one of its roles is as an antioxidant. It naturally functions as a coenzyme and component of oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. Decreased levels have been demonstrated in diseased myocardium and in Parkinson disease. Farnesyl pyrophosphate is a critical intermediate for CoQ10 synthesis and blockage of this step may be important in statin myopathy. Deficiency of CoQ10 also has been associated with encephalomyopathy, severe infantile multisystemic disease, cerebellar ataxia, nephrotic syndrome, and isolated myopathy. Although supplementation with CoQ10 has been reported to be beneficial in treating hypertension, congestive heart failure, statin myopathy, and problems associated with chemotherapy for cancer treatement, this use of CoQ10 as a supplement has not been confirmed in randomized controlled clinical trials. Nevertheless, it appears to be a safe supplementary medication where usage in selected clinical situations may not be inappropriate. This review is an attempt to actualize the available information on CoQ10 and define its potential benefit and appropriate usage.", 
    "14": "The platinating agent cisplatin (CisPt) is commonly used in the therapy of various types of solid tumors. The anticancer efficacy of CisPt largely depends on the formation of bivalent DNA intrastrand crosslinks, which stimulate mechanisms of the DNA damage response (DDR), thereby triggering checkpoint activation, gene expression and cell death. The clinically most relevant adverse effect associated with CisPt treatment is nephrotoxicity that results from damage to renal tubular epithelial cells. Here, we addressed the question whether the HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor lovastatin affects the DDR of renal cells by employing rat renal proximal tubular epithelial (NRK-52E) cells as in vitro model. The data show that lovastatin has extensive inhibitory effects on CisPt-stimulated DDR of NRK-52E cells as reflected on the levels of phosphorylated ATM, Chk1, Chk2, p53 and Kap1. Mitigation of CisPt-induced DDR by lovastatin was independent of the formation of DNA damage as demonstrated by (i) the analysis of Pt-(GpG) intrastrand crosslink formation by Southwestern blot analyses and (ii) the generation of DNA strand breaks as analyzed on the level of nuclear \u03b3H2AX foci and employing the alkaline comet assay. Lovastatin protected NRK-52E cells from the cytotoxicity of high CisPt doses as shown by measuring cell viability, cellular impedance and flow cytometry-based analyses of cell death. Importantly, the statin also reduced the level of kidney DNA damage and apoptosis triggered by CisPt treatment of mice. The data show that the lipid-lowering drug lovastatin extensively counteracts pro-apoptotic signal mechanisms of the DDR of tubular epithelial cells following CisPt injury.", 
    "15": "Statins' therapy in osteoporosis can aggravate muscle damage. This study was designed to assess which agent, L-carnitine or coenzyme Q10, could enhance the anti-osteoporotic effect of atorvastatin while antagonizing myopathy in ovariectomized rats.", 
    "16": "Forty-eight female Sprague Dawley rats were used; forty rats were ovariectomized while eight were sham-operated. Eight weeks post-ovariectomy, rats were divided into ovariectomized-untreated group and four ovariectomized-treated groups (n=8) which received by gavage (mg/(kg\u2219d), for 8 weeks) 17\u03b2-estradiol (0.1), atorvastatin (50), atorvastatin (50)+L-carnitine (100), or atorvastatin (50)+coenzyme Q10 (20). At the end of therapy, bone mineral density (BMD), bone mineral content (BMC), and serum levels of bone metabolic markers (BMMs) and creatine kinase (CK) were measured. Femurs were used for studying the breaking strength and histopathological changes.",

Estrogen therapy restored BMD and BMC to near normal levels, but failed to increase bone strength. Although atorvastatin and atorvastatin+coenzyme Q10 improved BMD, BMC, and bone strength, they failed to restore levels to normal. All treatments decreased BMMs and improved histopathological changes maximally with atorvastatin+L-carnitine which restored levels to near normal. Atorvastatin aggravated the ovariectomy-induced increase in CK level while estrogen, atorvastatin+L-carnitine, and atorvastatin+coenzyme Q10 decreased its level mainly with atorvastatin+L-carnitine which restored the level to near normal.",

    "19": "The cholesterol synthesis pathway is a ubiquitous cellular biosynthetic pathway that is attenuated therapeutically by statins. Importantly, type I interferon (IFN), a major antiviral mediator, also depresses the cholesterol synthesis pathway. Here we demonstrate that attenuation of cholesterol synthesis decreases gammaherpesvirus replication in primary macrophages in vitro and reactivation from peritoneal exudate cells in vivo. Specifically, the reduced availability of the intermediates required for protein prenylation was responsible for decreased gammaherpesvirus replication in statin-treated primary macrophages. We also demonstrate that statin treatment of a chronically infected host attenuates gammaherpesvirus latency in a route-of-infection-specific manner. Unexpectedly, we found that the antiviral effects of statins are counteracted by type I IFN. Our studies suggest that type I IFN signaling counteracts the antiviral nature of the subdued cholesterol synthesis pathway and offer a novel insight into the utility of statins as antiviral agents.", 
    "20": "Statins are cholesterol synthesis inhibitors that are therapeutically administered to 12.5% of the U.S.", 
    "21": "Statins attenuate the replication of diverse viruses in culture; however, this attenuation is not always obvious in an intact animal model. Further, it is not clear whether statins alter parameters of highly prevalent chronic herpesvirus infections. We show that statin treatment attenuated gammaherpesvirus replication in primary immune cells and during chronic infection of an intact host. Further, we demonstrate that type I interferon signaling counteracts the antiviral effects of statins. Considering the fact that type I interferon decreases the activity of the cholesterol synthesis pathway, it is intriguing to speculate that gammaherpesviruses have evolved to usurp the type I interferon pathway to compensate for the decreased cholesterol synthesis activity.", 
    "22": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), characterized by intermittent hypoxia (IH) during transient cessation of breathing, triples the risk for cardiovascular diseases. We used a phage display peptide library as an unbiased approach to investigate whether IH, which is specific to OSA, activates endothelial cells (ECs) in a distinctive manner. The target of a differentially bound peptide on ECs collected from OSA patients was identified as CD59, a major complement inhibitor that protects ECs from the membrane attack complex (MAC). A decreased proportion of CD59 is located on the EC surface in OSA patients compared with controls, suggesting reduced protection against complement attack. In vitro, IH promoted endothelial inflammation predominantly via augmented internalization of CD59 and consequent MAC deposition. Increased internalization of endothelial CD59 in IH appeared to be cholesterol-dependent and was reversed by statins in a CD59-dependent manner. These studies suggest that reduced complement inhibition may mediate endothelial inflammation and increase vascular risk in OSA patients.",

Clinical presentations can be subacute or acute, ranging from benign muscle pain with mild elevations of serum creatine kinase to fulminant rhabdomyolysis with high creatine kinase levels and potentially life-threatening acute kidney injury. Myalgias and proximal muscle weakness are typical symptoms; onset can be weeks to months after drug exposure. Endocrine disorders and inflammatory etiologies should be excluded because their management may differ from that of drug-induced myopathies. Statin drugs are prescribed widely, and statin-induced myopathy is one of the most commonly recognized and studied myopathies. Risk factors include dose and type of statin prescribed, older age, female sex, genetic predisposition, and concomitant use of other drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system. Glucocorticoids, immunologic drugs, and antimicrobials, as well as other drugs and alcohol, can cause myopathies.

The literature indicates that the NNT for benefit with high-intensity versus moderate-intensity statins is 31 in high-risk patients with a number needed-to-harm of 47.", 
    "51": "The 2013 guideline is projected to prevent more clinical ASCVD events and with lower NNTs than the 2014 guideline, yet both have substantial benefit. The 2013 guideline is also expected to generate more adverse events, but the risk-benefit profile appears favor .",

Lipid disorders, including lipodystrophy, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypercholesterolemia, remain the most commonly reported metabolic disorders among those treated with long-term cART. Mounting evidence suggests an association between drug abuse and poor glycemic control and diabetes complications. Substance related disorders (SRD) may increase the risk of metabolic syndrome.", 
    "53": "The aim of this retrospective cohort study was to examine the relationship between SRD, cART, and lipid-lowering agent use in an HIV infected population. Patients received efavirenz or protease inhibitor-based cART for at least 6 months. Prescription information was retrieved from the medical records. The primary outcome was the use of lipid-lowering agents including statins, fibrates and fish oil. The impact of SRD and cART was assessed on the lipid-lowering agent use.", 
    "54": "A total of 276 subjects with HIV infection were included, 90 (33%) received lipid-lowering agents, and 31 (34%) had SRD. Smoking was prevalent among subjects with SRD (84 vs 15%, p<0.001). Statins were the mainstay for the management of dyslipidemia (66%), followed by the fibrates (24%), omega-3 fatty acids (5%), nicotinic acid (3%) and the cholesterol absorption inhibitors (3%). Use of statins or fibrates was significantly higher among subjects without SRD than those with (40 vs 23%, p=0.005). The type of cART, including efavirenz and protease inhibitors, appeared to have no significant impact on the use pattern of lipid-lowering agents. Lopinavir/ritonavir (lopinavir/r) was mostly prescribed for subjects with SRD (25 vs 8%, p=0.02).", 
    "55": "Among HIV-infected patients, statins remain the mainstay for the management of dyslipidemia in routine clinical care, followed by fibrates. A significant high risk of metabolic disorders among patients with SRD is implicated by heavy tobacco use and prevalent lopinavir/r-based treatment. Significantly low rate of lipid-lowering agent use in this population underscores the importance of lipid disorder scrutiny and cART treatment optimization for HIV-infected patients with SRD.", 
    "56": "Several antimicrobial and immunosuppressive effects have been attributed to the statins class of antihyperlipidemia drugs. Several studies have also indicated clinical benefits for the use of statins during the management of infections and sepsis. To assess whether the immunosuppressive effects of statins outweigh their antimicrobial effects during a fungal infection BALB/c mice were administered Candida albicans via intraperitoneal injection. These mice received either a co-injection of atorvastatin along with the infection, were treated with one injection of atorvastatin per day for 5 days prior to infection, or were infected and then treated with one injection of atorvastatin for 5 days afterward. Groups that received C. albicans without being treated with atorvastatin were included as controls along with a group that only received phosphate-buffered saline. Mouse survival was then monitored; additionally, serum IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 levels were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay to assess pro-inflammatory and pro-humoral responses, respectively. Atorvastatin administration was capable of altering mouse survival rate with the lowest rate (11.1%) being observed in the group treated for 5 days prior to infection with atorvastatin compared to mice infected but not treated with atorvastatin (44.4%). IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 levels were depressed in all C. albicans-infected groups treated with atorvastatin. The possibility that statin administration may suppress or modulate particular components of the immune system during an infection in man should be further explored in large randomized controlled trials.",

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the impact of chronic statin use on development of new-onset DM in a series of Asian population. The patients were retrospectively enrolled using the electronic database of Korea University Guro Hospital from January 2004 to February 2010. A total of 10,994 patients without a history of diabetes were analyzed. Baseline lipid profiles, fasting glucose, Hemoglobin (Hb) A1c, and glucose tolerance tests were measured in all patients before statin treatment. Included patients had HbA1c \u2264 5.7% and fasting glucose level \u2264 100 (mg/dl). The patients were divided into 2 groups according to the use of statins (the statin group, n = 2,324 patients and the nonstatin group, n = 8,670 patients). To adjust baseline potential confounders, a propensity score-matched analysis was performed using logistic regression model. After propensity score matching, 2 propensity-matched groups (1,699 pairs, n = 3,398, C statistic = 0.859) were generated and analyzed. After propensity score matching, baseline characteristics of both groups were balanced except that the statin group was older and had higher rate of coronary artery disease compared with the nonstatin group. During a 3-year follow-up, the statin group had higher incidence of new-onset DM compared with the nonstatin group (hazard ratio 1.99, 95% CI 1.36 to 2.92, p <0.001), but the statin group showed lower incidence of major adverse cerebral-cardiovascular events compared with the nonstatin group (hazard ratio 0.40, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.85, p <0.001). In the present study, although the use of statins was associated with higher rate of new-onset DM, it markedly improved 3-year cardiovascular outcomes in Asian population.", 
    "58": "Studies have found associations between PM2.5 and cardiovascular events. The role of different components of PM2.5 is not well understood. We used linear mixed-effects models with the adaptive LASSO penalty to select PM2.5 species and source(s), separately, that may be associated with markers of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, with adjustment for age, obesity, smoking, statin use, diabetes mellitus, temperature, and season as fixed effects in a large longitudinal cohort of elderly men. We also analyzed these associations with source apportionment models and examined genetic pathway-air pollution interactions within three relevant pathways (oxidative stress, metal processing, and endothelial function). We found that independent of PM2.5 mass vanadium (V) was associated with intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). An IQR increase (3.2\u2009ng/m(3)) in 2-day moving average V was associated with a 2.5% (95% CI: 1.2-3.8%) change in ICAM-1 and a 3.9% (95% CI: 2.2-5.7%) change in VCAM-1, respectively. In addition, an oil combustion source rich in V was linked to these adhesion molecules. People with higher allelic risk profiles related to oxidative stress may have greater associations (P-value of interaction=0.11). Our findings suggest that particles derived from oil combustion may be associated with inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, and it is likely that oxidative stress plays a role in the associations.",

Lipoprotein apheresis (LA), previously known as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) apheresis, is very effective in reducing LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) if HoFH is refractory to aggressive drug therapy and diet control. In this study, we report a case with HoFH, who presented with xanthomata over the 4 limbs when she was 3 years old. When she was 11 years old, she began treatment with semi-selective LA with double filtration plasmapheresis (DFPP) once per week because HoFH was refractory to high-dose statin and diet control. LDL-C was reduced from 8.2 \u00b1 0.9 to 2.69 \u00b1 0.75 mmol/l (reduction rate = 67.3 \u00b1 6.1%). The xanthomata over the 4 limbs were nearly completely resolved after 2 years of DFPP. Two years later, after the initiation of DFPP, we performed coronary angiography and echocardiography for regular checkup in the absence of chest pain, and the result was negative. To date (11 years after initiation of DFPP), she has not complained of any chest pain, shown intolerance to exercise, or exhibited ST-T change on electrocardiography. At the age of 20, multidetector computed tomography showed no significant stenosis over the coronary arteries. At the most recent follow-up visit, she was found to have good heart function and no xanthomata. LA is effective in the treatment of HoFH when drug therapy and diet control fail. With this treatment, pre-existing xanthomata can regress and coronary artery disease can be prevented.", 
    "64": "Gastric cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The correlation of Helicobacter pylori and the etiology of gastric cancer was substantially certain. Cholesterol-rich microdomains (also called lipid rafts), which provide platforms for signaling, are associated with H. pylori-induced pathogenesis leading to gastric cancer. Patients who have been prescribed statins, inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, have exhibited a reduced risk of several types of cancer. However, no studies have addressed the effect of statins on H. pylori-associated gastric cancer from the antineoplastic perspective. In this study, we showed that treatment of gastric epithelial cells with simvastatin reduced the level of cellular cholesterol and led to attenuation of translocation and phosphorylation of H. pylori cytotoxin-associated gene A (CagA), which is recognized as a major determinant of gastric cancer development. Additionally, a nationwide case-control study based on data from the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD) was conducted. A population-based case-control study revealed that patients who used simvastatin exhibited a significantly reduced risk of gastric cancer (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.70-0.83). In patients exhibiting H. pylori infection who were prescribed simvastatin, the adjusted OR for gastric cancer was 0.25 (95% CI = 0.12-0.50). Our results combined an in vitro study with a nationwide population analysis reveal that statin use might be a feasible approach to prevent H. pylori-associated gastric cancer.",

The effects of 10 mg of rosuvastatin on plaque progression were evaluated in 78 patients who achieved LDL-C <70 mg/dL with statin treatment. The patients were divided into plaque progressors (n=30) and plaque regressors (n=40) on the basis of the baseline minimum lumen area (MLA) site at the 9-month follow-up. The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) [creatinine clearance (CrCl) <60 mL/min)] and current smoking was higher in progressors than in regressors (90.0% vs. 31.3%, p<0.001, and 40.0% vs. 12.5%, p=0.005, respectively). Baseline CrCl was significantly lower and baseline apolipoprotein (apo) B/A1 was significantly higher in progressors than in regressors (21\u00b113 mL/min vs. 70\u00b120 mL/min, p<0.001, and 0.77\u00b10.23 vs. 0.65\u00b10.16, p=0.011, respectively). Absolute and relative fibrotic areas at the MLA site increased in progressors; by contrast, these areas decreased in regressors from baseline to follow-up.

Extensive in vitro data, experimental studies and more recently few clinical trials have strongly suggested statins to possess an important role in RA mainly mediated by their anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties.

However, even with the substantial low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol lowering achieved with statin treatment, CVD remains the top cause of death in developed countries. Selective inhibitors of the cholesterol esterifying enzyme sterol-O acyltransferase 2 (SOAT2) hold great promise as effective CVD therapeutics. In mouse models, previous work has demonstrated that either antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) or small molecule inhibitors of SOAT2 can effectively reduce CVD progression, and even promote regression of established CVD. Although it is well known that SOAT2-driven cholesterol esterification can alter both the packaging and retention of atherogenic apoB-containing lipoproteins, here we set out to determine whether SOAT2-driven cholesterol esterification can also impact basal and liver X receptor (LXR)-stimulated fecal neutral sterol loss. These studies demonstrate that SOAT2 is a negative regulator of LXR-stimulated fecal neutral sterol loss in mice.", 
    "79": "The glycine amidinotransferase gene (GATM) plays a vital role in energy metabolism in muscle tissues and is associated with multiple clinically important phenotypes. However, the genetic diversity of the GATM gene remains poorly understood within and between human populations. Here we analyzed the 1,000 Genomes Project data through population genetics approaches and observed significant genetic diversity across the GATM gene among various continental human populations. We observed considerable variations in GATM allele frequencies and haplotype composition among different populations. Substantial genetic differences were observed between East Asian and European populations (FST = 0.56). In addition, the frequency of a distinct major GATM haplotype in these groups was congruent with population-wide diversity at this locus. Furthermore, we identified GATM as the top differentiated gene compared to the other statin drug response-associated genes. Composite multiple analyses identified signatures of positive selection at the GATM locus, which was estimated to have occurred around 850 generations ago in European populations. As GATM catalyzes the key step of creatine biosynthesis involved in energy metabolism, we speculate that the European prehistorical demographic transition from hunter-gatherer to farming cultures was the driving force of selection that fulfilled creatine-based metabolic requirement of the populations.",

To identify novel transcriptional modulators of ACSL1, we examined ACSL1 expression in liver tissues of hamsters fed a normal diet, a high fat diet, or a high cholesterol and high fat diet (HCHFD). Feeding hamsters HCHFD markedly reduced hepatic Acsl1 mRNA and protein levels as well as acyl-CoA synthetase activity. Decreases in Acsl1 expression strongly correlated with reductions in hepatic Srebp2 mRNA level and mature Srebp2 protein abundance. Conversely, administration of rosuvastatin (RSV) to hamsters increased hepatic Acsl1 expression. These new findings were reproduced in mice treated with RSV or fed the HCHFD. Furthermore, the RSV induction of acyl-CoA activity in mouse liver resulted in increases in plasma and hepatic cholesterol ester concentrations and reductions in free cholesterol amounts. Investigations on different ACSL1 transcript variants in HepG2 cells revealed that the mRNA expression of C-ACSL1 was specifically regulated by the sterol regulatory element (SRE)-binding protein (SREBP) pathway, and RSV treatment increased the C-ACSL1 abundance from a minor mRNA species to an abundant transcript. We analyzed 5'-flanking sequence of exon 1C of the human ACSL1 gene and identified one putative SRE site. By performing a promoter activity assay and DNA binding assays, we firmly demonstrated the key role of this SRE motif in SREBP2-mediated activation of C-ACSL1 gene transcription. Finally, we demonstrated that knockdown of endogenous SREBP2 in HepG2 cells lowered ACSL1 mRNA and protein levels. Altogether, this work discovered an unprecedented link between ACSL1 and SREBP2 via the specific regulation of the C-ACSL1 transcript.",

The clinical benefit of statin therapy can be seen after a few months, thus supporting use in secondary prevention even when the lifespan is restricted to a few years. Recent guidelines propose the use of moderate doses in the elderly > 75 years. The evidence for treatment in primary prevention is weaker and the evaluation of the total cardiovascular risk is complicated by the high baseline risk of many elderly. Rational treatment decisions should be based on biologic rather than chronologic age. Statins are generally well tolerated in the elderly, requiring clinical monitoring only, with particular attention to pharmacokinetic interactions and renal failure.",

    "102": "The present cross sectional study was carried out on 787 type 2 diabetic subjects from tertiary health care hospitals to identify the prevalence and predictors of depression in diabetes. Depression was tested using Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Of the study participants, 199 (25.29%) met the criteria for mild to moderate depression, 252 (32.02%) were severely depressed and 336 (42.69%) were clinically non-depressed. The prevalence of depression was 65.02 % in women, which is 1.87 fold higher (p < 0.0001) than men (49.87%). Depression was observed to be strongly associated with advancing age >30 years (p < 0.05), low income (p = 0.0001), sedentary life style (p = 0.001), Plasma levels of low density lipoproteins (LDL) >100 mg/dl and triglycerides (TG) >150 mg/dl (p < 0.05), drinking alcohol (p < 0.001), statin use (p < 0.001), BMI >35-39.9 kg m(-2) (p = 0.018), WHR >0.9 cm (p < 0.0001), Glucose levels >125 mg/dl (p < 0.0001) and duration of diabetes 2-4 years (p = 0.003). In multivariate logistic regression model, risk factors such as, being a woman, duration of diabetes \u226510 years, BMI \u226530 kg m(-2), LDL >100 mg/dl, TG >150 mg/dl and sedentary life style emerged as independent predictors of depression in diabetes. In the present study, 86.4 % diabetic subjects were not diagnosed for depression prior participation. In conclusion, the present study revealed that higher prevalence of depression in diabetes was evident in population of Punjab, especially in women and majority of these patients remain undiagnosed for depression.",

In the present study, we examined whether lipid-lowering agents inhibited the progression of NAFLD and tumorigenesis in a non-alcoholic steatohepatitis-derived hepatocellular carcinoma model mouse (STAM mice) generated by streptozotocin injection and a high-fat diet. Seven-week-old STAM mice were divided into groups fed a high-fat diet (Ctl) or a high-fat diet supplemented with ezetimibe (Ez), fenofibrate (Ff), rosuvastatin (Rs), ezetimibe plus fenofibrate (EF), or ezetimibe plus rosuvastatin (ER) for 4 weeks. At the end of the experiments, an oral glucose tolerance test, an insulin tolerance test, biochemical analyses using serum and liver, and a histological analysis of liver were performed in 11-week-old STAM mice. The lipid-lowering agents did not affect the body weight or the casual blood glucose levels in any of the groups. The serum triglyceride level was significantly decreased by Ff, Rs, and EF. Glucose tolerance was improved by Ez and Ff, but none of these agents improved insulin sensitivity. A histochemical analysis revealed that the lipid-lowering agents, with the exception of Rs, significantly inhibited the progression of hepatic steatosis. Nonetheless, no significant changes in the incidence of hepatic tumors were observed in any of the groups. Lipid-lowering agents inhibited the progression of hepatic steatosis without suppressing tumorigenesis in STAM mice. Our data has implications for the mechanism underlying steatosis-independent hepatic tumorigenesis in mice.",

Pravastatin renal clearance was significantly higher in pregnancy compared with postpartum. Four subjects in the placebo group developed preeclampsia compared with none in the pravastatin group. Although pravastatin reduced maternal cholesterol concentrations, umbilical cord cholesterol concentrations and infant birthweight were not different between the groups. The majority of umbilical cord and maternal pravastatin plasma concentrations at the time of delivery were below the lower limit of quantification of the assay. Pravastatin use was associated with a more favorable pregnancy angiogenic profile.",

Observational data indicate that low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels are strongly positively associated with the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) whilst the level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is strongly inversely associated, with additional associations being observed for other lipid parameters such as triglycerides, apolipoproteins and lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)). This has led to an interest in the development of a range of lipid intervention therapies. The most widely used of these interventions are statins, but even with intensive statin therapy some groups of patients remain at significant residual cardiovascular (CV) risk. In addition, some people are intolerant of statin therapy. In these circumstances, additional therapeutic agents may be needed.

The objective of this study is to examine the association of statins with risk of being diagnosed with aortic, peripheral, and visceral artery aneurysm. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study of Tricare enrollees (from 1 October 2003 to 31 March 2012). Main outcomes were diagnosis of aortic, peripheral, or visceral artery aneurysm and undergoing aortic aneurysm repair procedure during follow-up period. Using 115 baseline characteristics, we generated a propensity score to match statin users and nonusers and examine the odds of outcomes (primary analysis). Secondary analysis examined outcomes at various subcohorts. Results Out of 10,910 statin users and 49,545 nonusers, we propensity score-matched 6728 pairs of statin users and nonusers. Statin users and nonusers had similar odds of being diagnosed with aortic, peripheral, and visceral artery aneurysms (odds ratio [OR]: 1.06, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 0.85-1.33) and of undergoing aortic aneurysm repair procedures (OR: 0.54, 95% CI: 0.22-1.35). Secondary analysis showed a tendency toward fewer aortic aneurysm procedures among statin users that did not reach statistical significance. However, high-intensity statin users in comparison to non-intensive statin users had higher adjusted odds of aortic, peripheral, and visceral artery aneurysms (OR: 1.76, 95% CI: 1.37-2.25, p\u2009<\u2009.0001).

    "162": "HIV infection is associated with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD), and increased rates of myocardial infarction and stroke have been observed in HIV-infected individuals. After traditional risk factors that are more common among people living with HIV infection (such as smoking and diabetes) are accounted for, the excess risk for CVD persists. Recent studies suggest that increased immune activation and inflammation may contribute to excess risk for CVD in the context of HIV infection. Imaging studies in the HIV-infected population have found inflamed, noncalcified plaque that is vulnerable to rupture. Statin therapy may represent a potentially useful primary prevention strategy for CVD in HIV-infected individuals, as this class of drugs lowers lipid levels and may simultaneously reduce immune activation and inflammation. REPRIEVE (Randomized Trial to Prevent Vascular Events in HIV) is a large, multicenter study funded by the National Institutes of Health. REPRIEVE will test whether pitavastatin, a newer statin that does not have substantial interactions with antiretroviral drugs, can prevent vascular events over time among HIV-infected individuals who do not have known CVD. This study is now open to enrollment at sites throughout the United States and abroad and will hopefully provide definitive data on this important question.",

After adjusting for age, sex, and statin use, NHBs and MAs had higher intermediate and high CRP levels compared to NHWs. Income lessened the magnitude of the association for both race/ethnic groups. The greater intermediate and high CRP burden for NHBs and MAs was strongly explained by educational attainment. MAs were more vulnerable to high CRP levels for the lowest (i.e., less than nine years) and post high school (i.e., associates degree) educational levels. After additional adjustment for smoking, heavy drinking, high waist circumference, high blood pressure, diabetes and statin use, the strength of the association between race/ethnicity and inflammation was reduced for NHBs with elevated intermediate (RR = 1.31; p \u2264 0.001) and high CRP levels (RR = 1.14; p \u2264 0.001) compared to NHWs but the effect attenuated for MAs for both intermediate (RR = 0.74; p \u2264 0.001) and high CRP levels (RR = 0.38; p \u2264 0.001).

Serum total cholesterol levels showed a reverse J-shaped relationship with the development of organ space surgical site infection and pneumonia. There was no discernible effect of serum cholesterol levels on the postoperative mortality observed in this cohort of patients. Decreased serum albumin was one of the strongest risk factors for the development of nosocomial infection after surgery. Postoperative pneumonia was not observed in patients taking statin medications whose cholesterol levels were <200\u00a0mg/dl. Serum total cholesterol may be a valid predictor of surgical outcome. Preoperative statin use may affect the development of postoperative pneumonia in patients with total cholesterol levels below 200\u00a0mg/dl.", 
    "214": "The intestinal efflux transporter breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) restricts the absorption of rosuvastatin. Of the transporters important to rosuvastatin disposition, fostamatinib inhibited BCRP (IC50 = 50 nM) and organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1; IC50 > 10 \u03bcM), but not organic anion transporter 3, in vitro, predicting a drug-drug interaction (DDI) in vivo through inhibition of BCRP only. Consequently, a clinical interaction study between fostamatinib and rosuvastatin was performed (and reported elsewhere). This confirmed the critical role BCRP plays in statin absorption, as inhibition by fostamatinib resulted in a significant 1.96-fold and 1.88-fold increase in rosuvastatin area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and Cmax, respectively. An in vitro BCRP inhibition assay, using polarized Caco-2 cells and rosuvastatin as probe substrate, was subsequently validated with literature inhibitors and used to determine BCRP inhibitory potencies (IC50) of the perpetrator drugs eltrombopag, darunavir, lopinavir, clopidogrel, ezetimibe, fenofibrate, and fluconazole. OATP1B1 inhibition was also determined using human embryonic kidney 293-OATP1B1 cells versus estradiol 17\u03b2-glucuronide. Calculated parameters of maximum enterocyte concentration [Igut max], maximum unbound hepatic inlet concentration, transporter fraction excreted value, and determined IC50 value were incorporated into mechanistic static equations to compute theoretical increases in rosuvastatin AUC due to inhibition of BCRP and/or OATP1B1. Calculated theoretical increases in exposure correctly predicted the clinically observed changes in rosuvastatin exposure and suggested intestinal BCRP inhibition (not OATP1B1) to be the mechanism underlying the DDIs with these drugs. In conclusion, solitary inhibition of the intestinal BCRP transporter can result in clinically significant DDIs with rosuvastatin, causing up to a maximum 2-fold increase in exposure, which may warrant statin dose adjustment in clinical practice.", 
    "215": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a major clinical and public health problem, with no current medications approved as having disease modifying effects. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, or \"statins\", a drug class widely used to prevent cardiovascular events, could potentially affect OA progression via a number of mechanisms including their effects on lipid metabolism and inflammation. The aim of this multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is to determine whether atorvastatin reduces the progression of knee structural changes and symptoms over 2 years in patients with symptomatic knee OA.", 
    "216": "350 patients with symptomatic knee OA will be recruited through the OA Clinical Trial Network (in Melbourne, Hobart and Adelaide). They will be randomly allocated to the two arms of the study, receiving either 40 mg of atorvastatin or identical placebo once daily for 2 years. Magnetic resonance imaging of the knee will be performed at baseline and 2 years later. Knee structure, symptoms and function will be assessed using validated methods. The primary outcome is annual percentage change in knee cartilage volume. Secondary outcomes include progression of cartilage defects, bone marrow lesions, knee pain and function. The primary analysis will be by intention to treat, but per protocol analyses will also be performed.", 
    "217": "The study will provide high-quality evidence to address whether atorvastatin has a novel disease modifying effect in OA by delaying the structural and symptomatic progression of knee OA. Thus, the trial has major public health and clinical importance, as if found to be beneficial, atorvastatin could produce substantial cost savings by delaying and possibly reducing the need for joint replacement surgery, and provide marked improvements in quality of life for people with OA.",

    "219": "Guidelines recommend initiating primary prevention for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) with statins based on absolute ASCVD risk assessment. Recently, alternative trial-based and hybrid approaches were suggested for statin treatment eligibility.", 
    "220": "This study compared these approaches in a direct head-to-head fashion in a contemporary population.", 
    "221": "The study used the CGPS (Copenhagen General Population Study) with 37,892 subjects aged 40 to 75 years recruited in 2003 to 2008, all free of ASCVD, diabetes, and statin use at baseline.", 
    "222": "Among the population studied, 42% were eligible for statin therapy according to the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) risk assessment and cholesterol treatment guidelines approach, versus 56% with the trial-based approach and 21% with the hybrid approach. Among these statin-eligible subjects, the ASCVD event rate per 1,000 person-years was 9.8, 6.8, and 11.2, respectively. The ACC/AHA-recommended absolute risk score was well calibrated around the 7.5% 10-year ASCVD risk treatment threshold and discriminated better than the trial-based or hybrid approaches. Compared with the ACC/AHA risk-based approach, the net reclassification index for eligibility for statin therapy among 40- to 75-year-old subjects from the CGPS was -0.21 for the trial-based approach and -0.13 for the hybrid approach.", 
    "223": "The clinical performance of the ACC/AHA risk-based approach for primary prevention of ASCVD with statins was superior to the trial-based and hybrid approaches. Our results indicate that the ACC/AHA guidelines will prevent more ASCVD events than the trial-based and hybrid approaches, while treating fewer people compared with the trial-based approach.", 
    "224": "Experimental ischemia-reperfusion models have shown that 3-hydroxy-3methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, statins, have cardioprotective effects. SAMIT (Statin Acute Myocardial Infarction Trial) is a multicenter prospective open randomized trial, designed to evaluate the effects of statin treatment from the earliest stage on cardioprotection in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Patients were randomly assigned to receive atorvastatin (initial dose of 40\u00a0mg at admission followed by the maintenance dose of 10\u00a0mg/day for 30\u00a0days) or not (control), and then immediately underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for the culprit lesion. The primary endpoints were infarct size and left ventricular function. The secondary endpoints were major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) and various biomarkers. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between 2 groups of the statin treatment group and the control group. The left ventricular ejection fraction increased at 6\u00a0months after the onset of AMI, compared with the baseline level in the atorvastatin group (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), while it did not change in the control group. Although there were no significant differences in the MACCE, the changes in the levels of angiopoietin-like protein 2 (ANGPTL2) (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05), and glyceraldehyde-derived advanced glycation end-products, (TAGE) (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01) were suppressed at 2\u00a0weeks in the atorvastatin group, compared with the control group. Statin therapy started early after the onset reduced the levels of ANGPTL2 and TAGE, and thus, might have cardioprotective effects in patients with AMI.", 
    "225": "An Expert Panel convened by the National Lipid Association previously developed a consensus set of recommendations for the patient-centered management of dyslipidemia in clinical medicine (part 1). These were guided by the principle that reducing elevated levels of atherogenic cholesterol (non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) reduces the risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. This document represents a continuation of the National Lipid Association recommendations developed by a diverse panel of experts who examined the evidence base and provided recommendations regarding the following topics: (1) lifestyle therapies; (2) groups with special considerations, including children and adolescents, women, older patients, certain ethnic and racial groups, patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus, patients with rheumatoid arthritis, and patients with residual risk despite statin and lifestyle therapies; and (3) strategies to improve patient outcomes by increasing adherence and using team-based collaborative care."
