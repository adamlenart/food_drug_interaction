The roles of prenylated proteins in cells are well conserved across species, underscoring the biological and evolutionary importance of this lipid modification pathway. Genetic suppression and pharmacological inhibition of the protein prenylation machinery have provided insights into several cellular processes and into the aetiology of diseases in which prenylation is involved. The functional dependence of prenylation substrates, such as RAS proteins, on this modification and the therapeutic potential of targeting the prenylation process in pathological conditions accentuate the need to fully understand this form of post-translational modification.", 
    "1": "This work proposed a new method which applied image processing and support vector machine (SVM) for screening of mold strains. Taking Monascus as example, morphological characteristics of Monascus colony were quantified by image processing. And the association between the characteristics and pigment production capability was determined by SVM. On this basis, a highly automated screening strategy was achieved. The accuracy of the proposed strategy is 80.6 %, which is compatible with the existing methods (81.1 % for microplate and 85.4 % for flask). Meanwhile, the screening of 500 colonies only takes 20-30 min, which is the highest rate among all published results. By applying this automated method, 13 strains with high-predicted production were obtained and the best one produced as 2.8-fold (226 U/mL) of pigment and 1.9-fold (51 mg/L) of lovastatin compared with the parent strain. The current study provides us with an effective and promising method for strain improvement.",

The complications of atherosclerosis occur early and more frequently. They are strongly linked with lifestyle factors and an increase of LDL-C concentrations in industrialized countries. A new therapeutic approach seems to be the modulation of the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), which reduces the number of LDL-receptors at the cell membrane of the liver cells and thus increases the concentration of LDL-C in the blood. Results of current studies show, that in particular, a combination of PCSK9-AB and statins, independent of the dosage of the statins, is suitable to increase a reduction of LDL-C and Lp(a). This article gives an overview of the pathophysiology, the current study and research situation as well as the possible different approaches to the therapeutic influence of PCSK9 in the future.",

Previously, we have shown that camphene, a constituent of mastic gum oil, lowers cholesterol and triglycerides (TG) in the plasma of hyperlipidemic rats without affecting HMG-CoA reductase activity, suggesting that its hypocholesterolemic and hypotriglyceridemic effects are associated with a mechanism of action different than that of statins. In the present study, we examine the mechanism by which camphene exerts its hypolipidemic action. We evaluated the effect of camphene on the de novo synthesis of cholesterol and TG from [14C]-acetate in HepG2 cells, along with the statin mevinolin. Camphene inhibited the biosynthesis of cholesterol in a concentration-dependent manner, and a maximal inhibition of 39% was observed at 100 \u03bcM while mevinolin nearly abolished cholesterol biosynthesis. Moreover, treatment with camphene reduced TG by 34% and increased apolipoprotein AI expression. In contrast, mevinolin increased TG by 26% and had a modest effect on apolipoprotein AI expression. To evaluate the mode of action of camphene, we examined its effects on the expression of SREBP-1, which affects TG biosynthesis and SREBP-2, which mostly affects sterol synthesis. Interestingly, camphene increased the nuclear translocation of the mature form of SREBP-1 while mevinolin was found to increase the amount of the mature form of SREBP-2. The effect of camphene is most likely regulated through SREBP-1 by affecting MTP levels in response to a decrease in the intracellular cholesterol. We propose that camphene upregulates SREBP-1 expression and MTP inhibition is likely to be a probable mechanism whereby camphene exerts its hypolipidemic effect.",

CHD risk differs between genders, with coronary events lagging behind ten years for women in comparison to men. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering with statin therapy is a major target for cardiovascular risk reduction. The benefit of statin therapy has been well established in men, for both primary and secondary prevention. However, the same has not been shown for women. While studies have demonstrated benefit in women for secondary prevention, their role in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease remains controversial. Data released over the past several years regarding statin efficacy and safety in men and women has been inconsistent, given that these studies had small sample sizes with numerous study limitations. A recent large scale meta-analysis of both primary and secondary statin prevention trials with sex-specific outcomes demonstrated a similar benefit in both men and women. Statins demonstrated a decrease in cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality in both sexes. In regards to statin safety, additional trials investigating the difference in adverse events of statins in men versus women, particularly new onset of diabetes, myalgias, and liver dysfunction, are warranted. Increased awareness and monitoring of female patients for myalgias and hyperglycemia should be considered as a precaution.

Acidic pHe-induced MMP-9 production was reduced by C3 exoenzyme, which inhibits the Rho family of GTPases; cytochalasin D, which inhibits actin reorganization; and simvastatin, which inhibits geranylgeranylation of Rho. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) against RhoA, but not against Rac1 or Cdc42, significantly inhibited acidic pHe induction of MMP-9. Pull-down assays showed that acidic pHe increased the activated form of RhoA. Forced expression of constitutively active RhoA induced MMP-9 production, even at neutral pHe. RhoA siRNA also reduced acidic pHe induced PLD activity. Specific inhibition of PLD1 and Pld1 gene knockout significantly reduced acidic pHe-induced MMP-9 expression. In contrast, PLD2 inhibition or knockout had no effect on MMP-9 expression. These findings suggested that RhoA-PLD1 signaling is involved in acidic pHe induction of MMP-9.",

For this reason, we used drug-induced hepatotoxicity as an example to establish a systematic strategy for screening specific biomarkers and applied these biomarkers to evaluate whether the drugs have potential hepatotoxicity toxicity. Carbon tetrachloride (5\u2009ml/kg), acetaminophen (1500\u2009mg/kg), and atorvastatin (5\u2009mg/kg) are established as rat hepatotoxicity models. Fifteen common biomarkers were screened by multivariate statistical analysis and integration analysis-based metabolomics data. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of the biomarkers. We obtained 10 specific biomarker candidates with an area under the curve greater than 0.7. Then, a support vector machine model was established by extracting specific biomarker candidate data from the hepatotoxic drugs and nonhepatotoxic drugs; the accuracy of the model was 94.90% (92.86% sensitivity and 92.59% specificity) and the results demonstrated that those ten biomarkers are specific. 6 drugs were used to predict the hepatotoxicity by the support vector machines model; the prediction results were consistent with the biochemical and histopathological results, demonstrating that the model was reliable. Thus, this support vector machine model can be applied to discriminate the between the hepatic or nonhepatic toxicity of drugs. This approach not only presents a new strategy for screening-specific biomarkers with greater diagnostic significance but also provides a new evaluation pattern for hepatotoxicity, and it will be a highly useful tool in toxicity estimation and disease diagnoses.",

Yet despite best treatment including statins, attaining sufficient LDL-C lowering can be problematic for high cardiovascular risk patients. The development of PCSK9 inhibitors, driven by novel genetic and mechanistic insights, offers an answer. Removal of circulating PCSK9 increases LDL receptor availability, and thus markedly decreases plasma LDL-C levels (by \u223c50-60%), and is additive to the lipid lowering effects of statins and ezetimibe. PCSK9 inhibition also reduces (by 25-30%) plasma levels of lipoprotein(a), a causal factor in atherosclerotic vascular disease, suggestive of partial catabolism of lipoprotein(a) by LDL receptors. The ODYSSEY and PROFICIO (Programme to Reduce LDL-C and Cardiovascular Outcomes Following Inhibition of PCSK9 In Different Populations) clinical trial programmes involving a wide range of high-risk patients, including statin intolerant patients, have confirmed the consistency of the LDL response, even with concomitant high-intensity statin or nonstatin therapy.

However, there are few data to define what constitutes optimal medical therapy. We present a retrospective analysis of 529 ARVD patients. Separate analyses were performed comparing outcomes in patients prescribed/not prescribed beta blocker and antiplatelet agents. Analyses were adjusted for effects of baseline covariates on probability of treatment and on clinical outcome. Over a median follow-up period of 3.8\u00a0years, antiplatelet therapy was associated with a reduced risk for death (relative risk, 0.52 [95% confidence interval {CI}: 0.31-0.89]; P\u00a0=\u00a0.02). Beta blocker therapy was associated with a reduced for death (relative risk, 0.45 [95% CI: 0.21-0.97]; P\u00a0=\u00a0.04) and nonfatal cardiovascular events (relative risk, 0.74 [95% CI: 0.60-0.90]; P\u00a0=\u00a0.003).

    "63": "Recent studies have shown that pharmacological increases in HDL cholesterol concentrations do not necessarily translate into clinical benefits for patients, raising concerns about its predictive value for cardiovascular events. Here we hypothesize that the size-modulated lipid distribution within HDL particles is compromised in metabolic disorders that have abnormal HDL particle sizes, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2). By using NMR spectroscopy combined with a biochemical volumetric model we determined the size and spatial lipid distribution of HDL subclasses in a cohort of 26 controls and 29 DM2 patients before and after two drug treatments, one with niacin plus laropiprant and another with fenofibrate as an add-on to simvastatin. We further characterized the HDL surface properties using atomic force microscopy and fluorescent probes to show an abnormal lipid distribution within smaller HDL particles, a subclass particularly enriched in the DM2 patients. The reduction in the size, force cholesterol esters and triglycerides to emerge from the HDL core to the surface, making the outer surface of HDL more hydrophobic. Interestingly, pharmacological interventions had no effect on this undesired configuration, which may explain the lack of clinical benefits in DM2 subjects.", 
    "64": "Despite marked clinical benefit, reduction in atheroma volume with statin therapy is minimal. Changes in plaque composition may explain this discrepancy. We aimed in the present study to assess the effect of statin therapy on coronary plaque composition and plaque volume using serial multimodality imaging. From an open-label, single-blinded study, patients with angiographically mild-to-moderate lesion were randomized to receive atorvastatin 60 (AT 60) mg or atorvastatin 20 (AT 20) mg for 12 months. Optical coherence tomography was used to assess fibrous cap thickness (FCT) and intravascular ultrasound to assess atheroma burden at 3 time points: baseline, at 6 months, and at 12 months. Thirty-six lipid-rich plaques in 27 patients with AT 60 mg and 30 lipid-rich plaques in 19 patients with AT 20 mg were enrolled in this study. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level was significantly decreased at 6 months without further reduction at 12 months. AT 60 mg induced greater reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol compared with AT 20 mg. Optical coherence tomography revealed continuous increase in FCT from baseline to 6 months and to 12 months in both groups. AT 60 mg induced greater increase in FCT compared with AT 20 mg at both follow-up points. The prevalence of thin-cap fibroatheroma and the presence of macrophage at 6 months were significantly lower in AT 60 mg compared with AT 20 mg. Plaque burden did not change significantly in both groups. In conclusion, both intensive and moderate statin therapy stabilizes coronary plaques, with a greater benefit in the intensive statin group. However, no significant changes in plaque volume were observed over time regardless of the intensity of statin therapy.", 
    "65": "The pleiotropic effects of statins, beyond their cholesterol-lowering properties, are much debated. In primary prevention, several observational cohort and case-control studies appear to show that statins reduce the incidence of venous thromboembolism by about 30%. In a single randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial (JUPITER), which included 17,000 patients, rosuvastatin 20mg/day reduced the risk of venous thromboembolism by 43%. However, these patients were at low risk of venous thromboembolism, and the frequency of the event was, in principle, low. In secondary prevention, several observational studies and post-hoc analyses of randomized clinical trials have suggested that statins may prevent recurrence of venous thromboembolism. However, none of these studies had enough scientific weight to form the basis of a recommendation to use statins for secondary prevention. The putative preventive effect of statins appears to be independent of plasma cholesterol concentration and could be a pharmacological property of the statin class, although a dose-effect relationship has not been demonstrated. The mechanism through which statins might prevent venous thrombosis is thought to involve their anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects or perhaps a more specific action, by blocking the degradation of antithrombotic proteins. A mechanism involving the action of statins on interactions between risk factors for atherosclerosis and venous thromboembolism is supported by some studies, but not all. In the absence of firm evidence, statins cannot currently be recommended for primary or secondary prevention of venous thromboembolism.", 
    "66": "Nuclear receptors (NRs) are key regulators of gene expression and physiology. Nearly half of all human NRs lack endogenous ligands including estrogen-related receptor \u03b1 (ERR\u03b1). ERR\u03b1 has important roles in cancer, metabolism, and skeletal homeostasis. Affinity chromatography of tissue lipidomes with the ERR\u03b1 ligand-binding domain (LBD) and subsequent transcriptional assays identified cholesterol as an endogenous ERR\u03b1 agonist. Perturbation of cholesterol biosynthesis or inhibition of ERR\u03b1 revealed the interdependence of cholesterol and ERR\u03b1. In bone, the effects of cholesterol, statin, and bisphosphonate on osteoclastogenesis require ERR\u03b1; and consequently, cholesterol-induced bone loss or bisphosphonate osteoprotection is lost in ERR\u03b1 knockout mice. Furthermore, statin induction of muscle toxicity and cholesterol suppression of macrophage cytokine secretion are impaired by loss or inhibition of ERR\u03b1. These findings reveal a key step in ERR\u03b1 regulation and explain the actions of two highly prescribed drugs, statins and bisphosphonates.", 
    "67": "Conclusive evidence regarding the effect of statins on non-end stage chronic kidney disease (CKD) has not been reported previously. This meta-analysis evaluated the association between statins and microalbuminuria, proteinuria, progression, and all-cause mortality in patients with non-end stage CKD. Databases (e.g., PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library) were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with data on statins, microalbuminuria, proteinuria, renal health endpoints, and all-cause mortality patients with non-end stage CKD to perform this meta-analysis. The mean difference (MD) of the urine albumin excretion ratios (UAER), 24-h urine protein excretion, and risk ratios (RR) of all-cause mortality and renal health endpoints were calculated, and the results are presented with 95% confidence intervals (CI). A total of 23 RCTs with 39,419 participants were selected. The analysis demonstrated that statins statistically reduced UAER to 26.73 \u03bcg/min [95%CI (-51.04, -2.43), Z=2.16, P<0.05], 24-h urine protein excretion to 682.68 mg [95%CI (-886.72, -478.63), Z=6.56, P<0.01] and decreased all-cause mortality [RR=0.78, 95%CI (0.72, 0.84), Z=6.08, P<0.01]. However, the analysis results did not indicate that statins reduced the events of renal health endpoints [RR=0.96, 95%CI (0.91,1.01), Z=1.40, P>0.05]. In summary, our study indicates that statins statistically reduced microalbuminuria, proteinuria, and clinical deaths, but statins did not effectively slow the clinical progression of non-end stage CKD.",

Herein, using the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line as a neurotoxicity in vitro model, we studied the potential Sv protective effect on ROFA cytotoxicity. We evaluated cell viability by the MTT assay, superoxide anion generation by NBT test, Nrf2 activation by immunofluorescence, apoptosis by cleaved-PARP and active-caspase 3 expressions, and senescence by \u03b2-galactosidase activity. SH-SY5Y cells exposed to ROFA (10 and 50\u03bcg/ml) for 24h showed decreased cell viability, increased superoxide anion generation, apoptosis and senescence. Pretreatment with Sv (1\u03bcM) for 6 days, restored cell viability to basal levels, reduced ROFA-induced O2(-) generation as well as the number of apoptotic and senescent cells. Sv pretreatment stimulated the basal and ROFA-induced levels of Nrf2 nuclear translocation suggesting that activation of the cellular antioxidant defense system prevented particle-induced oxidative stress.

Thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage occurred in some statin-treated patients, but the reason remains unclear. In the current study, we show that lovastatin dose-dependently induces depolarization of mitochondrial inner transmembrane potential, leading to up-regulation of Bak, down-regulation of Bcl-XL, and activation of caspase-3/8/9. Lovastatin treatment did not increase the surface expression of P-selectin or PAC-1 binding but led to strongly reduced collagen- and thrombin-induced platelet aggregation. The integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 antagonist, RGDS, inhibited lovastatin-induced apoptosis in both human platelets and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23. The number of circulating platelets in mice was significantly reduced after intraperitoneal injections with lovastatin. Taken together, these data indicate that lovastatin induced caspase-dependent platelet apoptosis. Lovastatin does not incur platelet activation, whereas impairs platelet function and reduces circulating platelets in vivo, suggesting the possible pathogenesis of thrombocytopenia and hemorrhage in patients treated with statins.", 
    "99": "Mast cell (MC)- and basophil-associated inflammatory diseases are a considerable burden to society. A significant portion of patients have symptoms despite standard-of-care therapy. Statins, used to lower serum cholesterol, have immune-modulating activities. We tested the in vitro and in vivo effects of statins on IgE-mediated MC and basophil activation. Fluvastatin showed the most significant inhibitory effects of the six statins tested, suppressing IgE-induced cytokine secretion among mouse MCs and basophils. The effects of fluvastatin were reversed by mevalonic acid or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphatase, and mimicked by geranylgeranyl transferase inhibition. Fluvastatin selectively suppressed key Fc\u03b5RI signaling pathways, including Akt and ERK. Although MCs and basophils from the C57BL/6J mouse strain were responsive to fluvastatin, those from 129/SvImJ mice were completely resistant. Resistance correlated with fluvastatin-induced upregulation of the statin target HMG-CoA reductase. Human MC cultures from eight donors showed a wide range of fluvastatin responsiveness. These data demonstrate that fluvastatin is a potent suppressor of IgE-mediated MC activation, acting at least partly via blockade of geranyl lipid production downstream of HMG-CoA reductase. Importantly, consideration of statin use for treating MC-associated disease needs to incorporate genetic background effects, which can yield drug resistance.",

This article addresses how I juggle these multiple guidelines in my clinical practice. In brief, my approach to risk stratification is to use the Pooled Cohort Equations, but I also routinely assess the risk factors unique to or predominant in women such as pregnancy complications and systemic autoimmune collagen vascular diseases. I follow the 2013 AHA/American College of Cardiology (ACC) Guidelines on Lifestyle Management to Reduce Cardiovascular Risk, but find value in the detailed aspects of physical activity recommendation in the 2011 Women's Guideline, including those for weight loss or weight loss maintenance. Based solely on epidemiological data, I consider a blood pressure (BP) of 120//80 mmHg ideal in women who remain asymptomatic at that level. I typically titrate BP therapy to 120-130/80-90 mmHg as tolerated. I endorse the current ACC/AHA recommendations for cholesterol management, but for my women patients older than age 75 who previously tolerated a high-intensity statin, I continue that medication or whatever statin they tolerated through age 75. For women older than age 75 with a recent acute atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) event, a high-risk population, I follow the guideline for younger patients. As ASCVD events are becoming more common before 40 years of age, I screen younger women earlier when risk factors unique to or predominant in women are present. I incorporate sex-specific risk factors for stroke in the risk ascertainment component of women's medical records. With regard to depression, at minimum I perform screening for all women with coronary heart disease with a 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2). For women with suspected ischemic heart disease, I adhere to the recommendations of the 2014 Consensus Statement of the AHA, \"The Role of Noninvasive Testing in the Evaluation of Women with Suspected Ischemic Heart Disease.\" An unmet need remains an updated guideline on Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease in Women.",

Risk of adverse events such as acute kidney injury might occur following the coprescription of CYP3A4-metabolized statins and CCBs that inhibit CYP3A4.This was a population-based cohort study. The study analyzed data of patients treated between 1997 and 2011, retrieved from Taiwan's National Health Insurance database. We enrolled 32,801 patients who received coprescription of statins and CCBs that inhibit CYP3A4 (amlodipine, diltiazem, felodipine nicardipine, nifedipine, and verapamil). These patients were divided into 2 groups, according to whether they had received CYP3A4-metabolized statins (lovastatin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin) or non-CYP3A4-metabolized statins (fluvastatin, rosuvastatin, and pitavastatin).

We used the CCTA arm of the Rule Out Myocardial Infarction using Computed Angiographic Tomography II multicenter, randomized control trial (R-II) and comparison cohort from the observational Rule Out Myocardial Infarction using Computed Angiographic Tomography I cohort (R-I). In R-II, subjects were randomly assigned to CCTA to guide decision making, whereas in R-I patients underwent CCTA with results blinded to caregivers and managed according to standard care. Our final cohort consisted of 277 subjects from R-I and 370 from R-II. ACS rate was similar (6.9% vs 6.2% respectively, p = 0.75).

However, only 68% of subjects in R-II with obstructive CAD were discharged on statin and 65% on aspirin. In conclusion, physician knowledge of CCTA results leads to improved alignment of aspirin and statin with the presence and severity of CAD although still many patients with CCTA-detected CAD are not discharged on aspirin or statin.

We utilized 30 male Wistar albino rats allocated in 5 groups, each containing 6 rats: control, GEN (100 mg/kg/day), ATO (10 mg/kg/day) + GEN, MT (20 mg/kg/day) + GEN, and ATO (10 mg/kg/day) plus MT (20 mg/kg/day) + GEN. Kidney weight, serum creatinine and urea concentration, renal ROS, MDA, GSH levels, SOD, and CAT activity were determined. GEN-induced nephrotoxicity was evidenced by marked elevations in serum urea and creatinine, kidney weight, renal ROS, and MDA levels and reduction in renal GSH level, SOD and CAT activity. MT pretreatment significantly lowered the elevated serum creatinine concentration, kidney weight, renal ROS and MDA levels. However ATO could not reduce these parameters, but similarly to MT, it was able to enhance the renal GSH level, CAT and SOD activity. In addition, a combination therapy of MT plus ATO enhanced the beneficial effects of ATO, while not changing the effects of MT effects or even improving them.

Attendance was relatively higher among older people, of whom 19.6% of those eligible at age 60-74 years attended and 9.0% at age 40-59 years. Attendance by population groups at higher cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, such as the more socially disadvantaged 14.9%, was higher than that of the more affluent 12.3%. Among attendees 7844 new cases of hypertension (38/1000 Checks), 1934 new cases of type 2 diabetes (9/1000 Checks) and 807 new cases of chronic kidney disease (4/1000 Checks) were identified. Of the 27,624 people found to be at high CVD risk (20% or more 10-year risk) when attending an NHS Health Check, 19.3% (5325) were newly prescribed statins and 8.8% (2438) were newly prescribed antihypertensive therapy.",

    "155": "Arterial stiffening accompanies both aging and atherosclerosis, and age-related stiffening of the arterial intima increases RhoA activity and cell contractility contributing to increased endothelium permeability. Notably, statins are 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors whose pleiotropic effects include disrupting small GTPase activity; therefore, we hypothesized the statin simvastatin could be used to attenuate RhoA activity and inhibit the deleterious effects of increased age-related matrix stiffness on endothelial barrier function. Using polyacrylamide gels with stiffnesses of 2.5, 5, and 10 kPa to mimic the physiological stiffness of young and aged arteries, endothelial cells were grown to confluence and treated with simvastatin. Our data indicate that RhoA and phosphorylated myosin light chain activity increase with matrix stiffness but are attenuated when treated with the statin. Increases in cell contractility, cell-cell junction size, and indirect measurements of intercellular tension that increase with matrix stiffness, and are correlated with matrix stiffness-dependent increases in monolayer permeability, also decrease with statin treatment. Furthermore, we report that simvastatin increases activated Rac1 levels that contribute to endothelial barrier enhancing cytoskeletal reorganization. Simvastatin, which is prescribed clinically due to its ability to lower cholesterol, alters the endothelial cell response to increased matrix stiffness to restore endothelial monolayer barrier function, and therefore, presents a possible therapeutic intervention to prevent atherogenesis initiated by age-related arterial stiffening.", 
    "156": "Statins, the most commonly prescribed class of drug, have demonstrated effects beyond cholesterol reduction including anti-tumor and immunomodulatory properties. Several epidemiological studies have suggested an anti-neoplastic effect of statins evidenced by reductions in cancer incidence and cancer-related mortality. Clinical trials on statins as part of therapy for cancer have generated interest in the oncology community. Statins have been investigated for a variety of cancers, early and late stage, and in combination with chemotherapy and radiation. So far promising results have been reported with statin use in pediatric brainstem tumors, early stage breast cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), colorectal cancer (CRC), refractory or relapsed multiple myeloma (MM), and refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). There is still much investigation to be completed to determine which subtypes of patients benefit from statin therapy, how statins may potentiate other anticancer approaches, and the appropriate dosing schedule to use.",

    "158": "Mevalonate (MVA) is synthesized from 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) by HMG-CoA reductase (HMG-CoAR). MVA is further metabolized to farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), a precursor of cholesterol and sterols. FPP is also converted to geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, and these lipids are used for post-translational modification of proteins that are involved in various aspects of tumor development and progression. Many studies showed that the MVA pathway is up-regulated in several cancers such as leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma; as well as breast, hepatic, pancreatic, esophageal and prostate cancers. Several mechanisms may be involved in dysregulation of this pathway. They include p53 mutation, a mutation in HMG-CoAR and sterol-regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) cleavage-activating protein SCAP as its regulator, PKB/Akt activation, decreased AMPK activation, and activation of transcription factors such as: SREBP and HIF-1. Statins as inhibitors of MVA pathway might be useful for cancer prevention and/or treatment through their interactions with essential cellular functions, such as cell proliferation and differentiation. Other inhibitors are also designed for inhibition of this key pathway and their mechanism of action was investigated. In the present review, we will first describe about some inhibitors of MVA, including statins that have been suggested for cancer treatment. We will then discuss about the mechanisms involved in MVA dysregulation, especially in cancer.", 
    "159": "The mevalonate pathway has been extensively studied for its involvement in cholesterol synthesis. Inhibition of this pathway using statins (3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors; HMGR inhibitors) is the primarily selected method due to its cholesterol-lowering effect, making statins the most commonly used (86-94%) cholesterol-lowering drugs in adults. This pathway has several other by-products that are affected by statins including GTPase molecules (guanine triphosphate-binding kinases), such as Rho/Rho-associated coiled kinase (ROCK) kinases, that are implicated in other diseases, including those of the central nervous system (CNS). These molecules control several aspects of neural cell life including axonal growth, cellular migration, and cell death, and therefore, are of increasing interest in the field of spinal cord injury (SCI). Limited regeneration capacity of nerve fibers in adult CNS has been considered the main obstacle for finding a SCI cure. Over the past two decades, the identity of inhibitory factors for regeneration has been widely investigated. It is well-established that the Rho/ROCK kinase system is specifically activated by the components of damaged spinal cord tissue, including oligodendrocytes and myelin, as well as extracellular matrix. This has led many groups to hypothesize that statin therapy may in fact enhance the current neurorestorative approaches. In this mini-review, a summary of SCI pathophysiology is discussed and the current literature targeting the regeneration obstacles in SCI are reviewed, with special attention to recent publications of the past decade. In addition, we focus on the current literature involving the use of pharmacological and molecular inhibitors of small GTPase molecules for treatment of neurotrauma. Inhibiting these molecules has been shown to increase neuroprotection, enhance axonal regeneration, and facilitate the implementation of cell replacement therapies. Based upon available literature, the need for clinical trials involving targeted inhibition of GTPase molecules remains strong. Some of these drugs are widely used for other diseases, and therefore re-purposing their application for neurotrauma can be fasttracked. These approaches can potentially modify the inhibitory environment of nervous tissue to allow the spontaneous repair capacity of injured tissue.", 
    "160": "The mevalonate pathway synthesizes intermediates and products such as cholesterol and nonsterol isoprenoids that are crucial for cell survival and function. In the human placenta, the prenylation of proteins, rather than cholesterol synthesis, represents the main \"metabolic target\" of mevalonate metabolism. Major cellular functions depend on isoprenylation including proliferation, migration, metabolism and protein glycosylation that are all crucial for proper development of the embryo and the placenta. Statins are inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes the reduction of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid by NADPH. In vitro experiments using human placental explants suggest that statins elicit a detrimental effect on placental growth. However, animal and epidemiologic studies show no increase of fetal malformations after exposure to statins during pregnancy. Moreover, emerging evidence from mouse studies suggest that statins may be useful in preventing serious pregnancy complications like preeclampsia.", 
    "161": "The mevalonic acid synthesis pathway, cholesterol, and lipoproteins play fundamental roles in lung physiology and the innate immune response. Recent literature investigating roles for cholesterol synthesis and trafficking in host defense against respiratory infection was critically reviewed. The innate immune response and the cholesterol biosynthesis/trafficking network regulate one another, with important implications for pathogen invasion and host defense in the lung. The activation of pathogen recognition receptors and downstream cellular host defense functions are critically sensitive to cellular cholesterol. Conversely, microorganisms can co-opt the sterol/lipoprotein network in order to facilitate replication and evade immunity. Emerging literature suggests the potential for harnessing these insights towards therapeutic development. Given that >50% of adults in the U.S. have serum cholesterol abnormalities and pneumonia remains a leading cause of death, the potential impact of cholesterol on pulmonary host defense is of tremendous public health significance and warrants further mechanistic and translational investigation.", 
    "162": "The cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, also referred to as the mevalonate (MVA) pathway, is responsible for the biosynthesis of two key isoprenoids: farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP). Post-translational modification of small GTPases by FPP and GGPP has captured much attention due to their potential contribution to cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. The enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase (HMGCR) catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to MVA, and is the rate-limiting step in the biosynthesis of cholesterol. Statins are HMGCR inhibitors that are used extensively in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Inhibitors of the MVA pathway exhibit anti-tumor effects and may reduce cancer incidence and cancer-related mortality in humans. In this review, we will focus on the mevalonate cascade and its regulation in cholesterol metabolism as well as polymorphisms of the MVA cascade in cancer development, infectious and cardiovascular disease (CVD).", 
    "163": "The mevalonate cascade is a key metabolic pathway that regulates a variety of cellular functions and is thereby implicated in the pathophysiology of most brain diseases, including neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders. Emerging lines of evidence suggest that statins and Rho GTPase inhibitors are efficacious and have advantageous properties in treatment of different pathologic conditions that are relevant to the central nervous system. Beyond the original role of statins in lowering cholesterol synthesis, they have anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and modulatory effects on signaling pathways. Additionally, Rho GTPase inhibitors and statins share the mevalonate pathway as a common target of their therapeutic actions. In this review, we discuss potential mechanisms through which these drugs, via their role in the mevalonate pathway, exert their neuroprotective effects in neurodegenerative and neurodevelopmental disorders.", 
    "164": "The metabolic steroid hormones, 17\u03b2 stradiol (E2) and testosterone play key roles in several functions including carbohydrate, lipid and protein metabolism, cellular signaling, cell proliferation, and cancer promotion. Steroid hormones have long been characterized as cell proliferation and differentiation regulators and are closely related to the development of breast and prostate cancers. Moreover, cholesterol metabolism, mainly in adipose tissue, leads to the production of steroids and cytokines, thus increasing the risk of metabolic syndrome, obesity, and ER+ breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Recent studies also shown that testosterone and E2 increase the levels of key enzymes of the mevalonate pathway, leading to post-translational prenylation and farnesylation of numerous proteins in RAS signaling in several cancers, including breast and prostate cancers. There is accumulating evidence both clinically and experimentally suggesting that changes in the metabolism of cholesterol may also have an important role in carcinogenesis. In this regard, the cells treated with mevalonate in culture showed elevated proliferation. Therefore, investigation on cholesterol as a precursor of steroid hormones has confirmed the effects cholesterol metabolite on breast and prostate cancers. Indeed, recent evidence strongly suggests that the MVA pathway and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCOA) have a crucial regulatory role in cellular proliferation and transformation. Therefore, the use of mevalonate inhibitors decreases the production of several biologically active downstream products of the mevalonate pathway, including cholesterol. Although for approximately 20 years statins have been identified as anticancer agents, recent studies have sparked some controversy. Therefore, further investigation to evaluate mevalonate- dependent therapeutic agents per se and in combination with other agents is merited. The current review is an attempt to elucidate the role of cholesterol and E2/testosterone, as well as the mevalonate pathway and its inhibitors in breast and prostate tissues in normal and pathological states.", 
    "165": "Inhibition of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase by pharmaceuticals, commonly referred to as statins, has proven to be an effective and efficient way in reducing cholesterol levels in patients. As a result of this intervention, mevalonate production, formed during cholesterol synthesis, is inhibited. Mevalonate is the precursor to a variety of crucial downstream products, including those involved with the mitochondrial electron transport chain, and localized activation of small GTPases. Statins have also been observed to induce changes of the immune system, favouring a reduced proinflammatory phenotype. However, near complete cessation of mevalonate and its downstream products have severe pro-inflammatory consequences as evident by patients suffering from mevalonate kinase deficiency who have increased inflammasome activity. It is evident that mevalonate production is a pivotal component of normal homeostatic cell processing, especially in maintaining a muted inflammatory response.", 
    "166": "Immunomodulatory effects of statins in vitro and in experimental models of asthma and COPD could potentially be relevant to the treatment of chronic airway diseases. This article provides an overview of the evidence from the key clinical studies on the effects of statins on clinical outcomes and inflammatory biomarkers in asthma and COPD. Future directions for clinical studies of statins in asthma and COPD are discussed. A small number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in adults with mild to moderate asthma suggest that short-term statin treatment does not improve lung function or symptom control, except for a possible improvement in quality of life and symptoms in smokers with asthma. Several observation studies report that statin use in asthma is associated with a reduced risk of asthma-related emergency department visits, oral corticosteroid dispensing or hospital admissions. Statins treatment in asthma may have modest local anti-inflammatory effects in the airways. There is a need for a large RCT examining the effects of statins on reducing exacerbations, particularly in severe asthma. In COPD, observational studies suggest that statin use is associated with reduced morbidity and/or mortality, whereas a large RCT concluded that simvastatin did not reduce exacerbations in patients with COPD that had no cardiovascular indication for statin treatment. It is possible that a subgroup of COPD patients with cardiovascular indications for statins and/or systemic inflammation may obtain clinical benefit from statin treatment. Understanding the immunomodulatory effects of statins in asthma and COPD may lead to the development of novel targeted interventions.", 
    "167": "Current evidence suggests that persisting and/or exaggerated inflammation in the lungs initiated by smoking, and up-regulated through genetic susceptibility, may result in lung remodelling and impaired repair. The mevalonate pathway, through its modifying effects on innate immune responsiveness, may be involved in these processes providing a plausible pathogenic link between the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer. The mevalonate pathway, mediates these effects through important intra-cellular signalling molecules called guanine phosphate transferases (GTPases) such as Rho-A. Smoke exposure activates cell surface proteins which, through the mediating influence of GTPases, then modify the activation of NFkB and its downstream effects on genes underlying innate immunity, neutrophilic inflammation and carcinogenesis. The mevalonate pathway is readily and substantially modified by inhibition of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-Coenzyme A (HMGCo-A) reductase. This enzyme controls the rate limiting step of the mevalonate pathway and is subject to inhibition by statin drugs and small chain fatty acids derived from high dietary fibre intake. Thus inhibiting the mevelonate pathway, and dampening the innate immune response to smoking, may play a critical role in modifying pulmonary inflammation and lung remodelling. Such an action might slow the progression of COPD and reduce the tendency to the development of lung cancer. This review examines the pre-clinical and clinical data suggesting that HMGCoA-reductase inhibition and it's modification of the mevalonate pathway, may have a chemo-preventive effect on lung cancer, particularly in patients with COPD where pulmonary inflammation is increased and the risk of lung cancer is greatest.",

This study aims to investigate effects of PTH\u00a0+\u00a0SIM on implant stabilization in osteopenic rats. Fourteen weeks after chronically fed a low protein diet, osteopenic rats randomly received implants. Subsequently, the animals were randomly divided into four groups: Control, SIM, PTH and PTH\u00a0+\u00a0SIM. Then all rats from groups PTH, SIM and PTH\u00a0+\u00a0SIM received PTH (40\u00a0\u03bcg/kg, three times a week), SIM (25\u00a0mg/kg, daily), or both for 12\u00a0weeks. The results of our study indicated that all treatments promoted bone healing around implant compared to Control, but PTH\u00a0+\u00a0SIM treatment showed significantly stronger effects than PTH or SIM alone in histological, micro-CT, and biomechanical tests. The results indicated additive effects of PTH and SIM on implant fixation in osteoporotic rats.",

The tracking of injected Dex and the effect of statin-Dex injection on endogenous DCs were performed by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry, respectively. The number of Foxp3(+) cells in thymuses was examined using immunocytochemistry. Treg cells, cytokine secretion, lymphocyte proliferation, cell viability and apoptosis, and the levels of autoantibody were also carried out to evaluate the effect of statin-Dex on EAMG rats. To further investigate the involvement of FasL/Fas in statin-Dex-induced apoptosis, the underlying mechanisms were studied by FasL neutralization assays.",

Furthermore, statin-Dex exerted their immunomodulatory effects in vivo by decreasing the expression of CD80, CD86, and MHC class II on endogenous DCs. Importantly, the therapeutic effects of statin-Dex on EAMG rats were associated with up-regulated levels of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)/Treg and partly dependent on FasL/Fas pathway, which finally resulted in decreased synthesis of anti-R97-116 IgG, IgG2a, and IgG2b antibodies.",

Decreased OATP1B1 transport activity is often associated with increased systemic exposure of statins and statin-induced myopathy. Antimalarial drug chloroquine (CQ) is also used for long-term treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. CQ is lysosomotropic and inhibits protein degradation in lysosomes. The current studies were designed to determine the effects of CQ on OATP1B1 protein degradation, OATP1B1-mediated transport in OATP1B1-overexpressing cell line, and statin uptake in human sandwich-cultured hepatocytes (SCH). Treatment with lysosome inhibitor CQ increased OATP1B1 total protein levels in HEK293-OATP1B1 cells and in human SCH as determined by OATP1B1 immunoblot. In HEK293-FLAG-tagged OATP1B1 stable cell line, co-immunofluorescence staining indicated that intracellular FLAG-OATP1B1 is colocalized with lysosomal associated membrane glycoprotein (LAMP)-2, a marker protein of late endosome/lysosome. Enlarged LAMP-2-positive vacuoles with FLAG-OATP1B1 protein retained inside were readily detected in CQ-treated cells, consistent with blocking lysosomal degradation of OATP1B1 by CQ. In HEK293-OATP1B1 cells, without pre-incubation, CQ concentrations up to 100 \u03bcM did not affect OATP1B1-mediated [(3)H]E217G accumulation. However, pre-incubation with CQ at clinically relevant concentration(s) significantly decreased [(3)H]E217G and [(3)H]pitavastatin accumulation in HEK293-OATP1B1 cells and [(3)H]pitavastatin accumulation in human SCH.

In summary, the present studies report novel findings that lysosome is involved in degradation of OATP1B1 protein and that pre-incubation with lysosomotropic drug CQ downregulates OATP1B1 transport activity.

Candidate agents must be safe, well tolerated, effective, guideline recommended and physiochemically compatible with the other components of the pill. The Fuster-CNIC-Ferrer cardiovascular (CV) polypill has been found to be the first-in-class polypill to be approved and commercialized in Europe and Latinamerican Countries.

However, a substantial number of cases of CHD are not prevented and residual risk factors remain unsettled. A high triglyceride (TG) level is considered to be an important and residual risk factor. Postprandial hyperlipidemia is a condition in which TG-rich chylomicron remnants are increased during the postprandial period and hypertriglycedemia is protracted. Postprandial hyperlipidemia evokes atherogenesis during the postprandial period. Several prospective studies have revealed that nonfasting serum TG levels predict the incidence of CHD. Values of TG, remnant lipoprotein cholesterol, and remnant lipoprotein TG after fat loading were significantly higher in diabetes patients with insulin resistance than in diabetes patients without insulin resistance. Endothelial dysfunction is an initial process of atherogenesis and it contributes to the pathogenesis of CHD. Postprandial hyperlipidemia (postprandial hypertriglyceridemia) is involved in the production of proinflammatory cytokines, recruitment of neutrophils, and generation of oxidative stress, resulting in endothelial dysfunction in healthy subjects, hypertriglyceridemic patients, or type 2 diabetic patients. Effective treatment has not been established till date. Ezetimibe or omega-3 fatty acids significantly decrease postprandial TG elevation and postprandial endothelial dysfunction. Ezetimibe or omega-3 fatty acids added to statin therapy reduce serum TG levels and result in good outcomes in patients with CHD. In conclusion, postprandial hyperlipidemia is an important and residual risk factor especially in patients with insulin resistance syndrome (metabolic syndrome) and diabetes mellitus. Further studies are needed to establish effective treatment.",

There are very few published data on the consistency of the effects of a polypill in different patient populations. It is unclear for example whether the effects of the polypill are mainly driven by the individuals with high individual risk factor levels. The aim of the present study is to examine whether baseline risk factor levels modify the effect of polypill treatment on low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, blood pressure (BP), calculated cardiovascular relative risk reduction and adverse events.",

Calculated from individual risk factor reductions, the mean cardiovascular relative risk reduction was 48% (95% CI: 43-52) in the polypill group. Both baseline LDL-cholesterol and estimated cardiovascular risk were significant modifiers of the estimated cardiovascular relative risk reduction caused by the polypill. Adverse events did not appear to be related to baseline risk factor levels or the estimated cardiovascular risk.", 
    "225": "This study demonstrated that the effect of a cardiovascular polypill on risk factor levels is modified by the level of these risk factors. Groups defined by baseline LDL-cholesterol or systolic BP had large differences in risk factor reductions but only moderate differences in estimated cardiovascular relative risk reduction, suggesting also that patients with mildly increased risk factor levels but an overall raised cardiovascular risk benefit from being treated with a polypill."
