Observational studies, on the other hand, can complement this by demonstrating effectiveness (results under real-world conditions). To examine the role that observational studies can play in complementing data from RCTs, we reviewed published studies for statins, a class of drugs that have been widely used to reduce the risk of cardiovascular (CV) events by lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. RCTs have consistently demonstrated the benefits of statin treatment in terms of CV risk reduction and have demonstrated that more intensive statin therapy has incremental benefits over less intensive treatment. Observational studies of statin use in 'real-world' populations have served to augment the evidence base generated from statin RCTs in preselected populations of patients who are often at high CV risk and have led to similar safety and efficacy findings. They have also raised questions about factors affecting medication adherence, under-treatment, switching between statins, and failure to reach low-density lipoprotein cholesterol target levels, questions for which the answers could lead to improved patient care.",

However, fatal side-effects like rhabdomyolysis followed by acute renal necrosis sometimes occur. To elucidate biochemical changes resulting from the interaction of fibrates and statins, doses of 100 mg/kg fenofibrate, 50mg/kg clofibrate, 70 mg/kg atorvastatin and 200 mg/kg pravastatin as well as combinations thereof were administered to Crl:Wi(Han) rats for 4 weeks. Plasma metabolome profile was measured on study days 7, 14 and 28. Upon study termination, clinical pathology parameters were measured. In a separate experiment plasmakinetic data were measured in male rats after 1 week of drug administration in monotherapy as well as in combinations. Lowering of blood lipid levels as well as toxicological effects, like liver cell degradation (statins) and anemia (fibrates) and distinct blood metabolite level alterations were observed in monotherapy. When fibrates and statins were co-administered metabolite profile interactions were generally underadditive or at the utmost additive according to the linear mixed effect model. However, more metabolite levels were significantly altered during combination therapy. New effects on the antioxidant status and the cardiovascular system were found which may be related to a development of rhabdomyolysis. Accumulation of drugs during the combination therapy was not observed.",

This study tested the hypothesis that chronic NP exposure aggravated adenine (AD)-induced CKD that could be mitigated with rosuvastatin treatment. Fifty Wistar rats were randomly (n=10/each group) categorized into normal controls (N(C)), NP only (2.0mg/kg/day), AD only (0.25% AD in fodder), combined NP-AD, and NP-AD with rosuvastatin (20.0mg/kg/day) (NP-AD-R(OSU)). All animals received treatment for 24 weeks prior to being sacrificed. Results showed that ratio of urine protein to creatinine were increased in NP-AD group than in groups N(C), NP, and AD, but reduced in NP-AD-R(OSU) group compared with NP-AD group (all p<0.003). Protein expression of TGF-\u03b2 and phosphorylated Smad3, indexes of tissue fibrosis, were increased in NP-AD group than in groups N(C), NP and AD, but reduced in NP-AD-R(OSU) group compared with NP-AD group (all p<0.001). BMP-2 and phosphorylated Smad1/5, two indicators of anti-fibrosis, were lower in NP-AD group than in groups N(C), NP and AD, but higher in NP-AD-R(OSU) group compared with NP-AD group (all p<0.001). Protein expressions of JNK and PKC-\u03b1 in membranous compartment were higher in group NP-AD than in groups N(C), NP and AD, but reduced in NP-AD-R(OSU) group compared with NP-AD group (all p<0.001).

    "7": "One of the major indicators of intact endothelial function is basal nitric oxide (NO) activity. Further, it seems to be likely that statin therapy exerts beneficial effects on vascular function, at least in part via an improvement of NO bioavailability. In the present double-blind crossover study 29 hypercholesterolemic patients were randomly assigned to receive rosuvastatin and placebo for 42days. Pulse wave analysis was assessed after 30min of rest (baseline) and after infusion of N(G)-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-NMMA) at the end of 42days treatment period. The magnitude of the increase in central augmentation index (cAIx) in response to inhibition of NO synthase (NOS) by l-NMMA is indicative of basal NO activity. CAIx was significantly lower (18.3\u00b110 versus 21.9\u00b112%, p=0.027) with rosuvastatin compared to placebo. There was no increment of cAIx in response to l-NMMA in placebo group. In contrast, cAIx increased significantly in response to l-NMMA (20.5\u00b111 versus 25.7\u00b110mm Hg, p=0.001) in rosuvastatin group. The percentage of increase of cAIx tended to be more pronounced after treatment with rosuvastatin compared to placebo (53.7\u00b192 versus 14.1\u00b136%, p=0.087). Pulse pressure amplification (PPA) improved (1.31\u00b10.2 versus 1.26\u00b10.2%, p=0.016) after rosuvastatin compared to placebo. Regression analyses revealed that both LDL-cholesterol and CRP-levels are independent determinants of basal NO activity improvement, which itself is an independent determinant of vascular function, expressed by an improvement of pulse wave reflection and PPA. In this placebo controlled study, treatment with rosuvastatin improved vascular and endothelial function. Determinants for improved NO production in patients with hypercholesterolemia were the achieved levels of LDL-cholesterol and CRP. Overall, in patients without CV disease, rosuvastatin exerted beneficially effect on vascular dysfunction, one of the earliest manifestation of atherosclerosis.",

Moreover, they exert various effects (called \"pleiotropic\") independently of their lipid lowering actions. All of these effects interact with inflammation, thrombosis and vasoconstriction during the perioperative period. However, statins may also increase the risk of rhabdomyolysis, a rare but potentially lethal complication. In this article, we will describe the advantages and disadvantages of statin therapy during the perioperative period. Although in the past, withdrawal of statins was recommended before anesthesia, there is now evidence that statins must be continued or even must be introduced before surgery. We will try to identify relevant situations were statins are still under-prescribed before surgery.",

Statins are inhibitors of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase and are classed as lipid-lowering drugs. In 2010, atorvastatin was the biggest-selling drug in the world ($US10.73\u2009billion). Increases in the average age of pregnant women and in the prevalence of morbid obesity have inevitably led to exposure to statins in certain women during the first trimester of pregnancy. The teratogenic risk attendant upon use of statins is unclear because the available data are contradictory, but statins remain contraindicated in pregnant women. The benefits of statins in prevention of cardiovascular risk may not be solely due to their cholesterol-lowering effects: the so-called pleiotropic effects of vascular protection lead some experts to posit a potential benefit in the management of preeclampsia. In this review we evaluate the theoretical benefits and supposed risks of statins in pregnant women. After a brief overview of the pharmacodynamic properties of statins, we address the question of the teratogenic risk of statins, and then detail the rationale for the therapeutic potential of statins in preeclampsia.",

In addition, EPCs have been implicated in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, such that a decreased number of EPCs may not only be a risk indicator but also a potential therapeutic target. Of the many agents that have been examined to increase EPCs and enhance their function, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors or statins are one of the most intriguing. Accumulated evidence has demonstrated that statins promote EPC mobilization, proliferation, migration, adhesion, differentiation and reduce senescence and apoptosis independent of their serum lipid-lowering effect. This review summarizes the understanding of current mechanisms explaining the myriad of beneficial effects of statins on EPCs and discusses future challenges for studies involving statins and subpopulations of EPCs.

The existence of subclinical diseases highlights potential opportunities to intervene before the development of clinically apparent impairments. Our observations suggest that some such interventions already may exist to suppress processes of AD (statin therapy) or mVBI (treatment of hypertension). Reduced burden of LBD is associated with cigarette smoking; although smoking is not recommended as an intervention, these exposure data may provide clues to alternative neuroprotective mechanisms. Self reported anti-oxidant supplementation was without apparent effect in this cohort on indices of AD, mVBI, or LBD.

Recent reports have demonstrated that previous statin therapy reduced the risk of pneumonia or increased survival in patients with community-acquired pneumonia. However, the precise mechanisms responsible for these effects are unclear. In the present study, we examined the effects of statins on cytokine production from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated human bronchial epithelial cells (BEAS-2B). Interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-8 mRNA expression and protein secretion in LPS-stimulated cells were inhibited significantly by the lipophilic statin pitavastatin and the hydrophilic statin pravastatin. As these inhibitory effects of statin were negated by adding mevalonate, the anti-inflammatory effects of statins appear to be exerted via the mevalonic cascade. In addition, the activation levels of Ras homologue gene family A (RhoA) in BEAS-2B cells cultured with pitavastatin were significantly lower than those without the statin. These results suggest that statins have anti-inflammatory effects by reducing cytokine production through inhibition of the mevalonic cascade followed by RhoA activation in the lung.",

The liver is one of the most important organs that balances cholesterol metabolism. In order to investigate whether Nur77 is capable of regulating cholesterol metabolism in HepG2 cells and to demonstrate the underlying mechanism, the downregulation and upregulation of Nur77 expression in HepG2 cells was achieved by the transfection of siRNA specific to Nur77 and the transfection of the recombinant plasmid, pcDNA3.1-Nur77, respectively. Following the downregulation and upregulation of Nur77 expression, changes in the total cholesterol (TCHO) levels in HepG2 cells were observed based on lipid overloading. Thereafter, changes in a series of key gene expressions related to hepatic cholesterol metabolism were measured at the mRNA and protein levels by RT-PCR and western blot analysis, respectively. The TCHO levels in the HepG2 cells were found to increase following the downregulation of Nur77 expression and to decrease following the upregulation of Nur77 expression; these results were confirmed by oil red O staining of the cells. As for the hepatic cholesterol metabolism genes, low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and HMGCoA reductase (HMGCR) levels increased following the downregulation of Nur77 expression and decreased following the upregulation of Nur77 expression. However, liver X receptor \u03b1 (LXR\u03b1) expression did not change markedly along with that of Nur77. According to these findings, we conclude that Nur77 is capable of reducing hepatic cholesterol based on lipid overloading, and that this may be due to the decrease in LDLR and HMGCR levels.",

The optimal SV SNE tablet formulation was S3St10 (10% Labrafil, 60% Tween 80, and 30% Transcutol). The in-vivo evaluation of S3St10 revealed that rapid and enhanced absorption of SV could be obtained from the SNE based tablet, with a 1.5 fold increase in bioavailability than that obtained after administration of Zocor(\u00ae). Hence such an approach could be promising in improving the bioavailability of SV.",

Periodontal parameters between statin users and the normolipidemic group did not differ significantly. After adjusting for confounders, positive and significant correlations were observed between PD and TG, and TC and LDL, whereas CAL shared correlation with TC and LDL.

    "64": "The aims of this study were to identify how the solvent selection affects particle formation and to examine the effect of the initial drug solution concentration on mean particle size and particle size distribution in the supercritical antisolvent (SAS) process. Amorphous atorvastatin calcium was precipitated from seven different solvents using the SAS process. Particles with mean particle size ranging between 62.6 and 1493.7 nm were obtained by varying organic solvent type and solution concentration. By changing the solvent, we observed large variations in particle size and particle size distribution, accompanied by different particle morphologies. Particles obtained from acetone and tetrahydrofuran (THF) were compact and spherical fine particles, whereas those from N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) were agglomerated, with rough surfaces and relatively larger particle sizes. Interestingly, the mean particle size of atorvastatin calcium increased with an increase in the boiling point of the organic solvent used. Thus, for atorvastatin particle formation via the SAS process, particle size was determined mainly by evaporation of the organic solvent into the antisolvent phase. In addition, the mean particle size was increased with increasing drug solution concentration. In this study, from the aspects of particle size and solvent toxicity, acetone was the better organic solvent for controlling nanoparticle formation of atorvastatin calcium.",

A secondary analysis of data collected for the placebo arm (n = 2,078) of the Cholesterol and Recurrent Events (CARE) trial was performed. The CARE trial was a placebo-controlled trial aimed at testing the effect of pravastatin on patients after myocardial infarction. Patients with histories of CVD were excluded from the study. A Cox proportional-hazards model was used to evaluate the association between plausible risk factors (including lipid fractions) and risk for first incident CVD in patients after myocardial infarction. At the end of 5 years, 123 patients (6%) had incident CVD after myocardial infarction (76 with stroke and 47 with transient ischemic attack). Baseline non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level emerged as the only significant lipid risk factor that predicted CVD; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and HDL cholesterol were not significant. The adjusted hazard ratios (adjusted for age, gender, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and smoking) for CVD were 1.28 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.06 to 1.53) for non-HDL cholesterol, 1.14 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.37) for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and 0.90 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.09) for HDL cholesterol (per unit SD change of lipid fractions). This relation held true regardless of the level of triglycerides. After adjustment for age and gender, the hazard ratio for the highest natural quartile of non-HDL was 1.76 (95% CI 1.05 to 2.54), compared to 1.36 (95% CI 0.89 to 1.90) for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

Genome-wide association studies have also expanded our understanding of pharmacodynamic candidate genes, including RYR2. It is anticipated that deep resequencing efforts will define new loci with rare variants that also contribute, and sophisticated computational approaches will be needed to characterize gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. Beyond environment, race is a critical covariate, and its influence is only partly explained by geographic differences in the frequency of known pharmacodynamic and PK variants.

Previously, a genetic transformation system for S. islandicus was reported, in which overexpression of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase gene on the shuttle vector pSSR allowed the selection of transformants resistant to high concentrations of the thermostable antibiotic simvastatin.

In the present study, we investigated the expression and transport properties of human SLC17A4 protein. Using specific antibodies, we found that a human NPT homologue is specifically expressed and present in the intestinal brush border membrane. Proteoliposomes containing the purified protein took up radiolabeled p-aminohippuric acid (PAH) in a Cl(-)-dependent manner at the expense of an electrochemical gradient of protons, especially \u0394\u03c8, across the membrane. The \u0394\u03c8- and Cl(-)-dependent PAH uptake was inhibited by diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid and Evans blue, common inhibitors of SLC17 family members. cis-Inhibition studies revealed that various anionic compounds, such as hydrophilic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, pravastatin, and urate inhibited the PAH uptake. Proteoliposomes took up radiolabeled urate, with the uptake having properties similar to those of PAH uptake. These results strongly suggested that the human NPT homologue acts as a polyspecific organic anion exporter in the intestines.

Therefore, we focused on the role of endoglin in atherosclerosis in both humans and experimental animals. Endoglin expression was demonstrated in atherosclerotic vessels predominantly in endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells in various types of blood vessels in mice and humans, suggesting its participation in atherogenesis. Endoglin expression was also related to the expression of eNOS in endothelium, repair of the vessel wall, plaque neoangiogenesis, production of collagen and stabilization of atherosclerotic lesions. In addition, increased levels of soluble endoglin were associated with hypercholesterolemia, atherosclerosis, acute myocardial infarction and were related to inhibition of TGF-\u03b2 signaling in the vessel wall. Moreover, soluble endoglin levels were significantly lowered after a series of extracorporeal eliminations in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. Additionally, statin treatment decreased levels of soluble endoglin and increased its expression in aorta, which was related to reduced atherosclerosis in mice. In conclusion, we propose that measurement of soluble endoglin might give information about progression of the atherosclerotic process or the efficacy of therapeutic interventions, which is the task that must be answered in clinical trials.",

This post hoc analysis of the Treating to New Targets (TNT) trial examined whether the observed decrease in HF hospitalizations with high- compared to low-dose atorvastatin could be related to improvements in kidney function. Of 10,001 TNT participants, 9,376 had estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) measurements at baseline and 1 year and were included in this analysis. The association of change in year-1 eGFR and subsequent HF hospitalization was examined using Cox regression models. In total 218 participants developed subsequent HF hospitalization. Little change in eGFR occurred over 1 year in the atorvastatin 10-mg group, whereas eGFR improved in the 80-mg group by 1.48 ml/min/1.73 m(2) (95% confidence interval 1.29 to 1.67, p <0.0001). Subsequent HF was preceded by a decrease in eGFR over 1 year compared to modest improvement in those without subsequent HF (-0.09 \u00b1 7.89 vs 0.81 \u00b1 6.90 ml/min/1.73 m(2), p = 0.0015). After adjusting for baseline eGFR, each 5-ml/min/1.73 m(2) increase in eGFR at 1 year was associated with a lower risk of subsequent HF hospitalization (hazard ratio 0.85, 95% confidence interval 0.77 to 0.94, p = 0.002). This relation was independent of treatment effect or change in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level at 1 year. In conclusion, treatment with high- compared to low-dose atorvastatin was associated with improvement in eGFR at 1 year, which was related to a decrease in subsequent HF hospitalization. This suggests that improvement in kidney function may be related to the beneficial effect of high-dose atorvastatin on HF hospitalization.",

A total of 73 elderly hypertensive patients were enrolled to receive atorvastatin for 6 months. Brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) and circulating biomarkers were measured before and after the intervention. After 6 months of treatment, the patients experienced a 19.66% reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (2.90\u00b10.58 vs 2.33\u00b10.56 mmol/L, P<.01) and a 10.63% reduction in baPWV (2100.89\u00b1513.21 vs 1877.56\u00b1432.06 cm/s, P=.01). In addition, a 21.79% reduction in circulating N-(epsilon)-carboxymethyl-lysine and a 20% reduction in Von Willebrand factor level were observed after treatment. Meanwhile, the activity of copper/zinc-containing superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn SOD) was increased by 26.64% (5.04\u00b11.01 vs 6.87\u00b11.83 U/L, P<.001). Correlation analysis demonstrated that the increase of Cu/Zn SOD activity was related to the reductions of arterial stiffness (r=-0.340, P=.003). Taken together, these findings suggest that atorvastatin can improve arterial stiffness possibly by reducing oxidative stress levels in elderly hypertensive patients.",

Aspirin and celecoxib are the promising preventive agents to effectively reduce the risk of colorectal cancer, but such agents are associated with severe gastrointestinal and cardiovascular side effects in long-term administration at high doses. Recently, the strategy that combinational use with several chemopreventive agents at low doses induces greater inhibition of carcinogenesis has become the focus. The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may combine with ornithine decarboxylase inhibitors, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors, epidermal growth factor signaling inhibitors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 ligands, and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand, to magnify the chemoprophylactic effect. It is noteworthy that the phase III trial of difluoromethylornithine combination with sulidac has shown greater and effective preventive roles, which pave the way for the use of combinations of other agents. The long-term statins and low-dose NSAIDs have also been associated with risk reduction in vitro, in vivo, and in retrospective studies; however, the data are inconsistent. Epidermal growth factor signaling inhibitors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 ligands and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand have been demonstrated to potentiate the preventive effects of NSAIDs in vitro and in vivo, but these combinational regimens have not yet been applied to clinical research.

    "161": "This study presents a design of a highly potent and competitive inhibitory peptide for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMGR). HMGR is the major regulatory enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis and the target enzyme of many investigations aimed at lowering the rate of cholesterol biosynthesis. In previous studies, the two hypocholesterolemic peptides (LPYP and IAVPGEVA) were isolated and identified from soy protein. Based on these peptide sequences, a number of peptides were designed previously by using the correlation between the conformational flexibility and bioactivity. The design method that was applied in previous studies was slightly modified for the purpose of the current research and 12 new peptides were designed and synthesized. Among all peptides, SFGYVAE showed the highest ability to inhibit HMGR. A kinetic analysis revealed that this peptide is a competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA with an equilibrium constant of inhibitor binding (K (i)) of 12 \u00b1 0.4 nM. This is an overall 14,500-fold increase in inhibitory activity compared to the first isolated LPYP peptide from soybeans. Conformational data support a conformation of the designed peptides close to the bioactive conformation of the previously synthesized active peptides.", 
    "162": "To investigate the effect of simvastatin on the migration and invasion of fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and its cellular signal mechanisms, FLS from active RA patients were stimulated with 3 % FBS or GM-CSF in the presence or absence of simvastatin. Cells migration and invasion in vitro were measured by the Boyden chamber method. RhoA activity was assessed by a pull-down assay. Matrix metalloproteinases-2 (MMP-2) activity was evaluated by zymography. Simvastatin inhibits FBS- or GM-CSF-induced migration in a dose-dependent manner by RA FLS, and this inhibitory effect is independent of cell apoptosis. We also found that simvastatin suppressed in vitro invasion, adhesion, MMP-2 activity, cytoskeletal reorganization and RhoA activation. Furthermore, mevalonate or GGPP treatment reversed the inhibitory effect of simvastatin not only on migration and invasion in vitro but also on RhoA activation, and inhibition of RhoA by specific siRNA transfection reduced migration, adhesion and invasion of RA FLS. This study shows that simvastatin reduces RA FLS migration and invasion through the prevention of protein geranylgeranylation and RhoA activation. These findings provide a novel evidence that statin may be benefit for preventing RA arthritic destruction, and also indicate that RhoA may be a new target for the modulation of RA FLS migration and invasion.",

Alterations in the normal barrier function of the gut mucosa may result in the translocation of microbial cells and products. On the otherhand, it has been demonstrated that statin use is associated with a lower risk of mortality from bloodstream infections. Therefore, we investigated the ability of P. aeruginosa PAO1 to translocate across the Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell monolayers in the presence and absence of simvastatin. The bacteria readily translocated across MDCK cell monolayers after 3 h of infection irrespective of the presence or absence of the drug in the medium. However, the bacteria were less able to penetrate the MDCK monolayers in the presence of simvastatin than in its absence. A gentamicin survival assay demonstrated that simvastatin did not affect the bacteria's invasive behavior in the MDCK cells.",

    "167": "Both Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) and inclusion body myopathy with Paget's disease of bone and frontotemporal dementia (IBMPFD) are autosomal dominant genetic disorders. These two diseases are fully penetrant but with high heterogeneity in phenotypes, suggesting the involvement of genetic modifiers in modulating patients' phenotypes. Although NF1 is recognized as a developmental disorder and IBMPFD is associated with degeneration of multiple tissues, a recent study discovered the direct protein interaction between neurofibromin, the protein product of the NF1 gene, and VCP/p97, encoded by the causative gene of IBMPFD. Both NF1 and VCP/p97 are critical for dendritic spine formation, which provides the cellular mechanism explaining the cognitive deficits and dementia found in patients. Moreover, disruption of the interaction between neurofibromin and VCP impairs dendritic spinogenesis. Neurofibromin likely influences multiple downstream pathways to control dendritic spinogenesis. One is to activate the protein kinase A pathway to initiate dendritic spine formation; another is to regulate the synaptic distribution of VCP and control the activity of VCP in dendritic spinogenesis. Since neurofibromin and VCP/p97 also regulate cell growth and bone metabolism, the understanding of neurofibromin and VCP/p97 in neurons may be applied to study of cancer and bone. Statin treatment rescues the spine defects caused by VCP deficiency, suggesting the potential role of statin in clinical treatment for these two diseases.",

Forty-eight ovariectomized rats randomly received an implant in each tibia. One, 2, 4, and 12 weeks later, the tibiae were retrieved and prepared for histomorphometric evaluation. Bone-to-implant contact and bone area around the implant were determined, and histologic observations were made.", 
    "224": "New bone formation on test implant surfaces was seen after 1 week, while it was seen on the control implant surface after 2 weeks. There was more bone tissue and bone-to-implant contact along the test implant surfaces than along the control implant surface. The test group 1 and test group 2 implants showed significantly greater bone area and bone-to-implant contact compared to the control implant at all observed time points (P < .05). No differences were found between the two types of test group implants after 1, 2, 4, and 12 weeks (P > .05).", 
    "225": "Simvastatin-loaded porous implant surfaces have the potential to improve implant osseointegration in an ovariectomized rat model.", 
    "226": "Studies suggest a protective role for statins after intracerebral hemorrhage, but many failed to assess statin discontinuation, did not include postdischarge outcomes, or did not account for withdrawal of care. We studied the relationship between preintracerebral hemorrhage statin use and in-hospital statin discontinuation on stroke severity and 30-day mortality.", 
    "227": "We analyzed data from the Registry of the Canadian Stroke Network and determined the adjusted ORs for statin use and outcomes, controlling for stroke severity and other covariates.", 
    "228": "We analyzed 2466 consecutive patients with intracerebral hemorrhage from 2003 to 2008: median age was 71 years, 53.6% were male, and 30-day mortality rate was 36.5%. Overall, 537 (21.7%) were taking statins before presentation. Compared with nonusers, statin users were less likely to have severe strokes on presentation (54.7% versus 63.3%) but had similar rates of poor outcome (70% versus 67%) and 30-day mortality (36% versus 37%). Statins were discontinued on admission in 158 of 537 (29.4%); these patients were more likely to have severe stroke (65% versus 27%, P<0.01), poor outcome (90% versus 62%, P<0.01), and to have died by 30 days (71% versus 21%, P<0.01). After adjusting for stroke severity, statin discontinuation was still associated with poor outcome (adjusted OR, 2.4; 95% CI, 1.13-4.56) and higher mortality (adjusted OR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.30-3.04). However, these associations were attenuated and no longer significant after excluding patients treated palliatively.", 
    "229": "We found no association between preadmission statin use and outcomes in intracerebral hemorrhage. Statin discontinuation may worsen outcomes or may simply be a marker of worse underlying prognosis.", 
    "230": "To estimate the possible relationship between statin use and the risk of healthcare facility onset Clostridium difficile.", 
    "231": "Patients over 18 years of age admitted to hospitals contributing data to the University HealthSystem Consortium between 2002 and 2009 were eligible. Patients with the ICD-9-CM code 008.45 who received a minimum 3-day course of either metronidazole or oral vancomycin on/after day 5 of admission were considered incident cases of C difficile infection. 31,472 incident cases of C difficile infection were identified and matched to five controls, on hospital, year/quarter of admission date, and age \u00b110 years (N=78,096). Patients who were administered one drug in the statin class (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin or simvastatin) before the index date were considered to be exposed. Conditional logistic regression modelling provided adjusted odds ratios and 95% CI.", 
    "232": "Compared with non-users, users of any drug within the statin class were 0.78 times less likely to develop C difficile infection in the hospital (95% CI 0.75 to 0.81) adjusting for potential confounders. Differences in estimates for specific statins were minimal. Niacin, fibrates and selective cholesterol absorption inhibitors showed no association with the risk of C difficile infection.", 
    "233": "Our data were consistent with a growing body of literature demonstrating a reduced risk of infections with statin use. Statins' pleiotropic properties may provide protection against C difficile infection.", 
    "234": "To assess the difference in the prevalence of invariant Natural Killer T (iNKT) lymphocytes between hyperlipidemic and control individuals and to evaluate changes in iNKT cell levels after 6 months lipid lowering therapy.", 
    "235": "A total of 77 hyperlipidemic individuals (54 \u00b1 5 years) were assigned to simvastatin 40 mg or ezetimibe 10 mg daily for 6 months. Fifty individuals with normal cholesterol levels were used as control. iNKT cells were measured by flow cytometry in peripheral blood.", 
    "236": "Patients with hypercholesterolemia had significantly lower iNKT cell levels (percentage on the lymphocyte population) compared to control group (0.16 \u00b1 0.04% vs 0.39 \u00b1 0.08%, p = 0.03). iNKT cells significantly increased after 6 months treatment with simvastatin (from 0.15 \u00b1 0.04% to 0.28 \u00b1 0.11%, p = 0.03) but not with ezetimibe (from 0.16 \u00b1 0.05% to 0.17 \u00b1 0.06%, p = 0.55). Simvastatin treatment did not alter the activation status of iNKT cells as measured by HLA-DR expression. Changes of iNKT cells were independent from changes in total (r(2) = 0.009, p = 0.76) or LDL cholesterol (r(2) = 0.008, p = 0.78) reached by simvastatin.", 
    "237": "Hyperlipidemic patients have reduced numbers of iNKT in peripheral circulation compared to individuals with normal cholesterol levels. Their number is increasing after long term administration of simvastatin 40 mg but not after ezetimibe."
