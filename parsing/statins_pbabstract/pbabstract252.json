This change is partly accounted for by the change of endogenous sex hormones, especially in women. The incidence of dyslipidemia is not different between people of middle age and old age. However, the treatment is not the same in the two age groups. This is based on the idea that the impact of hyperlipidemia declines with age. There are some reports in which the significance of treatment of hyperlipidemia was examined: statin treatment appears beneficial for young-old people, while treatment of hyperlipidemia appears no longer beneficial for old-old people. Prospective study is needed before understanding the necessity of the treatment of hyperlipidemia in the old-old people.",

    "8": "To assess the effect of pravastatin on both circulation, in 20 postmenopausal female patients with hypercholesterolemia but a low probability of coronary artery disease, the forearm blood flow reserve (FBFR) using the plethysmographic method and coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR) by Doppler echocardiography were measured before, 4 and 8 weeks after starting the pravastatin and/or diet therapy. At baseline, CFVR and FBFR had a positive linear correlation (r=0.63, p<0.01) while each of them had a negative linear correlation (r=-0.53 to -0.63, p<0.05 each) with total or LDL-cholesterol levels. Four weeks after starting the pravastatin therapy when the decrease in total cholesterol reached a plateau, FBFR increased (p<0.05) by 38+/-14%, whereas CFVR did not. Such an increase in FBFR by pravastatin was related to the degree of total or LDL-cholesterol lowering.",

Compared with placebo, atorvastatin 20 mg/day was associated with significant reductions in TRL, IDL, and LDL apoB-100 pool size as a result of significant increases in fractional catabolic rate (FCR) without changes in production rate (PR). Compared with the 20 mg/day dose, atorvastatin 80 mg/day caused a further significant reduction in the LDL apoB-100 pool size as a result of a further increase in FCR. ApoB-48 pool size was reduced significantly by both atorvastatin doses, and this reduction was associated with nonsignificant increases in FCR. The lathosterol-campesterol ratio was decreased by atorvastatin treatment, and changes in this ratio were inversely correlated with changes in TRL apoB-100 and apoB-48 PR. No significant effect on apoA-I kinetics was observed at either dose of atorvastatin. Our data indicate that atorvastatin reduces apoB-100- and apoB-48-containing lipoproteins by increasing their catabolism and has a dose-dependent effect on LDL apoB-100 kinetics. Atorvastatin-mediated changes in cholesterol homeostasis may contribute to apoB PR regulation.", 
    "11": "ABC transporter A1 (ABCA1) mediates and rate-limits biogenesis of high density lipoprotein (HDL), and hepatic ABCA1 plays a major role in regulating plasma HDL levels. HDL generation is also responsible for release of cellular cholesterol. In peripheral cells ABCA1 is up-regulated by the liver X receptor (LXR) system when cell cholesterol increases. However, cholesterol feeding has failed to show a significant increase in hepatic ABCA1 gene expression, and its expression is up-regulated by statins (3-hydroy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors), suggesting distinct regulation. In this study we investigated the mechanism of regulation of the rat hepatic ABCA1 gene and identified two major ABCA1 transcripts and two corresponding promoter regions. Compactin activated the novel liver-type promoter in rat hepatoma McARH7777 cells by binding the sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 (SREBP-2). In contrast, compactin repressed the previously identified peripheral-type promoter in an LXR-responsive element-dependent but not E-box-dependent manner. Thus, compactin increased the liver-type transcript and decreased the peripheral-type transcript. The same two transcripts were also dominant in human and mouse livers, whereas the intestine contains only the peripheral-type transcript. Treatment of rats with pravastatin and a bile acid binding resin (colestimide), which is known to activate SREBP-2 in the liver, caused a reduction in the hepatic cholesterol level and the same differential responses in vivo, leading to increases in hepatic ABCA1 mRNA and protein and plasma HDL levels. We conclude that the dual promoter system driven by SREBP-2 and LXR regulates hepatic ABCA1 expression and may mediate the unique response of hepatic ABCA1 gene expression to cellular cholesterol status.", 
    "12": "Emerging evidence suggests that statins have a favorable impact on the reduction of arrhythmia events and sudden cardiac death in patients with structural heart disease. We aimed to investigate the possibly and directly favorable effects of statins on ventricular late potentials, QT dispersion, and transmural dispersion of repolarization attained by analyzing clinical electrocardiography (ECG) risk stratification parameters in patients with hypercholesterolemia without structural heart disease. In total, 82 patients (45 females; mean age, 62 +/- 10 years) with hypercholesterolemia were enrolled in this prospective study to examine the effects of statin therapy (atorvastatin 10 mg/day for 3 months) on ECG risk stratification parameters. Surface 12-lead ECG and signal-average ECG (SAECG) were recorded before and after statin treatment. The SAECG parameters, QT dispersion, Bazett-corrected QT (QTc) dispersion, T wave peak-to-end interval (Tpe), and percentage of Tpe/QT interval were calculated and compared before and after statin therapy. Twelve-lead ambulatory 24-hour ECGs were recorded in 12 patients. The results demonstrated that after statin therapy for 3 months, serum levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly reduced (both p values < 0.001). However, neither significant changes of each SAECG parameter nor the frequency of late potentials were demonstrated after atorvastatin therapy. In addition, no significant changes in QT dispersion, QTc dispersion, Tpe, or Tpe/QT were found. However, 24-hour ambulatory ECG revealed a flattening effect of circadian variation of QTc dispersion after atorvastatin therapy. In conclusion, the favorable antiarrhythmia effect of atorvastatin (10 mg/day) therapy cannot be directly reflected by analyzing these noninvasive ECG risk stratification parameters in low-risk patients with hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "13": "Elevated concentrations of total homocysteine as well as of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) in the blood have been reported to reflect an increased cardiovascular risk. ADMA is formed by endothelial cells and is an endogenous inhibitor of NO synthase. Earlier we have found that human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) produce homocysteine upon stimulation with mitogens concanavalin A, phytohaemagglutinin and pokeweed mitogen. In this study, the ability of PBMC to form ADMA and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA) was determined. Effects were compared with levels of cysteine, homocysteine and arginine in cultures. Increased concentrations of ADMA and SDMA were found in mitogen-stimulated compared with unstimulated PBMC. Arginine and cysteine concentrations did not differ between stimulated and unstimulated PBMC. There existed significant associations between concentrations of homocysteine and ADMA (Spearman rank correlation (rs) = 0.575) as well as SDMA (rs = 0.436, both P < 0.001). Treatment of stimulated PBMC with the anti-inflammatory compounds salicylic acid (5 mm) and atorvastatin (25 microm) decreased the rate of ADMA and SDMA formation. Results of these in vitro studies show that ADMA and SDMA formation coincides with homocysteine production in human PBMC. Activated PBMC not only release Th1-type cytokine gamma-interferon, which is the most important inducer of nitric oxide synthase, but also ADMA, a natural inhibitor of the enzyme.", 
    "14": "When pravastatin (40 mg/day) was co-administered with gemfibrozil (600 mg, b.i.d., 3 days) to man, the AUC of pravastatin increased approximately 2-fold. We have clarified that OATP1B1 is a key determinant of the hepatic uptake of pravastatin in humans. Thus, we hypothesized that gemfibrozil and the main plasma metabolites, a glucuronide (gem-glu) and a carboxylic acid metabolite (gem-M3), might inhibit the hepatic uptake of pravastatin and lead to the elevation of the plasma concentration of pravastatin. Gemfibrozil and gem-glu inhibited the uptake of (14)C-pravastatin by human hepatocytes with K(i) values of 31.7 microM and 15.7 microM, respectively and also inhibited pravastatin uptake by OATP1B1-expressing Xenopus laevis oocytes with K(i) values of 15.1 microM and 7.6 microM. Additionally, we examined the biliary transport of pravastatin and demonstrated that pravastatin was transported by MRP2 using both human canalicular membrane vesicles (hCMVs) and human MRP2-expressing vesicles. However, gemfibrozil, gem-glu and gem-M3 did not affect the biliary transport of pravastatin by MRP2. Considering the plasma concentrations of gemfibrozil and gem-glu in humans, the inhibition of OATP1B1-mediated hepatic uptake of pravastatin by gem-glu would contribute, at least in part, to the elevation of plasma concentration of pravastatin by the concomitant use of gemfibrozil.",

Less than 10% of new compounds that enter clinical trials ultimately make it to the market, and many more fail in the preclinical stages of development.

    "16": "The influences of salicylic acid (SA) on taxol production and isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) biosynthesis pathways in suspension cultures of Taxus chinensis var. mairei were investigated by adding SA and mevastatin (MVS), a highly specific inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase in the mevalonate pathway for IPP biosynthesis, into the culture systems. The cell death and taxol production were induced upon the introduction of SA, and 20mg/l was proved to be the optimal SA concentration in terms of the less damage to Taxus cells and marked activation of phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL). In the coexistence of SA (20mg/l) and MVS (100 nmol/l), the taxol content (1.626 mg/g dry wt) was higher than that (0.252 mg/g dry wt) of the MVS-treated system but almost equal to that (1.581 mg/g dry wt) of the SA-treated system. It is thus inferred that the activated non-mevalonate pathway should be responsible for the formation of IPP in taxol biosynthesis in the presence of SA.", 
    "17": "The treatment of traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains limited, and aside from surgical hematoma evacuation, clinical management is largely supportive and directed toward management of cerebral edema and intracranial hypertension. Secondary neuronal injury caused by ischemia and the development of cerebral edema may occur in the subacute phase, with intracranial pressures often peaking in the first several days following injury. Because inflammation contributes significantly to the pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia and endothelial dysfunction underlies the development of cerebral edema, therapeutic strategies that target the post-traumatic inflammatory cascade and reduce endothelial dysfunction hold enormous potential to improve clinical outcomes after TBI. Statins inhibit inflammation by suppressing inflammatory cytokine release, and by interfering with multiple steps of leukocyte recruitment and migration into the CNS. In this study, we demonstrate that treatment with atorvastatin and simvastatin markedly reduced functional neurological deficits after traumatic brain injury in mice. These effects were accompanied by histological reduction in degenerating hippocampal neurons and suppression of inflammatory cytokine mRNA expression in brain parenchyma. Furthermore, statin treatment improved cerebral hemodynamics following head injury. Thus, the administration of statins may represent a viable therapeutic strategy in the acute treatment of closed head injury.", 
    "18": "To date, a number of hypotheses of the cause of Alzheimer's disease, the most common form of dementia, have been postulated. The beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) is the major constituent of senile plaques, which together with atrophy and neurofibrillary tangles, is the main neuropathological finding in Alzheimer's disease. It is a widely accepted theory that aggregation of Abeta into plaques is an initial event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, driving neurodegeneration. The cholesterol hypothesis, primarily based on in vitro and animal studies, states that increased levels of cholesterol promote the production of Abeta. Furthermore, treating animals with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors ('statins'; cholesterol-lowering agents), or adding these agents to cell culture, results in decreased production of Abeta. This 'positive' effect of statin treatment has further been verified by some, but not all, longitudinal studies where a reduced prevalence of Alzheimer's disease is seen among patients taking statins. These findings have together been interpreted to indicate that statins act via a cholesterol-dependent mechanism, reducing the production of Abeta and, hence, the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. This review focuses on the cholesterol hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease and investigations into its validity in the clinical setting, i.e. the outcome of clinical trials where the effect of statin treatment on Abeta production has been studied. To date, the cholesterol hypothesis has not been shown to be valid in clinical trials. We hypothesise that the vascular contributions in Alzheimer's disease may be one possible mechanism for statins to interfere with the disease process and reduce the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease. We also suggest that statins may act through the inflammatory pathway. Both of these mechanistic suggestions are good candidates, supported by the literature, for the underlying mechanistic link between statin treatment and a reduced prevalence for Alzheimer's disease.", 
    "19": "Mixed hyperlipidemia is a major cause of coronary artery disease. Monotherapy with statins is considered the gold standard for treatment of mixed hyperlipidemia. But greater benefit may be expected by combination therapy. Combination may allow lower doses of statins and less adverse effects. Hence, this preliminary study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of low-dose atorvastatin in combination with fenofibrate in patients with mixed hyperlipidemia. Ninety patients were assigned into three groups and received atorvastatin (10-40 mg/day) or fenofibrate (160-200 mg/day) or combination of low-dose atorvastatin (5 mg/day) and fenofibrate (160 mg/day). There was a significant decrease in low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglycerides (TG) and total cholesterol (TC), and a significant increase in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in all the groups at the end of therapy. Combination therapy produced maximum decrease in LDL, TG and TC, and maximum increase in HDL when compared with monotherapies. No significant difference was reported in safety profile between the two groups. To conclude, the results suggest that combination therapy with low-dose atorvastatin and fenofibrate is more efficacious, with no increase in adverse effects when compared with monotherapies with individual drugs for mixed hyperlipidemia. The results are preliminary and suggestive only, as the study was open and nonrandomized.",

The lowered CCR5 expression was associated with down-regulation of CCR5 mRNA expression. The CC-chemokine RANTES protein and mRNA expression levels were slightly increased in CD4(+) enriched lymphocytes treated with statins. Both R5 and X4 HIV-1 were reduced for their infection of statin-treated cells; however, in cultures where statins were removed and where a decrease in CCR5 expression was observed, there was a preferential inhibition of infection with an R5 versus X4 virus.", 
    "23": "The results indicate that the modulation of CC-chemokine receptor (CCR5) and CC-chemokine (RANTES) expression levels should be considered as contributing to the anti-viral effects of statins, preferentially inhibiting R5 viruses. This observation, in combination with the immunomodulatory activity exerted by statins, suggests they may possess more potent anti-HIV-1 activity when applied during the early stages of infection or in lowering viral transmission. Alternatively, statin treatment could be considered as a way to modulate immune induction such as during vaccination protocols.",

    "28": "Although substantial epidemiological studies have failed to find a correlation between cholesterol levels and stroke, clinical trials have shown that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (or statins, the most potent hypocholesterolemic drugs available) greatly reduce the incidence of stroke. These clinical observations have opened the way to a number of studies of the non-cholesterol-dependent (or pleiotropic) effects in animal models of stroke, indicating that the neuroprotection is attributable to multiple activities. One of the main protective mechanisms elicited by statin administration is the increase in nitric oxide bioavailability that regulates cerebral perfusion and improves endothelial function, but others include antioxidant properties, the inhibition of inflammatory responses, immunomodulatory actions, the regulation of progenitor cells, and the stabilization of atherosclerotic plaques. Many of these effects are due to the inhibited synthesis of isoprenoid intermediates, which serve as lipid attachments for a variety of intracellular signaling molecules.

Therefore, treatment should consider the beneficial properties of drugs used to treat either condition. Statins, the mainstay of lipid-lowering therapy, result in a significant clinical benefit both in primary and secondary CVD prevention. In addition to their hypolipidemic capacity, other properties may contribute to statin-induced benefits. Clinical and experimental evidence indicates that statins may modulate blood pressure (BP). The mechanisms by which statins reduce BP seem to be largely independent of their lipid effects. Although small, reductions in BP are possibly clinically relevant. Large landmark studies confirm that statins can reduce CVD risk in hypertensive patients. These findings suggest that statins could be prescribed as an adjunct in treating hypertension with dyslipidemia or even in patients with \"normal\" cholesterol levels. Whether the effect of statins on BP is accompanied by an additional decrease in clinical outcomes needs to be investigated in long-term, large-scale trials.",

It has been well documented that GBS are able to invade a variety of nonphagocytic host cell types, and this process is thought to involve a number of pathogen-host cell interactions. While some of the molecular aspects of the GBS-host cell invasion process have been characterized, many events still remain unclear. The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the role of the Rho-family GTPases Rac, Rho, and Cdc42 in GBS invasion into epithelial cells. The epithelial cell invasion process was modeled using HeLa 229 cell culture. Treatment of HeLa cells with 10 microM compactin, a pan-GTPase inhibitor, abolished GBS internalization, suggesting that GTPases are involved in the GBS invasion process. The addition of Toxin B or exoenzyme C3 to HeLa cells before GBS infection reduced invasion by 50%, further suggesting that the Rho-family GTPases are involved in GBS entry. Examining invasion of GBS into HeLa cells with altered genetic backgrounds was used to confirm these findings; GBS invasion into HeLa cells transiently transfected with dominant negative Rac1, Cdc42, or RhoA reduced invasion by 75%, 51%, and 42%, respectively. Results of this study suggest that the Rho-family GTPases are required for efficient invasion of HeLa cells by GBS.", 
    "52": "Hyperlipidaemia, i.e. increase in total cholesterol and triglycerides, is a common side-effect of the immunosuppressive drugs rapamycin (RAPA) and cyclosporine A (CsA), and is probably related to inhibition of the 27-hydroxylation of cholesterol (acid pathway of bile acid biosynthesis). This might be one of the causes for the increase in plasma cholesterol, as 27-hydroxycholesterol is a potent suppressor of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR), a key enzyme of cholesterol synthesis. As the sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1) inhibition by CsA is well known, we evaluated the effect of another immunosuppressive drug, RAPA, on this enzyme in HepG2 mitochondria, which confirmed the dose-dependent inhibition of mitochondrial CYP27A1 by cyclosporine (10-20 microM), while the inhibition by RAPA required a higher dose (50-100 microM). Corresponding K(i) was 10 microM for CsA (non-competitive inhibition) and 110 microM for RAPA (competitive inhibition). Cotreatment with both immunosuppressive drugs showed an additive inhibitory effect on CYP27A1 activity. Later, we analysed the effect of these immunosuppressants on HMGR expression in HepG2 cells, and a dose-dependent up-regulation of HMGR gene expression was observed. The results suggest that RAPA and CsA are both inhibitors of CYP27A1 activity with slightly different mechanisms and that they may accordingly increase HMGR expression.",

At dose level 2, one patient on doxorubicin took more than 4 weeks to lose her hair and another on docetaxel retained some hair throughout her chemotherapy. At level 3, one patient had grade 2 hair loss at week 4 and another on docetaxel for 6 cycles showed evidence of hair growth between cycles.

    "56": "Endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells are the major cells that constitute blood vessels, and endothelial cells line the lumen of blood vessels. These 2 types of cells also play an integral role in the regional specialization of vascular structure. On the basis of these observations, we designed our study to investigate the effect of various statins on CYP expression in endothelial cells. 3-hydroxymethyl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors play an important role in vascular function. The majority of the statins available on the market show extensive metabolism by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Both cell types are involved in the bioconversion of arachidonic acid into vasoactive compounds. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the effect of statins on cytochrome P450 expression in endothelial cells. Our results show that endothelial cells expressed both CYPs involved in epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) and hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) production and the nuclear receptor implicated in cytochrome P450 regulation. Treatment of endothelial cells with lovastatin increased CYP2C9 expression. After 96 hours of treatment, fluvastatin and lovastatin clearly increased CYP2C9 protein level. CAR but not PXR was expressed in endothelial cells, indicating that the upregulating effect of statins on CYP2C9 in endothelial cells could be mediated through CAR only due to the lack of expression of PXR in these cells.", 
    "57": "Statins may directly interfere with the effects of angiotensin (Ang) II, which is a key player in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis (ATH). Ang II promotes a wide array of detrimental processes including a prominent proinflammatory effect, increasingly regarded as a target for therapeutic intervention. Because the proinflammatory effects of Ang II are exerted mainly through the activation of Ang II type 1 receptors (AT1Rs) the present study was devised to investigate by means of real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and flow cytometry techniques the expression of such receptors on circulating polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) from subjects at high risk for vascular events before and during treatment with simvastatin and in sex- and age-matched healthy controls. In vitro experiments were also performed to assess the ability of simvastatin to interfere with Ang II signaling in human PMNs. In comparison to controls, high-risk subjects had similar AT1R expression on the cell membranes but significantly higher AT1R messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels. Treatment of high-risk subjects with simvastatin for 30 days resulted in a reduction of AT1R mRNA down to the levels of cells from healthy subjects. In vitro, Ang II-induced activation of the guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-binding protein Rac 1 in human PMNs was inhibited by simvastatin. In conclusion, simvastatin induces downregulation of AT1R expression, interferes with Ang II activity in PMNs, and contributes to the antiinflammatory profile of statins that can explain the therapeutic effects of these drugs.",

Meta-regression analysis showed a strong correlation between the change in LDL and CRP (r = 0.80, p < 0.001). Statin therapies had no significant effect on CRP after adjusting for the change in LDL. In a multivariate model applied to a range of LDL reduction typically seen with statins (20% to 60%), 89% to 98% of CRP change was related to LDL lowering and 2% to 11% was related to non-LDL effects of statins.",

    "71": "This study aimed to investigate the effect of the Rho-kinase inhibitor fasudil on the development of diabetic nephropathy and clarify a contribution of the Rho/Rho-kinase pathway to the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. Diabetes was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats with an intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin. Animals were then divided into the following 4 groups; normal control rats, diabetic rats, diabetic rats administered fasudil orally and diabetic rats administered fluvastatin (3-hydroxy-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, statin) orally. After 1 month of treatment, neither fasudil nor statin had any influence on blood glucose or blood pressure in diabetic rats. While urinary excretion of albumin and 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) was increased in diabetic rats, both of these increases were abolished by fasudil and statin. Rho activity was enhanced in the renal cortex of diabetic rats compared to normal controls, and this enhancement was abolished by statin treatment. Expression of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) mRNA was up-regulated in the renal cortex of diabetic rats, and this was abolished by fasudil as well as statin. Expression of NOX4 mRNA (catalytic subunit of NAD(P)H oxidase) was up-regulated in the renal cortex of diabetic rats, an effect which was also abolished by fasudil as well as statin. The present study demonstrates that the Rho/Rho-kinase pathway is involved in up-regulation of TGF-beta, CTGF and NAD(P)H oxidase in diabetic kidney. We conclude that suppression of the Rho/Rho-kinase pathway could be a new strategy for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy.",

    "81": "Hypertriglyceridemia is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events and acute pancreatitis. Along with lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and raising high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, lowering triglyceride levels in high-risk patients (e.g., those with cardiovascular disease or diabetes) has been associated with decreased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Although the management of mixed dyslipidemia is controversial, treatment should focus primarily on lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Secondary goals should include lowering non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (calculated by subtracting high-density lipoprotein cholesterol from total cholesterol). If serum triglyceride levels are high, lowering these levels can be effective at reaching non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals. Initially, patients with hypertriglyceridemia should be counseled about therapeutic lifestyle changes (e.g., healthy diet, regular exercise, tobacco-use cessation). Patients also should be screened for metabolic syndrome and other acquired or secondary causes. Patients with borderline-high serum triglyceride levels (i.e., 150 to 199 mg per dL [1.70 to 2.25 mmol per L]) and high serum triglyceride levels (i.e., 200 to 499 mg per dL [2.26 to 5.64 mmol per L]) require an overall cardiac risk assessment. Treatment of very high triglyceride levels (i.e., 500 mg per dL [5.65 mmol per L] or higher) is aimed at reducing the risk of acute pancreatitis. Statins, fibrates, niacin, and fish oil (alone or in various combinations) are effective when pharmacotherapy is indicated.", 
    "82": "CD40, a member of the TNF receptor superfamily, is critical for productive immune responses. Macrophages constitutively express CD40 at low levels, which are enhanced by IFN-gamma. IFN-gamma-induced CD40 expression involves activation of STAT-1alpha as well as NF-kappaB activation through an autocrine response to IFN-gamma-induced TNF-alpha production. Statins are 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase inhibitors, which exert anti-inflammatory effects independent of their cholesterol-lowering actions. Herein, we describe that simvastatin (SS) inhibits IFN-gamma-induced CD40 expression via the suppression of STAT-1alpha expression. This results in diminished STAT-1alpha recruitment to the CD40 promoter upon IFN-gamma treatment, in addition to reduced RNA Polymerase II recruitment and diminished levels of H3 and H4 histone acetylation. SS-mediated inhibition of STAT-1alpha occurs through suppression of constitutive STAT-1alpha mRNA and protein expression. The inhibitory effect of SS on CD40 and STAT-1alpha is dependent on HMG-CoA reductase activity, as the addition of mevalonate reverses the inhibitory effect. In addition, CD40 and/or STAT-1alpha expression is inhibited by GGTI-298 or Clostridium difficile Toxin A, a specific inhibitor of Rho family protein prenylation, indicating the involvement of small GTP-binding proteins in this process. Collectively, these data indicate that SS inhibits IFN-gamma-induced CD40 expression by suppression of STAT-1alpha, and altering transcriptional events at the CD40 promoter.",

Among live-born infants, we selected as cases infants with any congenital anomaly diagnosed in the first year of life. Controls were defined as infants with no congenital anomalies.

    "87": "Statins stimulate bone formation in vitro and in vivo and, when given in large doses or by prolonged infusions, stimulate biomechanical strength of murine long bones with healing fractures. However, administration of statins by large oral doses or prolonged infusions to a fracture site is not a feasible therapeutic approach to hasten healing of human fractures. We administered lovastatin in biodegradable polymer nanobeads of poly(lactic-co-glycolide acid) to determine if lovastatin delivered in low doses in nanoparticles of a therapeutically acceptable scaffold could increase rates of healing in a standard preclinical model of femoral fracture. We found that these nanobeads: (1) stimulated bone formation in vitro at 5 ng/mL, (2) increased rates of healing in femoral fractures when administered as a single injection into the fracture site, and (3) decreased cortical fracture gap at 4 weeks as assessed by microcomputed tomography. These preclinical results suggest that lovastatin administered in a nanobead preparation may be therapeutically useful in hastening repair of human fractures.",

Though low cholesterol levels have been associated with depression and suicide, lipid-lowering agents have not been associated with these adverse effects. Finally, cardiovascular medications may have beneficial neuropsychiatric consequences; for example, the use of clonidine in patients with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder, the use of prazosin for patients with post-traumatic stress disorder; and the use of propranolol for performance anxiety and akathisia.",

In comparison, wound tissue from SIM group displayed leukocyte infiltration significantly lower than that observed in SAL group (p<0.05). Culture results of the samples taken from wound fluid on fourth post treatment day revealed wound infection in only one rat of group simvastatin (SIM), where Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter sp were isolated.

Because many of these behaviors cannot be measured easily, observational studies of outcomes associated with the long-term use of preventive therapies are subject to the so-called \"healthy user bias.\" To better understand this effect, the authors examined the association between adherence to statin therapy and the use of preventive health services in a Pennsylvania cohort of 20,783 new users of statins between 1996 and 2004. After adjustment for age, gender, and various comorbid conditions, patients who filled two or more prescriptions for a statin during a 1-year ascertainment period were more likely than patients who filled only one prescription to receive prostate-specific antigen tests (hazard ratio (HR)=1.57, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.17, 2.19), fecal occult blood tests (HR=1.31, 95% CI: 1.12, 1.53), screening mammograms (HR=1.22, 95% CI: 1.09, 1.38), influenza vaccinations (HR=1.21, 95% CI: 1.12, 1.31), and pneumococcal vaccinations (HR=1.46, 95% CI: 1.17, 1.83) during follow-up.

The protective effect was much stronger for the C vs. T promoter allele. Expression studies confirmed the stimulatory influence of SREBP-2 was significantly stronger for the C promoter. Simvastatin up-regulated promoter activity of the C allele, but had a minor effect on the T allele. Hypercholesterolemic patients homozygous for the C allele showed a significant increase in serum paraoxonase-1 activity and mass during treatment with simvastatin, whereas patients homozygous for the T allele showed no increase.",

We have previously identified a similar phenotype in cystic fibrosis (CF) cell models that results in the activation of the small GTPase RhoA. The hypothesis of this study was that NPC cells would also exhibit an increase in small GTPase activation. An examination of the active, GTP-bound form of GTPases revealed a basal increase in the content of the active-form Ras and RhoA small GTPases in NPC fibroblasts compared to wt controls. To assess whether this increase in GTP-bound Ras and RhoA manifests a functional outcome, the expression of the proliferation control proteins p21/waf1 and cyclin D were examined. Consistent with increased GTPase signaling, p21/waf1 expression is reduced and cyclin D expression is elevated in NPC fibroblasts. Interestingly, cell growth rate is not altered in NPC fibroblasts compared to wt cells. However, NPC sensitivity to statin treatment is reversed by addition of the isoprenoid geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), a modifier of RhoA. It is concluded that Ras and RhoA basal activation is elevated in NPC fibroblasts and has an impact on cell survival pathways.", 
    "124": "Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) consist of an interaction of neuropathy, ischemia and infection. Neuropathy affects sensory, motor and autonomic pathways. Pathogenic factors for neuropathy include hyperglycemia, nonenzymatic glycosylation, oxidative stress, ischemic and hypoxic factors, nerve growth factor anomalies, activation of polyol pathway and immunologic abnormalities. All these factors are stated to contribute to microvascular disease and neural dysfunction. Peripheral neuropathy and ischemia combined with repetitive traumas can lead to diabetic foot ulceration. Fifteen percent of diabetic patients develop foot ulcers during their lifetime and nonhealing ulcers are responsible for 85% of nontraumatic lower extremity amputation. On the other hand, the treatment cost of foot disease in diabetic patients is estimated at $1 billion annually. When these conditions are considered, it is very important to design improved and novel strategies for treatment and prevention of diabetic foot disease. Lipid-lowering agents, such as statins, have been shown to prevent cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes. However, in addition, to preventing macrovascular diseases, statins may also be able to retard the progression of microvascular complications of diabetes. Statins alter the balance between vasodilatation and vasoconstriction in favor of vasodilatation by increasing nitric oxide (NO) synthesis, by downregulating endothelin 1 (ET-1) synthesis and reducing vascular response to angiotensin-2 (AT-2). These agents have been shown to augment cerebral blood flow by upregulating endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOs) and to reduce cerebral infarct size in a murine model of cerebral ischemia. In addition, recent in vivo and in vitro investigations have evidenced that statins have a favorable effect on diabetic peripheral neuropathy independent of its lipid-lowering effect by demonstrating restoration or preservation of microcirculation of the sciatic nerve. We hypothesized that statins can be useful for the prevention and treatment of diabetic foot. Possible mechanisms include the reduction of neuropathy and ischemia or through growth factors, the effectiveness of which has been shown for fracture healing in animal models.",

However, poor viability of transplanted MSCs in the infracted heart has limited the therapeutic efficacy. Our previous studies have shown in vitro that rat MSCs undergo caspase-dependent apoptosis in response to hypoxia and serum deprivation (Hypoxia/SD). Recent findings have implicated statins, an established class of cholesterol-lowering drugs, enhance the survival of cells under various conditions. In this study, we investigated the effect of lovastatin on rat MSCs apoptosis induced by Hypoxia/SD, focusing in particular on regulation of mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and the survival signaling pathways. We demonstrated that lovastatin (0.01-1 microM) remarkably prevented MSCs from Hypoxia/SD-induced apoptosis through inhibition of the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway, leading to attenuation of caspase-3 activation. The loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and cytochrome-c release from mitochondria to cytosol were significantly inhibited by lovastatin. Furthermore, the antiapoptotic effect of lovastatin on mitochondrial apoptotic pathway was effectively abrogated by both PI3K inhibitor, LY294002 and ERK1/2 inhibitor, U0126. The phosphorylations of Akt/GSK3 beta and ERK1/2 stimulated by lovastatin were detected. The activation of ERK1/2 was inhibited by a PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, but U0126, a ERK1/2 inhibitor did not inhibit phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3 beta. These data demonstrate that lovastatin protects MSCs from Hypoxia/SD-induced apoptosis via PI3K/Akt and MEK/ERK1/2 pathways, suggesting that it may prove a useful therapeutic adjunct for transplanting MSCs into damaged heart after myocardial infarction.",

This results in an accumulation of 7- and 8-dehydrocholesterol (7 + 8-DHC) and, in most patients, a deficiency of cholesterol. Current therapy consists of dietary cholesterol supplementation, which raises plasma cholesterol levels, but clinical effects have been reported in only a few patients. Hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors were shown to reduce 7 + 8-DHC levels and increase cholesterol concentrations in two small trials with divergent clinical outcome. This retrolective study evaluates the effects of cholesterol only and of cholesterol plus the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin on plasma sterols in 39 SLOS patients and on anthropometric measures in 20 SLOS patients. Cholesterol as well as additional simvastatin decreased the plasma (7 + 8-DHC)/cholesterol ratio. However, the mechanism leading to the decreasing ratio was different. Whereas it was due to an increasing cholesterol concentration in the cholesterol-only cohort, a decreasing 7 + 8-DHC concentration was demonstrated in the cohort receiving additional simvastatin.

Statins reduced the amount of lipid by 22% in patients with osteoporosis, 26% in patients with osteoarthritis, and 41% in patients with osteonecrosis compared with pretreatment lipid levels in the same patients. Taking fish oils reduced the amount of lipid in bone marrow by 20%. Lipid profiles of disturbed marrow and joint fluid from patients who took statins or dietary fish oil showed an increase in the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids and longer-chain fatty acids relative to pretreatment profiles. The ability to change the amount and character of bone and joint lipids may have major importance for strengthening bone, reducing the severity or preventing osteonecrosis, and enhancing joint lubrication.",

Hypertension: target blood pressure should be 140/90 mmHg or lower, but for those with diabetes or renal disease, 130/80 mmHg or lower. For patients without proteinuria, antihypertensive therapy should be initiated with a calcium channel blocker and for those with proteinuria, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker. If monotherapy fails to achieve adequate response, calcium channel blockers and ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers should be combined. If hypertension remains uncontrolled, an alpha-blocker may be added. Consideration should be given to changing immunosuppression and avoiding use of calcineurin inhibitors. Diabetes: recipients should be regularly screened for diabetes. For patients with new-onset diabetes after transplant, stepwise therapy should be guided by HbA1c concentrations, as with type II diabetes mellitus. Hyperlipidemia: annual screening of lipid profile should be undertaken, with treatment thresholds and targets based on those advocated for the high risk general population. Dietary intervention is appropriate for all patients. A statin should be considered as the first line treatment to achieve specified targets. In patients receiving a calcineurin inhibitor, Pravastatin should be commenced at a dose of 10 mg/day. In patients receiving other forms of immunosuppression, pravastatin may be commenced at a dose of 20 mg/day. Liver tests should be monitored and patients warned to report myalgia.

Although these studies have focused primarily on the ability of statins to lower circulating levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, more recent research has shown that statins may protect the vasculature via pleiotropic effects not directly related to lipid lowering. These include adjustments in cell-signaling pathways that play a role in atherogenesis and that affect the expression of inflammatory elements, curtail oxidative stress, and enhance endothelial function. More recently, researchers have begun to explore whether these agents exert similar beneficial effects in renal parenchymal and renovascular disease. This review examines the available evidence that dyslipidemia may augment the inflammatory reaction of cytokines in patients with renal disease and that statins may improve renal dysfunction by altering the response of the kidney to dyslipidemia, even in persons with end-stage renal disease on dialysis or with renal transplantation.

Our work aims to eliminate PrP(c) as substrate for the conversion into PrP(Sc) and to increase the cellular clearance capacity of PrP(Sc). In order to achieve the first objective, we used chemical compounds which interfere with the subcellular trafficking of PrP(c), e.g. by intracellular re-routing. Recently, we found that PrP(c) requires cholesterol for cell surface localisation. Treatment with mevinolin significantly reduced the amount of cell surface PrP(c) and led to its accumulation in the Golgi compartment. These data show that cholesterol is essential for the cell surface localisation of PrP(c), which is in turn known to be necessary for the formation of PrP(Sc). Another anti-prion strategy uses RNA and peptide aptamers directed against PrP(c). We have selected peptide aptamers using a constrained peptide library presented on the active site loop of the Escherichia coli protein TrxA in a Y2H screen. Several peptides reproducibly binding to PrP(c) in several assays were identified. Preliminary data indicate that selected peptide aptamers are able to interfere with prion propagation in prion-infected cells. To obtain additive effects we have tried to clarify cellular mechanisms that enable cells to clear prion infectivity. This goal was achieved by selective interference in intracellular signalling pathways which apparently also increase the cellular autophagy machinery. Finally, we have tried to establish an active auto-vaccination approach directed against PrP, which gave some positive preliminary results in the mouse system. This might open the door to classical immunological interference techniques.", 
    "169": "To determine whether statin therapy improves survival in patients with heart failure (HF) secondary to nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (non-IDC), data from 1,024 patients with non-IDC (New York Heart Association functional class III and IV HF) and left ventricular ejection fraction < or =0.35 who were enrolled in the BEST were analyzed. The association of statin therapy at the initial screening visit with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality was evaluated using multivariate Cox proportional hazards models. After adjusting for age, gender, race, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, New York Heart Association functional class IV, estimated glomerular filtration rate, current cigarette smoking, left ventricular ejection fraction, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor use, antiplatelet therapy, diabetes mellitus, treatment group (beta blocker or placebo), and hypertension, statin use was independently associated with decreased all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 0.38, confidence interval 0.18 to 0.82, p = 0.0134) and also with decreased cardiovascular death (hazard ratio 0.42, confidence interval 0.18 to 0.95, p = 0.037). In conclusion, in patients with moderate or severe HF due to non-IDC entered into BEST, statin therapy at entry was independently associated with a decrease in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.", 
    "170": "Treatment of hypercholesterolemia with statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) is effective in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. However, statin use is often associated with a variety of muscle-related symptoms or myopathies. Myopathy may be related in part to statin inhibition of the endogenous synthesis of coenzyme Q10, an essential cofactor for mitochondrial energy production. The aim of this study is to determine whether coenzyme Q10 supplementation would reduce the degree of muscle pain associated with statin treatment. Patients with myopathic symptoms were randomly assigned in a double-blinded protocol to treatment with coenzyme Q10 (100 mg/day, n = 18) or vitamin E (400 IU/day, n = 14) for 30 days. Muscle pain and pain interference with daily activities were assessed before and after treatment. After a 30-day intervention, pain severity decreased by 40% (p <0.001) and pain interference with daily activities decreased by 38% (p <0.02) in the group treated with coenzyme Q10. In contrast, no changes in pain severity (+9%, p = NS) or pain interference with daily activities (-11%, p = NS) was observed in the group treated with vitamin E. In conclusion, results suggest that coenzyme Q10 supplementation may decrease muscle pain associated with statin treatment. Thus, coenzyme Q10 supplementation may offer an alternative to stopping treatment with these vital drugs.",

    "172": "In a randomized, open-label, multicenter trial (SOLAR [Satisfying Optimal LDL-C ATP III goals with Rosuvastatin]) performed at 145 US clinical centers from June 5, 2002 to July 12, 2004, high-risk men and women in a managed care population received typical starting doses of rosuvastatin (10 mg/d), atorvastatin (10 mg/d), or simvastatin (20 mg/d) for 6 weeks. Those who did not meet the LDL-C target of less than 100 mg/dL at 6 weeks had their dose titrated (doubled), and all patients were followed up for another 6 weeks.", 
    "173": "A total of 1632 patients were randomized to 1 of the 3 treatment regimens. After 6 weeks, 65% of patients taking rosuvastatin reached the LDL-C target of less than 100 mg/dL vs 41% with atorvastatin and 39% with simvastatin (P<.001 vs rosuvastatin for both). After 12 weeks, 76% of patients taking rosuvastatin reached the LDL-C target of less than 100 mg/dL vs 58% with atorvastatin and 53% with simvastatin (P<.001 vs rosuvastatin for both). Reductions in the LDL-C level, total cholesterol level, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) level, and non-HDL-C/HDL-C ratio were significantly greater with rosuvastatin at both 6 and 12 weeks compared with the other statins. Adverse events were similar in type and frequency in all treatment groups, and only 3% of all patients discontinued treatment because of adverse events. No myopathy was observed, no clinically important impact on renal function was attributed to study medications, and clinically important increases in serum transaminases were rare.", 
    "174": "In a managed care population, 10 mg of rosuvastatin treatment resulted in more patients reaching the NCEP ATP III LDL-C goal compared with 10 mg of atorvastatin and 20 mg of simvastatin, potentially reducing the need for titration visits.", 
    "175": "Atorvastatin and simvastatin (members of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor family) are widely prescribed as cholesterol-lowering agents. As they have been shown to exhibit potent immunomodulatory effects, they may become a future treatment option for autoimmune disease in general and multiple sclerosis (MS) in particular. Several recent reports have demonstrated that statins prevent and reverse chronic and relapsing experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model of MS. An open-label clinical trial assessing simvastatin in MS revealed a significant decrease in the number and volume of new MRI lesions and a favorable safety profile. The results of a large multicenter, placebo-controlled clinical trial assessing atorvastatin in patients with clinically isolated syndrome (a disease that predisposes to development MS) are expected soon. However, prospective placebo-controlled trials of atorvastatin or simvastatin in definite MS are difficult to perform due to ethical and financial objections. In this review, we discuss the backgrounds, mechanisms of action and future perspectives of atorvastatin and simvastatin as putative future treatment options in MS.",

Each woman was matched with 2 control subjects who were closest in age, years since menopause (if applicable), and duration of diabetes on the date on which the examination was performed. We measured bone mineral density at the spine and the hip with a dual-energy xray absorptiometry scanner and compared bone density in the 2 study groups.",

However, pathobiological similarities to atherosclerosis have been shown in several studies. The current study assesses gene profiling of severe calcified stenotic human aortic valves identifying transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, Eotaxin3, vascular adhesion protein-1 (VAP-1) and monokine induced by interferon-gamma (MIG) as potential atherosclerotic target genes in severe calcified and stenotic aortic valves, and analyzes the effects of statins on their expression as part of an anti-inflammatory treatment strategy. We collected human severe calcified and stenotic aortic valves with (CSAV+) or without (CSAV-) statin pre-treatment prior to valve replacement and investigated gene profiling by using micro-array technique and real-time PCR for the TGF-beta, Eotaxin3, VAP-1 and MIG expression. In comparison to atherosclerotic plaques of carotid arteries, immunohistochemical staining was investigated. Results were contrasted to human normal non-calcified aortic valves as controls (C). As compared to C, TGF-beta, Eotaxin3, MIG or VAP-1 was significantly upregulated in CSAV-. In CSAV+ no significant change in gene expression was found for Eotaxin3 and MIG. In contrast, VAP-1 and TGF-beta were still upregulated. Corresponding gene expression was confirmed on atherosclerotic plaque formations of carotid arteries. Monocyte/Macrophage infiltration (presence of CD68) on aortic valves (CSAV+, CSAV-, or C) confirmed inflammatory nature of the disease. Our data support further evidence for atherosclerotic inflammation as a trigger for sclerosis in end-stage calcified stenotic aortic valves by showing upregulation of gene expression for TGF-beta, VAP-1, MIG and Eotaxin3, which is only partially inhibited by previous statin therapy. Potent benefits of statin treatment on early stages of valve disease are still propagated.", 
    "181": "The development of personalized medicine will require improved knowledge of biological variability, particularly concerning the important impact of each individual's genetic makeup. A five-step strategy can be followed when trying to identify genes and gene products involved in differential responses to cardiovascular drugs: 1) Pharmacokinetic-related genes and phenotypes; (2) Pharmacodynamic targets, genes and products; (3) Cardiovascular diseases and risks depending on specific or large metabolic cycles; (4) Physiological variations of previously identified genes and proteins; (5) Environmental influences on them. After summarizing the most well known genes involved in drug metabolism, we used statins as an example. In addition to their economic impact, statins are generally considered to be of significant importance in terms of public health. Individuals respond differently to these drugs depending on multiple polymorphisms. Applying a pharmacoproteomic strategy, it is important to use available information on peptides, proteins and metabolites, generally gene products, in each of the five steps. A profiling approach dealing with genomics as well as proteomics is useful. In conclusion, the ever growing volume of available data will require an organized interpretation of variations in DNA and mRNA as well as proteins, both on the individual and population level.",

So far nothing is known about the activity of statins or more specific prenylation-inhibitors in Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). We, therefore, evaluated the anti-HL activity of simvastatin and specific prenylation-inhibitors. 2 microM Simvastatin induced caspase-related apoptosis via depletion of prenylation-substrates in several HL-cell lines. Furthermore, it effectively impaired tumor growth in a mouse model for HL. Since the prenylation-inhibitors FTI-277 and GGTI-298 were also effective against HL-cells, we conclude that statins and specific prenylation-inhibitors should be evaluated in HL patients.",

These agents have been beneficial in reducing relapse events and MRI lesions, but all require parenteral administration, leading some otherwise eligible patients to decline such therapies. Oral agents have been studied for decades with mixed results, but a small number of medications currently being tested in phase II/III clinical trials have shown promise in efficacy and tolerability. This review assesses the results of the more thoroughly studied of these agents, some of which may soon be approved for use in multiple sclerosis."
