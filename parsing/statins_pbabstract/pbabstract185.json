    "1": "This retrospective cohort study enrolled all US veterans aged 65 years or older with a vertebral or hip fracture who were treated for at least 1 year between October 1, 1998, and September 30, 2006 (N=26,545). All International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnostic codes, demographics, and pharmaceutical data were obtained from national databases. A composite end point, based on ICD-9-CM codes compatible with diffuse MSKP, was constructed. The primary outcome was time until MSKP. We performed regression analysis using the Cox proportional hazards model, controlling for age, sex, race, alcoholism, depression, anxiety, smoking, recent 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin) use, rheumatic disease, and comorbidity score.", 
    "2": "The univariate regression identified an association of bisphosphonate exposure and MSKP (hazard ratio, 1.22; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-1.44). In the multivariate regression, however, patients prescribed a bisphosphonate were not more likely to be assigned an ICD-9-CM code compatible with diffuse MSKP (hazard ratio, 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 0.93-1.30). Consistent with prior studies, we found that female sex, depression, anxiety, comorbidity score, and the presence of a rheumatic disease were all associated with a greater risk of a diagnosis of diffuse MSKP. There was no demonstrable association with statin exposure.", 
    "3": "Bisphosphonate use was not associated with a statistically higher rate of MSKP in this cohort. Individual patients may rarely report MSKP while taking bisphosphonates; however, for our studied cohort, incident MSKP does not appear to explain bisphosphonate discontinuation rates.", 
    "4": "Low wall shear stress (WSS) and high oscillatory shear index (OSI) influence plaque formation, yet little is known about their role in progression/regression of established plaques because of lack of practical means to calculate them in individual patients. Our aim was to use computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models of patients with carotid plaque undergoing statin treatment to calculate WSS and OSI in a time-efficient manner, and determine their relationship to plaque thickness (PT), plaque composition (PC), and regression.", 
    "5": "Eight patients (68 +/- 9 yr, one female) underwent multicontrast 3 T MRI at baseline and six-month post statin treatment. PT and PC were measured in carotid segments (common-CC, bifurcation-B, internal-IC) and circumferentially in nonoverlapping 600 angles and correlated with CFD models created from MRI, ultrasound, and blood pressure.", 
    "6": "PT was highest in B (2.42 +/- 0.98 versus CC: 1.60 +/- 0.47, IC: 1.62 +/- 0.52 mm, p < 0.01). Circumferentially, plaque was greatest opposite the flow divider (p < 0.01), where the lowest WSS and highest OSI were observed. In B and IC, PT was inversely related to WSS (R = -0.28 and -0.37, p < 0.01) and directly related to OSI (R = 0.22 and 0.52, p < 0.05). The total plaque volume changed from 1140 +/- 437 to 974 +/- 587 mm3 at six months (p = 0.1). Baseline WSS, but not OSI, correlated with changes in PT, necrotic tissue, and hemorrhage in B and IC, but not CC. CFD modeling took 49 +/- 18 h per patient.", 
    "7": "PT and PC correspond to adverse WSS and OSI in B and IC, and WSS is modestly but significantly related to changes in PT after short-term statin treatment. Regional hemodynamics from CFD can feasibly augment routine clinical imaging for comprehensive plaque evaluation.", 
    "8": "LDL cholesterol plays a central role in atherogenesis and LDL lowering statin therapy significantly reduces cardiovascular risk in patients with diabetes. Therefore, LDL cholesterol in current guidelines is the primary target of lipid intervention. All patients with type 2 diabetes should reach an LDL cholesterol of <100 mg/dl, the very-high risk patients with both diabetes and coronary artery disease an LDL cholesterol <70 mg/dl. Given the overwhelming body of evidence for the efficacy of statin therapy with respect to cardiovascular event prevention, LDL cholesterol should primarily be lowered by statins. Many very-high risk patients will require high-dose statin therapy to meet the stringent treatment goal of LDL cholesterol <70 mg/dl. Importantly, patients with type 2 diabetes typically exhibit a pattern of dyslipidemia with high triglycerides, low HDL cholesterol, and small, atherogenic LDL particles, which is a strong predictor of vascular events in patients with diabetes. Despite the currently limited evidence from large clinical endpoint-trials additional treatment of this diabetic dyslipidemia with niacin or fibrates therefore appears a promising option at least in the very-high risk patients with the combination of diabetes and coronary artery disease.", 
    "9": "The aim of this study was to determine the impact of pitavastatin on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and lectin-like oxidized LDL receptor-1 (LOX-1) in patients with hypercholesterolemia. Twenty-five hypercholesterolemic patients (8 male, 17 female; age 66 +/- 13, 21-80 years) who had not received anti-dyslipidemic agents and had LDL-C levels of more than 160 mg/dL were examined. Biochemical factors were measured at baseline and after treatment with pitavastatin (2 mg/day) for 6 months. Serum levels of LOX-1 with apolipoprotein B-100 particle ligand and a soluble form of LOX-1 (sLOX-1) were measured by ELISA. All subjects completed the study with no adverse side effects. Total-C (268 +/- 26 vs. 176 +/- 17 mg/dL), LDL-C (182 +/- 21 vs. 96 +/- 14 mg/dL), and LOX-1 ligand (867 +/- 452 vs. 435 +/- 262 ng/mL) were reduced with pitavastatin treatment (P < 0.0001 for each). Significant decreases in triacylglycerols were noted (P < 0.0001), but there were no changes in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. After 6 months, there were no significant changes in high-sensitivity CRP or soluble LOX-1. At baseline, there were no significant correlations between LOX-1 ligand and either LDL-C or sLOX-1. The decrease in LOX-1 ligand was not correlated with the decrease in LDL-C, but was correlated with the decrease in sLOX-1 (r = 0.47, P < 0.05). In conclusion, pitavastatin therapy had beneficial effects on markers of oxidative stress in hypercholesterolemic subjects. Serum levels of LOX-1 ligand may be a useful biomarker of the pleiotropic effects of statins.", 
    "10": "We investigated whether combination therapy with a statin plus a fibrate, as compared with statin monotherapy, would reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were at high risk for cardiovascular disease.", 
    "11": "We randomly assigned 5518 patients with type 2 diabetes who were being treated with open-label simvastatin to receive either masked fenofibrate or placebo. The primary outcome was the first occurrence of nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or death from cardiovascular causes. The mean follow-up was 4.7 years.", 
    "12": "The annual rate of the primary outcome was 2.2% in the fenofibrate group and 2.4% in the placebo group (hazard ratio in the fenofibrate group, 0.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.79 to 1.08; P=0.32). There were also no significant differences between the two study groups with respect to any secondary outcome. Annual rates of death were 1.5% in the fenofibrate group and 1.6% in the placebo group (hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.10; P=0.33). Prespecified subgroup analyses suggested heterogeneity in treatment effect according to sex, with a benefit for men and possible harm for women (P=0.01 for interaction), and a possible interaction according to lipid subgroup, with a possible benefit for patients with both a high baseline triglyceride level and a low baseline level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P=0.057 for interaction).", 
    "13": "The combination of fenofibrate and simvastatin did not reduce the rate of fatal cardiovascular events, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke, as compared with simvastatin alone. These results do not support the routine use of combination therapy with fenofibrate and simvastatin to reduce cardiovascular risk in the majority of high-risk patients with type 2 diabetes. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00000620.)", 
    "14": "Recent guidelines in North America and Europe recommend lowering low density lipoprotein associated cholesterol (LDLC) to achieve optimal coronary heart disease risk reduction. Statins have been the therapy of choice and proven successful and relatively safe. However, we are now facing new challenges and it appears that additional or alternative drugs are urgently needed. This boosts research in the field, reopening old cases like other inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis or making attractive tools from the latest technologies like gene silencing by anti-sense oligonucleotides. LDLs are cholesterol-enriched lipoproteins stabilized by the hepatic apolipoprotein B100, and derived from TG rich very low density lipoprotein. This review focuses on the molecular pathways involved in plasma LDLC production and elimination, in particular cholesterol absorption and the hepatobiliary route, apoB100 and VLDL production, and LDL clearance via the LDL receptor. We will identify important or rate-limiting proteins (including Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1), microsomal TG transfer protein (MTP), acyl-coenzyme A/cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), Acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferases 2 (DGAT2), proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9)), and nuclear receptors (farnesoid X receptor (FXR), thyroid hormone receptor (TR)) that constitute interesting therapeutic targets. Numerous compounds already in use modulate these pathways, such as phytosterols, ezetimibe, bile acids sequestrants, niacin, and fibrates. Many pathways can be considered to lower LDLC, but the road has been paved with disappointments and difficulties. With new targets identified and diversification of the drugs, a new era for better LDLC management is plausible.", 
    "15": "The small and large intestine are one of the most common sites for the adverse action of drugs, accounting for 20-40% of all drug side effects. The most important factor in the diagnosis of drug-induced intestinal side effect is awareness. The mechanisms of damage are invariably complex, but may be due to topical effects, a known pharmacologic action of the drug on motility (for instance cholinergic/anti-cholinergic effect) and/or secretion, immune suppression and in the case of cytotoxic drug treatment a combination of many actions. The diagnosis of damage may be simple and widely recognised (NSAID-induced enteropathy resulting in bleeding, protein loss and rarely perforation and diaphragm disease), or at other times ignored (tricyclic antidepressants increasing constipation) or life threatening (docetaxene). Some associations require further research (statin and anti-retroviral associated irritable bowel symptoms). Diagnosis is traditionally made by symptom improvement on discontinuation of the drug. More lately capsule enteroscopy is used to aid diagnosis.", 
    "16": "Statins are among the most widely used drugs in the management of hypercholesterolemia. In addition to inhibiting endogenous cholesterol synthesis, however, statins decrease coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) synthesis. CoQ10 has been reported to have antioxidant properties, and administration of drugs that decrease CoQ10 synthesis might lead to increased oxidative stress in vivo. Our present study examined the hypothesis that atorvastatin increased oxidative stress in hypercholesterolemic patients due to its inhibition of CoQ10 synthesis. We investigated the effects of atorvastatin (10 mg/d) administration for 5 months on lowering hypercholesterolemia and blood antioxidant status. The study population included 19 hypercholesterolemic outpatients. Blood levels of lipid and antioxidant markers, consisting of vitamin C, vitamin E, CoQ10, and glutathione (GSH), and urinary levels of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) were examined pre- and postadministration of atorvastatin. Atorvastatin administration resulted in a significant decrease in blood levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, vitamin E, and CoQ10 (P < .05); however, a significant increase in the ratios of vitamin E/LDL cholesterol and CoQ10/LDL cholesterol was noted (P < .05). Atorvastatin had no significant effect on red blood cell (RBC) level of GSH and urinary 8-OHdG. The present study provides evidence that atorvastatin exerts a hypocholesterolemic effect, but on the basis of the urinary level of 8-OHdG and the blood ratios of vitamin E/LDL cholesterol and CoQ10/LDL cholesterol, has no oxidative stress-inducing effect.", 
    "17": "Pharmaceutical stabilisation of the abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) wall can delay surgery and improve outcome. Observational studies indicate statins can be used to reduce AAA growth but mechanistic data are scarce. In this study, our aim was to determine the pleiotropic effects of different statins on AAA wall composition.", 
    "18": "We included 216 patients undergoing open AAA repair, of which 60 used simvastatin, 52 atorvastatin and 23 pravastatin. The AAA wall histology and protein expression (IL 1beta,2,4,5,6,8,10,12, interferon-gamma (IFNgamma), tumour necrosis factor (TNF)alpha,beta, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2 and 9 activities, total MMP8,9 and cathepsin A and B levels) between statin users and non-users were compared as also among the use of different statins.", 
    "19": "As far as histological inflammation goes, the AAA walls of statin users did not differ from those not using them. After multivariate adjustment for risk factors, pravastatin use was associated with tendencies of increased MMP8 (p = 0.022), active MMP9 (p = 0.040) and higher cathepsin B (p = 0.056) levels. The AAA walls of simvastatin and atorvastatin users showed no differences in proteases or cytokines in multivariate analyses.", 
    "20": "The use of statins was not associated with a decrease in protease levels or inflammation. The trends of elevated protease levels associated with pravastatin use suggest pleiotropic differences among the various statins, supporting the need for further research to target pharmaceutical AAA treatment.", 
    "21": "The effect of aggressive medical therapy on quantitative coronary plaque burden is not generally known, especially in ethnic Chinese.", 
    "22": "We reasoned that Cardiac CT could conveniently quantify early coronary atherosclerosis in our patient population, and hypothesized that serial observation could differentiate the efficacy of aggressive medical therapy regarding progression and regression of the atherosclerotic process, as well as evaluating the additional impact of life-style modification and the relative effects of the application of statin therapy.", 
    "23": "We employed a standardized Cardiac CT protocol to serially scan 113 westernized Hong Kong Chinese individuals (64 men and 49 women) with Chest Pain and positive coronary risk factors. In all cases included for this serial investigation, subsequent evaluation showed no significantly-obstructive coronary disease by functional studies and angiography. After stringent risk factor modification, including aggressive statin therapy to achieve LDL-cholesterol lowering conforming to N.C.E.P. ATP III guidelines, serial CT scans were performed 1-12 years apart for changes in coronary artery calcification (CAC), using the Agatston Score (AS) for quantification.", 
    "24": "At baseline, the mean AS was 1413.6 for males (mean age 54.4 years) and 2293.3 for females (mean age 62.4 years). The average increase of AS in the entire study population was 24% per year, contrasting with 16.4% per year on strict risk factor modification plus statin therapy, as opposed to 33.2% per year for historical control patients (p < 0.001). Additionally, 20.4% of the 113 patients demonstrated decreasing calcium scores. Medical therapy also yielded a remarkably low adverse event rate during the follow-up period --- 2 deaths, 2 strokes and only 1 case requiring PCI.",

    "26": "The purpose of this analysis was to study the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of oral rosuvastatin (RSV) 10 mg/day vs. oral ezetimibe/simvastatin (E/S) 10/20 mg/day in patients who met the LDL-C goals set out in the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP), Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) 2001 and 2004 guidelines, and the percent change in the atherogenic lipid profile in daily outpatient practice in a high specialty Hospital in Mexico City.", 
    "27": "From January 2004 to December 2005, outpatient medical records in the Cardiology Service were reviewed according to the following criteria: established dyslipidemia diagnosis, triglycerides and serum lipid measurements (TC, LDL-C, HDL-C) taken before receiving drug therapy with either oral RSV 10 mg/day or oral E/S 10/20 mg/day once daily, no other related lipid-lowering treatment administered, and lipid levels recorded at 8 weeks of treatment. A cost analysis was performed from an institutional perspective, using the exchange rate as of October 2006 of 10.9007 pesos / US dollar. A deterministic analysis was performed comparing treatment costs, proportion of patients achieving the ATP III goal, and the percentage decrease in LDL-C. In addition, a stochastic analysis was performed, considering the uncertainty around the estimations for mean cost and mean effectiveness estimations.", 
    "28": "Using the ATP III 2001 criteria, the percentage of patients who reached the LDL-C goals was 81.4% for patients who received RSV, while the proportion for patients who received E/S was 58.4% (p < 0.001). Results according to the ATP III 2004 criteria were: RSV, 46.4% vs. E/S, 31.4% (p = 0.04). The cost of a 1% reduction in LDL-C was $2.02 with RSV and $4.09 with E/S. The cost-effectiveness acceptability curve showed that RSV might be more cost-effective than E/S, based on patients who achieved the 2004 goals.", 
    "29": "According to this exploratory, non-controlled retrospective analysis, it can be said that in daily clinical practice in high-cardiovascular-risk Mexican patients, treatment with oral RSV 10 mg/day is more effective and less costly than treatment with the fixed-combination oral E/S 10/20 mg/day.",

    "31": "Circulating levels of bradykinin and kallidin peptides, and high and low molecular weight kininogens, as well as plasma and tissue kallikrein, and kallistatin were measured in non-diabetic and diabetic patients before coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Tissue kallikrein levels in atrial tissue were examined by immunohistochemistry and atrial tissue kallikrein mRNA quantified.", 
    "32": "Plasma levels of tissue kallikrein were approximately 62% higher in diabetic than in non-diabetic patients (p=0.001), whereas no differences were seen in circulating levels of bradykinin and kallidin peptides, and high and low molecular weight kininogens, or in plasma kallikrein or kallistatin. Immunohistochemistry revealed a twofold increase in tissue kallikrein levels in atrial myocytes (p= 0.015), while tissue kallikrein mRNA levels were increased eightfold in atrial tissue of diabetic patients (p=0.014). Statin therapy did not change any variables of the circulating kallikrein-kinin system. Neither aspirin, calcium antagonists, beta blockers or long-acting nitrate therapies influenced any kallikrein-kinin system variable.", 
    "33": "Tissue kallikrein levels are increased in type 2 diabetes, whereas statin therapy does not modify the circulating kallikrein-kinin system. Cardiac tissue kallikrein may play a greater cardioprotective role in type 2 diabetic than in non-diabetic patients and contribute to the benefits of ACE inhibitor therapy in type 2 diabetic patients. However, our findings do not support a role for the kallikrein-kinin system in mediating the effects of statin therapy on endothelial function.", 
    "34": "Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a pivotal role in tissue remodeling and destruction in inflammation-associated diseases such as cardiovascular disease and periodontal disease. Although it is known that interleukin (IL)-6 is a key proinflamatory cytokine, it remains unclear how IL-6 regulates MMP expression by mononuclear phagocytes. Furthermore, it remains undetermined how IL-6 in combination with hyperglycemia affects MMP expression. In the present study, we investigated the regulatory effect of IL-6 alone or in combination with high glucose on MMP-1 expression by U937 mononuclear phagocytes. We found that IL-6 is a powerful stimulator for MMP-1 expression and high glucose further augmented IL-6-stimulated MMP-1 expression. We also found that high glucose, IL-6, and lipopolysaccharide act in concert to stimulate MMP-1 expression. In the studies to elucidate underlying mechanisms, the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways were found to be required for stimulation of MMP-1 by IL-6 and high glucose. We also observed that IL-6 and high glucose stimulated the expression of c-Jun, a key subunit of AP-1 known to be essential for MMP-1 transcription. The role of c-Jun in MMP-1 expression was confirmed by the finding that suppression of c-Jun expression by RNA interference significantly inhibited MMP-1 expression. Finally, we demonstrated that similarly to U937 mononuclear phagocytes, IL-6 and high glucose also stimulated MMP-1 secretion from human primary monocytes. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that IL-6 and high glucose synergistically stimulated MMP-1 expression in mononuclear phagocytes via ERK and JNK cascades and c-Jun upregulation.",

    "36": "Seventy-two Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to 6 groups. Group 1 was fed with standard rat chow. Group 2 and the other 4 groups were fed with a high-cholesterol diet: 10 mg/kg/d atorvastatin to group 3; 1 mg/kg/d atorvastatin to group 4; 10 mg/kg/d atorvastatin and 1 mg/kg/d ezetimibe to group 5; and 1 mg/kg/d ezetimibe to group 6. After 3 months, serum total, low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels, and the activities of malondialdehyde, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase were measured in the plasma. In addition, the left anterior descending and femoral arteries were examined histopathologically.", 
    "37": "Serum total, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride levels decreased slightly in group 3. However, administration of 1 mg/kg/d atorvastatin or 1 mg/kg/d ezetimibe did not significantly change lipid parameters. Plasma malondialdehyde levels slightly increased in group 2 compared with controls and decreased compared with both the atorvastatin regimens. However, malondialdehyde levels increased with the addition of ezetimibe to atorvastatin. Only the administration of ezetimibe significantly elevated the levels of malondialdehyde. Glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase levels were also found to be significantly reduced in the groups receiving ezetimibe when compared with atorvastatin groups.", 
    "38": "Atorvastatin has a beneficial effect on oxidative stress in rats fed with high-cholesterol diet. A combination of ezetimibe with atorvastatin diminishes the beneficial effects of atorvastatin. Conversely, the sole administration of ezetimibe increases oxidative stress.",

    "44": "The behavioural Bayes approach to sample size determination for clinical trials assumes that the number of subsequent patients switching to a new drug from the current drug depends on the strength of the evidence for efficacy and safety that was observed in the clinical trials. The optimal sample size is the one which maximises the expected net benefit of the trial. The approach has been developed in a series of papers by Pezeshk and the present authors (Gittins JC, Pezeshk H. A behavioral Bayes method for determining the size of a clinical trial.

The purpose of this article is to provide a rationale for experimental designs which allocate more patients to the new treatment than to the control group. The model uses a logistic weight function, including an interaction term linking efficacy and safety, which determines the number of patients choosing the new drug, and hence the resulting benefit. A Monte Carlo simulation is employed for the calculation. Having a larger group of patients on the new drug in general makes it easier to recruit patients to the trial and may also be ethically desirable. Our results show that this can be done with very little if any reduction in expected net benefit.",

    "46": "To create a rat model of AMI, left anterior descending artery (LAD) ligations were performed on 40 Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. After the establishment of AMI, animals were randomly divided into 4 groups to receive variant treatments: control, MSCs only, atorvastatin only, and MSCs plus atorvastatin, with 10 animals in each group.", 
    "47": "Four weeks following the treatments, the hemodynamic testing showed significant functional improvement in animals that received MSCs plus atorvastatin compared with controls, MSCs or atorvastatin only treated animals. Histological analysis showed more MSCs were present in animals receiving combination therapy than in animals which received MSCs alone. Vessel density was higher in animals receiving combination therapy than in other groups.",

In children, statins have been shown to be effective in reducing LDL-C, restoring flow-mediated dilation, and slowing carotid intima-media thickening. However, few children in these trials achieved current LDL-C goals.",

    "54": "High-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) is a continuous inverse cardiovascular risk factor. The mechanisms by which HDLs protect against atherosclerosis are multiple. The major effect is thought to be reverse cholesterol transport, the mechanism by which excess cellular cholesterol is returned to the liver for excretion in the bile. HDLs also have pleiotropic roles: they decrease inflammation, prevent low-density lipoprotein oxidation, vascular endothelial cell apoptosis and thrombosis, and improve vascular endothelial function. Recent studies suggest that nascent HDL particles are metabolized rapidly and that their components (Apo AI, cholesterol and phospholipids) are rapidly exchanged within lipoprotein classes. There are many causes of HDL-C deficiency. Using Mendelian randomization, several groups have concluded that many genetic forms of HDL deficiency do not increase cardiovascular risk. This raises the controversial issue of the causality of low HDL-C as a cardiovascular risk factor, rather than a marker of cardiovascular health. This is reflected in the importance of lifestyle in determining HDL-C levels. The treatment of low HDL-C remains controversial, in part because the only currently available effective medication, niacin, is relatively poorly tolerated and outcomes studies on cardiovascular disease prevention are still pending.", 
    "55": "Cardiovascular disease is a major complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus, and this is partly due to associated abnormalities of plasma lipid and lipoprotein metabolism. Although glycemic control improves plasma lipoprotein abnormalities and may have an independent benefit on cardiovascular risk reduction, the magnitude of this benefit is less than cholesterol lowering therapy. Current treatment guidelines for the management of dyslipidemia in people with type 2 diabetes are based on the results of cardiovascular outcome clinical trials. Primary emphasis of treatment should be on lowering LDL-C to < 100 mg/dl with statins. If cardiovascular disease is present, then high dose statins should be used, and an optional LDL-C goal < 70 is recommended. If triglycerides are > 200 mg/dl, then a secondary goal is to lower non-HDL-C < 130 mg/dl (< 100 mg/dl if cardiovascular disease is present) is recommended. Low HDL-C levels are common in type 2 diabetes but are not currently recommended as a target for treatment because of the lack of definitive cardiovascular outcome studies supporting this goal, and because of the difficulty in raising HDL-C. The additional benefit of combination therapy with fibrates, ezetimibe or niacin added to a statin on cardiovascular risk is uncertain pending the results of on-going cardiovascular outcome studies.",

Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 is regulated by H-Ras, and in diabetes its activation is associated with increased vascular permeability. The goal of this study was to investigate the role of sustained activation of MMP-9 in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy and to illustrate the mechanism through which it is upregulated in diabetes.", 
    "61": "Retinal MMP-9 activation and its tissue inhibitor, TIMP-1, were quantified in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. Inhibition of H-Ras by simvastatin on diabetes-induced activation of H-Ras was evaluated. The mechanism by which diabetes regulates retinal MMP-9 was confirmed by determining the effect of genetic or pharmacologic regulation of H-Ras on its activation in retinal endothelial cells.", 
    "62": "In rats, MMP-9 was activated and expression of TIMP-1 was decreased in the retina and its microvasculature at both 2 months and 12 months of diabetes. In retinal endothelial cells, high glucose activated MMP-9, and inhibition of its activation (by pharmacologic inhibitor or siRNA) ameliorated accelerated apoptosis. Inhibition of H-Ras, both in diabetic rats (simvastatin) and in isolated endothelial cells (H-Ras siRNA), abrogated the activation of MMP-9 and prevented the reduction of TIMP-1.",

    "64": "Increasing evidence indicates that statins, specific inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-coenzyme A (CoA) reductase, exerts neuroprotective actions rather than simply lowering cholesterol. However, the underlying mechanism has not been elucidated clearly. Here, the effect of lovastatin on the neurological outcomes of nucleus basalis magnocellularis (NBM)-lesioned rats and the pathophysiological mechanisms were investigated. Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups: (i) a sham group; (ii) a model group: bilateral NBM of rats were injured by infusion of ibotenic acid; and (iii) a lovastatin-treated group: lovastatin was administrated orally for 4 weeks before treated by ibotenic acid. We show that lovastatin significantly improves the neurological outcomes as well as the choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity and muscarinic/NMDA receptor binding activity impaired by NBM lesion, and that lovastatin prevents neuron loss and induces Akt whereas inhibits p38 phosphorylation. Overall, the neuro-restorative and -protective effect of lovastatin may be attributed to the regulation of Akt- and p38-mediated signaling pathway together with improvement of muscarinic/NMDA receptor functions. Statins may be useful in the treatment of neurological disorders.", 
    "65": "Colesevelam hydrochloride (colesevelam), a non-absorbed, synthetic, lipid-lowering polymer, is a bile acid sequestrant. Colesevelam binds with high affinity to bile acids within the gastrointestinal tract, thereby inhibiting the reabsorption of bile acids, resulting in decreases in serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. Colesevelam is available as tablets and as powder for oral suspension. At dosages of 3.75 g once daily or 1.875 g twice daily, colesevelam is approved in the US for the treatment of pediatric patients aged 10-17 years with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. Colesevelam may be administered as monotherapy or in combination with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin). A 32-week trial was conducted and consisted of a stablilization period ( approximately 4 weeks), a randomized period (8 weeks), an open-label period (18 weeks), and a 2-week follow-up period. In the 8-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled period of the trial, colesevelam (tablets), as monotherapy or with a statin, was an effective treatment for pediatric patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. At week 8, recipients of colesevelam 3.75 g/day had significant percentage reductions from baseline in mean LDL-C levels (primary endpoint) compared with placebo recipients. Significant beneficial treatment effects for colesevelam 3.75 g/day versus placebo were also reported for several other lipid/lipoprotein parameters at week 8 of the study. The reported treatment effects on lipid/lipoprotein parameters were maintained over a subsequent 18-week, open-label, noncomparative period, when all patients received colesevelam 3.75 g/day. Colesevelam 3.75 g/day was generally well tolerated for up to 26 weeks by pediatric patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "66": "Cell death induced by over-activation of glutamate receptors occurs in different neuropathologies. Cholesterol depletors protect from neurotoxic over-activation of glutamate receptors, and we have recently reported that this neuroprotection is associated with a reduction of the N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype of glutamate receptors in detergent-resistant membrane domains (DRM). In the present study we used comparative proteomics to further identify which proteins, besides the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, change its percentage of association to DRM after treatment of neurons with simvastatin. We detected 338 spots in neuronal DRM subjected to 2-DE; eleven of these spots changed its intensity after treatment with simvastatin. All 11 differential spots showed reduced intensity in simvastatin-treated samples and were identified as adipocyte plasma membrane associated protein, enolase, calretinin, coronin 1a, f-actin capping protein alpha1, f-actin capping protein alpha2, heat shock cognate protein 71, malate dehydrogenase, n-myc downregulated gene 1, prohibitin 2, Rab GDP dissociation inhibitor, translationally controlled tumor protein and voltage dependent anion selective channel protein 1. The proteins tested colocalized with the lipid raft marker caveolin-1. Interestingly, the proteins we have identified in the present study had been previously reported to play a role in cell fate and, thus, they might represent novel targets for neuroprotection.",

A total of 98,471 hypertensive patients were identified, comprising 74,685 atorvastatin users (mean dose 13.6 mg/d) and 23,786 simvastatin users (mean dose 28.6 mg/d), and followed a median 1.5 years for the occurrence of a first CV event. The crude CV event rates were 2.81 and 3.92 per 100 person-years for atorvastatin and simvastatin, respectively [unadjusted hazard ratio (HR): 0.73; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.68-0.78, P < 0.001]. After adjusting for clinical and demographic confounders, use of atorvastatin was associated with fewer CV events compared with simvastatin (HR: 0.91; 95% CI: 0.84-0.98, P = 0.009). However, the lipid-lowering efficacy of the 2 statins could not be assessed as patient lipid data were unavailable. In conclusion, hypertensive patients without cardiovascular disease who initiated atorvastatin (10 or 20 mg/d) had a significantly lower risk of subsequent CV events compared with those who initiated simvastatin at doses of similar potency (20 or 40 mg/d). As with all observational studies, the study is subject to certain limitations, and the findings should be regarded as hypothesis generating.",

The benefits of statin in cardiovascular disease can be explained not only by their lipid-lowering potential but also by non-lipid-related mechanisms, called pleiotropic effects. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) can result in myocardial injury that is reflected by an increase in creatine kinase-MB and troponin I isoenzymes with worsened long-term prognosis following PCI. Observational studies suggested that pretreatment with statins might reduce the incidence of myocardial infarction after coronary intervention and prevent myocardial injury. Thus, several randomized controlled trials were conducted. They showed that pretreatment with statin before elective PCI reduces periprocedural myocardial injury in patients with stable angina. Moreover, short-term high-dose statin administration before coronary procedures also improves clinical outcome in patients with acute coronary syndromes and/or high preprocedural C-reactive protein levels. Thus, this evidence strongly supports routine utilization of high-dose statins as adjuvant pharmacological therapy before percutaneous coronary revascularization.",

Postprandial hyperglycemia has been shown to play an important role on the onset and development of heart failure and cerebral infarction in several large-scale clinical trials. Recently, chronic hyperglycemia has been reported to enhance the vasoconstrictor response by Rho-kinase. We have previously reported that phenylephrine enhanced the vasoconstrictor response in a spontaneous diabetes mellitus OLETF (Otsuka-Long-Evane-Tokushima fatty) rat model. However, the mechanism of hyperglycemia in these reactions, particularly the influence of hyperglycemia on the signal transduction pathway, is still not well understood. We, therefore, examined the effect of hyperglycemia on the cell growth and gene expression of rat aortic smooth-muscle cells (RASMCs). Hyperglycemia accelerated the growth of RASMCs in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, the c-fos gene expression was also increased by hyperglycemia. Phenylephrine activated the c-fos gene expression. Hyperglycemia augmented the phenylephrine-induced c-fos gene expression synergistically in a dose dependent manner. The deletion analysis revealed that the c-fos serum response element (SRE) accounts for the c-fos gene expression. RhoA, and Rho-kinase were involved in hyperglycemia-induced c-fos gene expression. An HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, Pitavastatin, inhibited these hyperglycemia-augmented reactions by inhibiting RhoA. Hyperglycemia itself increased the cell growth and gene expression. Furthermore, it modifies and augments the cell growth and gene expression by alpha1-AR-mediated stimulation. Statin might therefore be effective for the treatment of hyperglycemia-induced cardiovascular dysfunction.",

Moreover, a combination of SIM with each of the individual nucleos(t)ide analogues lamivudine (LMV), adefovir (ADV), tenofovir (TEN) and entecavir (ETV), showed synergistic antiviral activity. Combination drug treatments were performed in the HepG2.2.15 cell line. Compound combinations were centered on a mixture designed to deliver approximately equipotent (not necessarily equimolar) concentrations of each agent, based on the ninety percent viral inhibition monotherapy values. SIM interacted favorably with all four licensed anti-HBV nucleos(t)ide analogues, especially at molar ratios that approximate combinations likely to be used clinically. As the relative concentration of SIM was raised to an excess, the overall favorability of the interactions progressively increased. SIM displayed about equal degrees of synergy with ADV and TDF. The highest degree of synergy was observed at the 300:1 combination of SIM with ETV. Interactions with LMV were the least favorable. The in vitro potential shown here may greatly augment anti-HBV therapy clinically.", 
    "106": "In patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), higher numbers of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) favourably influence clinical outcome. Controversially, increased apoptosis of endothelial cells (EC) may reflect vascular damage. Statins have been shown to improve vascular damage and enhance EPC function and numbers. The availability of ezetimibe, a potent novel cholesterol absorption inhibitor, allows to distinguish between lipid-lowering and pleiotropic properties of statins.", 
    "107": "43 patients with CAD were assigned to receive either: de novo atorvastatin (group A; n=17), ezetimibe as add-on to chronic statin therapy (group B; n=14), or dose escalation of atorvastatin (group C; n=12) over 4 weeks. Circulating apoptotic EC (CD45-CD146+vWF+Annexin-V+) and EPC (CD34+KDR+) were quantified using flow cytometry. LDL cholesterol levels were significantly reduced in all treatment arms. Both statin groups, group A and group C, showed significantly reduced circulating apoptotic EC by 50% each (p<0.01). On the other hand, there was a significant doubling in the numbers of circulating EPC in group A and group C (p<0.005, each). Consequently, the endothelial damage-index calculated from numbers of circulating apoptotic mature EC related to EPC numbers, was improved in group A by 79% (p<0.01) and in group C by 70% (p<0.05). In contrast, sole LDL reduction by ezetimibe exerted no effect on any of the different circulating endothelial cell types.",

    "109": "Landmark studies have proved that several therapies reduce cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk; however, the rates of secondary CVD in the context of therapies delivered according to current guidelines are largely unknown. Therefore, we sought to estimate the incidence of secondary CVD hospitalizations and all-cause mortality among patients who did and did not receive guideline-level pharmacotherapy. For the 12,278 patients added to the Kaiser Permanente, Northwest CVD registry in 2000 to 2005, we used the pharmacy records to define guideline-level care (GLC) as at least one dispense of aspirin/antiplatelets, statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers, and beta blockers within 6 months after registry enrollment. We followed patients until they died, experienced a CVD hospitalization, or June 30, 2008. We compared the age- and gender-adjusted incidence rates per 1,000 person-years of CVD hospitalization, death, and the composite, and estimated the hazard ratios using Cox regression analysis. During a mean follow-up of 45.8 +/- 22.8 months, 25% of the study sample experienced the composite outcome. The age- and gender-adjusted incidence per 1,000 person-years of the composite outcome was significantly lower among GLC patients (hazard ratio 50.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 46.6 to 54.3) versus non-GLC patients (hazard ratio 60.7, 95% CI 58.1 to 63.4). The difference was driven by lower mortality rates (hazard ratio 18.1, 95% CI 16.1 to 20.4 vs hazard ratio 28.1, 95% CI 26.3 to 30.0). The incidence of CVD hospitalizations did not differ significantly between the 2 groups (hazard ratio 29.2, 95% CI 26.4 to 32.2 vs hazard ratio 27.7, 95% CI 26.0 to 29.5). Multivariate adjustment resulted in a marginally significant 8% lower risk of the composite outcome among GLC recipients (hazard ratio 0.92, 95% CI 0.83 to 1.01, p = 0.067). In conclusion, treatment according to current guidelines was significantly associated with reduced mortality but not the risk of secondary hospitalizations.", 
    "110": "We sought to determine significant relations between atherogenic lipoproteins and the contribution of calcified plaque (CP), mixed plaque (MP), and noncalcified plaque (NCP) to the total plaque (TP) burden in patients without previous coronary artery disease. From 823 adult patients without previously established coronary artery disease (52% receiving statin therapy, 34% asymptomatic) but with visible coronary plaque on coronary computed tomographic angiography, we obtained segmental CP, MP, NCP, and TP counts from contrast-enhanced, electrocardiographic-gated computed tomography. Multivariate linear regression analysis was used to determine the associations of clinical factors and lipoprotein levels to CP, MP, and NCP counts and CP/TP, MP/TP, and NCP/TP count ratios. Age, male gender, diabetes, smoking, and statin therapy were significantly associated with the CP count (p <0.001, p <0.001, p = 0.049, p = 0.016, and p = 0.003, respectively). Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was significantly associated with MP and NCP counts (all p values </=0.002). LDL cholesterol was also the only variable to demonstrate significant concurrent relations with CP/TP, MP/TP, and NCP/TP ratios, including an inverse association with CP/TP (p = 0.008) and a positive association with MP/TP (p = 0.032). Analyses using non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in place of LDL cholesterol yielded similar results. In conclusion, among the traditional clinical factors used to estimate cardiovascular event risk, LDL cholesterol is associated with an increased MP and NCP burden and is the sole variable that independently predicted relative predominance of CP, MP, and NCP, suggesting a potentially important role for lipoprotein levels in modulating the type of detectable coronary arterial plaque.",

We used stratified Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate the multivariate-adjusted effect of propranolol compared to other BBs and controlled for demographic variables, risk factors for myopathy, other comorbidities, and health service use measures. We also assessed whether co-use of propranolol and statin further increases the risk, by including an interaction term for use of propranolol and statins.",

    "115": "Nitric oxide (NO) is the main endothelial-derived relaxation factor and plays a major role in cardiovascular homeostasis. This key signalling molecule is synthesised by a family of nitric oxide synthases (NOS), and the endothelial isoform (eNOS) is the most important for nitric oxide formation in the cardiovascular system. Cardiovascular drugs including statins increase eNOS expression and up-regulate NO formation, and this effect may be responsible for protective, pleiotropic effects produced by statins. However, the genetic background may also affect NO formation in the cardiovascular system, and recent studies have shown that genetic polymorphisms in the eNOS gene modify endogenous NO formation and the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. For example, cases with the CC genotype for the T(-786)C polymorphism in the eNOS gene are at increased cardiovascular risk when compared with those with the TT genotype. Interestingly, pharmacogenetic studies have recently indicated that atorvastatin improves NO formation more clearly in these individuals. However, it is not known whether this polymorphism really increases cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and whether atorvastatin or other statins attenuate the morbidity and mortality rates in cases with the CC genotype. If proved true, then statins-induced up-regulation of eNOS and increased NO formation could compensate for a genetic 'disadvantage' in cases with the CC genotype. This could be a significant advance in the prevention of cardiovascular events. It is necessary although to validate this hypothesis with clinical trials which will require a long follow-up to assess relevant clinical events and not only surrogate biomarkers.",

Thus, two major subjects are discussed herein. First, the concept of an intravenous drug interaction study (where the perpetrator is administered intravenously or orally while the drug candidate administered intravenously) to facilitate prediction of maximal possible systemic exposure of a substrate drug when oral drug interactions occur is explored. If a substrate drug with oral bioavailability is equal to or less than 80%, an intravenous drug interaction study at low dose along with a few key oral drug interaction studies could be useful for achieving this objective with the aid of modeling and simulations. Along with the clinical safety of the drug, one could then attempt to predict the safety margin when the worst drug interactions occur. Secondly, the efficacy and safety disparity of clopidogrel, statins and irinotecan each among races and genetic variants are discussed to illustrate that pharmacogenetic knowledge is important for the interpretation and prediction of drug interaction-induced adverse events, whereas drug interaction -induced adverse events are equally informative for identifying genes-based mechanisms involved.",

Therefore, this study specifically investigated the backbone structure to obtain pH-sensitive polymers with much higher fusogenic activity and to reveal the effect of the polymer backbone structure on the interaction with the membrane. Hyperbranched poly(glycidol) (HPG) derivatives were prepared as a new type of pH-sensitive polymer and used for the modification of liposomes.

The results of the Management of Elevated Cholesterol in the Primary Prevention Group of Adult Japanese (MEGA) study suggest that the degree of reduction in Japanese subjects may be greater than this for the same degree of LDL-cholesterol reduction. Given the success of statins in preventing cardiovascular events, it is not surprising that they have been tested in a variety of related conditions, three of which are discussed in this article. Heart failure is characterized by inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and neurohumeral activation, conditions that are ameliorated by statin therapy. The Controlled Rosuvastatin Multinational Trial in Heart Failure (CORONA) showed no significant benefit of rosuvastatin upon the primary endpoint, cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction and stroke. However, subgroups identified by the biomarkers plasma amino-terminal pro-brain natriuretic and C-reactive protein showed a reduction in events. Aortic stenosis and atherosclerosis share common risk factors, including hypertension and hypercholesterolemia. Although non-randomized cohort studies have suggested that statins slow the progression of aortic stenosis, this was not shown in either of the two randomized placebo-controlled trials testing this hypothesis. Similarly, Alzheimer's disease shares many risk factors with atherosclerosis, and several observational studies have reported a lower risk of developing this condition in patients taking statins. However, two recently completed clinical trials indicate that neither atorvastatin nor simvastatin slow the progression of early Alzheimer's disease.

Its downstream targets cofilin, CDC42 and G3BP1 are members of the GTPase family affected by lovastatin. Our data indicated that lovastatin modulated the E2F1-pathway through the regulation of expression of prohibitin and retinoblastoma (Rb). This subsequently leads to changes of E2F-downstream targets minichromosome maintenance protein 7 (MCM7) and MutS homolog 2 (MSH2). Lovastatin also regulated the AKT-signaling pathway. Increased phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and decreased DJ-1 expression lead to a down-regulation of the active pAkt.

To incorporate LV into PUR scaffolds, LV was combined with the hardener component before scaffold synthesis. The PUR scaffolds containing LV (PUR/LV) demonstrated a highly porous structure with interconnected pores, which supported in vitro cell attachment and proliferation and in vivo osteoconductive potential. The PUR/LV scaffolds showed sustained release of biologically active LV, as evidenced by the fact that LV releasates significantly enhanced osteogenic differentiation of osteoblastic cells in vitro. A study of bone formation in vivo using a rat plug defect model showed that the PUR/LV scaffolds were biocompatible. Further, locally delivered LV enhanced new bone formation in the PUR scaffolds at week 4, while there were no obvious effects at week 2. These results suggest that the sustained LV delivery system from PUR scaffolds is a potentially safe and effective device for bone regeneration.",

We evaluated the impact of concomitant statin medication on the response and survival of patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) receiving rituximab-cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisone (R-CHOP) as first-line therapy. Medical histories of patients with DLBCL who were treated with R-CHOP as first-line therapy were assessed for concomitant statin use, response after completion of chemotherapy, event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS). Furthermore, 2-[(18)F]fluor-2-deoxyglucose (FDG)-PET/CT results after completion of first-line therapy were compared between the groups. Overall, 145 patients with DLBCL treated with R-CHOP from January 2001 to December 2009 were analyzed. Twenty-one (15%) patients received statins throughout therapy. Five-year EFS was 67.3% in patients without statins compared with 79% in patients receiving statins during R-CHOP (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.15-1.54, p = 0.2). Five-year OS was 81.4% for patients without statins compared with 93.3% for patients taking statins (HR, 0.58; 95% CI 0.07-4.55, p = 0.6). There were no statistically significant differences in the rates of complete remissions between the two groups (75% in the non-statin group versus 86% in the statin group, p = 0.45). A trend toward a lower rate of complete metabolic responses in FDG-PET/CT after chemotherapy was seen in patients without statin medication compared with the patients taking statins (84% versus 92%, p = 0.068). Concomitant statin use had no adverse impact on response to chemotherapy, EFS, and OS in patients treated with R-CHOP for DLBCL.",

At the same time, physicians have been encouraged to contain costs by prescribing cheaper, generic statins for cholesterol management. To determine how these possibly conflicting goals are managed in clinical practice, we examined LDL-C control in patients switched from a potent, branded statin (atorvastatin) to a less potent, generic statin (simvastatin).", 
    "159": "Patients who switched from atorvastatin to simvastatin between July 2006 and January 2008 were retrospectively identified from a US medical and pharmacy claims database, and matched with controls remaining on atorvastatin.

All study variables were analyzed descriptively.", 
    "160": "After applying exclusion and inclusion criteria, 1048 patients who switched from atorvastatin to simvastatin and 1048 matched controls who remained on atorvastatin were included. Among the switchers, 379 (36%) received an inappropriately low dose of simvastatin (<2 times atorvastatin dose). In patients remaining on atorvastatin, mean LDL-C decreased from 105.7 mg/dL to 102.3 mg/dL after 44 weeks, whereas in switched patients, LDL-C remained similar, at 105.9 mg/dL on atorvastatin and 105.8 mg/dL on simvastatin. Before switching, when all patients were receiving atorvastatin, 67.4% of switchers and 69.9% of controls achieved recommended LDL-C targets. After switching, significantly fewer switchers than controls met LDL-C targets (69.1% vs 74.6%; P=0.005). However, among patients who switched to an equivalent dose of simvastatin (>or=2 times prior atorvastatin dose), similar proportions met LDL-C targets (72.8% vs 74.6% of controls; P=0.402), whereas among patients who switched to inappropriate non-equivalent dose of simvastatin, a significantly lower proportion met LDL-C targets (62.5% vs 74.6% of controls; P=0.001).",

Patients switched to an equivalent simvastatin dose had lower LDL-C levels and were more likely to achieve LDL-C targets than patients switched to a non-equivalent dose, suggesting physicians must consider dosage equivalence when switching statins, and should measure LDL-C and titrate statins as necessary to achieve LDL-C control.",

Eligible patients had treated or untreated hypertension, >or=3 additional cardiovascular risk factors, and baseline total cholesterol<or=6.5 mmol/L, but no coronary heart disease. The CRUCIAL trial was a 12-month, international, multicenter, prospective, stratified, cluster-randomized, parallel-design, open-label trial conducted in 20 countries in Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and Latin America. We anticipate the results of this study will be available in mid to late 2010. In this article we report the rationale for and design of the CRUCIAL trial and discuss how the challenges in the design and conduct of this cluster-randomized trial were addressed. The cluster-randomized trial design, with the investigator as the unit of randomization, was chosen to minimize contamination between the trial arms. The intent of the study was to compare the new therapeutic strategy with customary treatment practices, so no recommendation was made regarding the choice of antihypertensive or lipid-lowering drugs in the usual-care arm. It was considered that if the investigator managed both arms of the trial it would be difficult to prevent crossover of treatment strategies. Patients were enrolled in the study before the investigators were randomized to avoid selection bias. Investigators were randomized in a 1:1 ratio within each country to explicitly balance the treatment arms with respect to potential confounding factors. The cluster effect was taken into account in the sample size calculation. The findings from the CRUCIAL trial have the potential to inform current thinking on how to effectively reduce the cardiovascular risk of patients with hypertension and additional risk factors but only modestly elevated total cholesterol.",

Renal hemodynamics, function, and endothelial function were evaluated in vivo, and the number of CD34+/KDR+ EPC, apoptosis, oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis in renal tissue studied ex vivo. Compared with normal kidney, the HTC kidney showed endothelial dysfunction and increased oxidative stress, interstitial macrophage filtration, and fibrosis. The number of EPC in the kidney increased, as did their apoptosis (0.85+/-0.24% versus 0.22+/-0.07%, P<0.05 versus normal). Simvastatin did not affect blood pressure, cholesterol levels, basal renal function, or number of renal EPC in HTC, but it improved endothelial function; blunted renal oxidative stress, inflammation, and fibrosis; and attenuated EPC apoptosis (to 0.37+/-0.09%, P<0.05 versus HTC).

To determine the contribution of NF1 in bone healing, we assessed bone healing in the Nf1(ob) (-/-) conditional mouse model lacking Nf1 specifically in osteoblasts. A closed distal tibia fracture protocol and a longitudinal study design were used. During the 21- to 28-day postfracture period, callus volume, as expected, decreased in wild-type but not in Nf1(ob) (-/-) mice, suggesting delayed healing. At these two time points, bone volume (BV/TV) and volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD) measured by 3D micro-computed tomography were decreased in Nf1(ob) (-/-) callus-bridging cortices and trabecular compartments compared with wild-type controls. Histomorphometric analyses revealed the presence of cartilaginous remnants, a high amount of osteoid, and increased osteoclast surfaces in Nf1(ob) (-/-) calluses 21 days after fracture, which was accompanied by increased expression of osteopontin, Rankl, and Tgfbeta. Callus strength measured by three-point bending 28 days after fracture was reduced in Nf1(ob) (-/-) versus wild-type calluses. Importantly, from a clinical point of view, this defect of callus maturation and strength could be ameliorated by local delivery of low-dose lovastatin microparticles, which successfully decreased osteoid volume and cartilaginous remnant number and increased callus BV/TV and strength in mutant mice. These results thus indicate that the dysfunctions caused by loss of Nf1 in osteoblasts impair callus maturation and weaken callus mechanical properties and suggest that local delivery of low-dose lovastatin may improve bone healing in NF1 patients.", 
    "187": "Because of the biochemical colocalization of the 5-HT(3) receptor and antidepressants within raft-like domains and their antagonistic effects at this ligand-gated ion channel, we investigated the impact of lipid raft integrity for 5-HT(3) receptor function and its modulation by antidepressants. Treatment with methyl-beta-cyclodextrine (MbetaCD) markedly reduced membrane cholesterol levels and caused a more diffuse membrane distribution of the lipid raft marker protein flotillin-1 indicating lipid raft impairment. Both amplitude and charge of serotonin evoked cation currents were diminished following cholesterol depletion by either MbetaCD or simvastatin (Sim), whereas the functional antagonistic properties of the antidepressants desipramine (DMI) and fluoxetine (Fluox) at the 5-HT(3) receptor were retained. Although both the 5-HT(3) receptor and flotillin-1 were predominantly found in raft-like domains in western blots following sucrose density gradient centrifugation, immunocytochemistry revealed only a coincidental degree of colocalization of these two proteins. These findings and the persistence of the antagonistic effects of DMI and Fluox against 5-HT(3) receptors after lipid raft impairment indicate that their modulatory effects are likely mediated through non-raft 5-HT(3) receptors, which are not sufficiently detected by means of sucrose density gradient centrifugation. In conclusion, lipid raft integrity appears to be important for 5-HT(3) receptor function in general, whereas it is not a prerequisite for the antagonistic properties of antidepressants such as DMI and Fluox at this ligand-gated ion channel.",

    "199": "In addition to their expected effects on lipid profile, lipid-lowering agents may reduce cardiovascular events because of effects on nonclassic risk factors such as insulin resistance and inflammation. Ezetimibe specifically blocks the absorption of dietary and biliary cholesterol as well as plant sterols. Although it is known that an additional reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels can be induced by the combination of ezetimibe with statins, it is not known if this can enhance some pleiotropic effects, which may be useful in slowing the atherosclerotic process. This study assessed the effects of simvastatin and ezetimibe, in monotherapy or in combination, on markers of endothelial function and insulin sensitivity. Fifty prediabetic subjects with normo- or mild-to-moderate hypercholesterolemia were randomly allocated to 2 groups receiving either ezetimibe (10 mg/d) or simvastatin (20 mg/d) for 12 weeks, after which the drugs were combined for both groups for an additional 12-week period. Clinical and laboratory parameters were measured at baseline and after 12 and 24 weeks of therapy. Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance index and the area under the curve of insulin were calculated. As expected, both groups receiving drugs in isolation significantly reduced total cholesterol, LDL-C, apolipoprotein B, and triglyceride levels; and additional reductions were found after the combination period (P < .05). After 12 weeks of monotherapy, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 levels and urinary albumin excretion were lower in the simvastatin than in the ezetimibe group. No change in homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance index, area under the curve of insulin, and adiponectin levels was observed after either the monotherapies or the combined therapy. However, simvastatin combined with ezetimibe provoked significant reductions in E-selectin and intravascular cellular adhesion molecule-1 levels that were independent of LDL-C changes. Our findings support claims that simvastatin may be beneficial in preserving endothelial function in prediabetic subjects with normo- or mild-to-moderate hypercholesterolemia. Alternatively, a deleterious effect of ezetimibe on the endothelial function is suggested, considering the increase in intravascular cellular adhesion molecule-1 and E-selectin levels. Simvastatin and ezetimibe, in isolation or in combination, do not interfere with insulin sensitivity.", 
    "200": "Atherothrombosis, atherosclerosis and their thrombotic complications have become epidemic. Both an elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level and a decreased high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level are associated with the increased incidence of atherothrombosis. Reducing LDL using statins has been shown to provide very effective therapy for both primary and secondary prevention. Nevertheless, despite statin treatment, a large percentage of patients continues to experience cardiovascular events. Therapies aimed at increasing HDL have been investigated for several decades, with promising",

Intravenous infusion of various HDL preparations appears to lead to the accelerated regression and stabilization of atheromatous plaque, and could provide a novel approach to treatment in high-risk patients. This review describes the biological rationale underlying the use of treatments that increase HDL and discusses the potential benefits of such treatment.", 
    "203": "Functional foods and dietary supplements might have a role in supporting drug therapy. These products may (1) have an additive effect to the effect that a drug has in reducing risk factors associated with certain conditions, (2) contribute to improve risk factors associated with the condition, other than the risk factor that the drug is dealing with, or (3) reduce drug-associated side effects, for example, by restoring depleted compounds or by reducing the necessary dose of the drug. Possible advantages compared with a multidrug therapy are lower drug costs, fewer side effects and increased adherence. In the present review we have focused on the support of statin therapy using functional foods or dietary supplements containing plant sterols and/or stanols, soluble dietary fibre, n-3 PUFA or coenzyme Q10. We conclude that there is substantial evidence that adding plant sterols and/or stanols to statin therapy further reduces total and LDL-cholesterol by roughly 6 and 10 %, respectively. Adding n-3 PUFA to statin therapy leads to a significant reduction in plasma TAG of at least 15 %. Data are insufficient and not conclusive to recommend the use of soluble fibre or coenzyme Q10 in patients on statin therapy and more randomised controlled trials towards these combinations are warranted. Aside from the possible beneficial effects from functional foods or dietary supplements on drug therapy, it is important to examine possible (negative) effects from the combination in the long term, for example, in post-marketing surveillance studies. Moreover, it is important to monitor whether the functional foods and dietary supplements are taken in the recommended amounts to induce significant effects.", 
    "204": "Reduced levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) are associated with a substantially increased risk of coronary disease and cardiovascular events. Furthermore, numerous studies have suggested that HDL may exert several potentially important antiatherosclerotic and endothelial-protective effects. In particular, the promotion of reverse cholesterol transport, i.e. cholesterol efflux from lipid-loaded macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions and the subsequent cholesterol transport back to the liver, has been proposed as an anti-atherogenic effect of HDL that may promote regression of atherosclerotic lesions. Moreover, endothelial dysfunction is thought to play a critical role in development and progression of atherosclerosis and several recent studies have suggested that HDL exerts direct endothelial-protective effects, such as stimulation of endothelial production of the anti-atherogenic molecule nitric oxide, anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic effects. Furthermore, it has been observed that HDL may stimulate endothelial repair processes, involving mobilisation and promotion of endothelial repair capacity of endothelial progenitor cells. The relative significance of these different potential anti-atherosclerotic effects of HDL remains still unclear at present. Importantly, at the same time it has been recognized that the vascular effects of HDL may be variable, i.e. the capacity of HDL to stimulate macrophage cholesterol efflux and endothelial-protective effects may be altered in patients with inflammatory or cardiovascular disease. The further characterisation of underlying mechanisms and the identification of the clinical relevance of this \"HDL dysfunction\" are currently an active field of research. HDL-targeted treatment strategies are at present intensely evaluated and may lead to increased HDL plasma levels and/or HDL-stimulated anti-atherosclerotic effects. The cardiovascular protection provided by such approaches may likely depend on HDL function or quality, i.e. the anti-atherosclerotic and endothelial-protective properties of the on-treatment HDL. Currently, several HDL-raising treatment strategies are examined in clinical trials, i.e. extended-release niacin, the CETP inhibitors dalcetrapib and anacetrapib, reconstituted forms of HDL (i.e. CSL-111) or apoA-I mimetics, and some of these are already in large clinical outcome studies on top of statin therapy to determine their efficacy and safety for cardiovascular prevention.", 
    "205": "Plasma concentrations of HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) are strongly and inversely associated with cardiovascular risk, leading to the concept that therapies to enhance plasma HDL-C levels would be anti-atherogenic and protective against cardiovascular events. However, HDL are highly heterogeneous, with subclasses that can be separated and identified according to density, size, charge, and protein composition. There is evidence that these subclasses may differ in their functional anti-atherogenic properties. As a snapshot of the steady-state cholesterol carried by all HDL subclasses together, the individual HDL-C measurement is insufficient to capture the structural and functional variation in HDL particles. This review addresses the current knowledge on the structural and functional heterogeneity of HDL particles, and their relationship to cardiovascular disease, in the attempt of answering the question on whether certain subclasses of HDL may be better predictors of cardiovascular risk than HDL-C, and may be better targets than HDL-C for further improving cardiovascular disease reduction in the statin era.", 
    "206": "Population studies have consistently shown that high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels are a strong, independent inverse predictor of cardiovascular disease. Every 1 mg/dl increase in HDL cholesterol is associated with a 2% to 3% decrease in coronary artery disease risk, independent of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and triglyceride levels. The primary mechanism for this protective effect is believed to be reverse cholesterol transport, but several other anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, anti-oxidative functions for HDL have also been identified. Low HDL cholesterol is predictive of cardiovascular events in statin-treated patients with low LDL cholesterol, indicating that intensive lipid lowering strategies with statins alone are not sufficient to prevent cardiovascular events, and merging for additional effective HDL-raising therapy. This review focuses at giving an overview of current established HDL-raising pharmaca, including statins, fibrates, thiazolidinediones, and nicotinic acids, and of novel therapies including cholesterol ester transfer protein-inhibitors, liver X receptor agonists, reconstituted HDL, and apolipoprotein A-I mimetics.

    "209": "In total, 351 patients who met the modified National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III) criteria for metabolic syndrome with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels > or = 130 mg/dL were randomized to receive either rosuvastatin 10 mg (n = 173) or atorvastatin 10 mg (n = 178) for over 6 weeks.", 
    "210": "After 6 weeks of treatment, greater reductions in total cholesterol (- 35.94 +/- 11.38 vs. - 30.07 +/- 10.46%, p < 0.001), LDL-C (48.04 +/- 14.45 vs. 39.52 +/- 14.42%, p < 0.001), non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (- 42.93 +/- 13.15 vs. - 35.52 +/- 11.76%, p < 0.001), and apolipoprotein-B (- 38.7 +/- 18.85 vs. - 32.57 +/- 17.56%, p = 0.002) levels were observed in the rosuvastatin group as compared to the atorvastatin group. Overall, the percentage of patients attaining the NCEP ATP III goal was higher with rosuvastatin as compared to atorvastatin (87.64 vs. 69.88%, p < 0.001). Changes in glucose and insulin levels, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance index were not significantly different between the two groups. The safety and tolerability of the two agents were similar.", 
    "211": "Rosuvastatin 10 mg was more effective than atorvastatin 10 mg in achieving NCEP ATP III LDL-C goals in patients with nondiabetic metabolic syndrome, especially in those with lower NCEP ATP III target level goals.", 
    "212": "The objective of this study was to investigate whether common variation in genes involved in lipid metabolism modify the effect of statins on serum total cholesterol concentration. Statin users were identified in the Rotterdam Study, a prospective population-based cohort study of subjects >55 years of age. We studied the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes involved in lipid metabolism and total cholesterol response to statin therapy, using linear regression analysis and adjusting for potential confounders. Replication was performed in an independent extended cohort of the Rotterdam Study. Genotype data and total cholesterol concentrations after start of statin therapy were available for 554 newly started statin users. Two SNPs were associated with a significantly higher cholesterol concentration under statin therapy: SNP rs1532624 in the CETP gene (\u03b2: 0.141 \u2009mmol\u2009l(-1), P=0.004 per additional allele) and SNP rs533556 in the APOA1 gene (\u03b2: 0.138\u2009 mmol\u2009l(-1), P=0.005 per additional allele). In the replication sample, only the CETP rs1532624 SNP again showed a significant association. The SNPs were not related to baseline total cholesterol in non-statin users. In conclusion, we found that the CETP rs1532624 polymorphism is associated with cholesterol response to statin therapy in a cohort of elderly subjects in the general population.", 
    "213": "Activation of the renin-angiotensin system exacerbates atrial remodeling, leading to atrial fibrillation and thrombosis, especially in a condition with decreased NO bioavailability. Recently, it has been reported that statins reduce the incidence of atrial fibrillation through attenuation of atrial remodeling; however, the mechanisms have not been completely elucidated. Therefore, we aimed to clarify the beneficial effect of statin on atrial remodeling in condition with reduced NO bioavailability. Endothelial NO synthase(-/-) mice were sham operated or infused with angiotensin II (Ang II) via an osmotic minipump for 2 weeks, and Ang II-infused mice were divided into 3 treatment groups: pitavastatin, Tempol (a free radical scavenger), or vehicle. Echocardiography and electrocardiography showed that Ang II infusion caused left atrial enlargement and a high incidence of atrial fibrillation, whereas pitavastatin and Tempol prevented these abnormalities. In histological analysis, Ang II-induced atrial interstitial fibrosis, perivascular fibrosis, and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy were all attenuated by pitavastatin and Tempol. Immunohistochemical staining showed that Ang II downregulated thrombomodulin and tissue factor pathway inhibitor and upregulated tissue factor and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 in the left atrium and that pitavastatin and Tempol corrected the thrombogenic condition. Moreover, pitavastatin and Tempol reduced Ang II-induced atrial superoxide production and atrial transforming growth factor-beta1 expression and Smad 2/3 phosphorylation. Atrial rac1-GTPase activity, known to activate NADPH oxidase, was attenuated by pitavastatin but not by Tempol. In conclusion, pitavastatin exerts endothelial NO synthase-independent protective actions against Ang II-induced atrial remodeling and atrial fibrillation with enhanced thrombogenicity through suppression of oxidant injury."
