    "16": "The armamentarium for the treatment of dyslipidemia today comprises six different modes of action with overall around 24 different drugs. The treatment of lipid disorders was revolutionized with the introduction of statins which have become the most important therapeutic option available today to reduce and prevent atherosclerosis and its detrimental consequences like cardiovascular diseases and stroke. With and optimized reduction of elevated LDL levels with statins, the risk for cardiovascular diseases (CVD) can be reduced by 30%, indicating a residual remaining risk of 70% for the development and progression of CVD notifying still a high medical need for more effective antilipidemic drugs. Consequently, the search for novel lipid-modifying drugs is still one of the most active areas in research and development in the pharmaceutical industry. Major focus lies on approaches to LDL-lowering drugs superior to statins with regard to efficacy, safety, and patient compliance and on approaches modifying plasma levels and functionality of HDL particles based on the clinically validated inverse relationship between high-plasma HDL levels and the risk for CVD. The available drugs today for the treatment of dyslipidemia are small organic molecules or nonabsorbable polymers for binding of bile acids to be applied orally. Besides small molecules for novel targets, biological drugs such as monoclonal antibodies, antisense or gene-silencing oligonucleotides, peptidomimetics, reconstituted synthetic HDL particles and therapeutic proteins are novel approaches in clinical development are which have to be applied by injection or infusion. The promising clinical results of several novel drug candidates, particularly for LDL cholesterol lowering with monoclonal antibodies raised against PCSK9, may indicate more than a decade after the statins, the entrance of new breakthrough therapies to treat lipid disorders.", 
    "17": "Simvastatin and clopidogrel are commonly used together in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. Organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1 activity markedly affects the hepatic uptake of simvastatin acid, whereas both simvastatin and simvastatin acid are sensitive to changes in cytochrome P450 3A4 activity. Clopidogrel and its metabolites inhibit OATP1B1 and CYP3A4 in vitro. We studied the effect of clopidogrel on the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin in a randomized crossover study. Twelve healthy volunteers ingested either a dose of placebo (control) or 300 mg of clopidogrel on day 1 and 75 mg on days 2 and 3. Simvastatin 40 mg was administered 1 hour after placebo and after clopidogrel on days 1 and 3. Plasma drug concentrations were measured for up to 12 hours. Clopidogrel 300 mg (day 1) increased the concentrations of simvastatin and simvastatin acid during the absorption phase. After clopidogrel 300 mg, the area under the concentration time curve (AUC) of simvastatin from 0 to 2 hours was 156% (P = 0.02) and its AUC(0-12 hours) was 132% (P = 0.08) of that during placebo, whereas the AUC(0-2 hours) and the AUC(0-12 hours) of simvastatin acid were 148% (P = 0.04) and 112% (P = 0.52) of control. Clopidogrel 75 mg (day 3) had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetic variables of simvastatin or simvastatin acid compared with placebo. The effect of clopidogrel seemed independent of the SLCO1B1 c.521T>C genotype. In conclusion, as clopidogrel did not have significant effects on the total exposure to simvastatin or simvastatin acid, clopidogrel does not seem to inhibit OATP1B1 or CYP3A4 to a clinically relevant extent.",

Statins are the treatment of choice for lowering LDL-C but a considerable number of patients treated with statins are unable to achieve LDL-C target values and many are statin-intolerant. New LDL-C-lowering drugs--antibodies to PCSK9 (alirocumab, evolocumab and bococizumab)--have been developed and are being tested in large clinical trials. They further reduce LDL-C above maximally tolerated statin therapy by up to > 70%; they also reduce Lp(a), non-HDL-C, apolipoprotein-B, and modestly increase HDL-C. These drugs are well tolerated and even patients who achieved very low LDL-C \u2264 0.65 mmol/l (\u223c 25 mg/dl) did not have any significant adverse effects. Treatment with PCSK9 inhibitors resulted in LDL-C target values in 70-90% of patients according to the guidelines. However, although PCSK9 inhibitors seem to be the most promising emerging therapeutic option for LDL-C lowering today, outcome data with endpoints on their effects are still lacking. Another important open question is their long-term safety. Their use in statin-intolerant patients also raises questions, as the criteria for statin-intolerance are neither clear nor generally accepted. The presumed high cost of PCSK9 inhibitors might be an obstacle for their broader use.",

Reduction in the triglyceride levels was significantly more pronounced in group 2 than in group 1: 43.2% vs 17.4% (p < 0.02), whereas we did not observed significant changes of HDL-C and apoA1 in either group. The increases in basal glycemia, basal insulinemia, HbA1c levels (from 6.47% [6.10-7.02%] to 6.98% 16.23-8.18%]), and HOMA-IR (from 2.14 [1.68-3.51] to 4.30 [2.31-5.77]) were found only in group 2 (p < 0.05 for all). These changes were observed in 75% of patients of group 2 independently of the presence of diabetic state or IGT, but the changes were more pronounced in patients with disturbed carbohydrate metabolism. Changes of leptin levels during the therapy were diverse: 73% patients of group 1 demonstrated decrease in the leptin levels, whereas 67% of patients in group 2 experienced 57%-increase in the leptin concentrations. Degree of increased basal glycemia was associated with increase in the leptin levels (r = 0.37, p = 0.04) in the entire group of patients (n = 31). Furthermore, changes in leptin levels were negatively associated with decreased adiponectin levels (r = -0.57, p = 0.034).",

Statins decrease the growth rate of abdominal aneurysms; however their effect on the aortic root growth rate has not been elucidated. The present study evaluated the association between use of statins and aortic root growth in patients with BAV. A total of 199 patients (43 \u00b1 15 years, 69% male) with BAV who underwent \u2265 2 echocardiographic measurements of the aortic root \u2265 1 year apart were included in this retrospective observational study. Median follow-up duration was 4.7 years (interquartile range 2.7-8.3 years). Growth rate (mm/year) of the aortic root was compared between statin users (n = 41) and non-users (n = 158). Statin users were significantly older and had more cardiovascular risk factors than their counterparts. Ascending aorta diameter was significantly smaller at baseline and at follow-up in statin users compared with non-users when adjusted for coronary artery disease, age and medication. The average annual growth rate was 0.08 mm/year (95% confidence interval 0.03-0.13) for the aortoventricular junction, 0.16 mm/year (0.11-0.21) for the sinus of Valsalva, 0.12 mm/year (0.07-0.17) for the sinotubular junction and 0.45 mm/year (0.37-0.53) for the ascending aorta. The dilation rate of the aortic segments was not different between statin users and non-users. In conclusion, in patients with BAV, although the use of statins was associated with smaller ascending aorta, the annual dilation rate of the aortic root was not influenced by the use of statins.", 
    "56": "Extrusion of chemotherapeutics by ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters like ABCB1 (P-glycoprotein) represents a crucial mechanism of multidrug resistance in cancer therapy. We have previously shown that the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor simvastatin directly inhibits ABCB1, alters the glycosylation of the transporter, and enhances the intracellular accumulation of doxorubicin with subsequent anti-cancer action. Here, we show that simvastatin reduces endogenous dolichol levels and ABCB1 in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Coapplication with dolichol prevents the downregulation of the ABCB1 transporter. Importantly, dolichol also attenuated simvastatin-induced apoptosis, unmasking involvement of unfolded protein response. Direct monitoring of the fluorescent fusion protein YFP-ABCB1 further confirms concentration-dependent reduction of ABCB1 in HEK293 cells by simvastatin. In simvastatin-treated murine xenografts, ABCB1 was also reduced in the liver and rhabdomyosarcoma but did not reach significance in neuroblastoma. Nevertheless, the in vivo anti-cancer effects of simvastatin are corroborated by increased apoptosis in tumor tissues. These findings provide experimental evidence for usage of simvastatin in novel chemotherapeutic regimens and link dolichol depletion to simvastatin-induced anti-cancer activity.",

Recent data from genetic studies prove a causal relation between serum LDL-C and CV events. These data are in agreement with mechanistic molecular studies and epidemiology. New randomised clinical trial data show that LDL-C lowering with statins and a non-statin drug, ezetimibe, reduces CV events.

We simulated data assuming a nonexperimental design that attempted to quantify the effect of statin on lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. We created 324 scenarios by varying parameter values (effect size, sample size, adherence level, probability of treatment initiation, associations between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and treatment initiation and continuation). Four analytical approaches were used: 1) assuming intention to treat; 2) assuming complex mechanisms of treatment use; 3) assuming a simple mechanism of treatment use; and 4) assuming invariant confounders. With a continuous outcome, estimates assuming intention to treat were biased toward the null when there were nonnull treatment effect and nonadherence after treatment initiation. For each 1% decrease in the proportion of patients staying on treatment after initiation, the bias in estimated average treatment effect increased by 1%. Inverse-probability-of-treatment-weighted analyses that took into account the complex mechanisms of treatment use generated approximately unbiased estimates. Studies estimating the actual effect of a time-varying treatment need to consider the complex mechanisms of treatment use during weight construction.", 
    "71": "A meeting of European experts in cardiovascular (CV) disease and lipids was convened in Paris, France, on 10 November 2014 to discuss lipid profile, and in particular atherogenic dyslipidaemia (AD), and associated CV risk. Key points that were raised and discussed during the meeting are summarised in this paper, which also accounts for further discussion and agreement on these points by the group of experts. Elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) are commonly associated with a greater CV risk than low LDL-c levels, and are routinely managed with statins. However, even for patients controlled on statins and achieving low LDL-c levels, abnormal lipid profiles observed in some patients (i.e. elevated triglyceride levels, with/without low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-c]) have been linked to the presence of a residual CV risk. Therefore, it is recommended that both triglyceride and HDL-c levels be measured, to allow for the overall CV residual risk to be adequately managed. Favourable safety and clinical data support the combination of statins with other lipid-lowering agents, such as fenofibrate. Patients who have elevated triglyceride levels plus low levels of HDL-c are most likely to achieve clinical benefit from fenofibrate-statin combination therapy. In these patients with AD, achieving target non-HDL-c levels should be a key focus of CV risk management, and the use of non-HDL-c was advocated to provide a better measure of CV risk than LDL-c levels.",

Reducing cholesterol accumulation attenuated the severity of OA in mice in vivo and decreased the expression of proteases in human OA cartilage in vitro.",

    "80": "Invasive candidiasis is potentially life-threatening systemic fungal infection caused by Candida albicans (C. albicans). Candida enters the blood stream and disseminate throughout the body and it is often observed in hospitalized patients, immunocompromised individuals or those with chronic diseases. This infection is opportunistic and risk starts with the colonization of C. albicans on mucocutaneous surfaces and respiratory epithelium. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs which are involved in the regulation of virtually every cellular process. They regulate and control the levels of mRNA stability and post-transcriptional gene expression. Aberrant expression of miRNAs has been associated in many disease states, and miRNA-based therapies are in progress. In this study, we investigated possible variations of miRNA expression profiles of respiratory epithelial cells infected by invasive Candida species. For this purpose, respiratory epithelial tissues of infected individuals from hospital laboratory were accessed before their treatment. Invasive Candida infection was confirmed by isolation of Candia albicans from the blood cultures of the same infected individuals. The purity of epithelial tissues was assessed by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur cytometer; BD Biosciences, Heidelberg, Germany) using statin antibody (S-44). TaqMan quantitative real-time PCR (in a TaqMan Low Density Array format) was used for miRNA expression profiling. MiRNAs investigated, the levels of expression of 55 miRNA were significantly altered in infected tissues. Some miRNAs showed dramatic increase (miR-16-1) or decrease of expression (miR-17-3p) as compared to control. Gene ontology enrichment analysis of these miRNA-targeted genes suggests that Candidal infection affect many important biological pathways. In summary, disturbance in miRNA expression levels indicated the change in cascade of pathological processes and the regulation of respiratory epithelial functions following invasive Candidal infection. These findings contribute to our understanding of host cell response to Candidal systemic infections.",

While guidelines are broadly applicable in Europe, in the Middle East we experience a range of confounding factors that complicate disease management to a point whereby the European guidance cannot be applied without significant modification. Specifically, for disease prevalence, the Middle East region has an established epidemic of diabetes and metabolic syndrome that can complicate treatment and mask a clinical diagnosis of HoFH. We have also a high incidence of consanguineous marriages, which increase the risk of transmission of recessive and homozygous genetic disorders. This risk is further augmented in autosomal dominant disorders such as familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH), in which a range of defective genes can be transmitted, all of which contribute to the phenotypic expression of the disease. In terms of treatment, we do not have access to lipoprotein apheresis on the same scale as in Europe, and there remains a significant reliance on statins, ezetimibe and the older plasma exchange methods. Additionally, we do not have widespread access to anti-apolipoprotein B therapies and microsomal transfer protein inhibitors. In order to adapt existing global guidance documents on HoFH to the Middle East region, we convened a panel of experts from Oman, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Iran and Bahrain to draft a regional guidance document for HoFH. We also included selected experts from outside the region.

Administration of these tolerogenic DCs led to amelioration of experimental autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG). The protective effect was mainly mediated by inhibited cellular immune response, including up-regulated regulatory T cells and shifted Th1/Th17 to Th2 cytokines. The present study employed atorvastatin-modified bone marrow-derived DCs (AT-BMDCs) to explore the effect of tolerogenic DCs on humoral immune response of EAMG and further elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Our data showed that AT-BMDCs reduced the quantity and the relative affinity of pathogenic antibodies, suppressed germinal center response, decreased follicular helper T cells and IL-21, and increased regulatory B cells. These results suggest that AT-BMDCs ameliorate EAMG by regulating humoral immune response, thus providing new insights into therapeutic approaches of myasthenia gravis and other autoimmune diseases.",

Initially, a large amount of cholesterol accumulated in the hyperlipidemic hamster livers. After BBR treatment, reductions in the liver cholesterol were observed by day 3 and became significant by day 7 at both doses (P < 0.001). Meanwhile, bile cholesterol was elevated by day 3 and significantly increased at day 10 (P < 0.001).

    "98": "Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the vasculature and is the primary cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD). CVD is currently the world's leading cause of death and the numbers are predicted to rise further because of a global increase in risk factors such as diabetes and obesity. Current therapies such as statins have had a major impact in reducing mortality from CVD. However, there is a marked residual CVD risk in patients on statin therapy. It is therefore important to understand the molecular basis of this disease in detail and to develop alternative novel therapeutics. Interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is often regarded as a master regulator of atherosclerosis development.

    "103": "Statins, inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, are used to reduce cholesterol biosynthesis in the liver. Accordingly, statins regulate nitric oxide (NO) and glutamate metabolism, inflammation, angiogenesis, immunity and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) functions. The function of EPCs are regulated by stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2), etc. Even though the pharmacologic mechanisms by which statins affect the neovasculogenesis of circulating EPCs, it is still unknown whether statins affect the EPCs function through the regulation of CXCR4, a SDF-1 receptor expression. Therefore, we desired to explore the effects of statins on CXCR4 expression in EPC-mediated neovascularization by in vitro and in vivo analyses. In animal studies, we analyzed the effects of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin treatments in recovery of capillary density and blood flow, the expression of vWF and CXCR4 at ischemia sites in hindlimb ischemia ICR mice. Additionally, we analyzed whether the atorvastatin or rosuvastatin treatments increased the mobilization, homing, and CXCR4 expression of EPCs in hindlimb ischemia ICR mice that underwent bone marrow transplantation. The results indicated that statins treatment led to significantly more CXCR4-positive endothelial progenitor cells incorporated into ischemic sites and in the blood compared with control mice. In vivo, we isolated human EPCs and analyzed the effect of statins treatment on the vasculogenic ability of EPCs and the expression of CXCR4. Compared with the control groups, the neovascularization ability of EPCs was significantly improved in the atorvastatin or rosuvastatin group; this improvement was dependent on CXCR4 up-regulation. The efficacy of statins on improving EPC neovascularization was related to the SDF-1\u03b1/CXCR4 axis and might be regulated by the NO. In conclusion, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin improved neovascularization in hindlimb ischemia mice; this effect may have been mediated by increased CXCR4 expression in EPCs.",

    "108": "Lovastatin, the progenitor of the statin family, is in fact a naturally occurring compound produced by the yeast Monascus purpureus. Red yeast rice (RYR), a traditional Chinese food made by fermenting rice with M purpureus, is an herbal medicine that has been used for 1200 y as a therapy for problems related to circulation and digestion. RYR contains a range of compounds known as monacolins, of which monacolin K-renamed lovastatin by pharmaceutical researchers-was found to be the most potent inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis. Standardized extracts of RYR, providing 10 mg of monacolins daily, have been shown to lower elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by approximately 20%. In a large secondary prevention trial in China, RYR was found to be markedly protective with respect to cardiovascular events and total mortality. Yet RYR very rarely induces the myopathy and hepatic damage commonly seen with prescription statin therapy. The Chinese herbal compound berberine, used to treat diabetes and congestive heart failure in China, has been shown to increase hepatic expression of LDL receptors and, hence, to lower LDL cholesterol, by extending the half-life of LDL receptor messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA). This effect is complementary to the increased transcription of this mRNA promoted by statin therapy. Because berberine is well tolerated aside from transient gastrointestinal (GI) upset in some people and, in particular, has not been reported to cause myopathy or hepatic damage, the combination of RYR and berberine may have the potential to achieve reductions in LDL cholesterol comparable with those achieved with prescription statin therapy, but without the associated risks such as muscle damage and diabetes. Moreover, berberine, via its ability to activate adenosine monophosphate-activated kinase (AMPK), which it shares with the drug metformin, can lower triglycerides, improve metabolic syndrome, aid glycemic control in diabetics, and act directly on the vasculature to promote vascular health. It may also have the potential to reduce risk for various cancers, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, nonalcoholic fatty-liver disease, and neurodegenerative disorders, although such predictions are highly speculative. Whereas statin therapy modestly increases risk for type 2 diabetes, berberine likely has the opposite effect. These considerations suggest that combined administration of RYR and berberine may provide a broader range of health protection than is afforded by prescription statin therapy, with lower risks for serious adverse effects compared with statins. Randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of optimal intakes of RYR and berberine on serum lipids and other vascular risk factors are needed.",

The simvastatin-loaded star-shaped CA-PLGA nanoparticles were prepared through a modified nanoprecipitation method. The data showed that the fluorescence star-shaped CA-PLGA nanoparticles could be internalized into MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 human breast cancer cells. The simvastatin-loaded star-shaped CA-PLGA nanoparticles achieved significantly higher level of cytotoxicity than pristine simvastatin and simvastatin-loaded linear PLGA nanoparticles. Moreover, the expression of the cell cycle protein cyclin D1 was dramatically inhibited by simvastatin in both cells, with simvastatin-loaded star-shaped CA-PLGA nanoparticles having the greatest effect. MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumor model on BALB/c nude mice showed that simvastatin-loaded star-shaped CA-PLGA nanoformulations could effectively inhibit the growth of tumor over a longer period of time than pristine simvastatin and simvastatin-loaded linear PLGA nanoformulations at the same dose. In agreement with these, the nuclear expression of proliferation marker Ki-67 in simvastatin-loaded star-shaped CA-PLGA nanoparticles group was reduced to a most extent among four groups through tumor frozen section immunohistochemistry.

Seventy male Wistar rats were divided into five groups: 20 in the control group, 20 in the AS group, 10 in the simvastatin group, 10 in the low-dose icariin group, and 10 in the high-dose icariin group. A HCD and vitamin D3 were administered to establish AS rat model.

The levels of blood lipids, superoxide dismutase (SOD), and malonaldehyde (MDA) were measured. The mRNA levels of interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR, and the serum levels of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 were measured using ELISA kit. In addition, the expression of phosphorylated p38 (p-p38) MAPK was detected by Western blot analysis. The results indicated that AS rat models were successfully constructed. In the AS group, the levels of blood lipids including total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), and MDA were significantly increased, while high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) and SOD were significantly decreased, compared with those in the control group. However, icariin succeeded in improving these biochemical parameters towards the normal values in the control group. In the simvastatin group and the icariin groups, the serum levels of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 and the related tissue mRNA levels, as well as the expression of p-p38 MAPK, were markedly reduced compared with the AS group. In conclusion, the present study indicated that icariin inhibited the HCD-induced dyslipidemia in rats, the mechanisms may be associated with the anti-inflammation, anti-oxidative stress, and downregulation of p-p38 MAPK by icariin.",

Its hydrolase activity is associated with endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) dysfunction. However, little is known about the role of sEH phosphatase in regulating eNOS activity. Simvastatin, a clinical lipid-lowering drug, also has a pleiotropic effect on eNOS activation. However, whether sEH phosphatase is involved in simvastatin-activated eNOS activity remains elusive. We investigated the role of sEH phosphatase activity in simvastatin-mediated activation of eNOS in endothelial cells (ECs). Simvastain increased the phosphatase activity of sEH, which was diminished by pharmacological inhibitors of sEH phosphatase. In addition, pharmacological inhibition of sEH phosphatase or overexpressing the inactive phosphatase domain of sEH enhanced simvastatin-induced NO bioavailability, tube formation and phosphorylation of eNOS, Akt, and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). In contrast, overexpressing the phosphatase domain of sEH limited the simvastatin-increased NO biosynthesis and eNOS phosphorylation at Ser1179. Simvastatin evoked epidermal growth factor receptor-c-Src-increased Tyr phosphorylation of sEH and formation of an sEH-Akt-AMPK-eNOS complex, which was abolished by the c-Src kinase inhibitor PP1 or c-Src dominant-negative mutant K298M.

One potential explanation for the lack of efficacy in the clinical setting is that in bench models, a single intervention is studied without the background of other interventions or modalities. This is in contrast to the clinical setting in which new medications are added to the \"standard of care\" treatment that by now includes a growing number of medications. Drug-drug interaction may lead to alteration, dampening, augmenting or masking the effects of the intended intervention. We use the well described model of statin-induced myocardial protection to demonstrate potential interactions with agents which are commonly concomitantly used in patients with stable coronary artery disease and/or acute coronary syndromes. These interactions could potentially explain the reduced efficacy of statins in the clinical trials compared to the animal models. In particular, caffeine and aspirin could attenuate the infarct size limiting effects of statins; morphine could delay the onset of protection or mask the protective effect in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction, whereas other anti-platelet agents (dipyridamole, cilostazol and ticagrelor) may augment (or mask) the effect due to their favorable effects on adenosine cell reuptake and intracellular cAMP levels.

The enzyme HMG CoA reductase (HMGCR) is responsible for cholesterol synthesis, and inhibitors of this enzyme (statins) have been used clinically to control blood cholesterol. Sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) -2 is a key transcription factor in cholesterol metabolism, and HMGCR is a target gene of SREBP-2. Attenuating SREBP-2 activity could potentially minimize the expression of HMGCR. Luteolin is a flavone that is commonly detected in plant foods. In the present study, Luteolin suppressed the expression of SREBP-2 at concentrations as low as 1 \u03bcM in the hepatic cell lines WRL and HepG2. This flavone also prevented the nuclear translocation of SREBP-2. Post-translational processing of SREBP-2 protein was required for nuclear translocation. Luteolin partially blocked this activation route through increased AMP kinase (AMPK) activation. At the transcriptional level, the mRNA and protein expression of SREBP-2 were reduced through luteolin. A reporter gene assay also verified that the transcription of SREBF2 was weakened in response to this flavone. The reduced expression and protein processing of SREBP-2 resulted in decreased nuclear translocation. Thus, the transcription of HMGCR was also decreased after luteolin treatment. In summary, the results of the present study showed that luteolin modulates HMGCR transcription by decreasing the expression and nuclear translocation of SREBP-2.",

This review evaluates the impact of fibrates, niacin, and long-chain omega-3 fatty acids on lipid profiles and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with hypertriglyceridemia. It also assesses the adverse effects and drug-drug interactions associated with these triglyceride-lowering agents, because although they have all been shown to effectively reduce triglyceride levels in patients with hypertriglyceridemia, they differ with regard to their associated benefit-risk profiles. Long-chain omega-3 fatty acids may be a well-tolerated and effective alternative to fibrates and niacin, yet further large-scale clinical studies are required to evaluate their effects on cardiovascular outcomes and CVD risk reduction in patients with hypertriglyceridemia.",

To test this hypothesis, we used nanoparticle-based delivery of simvastatin to inhibit plaque macrophage proliferation in apolipoprotein E deficient mice (Apoe(-/-) ) with advanced atherosclerotic plaques. This resulted in rapid reduction of plaque inflammation and favorable phenotype remodeling. We then combined this short-term nanoparticle intervention with an eight-week oral statin treatment, and this regimen rapidly reduced and continuously suppressed plaque inflammation. Our results demonstrate that pharmacologically inhibiting local macrophage proliferation can effectively treat inflammation in atherosclerosis.",

Among factors with relatively strong evidence (pooled population >5000) in our meta-analysis, we found grade I evidence for 4 medical exposures (oestrogen, statin, antihypertensive medications and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs therapy) as well as 4 dietary exposures (folate, vitamin E/C and coffee) as protective factors of AD. We found grade I evidence showing that one biochemical exposure (hyperhomocysteine) and one psychological condition (depression) significantly increase risk of developing AD. We also found grade I evidence indicative of complex roles of pre-existing disease (frailty, carotid atherosclerosis, hypertension, low diastolic blood pressure, type 2 diabetes mellitus (Asian population) increasing risk whereas history of arthritis, heart disease, metabolic syndrome and cancer decreasing risk) and lifestyle (low education, high body mass index (BMI) in mid-life and low BMI increasing the risk whereas cognitive activity, current smoking (Western population), light-to-moderate drinking, stress, high BMI in late-life decreasing the risk) in influencing AD risk. We identified no evidence suggestive of significant association with occupational exposures.",

This suggests that variations in the CYP3A5 and POR genes may influence the response to statins. We aimed to investigate the association and interactions between CYP3A5*3 and POR*28 polymorphisms and the lipid-lowering effects of atorvastatin in a Chinese population.",

POR*28 single nucleotide polymorphisms are associated with greater increases in the effect on plasma lipids in non-expressors of CYP3A5. Besides CYP3A5*3 genetic polymorphism, POR*28 genetic polymorphism might also be responsible for the marked interindividual variability in the lipid-lowering response to atorvastatin.", 
    "209": "Statins are the mainstay of lipid-lowering therapies targeted at reducing cardiovascular risk. However, they do not completely obviate risk, not all patients tolerate them, and they are not sufficiently effective in patients with very high plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) such as those with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) or patients with elevated plasma levels of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)]. Recent advances in the understanding of lipoprotein metabolism have led to the development of the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors including evolocumab , which lowers plasma levels of LDL-C by 50 - 75% as monotherapy or in combination with statin therapy.",

    "211": "The dramatic reduction in plasma levels of LDL-C attributable to evolocumab is anticipated to translate into lower rates of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, but this hypothesis remains to be proven. Also to be established are the long-term safety and economic benefits of evolocumab. PCSK9 inhibitors will also probably provide a valuable option for patients with statin intolerance, those with FH and patients with elevated plasma levels of Lp(a).",

    "213": "We compare the responses of the in vitro human and cynomolgus vascular systems to 4 statins. Although statins exert beneficial pleiotropic effects on the human vasculature, the mechanism of action is difficult to investigate at the tissue level. Using RNA sequencing, we quantified the response to statins and report that most statins significantly increased the expression of genes that promote vascular health while suppressing inflammatory cytokine gene expression. Applying computational pathway analytics, we identified statin-regulated biological themes, independent of cholesterol lowering, that provide mechanisms for off-target effects, including thrombosis, cell cycle regulation, glycogen metabolism, and ethanol degradation.",

    "216": "We conducted a retrospective study of patients with localized prostate cancer treated with definitive external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy. Univariate and multivariate cox proportional hazards models were used to investigate the influence of the following factors on OS: age, neutrophil and lymphocyte counts, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score as well as comorbidities associated with inflammation such as cardiac history, diabetes and use of a statin. A stepwise selection of variable based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC) was used for multivariate analysis.",

The aims of this study were to investigate the lipid profiles of RA patients, to assess the relationships between lipid profiles and RA activity and treatment, and to elucidate the effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) in Japanese patients with RA. A multicenter observational study was conducted in 488 patients with RA. Serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, and RA activity as assessed by disease activity score 28 (DAS28), and treatment for RA were analyzed retrospectively. In statin-treated patients, drug efficacy was also analyzed. The prevalence of hyper LDL-C, hyper TG, and hypo HDL-C were 29.3, 24.2, and 10.2%, respectively, and the overall prevalence of dyslipidemia was 56.5%. The level of HDL-C was inversely correlated with DAS28. Patients treated with low-dose glucocorticoids showed significantly higher levels of HDL-C and lower TC/HDL-C ratios compared with patients not receiving glucocorticoid treatment. Conversely, patients treated with biologic agents showed significantly higher levels of LDL-C, lower levels of HDL-C, and higher TC/HDL-C ratios. Atorvastatin significantly improved lipid profiles after a few months of treatment. The prevalence of dyslipidemia in Japanese patients with RA is higher than that in the non-RA population. Our result suggests that controlling RA disease activity might improve lipid profiles and eventually lower cardiovascular risk. Low-dose atorvastatin was effective for treatment of dyslipidemia in RA patients but had no apparent effect on RA disease activity.",

While data from completed studies has clearly demonstrated substantive benefit of statins in early CKD, the effects in end-stage CKD remain controversial. Recent studies have also suggested that the effects of different statins on the kidney may be heterogeneous, and the safety of high-dose statins in this population remains uncertain. Communications from regulators such as the US Food and Drug Administration concerning potential side effects of statin therapy (particularly memory loss and the risk of diabetes) have created debate in the medical literature and unrest in the public mind about the value of long-term statin therapy for vulnerable patient populations. The evaluation of risks and benefits for this class of agents is critically dependent on baseline risk. This article will review current evidence for the benefits and risks of statin therapy for kidney and cardiovascular disease progression in the CKD population."
