    "0": "Rosuvastatin (Crestor, AstraZeneca) is a synthetic statin that represents an advance on the pharmacologic and clinical properties of other agents in this class. Relative to other statins, rosuvastatin possesses a greater number of binding interactions with HMG-CoA reductase and has a high affinity for the active site of the enzyme. Rosuvastatin is relatively hydrophilic and is selectively taken up by, and active in, hepatic cells. Rosuvastatin has the longest terminal half-life of the statins and is only minimally metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP 450) enzyme system with no significant involvement of the 3A4 enzyme. Consistent with this finding is the absence of clinically significant drug interactions between rosuvastatin and other drugs known to inhibit CYP 450 enzymes. In patients with hypercholesterolemia, rosuvastatin 10-40 mg has been shown to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels by 52-63%, as well as increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels by up to 14% and reduce triglycerides (TG) by up to 28%. Studies have shown that rosuvastatin is superior to atorvastatin, simvastatin and pravastatin in reducing LDL-C and favorably modifying other components of the atherogenic lipid profile. The significant decreases in LDL-C with rosuvastatin treatment should help to improve attainment of lipid goals and reduce the requirement for dose titration. In addition, the effects of rosuvastatin on HDL-C and TG levels will be of benefit in treating patients with abnormalities such as mixed dyslipidemia and the metabolic syndrome. Rosuvastatin is well tolerated, with a safety profile comparable with that of other currently available statins.",

    "5": "In each case the personality disruption, once evident, was sustained until statin use was discontinued; and resolved promptly with drug cessation. In four patients, re-challenge with statins occurred, and led to recrudescence of the problem. All patients experienced other recognized statin adverse effects while on the drug. Manifestations of severe irritability included homicidal impulses, threats to others, road rage, generation of fear in family members, and damage to property.", 
    "6": "Case series invariably raise more questions than they can answer. These case reports suggest that severe irritability may occur in some statin users. Although this adverse effect may be rare, potentially life-threatening adverse effects of drugs must be taken seriously.",

Although weight reduction and statin therapy reduce HSCRP levels, the independent effects of cardiac rehabilitation programs on HSCRP are not well established.", 
    "9": "We analyzed plasma levels of HSCRP in 277 patients with CHD (235 consecutive patients before and after formal phase II cardiac rehabilitation and exercise training programs and 42 \"control\" patients who did not attend cardiac rehabilitation). Additionally, we determined the effects of cardiac rehabilitation on HSCRP independent of statin therapy and weight loss.",

Mean (5.9 +/- 7.7 to 3.8 +/- 5.8 mg/l; -36%; p < 0.0001) and median levels of HSCRP (-41%; p = 0.002) decreased significantly in the rehabilitation group but not in the control population. Similar significant reductions in HSCRP occurred in the rehabilitation patients regardless of whether they received statin therapy or lost weight.", 
    "11": "Therapeutic lifestyle changes effected through a three-month cardiac rehabilitation program significantly improved numerous cardiac risk factors. Through this holistic approach to secondary prevention, we observed significant reductions in HSCRP levels. These findings identify another clinical modality of reducing HSCRP beyond use of statin drugs and suggest an additional benefit of formal phase II cardiac rehabilitation and exercise training programs.", 
    "12": "The incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is very high in patients with chronic kidney (CKD) disease and in kidney transplant recipients. Indeed, available evidence for these patients suggests that the 10-year cumulative risk of coronary heart disease is at least 20%, or roughly equivalent to the risk seen in patients with previous CVD. Recently, the National Kidney Foundation's Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) published guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of dyslipidemias in patients with CKD, including transplant patients. It was the conclusion of this Work Group that the National Cholesterol Education Program Guidelines are generally applicable to patients with CKD, but that there are significant differences in the approach and treatment of dyslipidemias in patients with CKD compared with the general population. In the present document we present the guidelines generated by this workgroup as they apply to kidney transplant recipients. Evidence from the general population indicates that treatment of dyslipidemias reduces CVD, and evidence in kidney transplant patients suggests that judicious treatment can be safe and effective in improving dyslipidemias. Dyslipidemias are very common in CKD and in transplant patients. However, until recently there have been no adequately powered, randomized, controlled trials examining the effects of dyslipidemia treatment on CVD in patients with CKD. Since completion of the K/DOQI guidelines on dyslipidemia in CKD, the results of the Assessment of Lescol in Renal Transplantation (ALERT) Study have been presented and published. Based on information from randomized trials conducted in the general population and the single study conducted in kidney transplant patients, these guidelines, which are a modified version of the K/DOQI dyslipidemia guidelines, were developed to aid clinicians in the management of dyslipidemias in kidney transplant patients. These guidelines are divided into four sections. The first section (Introduction) provides the rationale for the guidelines, and describes the target population, scope, intended users, and methods. The second section presents guidelines on the assessment of dyslipidemias (guidelines 1-3), while the third section offers guidelines for the treatment of dyslipidemias (guidelines 4-5). The key guideline statements are supported mainly by data from studies in the general population, but there is an urgent need for additional studies in CKD and in transplant patients. Therefore, the last section outlines recommendations for research.", 
    "13": "Peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) is common in older age. PAOD is associated with an increased risk of vascular events (eg, myocardial infarction or stroke). Therefore, the prevention and treatment of PAOD is important, especially at a time when the elderly population is increasing. There is an association between lipid abnormalities and the risk of developing PAOD. However, it is not yet definitively established that early intervention with lipid-lowering drugs prevents the development of PAOD. There is evidence that vascular events in patients with PAOD can be significantly reduced by statins and that the symptoms associated with PAOD are improved by this treatment. There is an urgent need for appropriately designed lipid-lowering trials in patients with PAOD.",

Conscientiousness, according to the Five Factor Theory of Personality, and estimated IQ remained robust predictors of adherence in hierarchical regression analyses. Depression and anxiety, mental flexibility, and visuospatial-constructional ability were less robust but statistically significant (p <.05) correlates of adherence.",

Only six out of the 22 finally tolerated at least one member of this family of drugs. In three of these six the first statin prescribed allowed training performance without any limitation. Changing the drug demonstrated that only two tolerated all the four or five statins examined (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin). Cerivastatin was not among the statins prescribed.",

    "26": "Receptor-associated protein (RAP) is a ligand for all members of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor families. RAP is internalized into cells via receptor-mediated endocytic trafficking, making it an attractive mechanism for efficient gene delivery. In this study, we have developed a gene delivery system using RAP as a targeting ligand. A RAP cDNA lacking a C-terminal heparin-binding domain was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from a human liver cDNA library and was reamplified by using a primer containing a cysteine codon at its carboxyl end to facilitate its conjugation to polylysine (polyK). RAP was purified using a bacterial expression system and coupled to poly-D-lysine (PDL) or poly-L-lysine (PLL) of average MW 50 kDa via the heterobifunctional cross-linker SPDP. Using fluorescence-labeled RAP ligand, cellular uptake of the transfection complexes into HepG2 cells was shown to be highly efficient and more specific to PDL-conjugated RAP compared with PLL-conjugated one. Plasmid DNA containing a luciferase reporter gene was condensed with either RAP-PDL or RAP-PLL. In vitro transfection into HepG2 cells with RAP-PDL conjugate resulted in significantly higher luciferase expression levels in comparison to either nonconjugated PDL, or RAP-PLL, or LipofecAMINE/DNA complexes in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum. Luciferase expression was inhibited by the addition of excess RAP. Treatment of the cells with Lovastatin, which inhibits HMG-Co reductase and increases expression of LDL receptor, stimulates luciferase expression, suggesting that the gene delivery is specifically mediated by LDL receptor. Thus, RAP-PDL conjugates have the potential to be used as a new nonviral gene delivery vector.", 
    "27": "Evidence for the effectiveness of lipid-lowering therapy in reducing CHD risk continues to emerge. In primary prevention, clinical trials have demonstrated a benefit for middle-aged, high-risk men with high LDL cholesterol and, more recently, for men and women with \"average\" LDL and low HDL cholesterol. Although low HDL cholesterol, small dense LDL particles, elevated lipoprotein (a), elevated apolipoprotein B, and the dyslipidemia of the metabolic syndrome pose an increased in CHD risk in some patients, the risk reduction with lipid-lowering therapy has not been fully investigated. The CHD risk of isolated hypertriglyceridemia remains uncertain. Very high triglyceride levels, however, should be treated to prevent pancreatitis. A lipid-lowering diet and other appropriate lifestyle changes constitute safe advice for all patients with dyslipidemia. In initiating pharmacologic therapy, physicians should view potential risk reduction in the context of a patient's overall CHD risk. The selection of particular medications can be individualized, considering effectiveness evidence from clinical trials, lipid-lowering potency, adverse effects, drug interactions, costs, and patient preferences.",

Whether this effect is related to antioxidant properties of this class of drugs is poorly understood. The aim of the present report was to evaluate the regulation of nitrotyrosine production during the development of load-induced LVH and the effect of simvastatin treatment in this process. Rats were subjected to aortic constriction up to 15 days. LVH was evaluated by left/right ventricle mass ratio. Myocardial content of nitrotyrosine, nitric oxide synthase (NOS) isoforms, and phagocyte-type NAD(P)H-oxidase subunits (p67-phox and p22-phox) were analyzed by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry assays. Another group of rats received treatment with either simvastatin or placebo for 15 days after the onset of pressure overload, and their hearts were also studied. Myocardial nitrotyrosine content was increased from 3 to 15 days of pressure overload in regions of cardiac myocytes in close apposition to myocardial stroma during LVH. Neuronal NOS (nNOS), inducible NOS (iNOS), and endothelial NOS (eNOS) isoforms had their expression increased in coronary vessels (nNOS and iNOS) and in myocardial stroma (eNOS) from day 3 to day 7 of aortic constriction. However, p67-phox and p22-phox expression was increased in cells of myocardial stroma in parallel to augmented myocardial nitrotyrosine content. Simvastatin treatment inhibited the increases in myocardial nitrotyrosine content and in p67-phox and p22-phox expression, and significantly reduced LVH. In conclusion, antioxidant properties of simvastatin might play a role in myocardial remodeling induced by pressure overload.",

    "49": "At a time when the lipid management guidelines give more and more emphasis to the identification and treatment of high-risk patients with the metabolic syndrome and diabetes, there is an obvious need to balance the known effects of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) lowering with the new evidence of clinical efficacy derived from the adjustment of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and triglyceride levels. Whereas the statins remain the drug of choice for patients who need to reach the LDL goal, fibrate therapy may represent the best intervention for subjects with atherogenic dyslipidemia and an LDL already close to goal. In addition, the concomitant use of fibrates may significantly reduce cardiovascular risk in patients whose LDL is controlled by statin therapy. In this review, we evaluate the pharmacologic properties of the fibrate drugs, with particular attention to the effects of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor a activation in the control of dyslipidemia as well as in the attenuation of arterial inflammation. Clinical trials of fibrates, such as the Helsinki Heart Study, Veterans Affairs High-density lipoprotein Intervention Trial, Diabetes Atherosclerosis Intervention Study, and Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention trial, have conjured up a scenario for the clinical utility of fibrates and their possible superiority to statins in the management of obese, insulin-resistant, and diabetic patients presenting with near-goal LDL and inappropriate HDL and triglyceride levels.", 
    "50": "The advent of safe and effective hypolipidemic therapy has revolutionized the ability of the clinician to optimize abnormalities in the lipid profile. The advent of statin therapy has provided a potent option to decrease low-density lipoprotein and frequently allows achievement of National Cholesterol Education Program target lipid levels with monotherapy. However, lipid goals are frequently not achieved due to inadequate response to therapy or side effects. The role of combination therapy in the optimization of the lipid profile provides a means by which the implementation of pharmacologic agents with synergistic mechanisms of action allows further improvement in circulating levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Statins have been combined with bile acid resins, fibric acid derivatives, and nicotinic acid. However, bile acid resins, although not systemically absorbed, have significant problems with patient compliance and drug interactions. The implementation of therapy with fibric acid derivatives or nicotinic acid increases the risk of significant side effects such as rhabdomyolysis or liver toxicity. Ezetimibe is a prototype of a new class of agents that specifically block the absorption of cholesterol from the gastrointestinal tract. Ezetimibe has minimal systemic absorption and a metabolic pathway involving enterohepatic circulation that allows for once a day administration due to a prolonged half-life. Ezetimibe lacks the drug interactions that are common with the bile acid resins and it may be utilized as either monotherapy or in combination with other pharmacologic agents. Ezetimibe has a relatively flat dose-response curve and titration is not required. This review centers on the role of pharmacologic agents that act predominantly by the reduction of cholesterol absorption, including colesevelam and ezetimibe.", 
    "51": "Statins have proven their therapeutical value for a wide range of patients with coronary heart disease. The average reduction of the relative risk for cardiovascular events is 23%. This remains true even in the light of ALLHAT, which had failed to show a significant reduction in mortality in the statin subgroup, yet its significance suffered from an insufficient difference in the reduction of plasma lipids in the intervention group as compared to usual care. On the other hand, ASCOT and PROSPER have demonstrated the efficacy of statins in normolipemic hypertensives and elderly patients. The safety of statin therapy can be considered as good; for example the Prospective Pravastatin Pooling Project with 19,592 patients found a rate of unexpected events equal to placebo.", 
    "52": "The results of a cholesterol lowering therapy with statins do belong to the best documented steps in medical treatment. The newer studies like HPS and LIPID have shown a therapeutic benefit across all serum-cholesterol levels, nearly obviating the need for a prior determination of the cholesterol values. Why not using the serum-cholesterol level as the only guide to therapy? Since there is no threshold indicating the need for treatment, there is the danger of an unlimited inflation of the indications for therapy, possibly leading to a collapse of the health care system. At the upper extreme, therapy would have to start at a very young age, and no one can predict the side effects of a statin therapy over many decades. Improving the target for therapy can only be achieved via determination of the total risk of cardiovascular disease. Several algorithms like PROCAM ( www.chd-taskforce.de), the risk chart of the European Society of Cardiology or the Framingham risk-scores will come to similar results. In this manner, one can differentiate further, and persons with a low risk of cardiovascular disease like women and young adults do not have to be treated unnecessarily. However, it must not be overlooked that the sensitivity of these risk-scores is rather low. The majority of myocardial infarctions occur in the average risk population, because of sheer numbers. Independent indicators of cardiovascular risk, such as the CRP, the intima-media thickness of the carotid artery and in particular the determination of the coronary calcium score via EBT or ultrafast scan can lead to more clarity. To improve the estimation of the individual risk, we will need a combination of risk-factors and -indicators.",

Primary outcomes are cognition (cognitive battery), irritability/aggression (behavior measure), and serotonin (gauged by whole blood serotonin), assessed as the difference between baseline and 6 months, judging combined statin groups vs. placebo. Secondary outcomes include mood (CES-D and Wakefield depression inventory), quality of life (SF-12V), sleep (Leeds sleep scale, modified), and secondary aggression measures (Conflict Tactics Scale; Overt Aggression Scale, Modified). Cardiovascular reactivity will be examined in a 10% subset. As additional secondary endpoints, primary and selected secondary outcomes will be assessed by statin assignment (lipophilic simvastatin vs. hydrophilic pravastatin). \"Reversibility\" of changes, if any, at 2 months postcessation will be determined.

We evaluated the prevalence of hyperlipidemia in pediatric heart transplant recipients and assessed the efficacy and safety of pravastatin therapy.", 
    "60": "We performed a retrospective chart review of lipid profiles > or =1 year after surgery in 50 pediatric cardiac transplant recipients to assess the incidence of hyperlipidemia. Twenty of these patients received pravastatin for hypercholesterolemia. Their primary immunosuppression therapy was cyclosporine/prednisone plus either azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil. We reviewed serial lipid profiles, creatinine phosphokinase, and liver enzymes.", 
    "61": "Overall, 36% of the patients (n = 50) had total cholesterol (TC) concentrations > 200 mg/dl and 52% had low-density lipoprotein (LDL) >110 mg/dL beyond 1 year after transplantation. Of the 20 treated with pravastatin, TC (236 +/- 51 vs 174 +/- 33 mg/dl) and LDL levels (151 +/- 32 vs 99 +/- 21 mg/dl) decreased significantly with therapy (p <.0001). We found no symptoms; however, 1 patient had increased creatinine phosphokinase. Liver enzyme concentrations remained normal in all.", 
    "62": "Hypercholesterolemia is prevalent in pediatric cardiac transplant recipients. Pravastatin therapy is effective in decreasing TC and LDL levels, seems to be safe, and is tolerated well. Further studies are necessary to determine whether pravastatin treatment is beneficial in decreasing CAV.", 
    "63": "Patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) are at an increased risk of premature cardiovascular disease (CVD). The benefits of statin therapy are not well known since no placebo controlled studies have been performed in these patients. The aim of this study was to determine the CVD event and mortality risk in statin-treated patients with FH. A total of 345 FH patients were followed prospectively for 8 years. Mortality from CVD was compared to that of the general population. The absolute risk of CVD in patients without a previous history of CVD was 3% per year for men and 1.6% for women. Mortality from CVD in patients without a previous history was 1.4-fold (95% CI = 0.6-3.3) increased and ischaemic heart disease (IHD) mortality was 2.6-fold (95% CI = 1.1-6.3) higher compared to the general population. This mortality risk was highest in patients aged 40-59 years. Female FH patients had no increased CVD or IHD mortality risk. Over a period of 8 years the event risk of patients with a history of CVD was almost 30% per year under age 40 years and 15% in patients aged 60 years and over. When compared to the general population, mortality from other causes than CVD was lower for patients with FH, the relative risks not reaching statistical significance. The relative risk of mortality from all causes was 1.5 (P < 0.05) for men and 1.0 for women. In conclusion, male patients with FH, treated from middle-age with statins remain at an increased risk of developing CVD.", 
    "64": "Cigarette smoking is known to promote atherosclerosis, possibly through enhanced oxidative stress. The aim of the present study was to elucidate the possible involvement of peroxynitrite in oxidative modification of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) induced by aqueous extract of cigarette smoke (CSE) and the preventive effect of fluvastain, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor with antioxidative activity, in vitro and in vivo. Modification of LDL was monitored by LDL subfraction analysis using anion-exchange HPLC, TBARS formation and 3-nitrotyrosine production. Incubation of LDL with CSE caused a marked increase in oxidative modification of LDL and nitration of tyrosine residues in the apolipoprotein B. These modifications were prevented by treatment with fluvastatin as well as Vitamin E in a concentration-related manner. Fluvastatin was equal to or more effective than Vitamin E for preventing protein nitration, but weaker for preventing oxidative modification. When CSE was injected daily into the ear vein of Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits for 5 months, both oxidative modification and nitration of the plasma LDL noticeably occurred. These changes induced by CSE could be effectively prevented by the simultaneous oral administration of fluvastatin (10 and 30 mg/kg) or Vitamin E (150 mg/kg). Fluvastatin prevented the LDL nitration more effectively than Vitamin E. These results suggest that peroxynitrite in CSE is involved in oxidative modification of LDL and that fluvastatin can efficiently prevent LDL modification by scavenging peroxynitrite. Fluvastatin may be potentially beneficial to hypercholesterolemic patients with oxidative stress such as smoking.", 
    "65": "Statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase and thus block cholesterol and isoprenoid biosynthesis. Since statins also have anti-inflammatory effects, we investigated the effect of fluvastatin on monocyte Fcgamma receptor function. Fluvastatin (0.5-20 microM) inhibited Fcgamma receptor signal transduction at the level of tyrosine kinase activation, in a time and dose dependent manner. Initiation of tyrosine phosphorylation is not thought to involve prenylated proteins; thus, we hypothesised that fluvastatin might disrupt cholesterol and sphingolipid membrane rafts to impair signalling. Consistent with this hypothesis, fluvastatin decreased (and mevalonate rescued) signalling molecules within membrane rafts in parallel with effects on tyrosine phosphorylation events. Raft integrity was unaffected by prenyl transferase inhibitors. In addition, Fcgamma receptor mediated immune complex trafficking, activation of MAP kinases (ERK and p38), and downstream inflammatory mediator release (MMP-1 and IL-6) were blocked by fluvastatin. Thus, HMG-CoA reductase inhibition alters immune receptor signalling by disrupting membrane rafts essential for the initiation of signal transduction. Inhibition of Fcgamma receptor function may limit development and progression of atherosclerosis by decreasing monocyte/macrophage inflammatory mediator release. Since many receptors utilise cholesterol rich rafts this mechanism may have broader significance given the pleiotropic effects of statins.", 
    "66": "Lower blood cholesterol concentrations have consistently been found to be strongly associated with lower risks of coronary disease but not with lower risks of stroke. Despite this observation, previous randomised trials had indicated that cholesterol-lowering statin therapy reduces the risk of stroke, but large-scale prospective confirmation has been needed.", 
    "67": "3280 adults with cerebrovascular disease, and an additional 17256 with other occlusive arterial disease or diabetes, were randomly allocated 40 mg simvastatin daily or matching placebo. Subgroup analyses were prespecified of first \"major vascular event\" (ie, non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death, stroke of any type, or any revascularisation procedure) in prior disease subcategories. Subsidiary outcomes included any stroke, and stroke sub-type. Comparisons are of all simvastatin-allocated versus all placebo-allocated participants (ie, \"intention-to-treat\"), which yielded an average difference in LDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L (39 mg/dL) during the 5-year treatment period.", 
    "68": "Overall, there was a highly significant 25% (95% CI 15-34) proportional reduction in the first event rate for stroke (444 [4.3%] simvastatin vs 585 [5.7%] placebo; p<0.0001), reflecting a definite 28% (19-37) reduction in presumed ischaemic strokes (p<0.0001) and no apparent difference in strokes attributed to haemorrhage (51 [0.5%] vs 53 [0.5%]; rate ratio 0.95 [0.65-1.40]; p=0.8). In addition, simvastatin reduced the numbers having transient cerebral ischaemic attacks alone (2.0% vs 2.4%; p=0.02) or requiring carotid endarterectomy or angioplasty (0.4% vs 0.8%; p=0.0003). The reduction in stroke was not significant during the first year, but was already significant (p=0.0004) by the end of the second year. Among patients with pre-existing cerebrovascular disease there was no apparent reduction in the stroke rate, but there was a highly significant 20% (8-29) reduction in the rate of any major vascular event (406 [24.7%] vs 488 [29.8%]; p=0.001). The proportional reductions in stroke were about one-quarter in each of the other subcategories of participant studied, including: those with coronary disease or diabetes; those aged under or over 70 years at entry; and those presenting with different levels of blood pressure or lipids (even when the pretreatment LDL cholesterol was below 3.0 mmol/L [116 mg/dL]).", 
    "69": "Much larger numbers of people in the present study suffered a stroke than in any previous cholesterol-lowering trial. The results demonstrate that statin therapy rapidly reduces the incidence not only of coronary events but also of ischaemic strokes, with no apparent effect on cerebral haemorrhage, even among individuals who do not have high cholesterol concentrations. Allocation to 40 mg simvastatin daily reduced the rate of ischaemic strokes by about one-quarter and so, after making allowance for non-compliance in the trial, actual use of this regimen would probably reduce the stroke rate by about a third. HPS also provides definitive evidence that statin therapy is beneficial for people with pre-existing cerebrovascular disease, even if they do not already have manifest coronary disease.",

In the diabetic group the FMD response was impaired when compared with controls with a median increase only of 4.4 (range 3.7-5.8)% (p<0.01). Following Pravastatin, 40 mg per day for one month in the diabetic group, there was a significant diameter change in response to reactive hyperaemia with a median of 8.4 (range 6.9-12.6)% (p<0.01).",

The rabbits were randomized into a continued HC diet, a normal chow (NC) diet, NC plus simvastatin, NC plus PPAR-gamma agonist, and NC plus simvastatin plus PPAR-gamma agonist. All rabbits underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at randomization and after six months of treatment and were then sacrificed for histopathologic study.", 
    "77": "All groups had a similar vessel wall area by MRI (8.45 +/- 0.65 mm(2), p = NS between groups) at randomization. Significant progression was seen in the HC diet group (15 +/- 4%, p < 0.01). In the NC and NC plus PPAR-gamma agonist groups, progression was abolished (-2.5 +/- 3% and -4.5 +/- 5%, respectively; p = NS). The NC plus simvastatin and NC plus simvastatin plus PPAR-gamma agonist groups had significant plaque regression (-12 +/- 4% [p < 0.05] and -22 +/- 4% [p < 0.01], respectively). Regression was independent of plasma lipid levels. All NC groups had similar lipid profiles at the end of treatment. Histopathologic analysis of the NC groups showed a decreased macrophage content and matrix metalloproteinase activity and an increased smooth muscle cell/collagen content of lesions.", 
    "78": "Our data indicate that normalization of plasma lipid levels abolishes progression of atherosclerosis. Simvastatin elicits regression of atherosclerotic lesions, and the combination simvastatin plus PPAR-gamma agonist has additive regression effects on plaque. This is paralleled by structural alterations in plaque composition, which may increase plaque stability. These observations support the beneficial effects of statins on atherosclerosis and show additional anti-atherogenic benefits of combining a PPAR-gamma agonist with simvastatin.",

Our aim was to determine the efficacy and safety of 10 mg atorvastatin in the control of dyslipidaemia in these patients. We carried out a prospective, open, 6 month study of 10 patients with primary or secondary nephrotic syndrome (proteinuria >3.5 g/day, hypoalbuminaemia, oedema and hyperlipidaemia). The changes in lipids and plasma lipoproteins were measured, as well as the safety profile (transaminases, creatine phosphokinase, fibrinogen and antithrombin III activity) and parameters of renal function. The addition of 10 mg atorvastatin daily for 6 months resulted in a 41% reduction in low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and 31% in triglycerides (both P < 0.05), and a 15% increase in high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (NS). The drug was well tolerated and there was no change in the safety profile or deterioration in renal function. In fact, the levels of proteinuria fell in all but one patient (6.2 +/- 2.6 vs 4.8 +/- 2.5 g/24 h; P < 0.05). Atorvastatin, at the above dose, and for the time used proved to be a safe drug that effectively reduced dyslipidaemia in patients with nephrotic syndrome.",

The differences in the proportion of patients identified for aspirin and statin under JBS and National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines by these two methods were determined. The proportion of additional patients identified for statin in the Scarborough population as a consequence of CHD risk threshold reduction from 30 to 15% (as recommended by NICE) was also determined.",

Both methods identified approximately 65% of patients to be eligible for aspirin and statin if NICE recommendations were followed. At a risk threshold of 30%, the UKPDS risk engine identified more patients for statin. Reducing the CHD risk threshold from 30 to 15% for statin initiation will identify an additional 0.5% of the total population for this treatment.",

    "85": "We have previously shown that the low molecular weight (LMW) forms (trunk 1 and trunk 2) of cyclin E are biochemically hyperactive and induce G1/S progression in normal epithelial cells. Here we investigate the biologic consequences of LMW cyclin E expression in ovarian cancer cells. Using a panel of ovarian carcinoma tumors we find that cyclin E overexpression is invariably due to the presence of LMW forms and that expression of these forms appears to correlate with more advanced grade and stage of disease. Despite similar expression of p21 and p27, cyclin E overexpressing tumors have higher kinase function. Using an isogenic ovarian cancer model, we find that clones that overexpress the trunk 1 (T1) protein have a 10-fold increase in cyclin E kinase function, a 20% increase in S-phase fraction, a 10-15% decrease in doubling time and a 20% increase in colony formation compared to parental cells that express only the FL cyclin E protein. T1 clones were resistant to G1 arrest but more sensitive to cisplatin. Therefore, in ovarian tumors, the presence of LMW cyclin E forms confers altered biologic properties. Our data provides a potential mechanism for the poor prognosis of patients with LMW cyclin E expressing tumors.",

The primary end point was a composite of death from any cause, myocardial infarction, documented unstable angina requiring rehospitalization, revascularization (performed at least 30 days after randomization), and stroke. The study was designed to establish the noninferiority of pravastatin as compared with atorvastatin with respect to the time to an end-point event. Follow-up lasted 18 to 36 months (mean, 24).", 
    "88": "The median LDL cholesterol level achieved during treatment was 95 mg per deciliter (2.46 mmol per liter) in the standard-dose pravastatin group and 62 mg per deciliter (1.60 mmol per liter) in the high-dose atorvastatin group (P<0.001). Kaplan-Meier estimates of the rates of the primary end point at two years were 26.3 percent in the pravastatin group and 22.4 percent in the atorvastatin group, reflecting a 16 percent reduction in the hazard ratio in favor of atorvastatin (P=0.005; 95 percent confidence interval, 5 to 26 percent). The study did not meet the prespecified criterion for equivalence but did identify the superiority of the more intensive regimen.", 
    "89": "Among patients who have recently had an acute coronary syndrome, an intensive lipid-lowering statin regimen provides greater protection against death or major cardiovascular events than does a standard regimen. These findings indicate that such patients benefit from early and continued lowering of LDL cholesterol to levels substantially below current target levels.", 
    "90": "Hyperlipidaemia is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The drugs of choice for the treatment of hyperlipidaemia are either fibrates, in the case of hypertriglyceridaemia, or statins, in the case of hypercholesterolaemia. Recently, it has been shown that some of the most prescribed fibrates cause hyperhomocysteinemia, which itself has been recognised as a cardiovascular risk factor. In particular, fenofibrate and bezafibrate lead to a 20 - 40% elevation of plasma levels of the atherogenic amino acid homocysteine, thereby possibly counteracting the desired cardiovascular protection. The most likely mechanism for this increase is an alteration of creatine-creatinine metabolism and changes in methyl transfer. Gemfibrozil does not increase homocysteine. Statins have no effect on the plasma homocysteine concentration. The increase of plasma homocysteine after fenofibrate can be lowered by the concurrent administration of folic acid and vitamins B(12) and B(6). Thus, patients with hypertriglyceridaemia can either be concurrently treated with fenofibrate and vitamins or with gemfibrozil.", 
    "91": "Statins are an efficacious and well-tolerated class of lipid-altering agents that have been shown to reduce the risk of initial and recurrent cardiovascular events. However, cerivastatin was withdrawn from the world market because of its potential for severe myotoxic effects. Since the benefits of statin treatment outweigh the small risk of adverse events, statins remain the first-line therapy for lipid lowering and preventing atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. The risk of myopathy may be minimized with the appropriate choice of agent and by identifying patients at risk of myotoxic effects. Elderly or female patients, or those with concomitant medications or impaired metabolic processes, may be at increased risk and should be monitored closely. The risk of myopathy may also be inferred from the pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic properties of the statin used. Since myotoxic events are more frequent at higher doses, statins that are effective in reducing cholesterol levels and helping patients to reach target levels at start doses may be useful. The lipophilicity of a statin and its potential for drug-drug interactions may also help to determine the likelihood of muscular effects. Drug-drug interactions may be avoided by selecting a statin that does not share the same metabolic pathway.", 
    "92": "This paper presents the consensus reached by a panel of experts on the role of fibrates in reducing coronary heart disease (CHD). The emphasis is on the application of these agents in clinical practice. Evidence that low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) play a major role in the development of CHD, plus the roles of lifestyle modification and statin treatment in raising HDL-C, are briefly reviewed. Current thinking on single agent and combination therapies with fibrates is discussed with particular relevance to patients with low baseline HDL-C- whether receiving statins or not - and those with features of the metabolic syndrome. Recommendations on the practical use of fibrates are made in the light of recently published international guidelines on HDL-C management and the relevant evidence base.", 
    "93": "Lowering cholesterol levels is a primary approach for reducing the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD), yet patients rarely achieve the lipid targets recommended by international guidelines. Although high rates of compliance and achievement of lipid targets have been reported in clinical trials, this situation is infrequently reproduced in regular practice. This sub-optimal lipid management has clinical consequences as patients will not gain the full benefit of treatment. Poor compliance with therapeutic lifestyle changes and/or lipid-lowering agents is thought to contribute to the failure of patients in clinical practice to achieve lipid targets, and therefore this problem needs to be addressed. Several approaches may be used to improve compliance, including the prescription of efficacious, well-tolerated agents, educating patients about the necessity of therapy, and regular follow-up to monitor compliance and achievement of goals. However, educating patients to promote compliant behaviour can be time-consuming and therefore the support of other health-care workers, where available, can prove invaluable. Compliance initiatives using educational materials, access to helplines and regular telephone contact with a qualified health-care worker may also improve adherence with therapy. Further studies into the causes of poor compliance and methods of improving adherence with lipid-lowering agents are required.", 
    "94": "It is well established that age-related bone loss occurs in men and male SD rats. This study was designed to determine whether cerivastatin will prevent age-related bone loss in male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) was used as a positive control. Nine-month-old male SD rats were divided into six groups. Group 1: baseline controls; group 2: age-matched controls; group 3: low-dose cerivastatin (0.2 mg/kg b wt/day); group 4: medium-dose cerivastatin (0.4 mg/kg b wt/day); group 5: high-dose cerivastatin (0.8 mg/kg b wt/day); group 6: PTH (80 microg/kg b wt, 5 days/week). The animals were treated for 6 months. Cancellous and cortical bones were analyzed using peripheral quantitative computerized tomography (pQCT) densitometry at the proximal tibial metaphysis (PTM), tibial diaphysis, tibio-fibula junction, femoral diaphysis and the neck of the femur. In the PTM, pQCT analyses were done 2 mm distal from the growth plate. The cancellous bone mineral content (Cn. BMC) decreased by 26% (P<0.05), 25% (P<0.05) and 28% (P<0.05) in the low, medium and high doses of cerivastatin groups, respectively, when compared to the age-matched controls. PTH group did not change significantly from the baseline controls but prevented the decrease in Cn. BMC seen in the age-matched controls by 45% (P<0.0001). Cancellous bone mineral density (Cn. BMD) decreased by 20% (P<0.05), 23% (P<0.05) and 27% (P<0.05) in the low, medium and high doses of cerivastatin groups, respectively, when compared to the age-matched controls. Cn. BMD did not change significantly in the PTH-treated group when compared to the baseline controls but prevented the decrease seen in age-matched controls by 47% (P<0.0001). In the neck of the femur, femoral diaphysis, tibial diaphysis and the tibio-fibula junction, cerivastatin did not prevent age-related bone loss in male SD rats while PTH significantly prevented the age-related bone loss. We conclude that cerivastatin, in any of the doses tested, does not prevent age-related bone loss, in male SD rats, at the different bone sites studied; while PTH not only prevented age-related bone loss but also increased bone mass above the baseline controls in all the bone sites studied except the PTM.", 
    "95": "The rate of decline of renal function (RDRF) in the pre-end stage renal disease setting (pre-ESRD) is highly variable. Several factors have been involved as potential modifiers of renal failure progression. This retrospective study attempts to establish which were the main determinants of the RDRF in pre-ESRD patients followed in the predialysis consult. The study group consisted of 230 patients with pre-ESRD not yet on dialysis who were referred to the predialysis consult from January 1998 to July 2002. The mean follow-up time per patient was 356 days. RDRF was assessed as delta of the average of creatinine and urea clearances (CrCl-UCl). Data obtained at time of referral to the predialysis consult were analyzed as potential predictors of the subsequent RDRF. These independent variables included: demographics, comorbid conditions, main hematological and biochemical data, antihypertensive and statin treatment, mean blood pressure, and CrCl-UCl at time of referral. The predictors of delta CrCl-UCl were determined by multiple linear regression analysis. The determinants of the survival without dialysis were established by the Cox regression hazard model, adjusted to renal function at time of referral. Mean CrCl-UCl at time of referral was 10.98 +/- 2.58 ml/min/1.73 m2, and mean delta CrCl-UCl was -0.37 +/- 0.46 ml/min/1.73 m2/month. Patients with diabetic nephropathy and chronic glomerulonephritis had the fastest RDRF, while patients with ischemic nephropathy and chronic interstitial nephritis had the slowest RDRF. Seventy-five patients (46%) required EPO therapy. The best determinants of delta CrCl-UCl were: the 24-hour proteinuria (p < 0.0001), and the hematocrit at time of referral (p = 0.0024). The best determinants of the survival rate without dialysis during the study period were: the proteinuria (in g/24 hours) (R 1, 16; p < 0.0001), the hematocrit at time of referral (OR: 0.88; p < 0.0001), the treatment with EPO (OR: 0.59; p = 0.02), and the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (OR: 1.59; p = 0.01). In conclusion, apart from the rate of proteinuria, which could represent the best marker of the RDRF in chronic renal diseases, the development of anemia was associated with faster decline in renal function.", 
    "96": "Fluvastatin reduces atherogenic dense low-density lipoprotein (dLDL) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). dLDLs are associated with platelet-activating factor acetyl hydrolase (PAF-AH), an enzyme involved in inflammation and related to coronary artery disease (CAD). The association of preexisting CAD and PAF-AH and the effect of fluvastatin on enzyme activity is investigated in a placebo-controlled trial in patients with T2DM. A multicenter, double-blind, randomized comparison of fluvastatin XL (80 mg) (n = 42) and placebo (n = 47), each given once-daily for 8 wk, in 89 patients with T2DM, was conducted. At baseline and on treatment, lipoproteins, including lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] and LDL subfractions, and the activity of PAF-AH were measured. Increasing PAF-AH activity was significantly associated with a positive history of CAD (+0.7% per IU/liter PAH-AH; P = 0.010), the odds ratio estimate adjusted for age, gender, and body mass index of the highest quartile being 10.6 (P = 0.036). At baseline and at study end, PAF-AH activity was associated with the apolipoprotein B (apoB) content in dLDL (LDL-5 and LDL-6) (r = 0.447; P < 0.001 and r = 0.651; P < 0.001, respectively) and with non-HDL cholesterol at baseline (r = 0.485; P < 0.001). However, after additional adjustment for apoB in dLDL and non-HDL cholesterol at baseline, the odds ratio increment for CAD across PAF-AH quartiles was 2.09 (95% confidence interval, 1.02-4.29; P = 0.043). Fluvastatin treatment decreased the activity of PAF-AH by 22.8% compared with an increase of 0.4% in the placebo group (P < 0.001). This effect was independent of changes of Lp(a) concentrations. In patients with T2DM, PAF-AH activity is associated with a positive history of CAD. Fluvastatin not only decreases atherogenic dLDL but also PAF-AH activity, emphasizing the significance of fluvastatin treatment in T2DM. The antiatherogenic potential of fluvastatin in T2DM may thus be greater than expected from its effects on LDL-C and triglycerides alone.",

His warfarin dosage was reduced and his INR stabilized. The fluvastatin was switched back to atorvastatin, and the warfarin dosage was increased to maintain the patient's goal INR. The literature supports a drug interaction between warfarin and fluvastatin due to the strong affinity of fluvastatin for the cytochrome P450 enzyme 2D6. This interaction has not been seen with atorvastatin. Lovastatin also reportedly has caused increases in INR when coadministered with warfarin. It is unclear whether simvastatin interacts with warfarin, but it may increase INRs slightly or increase serum simvastatin levels. One case report describes an interaction between simvastatin and the anticoagulant acenocoumarol, which resulted in an elevated INR. Pravastatin does not appear to interact with warfarin but has caused an increased INR when combined with the anticoagulant fluindione. Thus, until more definitive data are available, clinicians should monitor the INR closely after starting statin therapy in any patient receiving anticoagulation therapy.",

    "124": "Hypertension and hyperlipidaemia are major risk factors for the development of atherosclerosis. Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) have been used for decades and have established antihypertensive effects. Statins have been extensively used because of their potent lipid lowering properties. Amongst other factors, inflammation and oxidation are involved in enhanced progression of atherosclerosis and new lesion development. Therefore, research has been initiated focusing on the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of CCBs and statins, beyond their primary effect, in order to evaluate the possible additive effects of combined treatment of CCBs with statins as antiatherosclerotic therapy. Clinical studies (e.g., the International Nifedipine Trial on Antiatherosclerotic Therapy [INTACT]) have demonstrated that the antiatherosclerotic action of CCBs is limited to the attenuation of the first stage of atherosclerogenesis (fatty streak formation or new lesion growth). The lesions that pre-existed at the start of CCB therapy did not demonstrate progression or regression on angiography. However, because the mechanisms of action of lipid-lowering drugs and CCBs, and their role in preventing the progression of atherosclerosis differ, it is conceivable to conclude that these two classes may have an additive or synergic effect, not only on new lesion formation but also on inhibiting the progression of established coronary atherosclerosis. Indeed, this combined effect of lipid-lowering therapy and CCBs on human coronary atherosclerosis has been reported in the Regression Growth Evaluation Statin Study (REGRESS) trial. This beneficial effect of combining CCBs with statins has now been replicated in transgenic atherosclerotic mice, where the combination of amlodipine and atorvastatin produced an additional 60% reduction of atherosclerosis compared with that observed with the statin alone. Serum markers of atherosclerosis and vascular integrity also improved most in the combination group. Synergistic effects of the combination of atorvastatin and amlodipine on acute nitric oxide release/endothelial function, and additive effects of the combination of amlodipine and atorvastatin in the improvement of arterial compliance in hypertensive hyperlipidaemic patients has been demonstrated. Collectively, these studies support the clinical antiatherosclerotic advantages of combination of CCBs and statins and in particular, of atorvastatin with amlodipine beyond their established antihyperlipidaemic and antihypertensive modes of action.",

The purposes of this study were to assess whether anti-oxidized LDL antibody titers are related to other inflammatory markers of possible interest in atherosclerotic development, such as soluble cell adhesion molecules, interleukin-6, and C-reactive protein (CRP), and to determine the prognostic value of anti-oxidized LDL antibody as a predictor of cardiac events in patients with unstable angina pectoris. Sixty patients (35 men and 25 women; mean age 60 years) with unstable angina were included in this study. The levels of CRP and of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) at 24 and 72 hours after admission were significantly higher than their baseline levels (p <0.05, respectively). After adjusting for age, gender, body mass index, and statin use, anti-oxidized LDL antibodies were positively correlated with CRP (r = 0.72, p <0.001) and ICAM-1 (r = 0.68, p <0.001). Elevated anti-oxidized LDL antibodies (mean >11.37 U/ml) and CRP levels (median >2.4 mg/L) on admission were correlated with a significantly lower 16-month, event-free survival rate (Kaplan-Meier event-free survival analysis, log-rank p <0.01 and p <0.05, respectively). Multivariate analysis by logistic regression revealed that elevated levels of anti-oxidized LDL antibody (mean >11.3 U/ml) on admission were an independent risk factor for an adverse cardiac event (odds ratio 2.2, 95% confidence interval 1.5 to 10.7, p = 0.001). This study demonstrates that anti-oxidized LDL antibody expression is associated with the expression of CRP and adhesion molecules, especially ICAM-1, and is a predictor of cardiac events in patients with unstable angina pectoris. The observed elevated levels of anti-oxidized LDL antibody suggest plaque instability and may be useful for identifying patients at higher risk of a cardiac event.",

Elevated levels of these molecules have been reported in diabetic patients. Postprandial hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycemia are considered risk factors for cardiovascular disease, and evidence suggests that postprandial hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycemia may induce an increase in circulating adhesion molecules. However, the distinct role of these two factors is a matter of debate. Thirty type 2 diabetic patients and 20 normal subjects ate three different meals: a high-fat meal, 75 g of glucose alone, and a high-fat meal plus glucose. Glycemia, triglyceridemia, plasma nitrotyrosine, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin were assayed during the tests. Subsequently, diabetic subjects took simvastatin 40 mg/day or placebo for 12 weeks. The three tests were performed again at baseline, between 3 and 6 days after starting the study, and at the end of each study. High-fat load and glucose alone produced an increase of nitrotyrosine, ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin plasma levels in normal and diabetic subjects. These effects were more pronounced when high fat and glucose were combined. Short-term simvastatin treatment had no effect on lipid parameters, but reduced the effect on adhesion molecules and nitrotyrosine, which was observed during every different test. Long-term simvastatin treatment was accompanied by a lower increase in postprandial triglycerides, which was followed by smaller variations in ICAM-1, VCAM-1, E-selectin, and nitrotyrosine during the tests. This study shows an independent and cumulative effect of postprandial hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycemia on ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and E-selectin plasma levels, suggesting oxidative stress as a common mediator of such effects. Simvastatin shows a beneficial effect on oxidative stress and the plasma levels of adhesion molecules, which may be ascribed to a direct effect in addition to the lipid-lowering action of the drug.", 
    "146": "E-selectin mediated tumor cell adhesion plays an important role in metastasis. Here we show that ionizing radiation (IR) induces E-selectin gene and protein expression in human endothelial cells at therapeutically relevant dose level. E-selectin expression is accompanied by an increase in the adhesion of human colon carcinoma cells to primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin impairs IR-stimulated E-selectin expression as analyzed at the level of the protein, mRNA and promoter. Inactivation of Rho GTPases either by use of Clostridium difficile toxin A or by co-expression of dominant-negative Rho blocked IR-induced E-selectin gene induction, indicating Rho GTPases to be essential. Radiation-induced expression of E-selectin was also blocked by all-trans retinoic acid (at-RA), whereas 9-cis retinoic acid was ineffective. Abrogation of IR-stimulated E-selectin expression by lovastatin and at-RA reduced tumor cell adhesion in a dose-dependent manner. Combined treatment with lovastatin and at-RA exerted additive inhibitory effects on radiation-induced E-selectin expression and tumor cell adhesion. Therefore, application of statins and at-RA might have clinical impact in protecting against E-selectin-promoted metastasis, which might arise as an unwanted side effect from radiation treatment.",

Since GGPP is synthesized from isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) by GGPP synthase, we analyzed the regulatory roles of GGPP synthase in the proliferation of FRTL-5 cells stimulated by thyrotropin and insulin in the presence of 5% calf serum (TSH+Ins). We found that: (1) GGPP synthase was activated at G1/S transition with increasing mRNA accumulation followed by protein expression, (2) pravastatin, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, did not suppress the increasing activity of GGPP synthase with its protein expression although it inhibits proliferation in growth-stimulated FRTL-5 cells, (3) forskolin stimulated proliferation with activation of GGPP synthase in FRTL-5 cells, and (4) LY294002, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, inhibited proliferation with the decreasing activity of GGPP synthase in growth-stimulated FRTL-5 cells. These data indicated that growth stimulation by TSH+Ins increased the activity of GGPP synthase with its increasing protein expression from G1/S transition, in which both cAMP-PKA and PI3-kinase pathways are involved in the proliferation of FRTL-5 cells.", 
    "150": "Adverse atrial and ventricular myocardial remodeling is characterized by fibrosis, myocyte death or hypertrophy and fibroblast proliferation. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are widely prescribed cholesterol-lowering drugs that also appear to have beneficial effects on myocardial remodeling. Although statins are known to reduce myocyte hypertrophy, their effect on cardiac fibroblast proliferation is unknown. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of simvastatin on human atrial myofibroblast proliferation.", 
    "151": "Cardiac myofibroblasts were cultured from biopsies of human right atrial appendage. Proliferation was quantified by cell counting and cell cycle progression determined by immunoblotting for Cyclin A. The expression, activation and intracellular localization of RhoA were investigated using immunoblotting and immunocytochemistry.", 
    "152": "Simvastatin (0.1-1.0 micromol/l) inhibited serum-induced myofibroblast proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner at a point upstream of Cyclin A expression. These effects were reversed by mevalonate or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), but not squalene or farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), indicating a mechanism involving inhibition of Rho-family GTPases and independent of cholesterol synthesis. The effects of simvastatin were mimicked by inhibiting Rho geranylgeranylation or Rho-kinase activation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that simvastatin inhibited RhoA function by preventing its association with the plasma membrane and hence, its interaction with downstream effectors required for cell proliferation.", 
    "153": "Simvastatin reduced proliferation of cultured human atrial myofibroblasts independently of cholesterol synthesis via a mechanism involving inhibition of RhoA geranylgeranylation. Statins may therefore have an important role in preventing adverse myocardial remodeling associated with cardiac myofibroblast proliferation.", 
    "154": "The TaqIB polymorphism in the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) gene is associated with HDL-C, progression of coronary artery disease (CAD) and response to pravastatin treatment in men with angiographically proven CAD (REGRESS). We hypothesized that differences in CETP concentration could explain these associations and now investigated whether CETP concentration is an independent determinant of these parameters.", 
    "155": "Plasma CETP concentrations at baseline and after 2 years' treatment with pravastatin or placebo were measured (n=674), and correlations with lipid and angiographic parameters (mean segment- and obstruction-diameter; MSD and MOD), and TaqIB genotype were studied.", 
    "156": "After segregation into three groups (baseline CETP<1.58, 1.58-2.21, >2.21 mg L(-1)), subjects with the highest CETP had significantly higher baseline total cholesterol, LDL-C and triglycerides (P<0.01), while HDL-C, MSD and MOD were not different among these groups. After 2 years of placebo, the MSD decreased threefold (P<0.001) and the MOD decreased 2.4-fold (P=0.042) more in the highest compared with the lowest CETP quartile. Pravastatin treatment reduced total cholesterol LDL-C and triglycerides significantly more in the highest CETP quartile. Moreover, only in the highest CETP quartile, pravastatin significantly reduced the MSD- (P=0.003) and MOD-decrease (P=0.014) compared with placebo, and, notably, this was independent of baseline lipids and differential lipid changes in these quartiles. Strikingly, baseline associations and treatment responses according to baseline CETP were independent of TaqIB genotype.", 
    "157": "High CETP concentration is associated with faster progression of coronary atherosclerosis in men with proven CAD. Second, pravastatin yielded the highest improvement of lipid and angiographic parameters in patients with high baseline CETP independent of baseline lipids, lipid changes and TaqIB genotype, indicating that the plasma CETP level itself is an important determinant of the response to statins.", 
    "158": "To assess if there are any differences in statin prescribing across Australia by socioeconomic status or sex and to relate prescribing rates to coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality rates.", 
    "159": "Cross-sectional study using data on statin prescribing by age, sex and patient postcode for the period May to December 2002.", 
    "160": "The Australian population, stratified by sex and quintile of Index of Relative Socio-Economic Disadvantage (IRSD).", 
    "161": "Age-standardised rates of statin scripts per 1000 population per month for each sex and IRSD quintile.", 
    "162": "9.1 million prescriptions for statins were supplied between May and December 2002, for a total cost of 570 million dollars. The age-standardised rates for statin prescribing in women varied from 56.9 (95% CI, 56.6-57.2) scripts per 1000 population per month in the most disadvantaged socioeconomic quintile through 53.4 (95% CI, 53.0-53.7), 50.3 (95% CI, 50.0-50.6), 48.4 (95% CI, 48.1-48.7) to 46.3 (95% CI, 46.0-46.6) in the least disadvantaged quintile. For men the figures were 52.6 (95% CI, 52.3-52.9), 50.9 (95% CI, 50.6-51.2), 48.8 (95% CI, 48.6-49.1), 47.7 (95% CI, 47.4-47.9), and 51.9 (95% CI, 51.6-52.2). There was a significant linear association between statin prescribing and CHD mortality by quintile of socioeconomic disadvantage in women (weighted least squares slope, 0.380; 95% CI, 0.366 to 0.395; P < 0.0001), but not in men (slope, -0.002; 95% CI, -0.010 to 0.006; P = 0.65).", 
    "163": "Our results suggest that in men there is either overprescribing of statins in the highest socioeconomic quintile or underprescribing in the lowest. Furthermore, contrary to expectation, women - relative to men - are prescribed statins at higher rates at lower levels of risk (using CHD deaths as a proxy measure of risk).", 
    "164": "Dyslipidaemia is common in patients with Type 2 diabetes and is held to be responsible for considerable CVD-related morbidity and mortality. Patients with Type 2 diabetes are at high risk from complications associated with atherosclerosis and should therefore receive preventive interventions. At the level of the adipocyte, impaired insulin action leads to increased rates of intracellular hydrolysis of triglycerides with the release of NEFA. The rise in NEFA provides substrate for the liver that, in the presence of impaired insulin action and relative insulin deficiency, is associated with complex alterations in plasma lipids: * Plasma VLDL levels are raised. (i). Increased VLDL levels are associated with post-prandial hyperlipidaemia that is compounded by impaired LPL activity. The latter may be independently associated with CAD. (ii). Remnant particles can deliver more cholesterol to macrophages than LDL-C particles. Thrombogenic alterations in the coagulation system also ensue from hypertriglyceridaemia. * Plasma HDL-C levels are reduced. (i). The reduction in cardioprotective HDL-C means a reduction of cholesterol efflux from the tissues--the first step in reverse cholesterol transport to the liver from peripheral tissues. (ii). The antioxidant and antiatherogenic activities of HDL-C are reduced when circulating levels are low. * LDL-C particles become small and dense. Small, dense LDL-C particles are held to be more atherogenic than their larger, buoyant counterparts because they (a) are more liable to oxidation and (b) may more readily adhere to and subsequently invade the arterial wall. The atherogenicity of LDL-C may also be enhanced by nonenzymatic glycation. Metabolic and lipid abnormalities can often be improved with lifestyle changes, including dietary modification, weight loss, smoking cessation and increased exercise. Although attainment of better glycaemic control may improve diabetic dyslipidaemia, pharmacological intervention is usually required. Several large-scale clinical trials, including 4S and more recently HPS, have clearly demonstrated the benefits of statins in reducing cardiovascular events. By virtue of their high absolute risk of CVD, many patients with Type 2 diabetes may achieve a greater risk reduction than their non-diabetic counterparts. For example, in 4S there was a 43% reduction in total mortality risk among patients with diabetes compared with 29% for non-diabetics and a reduced risk of MI by 55% vs. 32% for diabetic and non-diabetics, respectively. In the diabetic subgroup in HPS, there were reductions of approximately 25-30% in the risk of first major vascular events. More recently, the lipid-lowering arm of the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT) was halted early because of a significant reduction in cardiovascular events compared with placebo. Surprisingly an analysis of subgroups failed to show significance among the diabetic population, although the sample size, shortened follow-up period and higher drop-in statin use among diabetics on placebo may have affected results. The Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS), involving 2800 patients with Type 2 diabetes, was halted 2 years early in June 2003 because patients allocated atorvastatin had significant reductions in MI, stroke and surgical procedures compared with those receiving placebo. The UKPDS demonstrated that the appearance and progression of certain microvascular complications of Type 2 diabetes could be reduced by treatment directed at hyperglycaemia and hypertension. In addition, correction of dyslipidaemia in patients with diabetes is important in reducing the high toll from macrovascular disease. The subjects in the HPS had similar lipid profiles to the participants in UKPDS, suggesting that additional benefit would accrue from a therapeutic assault on the main cardiovascular risk factors simultaneously. We now have firm evidence that appropriate use of statins in patients with Type 2 diabetes can significantly reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality."
