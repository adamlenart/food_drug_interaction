While the first effect translates into plasma cholesterol reductions, the second is related to nonlipid-lowering (pleiotropic) properties. Purpose of this review is to assess the correlation between differences in statin structures and clinical effects. While the cardiovascular benefits of statin chronic therapy are achieved by lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and should be considered a class effect, the acute ones may reflect structure differences and pleiotropic properties of these drugs.", 
    "1": "Clinical studies conducted in acute coronary syndrome patients suggest that some benefits achieved by early statin treatment could be related to their pleiotropic properties. Indeed, ex-vivo studies showed the ability of sera from hypercholesterolemic patients treated with a single dose of atorvastatin (but not of simvastatin), to inhibit smooth muscle cell proliferation, independently of LDL-C lowering.",

    "6": "Statin treatment and exercise training can reduce markers of inflammation when administered separately. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of rosuvastatin treatment and the addition of exercise training on circulating markers of inflammation including C-reactive protein (CRP), monocyte toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) expression, and CD14+CD16+ monocyte population size. Thirty-three hypercholesterolemic and physically inactive subjects were randomly assigned to rosuvastatin (R) or rosuvastatin/exercise (RE) groups. A third group of physically active hypercholesterolemic subjects served as a control (AC). The R and RE groups received rosuvastatin treatment (10 mg/d) for 20 weeks. From week 10 to week 20, the RE group also participated in an exercise training program (3d/wk). Measurements were made at baseline (Pre), week 10 (Mid), and week 20 (Post), and included TLR4 expression on CD14+ monocytes and CD14+CD16+ monocyte population size as determined by 3-color flow cytometry. Serum CRP was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. TLR4 expression on CD14+ monocytes was higher in the R group at week 20. When treatment groups (R and RE) were combined, serum CRP was lower across time. Furthermore, serum CRP and inflammatory monocyte population size were lower in the RE group compared with the R group at the Post time point. When all groups (R, RE, and AC) were combined, TLR4 expression was greater on inflammatory monocytes (CD14+CD16+) compared with classic monocytes (CD14+CD16\u207b) at all time points. In conclusion, rosuvastatin may influence monocyte inflammatory response by increasing TLR4 expression on circulating monocytes. The addition of exercise training to rosuvastatin treatment further lowered CRP and reduced the size of the inflammatory monocyte population, suggesting an additive anti-inflammatory effect of exercise.",

    "12": "There is interindividual variation in lipid-lowering response to statins. The objective of this study was to investigate whether common variation in genes involved in lipid and statin metabolism modify the effect of statins on serum total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentration in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients. We studied the association between 18 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in six genes (HMGCR, CETP, APOAI, ABCB1, CYP3A4, CYP7A1) in response to atorvastatin therapy (20\u2009mg/day) in 265 newly diagnosed CAD patients using multivariable adjusted general linear regression. Variant alleles of ABCB1 (-41A/G), HMGCR SNP29 G/T, rs5908A/G, rs12916C/T, and CYP7A1-204A/C polymorphisms were significantly associated with attenuated LDL-C reduction and variant alleles of CETP TaqI, -629C/A, and APOAI PstI polymorphisms were associated with higher increase in high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol. A three-loci interaction model consisting of CYP7A1rs892871AA/APOAIPstIP1P1/HMGCR rs12916CT was a better predictor for LDL-C lowering, when compared with single polymorphisms analysis on statin response. Variant genotypes of APOAI -2500C/T, CETP 405I/V, and ABCB1 3435C/T showed higher risk of myocardial infarction events (p\u2009<\u20090.05) in a 1-year follow-up of CAD patients. These results suggest that SNPs in lipid and statin pathway genes are associated with reduced LDL-C lowering by statins and identify individuals who may be resistant to maximal LDL-C lowering by statins.", 
    "13": "Previously, we and others documented that statins including-lovastatin (LOV) promote the differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs) and remyelination in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an multiple sclerosis (MS) model. Conversely, some recent studies demonstrated that statins negatively influence oligodendrocyte (OL) differentiation in vitro and remyelination in a cuprizone-CNS demyelinating model. Therefore, herein, we first investigated the cause of impaired differentiation of OLs by statins in vitro settings. Our observations indicated that the depletion of cholesterol was detrimental to LOV treated OPCs under cholesterol/serum-deprived culture conditions similar to that were used in conflicting studies. However, the depletion of geranylgeranyl-pp under normal cholesterol homeostasis conditions enhanced the phenotypic commitment and differentiation of LOV-treated OPCs ascribed to inhibition of RhoA-Rho kinase. Interestingly, this effect of LOV was associated with increased activation and expression of both PPAR-\u03b3 and PTEN in OPCs as confirmed by various pharmacological and molecular based approaches. Furthermore, PTEN was involved in an inhibition of OPCs proliferation via PI3K-Akt inhibition and induction of cell cycle arrest at G1 phase, but without affecting their cell survival. These effects of LOV on OPCs in vitro were absent in the CNS of normal rats chronically treated with LOV concentrations used in EAE indicating that PPAR-\u03b3 induction in normal brain may be tightly regulated-providing evidences that statins are therapeutically safe for humans. Collectively, these data provide initial evidence that statin-mediated activation of the PPAR-\u03b3-PTEN cascade participates in OL differentiation, thus suggesting new therapeutic-interventions for MS or related CNS-demyelinating diseases.",

Lovastatin is produced by an iterative type I polyketide synthase known as LovB and a partner enoyl reductase (LovC). There is evidence that a Diels-Alderase enzyme activity is utilized in its biosynthesis.

    "15": "A series of alpha-asarone-based analogues was designed by conducting docking experiments with published crystal structures of human HMG-CoA reductase. Indeed, synthesis and evaluation of this series showed a highly hypocholesterolemic in vivo activity in a murine model, as predicted by previous docking studies. In agreement with this model, the polar groups attached to the benzene ring could play a key role in the enzyme binding and probably also in its biological activity, mimicking the HMG-moiety of the natural substrate. The hypolipidemic action mechanism of these compounds was investigated by developing a simple, efficient, and novel model for determining HMG-CoA reductase inhibition. The partial purification of the enzyme from Schizosaccharomyces pombe allowed for testing of alpha-asarone- and fibrate-based analogues, resulting in positive and significant inhibitory activity.", 
    "16": "Ginger is known to possess hypolipidemic, antioxidant and hepatoprotective properties. Combination therapy often takes advantage of complementary effects of different agents. This study investigated the combined effect of ginger extract (GE) and atorvastatin on lipid profile and on atorvastatin-induced hepatic injury. Rats were randomized into: control; GE (400 mg/kg); atorvastatin (20 mg/kg) alone or with GE or vitamin E, and atorvastatin (80 mg/kg) alone or with GE or vitamin E. Administration of 80 mg/kg atorvastatin for 4 weeks had major hepatotoxic effect whereas the lower dose (20 mg/kg) seems to cause mild liver injury. Besides lowering serum total cholesterol and hepatic superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), atorvastatin significantly increased serum aminotransferases, hepatic malondialdehyde (MDA) and nitric oxide (NO). Concurrent administration of GE and atorvastatin had the opposite effect. Histopathological study revealed that GE reduced liver lesions induced by atorvastatin. The results indicate that the ability of ginger to lower serum cholesterol and to decrease aminotransferases, MDA and NO is clinically important, because its chronic administration will neither lead to side-effects nor to hepatic changes as occurs with high atorvastatin doses. Therefore, combination regimens containing GE and low dose of statins could be advantageous in treating hypercholesterolemic patients which are susceptible to liver function abnormalities.", 
    "17": "Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is a frequent complication of cardiac surgery that increases patient morbidity, length of stay, and hospital costs. A substantial body of evidence exists evaluating various pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic methods to decrease the occurrence of POAF in an effort to decrease its burden on the health care system. Evidence-based guidelines support the use of beta-blockers as standard prophylaxis of POAF in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Traditional prophylactic therapy for POAF targets the sympathetic nervous system, refractory period, and atrial conduction. However, associations between the development of POAF and the inflammatory process, oxidative stress, and atrial remodeling have prompted the investigation of novel therapies targeting these processes. To evaluate the role of pharmacologic strategies beyond beta-blockers in the prevention of POAF, we conducted a search of the PubMed database to identify studies published from 1950-February 2009. Emphasis was placed on how these therapies could be used in patients intolerant to beta-blockers or as additive therapy in high-risk patients. We found that sufficient evidence exists to recommend the use of amiodarone, sotalol, and possibly magnesium as monotherapy in patients unable to take beta-blockers or as add-on therapy for the prevention of POAF. Currently, available evidence does not support the use of propafenone, procainamide, digoxin, thiazolidinediones, triiodothyronine, or calcium channel blockers in the prevention of POAF. Preliminary evidence suggests that dofetilide, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, omega-3 fatty acids, ascorbic acid, N-acetylcysteine, and sodium nitroprusside may be effective in preventing POAF. Additional large-scale, adequately powered clinical studies are needed to determine the benefit of these agents before they can be considered for routine use.",

Complete follow-up data were obtained in 180 patients. RLP-C levels at 1 year of treatment were reduced more by bezafibrate than pravastatin (37% and 25% from baseline, respectively). During follow-up, bezafibrate-treated patients had 3 CV events, compared with 12 events in pravastatin-treated patients (P<0.01).

High-performance liquid chromatography analysis revealed that production of lovastatin was enhanced up to 1.8-fold upon exogenous addition of the oxylipin precursor linoleic acid to low cell density cultures of A. terreus. Real-time PCR analysis showed that supplementation of linoleic acid also resulted in an increase in transcriptional levels of lovastatin biosynthetic genes lovB and lovF, indicating a transcriptional control of fatty acids (linoleic acid) on these genes in A. terreus. This study therefore demonstrates for the first time the potential of an oxylipin molecule as an enhancer of a fungal secondary metabolite production with positive impact for industrial exploitation.", 
    "35": "Nicotinic acid (niacin) is one of the oldest drugs used to treat dyslipidemia. In addition to modestly lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and lipoprotein(a), niacin is currently the most effective available agent for raising high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Despite its well-documented beneficial effects on lipids, the clinical use of niacin has been limited by its side effect profile, notably flushing. This sensation of cutaneous vasodilatation and burning has limited patient compliance and is a frequent cause of discontinuation of the drug. While pretreatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, such as aspirin, may reduce the incidence of flushing, present-day niacin still results in flushing in many patients. Recent studies have elucidated what we currently understand as the molecular mechanism that mediates niacin-induced flushing, specifically that niacin acting through its receptor stimulates the production of several prostaglandins, including prostaglandin (PG) I(2), PGE(2) and PGD(2). Laropiprant is a potent, highly selective prostaoid DP(1) receptor antagonist that decreases the incidence and intensity of niacin-induced flushing without affecting its beneficial lipid effects. Thus, laropiprant, when used in conjunction with niacin, can improve the tolerability of niacin and aid in medication compliance. This paper reviews the data suggesting the importance of raising HDL with niacin, describes the pharmacology of the drug, and examines the potential beneficial effects of combining niacin with laropiprant.", 
    "36": "The cognitive status of aged familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) patients treated with long-term statin therapy was compared with that of population controls. A comprehensive cohort of 43 elderly (age > or = 65 years) patients all with the same FH North Karelia mutation living in North Karelia (eastern Finland) was identified, 37 of whom (aged 65 to 84 years) agreed to participate. All but one of these FH patients had been using statins for approximately 15 years. Population-based controls (aged 65 to 84 years, n= 309) were the participants of the Health 2000 Survey living in eastern Finland. The cognitive assessment was conducted with tests for verbal fluency, Word List Learning (WLL) and Word List Delayed Recall (WLDR) subtests in the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's disease test battery. After adjustment for age, gender, education, diabetes mellitus, and coronary heart disease, FH patients were more likely to be in the top tertile of the WLDR (Odds ratio (OR) 3.40, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.52-7.63) and WLL3 (OR 2.83, 95% CI 1.28-6.25) subtests. When the FH patients were subdivided according to the median length of their statin therapy, the ORs to be in the top tertile in the WLDR subtest were 1.65 (95% CI 0.52-5.25) for those with less and 5.40 (95% CI 1.74-17.72) in those individuals with more than median length of statin therapy. In conclusion, aged FH patients receiving long-term statin therapy exhibited better episodic memory than population controls, and this association became even more pronounced with longer statin therapy.", 
    "37": "A best evidence topic in cardiac surgery was written according to a structured protocol. The question addressed was whether statins slow the process of calcification of aortic tissue valves. Altogether 207 papers were found using the reported search, of which eight represented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The authors, journal, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes and results of these papers are tabulated. We acknowledge the limited evidence in this very specific field of cardiac surgery. Due to their pleiotropic effects, including anti-inflammatory properties, there has been speculation that statins could reduce and delay the degeneration and calcification of aortic bioprosthetic valves. Mainly, it was extrapolation of the recently discovered molecular similarities between atherosclerosis and native aortic valve stenosis (AS), with some evidence that statins may slow the progression of native aortic valve calcific degeneration, and the potential harmful impact of atherosclerotic risk factors on the development of native AS. Several studies have been conducted to evaluate the impact of hyperlipidemia and serum cholesterol levels on structural valve deterioration (SVD). Indeed, two studies suggested hyperlipidemia was a risk factor for SVD and correlated reoperation, from which one case-control study based on first-generation biological valves without specific anti-calcification treatment, while three - more convincing by number of patients observed and design of the study - reported contrary results. The other three studies focused on statin treatment in patients after aortic biological valve replacement. Two studies confirmed beneficial effects of statin therapy on valve hemodynamics or inflammatory damage in vivo, but another study, with significantly greater patients series, found lipid-lowering therapy futile in this clinical aspect. Currently, studies and their results are discordant, but statin therapy appears insufficient to result in better clinical outcomes. We conclude that even though the data is conflicting, statin therapy does not prevent SVD of bioprosthetic valves in the aortic position.",

Data about reimbursed prescriptions of beta-blockers (BBs), angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor blockers (ACE/ARBs) and statins for these patients was obtained from the database of the Estonian Health Insurance Fund. Data were mainly analysed using frequency tables and, where appropriate, the Pearson's chi2 test, the Mann-Whitney U-test and the t-test were used.

    "50": "The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) arises from direct and indirect injury to the lungs and results in a life-threatening form of respiratory failure in a heterogeneous, critically ill patient population. Critical care technologies used to support patients with ARDS, including strategies for mechanical ventilation, have resulted in improved outcomes in the last decade. However, there is still a need for effective pharmacotherapies to treat ARDS, as mortality rates remain high. To date, no single pharmacotherapy has proven effective in decreasing mortality in adult patients with ARDS, although exogenous surfactant replacement has been shown to reduce mortality in the paediatric population with ARDS from direct causes. Several promising therapies are currently being investigated in preclinical and clinical trials for treatment of ARDS in its acute and subacute, exudative phases. These include exogenous surfactant therapy, beta(2)-adrenergic receptor agonists, antioxidants, immunomodulating agents and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). Recent research has also focused on prevention of acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress in patients at risk. Drugs such as captopril, rosiglitazone and incyclinide (COL-3), a tetracycline derivative, have shown promising results in animal models, but have not yet been tested clinically. Further research is needed to discover therapies to treat ARDS in its late, fibroproliferative phase. Given the vast number of negative clinical trials to date, it is unlikely that a single pharmacotherapy will effectively treat all patients with ARDS from differing causes. Future randomized controlled trials should target specific, more homogeneous subgroups of patients for single or combination therapy.",

Furthermore, little is known about the relationship between high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and virological response. To determine whether baseline LDL or HDL levels and statin use affect SVR rates, we retrospectively evaluated the IDEAL (Individualized Dosing Efficacy Versus Flat Dosing to Assess Optimal Pegylated Interferon Therapy) trial, in which 3070 treatment-naive, hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1-infected patients were treated for up to 48 weeks in one of the following arms: (1) peginterferon (PEG-IFN) alfa-2b at 1.5 microg/kg/week with ribavirin (RBV) at 800 to 1400 mg/day, (2) PEG-IFN alfa-2b at 1.0 microg/kg/week with RBV at 800 to 1400 mg/day, or (3) PEG-IFN alfa-2a at 180 microg/week with RBV at 1000 to 1200 mg/day. Virological responses were assessed by pretreatment statin use and baseline elevated LDL levels (> or =130 mg/dL) or low HDL levels (<40 mg/dL for men and <50 mg/dL for women). In 1464 patients with baseline elevated LDL levels or low HDL levels, the SVR rate was significantly higher than that in patients with normal levels (44.9% versus 34.0%, P < 0.001). In 66 patients receiving a statin pretreatment, the SVR rate was higher than the rate of those not receiving it (53.0% versus 39.3%, P = 0.02). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis using the stepwise selection method with baseline characteristics, a high LDL level [odds ratio (OR) = 1.6, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.4-1.8, P < 0.001], a low HDL level (OR = 0.5, 95% CI = 0.3-0.8, P = 0.004), and statin use (OR = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.1-3.7, P = 0.02) were independently associated with SVR.",

    "80": "Statins are potent inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis. Several statins are available with different molecular and pharmacokinetic properties. Simvastatin is more lipophilic than pravastatin and has a higher affinity to phospholipid membranes than atorvastatin, allowing its passive diffusion through the cell membrane. In vitro studies on bone marrow stromal cells, osteoblast-like cells, and embryonic stem cells have shown statins to have cholesterol-independent anabolic effects on bone metabolism; alas, statins were supplemented in osteogenic medium, which does not facilitate elucidation of their potential osteoinductive properties. Embryonic stem cells (ESCs), derived from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst, are unique in that they enjoy perpetual self-proliferation, are pluripotent, and are able to differentiate toward all the cellular lineages composing the body, including the osteogenic lineage. Consequently, ESCs represent a potentially potent cell source for future clinical cellular therapies of various bone diseases, even though there are several hurdles that still need to be overcome. Herein we demonstrate, for the first time to our knowledge, that simvastatin induces murine ESC (mESC) differentiation toward the osteogenic lineage in the absence of osteoinductive supplements. Specifically, we found that a simvastatin concentration in the micromolar range and higher was toxic to the cells and that an effective concentration for osteoinduction is 0.1 nM, as shown by increased alizarin red staining as well as increased osteocalcin and osetrix gene expression. These results suggest that in the future, lipophilic simvastatin may provide a novel pharmacologic agent for bone tissue engineering applications.",

In this study, lovastatin treatment was found to inhibit ligand-induced EGFR dimerization in squamous cell carcinoma cells and its activation of AKT and its downstream targets 4E-binding protein 1 and S6 kinase 1. This inhibition was associated with global protein translational inhibition shown by a decrease in RNA associated polysome fractions. The effects of lovastatin on EGFR function were reversed by the addition of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, which functions as a protein membrane anchor. Lovastatin treatment induced actin cytoskeletal disorganization and the expression of geranylgeranylated rho family proteins that regulate the actin cytoskeleton, including rhoA. Lovastatin-induced rhoA was inactive as EGF stimulation failed to activate rhoA and inhibition of the rho-associated kinase, a target and mediator of rhoA function, with Y-27632 also showed inhibitory effects on EGFR dimerization. The ability of lovastatin to inhibit EGFR dimerization is a novel exploitable mechanism regulating this therapeutically relevant target.

Donepezil served as a positive control. The rats were administered with single dose of STZ for the induction of diabetes. Drug treatment was started after one month of STZ administration and treatment was continued till the end of the study (i.e. 56th day). On 52nd day onwards, the animals were exposed to Morris water-maze (MWM) for testing learning & memory. Serum glucose, bodyweight, vascular endothelial function, serum nitrite / nitrate levels, aortic & brain oxidative stress levels and brain acetylcholinesterase activity were also tested. STZ treated animals performed poorly on MWM hence reflecting impairment of learning & memory. Further STZ treatment also produced a reduction in body weight, impairment of vascular endothelial function, decrease in serum nitrite / nitrate levels, along with increase in serum glucose, aortic & brain oxidative stress levels and brain acetylcholinesterase activity. Treatment of HMAP, Pitavastatin and Donepezil significantly reversed diabetes induced learning and memory, endothelial dysfunction, and changes in various biochemical levels.

Here we describe the case of a 41-year-old man whose attacks of coronary spasm were resistant to the combined administration of nitrates, Ca antagonists, and a statin. The attacks were alleviated and disappeared after withdrawal of nitrates and recurred after readministration of a nitroglycerin patch. The involvement of nitrate tolerance in the pathogenesis of multidrug resistant coronary spasm was revealed and its implication discussed.", 
    "113": "Altered arginine metabolism, the uncoupling of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) by asymmetric dimethyl-arginine (ADMA), increased oxo-nitrosative stress, and cellular injury were reported in airway epithelial cells in asthma. Statins improve vascular endothelial dysfunction by reducing ADMA and increasing endothelial NOS (eNOS), thereby reducing oxo-nitrosative stress in cardiovascular diseases. Whether statin therapy leads to similar beneficial effects in lung epithelium in asthma is unknown. The effects of simvastatin therapy after sensitization (40 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) on markers of arginine and NO metabolism and features of asthma were ascertained in a murine model of allergic asthma. The effects of simvastatin on the expression of NOS in A549 lung epithelial cells were studied in vitro. Simvastatin induced eNOS in lung epithelial cells in vitro. In acute and chronic models of asthma, simvastatin therapy was associated with significantly reduced airway inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness, and airway remodeling. ADMA and inducible nitric oxide synthase were reduced by simvastatin, but eNOS was increased. A marked reduction of nitrotyrosine, a marker of oxo-nitrosative stress, was evident in airway epithelium. Cell injury markers such as cytosolic cytochrome c, caspases 3 and 9 and apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (Apaf-1) were also reduced. Simvastatin improves dysfunctional nitric oxide metabolism in allergically inflamed lungs. Important pleiotropic mechanisms may be responsible for the statin-induced reduction of airway inflammation, epithelial injury, and airway hyperresponsiveness.",

Age- and sex-adjusted incidence rates were calculated for myocardial infarction overall and separately for ST-segment elevation and non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. Patient characteristics, outpatient medications, and cardiac biomarker levels during hospitalization were identified from health plan databases, and 30-day mortality was ascertained from administrative databases, state death data, and Social Security Administration files.",

    "122": "Ezetimibe, a selective inhibitor of intestinal cholesterol absorption, rapidly became one of the most widely drugs in the US following its approval by the FDA in 2002. Due to its capacity to significantly lower LDL-C with few side effects, ezetimibe has been very useful in enabling patients who were statin intolerant to reach their recommended therapeutic goal for LDL-C. In addition, ezetimibe also reduces non-HDL-C and raises HDL-C, further enhancing its effectiveness in clinical practice. A significant preponderance of evidence supports the reduction of LDL-C and non-HDL-C as the most effective therapy to prevent or reverse atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). However 3 recent clinical trials, ENHANCE, SEAS, and ARBITER 6-HALTS have raised questions about the efficacy and safety of ezetimibe and have led to a re-examination of its clinical use as a drug for managing lipid risk factors to prevent or manage ASCVD. An in-depth analysis of these three trials reveals methodological deficiencies and concerns with the statistical methods used which significantly diminish their indictment of the clinical utility of ezetimibe. In contrast, The SANDS trial has confirmed the effectiveness of ezetimibe in managing both LDL-C and non-HDL-C, and also demonstrated this drug's ability to improve carotid atherosclerosis by producing regression of CIMT. One of the important conclusions of the SANDS Trail is that ezetimibe remains an effective adjunctive medication for use in patients who do not reach their LDL-C goals on statin monotherapy. However, as a significant residual risk for ASCVD remains even after aggressive goals for LDL-C and non-HDL-C are reached, current treatment strategies should emphasize managing of all cardiac risk factors and increasing HDL in addition to the attainment and maintenance of recommended goals for LDL-C and non-HDL-C. Hence, ezetimibe should be considered as an important component of broad-spectrum management of lipid risk factors with therapy that includes statins, niacin, bile acid sequestrants, fibrates and Omega 3 fatty acids in appropriate combinations in addition to therapeutic life change.", 
    "123": "To study the source and clinical relevance of elevated cardiac troponin-T (cTnT) in patients with inflammatory myositis of varying etiology is the objective of this study. Patients with new-onset myositis of varying etiologies and raised serum cTnT and creatine kinase (CK) were identified. Clinical myocardial disease was ruled out on the basis of history, examination, ECG, and 2D-echocardiography. Along with serial estimation of CK levels, cTnT isoforms specific to myocardium (by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay) were used for serial estimation of cTnT levels. Gel-filtration chromatography was performed to investigate the nature of elevated cTnT in myositis patients compared to that in acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Patients requiring hospitalization due to an indication related to myositis were classified as having severe disease. All patients received conventional management for myositis as indicated in individual cases. Eleven patients (eight women, three men; aged 59-87 years) with polymyositis (five), dermatomyositis (three), statin-induced myopathy (two), and inclusion body myositis (one) were studied. The cTnT in myositis patients was found to be identical to cTnT in ACS. The time kinetics of cTnT was different from CK and their levels did not correlate. While CK normalized with treatment, cTnT levels exhibited prolonged elevation. Nine of the patients with raised cTnT had severe disease despite absence of clinical myocardial disease. Three died. cTnT in sera of patients with inflammatory muscle disease is of cardiac origin. It may identify a subgroup with subclinical myocardial involvement with differential response to treatment compared to skeletal muscle. We feel cTnT is an important laboratory investigation in patients with myositis.", 
    "124": "Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) is a member of the prostaglandins and has a variety of cardiovascular protective effects. Increasing attention has been paid to the anti-inflammation activity of PGE1, but little direct evidence has been found. We investigated the effects of PGE1 on cell adhesion and inflammation and the mechanisms responsible for this activity in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Results demonstrated that pretreatment with PGE1 decreased the adhesion between vascular endothelial cells and monocytes, reduced the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and E-selectin in vascular endothelial cells. In addition, PGE1 suppressed TNF-induced NF-kappaB activation and production of reactive oxygen species. We concluded that PGE1 suppressed the vascular inflammatory process, which might be closely related to the inhibition of reactive oxygen species and NF-kappaB activation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells.",

Although statins are widely used for treatment of hyperlipidemia, side effects associated with their use have prompted the search for a safer alternative for treating hyperlipidemia. The present study investigated the effect of water-soluble compounds in Abana (WSCA), a polyherbal drug formulation traditionally used in India for the treatment of hyperlipidemia, on lipid metabolism in HepG2 cells. WSCA reduced cholesterol and triglyceride content in the cells and their supernatant. WSCA inhibited the incorporation of [2-14C]acetate into cellular cholesterol and fatty acids, suggesting the inhibition of lipid synthesis. In addition, WSCA inhibited HMG-CoA reductase, a key metabolic enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of cholesterol. WSCA also increased cholesterol and fatty acid secretion into the cell supernatant, suggesting the enhanced removal of cholesterol and fatty acids. Furthermore, WSCA showed decreased linoleic acid (18:2) and arachidonic acid (20:4) content in HepG2 cells. The present study is the first to show that WSCA simultaneously inhibited cellular cholesterol biosynthesis and increased cholesterol secretion into the cell supernatant in HepG2 cells.", 
    "126": "Diabetic nephropathy is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Statins may exert renoprotective effects independently of lipid-lowering properties. We investigated the pleiotropic effects of rosuvastatin on renal structure and function in streptozotocin diabetic apolipoprotein-E knockout (Apo-E(-/-)) mice, a model of progressive nephropathy in which dyslipidemia is resistant to statin treatment. These effects were compared with those observed with conventional renin-angiotensin system blockade (candesartan) or combined treatment. Nondiabetic and diabetic Apo-E(-/-) mice were randomized to no treatment or treatment with candesartan (2.5 mg/kg), rosuvastatin (5 mg/kg), or their combination per gavage for 20 wk. Urine and blood samples were collected for assessment of albuminuria, creatinine clearance, plasma lipids, glucose, and glycated hemoglobin. Renal sclerosis was analyzed on paraffin-embedded kidney sections stained with periodic acid-Schiff. Renal expression of collagen IV, fibronectin and advanced glycation end products (AGEs), receptor for advanced glycation and products (RAGE), NADPH oxidase 4 (NOX4), and nitrotyrosine was assessed by real-time PCR and/or immunohistochemistry. Diabetes-induced albuminuria was not affected by rosuvastatin and combination treatment but was prevented by candesartan. Diabetes resulted in increased creatinine clearance, which was not modified by the treatments. Rosuvastatin and/or candesartan prevented diabetes-associated renal extracellular matrix accumulation. Rosuvastatin reduced accumulation of AGEs and expression of RAGE, NOX4, and nitrotyrosine. In conclusion, in the diabetic Apo-E(-/-) mouse, rosuvastatin confers renal benefits that are independent of lipid lowering and equivalent or greater to those observed with candesartan. The combination treatment is not superior to monotherapies.",

These increases remained significant after adjustment for potentially confounding factors that differed between groups, such as C-reactive protein and HDL-cholesterol serum levels, and statin use. Femoral plaque vulnerability did not differ between RA and controls. The presence of RA was found to be an independent predictor of increased femoral IMT (p=0.004), after adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors, C-reactive protein and treatment with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and statins.

OCT confirmed in vivo that the incidence of target lesion and remote TCFA varies with the clinical syndrome of the patients, being most pronounced in patients with acute myocardial infarction as compared to patients with stable angina. In culprit lesions where rupture of a fibrous cap has been documented, the fibrous cap thickness was in the range of 50 micron and macrophage density was elevated. Encouraging small scale clinical studies evaluated treatment effects in this population. OCT was used to demonstrate statin effects on fibrous cap thickness or the effects of different stent designs.

This paper reviews the study design and data analyses of observational studies of cardiovascular drug effects in patients with COPD and evaluates the potential for bias on the validity of their findings. Three recent observational studies of statin use in the setting of COPD show surprisingly high efficacy results which, by their magnitude, demand closer analysis. Such analysis reveals that immortal time and immeasurable time biases likely accounted for dramatic findings of reduced mortality with aggressive treatment for cardiovascular disease. After removing these sources of bias, the effects are mitigated or may disappear entirely. Investigation of methods and results in the statin studies reviewed in this article reveals significant bias that has skewed the results of these early studies. Correcting these methodological flaws with proper statistical analysis may attenuate or even eliminate these apparent benefits.", 
    "150": "Human hepatocytes in primary culture are a very useful model to directly assess induction of gene expression by xenobiotics. We developed a cytochrome P450 (P450) activity cocktail assay using model substrates for the seven important P450s 1A2 (phenacetin), 2B6 (bupropion), 2C8 (amodiaquine), 2C9 (tolbutamide), 2C19 (S-mephenytoin), 2D6 (propafenone), and 3A4 (atorvastatin). Metabolite formation was determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in hepatocyte culture supernatants. Atorvastatin has not been previously assessed as a CYP3A probe drug. We demonstrate highly selective atorvastatin ortho-hydroxylation by CYP3A4 by recombinant P450s. In human liver microsomes ortho-hydroxyatorvastatin formation was highly correlated with CYP3A4 protein content (r(s) = 0.78, p < 0.0001, n = 150). We profiled induction of these P450 activities in primary human hepatocytes after treatment with 30 microM atorvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin for 24 to 72 h. Except for pravastatin, all statins induced P450 activities to various degrees, approximately in the order atorvastatin > simvastatin > lovastatin > rosuvastatin. Inducibility of P450s followed the order CYP2C8 > CYP3A4 > CYP2C9 > CYP2B6 > CYP2C19 approximately CYP2D6 > CYP1A2. The strongest induction was observed for amodiaquine N-desalkylation, which was induced approximately 20-fold. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction confirmed corresponding changes on the mRNA level with even more dramatic induction up to almost 100-fold. These data suggest a broader inducing effect of statins on cytochrome P450s and possibly other absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion genes than previously known, thus further emphasizing their drug-drug interaction potential. Our cocktail assay should be helpful for economical use of human hepatocytes in the assessment of P450 induction by drugs and drug candidates.", 
    "151": "Even using intensive statin monotherapy, many patients fail to achieve all the desired lipid goals and remain at high residual risk of cardiovascular events. In view of the still unproven decisively intensive \"statin as monotherapy\" strategy and \"residual risk\" concept, it is logical to ask whether other strategies, particularly fibrate/statin combination therapy, could be more beneficial and safer. A clear benefit of fibrate monotherapy did emerge previously among patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia (particularly high triglycerides and low high density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C]) typically present in the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. In contrast, in patients without atherogenic dyslipidemia this favorable effect was not demonstrated. The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) study investigated whether combination therapy with a statin plus a fibrate, as compared with statin monotherapy, would reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, relevant patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia represented less than 17 percent of the ACCORD Lipid population (941 out of 5518 patients). In this prespecified subgroup, the patients benefited from fenofibrate therapy in addition to simvastatin similar to the previous \"fibrate's as monotherapy\" trials: the primary outcome rate was 12.4% in the fenofibrate group, versus 17.3% in the placebo group (28% crude HR reduction, CI less than 1, e.g. statistically significant findings). Among all other 4548 patients without atherogenic dyslipidemia such rates were 10.1% in both fenofibrate and placebo study groups. Authors concluded that in the overall cohort of patients the combination of fenofibrate and simvastatin did not reduce the rate of the cardiovascular events as compared with simvastatin alone. Thus, their results do not support the routine use of combination therapy with fenofibrate and simvastatin to reduce cardiovascular risk in the general patients with type 2 diabetes. A recent large meta-analysis regarding effects of fibrates on cardiovascular outcomes noted greater effect sizes in trials that recorded a higher mean baseline triglyceride concentration (p = 0.030). As expected, in a so called \"general population\", reflecting a blend of effects in patients with and without atherogenic dyslipidemia, a mean \"diluted\" effect of fibrate therapy was reduced, but still producing a significant 10% relative risk (RR) decrease in major cardiovascular events (p = 0.048) and a 13% RR reduction for coronary events (p < 0.0001). It should be pinpointed that the epidemiological characteristics of the ACCORD Lipid study depart from those seen in real clinical practice: among people with type 2 diabetes, there is a high prevalence of atherogenic dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome. For example, an analysis of NHANES III data in adults aged >or=50 years showed that approximately 86% of patients with type 2 diabetes also had the metabolic syndrome. Therefore, an important finding of ACCORD Lipid study was the observation that fibrates may lead to cardiovascular risk reduction in patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia not only as monotherapy but in combination with statins as well. In conclusion, in patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia (high triglycerides and low HDL-C, fibrates -- either as monotherapy or combined with statins - were associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular events. In patients without dyslipidemia this favorable effect - as expected - was absent.",

The data of the comet assay showed a statistically significant loss of DNA integrity after 5 days of exposure to atorvastatin and after one week of exposure to gemfibrozil. This damage was, however, repaired after 14 days. Sildenafil citrate produced, instead, a statistically significant loss of DNA integrity at the concentrations found only after 35 days of exposure. The genotoxicity at the molecular level was tested by RAPD-PCR. The results from this investigation are in agreement with those from two other tests, confirming the efficacy of the use of the three experimental approaches for the complete evaluation of genotoxic damage.", 
    "161": "Coronary artery disease is the major cause of death in the western world. The formation and rapid progression of atheromatous plaques can lead to serious cardiovascular events in patients with atherosclerosis. The better understanding, in recent years, of the mechanisms leading to atheromatous plaque growth and disruption and the availability of powerful HMG CoA-reductase inhibitors (statins) has permitted the consideration of plaque regression as a realistic therapeutic goal. This article reviews the existing evidence underpinning current therapeutic strategies aimed at achieving atherosclerotic plaque regression. In this review we also discuss imaging modalities for the assessment of plaque regression, predictors of regression and whether plaque regression is associated with a survival benefit.", 
    "162": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, commonly known as statins, are the medical treatment of choice for hypercholesterolemia. In addition to achieving a therapeutic decrease in serum cholesterol levels, statin therapy appears to promote pleiotropic effects that are independent of changes in serum cholesterol. These cholesterol lowering and pleiotropic effects are beneficial not only for the coronary circulation, but for the myocardium and peripheral arterial system as well. Patients receiving statin therapy must be carefully monitored, however, as statins potentially have harmful side effects and drug interactions. This article is part II of a 2-part review, and it focuses on the clinical aspects of statin therapy in cardiovascular disease.", 
    "163": "Several studies have documented a slight but significant deterioration of renal function after endovascular repair of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) (EVAR). The aim of this retrospective study was therefore to investigate whether medication with statins may favourably affect perioperative renal function.", 
    "164": "From January 2000 to January 2008, out of a total cohort of 287 elective patients receiving endovascular repair of their AAA or aortoiliac aneurysm, 127 patients were included in the present study, as their medication was reliably retrievable. Patients were divided according to whether their medication included statins (>3 months). Second, they were subdivided according to their supra- (SR) or infrarenal (IR) endograft fixation. Serum creatinine (SCr) and creatinine (CrCl) clearance were determined preoperatively, postoperatively, at 6 and 12 months. Patients with known pre-existing renal disease, with incorrect placement of the stent graft resulting in severe renal artery stenosis, and with occlusion or renal parenchymal infarction were excluded from the study.", 
    "165": "Patients receiving an infrarenal fixation of their graft had no change in the renal function, regardless whether they were on statins or not. In patients with SR fixation not receiving statins, a deterioration in renal function was observed in the early postoperative period ((SCr) preoperative vs. SCr postoperative: 1.02\u00b10.2 vs. 1.11\u00b10.28, p<0.001 and (Cr.Cl) preoperative vs. Cr.Cl postoperative: 74.1\u00b121.4 vs. 68.0\u00b121.4, p<0.001), whereas patients on statins experienced no change in renal function (SCr preoperative vs. SCr postoperative: 0.99\u00b10.24 vs. 1.02\u00b10.20n.s. and Cr.Cl preop vs. Cr.Clpostop.: 76.4\u00b119.1 vs. 74.28\u00b120.50, n.s.). During follow-up, a constant worsening of renal function at 6 and 12 months was observed, irrespective of the medication with statins.", 
    "166": "The present study suggests a slight immediate deterioration of the renal function using (SR) fixation, and this could be prevented by the use of statins. During follow-up, statins did not protect from further renal deterioration. Broader studies are needed to confirm a definitive relation between statin use and renal protection during the endovascular repair of AAA.", 
    "167": "An interaction between fusidic acid and HMG coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), resulting in rhabdomyolysis, has been described. Pain and mild weakness are common presenting symptoms.", 
    "168": "We report four patients with Type 2 diabetes prescribed long-term statin treatment who, following treatment with fusidic acid, presented atypically with painless, severe flaccid paralysis suggestive of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. This, together with nerve conduction studies consistent with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, resulted in the delayed recognition of rhabdomyolysis in these cases.", 
    "169": "The addition of fusidic acid can precipitate rhabdomyolysis in patients with diabetes already taking a statin. This can present with rapidly progressive weakness resembling Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. We recommend that creatine kinase is checked in patients with diabetes on statin therapy who present with profound weakness and routinely in those commenced on prolonged courses of fusidic acid.", 
    "170": "To investigate all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in subjects with diabetes caused by a mutation in the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha gene (HNF1A).", 
    "171": "We identified 39 British families with HNF1A mutations. Consenting individuals were asked details of age and cause of death of parents and siblings. Copies of death certificates were requested from the family or were obtained via the Offices for National Statistics.", 
    "172": "Data were collated on 241 control subjects and 153 mutation carriers. Of those who died, 66% of mutation carriers died from a cardiovascular-related illness compared with 43% of control subjects (P = 0.02). Family members with HNF1A mutations died at a younger age than familial control subjects [all-cause hazard ratio, adjusting for sex and smoking status: 1.9 (95% confidence interval 1.2, 2.9, P = 0.006; cardiovascular hazard ratio: 2.3, confidence interval 1.3, 4.2, P = 0.006)].", 
    "173": "We have shown that individuals known to have diabetes caused by a mutation in the HNF1A gene have an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality compared with their unaffected family members. As with other forms of diabetes, consideration should be given to early statin therapy despite a seemingly protective lipid profile.", 
    "174": "Beh\u00e7et's disease is a chronic inflammatory vasculitis. Vascular involvement is one of the major complications of Beh\u00e7et's disease, during the course of the disease. Previous studies showed that ACE inhibitors and statins may improve endothelial functions in endothelial dysfunction. The aim of our study is to compare the effects of atorvastatin and lisinopril to placebo on endothelial dysfunction in patients with Beh\u00e7et's disease.", 
    "175": "We prospectively studied 92 (48 female) Beh\u00e7et's patients who were diagnosed according to the International Study Group criteria. Endothelial dysfunction was evaluated by brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) method using high-resolution vascular ultrasound device at baseline and after for 3-month therapy. Patients were consecutively randomized into three groups as (atorvastatin (n = 31), lisinopril (n = 31), and placebo groups (n = 30). Patients in atorvastatin group received 20 mg atorvastatin, lisinopril group received 10 mg lisinopril per day, and placebo group received placebo per day for 3 months.", 
    "176": "The baseline characteristics of patients were similar among three groups; however, high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels were lower in atorvastatin group than placebo group. A significant improvement in FMD was observed in both atorvastatin (5.0 \u00b1 1.4 vs. 12.8 \u00b1 3.6%, P < 0.001) and lisinopril groups (5.0 \u00b1 1.2 vs. 11.4 \u00b1 5.0%, P < 0.001). Partial significant enhancement was observed in placebo group (4.9 \u00b1 1.1% vs. 5.7 \u00b1 1.0, P = 0.002). However, it was lower than the cutoff value for endothelial dysfunction.", 
    "177": "These findings suggest that atorvastatin and lisinopril improve endothelial functions in Beh\u00e7et's disease patients. However, large studies are needed to determine the long-term effects of atorvastatin and lisinopril therapy.", 
    "178": "Statins are a lipid-lowering treatment, prescribed frequently to prevent cardiovascular events. The objective of this study was to explore how doctors anticipate the effect of statins and what factors are associated with their willingness to initiate treatment.", 
    "179": "A total of 330 Swedish cardiologists, internists and general practitioners were asked to consider two hypothetical patient cases, one with and one without previous coronary heart disease. Based on these cases, the respondents answered questions about their willingness to initiate treatment and what effects they might expect. The expectation of effect was assessed in two ways: (1) the absolute risk reduction of myocardial infarction in 1000 patients treated with statins for 5 years; and (2) statins' average effect on increased life expectancy. The doctors' beliefs about absolute risk reduction were compared with results from clinical trials.", 
    "180": "Most doctors had a suboptimal expectation about absolute risk reduction; only about one-third had expectations in the range supported by evidence-based data. There were different views about statins' ability to prolong life: that is, average gain in life expectancy due to treatment was believed to be 2 years in the primary patient case, and 3 years in the second patient case. The doctors' beliefs about statins' ability to prolong life were associated significantly with their willingness to initiate treatment.", 
    "181": "The overall results imply that doctors have varying and suboptimal understanding of the effect of statins. This may inhibit the goal of integrating clinical research into clinical practice.", 
    "182": "Safety net urban hospitals are being overwhelmed by an increasing number of patients with diabetes, who frequently only access the health system through visits to emergency departments and urgent care clinics.

    "187": "Among the 1098 patients, 833 (76%) had a repeat A1c during the 2- to 12-month follow-up period. On average, A1c values decreased by 1.5 percentage points; systolic blood pressure decreased by 9 mmHg; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decreased 11 points; and weight decreased 2.3 pounds (all: P < 0.001). The percentage using angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor drugs increased from 45% to 83%; aspirin use increased from 38% to 83%; and statin use increased from 34% to 76%.", 
    "188": "This novel chronic care model for diabetes care of uninsured patients without primary care doctors was feasible, acceptable and effective in increasing the quality of diabetes care and decreasing haemoglobin A1c, blood pressure, cholesterol and weight.", 
    "189": "Recent studies have demonstrated overexpression of osteopontin (OPN) in ovarian clear cell carcinoma. Here, we revealed the role of OPN in invasiveness in ovarian clear cell carcinoma. We used immunofluorescence analysis to detect OPN in a total of 160 patient-derived specimens. Ovarian clear cell carcinoma cell lines, RMG-1 and TOV-21G, were used to monitor changes in OPN and integrin levels, and cell invasiveness following treatment with OPN, simvastatin, and transfection with siRNA. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed statistically significant differences among the histological groups, and ovarian clear cell carcinoma expressed a strong OPN signal. The OPN receptors, alpha v and 5, and beta 1 and 3 integrins, were increased after treatment with OPN. Invasion assays indicated that OPN enhanced in vitro extracellular matrix invasion dose-dependently in ovarian clear cell carcinoma. Simvastatin significantly reduced expression of OPN and the integrins, and decreased ECM invasion. RNA interference also suppressed ECM invasion. These results suggest that down- or up-regulation of OPN is involved in carcinoma cell invasion. We thus conclude that OPN regulation could have a crucial role in ovarian clear cell carcinoma therapy.", 
    "190": "Simvastatin (SIM), a widely used drug for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, is a crystalline substance and practically insoluble in water. Its low dissolution rate leads to a poor absorption, distribution, and target organ delivery because the bioavailability of drugs with low aqueous solubility is limited by their dissolution rates.", 
    "191": "The aim of this study was to prepare solid dispersions (SD) of SIM with inert carriers in an attempt to improve the release profile.", 
    "192": "In this work, SIM SD with polyethylene glycol (PEG 6000) or polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP K15) in 1:1, 1:2, 1: 3, 1:4, and 1:5 ratios were prepared and their stability and dissolution properties were investigated. SD were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray powder diffraction. Tablets containing SD SIM : PEG 6000 were developed and their dissolution profile evaluated.", 
    "193": "Drug release from all SD was significantly improved when compared to their corresponding physical mixture or SIM alone. SD SIM:PVP showed drug degradation. The tablets gradually released SIM with a final quantity greater than 80% in 60 minutes.", 
    "194": "The preparation of SIM SD with PEG or PVP is a promising strategy to improve the bioavailability of the drug. SIM SD with PEG are more advantageous over the dispersions prepared with PVP because they do not show drug degradation during preparation.", 
    "195": "The common lipid abnormalities associated with T2DM confer substantial CV risk. Statins are a safe and well-established treatment option for lowering this atherogenic burden and improving outcomes in this patient population. Nonetheless, many patients with T2DM are not receiving a statin, and even those who receive treatment may not be achieving recommended lipid targets. Strategies must be implemented to improve the quality of care for these patients who are at high risk for a primary or secondary CV event.", 
    "196": "The association between cardiovascular events and a high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level has been clearly established by numerous clinical trials. Moreover, reducing the LDL-cholesterol level using statins has been shown to be highly effective in both primary and secondary prevention. Nevertheless, despite statin treatment, the residual cardiovascular risk remains high and a large number of cardiovascular events still occur. On the other hand, a growing number of studies have demonstrated that there is an inverse association between the high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level and cardiovascular risk. The most recent observations indicate that increasing the HDL-cholesterol level confers an additional benefit to reducing the LDL-cholesterol level with statins. Together, these findings justify turning our attention to HDL-cholesterol to provide a novel additional strategy for reducing cardiovascular risk. This review article describes: firstly, epidemiological studies that endorse HDL cholesterol as a therapeutic target; secondly, the different alternative treatments available for increasing the HDL-cholesterol level; and, finally, the benefits associated with such an increase.", 
    "197": "Quantitative measures are needed to identify diabetic patients at higher risk for CV events. Cell-derived microparticles (MPs) are submicron membrane vesicles released from activated cells that are indicative of cell damage. Progenitor cells (PCs) including proangiogenic cells (PACs), often termed endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), are mediators of reparative capacity. We examined whether the relationship of MPs to PCs/PACs could be used as an improved and clinically feasible index of vascular pathology.", 
    "198": "Plasma samples were collected from patients with early-stage (ES, Diagnosis < 1 year) and long-term (LT, Diagnosis > 5 years,) Type 2 diabetes and compared with age related healthy subjects (H). PC and MP subtypes were measured by a combination of flow cytometry and ELISA-based methods. The ratio of procoagulant MPs/CD34(+) PCs proved a valuable index to distinguish between subject groups (P = 0.01). This index of compromised vascular function was highest in the LT group despite intensive statin therapy and was more informative than a range of soluble protein biomarkers.", 
    "199": "This is the first report of a relationship between MPs and PCs in Type 2 diabetes. This ratio may provide a quantitative and clinically feasible measurement of vascular dysfunction and cardiovascular risk in patients with diabetes. \u00a9 2010 International Clinical Cytometry Society.", 
    "200": "We have retrospectively investigated the effects of three strong statins, atorvastatin, pitavastatin, and rosuvastatin, on serum uric acid (SUA) levels. SUA levels after a few months of statin treatment were compared with those before treatment in 150 outpatients with dyslipidemia. In the atorvastatin (n = 62) and rosuvastatin (n = 45) groups, the SUA levels were reduced by 6.5% (p < 0.0001) and 3.6% (p = 0.03) respectively, but in the pitavastatin group (n = 43), the SUA level increased by 3.7% (p = 0.38). Because uric acid is considered a risk factor for cardiovascular disorders, atorvastatin or rosuvastatin treatment may be recommended when statins are used in patients at high risk for cardiovascular disorders complicated with hyperuricemia."
