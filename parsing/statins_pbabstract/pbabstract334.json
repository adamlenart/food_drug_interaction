Plasma cholesterol and aortic root atherosclerotic lesions (ALs) were greater in ApoE(-/-) Control mice (19+/-1 mmol/L and 63,0176+/-38,785 micro m(2), respectively) than in WT mice (2+/-1 mmol/L and 1+/-1 micro m(2), respectively, P<0.01). Fluvastatin significantly decreased plasma cholesterol (-53%) but failed to limit ALs. Renal blood flow was significantly reduced in ApoE(-/-) Control versus WT (-25%, P<0.05) mice. This reduction was prevented by fluvastatin. Aortic and carotid endothelium-dependent relaxations to acetylcholine were not altered in ApoE(-/-) Control versus WT mice. In carotid arteries from WT mice, these responses were abolished after nitro-L-arginine (L-NA), whereas those from ApoE(-/-) Control were only partially inhibited after L-NA but fully abolished after L-NA+diclofenac. Thus, in carotid arteries from ApoE(-/-) mice, vasodilating prostanoids compensate the deficit in NO availability. Fluvastatin prevented this carotid NO deficit.",

    "4": "We measured the mRNA levels of GTP cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH), the rate-limiting enzyme in the first step of de novo BH4 synthesis, by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The mRNA of GTPCH, as well as of eNOS, was upregulated in HUVECs treated with cerivastatin. This increase was time and dose dependent. Fluvastatin was also observed to enhance GTPCH and eNOS mRNA levels. In parallel with this observation, cerivastatin increased intracellular BH4. Incubating HUVECs with tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) was observed to increase GTPCH mRNA while decreasing eNOS mRNA. In the presence of cerivastatin, the TNF-alpha-mediated increase in GTPCH mRNA was enhanced, and the TNF-alpha-mediated decrease in eNOS mRNA was attenuated. Cerivastatin increased the stability of eNOS mRNA. However, it did not alter the stability of GTPCH mRNA but increased GTPCH gene transcription, as shown by nuclear run-on assays. Preteatment of HUVECs with the selective GTPCH inhibitor, 2,4-diamino-6-hydroxypyrimidine, caused a decrease in intracellular BH4 and decreased citrulline formation after stimulation with ionomycin. Furthermore, the potentiating effect of cerivastatin was decreased by limiting the cellular availability of BH4.",

Nitric oxide synthase in cell lysate and NO2/NO3 into the medium were measured in human microvascular (HMEC-1) and umbilical vein (HUVEC) endothelial cells after 24 h of incubation with increasing concentrations of mildly oxidized LDLs with and without atorvastatin and in HMEC-1 with and without vitamin C.

In the whole study group, NO2/NO3 was more strongly correlated with plasma MDA (Rho = 0.70) than LDL-cholesterol (Rho = 0.57). In the FH patients, atorvastatin induced a significant decline in plasma total and LDL-cholesterol (-3.1 +/- 0.5 and -2.9 +/- 0.5 mM, respectively), NO2/NO3 (-35 +/- 8 microM) and MDA (-3.4 +/- 0.7 microM) (P < 0.001 for all). Changes in plasma NO2/NO3 were related to the concomitant changes in plasma MDA (Rho = 0.79, P < 0.006) and not to changes in LDL-cholesterol. In HMEC-1 and in HUVEC, mildly oxidized LDLs stimulated both e-NOS and NO2/NO3 accumulation; the effect on e-NOS was potentiated by vitamin C in HMEC-1. Atorvastatin had no effect in HMEC-1 while it stimulated eNOS but not NO2/NO3 in HUVEC.

The purpose of this work was to help assessing the predictive value of in vitro drug interaction test with liver microsomal fractions and hepatocytes by determination of enzymatic parameters such as the inhibition constant (Ki) and the intrinsic clearance (Clint). This study was conducted to compare different methods of Ki calculation and to determine the most suitable parameter for describing drug interactions. The metabolic interaction between SV and NRG was used as a model to help verifying the suitability of the in vitro model for predicting the kind and degree of metabolic drug interactions. The method of Ki calculation using linearized versions of Michaelis Menten equations based on the simultaneous non linear regressions and the \"km app\" approach accurately estimated the Ki values. The linear representation of an inherently non linear relationship was only used to establish the mechanism of inhibition and the Clint could be used to predict drug interactions. To further prediction in humans, it seems likely that the simultaneous application of both systems, microsomal fractions and hepatocytes will yield conclusions.",

After dietary stabilization, a 2- to 12-week washout period, and a 4-week single-blind placebo lead-in period, 548 patients with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol > or =145 mg/dl (3.75 mmol/L) and < or =250 mg/dl (6.47 mmol/L) and triglycerides < or =350 mg/dl (3.99 mmol/L) were randomized to one of the following, administered daily for 12 weeks: ezetimibe 10 mg; lovastatin 10, 20, or 40 mg; ezetimibe 10 mg plus lovastatin 10, 20, or 40 mg; or placebo. The primary efficacy variable was percentage decrease in direct LDL cholesterol from baseline to end point for pooled ezetimibe plus lovastatin versus pooled lovastatin alone. Ezetimibe plus lovastatin significantly improved concentrations of LDL cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides compared with lovastatin alone (p <0.01). The coadministration of ezetimibe provided an incremental 14% LDL cholesterol decrease, a 5% HDL cholesterol increase, and a 10% decrease in triglycerides compared with pooled lovastatin alone. Ezetimibe plus lovastatin provided mean LDL cholesterol decreases of 33% to 45%, median triglyceride decreases of 19% to 27%, and mean HDL cholesterol increases of 8% to 9%, depending on the statin dose. The coadministration of ezetimibe 10 mg plus the starting dose of lovastatin (10 mg) provided comparable efficacy to high-dose lovastatin (40 mg) across the lipid profile (LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides). Ezetimibe plus lovastatin was well tolerated, with a safety profile similar to both lovastatin alone and placebo. The coadministration of ezetimibe and lovastatin may offer a new treatment option in lipid management of patients with hypercholesterolemia.",

When cultured separately, both cell types expressed TNF-alpha. This was attenuated in U-937 cells by all three drugs (p<0.001 for each), whereas only enalapril reduced the TNF-alpha content of activated HCAEC (p=0.02).

Recent retrospective studies have correlated risk factors commonly associated with coronary and vascular atherosclerosis with an accelerated rate of aortic valve stenosis. Although hydroxymethyl glutaryl co-enzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin) treatment therapy has been shown to delay the rate of progression of valvular aortic stenosis, the salutary mechanism of the statin may be cholesterol-lowering and/or anti-inflammatory. Further prospective studies are warranted to investigate the mechanism and medical therapy of aortic sclerosis and stenosis.",

The only treatment currently available for the disease is pharmacotherapy with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, a palliative strategy aimed at the temporary improvement of cognitive function. Other strategies with disease-modifying potential may include the use of antiinflammatory drugs, estrogen replacement therapy and antioxidants. Recent progress in understanding the molecular and cellular pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease has suggested possible pharmacological interventions that could modify the development and progress of the disease (disease-modifying therapy), such as treatment with secretase inhibitors, transition metal chelators, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and amyloid-b immunization. Inhibitors of tau hyperphosphorylation may also modulate the development and progress of the disease.", 
    "18": "Sterol 27-hydroxylase has been suggested to be involved in an alternative pathway for the elimination of cholesterol from macrophages and early atherosclerotic lesions. We have previously shown that human lung macrophages as well as monocyte-derived macrophages have a relatively high activity of sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27). This enzyme converts intracellular cholesterol into 27-hydroxycholesterol and cholestenoic acid that flux from cultured cells into the medium. It is shown here that human monocytes have very low CYP27 activity and CYP27 mRNA levels. During differentiation into macrophages, both CYP27 activity and CYP27 mRNA levels increase markedly after 4 days of culture in serum-free medium. Addition of macrophage-colony stimulating factor had no significant effect on the induction and addition of fetal calf serum had an inhibitory effect. Cholesterol synthesis was found to be a critical factor for the production of 27-oxygenated products by the macrophages cultured in serum-free medium. The increased capacity of the differentiated cells to eliminate intracellular cholesterol is of interest and supports the contention that CYP27 is an antiatherogenic factor.",

The number of hospitalizations, physician visits, and prescriptions, and their associated costs to the Manitoba health care system were calculated. Statin interacters were defined as users with >1 prescription for an interacting drug while receiving a statin. Interacting drugs were classified into 2 groups: group A included drugs whose levels increased as a result of the statin prescription; drugs in group B increased statin levels.

The content of total taxanes decreased in the cases of MVS, NaPP and DLG addition, regardless of the inhibitor concentration, whereas it increased in the case of CCC addition. It was thus presumed that a mevalonate pathway might exist in IPP biosynthesis at the late growth phase of Taxus cells and that some IPP might transfer from the cytoplasm to the plastids. This presumption was also confirmed by analysing the effects of the inhibitors on taxane content. It was further demonstrated that IPP in the biosynthesis of taxol, baccatin III and 10-deacetylbaccatin III might transfer from the cytoplasm to the plastids, whereas the translocation of IPP might be not involved in cephalomannine biosynthesis. Furthermore, in combination with the results of previous studies, it is very probable that different IPP biosynthesis pathways exist during different growth phases in Taxus cells.",

Serum cholesterol levels and ratios of the precursor sterols to cholesterol after 1 year of treatment were reduced in proportion to the pretreatment values (33% +/- 1% by simvastatin and 36% +/- 1% by atorvastatin; P <.01 for difference between groups) for cholesterol; the respective reductions in the precursor sterol:cholesterol ratios were also higher with atorvastatin (50% +/- 2% for lathosterol) than with simvastatin (42% +/- 1%; P <.01 between groups), but the ratio of squalene to cholesterol was increased (17% +/- 5%, P <.001) by atorvastatin. Plant sterol concentrations were gradually increased by atorvastatin but decreased initially by simvastatin. However, their ratios with respect to cholesterol were increased by as much as 82% with atorvastatin and by as much as 39% with simvastatin. In conclusion, effective inhibition of cholesterol synthesis and subsequent reduction in serum cholesterol levels by statins lead to increases in serum plant-sterol levels, probably as a result of reduced biliary secretion and enhanced absorption of these sterols. Because serum plant sterols have been claimed to be involved in the early development of atherosclerosis, the question arises whether continuously increasing serum plant sterols during long-term statin treatment should be prevented by cholesterol malabsorption (eg, by plant stanol ester consumption), especially in subjects with high baseline plant sterol values and effective sterol absorption.",

Future trials will be needed to clarify this issue, particularly in patients with no history of coronary artery disease.", 
    "52": "In Italy and Europe, strokes are the third most common cause of death and resulting invalidity. In the ever-increasing 80-years-old-and-over population, strokes become more serious due to the clinical presentation during the acute phase and the ten times higher mortality, but also in relation to the twice as high resulting disability as for younger subjects. With the growing number of ailing and not-self-sufficient elderly, other resources will have to be relocated to this field of public health. Then, the dependence index and the ensuing equivalence based on estimates for the first decades of 2000 will create more difficulties in retrieving the funds for social policies. However, stroke prevention is possible both through correct behavioural habits and pharmacological means. Besides the well-known preventive effects of an adequate antihypertensive, antidiabetic and/or antiaggregant/anticoagulant therapy, there is increasing evidence of the effectiveness of statin therapy in stroke prevention. Subjects with a personal history of cerebrovascular events have an increased coronary risk and vice versa. The greatest part of the risk factors for the cerebrovascular disease coincides with those for cardiovascular disease, for which the correction of the former automatically involves a reduction in incidence of both pathologies. In this context, a statin's rational use can therefore represent an important tool for the combined prevention of the two pathologies. Finally, different hypotheses link the origin of Alzheimer's disease to that of progressive cerebrovascular dementia caused by cerebral microcirculation damage. The aim of this review is to resume the actual knowledge about the epidemiology of cerebrovascular disease in Italy and Europe, and about the means available to prevent this phenomenon.", 
    "53": "Statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A [HMG-CoA] reductase inhibitors) reduce stroke damage independent of lipid lowering by upregulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). Acute withdrawal of statin treatment may suppress endothelial NO production and impair vascular function.", 
    "54": "To test this hypothesis, we treated 129/SV mice with atorvastatin (10 mg/kg) for 14 days and then withdrew treatment.", 
    "55": "Treatment with atorvastatin conferred stroke protection by 40% after filamentous occlusion of the middle cerebral artery followed by reperfusion. Withdrawal of statin treatment, however, resulted in the loss of stroke protection after 2 and 4 days. In mouse aortas and brain vasculature, statins upregulated eNOS message 2.3- and 1.7-fold, respectively, as measured by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Withdrawal of statins resulted in 5- and 2.7-fold downregulation of eNOS in aorta and brain, respectively, after 2 days. Statin treatment decreased RhoA GTPase membrane expression to 48%, while withdrawal of statins resulted in 4-fold increase of RhoA in the membrane. Moreover, platelet factor 4 and beta-thromboglobulin in plasma were significantly downregulated by statin treatment, but withdrawal of statins resulted in a 2.9- and 3.1-fold upregulation after 2 days, respectively. Thrombus formation induced by ligature of the inferior vena cava was significantly reduced by statin treatment. When statin treatment was withdrawn, however, protection was lost between 2 and 4 days.", 
    "56": "Acute termination of statin treatment results in a rapid loss of protection in mouse models of cerebral ischemia and thrombus formation independent of lipid lowering. In patients with acute or impending stroke, withdrawal of statins may impair outcome.", 
    "57": "Over the last 10 years it has become increasingly clear that cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes expressed within endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells play a crucial role in the modulation of vascular homeostasis. There is strong evidence suggesting that the activation of a CYP 2C epoxygenase in endothelial cells is an essential step in nitric oxide (NO)- and prostacyclin (PGI(2))-independent vasodilatation of several vascular beds, particularly in the heart and kidney. Moreover, CYP epoxygenase products as well as CYP-derived reactive oxygen species are intracellular signal transduction molecules involved in several signaling cascades affecting numerous cellular processes, including vascular cell proliferation and angiogenesis. Various pharmacological compounds enhance vascular CYP 2C expression. One group of substances which highlight the possible effects of CYP induction in endothelial cells on vascular function are the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). Cerivastatin and fluvastatin increase CYP 2C mRNA and protein in native and cultured endothelial cells, and enhance the bradykinin-induced NO/PGI(2)-independent relaxation of arterial segments as well as the generation of reactive oxygen species. However, statins also increase the expression of the endothelial NO synthase by approximately twofold. As a consequence, the probability that NO and reactive oxygen species react to generate peroxynitrite is increased and the treatment of vascular segments with statins resulted in enhanced protein tyrosine nitration. These data highlight the role played by CYP 2C in vascular homeostasis and its potential regulation by cardiovascular drugs.", 
    "58": "C-reactive protein (CRP) is one of the acute phase reactants that can increase its serum level up to 100- fold during systemic inflammation. Its clinical use was limited in the past because of its lack of specificity in differentiating infection from other inflammatory processes. With the advent of a high sensitivity assay, CRP was found to be a superb predictor in identifying apparently healthy men and women at risk for developing future cardiovascular events, such as heart attacks and strokes. CRP's predictive power is most likely due to its stability, reproducibility, and proatherogenic properties. Developing consensus to incorporate CRP determination into clinical practice guidelines will be the subject of intense debate and at the same time provide clinical research opportunities in the years to come.", 
    "59": "The significant age-adjusted decline in cardiovascular mortality that has occurred over the past three decades is multifactorial. However, the advent of statin therapy has markedly facilitated the optimization of dyslipidemia in patients at risk for coronary events. Statin therapy has proven to be effective in reducing morbidity and mortality in large-scale primary and secondary prevention trials. As with all therapies, the administration of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG Co A) reductase inhibitors is not without clinical risks. Myopathy, albeit uncommon, was one of the earliest clinical problems associated with statin therapy. Recent data from the large-scale statin mega-trials have clarified the quantitative clinical risk-benefit relationship of reductase inhibitors relative to the induction of muscle toxicity. Histopathologic studies have clarified the potential role of statins in the syndrome of myalgias and normal creatine kinase levels. However, the precise mechanism of statin-associated muscle toxicity remains unclear and is potentially related to genetically mediated muscle enzyme defects, drug interactions, intracellular depletion of metabolic intermediates, and intrinsic properties of the statins per se.", 
    "60": "The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) guidelines call for more aggressive lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and will substantially increase the number of patients eligible for lipid-lowering therapy. Statins, the current treatment standard, have proven to be highly efficacious in lowering LDL-C and reducing coronary heart disease (CHD) risk. Because some patients are unable to tolerate 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) or they are not candidates for statin therapy, however, other cholesterol-lowering modes of therapy are needed. Currently available nonstatin drugs often do not reliably reduce LDL-C to a desired extent or are limited in their safety and tolerability. Ezetimibe, a novel lipid-lowering agent until recently in phase III development, is the first in a new class of selective cholesterol absorption inhibitors and offers a promising new approach to the treatment of dyslipidemia. This article reviews the cholesterol metabolic pathways and the mechanism of action of the currently available lipid-modifying agents and introduces ezetimibe, the first selective cholesterol absorption inhibitor.",

However, the effects of statins on the expression of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in the brain and the sympathetic nervous system remain to be elucidated. The aim of this study was thus to examine the effects of atorvastatin on blood pressure, sympathetic nerve activity, and the expression of NOS in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP) as well as in Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats.", 
    "63": "The animals received atorvastatin (50 mg/kg per day) for 30 days. Systolic blood pressure and heart rate were evaluated using the tail-cuff method. Urinary norepinephrine excretion was measured for 24 h. The expression of eNOS, neuronal NOS (nNOS), and inducible NOS (iNOS) in the brain (cortex, cerebellum, hypothalamus and brainstem), aorta and heart were determined by Western blot analysis.", 
    "64": "Systolic blood pressure and 24-h urinary norepinephrine excretion were significantly decreased in SHRSP, but not in WKY, after the treatment with atorvastatin. The eNOS and iNOS expression in the brain and aorta was significantly increased in atorvastatin-treated SHRSP and WKY. However, the nNOS expression in the brain was not altered in the atorvastatin-treated group.", 
    "65": "These results suggest that atorvastatin decreases blood pressure, at least in part via the reduction of sympathetic nervous system activity in SHRSP. They also suggest that this sympatho-inhibitory effect may be mediated by an increase in NO production, with the upregulation of eNOS expression in the brain.", 
    "66": "To achieve a better understanding of the metabolism and accumulation of paclitaxel and baccatin III in cell cultures of Taxus, inhibitors of the early steps in the terpenoid pathway were applied to a cell suspension culture of Taxus baccata: fosmidomycin as an inhibitor of the non-mevalonate branch of the pathway, and mevinolin as an inhibitor of the mevalonate branch. Synthesis of both taxanes in the cell suspension was first increased when cultured in the product formation medium supplemented with methyljasmonate (100 microM). The product formation medium was selected after assaying 24 different culture media. When fosmidomycin (200 microM) was added to the product formation medium together with the elicitor, the accumulation of paclitaxel and baccatin III was reduced by up to 3.0 and 1.5 times, respectively, whereas the inhibitory effect of mevinolin (1 microM) was only clearly exerted in the case of paclitaxel. Under the conditions of our experiment, we conclude that in the synthesis of both taxanes, the non-mevalonate pathway is the main source of the universal terpenoid precursor isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP).", 
    "67": "Cardiovascular disease is still the leading cause of death in Western countries. Epidemiological studies have shown that hypercholesterolemia is a major risk factor for coronary artery disease. Clinical trials of lipid lowering therapy with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG Co-A) reductase inhibitor have been shown to decrease coronary events and mortality. Flavonoids are polyphenolic natural antioxidants occurring in natural products such as traditional Chinese herbs, fruits and beverages such as tea and wine. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of crude extracts from traditional Chinese herbs on HMG Co-A reductase. The methods for analysis of specific inhibitors of mevalonate biosynthesis have been well-established by using Vero cells, a cell line obtained from kidneys of African green monkeys. Crude extracts from different traditional Chinese herbs were dissolved in 1% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated with Vero cells with or without the addition of 1 mM mevalonate or 5 mM sodium acetate for 24 hours in order to observe cell growth. Pravastatin, a specific HMG Co-A reductase inhibitor, was used as a positive control which inhibits Vero cells growth effectively and cell growth inhibition was reversible after 1 mM mevalonate. Among 100 traditional Chinese herbs used for the study, only two herbs: Curcuma zedoaria Roscoe and Poncirus trifoliata Raf. showed significant growth inhibition of Vero cells. This study shows that some crude extracts isolated from traditional medicinal herbs were effective HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors which might be developed into new hypocholesterolemic agents.", 
    "68": "The GREek Atorvastatin and Coronary-heart-disease Evaluation (GREACE) Study compared two standards (structured vs. usual care) of lipid lowering treatment in 1600 patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). Structured care aimed at achieving (with atorvastatin 10-80 mg) the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (2.6 mmol/l; 100 mg/dl) goal described in the NCEP ATP II and III guidelines for patients with CHD. Structured care was associated with a significant reduction in overall mortality and coronary events compared to usual care. In the present brief report we interpret the results of GREACE using the United Kingdom (UK) and European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) treatment goal for LDL-C in secondary CHD prevention (3.0 mmol/l; 115 mg/dl. The mean dose of atorvastatin decreased from 24 mg to 22 mg/day. More patients achieved the UK and EAS LDL-C target (95.6 vs. 95%) in the structured care arm of the trial; 90% of the patients achieved this target with 10 or 20 mg atorvastatin. These findings may have cost implications, especially if the LDL-C target for high-risk patients will fall below those described above.", 
    "69": "Discovery of the ileal apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT) permitted development of specific inhibitors of bile acid reabsorption, potentially a new class of cholesterol-lowering agents. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that combining the novel ASBT inhibitor, SC-435, with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, atorvastatin, would potentiate reductions in LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) and LDL apolipoprotein B (apoB). ApoB kinetic studies were performed in miniature pigs fed a typical human diet and treated with the combination of SC-435 (5 mg/kg/day) plus atorvastatin (3 mg/kg/day) (SC-435+A) or a placebo. SC-435+A decreased plasma total cholesterol by 23% and LDL-C by 40%. Multicompartmental analysis (SAAM II) demonstrated that LDL apoB significantly decreased by 35% due primarily to a 45% increase in the LDL apoB fractional catabolic rate (FCR). SC-435+A significantly decreased hepatic concentrations of free cholesterol and cholesteryl ester, and increased hepatic LDL receptor mRNA consequent to increased cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase expression and activity. In comparison, SC-435 (10 mg/kg/day) monotherapy decreased LDL apoB by 10% due entirely to an 18% increase in LDL apoB FCR, whereas atorvastatin monotherapy (3 mg/kg/day) decreased LDL apoB by 30% due primarily to a 22% reduction in LDL apoB production. We conclude that SC-435+A potentiates the reduction of LDL-C and LDL apoB due to complementary mechanisms of action.", 
    "70": "The HDL Atherosclerosis Treatment Study (HATS) demonstrated a clinical benefit in coronary artery disease patients with low HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) levels treated with simvastatin and niacin (S-N) or S-N plus antioxidants (S-N+A) compared with antioxidants alone or placebo. Angiographically documented stenosis regressed in the S-N group but progressed in all other groups. To assess the mechanism(s) responsible for these observations, surrogate markers of cholesterol absorption and synthesis were measured in a subset of 123 HATS participants at 24 months (on treatment) and at 38 months (off treatment). Treatment with S-N reduced desmosterol and lathosterol levels (cholesterol synthesis indicators) 46% and 36% (P < 0.05), respectively, and elevated campesterol and beta-sitosterol levels (cholesterol absorption indicators) 70% and 59% (P < 0.05), respectively, relative to placebo and antioxidant but not S-N+A. Treatment with antioxidants alone had no significant effect. Combining S-N with antioxidants reduced desmosterol and lathosterol by 37% and 31%, and elevated campesterol and beta-sitosterol levels by 54% and 46%, but differences did not attain significance. Mean change in percent stenosis was positively associated with a percent change in lathosterol (r = 0.26, P < 0.005) and negatively associated with a percent change in beta-sitosterol (r = -0.21, P < 0.01). These data suggest that changes in stenosis were attributable, in part, to changes in cholesterol metabolism.", 
    "71": "Subclinical hypothyroidism can be diagnosed in 1% to 10% of the adult population, is more common in women, and increases with age. In many patients, treatment with L-thyroxine reduces low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, improves cardiac function, reduces symptoms of hypothyroidism, and diminishes neuropsychiatric symptoms. Treatment also reduces the likelihood of statin-induced myopathy. However, in double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of L-thyroxine therapy in subclinical hypothyroidism, cardiovascular and symptomatic benefits have been neither uniform nor definitive. In the absence of a large-scale, multicenter, randomized trial, physicians have to individualize therapy for each patient. Benefits of therapy are most likely to be realized in patients with thyroid-stimulating hormone levels greater than 10 mU/L on repeated measures, those with hypothyroid symptoms, those who are pregnant, those with a documented family history of hypothyroidism, and those with severe hyperlipidemia.", 
    "72": "This review examines the use of statin medications early in the clinical course of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Available data demonstrate that there are clear clinical benefits to this practice. Numerous previous studies have documented the primary and secondary benefits of statins in the prevention of coronary events. Recent trials show that when statins are used during hospital admissions for ACS, patients experience decreased recurrent myocardial infarction, lower death rates, and fewer repeat hospitalizations for ischemia or revascularization. Several studies suggest that the positive effects of statins on plaque stabilization, inflammation, thrombosis, and endothelial function may be independent of lipid levels. There is also an emerging view that beneficial lipid-lowering with statins in high-risk patients has no lower limit. This information suggests that all patients admitted for ACS should be treated with statins, regardless of cholesterol levels.", 
    "73": "Statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are an important component of our armamentarium for stroke prevention. Both of these classes of agents have a primary mechanism of action of reducing the level of the respective risk factor. They also have mechanisms of action that may confer benefits beyond what is believed to be the primary action of the agent. This has led to speculation that statins reduce stroke risk by means beyond cholesterol lowering, and ACE inhibitors reduce stroke risk by means beyond blood pressure lowering. We review the mounting evidence that suggests that statins and ACE inhibitors have so-called pleiotropic effects that may lead to stroke prevention.", 
    "74": "The ability of statins to lower serum cholesterol and reduce coronary heart disease endpoints has confirmed portions of the lipid hypothesis. However, the time to benefit and increased benefit in overlapping populations have suggested that nonlipid or pleiotropic effects of statins may be present. The apparent benefit of statins in cerebrovascular disease may imply a similar final common pathway among the diverse mechanisms of vascular diseases. Statins' inhibition of isoprenoid intermediates may modify GTP binding proteins such as Rho. The augmentation of collateral blood flow downstream of activated plaque through endothelial cell nitric oxide synthase may be the biochemical basis of statins' vascular pleiotropy. Eventual clinical paradigms of statin use may include higher doses to enhance pleiotropic effects and treatment, even when lipid markers are within guidelines.", 
    "75": "The complexity of medical care has led to a dramatic increase in the number of drugs taken by patients. In an effort to improve patient compliance and the effectiveness of clinical care, many drugs are being studied for combination in a single capsule or tablet. The recent success of many combination drugs for hypertension has accelerated the interest in combination drugs for lipids and atherosclerosis. Advicor (Kos Pharmaceuticals, Miami, FL), a combination of nicotinic acid and a statin (mevacor), is the first combination lipid drug. Recently, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved the combination of another statin, pravachol, with aspirin. Therefore, combination drugs are likely to be a significant contribution to clinical practice and drug development.", 
    "76": "Inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3methylglutaryl-co-enzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, so-called statins, are used in medical practice because of their lipid-lowering effect and to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease. Recent findings indicate that statins also have anti-inflammatory properties and can modulate the immune response. In vitro, we investigated the effect of atorvastatin on the T cell/macrophage system in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and in the human monocytic cell lines THP-1 and MonoMac6. We monitored neopterin production and tryptophan degradation in PBMC after treatment with 10 micro m and 100 micro m atorvastatin in the presence or absence of 100 U/ml IFN-gamma, 10 micro g/ml phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) or 10 micro g/ml concanavalin A (ConA) and in monocytic cell lines THP-1 and MonoMac6 with or without stimulation with 100 U/ml IFN-gamma or 10 ng/ml to 1 micro g/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In stimulated PBMC 100 micro m atorvastatin inhibited neopterin formation and tryptophan degradation completely, whereas 10 micro m atorvastatin was only partially effective. Also in monocytic cell lines THP-1 and MonoMac6, atorvastatin was able to suppress IFN-gamma- and LPS-induced formation of neopterin and degradation of tryptophan. Our data from PBMC agree well with previous investigations that statins inhibit T cell activation within the cellular immune response. In addition we demonstrate that atorvastatin directly inhibits IFN-gamma-mediated pathways in monocytic cells, suggesting that both immunoreactivity of T cells and of monocyte-derived macrophages are down-regulated by this statin.", 
    "77": "A spectrophotometric method has been developed and applied to the determination of simvastatin and fluvastatin in human serum and in tablets. Simvastatine and fluvastatin were determined by measurement of their first derivative signals at 241.6, 245.9, 249.1 nm (for simvastatin) and 259.6 nm (for fluvastatin), respectively. Calibration curves were linear and the ranges of quantification were 12.0-28.0 micrograms.ml-1 for simvastatin and 10.0-28.0 micrograms.ml-1 for fluvastatin. The procedure was successfully applied to the determination of these compounds in pharmaceutical formulations as well as in human serum with a high percentage of recovery, good accuracy and precision, and without measurable interference by the excipients.", 
    "78": "In a study population, we compared the level of malondialdehyde-modified LDL (MDA-LDL) with the concentrations of lipid parameters in serum and found a strong correlation between MDA-LDL and apolipoprotein B (apo B) concentrations. Their interrelations had a turning point at an apo B concentration of 1,150 mg/l. In diabetic patients, the ratio of MDA-LDL/apo B increased at apo B concentrations above 1,150 mg/l. This ratio represents the extent of modification of apo B by MDA. In the control subjects, this ratio remained stable. When we divided the patients into medication groups (statins and insulin), we found that the 1,150 mg/l threshold disappeared. At apo B concentrations above 1,150 mg/l, the ratio of MDA-LDL/apo B in the statin group was as high as that in the non-drug group. In the insulin group, the means of MDA-LDL/apo B in all ranges of apo B levels decreased to an extent statistically indistinguishable from those of the control group. In conclusion, insulin therapy represses LDL oxidation even at apo B concentrations > 1,150 mg/l and should be noted for its anti-oxidation properties.", 
    "79": "Accumulation of beta amyloid (Abeta) in the brain is central to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Abeta can bind to membrane lipids and this binding may have detrimental effects on cell function. In this study, surface plasmon resonance technology was used to study Abeta binding to membranes. Abeta peptides bound to synthetic lipid mixtures and to an intact plasma membrane preparation isolated from vascular smooth muscle cells. Abeta peptides were also toxic to vascular smooth muscle cells. There was a good correlation between the toxic effect of Abeta peptides and their membrane binding. 'Ageing' the Abeta peptides by incubation for 5 days increased the proportion of oligomeric species, and also increased toxicity and the amount of binding to lipids. The toxicities of various Abeta analogs correlated with their lipid binding. Significantly, binding was influenced by the concentration of cholesterol in the lipid mixture. Reduction of cholesterol in vascular smooth muscle cells not only reduced the binding of Abeta to purified plasma membrane preparations but also reduced Abeta toxicity. The results support the view that Abeta toxicity is a direct consequence of binding to lipids in the membrane. Reduction of membrane cholesterol using cholesterol-lowering drugs may be of therapeutic benefit because it reduces Abeta-membrane binding.", 
    "80": "Atherosclerosis is characterized by a low-grade systemic inflammatory response and endothelial dysfunction. The aim of the present study was to investigate a possible relationship between systemic markers of inflammation, serum markers of endothelial activation and endothelium-dependent vasodilatation in a group of high-risk patients, and to evaluate the effects of intervention with high doses of simvastatin on these parameters. In patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia, without atherosclerotic events, flow-mediated vasodilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery was measured after a wash-out period for lipid-lowering drugs (baseline) and after 6 weeks of treatment with simvastatin 80 mg daily. Levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), soluble intercellular cell-adhesion molecule (s-ICAM) and soluble E-selectin (s-E-selectin) were determined at baseline and again after 6 weeks and 12 months of therapy. A total of 35 subjects participated in the study (mean age 42 years; 60% male). When divided into tertiles according to FMD (<3.9%, 3.9-9.0% and >9.0%), no differences in levels of CRP, s-ICAM-1 and/or s-E-selectin were detected between the groups. Moreover, no changes in FMD, levels of CRP or levels of s-ICAM-1 and/or s-E-selectin were found during treatment with simvastatin. We conclude that endothelial function, as reflected by FMD, does not seem to be related to markers of inflammation in familial hypercholesterolaemia subjects at high risk of, but without clinically overt signs of, atherosclerosis. Moreover, aggressive lipid-lowering therapy with simvastatin does not result in improved endothelial function or in a reduction of markers of inflammation in these patients.", 
    "81": "Dyslipidaemia is more frequent in solid organ transplant recipients than in the general population, primarily as a result of immunosuppressive drug treatment. Both cyclosporin and corticosteroids are associated with dyslipidaemic adverse effects. In order to reduce the overall cardiovascular risk in these patients, lipid-lowering drugs have become widely used, especially HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). Cyclosporin, as well as most statins (lovastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin and pravastatin) are metabolised by cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4, so a bilateral pharmacokinetic interaction between these drugs is theoretically possible. However, results from several studies show that statins do not induce increased systemic exposure of cyclosporin. A small (but not clinically relevant) reduction in systemic exposure of cyclosporin has actually been shown in many studies. Cyclosporin-treated patients on the other hand show several-fold higher systemic exposure of all statins, both those that are metabolised by CYP3A4 and fluvastatin (metabolised by CYP2C9). Therefore, the mechanism for this interaction does not seem to be solely caused by inhibition of CYP3A4 metabolism, but it is probably also a result of inhibition of statin-transport in the liver, at least in part. Other lipid-lowering drugs, such as fibric acid derivatives, bile acid sequestrants, probucol, fish oils and orlistat are also used in solid organ transplant recipients. Most of them do not interact with cyclosporin, but there are reports indicating that both probucol and orlistat may reduce cyclosporin bioavailablility to a clinically relevant degree. There is no information on possible interaction effects of cyclosporin on the pharmacokinetics of lipid-lowering drugs other than statins, but it is not likely that any clinical relevant interference exists with fish oil, orlistat, probucol or bile acid sequestrants.", 
    "82": "In the context of the growing complexity of atherosclerosis, LDL-cholesterol has been gradually revealed to be the main aetiological agent. However, the first clinical trials were not convincing, as they failed to demonstrate a significant improvement of coronary mortality. So-called \"regression\" trials revealed the need to develop clinical trials in which the primary endpoint is coronary events and no longer intermediate criteria such as the course of coronary disease on coronary angiography. Lovastatin, simvastatin and pravastatin were shown to be effective in the prevention of relapses in coronary patients and in the prevention of coronary events in healthy subjects. In 1999, the prescription for coronary patients should almost always include a statin and the prescription in healthy subjects should include a statin when this subject presents a high risk of coronary events in the years to come.", 
    "83": "A simple, sensitive and selective liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC/ESI/MS) method for the determination of simvastatin (I) has been developed. After extraction by ethyl acetate, using lovastatin (II) as internal standard, solutes are separated on a C(18) column with a mobile phase consisting of methanol-water (9:1). Detection is performed on an atmospheric pressure ionization single quadruple mass spectrometer equipped with an ESI interface and operates in positive ionization mode. Simvastatin quantification was realized by computing peak area ratio (I/II) of the extracts analyzed in SIM mode (m/z: 441 and m/z: 427 for I and II, respectively) and comparing them with calibration curve (r=0.9997). Accuracy and precision for the assay were determined by calculating the intra-batch and inter-batch variation at three concentrations 0.1, 5.0, 10.0 ng/ml; the intra batch relative standard deviation (RSD) was less than 10% and ranged from 1.8 to 8.5%, respectively; the inter-batch RSD was less than 20% and ranged from 4.1 to 16.5%. The limit of detection was 0.05 ng/ml.", 
    "84": "Grapefruit juice is responsible for many drug interactions but the exact components involved in this interaction are not precisely known. Flavonoids and furocoumarin derivatives such as naringenin and bergamottin, respectively, could be involved in the inhibition of drug metabolism. The objective of this paper is to investigate in vitro the possible metabolic hepatic interaction between simvastatin (SV) and bergamottin (BG) and thus to compare its effects to those of naringenin (NRG) the aglycone form of naringin (NR) (a flavonoid present in grapefruit juice). In human and rat microsomes and in rat hepatocytes, BG was found to be a mixed type inhibitor of SV metabolism. In rat liver microsomes the K(i) value of BG (K(i)=174+/-36 microM) is higher than the K(i) value of NRG (K(i)=29+/-11 microM). However, in human liver microsomes the K(i) values are similar in BG and NRG (K(i)=34+/-5 microM and 29+/-11 microM, respectively). Moreover, it seems that there is an interspecies difference between human and rat hepatic metabolism of SV involving different isoenzymes of CYP 450. In conclusion, our study shows that BG inhibits SV metabolism. BG and NRG could therefore be applied as markers in food-drug interaction studies in order to adjust posology.",

For hospitals without the capacity to perform emergent percutaneous coronary intervention, fibrinolytic therapy plays a critical role although it is limited by a 67% success rate. Despite promising pilot studies, reduced-dose fibrinolytic therapy with glycoprotein IIb/IIIa therapy (GUSTO-V) and full-dose fibrinolytic therapy with enoxaparin (ASSENT-3) or bivalirudin (HERO-2) provide only marginally improved clinical outcomes. Adjunctive in-hospital and secondary preventive measures should include an aspirin, a beta-blocker, an ACE inhibitor, and a statin, based on the Heart Protection Study, unless contraindicated. Patients should be risk stratified, participate in a cardiac rehabilitation program, cease smoking tobacco, and have an intracardiac defibrillator (ICD) implanted if their LV systolic function is < or = 30% at one month based on the MADIT-2 trial.",

The main outcome measures were: serum CRP, physical activity as measured by Stanford 7-day activity recall, body fat (both total and regional) as measured by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), and anthropometry (waist and hip circumference). Secondary outcome measures included fasting plasma glucose and insulin as well as fasting serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Higher physical activity energy expenditures were significantly associated with lower serum CRP levels (r = -0.18, P = 0.041), independent of oral HRT use, age, smoking behavior, alcohol consumption, aspirin use, and statin use. However, in the complete multivariate model, which included body fat, older ages (P = 0.047), greater trunk fat masses (P < 0.001), any oral HRT use (P < 0.001), and unopposed oral estrogen use (P = 0.012) were the sole independent predictors of higher serum CRP levels. The complete multivariate model accounted for 58% of the variance in serum CRP. We conclude that the association between higher physical activity and lower serum CRP levels is dependent on the lower body fat of the more active women, yet independent of oral HRT use. Future intervention trials should determine whether diet- and exercise-related reductions in body fat may be effective ways to diminish the proinflammatory effects of oral HRT in postmenopausal women.", 
    "87": "Moderate alcohol intake has been associated with lower cardiovascular mortality. However, data evaluating the relationship between C-reactive protein (CRP), a predictor of cardiovascular risk, and alcohol consumption are sparse.", 
    "88": "The relationship between alcohol consumption and CRP was evaluated in a cross-sectional survey and over time among 1732 men and 1101 women participating in the Pravastatin Inflammation/CRP Evaluation Study. CRP levels were lower in those with moderate alcohol intake versus light or occasional intake: in 5 categories of alcohol intake (no alcohol or <1 drink monthly, 1 to 3 drinks monthly, 1 to 4 drinks weekly, 5 to 7 drinks weekly, and > or =2 drinks daily), median CRP levels were 2.60 mg/L (interquartile range (IQR), 1.20 to 5.30 mg/L), 2.20 mg/L (IQR, 1.00 to 4.40 mg/L), 1.70 mg/L (IQR, 0.80 to 3.80 mg/L), 1.60 mg/L (IQR, 0.80 to 3.30 mg/L), and 1.80 mg/L (IQR, 0.80 to 2.90 mg/L), respectively. This relationship was present among men, women not taking hormone replacement therapy, nonsmokers, and those individuals with and without a history of cardiovascular disease (all P<0.001). In multivariate analysis, the relationship between alcohol consumption and CRP remained significant after controlling for multiple traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Alcohol consumption did not significantly affect the change in CRP or lipid levels associated with statin use.", 
    "89": "Moderate alcohol consumption was associated with lower CRP concentrations than no or occasional alcohol intake, an effect that was independent of alcohol-related effects on lipids. Alcohol may attenuate cardiovascular mortality in part through an anti-inflammatory mechanism.", 
    "90": "Endothelial dysfunction is an important feature of atherosclerosis. Inhibition of the HMG-CoA pathway and of calcium channels improves endothelial function experimentally and in the forearm circulation. Thus, we investigated the effects of a statin and/or a calcium antagonist on coronary endothelial function in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).", 
    "91": "In 343 patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention in 29 centers, acetylcholine (10(-6) to 10(-4) mol/L) was infused in a coronary segment without angiographically significant CAD. Changes in coronary diameter were measured by quantitative angiography. Endothelium-independent responses were assessed by intracoronary adenosine (1.2 mg/mL) and nitroglycerin (250 microg). Thereafter, patients were randomized in a double-blind manner to placebo, cerivastatin 0.4 mg/d, nifedipine 30 to 60 mg/d, or their combination. Studies were repeated at 6 months. In the most constricted segment, nifedipine but not cerivastatin reduced vasoconstriction to acetylcholine (18.8% versus placebo 10.0%; P<0.05). Patients not taking ACE inhibitors showed a smaller improvement in the placebo group (6.0%), but nifedipine still had an effect (17.0%; P<0.05 versus placebo). Analysis of all evaluable coronary segments revealed an 11% reduction of acetylcholine-induced vasoconstriction in patients receiving nifedipine and cerivastatin (P<0.05 versus placebo). Cerivastatin lowered LDL cholesterol by 35% (P<0.001).", 
    "92": "The ENCORE I trial demonstrates that multicenter studies on coronary endothelial function are feasible. After 6 months' treatment, nifedipine improved coronary endothelial function in the most constricted segment. The combination of nifedipine and cerivastatin tended to improve endothelial function; however, this only reached significance in an analysis of all coronary segments.", 
    "93": "The increased incidence and prevalence of coronary heart disease among older women, coupled with the less favorable prognosis for women who sustain coronary events than for men, has resulted in the medical community's attention to the potential beneficial effects of hormone therapy in menopausal women. Much biological evidence supports a protective mechanism of estrogen; nevertheless, some aspects are contradictory. Although observational studies have shown a clear cardiovascular benefit associated with hormone therapy, the significant skew inherent in these data has resulted in overestimation of benefits and underestimation of risks. Recent reanalysis of these observational data controlling for confounding variables failed to show cardiovascular benefit. Several randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies have failed to show improvement in clinical cardiovascular outcomes with menopausal hormone therapy both in healthy women and in women with established coronary heart disease. Current research has also focused on pharmacologic agents that selectively modulate estrogen receptors, such as raloxifene, which are useful for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis without increasing the risk of breast cancer. A clinical trial is now underway to evaluate the effects of raloxifene on coronary events and on the incidence of invasive breast cancer in menopausal women both with established coronary heart disease and at increased risk for coronary events. Current recommendations do not advocate the initiation of menopausal hormone therapy for the primary or secondary prevention of coronary events. The proven lifestyle interventions of smoking cessation, heart healthy diet, weight control, and physical activity should be undertaken, with statin use for control of elevated LDL cholesterol levels and pharmacologic blood pressure control when appropriate.", 
    "94": "Because of their excellent tolerability and their positive impact on lipid parameters, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) have become the drugs of first choice for many patients with dyslipidemia. Rosuvastatin is an investigational statin in the U.S. with a number of favorable characteristics, which include low lipophilicity, high hepatocyte selectivity, minimal metabolism, and a low propensity for cytochrome P450 drug interactions. Rosuvastatin has been studied at doses ranging from 1 to 80 mg. In comparative clinical trials, rosuvastatin given at 5 to 10 mg/day reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to a significantly greater extent than atorvastatin 10 mg/day, pravastatin 20 mg/day, and simvastatin 20 mg/day. In addition, rosuvastatin exhibited beneficial effects on other lipid parameters such as high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides. Rosuvastatin's safety profile was demonstrated to be similar to those of other statins. Given its favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics, rosuvastatin is likely to become a valuable addition to the statin drug class. The author reviews the pharmacologic and pharmacokinetic properties of this new statin.", 
    "95": "Inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of coronary heart disease and elevated serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) are independently associated with increased coronary risk. This study assessed whether there were differences in the effects on CRP and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels among patients treated with three common statins. In a prospective, observational study, 80 dyslipidemic adults without evidence of cardiovascular disease were treated with 10 mg atorvastatin (A), 20 mg simvastatin (S), or 40 mg pravastatin (P) daily. CRP and lipid profiles were assayed before and after 12 weeks of therapy; in 21 patients, CRP levels were also measured after 1 and 4 weeks. The three treatment groups experienced comparable reductions in CRP (A: 33%, S: 42%, and P: 30%) and statistically insignificant changes in HDL cholesterol levels. CRP began to decrease after 1 week of treatment, and decreased further at 4 and 12 weeks of therapy. The change in the log-transformed CRP concentration correlated with the change in the log-transformed LDL cholesterol concentration. Subjects had similar baseline CRP levels, lipid profiles, and coronary risk factors. The authors conclude that at doses achieving similar reductions in LDL cholesterol, the three statins were associated with comparable decreases in CRP without significant changes in HDL cholesterol levels. The correlation between the reductions in CRP and LDL cholesterol differs from the findings of other published studies, and should prompt further investigation of the mechanism by which statins reduce CRP.",

    "97": "Literature was obtained from MEDLINE (1984-September 2002) and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-June 2002). Key search terms included statin, neuropathy, and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor.", 
    "98": "Epidemiologic studies and case reports suggest an increased risk of peripheral neuropathy with statin drugs. Most patients were receiving long-term therapy, although the onset was highly variable. The majority of cases were at least partially reversible with drug cessation. Specific risk factors or mechanisms have not been identified.", 
    "99": "Observational data suggest a link between chronic statin use and increased risk of peripheral neuropathy. However, the risk appears to be small relative to the significant cardioprotective benefits.", 
    "100": "The authors describe a rapid, useful, specific, and very sensitive high-performance liquid chromatographic assay for the determination of fluvastatin (FV) level using atorvastatin as the internal standard (IS). After a simple deproteinization of 1.0 mL of plasma with acetonitrile, the drug and IS were extracted with tert-methyl butyl ether (TMBE). An efficient separation was performed using an 8 mm x 10 cm Nova Pak C(18) 4-microm particle size radial compression cartridge. The mobile phase consisted of an aqueous solution containing 20 mmol/L dibasic sodium dihydrogen phosphate with 1 mmol/L sodium lauryl sulfate adjusted to pH 7 with phosphoric acid and acetonitrile (70:30 v/v) delivered at a flow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The compounds of interest were detected using a fluorescence detector with the excitation wavelength set at 305 nm and the emission at 380 nm. Under these conditions, the retention times for FV and IS were 8.8 and 10.6 minutes, respectively. The concentration of FV in plasma was linear (r > 0.999) for the wide range that was examined (0.5-1,000 ng/mL). The recovery ranged from 88% to 96%. This sensitive, rapid, and simple analytical method gives accurate results over the wide range of concentrations examined. This method is used currently for clinical therapeutic monitoring and pharmacokinetic studies of FV in patients with hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "101": "We studied the effect of atorvastatin on the adhesive phenotype of human endothelial cells (HUVEC) stimulated by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Surface expression of adhesion molecules on HUVEC was examined by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy, and adhesion of monocytes (human THP-1 cell line) was measured in vitro under flow conditions. In TNF-alpha-activated HUVEC, atorvastatin significantly enhanced surface expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, E-selectin, and fractalkine, when compared with TNF-alpha stimulation alone. This enhancement was reversed by mevalonate or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) and was mimicked by an inhibitor of geranylgeranylation. The enhancing effect of atorvastatin was restricted to TNF-alpha-inducible adhesion molecule and was the reflect of an increased protein synthesis (mRNA and protein) and not of a reduced shedding. Confocal microscopy examination showed that atorvastatin also altered the surface distribution of adhesion molecules. Adhesion of human THP-1 cells on TNF-alpha-activated HUVEC was significantly reduced by atorvastatin (-42% at 1 microM). Mevalonate or GGPP restored the TNF-alpha-induced adhesive potential. These results show that atorvastatin, by inhibiting prenylation of G proteins, enhances the TNF-alpha-induced expression of adhesion molecules at the endothelial cell surface and also alters their surface distribution which may account for the reduced binding of monocytes.", 
    "102": "Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and monomethylarginine (LMMA) are endogenous inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase. A high level of ADMA in plasma has shown to be a significant risk factor for acute coronary syndromes and elevated plasma ADMA levels are prevalent in patients with hypercholesterolemia. It was therefore hypothesized that lowering plasma cholesterol levels with statin treatment would also lower ADMA concentrations. This double-blind study addressed the effect of high-dose statin treatment on plasma levels of ADMA and LMMA. Forty-eight subjects with mild hypercholesterolemia were randomly assigned to receive simvastatin 80 mg/d, atorvastatin 40 mg/d, or placebo for 8 weeks. Both statins decreased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol effectively (simvastatin 54% and atorvastatin 49%). However, concentrations of arginine derivatives remained unchanged during statin treatment and did not correlate with cholesterol levels. This study indicates that statin treatment has no clear influence on plasma ADMA or LMMA concentrations.", 
    "103": "Hepatic lipase (HL) is involved in the metabolism of several lipoproteins and may contribute to the atherogenic lipid profile in type 2 diabetes. Little is known about the effect of cholesterol synthesis inhibitors on HL activity in relation to sex and the hepatic lipase gene, the LIPC promoter variant in type 2 diabetes. Therefore, we studied the effect of atorvastatin 10 mg (A10) and 80 mg (A80) on HL activity in 198 patients with type 2 diabetes.", 
    "104": "Patients (aged 45-75 years, without manifest coronary artery disease, total cholesterol 4.0-8.0 mmol/l, and fasting triglycerides [TG] 1.5-6.0 mmol/l) were included in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial for 30 weeks (Diabetes Atorvastatin Lipid Intervention study).", 
    "105": "HL activity at baseline was significantly higher in our population compared with an age-matched control group without type 2 diabetes (406 +/- 150 vs. 357 +/- 118 units/l). HL activity in men versus women (443 +/- 158 vs. 358 +/- 127 units/l), in carriers of the LIPC C/C allele versus carriers of the T/T allele (444 +/- 142 vs. 227 +/- 96 units/l), and in Caucasians versus blacks (415 +/- 150 vs. 260 +/- 127 units/l) all differed significantly (P < 0.001). Atorvastatin dose-dependently decreased HL (A10, -11%; A80, -22%; both P < 0.001). Neither sex nor the LIPC C-->T variation influenced the effect of atorvastatin on HL activity.", 
    "106": "Sex, LIPC promoter variant, and ethnicity significantly contribute to the baseline variance in HL activity. Atorvastatin treatment in diabetic dyslipidemia results in a significant dose-dependent decrease in HL activity, regardless of sex or the LIPC promoter variant.", 
    "107": "Studies in animals and humans indicate a pivotal role for adhesion molecules (AMs) in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Whereas an association between hypercholesterolaemia and AM expression has been suggested, it is unclear whether lowering cholesterol decreases AM expression and release. We compared the effects of a 3-month treatment with standard doses of three different statins (atorvastatin, simvastatin and pravastatin) on plasma levels of circulating AM (cAM) in 75 hypercholesterolaemic patients in a randomized clinical trial. Plasma levels of circulating (c)E-selectin, circulating intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (cICAM-1) and circulating vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (cVCAM-1) were measured before and after 3 months of therapy. None of the statins lowered plasma cAM levels and pooled analyses of all patients showed a 1.7% [95% confidence interval (CI), -1.4-4.9%] increase in cE-selectin, a 2.1% (95% CI, -0.2-4.4%) increase in cICAM-1, and a 2.7% (95% CI, -0.6-6.1%) increase in cVCAM-1 levels. cAM levels did not decrease, even in patients with a >50% decrease ( n =19) in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. This study provides strong evidence that 3 months of therapy with three different statins does not decrease cAM levels, despite normalization of cholesterol levels, and a minor decrease in C-reactive protein levels in patients with moderate hypercholesterolaemia.", 
    "108": "The National Cholesterol Education Program recognizes the importance of the metabolic syndrome and has published guidelines for its diagnosis. Weight loss, physical activity, and treatment of the individual risk factors constitute the main strategies for treatment. For now, the goals and methods of treating hypertension and dyslipidemia are the same in people with the metabolic syndrome as in the general population. Thiazolidinedione drugs increase insulin sensitivity, but their use in the metabolic syndrome is only speculative at present. We recommend they be used only as indicated to treat diabetes mellitus.", 
    "109": "gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA), a hypotensive agent, and monacolin K, a cholesterol-lowering drug, can be produced by Monascus spp. Under optimal culture conditions, the products of fermentation using Monascus spp. may serve as a multi-functional dietary supplement and can prevent heart disease. In this study, Monascus purpureus CCRC 31615, the strain with the highest amount of monacolin K, was identified from 16 strains using solid fermentation. Its GABA productivity was particularly high. Addition of sodium nitrate during solid-state fermentation of M. purpureus CCRC 31615 improved the productivity of monacolin K and GABA to 378 mg/kg and 1,267.6 mg/kg, respectively. GABA productivity increased further to 1,493.6 mg/kg when dipotassium hydrophosphate was added to the medium.", 
    "110": "Thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) is a glycoprotein, linking coagulation and fibrinolysis. Recently, attention has been drawn to the beneficial effects of statins on haemostasis in kidney patients prone to dyslipidaemia and with a high risk of cardiovascular death. The purpose of this study was to assess whether fluvastatin affects TAFI concentration in renal transplant recipients. We evaluated thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complexes, prothrombin fragments 1+2, thrombomodulin, plasmin-antiplasmin (PAP) complexes, TAFI, P-selectin, and lipoprotein (a), 1, 2, and 3 months before and after fluvastatin treatment and in normolipaemic kidney transplant recipients and healthy volunteers. Cholesterol and LDL fell significantly as soon as 1 month after treatment had begun and remained lowered during the therapy. TAFI and prothrombin fragments 1+2 decreased significantly after 3 months of fluvastatin administration, whereas P-selectin decreased significantly after 2 months and remained significantly lower after 3 months of this therapy. We can conclude that fluvastatin is an effective hypolipaemic agent that favourably affects haemostasis."
