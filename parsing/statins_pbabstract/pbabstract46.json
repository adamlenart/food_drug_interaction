    "1": "A retrospective cohort study was conducted of 985 endometrial cancer cases treated from January 1999 through December 2009 at a single institution. Disease-specific survival was estimated by Kaplan-Meier analyses. A Cox proportional hazards model was used to study factors associated with survival. All statistical tests were two-sided and performed using Stata.", 
    "2": "At the time of analysis, 230 patients (22% of evaluable patients) died of disease and median follow-up was 3.28 years. Disease-specific survival was greater (179/220 [81%]) for women with endometrial cancer taking statin therapy at the time of diagnosis and staging compared with women not using statins (423/570 [74%]) (log rank test, P=.03). This association persisted for the subgroup of patients with nonendometrioid endometrial tumors who were statin users (59/87 [68%]) compared with nonusers (93/193 [43%]) (log rank test, P=.02). The relationship remained significant (hazard ratio 0.63, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.40-0.99) after adjusting for age, clinical stage, radiation, and other factors. Further evaluation of polypharmacy showed an association between concurrent statin and aspirin use with an especially low disease-specific mortality (hazard ratio 0.25, 95% CI 0.09-0.70) relative to those who used neither.", 
    "3": "Statin and aspirin use was associated with improved survival from nonendometrioid endometrial cancer.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential therapeutic value of simvastatin (SmSt) in cigarette smoke\u2011induced emphysema in rats. A total of 24 male and female Wistar rats were randomly divided into four groups. The levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the lung tissues and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of each group were measured using an enzyme\u2011linked immunoassay. The mRNA expression of VEGF was assessed using reverse transcription\u2011quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The protein expression levels of VEGF and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) were determined using immunohistochemical assays. Histological scoring revealed that simvastatin reduced the total inflammatory scores significantly more in the simvastatin\u2011treated smoke\u2011exposed group, compared with the smoke exposed (Sm) group. Significant differences in the average inter\u2011alveolar septal wall distance and mean alveolar numbers were also observed between the SmSt and Sm groups. The levels of VEGF in the BAL fluid and lung tissue homogenates of the SmSt group were similar to those in the simvostatin\u2011only (St) and control (CtL) groups, and significantly higher compared with those in the Sm group. The expression of VEGF in the alveolar and bronchial epithelial cells of the SmSt group was similar to that in the CtL group, and significantly higher compared with that of the Sm group. The percentage of PCNA\u2011positive alveolar epithelial cells was significantly higher in the SmSt group compared with the Sm and CtL groups. Simvastatin exerted a significant impact on the expression of VEGF and attenuated cigarette smoke\u2011induced emphysema in rats. Therefore simvastatin may have beneficial effects in patients with COPD.", 
    "5": "Human organic anion transporter 7 (OAT7, SLC22A9) is a hepatic transport protein poorly characterized so far. We therefore sought to identify novel OAT7 substrates and factors contributing to variable hepatic OAT7 expression. Using OAT7-expressing cells, pravastatin was identified as a substrate. Hepatic SLC22A9/OAT7 mRNA and protein expression varied 28-fold and 15-fold, respectively, in 126 Caucasian liver samples. Twenty-four variants in SLC22A9 were genotyped, including three rare missense variants (rs377211288, rs61742518, rs146027075), which occurred only heterozygously. No variant significantly affected hepatic SLC22A9/OAT7 expression. The three missense variants, however, showed functional consequences when expressed in vitro. Hepatic nuclear factor 4-alpha (HNF4\u03b1) emerged as a major transcriptional regulator of SLC22A9 by a series of in silico and in vitro analyses. In conclusion, pravastatin is the first identified OAT7 drug substrate. Substantial inter-individual variability in hepatic OAT7 expression, majorly driven by HNF4\u03b1, may contribute to pravastatin drug disposition and might affect response.The Pharmacogenomics Journal advance online publication, 4 August 2015; doi:10.1038/tpj.2015.55.", 
    "6": "Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory response of the arterial wall to pro\u2011atherosclerotic factors. As an inflammatory marker, fibrinogen directly participates in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Our previous study demonstrated that fibrinogen and fibrin degradation products (FDP) produce a pro\u2011inflammatory effect on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) through inducing the production of interleukin\u20116 (IL\u20116), tumor necrosis factor\u2011\u03b1 (TNF\u2011\u03b1) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). In the present study, the effects of pravastatin on fibrinogen\u2011 and FDP\u2011induced expression of IL\u20116, TNF\u2011\u03b1 and iNOS were observed in VSMCs. The results showed that pravastatin dose\u2011dependently inhibited fibrinogen\u2011 and FDP\u2011stimulated expression of IL\u20116, TNF\u2011\u03b1 and iNOS in VSMCs at the mRNA and protein level. The maximal inhibition of protein expression of IL\u20116, TNF\u2011\u03b1 and iNOS was 46.9, 42.7 and 49.2% in fibrinogen\u2011stimulated VSMCs, and 50.2, 49.8 and 53.6% in FDP\u2011stimulated VSMCs, respectively. This suggests that pravastatin has the ability to relieve vascular inflammation via inhibiting the generation of IL\u20116, TNF\u2011\u03b1 and iNOS. The results of the present study may aid in further explaining the beneficial effects of pravastatin on atherosclerosis and related cardiovascular diseases. In addition, they suggest that application of pravastatin may be beneficial for prevention of atherosclerosis formation in hyperfibrinogenemia.", 
    "7": "Growing evidence supports the idea that de novo steroidogenesis has an important role in prostate cancer's progression to the castration-resistant state following androgen deprivation therapy. Therefore, reducing the availability of cholesterol for use as a precursor in androgen synthesis may reduce proliferation and disease progression.", 
    "8": "LNCaP xenograft-bearing mice were castrated and administered simvastatin via diet, and tumor volume and PSA concentration were monitored for 8 weeks post castration. Levels of serum and intratumoral androgens along with serum simvastatin and common toxicity markers were measured at end point.", 
    "9": "Reduced post-castration tumor growth rate in simvastatin-treated mice correlated with delayed time to castration-resistant progression, determined by two serum PSA doublings from post-castration nadir, when compared with xenografts in mice on control diet. At 8 weeks post castration, serum simvastatin levels were comparable to clinically relevant human doses with no evidence of overt muscle or liver toxicity. This suppressed post-castration tumor growth in the simvastatin diet group was correlated with reduced intratumoral testosterone and dihydrotestosterone levels.", 
    "10": "Reduced tumor growth and intratumoral androgen levels observed in simvastatin-treated, castrated mice harboring LNCaP xenograft suggests that suppressing de novo steroidogenesis can delay castration-resistant progression of this tumor model.", 
    "11": "A 62-year-old woman treated with fluvastatin experienced three separate thrombocytopenic illnesses, severe on two occasions associated with nadir platelet count of 57 000/\u00b5L\u00a0and 75 000/\u00b5L. The hospital pharmacist replaced\u00a0fluvastatin by pravastatin during three stays. Platelet count has increased some days after this substitution. These results suggest that fluvastatin could be involved in these thrombocytopenic episodes.", 
    "12": "The aim of this study is to evaluate the biological effects of Calu-3 epithelial cells in response to the delivery of simvastatin (SV) via solution pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI).", 
    "13": "SV pMDI was aerosolised onto Calu-3 air-interface epithelial cells using a modified glass twin stage impinger. The transport of SV across Calu-3 cells, mucus production, inflammatory cytokines production i.e., interleukin (IL) 6, 8 and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF- \u03b1) and oxidative stress from Calu-3 cells following treatment with SV pMDI was investigated and compared to untreated cells.", 
    "14": "It was found that SV had the ability to penetrate into the respiratory epithelium and convert into its active SV hydroxy acid (SVA) metabolite. Furthermore, the amount of mucus produced was significantly reduced when SV was deposited on Calu-3 compared to untreated cells. Additionally, SV delivered by pMDI reduces production of IL-6, 8 and TNF-\u03b1 from Calu-3 following stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). SV also showed equivalent antioxidant property to vitamin E.", 
    "15": "Treatment with SV solution pMDI formulation on Calu-3 cells reduces mucus production, inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress. This formulation could potentially be used clinically as muco-inhibitory and anti-inflammatory therapy for treatment of chronic lung diseases.", 
    "16": "Endogenous mechanisms leading to host protection and resolution of infections without immunosuppression are of wide interest. Here we elucidate the structures of four new host-protective molecules produced in neutrophil-endothelial cocultures and present in human and mouse tissues after sterile inflammation or infection. The bioactive molecules contain conjugated triene and diene double bonds, carry an alcohol at C13 and are derived from n-3 docosapentaenoic acid (DPA, C22:5). These compounds, termed 13-series resolvins (RvTs), demonstrated potent protective actions increasing mice survival during Escherichia coli infections. RvTs also regulated human and mouse phagocyte responses stimulating bacterial phagocytosis and regulating inflammasome components. Their biosynthesis during neutrophil-endothelial cell interactions was initiated by endothelial cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), increased by atorvastatin via S-nitrosylation of COX-2 and reduced by COX-2 inhibitors. The actions of atorvastatin and RvTs were additive in E. coli infections in mice, where they accelerated resolution of inflammation and increased survival >60%. Taken together, these results document host-protective molecules in bacterial infections, namely RvTs, derived from n-3 DPA via transcellular biosynthesis and increased by atorvastatin. These molecules regulate key innate protective responses in the resolution of infectious inflammation.", 
    "17": "The KIF6 719Arg allele is an interesting genomic variant widely screened in various populations and is reported to be associated with the risk of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) and statin treatment outcome. Recent population based clinical studies and large-scale meta-analyses pondered over the role of 719Arg variant in CAD risk and treatment response. We screened the KIF6 Trp719Arg polymorphism (rs20455) in south Indian CAD patients in a case-control approach. A total of 1042 samples (510 CAD patients and 532 controls) were screened for the KIF6 Trp719Arg SNP by TaqMan SNP genotyping assay, followed by meta-analysis of the genotype data of non-Europeans reports. The 719Arg risk genotype (GG) was observed in 29.6% of CAD cases and in 30.1% of controls with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.07 (95% CI: 0.76-1.50), p value\u00a0=\u00a00.709. No significant difference in the genotype frequency was observed between CAD and controls in both dominant model (AG\u00a0+\u00a0GG vs AA) and allelic model (719Arg vs 719Trp) with an OR of 1.11 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.491) and 1.03 (p\u00a0=\u00a00.767), respectively. The covariate analysis indicated that smoking & alcohol consumption increased the risk for MI among CAD patients. Meta-analysis showed that the KIF6 719Arg allele is not associated with CAD risk in both fixed effect (p\u00a0=\u00a00.515, OR\u00a0=\u00a01.023, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.956-1.094) and random effect (p\u00a0=\u00a00.547, OR\u00a0=\u00a01.022, 95% CI\u00a0=\u00a00.953-1.096). The symmetrical shape of the Egger's funnel plots revealed that there is no publication bias. These results suggest that there is no association of KIF6 719Arg allele with CAD risk in South Indian population and the meta-analysis confirms the same among non-European population.", 
    "18": "The objective of this study was to investigate the odontoblastic differentiation of dental pulp stem cells (DPSC) by biodegradable hydrogels incorporating simvastatin micelles, both in vitro and in vivo. Simvastatin (ST) was incorporated into the micelles of gelatin grafted with L-lactic acid oligomers (LAo) to allow water-solubilization. The simvastatin-LAo-grafted gelatin (LAo-g-gelatin) micelles were mixed with gelatin, followed by chemical crosslinking to form gelatin hydrogels (ST Mi/GH). The ST Mi were released from the gelatin hydrogel granules (GH) through enzymatic degradation. The ST Mi enhanced alkaline phosphatase activity, calcium deposition, and bone morphogenic protein-2 secretion of DPSC. When implanted subcutaneously into mice, the ST Mi/GH treated group exhibited increased dentin sialoprotein and calcium deposition, compared with those treated with GH plus free ST. It is possible to achieve odontoblastic differentiation of DPSC through the controlled release of ST from GH.",

    "20": "We reviewed the most recent literature on the safety of statins in patients with NAFLD and on their effects on liver histology and cardiovascular events.", 
    "21": "It appears that statins can be safely administered to patients with NAFLD, including those with elevated transaminase levels (<3 times the upper limit of normal). Post-hoc analyses of randomized controlled trials also suggest that statins might reduce cardiovascular morbidity in this population. On the other hand, there are few and controversial data on the effects of statins on liver histology in patients with NAFLD.",

    "23": "Elevated levels of cholesterol and its metabolites (oxysterols) have been reported to be associated not only with several metabolic syndromes, but also become a prognostic risk factor of neurodegenerative diseases particularly Alzheimer's disease. The incidence and the prospect of Alzheimer's disease with respect to elevated levels of cholesterol have been studied extensively and reviewed earlier. Recently, several interesting findings have shown the occurrence of equivalent Parkinsonian pathologies in cellular neuronal models, mediated by oxysterols or excess exposure to cholesterol. In this regard, oxysterols are particular in causing alpha-synuclein aggregation and destruction of dopamine containing neurons in in\u00a0vitro models, which is linked to their direct influence on oxidative stress provoking potency. Inspite of the significant in\u00a0vitro reports, which suggest the relativeness of cholesterol or oxysterol towards Parkinsonism, several prospective clinical reports provided a negative or no correlation. However, few prospective clinical studies showed a positive correlation between plasma cholesterol and incidence of Parkinson's disease (PD). Also, few significant studies have convincingly demonstrated that high fat diet exacerbates parkinsonian pathologies, including loss of dopaminergic neurons and oxidative stress parameters in animal models of PD. The present review brings together all the neuropathological proceedings mediated by excess cholesterol or its metabolites in brain in the light of their contribution towards the onset of PD. Also we have reviewed the possibilities of cholesterol lowering efficacy of statin therapy, in reducing the occurrence of PD.",

Fabry's disease (FD) is a devastating progressive inborn error of metabolism with lysosomal glycosphingolipid deposition in variety of cell types, capillary endothelial cells, renal, cardiac and nerve cells. Basic effect is absent or deficient activity of lysosomal exoglycohydrolase a-galactosidase A. Renal involvement consists of proteinuria, isosthenuria, altered tubular function, presenting in second or third decade leading to azotemia and end-stage renal disease in third to fifth decade mainly due to irreversible changes to glomerular, tubular and vascular structures, especially highlighted by podocytes foot process effacement. Cardiac involvement consists of left ventricular hypertrophy, right ventricular hypertrophy, arrhythmias (sinus node and conduction system impairment), diastolic dysfunction, myocardial ischemia, infarction, transmural replacement fibrosis, congestive heart failure and cardiac death. Management of FD is based on enzymatic replacement therapy and control of renal (with anti-proteinuric agents such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors-and/or angiotensin II receptor blockers), brain (coated aspirin, clopidogrel and statin to prevent strokes) and heart complications (calcium channel blockers for ischemic cardiomyopathy, warfarin and amiodarone or cardioverter device for arrhythmias).",

This entity carries a high risk of recurrent events and should be considered as a potential cause of spontaneous episodic vestibular syndrome. Diagnostic evaluation should include intracranial and extracranial imaging of the vertebral arteries and basilar artery. Aggressive medical management with antiplatelet therapy, statin use, and risk factor modification is the mainstay of treatment. This article highlights the importance of diagnosing, evaluating, and treating posterior circulation TIAs manifesting as dizziness or vertigo.",

Bibliographic databases were exhaustively searched for studies relevant to the research topic. Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) criteria, combined with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS), were applied for study quality assessment. Our meta-analysis identified seven cohort studies (2006~2013), providing information on the change in serum hs-CRP levels in AF patients receiving atorvastatin therapy. After atorvastatin treatment, hs-CRP level in AF patients decreased significantly (SMD = 1.02, 95% CI: 0.58-1.47, P < 0.001). Subgroup analysis by country and hs-CRP detection methods suggested a negative relationship between atorvastatin treatment and hs-CRP levels among Chinese AF patients (SMD = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.00-1.69, P < 0.001) and by using ELISA method (SMD = 1.11, 95% CI: 0.51-1.71, P < 0.001), but not among Turkish population and using INA method (all P > 0.05). Egger's test showed no publication bias (P = 0.450). hs-CRP was clearly lowered in AF patients treated with atorvastatin, which may be helpful in the choice of statin agents for AF treatment. However, longer follow-ups are necessary to assess the clinical value of lowering hs-CRP in the clinical setting of AF treatment outcomes.",

They differed in whether the options were labeled and the amount of decisional guidance: information only (a balance sheet) versus information plus values clarification (a multicriteria decision analysis). We sent the surveys to members of 2 Internet survey panels. After using the decision aid, participants indicated their preferred medication.

Statin-associated rhabdomyolysis is a serious adverse event with a very low incidence and is considered the most severe of the muscle-related side effects of the statins. Rechallenge with statins is not a recommended practice after rhabdomyolysis. The patient experienced a myocardial infarct 1 y after the episode of rhabdomyolysis. He used alternative lipid-lowering therapy for 2 y. His low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was not meeting typical secondary prevention targets.

Besides the lipid-lowering properties, statins exert their anabolic effects on the bone by differentiating mesenchymal cells to osteoblasts via upregulating BMP-2 and protecting osteoblasts from apoptosis. In addition, statins have been suggested to be anti-osteoclastic by reducing the osteoclast differentiation and activity. Several in vivo and clinical studies have confirmed the beneficial effects of statins in the treatment of osteoporosis and fracture injuries. However, controversial results exist showing statins may have no benefit and in some instances, they may retard bone repair. Different factors such as type, route of administration, dose and dosage of statins, and the injury model seem to be involved for such controversies. In the present study, the most important issues regarding statins have been reviewed to find out how statins may be beneficial and statin therapy can be improved for treating osteoporosis and fracture injuries. The lipophilic statins particularly simvastatin and atorvastatin are the most investigated statins with beneficial results on bone healing and turnover. Most of the in vivo and clinical studies performed systemic route of administration for treating osteoporosis, with much higher clinical doses than the lipid lowering therapy, which increases the statin related side and out of target effects. In contrast, most of the in vivo studies that used statins for fracture repair have applied local delivery methods with much lower doses via tissue engineering approaches. However, local delivery of statins and statin therapy for fracture repair both have low application in the clinical setting and such methods are still under in vivo investigation.

    "95": "Statins reduce atherosclerotic events and cardiovascular mortality. Their side effects include memory loss, myopathy, cataract formation, and increased risk of diabetes. As cardiovascular mortality relates to plaque instability, which depends on the integrity of the fibrous cap, we hypothesize that the inhibition of the potential of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to differentiate into macrophages would help to explain the long known, but less understood \"non-lipid-associated\" or pleiotropic benefit of statins on cardiovascular mortality. In the present investigation, MSCs were treated with atorvastatin or pravastatin at clinically relevant concentrations and their proliferation, differentiation potential, and gene expression profile were assessed. Both types of statins reduced the overall growth rate of MSCs. Especially, statins reduced the potential of MSCs to differentiate into macrophages while they exhibited no direct effect on macrophage function. These findings suggest that the limited capacity of MSCs to differentiate into macrophages could possibly result in decreased macrophage density within the arterial plaque, reduced inflammation, and subsequently enhance plaque stability. This would explain the non-lipid-associated reduction in cardiovascular events. On a negative side, statins impaired the osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation potential of MSCs and increased cell senescence and apoptosis, as indicated by upregulation of p16, p53 and Caspase 3, 8, and 9. Statins also impaired the expression of DNA repair genes, including XRCC4, XRCC6, and Apex1. While the effect on macrophage differentiation explains the beneficial side of statins, their impact on other biologic properties of stem cells provides a novel explanation for their adverse clinical effects.",

This study was designed to determine the role of atorvastatin (ATO) in cardiac autophagy and associated benefits on cardiac remodeling and left ventricular function in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Twenty-eight male SHRs at 8 weeks of age were randomized to treatment with vehicle (saline solution; SHR+V) or ATO (SHR+ATO; 50\u2009mg\u2009kg(-1) per day) for 6 or 12 months. Age-matched male Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats were used as normotensive controls. Cardiac magnetic resonance was used to evaluate cardiac function and structure. Compared with WKY rats, SHRs showed significant left ventricle (LV) dysfunction, remodeling and increases in cardiomyocyte size, which were all attenuated by 6 and 12 months of ATO treatment. Compared with WKY rats, autophagy was activated in the hearts of SHRs and this effect was amplified by chronic ATO treatment, particularly following 12 months of treatment. Protein expression levels of microtubule-associated protein-1 light chain 3-II and beclin-1, the biomarkers of an activated cardiac autophagy, were significantly elevated in ATO-treated versus vehicle-treated SHRs and control WKY rats. Cardiac Akt and phosphorylated mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) expression were also increased in the hearts of SHR versus WKY rats, and this effect was attenuated by ATO treatment. These findings suggest that ATO-mediated improvements in LV function and structure in SHRs may be, in part, through its regulation of cardiac autophagy via the Akt/mTOR pathway.",

Clinical trials have commenced examining whether pravastatin can be used to treat preeclampsia. However, the preclinical evidence supporting pravastatin as a treatment is limited to animal models, with almost no studies in human tissues. Therefore, we examined whether pravastatin reduced sFlt-1 and soluble endoglin secretion and decreased endothelial dysfunction in primary human tissues. Pravastatin reduced sFlt-1 secretion from primary endothelial cells, purified cytotrophoblast cells, and placental explants obtained from women with preterm preeclampsia. It increased soluble endoglin secretion from endothelial cells but did not change secretion from placental explants. The regulation of sFlt-1 by pravastatin seemed to be mediated via the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase cholesterol synthesis pathway. Pravastatin also reduced markers of endothelial dysfunction, including vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 expression and leukocyte adhesion on endothelial cells and increased endothelial cell migration and invasion. We also treated 4 patients with preterm preeclampsia presenting at <30 weeks of gestation with daily pravastatin. Pravastatin seemed to stabilize blood pressure, proteinuria, and serum uric acid levels. Furthermore, serum sFlt-1 levels decreased. We collected the placentas at delivery and found that pravastatin reduced sFlt-1 secretion. These results indicate that pravastatin reduced sFlt-1 and soluble endoglin production and decreased endothelial dysfunction in primary human tissues. We also present pilot data, suggesting that pravastatin can stabilize clinical and biochemical features of preterm preeclampsia. Our data obtained in human tissues support the concept that pravastatin is a candidate therapeutic for preeclampsia.",

We determined the level of atorvastatin in plasma using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. With the endogenous molecules, which showed a good correlation with pharmacokinetic parameters, a refined partial least-squares model was calculated based on predose data from a training set of 36 individuals and exhibited good predictive capability for the other 12 individuals in the prediction set. In addition, the model was successfully used to predictively classify individual pharmacokinetic responses into subgroups. Metabolites such as tryptophan, alanine, arachidonic acid, 2-hydroxybutyric acid, cholesterol, and isoleucine were indicated as candidate markers for predicting by showing better predictive capability for explaining individual differences than a conventional physiological index. These results suggest that a pharmacometabonomic approach offers the potential to predict individual differences in pharmacokinetics and therefore to facilitate individualized drug therapy.",

High liver fat and statin therapy were associated with diabetes (HR 2.06 [95%CI 1.52-2.79, P < 0.0001] and 2.01 [95%CI 1.46-2.77, P < 0.0001], respectively), after multivariable adjustment. With low liver fat and CAC = 0, the number needed to treat (NNT) for statin to prevent one CVD event (NNT 218) was higher than the number needed to harm (NNH) with an incident case of T2D (NNH 68). Conversely, those with CAC >100 and low liver fat were more likely to benefit from statins for CVD reduction (NNT 29) relative to T2D risk (NNH 67).

We selected patients with BE without EAC (controls) using incidence density sampling; 3 controls were matched to each case based on birth year and date of BE diagnosis. Our analysis included only male patients with at least 1 VA visit per year of follow up. We identified prescriptions for statins and non-statin lipid lowering medications filled after BE diagnosis and up to 90 days before EAC diagnosis for cases and controls (during the corresponding time period); we examined the association between statin use and EAC in conditional logistic regression models.",

In this study, treatment of HL-60 cells with lovastatin induced characteristic apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. We demonstrated that lovastatin treatment inhibited Ras and Raf protein translocation to cell membrane and eliminated the phosphorylation of the downstream effectors Akt and ERK, and the subsequent NF-\u03baB translocation into nucleus. Specific inhibitors and \u03b3-tocotrienol confirmed the Ras/Raf/ERK/NF-\u03baB/GLO1 and Ras/Akt/NF-\u03baB/GLO1 pathways. Data revealed that lovastatin induced HL-60 cell death was attenuated by mevalonate treatment. We demonstrated also that \u03b3-tocotrienol showed its apoptotic effect on the HL-60 cell through the same pathway. \u03b3-Tocotrienol enhanced the apoptotic effect of lovastatin through the down-regulation of GLO1 and HMGCR resulting in an increase of methylglyoxal and a decrease of cholesterol and led to the apoptosis of HL-60 cells. Data also revealed that both lovastatin and gamma-tocotrienol induced significant HL-60 cell differentiation. These results suggest that both lovastatin and gamma-tocotrienol could induce differentiation and followed by apoptosis.",

Statins can stabilize atherosclerotic plaques by modulating ECM protein expression. Fibulins are important components of the ECM. We evaluated the in vitro effect of simvastatin on the expression of fibulin-1, -2, -4 and -5 in human coronary artery smooth muscle cells (SMCs) and the mechanisms involved. Cells were incubated with simvastatin (0.05-1 \u03bcM), mevalonate (100 and 200 \u03bcM), geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) (15 \u03bcM), farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) (15 \u03bcM), the Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y-27632 (15 and 20 \u03bcM), the Rac-1 inhibitor (another member of Rho family) NSC23766 (100 \u03bcM), arachidonic acid (a RhoA/ROCK activator, 25-100 \u03bcM) and other fatty acids that are not activators of RhoA/ROCK (25-100 \u03bcM). Gene expression was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR, and fibulin protein levels were analyzed by western blotting and ELISA. Simvastatin induced a significant increase in mRNA and protein levels of fibulin-2 at 24 hours of incubation (p<0.05), but it did not affect fibulin-1, -4, and -5 expression. Mevalonate and GGPP were able to reverse simvastatin's effect, while FPP did not. In addition, Y-27632, but not NSC23766, significantly increased fibulin-2 expression. Furthermore, activation of the RhoA/ROCK pathway with arachidonic acid decreased fibulin-2 mRNA. Simvastatin increased mRNA levels and protein expression of the ECM protein fibulin-2 through a RhoA and Rho-Kinase-mediated pathway. This increase could affect the composition and structure of the ECM.", 
    "178": "The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is comprised of a cluster of closely related risk factors, including visceral adiposity, insulin resistance, hypertension, high triglyceride, and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; all of which increase the risk for the development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. A chronic state of inflammation appears to be a central mechanism underlying the pathophysiology of insulin resistance and MetS. In this review, we summarize recent research which has provided insight into the mechanisms by which inflammation underlies the pathophysiology of the individual components of MetS including visceral adiposity, hyperglycemia and insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. On the basis of these mechanisms, we summarize therapeutic modalities to target inflammation in the MetS and its individual components. Current therapeutic modalities can modulate the individual components of MetS and have a direct anti-inflammatory effect. Lifestyle modifications including exercise, weight loss, and diets high in fruits, vegetables, fiber, whole grains, and low-fat dairy and low in saturated fat and glucose are recommended as a first line therapy. The Mediterranean and dietary approaches to stop hypertension diets are especially beneficial and have been shown to prevent development of MetS. Moreover, the Mediterranean diet has been associated with reductions in total and cardiovascular mortality. Omega-3 fatty acids and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1 agonists lower high levels of triglyceride; their role in targeting inflammation is reviewed. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and aldosterone blockers comprise pharmacologic therapies for hypertension but also target other aspects of MetS including inflammation. Statin drugs target many of the underlying inflammatory pathways involved in MetS.", 
    "179": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is highly prevalent worldwide and represents a major cardiovascular risk factor. Dyslipidemia is present in most patients with CKD and further worsens CKD, creating a vicious cycle. The treatment of CKD-related dyslipidemia has been a controversial topic. The use of statins is recommended in all stages of CKD, but it appears to reduce cardiovascular and renal events only in the early CKD stages, up to stage 3. The use of atorvastatin has proven very beneficial; thus, the earliest we start statin treatment, the better for the patient. Atorvastatin and pitavastatin do not need dose adjustments at any level of renal function. Fibrates can be administered in mixed hyperlipidemia, combined with statins in early CKD stages. Omega-3 fatty acids are useful for treating hypertriglyceridemia in CKD. Antibodies against proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 hold promise for a better control of dyslipidemia and a greater reduction of cardiovascular risk.", 
    "180": "Calcific aortic valve disease (CAVD) is a commonly acquired valvular disease. Although previous studies have shown valve calcification to be mediated by a chronic inflammatory disease process, with many similarities to atherosclerosis that included inflammatory cell infiltrates, lipoproteins, lipids, extracellular bone-matrix proteins, and bone minerals, little is known of the mechanisms of the cellular and molecular components and processes. It has recently been hypothesized that the calcific aortic valve is a product of active inflammation, similar to the atherosclerosis pathological process. Thus, the cessation of statin therapy should, in theory, have an effect on the treatment of CAVD and on aortic valve myofibroblasts (AVMFs), which play an important role in aortic valvular calcification. The study aim was to determine if oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) could stimulate the apoptosis of AVMFs and the calcific-related pathway, and whether atorvastatin could inhibit the effects of AVMFs induced by oxLDL. The Wnt/GSK-3\u03b2/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway may play a key role in this process, thereby making a major contribution to aortic valve calcification.",

    "182": "A positive identification of \u03b1-SMA, a myofibroblast marker, confirmed the successful harvesting of myofibroblasts. OxLDL significantly induced cell apoptosis (p < 0.05), and this became even more obvious after 48 h (p < 0.01). OxLDL also significantly increased the protein expression of all differentiation markers (p < 0.05), as confirmed through Western blotting and RT-PCR, while atorvastatin significantly reduced the effects of oxLDL (p < 0.05).", 
    "183": "Among the mechanisms of the cellular and molecular components and processes, oxLDL increased the valve calcification-related signaling pathway by increasing extracellular bone-matrix protein that produces osteoblastic gene markers via the Wnt/GSK-3\u03b2/\u03b2-catenin pathway. And atorvastatin also prevented any oxLDL-induced effects through the same pathway, this may represent a new therapeutic target for CAVD, as an alternative to traditional valve replacement surgery.",

Metoprolol, bisoprolol, nebivolol and atenolol are selective beta-blockers frequently used in the management of arterial hypertension, alone or in fixed combination with other substances. This study presents the most used analytical methods for simultaneous determination in biological fluids of fixed combinations containing selective beta-blockers. Articles in Pub-Med, Science Direct and Wiley Journals databases published between years 2004-2014 were reviewed. Methods such as liquid chromatography--mass spectrometry--mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or high performance liquid chromatography--mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) were used for determination of fixed combination with beta-blockers in human plasma, rat plasma and human breast milk. LC-MS/MS method was used for simultaneous determination of fixed combinations of metoprolol with simvastatin, hydrochlorothiazide or ramipril, combinations of nebivolol and valsartan, or atenolol and amlodipine. Biological samples were processed by protein precipitation techniques or by liquid-liquid extraction. For the determination of fixed dose combinations of felodipine and metoprolol in rat plasma liquid chromatography--electrospray ionization--mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) was applied, using phenacetin as internal standard. HPLC-MS method was applied for the determination of bisoprolol and hydrochlorothiazide in human plasma. For the determination of atenolol and chlorthalidone from human breast milk and human plasma the HPLC method was used. The analytical methods were validated according to the specialized guidelines, and were applied to biological samples, thing that confirms the permanent concern of researchers in this field.",

The Austrian Apheresis Consensus compares the inclusion criteria for patients to be treated in Austria with those from Italy, Germany, Spain, Japan, UK and the United States. The cut off level of 100 mg/dl for lipoprotein(a) is higher in Austria as compared to the aforementioned countries (50 or 60 mg/dl, respectively). The available clinical data reveal that regular weekly lipoprotein apheresis not only results in a significant lowering of the respective atherogenic lipid and lipoprotein parameters, but also in a significant decrease in clinical events and interventions.

In both acute and subchronic models high dose atorvastatin (50mg/kg), unlike to lower doses (0,5 and 5mg/kg), significantly aggravated ulcer lesions induced by indomethacin (30 mg/kg) although, a direct ulcerogenic influence was lacking. Proulcerogenic effect of atorvastatin are likely to be associated with decreased mucosal defense mechanisms (GSH and PGE2), and increased neutrophil infiltration and proinflammatory factors (TNF-a and iNOS) possibly via independently from mevalonate pathway.

Potential confounders, including variables that were associated either with statin use and/or death occurrence and statin use were evaluated within the last 3 months prior to inclusion in the case-control study. Using an intention to continue approach, multiple imputation of missing data, Cox's proportional hazard models or propensity based weighting, the impact of statins on the 7-year all-cause mortality was evaluated.", 
    "209": "Among 1,776 HIV-infected individuals, 138 (8%) were statins users. During a median follow-up of 53 months, 76 deaths occurred, including 6 in statin users. Statin users had more cardiovascular risk factors and a lower CD4 T cell nadir than statin non-users. In univariable analysis, the death rate was higher in statins users (11% vs 7%, HR 1.22, 95%CI 0.53-2.82). The confounders accounted for were age, HIV transmission group, current CD4 T cell count, haemoglobin level, body mass index, smoking status, anti-HCV antibodies positivity, HBs antigen positivity, diabetes and hypertension. In the Cox multivariable model the estimated hazard ratio of statin on all-cause mortality was estimated as 0.86 (95%CI 0.34-2.19) and it was 0.83 (95%CI 0.51-1.35) using inverse probability treatment weights.", 
    "210": "The impact of statin for primary prevention appears similar in HIV-infected individuals and in the general population.", 
    "211": "Hippocampal neuronal damage is critical for the initiation and progression of neurocognitive impairment accompanied obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS). Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) plays an important role in the development of several hippocampus-related neural disorders. Atorvastatin was reported beneficially regulates TLR4. Here, we examined the effects of atorvastatin on hippocampal injury caused by chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH), the most characteristic pathophysiological change of OSAS. Mice were exposed to intermittent hypoxia with or without atorvastatin for 4 weeks. Cell damage, the expressions of TLR4 and its two downstream factors myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MYD88) and TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-\u03b2 (TRIF), inflammatory agents (tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 and interleukin 1\u03b2), and the oxidative stress (superoxide dismutase and malondialdehyde) were determined. Atorvastatin decreased the neural injury and the elevation of TLR4, MyD88, TRIF, pro-inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress caused by CIH. Our study suggests that atorvastatin may attenuate CIH induced hippocampal neuronal damage partially via TLR4 and its downstream signaling pathway.", 
    "212": "Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in developed countries. The management of blood cholesterol through use of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) in at-risk patients is a pillar of medical therapy for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. The recent 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline on managing blood cholesterol provides an important framework for the effective implementation of risk-reduction strategies. The guideline identifies four cohorts of patients with proven benefits from statin therapy and streamlines the dosing and monitoring recommendations based on evidence from published, randomized controlled trials. Primary care physicians and cardiologists play key roles in identifying populations at elevated ASCVD risk. In providing a practical management overview of the current blood cholesterol guideline, we facilitate more informed discussions on treatment options between healthcare providers and their patients.", 
    "213": "Statin therapy can result in muscle pain, cramps, and weakness that may limit physical activity, although reports are mixed. We conducted a randomized control trial to examine the effect of atorvastatin on habitual physical activity levels in a large sample of healthy adults.",

Accelerometers were worn for 96 h before and after drug treatment. Repeated-measures analysis tested physical activity levels after versus those before drug treatment among groups with age and VO2max as covariates.", 
    "215": "In the total sample, sedentary behavior increased (19.5 \u00b1 5.1 min \u00b7 d(-1)), whereas light-intensity (9.1 \u00b1 3.0 min \u00b7 d(-1)) and moderate-intensity (9.7 \u00b1 2.8 min \u00b7 d(-1)) physical activity decreased, as did total activity counts (17.8 \u00b1 6.3 d \u00d7 10(-3)) over 6 months (P < 0.01), with no differences between groups. The atorvastatin group increased sedentary behavior (19.8 \u00b1 7.4 min \u00b7 d(-1)) and decreased light-intensity (10.7 \u00b1 4.3 min \u00b7 d(-1)) and moderate-intensity (8.5 \u00b1 4.0 min \u00b7 d(-1)) physical activity (P < 0.05). On the other hand, the placebo group increased sedentary behavior (19.2 \u00b1 7.1 min \u00b7 d(-1)) and decreased moderate-intensity (11.0 \u00b1 3.8 min \u00b7 d(-1)) and total physical activity counts (-23.8 \u00b1 8.8 \u00d7 10(-3) d(-1)) (P < 0.05).", 
    "216": "Time being sedentary increased and physical activity levels decreased in the total sample over 6 months of drug treatment, independent of group assignment. Our results suggest that statins do not influence physical activity levels any differently from placebo, and the lack of inclusion of a placebo condition may provide insight into inconsistencies in the literature.", 
    "217": "A locally injectable system sequentially delivering an antiresorptive drug (clodronate) followed by an osteogenic agent (simvastatin) was hypothesized to improve femoral head microarchitecture, size, and shape compared with untreated or partial treatment groups in an established piglet osteonecrosis model. After 6 weeks, the clodronate+simvastatin treatment resulted in no collapse, microCT measurements and epiphyseal quotients within 10% of control, normal microstructure, and healthy histology. All other groups exhibited collapse, lower epiphyseal quotients and total femoral head volumes (P<0.05), and abnormal histology. This pilot study provides evidence of synergistic antiresorptive and osteogenic activities, which may prevent femoral head collapse in Perthes disease.", 
    "218": "Several animal studies have shown that statins can inhibit the progression of cirrhosis; however, few clinical studies have been conducted. Previous studies have indicated that statins can prevent the progression of hepatic fibrosis in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and advanced hepatic fibrosis, however data is lacking on patients who have yet to progress to cirrhosis. This study investigated the association between the use of statin and the risk of cirrhosis development in patients with HCV infection.", 
    "219": "We conducted a population-based cohort study by using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. A total of 226,856 patients with HCV infection were included as the study cohort. Each patient was followed from 1997 to 2010 to identify incident cases of cirrhosis. A Cox proportional hazard regression was performed to evaluate the association between statin use and cirrhosis risk.", 
    "220": "A total of 34,273 cases of cirrhosis were identified in the cohort with HCV infection during the follow-up period of 2,874,031.7 person-years. The incidence rate was 445.5 cases of cirrhosis per 100,000 person-years (95% confidence interval (CI), 423.3 to 465.7) for statin users (defined as those who used more than 28 cumulative defined daily doses (cDDD)), and 1311.2 cirrhosis cases per 100,000 person-years (95% CI, 1297.1 to 1325.6) for non-users. A dose-response relationship between statin use and cirrhosis risk was observed. The adjusted hazard ratios were 0.33 (95% CI, 0.31 to 0.36), 0.24 (95% CI, 0.22 to 0.25), and 0.13 (95% CI, 0.12 to 0.15) for statin use of 28 to 83, 84 to 365, and more than 365 cDDD, respectively, relative to no statin use (<28 cDDD).", 
    "221": "Among the patients with HCV infection, statin use was associated with a reduced risk of cirrhosis development in a dose-dependent manner. Further clinical research is required.", 
    "222": "It has been suggested that statins exert potential anti-tumor effects. The relationship between statin use and outcomes in pancreatic cancer is controversial. We hypothesized that statin use at baseline would impact survival among patients with early-stage pancreatic cancer and that the effect might vary by individual statin agent.", 
    "223": "We conducted a retrospective cohort study on data from an integrated healthcare system. We included patients with pancreatic cancer stage I-IIb who underwent resection for curative intent between January 2005 and January 2011. Baseline statin use was characterized as any prior use as well as active use of either simvastatin or lovastatin. Intensity of exposure was calculated as average daily dose prior to surgery. Overall and disease-free survival was assessed from surgery until the end of study (April 2014). We used the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards regression to evaluate the impact of baseline statin use on survival, adjusting for age, sex, Charlson comorbidity score, resection margin, disease stage, and receipt of adjuvant chemotherapy.", 
    "224": "Among 226 patients, 71 (31.4%) had prior simvastatin use and 27 (11.9%) had prior lovastatin use at baseline. Prior simvastatin but not lovastatin use was associated with improved survival (median 28.5 months (95% confidence limit (CL) 20.8, 38.4) for simvastatin vs. 12.9 months (9.6, 15.5) for lovastatin vs. 16.5 months (14.1, 18.9) for non-statin users; log-rank P=0.0035). In Cox regression, active simvastatin use was independently associated with reduced risk for mortality (adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.56 (95% CL 0.38, 0.83), P=0.004) and risk for recurrence (adjusted HR 0.61 (0.41, 0.89), P=0.01). Survival improved significantly among patients who received moderate-high-intensity (median 42.1 months (24.0,52.7)) doses compared with those who received low-intensity doses of simvastatin (median 14.1 months (8.6, 23.8), log-rank P=0.03).",

    "227": "A total of 11 WHHL rabbits of 10-12 weeks of age were divided into two groups, control and pitavastatin-administered groups. A total of 29 atherosclerotic plaque segments from control group and 43 plaque segments from the pitavastatin group were serially imaged by 40MHz intravascular ultrasound in vivo with a tissue characterization software (iMAP\u2122, Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA) at the baseline and the follow-up (16th week).", 
    "228": "The level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was significantly decreased in pitavastatin group. During the follow-up period, plaque area was significantly increased in the control group, whereas it was not significantly changed in the pitavastatin group. The fibrotic, necrotic, and necrotic plus lipidic areas were significantly increased in the control group, while no significant change was revealed for tissue profile in pitavastatin group. The change in the percent areas of fibrotic and lipidic plus necrotic tissues were significantly different between the two groups especially in the superficial half portion of plaque.", 
    "229": "These data indicate that pitavastatin could attenuate atherosclerotic plaque formation and that it could stabilize the plaque in WHHL rabbits. Considering the fact that these were observed even with a high follow-up level of cholesterol, these data might come from the pleiotropic effects of pitavastatin."
