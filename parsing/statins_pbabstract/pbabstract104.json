In this study, red-koji wine was prepared as the substrate and artificially supplemented with monacolin K and citrinin and subjected to vinegar fermentation with Acetobacter starter. After 30 days of fermentation, 43.0 and 98.1% of the initial supplements of monacolin K and citrinin were decreased, respectively. During fermentation, acetic acid contents increased, accompanied by decreases of ethanol and lactic acid contents and pH values. The contents of free amino acids increased while the contents of other organic acids, including fumaric acid, citric acid, succinic acid, and tartaric acid, changed limitedly. Besides, increased levels of total phenolics in accordance with increased antioxidative potency, \u03b1,\u03b1-diphenyl-\u03b2-picrylhydrazyl scavenging, and xanthine oxidase inhibitory (XOI) activities were detected. It is of merit that most citrinin was eliminated and >50% of the monacolin K was retained; contents of free amino acids and total phenolics along with antioxidant and XOI activities of the red-koji vinegar were increased after fermentation.",

Reasons for its rapidly increasing incidence include the rising prevalence of gastroesophageal reflux and obesity, combined with the decreasing prevalence of Helicobacter pylori infection. The strong male predominance remains unexplained, but hormonal influence might play an important role. Future prevention might include the treatment of reflux or obesity or chemoprevention with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or statins, but no evidence-based preventive measures are currently available. Likely future developments include endoscopic screening of better defined high-risk groups for EAC. Individuals with Barrett esophagus might benefit from surveillance, at least those with dysplasia, but screening and surveillance strategies need careful evaluation to be feasible and cost-effective. The surgery for EAC is more extensive than virtually any other standard procedure, and postoperative survival, health-related quality of life, and nutrition need to be improved (eg, by improved treatment, better decision-making, and more individually tailored follow-up). Promising clinical developments include increased survival after preoperative chemoradiotherapy, the potentially reduced impact on health-related quality of life after minimally invasive surgery, and the new endoscopic therapies for dysplastic Barrett esophagus or early EAC. The overall survival rates are improving slightly, but poor prognosis remains a challenge.",

Hypercholesterolemia was defined by ATP III criteria based on 10-year CHD risk, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; values below diagnostic thresholds defined control. Across surveys, 60.7% to 64.3% of hypertensives were hypercholesterolemic.

Simvastatin reduced mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity, which was reversed by Rac1-GTPase overexpression and the mTOR agonist phosphatidic acid. Moreover, both Rac1-GTPase overexpression and activation of mTOR by phosphatidic acid drastically blocked simvastatin-induced autophagosome formation in CAMs. Interestingly, simvastatin increased protein expression of a contractile phenotype marker calponin in CAMs, which was blocked by autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine. Simvastatin markedly reduced proliferation of CAMs under both control and proatherogenic stimulation. However, this inhibitory effect of simvastatin on CAM proliferation was blocked by by autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine or silencing of Atg7 genes.

    "34": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and disability in the United States. Although current therapies can reduce the risk for CVD, they are only given to patients who are considered to be at risk, and are therefore only beneficial if a patient's risk is accurately predicted before he or she sustains a cardiovascular (CV) event. Unfortunately, even relatively accurate risk factor analyses, such as the Reynolds Risk Score algorithm, fail to identify some patients who will sustain a CV event within 10 years. In contrast, the presence of an atheroma is an absolute predictor for the potential of an atherothrombotic event to occur, and it is therefore reasonable to anchor clinical decisions based on this knowledge. Carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) testing via B-mode ultrasound is a safe, simple, and inexpensive method for evaluating CV risk by measuring the combined thickness of the intimal and medial layers of the arterial wall. Use of CIMT testing can also detect marked thickening of the arterial wall, possibly indicating plaques or atheromas that are associated with accelerated atherosclerotic disease and increased risk for coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, and stroke. These characteristics make CIMT a practical supplemental method that physicians can use when making decisions. Moreover, the ability of CIMT testing to identify and quantify atherosclerotic disease has led to the adoption of CIMT as a surrogate endpoint in clinical trials, allowing the efficacy of new drugs to be assessed much more rapidly than would be possible by focusing solely on CV event or mortality rates. To date, several trials have provided evidence to indicate that some CVD therapies slow, stop, or reverse the progression of CIMT. Although many of these studies show that changes in CIMT predict future CV events, the value of CIMT testing in CVD risk assessment is still vigorously debated. In this article, we clarify the utility of CIMT testing for risk classification and reexamine its usefulness as a method for assessing therapeutic efficacy.",

The composite coating was prepared by combining different ratios of PLGA and BCP (1:2, 1:1, 2:1). After completion of the coating process, the compressive strength of the scaffolds was shown to increase with an increase in PLGA concentration from 8.5\u2009\u00b1\u20090.52\u2009MPa for the SPB1-BCP/ZrO2 (1:2) to 11\u2009\u00b1\u20090.65\u2009MPa for SPB3-BCP/ZrO2 (2:1) scaffolds when PLGA concentration was increased. Furthermore, the increase of PLGA in the coating composition corresponds to a decrease in porosity, degradation rate and weight loss of the scaffolds after 4 weeks. SIM release study demonstrated sustained release of the drug for the three kinds of scaffolds with improved biocompatibility. The increase of PLGA concentration also resulted in a lower release rate of SIM. Thus, the lower release rate of SIM brought upon by the increase of PLGA concentration further enhanced the performance of the scaffold in vitro making it a promising approach in the field of bone tissue regeneration.",

Patients with familial hypercholesterolemia and genetic mixed hyperlipidemias do not meet goals with standard therapy. Patients with mixed hyperlipidemia secondary to the metabolic syndrome, diabetes, renal, or HIV infection are at high residual risk due to low HDL-cholesterol or high triglycerides. Newer therapies can be added to statins. The use of ezetimibe has CVD outcomes evidence in chronic renal disease. Adding omega-3 fatty acids, fibrates, or niacin to statins has failed to show any benefit except possibly with fibrates in patients with diabetes and low HDL-C/high triglycerides. Additional benefits on lipid profiles have been shown with pro-protein convertase subtilisin/kexin-9 (PCSK9), mipomersen, lomitapide, and cholesterol ester transfer protein inhibitors (CETPIs). Two CETPIs have failed to show benefit in hard outcomes trials but others remain under investigation. It remains unclear whether additional therapies add to statins for the prevention of CVD in most patients. They may have some added benefit in patients with complex dyslipidemias.",

Recent trials using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) have shown that lipid-lowering therapy with statins halts the progression or induces the regression of coronary artery plaques. However, impacts of age on coronary atherosclerosis and vascular response to statin therapy have not been fully evaluated. The effects of 8-month statin therapy on coronary atherosclerosis were evaluated using virtual histology-IVUS. IVUS data were analyzed from 119 patients who were divided into two groups according to age: elderly patients (\u226565 years, n = 72) and non-elderly patients (<65 years, n = 47). No patients were taking statins or other lipid-lowering therapies at baseline. At baseline, external elastic membrane (EEM) volume (17.27 vs. 14.95 mm(3)/mm, p = 0.02) and plaque volume (9.49 vs. 8.11 mm(3)/mm, p = 0.03) in the elderly patients were significantly greater than in the non-elderly patients. The EEM volume (-2.4 %, p = 0.007) and plaque volume (-3.1 %, p = 0.007) after 8-month of statin therapy had significantly decreased in the non-elderly patients but not in the elderly patients. A significant positive correlation was observed between age and percentage change in plaque volume (r = 0.265, p = 0.004). A multivariate regression analysis showed that age was a significant predictor of the percentage change in plaque volume during statin therapy (\u03b2 = 0.223, p = 0.02). Coronary atherosclerosis was more advanced and vascular responses to statin therapy were attenuated in the elderly patients compared to the non-elderly patients.",

A total of 44 type 1 diabetes mellitus patients were randomised into the treatment group [n = 22; received a low-dose combination of fluvastatin (10 mg daily) and valsartan (20 mg daily)] and the control group (n = 22; received placebo), both for 30 days. Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD), pulse wave velocity (PWV) and carotid artery \u03b2-stiffness were measured. Significant improvements in FMD (+73.2%), PWV (-7.5%) and \u03b2-stiffness (-10.0%) were achieved after 1-month treatment compared to the control group (all p values < 0.001). Three months after therapy discontinuation, important residual improvement in measured parameters was still present. No changes in lipids and blood pressure accompanied the beneficial improvements.

Studies concerning the capacity of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and simvasatain (SIMV) to repair fibrotic tissues through reducing inflammation, collagen deposition, are still controversial. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of bone marrow (BM)-derived MSCs and SIMV on carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver fibrosis in rats. Rats were divided into: normal, CCl4, CCl4/MSCs, CCl4/SIMV, CCl4/MSCs/SIMV, and SIMV groups.

MMP-1 expression was increased in the CCl4/MSCs group. Histopathological examination as well as fibrosis score supports the biochemical and molecular findings. It can be concluded that MSCs and SIMV were effective in the treatment of hepatic CCl4-induced fibrosis-rat model. Treatment with MSCs was superior to SIMV.

Previous studies have suggested that carriers of the ABCC6 mutations, particularly of p.R1141X, are at increased risk for coronary artery disease. In this study, we used Abcc6 (tm1Jfk) knock-out mice to determine the serum lipid profiles and examine the effects of atorvastatin on the aberrant mineralization in this model of PXE. First, serum lipid profiles at 12 weeks of age, after overnight fasting, revealed a statistically significant increase in total cholesterol and triglyceride levels in Abcc6 (tm1Jfk) mice compared to their wild-type littermates. Placing these mice at 4 weeks of age for 20 weeks on atorvastatin, either 0.01 % or 0.04 % of the diet (low statin and high statin groups, respectively), reduced the total triglyceride and cholesterol levels, which was accompanied with significantly reduced mineralization of the dermal sheath of vibrissae, a biomarker of the aberrant mineralization process in these mice. However, if the mice were placed on atorvastatin for 12 weeks at 12 weeks of age, at which time point significant mineralization had already taken place, no difference in the amount of mineralization was noted. These observations suggest that statins, particularly atorvastatin, can prevent, but not reverse, aberrant mineralization in this mouse model of PXE. For a clinical perspective, a survey of 1,747 patients with PXE was conducted regarding their present or past use of statins. The results indicated that about one third of all PXE patients are currently or have previously been on cholesterol-lowering drugs.

HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) have been suspected to participate to bone loss, but the mechanisms involved are unknown. In endothelial cells, some PIs have been shown to induce the accumulation of farnesylated prelamin-A, a biomarker of cell aging leading to cell senescence. Herein, we hypothesized that these PIs could induce premature aging of osteoblast precursors, human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), and affect their capacity to differentiate into osteoblasts. Senescence was studied in proliferating human MSCs after a 30-day exposure to atazanavir and lopinavir with or without ritonavir. When compared to untreated cells, PI-treated MSCs had a reduced proliferative capacity that worsened with increasing passages. PI treatment led to increased oxidative stress and expression of senescence markers, including prelamin-A. Pravastatin, which blocks prelamin-A farnesylation, prevented PI-induced senescence and oxidative stress, while treatment with antioxidants partly reversed these effects. Moreover, senescent MSCs presented a decreased osteoblastic potential, which was restored by pravastatin treatment. Because age-related bone loss is associated with increased bone marrow fat, we also evaluated the capacity of PI-treated MSCs to differentiate into adipocyte. We observed an altered adipocyte differentiation in PI-treated MSCs that was reverted by pravastatin. We have shown that some PIs alter osteoblast formation by affecting their differentiation potential in association with altered senescence in MSCs, with a beneficial effect of statin. These data corroborate the clinical observations and allow new insight into pathophysiological mechanisms of PI-induced bone loss in HIV-infected patients.",

In addition, in vivo bioavailability study demonstrated that the relative bioavailability of SIM and SIM \u03b2-hydroxy acid (an active metabolite of SIM) for SIM-loaded SHMC formulation was 138.42% and 163.55%, respectively. In conclusion, monodispersed SHMC appear to be a more promising candidate as a new oral drug delivery vehicle providing a rapid drug release and enhanced oral bioavailability.",

    "180": "Simvastatin, a cholesterol treatment drug, has been shown to stimulate bone regeneration. As such, there has been an increase interest in the development of suitable materials and systems for the delivery of simvastatin. Without the appropriate dosage of simvastatin, the therapeutic effects on bone growth will be significantly reduced. Furthermore, similar to many pharmaceutical compounds, at high concentration simvastatin can cause various adverse side-effects. Given the associated side-effects with the usage of simvastatin, the development of suitable controlled drug release system is pertinent. Calcium phosphate in particularly beta-tricalcium phosphate (\u03b2-TCP) has been extensively studied and used as a carrier material for drug delivery system. In this study, Foraminifera exoskeletons were used as calcium carbonate precursor materials, which were hydrothermally converted to \u03b2-TCP as a carrier material for simvastatin. Natural marine exoskeletons posses interconnected and uniformly porous network capable of improving drug loading and release rate. To prolong the release of simvastatin, an apatite coating was made around the \u03b2-TCP sample and in vitro release studies in simulated body fluid (SBF) showed a significant decrease in release rate. Osteoporotic mice were used to examine the compare therapeutic effectiveness of \u03b2-TCP, \u03b2-TCP with simvastatin, apatite-coated \u03b2-TCP with simvastatin and direct injection of simvastatin near the right femur of the mice. Localized and systemic effect were compared with the femur of the non-implanted side (left) and showed that \u03b2-TCP with or without simvastatin was able to induce significant bone formation over 6\u2009weeks. Mechanical analysis showed that apatite-coated \u03b2-TCP with simvastatin produced significantly stronger bones compared with other experimental groups. This study shows that natural exoskeletons with the appropriate structure can be successfully used as a drug delivery system for simvastatin and can its release can be prolonged with an apatite coating to significantly promote relevant bone formation.",

Magnetic resonance imaging of the lower extremities showed findings consistent with myositis. Patient underwent biopsy of the thigh muscles, which showed inflammatory myositis. Liver biopsy was characteristic of autoimmune hepatitis. Patient responded well to immunosuppressive therapy with azathioprine and prednisone. Although statins are generally considered safe, recent data from long-term follow-up on patients who are on statins for long duration suggest that prolonged exposure to statins may trigger autoimmune reactions. The exact mechanism of statin-induced autoimmune reaction is unclear. Statins, as proapoptotic agents, release nuclear antigen into the circulation and may induce the production of pathogenic autoantibodies. The role of statins in inducing an endoplasmic reticular stress response with associated upregulation of major histocompatibility complex-1 expression and antigen presentation by muscle fibers has also been reported.

    "218": "Although there is increasing appreciation of the role of the host inflammatory response in determining outcome in patients in colorectal cancer, there has been little concerted effort to favourably manipulate cancer-associated inflammation, either alone or in combination with current oncological treatment. Epidemiological and cardiovascular disease studies have identified aspirin, other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and statins as potential chemotherapeutic agents which may manipulate the host inflammatory response to the benefit of the patient with cancer. Similarly, evidence of a chemotherapeutic effect of histamine-2 receptor antagonists, again mediated by an immunomodulatory effect, has previously led to increased interest in their use in gastrointestinal cancer. Extensive pre-clinical data and a limited number of clinical investigations have proposed a direct effect of these agents on tumour biology, with an anti-tumour effect on several of the hallmarks of cancer, including proliferative capacity, evasion from apoptosis and cell cycle regulation, and invasive capability of tumour cells. Furthermore, clinical evidence has suggested a pertinent role in down-regulating the systemic inflammatory response whilst favourably influencing the local inflammatory response within the tumour microenvironment. Despite such compelling results, the clinical applicability of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, statins and histamine-2 receptor antagonists has not been fully realised, particularly in patients identified at high risk on the basis of inflammatory parameters. In the present review, we examine the potential role that these agents may play in improving survival and reducing recurrence in patients with potentially curative colorectal cancer, and in particular focus on their effects on the local and systemic inflammatory response."
