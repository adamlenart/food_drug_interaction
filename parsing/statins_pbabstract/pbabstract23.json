On the other hand, the role of inflammation in the propagation and propensity to CV events has also been demonstrated. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) which is involved in the immunologic process of inflammation has received the interest for its use in screening and risk reclassification. However, evidence for its causal relationship with atherothrombosis is lacking, and even more, knowing that statins influence on the reduction of CRP levels, a relevant evidence of their clinical benefits in this regard is also lacking. This article reviews four different key points regarding the issue, to better understand the current state and application of the treatment with statins in order to achieve benefits from lowering CRP's levels regarding CV diseases: (1) the mechanisms of reduction of CRP levels by statins; (2) the role of statin-mediated CRP reduction in the atherosclerotic plaque regression; (3) the role in the prevention of CV diseases; and (4) the role in case of secondary prevention. With this basis, the reduction of CRP levels should be interpreted as a reduction of inflammatory burden thus its clinical benefits could be more interesting in secondary prevention. KEY MESSAGES It could be admitted a role of statin-mediated CRP diminution to reduce the rate of progression in atherosclerotic plaque. In general, and in the absence of specific clinical trials, the role of statins by lowering CRP and consequently, preventing cardiovascular events may be superior in case of secondary prevention because a more pronounced state of inflammation and regardless of its levels at baseline.",

Low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering is the primary target for ASCVD risk reduction, showing demonstrable benefits in mortality. However, 70% of events occur even in the presence of statins. This residual risk may be approached with additional LDL-C reduction. Statin intolerance is a common clinical concern affecting adherence and the benefit with statins. There is also significant variation of individual lipid-lowering. Following rapid development, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors have progressed from genetic observations, to mechanistic studies, to closer realization of the goal of CVD risk reduction. This review discusses the science behind PCSK9 inhibition, evidence of trials involving efficacy and safety, and reflections of its present and future role in clinical care, especially in high-risk patients with ASCVD, persons with suboptimal responses to statins and familial hyperlipidemia. Monoclonal antibodies have demonstrated LDL-C lowering of up to 57% as monotherapy and up to 73% when added to statins. Statins have limited efficacy in reduction of LDL-C due to an increased number of LDL-receptors. Elevated lipoprotein (a) levels may also be significantly lowered by PCSK9i. The journey from discovery to PSCK9 target validation took less than five years, and development and approval of therapeutic modalities for PCSK9 inhibitors happened over the next seven.

Specifically, we evaluated the effect of the program on the reach, implementation, and effectiveness on patient self-efficacy; stroke-specific, health-related quality of life; and medication adherence for the prevalent stroke risk factors: (1) diabetes, (2) hypertension, and (3) hyperlipidemia. Medication possession ratios were calculated to evaluate medication adherence using VA pharmacy benefits data pre (6\u00a0months prior) and post (6\u00a0months after) the stroke/TIA event. Based upon the literature standard of 80\u00a0% compliance rate, we dichotomized compliance and modeled the data using logistical regression.

Therefore, there is an emergency need for the development of novel well-tolerated anticancer agents with different mode of action that could be successfully used in combination with other drugs as an adjuvant therapy. The inhibition of intracellular signaling pathways associated with cancer growth and invasiveness is a main therapeutic approach in cancer treatment. It is well known that lipid metabolism is involved in the regulation of key cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Statins and alkylphospholipids are both relatively new synthetic agents with considerable anticancer properties that disturb lipid metabolism and subsequently modulate proliferation and cell survival signaling pathways, leading to apoptosis. Numerous in vitro and in vivo studies have shown promising results for the use of statins and alkylphospholipids as potential therapeutic agents in the treatment of various human malignancies.

We found that there were 78.0% (P < 0.05) and 81.2% (P < 0.05) reduction in the AUC(0-\u221e) of SV, respectively, following pretreatment with two doses of CAP. The AUC(0-\u221e) of SV in the two dose group pretreated with CAP for 7 days were decreased significantly, compared to the group for 1 day. Both the RT-qPCR and Western Blotting data indicated that 7 days pretreatment with CAP increased the expression level of Ugt1a1 in liver. In conclusion, chronic ingestion of CAP enhanced the expression level of Ugt1a1 in liver, causing the food -drug interaction and decrease in SV exposure in rats to a significant extent.",

Scanning electron microscopy, laser diffraction, image analysis, X-ray powder diffractometry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry were used to investigate the physicochemical characteristics of the prepared crystals. The isolated crystals exhibited different crystal habits but possessed the same internal crystal structure. In this study the comparative intrinsic dissolution behaviour of the simvastatin crystals with different types of habits was studied and explained by surface energy and correlated to different solvent systems that were used for crystallization. In our work we diminished the influence of all other physical parameters that could influence the dissolution rate, e.g. particle size, specific surface area and polymorphism in order to focus the study onto the impact of crystal shape itself on the dissolution rate of simvastatin crystals. Rod shaped crystals isolated from more hydrophilic solvent mixture dissolved faster than plate-like crystals obtained from solvent mixture with lower polarity index. We correlated this fact to the different growth rate of the individual faces which resulted in different relative size of the individual crystal faces exposed to the dissolution medium as well as the chemical nature of those faces which in turn influenced the wettability and subsequent dissolution of the active pharmaceutical ingredient.",

Therefore, the present study investigated whether statins could induce the apoptosis of colon cancer cells and regulate the expression of IGF-1R and its associated signaling pathways in the present study. It was demonstrated that simvastatin and pravastatin suppressed cell proliferation and induced cell death in human HT-29 cells, but simvastatin was more potent than pravastatin. Simvastatin induced apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, simvastatin suppressed the expression of IGF-1R and inhibited the activity of phosphorylated-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 and phosphorylated-Akt activated by IGF-1. Simvastatin and IGF-1 each stimulated the activity of phosphorylated ERK1/2. However, simvastatin inhibited cell proliferation and IGF-1 stimulated cell proliferation. Mevalonic acid and PD98059 reversed the ERK activation and apoptosis induced by treatment with simvastatin. It was concluded that simvastatin induces the apoptosis of human colon cancer cells and inhibits IGF-1-induced ERK and Akt expression via the downregulation of IGF-1R expression and proapoptotic ERK activation. Simvastatin may be beneficial for the treatment of colon cancer. The present study suggested that statin may possess therapeutic potential for the treatment of colon cancer.",

Mitochondrial dysfunction related to coenzyme Q10 decline is one of the proposed theories. The present study aimed to investigate the mechanism of atorvastatin-induced myopathy in rats. In addition, the mechanism of the coenzyme Q10 protection was investigated with special focus of mitochondrial alterations. Sprague-Dawely rats were treated orally either with atorvastatin (100mg/kg) or atorvastatin and coenzyme Q10 (100mg/kg). Myopathy was assessed by measuring serum creatine kinase (CK) and myoglobin levels together with examination of necrosis in type IIB fiber muscles. Mitochondrial dysfunction was evaluated by measuring muscle lactate/pyruvate ratio, ATP level, pAkt as well as mitochondrial ultrastructure examination. Atorvastatin treatment resulted in a rise in both CK (2X) and myoglobin (6X) level with graded degrees of muscle necrosis. Biochemical determinations showed prominent increase in lactate/pyruvate ratio and a decline in both ATP (>80%) and pAkt (>50%) levels. Ultrastructure examination showed mitochondrial swelling with disrupted organelle membrane. Co-treatment with coenzyme Q10 induced reduction in muscle necrosis as well as in CK and myoglobin levels. In addition, coenzyme Q10 improved all mitochondrial dysfunction parameters including mitochondrial swelling and disruption. These results presented a model for atorvastatin-induced myopathy in rats and proved that mitochondrial dysfunction is the main contributor in statin-myopathy pathophysiology.", 
    "84": "Statins induce acute vasorelaxation which may contribute to the overall benefits of statins in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. The mechanism underlying this relaxation is unknown. As statins have been shown to alter mitochondrial function, in this study we investigated the role of mitochondria in the relaxation to simvastatin. Relaxation of porcine coronary artery segments by statins was measured using isolated tissue baths. Mitochondrial activity was determined by measuring changes in rhodamine 123 fluorescence. Changes in intracellular calcium levels were determined in freshly isolated smooth muscle cells with Fluo-4 using standard epifluorescent imaging techniques. Simvastatin, but not pravastatin, produced a slow relaxation of the coronary artery, which was independent of the endothelium. The relaxation was attenuated by the mitochondrial complex I inhibitor rotenone (10\u03bcM) and the complex III inhibitor myxothiazol (10\u03bcM), or a combination of the two. The complex III inhibitor antimycin A (10\u03bcM) produced a similar time-dependent relaxation of the porcine coronary artery, which was attenuated by rotenone. Changes in rhodamine 123 fluorescence showed that simvastatin (10\u03bcM) depolarized the membrane potential of mitochondria in both isolated mitochondria and intact blood vessels. Simvastatin and antimycin A both inhibited calcium-induced contractions in isolated blood vessels and calcium influx in smooth muscle cells and this inhibition was prevented by rotenone. In conclusion, simvastatin produces an endothelium-independent relaxation of the porcine coronary artery which is dependent, in part, upon effects on the mitochondria. The effects on the mitochondria may lead to a reduction in calcium influx and hence relaxation of the blood vessel.", 
    "85": "T-cell-dependent airway and systemic inflammation triggers the progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. Retrospective studies suggest that simvastatin has anti-inflammatory effects in both diseases but it is unclear, which cell types are targeted. We hypothesized that simvastatin modulates T-cell activity. Circulating CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, either pure, co-cultured with monocytes or alveolar macrophages (AM) or in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), were ex vivo activated towards Th1/Tc1 or Th2/Tc2 and incubated with simvastatin. Markers for Th1/Tc1 (IFN\u03b3) and Th2/Tc2 (IL-5, IL-13) were measured by ELISA; with PBMCs this was done comparative between 11 healthy never-smokers, 11 current smokers without airflow limitation, 14 smokers with COPD and 11 never-smokers with atopic asthma. T-cell activation induced IFN\u03b3, IL-5 and IL-13 in the presence and absence of accessory cells. Simvastatin did not modulate cytokine expression in pure T-cell fractions. \u03b2-hydroxy-simvastatin acid (activated simvastatin) suppressed IL-5 and IL-13 in pure Th2- and Tc2-cells. Simvastatin suppressed IL-5 and IL-13 in Th2-cells co-cultivated with monocytes or AM, which was partially reversed by the carboxylesterase inhibitor benzil. Simvastatin suppressed IL-5 production of Th2/Tc2-cells in PBMCs without differences between cohorts and IL-13 stronger in never-smokers and asthma compared to COPD. Simvastatin induced IFN\u03b3 in Th1/Tc1-cells in PBMCs of all cohorts except asthmatics. Simvastatin requires activation in accessory cells likely by carboxylesterase to suppress IL-5 and IL-13 in Th2/Tc2-cells. The effects on Il-13 are partially reduced in COPD. Asthma pathogenesis prevents simvastatin-induced IFN\u03b3 up-regulation. Simvastatin has anti-inflammatory effects that could be of interest for asthma therapy.",

    "91": "Solute carrier (SLC) 16A1 is a pH-dependent carrier of 5-oxoproline, a derivative of the amino acid. SLC16A1 interacts with carboxylate group-containing substrates, which are also present in atorvastatin, and might be the reason for its ability to interact with atorvastatin. Does atorvastatin interact with the carrier? Does it also interact with the carrier via the substrate recognition site? This study was carried out to answer these questions. Polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the expression of SLC16A1 in normal human astrocytes. We induced SLC16A1 expression in a mammalian cell line and in Xenopus laevis oocytes. We used [(3)H] 5-oxoproline for direct measurement of SLC16A1-specific transport activity. SLC16A1 was clearly observed in normal human astrocytes. 3-Hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors inhibited the SLC16A1-specific transport of 5-oxoproline. Atorvastatin was the most potent inhibitor, with an inhibition constant of 40\u03bcM. The drug was a non-competitive inhibitor of SLC16A1. In the present study, we showed non-competitive inhibition of SLC16A1-specific transport activity by atorvastatin. However, the affinity between the drug and the carrier was extremely low. Therefore, the interaction of atorvastatin with SLC16A1 is unlikely to be a problem in clinical practice.", 
    "92": "The anti-diabetic drug metformin and cholesterol-lowering statins inhibit prostate cancer cell growth in vitro and have been linked with lowered risk of prostate cancer in epidemiological studies. We evaluated the effects of these drugs on cancerous and non-cancerous prostate epithelial cell lines. Cancer (LNCaP) and normal (RWPE-1) prostate epithelial cell lines were treated with pharmacologic concentrations of metformin and simvastatin alone and in combinations. Relative changes in cell number were measured with crystal violet staining method. Drug effects on apoptosis and cell cycle were measured with flow cytometry. We also measured changes in the activation and expression of a set of reported target proteins of metformin and statins with Western blotting. Metformin decreased the relative cell number of LNCaP cells by inducing G1 cell cycle block, autophagy and apoptosis, and slightly increased cytosolic ATP levels, whereas RWPE-1 cells were resistant to metformin. However, RWPE-1 cells were sensitive to simvastatin, which induced G2 cell cycle block, autophagy and apoptosis, and increased cytosolic ATP levels in these cells. Combination of metformin and simvastatin synergistically decreased cytosolic ATP levels, increased autophagy and instead of apoptosis, induced necrosis in LNCaP cells. Synergistic effects were not observed in RWPE-1 cells. These results suggest, that prostate cancer cells may be more vulnerable to combined growth-inhibiting effects of metformin and simvastatin compared to normal cells. The data presented here provide evidence for the potency of combined metformin and statin, also at pharmacologic concentrations, as a chemotherapeutic option for prostate cancer.", 
    "93": "Simvastatin (SV) is marketed as a lactone ester prodrug which is hydrolyzed to the active simvastatin hydroxyacid (SVA). SV is characterized by a low solubility and undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism. In this study, the influence of the upper gastrointestinal environment on the intraluminal behavior of simvastatin was investigated by a series of in vitro experiments. Dissolution, stability and two-stage dissolution tests were performed using simulated and human gastrointestinal fluids. The dissolution studies revealed a relatively slow dissolution of SV as well as conversion of SV to SVA. The hydrolysis of SV was further examined and stability studies indicated a faster conversion in gastric fluids than in intestinal fluids. These isolated phenomena were then confirmed by the more integrative two-stage dissolution studies. To estimate the predictive value of the in vitro tests, an additional in vivo study was performed in which the gastrointestinal concentration-time profiles also revealed a slow dissolution of SV and faster degradation of SV to SVA in the stomach than in the intestinal tract. However, the plasma concentrations of SV and SVA did not directly correlate with the observed gastrointestinal concentrations, suggesting that gut wall and hepatic metabolism have a greater impact on systemic exposure of SV than the intraluminal interconversion between SV and SVA.", 
    "94": "The complement system is an important part of the innate immune response to infection but may also cause severe complications during inflammation. Small molecule antagonists to complement receptor 3 (CR3) have been widely sought, but a structural basis for their mode of action is not available. We report here on the structure of the human CR3 ligand-binding I domain in complex with simvastatin. Simvastatin targets the metal ion-dependent adhesion site of the open, ligand-binding conformation of the CR3 I domain by direct contact with the chelated Mg(2+) ion. Simvastatin antagonizes I domain binding to the complement fragments iC3b and C3d but not to intercellular adhesion molecule-1. By virtue of the I domain's wide distribution in binding kinetics to ligands, it was possible to identify ligand binding kinetics as discriminator for simvastatin antagonism. In static cellular experiments, 15-25 \u03bcm simvastatin reduced adhesion by K562 cells expressing recombinant CR3 and by primary human monocytes, with an endogenous expression of this receptor. Application of force to adhering monocytes potentiated the effects of simvastatin where only a 50-100 nm concentration of the drug reduced the adhesion by 20-40% compared with untreated cells. The ability of simvastatin to target CR3 in its ligand binding-activated conformation is a novel mechanism to explain the known anti-inflammatory effects of this compound, in particular because this CR3 conformation is found in pro-inflammatory environments. Our report points to new designs of CR3 antagonists and opens new perspectives and identifies druggable receptors from characterization of the ligand binding kinetics in the presence of antagonists.",

    "96": "Fibroblasts, the most abundant cells in the heart, contribute to cardiac fibrosis, the substrate for the development of arrythmogenesis, and therefore are potential targets for preventing arrhythmic cardiac remodeling. A chamber-specific difference in the responsiveness of fibroblasts from the atria and ventricles toward cytokine and growth factors has been described in animal models, but it is unclear whether similar differences exist in human cardiac fibroblasts (HCFs) and whether drugs affect their proliferation differentially. Using cardiac fibroblasts from humans, differences between atrial and ventricular fibroblasts in serum-induced proliferation, DNA synthesis, cell cycle progression, cyclin gene expression, and their inhibition by simvastatin were determined. The serum-induced proliferation rate of human atrial fibroblasts was more than threefold greater than ventricular fibroblasts with faster DNA synthesis and higher mRNA levels of cyclin genes. Simvastatin predominantly decreased the rate of proliferation of atrial fibroblasts, with inhibition of cell cycle progression and an increase in the G0/G1 phase in atrial fibroblasts with a higher sensitivity toward inhibition compared with ventricular fibroblasts. The DNA synthesis and mRNA levels of cyclin A, D, and E were significantly reduced by simvastatin in atrial but not in ventricular fibroblasts. The inhibitory effect of simvastatin on atrial fibroblasts was abrogated by mevalonic acid (500 \u03bcM) that bypasses 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibition. Chamber-specific differences exist in the human heart because atrial fibroblasts have a higher proliferative capacity and are more sensitive to simvastatin-mediated inhibition through HMG-CoA reductase pathway. This mechanism may be useful in selectively preventing excessive atrial fibrosis without inhibiting adaptive ventricular remodeling during cardiac injury.",

In pooled analyses of 335 eligible patients in FDS1 and FDS2, there was no change in HbA1c in the low-intensity group (0.04% or 0.4\u2009mmol/mol; n\u2009=\u2009159; p\u2009=\u2009.40), but a mean 0.22% (2.4 mmol/mol) increase in the moderate-intensity group (n\u2009=\u2009185; p\u2009=\u2009.022) and a larger mean increase of 1.05% (11.5 mmol/mol) increase in the high-intensity group (n\u2009=\u200911; p\u2009=\u2009.023). These real-life data suggest a dose-response relationship between statin treatment intensity and glycaemia that has potential clinical implications.",

The current situation wherein the results of many large-scale clinical trials conducted in Western countries have been adapted for our daily medical treatment is not satisfactory. This is because many differences in medical situations, including stroke incidence rates and doses of medicine for clinical use, exist between Asians and Caucasians. Therefore, it is possible that adoption of clinical study results conducted in Caucasians for Asians is insubstantial. J-STARS results showed that low dose mild statin use may reduce atherothrombotic stroke incidence in patients with non-cardioembolic stroke. Currently, the desirable LDL-cholesterol level for preventing ischemic stroke in Asians is unclear. The results of further examinations are awaited regarding this aspect.",

    "100": "Notwithstanding the effectiveness of lowering LDL cholesterol, residual CVD risk remains in high-risk populations, including patients with diabetes, likely contributed to by non-LDL lipid abnormalities. In this Perspectives in Diabetes article, we emphasize that changing demographics and lifestyles over the past few decades have resulted in an epidemic of the \"atherogenic dyslipidemia complex,\" the main features of which include hypertriglyceridemia, low HDL cholesterol levels, qualitative changes in LDL particles, accumulation of remnant lipoproteins, and postprandial hyperlipidemia. We briefly review the underlying pathophysiology of this form of dyslipidemia, in particular its association with insulin resistance, obesity, and type 2 diabetes, and the marked atherogenicity of this condition. We explain the failure of existing classes of therapeutic agents such as fibrates, niacin, and cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors that are known to modify components of the atherogenic dyslipidemia complex. Finally, we discuss targeted repurposing of existing therapies and review promising new therapeutic strategies to modify the atherogenic dyslipidemia complex. We postulate that targeting the central abnormality of the atherogenic dyslipidemia complex, the elevation of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein particles, represents a new frontier in CVD prevention and is likely to prove the most effective strategy in correcting most aspects of the atherogenic dyslipidemia complex, thereby preventing CVD events.",

Our objective was to determine if a panel of 18 biomarkers previously associated with risk of cardiovascular disease also predicts incident DM in statin-treated patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). The Treating to New Targets (TNT) study is a randomized trial that compared the efficacy of high (80\u00a0mg) versus low (10\u00a0mg) dose atorvastatin for the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease events. Fasting plasma levels of standard lipids and of 18 emerging CAD risk biomarkers were obtained after an 8-week run-in period on atorvastatin 10\u00a0mg in a random sample of 1,424 TNT patients. After exclusion of patients with DM at baseline (n\u00a0= 253), 101 patients developed DM during the median follow-up of 4.9\u00a0years. Patients with incident DM had lower levels of total and high-molecular weight adiponectin, lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2), soluble receptor of advanced glycation end products, and vitamin D compared with patients without incident DM. In contrast, insulin, soluble CD40 ligand, and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 levels were higher in patients with incident DM compared with those without. Plasma levels of C-reactive protein, cystatin C, lipoprotein(a), monocyte chemotactic protein-1, matrix metalloproteinase-9, myeloperoxidase, neopterin, N-terminal fragment of pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, osteopontin, and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 were comparable in patients with and without incident DM. After multivariate adjustment, total and high-molecular weight adiponectin as well as Lp-PLA2 were negatively associated with incident DM. Results of this study suggest that plasma lipids and some emerging CAD risk biomarkers, such as adiponectin and Lp-PLA2, may be useful for predicting incident DM in statin-treated patients with stable CAD.",

To establish method performance characteristics, wheat was spiked with citrinin at levels of 10-200 \u03bcg/kg, whereas red yeast rice was spiked at levels of 100-3000 \u03bcg/kg. Methanol-water (75 + 25, v/v) was used for the extraction of cereals and animal feed, and extraction was with 100% methanol for red yeast rice. Cleanup used a commercial citrinin IAC, followed by LC-fluorescence (\u03bbex, 330 nm; \u03bbem, 500 nm). Recoveries ranged from 80 to 110%, with r from 0.7 to 4.3%. The LOQ for citrinin in both wheat and red yeast rice was 10 \u03bcg/kg, with an LOD of 3 \u03bcg/kg. Satisfactory performance was demonstrated in a proficiency testing exercise for a sample of maize contaminated with both citrinin and ochratoxin A.

There are little known whether statins affect activation of Nrf2 and Nrf2 signaling pathway in colon cancer cells. We investigated whether simvastatin stimulates the expression of Nrf2 and nuclear translocation of Nrf2 and which signal pathway is involved in the expression of Nrf2 and antioxidant enzymes. We investigated the effect of simvastatin on the expression of Nrf2 and nuclear translocation of Nrf2 in two human colon cancer cell lines, HT-29 and HCT 116 through cell proliferation assay, Western blotting and immunocytochemical analysis. We evaluated which signal pathway such as ERK or PI3K pathway affect Nrf2 activation and whether simvastatin induces antioxidant enzymes (heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H: quinine oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), \u03b3-glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit (GCLC)). We demonstrated simvastatin-induced dose-dependent up-regulation of Nrf2 expression and stimulated Nrf2 nuclear translocation in colon cancer cells. We also demonstrated that simvastatin-induced anti-oxidant enzymes (HO-1, NQO1, and GCLC) in HT-29 and HCT 116 cells. PI3K/Akt inhibitor (LY294002) and ERK inhibitor (PD98059) suppressed simvastatin-induced Nrf2 and HO-1 expression in both HT-29 and HCT 116 cells.

    "163": "Leishmania are obligate intracellular protozoan parasites that invade and survive within host macrophages leading to leishmaniasis, a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, particularly among economically weaker sections in tropical and subtropical regions. Visceral leishmaniasis is a potent disease caused by Leishmania donovani. The detailed mechanism of internalization of Leishmania is poorly understood. A basic step in the entry of Leishmania involves interaction of the parasite with the host plasma membrane. In this work, we have explored the effect of chronic metabolic cholesterol depletion using lovastatin on the entry and survival of Leishmania donovani in host macrophages. We show here that chronic cholesterol depletion of host macrophages results in reduction in the attachment of Leishmania promastigotes, along with a concomitant reduction in the intracellular amastigote load. These results assume further relevance since chronic cholesterol depletion is believed to mimic physiological cholesterol modulation. Interestingly, the reduction in the ability of Leishmania to enter host macrophages could be reversed upon metabolic replenishment of cholesterol. Importantly, enrichment of host membrane cholesterol resulted in reduction in the entry and survival of Leishmania in host macrophages. As a control, the binding of Escherichia coli to host macrophages remained invariant under these conditions, thereby implying specificity of cholesterol requirement for effective leishmanial infection. To the best of our knowledge, these results constitute the first comprehensive demonstration that an optimum content of host membrane cholesterol is necessary for leishmanial infection. Our results assume relevance in the context of developing novel therapeutic strategies targeting cholesterol-mediated leishmanial infection.",

We sought to address this issue within a prospective randomized trial of statin therapy. Men and women (n\u00a0= 17,515) free of cardiovascular disease participating in a randomized placebo controlled trial of rosuvastatin 20\u00a0mg/day had baseline levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) below <40 IU/l and were followed prospectively for the first-ever cardiovascular events. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate the relative risks of these events according to increasing tertiles and each SD increase in baseline ALT levels. ALT levels at study entry, all within the normal range, were inversely associated with age, smoking status, and inflammation and were positively associated with male gender, alcohol use, and triglycerides. Incident cardiovascular event rates were highest in those in the lowest tertile of baseline ALT; specifically, incidence rates were 1.43, 0.98, and 0.85 per 100 person-years of exposure for those in the lowest, middle, and highest tertile of baseline ALT within the normal range, respectively (p <0.001). These inverse effects remained statistically significant after multivariate adjustment for a wide range of vascular risk factors risk markers such that each higher SD unit of ALT was associated with an 18% lower event rate (relative risk 0.82, 95% confidence interval 0.72 to 0.93, p\u00a0= 0.002). The efficacy of statin therapy was not modified by baseline ALT level. In conclusion, increasing ALT levels within the normal range are inversely associated with future cardiovascular risk but had limited clinical utility and also did not modify the efficacy of statin therapy.",

Genotyping of the human OATP1B1 gene was performed in all 12 subjects and confirmed absence of OATP1B1*5 and OATP1B1*15 mutations. Average plasma concentrations of CP-I and CP-III prior to drug administration were 0.91 \u00b1 0.21 and 0.15 \u00b1 0.04 nM, respectively, with minimum fluctuation over the three periods. CP-I was passively eliminated, whereas CP-III was actively secreted from urine. Administration of RSV caused no significant changes in the plasma and urinary profiles of CP-I and CP-III. RIF markedly increased the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of CP-I and CP-III by 5.7- and 5.4-fold (RIF) or 5.7- and 6.5-fold (RIF+RSV), respectively, as compared with the predose values. The area under the plasma concentration curves from time 0 to 24 h (AUC0-24h) of CP-I and CP-III with RIF and RSV increased by 4.0- and 3.3-fold, respectively, when compared with RSV alone. In agreement with this finding, Cmax and AUC0-24h of RSV increased by 13.2- and 5.0-fold, respectively, when RIF was coadministered. Collectively, we conclude that CP-I and CP-III in plasma and urine can be appropriate endogenous biomarkers specifically and reliably reflecting OATP inhibition, and thus the measurement of these molecules can serve as a useful tool to assess OATP drug-drug interaction liabilities in early clinical studies.",

Cox proportional hazards models and logistic regression were used to estimate incidence rate ratios. In the time-dependent cohort design, statin use was associated with a decreased risk of revision surgery (adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.85, 0.96), which was similar to our case-control results (IRR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.81, 0.93).

Statins reduce plasma cholesterol levels, but whether this is actually caused by inhibition of de novo cholesterol synthesis has not been clearly established. Using three different statins, we investigated the effects on cholesterol metabolism in mice in detail. Surprisingly, direct measurement of whole body cholesterol synthesis revealed that cholesterol synthesis was robustly increased in statin-treated mice. Measurement of organ-specific cholesterol synthesis demonstrated that the liver is predominantly responsible for the increase in cholesterol synthesis. Excess synthesized cholesterol did not accumulate in the plasma, as plasma cholesterol decreased. However, statin treatment led to an increase in cholesterol removal via the feces. Interestingly, enhanced cholesterol excretion in response to rosuvastatin and lovastatin treatment was mainly mediated via biliary cholesterol secretion, whereas atorvastatin mainly stimulated cholesterol removal via the transintestinal cholesterol excretion pathway. Moreover, we show that plasma cholesterol precursor levels do not reflect cholesterol synthesis rates during statin treatment in mice. In conclusion, cholesterol synthesis is paradoxically increased upon statin treatment in mice. However, statins potently stimulate the excretion of cholesterol from the body, which sheds new light on possible mechanisms underlying the cholesterol-lowering effects of statins.", 
    "197": "Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) are a major health problem both in industrialized countries and in developing ones, and a leading cause of death and disability. The pathogenesis of ACS is multifactorial and complex, with approximately 65-70% of cases caused by the abrupt occlusion of a coronary vessel. This usually occurs as a result of thrombus formation over a vulnerable, lipid-rich atherosclerotic plaque, which undergoes rupture or erosion. High levels of LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) are a well known risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis, and the reduction in plasma LDL-C is a fundamental treatment both in primary and secondary prevention. Statins are the most extensively used lipid-lowering drugs. They have been associated with reduced progression of coronary atherosclerosis and a decreased incidence of new ACS episodes or post-ACS major cardiovascular events. For ACS patients, the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) has suggested an early treatment - starting with the acute phase - together with a well defined target value of LDL-C level, which should be achieved during the follow-up. While statin therapy has significantly lowered cardiovascular risk, several cardiovascular events are still not prevented and a residual risk remains also after intensive therapy. In addition, a significant proportion of high-risk patients do not achieve the LDL-C target recommended by the ESC guidelines or present with statin intolerance, which does not allow a continuative and effective treatment. This is the main reason why innovative lipid-lowering therapies might become a new opportunity in ACS patients. The recently published results of the IMPROVE-IT trial have shown that the association statin + ezetimibe is superior to statin alone in preventing cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, rehospitalization for unstable angina, coronary revascularization and stroke in a population of medium to high-risk patients stabilized after ACS. Monoclonal antibodies targeting human PCSK9 are currently being tested on top of statins in patients with ACS, to investigate their superiority in reducing major cardiovascular adverse events as compared with statins alone at the maximally tolerated dose. The results, expected for 2017, will hopefully benefit the treatment of patients in secondary prevention and contribute to a better outcome of ACS patients worldwide.", 
    "198": "The need for new lipid-lowering drugs is based on the clear-cut evidence that a considerable proportion of patients with dyslipidemia cannot reach the target of cardiovascular protection with the use of currently available drugs (statins, ezetimibe, fibrates). Among the new classes of drugs, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors (namely alirocumab and evolocumab) provide an effective solution for patients with familial hypercholesterolemia as well as for high-risk patients who do not achieve the target or complain statin-related adverse events. The use of PCSK9 inhibitors is associated with a huge reduction in LDL-cholesterol levels (up to 30-40 mg/dl) with 1-2 monthly administrations, and their effect is integrated with that of statins and ezetimibe. The improvement of lipid profile is in the range of that observed with other new drugs such as lopitamide and mipomersen, while the tolerability profile appears definitely better. A more effective characterization of patients with dyslipidemia is the trainer of new research in the field of lipid-lowering drugs and PCSK9 inhibitors appear the more reliable product of such a promising research.", 
    "199": "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of premature death in Europe. High blood cholesterol is one of the major cardiovascular risk factors and plays a crucial role in causing cardiovascular disease. A strong positive and linear association between total and LDL cholesterol levels and the risk of cardiovascular events has been widely documented. Every 1.0 mmol/l decrease in LDL cholesterol levels results in a significant reduction in cardiovascular mortality and in the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction. Lipid-lowering guidelines suggest as first step the use of statins as monotherapy and, in case of failure to achieve the recommended targets, combination therapy of statins with other cholesterol-lowering drugs such as ezetimibe. The results from the recent IMPROVE-IT trial provide evidence that further LDL-cholesterol lowering beyond the recommended targets significantly reduces the rate of cardiovascular events, supporting the concept that \"Lower Is Better\" while additional long-term data are collected. Non-adherence to statin therapy, often due to adverse drug reactions, results in an increased risk for cardiovascular events. In a non-negligible proportion of patients with hypercholesterolemia receiving maximally tolerated statin therapy, the residual risk remains high. In addition, statin use has been associated with accelerated onset of diabetes in individuals already predisposed to developing diabetes. In conclusion, it is clear that statins are not the universal solution to the problem of high cholesterol levels, and the optimization of lipid-lowering therapy remains a therapeutic challenge.", 
    "200": "The wide availability of drugs effective in reducing cardiovascular events and the use of myocardial revascularization have greatly improved the prognosis of patients with coronary artery disease. However, the combination of antithrombotic drugs to be administered before the exact knowledge of the coronary anatomy and before the consequent therapeutic strategy can, on one hand, allow to anticipate an optimal treatment but, on the other hand, may expose the patient to a bleeding risk not always necessary. In patients with ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome with an indication to primary angioplasty, the administration of unfractionated heparin and aspirin is considered the pre-procedural standard treatment. The upstream administration of an oral P2Y12 inhibitor, even if not supported by randomized controlled trials, appears reasonable in view of the very high likelihood of treatment with angioplasty. In patients with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome, in which it is not always chosen an invasive strategy, the occurrence of bleeding can significantly weigh on prognosis, even more than the theoretical benefit of pretreatment. Fondaparinux is the anticoagulant with the most favorable efficacy/safety profile. Antiplatelet pretreatment must be selective, guided by the ischemic risk conditions, the risk of bleeding and the time schedule for coronary angiography.In patients with stable coronary artery disease, generally treated with aspirin, pretreatment with clopidogrel is advisable in case of already scheduled angioplasty, and it appears reasonable in case of high likelihood, at least in patients at low bleeding risk. In patients candidate to surgical revascularization, aspirin is typically maintained and the oral P2Y12-inhibitor discontinued, with i.v. antiplatelet drug bridging in selected cases.Anti-ischemic drugs are useful in controlling symptoms, but they have no specific indications with regard to revascularization procedures. Statins showed protective effects on periprocedural damage and late clinical events, when administered early. Although randomized data are lacking, it seems reasonable their pre-procedural administration, due to potential advantages without significant adverse effects.",

Accordingly, international guidelines recommend a reduction of LDL-C below 70 mg/dl in ACS patients.

The occurrence of such adverse events during statin therapy may cause discontinuation of treatment together with the impossibility of achieving recommended lipid goals. The clinical condition in which patients experience major unacceptable symptoms and/or develop laboratory abnormalities during statin therapy is defined as statin intolerance. This document outlines the diagnostic and therapeutic pathways for the clinical management of patients with hypercholesterolemia and statin intolerance.",

Disruption to this barrier through inflammation is a major contributor to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. The amyloid beta (A\u03b2) protein is known to exist in several forms and is a key modulator of AD that is known to cause inflammation and changes to BBB function. While one of these forms, fibrillary A\u03b2 (fA\u03b2), is known to cause endothelial cell death at the BBB, no studies have looked specifically at its role on inflammation in a model of the human BBB.",

The presence of SLCO1B1 C-allele in patients with hyperlipidemia forces us to be more careful in hypolipidemic drug prescription, especially statins, according to a higher risk of statin-induced myopathy development. The fact that SLCO1B1 C-allele is rarer among Sakha patients, could be interesting from the point of studying adverse drug effects frequency and statins' effectiveness.",

    "221": "Statins, lipid-lowering agents for the prevention of atherosclerosis and fatal coronary heart diseases, have pleiotropic modalities on the function and physiology of vascular smooth muscle that include anti-contractile and pro-apoptotic effects. These effects were suggested to stem from the inhibition of small GTPase Rho A, but they are largely regarded as distinct and unrelated. Recently, we discovered that simvastatin causes both contractile dysfunction and apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), reflecting that they may be closely related, yet their connecting link remains unexplained. Here, we elaborated the mechanism underlying simvastatin-induced apoptosis of normal VSMCs in connection with contractile dysfunction. Repeated oral administration of simvastatin to rats in vivo resulted in contractile dysfunction and apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle, of which pattern was well reproduced in rat VSMCs in vitro. Of note, contractile dysfunction and apoptosis occurred in concerted manners both in vivo and in vitro in the aspects of time course and dose of exposure. In rat VSMCs, simvastatin impaired the activation of small GTPases, RhoA along with Rac-1, which resulted in the disruption of actin integrity, a pivotal factor both for the generation of contractile force and survival of VSMCs. In line with the disruption of actin integrity, Bmf, a pro-apoptotic factor bound to intact actin, dissociated and translocated into mitochondria, which corresponded well with the dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential, caspase-3 activation and ultimately apoptosis. These events were all rescued by an actin stabilisation agent, jasplakinolide as well as geranylgeraniol, indicating that damages of the actin integrity from disrupted activation of RhoA/Rac-1 lies at the center of simvastatin-induced contractile dysfunction and apoptosis in vascular smooth muscle.", 
    "222": "Homozygous hypercholesterolemia is an extremely rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the LDL receptor gene or occasionally by mutations in other genes like proprotein convertase subtilisin / kexin 9 (PCSK9). Gold standard of homozygous hypercholesterolemia therapy is apheresis, accompanied by high-dose statin and ezetimibe therapy. The cholesterol-lowering effect can be supported by new agents like inhibitors of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (lomitapide), or by enhancing LDL catabolism through inhibition of the PCSK9 activity. We present the case of a young woman with homozygous hyperlipidemia due to a mutation c.1200 C> A(p.Tyr400*) in the LDLR gene that introduces a stop-codon at amino acid position 400. This truncated LDLR cannot mediate a membrane-bound uptake of LDL cholesterol. A combined therapy including simvastatin, ezetimibe and apheresis did not lead to satisfactory LDL levels. By adding lomitapide, a dramatic receptor-independent reduction of LDL was achieved.", 
    "223": "The proprotein convertase subtilisin / kexin type 9 (PCSK9) plays an important role in LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) metabolism. Subjects harboring loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding for PCSK9 display markedly reduced LDL-C plasma levels. PCSK9 is secreted by the liver, binds to the LDL receptor and, following endocytosis, induces lysosomal degradation of the receptor together with the bound LDL-C. Current PCSK9 inhibitors are monoclonal antibodies that specifically absorb PCSK9. Subsequently, instead of being degraded the receptor can dissociate from LDL-C and recycle, consecutively resulting in an increased hepatocyte LDL receptor density and higher LDL-C clearance. In clinical trials, the PCSK9 inhibitors alirocumab and evolocumab induced reductions in LDL-C of up to 70 % in statin-treated as well as statin-na\u00efve patients. So far, serious side effects (requiring cessation of drug treatment) occurred only in rare cases. Since this new class of lipid lowering drugs promises a high potential benefit, they have been approved by the EMA even before completion of the studies addressing clinically relevant endpoints like cardiovascular events and mortality. Therefore, the expected publication of these study results in 2017 may allow a better assessment of the efficacy and safety of PCSK9 inhibitors.", 
    "224": "The 2013 AHA/ ACC guidelines on the assessment of cardiovascular risk recommend high-dose statin treatment to reduce LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) by at least 30-50% without suggesting a specific target value 1. Favoring a strict Evidence Based Medicine approach the authors focus on randomized clinical trials only and neglect a target value since none of the randomized trials has titrated statin therapy to a specific LDL-C concentration. This is in contrast to current European guidelines. This paradigm shift has created a lot of controversy and confusion due to the lacking opportunity to assess medication adherence and the addition of further lipid lowering therapy. Moreover, these new guidelines might discourage clinicians to individualize patient care.",

    "245": "Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate how general practitioners' (GPs) decisions about discontinuation of medication are influenced by their institutional context. Design/methodology/approach - In total, 24 GPs were interviewed, three practices were observed and documents were collected. The Gioia methodology was used to analyse data, drawing on a theoretical framework that integrate the sensemaking perspective and institutional theory. Findings - Most GPs, who actively consider discontinuation, are reluctant to discontinue medication, because the safest course of action for GPs is to continue prescriptions, rather than discontinue them. The authors conclude that this is in part due to the ambiguity about the appropriateness of discontinuing medication, experienced by the GPs, and in part because the clinical guidelines do not encourage discontinuation of medication, as they offer GPs a weak frame for discontinuation. Three reasons for this are identified: the guidelines provide dominating triggers for prescribing, they provide weak priming for discontinuation as an option, and they underscore a cognitive constraint against discontinuation. Originality/value - The analysis offers new insights about decision making when discontinuing medication. It also offers one of the first examinations of how the institutional context embedding GPs influences their decisions about discontinuation. For policymakers interested in the discontinuation of medication, the findings suggest that de-stigmatising discontinuation on an institutional level may be beneficial, allowing GPs to better justify discontinuation in light of the ambiguity they experience.",
