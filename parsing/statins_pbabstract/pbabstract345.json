The aim of this study was to describe compliance with statin treatment by analysing prescription patterns on an individual level in a population-based prescription database over a 6 year period.", 
    "1": "For incident statin users, all prescriptions for statins and drugs indicating cardiovascular disease or diabetes were retrieved from the OPED prescription database covering a population of about 470,000 inhabitants. Treatment was considered discontinued if the interval between two prescriptions exceeded number of tablets prescribed, plus 30 days. Compliance was assessed in terms of persistence and continuity. Persistence was defined as the period from the first prescription date to the date of discontinuation. Continuity was defined as the number of days with treatment (=number of tablets) divided by the total number of days in the period of persistence.", 
    "2": "11% of the study cohort only received a single statin prescription. Survival analyses revealed a median persistence of 41 months. Less than 15% of the patients had more than 20% days without therapy within the period of persistence. Patients under 45 years without drug indicators of cardiovascular disease or diabetes presented the lowest compliance.", 
    "3": "The study showed good compliance with statin treatment in terms of persistence and continuity. A high percentage of the youngest patients, however, seemed to discontinue treatment before obtaining the full benefit in terms of decreased risk of coronary heart morbidity and mortality.", 
    "4": "Among the traditional risk factors, dyslipidaemia and coagulation disorders play an important role in increasing the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) in patients with type 2 diabetes. The lipid abnormalities of patients with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes include increased triglycerides, lower high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol and the predominance of small dense low density lipoprotein (LDL)-particles. The composition of HDL particles is different from healthy controls and the concentration of the larger, more anti-atherogenic particles is decreased in patients with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Subgroup analyses of several large studies have shown that lowering LDL-cholesterol with statin treatment decreased cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes. In other studies, gemfibrozil decreased cardiovascular events in a subgroup of patients with diabetes, although the decreases were not always statistically significant. Platelets from patients with diabetes are more sensitive to several aggregating agents, have increased numbers of glycoprotein receptors and a lower activity of guanylate cyclase. These factors may contribute to the documented hyperreactivity of platelets in patients with type 2 diabetes. Other factors in patients with type 2 diabetes include alterations in serum fibrinogen, PAI-1, tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPa) and factors V, II and VII, which have all been linked to the risk of myocardial infarction. Increased D-dimer, von Willebrand factor (vWf) antigen, A-II anti-plasmin and decreased anti-thrombin III were also reported in patients with type 2 diabetes. This pro-thrombotic risk profile of the circulating blood in type 2 diabetes patients, together with the lipid abnormalities, contributes to the increased risk of vascular events in this population.", 
    "5": "Laboratory data suggest that the cholesterol-lowering \"statin\" drugs may have chemopreventive potential against cancer at various sites, including breast and prostate. However, in one trial of pravastatin there was a significant excess of breast cancer in the treatment group. In the present study, we assessed the relation of statin use to the risk of breast and prostate cancer in our hospital-based Case-Control Surveillance Study of Drugs and Serious Illnesses.", 
    "6": "Cases were 1,132 women with breast cancer and 1,009 men with prostate cancer; controls were 1,331 women and 1,387 men admitted for conditions unrelated to statin use. We used multivariate unconditional logistic regression models to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for use of statins compared with no use.", 
    "7": "The OR for breast cancer among statin users was 1.5 (95% CI = 1.0-2.3), largely accounted for by an OR of 1.8 (95% CI = 0.9-3.6) among cases with carcinoma in situ. Among invasive cases, the OR was 1.2 (95% CI = 0.7-2.0). The odds ratio for prostate cancer overall was 1.2 (95% CI = 0.8-1.7), and it was 1.4 (95% CI = 0.7-2.5) for Stage A.", 
    "8": "The data from the present study do not support a protective effect of statins against breast or prostate cancer. Detection bias is a possible explanation for the higher ORs observed for carcinoma in situ or early-stage cancer as compared with more invasive cancer.", 
    "9": "Hyperlipidemia is now established as a major risk factor for causation of coronary heart disease (CHD) in adults; however, there is much debate on the level of coronary risk at which lipid-lowering drugs should be used. These issues of possible harm or lack of benefit from long-term use of lipid-lowering therapy, and cost effectiveness, are also pertinent in the pediatric setting. Evidence from several countries indicates that children have an increasing prevalence of obesity, hyperlipidemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Children who have high serum lipids 'track' these increased levels into adulthood. In some countries there is a trend to screen children for hypercholesterolemia. Family history itself is a poor discriminator in determining which children need to be screened and treated. Estimation of apolipoprotein B and/or apolipoprotein E genotype can improve prediction. Measuring high density lipoprotein cholesterol also helps, but obesity appears to be the best marker for screening children at high risk. These considerations should not cloud the need for case finding and treatment of children with genetic disorders. Low fat diets have been shown to be well tolerated and effective in children; however, there are no major long-term studies demonstrating harm or benefit in those on lipid-lowering drugs. Nevertheless, concerns regarding the psychological effect and the theoretical metabolic effects of long-term lipid lowering remain. Lipid-lowering drugs should be generally restricted to children with genetic disorders of lipid metabolism. Children with diabetes mellitus, hypertension or nonlipid-related inherited disorders leading to premature CHD in adults should be treated with diet, and with lipid-lowering drugs when they reach adulthood. Children with secondary hyperlipidemia should be assessed individually. A number of drugs and nutriceuticals are available for use in children, but only a few drugs are licensed for use in children.", 
    "10": "The statin family of drugs target HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway, and have been used successfully in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia for the past 15 years. Experimental evidence suggests this key biochemical pathway holds an important role in the carcinogenic process. Moreover, statin administration in vivo can provide an oncoprotective effect. Indeed, in vitro studies have shown the statins can trigger cells of certain tumor types, such as acute myelogenous leukemia, to undergo apoptosis in a sensitive and specific manner. Mechanistic studies show bcl-2 expression is down-regulated in transformed cells undergoing apoptosis in response to statin exposure. In addition, the apoptotic response is in part due to the depletion of the downstream product geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, but not farnesyl pyrophosphate or other products of the mevalonate pathway including cholesterol. Clinically, preliminary phase I clinical trials have shown the achievable plasma concentration corresponds to the dose range that can trigger apoptosis of tumor types in vitro. Moreover, little toxicity was evident in vivo even at high concentrations. Clearly, additional clinical trials are warranted to further assess the safety and efficacy of statins as novel and immediately available anti-cancer agents. In this article, the experimental evidence supporting a role for the statin family of drugs to this new application will be reviewed.", 
    "11": "Statins have shown high efficacy in managing hypercholesterolemia in patients requiring chronic drug treatment, particularly those who show comorbidity and thus receive concomitant medication for other pathologies. According to the reported data extensively reviewed in this work, absorption and elimination are the kinetic processes mainly affected by this type of interaction, while distribution and protein binding is only slightly modified. Products (drugs or food) with the ability to affect the activity of protein-mediated transport and/or P450 cytochrome systems, particularly the P-glycoprotein and/or CYP3A4, respectively, are expected to cause pharmacokinetic interactions with statins. The intensity of the interaction is dependent on the statin kinetic profile and the capacity of the coadministered product to alter the systems mentioned above. Modification of the total HMG-CoA inhibitors instead of just the parent drug profile is to be considered when evaluating the clinical relevance of the interaction. Interindividual variability must also be taken into account when extrapolating results from studies performed in small groups of relatively healthy individuals. Patients treated with other drugs that have the potential ability to interact with statins should be monitored.", 
    "12": "Osteoporosis is a major public health problem leading to morbidity and mortality in many individuals. Treatment for osteoporosis has generally relied on mechanisms that decrease osteoclastic bone resorption. This review outlines new evidence that the cholesterol synthetic pathway may be important in bone metabolism and that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors or statins may increase bone formation.", 
    "13": "An experimental observation reported that statins increase bone formation in rodents and that statins have an important role for the cholesterol synthetic pathway in bone formation. This may be via potent bone-forming growth factors, the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). Subsequent epidemiological studies (including a meta-analysis of 8 studies) have suggested that statin use may be associated with increased bone mineral density (BMD) and decreased fracture risk in humans. However, more recently published studies have challenged the effect on fracture risk.", 
    "14": "The effect of statins on bone mineral density and fracture risk in retrospective studies suggests an exciting new direction for research in bone formation that may lead to advances in the therapy of osteoporosis.", 
    "15": "Hypercholesterolemia is considered an important risk factor in coronary artery disease. Thus the possibility of controlling de novo synthesis of endogenous cholesterol, which is nearly two-thirds of total body cholesterol, represents an effective way of lowering plasma cholesterol levels. Statins, fungal secondary metabolites, selectively inhibit hydroxymethyl glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the first enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. The mechanism involved in controlling plasma cholesterol levels is the reversible inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase by statins, related to the structural similarity of the acid form of the statins to HMG-CoA, the natural substrate of the enzymatic reaction. Currently there are five statins in clinical use. Lovastatin and pravastatin (mevastatin derived) are natural statins of fungal origin, while symvastatin is a semi-synthetic lovastatin derivative. Atorvastatin and fluvastatin are fully synthetic statins, derived from mevalonate and pyridine, respectively. In addition to the principal natural statins, several related compounds, monacolins and dihydromonacolins, isolated fungal intermediate metabolites, have also been characterized. All natural statins possess a common polyketide portion, a hydroxy-hexahydro naphthalene ring system, to which different side chains are linked. The biosynthetic pathway involved in statin production, starting from acetate units linked to each other in head-to-tail fashion to form polyketide chains, has been elucidated by both early biogenetic investigations and recent advances in gene studies. Natural statins can be obtained from different genera and species of filamentous fungi. Lovastatin is mainly produced by Aspergillus terreus strains, and mevastatin by Penicillium citrinum. Pravastatin can be obtained by the biotransformation of mevastatin by Streptomyces carbophilus and simvastatin by a semi-synthetic process, involving the chemical modification of the lovastatin side chain. The hypocholesterolemic effect of statins lies in the reduction of the very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) and LDL involved in the translocation of cholesterol, and in the increase in the high-density lipoproteins (HDL), with a subsequent reduction of the LDL- to HDL-cholesterol ratio, the best predictor of atherogenic risk. The use of statins can lead to a reduction in coronary events related to hypercholesterolemia, but the relationship between benefit and risk, and any possible interaction with other drugs, must be taken into account.", 
    "16": "Elevated homocysteine levels are associated with increased coronary risk, and it has been suggested that homocysteine screening may provide a method to identify high-risk patients for aggressive primary prevention.", 
    "17": "Homocysteine was measured at baseline and after 1 year among 5569 participants in the Air Force/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention Study (AFCAPS/TexCAPS), a randomized trial of lovastatin in the primary prevention of acute coronary events. The effects of homocysteine, LDL cholesterol, and lovastatin on risk were assessed over 5.2 years of trial follow-up. Median baseline homocysteine levels were significantly higher among study participants who subsequently had acute coronary events compared with those who did not (12.1 versus 10.9 micro;mol/L, P<0.001). The relative risks of future events from lowest (referent) to highest quartile of homocysteine were 1.0, 1.6, 1.6, and 2.2 (P<0.001). These effects were similar among those allocated to lovastatin and those allocated to placebo and were modestly attenuated after adjustment for other traditional risk factors. As predicted, the subgroup of participants with elevated LDL cholesterol and elevated homocysteine levels were at high risk and benefited greatly from statin therapy (relative risk, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.75; number needed to treat=26). However, in contrast to findings in this trial for C-reactive protein, homocysteine evaluation did not help to define low LDL subgroups with different responses to lovastatin therapy.",

    "19": "Tissue factor plays a pivotal role in thrombus formation in acute coronary syndromes. However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying tissue factor expression are poorly understood. Statins are effective in patients with acute coronary syndromes. Hence, the aim of this study was to clarify in human endothelial cells the signaling pathways of thrombin-induced tissue factor expression and potential inhibitory effects of statins.", 
    "20": "In human aortic endothelial cells, simvastatin prevented tissue factor induction by thrombin (4 U/mL) in a concentration-dependent manner. The increase in tissue factor activity on the cell surface was also blocked by simvastatin. Simvastatin also prevented the upregulation of tissue factor expression and activity in human aortic smooth muscle cells. Mevalonate (100 micromol/L) reversed the inhibitory effect of simvastatin on tissue factor expression. Thrombin induced rapid activation of Rho A and p38 MAP kinase. The Rho-kinase inhibitor Y-27632 and the p38 MAP kinase inhibitor SB203580 prevented tissue factor induction. Akt was dephosphorylated by thrombin; the phosphoinositol 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin enhanced its dephosphorylation as well as thrombin-induced tissue factor expression. Simvastatin prevented thrombin-induced Rho A activation but not p38 MAP kinase activation. Akt dephosphorylation by thrombin was blocked by both simvastatin and Y-27632.", 
    "21": "Endothelial tissue factor induction by thrombin is regulated by Rho/Rho-kinase, Akt, and p38 MAP kinase. Simvastatin prevents its induction through inhibition of Rho/Rho-kinase and activation of Akt. These findings provide new insights into the action of statins in acute coronary syndromes.",

    "26": "The reduction in LDL was similar for the two statins, except at the highest dose of atorvastatin (41 vs. 47%). The increase in HDL tended to be more pronounced in the simvastatin group, significantly so on the highest dose of atorvastatin (P < 0.05). CRP and SAA was significantly reduced by atorvastatin, whilst no reduction was seen for simvastatin. There was a significant difference in treatment effects between the two statins. Both statins caused a reduction in SPLA2. For IL-6 and ICAM-1 only small and inconsistent reductions were observed for both statins.",

Patients with diabetes have several risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Our objective was to quantify the prevalence of pharmacological cardiovascular prevention at admission and relate such treatment to short and long-term mortality following AMI in patients with and without diabetes.", 
    "29": "All patients discharged from the Department of Internal Medicine at Helsingborg Hospital in 1996 and 1997 with a principal diagnosis of AMI were included in the study. Patients were divided into two groups according to the presence or absence of diabetes. Cardiovascular risk factors, on-going medication, type of ward following admission, peak creatine kinase MB mass (CKMB) and immediate treatment were registered. Information about death was obtained from the national register. Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed for life-expectancy.", 
    "30": "A total of 673 patients with AMI were registered, of which 117 (17.4%) had diabetes. No differences in 30 days (17.1% vs. 15.3%) or 1-year (24.8% vs. 27.4%) mortality were seen between the diabetes and control groups, whereas the 2-year mortality was significantly higher in the diabetes group (40.2% vs. 29.1%). Cardiovascular risk factors occurred more often in the diabetes group and the use of aspirin, ACE-inhibitors, statins and diuretics was significantly more frequent. In patients treated with aspirin, in combination with either statin or angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitor, or both, no differences were seen in 30 days, 1 or 2-year mortality between groups.", 
    "31": "In contrast to earlier studies we did not find an increased 30 days and 1-year mortality in patients with diabetes suffering from AMI. This discrepancy was linked to a higher frequency of pharmacological cardiovascular prevention, a finding supporting the hypothesis that survival of a diabetes patient after AMI could be affected by factors operating before the infarction.", 
    "32": "The active forms of all marketed hydroxymethylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase inhibitors share a common dihydroxy heptanoic or heptenoic acid side chain. In this study, we present evidence for the formation of acyl glucuronide conjugates of the hydroxy acid forms of simvastatin (SVA), atorvastatin (AVA), and cerivastatin (CVA) in rat, dog, and human liver preparations in vitro and for the excretion of the acyl glucuronide of SVA in dog bile and urine. Upon incubation of each statin (SVA, CVA or AVA) with liver microsomal preparations supplemented with UDP-glucuronic acid, two major products were detected. Based on analysis by high-pressure liquid chromatography, UV spectroscopy, and/or liquid chromatography (LC)-mass spectrometry analysis, these metabolites were identified as a glucuronide conjugate of the hydroxy acid form of the statin and the corresponding delta-lactone. By means of an LC-NMR technique, the glucuronide structure was established to be a 1-O-acyl-beta-D-glucuronide conjugate of the statin acid. The formation of statin glucuronide and statin lactone in human liver microsomes exhibited modest intersubject variability (3- to 6-fold; n = 10). Studies with expressed UDP glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) revealed that both UGT1A1 and UGT1A3 were capable of forming the glucuronide conjugates and the corresponding lactones for all three statins. Kinetic studies of statin glucuronidation and lactonization in liver microsomes revealed marked species differences in intrinsic clearance (CL(int)) values for SVA (but not for AVA or CVA), with the highest CL(int) observed in dogs, followed by rats and humans. Of the statins studied, SVA underwent glucuronidation and lactonization in human liver microsomes, with the lowest CL(int) (0.4 microl/min/mg of protein for SVA versus approximately 3 microl/min/mg of protein for AVA and CVA). Consistent with the present in vitro findings, substantial levels of the glucuronide conjugate (approximately 20% of dose) and the lactone form of SVA [simvastatin (SV); approximately 10% of dose] were detected in bile following i.v. administration of [(14)C]SVA to dogs. The acyl glucuronide conjugate of SVA, upon isolation from an in vitro incubation, underwent spontaneous cyclization to SV. Since the rate of this lactonization was high under conditions of physiological pH, the present results suggest that the statin lactones detected previously in bile and/or plasma following administration of SVA to animals or of AVA or CVA to animals and humans, might originate, at least in part, from the corresponding acyl glucuronide conjugates. Thus, acyl glucuronide formation, which seems to be a common metabolic pathway for the hydroxy acid forms of statins, may play an important, albeit previously unrecognized, role in the conversion of active HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors to their latent delta-lactone forms.", 
    "33": "The expression of tissue factor (TF), mainly by infiltrated inflammatory cells, has been shown to be responsible for the thrombogenicity associated with atheroma. The contribution of the nonlipid-related effects of statins to the clinical benefits of statin therapy is currently under intense investigation. In this study, we evaluated the ability of fluvastatin to modulate TF expression and macrophage accumulation in rabbit carotid intimal lesions independently of cholesterol lowering. Male rabbits were fed for 30 days a 1% cholesterol-rich diet with or without fluvastatin at 5 mg/kg per day. Two weeks from the start of treatment, a silastic collar was placed around the carotid artery. Fifteen days later, the animals were killed, and carotid segments were excised and processed. The atherogenic diet caused a consistent increase in plasma cholesterol levels (610+/-231 mg/dL versus 50+/-9 mg/dL at baseline), which were not affected by fluvastatin (603+/-248 mg/dL). In the rabbits fed a high cholesterol diet without fluvastatin, an intimal lesion with macrophage accumulation and TF expression was detected. Fluvastatin significantly reduced TF and macrophage content of the lesion (-50% for both). Results indicate that fluvastatin may attenuate the inflammatory and thrombogenic potential of atherosclerotic lesions through a mechanism(s) other than cholesterol reduction, providing new insight regarding the complex mode of action of statins.", 
    "34": "Cerivastatin is an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase. It inhibits the biosynthesis of cholesterol and its precursors: farnesyl pyrophosphate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), which are involved in Ras and RhoA cell signaling, respectively. Statins induce greater protection against vascular risk than that expected by cholesterol reduction. Therefore, cerivastatin could protect plaque against rupture, an important cause of ischemic events. In this study, the effect of cerivastatin was tested on angiogenesis because it participates in plaque progression and plaque destabilization. Cerivastatin inhibits in vitro the microvascular endothelial cell proliferation induced by growth factors, whereas it has no effect on unstimulated cells. This growth arrest occurs at the G(1)/S phase and is related to the increase of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21(Waf1/Cip1). These effects are reversed by GGPP, suggesting that the inhibitory effect of cerivastatin is related to RhoA inactivation. This mechanism was confirmed by RhoA delocalization from cell membrane to cytoplasm and actin fiber depolymerization, which are also prevented by GGPP. It was also shown that RhoA-dependent inhibition of cell proliferation is mediated by the inhibition of focal adhesion kinase and Akt activations. Moreover, cerivastatin inhibits in vivo angiogenesis in matrigel and chick chorioallantoic membrane models. These results demonstrate the antiangiogenic activity of statins and suggest that it may contribute to their therapeutic benefits in the progression and acute manifestations of atherosclerosis.", 
    "35": "Interleukin (IL)-6 plays an important role in the pathogenesis of coronary heart disease (CHD). Two functional polymorphisms in the IL-6 promoter have been identified (-174G>C and -572G>C), with both the rare alleles being associated with higher plasma levels of IL-6 after bypass surgery and one of them (-174G>C) associated with CHD risk. We have studied the contribution of these polymorphisms to CHD risk in the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS), a primary prevention trial that demonstrated the effectiveness of pravastatin in reducing morbidity and mortality from CHD. Four hundred ninety-eight cases (consisting of individuals experiencing a cardiovascular event during 4.8 years of follow-up) and 1109 controls (individuals matched for age and smoking habits) were genotyped. In the placebo group, there was no significant evidence of higher risk associated with the -174CC genotype compared with the GG+GC group. However, in the pravastatin-treated group, CC homozygotes had a significantly lower risk of CHD compared with the GG+GC placebo group (odds ratio 0.46, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.79), and this remained statistically significant after adjustment for classic risk factors. Compared with the GG+GC group, men with the CC genotype had modestly, but not significantly, higher baseline levels of IL-6, C-reactive protein, or fibrinogen but showed a significantly greater fall in LDL cholesterol with statin treatment (P=0.036). The -572G>C polymorphism was not significantly associated with any plasma trait or CHD risk. Thus, in subjects under pravastatin treatment, the -174CC genotype was associated with a lower risk of CHD. These results demonstrate the importance of the inflammatory system in determining the risk of CHD and support the nonlipid effect of statins on risk.", 
    "36": "We evaluated a possible interaction between statins and inflammation in 1,246 patients with angiographically diagnosed coronary artery disease. Four different inflammatory markers were determined: high, sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (p = 0.001), fibrinogen (p = 0.006), von Willebrand factor (p = 0.006), and leukocyte count (p = 0.03); these levels were significantly higher among the 88 patients who died of cardiac causes during follow-up (median 2.9 years) than among survivors. In a multivariate backward stepwise Cox regression mode, only hs-CRP was evaluated to be a significant predictor of death from coronary artery disease. This prediction was lost in statin-treated patients. Compared with patients receiving statin medication, patients without statins did not have increased cardiac mortality (even when low-density lipoprotein [LDL] levels were >125 mg/dl) when hs-CRP levels were not elevated. In contrast, patients without statins and elevated hs-CRP (top quartile) had a 2.3-fold increase in risk for fatal coronary events, independent of LDL levels. In conclusion, only elevated hs-CRP was selected as an independent predictor of death. Statin therapy is associated with elevated hs-CRP, with a risk reduction for fatal coronary events, independent of LDL levels; this, in part, may be explained by the anti-inflammatory effects on atherosclerosis.", 
    "37": "The effects of liquid chromatography mobile phase buffer contents on the ionization and fragmentation of drug molecules in liquid chromatographic/ionspray tandem mass spectrometric (LC/MS/MS) determination were evaluated for simvastatin (SV) and its hydroxy acid (SVA). The objective was to improve further the sensitivity for SV by overcoming the unfavorable condition caused by the formation of multiple major adduct ions and multiple major fragment ions when using ammonium as LC mobile phase buffer. Mobile phases (70:30 acetonitrile-buffer, 2 mM, pH 4.5) with buffers made from ammonium, hydrazine or alkyl (methyl, ethyl, dimethyl or trimethyl)-substituted ammonium acetate were evaluated. Q1 scan and product ion scan spectra were obtained for SV in each of the mobile phases under optimized conditions. The results showed that, with the alkylammonium buffers, the alkylammonium-adducted SV was observed as the only major molecular ion, while the formation of other adduct ions ([M + H](+), [M + Na](+) and [M + K](+)) was successfully suppressed. On the other hand, product ion spectra with a single major fragment ion were not observed for any of the alkylammonium-adducted SVs. The affinity of the alkylammoniums to SV and the basicity of the alkylamines are believed to be factors influencing the formation and abundance of molecular and fragment ions, respectively. Methylammonium acetate provided the most favorable condition among all the buffers evaluated and improved the sensitivity several-fold for SV in LC/MS/MS quantitation compared with that obtained using ammonium acetate buffer. Better precision for SV in both Q1 and SRM scans was observed when using methylammonium buffer compared with those using ammonium buffer. The mobile phase buffer contents did not seem to affect the ionization, fragmentation and chromatography of SVA. The results of this evaluation can be applied to similar situations with other organic molecules in ionspray LC/MS/MS determination.", 
    "38": "Plasma concentrations of cellular adhesion molecules are associated with atherosclerotic diseases and major cardiovascular risk factors. It was shown that LDL-apheresis with dextran sulfate lowers the levels of E-selectin and ICAM-1 in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. The effects of different LDL-apheresis methods have not been studied yet. Cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, fibrinogen, and the adhesion molecules E-selectin, VCAM-1, and ICAM-1 were measured in 20 patients with coronary heart disease and severe hyperlipoproteinemia immediately before and after regular LDL-apheresis. Treatment was performed by different apheresis methods (direct absorption, DA, n = 6; dextran sulfate adsorption, DS, n = 7; heparin precipitation, HP, n = 7). Rebound data of adhesion molecule levels were obtained from 2 patients of each group. Lipids were reduced similarly in all groups. The concentrations of all adhesion molecules were lowered during apheresis. The reduction of E-selectin (-31 +/- 7 vs. -6 +/- 5 and -6 +/- 5%, respectively, P < 0.001) was most prominent in the patients treated by heparin precipitation. Depending on the method of LDL-apheresis, the concentrations of VCAM-1 and E-selectin in the outlets of the LDL-apheresis columns were significantly lower compared to the concentration in the inlets. Plasma concentrations of adhesion molecules increased to their pre-apheresis values within 2 to 4 days following LDL-apheresis. The reductions of adhesion molecule levels observed during LDL-apheresis are at least partly due to adsorption to the LDL-apheresis column. The extent of absorption depends on the principle of extracorporeal LDL elimination.", 
    "39": "The effects of pravastatin (pravachol) compared with gemfibrozil on cholesterol-rich and trigylceride-rich lipoproteins were evaluated in this multi-centered trial. Following an 8-12 week prerandomization phase, 136 patients with NIDDM and hypercholesterolemia were randomized to receive either pravastatin 40 mg or gemfibrozil 1200 mg daily for 16 weeks. The reduction of total cholesterol (TC), betaquant LDL and LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) was significantly greater in patients treated with pravastatin than with gemfibrozil. However, gemofibrozil treatment resulted in a significantly greater reduction of triglyceride (TG) levels than did treatment with pravastatin. Pravastatin reduced the concentration of apoB (-19.3%, P<0.001) and cholesterol-rich Lp-B (Lp-B+Lp-B; E) particles (-19%, P<0.001) to a significantly greater extent (P<-0.001) than gemfibrozil (-4.1 and -1%, respectively). Both gemfibrozil and pravastatin reduced the concentrations of trigylceride-rich Lp-Bc (-12.2 and -13.3%, respectively) and Lp-A-II;B;C;D;E (-19 and -12.7%, respectively) particles and their characteristic apoC-III constituent (-10.0 and -7.0%, respectively). In contrast, gemfibozil has a greater lowering effect compared with pravastatin on TG levels (-29.6 vs. -6.3%, respectively). Both pravastatin and gemfibrozil significantly increased the levels of apoA-I and, with both drugs, the elevated concentrations of apoA-I were due to significantly increased levels of Lp-A-I;A-II particles. By decreasing both cholesterol-rich Lp-B and triglyceride-rich Lp-Bc particles and increasing HDL-C and Lp-A-I;A-II particles in addition to proven efficacy in decreasing coronary events in NIDDM patients, pravastatin appears to be an appropriate choice for monotherapy in a broad range of diabetic patients with Type IIA and Type IIB hyperlipoproteinemias. These results also showed that direct measurement of lipoprotein family of particles provides important information not only about the composition but also the type and number of apoA- and apoB-containing lipoprotein particles.", 
    "40": "The study was aimed at investigating the effects, after treatment for 1 year, of two different statins on the levels of circulating biochemical markers of endothelial function in patients with established coronary heart disease, with the hypothesis that statins might reduce these levels. Twenty-eight patients were randomized to treatment with atorvastatin and 30 to simvastatin for 1 year. The starting dose in both groups was 20 mg/day. Soluble forms of P-selectin, E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) were determined to assess inflammatory activity of the endothelium, and tissue plasminogen activator antigen (tPAag), von Willebrand factor and thrombomodulin for evaluation of the haemostatic function. In the total study population there were significantly reduced levels after 1 year treatment in ICAM-1 (P<0.001), E-selectin (P=0.022) and P-selectin (P<0.001), whereas a significant increase was observed in VCAM-1 (P=0.003). Almost the same pattern was seen within both groups although the increase in VCAM-1 was only seen in the simvastatin group (P=0.017). An overall reduction in tPAag was further observed (P=0.048). The reduction in proinflammatory and to some extent haemostatic markers of endothelial function after 1 year treatment with either simvastatin or atorvastatin may be indicative of a less activated state of the endothelium which possibly may contribute to modulation of the progression of atherosclerosis.", 
    "41": "Enhanced and prolonged postprandial lipaemia is implicated in coronary and carotid artery disease. This study assessed the effects of atorvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor, on postprandial plasma concentrations of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs). Sixteen middle-aged men with combined hyperlipidaemia (baseline low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and plasma triglyceride concentrations (median (interquartile range) of 4.54 (4.17-5.26)) and 2.66 (2.04-3.20) mmol/l, respectively) and previous myocardial infarction were randomised to atorvastatin 40 mg or placebo once daily for 8 weeks in a double-blind, cross-over design. The apolipoprotein (apo) B-48 and B-100 contents were determined in subfractions of TRLs as a measure of chylomicron remnant and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) particle concentrations (expressed as mg apo B-48 or apo B-100 per litre of plasma), in the fasting state and after intake of a mixed meal. Atorvastatin treatment reduced significantly the fasting plasma concentrations of VLDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and VLDL triglycerides (median% change) by 29, 44 and 27%, respectively, and increased high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol by 19%, compared with baseline. The postprandial plasma concentrations of large (Svedberg flotation rate (Sf) 60-400) and small (Sf 20-60) VLDLs and chylomicron remnants were almost halved compared with baseline (mean 0-6 h plasma concentrations were reduced by 48% for Sf 60-400 apo B-100, by 46% for Sf 60-400 apo B-48, by 46% for Sf 20-60 apo B-100 and by 27% for Sf 20-60 apo B-48), and the postprandial triglyceridaemia was reduced by 23% during active treatment. In conclusion, atorvastatin 40 mg once daily causes profound reductions of postprandial plasma concentrations of all TRLs in combined hyperlipidaemic patients with premature coronary artery disease.", 
    "42": "Low density lipoprotein receptor deficient (LDLR-KO) and apolipoprotein E deficient (apo E-KO) mice both develop hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis by different mechanisms. The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of simvastatin on cholesterol levels, endothelial dysfunction, and aortic lesions in these two models of experimental atherosclerosis. Male LDLR-KO mice fed a high cholesterol (HC; 1%) diet developed atherosclerosis at 8 months of age with hypercholesterolemia. The addition of simvastatin (300 mg/kg daily) to the HC diet for 2 more months lowered total cholesterol levels by approximately 57% and reduced aortic plaque area by approximately 15% compared with the LDLR-KO mice continued on HC diet alone, P<0.05. Simvastatin treatment also improved acetylcholine (ACh)-induced endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation in isolated aortic rings, which was associated with an increase in NOS-3 expression by approximately 88% in the aorta measured by real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), P<0.05. In contrast, in age-matched male apo E-KO mice fed a normal diet, the same treatment of simvastatin elevated serum total cholesterol by approximately 35%, increased aortic plaque area by approximately 15%, and had no effect on endothelial function. These results suggest that the therapeutic effects of simvastatin may depend on the presence of a functional apolipoprotein E.", 
    "43": "Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is an autoimmune disease of the liver with inflammation of small and middle-sized bile ducts. Serum lipids are frequently elevated, but the use of a lipid lowering drug therapy in PBC is still a matter of debate. Application of an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase in hypercholesterolemic PBC patients was therefore the subject of the present study.", 
    "44": "Six female patients (aged 46.5 (32-61) years; median (range)) were treated with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin (5 or 20 mg/day). Levels of serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were determined prior to and after 2 months of treatment. Concentrations of serum markers of cholestasis, antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA), and immunoglobulins A, G and M were also assessed.", 
    "45": "Simvastatin significantly (P<0.05) reduced serum levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, alkaline phosphatase, -glutamyltransferase, and immunoglobulin M (by 19, 26, 12, 37 and 14%, respectively).", 
    "46": "The lipid lowering potency of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin was confirmed in hypercholesterolemic patients with PBC. The drug might also prove useful as modulator of cholestasis and of immune response in this disease.", 
    "47": "There is no known pharmacological therapy for calcific aortic valvular sclerosis or stenosis. Because leaflet calcification occurs in areas of lipoprotein deposition, we hypothesised that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG COA) reductase inhibitors (statins) might slow aortic valve calcium (AVC) accumulation. We retrospectively identified 65 patients who had undergone two electron-beam computed tomography scans at a mean (SD) interval of 2.5 (1.6) years. 28 (43%) patients were receiving statins. Patients who were treated with statins had a 62-63% lower median rate of AVC accumulation (p=0.006) and 44-49% fewer statin patients had definite AVC progression (p=0.043). These findings suggest that statins may decrease AVC accumulation.", 
    "48": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors are a frequently prescribed class of drugs that are generally well tolerated by most patients. A rare, yet serious side effect associated with these drugs is rhabdomyolysis. Although all HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors can cause this adverse effect, prevalence may differ among specific agents. Over a 16-month period, in three hospitals, 11 patients experienced cerivastatin-induced rhabdomyolysis, but no cases of rhabdomyolysis associated with any other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors were reported.", 
    "49": "The oxidation of fluvastatin sodium on a glassy carbon electrode has been studied by use of a variety of voltammetric techniques. Different conditions were investigated to optimize the determination of fluvastatin sodium. The dependence of the intensities of currents and potentials on pH, concentration, scan rate, and nature of the buffer was investigated. Oxidation of fluvastatin sodium was found to be diffusion-controlled and irreversible. The best results for the determination of fluvastatin sodium were obtained by using differential pulse and square-wave voltammetric techniques in Britton-Robinson buffer at pH 10.04. Differential pulse and square-wave voltammetry at a glassy carbon electrode resulted in linear calibration in the range 8x10(-6) to 6x10(-4) mol L(-1) and detection limits of 1.07x10(-6) and 7.99x10(-7) mol L(-1), respectively. The proposed methods were successfully applied to the determination of the drug in capsules and biological fluids. Excipients did not interfere with the determination. Statistical validation revealed that the methods were free from significant systematic errors.", 
    "50": "Osteoporosis in women has received a substantial amount of attention, but its impact in men is also significant and noteworthy. Those men who benefit from treatment for prostate cancer with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) may also be at a higher risk for osteoporosis. Pharmacologic approaches to reduce this risk have received some attention. For example, agents such as bisphosphonates, estrogen receptor-binding drugs (diethylstilbestrol, tamoxifen, and raloxifene), calcitonin, and fluoride are some of the more promising interventions that have been previously outlined. In addition, statin drugs, or hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, have recently been hypothesized to lower osteoporosis risk. However, complementary therapies, which may also have an impact on reducing osteoporosis risk, have not received attention. Dietary and supplemental calcium and vitamin D have been shown, in some preliminary investigations, to maintain bone density in women and men. Numerous healthy and affordable dietary sources of this mineral and vitamin exist, and large intakes can be realistically achieved through proper education. Similarly, the supplemental dosages required to impact risk have been moderate, appear to be safe, are of low cost, and thus may provide an additional route for reducing risk, especially if these interventions are initiated at the start of medical treatment. More studies in men receiving ADT are needed because the existing work has mostly focused on men without castrate levels of male hormone. Additionally, many studies with conventional and nonconventional agents have only focused on individuals with baseline osteoporosis, rather than normal bone mineral densities or osteopenia. Other promising complementary therapies, such as weight-bearing exercise and abstaining from smoking, may also be of benefit. Newer estrogenic-type supplements (eg, ipriflavone) appear interesting and have some preliminary data, but more research is desperately required to determine their actual impact and potential for adverse effects (such as lymphocytopenia from a recent trial). Simple, inexpensive, and potentially effective dietary and supplemental approaches to reduce the risk of osteoporosis in men exist, and they should be discussed with patients. Whether these approaches effectively reduce the risk of osteoporosis in men receiving androgen ablation remains to be determined. The possibility is intriguing, and future research is needed. In the meantime, it is important to keep in mind that these complementary approaches are, at the very least, an integral part of the conventional options used today to the reduce the risk of osteoporosis in men and women.", 
    "51": "Atorvastatin is a common option among the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors for the treatment of lipid disorders because of its excellent lipid-lowering efficacy and overall safety profile. Although these agents can rarely cause rhabdomyolysis by themselves, macrolides, among other agents, have been demonstrated to increase the likelihood of this via inhibition of CYP metabolism of the lipid agent. This study investigated the potential for azithromycin and clarithromycin to inhibit the metabolism of atorvastatin. Although there was no interaction between azithromycin and atorvastatin, clarithromycin did have a significant effect on atorvastatin pharmacokinetic parameters. When coadministered, clarithromycin raised subject exposure (AUC24) by 82% and peak plasma concentrations by 56%. These data suggest that while azithromycin appears to be safe to coadminister with atorvastatin, clarithromycin should be avoided in patients taking this and similarly metabolized HMG-CoA inhibitors.", 
    "52": "Statins inhibit the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, reduce the serum level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and are extensively prescribed to prevent cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. Few systemic adverse effects, such as pseudopolymyositis, lupus-like syndromes, and anecdotal hypersensitivity pneumonitis, have been reported. A simvastatin-induced diffuse interstitial pneumonia associated with a nonspecific interstitial pneumonia pattern at histological analysis is repoted here. Ultrastructural analysis showed a diffuse cytoplasmic accumulation of intralysosomial lamellar inclusions in type II pneumonocytes, histiocytes and endothelial cells, suggesting a shared pathogenesis with amphiphilic drug-induced toxic lung injury. Because statins are increasingly prescribed, statin-induced interstitial lung disorders may be more frequently observed and early recognition will be required.", 
    "53": "Dyslipoproteinemia associated with type 2 diabetes comprises hypertriglyceridemia caused by reduced insulin sensitivity, and consequently, low HDL levels and an increase in the proportion of small dense LDL particles. In addition, in both type 1 and 2 diabetes glycated LDL is formed in the presence of high plasma glucose levels. These lipoprotein disorders are all atherogenic and are responsible for the distinctly increased risk for cardiovascular disease in diabetics. Intensive glucose-lowering measures result in lower rates of micro- and macro-angiopathies in both types of diabetes. The benefit of additional lipid-lowering measures has not yet been confirmed by appropriate investigations. However, subgroup analyses from two large intervention trials do demonstrate that mortality from coronary heart disease may be substantially reduced. LDL cholesterol levels in diabetics should not exceed 115 mg/dl (3 mmol/l), and fasting triglycerides should be lower than 180 mg/dL (2 mmol/l).", 
    "54": "In order to investigate the effect of a competitive inhibitor of the HMG-CoA reductase on tumor growth and cholesterol homeostasis of host and non-host mice, we maintained a human lung mucoepidermoid carcinoma (HLMC) in nude mice, treating these animals with Simvastatin for 33 days. The drug increased the total activity of hepatic HMG-CoA reductase without affecting the cholesterolemia. Non-treated host animals presented lower serum, tissue and microsomal hepatic cholesterol than non-host animals. These differences disappeared when animals were treated with Simvastatin, though the induction of the reductase activity at mid-dark was higher in non-host than in host animals. Simvastatin produced no significant effects on both final tumor volume and body weight. Synthesis and cholesterol homeostasis restoration induced by liver and tumoral reductase would account for no effect on the HLMC growth after a long treatment with Simvastatin.", 
    "55": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) exert potent vasculoprotective effects. However, the potential contribution to angiogenesis is controversial. In the present study, we demonstrate that atorvastatin dose-dependently affects endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis. In vivo relevant concentrations of 0.01 to 0.1 micromol/L atorvastatin or mevastatin promote the migration of mature endothelial cells and tube formation. Moreover, atorvastatin also increases migration and the potency to form vessel structures of circulating endothelial progenitor cells, which may contribute to vasculogenesis. In contrast, higher concentrations (>0.1 micromol/L atorvastatin) block angiogenesis and migration by inducing endothelial cell apoptosis. The dose-dependent promigratory and proangiogenic effects of atorvastatin on mature endothelial cells are correlated with the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-Akt pathway, as determined by the phosphorylation of Akt and endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) at Ser1177. In addition, the stimulation of migration and tube formation was blocked by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors. In contrast, the well-established stabilization of eNOS mRNA was achieved only at higher concentrations, suggesting that posttranscriptional activation rather than an increase in eNOS expression mediates the proangiogenic effect of atorvastatin. Taken together, these data suggest that statins exert a double-edged role in angiogenesis signaling by promoting the migration of mature endothelial cells and endothelial progenitor cells at low concentrations, whereas the antiangiogenic effects were achieved only at high concentrations.", 
    "56": "Lowering of serum cholesterol levels by pharmacologic intervention with statins reduces the incidence of cardiovascular events in subjects with and without atherosclerotic manifestations. In an 8-week, randomized, double-blind study we compared the efficacy and safety of the new compound atorvastatin for reducing LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) with placebo in an Asian patient cohort. Patients with LDL-C between 160 mg/dl and 250 mg/dl were randomly assigned to treatment with 10 mg atorvastatin or placebo once daily for 8 weeks. At the end of weeks 4 and 8 of the randomized phase, the serum concentrations of lipid parameters as well as safety parameters were determined. Fifty-four patients (32 males and 22 females) were enrolled. Twenty-six patients were assigned to the treatment group. The primary end-point, LDL-C, was reduced by 40% and 42% after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment in the atorvastatin treated patients (p<0.001). The reductions in total cholesterol and triglycerides were up to 31% and 23%, respectively. The HDL-C levels increased up to 11% (p=0.043). There were no significant adverse events. Transient increases in CPK levels (10 times) without myalgia were identified in 1 patient. Atorvastatin, 10 mg/day produced significant reductions in LDL-C, total cholesterol and triglycerides and an elevation of HDL-C levels when used as an adjunct to diet in hyperlipidemic patients. The majority of the clinical effects could be attained by week 4. The overall safety profile of atorvastatin was similar to that of placebo. Atorvastatin was considered to be well tolerated in this patient cohort.", 
    "57": "There is accumulating evidence that statins have beneficial effects that are independent of their classical actions on lipoproteins. These effects include reductions in inflammation in the vasculature, kidney, and bone. Potential beneficial effects of these agents include enhancement of nitric oxide production in vasculature and the kidney. These agents appear to reduce bone fractures and may improve insulin sensitivity and reduce the likelihood of persons progressing from impaired glucose tolerance to type II diabetes. Potential beneficial pleiotropic effects of statins are covered in this review.", 
    "58": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) therapy reduces cardiovascular risk, mechanisms of which may include diminished arterial inflammation, as suggested by reduction in levels of C-reactive protein (CRP). Because oral estrogens increase CRP in postmenopausal women, with potential inflammatory and thrombotic consequences that could compromise any benefit to cardiovascular risk, we determined whether the coadministration of a statin might modify the estrogenic effect on CRP.", 
    "59": "In a double-blind, 3-period crossover study, 28 postmenopausal women (average LDL cholesterol 163+/-36 mg/dL) were randomly assigned to daily conjugated equine estrogens (CEEs) 0.625 mg, simvastatin 10 mg, or their combination for 6 weeks, with each treatment period separated by 6 weeks. CEEs increased median CRP levels from 0.27 to 0.46 mg/dL, simvastatin decreased CRP from 0.29 to 0.28 mg/dL, and the therapies combined increased CRP from 0.28 to 0.36 mg/dL (all P< or =0.02 versus respective baseline values). Post hoc testing showed that the 29% increase in CRP on the combination of CEEs with simvastatin was significantly less than the 70% increase in CRP on CEEs alone (P<0.05). The effect of combination therapy on CRP levels did not correlate with baseline CRP or with baseline or treatment-induced changes in levels of interleukin-6, lipoproteins, or flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery as a measure of nitric oxide bioactivity.",

Mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) showed that on Day 8 after grafting, the proliferative response of alloreactive T cells against F344 alloantigen in cerivastatin-treated rats was significantly more suppressed than in Lewis rats. The Interleukin-2 concentration of supernatant in MLR cultures in the cerivastatin-treated group was lower than in the control group. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the percentage of CD4-positive cells to infiltrating mononuclear cells was less prominent in the cerivastatin-treated group (9.8% +/- 2.2%) than in the control group (20.9% +/- 3.2%).",

The author considered that a good sense of careful discernment and rapid reference system of medical information are \"essential tools\" for clinical management.", 
    "70": "The most common side-effect of statins, mainly during dose titration, is liver toxicity, In these cases, sufficient control of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HFH) becomes problematical. In patients with intolerance to resins as well, especially in the presence of coronary artery disease (CAD), it is practically impossible to reach the LDL-C treatment goal. This study included seven HFH patients with CAD, who presented with alanine amino transferase levels greater than three times the upper normal limit during dose titration of atorvastatin or simvastatin of from 20 mg/day to 40 mg/day. They could not tolerate concomitant cholestyramine administration, and presented with LDL-C levels significantly higher than the treatment goal (100 mg/dl; 2.6 mmol/l). In these patients, a combination of two statins with different pharmacokinetics (20 mg/day of atorvastatin plus 40mg/day of pravastatin) was administered for a mean period of one year. Efficacy was compared with that of monotherapy with each drug alone and with that of 40 mg of atorvastatin in 13 patients, who could also not tolerate resin co-administration, and that of 40 mg/day of atorvastatin plus 12 g of cholestyramine in 30 patients, with similar pretreatment LDL-C levels. No increase in serum transaminases and no symptom or sign of myopathy was recorded during the administration of the combination of the two statins for a mean period of 12 months. The atorvastatin plus pravastatin regimen was more effective than both monotherapies and equally effective with the 40 mg of atorvastatin and the 40 mg of atorvastatin plus 12 g of cholestyramine regimens in reducing LDL-C (59% vs. 57% and 61%, respectively) and triglyceride levels (31% vs. 32% and 28%, respectively), while it also had a better effect on high density lipoprotein cholesterol (13% vs. 7% and 8%). The data suggest that the atorvastatin-pravastatin combination has a highly beneficial effect on all lipid parameters, without causing hepatotoxicity, in HFH patients with CAD who are sensitive to higher doses of statins in monotherapy. These results require confirmation in larger studies.",

Direct inhibition of Rac GTPase by overexpression of the dominant negative mutant RacN17 or by Clostridium sordellii lethal toxin in rat H9C2 cells inhibited ANF expression by 70+/-4.9% and 78+/-10%, respectively. Inhibition of RhoA by Clostridium botulinum C3 transferase or the dominant negative mutant RhoN19 reduced ANF mRNA by 19+/-11% and 23+/-8%, respectively. To test these findings in vivo, spontaneously hypertensive rats were treated with atorvastatin, leading to a decrease in cardiac Rac1 and RhoA activity as determined by [35S]-GTP gamma S-binding assays by 61+/-16% and 72+/-24%, and downregulation of MLC-2 as well as ANF mRNA expression by 31+/-16% and 80+/-24%, respectively.",

Non-obese, normoglycaemic, normotensive patients with hyperlipidaemia (n = 20) and a reference group of healthy subjects of similar age, sex, and body mass index (n = 20) were evaluated. Patients with other causes of peripheral insulin resistance were excluded. All participants underwent a diagnostic protocol, which included measurements of insulin sensitivity index and other metabolic parameters. Insulin sensitivity was assessed by Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA). Serum insulin levels were tested by radioimmunoassay. Patients were treated with fluvastatin 40 mg once daily for 3 months. Before fluvastatin treatment, fasting serum insulin levels were significantly raised in patients with hyperlipidaemia compared with subjects from the reference group (19.1 +/- 13.4 versus 8.1 +/- 3.4 microIU/ml). The fasting serum insulin levels and HOMA-estimated insulin sensitivity were correlated in the whole group. Correlation analysis showed a significant relationship between HOMA-estimated insulin resistance and plasma cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations. Patients with hyperlipidaemia had reduced insulin sensitivity that was reflected by high serum fasting insulin levels. Anti-hyperlipidaemic treatment with fluvastatin increases insulin sensitivity.",

We have studied the effects of compactin and fluvastatin, two inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, on the expression and activity of the enzyme in the fat body, and on the ootheca formation, ootheca viability, and number of larvae per viable ootheca. Short-term assays showed that both compounds reduce the protein levels and enzymatic activity of HMG-CoA reductase, and long-term experiments revealed that fluvastatin impairs embryo development.",

The statistically significant difference between the two groups was maintained at week 8 and week 16 (P < or = 0.001 at both time points). At week 16, patients receiving atorvastatin had significantly greater reductions from baseline in LDL-cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides and total cholesterol:HDL-cholesterol ratio (all P = 0.0001), and a significantly greater increase from baseline in HDL-cholesterol (P = 0.001) than patients receiving placebo. The overall adverse event profile for atorvastatin was similar to that observed with placebo.",

The primary objective is to investigate whether treatment with the hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, atorvastatin, reduces the incidence of major cardiovascular events. At entry patients have at least one other risk factor for CHD in addition to diabetes, namely current smoking, hypertension, retinopathy, or micro- or macroalbuminuria. At randomization patients have been selected for a serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentration < or = 4.14 mmol/l (160 mg/dl) and triglycerides < or = 6.78 mmol/l (600 mg/dl).

New drug therapies have been introduced in the market aimed at decreasing bone loss and increasing bone formation, with the ultimate goal of decreasing fractures. Currently, there are a variety of agents available for the treatment of osteoporosis. A limited number of case-control studies have suggested that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) may have the potential to reduce the risk of fractures by increasing bone formation, although other studies have failed to show a benefit in fracture reduction. The potential benefit of this therapy is still undetermined because of a lack of randomized, controlled, clinical trials and conflicting data.", 
    "92": "At this time, there are limited data on the role of statins in the treatment of osteoporosis. Practitioners must be cautious when using these agents over other proven conventional therapies. Randomized, controlled, clinical trials are needed to accurately determine the role of these agents in the treatment of osteoporosis.", 
    "93": "Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) is believed to play an important role in the progression of atherosclerosis. Oxidative modification of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is a prerequisite for rapid accumulation of LDL in macrophages and for the formation of foam cells. Because of high antioxidant levels in plasma, LDL oxidation is suggested to occur mainly in the subendothelial space of the arterial wall, where there is the concomitant presence of large amounts of reactive oxygen species generated by endothelial cells and activated leukocytes. After Ox-LDL formation, antibodies against this form of LDL may occur. Auto-antibodies against Ox-LDL (AuAb-Ox-LDL) show directly in in-vivo LDL oxidation. Many studies have indicated that the amount of antibodies in serum is positively correlated to the rate of progression of atherosclerotic plaques.", 
    "94": "In this study the effect of lipid-lowering therapy on the levels of AuAb-Ox-LDL in patients with dyslipidemia was determined using atorvastatin (10 mg/day), and the relationship between the antibodies and plasma total antioxidant status (TAS) and LDL oxidation capacity was also investigated. Serum levels of AuAb-Ox-LDL, lipids, lipoproteins, TAS and susceptibility of LDL to oxidation were determined using lag time in 44 patients with dyslipidemia (29 with hypercholesterolemia and 15 with mixed-type hyperlipidemia).", 
    "95": "After lipid-lowering therapy, serum levels of AuAb-Ox-LDL were found to be significantly decreased, by 18.7%, while lag time and plasma TAS were increased (31.3% and 7.6% respectively) in patients with dyslipidemia. The percentage change in lag time was found to be negatively correlated to the percentage change in AuAb-Ox-LDL (r = -0.31, P < 0.05). The percentage change in lag time also showed a positive correlation with the percentage change in TAS (r = 0.58, P < 0.01). AuAb-Ox-LDL levels decreased by 21.7% in patients with hypercholesterolemia and by 12.6% in patients with mixed-type hyperlipidemia. Also AuAb-Ox-LDL levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia were higher than in those with mixed-type hyperlipidemia (367 +/- 294 compared with 300 +/- 176 mU/l).", 
    "96": "It was concluded that lipid-lowering therapy may contribute to the reduction in levels of AuAb-Ox-LDL and the increase in the antioxidant capacity of plasma LDL and TAS. It was also suggested that the measurement of antibodies against Ox-LDL during lipid-lowering therapy may be used as an important marker for representing in-vivo LDL oxidation and atherosclerotic processes.", 
    "97": "Congenital analbuminaemia, a rare disorder associated with defective albumin synthesis, is characterised by hyperlipidaemia. Administration of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGRI) to analbuminaemic rats have demonstrated no significant effect on plasma lipids, however no published information regarding HMGRI treatment could be found in human subjects. The efficacy, safety and tolerability of Simvastatin was thus investigated in 2 South African patients with analbuminaemia, a 21 year old Caucasian male (H-B) and a 61 year old black male (A-K). In the case of A-K, the lipid profile responded predictably but H-B responded less that expected from general experience with Simvastatin. Both subjects, however, experienced a three- to five-fold increase in creatine kinase. The use of HMGRI's should thus be used cautiously in these patients and it may be advisable to reserve treatment for secondary prevention.", 
    "98": "In previous studies we have shown that the expression of the transforming Ha-ras oncogene in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts stimulates cellular calcium entry, which triggers oscillatory calcium induced calcium release from internal stores. The intracellular calcium oscillations lead to cytoskeletal remodeling by actin stress fiber depolymerization and activation of the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger thus mediating cell swelling and intracellular alkalosis, both important mitogenic signals. This is evidenced by abrogation of Ha-ras induced growth factor independent cell proliferation by interference with any of these events, i.e. by inhibition of cellular calcium entry or inhibition of the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger. As shown in this study, simvastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the key enzyme for cholesterol biosynthesis, is able to prevent these events following the expression of the transforming Ha-ras oncogene. We show, that simvastatin inhibits farnesylation dependent membrane translocation of a CAAX motive bearing yellow fluorescent protein and suppresses Ha-ras stimulated cellular calcium influx, which can be identified as capacitative calcium entry. In addition simvastatin is able to block regulatory volume decrease channels and to suppress the cytoskeletal remodeling, intracellular alkalinization, increase in cell volume and growth factor independent cell proliferation induced by the oncogene. Thus simvastatin is able to prevent crucial cellular events following expression of the transforming Ha-ras oncogene.", 
    "99": "Tocotrienols has been shown to inhibit the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity; however, the published animal and human studies yield conflicting results. We investigated the effects of a 4-week dietary supplement of either gamma-tocotrienol (86% gamma-T3) or a mixture of tocotrienols (29.5% alpha-T3, 3.3% beta-T3, 41.4% gamma-T3, 0.1% delta-T3: mix-T3) on the plasma lipid profile in hamsters receiving a high fat diet.", 
    "100": "The hamsters were randomized into 7 groups: no treatment, 16 mg/day/kg BW simvastatin, 23, 58, 263 mg/day/kg BW gamma-tocotrienol, and 39 or 263 mg/day/kg BW for the mixture of tocotrienols. Plasma lipid levels were measured after 2 and 4 weeks of treatment.", 
    "101": "In all groups treated with tocotrienol total cholesterol levels were decreased, ranging from 7 to 23% after 2 weeks of treatment and from 7 to 15% after 4 weeks. Low-density lipoprotein plasma levels changed accordingly: a decline of 6-37% after 2 weeks and of 12-32% at the end of the study was observed. After 4 weeks of treatment, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein plasma levels were significantly reduced in the 263 mg/day/kg BW mixed tocotrienols and the 58 mg/day/kg BW and 263 mg/day/kg BW gamma-tocotrienol groups when compared to the no treatment group. Plasma triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein levels did not change significantly.", 
    "102": "This study provides further evidence that tocotrienols lower total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein plasma levels in hamsters and that gamma-tocotrienol is a more potent agent than a mixture of tocotrienols.", 
    "103": "Many bacteria employ the nonmevalonate pathway for synthesis of isopentenyl diphosphate, the monomer unit for isoprenoid biosynthesis. However, gram-positive cocci exclusively use the mevalonate pathway, which is essential for their growth (E. I. Wilding et al., J. Bacteriol. 182:4319-4327, 2000). Enzymes of the mevalonate pathway are thus potential targets for drug intervention. Uniquely, the enterococci possess a single open reading frame, mvaE, that appears to encode two enzymes of the mevalonate pathway, acetoacetyl-coenzyme A thiolase and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. Western blotting revealed that the mvaE gene product is a single polypeptide in Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Enterococcus hirae. The mvaE gene was cloned from E. faecalis and was expressed with an N-terminal His tag in Escherichia coli. The gene product was then purified by nickel affinity chromatography. As predicted, the 86.5-kDa mvaE gene product catalyzed both the acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase and HMG-CoA reductase reactions. Temperature optima, DeltaH(a) and K(m) values, and pH optima were determined for both activities. Kinetic studies of acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase implicated a ping-pong mechanism. CoA acted as an inhibitor competitive with acetyl-CoA. A millimolar K(i) for a statin drug confirmed that E. faecalis HMG-CoA reductase is a class II enzyme. The oxidoreductant was NADP(H). A role for an active-site histidine during the first redox step of the HMG-CoA, reductase reaction was suggested by the ability of diethylpyrocarbonate to block formation of mevalonate from HMG-CoA, but not from mevaldehyde. Sequence comparisons with other HMG-CoA reductases suggest that the essential active-site histidine is His756. The mvaE gene product represents the first example of an HMG-CoA reductase fused to another enzyme.", 
    "104": "HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitors (statins) reduce cardiac event rates in patients with stable coronary heart disease. Withdrawal of chronic statin treatment during acute coronary syndromes may impair vascular function independent of lipid-lowering effects and thus increase cardiac event rate.", 
    "105": "We investigated the effects of statins on the cardiac event rate in 1616 patients of the Platelet Receptor Inhibition in Ischemic Syndrome Management (PRISM) study who had coronary artery disease and chest pain in the previous 24 hours. We recorded death and nonfatal myocardial infarction during the 30-day follow-up. Baseline clinical characteristics did not differ among 1249 patients without statin therapy, 379 patients with continued statin therapy, and 86 patients with discontinued statin therapy after hospitalization. Statin therapy was associated with a reduced event rate at 30-day follow-up compared with patients without statins (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.49 [95% CI, 0.21 to 0.86]; P=0.004). If the statin therapy was withdrawn after admission, cardiac risk increased compared with patients who continued to receive statins (2.93 [95% CI, 1.64 to 6.27]; P=0.005) and tended to be higher compared with patients who never received statins (1.69 [95% CI, 0.92 to 3.56]; P=0.15). This was related to an increased event rate during the first week after onset of symptoms and was independent of cholesterol levels. In a multivariate model, troponin T elevation (P=0.005), ST changes (P=0.02), and continuation of statin therapy (P=0.008) were the only independent predictors of patient outcome.",

Those with LDL-C <125 compared with > or =125 mg/dL were more likely to be diabetic (15% versus 9%), hypertensive (46 versus 41%), and male (89% versus 83%); they had higher triglycerides (169 versus 154 mg/dL), lower HDL-C (36.5 versus 38 mg/dL), and similar body mass index (27 kg/m2); and pravastatin lowered their LDL-C by 36 mg/dL (32%) versus 45 mg/dL (29%). During 5.8-year (mean) follow-up, HDL-C and triglycerides were both significantly stronger predictors of recurrent CHD events in participants with LDL-C <125 than > or =125 mg/dL. In diabetic participants with low LDL-C, pravastatin decreased CHD events from 34% to 22% (relative risk, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.83; P=0.004), significantly different from the effect in nondiabetic participants with low LDL-C (P interaction, 0.005) (event rate, 21%; relative risk, 1.06 [95% CI, 0.89 to 1.27]). There were trends toward risk reduction in smokers and in those with low HDL-C, <40 mg/dL.", 
    "109": "Among patients with CHD who have low LDL-C, diabetics have much higher subsequent CHD event rates than do nondiabetics.

    "113": "Despite equivalent doses of statin, AA were less likely to meet NCEP-II recommendations. This occurred even though AA had more clinic visits and lipid profiles. Our intervention did not narrow this racial gap in compliance rates. Possible explanations include: 1) variations in patient compliance; 2) impact of differences in lifestyle (DM, obesity, and smoking); and 3) the need for more intensive drug therapy in patients starting with a higher baseline LDL-C.", 
    "114": "Purpose of the present study was to evaluate the myopathy risk using a urethane infusion method following oral administration of five kinds of commercial HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A) reductase inhibitors (HCRIs), (pravastatin (PV), simvastatin (SV), cerivastatin (CeV), atorvastatin (AV), and fluvastatin (FV)) alone or with coadministration of bezafibrate (BF). The solubility of HCRIs in various solvents was determined as a criterion of the physicochemical property. The plasma creatine phosphokinase (CPK) level as a marker of myopathy in normal rats was screened under urethane infusion after oral administration of HCRI alone or with BF coadministration. Also, renal tissue specimens were prepared and the myoglobin remaining in the tissue was visualized by the labeled avidin-biotin technique. The plasma CPK level in normal rats under urethane infusion following oral administration of five kinds of HCRI increased as the dose of HCRI increased, and coadministration of BF further increased the CPK level for each drug. The risk of myopathy evaluated from the CPK level was ranked as follows: CeV>FV>AV>SV>PV. Myoglobin deposition was observed in the cast of proximal tubules, cytoplasm of distal tubules and collecting ducts of rat kidney extracted from rats treated with HCRIs under urethane infusion. Histopathological findings showed that the extent of myoglobin deposition increased on coadministration of BF with each drug. The correlation was found for myopathy risk evaluated by CPK level using the urethane infusion method and drug lipophilicity, ie., the water/n-octanol partition coefficient except for the case of SV. Histopathological findings for the kidney following HCRI treatment also reflected the CPK level in rats under urethane infusion.", 
    "115": "The population of the developed world is steadily ageing. In the European Union, approximately 22% of persons are over 60 years of age and this is projected to increase to more than 27% by the year 2020. This has major implications for health care resources and the productive workforce. Ageing is accompanied by a decline in the physiological reserve of all organ systems, compromising homeostasis and resistance to disease. Thus, when disease develops in the elderly it has an increased impact on organ systems not directly involved. This places older people at risk for multiple simultaneous pathologies. Treatment often requires polypharmacy, which often is accompanied by drug interactions and adverse reactions. The pattern of sequential and comorbid disease often means that the later years of life are associated with an accumulating toll of disability, which in turn consumes a high proportion of health-care resources. The major goal of health care in the elderly should be to compress morbidity into the end of the normal lifespan. To achieve this, it will be necessary to redefine our approaches to treatment in the elderly and to develop an evidence base to inform this process.", 
    "116": "Acute coronary syndromes contribute significantly to the patterns of morbidity and mortality in the elderly. A meta-analysis of the pathology of acute myocardial infarction has shown that 80-90% of episodes result from the rupture of small, unstable lesions that cause <70% diameter stenosis. Statins have been shown to stabilize the architecture of atherosclerotic plaques in humans and in animals. Statin treatment has also been shown to restore endothelial function, inhibit platelet thrombus formation and exert an anti-inflammatory effect. Collectively, these data support the use of statin therapy in those at risk for acute coronary syndromes, of whom the elderly are foremost.", 
    "117": "There is mounting evidence that specific sterol precursors of cholesterol are associated with reproductive functions. Testicular meiosis-activating sterol (T-MAS) and follicular fluid meiosis-activating-sterol (FF-MAS) are 2 cholesterol precursors found in reproductive organs of mammals, which are able to overcome meiotic arrest in vitro. This study investigates the influence of simvastatin and pravastatin, 2 inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, and BM 15.766, an inhibitor of 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase, on concentrations of neutral sterols in liver and testis of guinea pigs. Concentrations of T-MAS, lathosterol, and desmosterol were markedly higher in testis compared with liver. Simvastatin (150 mg/d) and pravastatin (150 mg/d and 350 mg/d) markedly reduced cholesterol precursors in liver. In contrast, T-MAS and desmosterol in testis remained unchanged, albeit other cholesterol precursors were reduced. BM 15.766 led to the accumulation of 7- and 8-dehydrocholesterol, both in liver and testis. However, concentrations of T-MAS in testis were not changed by BM 15.766. We conclude that treatment of guinea pigs with simvastatin, pravastatin, or BM 15.766, which simulates the biochemical defect of the Smith-Lemli-Opitz (SLO) syndrome, does not affect T-MAS concentrations in testis.", 
    "118": "A novel animal model of insulin resistance, the fructose-fed Syrian golden hamster has been previously documented to exhibit considerable hepatic very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) overproduction concomitant with the development of whole body insulin resistance. Here, we investigated whether hepatic lipoprotein overproduction can be ameliorated by treatment with a hydroxymethyl glutaryl conenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, atorvastatin, using a series of ex vivo experiments. Hamsters were fed a fructose-enriched diet for 14 days to induce a state of insulin resistance, and then continued on a fructose-enriched diet supplemented with or without 40 mg/kg atorvastatin per day for 14 days. Fructose feeding in the first 2 weeks caused a significant increase in plasma total cholesterol and triglyceride levels. There was a significant decline in plasma triglyceride levels following supplementation with the inhibitor (50% to 59%; P <.05). Experiments with primary hepatocytes revealed a decreased VLDL-apolipoprotein B (apoB) production (37.4% +/- 10.4%; P <.05) in hamsters treated with atorvastatin. Interestingly, atorvastatin treatment partially attenuated (by 23%) the elevated hepatic level of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) induced by fructose feeding. There was molecular evidence of improved hepatic insulin sensitivity with atorvastatin treatment based on assessment of the phosphorylation status of the insulin receptor and the expression of protein tyrosine phosphatase-1B. The improvement in insulin signaling was not mediated by a change in hepatic triglyceride accumulation as no significant difference was observed in liver triglyceride levels. Taken together, these data suggest that statins can ameliorate the VLDL-apoB overproduction state observed in a fructose-fed, insulin-resistant hamster model, and may potentially contribute to an enhanced hepatic insulin sensitivity.", 
    "119": "Two major trials, the Bezafibrate Infarction Prevention Trial (BIP) and the Veterans Affairs High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Intervention Trial (VA-HIT) were conducted to clarify the contribution of correcting diminished high density lipoprotein (HDL) (and lowering triglyceride, TG) levels to the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). In BIP, bezafibrate did not significantly reduce the risk of CHD. In contrast, in VA-HIT, gemfibrozil significantly reduced the risk of CHD (22% reduction in primary end point, P=0.006). These trials differ in several respects making direct comparisons difficult. For example, the placebo arm in VA-HIT had a greater prevalence of primary events than that in BIP (22 vs. 15%). The baseline mean LDL value in BIP was also higher compared to that in VA-HIT (148 vs. 112 mg/dl; 3.82 vs. 2.89 mmol/l). Other trials (e.g., AFCAPS and LIPID) showed that patients with LDL values similar to those in BIP benefited significantly from treatment with statins. Therefore, the BIP population may have been more effectively treated with a statin. In contrast, in VA-HIT the LDL level was close to those recommended in the USA and the UK for secondary prevention (100 and 115 mg/dl; 2.6 and 3.0 mmol/l, respectively). Guidelines emphasise that the LDL level is the main treatment target. However, BIP and VA-HIT suggest that correcting HDL and TG levels may be beneficial especially when the LDL level has reached the target value. We may have become too focused on LDL levels and the use of statins.", 
    "120": "Drug-related illness is an important cause of admission to hospital. Little information is available regarding the frequency of ADRs caused by antilipidemic agents classified as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). Treatment with statins has been associated with the occurrence of myopathy or liver toxicity in case reports. Recent lipid intervention studies have involved the implementation of lipid lowering therapy with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in cardiovascular risk management. Since January 1997 we have been involved in a study, the aim of which was to improve the spontaneous drug information reporting system in Germany. The study was supported by the German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices, the \"Bundesinstitut f\u00fcr Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte\", Berlin BfArM. Between early 1997 and late 2000, as a result of this monitoring of ADRs, we analyzed all patient histories concerning therapy with statins. A total of 550 ADR patients were evaluated, (209 male, 341 female) with a mean age of 66.4 years. 27 (4.9%) of all patients had received statins (atorvastatin = 12, fluvastatin = 7, simvastatin as well as pravastatin = 3, lovastatin = 2). Only 2 of the 27 patients admitted to hospital for typical ADRs of statins such as skeletal muscle toxicity (e.g. myalgia, rhabdomyolysis) or disorders involving hepatic structure or function were receiving statins (atorvastatin). An increased risk of rhabdomyolysis has been reported in the case of several statins, following concomitant use with erythromycin, cyclosporine or itraconazole, all of which are potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 enzyme. But only 1 atorvastatin patient had received cyclosporine as a CYP3A4 inhibitor. After discontinuing medication, signs of intoxication disappeared. The antihyperlipidemic drugs available are generally safe and effective, and rate of ADRs is low if concomitant intake of other drugs and the differing pharmacokinetic profiles of the statins are considered.",

Since little is known about the impact of the concomitant use of these therapies, the effects of concurrent hormone therapy and simvastatin in hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal women have been evaluated.", 
    "122": "Twenty-three postmenopausal women with fasting serum total cholesterol levels greater than 250 mg/dl received, in a randomized cross-over design, simvastatin (10 mg daily) for 8 weeks or postmenopausal hormone therapy (up to 1.25 mg of conjugated equine estrogens plus 5 mg of medroxyprogesterone acetate daily) for 8 weeks, with an 8-week wash-out interval between the two treatment periods. In a third, non-randomized treatment period after a second wash-out interval, each woman received a combination of simvastatin and postmenopausal hormone therapy in the same dosage regimens as above. Fasting blood was sampled monthly from baseline to measure total cholesterol, high- and low-density lipoprotein (HDL and LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides and lipoprotein(a).",

Simvastatin was more effective than hormone therapy (p < 0.001), while the effect of the combined therapy was even greater (total cholesterol, p = 0.012; LDL cholesterol, p < 0.001). The level of HDL cholesterol increased similarly with each treatment: 4% (-3-11%), 6% (2-10%) and 7% (2-13%), respectively. Triglyceride levels increased with hormone therapy and decreased with simvastatin (p < 0.001), while there was little change with the combination (effect of combined therapy vs. simvastatin, p = 0.002; vs. hormone therapy, p < 0.001). Both hormone therapy and combined therapy reduced lipoprotein(a) similarly (-23% and -14%, respectively, p = 0.078). Simvastatin had no effect on lipoprotein(a) levels.",

    "125": "Mevalonic acid-derived intermediates in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway have been recognized as being critical to the isoprenylation of a variety of growth-regulating proteins, including those of the RAS superfamily. Treatment of cells with lovastatin, a hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, depletes cells of mevalonic acid and thus blocks the isoprenylation of proteins in the RAS superfamily. In NIH3T3 cells pretreated with lovastatin, subsequent addition of farnesol (FOH), but not geranylgeraniol (GGOH), reverses lovastatin's block of RAS isoprenylation. Neither FOH nor GGOH prevents lovastatin-induced inhibition of RAS isoprenylation when added to cells concurrently with lovastatin. In intact cells, 167 microM FOH and 125 microM GGOH decrease incorporation of [14C]acetate into cholesterol by approximately 50 and 75%, respectively. Results suggest that the radio-label from either [3H]FOH or [3H]GGOH is incorporated into cholesterol. Co-treatment of cells with lovastatin or mevalonic acid did not significantly alter [3H]FOH or [3H]GGOH incorporation into cholesterol. Lovastatin induces cell rounding; GGOH, but not FOH, both prevents and reverses lovastatin-induced cell rounding. These results provide additional evidence for the existence of a novel \"isoprenoid shunt\" that differentially utilizes FOH and GGOH as metabolic precursors for isoprenoids that have been depleted by lovastatin treatment.", 
    "126": "During the last decades, transplantation has become an established tool for the treatment of terminal organ failure. Beside immunological factors, hyperlipidemia is the main problem after heart transplantation, causing rapid transplant coronary artery disease (TxCAD) and poor long-term prognosis at the beginning of the transplantation. Heart transplant recipients are now effectively treated with lipid lowering substances, of which HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors are the most potent. However, treatment with these substances correlates with an increased risk for the development of rhabdomyolysis due to therapy with the immunosuppressive cyclosporine A. Our study monitored the safety and efficacy of treatment with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor fluvastatin in heart transplant recipients compared to healthy controls. We investigated 10 patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy consisting of cyclosporine A, prednisone, and azathioprine who had increased concentrations of LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), and 10 age-matched healthy controls. The patients were treated with 40 mg/day fluvastatin for 4 weeks and 20 mg/day for 4 additional weeks. Control individuals received 40 mg/day fluvastatin for 4 weeks only. Parameters of fluvastatin pharmacokinetics (maximum concentration of the drug (C(max.)), time (t(max.)) to reach C(max.), area under the concentration vs. time curve (AUC(0h-24h)), elimination half-life time (t(1/2))), apparent total body clearance (CL), blood cyclosporine A concentration, plasma lipids, and safety parameters were determined in both study groups at the beginning of the study and after 4 weeks. The latter were determined in the patient group also after 8 and 12 weeks. Treatment with 40 mg/day fluvastatin caused a significant decrease in total cholesterol (patients: 5.47 +/- 1.32 mmol/L vs. 7.30 +/- 1.83 mmol/L; controls: 4.69 +/- 0.64 mmol/L vs. 5.81 +/- 0.72 mmol/L), LDL-C (patients: 3.28 +/- 1.25 mmol/L vs. 5.00 +/- 1.85 mmol/L; controls: 2.58 +/- 0.63 mmol/L vs. 3.50 +/- 0.70 mmol/L), and triglycerides (patients: 1.99 +/- 0.77 mmol/L vs. 2.50 +/- 1.00 mmol/L; controls: 1.24 +/- 0.46 mmol/L vs. 1.72 +/- 0.67 mmol/L) in both study groups, whereas HDL-C was not significantly changed (patients: 1.29 +/- 0.35 mmol/L vs. 1.17 +/- 0.32 mmol/L; controls: 1.55 +/- 0.30 mmol/L vs. 1.53 +/- 0.26 mmol/L). Values of C(max.) and AUC(0h-24h) were higher in the patient group than in the control group (day 1, patients vs. controls, C(max.): 869.4 +/- 604.0 ng/mL vs. 211.9 +/- 113.9 ng/mL; AUC(0h-24h): 1948.8 +/- 1347.9 ng/mL*h vs. 549.4 +/- 247.4 ng/mL*h), whereas the corresponding value of CL was lower in the patient group (33.3 +/- 24.5 L/h vs. 107.9 +/- 95.8 L/h), and the values of t(max.) and t(1/2) showed no differences. In addition, values of C(max.) and AUC(0h-24h) after administration of 40 mg/day fluvastatin for 4 weeks in both groups were slightly higher than at the beginning, whereas the value of CL was slightly lower (day 28, patients vs. controls, C(max.): 1530.4 +/- 960.4 ng/mL vs. 254.7 +/- 199.8 ng/mL; AUC(0h-24h): 2615.3 +/- 1379.4 ng/mL*h vs. 841.8 +/- 421.4 ng/mL*h; CL: day 28, 21.4 +/- 15.3 L/h vs. 61.5 +/- 36.6 L/h). Except for an intermittent increase of creatine kinase, safety parameters showed no increases within the observation period. Our data suggest that fluvastatin effectively lowers plasma concentrations of cholesterol and LDL-C in patients after heart transplantation, however, the metabolism of fluvastatin is affected by concomitant therapy with cyclosporine A. Serum concentrations of fluvastatin should be monitored in cases of concomitant therapy with other substances interfering in the metabolism by competing cytochrome enzymes.", 
    "127": "1. The aim of this study was to establish an experimental model of the escape phenomenon, in which plasma cholesterol, initially reduced by a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor such as pravastatin, increases again on long-term administration. We also evaluated the efficacy of YM-53601 ((E)-2-[2-fluoro-2- (quinuclidin-3-ylidene) ethoxy]-9H-carbazole monohydrochloride), a squalene synthase inhibitor, in this model. 2. Pravastatin inhibited cholesterol biosynthesis in hamster primary hepatocytes (IC(50), 14 nM). After pre-treatment with pravastatin, in contrast, almost no effect on cholesterol biosynthesis was seen. 3. In hamsters fed a high fat diet, 3 mg kg(-1) pravastatin for 9 days decreased plasma non-HDL cholesterol (total cholesterol - high density lipoprotein cholesterol) (P<0.01), but this effect was lost between 17 and 27 days of treatment, accompanied by an increase in HMG-CoA reductase activity. No such increase in plasma non-HDL cholesterol was seen with YM-53601 at 30 mg kg(-1) after 9 (P<0.001), 17 (P<0.01) or 27 (P<0.001) days of treatment. Replacement of pravastatin with YM-53601 caused a decrease in plasma non-HDL cholesterol by 53% (P<0.001) and in HMG-CoA reductase activity. 4. This animal model thus satisfactorily replicates the escape phenomenon observed in humans and may therefore be useful in evaluation of lipid-lowering agents, specifically comparison of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Further, YM-53601 may be useful in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia without induction of the escape phenomenon."
