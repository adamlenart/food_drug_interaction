    "0": "Nitric oxide (NO) production by endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) regulates renal O(2) consumption. This mechanism is impaired in heart and kidney of dogs with heart failure (CHF). Simvastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, increases eNOS expression in the endothelium. Therefore, we studied whether simvastatin treatment could restore the regulation of renal O(2) consumption by stimulators of NO production in dogs with CHF. Renal O(2) consumption was measured after stimulation of NO production with bradykinin, ramiprilat, or amlodipine or the NO donor S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP). Simvastatin delayed the time to euthanasia in dogs with CHF (35 +/- 1.0 vs. 29 +/- 1.2 days; P < 0.01). In normal dogs, bradykinin (10(-4) M), ramiprilat (10(-4) M), amlodipine (10(-5) M), and SNAP (10(-4) M) significantly reduced O(2) consumption in the renal cortex (-31.8 +/- 0.9, -30.3 +/- 1.1, -30.1 +/- 2.0, -46.9 +/- 1.0%) and renal medulla (-29.7 +/- 2.1, -33.0 +/- 2.7, -30.8 +/- 2.2, -46.8 +/- 1.1%). Responses to bradykinin, ramiprilat, and amlodipine were significantly attenuated in CHF but were partially or completely restored by simvastatin. Responses to SNAP were unaffected. These data demonstrate that treatment with simvastatin improves renal production of NO in CHF, restoring the normal regulation of renal O(2) consumption by NO.", 
    "1": "X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) is an inherited neurometabolic disorder associated with elevated levels of saturated unbranched very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA; C > 22:0) in plasma and tissues, and reduced VLCFA beta-oxidation in fibroblasts, white blood cells, and amniocytes from X-ALD patients. The X-ALD gene (ABCD1) at Xq28 encodes the adrenoleukodystrophy protein (ALDP) that is related to the peroxisomal ATP-binding cassette (ABCD) transmembrane half-transporter proteins. The function of ALDP is unknown and its role in VLCFA accumulation unresolved. Previously, our laboratory has shown that sodium 4-phenylbutyrate (4PBA) treatment of X-ALD fibroblasts results in increased peroxisomal VLCFA beta-oxidation activity and increased expression of the X-ALD-related protein, ALDRP, encoded by the ABCD2 gene. In this study, the effect of various pharmacological agents on VLCFA beta-oxidation in ALD mouse fibroblasts is tested. 4PBA, styrylacetate and benzyloxyacetate (structurally related to 4PBA), and trichostatin A (functionally related to 4PBA) increase both VLCFA (peroxisomal) and long-chain fatty acid [LCFA (peroxisomal and mitochondrial)] beta-oxidation. Isobutyrate, zaprinast, hydroxyurea, and 5-azacytidine had no effect on VLCFA or LCFA beta-oxidation. Lovastatin had no effect on fatty acid beta-oxidation under normal tissue culture conditions but did result in an increase in both VLCFA and LCFA beta-oxidation when ALD mouse fibroblasts were cultured in the absence of cholesterol. The effect of trichostatin A on peroxisomal VLCFA beta-oxidation is shown to be independent of an increase in ALDRP expression, suggesting that correction of the biochemical abnormality in X-ALD is not dependent on pharmacological induction of a redundant gene (ABCD2). These studies contribute to a better understanding of the role of ALDP in VLCFA accumulation and may lead to the development of more effective pharmacological therapies.", 
    "2": "Mononuclear cell infiltration into the CNS and induction of inflammatory cytokines and iNOS in diseases like multiple sclerosis (MS) and experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) have been implicated in subsequent disease pathogenesis and progression. We report that Lovastatin treatment blocks the clinical disease and induction of inflammatory cytokines and iNOS in spinal cords of MBP induced EAE rats. A significant number of the infiltrating cells in CNS were ED1+ cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage. To understand the mechanism of efficacy of Lovastatin against EAE, we examined the effect of Lovastatin on the transmigration of mononuclear cells into EAE spinal cord. The data presented here documents that Lovastatin treatment attenuates the transmigration of mononuclear cells possibly by down regulating the expression of LFA-1, a ligand for ICAM, in endothelial-leukocyte interaction. These results indicate that Lovastatin treatment prevents infiltration by mononuclear cells into the CNS of rats induced for EAE, thereby lessening the histological changes and clinical signs and thus ameliorating the disease. These observations indicate that Lovastatin treatment may be of therapeutic value against inflammatory disease process associated with infiltration of activated mononuclear cells into the tissue.", 
    "3": "Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 and COX-1 play an important role in prostacyclin production in vessels and participate in maintaining vascular homeostasis. Statins are inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, which is crucial in cholesterol biosynthesis. Recently, cholesterol-independent effects of statins have been described. In this study, we evaluated the effect of two inhibitors of HMG CoA reductase, mevastatin and lovastatin, on the production of prostacyclin and the expression of COX in human aortic smooth muscle cells. Treatment of cells with 25 microm mevastatin or lovastatin resulted in the induction of COX-2 and increase in prostacyclin production. Mevalonate, the direct metabolite of HMG CoA reductase, and geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate reversed this effect. GGTI-286, a selective inhibitor of geranylgeranyltransferases, increased COX-2 expression and prostacyclin formation, thus indicating the involvement of geranylgeranylated proteins in the down-regulation of COX-2. Furthermore, Clostridium difficile toxin B, an inhibitor of the Rho GTP-binding protein family, the Rho selective inhibitor C3 transferase, and Y-27632, a selective inhibitor of the Rho-associated kinases, targets of Rho A, increased COX-2 expression whereas the activator of the Rho GTPase, the cytotoxic necrotizing factor 1, blocked interlukin-1alpha-dependent COX-2 induction. These results demonstrate that statins up-regulate COX-2 expression and subsequent prostacyclin formation in human aortic smooth muscle cells in part through inhibition of Rho.", 
    "4": "We recently obtained evidence demonstrating that cultured bovine endothelial cells contain cytosolic proteins that form complexes with the 3'-untranslated region of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) mRNA and are associated with its destabilization. The aim of this study was to determine the presence of such proteins and eNOS expression in hypercholesterolemic rabbits as an in vivo model of endothelial dysfunction.", 
    "5": "Endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine and the calcium ionophore A23187 was reduced in aortic segments from hypercholesterolemic rabbits compared with controls. Treatment of hypercholesterolemic rabbits with cerivastatin (0.1 mg. kg body wt(-1). d(-1)) restored endothelium-dependent relaxation. Aortic eNOS expression was reduced in hypercholesterolemic rabbits and was accompanied by enhanced binding activity of a 60-kDa cytosolic protein and reduced stability of eNOS mRNA. Cerivastatin treatment upregulated eNOS expression and reduced the interaction of the cytosolic protein with the 3'-untranslated region of eNOS mRNA. Mononuclear cells from hypercholesterolemic rabbits also showed a marked reduction of eNOS expression and eNOS mRNA stability and an increase in binding activity of the cytosolic protein, which were also prevented by cerivastatin treatment.", 
    "6": "These results demonstrate the presence of a 60-kDa protein that binds to eNOS mRNA and reductions in eNOS expression in both vascular wall and mononuclear cells that are prevented by cerivastatin.", 
    "7": "Elevated oxidative stress and superoxide anion formation in vascular cells could promote conversion of LDL to atherogenic oxidized LDL (oxLDL), contributing to endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis. As a major source of vascular superoxide anion formation, an endothelial NAD(P)H oxidase, similar to the leukocyte enzyme, has been identified.", 
    "8": "To elucidate functional differences between NAD(P)H oxidases of endothelial cells and leukocytes, DNA sequences of endothelial NAD(P)H oxidase subunits were determined. Gp91phox cDNA sequence showed no difference between the 2 cell types. Endothelial p67phox cDNA sequence revealed 2 known polymorphisms, which do not affect NAD(P)H oxidase function. Next, we analyzed relative mRNA expression of NAD(P)H subunits in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and leukocytes using a common cRNA standard in competitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. NAD(P)H oxidase subunits p22phox and p47phox are expressed at a similar level in both cell types, whereas p67phox (2.5%) and gp91phox (1.1%) are expressed at a much lower level in endothelial cells than in leukocytes. Differences of gp91phox expression in leukocytes and HUVECs correlate with differences in superoxide release. Gp91phox mRNA and endothelial superoxide anion formation are induced in response to oxLDL in HUVECs. Furthermore, a lower gp91phox mRNA expression was found in internal mammary artery biopsy samples of patients with coronary artery disease treated with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors before coronary bypass surgery.",

    "10": "Roles of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) have been established as lipid synthetic transcription factors especially for cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis. SREBPs have unique characteristics. Firstly, they are membrane-bound proteins and the N-terminal active portions enter nucleus to activate their target genes after proteolytic cleavage, which requires sterol-sensing molecule, SREBP-activating protein (SCAP) and is crucial for sterol-regulation. Secondly, they bind and activate sterol-regulatory (SREs) containing promoters as well as some E-boxes, which makes SREBPs eligible to regulate a wide range of lipid genes. Finally, three isoforms, SREBP-1a-1c, and have different roles in lipid synthesis. In vivo studies using transgenic and knockout mice suggest that SREBP-1 seems to be involved in energy metabolism including fatty acid and glucose/insulin metabolism, whereas SREBP-2 is specific to cholesterol synthesis. Future studies will be focused on understanding molecular mechanisms sensing cellular sterol and energy states where SREBPs are deeply involved.",

    "12": "The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy, safety, and direct treatment costs of cerivastatin and branded pravastatin in adult patients with primary hypercholesterolemia over a 1-year period.", 
    "13": "This was a multicenter (48 sites), randomized, open-label, parallel-group, optional dose-titration study conducted in Canada. Patients aged 18 to 75 years with documented primary hypercholesterolemia (mean LDL-C > or = 160 mg/dL [> or = 4.5 mmol/L] and at least 1 fasting triglyceride measurement < or = 400 mg/dL [< or = 4.5 mmol/L]) that did not respond adequately to dietary intervention were enrolled. Patients who were on a diet at study entry were instructed to continue that diet for the duration of the study. Patients not following a diet were also entered into the study provided they had received previous dietary counseling and were unwilling or unable to comply with this dietary advice. Before randomization, treating physicians were required to record a target lipid level for each patient and then instructed to randomize patients to treatment with any dose and any titration schedule of cerivastatin or branded pravastatin according to their normal practice. Physicians were not required to titrate the study drug dose if the patient did not achieve the predefined target goal. Lipid analyses were conducted at baseline/randomization and at months 3, 6, 9, and 12. All samples drawn for lipid analyses were collected after a fast of > or = 10 hours. A cost-minimization approach was used to compare the direct treatment costs between cerivastatin and branded pravastatin. Since the analysis was from the perspective of the third-party payer (Ministries of Health), only costs attributed to the third-party payer were included.", 
    "14": "A total of 417 patients were randomized to once-daily treatment with cerivastatin 0.1 mg to 0.4 mg (n = 209) or branded pravastatin 10 mg to 40 mg (n = 208); 39 (9.4%) of patients discontinued prematurely, 19 (4.6%) because of an adverse event. The incidence of adverse events was similar for cerivastatin (73.6%) and branded pravastatin (74.9%). The majority of adverse events were mild or moderate and included headache, nausea, pain, and dizziness. Both cerivastatin and pravastatin were effective in lowering LDL-C to target levels (mean reduction 29.8% and 27.5%, respectively, P = 0.35). An LDL-C decrease of > or = 20% from baseline to end point was achieved in 74.2% of cerivastatin patients and 74.0% of pravastatin patients. The annualized direct hyperlipidemia treatment cost was 19% higher in the branded pravastatin group compared with the cerivastatin group. A sensitivity analysis designed to examine the impact of generic pricing on the cost-minimization analysis indicated that the cost difference between cerivastatin and generic pravastatin was not significant.", 
    "15": "Both cerivastatin and branded pravastatin were well tolerated and effective in lowering LDL-C by > or = 20% versus baseline. A cost savings in favor of cerivastatin was a reflection of the lower drug acquisition cost of cerivastatin compared with branded pravastatin.", 
    "16": "Estrogens have been shown to elicit beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system by modulating the lipid profile as well as by direct vascular actions. Since estrogenic cardioprotection has still been not confirmed by randomized interventional trials, the combination with statins, which have been proved to act in a cardioprotective fashion, is of special interest. Statins are lipid-lowering drugs, but direct vascular effects also seem to be of importance in this case. Apart from some clinical studies investigating the effect of such combination therapy on the lipid profile, no reports of a possible influence on biochemical markers of vascular function are yet available. The aim of the present study was to investigate, for the first time, lipid-independent effects of an estrogen-statin combination on markers of vascular endothelial function.", 
    "17": "Experiments were conducted using endothelial cell cultures from human umbilical veins. Markers of endothelial function chosen were adhesion molecules, which are involved in the early stages of atherosclerosis, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), which is an independent risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease. The concentrations of soluble forms of the adhesion molecules E-selectin and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) as well as concentrations of PAI-1 were measured after the addition of 17 beta-estradiol, fluvastatin and equimolar combinations of the two in concentrations of 0.01, 0.1 and 1 mumol/l.", 
    "18": "Both drugs significantly reduced concentrations of E-selectin and ICAM, and the effect of the combination was not superior to that of the monosubstances. In addition, both substances were able to inhibit the synthesis of PAI-1. In this case the effect of the combination was significantly greater than that of the monosubstances.", 
    "19": "In summary, an estrogen-statin therapy is able to elicit lipid-independent positive modulations on the expression of cell adhesion molecules and the synthesis of PAI-1. The estrogen-statin combination showed partially additive effects and no negative, antagonistic actions. Since the combination of statins with hormone replacement therapy may attain clinical significance in preventing cardiovascular disease, it seems worthwhile to elucidate further the direct vascular effects of this combination therapy, especially in postmenopausal women with pre-existing coronary disease.", 
    "20": "Statins are widely used pharmaceutical agents which lower plasma cholesterol by inhibiting the rate controlling enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. One epidemiological study suggests that statin therapy may provide protection against Alzheimer disease (AD). The aim of the present study was to determine the relative expression of HMG-CoA reductase mRNAs in various areas of brain as well as in peripheral organs and to compare values in AD and control cases. High levels of the mRNA were found in all areas of brain but no obvious differences were found between AD and controls. We conclude that brain has a robust capacity to synthesize cholesterol which appears to be unaffected by AD pathology.", 
    "21": "Serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration is an important regulator of vascular reactivity. This double-blinded study examined the effect of lipid-lowering therapy on myocardial vasodilatory function in young hypercholesterolemic but otherwise healthy men. Fifty-one men (age 35 +/- 4 years) with mild hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol, 5.6 +/- 0.8 mM ) were randomly assigned to receive pravastatin, 40 mg/day, or placebo for 6 months. Myocardial blood flow was measured at rest and during adenosine-induced hyperemia using positron emission tomography and oxygen-15-labeled water at baseline and after treatment. Pravastatin lowered low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol by 33% from 3.77 +/- 0.76 mM (p < 0.001), whereas placebo had no effect. At baseline, resting and adenosine-induced flow values were 0.85 +/- 0.27 and 3.61 +/- 1.00 ml/min per gram in the pravastatin group and 0.83 +/- 0.18 and 3.17 +/- 0.69 ml/min per gram in the placebo group. Despite significant low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol lowering, resting and adenosine-stimulated blood flow values remained similar at follow-up: 0.86 +/- 0.23 and 3.79 +/- 1.31 vs. 0.78 +/- 0.20 and 3.20 +/- 0.86 ml/min per gram, in the pravastatin and placebo groups, respectively. An improvement in adenosine-induced flow after pravastatin, but not after placebo, was seen only in a subgroup of subjects (n = 15) with relatively low adenosine flow (<4.0 ml/min per gram) at baseline. Six months of cholesterol-lowering therapy with statin treatment has no overall significant effect on coronary vasodilator capacity in healthy subjects with mildly elevated cholesterol levels. A controlled study is needed to further test whether improvement in coronary function is obtained in subjects with initially reduced hyperemic flow response.", 
    "22": "Ezetimibe (SCH 58235) and SCH 48461 are potent cholesterol absorption inhibitors, which cause significant decreases in plasma cholesterol levels in cholesterol-fed animals and in humans with hypercholesterolemia. These compounds selectively block intestinal uptake and absorption of cholesterol. These cholesterol absorption inhibitors cause modest, inconsistent reductions in plasma cholesterol levels in animals fed cholesterol-free chow diets. Although, these compounds block cholesterol absorption and increase neutral sterol excretion, chow-fed animals compensate for the loss of biliary cholesterol by increasing hepatic cholesterol synthesis. Therefore, we determined the effect of SCH 48461 and ezetimibe in combination with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors in chow-fed dogs. A synergistic reduction in plasma cholesterol was observed in chow-fed dogs given SCH 48461 (0.1 mg/kg/d) and the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor, lovastatin (5 mg/kg/d). Neither SCH 48461 nor lovastatin alone affected plasma cholesterol levels. Their combination for 14 days caused a 36% reduction in plasma cholesterol levels from 129 mg/dL to 83 mg/dL (P <.05). Ezetimibe (0.007 mg/kg/d) also caused synergistic reductions in plasma cholesterol levels in chow-fed dogs when combined with HMG CoA reductase inhibitors for 2 weeks (5 mg/kg lovastatin -50%; 2.5 mg/kg pravastatin -41%; 5 mg/kg fluvastatin -60%, and -30% with low doses of simvastatin and atorvastatin 1 mg/kg). The combination of this class of cholesterol absorption inhibitors with an HMG CoA reductase inhibitor should be very effective clinically at reducing plasma cholesterol levels, even with reduced dietary intake of cholesterol.", 
    "23": "Serum magnesium concentration (S-Mg) has been reported to be inversely associated with atherogenic lipid fractions and with blood glucose concentrations. In some studies on humans, oral magnesium supplementation has been found to improve the lipoprotein balance. Against this background the present study was undertaken to determine whether reductions in atherogenic lipid fractions are associated with S-Mg alterations. Total S-Mg was measured in 23 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) treated with the lipid-lowering drugs gemfibrozil and simvastatin in a double-blind cross-over study. The mean S-Mg at the end of the initial placebo period, ie, before active treatment, was 0.80 (SD 0.06) mmol/L. Treatment with gemfibrozil 600 mg twice daily for 4 months decreased S-Mg by 0.02 mmol/L (P =.02), and treatment with simvastatin 10 mg daily for 4 months again decreased S-Mg by 0.02 mmol/L (P =.10; not significant [NS]) The changes in S-Mg during the 2 different treatment periods were closely correlated (r = 0.66, P <.001). Fasting plasma glucose concentrations increased significantly by 17% during both drug regimens. The changes in fasting plasma glucose and S-Mg were significantly correlated both during gemfibrozil treatment (r = -0.56, P <.01) and during treatment with simvastatin (r = -0.44, P <.05). Changes in glucose tolerance or insulin sensitivity did not correlate to changes in S-Mg. The associations between changes in serum very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) fractions and S-Mg did not reach statistical significance (r = -0.37, P <.10). Changes in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and S-Mg did not correlate. In conclusion, total S-Mg concentration decreased during treatment with gemfibrozil and simvastatin in patients with NIDDM. During both drug regimens changes in S-Mg status were inversely correlated to changes in plasma glucose concentrations, while changes in lipid status were not significantly correlated with changes in S-Mg.", 
    "24": "Epidemiological studies have shown that hypercholesterolemia is a major risk factor for coronary heart disease. In clinical trials of lipid lowering therapy, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl Coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor has been shown to decrease cardiac events and mortality. Flavonoids are polyphenolic natural antioxidants existing in vegetables, fruits and beverages such as tea and wine. Previous studies have shown that some antioxidants had hypocholesterolemic effect, and flavonoid intake was associated with the decrease of mortality from coronary artery disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the inhibitory effect of flavonoids on HMG-CoA reductase.", 
    "25": "The methods for analysis of specific inhibitors of mevalonate biosynthesis have been well-established, using Vero cells, a cell line obtained from kidneys of African green monkeys. Flavonoids isolated from different traditional Chinese herbs were dissolved in DMSO and incubated with Vero cells with or without the addition of 1 mM mevalonate or 5 mM sodium acetate in order to observe cell growth for 24 h.", 
    "26": "Concentrations of 1 mM mevalonate or 5 mM sodium acetate were added into culture medium in order to observe the effect on cell growth. Different concentrations of pravastatin to inhibit cell growth were used as a positive control. About 40 flavonoid compounds were used for study, only one compound, astilbin (belonging to the flavonol group), showed significant inhibition of Vero cell growth.",

    "28": "Cerivastatin was recently withdrawn from the market after the report of more than 30 deaths in the United-States among patients receiving a combination of cerivastatin and gemfibrozil, a fibrate which is not anymore on the Belgian market. The cause of death was attributed to severe rhabdomyolysis. Cases were also reported among patients treated by cerivastatin only. Recommendations for better use of lipid-lowering drugs are given in order to optimize the benefit/risk ratio of such treatment.", 
    "29": "With the aging of the population, death from coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke has become more prevalent. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, such as hypertension, obesity, and diabetes mellitus increase with age as well. Recent secondary-prevention studies have established the positive effect of statins in decreasing the risk of CHD mortality through the lowering of cholesterol. Statins have an excellent safety record, at least with users under age 65, and provide a cheaper alternative to more costly medical options. The most serious side effect associated with their use is myopathy, which is infrequent. Drug interactions have been found with drugs that compete for the same CYP450 isoenzymes as statins. Several drugs have been shown to significantly inhibit the CYP3A4 pathway; in combination with statins such as lovastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin, and cerivastatin, they have been shown to elevate serum concentrations of these statins, or may increase the risk of myopathy. Alternatively, other drugs can inhibit the CYP2C9 pathway and may elevate serum concentration of fluvastatin. Due to the number of medications the elderly receive, an understanding of the various metabolic pathways is of vital importance to minimize the potential for drug interactions. The elderly population, while at high risk for CVD, is currently undertreated. Statins can effectively lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and lessen the risk of CVD for this population.", 
    "30": "Beneficial effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, such as simvastatin have been attributed to lipid lowering and cholesterol-independent mechanisms, for example a reduction of monocyte adhesion to endothelium. However, little is known about acute effects of statin intake. In an attempt to test for short-term effects of drug intake, we found that the adhesion of blood monocytes isolated from healthy volunteers or mildly hypercholesterolemic patients was increased after intake of simvastatin but not placebo at 0.5 h and declined to baseline levels at 3 h. Blood cholesterol levels were unaltered and the observed effects did not correlate with systemic concentrations of the pro-drug nor the active drug concentration in the peripheral circulation. In conclusion, the transient increase in adhesiveness of monocytes may be due to direct and/or enterohepatic metabolites of simvastatin, demonstrating the necessity of drug metabolism for exerting the beneficial effects of long-term treatment.", 
    "31": "Elevated Lipoprotein (a) [Lp (a)] has been reported frequently, but not consistently, to be associated with restenosis following percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). The purpose of this study was to examine the association between Lp (a) and restenosis and clinical events in the context of a multi-centre randomised restenosis [Fluvastatin Angioplasty Restenosis (FLARE)] study of patients undergoing elective PTCA with full angiographic follow up. In the FLARE trial 40 mg fluvastatin twice daily did not influence restenosis, compared with placebo, after successful balloon angioplasty, measured as late loss in 834 patients, but did reduce the risk of death or myocardial infarction. Lp (a) was not effected by fluvastatin. Lp (a) and other biochemical details were established prior to planned PTCA. Among those undergoing successful PTCA, follow up angiography was performed at 26+/-2 weeks. Clinical follow up was complete to week 40. Included in this analysis are the 823 patients who underwent successful angioplasty and had a baseline Lp (a) performed yielding 891 lesions for quantitative coronary angiography (QCA). No association was observed between Lp (a) and either quantitative markers of restenosis or binary restenosis rates. Late loss was 0.27 (SD 0.51) in the lowest quintile (Lp (a) 0-4 g/dl) compared with 0.23 (SD 0.49) (P>0.05). Elevated Lp (a) was not associated with an increased risk of individual or combined major coronary events over 40 weeks. A major adverse cardiac event (MACE) occurred in 41 (24%) of the lowest quintile and 42 (26%) of the highest (P>0.05). In conclusion, elevated Lp (a) was not associated with restenosis or clinical events following elective coronary balloon angioplasty in this randomised clinical trial and should not be considered a risk factor for post angioplasty restenosis.", 
    "32": "Hyperlipidemia is frequently developed following renal transplantation and results in worsening of the patient's prognosis. In study 1, the effects of immunosuppressants, cyclosporine (CsA) and tacrolimus on serum lipids were compared in-patients undergoing renal transplantation. The study included 32 cases of renal transplantation recipients who randomized to the CsA treatment group (15 patients) and the tacrolimus group (17 patients). Before and 1 month after the transplantation, we assessed the serum lipid levels, apolipoprotein levels, the concentrations of cholesterol in the respective lipoprotein fractions and the enzyme activities related to lipid-metabolism. The serum lipid levels in both groups were significantly increased at 1 month after renal transplantation. In the CsA group, there were significant increases in cholesterol contents in very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), LDL2 and HDL2 fractions, whereas, in the tacrolimus group, cholesterol content was increased in VLDL and HDL2 fractions. In study 2, 1 month after renal transplantation, 19 patients with hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol (TC) >200 mg/dl) and hypertriglyceridemia (triglyceride (TG) >150 mg/dl) were treated with simvastatin 5-10 mg/day for 6 months. Simvastatin treatment significantly decreased serum TC (240+/-29-200+/-22 mg/dl, P<0.001), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C; 114+/-20-99+/-17 mg/dl, P<0.05) and TG levels (217+/-103-130+/-38 mg/dl, P<0.01). In addition, there were significant decreases in very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C; 53+/-20-34+/-15 mg/dl, P<0.001). The Cmax and AUC of simvastatin were increased about eight-fold, when simvastatin was given in combination with CsA. In contrast, no significant changes in simvastatin levels were observed when combination with tacrolimus. Although simvastatin levels were increased with CsA, there were no abnormal changes in renal and liver functions, creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) levels or in incidence of adverse effects.", 
    "33": "Colesevelam hydrochloride is a novel, potent, non-absorbed lipid-lowering agent previously shown to reduce low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. To examine the efficacy and safety of coadministration of colesevelam and atorvastatin, administration of these agents alone or in combination was examined in a double-blind study of 94 hypercholesterolemic men and women (baseline LDL cholesterol > or =160 mg/dl). After 4 weeks on the American Heart Association Step I diet, patients were randomized among five groups: placebo; colesevelam 3.8 g/day; atorvastatin 10 mg/day; coadminstered colesevelam 3.8 g/day plus atorvastatin 10 mg/day; or atorvastatin 80 mg/day. Fasting lipids were measured at screening, baseline and 2 and 4 weeks of treatment. LDL cholesterol decreased by 12-53% in all active treatment groups (P<0.01). LDL cholesterol reductions with combination therapy (48%) were statistically superior to colesevelam (12%) or low-dose atorvastatin (38%) alone (P<0.01), but similar to those achieved with atorvastatin 80 mg/day (53%). Total cholesterol decreased 6-39% in all active treatment groups (P<0.05). High density lipoprotein cholesterol increased significantly for all groups including placebo (P<0.05). Triglycerides decreased in patients taking atorvastatin alone (P<0.05), but were unaffected by colesevelam alone or in combination. The frequency of side effects did not differ among groups. At recommended starting doses of each agent, coadministration of colesevelam and atorvastatin was well tolerated, efficacious and produced additive LDL cholesterol reductions comparable to those observed with the maximum atorvastatin dose.", 
    "34": "Although the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, or statins, share a common lipid-lowering effect, there are differences within this class of drugs. The low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol-lowering efficacy, pharmacokinetic properties, drug-food interactions, and cost can vary widely, thus influencing the selection of a particular statin as a treatment option. The statins that produce the greatest percentage change in LDL cholesterol levels are atorvastatin and simvastatin. Atorvastatin and fluvastatin are least affected by alterations in renal function. Fewer pharmacokinetic drug interactions are likely to occur with pravastatin and fluvastatin, because they are not metabolized through the cytochrome P450 (3A4) system. The most cost-effective statins, based on cost per percentage change in LDL cholesterol levels, are fluvastatin, cerivastatin, and atorvastatin.

    "35": "Effects of 12 weeks of treatment with pravastatin at a dose of 20 mg/day were compared in subjects with type II hyperlipoproteinemia with apo+(lipoprotein) E phenotype E3/2, E3/3, and E4/3. There were no differences in age, body mass index, smoking status, complications, or plasma levels of lipids and apoproteins, except the higher levels of apo E in E3/2 subjects (n = 11) than in E3/3 subjects (n = 84) and E4/3 subjects (n = 28). Plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were reduced by 47% +/- 8% (mean +/- SD) in E3/2 subjects, 36% +/- 10% in E3/3 subjects, and 26% +/- 12% in E4/3 subjects after 12 weeks of treatment with pravastatin (all p < 0.0001). Plasma levels of apo B were decreased by 40% +/- 12% in E3/2 subjects, 27% +/- 10% in E3/3 subjects, and 18% +/- 14% in E4/3 subjects after 12 weeks of treatment with pravastatin (all p < 0.0001). The reduction in plasma levels of LDL-C and apo B was most marked in E3/2 subjects, next in E3/3 subjects, and smallest in E4/3 subjects. The authors conclude that treatment with pravastatin at a dose of 20 mg/day in Japanese subjects is equally effective as 40 mg/day in Western subjects, and apo Epolymorphism is a factor to determine the efficacy of pravastatin in Japanese subjects.",

Lovastatin treatment also led to the accumulation of nonisoprenylated Rho and Rac GTPases in cytosolic fraction. Supplementation of culture media with geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate dramatically reversed the lovastatin-induced morphologic and cytoskeletal changes, whereas farnesyl pyrophosphate was ineffective. Treatment of cells with C3-exoenzyme (a Rho GTPase-specific inhibitor), however, abolished the geranylgeranyl-supplementation-induced recovery from the morphologic and cytoskeletal effects of lovastatin.",

Advances in these areas have created controversies regarding who should be screened and treated for primary or secondary prevention of coronary events. The advent of the statin class of lipid-lowering agents represented a major advance, because they are much more effective and better tolerated than previous agents. There is general agreement that patients with hypercholesterolemia and established CHD require treatment for secondary prevention of recurrent coronary events. Primary prevention is controversial in all patient groups except those with diabetes, because their risk of developing CHD is dramatically increased. Postmenopausal women and the elderly are undertreated, whereas young adults may be underdiagnosed and undertreated. Several ongoing trials may resolve the controversies about which patient groups will benefit from different prevention and treatment strategies.",

The subjects were patients with hypercholesterolemia (serum cholesterol concentration > or =5.7 mmol/l (220 mg/dl)) and stable glycemic control. The fasting concentrations of hemoglobin A(1C) (HbA(1C)), fructosamine, and 1,5-anhydroglucitol (1,5-AG) were measured as indices of glycemic control. Plasma lipid concentrations and the safety of the drug were also examined. Forty eligible patients in two groups of 20 each were administered atorvastatin (10 mg/day) or placebo. Neither atorvastatin nor placebo caused a significant change in HbA(1C), fructosamine, or 1,5-AG concentrations. Atorvastatin significantly reduced total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol concentrations from baseline by 29.7% (p<0.0001) and 41.6% (p<0.0001), respectively. The incidence of clinical adverse events and that of abnormal changes in laboratory test values did not differ between the two groups. In this trial, atorvastatin effectively and safely reduced LDL-cholesterol concentrations in diabetic patients with hypercholesterolemia without influencing glycemic control. These findings are clinically important because there are many diabetic patients with hypercholesterolemia and such patients have a high risk of developing arteriosclerotic disease.",

Its mechanism of action, however, has not been completely elucidated. E2F-1 is thought to act as an oncogene and a tumour suppressor, with its action probably dependent upon the cellular context. We have shown in this study that transcriptional regulation and proteasomal degradation of E2F-1 are critical regulatory events in lovastatin-induced cell death. Accompanying this is a reduction in the E2F-1-regulated expression of cell cycle genes such as c-myc, cyclin D1, cyclin A and cyclin B1. Cell cycle analysis demonstrated that the accumulation of apoptotic cells was preceded by a progressive decrease in the S-phase cell population in response to lovastatin. Although expression of E2F-1 was reduced in three prostate cancer cell lines-PC-3, LNCaP and DU-145-the p21 and p27 protein levels were not increased in all the cell lines treated, suggesting that increase in p21 and p27 protein expression per se is not responsible for lovastatin-mediated down-regulation of E2F-1. The subsequent apoptotic death of these cells in the presence of lovastatin can be prevented by forced ectopic expression of E2F-1. Taken together, these facts imply that E2F-1 is the target of an HMG-CoA inhibitor and critical cell death mediator in prostate cancer cells.",

Other pharmacologic agents that are also metabolized via this pathway may interact with the statins and cause rhabdomyolysis.

Epidemiologic and biochemical data suggest a link between cholesterol, APP processing, Abeta, and Alzheimer's disease. Two recent epidemiologic studies indicate that there is a decreased prevalence of AD associated with the use of cholesterol-lowering drugs that inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors or statins). Experiments in cell culture and in vivo demonstrate that treatment with statins reduces production of Abeta. The authors discuss how cholesterol might modulate Abeta deposit formation. As neurons receive only small amounts of exogenous cholesterol, statins that efficiently cross the blood-brain barrier may reduce the amount of neuronal cholesterol below a critical level. Decreased neuronal cholesterol levels inhibit the Abeta-forming amyloidogenic pathway possibly by removing APP from cholesterol- and sphingolipid-enriched membrane microdomains. In addition, depletion of cellular cholesterol levels reduces the ability of Abeta to act as a seed for further fibril formation. These intriguing relationships raise the hopes that cholesterol-lowering strategies may influence the progression of AD.",

For example, in the primary prevention trials, this risk was 74-86% higher when smokers were compared with nonsmokers in the placebo groups. The corresponding figures for the secondary prevention trials were 23-61%. The risk of events in untreated nonsmokers was of a similar order to that seen in smokers taking statins.

The correlation coefficients were r=0.57 (P=0.001) and r=0.43 (P=0.02) for apo A-I, and r=0.54 (P=0.002) and r=0.41 (P=0.02) for apo A-II in the placebo and S-N group, respectively. At baseline, PLTP activity correlated positively with the percent of plasma apo A-I associated with Lp(A-I) (r=0.38, P=0.04) and the amounts of apo A-I in these particles (r=0.43, P=0.02). These relationships persisted in patients who took placebo for 12 months (r=0.46, P=0.009 and r=0.37, P=0.04, respectively), but was attenuated in those treated with S-N. These data indicate that S-N-induced increase in Lp(A-I) was PLTP-independent. It also confirms our previous observation that an interrelationship exists between PLTP and apo-specific HDL particle subclasses in CVD patients with low HDL, and that this relationship is altered by drug intervention.",

The rats were then divided into four groups: control, pravastatin-treated control, fructose-fed, and pravastatin-treated fructose-fed. Pravastatin was administered (20 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks. Excretion of the urinary nitric oxide (NO) metabolite nitrite (NO2-) was also assayed. The CAs from all rats were subsequently removed and assessed for endothelium-dependent and -independent vascular reactivity in vitro. The rats in the fructose-fed group were insulin resistant, hyperinsulinemic, and hypertensive relative to the rats in the control and pravastatin-treated control groups and exhibited diminished endothelium-dependent vasomotion and urinary NO2- excretion (p < 0.05), with preserved endothelium-independent vasomotion. Strikingly, pravastatin treatment restored endothelium-dependent vasomotion and urinary NO2- excretion in rats in the fructose-fed pravastatin-treated relative to the fructose-fed group (p < 0.05).", 
    "101": "The authors report, for the first time, that pravastatin restores endothelial function in CAs from insulin-resistant rats with fructose-induced hypertension.

Some HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have been reported to cause impairment of daytime cognitive processes that have the potential to directly impact the ability of pilots and other aircrew to perform. These studies suggested that there might be cognitive effects of these medications that would argue against their routine use in populations whose activities required high, sustained levels of cognitive performance. The objective of this study is to establish the effects of pravastatin and lovastatin on aircrew daytime cognitive function using tests that are correlated with actual cockpit tasks and inflight performance.",

Statins also deplete nonsterol cholesterol precursors, the isoprenoids, which are necessary for prenylation of critical membrane proteins that regulate cellular communication, including the inflammatory response. In a retrospective review of 388 bacteremic infections due to aerobic gram-negative bacilli and Staphylococcus aureus, there was a significant reduction in both overall (6% vs. 28%; P=.002) and attributable (3% vs. 20%; P=.010) mortality among patients taking statins compared with patients not taking statins. This reduction in mortality persisted in a multivariate analysis (odds ratio, 7.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-57.5). Among the statin group, diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease were more prevalent (P<.001), and there were more skin and soft tissue infections identified as sources of bacteremia (P=.008). These data suggest a potential clinical role of statins in bacteremic infection; however, the mechanism by which mortality is reduced remains undefined.", 
    "107": "This 6-week Prospective, Randomized, Open-label Blinded End point (PROBE) study conducted at 12 sites in the United States compared the efficacy and safety of atorvastatin with cerivastatin. In all, 215 hypercholesterolemic patients (low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol > or = 160 mg/dl [4.14 mmol/L]; triglycerides < or = 400 mg/dl [4.52 mmol/L]) were randomized to receive either atorvastatin 10 mg once daily (n = 108) or cerivastatin 0.3 mg once daily (n = 107). Efficacy was assessed by measuring changes from baseline in LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and triglycerides. Atorvastatin produced significantly greater (p < 0.0001) reductions from baseline to week 6 in LDL cholesterol (37.7% vs 30.2%), total cholesterol (27.5% vs 22.2%), and apolipoprotein B (28.6% vs 21.2%), and a significantly greater (p < 0.05) increase from baseline to week 6 in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (6.8% vs 4.3%) than cerivastatin. Atorvastatin treatment was also associated with a greater percent decrease from baseline to week 6 in triglycerides, with a trend toward statistical significance (p = 0.0982). The percentage of patients that achieved the National Cholesterol Education Program LDL cholesterol goal was greater for those receiving atorvastatin (73%) than for those receiving cerivastatin (66%). The proportion of patients experiencing drug-attributable adverse events, which were mostly mild to moderate and related to the digestive system, was significantly less (p < 0.05) with atorvastatin (5%) than with cerivastatin (14%) treatment. In conclusion, atorvastatin (10 mg/day) is more effective at lowering LDL cholesterol in hypercholesterolemic patients than cerivastatin (0.3 mg/day). Both atorvastatin and cerivastatin are well tolerated, with safety profiles similar to other members of the statin class.", 
    "108": "Cholesterol-lowering drugs such as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (\"statins\") are increasingly used in hypercholesterolemic patients who suffer from multiple concomitant diseases, and are therefore taking multiple drugs. The statins do not differ in their mechanism of action (pharmacodynamics), but there are differences in the affinity to the target enzyme as well as differences in pharmacokinetic properties, which need to be considered when choosing a statin for a specific patient. The most critical side effect of statins is development of myopathy, which becomes evident as muscle pain, weakness, and elevation of serum creatine kinase activity. The incidence of myopathy is usually low. However, myopathy and rhabdomyolysis are more frequent when statins are combined with other drugs that inhibit cytochrome P450-dependent metabolism of statins in the liver (e.g., itraconazole, erythromycin). Drug interactions can thus significantly increase the risk associated with statin therapy. Oral bioavailability of the statins varies considerably. Besides the absolute rate of oral bioavailability, it is important to know the relative difference between intestinal absorption rate and rate of oral bioavailability in order to assess the potential for drug-drug interactions. Statins that are not metabolized by a single cytochrome P450 isoenzyme, and have a high bioavailability, are the least prone to drug interactions.", 
    "109": "The influence of renal impairment on the clearance of the new HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor cerivastatin was evaluated. A single oral dose of 300 microg cerivastatin was given to 18 patients with different degrees of renal impairment and 6 healthy controls. Concentrations of total cerivastatin, its fraction unbound, and the total concentrations of the active metabolites M1 and M23 were measured in plasma. Serum concentrations of unbound cerivastatin were calculated for each individual from the concentration of total cerivastatin and cerivastatin's fraction unbound at t = 2.5 hours. In contradiction to what had been expected, renal impairment significantly influenced the pharmacokinetics of cerivastatin. The best correlation to the AUC and Cmax of unbound cerivastatin was found with serum albumin concentration. Also, serum albumin concentration was the only factor significantly correlated to t 1/2 of cerivastatin. Significant but slighter correlation with the AUC and Cmax of unbound cerivastatin was also observed for creatinine clearance and cerivastatin's fraction unbound, while no correlation was observed with total plasma protein. No significant correlation of creatinine clearance, serum albumin concentration, fu, or total plasma protein concentration with the AUC and Cmax of total cerivastatin or the AUC, Cmax or t 1/2 of M1 and M23 was observed. The authors conclude that low serum albumin concentration rather than low creatinine clearance predicts the pharmacokinetics of cerivastatin in renal impairment.", 
    "110": "The HMG CoA reductase inhibitors reduce levels of low-density lipoproteins, raise high-density lipoproteins, and lower triglycerides. However, there are other pharmacological effects derived from HMG CoA reductase inhibitor therapy. Certain HMG CoA reductase inhibitors affect atherosclerotic plaque composition, endothelial function, platelet and clotting factors, and immune functioning. The unique extrahepatic pharmacological profile of agents in this class has not been fully characterized. All of the HMG CoA reductase inhibitors studied have improved endothelium-dependent vasodilatation. Vascular smooth muscle proliferation is not significantly affected by pravastatin but is by the other agents. Of all the HMG CoA reductase inhibitors, cerivastatin is the most potent inhibitor of vascular smooth muscle proliferation. Pravastatin is the only agent proven to significantly reduce platelet-thrombus formation and fibrinogen levels. Simvastatin has no effect on platelet-thrombus formation or fibrinogen levels, while atorvastatin and lovastatin have been shown to increase fibrinogen in some studies. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 levels are decreased by pravastatin, are not affected by atorvastatin, and are significantly increased by lovastatin and simvastatin. Pravastatin also has clinical benefits in transplant medicine as a result of inhibiting natural killer cell function, an effect that has not been explored with other HMG CoA reductase inhibitors.", 
    "111": "All current 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors [simvastatin (SV), lovastatin (LV), atorvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, and cerivastatin] are believed to undergo an atypical beta-oxidation of the dihydroxy heptanoic or heptanoic acid side chain. Metabolites, which are shortened by two- and/or four-carbon units consistent with beta-oxidation products, have been reported exclusively in rodents following LV and SV administration and across species (rodents, dogs, and humans) following the other statins. In this study, in vitro formation of a beta-oxidation product of simvastatin hydroxy acid (SVA) and its intermediates in mouse livers is described. Incubation of SVA with mouse liver preparations fortified with CoASH and ATP led to formation of SV and two major products (P1 and P2). Based on mass spectrometry (MS), tandem mass spectrometry, and/or NMR spectral characteristics, P1 was an alpha,beta-unsaturated metabolite, formed by dehydration of the D,D-dihydroxy heptanoic acid side chain, whereas P2 was probably the L,D-dihydroxy acid isomer of SVA, formed by stereospecific hydration of P1. When NAD(+) was also included in the incubation mixture, there were two additional metabolites with the MS and/or NMR characteristics consistent with a two-carbon shortened product (P3) and its dehydrated derivative (P4). In a complete incubation system with all cofactors (ATP, CoASH, NAD(+), and NADPH) present, there was an additional product with MS spectra and liquid chromatography retention time identical to the beta-oxidized, unsubstituted pentanoic acid metabolite (P5) detected in rats and mice following simvastatin administration. The involvement of CoASH and NAD(+) and the presence of the four metabolic intermediates suggest that SVA (and presumably the other statins) is a substrate for the beta-oxidation enzyme complex in mice. Additionally, the present finding of CoASH-dependent formation of SV substantiates a mechanism proposed previously for the in vivo lactonization of statin hydroxy acids.",

Method development was conducted in a fused-silica capillary (L = 86 cm, L(eff) = 58 cm and 75 microm i.d.) and a background electrolyte consisting of 10 mM borate at pH 8 was used. The separation was performed by current-controlled system applying 41 microA, detecting at 239 nm and injecting 0.5 s vacuum injection. A good electropherogram and excellent repeatability was obtained. FLU and phenobarbital sodium (internal standard) migrated (with RSD%) at 4.8 (0.3) min and 5.2 (0.6) min, respectively. Limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) values were found to be 1 x 10(-6) M and 2.89 x 10(-6) M, respectively. Linearity in the range of 1.03 x 10(-5) -5.15 x 10(-5) M was examined employing intra-day and inter-day studies and well-correlated calibration equations were obtained. FLU in a capsule (Lescol 40 mg declared) was found to be 41.9 +/- 0.4 mg. Furthermore, FLU was determined in serum applying standard addition technique. Good repeatability and no interference were observed. The method proposed is simple, sensitive, precise and easy to use for the determination of FLU in capsule and serum.",

Unusual pharmacokinetic profiles were obtained, including high binding percentage with plasma protein (> 99%), a short elimination half-life (< 4 hr) and a relatively large Vd-area (0.5 L/kg). These profiles indicate that some active transport mechanisms are involved in FNX disposition. The recovery of FNX from urine was approximately 9 % of the dose within 24 hr following the injection. The estimated renal clearance of the unbound drug nearly corresponded to the renal blood flow rates, indicating that active tubular secretion in the renal re-absorptive tract may be involved in the disposition. The effect of a concomitant administration of pravastatin (PV) on FNX disposition was also examined. PV is a representative substrate of a transporter in human liver cells (OATP-2). After the PV administrations, the Vd-area of FNX and total body clearance markedly decreased, indicating that FNX is actively taken up and metabolized in liver cells by an OATP-2 like transporter. In conclusion, there are at least 2 active transport pathways for FNX pharmacokinetics in rabbits, one is renal tubular secretion and the other is in the sinusoidal section of the liver.",

Because chylomicrons stimulate C3 production by adipocytes in vitro, we investigated plasma C3 changes in vivo after an oral fat load. Thirty-seven subjects (20 normolipidemic patients with coronary artery disease [CAD] and 17 healthy control subjects) underwent an oral fat load (50 g/m(2)). C3 was measured at baseline and at 2-hour intervals after fat intake for 10 hours. The effects of lipid lowering by simvastatin were evaluated in 16 patients. Fasting plasma C3 was 1.06+/-0.26 and 0.90+/-0.12 g/L in CAD patients and control subjects, respectively. Fasting C3 was correlated with several parameters associated with insulin resistance. The best determinant of fasting C3 was waist circumference (adjusted R(2)=0.48, beta=0.71, P<0.001); the addition of postprandial triglyceridemia to the model improved it (adjusted R(2)=0.63). Plasma C3 levels at 2, 4, and 6 hours after fat ingestion were significantly higher than fasting levels in patients and control subjects. C3 increased maximally to 1.39+/-0.33 g/L in patients and to 1.11+/-0.18 g/L in control subjects (P<0.01 for patients versus control subjects). Total postprandial triglyceridemia was the best determinant of maximal C3 increase (adjusted R(2)=0.47, beta=0.70; P<0.001). Treatment with simvastatin decreased fasting and postprandial C3 by 6% and 39%, respectively (P<0.05 for both versus no treatment). Postprandial plasma C3 concentrations increase in CAD patients and control subjects. Fasting C3 is associated with waist circumference, but postprandial C3 increment is associated with postprandial lipemia.

In agreement with previous literature, a strict structural requirement exists on the external ring, and 4-fluorophenyl is the most active in this system. For the central ring, substitution on positions 6, 7, and 8 of the central quinoline nucleus moderately affected the potency, whereas the alkyl side chain on the 2-position had a more pronounced influence on activity. Among the derivatives, NK-104 (pitavastatin calcium), which has a cyclopropyl group as the alkyl side chain, showed the greatest potency. We found that further modulation and improvement in potency at inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase was obtained by having the optimal substituents flanking the desmethylmevalonic acid portion, that is, 4-fluorophenyl and cyclopropyl, instead of the usual isopropyl group.", 
    "127": "C-reactive protein (CRP) is the prototype acute phase reactant and therefore a marker of systemic inflammation. In the last decades, accumulating data have demonstrated the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of ischemic heart disease. High CRP levels, measured by high-sensitivity methods, on admission have a short-term negative prognostic value and are associated with a worse outcome. In epidemiological studies, minor elevations of CRP are associated with future risk of myocardial infarction, stroke and peripheral vascular disease. This increased risk is independent of other biochemical and clinical risk factors, and the association between high CRP and an abnormal cholesterol ratio significantly increases the risk in the individual patient. Finally, the observation of an increased level of CRP may be of clinical utility in primary prevention, because these subjects favourably benefit from statin therapy.",

Expression of LOX-1 is involved in the pathobiological effects of oxidized-LDL in endothelial cells, including apoptosis, suppression of cNOS activity and cell adhesion. Recent studies show that intracellular signal protein kinase B (PKB) is involved in the regulation of cNOS. Further, HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) may affect LOX-1 expression. In this study, we examined the modulation of LOX-1 expression and PKB activity in response to oxidized-LDL by two different statins (simvastatin and atorvastatin).",

Oxidized-LDL (40 microg/ml) was found to upregulate the expression of LOX-1 (mRNA and protein), enhance [125I]-ox-LDL uptake and to reduce the phosphorylation of PKB (p-PKB). Two different statins, simvastatin and atorvastatin (each 1 and 10 microM), upregulated the activity of PKB and decreased LOX-1 expression and [125I]-ox-LDL uptake. A high concentration of statins (10 microM) gave a more potent effect than the low concentration (1 microM). The effects of the two different statins were similar.",

While some uncertainty exists about the clinical significance of improving high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels, large primary- and secondary-prevention studies aimed at lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels with statins have convincingly reduced CHD events and total mortality. Despite the strong clinical evidence and widely publicized treatment guidelines, many hyperlipidemic patients receive inadequate lipid-lowering treatment.

    "140": "To clarify the mechanism of the stimulatory effect of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) on bone formation, we investigated the effect of pitavastatin, a newly developed statin, on expression of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2) and osteocalcin in primary cultured human osteoblasts. Pitavastatin increased the expression level of mRNA for BMP-2, and much more effectively for osteocalcin. This stimulatory effect was abolished by the addition of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, an essential molecule for prenylation of small GTP-binding proteins such as Rho GTPase, but not by inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase and various protein kinases. Pitavastatin suppressed the Rho-associated kinase (Rho-kinase) activity. Hydroxyfasudil, a specific inhibitor of Rho-kinase, increased BMP-2 and osteocalcin expression. These mRNA levels were strongly suppressed by dexamethasone, but restored by co-treatment with hydroxyfasudil. These observations suggest that the Rho-kinase negatively regulates bone formation and the inhibition of Rho and Rho-kinase pathway is the major mechanism of the statin effect on bone. Moreover, a Rho-kinase inhibitor may be a new therapeutic reagent for the treatment of osteoporosis such as glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis.", 
    "141": "Clinical trials in the 1990s using HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) showed that cholesterol-lowering treatment significantly reduces cardiovascular events including strokes in the primary and secondary prevention of myocardial infarction (MI). Paradoxically, the link between serum cholesterol level and the incidence of stroke remains to be fully established. This is largely due to conflicting evidence from a series of observational cohort studies and a suggestion that lowering serum cholesterol increased the risk for hemorrhagic stroke. These findings have tended to influence the treatment of stroke, despite alternative interpretations for the failure of these studies to find a clear association between cholesterol levels and stroke. The statin trials present a strong argument for a reappraisal of the link between cholesterol and stroke. Three meta-analyses have all shown a relative risk reduction in stroke of 12 to 48% in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) after MI. There was no statistically significant increase in hemorrhagic stroke. Recently, gemfibrozil has also been shown to reduce the relative risk for stroke (25%), which contradicts the findings of previous fibrate trials. It is becoming clear that the clinical action of many cholesterol-lowering drugs is the result of pleiotropic/antiatherogenic effects rather than simply a reduction in cholesterol. There is also evidence that these agents exert direct effects that promote atherosclerotic plaque stability. After these observations, it is now generally accepted that lipid-lowering treatment should be considered in all stroke patients with a history of CHD/MI. However, for the remaining patients with ischemic stroke, there is no proven therapeutic approach, and several large randomized, placebo-controlled trials are under way or planned for this indication.", 
    "142": "Simvastatin, a hydroxymethyl glutarate coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, is a commonly used cholesterol lowering agent. The long-term safety profile of simvastatin, established over ten-years of clinical use, is excellent. Both rhabdomyolysis and hepatitis, however, are recognized toxic effects of this medication, and generally occur when the patients are taking more than 40 mg of simvastatin a day. Potent inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzyme increase the incidence of simvastatin toxicity. Calcium channel blockers are weak inhibitors of the CYP3A4 enzyme. Diltiazem is known to increase the serum concentration of simvastatin. Many patients who take both simvastatin and diltiazem require lower doses of simvastatin to achieve the recommended reduction in cholesterol. Since diltiazem is known to increase plasma levels of lovastatin, a similar phenomenon may occur with simvastatin. Our patient had been stable for three years on simvastatin therapy. His rhabdomyolysis and hepatitis coincided with the addition of diltiazem. This is the first report of the combined toxicities of rhabdomyolysis and hepatitis being induced by the addition of diltiazem to simvastatin therapy. This patient serves as a reminder to the clinician of the potential interaction of these two commonly used drugs.", 
    "143": "The authors present the results of experimental and clinical trials of recombinant genes coding the synthesis of endothelial growth factors VEGF, bFGF. Single transendocardial administration of these genes' DNA into the zone of hybernating myocardium in some patients with CHD caused in 3-6 months significant increase in perfusion, left ventricular ejection fraction, decrease in stenocardic pang rate, increase in exercise tolerance. The marked clinical effect was achieved when these drugs were introduced into ischemized tissue in patients with obliterating atherosclerosis of lower extremity arteries. Development of the methods for studying endothelial function available for wide clinical practice will permit to raise the efficiency of initial and secondary prophylaxis of arterial hypertension, CHD. Today the evaluation and correction of endothelial dysfunction is the new and the most perspective direction in cardiology development.", 
    "144": "We studied phospholipid composition of high-density lipoproteins in patients with normo- and hypertriglyceridemia treated with various hypolipidemic preparations (simvastatin and fenofibrate). Both preparations changed phospholipid composition of high-density lipoproteins and improved their functional activity. The differences in the phospholipid composition of high-density lipoproteins were probably related to lipolysis of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins catalyzed by lipoprotein lipase and, in particular, hepatic lipase.", 
    "145": "Animal studies, experimental models on cell lines, and epidemiological case-control studies have all suggested the possibility that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors have a beneficial effect on bone metabolism. However, all epidemiological studies are not prospective in nature and based on either measurement of bone mineral density or fracture risk. They also differ in recruitment criteria, definition of statin exposure, and outcome assessment. We performed a first prospective study using specific biochemical bone markers on 17 hypercholesterolaemic non-osteoporotic subjects treated with a therapeutic dose of simvastatin 20 mg daily for 4 weeks. Our results show that serum osteocalcin concentration increased significantly (p-value < 0.05) 4 weeks after therapy, whereas other bone markers including serum bone-specific alkaline phosphatase activity, urine deoxypyridinoline, and urine cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen did not show any significant changes. Our data support that simvastatin causes a beneficial effect on bone metabolism as reflected by an increase in serum osteocalcin concentration. This added beneficial effect of statins on bone metabolism could potentially allow statins to become the first effective anabolic agent for the treatment of osteoporosis. We urge that priority should be given to a randomised controlled study to re-evaluate this group of drugs.", 
    "146": "A 41-year-old man who had been taking pravastatin for two years developed hypersensitivity pneumonitis. The initial examination found intestinal pneumonitis and hypereosinophilia. The patient's syndromes gradually resolved with withdrawal of pravastatin. As HMG coenzyme A reductase inhibitors are commonly prescribed, any respiratory symptoms in this setting should be considered with special attention.", 
    "147": "Recent studies suggest that statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) not only reduce the incidence of stroke by lowering cholesterol levels but may also exert neuroprotective effects via a mechanism not related to their lipid-lowering effect. Despite the growing body of evidence, however, the neuroprotective effect of statins in stroke is still controversial. Herein, we studied whether a prophylactic administration of simvastatin (Sim) provides significant protection against brain damage, and we sought to determine its long-lasting behavioral consequences in a neonatal model of hypoxia/ischemia.", 
    "148": "Newborn male rats were injected daily from postnatal days 1 to 7 with activated Sim (20 mg/kg) or an equivalent volume of vehicle. On postnatal day 7, the rats were subjected to ligation of the right common carotid artery, followed by 3 hours of hypoxia or by sham operation. The neuroprotective effect of Sim was evaluated after the rats had achieved adulthood by using a battery of behavioral tests and histological analysis.", 
    "149": "Sim-treated ischemic rats performed the circular water maze, the radial arm maze, and the multiple-choice water maze significantly better than did vehicle-treated ischemic rats. Furthermore, in contrast to the ischemic rats, hypoxia/ischemia-injured rats pretreated with Sim were not hyperactive at weaning and showed less behavioral asymmetry. Consistently, it was found that brain damage was significantly attenuated.", 
    "150": "These findings indicate that prophylactic administration of statins may provide a potential neuroprotective strategy leading to an improvement in functional outcome in ischemic stroke. However, toxicity concern must be addressed before these agents can be directed to the asphyxiated fetus or newborn."
