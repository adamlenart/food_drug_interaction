    "0": "Increased plasma cholesterol concentration in hypercholesterolemic patients is a major risk factor for atherosclerosis. The impaired removal of plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) in these patients results in the presence of their LDL in the plasma for a long period of time and thus can contribute to its enhanced oxidative modification. In the present study we analyzed the effect of the hypocholesterolemic drug, fluvastatin, on plasma and LDL susceptibilities to oxidation during 24 weeks of therapy. Fluvastatin therapy (40 mg/day for 24 weeks) in 10 hypercholesterolemic patients resulted in 30%, 34% and 22% decrements in plasma levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, respectively. This effect has been achieved after only 4 weeks of therapy. We next studied the effect of fluvastatin therapy on LDL susceptibility to oxidation in vivo and in vitro. 2.2-Azobis, 2-amidinopropane hydrochloride (AAPH, 100 mM)-induced plasma lipid peroxidation was decreased by 70% and 77% after 12 weeks and 24 weeks of fluvastatin therapy respectively. The lag time required for the initiation of CuSO4 (10 microM)-induced LDL oxidation was prolonged by 1.2- and 2.5-fold, after 12 and 24 weeks of fluvastatin therapy respectively. We next analyzed the in vitro effect of fluvastatin on plasma and LDL susceptibilities to oxidation. Preincubation of plasma or LDLs that were obtained from normal subjects with 0.1 microgram/ml of fluvastatin, caused 20% or 57% reduction in AAPH-induced lipid peroxidation, respectively. Similarly, a 1.6- and 2.7-fold prolongation of the lag time required for CuSO4-induced LDL oxidation was found following LDL incubation with 0.1 and 1.0 microgram/ml of fluvastatin, respectively. To find out possible mechanisms that contribute to this inhibitory effect of fluvastatin on LDL oxidizability, we analyzed the antioxidative properties of fluvastatin. Fluvastatin did not scavenge free radicals and did not inhibit linoleic acid peroxidation. Fluvastatin also did not act as a chelator of copper ions. However, fluvastatin was shown to specifically bind mainly to the LDL surface phospholipids and this interaction altered the lipoprotein charge as evident from the 38% decrement in the electrophoretic mobility of fluvastatin-treated LDL, in comparison to nontreated LDL. The inhibitory effect of fluvastatin therapy on LDL oxidation probably involves both its stimulatory effect on LDL removal from the circulation, as well as a direct binding effect of the drug to the lipoprotein. We thus conclude that the antiatherogenic properties of fluvastatin may not be limited to its hypocholesterolemic effect, but could also be related to its ability to reduce LDL oxidizability.", 
    "1": "Cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) enzymes are activated for entry into the S phase of the cell cycle. Elimination of Cdk inhibitor protein p27Kip1 during the G1 to S phase is required for the activation process. An inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase prevents its elimination and leads to G1 arrest. Mevalonate and its metabolite, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, but not farnesyl pyrophosphate, restore the inhibitory effect of pravastatin on the degradation of p27 and allow Cdk2 activation. By the addition of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, Rho small GTPase(s) are geranylgeranylated and translocated to membranes during G1/S progression. The restoring effect of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate is abolished with botulinum C3 exoenzyme, which specifically inactivates Rho. These results indicate (i) among mevalonate metabolites, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate is absolutely required for the elimination of p27 followed by Cdk2 activation; (ii) geranylgeranylated Rho small GTPase(s) promote the degradation of p27 during G1/S transition in FRTL-5 cells.", 
    "2": "This study was carried out to assess the efficacy, safety and tolerability of fluvastatin as monotherapy in the treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia. This multicenter study started with 467 patients but only 315 subjects completed 12 weeks treatment. Patients followed a standard lipid-lowering diet for 3 weeks before entering and throughout the study. Every patient received fluvastatin 20 mg once daily with the evening meal for the first 6 weeks, from week 7 to week 12 the daily dose was changed to one capsule 40 mg daily in the evening. Results showed that the mean percent changes in lipid parameters between baseline and endpoint was as follows: LDL-C (-32.7%); total cholesterol (-29.42%), triglycerides (-19.7%) and HDL-C (16.6%). Meanwhile, the mean percent increase in liver enzymes between baseline and endpoint was 17.2% for ASAT and 20.3% for ALAT, respectively, but the mean values of both enzymes at the endpoint were within normal range. The most frequent side effects being gastrointestinal (4.3%) including dyspepsia, nausea, flatulence and diarrhea. In conclusion, fluvastatin as monotherapy in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia among Saudis was found to be safe, well tolerated and produced a significant improvement in the overall lipid parameters.", 
    "3": "Mevalonate pathway inhibitor lovastatin inhibited proliferation of human multidrug-resistant promyelocytic leukemia HL-60/ADR cells in vitro, with MRP-gene coded p190 mediated drug resistance, to a markedly lesser extent than that of the parental drug sensitive HL-60 cells and also that of the other human multidrug resistant (MDR-1, P-glycoprotein) myeloid leukemia cell line HL-60/VCR. The sensitivity of the examined human leukemia cell lines to the cytostatic activity of lovastatin correlated approximately with the potential of lovastatin to induce the characteristic cell cycle alteration (i.e. the accumulation of lovastatin-treated cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle). The P-glycoprotein positive HL-60/VCR cells and the parental drug sensitive HL-60 cells were more sensitive to this cell cycle alteration than the HL-60/ADR multidrug resistant leukemia cells with MRP drug resistance. Lovastatin (72 hours, 20 micromol) induced apoptosis and cell necrosis in HL-60 cells, apoptosis but not cell necrosis in HL-60/VCR cells and neither apoptosis nor necrosis in HL-60/ADR cells.", 
    "4": "Statins are most potent lipid-lowering drugs. The mechanisms of their action is specific inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) activity. HMG-CoA reductase catalyses the reduction of HMG-CoA o mevalonate and is rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Mevalonate is considered to be not only an important intermediate of cholesterol synthesis, but also the source of isoprenoids which play important role in DNA replication and cell growth. It was shown that statins inhibit the proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cell--key events in atherogenesis. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors lower the reactivity of arterial wall to vasoconstrictor agents, decrease the concentration of lipoprotein [a]--an independent risk factor of atherosclerosis, inhibit the generation of free radicals and lipid peroxidation, decrease the number of macrophages in atherosclerotic lesion and finally, equilibrate the clotting-fibrynolysis processes of attennuating platelets function, reducing the tissue factor synthesis and decreasing the concentration of plasminogen activator inhibitors. Statins are presently considered by NCEP to be the drugs of first choice for treatment of hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "5": "The influence of elevated concentration of lipids in blood on the concentration of drugs in organism was observed in 1976. The following experiments have revealed that pharmacokinetics of lipophilic drugs in hyperlipidemia is altered. The purpose of this paper was to evaluate the effect of hypolipemic treatment on the propranolol pharmacokinetics, to take into account phenotype of hydroxylation and type of primary hyperlipidemia. The study was carried out on 37 patients (34 patients EM and 3 patients PM) with hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia and mixed form of hyperlipidemia. Duration of hypolipemic therapy was 30 days. Pharmacokinetic studies were carried out twice i.e. at the onset of the study and following a 30-day period of hypolipemic treatment. Propranolol was given orally as a single dose 80 mg. Blood serum was sampled during administration. HPLC method was used to determine blood serum concentration of propranolol. The one-compartment model was applied for calculation of pharmacokinetic parameters. The obtained results have disclosed that hypolipemic therapy altered pharmacokinetic parameters of propranolol. Intensity and course of these changes depend on the type of hyperlipidemia. The most pronounced changes were observed in patients EM with hypertriglyceridemia. Lowering of propranolol concentration in blood, elevated penetration into tissues and accelerated elimination were revealed (Fig. 3, 4). Similar changes, but lesser intensity were observed in patients with mixed form of hyperlipidemia (Fig 5, 6). Alteration of pharmacokinetic parameters of propranolol in hypercholesterolemic patients were slight and contrasting the patients with hypertriglyceridemia and mixed form of hyperlipidemia. The lowering of cholesterol concentration in blood has slight influence on normalization of propranolol kinetics (Fig 1, 2). In patients with phenotype PM pharmacokinetic parameters of propranolol were changed, under used treatment too. Due to the limited number of patients, conclusions should be carefully drawn. The actual results have disclosed a decrease in lipids concentration, mainly triglycerides, which causes changes in pharmacokinetics of propranolol in patients with phenotype PM as well.", 
    "6": "The potentiality of twenty-five fungal species belonging to 14 genera isolated from Egyptian soils to produce mevinolin, a hypocholesterolemic agent, when grown on selected substrates was tested. For the first screening samples of culture filtrates were tested by TLC and the positive results were further estimated by HPLC analysis. It was found that nearly one-third of the tested fungi showed positive results as to production of mevinolin. Aspergillus terreus was distinguished by its capacity to produce mevinolin when cultivated on a selected medium. The maximum mevinolin yields were achieved after on 8-d incubation at 30 degrees C. An initial pH value of 5-6 was found to be the optimum for growth of A. terreus and mevinolin production.",

A single 20-mg i.v. dose was employed, followed by daily oral dosing of 20 mg over four hemodialysis intervals.", 
    "8": "No statistical differences in the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin or SQ 31,906 were evident when comparing the first and last days of oral dosing with pravastatin. The pharmacokinetic parameters of pravastatin and SQ 31,906 were similar to those of healthy volunteers. SQ 31,945, the inactive polar metabolite, did accumulate in dialysis patients, as evidenced by an accumulation index of 1.7 +/- 1.0. Although metabolic clearance is the predominant mode of elimination of pravastatin, hemodialysis clearances of pravastatin, SQ 31,906 and SQ 31,945 will contribute to total body clearance since dialytic clearance ranged from 40 to 80 ml.min-1.",

    "10": "Patients with heterozygous family hypercholesterolemia (HFH) were divided into two groups. Group 1 patients received lovastatin in a daily dose 40-60-80 mg under control of lipids and peripheral blood biochemistry. In 17 patients lovastatin was given as monotherapy, in 15 patients it was combined with plasmapheresis. No hypolipidemic therapy was given to ten patients of group 2. The treatment and follow-up lasted for 4.1 +/- 1.9 years, on the average. A marked hypolipidemic effect was seen in the comorbid therapy. 43% of the patients became resistant to lovastatin, the resistance developed more frequently in monotherapy. The blood fibrinogen fell by 40%, spontaneous and induced platelet aggregation returned to normal, being somewhat higher in subjects resistant to lovastatin therapy. The study shows that hypolipidemic therapy has reduced the risk of IHD fatal complications and progression of non-coronary atherosclerosis in patients of group 1.", 
    "11": "The anti-arteriosclerotic effects of ethyl all-cis-5, 8, 11, 14, 17-icosapentaenoate (EPA-E), pravastatin and their combination in cuff-treated rabbits were investigated. EPA-E at 600 mg/kg, pravastatin at 50 mg/kg or their combination was orally administered once daily for 5 weeks, and each of the animals was sheathed with a cuff on the carotid artery 2 weeks after the beginning of drug administration. EPA-E, pravastatin and their combination significantly reduced serum total cholesterol compared to the control group. EPA-E also potently reduced serum triglyceride, while pravastatin only slightly reduced it. The combination of these two agents had the most potent effect on the level of serum triglyceride. Serum phospholipids were also reduced by these treatments in a similar fashion. At the end of treatment, diffuse intimal thickening was observed in the cuff-covered region in all animals in the control group, and the intima/media area ratio in this group was 0.293 +/- 0.038. Treatment with EPA-E alone tended to prevent the intimal thickening, and the intima/media area ratio was 0.209 +/- 0.058 (p = 0.094). This ratio was 0.287 +/- 0.048 (p = 0.902) when pravastatin was administered alone, indicating that it had no significant effect on intimal thickening. The ratio was 0.175 +/- 0.041 (p = 0.042) when both EPA-E and pravastatin were administered, indicating that this combination had a significant inhibitory effect on intimal thickening in the cuff-sheathed region. These findings suggest that combined treatment with EPA-E and pravastatin is more effective than respective monotherapies in lowering serum lipids and/or preventing an intimal thickening as events of atherogenesis.",

LDL were separated by ultracentrifugation. LDL were reduced by 18%, LDL-C by 29% and LDL-TG by 19%. The concentrations of alpha-tocopherol and retinol in LDL changed insignificantly. LDL preparations were incubated with copper ions (204 mumol.1(-1) LDL-C/3.2 mumol.1(-1) Cu) and formation of conjugated dienes was monitored at 234 nm for 5 h. Treatment with fluvastatin caused a reduction of diene production by 16% and of diene production rate by 14%, effects being significantly different from placebo (P = 0.02). The change of the lagtime did not reach significance; however, it was positively correlated with the change in LDL alpha-tocopherol. In the placebo group, no significant effects were observed.",

These values were similar to previous reports. The high-density lipoprotein (HDL) level, however, did not change significantly, although previous reports have shown an elevation of HDL levels. In an attempt to explain the origin of this difference, we studied the pretreatment value dependence of the cholesterol change using regression analysis. We found that pravastatin raised the HDL level in those cases where pretreatment values were lower than 58 mg.dl-1 and reduced it for higher values. We also showed that the reductions of TC, LDL and triglyceride (TG) levels correlated positively with their pretreatment values.",

HDL-C was unchanged and total and LDL-C presented a reduction of approximately 10% with diet orientation. After 10 mg of pravastatin there was a reduction of around 30% of total and LDL-C and a 13% HDL-C elevation. The presence of risk factors did not influence significantly the drug effect, but it is possible to observe that those who smoke and males had lower levels of HDL-C. Obesity and diabetes patients presented greater levels of triglycerides. Therapeutic response to pravastatin is slightly smaller in males and after menopause.",

This syndrome is a rare genetic disease inherited by the autosome-dominant type. It arises because of underdevelopment of tissues of mesodermal and ectodermal origin and is characterized by hypoplasia or absence of patella, ulnar dysplasia, nail plate dystrophy, growths on the iliac bones, renal affection. The disease was detected in early childhood. Renal affection presented with urinary syndrome with a concurrent nephrotic syndrome later on followed by moderate arterial hypertension and progression to renal failure. Renal biopsy revealed the picture of focal segmentary glomerular hyalinosis typical for this disorder. Because immunodepressants were thought inadequate, the treatment included lovastatin and inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme to inhibit non-immune mechanisms of the disease progression.",

Adjunctive therapy with Q10 may allow for a reduction of other pharmacological therapies, improvement in quality of life, and a decrease in the incidence of cardiac complications in congestive heart failure. However, dosing, clinical application, bioavailability and dissolution of CoQ10 deserve careful scrutiny whenever employing the nutrient. The assessment of blood levels in 'therapeutic failures' appears warranted.", 
    "25": "The individual and combined effects of ethanol and lovastatin on rats and their prevention by supplemental coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) was studied. The ethanol and lovastatin findings are reported elsewhere. This paper focuses on the food restriction which occurred in rats fed 35% of energy as ethanol and those control rats pair-fed to the 35% of energy as ethanol group. Six groups of rats received 35% of energy as ethanol (with or without lovastatin and/or CoQ10 treatment). One group served as a 0% ethanol ad libitum control and one 0% ethanol control group was pair-fed to the 35% ethanol group. Rats receiving 35% of energy as ethanol and their pair-fed controls consumed 83% of the energy/day consumed by the ad libitum controls. This was consistent regardless of lovastatin or CoQ10 treatment. Weight gains were 84% of control. The energy reduction was consistently associated with a substantial (48%+) increase in liver CoQ9 concentrations. Reports by others of associations between food restriction and increased longevity in rodents has focused on a decrease in oxidant damage in tissues of food restricted animals. The increase in CoQ levels in the food restricted animals would result in an increase in antioxidant protection and might explain the observed increases in longevity.",

Forty-five hypercholesterolemic patients were randomized in a double-blind trial in order to be treated with increasing dosages of either lovastatin (20-80 mg/day) or pravastatin (10-40 mg/day) over a period of 18 weeks. Serum levels of coenzyme Q10 were measured parallel to the levels of cholesterol at baseline on placebo and diet and during active treatment. A dose-related significant decline of the total serum level of coenzyme Q10 was found in the pravastatin group from 1.27 +/- 0.34 at baseline to 1.02 +/- 0.31 mmol/l at the end of the study period (mean +/- S.D.), P < 0.01. After lovastatin therapy the decrease was significant as well and more pronounced, from 1.18 +/- 0.36 to 0.84 +/- 0.17 mmol/l, P < 0.001. Although HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are safe and effective within a limited time horizon, continued vigilance of a possible adverse consequence from coenzyme Q10 lowering seems important during long-term therapy.", 
    "27": "A randomised trial of simvastatin and enalapril in patients with chronic renal failure on dialysis: effects on serum lipoprotein concentrations and left ventricular mass. Left ventricular hypertrophy and abnormalities of lipoprotein metabolism are both possible contributors to the high risk of cardiovascular death in patients with chronic renal failure on dialysis. We investigated the effects of simvastatin on lipid and lipoprotein concentrations and the effects of enalapril on left ventricular mass in 107 patients receiving haemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Patients were randomised in a factorial design to receive simvastatin (10 mg daily) or placebo and enalapril (2.5-5 mg daily) or placebo. During follow-up, there was a significant excess of patients withdrawn from enalapril because of hypotension (2p = 0.002), and after 6 months only 55% of those assigned enalapril were still on treatment. From baseline to 6 months, there were no statistically significant differences in left ventricular mass or left ventricular dimensions between patients assigned enalapril and those assigned placebo. Among the patients assigned simvastatin, total cholesterol was reduced by 13% (2p = 0.001), LDL cholesterol was reduced by 17% (2p = 0.003) and apolipoprotein B was reduced by 12% (2p = 0.005) compared to patients assigned placebo. There were borderline significant (2p = 0.05 to 0.08) reductions in VLDL cholesterol, total triglyceride and VLDL triglycerides of 26%, 12% and 17% respectively.

Cholesterol-poor BAEC were obtained by treating the cells with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors under 10% low density lipoprotein (LDL)-deficient serum condition for 2 days. Simvastatin reduced the intracellular cholesterol content significantly at a concentration of 0.1 microgram/ml. The reduction in the cholesterol content was accompanied by the enhancement of the cell membrane fluidity which was measured by a photobleaching technique. Additional data suggested that the reduction in cholesterol content referred to the reduction in the proliferation of BAEC.", 
    "29": "In view of inducing action of hyperlipidemia on progression of nephropathy and relationships between thrombogenesis, atherogenesis and sclerosis, the authors examined fluvastatin effects on platelet-rheological hemostasis. The 12-week course in a dose 20-40 mg/ day produced minimal side effects while its hypolipidemic action was noticeable: a 18, 21 and 20% fall in concentrations of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, respectively. The platelet rheology underwent the following changes: spontaneous platelet aggregation went down from 2.58 +/- 0.3 to 1.64 +/- 0.27 r.units, ADP-induced platelet aggregation rose from 6.5 +/- 0.66 to 8.08 +/- 0.77 r.units. No marked changes were registered in hematocrit, plasma and blood density, red cell aggregation and deformability. Thus, active lowering of blood lipids was not associated with evident inhibition of platelet activity. The absence of this feedback in lipid-platelet relations probably indicates an independent significance of hemostatic disturbances in ischemic heart disease and needs further study.", 
    "30": "Hyperlipidaemia of 18 male and 20 female patients following successful renal transplantation was treated with daily 20 mg fluvastatin (Lescol) for 12 weeks. The patients were several months after transplantation, and their total cholesterol levels exceeded 6.5 mmol/l following an 8-week diet. The effect of fluvastatin on the levels of total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglyceride, Apo A1 and Apo B, as well as of lipoprotein(a) was examined. Furthermore, changes of the renal function (GFR-urea, creatinine, uric acid) and hepatic function (bilirubin, GOT, GPT, CPK, ALP) were followed up, together with the body weight and blood pressure. The results of the examinations are summarized as follows: Fluvastatin may be administered effectively and without side effects in a daily dose of 20 mg in appropriately selected renal transplant patients. The average total cholesterol values, which were 7.91 mmol/l in men and 7.78 mmol/l in women following the diet, were reduced by 22-25% (p < 0.001) after 6 and 12 weeks, respectively, of fluvastatin treatment. The levels of LDL also decreased significantly (p < 0.001): in response to a 20 mg evening dosage, reduction of more than 25% was observed in 78% of men and 65% of women. Reductions of the Apo B levels were more pronounced in the females (18.3% men vs. 21.2% women). The ratio C/HDL-C decreased both in men (from 5.49 to 4.19) and in women (from 4.83 to 4.02). The ratio Apo B/Apo A1 also decreased (men: from 0.86 to 0.73, women: from 0.73 to 0.66). The concentrations of HDL and Apo A1 did not increase significantly, the reductions in the levels of triglyceride and lipoprotein(a) were not considerable either. An increase in the levels of hepatic enzymes and CPK was not encountered during the administration of fluvastatin. In two patients the levels of serum bilirubin increased by 2-4 micromol/l. Three patients complained about temporary myalgias of the sacroiliac or lumbar region which, however, were not accompanied by elevated CPK levels. The monitored levels of cyclosporine, urea and creatinine did not increase significantly during the 12 weeks of treatment. Two patients had temporary gastric complaints.",

    "33": "Cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 (PLA2) is known to be phosphorylated and activated by MAP kinase (Lin et al 1993, Cell 72: 269-278), an important downstream component of signal transduction, whereas paclitaxel has been shown to inhibit isoprenylation of ras proteins (Danesi et al 1995, Mol Pharmacol 47: 1106-1111). Given that quinacrine (Q), a PLA2 inhibitor, and paclitaxel (P) might act at different sites in the cell signalling pathway, our aim was to test whether they were synergistic in combination against prostate cancer cells. Cell viability of PC-3, PC-3M and DU145 cells in 96 - well plates was assessed 96 h after drugs were added concurrently. Using Chou analysis, we demonstrated synergy for the combination against all three cell lines. Further, synergy was present under both conservative (mutually non-exclusive) and non-conservative (mutually exclusive) models. Studies in the nude mouse xenograft model support the finding of synergy in vitro. In DU145-bearing mice, Q (50 mg kg(-1)) and P (0.5 mg kg(-1)) given daily for 12 consecutive days, either concurrently or sequentially, was more effective than either drug alone, at twice the dose intensity. In an enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA) apoptosis assay, arachidonic acid was able to partially reverse Q- and P-induced apoptosis, suggesting PLA2 pathway involvement. Finally, the combination of lovastatin, another inhibitor of ras isoprenylation, and quinacrine had synergistic inhibitory effects on the growth of PC-3 cells in vitro, suggesting that the combination of these two classes of compounds might serve as an attractive therapeutic approach for prostate cancer.", 
    "34": "The study included 30 IHD patients with primary hypercholesterolemia (22 males and 8 females). 18 and 12 patients have received a single daily dose of fluvastatin 20 and 40 mg, respectively, in the evening for 12 weeks. The drug effect was assessed by changes in the clinical status, lipid spectrum, transport-metabolic and absorption-secretory functions of the liver. IHD patients with hypercholesterolemia were found to have dysfunction of the hepatobiliary system. Fluvastatin treatment reduced the level of total cholesterol (Ch), LDLP Ch, triglycerides. HDLP Ch levels remained unchanged. Atherogenic lipoproteins aggregation diminished. Positive changes occurred in hepatic metabolism: bilirubin concentrations lowered, serum albumin went up, absorption-secretory function of hepatocytes normalized, hepatic mono-oxidase system activated. Fluvastatin-related hepatic damage was not reported in the course of 12-month follow-up.", 
    "35": "Intestinal brush-border membrane transport of monocarboxylic acids was investigated by using rabbit intestinal brush-border membrane vesicles (BBMVs) and isolated intestinal tissues mounted on Ussing-type chambers. [3H]Mevalonic acid uptake by BBMVs showed an overshoot phenomenon in the presence of an inwardly directed proton gradient, but not in the presence of an inwardly directed sodium gradient or an outwardly directed HCO3- or chloride gradient. Initial uptake of mevalonic acid was saturable in the presence of a proton gradient. Uptake of [3H]mevalonic acid was inhibited by various monocarboxylic acids, including acetic acid, benzoic acid, lactic acid, nicotinic acid, pravastatin, salicylic acid and valproic acid, but not by dicarboxylic acid or amino acids. Acetic acid, which is transported by both anion antiport and proton-coupled transport systems, induced serosal bicarbonate-dependent alkalinization in the mucosal-side bathing solution of rabbit jejunal tissues, when examined in Ussing-type chambers. Pravastatin, which is a structural analogue of mevalonic acid and is absorbed via proton-coupled transport like mevalonic acid, did not. The result demonstrates that acetic acid is transported by the bicarbonate-dependent anion antiport system, whereas pravastatin is not. So, it is suggested that monocarboxylic acids are transported by at least two independent transporters, namely, a proton-coupled transporter for most monocarboxylic acids, including mevalonic acid, pravastatin and acetic acid, and an anion antiporter for acetic acid, but not for mevalonic acid or pravastatin. Activation of anion antiporter can induce HCO3- secretion in intact intestine.",

We used a validated coronary heart disease (CHD) prevention computer model to estimate the costs and benefits of lifelong lipid modification. The patients were middle-aged men and women who were free of CHD, with either primary type IIa or IIb hyperlipidemia. The intervention used were specific HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and fibrates at several dosages, which reduced total cholesterol 11-34% and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 1-29%. The main outcome measure was the cost per year of life saved after discounting benefits and costs by 5% annually. The lifetime cost effectiveness of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin) and fibrates (bezafibrate, fenofibrate, gemfibrozil) for the treatment of primary hyperlipidemia varied according to patient population, the effectiveness of each drug in modifying lipid levels, and the price of each drug. The estimates of cost per year of life saved for HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors range from $19,886 to $73,632, and $16,955 to $59,488 for fibrates according to gender and type of primary hyperlipidemia. Fluvastatin 20 mg/day was significantly more cost effective than gemfibrozil 1200 mg/day for male patients with type IIa hyperlipidemia. Simvastatin 17.3 mg/day or 20 mg/day yielded similar cost-effectiveness ratios compared with fibrates among type II hyperlipidemic patients. However, micronized fenofibrate was more cost effective than simvastatin 20 mg/day among type IIb patients. The cost effectiveness of lipid therapy varies widely and can be maximized by selecting specific drugs for specific lipid abnormalities.", 
    "37": "To evaluate the efficacy of pravastatin in treatment of hypercholesterolemia in non-insulin-dependent diabetes patients, a 6-month trial of once daily 10 mg-pravastatin was studied in 30 patients with fairly, well controlled non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. For 27 patients who completed the study, serum total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly lower 16.7 +/- 2.3 and 20.2 +/- 3.3% from 286.7 +/- 5.9 and 198.6 +/- 7.2 mg/dl at before to 232.6 +/- 7.9 and 147.8 +/- 6.4 mg/dl at 4th week and 237.8 +/- 6.4 and 155.0 +/- 5.8 mg/dl at 24th week after treatment with pravastatin, respectively (P < 0.00001). Serum triglyceride level was decreased from 194.7 +/- 16.8 mg/dl to 175.0 +/- 16.8 mg/dl at 4th week and 176.6 +/- 14.1 mg/dl at 24th week and serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level was slightly increased from 45.4 +/- 2.8 mg/dl to 48.2 +/- 2.5 mg/dl at 4th week and 47.5 +/- 2.6 mg/dl at 24th week of pravastatin treatment, respectively (P > 0.05). There was no serious adverse effect except acute hepatitis in one patient who recovered spontaneously after drug withdrawal. Once daily 10 mg-pravastatin in effective in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.",

We assessed the efficacy and safety of the newer synthetic HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, fluvastatin, in 12 renal transplant patients who remained hypercholesterolemic, despite having been on the American Heart Association (AHA) Step I diet for 6 weeks. At 8 weeks, compared to the control phase, fluvastatin therapy, 20 mg/day, reduced the total cholesterol (TC) from 321 +/- 57 [+/-SD] to 301 +/- 123 mg/dl (p = 0.3); low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), from 209 +/- 56 to 176 +/- 81 mg/dl (p = 0.2); and the triglyceride (TG) levels from 343 +/- 119 to 277 +/- 117 mg/dl (p = 0.06); all these changes were statistically insignificant. However, the therapy significantly increased the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) from 37 +/- 11 to 46 +/- 13 mg/dl (p = 0.006). During this short-term treatment period no adverse biochemical effects were noted with the therapy.", 
    "39": "The purpose of the study was to investigate changes in serum ubiquinol/ubiquinone ratio with copper ion induced oxidative stress, and to assess the ubiquinol/ubiquinone ratio as marker of in vivo oxidative stress in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Plasma ubiquinol, ubiquinone, vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) and total cholesterol (TC) concentrations were measured in 40 patients with angiographically confirmed coronary artery disease and 100 apparently healthy controls. The mean (SD) ubiquinol/ubiquinone ratio of 26.5 (7.5) of the CAD patients was significantly lower than the mean ratio of 30.2 (8.8) of the controls (p = 0.02). Our results indicate that the ubiquinol/ubiquinone ratio is a sensitive marker of oxidative stress and that an altered ubiquinol/ubiquinone ratio is the first sign of lipoprotein exposure to oxidative stress. The altered ratio in CAD patients cannot be explained by differences in plasma vitamin E levels. The vitamin E concentrations were in fact significantly higher in CAD patients, and did not appear to protect the ubiquinol from increased oxidation due to free radical reactions. These results may indicate that circulating lipoproteins of CAD patients are more exposed to, or are more susceptible to, free radical reactions compared with apparently healthy controls.", 
    "40": "Mevinolinic acid (MVA), the major active metabolite of Lovastatin in human blood, is analysed by microbore high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray tandem mass spectrometry. Quantification is carried out by using methylmevinolinic acid (MMVA) as internal standard. Positive- and negative-ion mass spectra of these compounds are shown. Because of the higher sensitivity obtainable, the negative-ion mode is selected for the analysis. Solid-phase extraction cartridges are used off-line to prepurify and concentrate the sample and a microbore (1 x 100 mm) reversed-phase column is used for chromatography. Tandem mass spectrometry is carried out in the precursor-ion mode using a selected-reaction monitoring procedure. The [M-H]- precursor ions for MVA and MMVA are selected in the first quadrupole analyser and the second analyser is focused on the common product ion at m/z 319. Detection and quantification limits are ca. 50 pg/mL and ca. 200 pg/mL respectively. An example of the application of the method to the routine analysis of samples from a bioequivalence study is also shown.",

The semipeptoids were screened for their in vitro inhibition potency towards farnesyl transferase and geranylgeranyl transferase. Structure-activity relationship studies led to a potent and selective inhibitor, HR-11, which blocks Ras farnesylation in vitro with an IC50 of 1.2 nM. The cell permeable methyl ester derivative of HR-11, HR-12, inhibits Ras farnesylation in intact cells with an IC50 of 10 microM and with no detectable inhibition of Rap1A/K-rev geranyl-geranylation.", 
    "42": "Treatment of rats with 10 mg.kg body wt-1 day-1 4-aminopyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (APP) for 2 days markedly reduced serum cholesterol and phospholipids. This was associated with large decreases in the principal component of alveolar surfactant, the disaturated phospholipids (DSP), in the lamellar body and in the tubular myelin-rich and -poor alveolar fractions, but with no concomitant change in cholesterol or surfactant protein A. These decreases in DSP were associated with a decrease in the synthesis of surfactant phospholipids. Despite these large changes in composition of alveolar surfactant, we could detect no change in either static or dynamic lung compliance. However, the treatment markedly increased both the minimum and maximum surface tension of the lipid extract of the tubular myelin-rich fraction, as measured by bubble surfactometry. Whereas these changes appeared unimportant in the isolated perfused lung at resting tidal volume, they were associated with edema after an increase in tidal volume. The ability of APP to inhibit phospholipid synthesis selectively makes it a useful tool in investigating the surfactant system.", 
    "43": "Endothelial dysfunction is emerging as an important factor in the early development of acute and chronic renal disease. Drugs aimed specifically at rectifying this aberration are being developed, although other established agents such as calcium antagonists, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and HMG CoA reductase inhibitors also have beneficial effects in this setting. Calcium antagonists are particularly effective at ameliorating acute renal ischaemia associated with endothelial dysfunction. Combination therapy with a calcium antagonist and an ACE inhibitor might optimise the beneficial effects of calcium channel blockade on the sequelae of endothelial dysfunction in chronic renal failure.", 
    "44": "Plasma cholesteryl ester transfer activity is increased in patients with chronic renal failure on dialysis who have elevated levels of apolipoprotein B (apoB)-containing lipoproteins. Simvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitor, reduces levels of these lipoproteins but the effect of treatment on cholesteryl ester transfer activity in patients on dialysis remains to be determined.", 
    "45": "We measured serum newly synthesized cholesteryl ester transfer (NCET) activity, lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) activity and serum lipid, lipoprotein and apolipoprotein concentrations before and immediately after 6 months treatment with simvastatin (10 mg daily, n = 24) or placebo (n = 29) in 53 patients with chronic renal failure receiving haemodialysis or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD).", 
    "46": "Simvastatin therapy significantly reduced serum cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, apoB concentrations, and both NCET (P = 0.001) and LCAT (P = 0.012) rates. The decrease in NCET activity was correlated significantly with the corresponding decrease in apoB concentration (r = 0.715, P < 0.001) and LCAT activity (r = 0.715, P < 0.001) during simvastatin therapy and was no longer significant when apoB concentration (P = 0.14) or LCAT activity (P = 0.07) were controlled.", 
    "47": "These data show that simvastatin therapy reduces serum NCET rates, and suggest that this may be linked to the concomitant decrease in levels of apoB-containing lipoproteins which are acceptors of transferred cholesteryl esters, and to the decrease in serum LCAT rates in patients with chronic renal failure with treatment.", 
    "48": "In order to monitor the effects of drugs on interleukin-8 (IL-8) production by cells, a microtiter plate assay that determines four parameters simultaneously was established (i) levels of secreted IL-8 (supernatant ELISA), (ii) levels of intracellular IL-8 (cell ELISA), (iii) intracellular localization (fluorescence microscopy), and (iv) the amount of cellular protein (colorimetric assay). The quantitative and qualitative determination of intracellular IL-8 was achieved by immunofluorescence using the ELF-detection system (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), which is approximately 10 times more sensitive than conventional immunofluorescence detection systems. Thus, a 32x objective magnification (without immersion oil) is sufficient to precisely assess the subcellular localization of IL-8. Experiments were carried out with human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Drugs interfering with transcription or translation and inhibitors of protein kinase C inhibited both production and secretion of IL-8. Brefeldin A (BFA), colchicine, and the HMGCoA-reductase inhibitor fluvastatin disrupted the characteristic Golgi localization of IL-8, but only BFA inhibited its secretion. This assay can therefore be used to distinguish drugs that inhibit both IL-8 synthesis and secretion from those that inhibit IL-8 secretion only. It can easily be adapted to other cellular proteins for which a sensitive detection method is required.", 
    "49": "This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study shows that 20-week fluvastatin treatment induces beneficial changes in the lipid panel and a shift in the fibrinolytic pathway toward activation through a decrease in tissue plasminogen activator antigen. Fluvastatin treatment causes no variation in lipoprotein(a) circulating levels.", 
    "50": "The hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor simvastatin is the most effective of the currently approved hypolipidemic drugs and has been shown to reduce mortality and coronary morbidity in patients with coronary artery disease. For these patients the United States National Cholesterol Education Program advocates reducing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol to <100 mg/dl. However, in some patients this cannot be achieved using monotherapy with simvastatin 40 mg/day, the current maximal recommended dose. To evaluate the effectiveness of extending the dosage range, 156 subjects with LDL cholesterol >160 mg/dl and triglycerides (TG) <350 mg/dl were randomized to simvastatin at doses of 40, 80, and 160 mg/day in a 26 week, double-blind, 3-period, complete block crossover study. Each active treatment period was 6 weeks in duration with intervening 2 week washout periods. Median reductions from baseline in LDL cholesterol were 41%, 47%, and 53% in the 40-, 80-, and 160-mg groups, respectively. The corresponding reductions in plasma TG were 21%, 23%, and 33%. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol increased by 6% to 8% in each group. One patient (0.7%) taking 160 mg developed myopathy; 1 patient (0.7%) taking 80 mg, and 3 (2.1%) taking 160 mg had transaminase elevations > 3 times the upper limit of normal. No new or unexpected adverse effects were observed. We conclude that simvastatin at doses of 80 and 160 mg/day provides additional efficacy with a low short-term incidence of adverse effects; our results support the continued investigation of simvastatin at these doses.", 
    "51": "The enhanced effect of urethane anesthesia on the serum creatine kinase (CPK) level following administration of hypolipidemic agents was examined to develop a convenient experimental screening method for drug-induced myopathy. After oral administration of a hypolipidemic agent to rats, 25% urethane solution was infused intravenously at a very low rate using a microinfusion pump. Blood samples were collected 7 h after drug administration and the risk of myopathy was evaluated based on the CPK level. When bezafibrate (BF), simvastatin (SV), or pravastatin (PV) (50-500 mg/kg) was orally administered under urethane infusion, enhanced elevation of the serum CPK level was observed dose dependently for BF and SV, but not for PV. The elevation of serum CPK was much higher with BF than with SV or PV. In addition, when SV or PV (50-500 mg/kg) was coadministered with 50 mg/kg of BF, there was a striking increase in the serum CPK level as compared with the drug alone. Without urethane infusion, no significant elevation in serum CPK level was observed even at a high dose of these hypolipidemic agents. These phenomena suggest that the urethane anesthesia enhanced the elevation of the serum CPK level following administration of hypolipidemic agents. We propose that this method is a simple and speedy screening test for drug-induced myopathy.", 
    "52": "Familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL) is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by multiple lipoprotein phenotypes, a high risk for coronary heart disease, and predominance among the LDL fraction of smaller and denser particles. We report on an FCHL kindred (the M-kindred) in which decreased VLDL- and LDL-apoB elimination rates rather than enhanced production rates were the main kinetic abnormalities. Lipoprotein levels and metabolic parameters of all apoB-containing lipoproteins (including light and dense LDLs) were determined during placebo and pravastatin treatment periods. ApoB metabolism was studied by endogenous labeling with stable isotopes and a multicompartmental model. Five members of the M-kindred participated. The study was doubly blinded, randomized, and placebo controlled. Treatment periods of 6 weeks were separated by 2-week washout periods. All subjects had high apoB levels, 2 had a mixed lipemia, 1 had hypercholesterolemia, and 2 had hypertriglyceridemia. Familial dysbetalipoproteinemia, hypercholesterolemia, and defective apoB-100 were excluded by genetic, testing. Kinetic parameters were remarkably similar in the five study subjects during the placebo period, despite their diverse plasma lipid profiles. Compared with nine normolipidemic control subjects, low VLDL-apoB fractional catabolic rates (FCRs) (3.6 +/- .1 versus 9.3 +/- 2.9 pools per day) and low LDL-apoB FCRs (0.19 +/- 0.05 versus 0.41 +/- 0.13 pool per day) were observed in every case. The majority of the LDL particles were identified in the denser fraction (d = 1.036 to 1.063 g/mL). A clear precursor-product relationship was observed from VLDL to IDL to light LDL to dense LDL, ie, there was no \"metabolic channeling.\" Light LDL had significantly higher FCR than dense LDL (0.82 +/- 0.21 versus 0.22 +/- 0.08 pool per day). VLDL-apoB production rates were normal (19.7 +/- 6.0 versus 21.6 +/- 6.1 mg/kg per day for control subjects). In contrast, in two subjects drawn from two other FCHL kindreds (the C- and K-kindreds), VLDL-apoB production rates were increased (35.6 and 32.1 mg/kg per day, respectively). In these two, more \"typical\" FCHL subjects, FCRs of LDL-apoB were near normal (0.351 and 0.311 pool per day, respectively). Pravastatin (20 mg/d) resulted in significantly lower plasma cholesterol (265 +/- 30 to 218 +/- 16 mg/dL, P < .01), LDL cholesterol (186 +/- 31 to 145 +/- 15 mg/dL, P < .03), and apoB levels (168 +/- 14 to 125 +/- 16 mg/dL, P < .01) in the five FCHL subjects of the M-kindred. No changes were observed in plasma HDL cholesterol, apoA-I, or lipoprotein(a). Pravastatin significantly increased the LDL-apoB FCR (from 0.19 +/- 0.05 to 0.34 +/- 0.04 pool per day). The FCRs of both LDL subclasses increased with treatment. No pravastatin-induced changes were seen in apoB production rates.", 
    "53": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) is the first specific enzyme of the isoprenoid pathway, which leads to several classes of primary and secondary metabolites such as sterols, quinones, carotenoids and gibberellins. The structural gene of HMG-CoA reductase was isolated from the ascomycetous fungus Gibberella fujikuroi. Additionally, the most conserved region of this gene was also isolated from another plant pathogenic fungus, Sphaceloma manihoticola. Both ascomycetous fungi use the plant hormone gibberellin to induce an elongation of infected host plants, and in the case of S. manihoticola of plant tumors. Sequence analysis revealed a high degree of similarity between the deduced amino-acid sequences in the C-terminal catalytic domains of all known HMG-CoA reductases, but the highest degree was found between the sequences of both analysed ascomycetes. In contrast to Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Ustilago maydis and plants, G. fujikuroi and S. manihoticola possess only a single copy of this gene, although the product of HMGR (mevalonate) is the precursor for essential sterol and quinone biosynthesis and secondary metabolites such as gibberellins. RNA-blot and hybridization experiments showed that gene expression is not influenced by either glucose or ammonium excess.",

    "62": "The high prevalence of cholesterol gallstone disease in hypertriglyceridemic patients may be associated with frequent metabolic defects in cholesterol and bile acid syntheses and in the concomitant formation of bile supersaturated with cholesterol. This study had the two aims: 1) to assess whether the defects as well as the degree of biliary cholesterol supersaturation in patients with hyperlipoproteinemia (HLP) can be estimated by the simultaneous determination of plasma mevalonate (MVL) and 7alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4); and 2) to assess the possible application of an estimated cholesterol saturation index ([CSI]E) as a means of evaluating the clinical effects of simvastatin on biliary lipid composition. Biliary cholesterol supersaturation was observed in patients with both IIa and IV HLP types. Consistent with the high activity and steady-state messenger RNA level of 3-hydroxy-3 methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, plasma MVL was significantly higher in 86 patients with HLP (38 type IIa, 44.1 +/- 2.4 nmol/L and 48 type IV, 56.7 +/- 2.3; P < .01) than in 41 normolipidemic subjects (34.2 +/- 1.5), closely correlating with the molar percentage of cholesterol in bile (r = .61, P = .0001; n = 86). On the other hand, consistent with the high activity and messenger RNA level of cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase, plasma C4 was significantly higher in patients with HLP (type IIa, 28.8 +/- 2.3 nmol/L and type IV, 38.3 +/- 2.7; P < .01) than in normolipidemic subjects (17.4 +/- 1.5). Plasma C4 was closely correlated with plasma MVL (r = .40, P = .0001; n = 86), but was inversely correlated with the molar percentage of bile acids in bile (r = .49, P = .0001; n = 86). Assuming that cholesterol supersaturation in patients with HLP may be governed by both an enhanced cholesterol secretion (closely reflected by plasma MVL) and a decreased secretion of bile acids (closely reflected by plasma C4), the multivariate linear regression-analyses revealed that an index defined as estimated CSI ([CSI]E) (%) in patients with HLP was given by the following equation using plasma MVL and C4 (nmol/L): [CSI]E = 1[MVL] + 0.7[C4] + 44.4. Biliary cholesterol supersaturation in patients treated with simvastatin improved in a manner parallel to the time course of decreases in plasma MVL and C4. The [CSI]E before and at the end of treatment were correlated with biliary CSI. These results indicate that defects of hepatic cholesterogenesis, and bile acid synthesis, and the degree of biliary cholesterol supersaturation in patients with HLP can be estimated exactly by the simultaneous determination of plasma MVL and C4; furthermore [CSI]E may be adopted for clinical use as a convenient index of biliary CSI.", 
    "63": "Tumor resistance to oxidative stress prevents the efficacy of cancer therapy based upon a free radical-mediated mechanism. K-ras transformed NIH 3T3 cells (E32-4-2) showed, under oxidative stress, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels 10-fold lower and lipid peroxide levels 56% lower, compared to their nontransformed counterpart. Since p21(ras) activity depends upon farnesylation, we tested the effect of the inhibitors of farnesylation lovastatin and (alpha-hydroxyfarnesyl) phosphonic acid on susceptibility to oxidative stress in these cells. Preincubation of cells for 24 h with 10 microM lovastatin resulted in a 10-fold increase of ROS levels and a 50% increase of lipid peroxide levels measured under pro-oxidant conditions. Similarly, preincubation of cells with 100 microM (alpha-hydroxyfarnesyl) phosphonic acid for 24 h enhanced stress-induced levels of either ROS (7.5-fold) or lipid peroxides (33%). The effect of lovastatin and (alpha-hydroxyfarnesyl) phosphonic acid is specifically due to their ability to inhibit p21(ras) activity. In fact, inhibition of p21(ras) by transfecting E32-4-2 cells with the transdominant negative mutant of H-ras (L61, S186) led, analogously to lovastatin or (alpha-hydroxyfarnesyl) phosphonic acid treatment, to a strong increase of stress-induced ROS levels. These results suggest that farnesylation inhibitors could be used as an adjuvant therapy to improve the tumoricidal effect of cancer treatment based upon free-radical production in ras-dependent tumors.",

High density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol remained unchanged in the captopril group declined slightly in the atenolol group. Total cholesterol increased moderately in both groups. Triglycerides increased somewhat in the captopril group and significantly more in the atenolol group. These results were maintained during the open trial. Most of the undesirable effects were benign and did not require treatment.",

    "68": "Lovastatin, a cholesterol-lowering drug, has antiproliferative properties that may be related to its inhibition of protein isoprenylation. We examined the effects of lovastatin on signal transduction via the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR). Lovastatin inhibited both proximal and distal TCR-mediated signaling events in a time- and concentration-dependent manner in the human Jurkat T-cell line. Upregulation of CD69 surface expression after TCR stimulation was blocked by lovastatin, although no inhibition of phorbol ester-induced CD69 expression was noted. Proximal TCR-mediated signaling events, including intracellular calcium mobilization, inositol phosphate production, and tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase Cgamma1, were similarly inhibited by lovastatin, although global protein tyrosine kinase activity remained intact. In a Jurkat variant transfected with the human type-1 muscarinic receptor, lovastatin also inhibited TCR-mediated calcium mobilization and inositol phosphate production but failed to affect muscarinic receptor-induced responses. Lovastatin, at similar doses, also disrupted post-translational processing of ras and inhibited ras-dependent signals, including phosphorylation and activation of mitogen-associated protein kinase after TCR stimulation. These findings suggest that the antiproliferative properties of lovastatin may be independent of ras and could result from uncoupling protein tyrosine kinases from distinct signal transduction pathways.", 
    "69": "Occlusive atherosclerosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in renal transplant recipients. Hyperlipidemia associated with the transplanted state may be at least partially responsible for this complication and is therefore an important target of therapy. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors are powerful cholesterol-lowering drugs, but their broad use in transplant recipients has been hindered by concerns about interactions with cyclosporine. Cyclosporine interferes with the elimination of these agents, increasing their plasma and tissue levels and predisposing the patient to rhabdomyolysis. Fluvastatin, the first entirely synthetic HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, possesses a distinct pharmacologic profile, including a shorter half-life and virtually no active circulating metabolites. Therefore, it may interact differently with cyclosporine. The pharmacokinetics and safety of fluvastatin, 20 mg/day, were evaluated in 20 hypercholesterolemic renal transplant recipients also receiving cyclosporine, usually in combination with azathioprine and methylprednisolone, during the 14-week study. Fluvastatin area under the curve, maximum plasma concentration, and time to maximum plasma concentration were minimally increased in these patients, unlike findings reported for lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin. This suggests that metabolism of fluvastatin may be less affected by cyclosporine than that of other reductase inhibitors. Fluvastatin was well tolerated, with no evidence of myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, or ophthalmologic abnormalities. These findings and the significant reductions in total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and the ratio of low-density to high-density lipoproteins achieved in these patients support the broader use of fluvastatin to treat hypercholesterolemia in renal transplant recipients.",

    "71": "Fifty-seven patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) with mean age of 48 years (range 30 to 69), participated in a follow-up examination 5.5 years after the completion of a 1-year trial with lovastatin, cholestyramine, probucol, or omega-3 fatty acids. The goals were to record quality of life, compliance to treatment, adverse effects, and clinical outcome. The quality of life was similar to that in a Norwegian reference population. The factors causing most distress to patients were keeping a diet low in saturated fats, taking medication, and fear of death. The medication was mostly prescribed in maximum dosages. At follow-up, the reduction in total cholesterol was 36% (p < 0.05), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol 38% (p < 0.05), triglycerides 20% (p < 0.05) compared with being on diet therapy only. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol increased 8% (p < 0.05). Intake of saturated and monounsaturated fat increased 1.5% and 1.7% (p < 0.05), respectively; polyunsaturated fat was unchanged. Three patients experienced myocardial infarction, of whom 2 died and 1 developed angina pectoris. Before the start of lovastatin treatment, 27 coronary events occurred per 1,000 patient-years in this group compared with 12 events per 1,000 patient-years thereafter. Of 28 patients reporting adverse events, 4 discontinued lovastatin and 3 discontinued cholestyramine. Several practical and psychological difficulties were associated with FH. Long-term intensive lipid-lowering therapy was possible in FH outpatients without loss of effect and with good compliance to therapy. Intensive therapy, today is, however, not sufficient for many FH patients to reach a therapeutic goal of LDL cholesterol < 4.0 mmol/L. More potent lipid-lowering agents are needed.",

The few dose-response studies of niacin that have been done suggest that most of niacin's high-density lipoprotein cholesterol-increasing effect can also be achieved with relatively low doses, but higher doses are needed to substantially reduce LDL cholesterol levels.

    "87": "The effects of 2 months treatment with simvastatin (40 mg, 20 mg p.o. daily) or placebo on erythrocyte membrane cholesterol content and acyl chain composition have been studied in 36 patients with a clinical history of atherosclerosis enrolled in the Oxford Cholesterol Study. All patients received advice corresponding to a standard phase 1 cholesterol-lowering diet. As expected the mean serum total cholesterol fell substantially (-26.5%, 20 mg simvastatin, P < 0.05; -32.7%, 40 mg simvastatin, P < 0.05) compared to placebo (-6.3%, ns). However, mean erythrocyte cholesterol content did not change significantly in any group (2 months therapy: 20 mg simvastatin, -0.62%; 40 mg simvastatin, +2.2%; placebo, -4.2%). Erythrocyte cholesterol was also unaltered after 5 months of therapy. Erythrocyte osmotic fragility was unchanged in the treatment and placebo groups. In the placebo group dietary advice alone was associated with a significant increase in the linoleic acid content of erythrocytes from 9.4 mole% of total acyl chains to 11.8 mole% (P < 0.05). Treatment with simvastatin was associated with an increase in the arachidonic acid content of the erythrocyte membrane from 12.2 to 15.3 mole% (P < 0.05). Treatment with simvastatin does not alter erythrocyte cholesterol content, but does alter acyl chain distribution. These results suggest that the chemical potential of cholesterol in serum is not markedly altered by HMG-CoA reductase inhibition.", 
    "88": "The Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S) has confirmed the link between the cholesterol-reducing effects of simvastatin and improved survival in patients with hypercholesterolaemia and pre-existing coronary heart disease (CHD). Pharmacoeconomic analyses of the 4S trial, using prospectively collected data for cost-generating events, demonstrate that the cost per year of life saved for simvastatin in such patients falls within the range considered cost effective. Reductions in resource utilisation costs (numbers of hospitalisations and revascularisation procedures) largely offset the acquisition cost of long term simvastatin treatment in the US. Models of primary prevention incorporating epidemiological data to predict CHD events generally suffer from deficiencies in the methods and assumptions used, and no firm conclusions can be made at present regarding relative cost effectiveness of the drugs studied, including simvastatin. It is generally agreed that cost effectiveness will improve in patients with higher absolute risk of CHD. In summary, simvastatin has been shown in a major clinical trial and its companion economic analyses to reduce mortality and to be cost effective in patients with hypercholesterolaemia and existing CHD. As is the case for others of its class, its cost-effectiveness ratio in primary prevention remains to be ascertained. This issue aside, simvastatin is a rational choice of cholesterol-lowering agent in secondary prevention whose use can be justified on an economic basis.", 
    "89": "Simvastatin, a potent 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor. inhibited cell division in a dose dependent fashion and induced neurite-like outgrowth in PC12 cells. The neurite-like outgrowth was detectable at 0.5 microg/ml of simvastatin 24 h after the treatment. The responses to simvastatin were completely prevented by incubating the cells with mevalonate. In contrast to simvastatin, pravastatin, a similar HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor but lipophobic, had no effect on the cells. The results provide new possibilities for the central nervous system (CNS) side effects of simvastatin therapy.", 
    "90": "The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, lovastatin (LOV), has been reported to inhibit Ras farnesylation and the growth of Ras-transformed cells. Mouse lung tumors and human lung adenocarcinomas often have activating mutations in K-ras alleles. In the present study, we determined whether LOV inhibited the growth in vitro of mouse (C10, E9, LM1, LM2, and 82-132) and human (NCl-H125, H292, H441, H460, and H661) nor-transformed and neoplastically transformed lung epithelial cells and whether growth inhibition was related to cell transformation or K-ras activation. LOV inhibited the growth of mouse and human lung cells, but cell sensitivities were unrelated to neoplastic transformation or K-ras mutation. In addition, we evaluated whether LOV could inhibit the formation of lung adenomas induced by the tobacco-specific nitrosamine, 4-(N-methyl-N-nitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) in mice. LOV was administered in the diet at 0, 40, 160, or 400 ppm ad libitum to male strain A/J mice beginning 1 week after lung tumor induction with NNK (10 mumol/mouse). Mice were euthanized 6 months later. Enumeration of lung tumors revealed that LOV did not affect tumor incidence or size, but significantly reduced tumor multiplicity in a dose-related manner. These data suggest that LOV can suppress the formation of NNK-induced lung tumors, possibly at an early promotional stage. This suppression does not appear to be related to either the presence of mutated K-ras or to changes in K-ras expression.",

    "93": "In the future, even more effective drugs will become available that may yield even greater benefit than has been observed in trials until now. At present, this therapy is too expensive for use in mass strategy to prevent coronary heart disease. Therefore, it should be limited to patients with a high risk. When further development brings newer drugs with a lower cost, drug treatment for cholesterol-lowering may become as widespread as antihypertensive treatment is today in order to prevent cardiovascular disease.", 
    "94": "The successful use of statins in major coronary prevention trials has resulted in an explosive widening of their use. In most instances, statin therapy will result in adequate and sustained lowering of lipids. Comparing equal-weight doses, simvastatin is twice as effective as pravastatin and lovastatin in LDL-cholesterol lowering, and all three are more effective than fluvastatin according to recent comparative studies. Statin monotherapy is not always effective in severe hypercholesterolemia or in mixed (combined) hyperlipidemia with marked triglyceride elevations. All statins accepted for therapeutic use can be combined with resin or fibrate. Myopathy resulting from statin-fibrate combinations is less frequent than had been thought on the basis of early reports, and these combinations can be used in long-term therapy of mixed hyperlipidemia.", 
    "95": "The effectiveness of cholesterol lowering is well established, but cost-effectiveness is an increasing issue because of financial pressures on healthcare services. New statin studies have prospectively demonstrated that secondary prevention of coronary heart disease is almost always cost-effective, as is primary prevention in individuals at higher risk who have one or more other additional risk factors.", 
    "96": "Coronary artery disease is a major limiting factor for long-term survival after heart transplantation. Hyperlipidemia is a probable risk factor for coronary artery disease in this kind of patient.

    "98": "Both drugs were effective in lowering total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol and apoprotein B concentrations, but the effect of lovastatin was significantly greater. Only bezafibrate produced a significant reduction in total triglycerides and a significant rise in high density lipoprotein cholesterol and apoprotein AI.

    "100": "The use of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (e.g. pravastatin) has gradually increased in the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia. By inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase (the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis) activity, cholesterol synthesis in the liver is reduced and the plasma level of cholesterol, especially low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, is substantially lowered. Simultaneously, inhibition of HMG CoA reductase activity is associated with increased synthesis and accumulation of larger amounts of HMG CoA reductase enzyme protein. The main purpose of this study was to determine if the cessation of pravastatin treatment causes a rapid increase in the synthesis and biliary secretion of cholesterol, a condition which might lead to a temporarily increased cholesterol saturation of bile. Nine patients undergoing surgery for stones in the common bile duct were fitted with T-tubes in the common bile duct peroperatively; the side arm of the T-tube was left open postoperatively, creating a biliary fistula. All patients were given 6 days' treatment with pravastatin (20 mg b.i.d.) following the operation. Bile was collected from the T-tube, in 12-h fractions during this period and for another 3 days after termination of the treatment. Plasma levels of lipoproteins and lathosterol--reflecting cholesterol synthesis--were determined on several occasions. After cessation of pravastatin treatment, the plasma levels of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol increased by 21% and 33% respectively. High-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol did not change. The plasma level of lathosterol was increased two- to fourfold. Outputs of bile acids and phospholipids were significantly increased (23% and 10% respectively) after termination of treatment, whereas the output of cholesterol was not significantly changed. Cholesterol saturation was reduced by 20%, from 175 +/- 37% to 140 +/- 19%, but this change was not significant. The results indicate that, with the present experimental model (biliary diversion), the synthesis and biliary secretion of bile acids seem to be largely dependent on the de novo synthesis of cholesterol in the liver, whereas the biliary output of cholesterol is not.", 
    "101": "The occurrence of rhabdomyolysis is one of the rare side-effects of the cholesterol-lowering agent simvastatin. During the use of lovastatin, an agent related to simvastatin, the risk of this side-effect might be increased when cyclosporin or gemfibrozil are used concomitantly. It is possible that this also applies for simvastatin. We present two patients who developed rhabdomyolysis during the concomitant use of simvastatin and gemfibrozil.", 
    "102": "Anti-tumor effects of agents known to intervene with signal transduction pathways (ras and protein kinase c cascades) were examined in the B16 melanoma cell model. The compounds examined included: lovastatin, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, which interferes with membrane localization of p21 ras protein; H-7, a classic inhibitor of protein kinase C; and tiazofurin, a GTP depleting agent, that might affect the GTP/GDP ratio on p21ras. The three agents were found to inhibit the proliferation of B16 melanoma cells. Only tiazofurin, as expected, induced a significant decrease in GTP levels. Lovastatin and H-7 altered p21 subcellular localization. They reduced membrane expression of p21 ras, while increasing its expression in the cytosol. Following tiazofurin treatment a trend towards increased membranal p21 was observed. These results suggest that p21 is a target for the action of signal transduction inhibitors. However, the relationship between growth inhibition and altered p21 expression is not yet clear.", 
    "103": "Pregnant Wistar-MS strain rats were irradiated with 2.6 Gy of gamma-rays at day 20 of pregnancy. Rats in the control group (n = 48) were then implanted with a diethylstilbestrol (DES) pellet at 35 days after weaning, while being fed a control (MB-1) diet. The incidence of mammary tumors was 89.6% within 1 year. In the experimental group (n = 22), a bezafibrate (0.15%) diet was initiated immediately after weaning, and 35 days after weaning a DES pellet was implanted. Administration of dietary bezafibrate together with DES-implantation continued for a period of 1 year, at which time the experiment was terminated. The incidence (27.3%) of the mammary tumors in the bezafibrate-fed rats was less than one-third of that in the control rats. Compared with the control group, the number of mammary tumors per tumor-bearing rat in the bezafibrate-treated group was reduced. For clarification of the mechanism of the chemopreventive effects of bezafibrate, lipid and hormone concentrations in serum were measured. Bezafibrate-fed rats showed a significant decrease in serum prolactin (56%) and triglyceride (63%) concentrations, and a significant increase in serum estradiol-17beta (3.8-fold), cholesterol ester (2.0-fold) and TSH (2.0-fold) concentrations in comparison with the control rats. The bezafibrate diet inhibited the formation of DES-induced pituitary tumors. However, the development of mammary glands in the bezafibrate-fed rats was stimulated more than that in the control rats treated with DES alone. The present results demonstrate that bezafibrate is effective in preventing mammary tumors induced by radiation together with DES, possibly by reducing prolactin and triglyceride concentrations.",

Patients (mean age 55 years, 53% male) were assigned to pravastatin (40 mg/day, n = 151) or placebo (n not equal to 154). Ultrasound imaging was used to quantify IMT at baseline, and semiannually thereafter for up to 3 years.

This finding extends the beneficial effects of cholesterol lowering to the primary prevention of atherosclerosis in a population with relatively low cardiovascular event rates, and suggests that this benefit is mediated by specific morphological effects on early stages of plaque development.", 
    "108": "Studies were conducted to determine the importance of de novo cholesterol synthesis and cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme in the action of IGF-I in bovine granulosa and thecal cells. Granulosa and thecal cells from bovine follicles were cultured for 2 days in 10% fetal calf serum and then treated with luteinizing hormone (100 ng/ml) and IGF-I (0 or 100 ng/ml) for an additional 2 days in serum-free medium. During the last 24 h of treatment, cells were concomitantly treated with simvastatin (0, 0.5 or 5 micrograms/ml) or 25-hydroxycholesterol (0 or 10 micrograms/ml). Simvastatin, a potent inhibitor of the key enzyme controlling de novo cholesterol synthesis, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, completely inhibited (P < 0.05) progesterone production by granulosa cells and progesterone and androstenedione production by thecal cells. Simvastatin also inhibited (P < 0.05) granulosa cell and thecal cell proliferation. Concomitant treatment with mevalonate, an immediate product of HMG-CoA reductase, attenuated the inhibitory effect of simvastatin on progesterone and androstenedione production by thecal cells and blocked the inhibitory effect of simvastatin on cell proliferation. The addition of 25-hydroxycholesterol, a substrate for cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, had no effect (P > 0.10) on IGF-I-stimulated progesterone or androstenedione production by thecal cells and actually inhibited (P < 0.05) IGF-I-stimulated progesterone production by granulosa cells. These results provide indirect evidence indicating that stimulation of HMG-CoA reductase is an important locus of IGF-I action in bovine granulosa and thecal cells, whereas IGF-I has little or no effect on side-chain cleavage enzyme activity in these same cell types under the culture conditions employed.", 
    "109": "This study examined the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety of atorvastatin, an investigational inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, in 50 healthy subjects by means of a randomized, double-blind parallel-group design. Volunteers received rising single and multiple doses of 0.5 to 80 mg/day atorvastatin (40 subjects) or placebo (10 subjects). The drug was administered once or twice daily for 14 days. Atorvastatin was well tolerated by healthy subjects. The most common adverse events reported after atorvastatin-headache and nausea-occurred as frequently after placebo. Atorvastatin peak concentration and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) values increased more than proportionally with atorvastatin dose after both single and multiple drug doses. The extent of atorvastatin absorption (AUC) was similar after once- or twice-daily drug administration. Steady-state drug concentrations were achieved by the third day of drug dosing. Mean elimination half-life values ranged from 11 to 24 hours. Atorvastatin accumulation was approximately 1.5- and 3.0-fold after once- and twice-daily administration, respectively. Atorvastatin produced dose-related reductions in total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol that were similar after once- and twice-daily drug administration. Reductions in mean total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol values ranged from 13% and 22% (2.5 mg/day) to 45% and 58% (80 mg/day), respectively (p < or = 0.0013 in comparison with placebo and with baseline over this dose range). In summary, atorvastatin doses of up to 80 mg/day were well tolerated and had significant cholesterol-lowering effects.", 
    "110": "Few direct clinical data are available regarding whether cholesterol-lowering therapy should be extended to patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and normal or only slightly elevated plasma cholesterol concentrations. The one published angiographic trial designed to examine this question found no benefit. Additional prospective data will be provided by the Lipoprotein and Coronary Atherosclerosis Study (LCAS), a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of fluvastatin therapy (20 mg twice daily) monitored by both quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) and, in a subset of patients, positron-emission tomography (PET). Eligible subjects in LCAS were men and women 35-75 years of age with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol of 115-190 mg/dL on stable dietary therapy and with angiographic evidence by caliper measurement of at least one coronary atherosclerotic lesion causing 30-75% diameter stenosis. Among the 429 patients randomized (mean age 58.8, 81% male), mean baseline LDL cholesterol was only 145.6 mg/dL. Any patient with mean prerandomization LDL cholesterol of 160 mg/dL or higher also received open-label adjunctive cholestyramine. The primary endpoint is within-patient per-lesion change in minimum lumen diameter (MLD) as measured by QCA at baseline and 2.5-year follow-up. All evaluable lesions had MLD at least 0.8mm less than the reference lumen diameter at either baseline or follow-up and MLD at least 25% of the reference lumen diameter at baseline. Data obtained on myocardial perfusion changes (99 patients underwent initial PET), special lipid particles, and coagulation factors may help define which patients with CHD and relatively low LDL cholesterol will benefit from lipid-lowering treatment.", 
    "111": "Recent large clinical trials have required screened patients to have serial measurements of an entry criteria variable, eliminating patients form further consideration if the average value is not in the eligibility range specified by the trial protocol. The increasing costs of large clinical trials required that they be executed efficiently. One way to improve efficiency would be to reduce the number of required screening measurements for a patient likely to be ineligible. A procedure is proposed that predicts the value of an average based on n measurements serially obtained on a patient during the screening phase when only m < n measurements are available. The employment of this procedure in a large clinical trial that uses low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, total cholesterol, and triglycerides as entry criteria during the screening process is described. As a second example, this procedure is applied to population screening for lipid levels above a treatment threshold. The National Cholesterol Education Program recommends that the average of two LDL cholesterol measurements be used to determine whether LDL cholesterol is above 130 mg/dl, the threshold for treating patients with coronary heart disease. However, data from a sample of patients from a postinfarction population suggest that, if a single LDL cholesterol is above 146 mg/dl, the probability is greater than 95% that the average of the two LDL cholesterol measurements will be above 130 mg/dl."
