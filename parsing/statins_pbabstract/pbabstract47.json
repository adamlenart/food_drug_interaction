The meta-analysis was performed using either a fixed-effects or random-effect model according to I(2) statistic. Effect sizes were expressed as weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). The data from 8 placebo-controlled treatment arms suggested a significant reduction in plasma CoQ10 concentrations following treatment with statins (WMD: -0.44 \u03bcmol/L, 95%CI: -0.52, -0.37, p<0.001). The pooled effect size was robust and remained significant in the leave-one-out sensitivity analysis. Subgroup analysis suggested that the impact of statins on plasma CoQ10 concentrations is significant for all 4 types of statins studied i.e. atorvastatin (WMD: -0.41 \u03bcmol/L, 95%CI: -0.53, -0.29, p<0.001), simvastatin (WMD: -0.47 \u03bcmol/L, 95% CI: -0.61, -0.33, p<0.001), rosuvastatin (WMD: -0.49 \u03bcmol/L, 95%CI: -0.67, -0.31, p<0.001) and pravastatin (WMD: -0.43 \u03bcmol/L, 95%CI: -0.69, -0.16, p=0.001).

This study investigated the effect of atorvastatin on dynamic expressions of MMP9 and TIMP1 in rats after cerebral ischemia reperfusion (I/R). Atorvastatin (5 mgkg(-1)d(-1)) or vehicle was administered orally to rats for 21d before middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) for 2h, with perfusion at 3-, 12-, 24-, 48-, or 96-h thereafter. To evaluate functional outcome, a 5-point behavioral rating scale was performed. Ischemic lesion volume was assessed via triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. mRNA levels of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 were detected by reverse transcription-PCR, and protein levels of MMP-9 and TIMP-1 were measured by immunohistochemical SABC method. At all reperfusion time points, atorvastatin pretreatment was associated with significantly (P<0.05) improved neurological function and reduced brain infarct sizes compared with vehicle treatment, and MMP9 levels were significantly (P<0.05) lower and TIMP1 levels were significantly (P<0.05) higher in both mRNA and protein levels. In conclusion, Oral administration of atorvastatin before stroke may reduce the severity in I/R injury and improve neurological outcome by lowering MMP9 levels and elevating TIMP1 levels.",

Here, we review the current literature on how various effectors of the immune system initiate the cytokine storm and exacerbate pathological damage in hosts. We also review some of the current immunomodulatory strategies for the treatment of cytokine storms in severe influenza, including corticosteroids, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists, sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 agonists, cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, antioxidants, anti-tumour-necrosis factor therapy, intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, statins, arbidol, herbs, and other potential therapeutic strategies.", 
    "18": "The hypolipidemic effect of statins is realized by inhibition of synthesis of local pool of cholesterol spirit in endoplasmic net of hepatocytes. The cholesterol spirit covers all hydrophobic medium of triglycerides with polar mono layer of phosphatidylcholines and cholesterol spirit prior to secretion of lipoproteins of very low density into hydrophilic medium. The lesser mono layer between lipase enzyme and triglycerides substrate contains of cholesterol spirit the higher are the parameters of hydrolysis of palmitic and oleic lipoproteins of very low density. The sequence of effect of statins is as follows: blocking of synthesis in hepatocytes and decreasing of content of unesterified cholesterol spirit in blood plasma; activation of hydrolysis of triglycerides in palmitic and oleic lipoproteins of very low density; formation of ligand lipoproteins of very low density and their absorption by cells by force of apoB-100 endocytosis; decreasing in blood of content of polyenoic fatty acids, equimolar esterified by cholesterol spirit, polyethers of cholesterol spirit and decreasing of level of cholesterol spirit-lipoproteins of very low density. There is no way to eliminate aphysiological effect of disordered biological function of trophology (nutrition) on metabolism of fatty acids in population by means of pharmaceuticals intake. It is necessary to eliminate aphysiological effect of environment. To decrease rate of diseases of cardiovascular system one has to decrease in food content of saturated fatty acids and in the first instance palmitic saturated fatty acid, trans-form fatty acid, palmitoleic fatty acids up to physiological values and increase to the same degree the content of polyenoic fatty acids. The saturated fatty acids block absorption of polyenoic fatty acids by cells. The atherosclerosis is a deficiency of polyenoic fatty acids under surplus of palmitic saturated fatty acid.",

Several strategies based on either lifestyle modifications or pharmacological interventions have been developed in an attempt to reduce the risk of CRC. In this review article, we discuss these interventions including aspirin (and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), vitamin D, exercise, diet, statins, and metformin. Depending upon the risk of developing CRC, the current evidence supports the beneficial role of aspirin, vitamin D, diet, and exercise especially in high-risk individuals (advanced adenoma or CRC). However, even with these established interventions, there are significant knowledge gaps such as doses of aspirin and 25-hydroxy vitamin D are not well established. Similarly, there is no convincing data from randomized controlled trials that a high fiber diet or a low animal fat diet reduces the risk of CRC. Some potential interventions, such as statins and metformin, do not have convincing data for clinical use even in high-risk individuals. However, these may have emerging roles in the prevention and treatment of CRC. Greater understanding of molecular mechanisms and the application of genomic tools to risk stratify an individual and tailor the interventions based on that individual's risk will help further advance the field. Some of this work is already underway and is a focus of this article.",

Cellular and molecular mechanisms of this adverse effect have been elusive, in particular because of the lack of in vitro models suitable for long-term exposures. We have taken advantage of the properties of human pluripotent stem cell-derived mesodermal precursors, that can be maintained unaltered in vitro for a long period of time, to develop a model of repeated exposures to simvastatin during more than 2 weeks. This approach unveiled major differences, both in functional and molecular terms, in response to single versus repeated-dose exposures to simvastatin. The main functional effect of the in vitro simvastatin-induced long-term toxicity was a loss of proliferative capacity in the absence of concomitant cell death, revealing that cytostatic effect could be a major contributor to statin-induced myotoxicity. Comparative analysis of molecular modifications induced by simvastatin short-term versus prolonged exposures demonstrated powerful adaptive cell responses, as illustrated by the dramatic decrease in the number of differentially expressed genes, distinct biological pathway enrichments, and distinct patterns of nutrient transporters expressed at the cell surface.

Deregulation of this pathway is also correlated with diminished protein prenylation, an important post-translational modification necessary to localize certain proteins, such as small GTPases, to membranes. Mevalonate pathway blockade has been linked to mitochondrial dysfunction: especially involving lower mitochondrial membrane potential and increased release of pro-apoptotic factors in cytosol. Furthermore a severe reduction of protein prenylation has also been associated with defective autophagy, possibly causing inflammasome activation and subsequent cell death. So, it is tempting to hypothesize a mechanism in which defective autophagy fails to remove damaged mitochondria, resulting in increased cell death. This mechanism could play a significant role in Mevalonate Kinase Deficiency, an autoinflammatory disease characterized by a defect in Mevalonate Kinase, a key enzyme of the mevalonate pathway. Patients carrying mutations in the MVK gene, encoding this enzyme, show increased inflammation and lower protein prenylation levels.

Sterol biosynthetic pathway in Leishmania is currently being explored for its therapeutic potential. In the present study, we have evaluated the antileishmanial efficacy of mevastatin, a known inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) enzyme. Mevastatin inhibited Leishmania donovani promastigotes and intracellular amastigotes with an 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of 23.8\u2009\u00b1\u20094.2 and 7.5\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1 \u03bcM, respectively, without exhibiting toxicity towards host cell line. Mevastatin also inhibited recombinant L. donovani HMGR (LdHMGR) enzyme activity with an IC50 value of 42.2\u2009\u00b1\u20093.0 \u03bcM. Kinetic analysis revealed that the inhibition of recombinant LdHMGR activity by mevastatin was competitive with HMG-CoA. Mevastatin-treated parasites exhibited 66% reduction in ergosterol levels with respect to untreated parasites. Incubation of mevastatin-treated L. donovani promastigotes with ergosterol resulted in revival of cell growth, whereas cholesterol supplementation failed to cause reversal in cell death. To further prove the specificity of mevastatin for HMGR enzyme, HMGR-overexpressing parasites were used which showed almost threefold resistance to mevastatin. It also induced morphological changes in the parasite accompanied by lipid body accumulation. Hence, antileishmanial effect of mevastatin was due to the inhibition of HMGR, which eventually leads to reduction in ergosterol levels and hence parasite death. The present study may have implications in the treatment of visceral form of leishmaniasis.",

    "62": "Ovarian cancer has a poor prognosis because the disease in the majority of patients is diagnosed at an advanced stage as a result of nonspecific symptoms and lack of efficient screening methods. Because of the poor prognosis of ovarian cancer and the challenge of early detection of the disease, identification of protective factors is important. It has been suggested that some commonly used drugs may have a protective effect against cancer, including ovarian cancer; however, the literature on chemopreventive measures for ovarian cancer is sparse and the results are inconclusive. Most previous studies have substantial methodological constraints, including limited study size and self-reporting of drug use, which introduces potential recall bias and misclassification. This PhD thesis includes a nationwide case-control study to evaluate associations between use of drugs with potential chemopreventive properties and risk of epithelial ovarian cancer. The study is nested in the entire Danish female population using data from the following nationwide registries: the Danish Cancer Registry, the Danish Civil Registration System, the Danish Prescription Registry, the Danish National Patient Register, and registries in Statistics Denmark on fertility, education, and income. Information from the included registries is linked by use of the unique personal identification number assigned to all Danish citizens. The cases were all women in Denmark with epithelial ovarian cancer diagnosed during 2000-2009 (Paper 1) and 2000-2011 (Papers 2 and 3), identified in the Cancer Registry. Age-matched female population controls were randomly selected from the Civil Registration System by risk-set sampling. We required that cases and controls have no history of cancer (except non-melanoma skin cancer) and that controls not previously have undergone bilateral oophorectomy or salpingo-oophorectomy. The total study population comprised 3741 epithelial ovarian cancer cases and 50,576 controls in Paper 1, and 4103 epithelial ovarian cancer cases and 58,706 controls in Papers 2 and 3. We used the Danish Prescription Registry to assess use (\u22652 prescriptions on separate dates) of paracetamol, non-aspirin non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), low-dose aspirin, and statins. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for epithelial ovarian cancer associated with use of the study drugs, with adjustment for potential confounding factors selected a priori. We performed detailed analyses according to duration, intensity, and continuity of study drug use, and the analyses were stratified according to specific histologic types of epithelial ovarian cancer. In all studies, non-use (< 2 prescriptions) of the individual study drugs was defined as the reference group. A striking result of the PhD thesis was a strong inverse association between prescription use of paracetamol and risk of epithelial ovarian cancer. The risk estimates decreased with increasing duration and intensity of paracetamol use, reaching a more than 50% reduction for the longest duration (>10 years) and the highest doses (OR: 0.45; 95% CI: 0.24-0.86). In contrast, we did not observe an inverse association between use of non-aspirin NSAIDs and risk of epithelial ovarian cancer. Moreover, this thesis provides further evidence that use of low-dose aspirin is associated with a reduced risk of epithelial ovarian cancer. In particular, long-term (\u22655 years) continuous use of low-dose aspirin, defined as overlapping prescription coverage periods, was associated with a large reduction in risk (OR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.32-0.97). Finally, we found no apparent association between statin use and epithelial ovarian cancer risk, although the analysis by histologic type suggested an inverse association with the risk of mucinous tumors. The results of this PhD thesis add important knowledge to the area of chemoprevention in relation to epithelial ovarian cancer. As for any observational study, we cannot exclude potential con-founding and exposure misclassification; however, methodological limitations appear unlikely to fully explain the observed reductions in epithelial ovarian cancer risk associated with paracetamol and low-dose aspirin use. Additional research, ideally from clinical trials, is needed before our observations may lead to recommendations for chemopreventive measures against ovarian cancer. In case consensus points to a true protective effect of paracetamol or low-dose aspirin, comprehensive risk-benefit evaluations will also have to be performed. We hope that our results will encourage researchers to look more deeply into the potential chemo-preventive effects of the study drugs against epithelial ovarian cancer risk.",

    "73": "Considerable debate exists regarding who might benefit from statins for primary prevention. Statins have wide pleotropic effects, which contribute to their efficacy in lowering cardiovascular disease but may also result in adverse events (AEs). Caveats in identifying AEs in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) include the lack of a standardized definition of statin-associated AEs, the differences in properties of different statins, the selectivity of RCTs in choosing their participants, the presence of high rate of nonadherence/withdrawal from trials and other concerns related to study design and conflict of interest. Caveats in identifying or overestimating AEs in observational studies include failure to identify baseline confounders, ascertainment bias, confounding by indication and healthy user bias. Statin use in observational studies may be a surrogate marker for higher socioeconomic standards, access to health care or use of other preventive services.

The Spanish Interdisciplinary Committee for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention and the Spanish Society of Cardiology reviewed this guideline and compared it with current European guidelines on cardiovascular prevention and dyslipidemia management. The most striking aspect of the American guideline is the elimination of the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol treat-to-target strategy and the adoption of a risk reduction strategy in 4 major statin benefit groups. In patients with established cardiovascular disease, both guidelines recommend a similar therapeutic strategy (high-dose potent statins). However, in primary prevention, the application of the American guidelines would substantially increase the number of persons, particularly older people, receiving statin therapy. The elimination of the cholesterol treat-to-target strategy, so strongly rooted in the scientific community, could have a negative impact on clinical practice, create a certain amount of confusion and uncertainty among professionals, and decrease follow-up and patient adherence. Thus, this article reaffirms the recommendations of the European guidelines. Although both guidelines have positive aspects, doubt remains regarding the concerns outlined above.

Three-month-old male wild-type mice (C57BL6 strain) were divided into four groups: (1) group W, nourished with a standard diet; (2) group WH, fed a hyperlipidic diet; (3) group WS, nourished with a standard diet plus oral simvastatin (20 mg/kg/day); and (4) group WHS, fed a hyperlipidic diet plus oral simvastatin (20 mg/kg/day). All animals received only their specific diet and water for 60 days. Blood samples were collected for the analysis of calcium, triglycerides, total cholesterol (TC) and fraction serum levels. Diet manipulation was able to induce a dyslipidaemic status in mice, characterized by triglyceride and TC rise in WH animals. Simvastatin prevented hypercholesterolaemia and reduced TC and LDL serum levels, but did not prevent hypertriglyceridaemia and HDL serum levels in the WHS group. In the WH mice the hyperlipidaemia was associated with reduction in trabecular bone thickness, femur structural and material property alterations. Simvastatin prevented these morphological alterations and minimized femur biomechanical changes in WHS mice.

Age-matched, sham-irradiated rats served as controls. Lipid profile, heart and liver morphology and cardiac mechanical function were determined for up to 120\u00a0days after irradiation. TBI resulted in a sustained increase in total- and LDL-cholesterol (low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol), and triglycerides. Simvastatin (10\u00a0mg/kg body weight/day) administered continuously from 9\u00a0days after irradiation mitigated TBI-induced increases in total- and LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides, as well as liver injury. TBI resulted in cellular peri-arterial fibrosis, whereas control hearts had less collagen and fibrosis. Simvastatin mitigated these morphological injuries. TBI resulted in cardiac mechanical dysfunction. Simvastatin mitigated cardiac mechanical dysfunction 20-120\u00a0days following TBI.

Atorvastatin, rosuvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin and pravastatin (10 mg/kg/day) were administered for 12 weeks. After pretreatment of 12 weeks myocardial necrosis was induced by subsequent injection of ISO (85 mg/kg/day, s.c.) to wistar rats. Serum biochemical parameters like glucose, lipid profile, cardiac markers and transaminases were evaluated. Animals were killed and heart was excised for histopathology and antioxidant study. Statins pretreated rats showed significant protection against ISO induced elevation in serum biochemical parameters and serum level of cardiac marker enzymes and transaminase level as compared to ISO control group. Mild to moderate protection was observed in different statins treated heart in histopathology and TTC stained sections. Result from our study also revealed that statins could efficiently protect against ISO intoxicated myocardial necrosis by impairing membrane bound enzyme integrity and endogenous antioxidant enzyme levels. Amongst all statins used, rosuvastatin and pravastatin were found to have maximum cardio-protective activity against ISO induced myocardial necrosis as compared to other statins.", 
    "168": "Since their introduction, statin (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor) drugs have advanced the practice of cardiology to unparalleled levels. Even so, coronary heart disease (CHD) still remains the leading cause of death in developed countries, and is predicted to soon dominate the causes of global mortality and disability as well. The currently available non-statin drugs have had limited success in reversing the burden of heart disease, but new information suggests they have roles in sizeable subpopulations of those affected. In this review, the status of approved non-statin drugs and the significant potential of newer drugs are discussed. Several different ways to raise plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (HDL-C) levels have been proposed, but disappointments are now in large part attributed to a preoccupation with HDL quantity, rather than quality, which is more important in cardiovascular (CV) protection. Niacin, an old drug with many antiatherogenic properties, was re-evaluated in two imperfect randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and failed to demonstrate clear effectiveness or safety. Fibrates, also with an attractive antiatherosclerotic profile and classically used for hypertriglyceridemia, lacks evidence-based proof of efficacy, save for a subgroup of diabetic patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia. Omega-3 fatty acids fall into this category as well, even with an impressive epidemiological evidence base. Omega-3 research has been plagued with methodological difficulties yielding tepid, uncertain, and conflicting results; well-designed studies over longer periods of time are needed. Addition of ezetimibe to statin therapy has now been shown to decrease levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (LDL-C), accompanied by a modest decrease in the number of CV events, though without any improvement in CV mortality. Importantly, the latest data provide crucial evidence that LDL lowering is central to the management of CV disease. Of drugs that inhibit cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) tested thus far, two have failed and two remain under investigation and may yet prove to be valuable therapeutic agents. Monoclonal antibodies to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9, now in phase III trials, lower LDL-C by over 50\u00a0% and are most promising. These drugs offer new ability to lower LDL-C in patients in whom statin drug use is, for one reason or another, limited or insufficient. Mipomersen and lomitapide have been approved for use in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, a more common disease than appreciated. Anti-inflammatory drugs are finally receiving due attention in trials to elucidate potential clinical usefulness. All told, even though statins remain the standard of care, non-statin drugs are poised to assume a new, vital role in managing dyslipidemia.",

Although taking multiple medications may be necessary to manage these conditions, it is important to consider the benefits and risks of each medication and the therapeutic goals of the patient. This article provides an in-depth look at the number and types of drugs used by seniors using drug claims data from the CIHI's National Prescription Drug Utilization Information System Database, representing approximately 70% of seniors in Canada. In 2012, almost two-thirds (65.9%) of seniors on public drug programs had claims for five or more drug classes, while 27.2% had claims for 10 or more, and 8.6% had claims for 15 or more. The most commonly used drug class was statins, used by nearly half (46.6%) of seniors. Nearly two-thirds (60.9%) of seniors living in long-term care (LTC) facilities had claims for 10 or more drug classes. Proton pump inhibitors were the most commonly used drug class among seniors living in LTC facilities (used by 37.0% of seniors in LTC facilities), while statins ranked seventh (29.8%).", 
    "176": "Freshly isolated human hepatocytes are considered the gold standard for in vitro studies of liver functions, including drug transport, metabolism, and toxicity. For accurate predictions of the in vivo outcome, the isolated hepatocytes should reflect the phenotype of their in vivo counterpart, i.e., hepatocytes in human liver tissue. Here, we quantified and compared the membrane proteomes of freshly isolated hepatocytes and human liver tissue using a label-free shotgun proteomics approach. A total of 5144 unique proteins were identified, spanning over 6 orders of magnitude in abundance. There was a good global correlation in protein abundance. However, the expression of many plasma membrane proteins was lower in the isolated hepatocytes than in the liver tissue. This included transport proteins that determine hepatocyte exposure to many drugs and endogenous compounds. Pathway analysis of the differentially expressed proteins confirmed that hepatocytes are exposed to oxidative stress during isolation and suggested that plasma membrane proteins were degraded via the protein ubiquitination pathway. Finally, using pitavastatin as an example, we show how protein quantifications can improve in vitro predictions of in vivo liver clearance. We tentatively conclude that our data set will be a useful resource for improved hepatocyte predictions of the in vivo outcome.",

This review aims to evaluate the efficacy of RYR on blood pressure (BP), lipid profile, and C-reactive protein (CRP) in treating hypertension. Seven electronic databases including the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, PubMed, the Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), the Chinese Scientific Journal Database (VIP), the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM), and the Wanfang database were searched. To investigate the role of RYR for hypertension, randomized controlled trials for the use of RYR either as monotherapy or in combination with conventional medicine versus placebo, no intervention, or conventional medicine for hypertension were identified. A total of 21 trials containing 4558 patients were analyzed, the majority of which had low methodological quality. \"RYR plus conventional therapy\" exhibited significant lowering effects on serum total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and CRP but exhibited no significant effect on systolic BP, diastolic BP, triglycerides (TG), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) compared with \"placebo plus conventional therapy.\" \"RYR plus conventional therapy\" showed significant lowering effects on systolic BP, TC, LDL-C, and CRP but no effect on diastolic BP, TG, and HDL-C compared with \"placebo plus conventional therapy.\" No significant difference in BP and lipid profile between \"RYR plus conventional therapy\" and \"statins plus conventional therapy\" was observed. \"RYR plus statins\" appeared to be more effective in lowering BP, TC, TG, and LDL-C but without a significant difference in HDL-C compared to statins. No serious adverse events were reported. The results of this meta-analysis suggested some supportive but limited evidence regarding RYR for hypertension.

Biochemical parameters of the blood of the patients and an ultrasonography of the liver were performed at baseline. Then patients received lifestyle advice and were treated for a 12 mo period with rosuvastatin (10 mg/d) monotherapy. Patients were re-evaluated during the study at 3 mo intervals, during which biochemical parameters of the blood were measured including liver enzymes. A repeat biopsy and ultrasonography of the liver were performed at the end of the study in all 20 patients. Changes in liver enzymes, fasting plasma glucose, serum creatinine, serum uric acid (SUA), high sensitivity C reactive protein (hsCRP) and lipid profile were assessed every 3 mo.

To identify patients at high risk for CLI, we developed a simple risk score for peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD).In our cross-sectional study, we first evaluated 1000 consecutive PAOD patients treated at our institution from 2005 to 2007, documenting clinical symptoms, comorbidities, and concomitant medication. We calculated odds ratios (OR) in a binary logistic regression model to find possible risk factors for CLI. We then verified the score in a second step that included the 1124 PAOD patients we treated between 2007 and 2011.In the first patient group, the greatest risk factors for CLI were age \u226575 years (OR 2.0), type 2 diabetes (OR 3.1), prior myocardial infarction (OR 2.5), and therapy with low molecular weight heparins (2.8). We scored 1 point for each of those conditions. One point was given for age between 65 and 75 years (OR 1.6) as well as for therapy with cardiac glycosides (OR 1.9) or loop diuretic therapy (OR 1.5). As statin therapy was protective for CLI with an OR of 0.5, we subtracted 1 point for those patients.In the second group, we could prove that frequency of CLI was significantly higher in patients with a high CLI score. The score correlated well with inflammatory parameters (c-reactive protein and fibrinogen). We were also able to define 3 different risk groups for low (score -1 to 1), intermediate (score 2-4), and high CLI risk (score >4).We developed a simple risk stratification scheme that is based on conditions that can be easily assessed from the medical history, without any laboratory parameters.

The pathogenesis of coronary atherosclerosis is multi-factorial with dyslipidaemia being one such risk factor. Elevated total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides (TG) levels are primarily responsible. We analysed the fasting pre-operative lipid profiles of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) patients with symptomatic severe premature CAD. A majority of patients had an elevated LDL cholesterol level despite being on a statin. Similarly, no patient with an elevated TG level was prescribed a fibrate. Pre-operative control of known dyslipidaemia was suboptimal in young adults with angiographially proven severe symptomatic CAD.

The objective of this study is to investigate the mechanism of lovastatin-induced antiproliferation in gefitinib-resistant human cholangiocarcinoma.Two gefitinib-resistant cholangiocarcinoma cell lines, SSP-25 and HuH-28, were used in this study to determine how to compensate gefitinib resistance. The combined effect of these two drugs was examined using the MTT assay, qPCR, immunoblotting, flow cytometry, and in vivo xenograft. Results indicated that lovastatin enhanced TNF-\u03b1-induced cell death in vitro. In addition, the combination of lovastatin with gefitinib enhanced accumulation of TNF-\u03b1. Furthermore, the treatment induced a synergistic cytotoxic effect and antiproliferation through apoptosis in SSP-25 cells and cell cycle arrest in HuH-28 cells. Reproductive results were also observed in in vivo xenografts. These observations suggest that the combination of gefitinib and lovastatin might have additive antiproliferative effects against gefitinib-resistant cholangiocarcinoma cells.

In patients without varices, endoscopy surveillance should be continued every 2 years. Patients with high-risk varices (moderate or large in size, or with red color signs, or in Child-Pugh C patients) should be treated with a nonselective \u03b2-blocker to prevent bleeding (propranolol, nadolol or carvedilol). Endoscopic banding ligation is also effective for the prevention of first bleeding, and it is the first choice in patients with contraindications or intolerance to \u03b2-blockers. Acute variceal hemorrhage still has a high mortality rate (around 15%) and requires intensive care management and conservative blood transfusion policy. Treatment is based on the combined use of vasoactive drugs, endoscopic band ligation and prophylactic antibiotics. Failures are best managed by transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS). Balloon tamponade or specifically designed covered esophageal stents can be used as a bridge to definitive therapy in unstable patients. Early, preemptive TIPS might be the first choice in patients at high risk of failure (Child-Pugh B with active bleeding or Child-Pugh C up to 13 points). Patients surviving a variceal bleeding are at high risk of rebleeding. A combination of \u03b2-blockers and endoscopic band ligation is the most effective therapeutic approach. Preliminary data suggest that the addition of simvastatin increases survival in these patients.", 
    "216": "The high pathogenicity of the Ebola virus reflects multiple concurrent processes on infection. Among other important determinants, Ebola fusogenic glycoprotein (GP) has been associated with the detachment of infected cells and eventually leads to vascular leakage and haemorrhagic fever. Here we report that the membrane-anchored GP is sufficient to induce the detachment of adherent cells. The results show that the detachment induced through either full-length GP1,2 or the subunit GP2 depends on cholesterol and the structure of the transmembrane domain. These data reveal a novel molecular mechanism in which GP regulates Ebola virus assembly and suggest that cholesterol-reducing agents could be useful as therapeutics to counteract GP-mediated cell detachment.", 
    "217": "Previous studies have reported that statins can prevent infections, and these findings were ascribed to the anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties of statins. However, the effects of statins on the risk of infection after stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) remain controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between statins and the risk of infection after stroke or TIA by means of a meta-analysis.", 
    "218": "Studies were found by searching major electronic databases using key terms and restricting the results to studies published in English language and human studies. Pooled odds ratio (OR) for the association between infection and statins were analyzed using Stata software. A total of five studies that included 8,791 stroke or TIA patients (3,269 patients in the statin use group and 5,522 in the placebo group) were eligible and abstracted. Pooled analysis demonstrated that statins did not significantly affect the incidence of infection after stroke or TIA compared with a placebo (OR 0.819, 95% CI 0.582-1.151, I2 = 64.2%, p= 0.025). Sensitivity analyses showed that the removal of any single study did not significantly affect the pooled OR. Cumulative meta-analysis showed that the incidence of infection did not vary by publication year. No statistical evidence of publication bias was found among the studies selected, based on the results of Egger's (p = 1.000) and Begg's (p = 0.762) tests.",

Lipid parameters [i.e., low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), etc.], renal function parameters [i.e., estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), etc.], glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were measured at enrollment (baseline), month 6, and month 12.", 
    "235": "The mean daily dose of rosuvastatin and pitavastatin was 2.5 mg and 1.4 mg, respectively. All lipid parameters were significantly more improved in the rosuvastatin group. eGFR improved from baseline in the rosuvastatin group (p \uff1c 0.0001) and showed no tendency to worsen in the pitavastatin group (p=0.2232). In multiple regression analysis (n=134), it was significantly associated with a percent change in total cholesterol (\u03b2=0.2296; p=0.0112), smoking (\u03b2=0.1927; p=0.0224), and HbA1c (\u03b2=-0.1606; p=0.0585). Hs-CRP was significantly improved in both groups. An analysis eliminating the influence of antidiabetic medication showed a significant difference between groups in the change of HbA1c at month 6 from baseline (p=0.0016).

The most effective therapeutic strategy against these diseases is based on statins administration, nevertheless some patients, especially those with metabolic syndrome fail to achieve their recommended LDL targets with statin therapy, moreover, it may induce many serious side effects. Several scientific studies have highlighted a strong correlation between diets rich in flavonoids and cardiovascular risk reduction. In particular, Citrus bergamia Risso, also known as bergamot, has shown a significant degree of hypocholesterolemic and antioxidant/radical scavenging activities. In addition, this fruit has attracted considerable attention due to its peculiar flavonoid composition, since it contains some flavanones that can act as natural statins. Hence, the study of bergamot flavonoids as metabolic regulators offers a great opportunity for screening and discovery of new therapeutic agents. Cholesterol metabolism, flavonoid composition and potential therapeutic use of C. bergamia Risso will be discussed in the following review.", 
    "238": "The risk of having a first stroke is nearly twice as high among African Americans compared to Caucasians. HIV/AIDS is an independent risk factor for stroke. Our study aimed to report the risk factors and short-term clinical outcomes of African Americans with HIV infection and new-onset stroke admitted at the Johns Hopkins Hospitals (2000-2012). Multivariate linear regression was used to examine the association between potential predictors and odds of an unfavorable outcome, defined as a higher modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score on hospital discharge. African Americans comprised 105/125 (84%) of HIV-infected new-onset stroke inpatients (median age 50 years; 69% men; median CD4 140/mL; ischemic 77%; 39% taking highly active antiretroviral therapy). Vascular risk factors were common: hypertension (67%), cigarette smoking (66%), dyslipidemia (42%), hepatitis C (48%), intravenous drug abuse (32%), and prior myocardial infarction (29%). Prior aspirin and statin use were uncommon (18%, 9%). Unfavorable outcome (mRS score 4-6, n\u2009=\u200922 of 90 available records) was noted in 24% of patients, including seven in-hospital deaths. On multivariate analyses, higher CD4 count on hospital admission was associated with a lower mRS (-0.2 mRS points per 1 unit increase in CD4, 95% CI (-0.3, 0), p\u2009=\u20090.03). Intracerebral hemorrhage was also associated with a lower mRS (1.0 points lower, 95% CI (0.2, 1.8) compared to ischemic stroke, p\u2009=\u20090.01) after adjustment for other potential predictors. This underscores the importance of HIV infection on functional stroke outcomes beyond its recognized influence on stroke risk.", 
    "239": "Statins as lipid lowering drugs, are safe and effective in reducing cardiovascular disease risk, but rarely produce myopathy like myalgia, myositis or rhabdomyolysis. We report the case of Rosuvastatin induced rhabdomyolytic acute renal failure and quadriparesis in a 67-year old male, a known case of type-2 diabetes mellitus and with a history of coronary angioplasty four months back. He was on antihypertensive, oral hypoglycemic and antiplatelet medications with Rosuvastatin 40mg/day. He was admitted with altered sensorium, breathlessness, vomiting, muscle weakness and decreased urine output and had raised serum creatinine, creatinine phosphokinase and myoglobin. After ruling out all other causation for rhabdomyolysis, we stopped Rosuvastatin and started supportive management and hemodialysis. Patient showed gradual recovery in renal function and quadriparesis. Patient was discharged with good urine output and on antihypertensive, hypoglycemic drug and diet restrictions for lipid control. He recovered completely and had normal renal function with well controlled lipid level on follow up of 6 months after discharge. Thus, prompt diagnosis of Rhabdomyolysis due to Rosuvastatin in absence of other aetiology and the multidisciplinary management can prevent further complication with favorable outcome.", 
    "240": "Recently a Dutch research group published an analysis of the Dutch screening programme for familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) in JAMA. They showed that the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) was lower among persons with a mutation causing FH than in their unaffected relatives. FH patients who were carriers of mutations without residual LDL receptor function had DM2 less often than those with residual LDL receptor function. Although it is tempting to speculate about a causal relationship between cholesterol transport and DM2, another explanation could be the healthier lifestyle of patients with FH. This study should not change clinical practice and should certainly not lead to discontinuation of statin therapy.",

    "242": "Comparison of the Revised Atlanta Classification and Determinant Based Classification has shown heterogeneous results. Simvastatin has a protective effect against acute pancreatitis. Young black male, alcohol, smoldering symptoms, and subsequent diagnosis of chronic pancreatitis are risk factors associated with readmissions after acute pancreatitis. A reliable clinical or laboratory marker or a scoring system to predict severity is lacking. The PYTHON trial has shown that oral feeding with on demand nasoenteric tube feeding after 72\u200ah is as good as nasoenteric tube feeding within 24\u200ah in preventing infections in predicted severe acute pancreatitis. Male sex, multiple organ failure, extent of pancreatic necrosis, and heterogeneous collection are factors associated with failure of percutaneous drainage of pancreatic collections.", 
    "243": "The newly proposed classification systems of acute pancreatitis need to be evaluated more critically. New biomarkers are needed for severity prediction. Further well designed studies are required to assess the type of enteral nutritional formulations for acute pancreatitis. The optimal minimally invasive method or combination to debride the necrotic collections is evolving. There is a great need for a drug to treat the disease early on to prevent morbidity and mortality.", 
    "244": "While coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) has been playing a significant role in the revascularization for ischemic heart disease, neurological complications associated with CABG have been a primary concern. Stroke, although the incidence is low, is one of the most devastating complication of CABG. Many studies have identified the risk factors for stroke with CABG, such as prior stroke, carotid artery stenosis, aortic atherosclerosis, atrial fibrillation and cardiopulmonary bypass. Various rational approaches focusing on individual risk factor have been proposed for the stroke. Prophylactic carotid revascularization is an important strategy, and the diagnosis of carotid stenosis has to be established correctly. Prevention of emboli from aortic plaque is also an essential issue. Intraoperative monitoring with transesophageal or epiaortic ultrasound is useful to identify mobile atheromatous plaques and to select appropriate aortic manipulations. Maintenance of cerebral blood flow and blood pressure during cardiopulmonary bypass might be critical issues. Besides, there are conflicting two opinions regarding off-pump CABG; one supports an efficiency for the prevention of stroke while the other advocates no effect. This discrepancy might be explained by the difference of the risk of stroke in the population of the individual study and by the variation of the percentage of aortic clamping or aortic anastomosis in each study. Pharmaceutical therapies such as statin, preventive medication for atrial fibrillation, or antiplatelet are promising methods. Although it is hard to decrease the incidence of the stroke with any single countermeasure, sustained effort should be continued to overcome the stroke associated with CABG.",
