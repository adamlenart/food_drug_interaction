An 84-year-old man presented with cognitive decline that progressed rapidly over two months. Head magnetic resonance imaging showed an acute-stage infarct occurring frequently in the right cerebral hemisphere, and he underwent hospitalization and treatment. On neck magnetic resonance angiography (MRA), severe stenosis was found at the origin of the right internal carotid artery. Since he took aspirin, clopidogrel, and a statin after placement of an indwelling coronary stent, we treated him by adding argatroban and edaravone drip therapy to his existing medication. CAS was performed on day 15 of the hospitalization. A small in-stent thrombosis with plaque protrusion was observed on a carotid sonogram performed at the second day after CAS, and re-examination at the seventh day confirmed enlargement of the lesion and an increase in peak systolic velocity; thus, a second CAS procedure was performed on the same day. After the second CAS, oral cilostazol was added for triple antiplatelet therapy (TAPT), but as the in-stent thrombosis increased further, we started a continuous infusion of heparin with the goal of an activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) of 50 to 65 seconds. After starting heparin, the lesion did not progress; after 14 days of continuous heparin infusion, the patient was switched to TAPT, and regression of the plaque was confirmed. This case demonstrated to us that controlled anticoagulation therapy can be an effective treatment for cases in which a thrombus recurs within a stent after CAS.",

Although the \u2265 7.5% (class I) and \u2265 5% (class IIa) 10-year ASCVD risk thresholds were identified as new indications for treatment by extrapolating results obtained in randomized controlled trials (RCT) of statin therapy, results from population-based European cohorts indicate that >30% of individuals eligible for statin therapy by class I recommendations do not have RCT data supporting statin efficacy. Further, when the US Preventive Services Task Force published their recommendations (based on review of trial evidence), they restricted the indication for statin therapy compared with the ACC/AHA guideline by recommending a higher treatment threshold (10%) combined with \u22651 ASCVD risk factor. However, the evidence base for statins in primary prevention grew substantially in 2016 with publication of the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation-3 (HOPE-3) trial that enrolled intermediate-risk persons for whom a clear indication for statin therapy was still lacking. The implications of HOPE-3 for the evidence base supporting ACC/AHA risk-based statin allocation remain unknown. Therefore, using MESA (Multiethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, www.mesa-nhlbi.org) - a population-based US cohort - we assessed the extent to which the ACC/AHA recommendations for statin therapy are supported by currently available high-quality RCT evidence: WOSCOPS, AFCAPS/TexCAPS, ASCOT-LLA, CARDS, MEGA, JUPITER and HOPE-3 (ref. 2 and 4 for details).

    "11": "Background -Data from before the 2000s indicate the majority of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) events occur among US adults with systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP)\u2265140/90 mmHg. Over the past several decades, BP declined and hypertension control has improved. Methods -We estimated the percentage of incident CVD events that occur at SBP/DBP<140/90 mmHg in a pooled analysis of three contemporary US cohorts: the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study, the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), and the Jackson Heart Study (JHS) (n=31,856; REGARDS=21,208; MESA=6,779; JHS=3,869). Baseline study visits were conducted in 2003-2007 for REGARDS, 2000-2002 for MESA, and 2000-2004 for JHS. BP was measured by trained staff using standardized methods. Antihypertensive medication use was self-reported. The primary outcome was incident CVD, defined by the first occurrence of fatal or non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction, fatal coronary heart disease, or heart failure. Events were adjudicated in each study. Results -Over a mean follow-up of 7.7 years, 2,584 participants had incident CVD events. Overall, 63.0% (95%CI: 54.9%-71.1%) of events occurred in participants with SBP/DBP<140/90 mmHg; 58.4% (95%CI: 47.7%-69.2%) and 68.1% (95%CI: 60.1%-76.0%) among those taking and not taking antihypertensive medication, respectively. The majority of events occurred in participants with SBP/DBP<140/90 mmHg among those <65 years (66.7%; 95%CI: 60.5%-73.0%) and \u226565 years (60.3%; 95%CI: 51.0%-69.5%), women (61.4%; 95%CI: 49.9%-72.9%) and men (63.8%; 95%CI: 58.4%-69.1%), and for whites (68.7%; 95%CI: 66.1%-71.3%), blacks (59.0%; 95%CI: 49.5%-68.6%), Hispanics (52.7% 95%CI: 45.1%-60.4%) and Chinese-Americans (58.5%; 95%CI: 45.2%-71.8%). Among participants taking antihypertensive medication with SBP/DBP<140/90 mmHg, 76.6% (95% CI: 75.8%-77.5%) were eligible for statin treatment but only 33.2% (95%CI: 32.1%-34.3%) were taking one and 19.5% (95%CI: 18.5%-20.5%) met the Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention Trial eligibility criteria and may benefit from a SBP target goal of 120 mmHg. Conclusions -While higher BP levels are associated with increased CVD risk, in the modern era, the majority of incident CVD events occur in US adults with SBP/DBP<140/90 mmHg. Although absolute risk and cost-effectiveness should be considered, additional CVD risk reduction measures for adults with SBP/DBP<140/90 mmHg at high risk for CVD may be warranted.",

We report a case of atorvastatin and ticagrelor associated severe rhabdomyolysis that progressed to multiorgan failure requiring renal replacement therapy, inotropes, intubation, and mechanical ventilation. Despite withdrawal of the precipitating cause and the supportive measures including renal replacement therapy, creatinine kinase increased due to ongoing rhabdomyolysis rapidly progressing to upper and lower limbs weakness. A muscle biopsy was performed to exclude myositis which confirmed extensive myonecrosis, consistent with statin associated rhabdomyolysis. After a prolonged ventilatory course in the intensive care unit, patient's condition improved with recovery from renal and liver dysfunction. The patient slowly regained her upper and lower limb function; she was successfully weaned off the ventilator and was discharged for rehabilitation. To our knowledge, this is a second case of statin associated rhabdomyolysis due to interaction between atorvastatin and ticagrelor. However, our case differed in that the patient was also on amlodipine, which is considered to be a weak cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitor and may have further potentiated myotoxicity.",

In the general population, lipid metabolism disorders, which cause the initiation and progression of atherosclerotic vascular changes, are major targets for preventive and therapeutic strategies in cardiovascular medicine. However, data from large cohort studies and from clinical trials suggest that the treatment guidelines on cardiovascular disease prevention and therapy cannot uncritically be transferred from individuals with intact renal function to CKD patients. Thus, unlike in the general population, neither plasma levels of HDL-cholesterol, nor the key parameter of HDL-cholesterol function-that is, cholesterol efflux capacity-predicts future cardiovascular events. Therefore, HDL-cholesterol should presently not be considered as therapeutic target in CKD patients. In contrast, lowering of LDL-cholesterol has been shown to reduce cardiovascular events at least among nondialysis CKD patients. The cardiovascular benefit of targeting LDL-cholesterol among dialysis CKD patients is less evident. We strongly believe that at least some subgroups of dialysis patients may profit from such treatment, particularly those with highest baseline LDL-cholesterol. Finally, as CKD patients have been characterized to have rather high intestinal cholesterol absorption, and relatively low hepatic cholesterol synthesis, substituting combined statin/ezetimibe treatment for statin monotherapy may be of particular benefit for nephrologic patients.",

Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between individual and regional factors and secondary prevention achievement at baseline. Cox proportional hazards regression analysis was used to determine the association between baseline secondary prevention achievement and cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Results -Overall, 29.9% of patients with diabetes and CVD achieved all 5 secondary prevention parameters at baseline, although 71.8% achieved at least 4 parameters. North America had the highest proportion (41.2%), whereas Western Europe, Eastern Europe, and Latin America had proportions of approximately 25%.

    "69": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading global cause of death, accounting for 17.3 million deaths per year. Preventive treatment that reduces CVD by even a small percentage can substantially reduce, nationally and globally, the number of people who develop CVD and the costs of caring for them. This American Heart Association presidential advisory on dietary fats and CVD reviews and discusses the scientific evidence, including the most recent studies, on the effects of dietary saturated fat intake and its replacement by other types of fats and carbohydrates on CVD. In summary, randomized controlled trials that lowered intake of dietary saturated fat and replaced it with polyunsaturated vegetable oil reduced CVD by \u224830%, similar to the reduction achieved by statin treatment. Prospective observational studies in many populations showed that lower intake of saturated fat coupled with higher intake of polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat is associated with lower rates of CVD and of other major causes of death and all-cause mortality. In contrast, replacement of saturated fat with mostly refined carbohydrates and sugars is not associated with lower rates of CVD and did not reduce CVD in clinical trials. Replacement of saturated with unsaturated fats lowers low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, a cause of atherosclerosis, linking biological evidence with incidence of CVD in populations and in clinical trials. Taking into consideration the totality of the scientific evidence, satisfying rigorous criteria for causality, we conclude strongly that lowering intake of saturated fat and replacing it with unsaturated fats, especially polyunsaturated fats, will lower the incidence of CVD. This recommended shift from saturated to unsaturated fats should occur simultaneously in an overall healthful dietary pattern such as DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) or the Mediterranean diet as emphasized by the 2013 American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology lifestyle guidelines and the 2015 to 2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.", 
    "70": "Background: Published evidence indicates that individual use of metformin and statin is associated with reduced cancer mortality. However, their differential and joint effects on pancreatic cancer survival are inconclusive.Methods: We identified a large population-based cohort of 12,572 patients ages 65 years or older with primary pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) diagnosed between 2008 and 2011 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare-linked database. Exposure to metformin and statins was ascertained from Medicare Prescription Drug Event files. Cox proportional hazards models with time-varying covariates adjusted for propensity scores were used to assess the association while controlling for potential confounders.Results: Of 12,572 PDAC patients, 950 (7.56%) had used metformin alone, 4,506 (35.84%) had used statin alone, and 2,445 (19.45%) were dual users. Statin use was significantly associated with improved overall survival [HR, 0.94; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.90-0.98], and survival was more pronounced in postdiagnosis statin users (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.56-0.86). Metformin use was not significantly associated with overall survival (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.94-1.09). No beneficial effect was observed for dual users (HR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.95-1.05).Conclusions: Our findings suggest potential benefits of statins on improving survival among elderly PDAC patients; further prospective studies are warranted to corroborate the putative benefit of statin therapy in pancreatic cancer.Impact: Although more studies are needed to confirm our findings, our data add to the body of evidence on potential anticancer effects of statins.

    "71": "Statin intolerance is usually defined as the inability of a patient to tolerate statin-treatment due to muscle-related complaints. While randomised trials show that these complaints occure with similar frequency in patients receiving placebo, namely in up to ~5% of the subjects, data from registries as well as clinical experience indicate a much higher frequency of up to ~30%. The lack of standard definition or of a diagnostic marker of statin intolerance confounds the problem. The diagnosis remains subjective based on the symptoms the patient reports. Therefore, a large number of patients that need a statin are not receiving it, or receiving only very-low and/or intermittent doses unable to achieve a robust decrease in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), leaving patients at high or very high risk for cardiovascular events requiring an alternative form of lipid-lowering therapy. Until recently the only available alternatives were niacin, ezetimibe, bile-acid sequestrants and fibrates that decrease LDL-C concentrations by up to 15-20%. Recently the fully human monoclonal antibodies against proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9), alirocumab (Praluent\u00ae) and evolocumab (Repatha\u00ae), which have been shown to decrease LDL-C by up to 70% have been approved in Europe for use in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia not at LDL-C target while on maximally tolerated lipid-lowering therapy and specifically for patients with statin intolerance and in the USA for patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or familial hypercholesterolemia requiring additional LDL-C lowering. Ongoing large clinical trials with cardiovascular endpoints will provide a definitive answer on the role of anti-PCSK9 antibodies in clinical practice.", 
    "72": "In patients with stable coronary artery disease, clinical outcomes are predominantly characterized by the consequences of atherosclerosis on the myocardium, but also by complications of atherosclerosis, notably recurrent acute coronary syndrome or stroke. Secondary prevention therapy is therefore key in this patient population. Intensification of secondary prevention therapy is possible, at the price of a therapeutic risk or a high cost, therefore justifying careful selection of patients with a high residual risk and low therapeutic risk. Two lines of therapy can be intensified, independently of each other, namely anti-thrombotics and lipid-lowering agents. Intensification of anti-thrombotic therapy is efficacious in terms of ischaemic events and cardiovascular mortality, but incurs an excess haemorrhagic risk. Patients aged over 65 years of age and those with a history of intra-cranial haemorrhage are not eligible for intensification of anti-thrombotic therapy. Conversely, patients with prior or recurrent myocardial infarction may benefit from this strategy, especially if they are current smokers or have diabetes mellitus. Intensification of lipid-lowering therapy can be achieved through an association of high-intensity statins with ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitors. This strategy engenders little risk, but the cost of PCSK9 inhibition is high, and should be considered based on the level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol achieved with statin treatment at the maximal tolerated dose. In addition to this patient selection based on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, the presence of diabetes or documented progression of atherosclerosis should be considered.", 
    "73": "Although age-adjusted mortality of coronary heart disease has been successfully reduced over recent years, coronary heart disease still represents a leading cause of death and morbidity, in particular in patients at very high cardiovascular risk. Dyslipidaemia plays a major and causal role in the development and clinical progression of coronary heart disease. At present, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol represents the primary target of lipid-directed therapies for the prevention of cardiovascular disease and events. The new European guidelines recommend intensive statin therapy and the possible addition of ezetimibe to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to a goal of less than 1.8\u2009mmol/L (<70\u2009mg/dL) or by at least 50% if the baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol is between 1.8 and 3.5\u2009mmol/L (70-135\u2009mg/dL) in patients at very high cardiovascular risk. Also, the new European guidelines now mention the potential use of proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors in very high-risk patients with persistently high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol despite maximally tolerated statin treatment in combination with ezetimibe or in patients with statin intolerance. A recent European consensus document discusses the practical clinical use of PCSK9 inhibitors and provides more detailed recommendations. However, despite the overwhelming scientific evidence of the beneficial effects of lipid-lowering therapies, a large proportion of patients at very high cardiovascular risk are not treated according to the current European guideline recommendations. Reinforcing lipid-lowering therapies provides an excellent chance effectively to reduce morbidity and mortality from coronary heart disease.",

    "162": "Smoking is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality. The impact of statin therapy on CVD risk by smoking status has not been fully investigated. Therefore we assessed the impact of statin therapy on CVD outcomes by smoking status through a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis of available randomized controlled trials (RCTs). The literature search included EMBASE, ProQuest, CINAHL and PUBMED databases to 30 January 2016 to identify RCTs that investigated the effect of statin therapy on cumulative incidence of major CVD endpoints (e.g. non-fatal myocardial infarction, revascularization, unstable angina, and stroke). Relative risks (RR) ratios were calculated from the number of events in different treatment groups for both smokers and non-smokers. Finally 11 trials with 89,604 individuals were included. The number of smokers and non-smokers in the statin groups of the analyzed studies was 8826 and 36,090, respectively. The RR for major CV events was 0.73 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.67-0.81; p<0.001) in nonsmokers and 0.72 (95%CI: 0.64-0.81; p<0.001) in smokers. Moderate to high heterogeneity was observed both in non-smokers (I(2)=77.1%, p<0.001) and in smokers (I(2)=51.6%, p=0.024) groups. Smokers seemed to benefit slightly more from statins than non-smokers according to the number needed to treat (NNT) analysis (23.5 vs 26.8) based on RRs applied to the control event rates. The number of avoided events per 1000 individuals was 42.5 (95%CI: 28.9-54.6) in smokers and 37.3 (95%CI: 27.2-46.4) in non-smokers. In conclusion, this meta-analysis suggests that the effect of statins on CVD is similar for smokers and non-smokers, but in terms of NNTs and number of avoided events, smokers seem to benefit more although non-significantly.", 
    "163": "Red yeast rice, a commercially available food supplement known to reduce serum cholesterol, has been repeatedly advocated as alternative therapy for hypercholesterolemic patients that refuse statins, cannot tolerate statin therapy's side effects, or request a \"naturopathic\" medicine. Red yeast rice contains a fungus (Monascus purpureus), which was utilized in the original production of lovastatin (MEVACOR, Merck & Co, Whitehouse Station, NJ), the first marketed pharmaceutical statin, and is chemically identical to such product. Their identical properties account for the similarity in therapeutic and side effects of red yeast rice and lovastatin. The red yeast rice ingredient that blocks cholesterol production is monacolin K. Because red yeast rice preparations have large variability in monacolin K content, predicting or understanding dose-related efficacy and side-effect risks of red yeast rice is practically impossible. The lipid-regulating potency of red yeast rice in commercial preparations was found to be extensively different according to the number or concentration of monacolin K they possess. Furthermore, more than one type of monacolin was found in different preparations (or batches) of red yeast rice. Other ingredients found in red yeast rice are also known to be potentially toxic. The US Food and Drug Administration issued warnings to consumers in 2007 and in 2013 against taking red yeast rice products due to the lack of assurance about its efficacy, safety, and lack of standardized preparation methods. This article discusses my clinical trial results with red yeast rice, reviews the literature on its therapeutic and side effects, and discusses why red yeast rice is not an acceptable substitution for statins.",

An additional injection of apoptotic cells during the intermediate phase (7 days post-bleomycin treatment) or simvastatin administration alone on days 7-13 post-treatment did not promote anti-fibrotic responses beyond those induced by a single early apoptotic cell infusion alone. Additional administration of apoptotic cells with simvastatin further enhanced the efferocytic ability of alveolar macrophages and PPAR\u03b3 activity, and induced hepatocyte growth factor and interleukin-10 expression, in alveolar macrophages and lung tissue. Additional administration of apoptotic cells with simvastatin also reduced mRNA expression of bleomycin-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers in isolated alveolar type II epithelial cells, fibrotic markers in fibroblasts, and hydroxyproline in lung tissue. Enhanced anti-EMT and anti-fibrotic efficacy was confirmed by immunofluorescence and trichrome staining of lung tissue.

In contrast, VLDLR deletion in the mother alters milk metabolism, which inhibits osteoclast differentiation\u00a0and causes osteopetrosis in the offspring. The maternal effects are dominant.

High levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol cause heart diseases by increasing the formation of atherosclerotic plaques.

PCSK9 also appears to modulate glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, abdominal obesity, inflammation, and hypertension. The magnitude of PCSK9's involvement in the onset of these metabolic abnormalities appears to be associated with age, sex, and ethnic background. Another regulator, the inducible degrader of the LDL receptor (IDOL), works by enhancing the ubiquitination of the LDL receptor. Herein, we will review the functions and regulatory mechanisms of PCSK9. The effects of PCSK9 on the LDL receptor, the relationship of this convertase with IDOL, and treatments currently available against hypercholesterolemia are also discussed.",

Clinicians have traditionally evaluated each of the major risk factors contributing to metabolic syndrome on an individual basis. There is evidence, however, that the risk factors are more than additive. The overlap of these factors in each disease state, resulting in increased atherogenic risks, is worth examining as a broader entity rather than separately. While therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLCs) should be strongly recommended, clinicians should not let the perfect be the enemy of the possible. Evidence-based doses of statins, aspirin and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, or angiotensin II receptor blockers should be prescribed as adjuncts, not alternatives, to TLCs. In fact, there is cogent evidence that the benefits of these pharmacologic therapies may also be at least additive.",

Observation that statins ameliorate the neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple sclerosis (MS) and cerebral ischemic stroke, the neuroprotective effects of these drugs are thought to be linked to their anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and anti-excitotoxic properties. Despite the voluminous literature on the clinical advantages of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl Co-enzyme A reductase (HMGCR) inhibitors (statins) in cardiovascular system, the neuroprotective effects and the underlying mechanisms are little understood. Hence, the present review tries to provide a critical overview on the statin-induced neuroprotection, which are presumed to be associated with the ability to reduce cholesterol, Amyloid-\u03b2 and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) levels, decrease reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS and RNS) formation, inhibit excitotoxicity, modulate matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), stimulate endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and increase cerebral blood perfusion.

There is evidence that statins have pleiotropic effects-that is, cholesterol-independent effects-that may also confer protection from cardiovascular disease and potentially numerous other pathologies, including cancer. Statins also have a number of well described adverse effects, including myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, liver damage, and type 2 diabetes. This paper examines the evidence of epigenetic modifications as a contributory factor to the pleiotropic and adverse effects of statins. In vitro and animal studies have shown that statins can inhibit histone deacetylase activity and increase histone acetylation. Similarly, there is evidence that statins may inhibit both histone and DNA methyltransferases and subsequently demethylate histone residues and DNA, respectively. These changes have been shown to alter expression of various genes, including tumor suppressor genes and genes thought to have anti-atherosclerotic actions. Statins have also been shown to influence the expression of numerous microRNAs that suppress the translation of proteins involved in tumorigenesis and vascular function. Whether the adverse effects of statins may also have an epigenetic component has been less widely studied, although there is evidence that microRNA expression may be altered in statin-induced muscle and liver damage. As epigenetics and microRNAs influence gene expression, these changes could contribute to the pleiotropic and adverse effects of statins and have long-lasting effects on the health of statin users.",

However, the rate of high residual on-clopidogrel treatment platelet reactivity (RCPR) in rosuvastatin-treated patients exceeded the rate of high RCPR in atorvastatin-treated patients insignificantly. In 6 months after ACS residual platelet reactivity did not differ between the groups.

In patients, randomly switching from one statin type to another at 6 month of treatment, platelet reactivity did not change significantly in comparison to baseline and the prevalence of high RCPR was lower than in patients receiving statins without switching. Thus, in patients with diabetes with ACS on DAPT with acetylsalicylic acid and clopidogrel statin treatment should be started with atorvastatin and in 6 months after ACS atorvastatin should be switched to rosuvastatin.

Increases in high-intensity statin use following hospital discharge occurred over this period among patients initiating treatment (30.6% to 72.0% in MarketScan and 21.1% to 58.8% in Medicare) and those taking low- or moderate-intensity statins prior to hospitalization (from 27.8% to 62.3% in MarketScan and from 12.6% to 45.1% in Medicare). In 2014, factors associated with filling high-intensity statin prescriptions included male sex, filling beta-blocker and antiplatelet agent prescriptions, and attending cardiac rehabilitation within 30 days following discharge.",

    "272": "Statins are considered the main stay of treatment in the prevention of cardio-vascular morbidity and mortality. They have multiple pleiotropic effects, like stabilization of atherosclerotic plaques, inhibition of platelet aggregation, and vascular smooth muscle proliferation; in addition to their lipid lowering action. Statins manifest these pleiotropic effects because they activate\u00a0KATP channels in the cardiac and vascular tissue. Simultaneous activation of the KATP channels by statins in \u03b2 cells of pancreas may inhibit insulin release which may lead to diabetes. Areas covered: Literature published between 1980 and 2016 on cholesterol biosynthesis, new onset diabetes and on the pleiotropic effects of statins, was reviewed. A comprehensive search on PubMed, Embase and Cochrane databases was carried out. Expert opinion: Statins exert their beneficial pleiotropic effects on the cardiovascular system by activating KATP channels in the cardiac and vascular tissue. However, simultaneous activation of KATP channels in the beta cells of pancreas leads to inhibition of insulin release. This disturbs the carbohydrate metabolism and probably leads to diabetes. In our opinion, use of stains should be more judicious and restricted to secondary prevention only.", 
    "273": "MACC1 (Metastasis Associated in Colon Cancer 1) is a key driver and prognostic biomarker for cancer progression and metastasis in a large variety of solid tumor types, particularly colorectal cancer (CRC). However, no MACC1 inhibitors have been identified yet. Therefore, we aimed to target MACC1 expression using a luciferase reporter-based high-throughput screening with the ChemBioNet library of more than 30,000 compounds. The small molecules lovastatin and rottlerin emerged as the most potent MACC1 transcriptional inhibitors. They remarkably inhibited MACC1 promoter activity and expression, resulting in reduced cell motility. Lovastatin impaired the binding of the transcription factors c-Jun and Sp1 to the MACC1 promoter, thereby inhibiting MACC1 transcription. Most importantly, in CRC-xenografted mice, lovastatin and rottlerin restricted MACC1 expression and liver metastasis. This is-to the best of our knowledge-the first identification of inhibitors restricting cancer progression and metastasis via the novel target MACC1. This drug repositioning might be of therapeutic value for CRC patients.", 
    "274": "There are pathophysiologic similarities between calcification and atherosclerosis because both are the product of an active inflammatory process. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of statin treatment on calcification in bovine pericardial tissue valves.", 
    "275": "Forty Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 4 groups according to hypercholesterolemia induction and statin intake (Group 1, n=10: normal diet without statin treatment, Group 2, n=10: normal diet with statin treatment, Group 3, n=10: high fat diet without statin treatment, Group 4, n=10: high fat diet with statin treatment). Serum lipid levels were measured just before the experiment and after 4 and 12 weeks. Bovine pericardial tissue valve cusps were surgically implanted in rat dorsal subcutis at 4 weeks. After the surgery, statin was administered daily to Groups 2 and 4. Serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) level was measured at 5 weeks. Cusps were explanted at 12 weeks and calcium levels were determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy.", 
    "276": "Mean IL-6 was significantly higher in Group 3 at 5 weeks (7.14, 2.03, 31.70, and 6.90 pg/dL for each group, respectively). Mean calcium level in Group 3 was significantly higher among groups but Group 4 was significantly lower compared to Group 3 and was similar to Group 1, 2 (1.86, 1.92, 2.55, and 1.80 mg/g for each group, respectively, p<0.01).", 
    "277": "Hypercholesterolemia may be a significant risk factor for bovine pericardial valve calcification. Statin treatment significantly attenuated calcification of bovine pericardial valve tissue in a rat subdermal implantation model and might prolong the durability of bioprostheses.", 
    "278": "There are multiple guidelines for managing patients with high-risk cardiovascular disease, and unfortunately for the practicing clinician, these guidelines are quite variable. Some are fairly specific whereas others are not, resulting in a great deal of confusion regarding whether management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) should be tailored only, targeted only, or managed by a combination of both. In the management of cardiovascular disease, favorable cardiovascular outcomes can be obtained by simply lowering the LDL-C in the absence of any other medications. The advent of statins, the most potent LDL-C-lowering medication yet when developed, provided benefits augmented by the presence of multiple pleiotropic effects. Tailoring and/or targeting the decrease in LDL-C is also an issue of concern. Then, in 2016, the new proprotein convertase sutilisin-like/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors appeared, providing a solution to patients with high-risk cardiovascular disease with statin intolerance and those who did not attain a desired LDL-C level while on a high-dose statin. These new PCSK9 inhibitors necessitate a determination of how low the LDL-C can and should go, most likely safely down to a beneficial level of 25 mg/dL for the highest-risk patient. These issues are documented and discussed with an attempt to help the reader make an informed risk management decision.", 
    "279": "Pravastatin is an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl- glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase that has been reported to have therapeutic applications in a range of inflammatory conditions. The aim of the present study was to assess the radioprotective effects of pravastatin in an experimental animal model. Mice were divided into two groups: The control group received ionizing radiation with no prior medication, while the pravastatin group received pravastatin prior to ionizing radiation. Pravastatin was administered orally at 30 mg/kg body weight in drinking water at 24 and 4 h before irradiation. Intestinal crypt epithelial cell survival and the incidence of apoptosis in the intestine and lung were measured post-irradiation. The effect of pravastatin on intestinal DNA damage was determined by immunohistochemistry. Finally, the effect of pravastatin on tumor response to radiotherapy was examined in a mouse mesothelioma xenograft model. Pravastatin increased the number of viable intestinal crypts and this effect was statistically significant in the ileum (P<0.0001). The pravastatin group showed significantly lower apoptotic indices in all examined parts of the intestine (P<0.0001) and tended to show reduced apoptosis in the lung. Pravastatin reduced the intestinal expression of ataxia-telangiectasia mutated and gamma-H2AX after irradiation. No apparent pravastatin-related differences were observed in the response of xenograft tumors to irradiation. In conclusion, pravastatin had radioprotective effects on the intestine and lung and reduced radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks. Pravastatin may increase the therapeutic index of radiotherapy.",

    "281": "We examined 3,602 patients in 60 HD facilities dialyzed 3 times/week for \u22654 months from the Japan Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study phases 3-5 (2005-2015). Statin Rx was reported at the end of a 4-month interval (baseline) for each patient. ESA hyporesponsiveness in the subsequent 4 months was then defined as a binary indicator (mean hemoglobin [Hgb] level <10 g/dL and mean ESA dose >6,000 units/week) and separately as the ESA resistance index (ERI; mean ESA dose/[dry weight \u00d7 mean Hgb]). We used adjusted logistic and linear regressions to evaluate the associations between statin Rx and ESA hyporesponsiveness.", 
    "282": "At baseline, 16.2% of patients reported statin Rx; 12.8% were classified as having ESA hyporesponsiveness during 4 months of follow-up. Compared to patients without statin Rx, patients with statin Rx had lower odds of ESA hyporesponsiveness (OR 0.87; 95% CI 0.66-1.15). Similarly, the ERI was lower for those with statin Rx than without (ratio of means, 0.94; 95% CI 0.89-0.99) after adjustment for possible confounders.", 
    "283": "Our results suggest that statins may slightly reduce ESA hyporesponsiveness in HD patients. However, any causal inference is limited by the observational study design and unmeasured compliance with statin Rx.", 
    "284": "Statins reduce infarct size (IS) in ischemia-reperfusion injury of the myocardium. Inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) attenuates this benefit. We investigated the effect of two widely used non-selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) with different degree of anti-COX-2 activity on atorvastatin-mediated preconditioning. Wistar rats received oral atorvastatin (10 mg\u2219kg(-1)\u2219day(-1)), naproxen (10 mg\u2219kg(-1)\u2219day(-1)), diclofenac (8 mg\u2219kg(-1)\u2219day(-1)), atorvastatin+naproxen, atorvastatin+diclofenac or water for three days. Hearts were then excised and perfused in the Langendorff system. Area at risk (AR) and IS were determined after 30 min of regional ischemia and 120 min of reperfusion. Atorvastatin reduced IS by 51.3% compared with controls (14.7 \u00b1 3.9% vs. 30.2 \u00b1 4.6% of the AR; P < 0.001). Naproxen and diclofenac alone did not alter IS compared to control. Diclofenac completely abrogated atorvastatin-mediated protection of the myocardium. Naproxen significantly attenuated but did not eliminate the IS reducing the effect of atorvastatin when compared with controls (P = 0.038). The difference in IS between the atorvastatin+naproxen group and the atorvastatin+diclofenac group showed a strong trend in reaching statistical significance (P = 0.058), but was not found to be significant. Our results suggest relatively small, but noticeable differences among non-selective NSAIDs in their potential to attenuate statin-mediated preconditioning.",

Triglyceride (TG) levels decreased by 22.3% (157 vs 122\u00a0mg/dL, P\u00a0<\u00a0.001), HDL cholesterol levels remained similar (56.0 vs 57.1, P\u00a0= NS). Levels of prebeta-1 HDL were significantly reduced by 17.9% after statin treatment (mean 11.4 vs 9.4\u00a0mg apoA-1/dL, P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). The magnitude of this decrease was similar with each of 3 statins (atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin). The decrease in prebeta-1 HDL was strongly associated with the decline in TG, but not with the decline in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.", 
    "289": "The association of high prebeta-1 HDL with coronary heart disease identifies it as an inferential measure of the rate of cholesterol efflux from the artery wall. Our observations demonstrate a reduction of prebeta-1 HDL with statin therapy, partially reflecting the reduced TGs, and probably reflecting a direct beneficial impact on cholesterol efflux.", 
    "290": "The recent advent of a highly efficacious class of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering agents, the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type-9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, has transformed dyslipidaemia management in patients with cardiovascular disease as well as those with familial hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "291": "Recent positive results of the landmark Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research with PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects with Elevated Risk cardiovascular outcome trial with evolocumab as an add-on to statin therapy demonstrate further reduction of cardiovascular events. Additional safety outcomes from this large randomized trial, as well as the EBBINGHAUS substudy, allay fears of neurocognitive disorder as an adverse effect of achieving very low LDL-C levels with these agents.", 
    "292": "Widespread clinical adoption of PCSK9 inhibitors will depend on the results from ongoing and planned cardiovascular efficacy and safety trials with PCSK9 inhibitors. In addition, understanding the practical challenges and barriers to usage of these injectable agents by high cardiovascular risk patients will also affect clinical adoption of this class of agents. Analysis of cost-benefit models, along with anticipated updates to practice guidelines for dyslipidaemia management are likely to strengthen the clinical utility of PCSK9 inhibitors. Importantly, the potency of this new class of agents provides a huge opportunity to extend further the 'lower LDL-C is better' hypothesis in an effort to reduce rates of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality on a population level.", 
    "293": "Very few studies conducted in Korea have investigated the relationship between statins and the incidence of diabetes. Therefore, we analyzed the progression from normal blood glucose to prediabetes and then to diabetes mellitus (DM) according to the type, intensity, and dose of statin prescribed.", 
    "294": "Data of patients who were first prescribed statins between 2009 and 2011 were extracted from electronic medical records. Patients with normal blood glucose or prediabetes were observed for 4\u00a0years after initiation of statin therapy.", 
    "295": "A total of 2890 patients were included in our study and analyzed on the basis of the first statin they were prescribed. The incidence rate of DM in patients with prediabetes was 1.72 times that of patients with normal glucose levels (odds ratio\u00a0=\u00a01.72, 95% confidence interval\u00a0=\u00a01.41-2.10, P\u00a0<\u00a0.001). Regarding progression from normal blood glucose to prediabetes, the incidence rate of prediabetes was significantly lower in patients prescribed pitavastatin (odds ratio\u00a0=\u00a00.62, 95% confidence interval\u00a0=\u00a00.40-0.96, P\u00a0=\u00a0.031) compared to that in patients prescribed atorvastatin. Regarding the progression from normal blood glucose or prediabetes to DM, there were no significant differences among all statins.", 
    "296": "Lower DM incidence in patients prescribed pitavastatin appears to be primarily because of the lower rate of progression from normal blood glucose to prediabetes. These findings indicate that avoiding statins because of DM risk is unjustified and that clinicians should prescribe statins from the appropriate potency group.", 
    "297": "Background Familial hypercholesterolemia is the elective clinical condition that deserves the maximal personalisation in lipid-lowering therapy, especially in the presence of statin intolerance. Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors represent a promising approach to lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Methods We enrolled 18 patients (mean age 62\u2009\u00b1\u20098 years, 72% men) affected by heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and cardiovascular disease, with a history of statin intolerance assigned to PCSK9 inhibitors. Six patients were also on LDL apheresis. Associated Lp(a)-hyperlipoproteinemia (defined as >60\u2009mg/dl) was observed in two out of 18 subjects. PCSK9 inhibitor injectable monoclonal antibodies were administered, every 2 weeks, on top of patient therapy for 12\u2009\u00b1\u20094 weeks (evolocumab in 15 subjects, alirocumab in three subjects). Results After 3 months (12\u2009\u00b1\u20094 weeks) of therapy, a decrease in total cholesterol (-35%), LDL cholesterol (-51%) and Lp(a) levels (-20%) was observed. Five out of 18 patients reached LDL cholesterol levels of <70\u2009mg/dl, seven showed LDL cholesterol values between 71 and 100\u2009mg/dl, and six out of 18 still had LDL cholesterol levels above 100\u2009mg/dl. Among the six patients with LDL cholesterol levels >100\u2009mg/dl, three were already on LDL apheresis before the PCSK9 inhibitor treatment, while three were referred to LDL apheresis treatment. Adverse events were reported in two out of 18 patients on evolocumab: one presented with flu-like syndrome and the other reported episodes of mild difficulty in maintaining concentration. Conclusions PCSK9 inhibitors represent a novel therapeutic tool for patients with familial hypercholesterolemia who are intolerant to statins. However, more data are needed before cleaning up the old therapeutic armamentarium, such as LDL apheresis, which is likely to preserve its valuable role also in the new lipid-lowering era."
