    "0": "The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, also known as statins, have an enviable safety profile; however, myotoxicity and to a lesser extent hepatotoxicity have been noted in some patients following treatment. Statins target several tissues, depending upon their lipophilicity, where they competitively inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme for mevalonic acid synthesis and subsequently cholesterol biosynthesis. HMG-CoA reductase is also the first committed rate-limiting step for the synthesis of a range of other compounds including steroid hormones and ubidecarenone (ubiquinone), otherwise known as coenzyme Q(10) (CoQ(10)). Recent interest has focused on the possible role CoQ(10) deficiency may have in the pathophysiology of the rare adverse effects of statin treatment. Currently, there is insufficient evidence from human studies to link statin therapy unequivocally to pathologically significantly decreased tissue CoQ(10) levels. Although statin treatment has been reported to lower plasma/serum CoQ(10) status, few human studies have assessed tissue CoQ(10) status. The plasma/serum CoQ(10) level is influenced by a number of physiological factors and, therefore, has limited value as a means of assessing intracellular CoQ(10) status. In those limited studies that have assessed the effect of statin treatment upon tissue CoQ(10) levels, none have shown evidence of a fall in CoQ(10) levels. This may reflect the doses of statins used, since many appear to have been used at doses below those recommended for their maximum therapeutic effects. Moreover, the poor bioavailability in those peripheral tissues tested may not reflect the effects the agents are having in liver and muscle, the tissues commonly affected in those patients who do not tolerate statins. This article reviews the biochemistry of CoQ(10), its role in cellular metabolism and the available evidence linking possible CoQ(10) deficiency to statin therapy.", 
    "1": "More than a decade has passed since it was unintentionally discovered that grapefruit juice interacts with certain drugs. The coadministration of these drugs with grapefruit juice can markedly elevate drug bioavailability, and can alter pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of the drug. The predominant mechanism for this interaction is the inhibition of cytochrome P-450 3A4 in the small intestine, resulting in a significant reduction of drug presystemic metabolism. An additional mechanism is the inhibition of P-glycoprotein, a transporter that carries drug from the enterocyte back to the gut lumen, resulting in a further increase in the fraction of drug absorbed. Some calcium channel antagonists, benzodiazepines, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and cyclosporine are the most affected drugs. A single exposure to one glass of the grapefruit juice can usually produce the maximal magnitude of the interaction. The data available so far, concerning this interaction and its clinical implications, are reviewed in this article. It is likely that more information regarding this interaction will accumulate in the future, and awareness of such is necessary for achieving optimal drug therapy.",

Mean AOPP concentrations are also slightly higher, but this elevation is not quite significant (95.0+/-42.9 micromol/l vs 79.7+/-28.2 micromol/l, p=0.096). AGEs and AOPP correlate significantly with each other and with selected lipids. Patients with atherosclerosis treated with statins have slightly lower CML, AGEs and AOPP (it did not reach the statistical significance).",

    "5": "Patients with type 2 diabetes have an atherogenic lipid profile, which greatly increases their risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) compared with people without diabetes. The largest disparity in lipid levels among people with and without diabetes occurs for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides: triglycerides tend to be markedly higher and HDL-C moderately lower in patients with diabetes, in contrast to the negligible difference observed in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and total cholesterol. However, patients with type 2 diabetes are more likely to have the atherogenic form of LDL-C than people without diabetes, as well as low HDL-C, which restricts reverse cholesterol transport and may also be associated with increased lipid oxidation. Among patients who have suffered a myocardial infarction, increased LDL-C is apparent in early adulthood, whereas a detectable difference in HDL-C levels becomes increasingly apparent with age and most pronounced after age 60 years, compared with healthy controls. Evidence indicates that the increased risk of macrovascular complications of type 2 diabetes begins long before the onset of clinical hyperglycaemia. Despite successful reduction of LDL-C with statin therapy, patients continue to be at increased risk for CHD if their HDL-C levels remain suboptimal, in part due to persistence of enhanced lipid exchange. Observational data suggest that increasing HDL-C should be much more potent therapeutically than a similar proportionate decrease in LDL-C.", 
    "6": "Lipid abnormalities, which are common in type 2 diabetes, predispose to a greatly increased risk of coronary heart disease. This characteristic dyslipidaemia includes decreased concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), elevated triglycerides, and a small, dense, atherogenic form of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Insulin resistance and obesity, which is commonly present in type 2 diabetes, act in concert to disrupt normal lipoprotein metabolism; reverse cholesterol transport in particular. The proatherogenic changes, which result from this process include enrichment of very-low-density lipoprotein with cholesteryl esters and enrichment of LDL with triglycerides. Results from both the Pravastatin Pooling Project and the Heart Protection Study demonstrate that, although people with diabetes obtain the same relative risk reduction with statin therapy, the absolute benefit derived is much lower than for comparable individuals without diabetes. In order to achieve improved outcomes in diabetes patients, it will be important to address other abnormalities in their lipid profiles, including elevated triglycerides and low HDL-C.",

Among patients > or =70 years, the lack of indication was more often cited in the following conditions: 1) in very old patients (36% of lack of indication in the age-group >85 years vs. 10% in 70-75 years), 2) when lipid values were not available (20% when data were not available vs. 9%) and 3) when the patient had no prior history of myocardial infarction (MI) (20% when no history of MI vs. 7%). These factors were not associated with lack of indication among patients <70 years.

TGFbeta1 decreased in the simvastatin and benazepril group compared with the benazepril group (P < 0.01). The ratio of early diastolic blood flow velocity of mitral valve (VE) and blood flow velocity of atrium systolic period (VA) in the 2 groups significantly increased after 6 months of treatment, and the ratio in the simvastatin and benazepril group was significantly higher than that in the enazepril group (P < 0.05).",

Fluoroquinolones especially pefloxacine, were the most incriminated. This drug induced tendinitis in older people aged more than 60 years. Approximatively one case out of five leads to tendon breaking off. The others lead to a favourable outcome after drug withdrawal. In three cases, tendinitis was described with statines, and concerned 2 men and 1 woman, aged more than 50 years. Simvastatine was suspected in two cases and the outcome was favourable in all cases after drug withdrawal. Other drugs, like corticosteroids, can exceptionally induce this side effect that can be serious. Consequences of drug tendinitis can then be dangerous and prescription of this class, and especially fluoroquinolones, must be cautions.",

To date, the results of a single, open-label trial in multiple sclerosis patients have demonstrated that treatment with one of the statins, simvastatin, reduced the number and volume of lesions, as observed using gadolinium-enhancing magnetic resonance imaging. While the results of this first study seem promising, the rationale for using a cholesterol-lowering drug in a demyelinating disease must be addressed, in addition to the potential problems that the side effects of statins may produce in multiple sclerosis patients.",

    "25": "Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) is an inflammatory cytokine involved in atherogenesis. Adipose tissue is an important source of endogenous TNFalpha production. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of atorvastatin on TNFalpha serum concentration and mRNA expressions of subcutaneous adipose in hypercholesterolemic rabbits. Sixteen rabbits fed with a high-cholesterol diet for 8 weeks were randomly divided into 2 groups: (1) the high-cholesterol group (n=8) was maintained on a high-cholesterol diet for 6 weeks; (2) the atorvastatin group (n=8) had the same high-cholesterol diet plus atorvastatin (2.5 mg/kg/d) for 6 weeks. A control group (n=5) was fed with a normal diet for 14 weeks. Subcutaneous adipose was collected for mRNA analysis. Additionally, the direct effect of atorvastatin on TNFalpha release and mRNA expression was assayed in primary rabbit adipocytes. TNFalpha levels in serum and adipocyte culture supernatant were measured by ELISA. RT-PCR was used to evaluate TNFalpha mRNA expression in adipose and adipocytes. Serum TNFalpha concentration was significantly associated with serum total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) (both P<0.01). Compared with the control group, rabbits fed with a high-cholesterol diet showed higher levels of TNFalpha serum concentration and mRNA expression of adipose, both of which were significantly reduced by atorvastatin treatment (both P<0.05). TNFalpha mRNA expressions of adipose were significantly correlated with circulating TNFalpha levels among the 3 groups (r=0.51, P<0.05). Atorvastatin dose-dependently inhibited lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced TNFalpha secretion and mRNA expression in cultured adipocytes. In conclusion, atorvastatin can directly inhibit TNFalpha expression and secretion in adipocytes. Atorvastatin reduced TNFalpha serum concentration in hypercholesterolemic rabbits, which might be because of its cholesterol-lowering effect and direct inhibition of TNFalpha expression in adipose.", 
    "26": "Nitrate tolerance is associated with an enhanced superoxide anion production and can be attenuated by statins, which interact with the 2 main [eNOS and NAD(P)H oxidase] pathways involved in producing this oxidative stress. Three groups of normocholesterolemic rats were treated: group 1 received rosuvastatin (10 mg/kg/d PO) for 5 weeks and in the last 3 days cotreatment with nitroglycerin (NTG 50 mg/kg/d, subcutaneous injections BID); group 2 received only NTG (50 mg/kg/d BID for the last 3 days); and group 3 served as control. Rings of thoracic aortas from these groups were studied in organ baths. Relaxations to NTG (0.1 nM to 0.1 mM) were determined on phenylephrine-preconstricted rings and O2 production (RLU/10 s/mg dry weight) was assessed by lucigenin and the luminol analogue (L-012) chemiluminescence technique. In group 2 (NTG), the concentration-response curves to NTG were significantly shifted to the right: the pD2 (-log NTG concentration evoking a half-maximal relaxation) was 6.75+/-0.06 (n=7) versus 7.75+/-0.07 (n=7) in group 3 (not exposed to NTG, P<0.05); O2 production was enhanced (10,060+/-1,205, n=7 versus 5,235+/-1,052, n=7; P<0.05). In contrast, in group 1, the rightward shift was attenuated: pD2 value was 7.20+/-0.10 (n=8), P<0.05 versus group 2; O2 production was decreased (5911+/-663; n=9, P<0.05 versus group 2). In addition, before NTG exposure, rosuvastatin treatment decreased p22phox [the essential NAD(P)H oxidase subunit] abundance in the aortic wall and decreased NAD(P)H oxidase activity. In contrast, this treatment did not alter either eNOS abundance or the basal release of endothelium-derived NO. Interestingly, in vivo treatment with apocynin, an NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor, produced a protection similar to that with rosuvastatin. Long-term rosuvastatin treatment protects against nitrate tolerance in the rat aorta by counteracting NTG-induced increase in O2 production. This protection seems to involve a direct interaction with the NAD(P)H oxidase pathway rather than an up-regulation of the eNOS pathway.",

We hypothesized that Lung-Kruppel-like factor (LKLF/KLF2), a novel and potent regulator of endothelial gene expression, may mediate the downstream effects of statins. Here we report that statin-induced expression of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and thrombomodulin is KLF2 dependent.",

Multiple lines of evidence suggest that this induction is dependent on inhibition of the Rho pathway and requires de novo transcription. Furthermore, promoter deletion and mutational analyses suggest that mevastatin induced KLF2 promoter activity through a single myocyte enhancer factor binding site. Finally, small-interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of KLF2 strongly attenuated the ability of mevastatin to increase eNOS and thrombomodulin accumulation in endothelial cells.",

Here we show that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) attenuates a high glucose-induced and a diabetes-induced oxidative stress through inhibition of vascular NAD(P)H oxidase. Exposure of cultured aortic endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells to a high glucose level (450 mg/dl) for 3 days significantly increased oxidative stress compared with a normal glucose level (100 mg/dl), as evaluated by the staining with 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate and electron spin resonance (ESR) measurement. This increase was completely blocked by the treatment with pitavastatin (5 x 10(-7)M) as well as a NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor (diphenylene iodonium) or a PKC inhibitor (calphostin C) in parallel with the change of small GTPase Rac-1 activity, a cytosolic regulatory component of NAD(P)H oxidase. Next, using streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, the effect of pitavastatin on oxidative stress was evaluated by in vivo ESR measurements, which is a sensitive, noninvasive method. Administration of pitavastatin (5 mg/kg/day) for 4 days attenuated the increased oxidative stress in diabetic rats to control levels. In conclusion, pitavastatin attenuated a high glucose-induced and a diabetes-induced oxidative stress in vitro and in vivo. Thus, our data may provide a new insight into antioxidative therapy in diabetes.",

Oxidant stress and increased systemic inflammation may contribute to this endothelial dysfunction. Aged garlic extract (AGE) contains antioxidant compounds and increases nitric oxide production and decreases the output of inflammatory cytokines from cultured cells. The aim of this study was to test the effect of treatment with AGE on brachial artery flow mediated endothelium-dependent dilation (FMD) and circulating markers of oxidative stress and systemic inflammation. The trial included 15 men with angiographically proven CAD in a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over design with 2-week treatment and washout periods. During AGE supplementation, FMD increased (44%) significantly (p = 0.04) from the baseline and mainly in men with lower baseline FMD. Levels of FMD at the end of AGE treatment were significantly (p = 0.03) higher compared with the corresponding levels at the end of placebo treatment when the variation in baseline body weight was taken into account. Markers of oxidant stress (plasma oxidized low density lipoprotein and peroxides), systemic inflammation (plasma C-reactive protein ad interleukin-6) and endothelial activation (VCAM-1) did not change significantly during the study. These data suggest that short-term treatment with AGE may improve impaired endothelial function in men with CAD treated with aspirin and a statin.

Combination therapy with colesevelam HCl/ezetimibe resulted in an additional reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels of approximately 20% (P < 0.005) and 16% (P < 0.01), respectively, compared with monotherapy with either agent. Total cholesterol, LDL-C, and non-HDL-C levels were within National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III target ranges at the end of the combination therapy regimen in 10 of 12 patients.

The fasting serum levels of remnant lipoproteins (remnant-like lipoprotein particles cholesterol; RLP-C) were measured by an immunoseparation method in 210 patients with metabolic syndrome meeting ATP III criteria. Flow-mediated endothelium-dependent dilatation (FMD) in the brachial artery during reactive hyperemia was examined by high-resolution ultrasound technique. This study found that elevated RLP-C levels were a significant and independent risk factor for impaired FMD and angiographically proven coronary artery disease (CAD). Treatment with bezafibrate (n = 20) or atorvastatin (n = 20) for 4 weeks significantly reduced RLP-C levels, with a concomitant improvement in FMD. The % reduction in RLP-C levels from baseline after the treatment was independently correlated with the magnitude of improvement in FMD after adjustment for the % changes in levels of triglyceride, hsCRP, and IL-6, and HOMA index. Thus, elevated levels of RLP-C are a risk factor for CAD and endothelial vasomotor dysfunction, a predictor of coronary events, in metabolic syndrome. Measurement of RLP-C is useful for assessment of CAD risk and therapeutic effects in metabolic syndrome.",

Potent anabolic agents such as parathyroid hormone (PTH) and some of its adenylyl cyclase-stimulating fragments are either on their way, or have just now reached the clinic. This article discusses how PTHs might stimulate bone growth. The controversial bone anabolic activities of the widely used cholesterol-lowering lipophilic statins and how they might stimulate bone growth are also probed. Also, evidence is presented for leptin, a controller of body fat stores and the ovarian cycle. It has the remarkable property of being an anabolic and antianabolic that uses a hypothalamic factor to restrain osteoblast activity but by itself stimulates osteoblasts and inhibits osteoclasts.", 
    "58": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, or statins, reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). Because CAD is the major cause of heart failure (HF) in developed countries, prevention of CAD may result in reduced HF. Evidence from randomized trials on lipid reduction (Cholesterol and Recurrent Events and the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study) has shown statins to decrease progression to HF. Recently, many beneficial effects of statins have been demonstrated beyond cholesterol lowering. These agents improve endothelial function, exhibit anti-inflammatory properties, and prevent cardiac hypertrophy. Experimental studies have shown attenuation of left ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarction, possibly through reduced oxidative stress. However, no clinical evidence exists to support an effect on ventricular remodeling. Small, short-lasting clinical studies have also suggested that statin therapy might be associated with improved survival in ischemic and nonischemic HF.", 
    "59": "The lipid-lowering properties of statins are accompanied by a number of other cardioprotective effects. These 'pleiotropic' actions affect almost the entire process of atherogenesis, from initial endothelial injury to the moment of plaque rupture and thrombosis. This paper discusses the nonlipid-lowering effects of statins that affect the initiation, progression, regression and repair of atherosclerosis lesions, as well as factors that affect plaque instability. The emergent anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and immunomodulatory properties of statins are extensive and diverse. Many of these properties, which are independent of cholesterol synthesis inhibition, help to reduce the ischaemic burden on the cardiovascular system. In addition, the immunomodulatory properties of statins may provide new indications for these agents in the treatment of autoimmune diseases.", 
    "60": "Atherosclerosis is a multifactorial condition that can result in cardiovascular disease. Statin therapy is thought to mediate cardioprotective effects that influence endothelial function, inflammatory responses, plaque stability and thrombus formation, processes involved in atherosclerosis. Although reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) potentially plays a role in all of these effects, several lines of evidence also implicate nonlipidmediated 'pleiotropic' effects. For example, statin therapy confers a lower risk for coronary heart disease than placebo in patients with comparable serum cholesterol levels, and confers a greater magnitude of clinical benefit than expected based on LDL-C levels alone. Moreover, while nonstatin lipid-lowering therapy does not necessarily reduce stroke risk, statins have shown a significant reduction in stroke. Statins exert their pleiotropic effects, in part, by improving endothelial function via up-regulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase enzyme activity. Markers of inflammation such as high sensitivity C-reactive protein have been also shown to add further prognostic information about patients at risk of cardiovascular disease who may benefit from statin therapy. Further studies are still needed to determine whether statins have direct effects on inflammatory pathways.", 
    "61": "It has been estimated that 92% of individuals with type 2 diabetes, without cardiovascular disease (CVD), have a dyslipidaemic profile. Several guidelines on cardiovascular risk now recommend that patients with diabetes should be considered at high risk of CVD and should thus receive lipid-lowering therapy to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) to below 2.5 mmol/L. Since their introduction in 1987, statins have revolutionized the management of CVD. The most recent statin to be introduced, rosuvastatin, has been shown to be the most effective at lowering LDL-C, as well as consistently raising HDL-C across the 10-40 mg dose range. This has been confirmed by many studies, including the Measuring Effective Reductions in Cholesterol Using Rosuvastatin Therapy (MERCURY I) study in which rosuvastatin 10 mg was shown to be more effective than commonly used doses of other statins, both for LDL-C reduction and achieving treatment target goals. The effectiveness of rosuvastatin has also been studied in type 2 diabetes patients in three studies: the URANUS (Use of Rosuvastatin vs. Atorvastatin iN type 2 diabetes mellitUS), ANDROMEDA (A raNdomized, Double-blind study to compare Rosuvastatin [10 & 20 mg] and atOrvastatin [10 & 20 Mg] in patiEnts with type II DiAbetes) and CORALL (COmpare Rosuvastatin [10-40 mg] with Atorvastatin [20-80 mg] on apo B/apo A-1 ratio in patients with type 2 diabetes meLLitus and dyslipidaemia) studies. URANUS and ANDROMEDA showed rosuvastatin to be more effective than atorvastatin at reducing LDL-C and achieving treatment target goals. CORALL demonstrated rosuvastatin 10, 20 and 40 mg to be more effective at lowering LDL-C than 20, 40 and 80 mg of atorvastatin, respectively. Ongoing studies will evaluate whether these properties of rosuvastatin translate into beneficial effects on atherosclerosis and significant reductions in cardiovascular events.", 
    "62": "Cardiovascular diseases are the main complications in diabetes. The lipid pattern includes high triglycerides, low HDL and increased small dense LDL. The treatment strategy is based upon the European Guidelines which insist on global risk evaluation and recommend more severe lipid targets for diabetic than for non diabetic patients. After changes of lifestyle and control of risk factors, statins or fibrates are the drugs of choice, even if fibrates have specific impact on patients with diabetes or the metabolic syndrome.", 
    "63": "The sequelae of cardiovascular disease contribute significantly to morbidity and mortality in developed nations. As a class, the statins have been shown to measurably reduce the burden of atherosclerotic illness. However, muscle- and, more recently, nerve-related toxicity have emerged as potential complications leading to treatment withdrawal. Generally, the myopathic signs and symptoms of tenderness, myalgias, cramping and elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) activity are fully reversible after drug discontinuation. Growing evidence suggests that latent or previously minimal symptomatic muscle disease may predispose to the development of myopathy. Less information is available regarding the natural history of the sensorimotor neuropathy, but it appears to be less reversible if large fiber function is clinically manifest. Pathophysiologic clues regarding the potential causes of statin myopathy with or without neuropathy are discussed with particular attention paid to the implications of disrupted mevalonate metabolism. For example, secondary defects in isoprenoid biosynthesis are expected to impair the production of a variety of intermediaries such as dolichols, which are crucial for N-linked glycosylation; geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, which is necessary for coenzyme Q(10) and G-protein synthesis; farnesyl-pyrophosphate, which facilitates the endoproteolytic cleavage and maturation of prelamin A and modifies B-type lamins and G-proteins; and isopentenylpyrophosphate, which is involved in a nucleoside modification of selenocysteinyl-tRNA and thus indirectly related to the synthesis of all selenoproteins (approximately 35). The nature of statin neuromyotoxicity remains unresolved; however, investigating the cellular corollaries of deranged isoprenoid metabolism may uncover clues that lead to a more complete understanding of the elusive pathophysiology.", 
    "64": "The advent of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (i.e., statins) has greatly impacted the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Statins were originally developed as lipid-lowering drugs to combat high-cholesterol and attenuate coronary artery disease. Wide-ranging clinical and basic science investigations have now suggested that statins may provide beneficial effects outside of reductions in low-density lipoprotein and triglycerides. These cholesterol-independent actions have been found to downregulate vascular inflammation and promote cardioprotection against ischemic disorders and heart failure. Mechanisms of this protection include increases in endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity and a subsequent rise in nitric oxide bioavailability. This review will encompass clinical and basic science research of statin-mediated cardiovascular protection.",

Unpublished data suggest a pharmacokinetic interaction between ezetimibe and cyclosporine that results in a significant 2.3- to 12-fold increase in exposure to total ezetimibe. An objective causality assessment in this case revealed that this supratherapeutic LDL-C reduction was probably related to coadministration of ezetimibe and cyclosporine.

In haematology, Mediterranean stomatocytosis or Mediterranean macrothrombocytopenia is a poorly understood haematological condition that combines stomatocytic haemolysis with the presence of very large platelets. Five pedigrees showing this haematology were identified. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) showed that all of the patients with this highly specific haematology had grossly elevated levels of phytosterols in the blood, diagnostic of phytosterolaemia.

Gemfibrozil treatment did not affect Vss,real of either SV or SVA. In dog hepatocytes, gemfibrozil modestly affected the formation of CYP3A-mediated oxidative metabolites (IC50 > 200 microM) and beta-oxidative products (IC5) approximately 100 microM), but markedly inhibited the glucuronidation-mediated lactonization of SVA and the glucuronidation of an SVA beta-oxidation product (IC50 = 18 microM). In in vitro dog and human liver S9 and plasma, hydrolysis of SV to SVA was much faster than that of SVA to SV. Gemfibrozil (250 microM) had a minimal inhibitory effect on the hydrolysis of either SV to SVA or SVA to SV in dog and human liver S9, but had a significant ( approximately 60%) inhibitory effect on the SV to SVA hydrolysis in both dog and human plasma.",

Treatment with gemfibrozil did not affect the distribution of SV/SVA, but rather affected the elimination of SVA and the SV/SVA interconversion processes. Gemfibrozil decreased CL20 and CL21 likely via its inhibitory effect on the glucuronidation of SVA, and not on the CYP3A-mediated oxidative metabolism of SV or SVA, the beta-oxidation of SVA, nor the SVA to SV hydrolysis. The decrease in CL12 might be due in part to the inhibitory effect of gemfibrozil on SV to SVA hydrolysis in plasma.

To evaluate the effects of another fibrate drug, fenofibrate, on the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin, 24 healthy subjects took pravastatin (40 mg once daily) on study days 1 to 15 and fenofibrate (160 mg once daily) on study days 6 to 15. Blood samples were collected for 24 hours after dosing on days 5, 6, and 15. Plasma concentrations of pravastatin and its active metabolite, 3alpha-hydroxy-iso-pravastatin, were measured, and pharmacokinetics was assessed. Safety assessments were based on adverse events, physical examinations, electrocardiogram results, vital signs, and clinical laboratory testing. Safety results were unremarkable. Coadministration of fenofibrate had modest effects on pravastatin and 3alpha-hydroxy-iso-pravastatin systemic exposures (AUC). Increases in pravastatin systemic exposures (19%-28%, on average) and 3alpha-hydroxy-iso-pravastatin systemic exposures (24%-39%, on average) were observed upon coadministration, but individual changes were variable. Pravastatin and 3alpha-hydroxy-iso-pravastatin systemic exposures were not statistically significantly different following the 1st and 10th doses of fenofibrate.", 
    "94": "The effect of rosuvastatin on warfarin pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics was assessed in 2 trials. In trial A (a randomized, double-blind, 2-period crossover study), 18 healthy volunteers were given rosuvastatin 40 mg or placebo on demand (o.d.) for 10 days with 1 dose of warfarin 25 mg on day 7. In trial B (an open-label, 2-period study), 7 patients receiving warfarin therapy with stable international normalized ratio values between 2 and 3 were coadministered rosuvastatin 10 mg o.d. for up to 14 days, which increased to rosuvastatin 80 mg if the international normalized ratio values were <3 at the end of this period. The results indicated that rosuvastatin can enhance the anticoagulant effect of warfarin. The mechanism of this drug-drug interaction is unknown. Rosuvastatin had no effect on the total plasma concentrations of the warfarin enantiomers, but the free plasma fractions of the enantiomers were not measured. Appropriate monitoring of the international normalized ratio is indicated when this drug combination is coadministered.", 
    "95": "Retinal neovascularization and macular edema are central features of diabetic retinopathy, a major cause of blindness in working age adults. The currently established treatment for diabetic retinopathy targets the vascular pathology by laser photocoagulation. This approach is associated with significant adverse effects due the destruction of neural tissue and is not always effective. Characterization of the molecular and cellular processes involved in vascular growth and hyperpermeability has led to the recognition that the angiogenic growth factor and vascular permeability factor VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) play a pivotal role in the retinal microvascular complications of diabetes. Thus, VEGF represents an important target for therapeutic intervention in diabetic retinopathy. Agents that directly inhibit the actions of VEGF and its receptors show considerable promise, but have not proven to be completely effective in blocking pathological angiogenesis. Therefore, a better understanding of the molecular events that control VEGF expression and mediate its downstream actions is important to define more precise therapeutic targets for intervention in diabetic retinopathy. This review highlights the current understanding of the process by which VEGF gene expression is regulated and how VEGF's biological effects are altered during diabetes. In particular, cellular and molecular alterations seen in diabetic models are considered in the context of high glucose-mediated oxidative stress effects on VEGF expression and action. Potential therapeutic strategies for preventing VEGF overexpression or blocking its pathological actions in the diabetic retina are considered.", 
    "96": "In diabetes, oxidative stress plays a key role in the pathogenesis of vascular complications, and an early step of such damage is considered to be the development of an endothelial dysfunction. Hyperglycemia directly promotes an endothelial dysfunction inducing process of overproduction of superoxide and consequently peroxynitrite, that damages DNA and activates the nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. This process, depleting NAD+, slowing glycolsis, ATP formation and electron transport, results in acute endothelial dysfunction in diabetic blood vessels and contributes to the development of diabetic complications. These new findings may explain why classical antioxidants, like vitamin E, that work scavenging already formed toxic oxidation products, have failed to show beneficial effects on diabetic complications, and suggest new and attractive \"causal\" antioxidant therapy. New, low molecular mass compounds that act as SOD or catalase mimetics or L-propionyl-carnitine and lipoic acid, that work as intracellular superoxide scavengers, improving mitochondrial function and reducing DNA damage, may be good candidates for such strategy, and preliminary studies support this hypothesis. This \"causal\" therapy would also be associated with other promising tools such as LY 333531, PJ34 and FP15, which block protein kinase beta isoform, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and peroxynitrite, respectively. It is now evident that, statins, ACE inhibitors, AT-1 blockers, calcium channel blockers and thiazolidinediones have a strong intracellular antioxidant activity, and it has been suggested that many of their beneficial ancillary effects are due to this property. This preventive activity against oxidative stress generation can justify a large utilization and association of this compounds for preventing complications in diabetic patients where antioxidant defences have been shown to be defective.", 
    "97": "Many hospitals have recently begun to use the direct LDL-C assay which can provide an accurate value of LDL-C concentration in serum with hyper-triglyceridemia. This may have altered diagnosis and treatment of patients with hyperlipidemia. To evaluate the influence of the use of the direct LDL-C assay, we analyzed medical data from the hospital information system. The total number of the direct LDL-C assays amounted to around 1,000 per month, while that of beta-lipoprotein fell to around 50 per month. The monthly number of patients who were treated with statin drugs did not increase: from 37.4+/-2.2 (mean+/-SD) to 37.5+/-1.3 per 1,000 outpatients (p=0.932). Also the monthly number of patients who were prescribed statin drugs for the first time remained at a similar level: from 1.6+/-0.5 to 1.3+/-0.2 per 1,000 outpatients (p=0.063). These results suggest that the determination of the LDL-C value has not significantly changed the diagnosis and treatment of patients with hyperlipidemia.", 
    "98": "The first purpose of this study was to investigate the in vivo absorption, biliary secretion, and first-pass effect of fluvastatin following regional intestinal dosing in the rat. We also examined the membrane transport mechanisms and made in silico predictions of the relative importance of various intestinal regions to the human absorption of fluvastatin. Fluvastatin was administered intravenously (2, 10, and 20 micromol/kg) and into the duodenum (1.46, 2.92, 7.32, and 14.6 micromol/kg), jejunum (14.6 micromol/kg), ileum (1.46 and 14.6 mciromol/kg), and colon (1.46 and 14.6 micromol/kg) as a solution to conscious rats. In a separate group of rats, bile was collected after an i.v. dose of fluvastatin (2 micromol/kg). In the Caco-2 model the bidirectional transport of fluvastatin (16 microM) was investigated with and without various efflux inhibitors (verapamil, vinblastine, probenecid, and indomethacin, 160 microM). The human in vivo absorption of fluvastatin from an oral immediate release tablet and that from an oral extended release tablet (both 40 mg) were simulated in GastroPlus. Neither the dose nor the intestinal region influenced the bioavailability of fluvastatin significantly. The rate of absorption was, however, affected by both the dose and the site of administration; duodenum = jejunum > colon > ileum, and higher following the high dose. Increasing the i.v. dose from 2 to 20 micromol/kg decreased the clearance (26 +/- 3 to 12 +/- 1 mL/min/kg), the hepatic extraction (66 +/- 8 to 30 +/- 2%), and the volume of distribution (7.3 +/- 0.3 to 2.1 +/- 0.7 L/kg) for fluvastatin (p < 0.05). Neither bile cannulation nor bile sampling affected the pharmacokinetics. Fluvastatin was secreted into the bile, probably by active transport. The in vitro permeability for fluvastatin was high (>10 x 10(-6) cm/s). Indomethacin, but not the other inhibitors, affected the transport in both directions suggesting mrp2 to be involved. In silico, 93% of the dose was absorbed from the small intestine and 6% from the colon when given as an immediate release formulation. The corresponding values for an extended release formulation were 21% and 74%, respectively. In conclusion, fluvastatin exhibits dose-dependent pharmacokinetics in the rat. The rate of absorption (Cmax, Tmax, and Cmax/AUC(lqc)) from the intestinal tract is both region and dose-dependent in the rat. This may be due to the involvement of mrp2 in the intestine and/or in the liver. These absorption properties have to be considered in the development of an extended release formulation of fluvastatin.", 
    "99": "Treatment with inhibitors of 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (statins) reduces the incidence of cardiovascular events, but it is unclear whether the beneficial effects are mediated solely by their lipid-lowering properties. We therefore investigated whether atorvastatin reduces inflammation and oxidative stress independently of its lipid-lowering effects. The subjects comprised 71 hyperlipidemic patients (64+/-9 years old, mean+/-SD) who were not receiving medical treatment. Serum lipid and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, and urine 8-isoprostane level (an index of oxidative stress) were measured before and after 4 weeks of treatment with atorvastatin at 10 mg/day. In 38 patients, these biochemical variables and carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) were also measured after 6 months of treatment with atorvastatin. Atorvastatin markedly reduced CRP (from 0.69+/-0.36 to 0.42+/-0.20 and 0.35+/-0.19 mg/l, median+/-median absolute deviation, P<0.0001), 8-isoprostane (from 225+/-99 to 178+/-75 and 179+/-60 ng/g creatinine, P<0.05), and low density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC; from 165+/-21 to 106+/-18 and 112+/-17 mg/dl, P<0.0001) after 4 weeks and 6 months of treatment, respectively. However, the reductions in CRP and 8-isoprostane were not correlated with those of LDLC. After 6 months of treatment, IMT was significantly decreased compared with the baseline value (from 0.94+/-0.26 to 0.90+/-0.20 mm, P<0.05), but this was not correlated with the reduction in LDLC. These results suggest that atorvastatin has beneficial effects on inflammation, oxidative stress, and the lipid profile in patients with hyperlipidemia. The extra-lipid effects are not attributable to the lipid-lowering effect of the statin, suggesting that the pleiotropic effects of atorvastatin are independent of its effects on the lipid profile.", 
    "100": "Reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with statin therapy is currently identified in treatment guidelines as the primary focus for patients with or at risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). Yet despite effective statin therapy there is still an unacceptably high residual coronary risk. A substantial proportion of patients with CHD have mixed dyslipidemia, including low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), an independent and predictive risk factor for CHD. Although effective in reducing LDL-C, statin therapy has only modest effects in raising HDL-C. Fibrate therapy is an alternative lipid-modifying strategy, and is effective in reducing CHD mortality and morbidity, with the magnitude of clinical benefit similar to statin therapy. Multi-drug therapy with complementary mechanisms of action has been proposed as a means of improving lipid-modifying efficacy. Nicotinic acid is the most potent agent for increasing HDL-C and also substantially reduces LDL-C and triglycerides. Addition of nicotinic acid to statin therapy would be a logical management approach, given the potential for complementary therapeutic benefit. The clinical benefits of this combination are supported by the results of the HDL Atherosclerosis Treatment Study, which showed reduction of 60-90% in the incidence of major coronary events when both agents were administered. In addition, combination treatment led to angiographic regression of stenosis, compared with placebo, rather than slowed progression as previously reported with statin monotherapy. Given that the prevalence of low HDL-C, particularly amongst individuals with CHD, is higher than previously anticipated, combining nicotinic acid and a statin represents an innovative approach to further reducing CHD risk.", 
    "101": "An important issue in atherosclerosis is the timing of intimal microvascular formation and its relation to the initiation of plaque formation. Monocytes and endothelial cells (ECs) are important cell components in these steps. Statins not only reduce atherogenic low density lipoprotein cholesterol, they also increase high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL). Although a higher concentration of statin has an anti-proliferative effect, HDL is potentially mitogenic. Therefore, we examined the opposing effects of statin, Apo-AI, HDL and HDL fractions on cell proliferation and apoptosis in monocytes and on angiogenesis in ECs. A high concentration of simvastatin inhibited monocyte proliferation as evaluated by counting cell numbers using a hematocytometer. This inhibition was mainly blocked by the HDL3 subfraction. The same concentration of simvastatin induced apoptosis as assessed by the fluorescence-labeled annexin-V method through caspase-3 activation in monocytes. HDL inhibited simvastatin-induced apoptosis. In addition, HDL blocked simvastatin-inhibited angiogenesis in an in vitro model of EC tube formation. In conclusion, the compensatory balance between the effects of statin and HDL may play an important role in the formation of atherosclerotic lesions by affecting proliferation and apoptosis in monocytes and angiogenesis in ECs.", 
    "102": "We studied the combined treatment effects of quinapril and atorvastatin on blood pressure and structure and function of resistance arteries from adult spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY rats). Apoptotic cells were identified by in situ end labeling using the terminal deoxynucleotide transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling method. Vascular structure was measured using a morphometric protocol and confocal microscopy and a pressurized artery system was used to study vascular functions. We found that a combined treatment with quinapril and atorvastatin lowered systolic blood pressure in both adult SHR and WKY rats and decreased medial thickness and volume and the number of smooth muscle cell layers in mesenteric arteries, as well as media-to-lumen ratio in the interlobular arteries from SHR but not in those from WKY rats. The number of apoptotic smooth muscle cells was higher in the mesenteric arteries from control WKY rats than control SHR and treatment increased the number of apoptotic smooth muscle cells in the arteries from both SHR and WKY rats. Treatment with quinapril and atorvastatin reduced ventricular weight in SHR and normalized the augmented contractile responses to norepinephrine but did not alter the contraction to electric field stimulation. Relaxation responses to acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside were not affected by the treatment. We conclude that a combined treatment with quinapril and atorvastatin lowered blood pressure and improved cardiac and vessel hypertrophy and vessel function. An increase in apoptotic smooth muscle cells may be one of the mechanisms underlying the structural improvement.", 
    "103": "Statins exert beneficial effects in brain diseases including stroke. Here, we investigated whether oral prophylactic atorvastatin provides long-term neuroprotection and functional recovery in permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO), and whether cerebral hemodynamics are affected. Male Long-Evans rats were treated with 10 mg/kg oral atorvastatin for 14 days and subjected to pMCAO. Cerebral hemodynamics were measured by bolus tracking MRI and laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF). Infarct volume was quantified at 1 week by T2-MRI and at 3 weeks by histology. Rats were also subjected to neuroscoring and cylinder test. The number of animals per group was 10. The infarct volumes were 100.8 +/- 8.2 and 47.3 +/- 5.5 mm(3) in vehicle, and 68.7 +/- 11.0 and 28.6 +/- 3.82 mm(3) in atorvastatin group at 7 and 21 days post-ischemia, respectively (mean +/- SEM). Atorvastatin significantly reduced infarct volume both at 7 and 21 days (P = 0.04 and 0.03, respectively, 1-way ANOVA). Interestingly, no improvement in cerebral hemodynamic parameters was observed in atorvastatin treated animals. The vehicle group recovered normal neuroscore at day 13, whereas atorvastatin group recovered already at day 10 after pMCAO. All treatment groups preferred to use the unaffected forelimb for rearing in Cylinder test, whereas the defected forelimb use was minimal in all groups. These results suggest that oral atorvastatin protects cerebral tissue against the subsequent pMCAO without influencing cerebral hemodynamic parameters, and it may well be that persons with ongoing atorvastatin treatment benefit in the incidence of stroke.", 
    "104": "It is known that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) enhance the expression- of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and lower the level of LDL cholesterol in the blood. But, a triglyceride (TG)-lowering effect is also observed during their administration. To clarify the possibility that statins enhance LPL activity and its mechanism, the effects of statins on the expression of LPL in adipocytes were studied. When statins (pravastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin and pitavastatin) were added to the culture medium of mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes at final concentrations of 1 microM for 3 days, LPL activity increased. Pitavastatin increased the activity the most. Western and Northern blotting showed that LPL protein and m-RNA were strongly expressed on the addition of pitavastatin. With the addition of mevalonate (10 microM, 3 days), LPL activity weakened significantly. Statins, especially pitavastatin, increased the expression of LPL in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. The TG-lowering effect of pitavastatin might be mediated by enhancement of LPL production in adipocytes.", 
    "105": "We reported previously that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (RIs) suppressed in vitro oxidized-low density lipoprotein-induced macrophage growth. To elucidate whether HMG-CoA RIs have anti-atherogenic effects separate from their cholesterol-lowering effect, total plasma levels of cholesterol in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (type 2 DM) and hypercholesterolemia were reduced to normal by one-year treatment with HMG-CoA RIs and intimal-medial thickness (IMT) of the common carotid arteries (CCA) was measured. Patients with type 2 DM and hypercholesterolemia received either pravastatin (n = 15) or simvastatin (n = 15), while another group of type 2 DM patients with normocholesterolemia did not receive these agents. IMT of the CCA was measured using Powervision SSA-370A, probe 7.5 Mhz. The mean IMT and the rate of increase of IMT were relatively elevated in the order of the simvastatin-treatment group, pravastatin-treatment group, and control group. Our results suggested that HMG-CoA RIs might have anti-atherogenic effects in addition to their cholesterol-lowering effect.", 
    "106": "The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) are the most effective drugs for hypercholesteloremia. However, a significant side effect of statin treatment is rhabdomyolysis. In order to study the effect of statins in skeletal muscle cells, we used a DNA microarray analysis to investigate the changes in gene expression profiles brought about by statins in two skeletal muscle cell lines, namely, differentiated rat L6 myotubes and a human skeletal muscle cell line (hSkMC). In both cell lines, the statins (atorvastatin, cerivastatin and pitavastatin) induced the expression of four genes, which relate to cholesterol metabolism, namely, HMG-CoA synthase 1, HMG-CoA reductase, farnesyl diphosphate synthase and isopentenyl-diphosphate delta isomerase. Statin inhibited the synthesis of cholesterol at least five times more effectively in hSkMCs than in the hepatocytes. In addition, unlike in osteoblasts or coronary artery smooth muscle cells, statins upregulated the mRNA expression of cholesterol-associated enzymes in hSkMCs. These results provide basic information on skeletal muscle cells treated with statins and indicate that the cells are sensitive to the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, which may be related to the pathogenesis of muscle damage in statin therapy.",

To test this hypothesis, we screened 30 5- to 6-month-old beta-myosin heavy chain Q403 transgenic rabbits by echocardiography and selected 26 without cardiac hypertrophy. We randomized the transgenic rabbits to treatment with atorvastatin (2.5 mg/Kg/d), known to block hypertrophic signaling or a placebo. We included 15 nontransgenic rabbits as controls. Cardiac phenotype was analyzed serially before, 6 and 12 months after randomization. Serum total cholesterol levels were reduced by 49% with atorvastatin administration. Left-ventricular mass, wall thickness; myocyte size, myocardial levels of molecular markers of hypertrophy, lipid peroxides, and oxidized mitochondrial DNA; and the number of terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling (TUNEL)-positive myocytes were increased significantly in the placebo but not in the atorvastatin group. Myocardium catalase mRNA levels were decreased by 5-fold in the placebo but were normal in the atorvastatin group. Catalase protein level and activity were not significantly changed. Levels of membrane-bound Ras and phospho-p44/42 mitogen-activated-protein kinase (MAPK) were increased in the placebo group (approximately 2.5 fold) but were reduced in the atorvastatin group. Levels of GTP- and membrane-bound RhoA and Rac1, phospho-p38, and phospho-c-Jun NH2-terminal kinases were unchanged. Thus, atorvastatin prevented development of cardiac hypertrophy; determined at organ, cellular, and molecular levels, partly through reducing active Ras and p44/42 MAPK. The results indicate potential beneficial effects of atorvastatin in prevention of cardiac hypertrophy, a major determinant of morbidity in all forms of cardiovascular diseases, and beckon clinical studies in humans with HCM.",

Despite well-publicized guidelines and the availability of potentially effective therapies, many patients do not achieve their lipid goals and remain at high risk for cardiac events because of poor adherence. To assess adherence to statin therapy based on an analysis of pharmacy records, the records of 562 patients were screened. A washout rule, designed to ensure that only new medication starts were analyzed, resulted in the inclusion of 140 records in this study. Dates of prescription fillings, drug name and strength, quantity dispensed, and the number of days supplied were recorded. Length of therapy, persistence, medication possession ratio (MPR), and median gap between prescriptions were calculated. Overall persistence declined from 56% at 9 months to 35% at 12 months. Persistence at the study end point was 34% for men, 18% for women, 19% for patients younger than 65 years, and 41% for patients aged 65 years and older. The median number of gap days between prescription refills was 6.83 for all patients and was approximately 7 days longer for women than for men. The number of gap days differed only slightly for patients younger than 65 years compared with patients aged 65 years or older (6.44 vs 7.41, respectively). MPRs ranged from 0.64 to 0.56, with no substantive between-group differences. Among the statins used most often in this study, persistence was highest with atorvastatin (36%) compared with simvastatin (26%) and pravastatin (5%).

    "121": "This article is a review of the scientific literature with respect to fine particulate matter (PM), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, and coronary artery disease (CAD). The association between air pollution and respiratory diseases has been extensively investigated for decades; however, the role of air pollution in exacerbating heart disease has only recently become a focus of attention. It has been shown that for every 10-microg/m(3) increase in fine PM in the air, there appears to be a 2.1% increase in the number of deaths related to ischemic heart disease. PM has been linked to increased levels of systemic inflammation biomarkers such as C-reactive proteins (CRP). Daily variation of ambient pollution is correlated with rises and falls in CRP levels. Increased CRP levels have been associated with increased morbidity and mortality in individuals with CAD. Seventy-five percent of patients with elevated CRP levels have reportedly experienced a major cardiac event despite low-density lipoproteins (LDL) levels that were below the threshold recommended for pharmacological intervention. HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have been shown to cause a reduction in coronary events by lowering LDL levels. However, recently it has been shown that statins have the effect of lowering CRP levels. This may explain why individuals with normal lipid levels may benefit from statin therapy. Ambient PM exposure levels and its effects on CRP are risk factors associated with coronary events and should be considered as a target for the treatment of CAD.", 
    "122": "The ability of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) to promote cholesterol efflux is thought to be important in its protection against cardiovascular disease. Anti-inflammatory properties of HDL have emerged as additional properties that may also be important. HDL appears to have evolved as part of the innate immune system functioning to inhibit inflammation in the absence of an acute phase response (APR) but functioning to increase inflammation in the presence of an APR. Inbred strains of mice that are genetically susceptible to atherosclerosis have pro-inflammatory HDL, while inbred strains that are resistant to atherosclerosis have anti-inflammatory HDL. In one small study, humans with coronary heart disease (CHD) or CHD equivalents had pro-inflammatory HDL prior to statin therapy and about half continued to have pro-inflammatory HDL after statin therapy despite a profound decrease in plasma lipids. Pro-inflammatory HDL was relatively weak in its ability to promote cholesterol efflux while anti-inflammatory HDL was better in promoting cholesterol efflux. In other studies, oxidative alterations of the major protein of HDL, apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I), impaired the ability of the apoA-I to promote cholesterol efflux. Thus, HDL structure and function may be more important than HDL-cholesterol levels in predicting risk for cardiovascular disease.",

    "126": "Although sirolimus stimulates TF protein expression in human SMC associated with inhibition of mTOR, it does not enhance TF activity released from the cells, suggesting a relatively safe profile of CYPHER stents. The inhibition of TF expression by fluvastatin favors clinical use of statins in patients undergoing coronary stenting.", 
    "127": "Nicotinic acid has, like the Roman God Janus, two faces. One is the vitamin. The other is the broad-spectrum lipid drug. The Canadian pathologist Rudolf Altschul discovered 50 years ago that nicotinic acid in gram doses lowered plasma levels of cholesterol. From the point of view of treatment of the dyslipidaemias that are risk factors for clinical atherosclerosis nicotinic acid is a miracle drug. It lowers the levels of all atherogenic lipoproteins--VLDL and LDL with subclasses as well as Lp(a)--and in addition it raises more than any other drug the levels of the protective HDL lipoproteins. Trials have shown that treatment with nicotinic acid reduces progression of atherosclerosis, and clinical events and mortality from coronary heart disease. The new combination treatment with statin-lowering LDL and nicotinic acid-raising HDL is reviewed. A basic effect of nicotinic acid is the inhibition of fat-mobilizing lipolysis in adipose tissue leading to a lowering of plasma free fatty acids, which has many metabolic implications which are reviewed. The very recent discovery of a nicotinic acid receptor and the finding that the drug stimulates the expression of the ABCA 1 membrane cholesterol transporter have paved the way for exciting and promising new 50 years in the history of nicotinic acid.", 
    "128": "Observational studies have shown that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin) use may be associated with reduced cancer risk. The purpose of this case-control study was to elucidate the association between statin use and prostate cancer risk. Prostate cancer cases (n = 100), recruited upon referral for prostate biopsy, and frequency age-matched, prostate-specific antigen-normal clinic controls (n = 202) were recruited from the Portland, Oregon, Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Information on any use of statins from May 1997 through August 2004 was obtained from an electronic pharmacy database. Days of use, type of statin, dose, and prescription changes were recorded. Duration and intensity were calculated for each statin type on the basis of days of use and prescribed dose. Thirty-six percent of cases and 49 percent of controls had a record of any statin use. Following adjustment for other potential risk factors, statin use was associated with a significant reduction in prostate cancer risk (odds ratio = 0.38, 95% confidence interval: 0.21, 0.69). Furthermore, in analyses stratified by Gleason score, the inverse association with statin use was maintained only among men with Gleason scores of > or =7 (odds ratio = 0.24, 95% confidence interval: 0.11, 0.53). The results of this case-control study suggest that statins may reduce the risk of total prostate cancer and, specifically, more aggressive prostate cancer.", 
    "129": "Atorvastatin reduces both plasma cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations in patients with type 2 diabetes, but mechanisms underlying triglyceride decrease and the effect of atorvastatin on high density lipoprotein (HDL) still remain unclear. Apolipoprotein (apo) E plays a crucial role in modulating production and clearance of triglyceride-rich very low density lipoprotein (VLDL). The main effect of apoAI is to modulate HDL metabolism. The aim of this work was to study the influence of atorvastatin on apoAI and apoE kinetics and to determine whether its hypocholesterolemic and hypotriglyceridemic effects could be related to changes in this apolipoprotein metabolism. Plasma VLDL-apoE, HDL-apoE, and HDL-apoAI were studied in seven patients with diabetes with mixed hyperlipidemia using a stable isotope labeling technique ([(2)H3]leucine-primed constant infusion) and monocompartmental model before and after 2 months of treatment with 40 mg/day of atorvastatin. Plasma apoE concentration was significantly reduced (44.1 +/- 19.1 versus 32 +/- 11.6 mg/l, p < 0.05) after treatment. This decrease was associated with a diminution of HDL-apoE concentration (17.46 +/- 6.71 versus 13.37 +/- 6.05 mg/l, p < 0.05) and production rate (0.202 +/- 0.085 versus 0.119 +/- 0.047 mg/kg/day, p < 0.05), whereas an increase in VLDL-apoE concentration (6.44 +/- 2.16 before versus 9.23 +/- 4.02 mg/l after, p < 0.05) and production rate (0.827 +/- 0.367 versus 1.524 +/- 0.664 mg/kg/day, p < 0.05) was observed. No significant difference was observed after treatment for apoAI parameters. We conclude that atorvastatin treatment promotes different apoE distribution between HDL and VLDL, favoring VLDL apoE content. The increased number of apoE per VLDL particle suggests that atorvastatin could enhance the direct catabolism of triglyceride-rich VLDL through apoE receptor pathways.", 
    "130": "Leptin may play an important role in the development of atherosclerosis. We evaluated the effect of atorvastatin on leptin secretion in vivo and in vitro.", 
    "131": "Sixteen rabbits fed with high-cholesterol diet for 8 weeks were randomly divided into 2 groups: (1) high cholesterol diet for 6 weeks (n=8), and (2) the same cholesterol diet plus atorvastatin (2.5 mg/kg/day) for 6 weeks (n=8). A control group (n=5) was fed with normal diet for 14 weeks. Subcutaneous adipose was collected for RNA analysis. The direct effect of atorvastatin on leptin release was assayed in primary rabbit adipocytes. Leptin levels in serum and adipocytes culture supernatant were measured by ELISA. RT-PCR was used to evaluate leptin mRNA expressions in adipose and adipocytes.", 
    "132": "Compared with control group, rabbits fed with high cholesterol diet showed higher levels of serum total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and leptin, all of which were significantly reduced by atorvastatin treatment. Leptin mRNA expression of adipose was significant lower in rabbits treated with atorvastatin than those fed with high cholesterol diet continuously (0.81+/-0.31 vs. 1.23+/-0.36, P<0.05). Atorvastatin dose-dependently inhibited leptin secretion and mRNA expression in cultured adipocytes.", 
    "133": "Atorvastatin can inhibit leptin release and mRNA expression, and reduces serum leptin level in hypercholesterolemic rabbits.", 
    "134": "Although angiotensin receptor antagonists and 3-hydroxy-3-methylgultaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) have been shown to attenuate proteinuria individually, it remains unclear whether proteinuria may be additionally improved by statin therapy in well-controlled hypertensive patients treated with angiotensin receptor antagonists-based regimen and whether withdrawal of chronic statin treatment may abrogate this beneficial effect in normolipidemic patients.", 
    "135": "A total of consecutive 82 proteinuric patients treated with antihypertensive agents, including losartan, were randomized 10 mg of pravastatin or placebo with a 6-month treatment. After completing 6 months of drug treatment, the pravastatin-treated patients were randomly assigned to continue (N= 19) or withdraw (N= 17) pravastatin for a further 6 months.", 
    "136": "Subjects treated with pravastatin had significant further improvement of proteinuria at 6 months compared with placebo group (559 +/- 251 mg/24 hours vs. 1262 +/- 557 mg/24 hours) (P < 0.0001). Of 17 patients assigned to withdraw pravastatin, proteinuria returned to the pretreatment levels and was significantly higher than those who continued treatment. Multivariate analysis revealed that proteinuric improvement was significantly correlated with the continuous statin use. Urinary excretion of endothelin-1 (ET-1) is decreased in pravastatin-treated patients, but withdrawal of statin resulted in 27% up-regulation. The linear regression models in the initial statin-treated group showed that changes in urinary ET-1 correlated with urinary protein excretion (r= 0.83, P < 0.0001).", 
    "137": "We conclude that pravastatin administration is associated with improved proteinuria probably by inhibiting urine ET-1 levels in patients with losartan-based treatment. However, statin withdrawal abrogates this beneficial effect in patients initially responsive to this therapy.", 
    "138": "Despite statin therapy being effective in the primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease, the benefit of treatment varies between individuals. Interindividual variations in pharmacokinetics play a central role in the cause of variability of drug disposition, and, in turn, the drug's clinical efficacy. Exploring genetic variations that influence pharmacokinetics may lead clinicians to apply the most efficient and safe drug therapy. So far, variants in eight candidate genes related to pharmacokinetics of statins have been investigated as the potential determinant of drug responsiveness or adverse event risk. All reported data remains inconclusive, but it has been suggested that combined analysis of more than two different polymorphisms, or a combination of genetic association and studies using in vitro recombinant expression techniques, may be more informative in predicting the specific phenotype of a genetic variant. Future studies using these approaches could provide more striking evidence, which may be sufficient to justify genetic analysis regarding pharmacokinetic variants in the clinical practice of statin therapy.", 
    "139": "The antiplatelet potency of clopidogrel may be attenuated by short-term co-administration of lipophilic statins metabolized through the cytochrome P-450, isoform 3A4. We investigated whether the co-administration of atorvastatin (20?mg/day) for 5 weeks, in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) could affect the antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel. Fifty-one patients with the first episode of an ACS were included in the study. All patients underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and received a loading dose of 375 mg of clopidogrel, followed by 75 mg/day for at least 3 months. Twenty-six of them presented with low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels >100?mg/dl (2.6 mmol/l) (measured within 24 h from the onset of symptoms) and received daily 20 mg/day of atorvastatin. The ADP- or TRAP-induced platelet aggregation, as well as P-selectin and CD40L surface expression, were studied at baseline (within 30 min after admission) and 5 weeks afterwards. Atorvastatin did not influence either the clopidogrel-induced inhibition of platelet aggregation initiated by 5 or 10 microM ADP or the clopidogrel-induced reduction of the membrane expression of P-selectin and CD40L induced by ADP. In conclusion, atorvastatin, even at a dose of 20 mg/day does not affect the antiplatelet efficacy of clopidogrel when co-administered for 5 weeks in ACS patients.", 
    "140": "This letter to the editor discusses the results of the recently published study by Smith et al. which demonstrated that lipophilic statins metabolized through the cytochrome P--450 isoform 3A4 (CYP3A4) do not influence the antiplatelet effectiveness of clopidogrel in patients undergoing elective percutaneous coronary intervention. These results as well as those of other recent studies suggest that there is no adverse interaction between clopidogrel and CYP3A4-metabolized statins, during the maintenance phase of therapy (i.e., 2 or more days after the drug co-administration) either at the platelet or at the clinical level.", 
    "141": "Recent studies have reported that statins, inhibitors of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, increase bone formation in osteoblasts in vitro, suggesting that statins may have a new therapeutic application in the treatment of osteoporosis. During the reparative phase of healing of bone fractures, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells differentiate into osteoblasts or chondrocytes to form callus. If statins also stimulate bone formation in bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells they may have beneficial effects in the treatment of bone fractures. In this study, we assessed the effect of statins on bone formation in rat bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells in vitro. The statins fluvastatin, simvastatin and pravastatin did not significantly enhance mineralization, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and bone gra protein (BGP, osteocalcin). These findings suggest that statins do not increase bone formation in bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells.", 
    "142": "Clinical trials have demonstrated that risk of cardiovascular events may be reduced in patients with stroke, using blood pressure (BP) reduction and statin therapy, independently of the presence of specific risk factors. These results suggest an alternative approach to secondary stroke prevention, focused more on global risk than on detection and modification of individual categorical risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes mellitus. A risk-based approach is warranted because stroke patients are at high risk of several cardiovascular events, not just stroke, and because physiologic risk factors such as BP demonstrate a continuous, or log-linear, relationship with cardiovascular risk. Essential to the implementation of such an approach is the development of adequate risk stratification models for stroke patients. Based on limited available evidence, however, it appears that most patients who experience an ischemic stroke or TIA are at high long-term absolute risk of a subsequent cardiovascular event and should be treated with all available risk-reduction strategies.", 
    "143": "Women have been underrepresented in statin trials, and few data exist on the effectiveness and safety of statins in this gender. We used sequential electron-beam tomography (EBT) scanning to quantify changes in coronary artery calcium (CAC) as a measure of atherosclerosis burden in patients treated with statins.", 
    "144": "In a double-blind, multicenter trial, we randomized 615 hyperlipidemic, postmenopausal women to intensive (atorvastatin 80 mg/d) and moderate (pravastatin 40 mg/d) lipid-lowering therapy. Patients also submitted to 2 EBT scans at a 12-month interval (mean interval 344+/-55 days) to measure percent change in total and single-artery calcium volume score (CVS) from baseline. Of the 615 randomized women, 475 completed the study. Mean+/-SD percent LDL reductions were 46.6%+/-19.9% and 24.5%+/-18.5 in the intensive and moderate treatment arms, respectively (P<0.0001), and National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III LDL goal was reached in 85.3% and 58.8% of women, respectively (P<0.0001). The total CVS% change was similar in the 2 treatment groups (median 15.1% and 14.3%, respectively; P=NS), and single-artery CVS% changes and absolute changes were also similar (P=NS). In both arms, there was a trend toward a greater CVS progression in patients with prior cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, whereas hormone replacement therapy had no effect on progression.", 
    "145": "In postmenopausal women, intensive statin therapy for 1 year caused a greater LDL reduction than moderate therapy but did not result in less progression of coronary calcification. The limitations of this study (too short a follow-up period and the absence of a placebo group) precluded determination of whether progression of CVS was slowed in both arms or neither arm compared with the natural history of the disease.",

    "147": "We evaluated 137 patients with HF and an EF > or =0.50. The effect of treatment received at study entry on survival was determined. During a follow-up of 21+/-12 months, 20 deaths were observed. Treatment with an ACE inhibitor or receptor blocker, beta-blocker, or calcium blocker had no significant effect on survival. In contrast, treatment with a statin was associated with a substantial improvement in survival (relative risk of death [95% CI] 0.22 [0.07 to 0.64]; P=0.006). Patients receiving statins had higher baseline LDL cholesterol than those not receiving statins (153+/-45 versus 98+/-33 mg/dL, P<0.01). After statin therapy, LDL cholesterol levels fell to a similar level (101+/-32 mg/dL) as in patients not receiving statins (98+/-33 mg/dL). After adjustment for differences in baseline clinical variables between groups (hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, and serum creatinine), statin therapy was associated with lower mortality (adjusted relative risk of death [95% CI] 0.20 [0.06 to 0.62]; P=0.005). Similarly, after propensity matching, statin therapy was associated with improved survival (log-rank 6.12; P=0.013) and a trend toward improved survival without cardiovascular hospitalization (log-rank 3.02; P=0.082).",

    "159": "After recent clinical trials, statins have gained increasing significance in secondary stroke prevention. From experimental studies, it is well established that statins have beneficial action when delivered prophylactically prior to a stroke. Conversely, much less is known about the effects of statins on injury development when delivered after ischemia. We here examined the effects of a post-ischemic delivery of rosuvastatin (0.5, 5 or 20 mg/kg, administered i.p. immediately after reperfusion onset), a potent 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, on brain injury and cell signaling after focal cerebral ischemia, induced by 90 min of intraluminal middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice. In animals receiving normal saline, 0.5 or 5 mg/kg rosuvastatin, middle cerebral artery occlusions resulted in reproducible brain infarcts at 24 h after reperfusion onset, which did not differ in size. However, rosuvastatin, administered at higher doses (20 mg/kg), reduced infarct volume at 24 and 48 h after ischemia (by 34+/-16% and 18+/-3%, respectively, P<0.05). Western blots revealed that rosuvastatin decreased phosphorylated extracellular-regulated kinase-1/-2 and reduced activated caspase-3 levels in ischemic brain areas, while endothelial NO synthase expression, p38 and Jun kinase phosphorylation were not influenced by the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor. Rosuvastatin also significantly diminished expression levels of inducible NO synthase in the ischemic brain. Our results indicate that rosuvastatin may have utility not only as stroke prophylaxis but also as acute therapy inhibiting executive cell death pathways."
