    "1": "In 2006, electronic medical record data were screened at 11 practices (49 GPs; 58857 patients). 1653 T2DM patients cared for in general practice were identified. Ethnicity was defined as self-reported country of birth. Chi-squared tests, one-way ANOVAs, multiple regression, linear mixed effect models and generalized linear mixed models were used.", 
    "2": "Diabetes was diagnosed at a younger age in patients from the ethnic minority groups (South Asians (SA): mean age 44.9 years, Middle East/North Africa (MENA): 47.2 years, East Asians (EA): 52.0 years, others: 49.0 years) compared with Norwegians (59.7 years, p < 0.001). HbA1c, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and s-cholesterol were measured in >85% of patients in all groups with minor differences between minority groups and Norwegians. A greater proportion of the minority groups were prescribed hypoglycaemic medications compared with Norwegians (>or=79% vs. 72%, p < 0.001). After adjusting for age, gender, diabetes duration, practice and physician unit, HbA1c (geometric mean) for Norwegians was 6.9% compared to 7.3-7.5% in the minority groups (p < 0.05). The proportion with poor glycaemic control (HbA1c > 9%) was higher in minority groups (SA: 19.6%, MENA: 18.9% vs. Norwegians: 5.6%, p < 0.001. No significant ethnic differences were found in the proportions reaching the combined target: HbA1c <or= 7.5%, SBP <or= 140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) <or= 85 mmHg and total s-cholesterol <or=5.0 mmol/L (Norwegians: 25.5%, SA: 24.9%, MENA: 26.9%, EA: 26.1%, others:17.5%).", 
    "3": "Mean age at the time of diagnosis of T2DM was 8-15 years younger in minority groups compared with Norwegians. Recording of important processes of care measures is high in all groups. Only one in four of most patient groups achieved all four treatment targets and prescribing habits may be sub-optimal. Patients from minority groups have worse glycaemic control than Norwegians which implies that it might be necessary to improve the guidelines to meet the needs of specific ethnic groups.", 
    "4": "The effect of statin treatment on glucose metabolism and the risk of diabetes remains an issue of controversy. Since statins are drugs commonly prescribed for the prevention of cardiovascular disease even in patients with prediabetes or diabetes, it is of great importance to identify the role of statin treatment on glucose homeostasis. In this review, we have scrutinized available data with regard to the effect of every drug of the class on glycemic outcomes. Experimental data describing mechanisms through which these drugs potentially modify the metabolism of carbohydrates have been described. In order to identify statins which may be preferentially used to improve parameters of glycemic control, studies comparing different agents of this class as to their effect on glucose homeostasis have been discussed. According to experimental studies statin lipophilicity as well as the potential to inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase should be regarded as prognostic factors of an adverse impact of statin treatment on carbohydrate metabolism. On the other hand, the hypotriglyceridemic capacity, the endothelial-dependent increase in pancreatic islet blood flow, the anti-inflammatory properties along with the capacity of statins to alter circulating levels of several adipokines known to affect glucose homeostasis, including adiponectin, leptin, visfatin and resistin, may beneficially alter glycemic status. In clinical trials, a beneficial, neutral or adverse impact on glycemic control of different populations has been ascribed to various statins. From all drugs of the class pravastatin seems to beneficially affect glucose metabolism and decrease the risk of diabetes. Controversial findings have come to the fore with regard to other statins commonly prescribed in the clinical setting, including rosuvastatin, atorvastatin and simvastatin. More data are needed to clarify the exact role of lovastatin, fluvastatin and the newest statin pitavastatin on carbohydrate metabolism. Comparison trials suggest a potential preferable effect of the hydrophilic statins pravastatin, rosuvastatin and pitavastatin as compared to lipophilic components of the class, including atorvastatin and simvastatin.", 
    "5": "Statins are an essential part of the management of patients at high vascular risk and are generally well-tolerated. However, statin intolerance will be observed more frequently as more stringent low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) targets are pursued in an ever increasing number of patients. We review the management options for high-risk patients intolerant to statin treatment. Potential strategies include switching to a different statin, reducing the frequency of statin administration, substituting statins with other LDL-C-lowering agents (e.g. ezetimibe, colesevelam or nicotinic acid) and combining low-dose statin treatment with other lipid-modifying drugs. A limited number of studies specifically assessed statin-intolerant patients and most were small and of short duration. It is therefore difficult to make evidence-based recommendations for the management of this population. In addition, all treatment options have limitations in terms of safety and/or efficacy.", 
    "6": "Pulse wave velocity (PWV) is a method to estimate arterial stiffness. Statins have been shown to improve the compliance of the vasculature. We present the available data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effect of statin administration on arterial stiffness by measuring PWV.", 
    "7": "We considered all RCTs evaluating PWV following the administration of statins. We searched PubMed up to July 2009. Information regarding the author, journal, year of publication, randomization method, participant characteristics, treatment intervention, PWV assessment, and outcome were recorded independently by two investigators.", 
    "8": "We found 9 eligible studies with 471 participants. The most frequent comparison was between fluvastatin against placebo, and the most extensively studied agent was also fluvastatin (n = 4 trials, total population = 240). The most frequent indication for statin therapy was hyperlipidaemia (n = 6), with or without other cardiovascular risk factors. Aortic PWV, which is considered to be the most appropriate method for PWV evaluation, was assessed in 4 studies, with significant reduction (improvement of arterial stiffness) in 2 studies, a non-significant change in one study and a significant increase in the other. Peripheral (mainly brachial-ankle) PWV was assessed in the other 5 studies with significant reduction in all except the one multi-arm study where only fluvastatin improved PWV.",

Ophthalmologic evaluation, including fundus photography and fluorescein angiography, was performed at presentation and repeated at 3, 6, and 12 months. Hard exudates, hemorrhages, and fluorescein leakage at 12 months were evaluated and compared with baseline findings.", 
    "12": "Eighteen subjects with diabetic maculopathy received atorvastatin, and a significant decrease in total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was seen (P < .05). Hard exudates and fluorescein leakage were decreased. No evidence of an association between change in hemorrhage status and treatment was found.", 
    "13": "Oral atorvastatin therapy in patients with diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia seems to reduce the severity of hard exudates and fluorescein leakage in diabetic maculopathy and could be useful as an adjuvant therapy in the management of diabetic macular edema.", 
    "14": "Statins, which are used as cholesterol-lowering agents, have pleiotropic immunomodulatory properties. Although beneficial effects of statins have been reported in autoimmune diseases, the mechanisms of these immunomodulatory effects are still poorly understood. Type I interferons (IFNs) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDCs) represent key molecular and cellular pathogenic components in autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Therefore, PDCs may be a specific target of statins in therapeutic strategies against SLE. This study was undertaken to investigate the immunomodulatory mechanisms of statins that target the IFN response in PDCs.", 
    "15": "We isolated human blood PDCs by flow cytometry and examined the effects of simvastatin and pitavastatin on PDC activation, IFNalpha production, and intracellular signaling.", 
    "16": "Statins inhibited IFNalpha production profoundly and tumor necrosis factor alpha production modestly in human PDCs in response to Toll-like receptor ligands. The inhibitory effect on IFNalpha production was reversed by geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate and was mimicked by either geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor or Rho kinase inhibitor, suggesting that statins exert their inhibitory actions through geranylgeranylated Rho inactivation. Statins inhibited the expression of phosphorylated p38 MAPK and Akt, and the inhibitory effect on the IFN response was through the prevention of nuclear translocation of IFN regulatory factor 7. In addition, statins had an inhibitory effect on both IFNalpha production by PDCs from SLE patients and SLE serum-induced IFNalpha production.",

    "20": "Thirty-nine Primary APS and 57 secondary APS were included. The groups did not differ regarding age (38.5 +/- 9.9 vs. 39.4 +/- 10.5 years, p=0.84) and female gender (84.6 vs. 96.5%, p=0.06), respectively. Arterial events were more observed in primary than secondary APS (59 vs. 36.8%, p=0.04) patients. No difference was seen concerning venous and obstetric events. In regard to traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease, both groups were comparable related to current or previous smoking, sedentarism, family history for coronary disease, systemic hypertension, diabetes mellitus, overweight and obesity. The frequencies of altered lipid profiles were alike in the two groups, except for a higher prevalence of low HDL-c levels in primary APS group (84.6 vs. 45.5%, p=0.0001). Concerning drug use, no significant differences were observed related to chloroquine and statin use, however the secondary APS patients had a higher rate of prednisone use (10.2 vs. 57.9%, p<0.001) as well as mean dose of corticosteroid (1.5 +/- 5.7 vs. 9.2 +/- 12.5mg/ /day, p=0.0001).",

    "22": "Higher rate of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) shocks has been associated with increased mortality and morbidity. The aim of our study was to determine whether statins reduced the intensity rate of appropriate shock therapy for ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation in patients with an ICD placed for left ventricular systolic dysfunction. In this retrospective single center analysis, patients with an ejection fraction <or=35% who underwent ICD implantation were divided into treatment and control groups based on statin use. A zero-inflated negative binomial model was used to compare the intensity rate of appropriate ICD shocks between the 2 groups. Characteristics associated with shock-free follow-up were assessed using a stepwise logistic regression model. We found 699 patients eligible for inclusion, with 412 (59%) in the statin treatment group. The adjusted mean intensity rate of shocks was lower in patients on statin therapy (intensity rate ratio = 0.22; 95% confidence interval, 0.12-0.41; P < 0.001). Statin use was associated with a significantly higher probability of shock-free follow-up (odds ratio = 1.64; 95% confidence interval, 1.09-2.48; P = 0.019). In conclusion, statins reduced the intensity rate of appropriate shock therapy for ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation and increased probability of shock-free follow-up in patients with cardiomyopathy. Larger randomized trials are needed to confirm this relationship.", 
    "23": "The aim of this study was to determine whether the addition of ezetimibe to ongoing statin therapy in patients with atherosclerosis and metabolic syndrome would favorably affect levels of inflammatory markers and adipokines. Individuals with the metabolic syndrome exhibit higher levels of inflammatory biomarkers and adipokines, which have been implicated in the pathobiology of cardiovascular risk. The impact of the addition of ezetimibe to statin therapy on these proinflammatory mediators is unclear. Fifty patients with metabolic syndrome and concomitant vascular disease receiving stable statin monotherapy, with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels >77.4 mg/dL (>2.0 mM), were treated with ezetimibe 10 mg per day for 12 weeks. The primary study end point was the % change in adiponectin levels from baseline to 12 weeks. Secondary study end points included % changes in the levels of other circulating inflammatory markers, adipokines, and plasma lipids. The addition of ezetimibe to statin therapy resulted in a significant reduction in total cholesterol and LDL-C and the ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. However, ezetimibe add-on treatment had no effect on the primary outcome of plasma adiponectin or on any of the secondary outcomes, including leptin, hsCRP, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, or interleukin-6 concentrations. These observations remained unchanged after adjusting for body mass index and for background statin used. The addition of ezetimibe to stable statin therapy in patients with vascular disease and metabolic syndrome, who were not at guideline recommended LDL-C levels, did not alter adipokine levels after 12 weeks. Short-term add-on with ezetimibe may not be associated with additional inflammatory benefits beyond improvements in cholesterol homeostasis.", 
    "24": "Lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol plays an important role in therapeutic strategies designed to reduce cardiovascular risk. However, the residual clinical risk in statin trials suggests that additional therapies will be required to achieve more effective prevention of cardiovascular disease. The high prevalence of hypertriglyceridemia and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in diabetes presents further targets for the development of new cardioprotective therapies.", 
    "25": "We report on a 55-year-old man who was admitted with increased serum-creatinine (3.4 mg/dl), gross proteinuria (4.6 g/24 h) and arterial hypertension. The medical history included hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease (CAD) and a recent coronary angiography, but normal serum-creatinine and no proteinuria before coronary intervention. Serology and urinary analysis did not show any signs of a systemic disease. A renal biopsy, however, revealed multiple cholesterol crystal emboli in small vessels along with a typical infiltration of eosinophilic granulocytes. The patient was subsequently treated with an angiotensin-receptor-1 (AT1R) blocker and high-dose statins and was then evaluated for LDL-apheresis. Gross proteinuria was largely unaffected by (AT1R) blockade and renal function further declined necessitating, initiation of hemodialysis. Renal CCE with profound proteinuria is an unusual presentation of acute renal failure, potentially misleading and thereby prolonging correct diagnostics of a rare entity. Identification of high-risk patients is of utmost importance as efficient therapeutic strategies do not exist.", 
    "26": "Several studies have reported improved survival in severe bacterial infections among statin treated patients. In addition, statins have been ascribed beneficial anti-inflammatory effects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of statin-treatment on mortality in patients with bacterial infections, by means of a systematic review and a meta-analysis.", 
    "27": "Studies investigating the association between statin use and mortality in patients with bacterial disease were identified in a systematic literature review and a meta-analysis was performed to calculate the overall odds ratio of mortality in statin users. The literature search identified 947 citations from which 40 relevant studies were extracted. In all, 15 studies comprising 113,910 patients were included in the final analysis. Statin use was associated with a significantly (p<0.0001) reduced mortality in patients suffering from bacterial infections (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.42-0.66). However, all studies included were of observational design and funnel plot analyses indicated influence by a possible publication bias (Egger's bias test p<0.05). When a precision estimate test was used to adjust for publication bias the effect of statin treatment was no longer significant, with an OR of 0.79 (95% CI 0.58-1.07).", 
    "28": "According to the meta-analysis of observational studies presented here, patients on statin therapy seem to have a better outcome in bacterial infections.

    "29": "Elevated urinary 11-dehydrothromboxane levels place patients at an increased risk for experiencing cardiovascular events. Statins exert an inhibitory effect on platelets. The aim of our study was to determine the effect of 3-month statin therapy on 11-dehydrothromboxane elimination in two groups of patients, one not receiving antiplatelet therapy with acetylsalicylic acid and the other receiving 100 mg acetylsalicylic acid per day.", 
    "30": "We examined the urinary levels of 11-dehydrothromboxane in a total of 58 patients before and after 3-month therapy with a statin at standard doses (simvastatin, fluvastatin, atorvastatin). We also examined the plasma levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL- and HDL-cholesterol, C-reactive protein, and blood glucose.", 
    "31": "After 3-month statin therapy, both groups of patients (with and without antiplatelet therapy) showed a significant decrease in urinary 11-dehydrothromboxane levels. Significant decreases were also seen in LDL- and total cholesterol, and C-reactive protein. Changes in the other parameters were not significant.", 
    "32": "Three-month statin therapy significant reduces the rate of 11-dehydrothromboxane elimination, even in patients on acetylsalicylic acid. In addition to its usual lipid-lowering effect, it significantly decreases the plasma levels of C-reactive protein.

All tests were performed at baseline and at 4 weeks after stroke.", 
    "35": "A total of 371 patients (249 male and 122 female) were included. Subjects who received simvastatin were significantly older than those who received either dose of atorvastatin. Baseline differences in functional scores were not detected across treatment groups. Two weeks after stroke, subjects exposed to simvastatin had significantly poorer NIHSS and mRS scores than did subjects exposed to either atorvastatin dose. Atorvastatin 80 mg was associated with significantly better outcome compared with either of the other treatment groups. These differences persisted even after controlling for age and baseline scores.",

The mefloquine IC(50) (50% inhibitory concentration) was reduced by 7%, 24% and 37% in the presence of atorvastatin at concentrations of 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 microM, respectively. The synergistic effect of atorvastatin on the response to mefloquine was significantly associated with pfmdr1 copy number. The concentration of atorvastatin that could reduce the IC(50) of mefloquine by 50% was 2.4 +/- 1.3 microM for the 12 strains that contained one copy of pfmdr1 and 5.8 +/- 2.1 microM for the 9 strains that contained two copies or more.

The severity of tubulointerstitial atrophy and the extent of glomerulosclerosis were both associated with smaller kidney size (P = 0.002). Three patterns of vascular involvement were present: atheroembolic, atherosclerotic and hypertensive vascular changes, which were documented in 39, 98 and 52% of subjects, respectively. The presence and severity of these vascular changes positively correlated with both atherosclerotic risk factors, such as hypertension, dyslipidaemia and renal insufficiency, and cardiovascular morbidity, including abdominal aortic aneurysm and myocardial infarction.

Recurrence with rechallenge had a significantly shorter latency to onset (median 2 wks). The MAEs adversely affected all assessed functional and QOL domains. Most patients with probable or definite MAEs were in categories for which available randomized controlled trial evidence shows no trend to all-cause mortality benefit with statin therapy.", 
    "68": "This study complements available information on the properties and natural history of statin-associated MAEs, affirming dose dependence and strong QOL impact. The data indicating a dose-dependent relationship between MAE risk and recurrence suggest lower potency statins or discontinuation may bear consideration for ameliorating symptoms.", 
    "69": "Atherosclerosis is characterized by the progressive deposition of lipids and inflammatory process. We attempted to develop a chemically-induced hyperlipidemic mice model, using poloxamer-407 and evaluated the lipid lowering and anti-inflammatory effect of P. notoginseng compared with that of atorvastatin, an antihyperlipidemic drug.", 
    "70": "Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 5 groups: control group without any intervention (normal), poloxamer 500 mg/kg i.p. (P), poloxamer plus atorvastatin 1.34 mg/kg p.o. (P + ST), poloxamer plus P. notogin-seng 40 mg/kg p.o. (P + NG40), and poloxamer plus P. notoginseng 100 mg/kg p.o. (P + NG100). After 3 weeks, we measured serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), triglyceride, interleukin (IL)-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha levels, and reports of cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) appearances in each group.", 
    "71": "After 3 weeks, serum cholesterol levels significantly decreased in P + ST and P + NG40 groups. Significant decrease of LDL level was only noted in the P + ST group. P + ST, P + NG40, and P + NG100 also had decreased serum triglyceride levels; however, P + ST and P + NG40 showed no statistical difference of the triglyceride lowering effect. The results of IL-1 and TNF-alpha and the appearance of COX-2 and ICAM were statistically not different in each group.", 
    "72": "P. notoginseng 40 mg/kg showed significantly lowering effects on serum total cholesterol and triglyceride levels. We suggest a well-designed study showing the effects of regulating blood lipids with combined administration of P. notoginseng and statin-drug.", 
    "73": "Despite many therapeutic regimens introduced recently, chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is still an incurable disorder. Thus, there is an urgent need to discover novel, less toxic and more effective drugs for CLL patients. In this study, we attempted to assess simvastatin, widely used as a cholesterol-lowering drug, both as a single agent and in combination with purine analogs-fludarabine and cladribine-in terms of its effect on apoptosis and DNA damage of CLL cells. The experiments were done in ex vivo short-term cell cultures of blood and bone marrow cells from newly diagnosed untreated patients. We analyzed expression of active caspase-3 and the BCL-2/BAX ratio as markers of apoptosis and the expression of phosphorylated histone H2AX (named \u03b3H2AX) and activated ATM kinase (ataxia telangiectasia mutated kinase), reporters of DNA damage. Results of our study revealed that simvastatin induced apoptosis of CLL cells concurrently with lowering of BCL-2/BAX ratio, and its pro-apoptotic effect is tumor-specific, not affecting normal lymphocytes. We observed that combinations of simvastatin+fludarabine and simvastatin+cladribine had a synergic effect in inducing apoptosis. Interestingly, the rate of apoptosis caused by simvastatin alone and in combination was independent of markers of disease progression like ZAP-70 and CD38 expression or clinical stage according to Rai classification. We have also seen an increase in \u03b3H2AX expression in parallel with activation of ATM in most of the analyzed samples. The results suggest that simvastatin can be used in the treatment of CLL patients as a single agent as well as in combination with purine analogs, being equally effective both in high-risk and good-prognosis patients. One of the mechanisms of simvastatin action is inducing DNA damage that ultimately leads to apoptosis.",

According to the history of preoperative statin therapy for at least one week, patients were classified as either statin group or control group (72 subjects each). Preoperative and operative characteristics and postoperative data including troponin (Tn)-T level and major morbidity endpoints were obtained and compared. Major morbidity endpoints were defined as permanent stroke, renal dysfunction, hemostatic re-exploration, deep sternal wound infection, and the number of patients requiring prolonged ventilation.", 
    "76": "Preoperative and operative characteristics were similar between the two groups. There were no significant differences in the incidence of morbidity endpoints between the two groups, except for the number of patients requiring dialysis, which was significantly lower in the statin group (8 vs. 1, P = 0.033). Tn-T level at 24 h after surgery was also significantly lower in the statin group.",

    "79": "This open-label, multiple-dose study was conducted in 20 healthy male Caucasian subjects. Simvastatin (40 mg/day) was administered alone for 6 days, followed by co-administration with linagliptin (10 mg/ day) for 6 days, followed by simvastatin single administration for a further 8 days. Plasma concentrations of simvastatin and its active metabolite simvastatin beta-hydroxy acid were determined on Day 6 (before co-administration of linagliptin) and Days 12, 16 and 20 (after co-administration of linagliptin).",

The GMR (90% CI) for simvastatin Cmax,ss was 110.0% (89.3, 135.6) and for simvastatin acid Cmax,ss was 120.7% (101.5, 143.6). 20 adverse events were reported by 11 subjects. Both simvastatin and linagliptin were well tolerated.", 
    "81": "Linagliptin-mediated effects on simvastatin exposure are not considered to be clinically relevant in terms of patient tolerability or safety. Therefore, a dose adjustment of linagliptin is not necessary when these two agents are administered together and linagliptin co-administration is not expected to exert a clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of other CYP3A4 substrates.", 
    "82": "An elevated serum lipid is one of the major risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD). Physicians' awareness contributes to successful adoption of practice guidelines. Community medical centers are the primary defense against chronic disease. This study aimed to investigate community physicians' awareness of cholesterol guidelines and their utilization.",

    "84": "The physicians' fundamental knowledge of lipids was astonishingly poor, while the awareness of cholesterol guidelines was low. Only 24% and 14% of the physicians reported the right optimal low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level for CHD and diabetes patients respectively. More than half of the physicians (55.8%) mistakenly considered elevated transaminases to be the lethal side effect of statins. More than half of the physicians (51.9%) would give up statin treatment in the case of transaminase elevation.",

    "86": "Quinine (QN) remains the first line anti-malarial drug for the treatment of complicated malaria in Europe and Africa. The emergence of QN resistance has been documented. QN resistance is not yet a significant problem, but there is an urgent need to discover partners for use in combination with QN. The aim of the study was to assess the in vitro potentiating effects of atorvastatin (AVA), a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, in combination with QN against Plasmodium falciparum and to evaluate whether the effects of AVA could be associated with gene copy number or mutations in genes involved in QN resistance, such as pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfmrp and pfnhe.", 
    "87": "The susceptibilities to combination of AVA with QN were assessed against 21 parasite strains using the in vitro isotopic microtest. Genotypes and gene copy number were assessed for pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfmdr2, pfmrp genes. In addition, the number of DNNND, DDNHNDNHNN repeats in pfnhe-1 ms4760 and the ms4760 profile were determined for each strains of P. falciparum.", 
    "88": "AVA demonstrated synergistic effects in combination with QN against 21 P. falciparum strains. The QN IC50 was reduced by 5% (0% to 15%; 95%CI: 1%-8%), 10% (3% to 23%; 95%CI: 7%-14%) and 22% (14% to 40%; 95%CI: 19%-25%) in presence of AVA at concentrations of 0.1, 0.5 and 1.0 microM, respectively. These reductions were all significant (p < 0.009). The reduction in the QN IC50 in presence of AVA was not significantly correlated with the QN IC50 (r = 0.22, P = 0.3288) or the AVA IC50 (r = 0.03, P = 0.8946). The synergistic effect of AVA in combination with QN was not significantly associated with polymorphisms in the pfcrt, pfmdr1, pfmrp, and pfnhe-1 genes that could be involved in QN resistance. The synergistic effect of AVA on QN responses was not significantly associated with pfmdr1 copy number (P = 0.0428).", 
    "89": "The synergistic effect of AVA in combination with QN was found to be unrelated to mutations occurring in transport protein genes involved in QN drug resistance. The different mechanisms of drug uptake and/or mode of action for AVA compared to the other anti-malarial drugs, as well as the AVA-mediated synergy of the anti-malarial effect of QN, suggests that AVA will be a good candidate for combinatorial malaria treatment. All of these observations support calls for both an in vivo evaluation with pharmacokinetic component and clinical trials of AVA as an anti-malarial therapy.", 
    "90": "Hypertension and hyperlipidemia often co-exist and seem to be interrelated through common pathophysiological pathways. Drugs employing beneficial effects in both conditions could be advantageous in a concerted effective management of patients at high cardiovascular risk. Statins are known to enhance cardiovascular protection beyond their lipid-lowering capacity.",

Patients with high BP levels at baseline as well as those treated with ACE inhibitors and calcium channel blockers are expected to benefit more in this regard.", 
    "94": "Statins and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are among the most commonly prescribed medications. In vitro studies suggest that statins and NSAIDs may have potential as anticancer therapies in low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphomas including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and a recent observational study found statin use was associated with improved event free survival in patients with follicular lymphoma. Other studies have suggested that statins reduce the efficacy of rituximab by inhibiting binding to CD20. We therefore conducted an observational cohort study of 686 patients with newly diagnosed Rai stage 0 CLL to evaluate whether statin or NSAID use was related to their clinical outcome or influenced the efficacy of rituximab therapy. At diagnosis, 136 (20%) patients took statins and 230 (34%) scheduled daily aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen. No difference in time to treatment was observed based on statin or NSAID use. Among patients receiving a rituximab-containing first-line therapy, no difference in time to salvage treatment was observed based on statin use. Although previous studies suggested statins may improve event free survival among patients with follicular lymphoma, we find no impact of statins on time to initial therapy in this large study of patients with Rai stage 0 CLL. The in vitro observation that statins reduce rituximab efficacy does not appear to have clinical significance in CLL care.",

However, the etiology of a necrotizing myopathy is often obscure, and the question of which patients would benefit from immunosuppression remains unanswered. The aim of this study was to identify novel autoantibodies in patients with necrotizing myopathy.", 
    "96": "Muscle biopsy specimens and serum samples were available for 225 patients with myopathy. Antibody specificities were determined by performing immunoprecipitations from (35)S-methionine-labeled HeLa cell lysates. Selected biopsy specimens were stained for membrane attack complex, class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC), and endothelial cell marker CD31.",

Twelve of these patients had a known autoantibody association with or other etiology for their myopathy. Sixteen of the remaining 26 sera immunoprecipitated 200-kd and 100-kd proteins; this specificity was observed in only 1 of 187 patients without necrotizing myopathy. Patients with the anti-200/100 autoantibody specificity had proximal weakness (100%), high creatine kinase levels (mean maximum 10,333 IU/liter), and an irritable myopathy on electromyography (88%). Sixty-three percent of these patients had been exposed to statins prior to the onset of weakness. All patients responded to immunosuppressive therapy, and many experienced a relapse of weakness when the medication was tapered. Immunohistochemical studies showed membrane attack complex on small blood vessels in 6 of 8 patients and on the surface of non-necrotic myofibers in 4 of 8 patients. Five of 8 patients had abnormal capillary morphology, and 4 of 8 patients expressed class I MHC on the surface of non-necrotic myofibers.", 
    "98": "An anti-200/100-kd specificity defines a subgroup of patients with necrotizing myopathy who previously were considered to be autoantibody negative. We propose that these patients have an immune-mediated myopathy that is frequently associated with prior statin use and should be treated with immunosuppressive therapy.",

For the treatment of type 2 diabetes, there are 2 products that combine a sulfonylurea with metformin, 2 that combine metformin with a thiazolidinedione, 1 that combines metformin with a Dipeptidyl-Peptidase 4 (DPP-4) Inhibitor, and 2 that combine a thiazolidinedione with a sulfonylurea. For treatment of hyperlipidemia, 2 FDCPs are available: Vytorin and Advicor. Advicor is a combination of an HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitor (statin) - lovastatin with an extended release formulation of niacin, while Vytorin is a combination of another statin, simvastatin, and a newer drug ezetimibe. Although the individual components of the FDCPs in this report have been shown to improve health outcomes, we believe it is still important to show whether outcomes are the same under the conditions of the FDCP where it is suggested that adherence and convenience are improved but dose adjustments are more difficult. The purpose of this review is to determine whether the purported advantages of taking 1 pill rather than 2 to treat hyperlipidemia and type 2 diabetes outweigh the potential disadvantages of not being able to adjust the doses of the two drugs separately.",

Treatment options of hyperlipidemia include lifestyle modifications and medical management. Statins have been shown to decrease lipids and exert a pleiotropic effect on intracranial vasculature and inflammatory modulators, leading to neuroprotection. Lower low-density lipoprotein and higher high-density lipoprotein levels are associated with decreased risk of stroke. Despite screening guidelines and evidence of the efficacy of statins, there are numerous barriers to maintaining adequate control of lipids.",

In the 3 recent studies combined, mean cIMT increased at only 33%of the rate of the simvastatin-treated patients in the ASAP study (0.014 mm/2 years [95% confidence interval, -0.0003-0.028] versus 0.041 mm/2 years [95% confidence interval, 0.020-0.061]; P<0.05). Patients whose statin therapy could be intensified, as evidenced by an LDL-C decrease after the initiation of on-trial statin therapy, showed cIMT decrease in the first 6 to 12 months and a much lower cIMT increase measured over the full 2 years. In line with this, previously statin-naive HeFH patients showed a lower overall cIMT increase.",

Efficacy variables were change in TMI by AECG, exercise ischaemia, angina diary data, and inflammatory biomarkers at Week 26. There was a comparable, highly significant decrease in TMI with amlodipine and atorvastatin, but no additional benefit for the combination. More than 50% of patients became TMI-free in all three groups and this was accompanied by a comparable, marked reduction in angina and nitroglycerin consumption. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein fell by 40% in patients receiving atorvastatin but there was no change with amlodipine. Adverse events were comparable among groups.",

    "109": "This study presents a simple method to design an active peptide based on a description of the structural preferences of peptide via its peptide fragments. In a previous design, while searching for lead peptide candidates, the efficacy of a design approach that was based on the use of a cyclic peptide as a model of linear analog was demonstrated. Analysis of the conformational behavior of the peptide models showed that an analogical approach could be applied in order to assess the conformational space that was occupied by a peptide by using peptide fragments. In order to assess the proposed method, a design of a competitive inhibitor for HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR) was performed. Two starting points were used in the design: (1) determined recognized residues and (2) the structural preference of a peptide, such as a beta-turn conformation in the present design. Two sets of peptides were developed based on the different location of a beta-turn structure relative to a recognized residue. Set 1 contains peptides in which a recognized residue is included in turn conformation. In Set 2, the turn structure is located distantly from the recognized residues. The design parameter 'V' that was applied in previous studies was slightly modified for the purpose of the current research. The 17 previously and 8 newly designed peptides were estimated by this parameter. In each set, one sequence was selected as a lead peptide candidate for each set: GF(4-fluoro)PEGG for Set 1 and DFGYVAE for Set 2. The inhibitory activities improved in each set. The IC(50) for the GF(4-fluoro)PEGG peptide was found to be 0.75 microM, while the linear DFGYVAE peptide (IC(50)=0.16 microM) showed a 3000-fold increase in inhibitory activity compared to the first isolated LPYP peptide (IC(50)=484 microM) from soybeans. The comparison of the structure-activity relationship (SAR) data between Set 1 and 2 provided an opportunity to design the peptides in terms of peptide selectivity. A structural analysis of the modeled peptides confirmed the appropriateness of the proposed method for the design of active peptides.",

Plaque composition (fibrous cap and lipid core size), and size (plaque area and volume) were mainly used to evaluate the changes in plaque morphology. All studies showed slower progression, remodelling or even regression of the plaque even after only 1 month of statin administration, although the type, dosage and duration of treatment varied significantly between them. Intensive statin treatment was suggested to have a more pronounced effect on plaque morphology, however, that was mainly associated with maintaining LDL-levels <100 mg/mL and not with the intensity of the dosage. Seven studies measured CRP, four of which found significantly decreased levels with statin use.", 
    "113": "This review suggests that statins may have a beneficial effect on plaque morphology and the inflammatory response. Further validation of whether this is an LDL-associated effect or a separate pleiotropic phenomenon of statins is needed. There are significant inherent limitations to the safe extraction of solid conclusions from the studies due to data heterogeneity and publication bias.",

The highest KLF2, eNOS, and TM mRNA levels were detected at 10 microM simvastatin and 25 dynes/cm(2). Under these conditions, eNOS and TM protein levels were also elevated. Combining LSS and simvastatin produced an overall additive increase in KLF2, eNOS, and TM mRNA. Treatment of the endothelial cells with 10 microM simvastatin and 200 microM mevalonate completely eliminated the effect of simvastatin.",

Here we present and discuss data from a differential proteomic profiling of samples generated using embryonic stem cell derived in vitro models treated with a set of model substances. Among substance-dependent proteomic changes, potential surrogate markers were some isoforms of heat shock proteins and a component of the Ras pathway, present in several redundant isoforms due to posttranslational modifications. Both proteins are implicated in cell migration, cell survival, growth and embryonic development. Using the examples of warfarin and lovastatin, two substances with entirely different primary targets, the surrogate marker signature nevertheless indicates a common embryotoxic mode of action. We discuss these findings observed in in vitro toxicity tests, in a context of clinical validation and evidence-based toxicology.", 
    "119": "Statins have pleiotropic neuroprotective effects in the central nervous system. In this study, we assessed the pharmacological effects of simvastatin on measures of behavior in New Zealand white rabbits embolized using a suspension of small-sized blood clots. For these studies, simvastatin was administered up to 3 hours following embolization, and behavior was measured 48 hours following embolization to calculate the dose of emboli (P(50) in mg) that produces neurological deficits in 50% of the rabbits. A treatment is considered neuroprotective if it significantly increases the P(50) compared to control. Simvastatin treatment (20mg/kg, bolus subcutaneous injection) significantly improved clinical function and increased the P(50) by 143% when administered 1 hour following embolization but was ineffective at 3 hours. In combination studies with the thrombolytic, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) using a standard intravenous dose of 3.3mg/kg (20% bolus, 80% infused), we found that simvastatin could be safely administered with tPA to improve clinical scores; however, the maximum behavioral improvement with the combination treatment was similar to either monotherapy alone, both of which significantly improved behavior (p<0.05). It has been proposed that Simvastatin neuroprotection may be related to a variety of signaling pathways including Rho-kinase (ROCK). To determine if a ROCK mechanism is involved in simvastatin-induced neuroprotection following embolic strokes, we used pharmacological intervention with the ROCK inhibitor, fasudil. When fasudil was administered 30 minutes before simvastatin (given at 1 hour), there was an additional significant (p=0.0217) synergistic increase in behavioral function. However, fasudil as a monotherapy did not affect behavioral function in embolized rabbits. The study suggests that there may be an interaction between simvastatin treatment and the ROCK signaling pathway that should be further explored. Our results suggest that simvastatin treatment may have clinical benefit when used alone or in the presence of tPA, but the therapeutic window using a single-dose regimen is narrow.", 
    "120": "A 43-year-old African-American female with anemia secondary to uterine leiomyomas and menorrhagia presented with induration and stiffness of the right arm and hand four weeks after receiving intravenous iron infusions at multiple infusion sites along the right proximal forearm. Multiple intravenous sites between her right antecubital fossa and wrist had to be used because developing pain necessitated the site changes. The iron infusions were performed because the patient had refused blood transfusions and her symptoms failed to resolve on oral iron supplementation. The skin induration persisted and progressed for several months at which time a skin biopsy was performed. The skin histology was consistent with eosinophilic fasciitis and her complete blood count was notable for a peripheral eosinophilia. Because of the location of the fibrosis and the time proximity in relation to her infusions, a relationship between the iron infusions and eosinophilic fasciitis was made. Cutaneous fibrosis has been linked to immunologic dysfunction, autoantibody production, tissue hypoxia, and vascular damage, which may have been contributing factors in this patient. Eosinophilic fasciitis has been linked to certain drugs and chemicals, notably L-tryptophan ingestion and the statin family of drugs.", 
    "121": "Although norovirus infection is generally known to be a mild disease, there is some evidence for severe outcome. An outbreak in a Dutch psychiatric institution, originating from pilgrims returning from Lourdes (France), provided an opportunity for performing a retrospective cohort study in order to identify risk factors for norovirus disease and excess mortality. Relative risks (RR) including 95% confidence intervals (CI) showed that attending the pilgrimage (RR 2\u00b70, 95% CI 1\u00b74-3\u00b70) and age >70 (RR 1\u00b77, 95% CI 1\u00b72-2\u00b72) were risk factors for symptomatic infection. In a subset of patients, for whom more detailed information was available, the use of statins was associated with norovirus disease when adjusted for underlying condition (adjusted odds ratio 3\u00b79, 95% CI 1\u00b72-13\u00b70). Mortality was higher in cases infected during the pilgrimage compared to other residents (RR 20\u00b79, 95% CI 4\u00b77-93\u00b78). Norovirus disease can lead to severe outcome.

A greater proportion of patients achieved LDL-C < 2.6 mmol/L with EZ + simva 10/20 mg than with simvastatin 40 mg, but this was not statistically significant (78.4% vs 60%; odds ratio = 2.81; p = 0.052).

    "126": "Pu-erh tea is known as a fermented tea and longer storage enhances its flavor and taste. Recently, Aspergillus, Blastobotrys, and Streptomyces are found to play important roles in nutritional enhancement of Pu-erh tea by fermentation. Since water and temperature affect the microbial growth, we therefore explored the factors that might enhance the Pu-erh tea fermentation. The results showed that the addition of fresh tea-leaf extract (TLE) enhanced the withered tea fermentation (at 37 degrees C, 80 to 85% RH) as compared with the water only. Contents of statin, GABA, gallic acid, DPPH scavenging and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activities were increased, whereas polyphenols and caffeine were decreased over 6 mo. TLE dose-dependently enhanced some of the qualities (that is, statin, PPO) of Pu-erh tea significantly as compared with the water only. The effect was related to the increase population of A. niger and A. carbonarius at 6 mo (from 7.6 +/- 1.2 x 10(1) and 3.2 +/- 1.3 x 10(1) to 3.1 +/- 1.2 x 10(6) and 2.4 +/- 1.1 x 10(5) colony forming units [CFU]/g, respectively). After drying process (90 degrees C, 30 min), the total microbial count from these samples returned to background level (3 +/- 0.5 x 10(2) CFU/g). None of ochratoxin and fumonisin, toxins from Aspergillus, was detected in the final products. The flavor and taste were also enhanced by treatment with TLE. The inoculation with S. cinereus Y11 with 2% TLE further enhanced these functional contents (about 2-fold increase of statin level) in the experimental Pu-erh tea. Therefore, this result may add a new process for Pu-erh tea manufacture.", 
    "127": "Statins are potent inhibitors of hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl co-enzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, and have emerged as potential anti-cancer agents based on preclinical evidence. In particular, compelling evidence suggests that statins have a wide range of immunomodulatory properties. However, little is known about the role of statins in tumour immune tolerance. Tumour immune tolerance involves the production of immunosuppressive molecules, such as interleukin (IL)-10, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) by tumours, which induce a regulatory T cell (T(reg)) response. In this study, we investigated the effect of simvastatin on the production of IL-10, TGF-beta and IDO production and the proliferation of T(regs) using several cancer cell lines, and Lewis lung cancer (3LL) cells-inoculated mouse tumour model. Simvastatin treatment resulted in a decrease in the number of cancer cells (3LL, A549 and NCI-H292). The production of the immune regulatory markers IL-10, TGF-beta in 3LL and NCI-H292 cells increased after treatment with simvastatin. The expression of IDO and forkhead box P3 (FoxP3) transcription factor was also increased in the presence of simvastatin. In a murine 3LL model, there were no significant differences in tumour growth rate between untreated and simvastatin-treated mice groups. Therefore, while simvastatin had an anti-proliferative effect, it also exhibited immune tolerance-promoting properties during tumour development. Thus, due to these opposing actions, simvastatin had no net effect on tumour growth.",

Angiotensin II (Ang II) plays important roles in the initiation and progression of these diseases. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) may have cholesterol-independent pleiotropic effects on preventing the EC injury and dysfunction that occurs in these diseases, and the protective effects may relate to bradykinin 2 receptors (B2Rs). Our study was designed to test the hypothesis that atorvastatin, via B2Rs, protects the viability and function of EC exposed to Ang II independent of hemodynamics. The experimental results showed that the cytotoxic effects of Ang II on human umbilical vein endothelial cells were significantly ameliorated by atorvastatin pretreatment (LDH tests, MTT assay, and propdium iodide (PI)/Annexin V-stating analysis), and atorvastatin treatment simultaneously enhanced expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and yielded of nitric oxide (NO) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate, but both effects were attenuated by the B2Rs antagonist HOE-140. This study proves the hypothesis and may be pertinent to the complex mechanism of action of statins explaining their long-term beneficial effects in maintaining the morphological and functional integrity of vascular ECs.",

The impact of statins on skeletal muscle of non-myopathic patients is not known. We analyzed the expression of selected genes implicated in the molecular regulation of calcium and membrane repair, in lipid homeostasis, myocyte remodeling and mitochondrial function. Microscopic and gene expression analyses were performed using validated TaqMan custom arrays on skeletal muscle biopsies of 72 age-matched subjects who were receiving statin therapy (n = 38), who had discontinued therapy due to statin-associated myopathy (n = 14), and who had never undergone statin treatment (n = 20). In skeletal muscle, obtained from statin-treated, non-myopathic patients, statins caused extensive changes in the expression of genes of the calcium regulatory and the membrane repair machinery, whereas the expression of genes responsible for mitochondrial function or myocyte remodeling was unaffected. Discontinuation of treatment due to myopathic symptoms led to a normalization of gene expression levels, the genes encoding the ryanodine receptor 3, calpain 3, and dystrophin being the most notable exceptions. Hence, even in clinically asymptomatic (non-myopathic) patients, statin therapy leads to an upregulation in the expression of genes that are concerned with skeletal muscle regulation and membrane repair.",

A combination of two first-line agents may also be considered as initial treatment of hypertension if systolic blood pressure is 20 mmHg above target or if diastolic blood pressure is 10 mmHg above target. The combination of ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be used, unless compelling indications are present to suggest consideration of dual therapy. Agents appropriate for first-line therapy for isolated systolic hypertension include thiazide diuretics, long-acting dihydropyridine CCBs or ARBs. In patients with coronary artery disease, ACE inhibitors, ARBs or betablockers are recommended as first-line therapy; in patients with cerebrovascular disease, an ACE inhibitor/diuretic combination is preferred; in patients with proteinuric nondiabetic chronic kidney disease, ACE inhibitors or ARBs (if intolerant to ACE inhibitors) are recommended; and in patients with diabetes mellitus, ACE inhibitors or ARBs (or, in patients without albuminuria, thiazides or dihydropyridine CCBs) are appropriate first-line therapies. In selected high-risk patients in whom combination therapy is being considered, an ACE inhibitor plus a long-acting dihydropyridine CCB is preferable to an ACE inhibitor plus a thiazide diuretic. All hypertensive patients with dyslipidemia should be treated using the thresholds, targets and agents outlined in the Canadian lipid treatment guidelines. Selected patients with hypertension who do not achieve thresholds for statin therapy, but who are otherwise at high risk for cardiovascular events, should nonetheless receive statin therapy. Once blood pressure is controlled, low-dose acetylsalicylic acid therapy should be considered.",

Upon activation the gammadelta T cells rapidly secrete antiviral cytokines similar to classical memory alphabeta T cells. Here we have investigated the ability of gammadelta T lymphocytes from human PBMC to become activated by influenza A virus infection. Vgamma9Vdelta2 T lymphocytes rapidly upregulate expression of CD25 and CD69 and produce IFN-gamma following influenza infection of PBMC. Moreover, the recognition is cross-reactive between various subtypes of influenza, but not with vaccinia virus. Vgamma9Vdelta2 T cell responses are potently reduced by the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor mevastatin, which inhibits the mevalonate pathway and IPP synthesis. Our results indicate that influenza virus infection induces the rapid activation and function of Vgamma9Vdelta2 T lymphocytes in the peripheral blood via a mechanism that depends on the mevalonate pathway.",

TOGETHER was a 6-week, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy trial using hypertensive participants with additional CV risk factors without CVD/diabetes. Participants were randomized to either AML/ATO (5 to 10/20 mg) + TLC or AML (5 to 10 mg) + TLC. The primary end point was the difference in proportion of participants attaining both BP (<140/90 mm Hg) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (<100 mg/dL) goals at week 6.

The standard treatment of symptomatic gallstone subjects is laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The selection of patients amenable for nonsurgical, medical therapy is of key importance; a careful analysis should consider the natural history of the disease and the overall costs of therapy. Only patients with mild symptoms and small, uncalcified cholesterol gallstones in a functioning gallbladder with a patent cystic duct are considered for oral litholysis by hydrophilic ursodeoxycholic acid, in the hope of achieving cholesterol desaturation of bile and progressive stone dissolution. Recent studies have raised the possibility that cholesterol-lowering agents that inhibit hepatic cholesterol synthesis (statins) or intestinal cholesterol absorption (ezetimibe), or drugs acting on specific nuclear receptors involved in cholesterol and bile acid homeostasis, may offer, alone or in combination, additional medical therapeutic tools for treating cholesterol gallstones. Recent perspectives on medical treatment of cholesterol gallstone disease are discussed in this article.", 
    "202": "Epidemiological studies have shown an association between statin use and a decreased risk of dementia. However, the mechanism by which this beneficial effect is brought about is unclear. In the context of Alzheimer's disease, at least three possibilities have been studied; reduction in amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) production, the promotion of alpha-secretase cleavage and positive effects on neurite outgrowth. By investigating the effects of mevalonate pathway blockade on neurite outgrowth using real-time imaging, we found that rather than promote the production of neurite extensions, inhibition rapidly induced cell rounding. Crucially, neurite-like structures were generated through the persistence of cell-cell and cell-substrate adhesions and not through a mechanism of positive outgrowth. This effect can be strikingly enhanced by the over-expression of human amyloid precursor protein and is isoprenoid rather than cholesterol dependent.", 
    "203": "To investigate whether anti-inflammatory effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin (SMV) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is mediated by Toll-like receptor-2 (TLR-2) signal via inhibiting activation of RhoA, a small Rho GTPase that plays an important role in inflammatory responses. Peripheral blood monocytes from active RA patients were treated with Staphylococcus aureus peptidoglycan (PG), a ligand of TLR-2, in the presence or absence of SMV. RhoA activity was assessed by a pull-down assay. DNA-binding activity was measured by a sensitive multi-well colorimetric assay. Cytokine secretion was measured by ELISA. PG stimulation increased the level of active GTP-bound RhoA compared with unstimulated monocytes, and the effect of PG on RhoA activity was suppressed with anti-TLR-2 monoclonal antibody. RhoA inhibition either with a specific inhibitor or by siRNA transfection inhibited activation of NF-\u03baB and secretion of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in PG-induced RA monocytes. SMV mitigated PG-induced increase in RhoA activity and NF-\u03baB activation as well as secretion of TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2. The inhibitory effects of SMV were completely reversed by mevalonate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. Our results indicate the modulation of RhoA on TLR-2-mediated inflammatory signaling in RA and provide a novel evidence for anti-inflammatory effects of statins through influencing TLR-2 signaling via RhoA in RA.",

Experimental evidence indicates that some statins can cross the blood-brain barrier, alter brain cholesterol metabolism, and may ultimately decrease the production of amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide. Despite these promising leads, clinical trials have yielded inconsistent results regarding the benefits of statin treatment in AD. Seeking to detect a biological signal of statins effect on AD, we conducted a 12-week open-label trial with simvastatin 40 mg/d and then 80 mg/d in 12 patients with AD or amnestic mild cognitive impairment and hypercholesterolemia. We quantified cholesterol precursors and metabolites and AD biomarkers of Abeta and tau in both plasma and cerebrospinal fluid at baseline and after the 12-week treatment period. We found a modest but significant inhibition of brain cholesterol biosynthesis after simvastatin treatment, as indexed by a decrease of cerebrospinal fluid lathosterol and plasma 24S-hydroxycholesterol. Despite this effect, there were no changes in AD biomarkers. Our findings indicate that simvastatin treatment can affect brain cholesterol metabolism within 12 weeks, but did not alter molecular indices of AD pathology during this short-term treatment.",

    "213": "Although perioperative macrovascular events (eg, myocardial infarction, stroke) are readily evident, their absolute incidence remains relatively low. In contrast, microvascular dysfunction and its role in perioperative morbidity is not easily measured. Microvascular dysfunction is likely to have a greater impact on noncardiovascular complications (eg, wound healing and end-organ failure), through impaired perfusion, than that which is readily appreciated. Inflammation and oxidative stress, such as that induced by surgical trauma, disrupts endothelial homeostasis thereby decreasing the bioavailability of nitric oxide. This predisposes blood vessels to vasoconstriction, inflammation, leukocyte adhesion, thrombosis-factors that contribute to perioperative cardiovascular events at both macrovascular and microvascular level. Current clinical strategies applicable to the perioperative setting that improve microvascular health include preoperative exercise therapy, pharmacologic interventions (eg, statins, newer beta-blockers) and attempts to stimulate mobilization and homing of bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells. Many of these strategies are still in their infancy and large prospective trials that investigate the impact of these therapeutic options on postoperative outcome are eagerly awaited.", 
    "214": "Epidemiological studies suggest that statins (hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors) could reduce the risk of Alzheimer disease. Although one possible explanation is through an effect on beta-amyloid (Abeta) metabolism, its effect remains to be elucidated. Here, we explored the molecular mechanisms of how statins influence Abeta metabolism. Fluvastatin at clinical doses significantly reduced Abeta and amyloid precursor protein C-terminal fragment (APP-CTF) levels among APP metabolites in the brain of C57BL/6 mice. Chronic intracerebroventricular infusion of lysosomal inhibitors blocked these effects, indicating that up-regulation of the lysosomal degradation of endogenous APP-CTFs is involved in reduced Abeta production. Biochemical analysis suggested that this was mediated by enhanced trafficking of APP-CTFs from endosomes to lysosomes, associated with marked changes of Rab proteins, which regulate endosomal function. In primary neurons, fluvastatin enhanced the degradation of APP-CTFs through an isoprenoid-dependent mechanism. Because our previous study suggests additive effects of fluvastatin on Abeta metabolism, we examined Abeta clearance rates by using the brain efflux index method and found its increased rates at high Abeta levels from brain. As LRP1 in brain microvessels was increased, up-regulation of LRP1-mediated Abeta clearance at the blood-brain barrier might be involved. In cultured brain microvessel endothelial cells, fluvastatin increased LRP1 and the uptake of Abeta, which was blocked by LRP1 antagonists, through an isoprenoid-dependent mechanism. Overall, the present study demonstrated that fluvastatin reduced Abeta level by an isoprenoid-dependent mechanism. These results have important implications for the development of disease-modifying therapy for Alzheimer disease as well as understanding of Abeta metabolism.", 
    "215": "Statins, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, are used widely in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Apart from lowering lipid levels, statins have been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects. Previously we showed that atorvastatin inhibits NF-kappaB activation, dose and time dependently, in LPS-TLR4 signaling pathway. In this study, we investigated the anti-inflammatory mechanism of atorvastatin via Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in murine pro-B cell lines transfected with TLR4. Co-treatment of LPS-stimulated cells with both atorvastatin and mevalonate rescued NF-kappaB activation and TLR4 blockade demonstrated that atorvastatin does not exert its inhibitory effect via TLR4 receptor-ligand binding mechanism. Further investigation into the anti-inflammatory mechanism has shown that atorvastatin causes an impairment of TLR4 recruitment into the lipid raft thereby affecting anti-inflammatory responses. In contrast, mevalonate repaired lipid raft function leading to TLR4 clustering in the lipid raft. Together, these data suggest that atorvastatin exerts its anti-inflammatory effect via lipid raft modification. This novel finding offers another insight into the pleiotropic effects of atorvastatin and may be applicable to other pattern recognition receptors that utilize membrane lipid raft as a platform for signal transduction.", 
    "216": "Lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), which accumulates in the ischemic myocardium, is responsible for mechanical and metabolic derangements of hearts, and also contributes to the development of ventricular arrhythmias. We examined the effects of pravastatin on the LPC-induced cardiac dysfunction in isolated rat hearts. Rat hearts were randomly divided into four groups. The groups comprised a control group (n=10), a group treated with LPC (5 microM) (n=20), a group treated with pravastatin (400 ng/ml) (n=10) and a group treated with both LPC and pravastatin (n=20). Our data suggest that, pravastatin possesses some protective profiles against LPC, as manifested by better recovery of cardiac function (improvement in heart rate, left ventricular developed pressure, maximal and minimal first derivatives of left ventricular developed pressure, coronary flow and coronary resistance, less release of biomarkers of cardiac injury (lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase-MB and endothelin-1), and attenuation of ventricular arrhythmias (ventricular tachyarrhythmia and ventricular fibrillation).",

    "222": "Ras super-family small GTPases regulate diverse cellular processes such as vesicular transport and signal transduction. Critical to these activities is the ability of these proteins to target to specific intracellular membranes. To allow association with membranes Ras-related GTPases are post-translationally modified by covalent attachment of prenyl groups to conserved cysteine residues at or near their C-terminus. Here we used the HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A) reductase (HMGCR) inhibitor mevastatin to develop a 'prenylation block-and-release' assay that allows membrane targeting of prenylated proteins to be visualized in living cells. Using this assay we investigated the cytosol to membrane targeting of several small GTPases to compartments of the secretory and endocytic pathways. We found that all Rabs tested were targeted directly to the membrane on which they reside at steady-state and not via an intermediate location as reported for Ras and Rho proteins. However, we observed that the kinetics of cytosol to membrane targeting differed for each Rab tested. Comparison of the mevastatin sensitivity and kinetics of membrane targeting of Rab23, Rab23 prenylation motif mutants and H-Ras revealed that these parameters are strongly dependent upon the prenyl transferase with Rab geranylgeranyl transferase substrates exhibiting higher sensitivity and requiring greater time to recover from mevastatin inhibition than farnesyl transferase substrates. We propose that this assay is a useful tool to investigate the kinetics, biological functions and the mechanisms of membrane targeting of prenylated proteins.", 
    "223": "The metabolic syndrome (MetS) and conditions of insulin resistance are often characterized by an increase in cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk without a concomitant increase in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), suggesting that other atherogenic pathways maybe involved. Intestinally derived chylomicron remnants (CM-r) are also thought to contribute to atherogenic dyslipidemia during insulin resistance. Recent animal and human studies suggest that insulin resistance leads to an over-production of intestinal chylomicrons (CM), which can contribute to fasting and post-prandial dyslipidemia during these conditions. We and others have contributed new insights into the mucosal absorption, efflux and secretion of cholesterol and triglyceride (TG) in intestinal CM during conditions of insulin resistance. One of the pertinent discoveries has been that the intestine has the capacity to increase the secretion of CM during conditions of hyper-insulinemia (observed in the JCR:LA-cp rat model). Advances to identify cholesterol-transporter targets have highlighted the contribution of the intestine to whole body cholesterol metabolism. Ezetimibe (EZ) is a novel pharmaceutical compound that reduces intestinal cholesterol absorption. We know that ezetimibe either alone, or in combination with a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (such as simvastatin [SV]) can decrease both plasma LDL-C and CM-r concentrations. However, the combined effects of these compounds (EZ+SV) on post-prandial dyslipidemia and/or impact on arterial deposition of cholesterol during MetS have not been studied. The focus of this review is to highlight studies using an animal model of MetS and CM over-production (the JCR:LA-cp rat), and to summarize the effects of ezetimibe on intestinal cholesterol flux, CM metabolism and uptake of cholesterol into arterial vessels.",

The Kaplan-Meier curves showed that the incidence of death and non-fatal MI was significantly greater in the control group than in the rosuvastatin group (hazard ratio, 3.71; p=0.021). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels were less elevated in the rosuvastatin group than in the control group at 24 h after PCI. Multivariate analysis revealed that rosuvastatin loading was an independent predictor of a reduction in the risk of MACE at 12 months (odds ratio, 0.5; p=0.006).", 
    "227": "High dose rosuvastatin loading before PCI significantly improved 12-month clinical outcomes in patients with ACS who underwent an early invasive strategy.", 
    "228": "Oxidative stress is considered an important factor in the development of diabetic complications that causes a variety of changes such as oxidative modification of membrane lipids, nucleic acids and cellular proteins. Dyslipidemia is frequently associated with diabetes and cardiovascular disease. In this context, the objective of this study was to evaluate oxidative modifications of plasma proteins and lipids in non dyslipidemic type 2 diabetic (T2D) patients, in dyslipidemic T2D patients treated or not with simvastatin and in healthy subjects to investigate whether treatment with low doses of simvastatin plays a protective role on the lipid and protein oxidative damage in these patients.", 
    "229": "We determined oxidative damage of plasma proteins by carbonyl assay and total thiol group determination. We also characterized the membrane damage in terms of lipid peroxidation by measuring malonaldehyde (MDA) in nondyslipidemic T2D patients, dyslipidemic T2D patients treated with simvastatin (20 mg/day), dyslipidemic T2D patients not treated with simvastatin and in healthy age-matched control subjects.", 
    "230": "Our results showed that dyslipidemic T2D patients not treated with simvastatin had significantly higher plasma protein carbonyl groups and MDA when compared to dyslipidemic T2D patients treated with simvastatin and control group. Thiol concentrations from dyslipidemic T2D patients not treated with simvastatin were significantly lower than treated patients and controls. It was verified that the thiols groups were inversely correlated with apolipoprotein B and positively correlated with apolipoprotein A-I.", 
    "231": "These results demonstrated that treatment with low doses of simvastatin can minimize the protein and lipid oxidative damage in dyslipidemic T2D patients.", 
    "232": "Cholesterol is vital to normal brain function including learning and memory but that involvement is as complex as the synthesis, metabolism and excretion of cholesterol itself. Dietary cholesterol influences learning tasks from water maze to fear conditioning even though cholesterol does not cross the blood brain barrier. Excess cholesterol has many consequences including peripheral pathology that can signal brain via cholesterol metabolites, pro-inflammatory mediators and antioxidant processes. Manipulations of cholesterol within the central nervous system through genetic, pharmacological, or metabolic means circumvent the blood brain barrier and affect learning and memory but often in animals already otherwise compromised. The human literature is no less complex. Cholesterol reduction using statins improves memory in some cases but not others. There is also controversy over statin use to alleviate memory problems in Alzheimer's disease. Correlations of cholesterol and cognitive function are mixed and association studies find some genetic polymorphisms are related to cognitive function but others are not. In sum, the field is in flux with a number of seemingly contradictory results and many complexities. Nevertheless, understanding cholesterol effects on learning and memory is too important to ignore.", 
    "233": "Oxidative stress and ischaemia are suggested as possible mechanisms of contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN). Statins may offer renoprotection in both acute and chronic kidney diseases because of their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. We investigated whether use of statins before non-emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) reduces the incidence of CIN.", 
    "234": "We retrospectively evaluated 540 consecutive adult patients who underwent non-emergent PCI over a 3 year period at a tertiary care centre. CIN was defined as 25% or 44 mmol/L increase from baseline creatinine at 48-72 h. In addition, we classified patients based on Mehran score for risk of development of CIN and analysed the effect of statins.", 
    "235": "Three-hundred and fifty-three patients met inclusion criteria. Two-hundred and thirty-nine patients were taking statins before PCI and 114 were not. Baseline characteristics were similar for both groups. CIN occurred in 75 patients (21.2%). There was a higher incidence of CIN in patients on statins as compared with patients not on statins (24.7% vs 14%; 95% CI: 1.09-3.67; P = 0.02). However, propensity-based adjustment for receipt of statins revealed no significant differences in CIN between both groups (OR: 1.6; 95% CI: 0.87-3.22; P = 0.12). Multivariate logistic regression revealed Mehran score to be independently predictive of CIN. None of the patients who developed CIN required dialysis.", 
    "236": "Statin use before non-emergent PCI is not associated with reduction in CIN. Further randomized controlled trials based on proper risk adjustment for development of CIN are needed.", 
    "237": "The available therapeutic options for sepsis are restricted by their effectiveness and high cost. Emerging preliminary data suggest that statins and omega-3 fatty acids (OM3FA) may be associated with improved outcomes in terms of prevention and treatment of sepsis. We sought to review the current evidence on the effectiveness of their combined administration against sepsis, by carrying out a review of PubMed and Scopus databases for relevant studies, without imposing language or time restrictions. No clinical studies were identified regarding the effect of the combination treatment with statins and OM3FA on sepsis in terms of prevention or treatment. However, there is experimental evidence that both statins and OM3FA inhibit the inflammatory process at different levels, but also enhance inhibition at those levels that are common. There are also preliminary data supporting the beneficial effect of this combination on platelet function and other haemostatic mechanisms. Appropriately designed and powered clinical trials are warranted to investigate the effectiveness and safety of the combined administration of statins and OM3FA for the prevention and treatment of sepsis.", 
    "238": "Coronary heart disease (CHD), the commonest cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes, requires multipronged approach for management, including especially treating dyslipidaemia with statins. We conducted this study to demonstrate that low dose (10 mg) atorvastatin is effective in reducing LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) to the target levels in patients from Indian subcontinent. Eighty-one subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus and dyslipidaemia (LDL-C >100 mg/dl in those without coronary artery disease, n=77; LDL-C >70 mg/dl in those with coronary artery disease, n=4) were included. All patients were initiated on 10 mg atorvastatin daily. Serum lipid profile was repeated after 3 months. The mean body mass index among men and women were 25.0 +/- 4 and 26.7 +/- 3.6 kg/m2 respectively. Pretreatment mean HbA(1c) was 7.9 +/- 1.8 % and total cholesterol, triglycerides and HDL cholestrol (HDL-C) and LDL-C was 214 +/- 27 mg/dl, 164 +/- 63 mg/dl, 46 +/- 6 mg/dl and 135 +/- 24 mg/dl respectively. After three months of treatment the mean decrease was 62 +/- 31 mg/dl in total cholesterol (p < 0.001), 31 +/- 57 mg/dl in triglycerides (p < 0.001), 51 +/- 27 mg/dl in LDL-C (p < 0.001) and 4 +/- 8 mg/dl in HDL-C (p < 0.001). The LDL-C level was reduced by 37.6% in these patients, from 135 +/- 24 mg/dl to 84 = 27 mg/dl (p < 0.001) with 10 mg of atorvastatin daily. It was possible to achieve target LDL-C of less than 100 mg/dl in 75.5% (n=58) in subjects without CHD (n=77) and less than 70 mg/dl in 75% (n=3) of those patients with CHD (n=4). The present study showed that in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, 10 mg of atorvastatin daily was safe, well tolerated, and effective in reducing LDL-C to target levels.", 
    "239": "Simvastatin, a potent inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA) is known to stimulate apoptotic cell death and induce cell cycle arrest through inhibition of proteasome. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether simvastatin would be synergistic with irinotecan against human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells. Antitumor effect was measured by growth inhibition of cells and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. The cytotoxic interaction between irinotecan and simvastatin was assessed using the combination index. Effects on cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were determined by flow cytometry and DNA fragmentation. Proteasome activity was measured by ELISA quantification of 20S proteasome. NF-\u03baB activation was determined using TransAM\u2122 NF-\u03baB p65 Transcription Factor Assay Kit. I\u03baB-\u03b1 was measured by immunoblot. A combination of irinotecan with simvastatin showed significantly enhanced cell growth inhibition compared with irinotecan alone, which resulted in a synergistic cytotoxicity. Irinotecan and simvastatin combination treatment of A549 and H460 cells increased G(1) phase arrest, which was associated with up-regulation of p21(WAF1/CIP) and p53 compared with irinotecan alone. In addition, simvastatin combination treatment increased irinotecan-related apoptosis as determined by fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometric analysis. We also found that combination therapy showed superior proteasome inhibitory activity leading to effectively suppress NF-\u03baB transcription factor activation. Consistently, this effect was associated with up-regulation of I\u03baB-\u03b1. These findings suggest that simvastatin enhances irinotecan-induced apoptosis in human NSCLC cells through inhibition of proteasome activity."
