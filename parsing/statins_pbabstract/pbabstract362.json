    "12": "Human paraoxonase (PON1) is a calcium-dependent esterase closely associated with high density lipoprotein (HDL)-containing apolipoprotein AI (apoAI), which has been shown to confer antioxidant properties to HDL. PON1 has been recently implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Low PON1 activities have been found in familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and diabetes mellitus. We have undertaken a study of the effect of the lipid-lowering drug simvastatin on serum PON1 activity (in relation to paraoxon and arylesterase activity), on apoAI-containing and apolipoprotein B (apoB)-containing lipoproteins, and on lipid peroxide concentrations in 64 (39 women and 25 men) unrelated FH patients. We have also analyzed the influence of the PON1-192 and PON1-55 genetic polymorphisms on the response of PON1 activity to simvastatin therapy. A venous blood sample for a baseline analysis and another after 4 months of simvastatin therapy at a dosage of 20 mg per day were taken. The major effect of simvastatin on lipid traits was to decrease serum cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and lipid peroxide concentrations by 19.9%, 26.3%, and 37.3%, respectively. There was also a significant decrease in serum apoB, LDL apoB, and triglyceride concentrations (20.5%, 21.1%, and 15.6%, respectively). Conversely, simvastatin had no significant influence on very low density lipoprotein-lipid content, HDL cholesterol, apoAI concentrations, and lipoprotein AI and AI:AII particles. Remarkably, serum PON1 activity toward paraoxon significantly increased during treatment with simvastatin (168. 7+/-100.3 U/L before therapy versus 189.5+/-116.5 U/L after therapy, P:=0.005). Arylesterase activity displayed only a nonsignificant trend to increase after therapy. Whereas PON1 activity levels were significantly lower in FH patients before simvastatin therapy compared with those of 124 normolipidemic subjects (168.7+/-100.3 versus 207.6+/-125.2 U/L, respectively; P:<0.05), this difference disappeared after simvastatin therapy. After simvastatin therapy, a significantly negative correlation between PON1 activity and lipid peroxide concentration was observed (r=-0.35, P:=0.028). The latter also strongly correlated with LDL cholesterol concentration (r=0.64, P:<0.001). Serum PON1 activity levels were significantly lower in the low-activity PON1-192 QQ and PON1-55 M carriers than in R carriers and in LL carriers, respectively. No significant differences were found in the therapeutic response of PON1 activity between genotype groups (8.5% and 11.1% increase for QQ homozygous and R-carrier FH patients, respectively, and 12.7% and 9.5% increase for LL homozygotes and M carriers, respectively). We conclude that simvastatin may have important antioxidant properties through increasing serum PON1 activity, perhaps as a consequence of reducing oxidative stress, by a mechanism independent of apoAI-containing lipoprotein concentration and without the influence of PON1-192 and PON1-55 genetic polymorphisms. Further studies are clearly warranted to clarify the precise mechanism by which simvastatin therapy is associated with increased PON1 activity.", 
    "13": "Cerivastatin sodium, a novel statin, is a synthetic, enantiomerically pure, pyridine derivative that effectively reduces serum cholesterol levels at microgram doses. Cerivastatin is readily and completely absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, with plasma concentrations reaching a peak 2 to 3 hours postadministration followed by a monoexponential decay with an elimination half-life (t1/2beta) of 2 to 3 hours. Cerivastatin pharmacokinetics are linear: maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) are proportional to the dose over the range of 0.05 to 0.8 mg. No accumulation is observed on repeated administration. Cerivastatin interindividual variability is described by coefficients of variation of approximately 30 to 40% for its primary pharmacokinetic parameters AUC, Cmax and t1/2beta. The mean absolute oral bioavailability of cerivastatin is 60% because of presystemic first-pass effects. Its pharmacokinetics are not influenced by concomitant administration of food nor by the time of day at which the dose is given. Age, gender, ethnicity and concurrent disease also have no clinically significant effects. Cerivastatin is highly bound to plasma proteins (>99%). The volume of distribution at steady state of about 0.3 L/kg indicates that the drug penetrates only moderately into tissue; conversely, preclinical studies have shown a high affinity for liver tissue, the target site of action. Cerivastatin is exclusively cleared via metabolism. No unchanged drug is excreted. Cerivastatin is subject to 2 main oxidative biotransformation reactions: demethylation of the benzylic methyl ether moiety leading to the metabolite M-1 [catalysed by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C8 and CYP3A4] and stereoselective hydroxylation of one methyl group of the 6-isopropyl substituent leading to the metabolite M-23 (catalysed by CYP2C8). The product of the combined biotransformation reactions is a secondary minor metabolite, M-24, not detectable in plasma. All 3 metabolites are active inhibitors of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase with a similar potency to the parent drug. Approximately 70% of the administered dose is excreted as metabolites in the faeces, and 30% in the urine. Metabolism by 2 distinct CYP isoforms renders cerivastatin relatively resistant to interactions arising from inhibition of CYP. If one of the pathways is blocked, cerivastatin can be effectively metabolised by the alternative route. In addition, on the basis of in vitro investigations, there is no evidence for either cerivastatin or its metabolites having any inducing or inhibitory activity on CYP. The apparent lack of any clinically relevant interactions with a variety of drugs commonly used by patients in the target population supports this favourable drug-drug interaction profile.", 
    "14": "Concomitant treatment with simvastatin and gemfibrozil, two lipid-lowering drugs, has been associated with occurrence of myopathy in case reports.

    "15": "A double-blind, randomized crossover study with two phases (placebo and gemfibrozil) was carried out. Ten healthy volunteers were given gemfibrozil (600 mg twice daily) or placebo orally for 3 days. On day 3 they ingested a single 40-mg dose of simvastatin. Plasma concentrations of simvastatin and simvastatin acid were measured up to 12 hours. In addition, the effect of gemfibrozil (0 to 1,200 micromol/L) on midazolam 1'-hydroxylation, a CYP3A4 model reaction, was investigated in human liver microsomes in vitro.", 
    "16": "Gemfibrozil increased the mean total area under the plasma concentration-time curve of simvastatin [AUC(0-infinity)] by 35% (P < .01) and the AUC(0-infinity) of simvastatin acid by 185% (P < .001). The elimination half-life of simvastatin was increased by 74% (P < .05), and that of simvastatin acid was increased by 51% (P < .01) by gemfibrozil. The peak concentration of simvastatin acid was increased by 112%, from 3.20 +/- 2.73 ng/mL to 6.78 +/- 4.67 ng/mL (mean +/- SD; P < .01). In vitro, gemfibrozil showed no inhibition of midazolam 1'-hydroxylation.", 
    "17": "Gemfibrozil increases plasma concentrations of simvastatin and, in particular, its active form, simvastatin acid, suggesting that the increased risk of myopathy in combination treatment is, at least partially, of a pharmacokinetic origin. Because gemfibrozil does not inhibit CYP3A4 in vitro, the mechanism of the pharmacokinetic interaction is probably inhibition of non-CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of simvastatin acid.", 
    "18": "Clinical trials of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors or statin therapy demonstrate an improvement in cardiovascular end points and coronary stenosis. However, an improvement in cardiovascular end points and coronary stenosis is incompletely explained by the baseline or treated LDL cholesterol level. The beneficial effects of statins on clinical events may involve nonlipid mechanisms that modify endothelial function, smooth muscle cells, and monocyte-macrophage: vasomotor function, inflammatory responses, and plaque stability. Augmented bioactivity of NO by statin therapy either indirectly by its effect on lipoprotein levels and protection of LDL from oxidation, or directly by effects on NO synthesis and release, might account for enhancement of endothelium-dependent vasodilation. Recent experimental and animal studies have demonstrated that statins dose-dependently decrease smooth muscle cells migration and proliferation, independently of their ability to reduce plasma cholesterol. Moreover, statins are able to reduce the in vitro cholesterol accumulation in macrophages and expression of matrix metalloproteinase, resulting in plaque stability. These effects of statins were completely prevented by the addition of mevalonate and partially by all-trans farnesol and all-trans geranylgeraniol, confirming the specific role of isoprenoid metabolites, probably through prenylated proteins, in regulating these cellular events. Statins have been shown to prevent the activation of monocytes into macrophages, inhibit the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, C-reactive protein, and cellular adhesion molecules. Statins decrease the adhesion of monocyte to endothelial cells. Accordingly, statins exert their cardiovascular benefits through a direct antiatherogenic properties in the arterial wall, beyond their effects on plasma lipids.",

    "20": "Vascular reactivity to big endothelin-1 (bigET-1; 10(-9) to 10(-7) mol/L) and ET-1 (10(-9) to 10(-7) mol/L) were examined in the internal mammary artery (IMA, n=33) and saphenous vein (SV, n=27) of patients with coronary artery disease with identified cardiovascular risk factors. Vascular ECE activity was determined by conversion of exogenously added bigET-1 to ET-1. Tissue contents of bigET-1 and ET-1 were measured by radioimmunoassay. In addition, the effects of LDL and oxidized LDL on ECE-1 protein levels were determined by Western blot analysis in human IMA endothelial cells. In the IMA, vascular ECE activity showed an inverse correlation with serum LDL levels (r=-0.76; P<0.01) and systolic and diastolic blood pressure and a positive correlation with fibrinogen (r=0.58; P<0.05). In the SV, fibrinogen was the only parameter to be correlated with vascular ECE activity. Vascular tissue content of bigET-1 was attenuated in the IMA of patients with hyperfibrinogenemia but increased in patients with elevated systolic blood pressure and increased serum LDL levels (P<0.05). Most interestingly, LDL and oxidized LDL downregulated ECE-1 protein levels in human IMA endothelial cells (P<0.05).", 
    "21": "These data demonstrate, for the first time, that vascular ECE activity is (1) inversely correlated with serum LDL levels and blood pressure and (2) positively associated with fibrinogen in human vascular tissue. Hence, ECE-1 activity may modulate cardiovascular risk in patients with coronary artery disease.", 
    "22": "Recent studies suggest that statins can function to protect the vasculature in a manner that is independent of their lipid-lowering activity. We show here that statins rapidly activate the protein kinase Akt/PKB in endothelial cells. Accordingly, simvastatin enhanced phosphorylation of the endogenous Akt substrate endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), inhibited apoptosis and accelerated vascular structure formation in vitro in an Akt-dependent manner. Similar to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment, both simvastatin administration and enhanced Akt signaling in the endothelium promoted angiogenesis in ischemic limbs of normocholesterolemic rabbits. Therefore, activation of Akt represents a mechanism that can account for some of the beneficial side effects of statins, including the promotion of new blood vessel growth.", 
    "23": "In plants, the first committed step in the cytosolic pathway for biosynthesis of isoprenoids is catalysed by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR). We have added an eight amino-acid-residue epitope tag to a potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) HMGR isoform and expressed this novel protein (HMGR-FLAG) in transgenic plants. Despite high levels of transcript accumulation in all leaf stages of transgenic plants, high levels of HMGR-FLAG protein were found only in apical meristematic tissue, suggesting post-translational regulation of potato HMGR affected by plant development. Protein immunoblots, and determination of enzymatic activity and transcript accumulation in the HMGR-FLAG transgenic and the non-transgenic parental plant lines, show that HMGR levels decrease dramatically in the dark. Again, the mechanism of this control occurs at a post-translational level. After 2.5 h in darkness, levels of HMGR-FLAG are approximately one-half of those in plants in the light; protein levels recover rapidly when dark-treated plants are returned to the light. In non-transgenic plants, hmg transcript levels are reduced in the dark, whereas dark treatments do not affect transgene hmg transcripts expressed under the control of a constitutive promoter. Furthermore, transcripts for HMGR-FLAG remain associated with polyribosomes in dark-treated tissues. Addition of inhibitors of cysteine proteases during microsomal protein extraction is required for recovery of immunoreactive HMGR-FLAG. The epitope-tagged isozyme has been used to show for the first time that a regulated decrease in plant HMGR activity correlates closely with a loss of the HMGR protein. We have used whole plants to demonstrate that developmental and light-regulated control of HMGR occurs post-translationally in vivo.",

Within 4 days of diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (MI) or unstable angina pectoris, all patients received dietary advice from a specially trained nurse. Subsequently, patients were randomized to 2 treatment groups: 1 group received immediate treatment with simvastatin 40 mg/d; patients in the other group received simvastatin 40 mg/d after 3 months only if their LDL-C remained >3.0 mmol/L.", 
    "27": "The immediate-simvastatin group (n = 73) and the deferred-simvastatin group (n = 78) were balanced with respect to baseline characteristics. Of the 151 patients, 25% were women, 25% had concomitant hypertension, and 75% had a diagnosis of MI on enrollment. At 3 months, 90% of the patients receiving dietary advice plus immediate simvastatin treatment had achieved the recommended European target LDL-C level of <3.0 mmol/L, compared with 7% of those treated with diet alone. By 6 months, when 92% of the study participants were receiving simvastatin 40 mg/d, the proportion of patients achieving target LDL-C levels was 92% in the group that received immediate simvastatin therapy and 81% in the group that received deferred simvastatin therapy. The reductions in LDL-C (42%-48%) were considered to be clinically comparable between the 2 groups at 12 months.", 
    "28": "On the basis of these results, we concluded that few patients with hypercholesterolemia and acute coronary syndromes reach the recommended European target LDL-C level of <3.0 mmol/L with dietary advice alone. However, early treatment with simvastatin 40 mg/d combined with dietary advice and follow-up at a dedicated outpatient clinic specializing in coronary heart disease resulted in 9 out of 10 patients reaching a recommended target LDL-C level of <3.0 mmol/L. Initiation of simvastatin therapy while a patient is hospitalized may increase the likelihood of the patient's lipid levels being managed according to current recommendations after he or she is discharged.", 
    "29": "1. Fluvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, has been reported to decrease the oxidizability of plasma lipids in hyperlipidaemic subjects. In order to elucidate one of the mechanisms of this in vivo, we investigated the effects of fluvastatin and pravastatin on the decreased turnovers of reduced glutathione (GSH) and ascorbic acid (AA) in Watanabe heritable hyperlipidaemic (WHHL) rabbits. 2. These drugs (30 mg/kg per day) equally decreased plasma levels of lipids after a 4 week treatment period. However, only fluvastatin significantly decreased thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, which were increased in the plasma of WHHL. 3. Although these drugs did not affect the steady state levels of total glutathione and low molecular weight thiols in the liver and kidney, fluvastatin markedly normalized the rate of GSH turnover in these tissues, as determined by using L-buthionine-(S,R)-sulphoximine, a specific inhibitor of GSH synthesis. 4. Fluvastatin also increased the clearance of AA from the circulation in WHHL. 5. These results suggest that, in addition to its hypolipidaemic action, fluvastatin has the potential to improve the turnover of anti-oxidants, which is closely related to the amelioration of the redox status in the body.",

A perplexing and unanswered question is whether low cholesterol is causally related to nonatherosclerotic disease risk. Cholesterol is reduced during the acute phase reaction; a state of immune activation that persists for more than 5 years may explain the prospective observations. Higher cholesterol may be a marker for other protective substances such as fat-soluble antioxidants. Low cholesterol might mark poor nutrition, for example, during depression. Alternatively, higher cholesterol levels may result in enhanced delivery of lipids to cells during the immune response or tissue repair or may enhance defense against endotoxins and viruses. Although we believe that populationwide efforts to lower cholesterol should continue, we think that important biology may be reflected in the repeatedly observed associations of low cholesterol with nonatherosclerotic disease. The authors urge that research continue to elucidate any biologic bases of these relations.", 
    "48": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGR), the key regulatory enzyme in the mevalonate (MVA) pathway, is rapidly degraded in mammalian cells supplemented with sterols or MVA. This accelerated turnover was blocked by N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal (ALLN), MG-132, and lactacystin, and to a lesser extent by N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-methional (ALLM), indicating the involvement of the 26 S proteasome. Proteasome inhibition led to enhanced accumulation of high molecular weight polyubiquitin conjugates of HMGR and of HMGal, a chimera between the membrane domain of HMGR and beta-galactosidase. Importantly, increased amounts of polyubiquitinated HMGR and HMGal were observed upon treating cells with sterols or MVA. Cycloheximide inhibited the sterol-stimulated degradation of HMGR concomitantly with a marked reduction in polyubiquitination of the enzyme. Inhibition of squalene synthase with zaragozic acid blocked the MVA- but not sterol-stimulated ubiquitination and degradation of HMGR. Thus, similar to yeast, the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is involved in the metabolically regulated turnover of mammalian HMGR. Yet, the data indicate divergence between yeast and mammals and suggest distinct roles for sterol and nonsterol metabolic signals in the regulated ubiquitination and degradation of mammalian HMGR.", 
    "49": "Patients with diabetes constitute a large group among patients with ischaemic heart disease, and their risk of repeated cardiovascular events is large. Due to this, there is increasing focus on intervention against the increased risk of cardiac morbidity and mortality in patients with diabetes. Subgroup analyses of patients with diabetes from studies on patients with ischaemic heart disease show that intervention with thrombolysis, aspirin, beta blockers, ACE inhibitors and statins have similar relative benefit among patients with diabetes, but because of the greater risk in these patients, the absolute benefit is increased. In spite of this, intervention is less common among patients with diabetes, a fact that should be corrected. Direct intervention targeted at the metabolic disorder in ischaemic heart disease has only been investigated in the DIGAMI study, where glucose/insulin treatment followed by long term treatment with insulin was compared to conventional treatment. The mortality was lower in the insulin treated group after one to four years of follow up, a promising result which is currently being investigated in the DIGAMI-2 study.", 
    "50": "The in vitro effect of a statin and an estrogen on oxidation of human LDL was investigated for the first time, comparing the monosubstances fluvastatin and 17beta-estradiol as well as the effect of the combination. Fluvastatin significantly delayed the onset of LDL oxidation (controls = 90 min) by 23 min at 1 microM, by 110 min and by 221 min at 5 and 10 microM, respectively. 17Beta-estradiol significantly impeded the onset by 70 min at 1 microM and by more than 300 min at 5 and 10 microM. The combination of 1 microM 17beta-estradiol with 1, 5 and 10 microM fluvastatin showed an additive antioxidative effect; the onset was delayed by 100 min, by 167 min and by more than 300 min, respectively.

    "52": "Previous reports of patients with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric aciduria have described the occurrence of di-trimethylsilyl (TMS) and tri-TMS derivatives of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid on analysis using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, leading to difficulty in quantification and ambiguity in diagnosis. We have extracted organic acids from the urine of patients with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric aciduria using a variety of procedures. Solvent extraction combined with hydrochloric acid/sodium chloride resulted in production of both di-TMS and tri-TMS derivatives of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric acid and also mono-TMS and di-TMS derivatives of 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid. The effects were not abolished by heating. Use of sulphate-based reagents minimised artefact formation and use of DEAE-Sephadex anion exchange extraction resulted in single fully trimethylsilylated derivatives. Artefact formation during use of chloride-based reagents was abolished by pyridine added prior to trimethylsilylation. Chloride ions form adducts with hydroxyl groups in these 3-hydroxy-3-methyl carboxylic acids that prevent complete trimethylsilylation. Chloride-based reagents should be avoided in the solvent extraction of organic acids from physiological fluids or, if used, pre-treatment of the dried extract with pyridine is essential to avoid partial trimethylsilylation of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl carboxylic acids.", 
    "53": "Previous reports have suggested that elevated levels of phenylalanine inhibit cholesterol synthesis. The goals of this study were to investigate if perturbations in cholesterol synthesis exist in the PAH(enu2) genetic mouse model for phenylketonuria (PKU), and if so, initiate studies determining if they might underlie the white matter pathology that exists in PKU forebrain. Gross sections and electron microscopy showed that select tracts were hypomyelinated in adult PKU mouse forebrain but not hindbrain. The activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR), the rate controlling enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, was examined in isolated microsomes from forebrain, hindbrain, and liver to assess if perturbations in cholesterol biosynthesis were occurring. HMGR activity was normal in unaffected PKU hindbrain and was increased 2-4-fold in PKU liver compared to control. HMGR activity in the forebrain, however, was decreased by 30%. Because normal numbers of MBP-expressing glia (oligodendrocytes) were present, but the number of glia expressing HMGR was reduced by 40% in the hypomyelinated tracts, the decreased HMGR activity seemed to result from a down-regulation of HMGR expression in affected oligodendrocytes. Exposure of an oligodendrocyte-like glioma cell line to physiologically relevant elevated levels of Phe resulted in a 30% decrease in cholesterol synthesis, a 28% decrease in microsomal HMGR activity, and a 28% decrease in HMGR protein levels. Measurement of HMGR activity after addition of exogenous Phe to control brain microsomes revealed that Phe is a noncompetitive inhibitor of HMGR; physiologically relevant elevated levels of exogenous Phe inhibited HMGR activity by 30%. Taken together, these data suggest that HMGR is moderately inhibited in the PKU mouse. Unlike other cell types in the body, a subset of oligodendrocytes in the forebrain seems to be unable to overcome this inhibition. We speculate that this may be the cause of the observed pathology in PKU brain.", 
    "54": "The clinical efficacy of NK-104, a novel and totally synthetic hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, was assessed in 30 patients (men/women = 15/15, mean age 51 years) with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. After a placebo phase of >4 weeks, NK-104 was given at an initial dose of 2 mg/day for 8 weeks, which was increased to 4 mg/day for a further 8 weeks. As a result of 2 mg/day of NK-104 treatment, mean +/- SD of total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased significantly (p<0.0001) from baseline, namely from 8.80+/-1.38 to 6.11+/-1.09 mmol/L (-31%) and from 6.81+/-1.52 to 4.09+/-1.03 mmol/L (-40%), respectively. They decreased further (p<0.0001) as a result of 4-mg/day administration, to 5.52+/-0.81 mmol/L (-37%) and 3.55+/-0.85 mmol/L (-48%), respectively. Changes in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels failed to reach statistical significance. Serum triglyceride levels decreased significantly (p<0.0001) from baseline as a result of 4 mg/day of NK-104, from 1.99+/-1.72 to 1.35+/-0.90 mmol/L (-23%). Serum apolipoprotein B, CII, CIII, and E levels significantly decreased: mean changes from baseline at the end of the study were -41% (p<0.0001), -27% (p<0.0001), -19% (p = 0.002), and -37% (p<0.0001), respectively. On the other hand, apolipoprotein AI and All levels significantly increased as a result of the treatment: + 10% (p = 0.002) and +6% (p = 0.008), respectively. There were no adverse events observed in either clinical or laboratory findings that could be attributed to the treatment. These results suggest that the potency of NK-104 appears to be dose-dependent, and that NK-104 is safe and well tolerated in the treatment of patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, and thus also provides a new therapeutic choice for subjects requiring lipid-modifying therapy.", 
    "55": "Diabetics have a greatly increased risk for cardiovascular disease. At the center of the pathogenesis is the elevated blood sugar, insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. Treatment must therefore be aimed at controlling glucose metabolism (HBA1c < 7.0%) and lipid metabolism (LDL conc < 100 mg/dL, triglycerides < 150 mg/dL). Blood pressure should not exceed 130/85 mmHg. In addition to changes in lifestyle--low-fat, calorie-controlled diet and increased physical activity--lipid-lowering medication can rarely be done without. On the basis of the results of large interventional studies, the CSE inhibitors are particularly to be recommended. While the domain of the fibrates is the lowering of triglycerides, no comparative data on the usefulness of this group of substances are currently available.", 
    "56": "All statins have been shown to reduce plasma cholesterol concentrations significantly. Cardioprotective effects of these drugs appear to be mainly due to cholesterol lowering. It remains unclear whether pharmacokinetic differences of statins are of clinical relevance. The clinical studies with statins performed on more than 30,000 individuals demonstrate that lipid lowering drug therapy not only reduces cardiovascular complications but also is a safe and well tolerated long-term therapy. However, the majority of patients who should be treated according to appropriate guidelines, still do not receive any cholesterol lowering therapy. Therefore, it is a main goal that at least high-risk patients (e.g. with coronary heart disease or diabetes mellitus type 2) should be treated with statins.", 
    "57": "The availability of treatment guidelines has revolutionised our approach to detection, evaluation and treatment of dyslipidaemias in adults. Such guidelines focus on lowering low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), the primary risk factor for coronary heart disease, and provide physicians with specific goals to be attained by dietary and, if necessary, pharmacological therapy. However, the guidelines were published in 1993, which means that the pivotal findings from large intervention trials with statins were not included. This has led to calls for the guidelines to be amended to take into account the findings of these studies and other evolving issues such as the pathogenesis of the acute coronary event and the contribution of low HDL-C and other lipid parameters. More importantly, the mostly epidemiological basis of the guidelines has instilled the concept that the lower the LDL-C level after lipid-lowering intervention the better the result in terms of prevention of coronary events. Available data now refute this assumption. Indeed, maximal therapeutic benefit is already obtained with a decrease in LDL-C level of 20-30%, irrespective of baseline levels or LDL-C levels on treatment and, until now, there have been no data to suggest that decreases in LDL-C of > 30% give any additional benefit to patients in terms of improving their long-term outcome. The concept of absolute LDL-C treatment goals therefore needs to be revisited. A more appropriate goal of lipid-lowering therapy with statins is to ensure LDL-C levels are reduced by 20-30%, with statin dosages as used in the intervention trials. Furthermore, there are insufficient data to advise that LDL-C levels should be lowered to 2.6 mmol/l. This issue will be resolved only when the results of the appropriate intervention trials are published.", 
    "58": "The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of pravastatin treatment on lipid, inflammation, and coagulation parameters in patients suffering from myocardial infarction with or without carotid atherosclerotic lesions (groups 1 and 2, respectively).", 
    "59": "In the first phase of the study, a cross-sectional comparison of lipid, inflammation, and coagulation parameters was performed between the patients and the control group (group 3). Highly significant differences in these parameters were observed, especially in group 1. In the second phase of the study, we assessed the effects of a persistent reduction in cholesterol synthesis induced by increasing doses of pravastatin (20 mg daily for 8 weeks and 40 mg daily for a further 8 weeks). In addition to the well-established lipid-lowering effect, significant changes in inflammation and coagulation parameters were observed. In particular, pravastatin at a dosage of 20 mg/ day significantly reduced only fibrinogen levels, while at a dosage of 40 mg/day significantly reduced factor VII, fibrinogen, prothrombin fragments 1 and 2, thrombin-antithrombin complexes, tissue plasminogen activator antigen (tPA:Ag) before venous occlusion (b.o.), inhibitor of plasminogen activator activity (PAI) b.o., PAI activity after occlusion (a.o.), the human autoantibodies against oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and the c fraction of the third component system levels, and significantly increased tPA:Ag a.o. levels.", 
    "60": "Our results show that in patients suffering from myocardial infarction the risk of thrombotic complications can be decreased with pravastatin, especially by larger doses. However, the relationship must be further investigated because the observed reductions in the hemostatic system and inflammatory response seemed to be dose dependent, while the effects of pravastatin treatment were not significantly correlated with total and LDL cholesterol changes.", 
    "61": "There is little information about the effect of an alteration of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) turnover on chylomicron and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) metabolism, yet chylomicron remnant particles are thought to be particularly atherogenic. This study examined the effect of inhibition of cholesterol synthesis on postprandial lipoproteins. Eight type 2 diabetic patients were examined before treatment with the 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A (HMGCoA) reductase inhibitor cerivastatin, after 4 weeks on active treatment, and 4 weeks after stopping treatment. On each occasion, blood was collected fasting and at 2-hour intervals for up to 8 hours after a high-fat meal. Chylomicrons and VLDLs were isolated by sequential ultracentrifugation. Compositional analysis was performed including the measurement of apolipoprotein B48 (apo B48) and apo B100 using polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis. During statin treatment, there was a significant reduction in the postprandial chylomicron apo B48 area under the curve (AUC) from 23 +/- 16 to 17 +/- 10 (P < .01) and apo B100 in the chylomicron fraction from 166 +/- 148 to 70 +/- 70 (P < .05). Postprandial cholesterol (362 +/- 193 to 74 +/- 39, P < .005), triglyceride (2,222 +/- 1,440 to 746 +/- 329), and phospholipid (518 +/- 267 to 205 +/- 94) also decreased (P < .005). In the VLDL fraction, the postprandial cholesterol and triglyceride AUC were significantly reduced by statin (316 +/- 228 to 171 +/- 78, P < .05, and 1,733 +/- 833 to 857 +/- 468, P < .02, respectively). Four weeks after cessation of treatment, the chylomicron fraction triglyceride AUC had returned to the pretreatment level, but postprandial chylomicron cholesterol and VLDL cholesterol, triglyceride, and phospholipid were significantly lower than baseline (P < .05). Plasma total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol were significantly reduced with treatment (6.2 +/- 0.5 to 4.3 +/- 1.0 mmol/L, P < .001, and 4.5 +/- 0.4 to 2.8 +/- 1.0 mmol/L, P < .01, respectively) and returned to baseline following cessation of treatment. Fasting plasma triglycerides decreased significantly on treatment (2.4 +/- 1.0 to 1.7 +/- 0.2 mmol/L, P < .05) but remained significantly lower than baseline 4 weeks later (1.8 +/- 0.3 mmol/L, P < .05). This study suggests major postprandial lipoprotein changes on statin therapy which may account, in part, for the beneficial effects of statins in the prevention of myocardial infarction.", 
    "62": "Homocysteinemia is regarded as a risk factor for vascular disease. Several risk factors and diseases, but also various drugs, amongst them some lipid lowering medications, have been shown to increase plasma homocysteine concentrations. We therefore assessed the influence of simvastatin on plasma homocysteine levels in 57 patients suffering from severe familial heterozygous hypercholesterolemia. After 1, 3 and 6 months of simvastatin therapy plasma homocysteine levels did not show any change compared to the levels before therapy. Males had typically higher homocysteine levels than females and concentrations in smokers were in most subgroups significantly higher than in non-smokers. No difference in patients taking either 20 or 40 mg simvastatin was apparent and no correlation to the lipid lowering action was found. These findings indicate that in contrast to a number of other lipid lowering agents, simvastatin does not affect plasma homocysteine levels.", 
    "63": "Malignant astrocytomas are the most common primary intracranial human tumors. All therapeutic approaches are limited due to their high proliferative capacity and their ability to diffusely invade the brain. Amplification of tyrosine kinase receptors and their signaling pathways have been implicated as contributing to the molecular pathogenesis of astrocytomas, providing possible new targets for therapeutic intervention. In particular, astrocytomas, although lacking oncogenic Ras mutations, have elevated levels of activated Ras. Lovastatin, an inhibitor of the beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutary CoA reductase (HMG-CoA-reductase), is currently used to treat patients with hypercholesterolemia. In addition, it inhibits isoprenylation of several members of the Ras superfamily of proteins and therefore has multiple cellular effects including the reduction of proliferation.", 
    "64": "In this study, we investigated the impact of lovastatin on two human glioma cell lines and on 15 primary cell cultures established from biopsies of patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM,) Proliferation of glioma cell lines and primary tumor cells was determined by cell counting and by using the MTT assay. The cell morphology was analyzed by staining of actin filaments with phalloidin. Apoptosis was measured using the TUNEL assay. To investigate the influence of this drug on glioma cell motility, tumor cell migration was investigated using three dimensional spheroid disintegration assays. In addition, tumor cell invasion was analyzed with a confrontational assay between tumor spheroids and rat brain aggregates.", 
    "65": "Inhibition of farnesyl biosynthesis using lovastatin led to a block in Ras mediated signaling, indicated by lower MAPK activity. Consequently, tumor cell proliferation was reduced up to 80%. Lovastatin appeared to decrease glioma viability by inducing apoptosis, as indicated by morphological changes and increase of TUNEL positive cells. Lovastatin acts through isoprenoid depletion, because supplementation of the media with 50-100 microM mevalonate restored all tau eta epsilon effects. Invasion of tumor cells into brain tissue was not effected while migration was reduced beta upsilon about 30-40% in cells treated with high concentrations (> or = 100 microM) of lovastatin. This was surprising because drug treatment at lower concentrations led to a disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, as indicated by Phalloidin staining.", 
    "66": "Our data strongly suggest that inhibition of elevated Ras activity by lovastatin effectively targets the MAPK and probably other signaling pathways thus offering a pharmacological based approach for a potential treatment of human astrocytomas.",

    "68": "In this randomized, double-blind study, we compared the effect of 6 months of simvastatin (40 mg/d) treatment with that of placebo on coronary endothelial vasomotor function in 60 patients with coronary artery disease. Simvastatin lowered LDL-cholesterol by 40+/-12% from 130+/-28 mg/dL (P<0.001). Peak intracoronary acetylcholine infusion produced epicardial coronary constriction at baseline in both the simvastatin (-17+/-13%) and placebo (-24+/-16%) groups. After treatment, acetylcholine produced less constriction in both groups (-12+/-19% and -15+/-14%, respectively, P=0.97). The increase in coronary blood flow during infusion of the peak dose of substance P was blunted at baseline in both the simvastatin (42+/-50%) and placebo (55+/-71%) groups, reflecting impaired endothelium-dependent dilation of coronary microvessels. After treatment, the flow increase was 82+/-81% in the simvastatin group and 63+/-53% in the placebo group (P=0.16).", 
    "69": "Six months of cholesterol-lowering therapy has no significant effect on coronary endothelial vasomotor function in the study population of patients with coronary artery disease and mildly elevated cholesterol levels.

In each study, 12 healthy volunteers were given a 4-day pretreatment with oral fluconazole (400 mg on day 1 and 200 mg on days 2-4) or placebo, according to a randomisation schedule. On day 4, a single oral dose of 40 mg fluvastatin (study I) or 40 mg pravastatin (study II) was administered orally. Plasma concentrations of fluvastatin, pravastatin and fluconazole were measured over 24 h.", 
    "72": "In study 1, fluconazole increased the mean area under the plasma fluvastatin concentration-time curve (AUC0-infinity) by 84% (P < 0.01), the mean elimination half-life (t1/2) of fluvastatin by 80% (P < 0.01) and its mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by 44% (P < 0.05). In study II, fluconazole had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin.", 
    "73": "Fluconazole has a significant interaction with fluvastatin. The mechanism of the increased plasma concentrations and prolonged elimination of fluvastatin is probably inhibition of the CYP2C9-mediated metabolism of fluvastatin by fluconazole. Care should be taken if fluconazole or other potent inhibitors of CYP2C9 are prescribed to patients using fluvastatin. However, pravastatin is not susceptible to interactions with fluconazole or other potent CYP2C9 inhibitors.",

Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level was lower at the end of the trial than at follow-up (3.6 +/- 1.5 vs. 4.6 +/- 2.2 mmol L-1; P = 0.01) and was higher in the group taking a low dose of a statin alone compared with other drug groups. Thus, two-thirds of the subjects required adjustment of lipid-lowering drugs to reach target lipid levels. One-fifth consumed at least two food groups rich in saturated fat regularly. Body mass index (BMI) increased from 25.6 +/- 2.9 to 26.8 +/- 3.3 kg m-2 (P < 0.001). Five subjects compared with one at baseline had type II diabetes or glucose intolerance; 12 compared with four at baseline had a blood pressure of >/= 160 mmHg systolic or >/= 95 mmHg diastolic. Plasma total homocysteine was higher in subjects with coronary artery disease than in subjects without disease (11.7 +/- 3.9 vs. 9.0 +/- 2.3 micromol L-1; P = 0.01). Barriers to testing for lipids amongst children or siblings included family feuds, fear of increased insurance and psychiatric disease.", 
    "77": "The majority of subjects were undertreated. Increases in BMI, blood pressure and glucose levels and the diet posed challenges to risk reduction. Plasma homocysteine levels should be considered in this group. Testing of all first-degree relatives may not be achievable because of psychological barriers.", 
    "78": "We examined the effects of four 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (pravastatin, simvastatin, fluvastatin, and cerivastatin) on the production and expression of inflammatory cytokines and on enzyme expression involving prostaglandin and superoxide production in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). All HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors significantly reduced interleukin-1beta and -6 mRNA expression and their protein levels in the culture medium, and also inhibited cyclooxygenase-2 mRNA expression and their protein levels. And these drugs induced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) and PPARgamma mRNA expression and their protein levels in HUVEC and hepatocyte. Moreover, the mRNA levels of p22phox, a 22-kD subunit and the protein levels of p47phox, a 47-kD subunit of nicotine adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, was decreased by treatment with either simvastatin, fluvastatin or cerivastatin, and this effect was reversed by mevalonate, geranylgeraniol, farnesol, and cholesterol. The changes induced by HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors might be due to regulation of cellular cholesterol content level, cellular cholesterol metabolic pathway, and cellular PPARalpha activity, which was related with inflammation. This unique anti-inflammatory effect in addition to its hypolipidemic action, may be beneficial in preventing the vascular complications that are induced by hyperlipidemia.", 
    "79": "In this randomized, double-blind, parallel group study, the efficacy and safety of cerivastatin (0.3 mg) and pravastatin (20 mg) were compared in 402 patients with primary hypercholesterolemia with and without documented coronary heart disease or peripheral vascular disease. After 8 weeks of treatment, cerivastatin provided significantly greater reductions than pravastatin in low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (31.1% vs. 26.0%; p < 0.0001) and total cholesterol (21.1% vs. 17.8%; p < 0.0001). A greater proportion of patients treated with cerivastatin than pravastatin achieved > 30% and > 40% reductions from baseline in LDL-cholesterol. Both agents also increased high density lipoprotein-cholesterol and reduced triglycerides. Overall, 65.1% of patients treated with cerivastatin and 63.3% of patients with pravastatin achieved LDL-cholesterol goals defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program. Both drugs were well tolerated, with most adverse events being mild. These results demonstrate that cerivastatin (0.3 mg) is a highly effective 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, which enables a large proportion of patients to achieve clinically meaningful reductions in LDL-cholesterol.", 
    "80": "Endothelial cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) E-selectin, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1 play variably important roles in immune-mediated processes. They are induced by the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 and TNF-alpha, and NF-kappaB is required for the regulated expression of all three genes. Regulators of this pathway could potentially be potent immune modulators. We studied the effect of a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, simvastatin, on cytokine-induced expression of CAMs in HUVEC. Unexpectedly, pretreatment with simvastatin potentiated the induction of all three endothelial CAMs by IL-1 and TNF, but not LPS or PMA, as detected by flow cytometry. Northern blot analysis demonstrated an increase in steady state IL-1-induced E-selectin mRNA levels in cells pretreated with simvastatin. This was associated with an increase in nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB, as detected by EMSA. The effect of simvastatin was reversed by mevalonate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate but not squalene, indicating that an inhibitory prenylated protein is involved in endothelial responses to proinflammatory cytokines. Pertussis toxin mimicked the effect of simvastatin, and the G protein activator NaF inhibited the cytokine-induced expression of endothelial CAMs, indicating that a Gialpha protein is involved. These results demonstrate that cytokine-mediated activation of the endothelium, and specifically CAM induction, can be modulated by a heterotrimeric G protein-coupled pathway. This may represent a \"basal tone\" of endothelial inactivation, which can either be disinhibited or amplified, depending on the stimulus.", 
    "81": "HMG CoA reductase inhibitors reduce cellular availability of mevalonate, a precursor in cholesterol synthesis. Since the cholesterol content of cell membranes is an important determinant of Na(+)-K(+) pump function we speculated that treatment with HMG CoA reductase inhibitors affects Na(+)-K(+) pump activity.",

    "85": "Mixed hyperlipidemia is characterized by both elevated total cholesterol and triglycerides. It is estimated to account for 10% to 20% of patients with dyslipidemia. This study assessed the lipid-altering efficacy and tolerability of simvastatin 40 and 80 mg/day as monotherapy. One hundred thirty patients (62 women [48%], 24 [16%] with type 2 diabetes mellitus, mean age 53 years) with mixed hyperlipidemia (baseline low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol 156 mg/dl [mean], and triglycerides 391 mg/dl [median) were randomized in a multicenter, double-masked, placebo-controlled, 3-period, 22-week, balanced crossover study, and received placebo, and simvastatin 40 and 80 mg/day each for 6 weeks. Compared with placebo, simvastatin produced significant (p <0.01) and dose-dependent changes in all lipid and lipoprotein parameters (LDL cholesterol 2.1%, -28.9%, and -35.5%; triglycerides -3.5%, -27.8%, and -33.0%; high-density lipoprotein cholesterol 3.3%, 13.1%, and 15. 7%; apolipoprotein B 3.8%, -23.1%, and -30.6%; and apolipoprotein A-I 4.0%, 8.2%, and 10.5% with placebo, and simvastatin 40 and 80 mg/day, respectively). The changes were consistent in patients with diabetes mellitus. One patient taking simvastatin 80 mg/day had an asymptomatic and reversible increase in hepatic transaminases 3 times above the upper limit of normal. Simvastatin 40 and 80 mg/day is effective in patients with mixed hyperlipidemia across the entire lipid and lipoprotein profile. The reductions in LDL cholesterol and triglycerides are large, significant, and dose dependent. The increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was greater than that observed in patients with hypercholesterolemia, and appears dose dependent.", 
    "86": "The Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is caused by deficient Delta(7)-dehydrocholesterol reductase, which catalyzes the final step of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, resulting in low cholesterol and high concentrations of its direct precursors 7-dehydrocholesterol (7DHC) and 8DHC. We hypothesized that i) 7DHC and 8DHC accumulation contributes to the poor outcome of SLOS patients and ii) blood exchange transfusions with hydroxymethylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase inhibition would improve the precursor-to-cholesterol ratio and may improve the clinical outcome of SLO patients. First, an in vitro study was performed to study sterol exchange between plasma and erythrocyte membranes. Second, several exchange transfusions were carried out in vivo in two SLOS patients. Third, simvastatin was given for 23 and 14 months to two patients. The in vitro results illustrated rapid sterol exchange between plasma and erythrocyte membranes. The effect of exchange transfusion was impressive and prompt but the effect on plasma sterol levels lasted only for 3 days. In contrast, simvastatin treatment for several months demonstrated a lasting improvement of the precursor-to-cholesterol ratio in plasma, erythrocyte membranes, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Plasma precursor concentrations decreased to 28 and 33% of the initial level, respectively, whereas the cholesterol concentration normalized by a more than twofold increase. During the follow-up period all morphometric parameters improved. The therapy was well tolerated and no unwanted clinical side effects occurred. This is the first study in which the blood cholesterol level in SLOS patients is normalized with a simultaneous significant decrease in precursor levels. There was a lasting biochemical improvement with encouraging clinical improvement. Statin therapy is a promising novel approach in SLOS that deserves further studies in larger series of patients.", 
    "87": "Development of severe sepsis is thought to result from the overproduction of cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), and nitric oxide. Recently, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, which are antihypercholesterolemic agents, have been reported to inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced production of cytokines and nitric oxide in vitro. In this study, we tested these effects in vivo. After LPS administration (15 mg/kg i.p.) to CD-1 mice, serum levels of both TNF-alpha and IL-1beta transiently increased, and peaked at 2 h. After the peak responses of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta, serum levels of nitrite and nitrate increased until at least 8 h. Pretreatment of the mice with cerivastatin (20 mg/kg i.p. 12 and 1 h before LPS injection) reduced serum levels of TNF-alpha and IL-1beta at 2 h, and nitrite and nitrate at 8 h, by 93, 60, and 44%, respectively. In this model of sepsis, cerivastatin significantly (P =.016) improved the rate of 7-day survival from 26.7 to 73.3%. These results cast new light on the usefulness of cerivastatin in preventing severe sepsis.", 
    "88": "Statin therapy has been conclusively shown to offer patients clinical benefit, virtually irrespective of their baseline risk status. However, the absolute risk reductions observed in different clinical trials, which have recruited patients across a spectrum of lipid levels and vascular disease states, show that baseline global risk determines the absolute benefit gained and in turn will specify the number of patients needed to be treated in order to realize this benefit. Global risk assessment is therefore central to the clinically meaningful use of statin therapy, and a strong case is now argued in the literature for a high-risk primary prevention strategy that goes hand in hand with standard secondary prevention. The routine use of Framingham-based risk assessment tools is advocated because these are the most widely evaluated and have been repeatedly shown to predict the risk of coronary heart disease accurately in western populations. The risk threshold in primary prevention that should determine pharmacological intervention is the subject of controversy. The currently used annual risk figure of 3% would clearly capture all very high-risk individuals but would also deny treatment to many individuals who will subsequently die from their first coronary event. Although a 1.5% annual risk threshold is economically untenable in the present UK health system, a level of 2% is, we believe, both achievable and affordable.", 
    "89": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) are effective treatments for the primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease, but an outstanding issue is determining who should have such treatment. The benefit from treatment with statins appears to be proportional to the underlying risk of coronary heart disease and independent of the factors increasing risk. Most benefit will therefore be achieved by treating people at increased risk of coronary heart disease. Statins reduce coronary morbidity even when the risk of coronary heart disease is relatively low (6% over 10 years), but reduction in all-cause mortality, the true measure of safety has been shown only when the risk of a major coronary heart disease event is 15% over 10 years or greater. At this level of risk patients appear willing to take treatment to gain the benefit expected from statin treatment, and the cost effectiveness of statin treatment is within the range accepted for other treatments. The major impediments to the systematic introduction of statin treatment at this level of risk are the very high overall cost and the large workload in countries like Britain, where the population risk of coronary heart disease is high. For this reason, recent British guidelines correctly advise statin treatment for secondary prevention and primary prevention when the 10 year coronary heart disease risk is 30% or greater as the first priority, moving to a lower coronary heart disease threshold for primary prevention only when resources permit.", 
    "90": "In the mortality statistics behind the coronary heart disease and cancer the stroke is the third leading cause of death. The risk factors of stroke and coronary heart disease are similar, but in a recent meta-analysis (Prospective Studies Collaboration) on 450,000 patients from 45 studies didn't find close correlation between the occurrence of stroke and the cholesterol level. In the Multiple Risk Factor Intervention Trial the incidence of haemorrhagic and non-haemorrhagic stroke was analysed separately and a significant correlation has been found between the high cholesterol level and occurrence of the non-haemorrhagic stroke. The great statin trials in a large scale of patients' groups (different cholesterol and risk levels at the inclusion) beside the decline of coronary events proved a decrease in stroke incidence too. The mechanism of action of the statins on stroke is not known: beside the cholesterol lowering effect the so called pleiotropic effects (plaque stabilisation, improvement of endothelial dysfunction and antithrombotic properties) and a direct effect on vascular tone could get importance. The fact that statins could improve the incidence of coronary events with 24-34%, that of stroke with 10-31%, suggests, that this drugs has to be used more frequently in the clinical practice.", 
    "91": "The objective of this study was to estimate the long-term costs and benefits of treating hyperlipidemia among diabetic patients with and without known cardiovascular disease after validating the Cardiovascular Life Expectancy Model.", 
    "92": "The model estimates were compared with the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S) and used to estimate the long-term costs and benefits of treatment with simvastatin. Simulations were performed for men and women, 40 to 70 years of age, having pretreatment LDL cholesterol values of 5.46, 4.34, and 3.85 mmol/L (211, 168, and 149 mg/dL). We forecasted the long-term risk of cardiovascular events, the need for medical and surgical interventions, and the associated costs in 1996 US dollars. The model validated well against the observed results of the of the 4S diabetic patients. In this validation, the model estimates fell within the 95% confidence interval of the observed results for 7 of the 8 available end points (coronary deaths, total deaths, and so forth). Treatment with simvastatin for patients with cardiovascular disease is cost-effective for men and women, with or without diabetes. Among diabetic individuals without cardiovascular disease, the benefits of primary prevention were also substantial and the cost-effectiveness ratios attractive across a wide range of assumptions ( approximately $4000 to $40 000 per year of life saved). These conclusions were robust even among diabetics with lower baseline LDL values and smaller LDL reductions as observed in the Cholesterol and Recruitment Events (CARE) trial.",

    "94": "Lovastatin, a competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, reportedly inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of tumor cells with MDR-1 coded P-glycoprotein (Pgp) expression. In this study we investigated the sensitivity to lovastatin of eight myeloid leukemia cell lines: K562, NOMO-1, NB4 and its retinoic acid (RA) resistant subline NB4/RA, and their multidrug-resistant (MDR) sublines: K562/ADR, NOMO-1/ADR, NB4/MDR and NB4/RA/MDR. MTT and apoptosis assays revealed that K562/ADR, NOMO-1/ADR and NB4/RA/MDR were more sensitive to lovastatin than their parental cell lines, while NB4/MDR showed the same level of sensitivity as parental NB4 cells, which already were very sensitive to lovastatin. Significant elevation of transcript levels of HMG-CoA reductase was observed by semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis in more than three lovastatin-sensitive MDR sublines, but not in NB4/MDR compared with the parental cell lines. HMG-CoA reductase mRNA levels were up-regulated more than two-fold by the exposure to lovastatin in all of the parental non-Pgp-expressing cell lines. In NB4/MDR, HMG-CoA reductase mRNA level was elevated to a similar extent as in parental NB4, whereas in three other MDR sublines which showed preferential sensitivity to lovastatin, their HMG-CoA reductase mRNA levels were not significantly elevated after 24- and 48-h treatment with lovastatin. These results indicate a connection between drug resistance and regulation of the mevalonate pathway, and further strengthen the clinical possibility that drug resistant leukemias would be susceptible to treatment with lovastatin.", 
    "95": "Statin drugs, which are cholesterol-lowering agents, can upregulate endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) in isolated endothelial cells independent of lipid lowering. We investigated the effect of short-term simvastatin administration on NO-mediated regulation of myocardial oxygen consumption (MV(O2)) in tissue from rat hearts. Male Wistar rats were divided into (a) control group (n = 14), and (b) simvastatin group (n = 10, 20 mg/kg/day by oral gavage). After 2 weeks, left ventricular myocardium was isolated to measure MV(O2) using a Clark-type oxygen electrode, and aortic plasma nitrates and nitrites (NOx) were measured. Baseline plasma NOx levels (19+/-2.6 in control vs. 20+/-2.5 microM/L in simvastatin) and baseline MV(O2) (288+/-23 in control vs. 252+/-11 nmol/g/min; p = 0.09) were not significantly different between the two groups. NO-dependent regulation of MV(O2) in response to bradykinin, ramipril, or amlodipine was augmented in simvastatin rats compared with controls (p < 0.05). Decrease of MV(O2) from baseline in response to highest doses in control versus simvastatin groups was as follows-bradykinin, -28+/-5% vs. -44+/-6%; ramipril, -35+/-5% vs. -50+/-8%; and amlodipine, -32+/-9% vs. -42+/-3%. Response to highest dose of NO donor S-nitroso N-acetyl penicillamine (SNAP) was not significantly different in the two groups (-55+/-5% vs. -52+/-7%). Treatment with Nw-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, inhibitor of NO synthesis, attenuated the effect of bradykinin, ramipril, and amlodipine on MV(O2) (p < 0.05). In conclusion, short-term administration of simvastatin in rats potentiates the ability of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and amlodipine to cause NO-mediated regulation of MV(O2).", 
    "96": "We conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis to compare costs and clinical outcomes of sevelamer versus calcium carbonate plus atorvastatin for treatment of dyslipidemia in patients with chronic renal insufficiency. The model was from the third-party payer perspective. Efficacy and adverse event rates for each regimen were obtained from published clinical trials. Drug costs were based on average wholesale prices; monitoring costs were based on Medicare reimbursement rates. Our model suggests that the combination of calcium carbonate plus atorvastatin is substantially more cost-effective than sevelamer in reducing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in these patients. One-way sensitivity analyses were performed to assess if 25% and 50% price reductions in sevelamer affected overall cost-effectiveness results. A 50% sevelamer price reduction was less expensive than combination therapy but remained less cost-effective. A two-way sensitivity analysis on the probability that a patient achieves the goal of a 35% LDL reduction resulted in calcium carbonate plus atorvastatin remaining more cost-effective. Further cost-effectiveness studies are necessary to corroborate our data.", 
    "97": "This randomized, double-blind study was undertaken to compare the efficacy and tolerability of policosanol (10 mg/day) and lovastatin (20 mg/day) in patients with hypercholesterolemia and noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus. After 6 weeks on a lipid lowering diet, 53 patients were randomized to receive either policosanol or lovastatin tablets that were taken o.i.d. for 12 weeks under double-blind conditions. Both groups were similar at randomization. Policosanol significantly (p < 0.001) lowered low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (20.4%), total cholesterol (14.2%) and the ratio of LDL-cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (23.7%). Lovastatin significantly (p < 0.01) lowered LDL-cholesterol (16.8%), total cholesterol (14.0%) and the ratio (p < 0.05) of LDL-cholesterol to HDL-cholesterol (14.9%). Triglyceride levels did not significantly change after therapy. Policosanol, but not lovastatin, significantly increased (p < 0.01) levels of HDL-cholesterol (7.5%). Comparison between groups showed that changes in HDL-cholesterol induced by policosanol were significantly greater (p < 0.01) than those induced by lovastatin. Both treatments were safe and well tolerated. Lovastatin moderately but significantly (p < 0.05) increased levels of aspartate aminotransferase, creatine phosphokinase and alkaline phosphatase. Adverse reactions were more frequent in the lovastatin group (p < 0.01) than in the policosanol group. In conclusion, policosanol administered at 10 mg/day produces more advantageous changes in HDL-cholesterol and has a better safety and tolerability profile than lovastatin 20 mg/day.", 
    "98": "This randomized, double-blind study was undertaken to compare the effects of policosanol and pravastatin administered at 10 mg/day on lipid profile, platelet aggregation and endothelemia in older patients with type II hypercholesterolemia and high coronary risk. After 6 weeks on a lipid-lowering diet, patients with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels > 3.4 mmol/l were randomized to receive, under double-blind conditions, policosanol or pravastatin 10 mg tablets that were taken with the evening meal for 8 weeks. Policosanol significantly (p < 0.00001) lowered LDL-cholesterol (19.3%), total cholesterol (13.9%) and the ratios of LDL-cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (28.3%) and total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol (24.4%). Pravastatin significantly (p < 0.00001) lowered LDL-cholesterol (15.6%), total cholesterol (11.8%) and the ratios (p < 0.0001) of LDL-cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol (18.9%) and total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol (15.7%). Policosanol, but not pravastatin, significantly increased (p < 0.001) levels of HDL-cholesterol (18.4%) and reduced (p < 0.01) triglycerides (14.1%). Policosanol was more effective (p < 0.05) than pravastatin in inhibiting platelet aggregation induced by all agonists and it significantly reduced (p < 0.0001) platelet aggregation induced by arachidonic acid at 1.5 and 3 mmol/l by 42.2% and 69.5%, respectively, platelet aggregation induced by collagen 0.5 microgram/ml (p < 0.05) (16.6%) and that induced by adenosine diphosphate 1 mumol/l (p < 0.01) (20.3%). Pravastatin significantly reduced (p < 0.001) (27%) only platelet aggregation induced by arachidonic acid 3 mmol/l. Both drugs significantly decreased (p < 0.00001) endothelemia levels but final values were significantly lower (p < 0.001) in the policosanol than in the pravastatin group. Both treatments were safe and well tolerated. Pravastatin significantly (p < 0.01) increased serum levels of alanine amine transferase but individual values remained within normal. Two patients on pravastatin discontinued the study because of adverse experiences (myocardial infarction and jaundice, respectively). In conclusion, the effects of policosanol (10 mg/day) on lipid profile, platelet aggregation and endothelemia in older patients with type II hypercholesterolemia and high coronary risk are more favorable than those induced by the same doses of pravastatin.", 
    "99": "Growth inhibition of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L. cv Bright Yellow-2) cells by mevinolin, a specific inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) could be partially overcome by the addition of farnesol. However, farnesol alone inhibited cell division and growth as measured by determination of fresh weight increase. When 7-d-old tobacco cv Bright Yellow-2 cells were diluted 40-fold into fresh culture, the cells exhibited a dose-dependent sensitivity to farnesol, with 25 microM sufficient to cause 100% cell death, as measured by different staining techniques, cytometry, and monitoring of fragmentation of genomic DNA. Cells were less sensitive to the effects of farnesol when diluted only 4-fold. Farnesol was absorbed by the cells, as examined by [1-(3)H]farnesol uptake, with a greater relative enrichment by the more diluted cells. Both mevinolin and farnesol treatments stimulated apparent HMGR activity. The stimulation by farnesol was also reflected in corresponding changes in the steady-state levels of HMGR mRNA and enzyme protein with respect to HMGR gene expression and enzyme protein accumulation.", 
    "100": "In L6 muscle cells expressing wild-type human insulin receptors (L6hIR), insulin induced protein kinase Calpha (PKCalpha) and beta activities. The expression of kinase-deficient IR mutants abolished insulin stimulation of these PKC isoforms, indicating that receptor kinase is necessary for PKC activation by insulin. In L6hIR cells, inhibition of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS-1) expression caused a 90% decrease in insulin-induced PKCalpha and -beta activation and blocked insulin stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and DNA synthesis. Blocking PKCbeta with either antisense oligonucleotide or the specific inhibitor LY379196 decreased the effects of insulin on MAPK activity and DNA synthesis by >80% but did not affect epidermal growth factor (EGF)- and serum-stimulated mitogenesis. In contrast, blocking c-Ras with lovastatin or the use of the L61,S186 dominant negative Ras mutant inhibited insulin-stimulated MAPK activity and DNA synthesis by only about 30% but completely blocked the effect of EGF. PKCbeta block did not affect Ras activity but almost completely inhibited insulin-induced Raf kinase activation and coprecipitation with PKCbeta. Finally, blocking PKCalpha expression by antisense oligonucleotide constitutively increased MAPK activity and DNA synthesis, with little effect on their insulin sensitivity. We make the following conclusions. (i) The tyrosine kinase activity of the IR is necessary for insulin activation of PKCalpha and -beta. (ii) IRS-1 phosphorylation is necessary for insulin activation of these PKCs in the L6 cells. (iii) In these cells, PKCbeta plays a unique Ras-independent role in mediating insulin but not EGF or other growth factor mitogenic signals.", 
    "101": "Increased prevalence of Alzheimer's disease-like beta-amyloid deposits in the neuropil and within neurons occurs in the brains of non-demented individuals with heart disease. Heart disease is a prevalent finding in Alzheimer's disease, and may be a forerunner to the dementing disorder. In the cholesterol-fed rabbit model of human coronary heart disease there is production and accumulation of beta-amyloid in the brain. This accumulation of beta-amyloid can be reversed by removing cholesterol from the rabbits' diet. In culture cells, a cholesterol challenge has been shown to increase production of beta-amyloid, and dramatic reductions of cholesterol produced by HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors decrease production of beta-amyloid. Increased beta-amyloid production is also produced by dietary cholesterol in a number of transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease. Administration of HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors may block beta-amyloid production caused by dietary cholesterol in rabbits. Clinical trials testing the benefit of HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease are underway.", 
    "102": "Lowering of the cholesterol level is of central importance in the prevention of coronary heart disease. Although the clinical benefits of treatment with statins have been shown in numerous studies, economic considerations are also being taken increasingly into account for the decision process about health care benefits. With this background, a cost-benefit analysis was carried out for statin treatment.", 
    "103": "Based on a cost analysis for coronary heart disease carried out by the authors from a social security standpoint, the net prevention costs for secondary prevention in Germany were assessed. The ICD-9 codes 410-414 were assigned to coronary heart disease. In addition to the direct costs of treatment for coronary heart disease, loss of premiums for social security, savings on old age pensions, related pension claims and wage compensations over a time period of 10 years were also quantified in the cost analysis. Furthermore, prevention through medication for the 45- to 64-year-old coronary heart disease patients was considered. Costs for prevention were assessed on the basis of the mean dosages of all medications on the market according to the Rote Liste (German Formulary). A risk reduction of 30% was assumed and numerous univariate sensitivity analyses were carried out.", 
    "104": "Depending on which parameters were varied, there were pronounced differences in the results. The most favourable cost-benefit relation was achieved for the preventive measures in 400,000 patients with net prevention costs of 1.08 billion DM (2.16 billion DM for 800,000 patients) for a duration of medical preventive care of 5 years. The highest net prevention costs of 3.47 billion DM for 400,000 coronary heart disease patients (or 6.93 billion DM for 800,000 patients) resulted when maximum prices for statins were assumed. In the setting taken as base analysis, approximately 25% of the prevention costs are accounted for by cost saving through prevention.", 
    "105": "The transfer of clinical study results into clinical practice is associated with uncertainties which necessitate comprehensive sensitivity analyses. The costs of coronary heart disease were shown to be highly sensitive to the cost-benefit relationship. Although from an overall social security perspective, the direct costs of treatment and the loss of premiums were balanced by reduced expenditure (pension savings), coronary heart disease does lead to a financial burden on the social security.", 
    "106": "This financial burden is decreased by prevention of coronary heart disease. Part of the costs of statin therapy can be covered in every situation by cost savings through the avoidance of coronary heart disease. Even complex simulation models, that uses realistic assumptions, could only determine the costs of an evidence-based secondary prevention of coronary heart disease unprecisely, because the worst case and the best case vary with the factor 7.", 
    "107": "This open-label, single-dose, crossover study was conducted to assess the effect of irbesartan on the pharmacokinetics of total simvastatin acid in 14 healthy subjects. Subjects were randomized to receive one simvastatin 40 mg tablet or one simvastatin 40 mg tablet + one irbesartan 300 mg tablet. Subjects were crossed over to the other treatment after a 7- to 10-day washout period. Serum samples were collected at specified times before and over a 24-hour period after dosing. Safety was assessed by monitoring vital signs, laboratory tests, and adverse events. Irbesartan did not exhibit a clinically significant effect on the peak serum concentration and area under the concentration versus time curve to infinity (AUC0-infinity) of total simvastatin acid. The mean AUC0-infinity of total simvastatin acid was 74.55 ng x h/mL when simvastatin was given alone and 67.55 ng x h/mL when simvastatin and irbesartan were given concomitantly. The time to peak serum concentration for both treatments was 3 hours. No serious adverse events occurred during the study, and both agents were well tolerated. In summary, irbesartan had no significant effect on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of total simvastatin acid.", 
    "108": "A direct-injection liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS) method was developed and validated for the simultaneous quantitation in human plasma of the widely used cholesterol-lowering prodrug simvastatin and its in vivo generated active drug, simvastatin acid. The plasma samples were injected into the LC-MS-MS system after simply adding the internal standard solution in an aqueous buffer and centrifuging. The analytes in the buffered plasma samples were found to be stable for at least 24 h at 4 degrees C. The method was successfully validated under the challenging condition of using a large number of quality control (QC) samples including those in which the ratio of the simvastatin concentration to the simvastatin acid concentration was different from the concentration ratio in the calibration curve standards. Under the dual stabilizing conditions of lower temperature (4 degrees C) and lower plasma pH of 4.9, the in-process hydrolysis of simvastatin to simvastatin acid or the lactonization of simvastatin acid to simvastatin was minimized to < or = 1.0%. Although the entire run time for on-line cleanup and analysis was only 2.5 min, chromatographic base-line separation of simvastatin from simvastatin acid, which was required to avoid the interference by simvastatin acid with the simvastatin selected reaction monitoring channel, was achieved. The desired lower limit of quantitation of 0.5 ng/ml was achieved by injecting only an equivalent of 8.0 microl of the plasma sample. The extraction column lasted for at least 500 injections.", 
    "109": "Various studies on the relationship between serum cholesterol level and the risk of stroke have been published recently. Subsequent reviews have extrapolated information on stroke from the clinical trials originally aimed at lowering cholesterol for the primary and secondary prevention of myocardial infarction (MI) in middle-aged patients. We have reviewed the epidemiological knowledge on the relationship between serum cholesterol levels and stroke, and also focused on possible reduction of the risk of stroke with hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor treatment. Possible benefits from such therapy are particularly relevant for the elderly population which is at particularly high risk for stroke. The effects of serum cholesterol levels on the risk for haemorrhagic and ischaemic stroke have been evaluated. Indirect epidemiological evidence indicates that serum levels of total cholesterol and its subfractions are determinants of stroke, but their associations are relatively weak. When exploring the possible association of serum cholesterol levels with the increased risk of stroke with aging, we concluded that, as in younger adults, elevated total cholesterol and decreased high density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels predispose to ischaemic stroke in the elderly. The mechanism through which serum cholesterol levels increase stroke risk is based on its actions on the artery walls. Indirect evidence suggests that the reduction in the stroke risk with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors is larger than would be expected with reduction of elevated serum cholesterol level alone. Therefore, antioxidant and endothelium-stabilising properties of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may contribute in reducing the risk of stroke in recipients. Lowering high serum cholesterol with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors has been beneficial in the primary and secondary prevention of MI. No trials have specifically tested the effect of cholesterol lowering with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on stroke occurrence. High serum cholesterol levels are a risk factor for ischaemic stroke, although the risk imparted is lower than that for MI. Although the relative risk of stroke associated with elevated serum cholesterol levels is only moderate, its population attributable risk is high given the increase in the elderly population worldwide. The effect of cholesterol reduction with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on prevention of ischaemic stroke should be evaluated in prospective, randomised, placebo-controlled trials in the elderly. The tolerability of lipid-lowering drugs in the elderly and the cost effectiveness of primary prevention of stroke using lipid-lowering drugs also needs to be assessed in the elderly.",

The hypertriglyceridemia distinguishes in primary and secondary. In primary forms the origin is essentially genetic, while the secondary ones are metabolic consequence of various pathologies (renal, thyroid, diabetes mellitus etc.). The hypertriglyceridemia's treatment is founded on a correct feeding and/or on eventual use of drugs. Apart from the secondary forms, in which is obligatory to treat at first the basal disease, the pharmacological therapy of the hypertriglyceridemia is suggested only in resistant cases to alone dietetic therapy and overall in presence of other factors of atherothrombotic hazard. The most utilized drugs are: omega-3 fatty acids, the nicotinic acid and its derivatives, the fibrates and the statins. The stronghold of alpha-glucosidases inhibitors is the acarbose. It reduces the biosynthesis of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) by the reduction of substrata with an improvement of glucidic metabolism. Atorvastatin and cerivastatin develop a greater action to reduce serum levels of triglycerides as to the foregoing ones because of the better selectivity of receptor binding, the greater halflife and inhibition of the apolipoprotein's B100 synthesis.",

    "122": "The paraoxonase gene family contains at least three members: PON1, PON2, and PON3. The physiological roles of the corresponding gene products are still uncertain. Until recently, only the serum paraoxonase/arylesterase (PON1) had been purified and characterized. Here we report the purification, cloning, and characterization of rabbit serum PON3. PON3 is a 40-kDa protein associated with the high density lipoprotein fraction of serum. In contrast to PON1, PON3 has very limited arylesterase and no paraoxonase activities but rapidly hydrolyzes lactones such as statin prodrugs (e.g. lovastatin). These differences facilitated the complete separation of PON3 from PON1 during purification. PON3 hydrolyzes aromatic lactones and 5- or 6-member ring lactones with aliphatic substituents but not simple lactones or those with polar substituents. We cloned PON3 from total rabbit liver RNA and expressed it in mammalian 293T/17 cells. The recombinant PON3 has the same apparent molecular mass and substrate specificity as the enzyme purified from serum. Rabbit serum PON3 is more efficient than rabbit PON1 in protecting low density lipoprotein from copper-induced oxidation.

Fluvastatin (0.1 to 2.5 microM), concentration-dependently reduced the release of PAI-1 antigen by unstimulated HUVEC, subsequent to a reduction in PAI-1 steady-state mRNA levels and de novo protein synthesis. In contrast, it increased t-PA secretion. The drug also reduced PAI-1 antigen secreted in response to 10 microg/ml bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), 100 U/ml tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) or 0.1 microM phorbol myristate acetate (PMA). Mevalonate (100 microM), a precursor of isoprenoids, added to cells simultaneously with fluvastatin, suppressed the effect of the drug on PAI-1 both in unstimulated and stimulated cells as well as on t-PA antigen. Among intermediates of the isoprenoid pathway, all-transgeranylgeraniol (5 microM) but not farnesol (10 microM) prevented the effect of 2.5 microM fluvastatin on PAI-1 antigen, which suggests that the former intermediate of the isoprenoid synthesis is responsible for the observed effects.",

The database of the CAIUS study was examined in order to investigate the presence of a relationship, if any, between the activity of pravastatin on IMT progression rate and its hypocholesterolemic effect. Quantitative B-mode ultrasound imaging was used to quantify the individual mean maximum IMT progression rate in 3 years. In the overall group of patients (placebo and pravastatin) covariance analysis showed that while the variable 'treatment' (0 = placebo, 1 = pravastatin) was significantly related to the reduction of IMT progression (F= 6.6, P = 0.01), the IMT progression did not correlate with the extent of LDL-C lowering (F= 0.00, P = 0.98). To further investigate this issue. the pravastatin treated group was stratified into quartiles of LDL-C reduction. In contrast to what was observed in the placebo group, in which a positive mean IMT progression rate was observed, independent of the extent of LDL-C reduction, no IMT progressionwas observed in any subgroup treated with pravastatin. No significant difference was found among quartiles and no trend could be identified. In conclusion, the effect of pravastatin treatment on carotid IMT progression rate is beneficial; however the CAIUS study demonstrated that lowering LDL-C by itself, does not explain the variability of beneficial changes in IMT.", 
    "138": "Low density lipoprotein (LDL) with low sialic acid content has been reported to cause intracellular cholesterol accumulation, and therefore desialylation has been proposed to be an atherogenic modification of LDL. However, it is not known whether hypolipidemic treatment has any effect on LDL sialylation. Accordingly, we investigated the sialic acid/apolipoprotein (apo) B ratio of total LDL and its subfractions in 26 moderately hypercholesterolemic patients at baseline and after treatment with statins for 2-3 months. Cholesterol and triglyceride levels were reduced in all apo B-containing lipoproteins, including all LDL subfractions, while the sialic acid ratio was increased in total LDL and in all its subfractions. Cholesterol concentrations and sialic acid ratios were inversely correlated in light and dense LDL subfractions both before and during statin treatment, and the greater the decrease in cholesterol and apo B contents of dense LDL, the higher was the increase in its sialic acid ratio. Furthermore, the lower the baseline sialic acid ratio of dense LDL, the greater was the reduction in its lipid and apo B concentrations. In conclusion, inhibition of cholesterol synthesis by statin treatment increased sialic acid/apo B ratio in LDL proportionately to the decrease of LDL apo B and cholesterol.",

For each single device data on efficacy have been provided, but up to now no comparative analysis including the novel direct adsorption of lipoproteins from whole blood has been reported. This prospectively designed cross-over comparison of three commercially available LDL-apheresis systems (immunoadsorption, IMAL; dextran sulphate adsorption, DSA; direct adsorption of lipoproteins, DALI) was performed in eight patients with homozygous (n = 3) and heterozygous (n = 5) familial hypercholesterolaemia. Removal of atherogenic lipoproteins was highly effective in all systems, for LDL-cholesterol in particular: DSA: - 84.3 +/- 6.2%; IMAL: -82.1 +/- 8.3%; DALI: -76.6 +/- 7.2% (P < 0.05 as compared DALI versus IMAL and DSA). A reduction in Lp(a) of about 63% was achieved by each device. Loss in HDL-cholesterol was highest with IMAL (-21.3 +/- 4.9%, P < 0.05) as compared to the other two treatment modalities. DSA decreased HDL-cholesterol by - 10.4 +/- 6.1% and the DALI system by -12.7 +/- 5.0%.

The shortest duration for treatment was achieved by the DALI system (135 +/- 20 min, P < 0.05 versus IMAL (195 +/- 20 min) and DSA (187 +/- 29 min)). No side effects were recorded in the total of 96 treatments performed during the study. Long-term observations have yet to prove whether these differences in efficacy may be of clinical relevance.", 
    "140": "Some 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, which are used as hypolipidemic drugs, have been reported to have the potential to reduce the oxidizability of plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) when they are administered in vivo. Their in vivo mechanism is believed to be closely related to their hypolipidemic action based on the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity. We hypothesized that some type of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor has additional mechanism inhibiting LDL oxidation in vivo due not to its hypolipidemic action but to its direct antioxidative effect based on its unique chemical structure. We directly compared in vitro the antioxidative effects of well-known HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (fluvastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin, cerivastatin and atorvastatin) on the hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative destruction of hemin and LDL. Fluvastatin but not the others showed the inhibitory effect on this system. Its effect was dose-dependent and almost as strong as the natural antioxidants, alpha-tocopherol and ascorbic acid. Further, M2, which is a hydroxylated metabolite of fluvastatin, showed stronger antioxidative activity than did fluvastatin. We suggest that among these HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, fluvastatin especially has an ability to retard the LDL oxidation which is based on not only its hypolipidemic action but also its direct antioxidative effect.", 
    "141": "Amyloid Abeta deposition is a neuropathologic hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Activated microglia are intimately associated with plaques and appear to facilitate Abeta deposition, an event believed to contribute to pathogenesis. It is unclear if microglia can modulate pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease by secreting lipoprotein particles. Here we show that cultured BV2 murine microglial cells, like astrocytes, secrete apolipoprotein E (apoE) and apolipoprotein J (apoJ) in a time-dependent manner. To isolate and identify BV2 microglial particles, gel filtration chromatography was employed to fractionate BV2-conditioned medium. Analyses by Western blot, lipid determination, electron microscopy, and native gel electrophoresis demonstrate that BV2 microglial cells release spherical low density lipoprotein (LDL)-like lipid-containing particles rich in apoJ but poor in apoE. These microglial particles are dissimilar in size, shape, and lipoprotein composition to astrocyte-derived particles. The microglial-derived particles were tested for functional activity. Under conditions of suppressed de novo cholesterol synthesis, the LDL-like particles effectively rescued primary rat cortical neurons from mevastatin-induced neurotoxicity. The particles were also shown to bind Abeta. We speculate that the LDL-like apoJ-rich apoE-poor microglial lipoproteins preferentially bind the lipoprotein receptor, recognizing apoJ, which is abundant in the choroid plexus, facilitating Abeta clearance from the brain. BV2 cells also secrete an apoE-rich lipid-poor species that binds Abeta. Consistent with the role of apoE in Abeta fibril formation and deposition, this microglial species may promote plaque formation.",

The effect of therapy with statins beyond the typical 5 to 6 years' duration of the trials, in particular regarding the risk of cancer, has not been investigated. This study examines the long-term effects of simvastatin for up to 8 years on cause-specific mortality in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). We performed an observational, government registry-based study of mortality in the groups originally randomized to simvastatin or placebo in the 4S over an additional 2-year follow-up period, so that the median total follow-up period was 7.4 years (range 6.9 to 8.3 in surviving patients). Randomization took place at outpatient clinics at 94 clinical centers in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden from 1988 to 1989. Of 4,444 patients with CHD, 2,223 and 2,221 were randomized to treatment with placebo or simvastatin therapy, respectively. Patients received treatment with simvastatin, starting at 20 mg/day, with titration to 40 mg/day at 12 or 24 weeks if total cholesterol was >5.2 mmol/L (200 mg/dl), or placebo. After the double-blind period, most patients in both treatment groups received simvastatin as open-label prescription. Of the 1,967 patients originally treated with placebo and surviving the double-blind period, 97 (4.9%) died during the following 2 years. In the group randomized to simvastatin the corresponding number was 74 of the 2, 039 survivors (3.6%). Adding these deaths to those occurring during the original trial, the total was 353 (15.9%) and 256 (11.5%) deaths in the groups originally randomized to placebo and simvastatin, respectively. The relative risk was 0.70 (95% confidence interval 0. 60 to 0.82, p = 0.00002). The total number of cancer deaths was 68 (3.1%) in the placebo group and 52 (2.3%) in the simvastatin group (relative risk 0.73, 95% confidence interval 0.51 to 0.05, p = 0. 087), and the numbers of noncardiovascular and other deaths were similar in both groups. We therefore conclude that treatment with simvastatin for up to 8 years in patients with CHD is safe and yields continued survival benefit.",

The plant decoction prepared at 10% was given orally at the rate of 1.5 ml/100g during 3 months. Results show that the plant presents a hypocholesterolemic effect (42%) related to decreases in LDL and VLDL cholesterol. In addition, hypoglycemic (16%) and antihyperglycemic (40%) effects were observed accompanied by a 27% decrease in insulin. Chronic treatment with Zocor reduced total cholesterol (32%), LDL and VLDL cholesterol. Both of treatments produced no significantly reduction in plasma levels of triglycerides and HDL cholesterol. No noxions effect of this plant have been observed in usual doses.", 
    "153": "Recent studies suggest that some of the beneficial effects of 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase inhibitors such as pravastatin may be through their cholesterol-lowering independent effects on the blood vessels. We have recently reported that chronic inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis with N(omega)nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) increases systolic blood pressure and induces coronary vascular inflammatory changes in rats. We designed this study to investigate whether treatment with pravastatin attenuates such proarteriosclerotic changes through their cholesterol-lowering independent effects. Several groups of Wistar-Kyoto rats were studied: the control group, L group received L-NAME in their drinking water (100 mg/kg per day) and L+Px group received L-NAME plus pravastatin (50, 100 or 250 mg/kg per day). We observed marked increases in monocyte infiltration into the coronary arteries, proliferative cell nuclear antigen-positive cells, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) expression in the heart on day 3 after L-NAME administration began. Treatment with pravastatin did not affect serum cholesterol levels or systolic blood pressure but did reduce the L-NAME induced inflammatory and proliferative changes. Pravastatin also attenuated the MCP-1 gene expression induced by L-NAME. In summary, pravastatin inhibited the inflammatory and proliferative changes in the coronary vessels through their cholesterol-independent effects in this model, which may provide an insight into the mechanisms of anti-inflammatory or anti-arteriosclerotic actions of pravastatin.", 
    "154": "Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) apheresis is a treatment option in patients with coronary artery disease and elevated LDL cholesterol concentrations if maximal drug therapy fails to achieve adequate LDL cholesterol reduction. This therapy is more effective when combined with strong lipid-lowering drugs, such as atorvastatin. However, conflicting data have been published concerning the effect of atorvastatin on fibrinogen concentration. Therefore, we investigated the effect of atorvastatin compared to simvastatin on fibrinogen concentration and other hemorheological parameters in patients treated by weekly LDL apheresis. Hemorheological parameters were, studied twice in 9 patients (4 female, 5 male, 54.0+/-8.9 years) with coronary artery disease treated by weekly LDL immunoadsorption, once during concomitant simvastatin therapy (40 mg daily) and once during atorvastatin therapy (40 mg daily). Fibrinogen concentration, plasma and blood viscosity at different shear rates, parameters of red cell aggregation at stasis and shear rate 3/s, and erythrocyte filterability were determined 7 days after the last LDL apheresis after each drug had been given for a minimum for 8 weeks. Fibrinogen concentration did not show any statistically significant difference during therapy with atorvastatin (3.09+/-0.36 g/L) compared to simvastatin (3.13+/-0.77 g/L). Plasma and blood viscosity as well as erythrocyte filterability were also unchanged. The increase in red cell aggregation at stasis during atorvastatin treatment (5.82+/-1.00 U versus 4.89+/-0.48 U during simvastatin; p < 0.05) was inversely correlated with a lower high-density liprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration (1.17+/-0.21 mmol/L versus 1.31+/-0.30 mmol/L during simvastatin; p < 0.05). LDL cholesterol showed a strong trend to lower concentrations during atorvastatin (4.14+/-0.61 mmol/L versus 4.56+/-0.66 mmol/L during simvastatin; p = 0.07), despite a reduced plasma volume treated (3,547+/-1,239 ml during atorvastatin versus 3,888+/-1,206 mL during simvastatin; p < 0.05). In conclusion, fibrinogen concentration and other hemorheological parameters were unchanged during atorvastatin compared to simvastatin therapy with the exception of a higher red cell aggregation at stasis. Therefore, with respect to hemorheology, we conclude that atorvastatin should not be withheld from hypercholesterolemic patients regularly treated with LDL immunoadsorption.", 
    "155": "The beneficial effects of statins on the reduction of cardiovascular events has been partly attributed to their anti-inflammatory properties. In the complex of the different pathogenetic events leading to atherosclerosis, recent data suggest a central role of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), because mice knock-out for MCP-1 or its receptor CC-chemokine receptor 2 were considerably resistant to plaque formation. In this study we investigated the effect of different statins on in vitro and in vivo production of MCP-1. Lovastatin and simvastatin caused a dose-dependent inhibition of MCP-1 production in peripheral blood mononuclear cells exposed to lipopolysaccharide or inactivated Streptococcus hemoliticus and in human endothelial cells exposed to interleukin-1beta. The addition of mevalonate overrode the inhibitory effect of statins indicating that mevalonate-derived products are important for chemokine production. The in vivo anti-inflammatory effect of statins was investigated using the mouse air-pouch model of local inflammation. Lovastatin and pravastatin were orally administered to mice according to a treatment schedule that significantly inhibited the hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity without affecting total blood cholesterol. At the dose of 10 mg/kg, lovastatin and pravastatin reduced by approximately 50% the lipopolysaccharide-induced leukocytes recruitment and the exudate MCP-1 production. In conclusion, statins, by inhibiting mevalonate-derived products, reduced both in vitro and in vivo the production of chemokines involved in leukocyte migration, and this effect is unrelated to their cholesterol-lowering action.", 
    "156": "We conducted a post hoc pharmacoeconomic analysis of a multicenter, open-label, randomized, parallel-group, 8-week efficacy-safety comparison of five HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors-atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin. The 534 patients requiring cholesterol-lowering therapy took the drugs for 8 weeks with 15 different regimens. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was measured after 6 weeks of diet (baseline) and after 8 weeks of treatment with a study drug. At dosages of 10, 20, and 40 mg/day, atorvastatin was associated with significantly greater reductions in LDL than equivalent dosages of the other agents. Cost-effectiveness calculated as the annual acquisition cost/percentage LDL reduction was greatest with atorvastatin 10 mg ($17.96), fluvastatin 40 mg ($19.83), atorvastatin 20 mg ($22.85), and atorvastatin 40 mg ($24.96). All other dosages were above $25.00/year/percentage LDL reduction. Atorvastatin was the most cost-effective HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor. Fluvastatin 40 mg/day also had a favorable cost:effectiveness ratio but lowered LDL only by 23%."
