ATR nanocrystals were successfully characterized for size, morphology, crystallinity and drug-excipients interaction. The effects of varied polymer concentration and gelling solvents were evaluated for initial burst release and in vivo efficacy. Short term stability study was also conducted for the promising formulation. Nanocrystals of size 254 nm were prepared using low molecular weight chitosan and were of smooth surface with multiple scaffolds like structures. X-ray powder diffraction revealed the crystalline structure of the prepared nanocrystals while no drug-excipients interactions were observed. Addition of nanocrystals did not significantly alter gelation property of the ISG system that showed acceptable syringeability. The promising ISG formulation was achieved with 45% PLGA in N-methyl pyrrolidone: benzyl benzoate (1:3). In-vitro dissolution study illustrated lower initial ATR burst and prolonged drug release from nanocrystal based ISG when compared to plain ATR ISG. The pharmacokinetic and hypolipidemic biochemical parameters were comparable in the two formulations. The promising formulation exhibited minimum drug degradation at 4 &#176;C and so could be considered as an ideal ISG delivery system.",

Our results illustrated that lycopene exhibited strong HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity (IC50 value of 36\u00a0ng/ml) quite better than pravastatin (IC50\u00a0=\u00a042\u00a0ng/ml) and strong DPPH free radical scavenging activity (IC50 value\u00a0=\u00a04.57\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.23\u00a0\u03bcg/ml) as compared to ascorbic acid (IC50 value\u00a0=\u00a09.82\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.42\u00a0\u03bcg/ml). Moreover, the Ki value of lycopene (36\u00a0ng/ml) depicted via Dixon plot was well concurred with an IC50 value of 36\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.8\u00a0ng/ml. Moreover, molecular informatics study showed that lycopene exhibited binding energy of -5.62\u00a0kcal/mol indicating high affinity for HMG-CoA reductase than HMG-CoA (\u0394G: -5.34\u00a0kcal/mol). Thus, in silico data clearly demonstrate and support the in vitro results that lycopene competitively inhibit HMG-CoA reductase activity by binding at the hydrophobic portion of HMG-CoA reductase.", 
    "2": "It is of great therapeutic significance that disordered function of the vascular endothelium which supply the affected ocular structures plays a major role in the pathogenesis and development of age-related macular degeneration. Chronic inflammation is closely linked to diseases associated with endothelial dysfunction, and age-related macular degeneration is accompanied by a general inflammatory response. According to current concept, age-related macular degeneration is a local manifestation of systemic vascular disease. This recognition could have therapeutic implications because restoration of endothelial dysfunction can restabilize the condition of chronic vascular disease including age-related macular degeneration as well. Restoration of endothelial dysfunction by pharmaacological or non pharmacological interventions may prevent the development or improve endothelial dysfunction, which result in prevention or improvement of age related macular degeneration as well. Medicines including inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers and renin inhibitors), statins, acetylsalicylic acid, trimetazidin, third generation beta-blockers, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma agonists, folate, vitamin D, melatonin, advanced glycation end-product crosslink breaker alagebrium, endothelin-receptor antagonist bosentan, coenzyme Q10; \"causal\" antioxidant vitamins, N-acetyl-cysteine, resveratrol, L-arginine, serotonin receptor agonists, tumor necrosis factor-alpha blockers, specific inhibitor of the complement alternative pathway, curcumin and doxycyclin all have beneficial effects on endothelial dysfunction. Restoration of endothelial dysfunction can restabilize chronic vascular disease including age-related macular degeneration as well. Considering that the human vascular system is consubstantial, medicines listed above should be given to patients (1) who have no macular degeneration but have risk factors for the disease and are older than 50 years; (2) who have been diagnosed with unilateral age-related macular degeneration in order to prevent damage of the contralateral eye; (3) who have bilateral age-related macular degeneration in order to avert deterioration and in the hope of a potential improvement. However, randomised prospective clinical trials are still needed to elucidate the potential role of these drug treatments in the prevention and treatment of age-related macular degeneration.",

Metformin and atorvastatin are applied on a wide scale, to the degree that they could be considered as part of the host biochemical environment that can affect the parasite. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the impact of alteration of the host's biochemical environment by these commonly used drugs upon the course of T. spiralis infection. Mice were divided into three groups: (1) received atorvastatin, (2) received metformin, and (3) untreated, then after one week, animals were infected with T. spiralis. The treatment continued until the end of the experiment. From each group, small intestines and muscles were removed for histopathological, immunohistochemical, and biochemical analyses as well as total muscle larval counts. We found that the oxidative stress and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the muscles were significantly reduced in both drug-receiving groups, while the total larval counts in muscles were only significantly reduced in atorvastatin-receiving group as compared to the infected control group. Moreover, marked reduction in the inflammatory cellular infiltration, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression, and oxidative stress was noted in the small intestines of the treated groups as compared to the infected control group. In conclusion, this study provides many insights into the different biochemical changes in the host that the parasite has to face.

Ongoing PCSK-9 mAb cardiovascular outcomes trials could provide the opportunity to determine whether a \"legacy effect\" similar to that observed for statins will occur over the post-trial observation period. We hypothesize these trials could demonstrate that (1) very aggressive LDL-C lowering with PCSK-9 mAbs added to background statin therapy will induce extensive atherosclerosis stabilization and regression in the large majority of treated patients, and (2) continued maintenance therapy with high intensity statin therapy (with or without ezetimibe) should then inhibit new plaque formation, with a long-term prevention of CVD events.

The number of inflammatory cells in BALF was dramatically increased in smoke exposed rats, and simvastatin dampened the number of leukocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and macrophages. In addition, circulating 5-HTand expression of 5-HTT in the lung were significantly increased in the smoked rats compared to control rats, and it was significantly reduced by simvastatin.

    "28": "The use of statins for bone regeneration is a promising and growing area of research. Statins, originally developed to treat high cholesterol, are inhibitors of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl, the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway. Because the mevalonate pathway is responsible for the synthesis of a wide variety of important biochemical molecules, including cholesterol and other isoprenoids, the effects of statins are pleiotropic. In particular, statins can greatly affect the process of bone turnover and regeneration via effects on important cell types, including mesenchymal stem cells, osteoblasts, endothelial cells, and osteoclasts. Statins have also been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties that may be useful since infection can derail normal bone healing. This review will explore the pleiotropic effects of statins, discuss the current use of statins for bone regeneration, particularly with regard to biomaterials-based controlled delivery, and offer perspectives on the challenges and future directions of this emerging area of bone tissue engineering.",

Moreover, a significantly greater decrease in urine protein excretion was observed in the simvastatin group as compared with the untreated group. The mean changes of serum creatinine and eGFR did not significantly differ in both groups. A significantly greater decrease in total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol was found in the simvastatin group than in the untreated group. In summary, apart from lipid lowering among CKD patients, ingesting simvastatin was associated with a decrease in proteinuria.

One such class of medications, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, have been evaluated in the COPD population. Early studies have suggested that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have a variety of benefits in COPD including improvements in inflammatory markers, exacerbation rates, and mortality rates. However, the majority of this data comes from retrospective cohort studies, suggesting the need for randomized controlled trials. Recently, two randomized controlled trials, STATCOPE and RODEO, evaluated the benefit of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in the COPD population and found no benefit in exacerbation rates and vascular or pulmonary function, respectively. These results are reflected in practice guidelines, which do not support the use of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors for the purpose of reducing COPD exacerbations.",

In addition, simvastatin has demonstrated potent antineuroinflammatory and brain edema reducing effects and has shown promise in promoting functional recovery in pre-clinical models of traumatic brain injury (TBI). The purpose of this study was to assess the potential neuroprotective effects of oral administration of simvastatin on neurobehavioral, biomarker, and histopathological outcome measures compared across three pre-clinical TBI animal models. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to either moderate fluid percussion injury (FPI), controlled cortical impact injury (CCI), or penetrating ballistic-like brain injury (PBBI). Simvastatin (1 or 5 mg/kg) was delivered via oral gavage at 3 h post-injury and continued once daily out to 14 days post-injury. Results indicated an intermediate beneficial effect of simvastatin on motor performance on the gridwalk (FPI), balance beam (CCI), and rotarod tasks (PBBI). No significant therapeutic benefit was detected, however, on cognitive outcome across the OBTT TBI models. In fact, Morris water maze (MWM) performance was actually worsened by treatment in the FPI model and scored full negative points for low dose in the MWM latency and swim distance to locate the hidden platform. A detrimental effect on cortical tissue loss was also seen in the FPI model, and there were no benefits on histology across the other models. Simvastatin also produced negative effects on circulating glial fibrillary acidic protein biomarker outcomes that were evident in the FPI and PBBI models. Overall, the current findings do not support the beneficial effects of simvastatin administration over 2 weeks post-TBI using the oral route of administration and, as such, it will not be further pursued by OBTT.",

Some studies have shown a significant association of statins with improved respiratory health outcomes of patients with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer. Here we hypothesize that statins impact gene expression in human lungs and may reveal the pleiotropic effects of statins that are taking place directly in lung tissues. Human lung tissues were obtained from patients who underwent lung resection or transplantation. Gene expression was measured on a custom Affymetrix array in a discovery cohort (n = 408) and two replication sets (n = 341 and 282). Gene expression was evaluated by linear regression between statin users and non-users, adjusting for age, gender, smoking status, and other covariables. The results of each cohort were combined in a meta-analysis and biological pathways were studied using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. The discovery set included 141 statin users. The lung mRNA expression levels of eighteen and three genes were up-regulated and down-regulated in statin users (FDR < 0.05), respectively. Twelve of the up-regulated genes were replicated in the first replication set, but none in the second (p-value < 0.05). Combining the discovery and replication sets into a meta-analysis improved the significance of the 12 up-regulated genes, which includes genes encoding enzymes and membrane proteins involved in cholesterol biosynthesis. Canonical biological pathways altered by statins in the lung include cholesterol, steroid, and terpenoid backbone biosynthesis. No genes encoding inflammatory, proteases, pro-fibrotic or growth factors were altered by statins, suggesting that the direct effect of statin in the lung do not go beyond its antilipidemic action. Although more studies are needed with specific lung cell types and different classes and doses of statins, the improved health outcomes and survival observed in statin users with chronic lung diseases do not seem to be mediated through direct regulation of gene expression in the lung.",

Atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is considered the most common cause of renovascular hypertension. However, advances in understanding the complex pathophysiology of this condition and the recently documented futility of renal revascularization bring into question whether atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis truly causes \"renovascular hypertension.\" From a clinical point of view, a clear distinction should be made between hypertension associated with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis and hypertension caused by renal artery stenosis-induced activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Most patients with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis do not have a form of hypertension that is remediable or improved by angioplasty; to expose them to the cost, inconvenience, and risk of a diagnostic work-up add up to little more than a wild goose chase.

    "119": "Although exercise and drug therapy are important to prevent progression of arteriosclerotic disease, exercise leads to an increase in muscular disorder induced by HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). Elucidation of this mechanism is needed to prevent the occurrence of muscular disorders. Since exercise induces expression of monocarboxylate transporter (MCT) 4, we focused on the association between MCT4 function and statin-induced muscle injury. First, we examined the transport of L-lactate via MCT4 using MCT4 cRNA-injected Xenopus laevis oocytes. L-lactate uptake by MCT4-expressing oocytes was markedly reduced by alkalizing the buffer pH and saturated at higher L-lactate concentrations. On the other hand, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and protein kinase C (PKC) are activated by exercise. We next examined whether AMPK and PKC activation affects the expression and function of MCT4 in rat skeletal muscle and RD cells as an in vitro skeletal muscle model. AMPK and PKC activation increased MCT4 expression level and lactate efflux by MCT4. Finally, we examined the association between MCT4 function and statin-induced cytotoxicity. Statins inhibited transport of L-lactate via MCT4 in a concentration-dependent manner. Statin-induced cytotoxicity was associated with intracellular acidification and caspase-3/7 activation. On the other hand, bicarbonate suppressed statin-induced pH alteration, caspase activation, and morphological change. The results suggest that statin-induced muscle injury exacerbated by exercise is associated with intracellular acidification and that the effects of statins on L-lactate transport are mediated by MCT4.",

Increased plasma sLR11 levels were found in Ldlr(-/-) and also in wild-type mice exclusively after high-fat feeding. Hepatic LR11 mRNA levels, however, were higher in chow-fed Ldlr(-/-) in comparison with wild-type mice and were further increased after a high fat diet. Similar results were obtained with Apoe(-/-) mice, but not with wild-type mice. LR11 mRNA and protein levels and release of sLR11 from cultured HepG2 and aortic smooth muscle cells were upregulated by postprandial triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TGRL). Overexpression of human LR11 in CHO cells resulted in increased binding and association of 12I-labeled TGRL, but not of 12I-labeled LDL.",

Rosuvastatin treated patients were more often using beta-blockers (p\u00a0=\u00a00.05), diuretics (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04) and displayed higher HDL (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) and lower LDL cholesterol (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). The prevalence of HRPR for ASA was low, with no difference according to statin type (0.8% vs 1.5%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.62, adjusted OR[95%CI]\u00a0=\u00a02[0.23-16.6], p\u00a0=\u00a00.52). Concerning ADP-antagonists, in the 163 patients treated with clopidogrel, rosuvastatin co-administration was associated with a significantly increased rate of HRPR (55.6%vs 32%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.01, adjusted OR[95%CI]\u00a0=\u00a02.69[1.22-5.96], p\u00a0=\u00a00.015) with higher ADP-mediated platelet reactivity (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01) and TRAP-test results (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04).

Arterial pseudoaneurysm is an uncommon complication of acute pancreatitis (incidence 0.7%) and mortality from this cause is currently anecdotal. Diabetes mellitus has little impact on the clinical course of acute pancreatitis, unlike cirrhosis, which doubles the risk of mortality. Intake of unsaturated fat could be associated with an increased severity of acute pancreatitis and is a confounding factor in studies evaluating the relationship between obesity and morbidity and mortality. PET-CT (positron emission tomography-computed tomography) could be a non-invasive tool to detect infection of collections in acute pancreatitis. Peripancreatic fat necrosis is less frequent than pancreatic fat necrosis and is associated with a better clinical course. If the clinical course is poor, increasing the calibre of the percutaneous drains used in the treatment of infected necrosis can avoid surgery in 20% of patients. The use of low molecular-weight heparin in moderate or severe pancreatitis could be associated with a better clinical course, specifically with a lower incidence of necrosis. In acute recurrent pancreatitis, simvastatin is a promising drug for prophylaxis of new episodes of acute pancreatitis.

Lovastatin inhibited the expressions of transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b21, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1. Furthermore, lovastatin inhibited the expressions of integrin \u03b21 and integrin \u03b23 but not integrin \u03b1v or integrin \u03b25. While Lovastatin's inhibitory effects on TGF\u03b21, COX2, and ICAM-1 expression were independently controlled by the tumor suppressor LKB1, integrin \u03b23 expression was not affected. Lovastatin's inhibitory effect on cell adhesion was associated with the decreased expression of integrin \u03b23 and cell surface heterodimer integrin \u03b1v\u03b23.

Statins are a class of drugs used to treat hypercholesterolemia and are frequently used in the elderly population to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. However, statins are also known to have immunomodulatory effects that could impact influenza vaccine response. In a post hoc analysis, we performed a cross-sectional observational study nested within a comparative immunogenicity clinical trial of adjuvanted versus unadjuvanted influenza vaccine in elderly persons to evaluate the influence of statin therapy on the immune response to vaccination. Overall, data on >5000 trial participants were available for analysis.

    "150": "The Wnt-inhibitor dickkopf-1 (DKK-1) promotes cancer-induced osteolytic bone lesions by direct inhibition of osteoblast differentiation and indirect activation of osteoclasts. DKK-1 is highly expressed in human breast cancer cells and can be suppressed by inhibitors of the mevalonate pathway such as statins and amino-bisphosphonates. However, supraphysiological concentrations are required to suppress DKK-1. We show that a sequential mevalonate pathway blockade using statins and amino-bisphosphonates suppresses DKK-1 more significantly than the individual agents alone. Thus, the reduction of the DKK-1 expression and secretion in the human osteotropic tumor cell lines MDA-MB-231, MDA-MET, and MDA-BONE by zoledronic acid was potentiated by the combination with low concentrations of statins (atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin) by up to 75% (p < 0.05). The specific rescue of prenylation using farnesyl pyrophosphate or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate revealed that these effects were mediated by suppressed geranylgeranylation rather than by suppressed farnesylation. Moreover, combining low concentrations of statins (1 \u00b5M atorvastatin or 0.25 \u00b5M simvastatin) and zoledronic acid at low concentrations resulted in an at least 50% reversal of breast cancer-derived DKK-1-mediated inhibition of osteogenic markers in C2C12 cells (p < 0.05). Finally, the intratumoral injection of atorvastatin and zoledronic acid in as subcutaneous MDA-MB-231 mouse model reduced the serum level of human DKK-1 by 25% compared to untreated mice. Hence our study reveals that a sequential mevalonate pathway blockade allows for the combined use of low concentration of statins and amino-bisphosphonates. This combination still significantly suppresses breast cancer-derived DKK-1 to levels where it can no longer inhibit Wnt-mediated osteoblast differentiation.",

IMNM is distinguished by the absence of primary inflammation on muscle biopsy. IMNM may be associated with myositis-specific autoantibodies (i.e., anti-SRP and anti-HMGCR) and malignancy, in association with viral infections (HIV or hepatitis C), or in relation to other connective tissue diseases (i.e., scleroderma). Typical clinical findings such as severe muscle weakness, highly elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels, as well as resistance to conventional immunosuppressive therapy are associated with this subtype of IIM. This review provides an overview of this disease entity and focuses on its diagnosis and treatment.", 
    "152": "The effects of extended-release niacin (ERN; 1-2 g/d) on the metabolism of lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)) and apolipoprotein (apo) B-100-containing lipoproteins were investigated in 11 statin-treated white men with type 2 diabetes mellitus in a randomized, crossover trial of 12-weeks duration.", 
    "153": "The kinetics of Lp(a) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate-density lipoprotein, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) apoB-100 were determined following a standardized oral fat load (87% fat) using intravenous administration of D3-leucine, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and compartmental modeling. ERN significantly decreased fasting plasma total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations. These effects were achieved without significant changes in body weight or insulin resistance. ERN significantly decreased plasma Lp(a) concentration (-26.5%) and the production rates of apo(a) (-41.5%) and Lp(a)-apoB-100 (-32.1%); the effect was greater in individuals with elevated Lp(a) concentration. ERN significantly decreased VLDL (-58.7%), intermediate-density lipoprotein (-33.6%), and LDL (-18.3%) apoB-100 concentrations and the corresponding production rates (VLDL, -49.8%; intermediate-density lipoprotein, -44.7%; LDL, -46.1%). The number of VLDL apoB-100 particles secreted increased in response to the oral fat load. Despite this, total VLDL apoB-100 production over the 10-hour postprandial period was significantly decreased with ERN (-21.9%).", 
    "154": "In statin-treated men with type 2 diabetes mellitus, ERN decreased plasma Lp(a) concentrations by decreasing the production of apo(a) and Lp(a)-apoB-100. ERN also decreased the concentrations of apoB-100-containing lipoproteins by decreasing VLDL production and the transport of these particles down the VLDL to LDL cascade. Our study provides further mechanistic insights into the lipid-regulating effects of ERN.", 
    "155": "The present study was conducted to investigate the effect of \u03b3-radiation alone or combined with a cytotoxic drug, simvastatin, on viability and cell cycling of a myeloma cell line. P3NS1 myeloma cells were treated with the selected dose of simvastatin (0.1 \u03bcM/l) 24 hours prior to \u03b3-irradiation (0.25, 0.5 and 1 Gy). The cell viability, induction of apoptosis, cell death, cell cycling, generation of ROS, and expression of P53, Bax, Bcl2, caspase3, PARP1 and Fas genes were estimated. The results indicated that simvastatin (0.1 \u03bcM/l) treatment for 24 hours prior to \u03b3- irradiation increased cell death to 37.5% as compared to 4.81% by radiation (0.5 Gy) alone. It was found that simvastatin treatment before irradiation caused arrest of cells in G0/G1 and G2/M phases as assessed using flow cytometry. Interestingly, simvastatin treatment of P3NS1 cells increased the intracellular ROS production and decreased antioxidant enzyme activity with increased P53, Bax and Caspase3 gene expression while that of Bcl2 was decreased. Consequently, our results indicated that pre-treatment with simvastatin increased radio sensitivity of myeloma tumor cells in addition to apoptotic effects through an intrinsic mitochondrial pathway.", 
    "156": "Two advanced, accurate and precise chemometric methods are developed for the simultaneous determination of amlodipine besylate (AML) and atorvastatin calcium (ATV) in the presence of their acidic degradation products in tablet dosage forms. The first method was Partial Least Squares (PLS-1) and the second was Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). PLS was compared to ANN models with and without variable selection procedure (genetic algorithm (GA)). For proper analysis, a 5-factor 5-level experimental design was established resulting in 25 mixtures containing different ratios of the interfering species. Fifteen mixtures were used as calibration set and the other ten mixtures were used as validation set to validate the prediction ability of the suggested models. The proposed methods were successfully applied to the analysis of pharmaceutical tablets containing AML and ATV. The methods indicated the ability of the mentioned models to solve the highly overlapped spectra of the quinary mixture, yet using inexpensive and easy to handle instruments like the UV-VIS spectrophotometer.", 
    "157": "Targeted anticancer therapies represent the most effective pharmacological strategies in terms of clinical responses. In this context, genetic alteration of several oncogenes represents an optimal predictor of response to targeted therapy. Integration of large-scale molecular and pharmacological data from cancer cell lines promises to be effective in the discovery of new genetic markers of drug sensitivity and of clinically relevant anticancer compounds. To define novel pharmacogenomic dependencies in cancer, we created the Mutations and Drugs Portal (MDP, http://mdp.unimore.it), a web accessible database that combines the cell-based NCI60 screening of more than 50,000 compounds with genomic data extracted from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia and the NCI60 DTP projects. MDP can be queried for drugs active in cancer cell lines carrying mutations in specific cancer genes or for genetic markers associated to sensitivity or resistance to a given compound. As proof of performance, we interrogated MDP to identify both known and novel pharmacogenomics associations and unveiled an unpredicted combination of two FDA-approved compounds, namely statins and Dasatinib, as an effective strategy to potently inhibit YAP/TAZ in cancer cells.",

Four of these (192 participants) assessed the effectiveness of donepezil, two (139 participants) assessed memantine, one (21 participants) assessed simvastatin, one study (35 participants) assessed antioxidants, and one study (40 participants) assessed acetyl-L-carnitine.Five studies focused on adults aged 45 to 55 years, while the remaining four studies focused on adults aged 20 to 29 years. Seven studies were conducted in either the USA or UK, one between Norway and the UK, and one in Japan. Follow-up periods in studies ranged from four weeks to two years. The reviewers judged all included studies to be at low or unclear risk of bias.Analyses indicate that for participants who received donepezil, scores in measures of cognitive functioning (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.27 to 1.13) and measures of behaviour (SMD 0.42, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.89) were similar to those who received placebo. However, participants who received donepezil were significantly more likely to experience an adverse event (odds ratio (OR) 0.32, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.62). The quality of this body of evidence was low. None of the included donepezil studies reported data for carer stress, institutional/home care, or death.For participants who received memantine, scores in measures of cognitive functioning (SMD 0.05, 95% CI -0.43 to 0.52), behaviour (SMD -0.17, 95% CI -0.46 to 0.11), and occurrence of adverse events (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.18 to 1.17) were similar to those who received placebo. The quality of this body of evidence was low. None of the included memantine studies reported data for carer stress, institutional/home care, or death.Due to insufficient data, it was possible to provide a narrative account only of the outcomes for simvastatin, antioxidants, and acetyl-L-carnitine.

To achieve this goal, 12 formulations were prepared by casting method. The investigated variables were Eudragit RL percentage, polymer mixture percentage, plasticizer type, plasticizer percentage, enhancer type, enhancer percentage and dichloromethane fraction in organic phase. The films were evaluated for physicochemical properties and ex vivo SMV permeation. SMV initial, delayed flux, diffusivity and permeability coefficient were calculated on the delayed flux phase with constraint to minimize the initial flux and approaching steady-state flux. The obtained results revealed flat films with homogeneous distribution of SMV within the films. Thickness values changed from 65 to 180 \u03bcm by changing the factors' combinations. Most of the permeation profiles showed sustained release feature with fast permeation phase followed by slow phase. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed significant effects (p\u2009<\u20090.05) of the investigated variables on the responses with Prob\u2009>\u2009F values of 0.0147, 0.0814, 0.0063 and 0.0142 for the initial and delayed fluxes, permeability coefficients and diffusivities, respectively. The findings of screening study showed the importance of the significant variables to be scaled up for full optimization study as a promising alternative drug delivery system.", 
    "166": "Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is characterized by a high level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. We report 4-year-old dichorionic diamniotic twins (boy and girl) with FH who presented with multiple xanthomas on the face, both knees, both feet, and buttocks. Family history revealed vertical transmission of hypercholesterolemia from father to patients, thereby suggesting dominant inheritance. Lipid data of their mother did not match the criteria of FH. However, lipid data of maternal grandmother and maternal sister matched the criteria of FH. LDL receptor gene analysis of the family revealed that their father was heterozygous for a missense mutation, L547V, their mother was heterozygous for a nonsense mutation, C675X, and patients were compound heterozygous for L547V and C675X. After 10 months of treatment with pitavastatin (2 mg/day) and ezetimibe (10 mg/day), LDL-C decreased from 595 mg/dL to 267 mg/dL in the boy and from 530 mg/dL to 182 mg/dL in the girl. These findings suggest that lipid-lowering therapy with statin may be considered in pediatric patients with compound heterozygous FH (hetero FH) before inducing LDL apheresis, and gene analysis for true diagnosis in pediatric patients with multiple xanthomas should be considered, though they appear to be hetero FH from the family history and lipid data of parents.", 
    "167": "Experimental and clinical studies provided evidence that formation of intra-platelet reactive oxidant species (ROS) is implicated in the process of thrombosis. Animal models demonstrated that enhanced ROS formation was associated with serious thrombotic complications and death. In recent years, nutritional and therapeutic approaches were tested to modulate ROS mediated thrombus formation. The use of a nutritional approach stems from the observation that foods rich in antioxidant elements, such as polyphenols, were able to modulate ROS formation. Similarly, some drugs used for different diseases (i.e. statins) showed the ability to modulate oxidative stress. Aim of this review is to summarize current evidences supporting the role of nutrients rich in polyphenols, such as olive oil and cocoa, and of some drugs, such as statins as antiplatelet agents interfering with the Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate (NADPH) Oxidase signaling. Indeed, for nutrients and statins, the antiplatelet activity seems to be dependent, at least in part, upon the inhibition of platelet NADPH oxidase-derived ROS formation, resulting in down-regulation of isoprostanes, which are pro-aggregating molecules, and up-regulation of nitric oxide, which is a platelet inhibitor.",

These IIM patients were predominantly female (73%), and only 3 anti-HMGCR antibody-positive patients with IIM were exposure to statins. Most patients experienced progressive onset, and presented with muscular weakness. Dysphagia was observed in half of the patients (p < 0.01), and 15% of these patients experienced the complication of interstitial lung disease (ILD) (p > 0.05). Mean creatine kinase (CK) levels were higher in antibody-positive patients than in antibody-negative patients (p < 0.05). Muscle biopsies were available from 12 anti-HMGCR antibody-positive patients, eight who experienced myofiber necrosis and showed very little or no evidence of inflammatory cell infiltrates in their muscle biopsies. Of these eleven patients who were followed-up 2.5- to 29-month, 73% experienced improvement after treatment. A cross-sectional study showed that anti-HMGCR antibody levels were significantly associated with CK levels (r = 0.486, p = 0.026) as well as with Myositis Disease Activity Assessment (MYOACT) scores (r = -0.67, p = 0.003) during the initial visit.

Data regarding the effect of statins on the risk for the entire range of supraventricular arrhythmias (SVA) in mild heart failure (HF) with different disease causes are lacking. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to assess the effect of statin therapy, evaluated as a time-dependent covariate, on the risk of SVA and recurrent SVA (defined as atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, atrial tachycardia, and supraventricular tachycardia) that were inappropriately treated with implantable cardioverter-defibrillator device in 1,790 patients enrolled in the Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation With Cardiac Resynchronization Therapy trial. Statin users constituted 68% of the study patients (n = 1209). They were older and more frequently men; they were more likely to have ischemic cardiomyopathy, diabetes, hypertension, and previous atrial arrhythmias. During the 3.7-year median follow-up time, 160 patients had an SVA event, and the total number of recurrent events was 335. Time-dependent statin therapy was independently associated with a significant 29% reduction of the first SVA event (p = 0.046) and 33% reduction of recurrent SVA events (p = 0.003), consistent across all prespecified subgroups. In conclusion, in mild HF with either cardiac resynchronization therapy with a defibrillator or an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator device, statin therapy was associated with significant reduction of occurrence and recurrence of inappropriately treated SVA.", 
    "178": "Mixed antihypertensive drug intoxication poses a significant risk for patient mortality. In tandem to antihypertensives, hypolipidemic medicines (especially statins) are often prescribed. Among their well-known adverse effects belongs rhabdomyolysis. We report a case of fatal multi-drug overdose in a 65-year-old female alcoholic. The patient was unconscious at admission. Empty blister packs indicated the abuse of 250 tablets of urapidil, 42 tablets of verapamil/trandolapril, 50 tablets of moxonidin, 80 tablets of atorvastatin and 80 tablets of diacerein. Standard measures (gastric lavage, activated charcoal, mechanical ventilation, massive doses of vasopressors, volume expansion, diuretics and alkalinization) failed to provide sufficient drug elimination and hemodynamic support and the sufferer deceased on the fourth day. Dramatic elevations of serum myoglobin (34,020 \u03bcg/L) and creatine kinase (219 \u03bckat/L) were accompanied by rise in cardiac troponin I and creatinine. Gas chromatography revealed ethanol 1.17 g/kg (blood) and 2.81 g/kg (urine). Thin layer chromatography and gas chromatography of gastric content and urine verified verapamil, moxonidin and urapidil fragment (diacerein method was unavailable). Atorvastatin and trandolapril concentrations (LC-MS(n)) equaled 277.7 \u03bcg/L and 57.5 \u03bcg/L, resp. (serum) and 8.15 \u03bcg/L and 602.3 \u03bcg/L, resp. (urine). Histology confirmed precipitates of myoglobin with acute necrosis of proximal renal tubules in association with striated muscle rhabdomyolysis and myocardial dystrophy. Cardiogenic-distributive shock in conjunction with acute renal failure due to the combined self-poisoning with vasoactive agents and atorvastatin were determined to be this decedent's immediate cause of death. The manner of death was assigned to be suicidal.", 
    "179": "Differential regulation of LHR in theca cells (TC) and granulosa cells (GC) is important for normal follicular development. Unlike TC, GC only acquire LH-responsiveness during the later stages of antral follicle development. This study tested the hypothesis that differential LH-responsiveness in these two cell types may be due, in part, to shifts in cellular patterns of alternatively spliced LHR mRNA transcripts which may not be obvious from analysis of total LHR gene expression. It also further explored the role of translation inhibition by an LHR binding protein (LHBP), normally associated with the production of endogenous cholesterol. LHR mRNA variation arises as a result of the alternative splicing of two variable deletion sites (VDS) designated 5' VDS and 3' VDS, and it was proposed that differences in cell sensitivity to LH may be due in part to variations in the pattern of the mRNA expression of the receptor variants. The outcomes of the present study support a dynamic multi-facetted regulation of LHR during pre-translation. Not only did the ratio between variants change during antral follicle growth and in vitro cell differentiation but also between TC and GC. Regulation could also be linked to LH concentration feedback mechanisms as the absence of LH caused cultured TC to markedly up-regulate amounts of LHR mRNA. In both TC and GC, LHR mRNA was greatly reduced after treatment to block mevalonate production in the de novo cholesterol pathway, adding further support for a regulatory mechanism linked to enriched cellular amounts of mevalonate kinase.", 
    "180": "The comparative new-user design is a principled approach to learning about the relative risks and benefits of starting different treatments in patients who have no history of use of the treatments being studied. Vandenbroucke and Pearce (Am J Epidemiol. 2015;182(10):826-833) discuss some problems inherent in incident exposure designs and argue that epidemiology may be harmed by a rigid requirement that follow-up can only begin at first exposure. In the present counterpoint article, a range of problems in pharmacoepidemiology that do not necessarily require that observation begin at first exposure are discussed. For example, among patients who are past or current users of a medication, we might want to know whether treatment should be augmented, switched, restarted, or discontinued. To answer these questions, a generalization of the new-user design, the treatment decision design, which identifies cohorts anchored at times when treatment decisions are being made, such as the evaluation of laboratory parameters, is discussed. The design aims to provide estimates that are directly relevant to physicians and patients, helping them to better understand the risks and benefits of the different treatment choices that they are considering.",
