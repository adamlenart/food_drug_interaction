    "0": "Hyperlipidemia, also known as high blood cholesterol, is a cardiovascular health risk that affects more than one third of adults in the United States. Statins are commonly prescribed and successful lipid-lowering medications that reduce the risks associated with cardiovascular disease. The side effects most commonly associated with statin use involve muscle cramping, soreness, fatigue, weakness, and, in rare cases, rapid muscle breakdown that can lead to death. Often, these side effects can become apparent during or after strenuous bouts of exercise. Although the mechanisms by which statins affect muscle performance are not entirely understood, recent research has identified some common causative factors. As musculoskeletal and exercise specialists, physical therapists have a unique opportunity to identify adverse effects related to statin use. The purposes of this perspective article are: (1) to review the metabolism and mechanisms of actions of statins, (2) to discuss the effects of statins on skeletal muscle function, (3) to detail the clinical presentation of statin-induced myopathies, (4) to outline the testing used to diagnose statin-induced myopathies, and (5) to introduce a role for the physical therapist for the screening and detection of suspected statin-induced skeletal muscle myopathy.",

    "2": "The study is an open, randomised, controlled, multi-centre trial involving 1000 participants at high risk of cardiovascular events recruited from mainstream general practices and Aboriginal Medical Services, followed for an average of 18 months. The participants will be randomised to one of two versions of the polypill, the version chosen by the treating health professional according to clinical features of the patient, or to usual care. The primary study outcomes will be changes, from baseline measures, in serum cholesterol and systolic blood pressure and self-reported current use of aspirin, a statin and at least two blood pressure lowering agents. Secondary study outcomes include cardiovascular events, renal outcomes, self-reported barriers to indicated therapy, prescription of indicated therapy, occurrence of serious adverse events and changes in quality-of-life.

In AD ss-amyloid protein (Ass) is deposited in the form of extracellular plaques and previous studies have determined Ass generation is cholesterol dependent. Hypercholesterolaemia has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of VaD. Due to the role of statins in cholesterol reduction it is biologically plausible they may be efficacious in the treatment of AD and dementia.",

All patients had a diagnosis of probable or possible AD according to standard criteria and most patients were established on a cholinesterase inhibitor. Treatment in ADCLT 2005 consisted of 80mg atorvastatin compared to placebo for 52 weeks, serum low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was reduced by 54% in the atorvastatin group. Treatment in Simons 2002 consisted of 40mg simvastatin compared to placebo for 26 weeks, serum LDL cholesterol was reduced by 52% in the simvastatin group. Treatment in LEADe 2010 consisted of 80mg atorvastatin compared to placebo for 72 weeks, LDL cholesterol was reduced by 50.2% by month 3 and remained constant through month 18. Change in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale- cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) from baseline was a primary outcome in 3 studies; when data were pooled there was considerable heterogeneity so the random effects model was used, statins did not provide any beneficial effect in this cognitive measure [mean difference -1.12, 95% CI -3.99, 1.75, p = 0.44]. All studies provided change in Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) from baseline; again random effects model was used due to considerable heterogeneity: there was no significant benefit from statins in this cognitive measure when the data were pooled [mean difference -1.53, 95% CI -3.28, 0.21, p = 0.08]. There was some evidence that patients on statins in ADCLT 2005 maintained better cognitive function if serum cholesterol was high at baseline, MMSE was higher at baseline or if they had an apolipoprotein E4 allele present. This would need to be confirmed in larger studies however. Treatment related adverse effects were available from two studies, LEADe 2010 and Simons 2002; when data were pooled there was no significant difference between statins and placebo [odds ratio 2.45, 95% CI 0.69, 8.62, p = 0.16]. There was no significant difference in global function, behaviour or activities of daily living in the statin and placebo groups.

Rat intestinal permeability of pravastatin was significantly reduced in the presence of 1,000\u00a0\u03bcM naringin. Similar results were obtained in in vivo absorption studies in rats. Furthermore, no significant change in the permeability was observed in the presence of elacridar, a potent inhibitor of both Mdr1 and Bcrp, though the permeability was significantly decreased in the presence of both elacridar and naringin, suggesting that Mdr1 and Bcrp are not involved in intestinal absorption of pravastatin.",

    "16": "Statin therapy is widely used in treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). It is well established that statin therapy is not associated with significant increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) or significant decrease in triglyceride level. Importantly, emerging evidence has suggested that low HDL-c and high triglyceride are strong risk factors associated with CVD. Niacin is a unique lipid-lowering medication with a capacity to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), triglyceride and increase HDL-c. In this context, there is considerable interest in trials involving niacin as monotherapy and in association with statins. Recent trials showed that the combination of statin and niacin is an effective treatment not only for dyslipidaemia (high LDL-c, high triglyceride and low HDL-c) but also for carotid intima-media thickness, one of the important features of atherosclerosis. Furthermore, niacin is distinguished by its unique capacity to effectively lower lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] levels. Flushing is the only factor that limits the wide use of niacin. The combination of statin and niacin has potential as a future treatment of atherogenic dyslipidemias; however, further evidence is needed. Importantly, the impact of niacin and statin on insulin sensitivity is not yet known. This article projects the potential benefits of current and possible future niacin clinical trials.", 
    "17": "Cholesterol is reportedly abundant in the endocrine secretory granule (SG) membrane. In this study, we examined the involvement of cholesterol biosynthesis intermediates and inhibitors in insulin secretion and SG formation mechanisms. There are two routes for the supply of cholesterol to the cells: one via de novo biosynthesis and the other via low-density lipoprotein receptor-mediated endocytosis. We found that insulin secretion and content are diminished by \u03b2-hydroxy-\u03b2-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A inhibitor lovastatin but not by lipoprotein depletion from the culture medium in MIN6 \u03b2-cells. Cholesterol biosynthesis intermediates mevalonate, squalene, and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, and the former two increased insulin content. The glucose-stimulated insulin secretion-enhancing effect of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate was also confirmed in perifusion with rat islets. Morphologically, mevalonate and squalene increased the population of SGs without affecting their size. In contrast, lovastatin increased the SG size with reduction of insulin-accumulating dense cores, leading to a decrease in insulin content. Furthermore, insulin was secreted in a constitutive manner, indicating disruption of regulated insulin secretion. Because secretogranin III, a cholesterol-binding SG-residential granin-family protein, coincides with SG localization based on the cholesterol composition, secretogranin III may be associated with insulin-accumulating mechanisms. Although the SG membrane exhibits a high cholesterol composition, we could not find detergent-resistant membrane regions using a lipid raft-residential protein flotillin and a fluorescent cholesterol-Si-pyrene probe as markers on a sucrose-density gradient fractionation. We suggest that the high cholesterol composition of SG membrane with 40-50 mol% is crucial for insulin secretion and SG formation functions.",

    "20": "Controlling for temperature, \u03b2-blocker, ace-inhibitor and aspirin medications rendered the structural break indicator insignificant among all age groups for men. Diuretic, statin and calcium channel blocker medications could not account for the break point for men aged 75-84 years. \u03b2-Blocker, aspirin and calcium channel blocker medications account for mortality trends among all age groups among women. Ace inhibitor and statin could not account for trends amongst women aged 65-74 years and nitrates and diuretics did not account for trends for any age group.", 
    "21": "Cardiovascular prescribing accounts for the trend break in circulatory mortality among men and women aged \u226565 years after 1999 in Ireland but the effect of prescribing is lower for women. \u03b2-Blocker, ace inhibitor and aspirin medications were more successful than statin, diuretic and nitrates in accounting for the trends.", 
    "22": "C-reactive protein is postulated to embody an index that can reflect cardiovascular risk and can be used to independently predict major cardiovascular events and mortality. On the other hand, credible experimental data have become available that demonstrate the abundant presence of C-reactive protein in atherosclerotic lesions and, moreover, identify C-reactive protein as an initiator of several pathogenic pathways that can cause atherogenic changes. Consequently, there has been a paradigm shift in which C-reactive protein is no longer regarded as merely an indicator of cardiovascular risk, but increasingly considered a direct partaker in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. These data underscore the need to explore risk-reducing interventions that selectively inhibit C-reactive protein activity as a novel strategy to prevent clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis.",

He denied other complaints, except fatigue, mild pretibial edema, and progressive bilateral leg pain and cramping that began 7 days before. At the time of presentation, he was receiving aspirin 100 mg/d, clopidogrel 75 mg/d, ramipril 2.5 mg/d, pantoprazole 40 mg/d, danazol 600 mg/d, prednisone 60 mg/d, simvastatin 40 mg/d, and long-acting insulin 24 IU/d. After the injuries were treated, he was diagnosed with collapse and nasal contusion, and discharged without any changes in his therapy. Two days after initial presentation, the patient was readmitted to the hospital due to nausea, dark urine, and oliguria. All clinical signs (oliguria, dark urine, muscle pain, and tenderness) and laboratory markers (creatine kinase levels approximately 100 times the upper limit of normal, along with hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, and hypoalbuminemia) were consistent with severe rhabdomyolysis. Despite intravenous hydration, forced diuresis, and hemodialysis, oliguria persisted and the patient died 6 days after admission. A score of 5 on the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale was consistent with a probable association of rhabdomyolysis and concomitant treatment with simvastatin and danazol in this patient.", 
    "26": "Statin-induced rhabdomyolysis must be considered whenever muscle or motor symptoms occur, especially when concomitant treatment with known inhibitors of statin metabolism is administered. Patients must be strictly monitored and the statin should be promptly discontinued with the onset of first signs and symptoms of myopathy. Clinicians should be aware of the potentially fatal consequences of both approved and unapproved treatments and be alert for the early detection of toxicity.",

Among recipients with cyclosporine-based postgrafting immunosuppression (n = 821), statin use at the time of transplant (6%) was associated with a decreased risk of extensive chronic GVHD (cGVHD) (multivariate hazard ratio [HR], 0.62; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.4-1.0; P = .05) and an increased risk of recurrent malignancy (HR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.0-3.0; P = .04). Recipient statin use, however, had no apparent impact on the risks of cGVHD and recurrent malignancy among recipients given tacrolimus-based immunosuppression (n = 385; 8% statin treated). Risks of acute GVHD, nonrelapse mortality, and overall mortality were not significantly affected by recipient statin use. Hence, recipient statin treatment at the time of allogeneic HCT may decrease the risk of cGVHD in patients with cyclosporine-based immunosuppression, but at the expense of a compromised graft-versus-tumor effect.",

The aim of this study was to improve the dissolution rate of simvastatin using spherical crystallization method. The drug was dissolved in boiling dichloromethane as the good solvent. This solution was added to 5\u00b0C water as the non-solvent. After sedimentation, isopropyl acetate was added as the bridging solvent. At the end the crystals were collected and dried for 12\u2009h in a 50\u00b0C oven. The FTIR and DSC results showed no change in the drug after crystallization process. XRPD studies showed the sharp peaks are present in the diffractograms of spherical crystals with minor reduction in height of the peaks. The particle size of spherical aggregates was about 37 \u03bcm and the dissolution efficiency of simvastatin up to 60\u2009min increased to about 2-fold in phosphate buffer solution containing 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (pH 7) using the rotating paddle method. Spherical crystals showed enhanced solubility than untreated powder possibly due to partial conversion to amorphous form.

    "33": "The concept of \"polypill\" for cardiovascular prevention was introduced in 2003 in a landmark paper of the British Medical Journal. A model based on results provided by evidence-based medicine suggested that a \"polypill\", that contains a statin, three blood pressure lowering drugs (each at half standard dose), aspirin and folic acid, would result in an 80% reduction in the incidence of coronary and cerebrovascular events, while being associated with a good tolerance profile and offering a favourable cost-effectiveness ratio. The present paper aims at presenting the new advances dealing with this new paradigm in cardiovascular prevention. We will present the progresses of the \"polypill\" concept since 2003, the results of a first controlled clinical trial, the pharmaceutical feasibility for routine clinical use and the potential pharmaco-economical impacts of such a strategy. The \"polypill\" may offer a solution to avoid physician's clinical inertia and reduce patients's lack of compliance, two drawbacks in the field of cardiovascular prevention.", 
    "34": "Statins, initially developed as antimicrobials, are primarily considered cholesterol-lowering agents. Recently, researchers discovered anti-inflammatory properties of statins. Studies on the effects of statins and the alterations noted include: bench work that supported a Th1/Th2 skew to Th1, altered lymphocyte migration, inhibition of MHC-II induction and cytokine release on antigen-presenting cells, inhibition of mast cell degranulation and inhibition of Th17 cells and IL-17 production. In addition to the anti-inflammatory properties, statins have been found to induce apoptosis in melanoma models. The potential therapeutic value of statins is illustrated in the management of alopecia areata, atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus, cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, cutaneous melanoma, mastocytosis and more. This manuscript presents a comprehensive review of statins and their potential dermatologic application.",

    "48": "Pharmaceutical expenditures in ambulatory care rose rapidly in Europe in the 1990s and early 2000s. This was typically faster than other components of healthcare spending, leading to reforms to moderate future growth. A number of these centered on generic medicines with measures to lower reimbursed prices as well as enhance their prescribing and dispensing. The principal objective of this paper is to review additional measures that some European countries can adopt to further reduce reimbursed prices for generics. Secondly, potential approaches to address concerns with generics when they arise to maximize savings. Measures to enhance the prescribing of generics will also briefly be discussed. A narrative review of the extensive number of publications and associated references from the co-authors was conducted supplemented with known internal or web-based articles. In addition, health authority and health insurance databases, principally from 2001 to 2007, were analyzed to assess the impact of the various measures on price reductions for generic omeprazole and generic simvastatin vs. pre-patent loss prices, as well as overall efficiency in Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI) and statin prescribing. The various initiatives generally resulted in considerable lowering of the prices of generics as well as specifically for generic omeprazole and generic simvastatin vs. pre-patent loss prices. At one stage in the UK, generic simvastatin was just 2% of the originator price. These measures also led to increased efficiency for PPI and statin prescribing with reimbursed expenditure for the PPIs and statins either falling or increasing at appreciably lower rates than increases in utilization. A number of strategies have also been introduced to address patient and physician concerns with generics to maximize savings. In conclusion, whilst recent reforms have been successful, European countries must continue learning from each other to fund increased volumes and new innovative drugs as resource pressures grow. Policies regarding generics and their subsequent impact on reimbursement and utilization of single sourced products will continue to play a key role to release valuable resources. However, there must continue to be strategies to address concerns with generics when they exist.",

SDS-PAGE of chloroform-methanol extracts of membranes from control and pravastatin-treated cells revealed changes in the amount of AtpK proteolipids, which suggests that pravastatin modifies cell-membrane composition, hereby modulating the properties of some membrane-bound enzymes participating in energy transformation in methanoarchaea.", 
    "53": "Lipid changes with statin treatments vary greatly between individuals for reasons which are largely unknown. This study was performed to examine the genetic determinants of lipid responses to rosuvastatin in Chinese patients. A total of 125 polymorphisms in 61 candidate genes from 386 Chinese patients were analyzed for association with the lipid responses to rosuvastatin 10\u2009mg daily. The polymorphisms most highly associated with the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) response were 421C>A in the ATP-binding cassette G2 gene (P=9.2\u00d710), followed by 18281G>A (V257M) in the flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 gene (P=0.0002), 1421C>G in the lipoprotein lipase gene (P=0.002), and rs4420638 in the apolipoprotein E/C-I/C-IV/C-II gene cluster (P=0.004). Patients with familial hypercholesterolemia had 2.6% smaller reductions in LDL-C compared with patients without familial hypercholesterolemia. This study identified some genetic determinants of LDL-C response to rosuvastatin in Chinese patients, which need to be replicated in other populations.",

Five years of NSAID, statin, and thiazide diuretic use was associated with PSA levels lower by 6%, 13%, and 26%, respectively. The combination of statins and thiazide diuretics showed the greatest reduction in PSA levels: 36% after 5 years. Concurrent calcium channel blocker use minimizes or negates the inverse relationship of statin use and PSA level.",

Although originally developed to improve lipid profile, statins have demonstrated a surplus of beneficial pleiotropic effects, including improved endothelial function, reduced inflammation, and increased tolerance to ischemia-reperfusion injury. In preclinical studies, increased ecto-5'-nucleotidase activity, the key enzyme in extracellular adenosine formation, plays an important role in these effects. Because human data are absent, we explored the effects of rosuvastatin on ecto-5'-nucleotidase activity and the clinical relevance of increased extracellular adenosine during ischemia in humans in vivo. The forearm vasodilator responses to 3 increasing periods of forearm ischemia (2, 5, and 13 minutes) were determined during placebo and caffeine (an adenosine receptor antagonist) infusion into the brachial artery. At the end of an 8-day treatment period with rosuvastatin (20 mg per day), this whole procedure was repeated. During both experiments, ecto-5'-nucleotidase activity was determined. Vasodilator responses are expressed as the percentage increase in forearm blood flow ratio from baseline. Rosuvastatin increased ecto-5'-nucleotidase activity by 49\u00b117% and enhanced the vasodilator response after 2, 5, and 13 minutes of ischemia in the absence (146\u00b119, 330\u00b126, and 987\u00b1133 to 312\u00b177, 566\u00b1107, and 1533\u00b1267) but not in the presence of caffeine (98\u00b125, 264\u00b154, and 727\u00b1111 versus 95\u00b119, 205\u00b134, and 530\u00b162). Rosuvastatin increases extracellular formation of adenosine in humans in vivo probably by enhancing ecto-5'-nucleotidase activity. This action results in the improvement of reactive hyperemia and may further enhance the clinical benefit of statins, in particular in conditions of ischemia.",

Eighty volunteers with mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia received either simvastatin 40\u00a0mg or placebo for 6 weeks. Lipids, oxidized LDL (ox-LDL), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, oxygenated carotenoids (lutein, zeaxanthin, \u03b2-cryptoxanthin) and hydrocarbon carotenoids (\u03b1-carotene, \u03b2-carotene, lycopene) were measured in plasma. Simvastatin use was associated with significant reductions in total cholesterol, LDL, ox-LDL and CRP. Simvastatin therapy also resulted in reduced plasma levels of both oxygenated and hydrocarbon carotenoids. However, when adjusted for lipids, all carotenoids except \u03b2-cryptoxanthin showed significant increases after simvastatin therapy. Both crude and lipid-adjusted carotenoids were inversely correlated with CRP and IL-6 in plasma but the change in carotenoid status during simvastatin therapy was not specifically related to any changes in inflammatory markers.", 
    "61": "To summarize, the change in carotenoid status during simvastatin therapy was mainly attributed to the lowering of cholesterol and not to the suppression of inflammatory activity. After adjustment for lipids, the levels of lutein, lycopene, \u03b1-carotene and \u03b2-carotene were significantly increased by simvastatin suggesting an increased ratio of carotenoids per particle.",

Healthy Chinese males were randomly assigned to receive 20 mg of either the test or reference formulation, and 13 blood samples were obtained over a 48-hour interval. Plasma concentrations of parent atorvastatin and ortho-hydroxy-atorvastatin (primary active metabolite) were simultaneously determined using a validated liquid chromatography-isotopic dilution mass spectrometry method. Pharmacokinetic parameters, including C(max), T(max), t((1/2)), AUC(0-t), and AUC(0-infinity)), were calculated. The 2 formulations were to be considered bioequivalent if 90% CIs for the log transformed ratios of AUC and C(max) of atorvastatin were within the predetermined bioequivalence range (0.80-1.25 for AUC and 0.70-1.43 for C(max)) as established by the State Food and Drug Administration of China.

    "71": "A large body of evidence indicates that endothelial dysfunction is a characteristic of patients with arterial hypertension. As functional abnormalities lead to impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation, this early step of atherogenesis is potentially reversible. In addition to reducing blood pressure, the major families of anti-hypertensive drugs have a number of pleiotropic effects that could improve endothelial function. In particular, the renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in the pathogenesis of both arterial hypertension and endothelial dysfunction, and so drugs capable of limiting the dangerous effects of this hormonal axis, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and renin inhibitors, could help prevent/delay/reverse the atherosclerotic process. New third-generation \u03b2-blockers and 5-phosphodiesterase inhibitors may affect endothelial function. Furthermore, the HMGCoA-reductase inhibitors currently used to reduce cholesterol levels have major pleiotropic anti-inflammatory and anti-hypertensive effects. The preservation or recovery of endothelial function in hypertensive patients is crucial to inhibit the development of atherosclerosis and the onset of cardiovascular events. This review focuses on the ancillary effects of hypertensive drugs and HMGCoA-reductase inhibitors that go beyond lowering blood pressure and cholesterol levels.", 
    "72": "1. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether or not pitavastatin ameliorates diabetic nephropathy and if inhibition of the rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is associated with any renoprotective effects. Pitavastatin (10mg/ kg/day) and/or spironolactone (100mg/kg/day) were given by gavage for 3weeks to uninephrectomized rats with streptozotocin-induced diabetes. 2. Pitavastatin or spironolactone significantly reduced proteinuria and collagen deposition, and normalized creatinine clearance, serum creatinine levels and blood urea nitrogen concentrations. 3. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that the renal expression of collagenI, transforming growth factor-\u03b2 and monocyte chemoattractant-1 were increased in diabetic rats and reduced by the pitavastatin and/or spironolactone treatment. 4. These agents also decreased angiotensin converting enzyme expression and aldosterone concentrations in the renal homogenate, but had no effect on blood glucose, haemoglobinA(1c) , and plasma total cholesterol, Na(+) , K(+) , aldosterone and NOx levels, or on systolic blood pressure measured by the tail-cuff method. Interestingly, cotreatment with pitavastatin and spironolactone did not result in additional normalization. 5. These results suggest that pitavastatin shows renoprotective effects against diabetic nephropathy mediated in part by inhibition of the renal RAAS, including the suppression of angiotensin-converting enzyme expression and aldosterone production.",

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from 15 healthy subjects were incubated for 24 h as follows: (1) without and with 0.125 or 0.25 microM lycopene, (2) without and with 10 or 50 mM pravastatin or simvastatin, and (3) with lycopene and with one of the statins together at the respective doses. The production of the following cytokines was assessed: interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-1ra, IL-2, and IL-10, as well as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and interferon gamma (IFNgamma). The results showed that lycopene and simvastatin applied together reduced TNFalpha and IFNgamma secretion, and abolished the increased production of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-1gamma caused by incubation with simvastatin only, an observation suggesting that simultaneous administration of both substances may reduce inflammatory responses.", 
    "74": "Beyond lowering lipid levels, 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) have been shown to possess antioxidant properties, which may explain some of their beneficial effects in reducing atherosclerosis. We sought to determine whether circulating oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) levels differ between subjects with isolated hypercholesterolemia and combined hyperlipidemia, as well as the effect of simvastatin on circulating ox-LDL according to the type of dyslipidemia. Twenty-five subjects with total cholesterol >200 mg/dl and triglycerides <150 mg/dl, and 22 subjects with total cholesterol >200 mg/dl and triglycerides >150 mg/dl were treated with 40 mg simvastatin daily for 3 months. Serum lipids, C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, ox-LDL, and free radicals were measured at baseline and after 3 months of treatment. In both groups studied, simvastatin significantly improved lipids, and reduced C-reactive protein and fibrinogen levels. Free radicals were significantly reduced only in subjects with hypercholesterolemia. Subjects with combined hyperlipidemia had significantly higher baseline levels of ox-LDL compared to those with hypercholesterolemia (64.6 U/l vs 53.5 U/l, P = 0.03). Ox-LDL levels were reduced by 12% in subjects with hypercholesterolemia (P = 0.03) and by 26% in subjects with combined hyperlipidemia (P = 0.001) after simvastatin treatment. In conclusion, subjects with combined hyperlipidemia have increased levels of circulating ox-LDL compared to subjects with isolated hypercholesterolemia. Simvastatin significantly reduced circulating ox-LDL in both groups, but whether this reduction is related to clinical outcomes remains to be shown.",

Our group performed studies aimed at investigating the mechanism of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor-mediated endothelial protection from IR injury, in particular the role of COX-2, in a human in vivo model of IR-induced endothelial dysfunction. We demonstrated that HMG-CoA reductase inhibition protects against IR-induced endothelial damage, an effect that was lost upon COX-2 inhibition. These observations may suggest a mechanistic explanation for the cardioprotection observed in clinical settings such as percutaneous coronary interventions and coronary artery bypass surgery and may also propose a mechanistic hypothesis for the reported cardiotoxic effects of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors observed in clinical studies.

Neurological deficit, clot burden, and lesion volume were assessed after treatment with tPA in one experiment, and after treatment with simvastatin in another. In the tPA experiment, treatment with 10mg/kg of tPA IV (with 20% given as an initial bolus, and 80% given as an infusion over the remaining 30 min), starting within an hour after stroke, resulted in significant reductions, compared with control animals, in neurological deficit (mean+/-SD neuroscores of 21.5+/-21.1 and 30+/-29.3, respectively, p=0.005), clot burden (p=0.010) and lesion volume (p=0.049) at 24h. In the simvastatin experiment on the other hand, treatment with a 20mg/kg of simvastatin as a single intraperitoneal dose within an hour after stroke resulted in no salutary effects on neurological deficit, clot burden or lesion volume compared with controls at 24h. These results suggest that more research needs to be done to fully ascertain the therapeutic potential and optimal dosing paradigm of a post-ischemic treatment with a statin.",

    "115": "It is well known that statins improve the prognosis of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Recent randomized control trials (RCTs) of statins conducted in Western countries revealed greater avoidance of cardiovascular events if low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reached lower levels. However, it is obvious that this evidence cannot be unconditionally extrapolated to Asians because there are great differences between Japanese and Caucasians in the absolute onset rate of CVD. Results of RCTs with Japanese for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular events indicate that we could benefit from statins with a relatively higher target LDL-C as compared with Western populations. In this situation, not only strong but also standard statins are still advantageous and the so-called pleiotropic effects of the drugs come to the fore. In this review, we first discuss differences in the absolute event rate in different populations, and then the lack of evidence for recommended LDL-C treatment targets, particularly in Japanese, although there is reliable evidence for reductions in plaque volume in coronary arteries from RCTs recently conducted in Japan with aggressive lipid-lowering therapy with strong statins. Finally, based on recent data, we propose a new concept regarding the secondary prevention of CVD for current Japanese populations.", 
    "116": "Large clinical trials have elucidated that lipid-lowering therapy using statins reduces cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). The benefit of statin therapy is proportional to the achieved low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level (LDL-C) up to 70 mg/dl. On the basis of this evidence, the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology offer an optimal LDL-C goal of <70 mg/dl for patients with a very high risk of CAD. In addition, with regard to acute coronary syndrome (ACS), which has a high risk for future cardiac events because of the presence of vulnerable plaque, intensive lipid-lowering therapy from the early stage is the standard treatment. On the other hand, the mechanism of inhibition of cardiac events by statins is thought to be predominantly based on stabilization of plaque, but research on the role of plaque regression is also advancing. The clinical significance of intensive lipid-lowering therapy using statins will be discussed from the following standpoints: (1) large-scale clinical trials around the world; (2) the relationship with plaque regression and stabilization; (3) the relationship with the diverse effects of statins; and (4) evidence generated from Japanese patients.",

    "121": "Androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer leads to a significant increase of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), which is generally viewed as beneficial, particularly for cardiovascular disease, but the effect of HDL on prostate cancer is unknown. In this study, we investigated the effect of HDL on prostate cancer cell proliferation, migration, intracellular cholesterol levels, and the role of cholesterol transporters, namely ABCA1, ABCG1, and SR-BI in these processes. HDL induced cell proliferation and migration of the androgen-independent PC-3 and DU145 cells by a mechanism involving extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 and Akt, but had no effect on the androgen-dependent LNCaP cell, which did not express ABCA1 unlike the other cell lines. Treatment with HDL did not significantly alter the cholesterol content of the cell lines. Knockdown of ABCA1 but not ABCG1 or SR-BI by small interfering RNA (siRNA) inhibited HDL-induced cell proliferation, migration, and ERK1/2 and Akt signal transduction in PC-3 cells. Moreover, after treatment of LNCaP cells with charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum, ABCA1 was induced \u223c10-fold, enabling HDL to induce ERK1/2 activation, whereas small interfering RNA knockdown of ABCA1 inhibited HDL-induced ERK1/2 activation. Simvastatin, which inhibited ABCA1 expression in PC-3 and DU145 cells, attenuated HDL-induced PC-3 and DU145 cell proliferation, migration, and ERK1/2 and Akt phosphorylation. In human prostate biopsy samples, ABCA1 mRNA expression was \u223c2-fold higher in the androgen deprivation therapy group than in subjects with benign prostatic hyperplasia or pretreatment prostate cancer groups. In summary, these results suggest that HDL by an ABCA1-dependent mechanism can mediate signal transduction, leading to increased proliferation and migration of prostate cancer cells.",

Atorvastatin did not reduce left ventricular fibrosis and had minimal effects on left ventricular function. Right ventricular myocardial performance index was markedly improved by therapy (P < .01). CHF caused a restrictive lung syndrome with a downward shift of the respiratory pressure-volume loop, increased dry lung weight, and interstitial fibrosis that were greatly improved by atorvastatin.

    "125": "Previous studies have shown that NCX 6550 (NCX), a nitric oxide (NO)-donating pravastatin, induces anti-inflammatory effects in murine macrophage cell lines. Here, we have studied its activity in human monocyte/macrophages, by investigating cytokine release, NF-\u03baB translocation and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3) expression and function. For comparison, pravastatin, isosorbide-5-mononitrate (ISMN), sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and the PPAR\u03b3 ligand 15-deoxy-\u0394(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2) (PGJ) were also tested. Monocytes and macrophages (MDM: monocyte-derived macrophages) were isolated from healthy donors; cytokine release was measured by ELISA, NF-\u03baB by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and PPAR\u03b3 by Western blot and Real-Time PCR. NCX (1 nM-50 \u03bcM) dose-dependently inhibited phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced TNF-\u03b1 release from monocytes (IC(50)=240 nM) and MDM (IC(50)=52 nM). At 50 \u03bcM, it was more effective than pravastatin, ISMN and SNP (P<0.05), but less efficient than PGJ. Similar results were obtained for IL-6. Likewise, NCX was more effective than pravastatin and the other NO donors in inhibiting PMA-induced NF-\u03baB translocation in both cell types, and, at the highest concentration, significantly (P<0.05) enhanced PPAR\u03b3 protein expression in monocytes. We conclude that NCX 6550 exerts a significant anti-inflammatory activity in human monocyte/macrophages, that is also contributed by its NO donating properties, as the effects exerted by NCX are significantly higher than those evoked by pravastatin in many experimental assays. These data further indicate that the incorporation of a NO-donating moiety into a statin structure confers pharmacological properties which may translate into useful therapeutic benefits.",

Pitavastatin is primarily metabolized via glucuronidation and is not a substrate for the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme, thus avoiding the potential for cytochrome P450-mediated drug-drug interactions. Clinical trials have shown that pitavastatin is comparable to atorvastatin and simvastatin in improving lipid measures, and more potent than pravastatin. Pitavastatin is effective in reducing triglycerides and increasing HDL-cholesterol, so it will be particularly beneficial in treating patients with mixed dyslipidemia.

Some pharmaceutical companies have minimized side effects and stated that dose has no relation to incidence. To the contrary, dose is related to side effects with all statins. Myopathy occurs in up to 10.5% of patients taking a high dose. There is an attempt to sell statins that have lost patent protection over-the-counter. However, evidence supports medical supervision as offering greatest patient safety. Concerns were raised about ezetimibe after the initial ENHANCE (efficacy) and SEAS (cancer risk) study but these concerns appear to have been answered. Fenofibrate can be used with a statin but gemfibrozil is contraindicated. Coenzyme Q-10 possibly helps to mitigate the risk of myopathy with a statin but evidence is not universally accepted. JUPITER represented a valid outcomes study but made a claim that rosuvastatin has special value in risk management because of decreased high sensitivity C-Reactive Protein.

In this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study, patients were treated with simvastatin (40\u2009mg\u2009day(-1); n=15) or placebo (n=16) for 8 weeks. Before and after treatment, we measured MSNA, blood pressure and heart rate. Baroreceptor control of the heart rate, or baroreceptor sensitivity (BRS), was computed by the sequence method, a cross-analysis of systolic blood pressure and the electrocardiogram R-R interval. Blood samples were tested for plasma levels of catecholamines, neuropeptide Y, aldosterone, endothelin and renin activity. Simvastatin significantly reduced MSNA (from 36.5 \u00b1 5 to 27.8 \u00b1 6 bursts per min, P=0.001), heart rate (from 77 \u00b1 6.7 to 71 \u00b1 6.1 beats per min, P=0.01) and both total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (from 249 \u00b1 30.6 to 184 \u00b1 28.3\u2009mg\u2009dl(-1), P=0.001 and from 169 \u00b1 30.6 to 117 \u00b1 31.2\u2009mg\u2009dl(-1), P=0.01, respectively).

No changes were observed in systolic or diastolic blood pressures, or in plasma levels of catecholamines, neuropeptide Y, endothelin, aldosterone and renin activity. After simvastatin therapy, MSNA and BRS were inversely related (r=-0.94, P<0.05).

    "140": "In this paper, we have investigated the mechanism of phototoxicity of fluvastatin, an 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, in human keratinocytes cell line NCTC-2544. Fluvastatin underwent rapid photodegradation upon Ultraviolet-A (UVA) irradiation in buffered aqueous solution as shown by the changes in absorption spectra. Interestingly, no isosbestic points were observed but only a fast appearance of a spectral change, indicative of the formation of a new chromophore. The isolation and characterization of the main photoproduct revealed the formation of a polycyclic compound with a benzocarbazole-like structure. This product was also evaluated for its phototoxic potential. Cell phototoxicity was evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide test after 72 h from the irradiation in the presence of fluvastatin. The results showed a reduction of the cell viability in a concentration and UVA dose-dependent manner. Surprisingly, the photoproduct showed a dramatic decrease of the cell viability that occurred at concentrations of an order of magnitude lower than the parent compound. Flow cytometric analysis indicated that fluvastatin and its main photoproduct induced principally necrosis as revealed by the large appearance of propidium iodide-positive cells and confirmed also by the rapid drop in cellular adenosine triphosphate levels. Interestingly, a rapid increase of intracellular calcium followed by an extensive cell lipid membrane peroxidation and a significant oxidation of model proteins were induced by fluvastatin and its photoproduct, suggesting that these compounds exerted their toxic effect mainly in the cellular membranes. On the basis of our results, the phototoxicity of fluvastatin may be mediated by the formation of benzocarbazole-like photoproduct that acts as strong photosensitizer.",

She was being treated with atorvastatin and verapamil in addition to a few other medications. She complained of nausea, vomiting, myalgia, generalized weakness and dark urine. Initial evaluation revealed clinical icterus and mild mental confusion. Admission laboratory results showed features of multiple organ dysfunction. Over the course of four to five days the patient deteriorated to multiple organ failure resulting in death. Extensive work up for the etiology for multiple organ failure was noncontributory. We presume the cause for multiple organ failure could be the result of drug-drug interaction, atorvastatin and verapamil, as verapamil is known to increase the serum concentration of atorvastatin significantly.", 
    "150": "Prostate specific antigen (PSA) is a serine protease that is exclusively produced in the prostate, and its detection is the only laboratory test available for screening men for prostate cancer (PC). The interpretation of the assay is difficult since it is specific for prostate tissue and cellular growth, but not for PC. Pharmacologic therapy for hyperlipidemia, such as statins, may influence prostate cellular growth and subsequently PSA levels in patients. Dysregulated cellular growth in the prostate is mediated by inhibiting the rate-limiting pathway step in cholesterol synthesis, thereby decreasing isoprenylate intermediates, decreasing cholesterol rich cellular membrane domains, and down-regulating androgen and estrogen receptors. Statins, with variable efficacy, have been previously shown to inhibit cellular inflammation, angiogenesis, proliferation, migration/adhesion, and invasion, while promoting apoptosis in prostate cells by inhibiting the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate. An individual statin's molecular structure, need for enzymatic conversion, bioavailability, and peripheral tissue concentration may partially account for differing properties. By inhibiting prostatic cellular growth and promoting apoptosis, statins may subsequently decrease PSA levels, an effect recently observed in cohorts. There is scientific and clinical evidence supporting the observations that statins are associated with an overall reduction in serum PSA in men, when used for greater than 6 months, and especially when used for greater than 2 years.", 
    "151": "In addition to their primary role in lowering plasma cholesterol, statins have a variety of other actions. We studied the effect of simvastatin treatment on burn injury-induced changes in regional glucose metabolism. Groups of six CD-1 mice (male, approximately 25 g) were subjected to full thickness 30% total body surface area (TBSA) burn injury. The animals were treated with simvastatin at various doses (0.02, 0.2 and 2.0 microg/kg, i.p.) for seven days. The following morning, mice were injected with 18F labeled 2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18FDG) (50 microCi) via the tail vein. Approximately 60 min after tracer injection, the animals were sacrificed and biodistribution was measured. A sub-set of burned mice with and without statin treatment and sham controls was injected with approximately 1.0 mCi of FDG and tracer distribution was evaluated by microPET. In addition, oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) were performed in other groups of burned mice with and without statin treatment and sham controls. In the heart and brown adipose tissue (BAT), burn injury produced a highly significant increase in 18FDG accumulation (p<0.01), whereas tracer accumulation in brain was markedly reduced (p<0.01). In the heart and BAT, simvastatin treatment produced dose-dependent reductions in 18FDG accumulation. In contrast, simvastatin did not affect 18FDG accumulation in the brain. There was no effect of simvastatin treatment on 18FDG accumulation in the heart, BAT or brain of sham-treated mice. Less pronounced effects were detected in other tissues that were studied. All animals had normal plasma glucose levels (approximately 90 mg/dl). The OGTTs demonstrated insulin resistance in burn injured mice which was reversed by statin treatment. Our results indicate that simvastatin reverses burn-induced increases in 18FDG accumulation by the heart and BAT in a dose-dependent manner but does not affect burn-induced reductions of 18FDG accumulation by the brain. These findings suggest that statins exert some of their effects by tissue specific modulation of glucose metabolism.", 
    "152": "Drug-drug interaction between statins metabolised by cytochrome P450 3A4 and clopidogrel have been claimed to attenuate the inhibitory effect of clopidogrel. However, published data regarding this drug-drug interaction are controversial. We aimed to determine the effect of fluvastatin and atorvastatin on the inhibitory effect of dual antiplatelet therapy with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and clopidogrel. One hundred one patients with symptomatic stable coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention and drug-eluting stent implantation were enrolled in this prospective randomised study. After an interval of two weeks under dual antiplatelet therapy with ASA and clopidogrel, without any lipid-lowering drug, 87 patients were randomised to receive a treatment with either fluvastatin 80 mg daily or atorvastatin 40 mg daily in addition to the dual antiplatelet therapy for one month. Platelet aggregation was assessed using light transmission aggregometry and whole blood impedance platelet aggregometry prior to randomisation and after one month of receiving assigned statin and dual antiplatelet treatment. Platelet function assessment after one month of statin and dual antiplatelet therapy did not show a significant change in platelet aggregation from 1st to 2nd assessment for either statin group. There was also no difference between atorvastatin and fluvastatin treatment arms. In conclusion, neither atorvastatin 40 mg daily nor fluvastatin 80 mg daily administered in combination with standard dual antiplatelet therapy following coronary drug-eluting stent implantation significantly interfere with the antiaggregatory effect of ASA and clopidogrel.", 
    "153": "Congestive heart failure (CHF) remains a leading cause of mortality in the developed world. The complex mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of heart failure (HF) explain some of the limited impact of current recognised therapeutic strategies. There is, therefore, a definite need for new alternative molecular and biological pathways to address the treatment of this condition. Over the past decade, much research has focussed upon identifying the ideal cell type to promote myocardial regeneration. Recently, striking reports suggested the concept that bone-marrow (BM)-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) participate in cardiac regeneration and function recovery in the setting of progressive HF. The modulation of this complex interaction between the BM and the circulating EPCs could be at the crossroad of multiple therapeutic strategies aimed to protect or restore the myocardium in the setting of the CHF. However, there are uncertainties and unresolved issues regarding the mechanisms possibly responsible for the functional benefits observed in chronic experimental and pre-clinical studies. Hence, the BM-cardiac axis concept has created overwhelming enthusiasm and subsequent scepticism in the field of cardiac repair and regeneration. Further intensive research in basic science and clinical arenas are needed to elucidate the potential association between BM and heart function recovery, particularly in the progression towards advance stages of CHF. In this review, we focus on the importance of the BM-cardiac axis and BM-derived EPCs in the pathophysiology, clinical progression and potential treatment of CHF.",

    "159": "Recent findings suggest that altered cholesterol homeostasis may contribute to the pathophysiology of Huntington's disease (HD). To understand the underlying mechanisms, here we used a combination of two-photon microscopy, epifluorescence, and biochemical methods to visualize and quantify lipid distribution in cell cultures expressing mutant huntingtin. Such expression promotes lipid imbalance, and cholesterol accumulation in cellular and murine models and in HD-affected human brains. Interestingly, cells expressing mutant huntingtin also showed higher content of ordered domains in their plasma membranes. These findings correlated with high levels of caveolin-1 and glycosphingolipid GM1, two well-defined markers of cholesterol-enriched domains, at the cell surface. In addition, cells expressing mutant huntingtin showed increased localization of NMDA receptors with cholesterol-enriched domains, contributing to increased NMDA receptor susceptibility to excitotoxic insults. Treatment with simvastatin or \u03b2-cyclodextrin, two cholesterol-lowering drugs, reduced the content of ordered domains at the cell surface, which in turn, protected cells against NMDA-mediated excitotoxicity. Taken together, our results indicate that mutant huntingtin produces accumulation of cholesterol and alters its cellular distribution that contributes to NMDA-mediated excitotoxicity. Administration of drugs that recover this effect, such as simvastatin could be beneficial for the treatment of HD.",

They were retrospectively analyzed according to whether they were discharged on a statin, and their HF outcome was evaluated independent of overt clinical ischemic events.

Univariate analysis showed fewer HF readmissions (statin group, 7% vs no-statin group, 32%; P<.001) and HF deaths (statin group, 4% vs no-statin group, 13%; P=.002). Multivariate analysis by logistic regression showed that these effects due to statins are independent of cholesterol levels, age, sex, drugs, revascularization, and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) or cardiac resynchronization therapy. Statins have an important role in independently improving HF outcome in post-myocardial infarction patients with left ventricular ejection fraction < 40%.",

Our results provide evidence for the therapeutic potential of pravastatin in the treatment of acute lung injury and pulmonary fibrosis.", 
    "193": "The article is devoted to the problem of treatment patients with arterial hypertension and dyslipidemia. Questions of adherence to antihypertensive and lipid lowering therapy are discussed. Effects of first fixed combination amlodopine and atorvastatin, which deals with more than one risk factor, are analyzed.", 
    "194": "The review describes possible role of kinesins in development of coronary heart disease and efficacy of treatment with statins. Fourty five kinesins are represented in human body making up a superfamily of universal and simplest motor proteins which are expressed almost in all tissues. Level of kinesin 6 is 5% higher than expression of other kinesins in some segments of coronary arteries and it is relatively low in organs playing unknown role in susceptibility to atherosclerosis. As a result of several genoms wide association studies the role of polymorphic marker Thr719Arg of kinesin 6 gene in development of ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, and in efficacy of therapy with statins was revealed.", 
    "195": "To evaluate whether statin use was associated with recurrent adenomatous polyps.", 
    "196": "We conducted a retrospective cohort study. We used electronic health records to evaluate veterans who underwent polypectomy between January 1, 1999 and December 31, 2001 and surveillance colonoscopy by December 2006. We obtained data on pathology, demographics, body mass index, comorbidity, habits, family history, and medications. We used multivariate proportional hazards regression models to analyze data.", 
    "197": "We evaluated 197 eligible patients from among 821 who underwent colonoscopy during this period; their mean (SD) age was 63.1 (8.8) years, 192 (98%) were men, and 80 (41%) non-Hispanic white. Surveillance colonoscopy was performed after a mean (SD) 1207 (452) days and 108 (55%) patients had recurrent adenomas. During follow-up, 88 (47%) of patients received statins, but use was not protective against recurrent adenomas (hazard ratio = 1.36, 95% CI 0.35-8.27). Only number of polyps at initial colonoscopy predicted recurrent adenomas (1.98, 95% CI 1.27-3.08).", 
    "198": "The use of statins was not protective against the recurrence of adenomatous polyps.", 
    "199": "Effective management of stable angina usually includes drug therapy. There are several agents that are considered vasculoprotective such as aspirin, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and statins. Conventional anti ischemic therapy includes nitrates, beta-blockers and calcium-channel blockers. In recent years, several other drugs with novel anti ischemic mechanisms have become available including ranolazine, ivabradine, nicorandil and many others. This article reviews drugs that alleviate the symptoms of chronic angina with emphasis on several novel pharmacological agents."
