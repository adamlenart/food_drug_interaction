During combination therapy, alterations in the pharmacokinetics of any of the drugs used and their metabolites may occur. Three separate open-label, randomized, crossover studies evaluated the potential for pharmacokinetic interaction between extended-release niacin (with and without concomitant laropiprant) and simvastatin in healthy subjects. Study 1 used single doses of extended-release niacin and simvastatin; study 2 used multiple-dose coadministration of extended-release niacin/laropiprant and simvastatin in healthy subjects; and study 3 used single doses of both extended-release niacin and the coadministration of extended-release niacin/laropiprant and simvastatin in healthy Chinese subjects. During each treatment period, plasma samples were collected predose and at prespecified postdose time points for pharmacokinetic analyses. The safety and tolerability of simvastatin with and without coadministered extended-release niacin (or extended-release niacin/laropiprant) were assessed by clinical evaluation of adverse experiences. In 2 studies in healthy subjects, modest increases in exposure to simvastatin acid (by \u223c60%) by extended-release niacin and extended-release niacin/laropiprant were observed. Based on the clinical experience with simvastatin, these effects are not believed to be clinically meaningful. In the third study on healthy Chinese subjects, no statistically meaningful increases in exposure to simvastatin by extended-release niacin and extended-release niacin/laropiprant were observed. In all populations examined in these studies, the coadministration of extended-release niacin and simvastatin was generally well tolerated.",

Numerous therapeutic strategies, mainly based on the use of statins, have been developed for hypercholesterolemia management. Unfortunately, those established drug therapies may present low effectiveness and low compliance by the patients. In this overview we discuss the results of a cohort observational prospectic clinical trial with active control which aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the experimental treatment with Omega Formula\u2122 compared to conventional treatment with atorvastatin. The study was conducted in Italy on 30 subjects aged over 18 years enrolled according to defined criteria, divided into two homogeneous groups and treated for 3 consecutive months with 10 mg/die of atorvastatin (control group) or 3 tablets/die of Omega Formula\u2122 (experimental group) and followed up with evaluation of biophysical and haematic parameters.

No differences between groups were observed for periprocedural microvascular circulation evaluated by Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction flow grade, myocardial blush grade, ST-segment resolution, microvascular obstruction on cardiac MRI, or clinical outcomes. In conclusion, early high-dose rosuvastatin therapy in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention did not improve periprocedural myocardial perfusion or reduce infarct volume measured by MRI compared with the conventional low-dose rosuvastatin regimen.",

Factors to consider when systematically reviewing medications are the goals of care, remaining life expectancy, treatment targets, time until benefit, number needed to treat, number needed to harm, and adverse drug reactions. Existing research focuses particularly on the use of certain drug classes during end-of-life care, including statins, antihypertensive agents, anticoagulants, antihyperglycaemic agents and antibiotics. Based on the results of this review, we made preliminary recommendations for these medication groups. Medication that does not benefit the patient in any way should be avoided.

Among 13,584 patients with IE, we applied propensity score-matching on a 1:4 ratio, in which 370 statin users were matched to 1,480 statin non-users. Compared with statin non-users, statin users had a significantly lower risk of in-hospital mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.65, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.49-0.86). The reduction in mortality from IE remained significant for follow-up 3\u00a0months (aHR 0.68, 95% CI, 0.53-0.88), 6\u00a0months (aHR 0.73, 95% CI, 0.58-0.91), and 12\u00a0months (aHR 0.68, 95% CI, 0.55-0.84). Statin therapy was associated with a reduced risk of ICU admission rates, shock events, the need for mechanical ventilation, but not significantly with the need for heart valvular replacement surgery.

Four categories of individuals that can benefit from statin therapy, including three high-risk groups, have been identified. The fourth category of primary prevention has proven to be the most contentious, with criticism centering on the algorithm used to estimate ten-year risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and the optimal threshold for statin therapy. Although the risk assessment algorithm can be further refined, it represents an improvement from the previous calculator since it better captures risk in women and African Americans. However, the elimination of lipid targets in the new guidelines discounts a wealth of clinical trial and epidemiological evidence indicating that, with regards to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, \"lower is better.\" Recommendations regarding the use of nonstatin drugs, while appropriate, could potentially be revised in the future.

Other areas of investigation include repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, cellular management, robotic therapy, and pharmacologic strategies to enhance recovery. OnabotulinumtoxinA (formerly botulinum toxin A) is effective for treating spasticity in the arm after stroke. Depression, experienced by at least one-third of patients after stroke, should be managed, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may offer an additional advantage of improved motor recovery. Proven interventions for secondary prevention after stroke include carotid revascularization, anticoagulation for patients with atrial fibrillation, aggressive medical management for those with significant intracranial atherosclerosis, statin treatment for patients with atherosclerotic stroke and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of 100 to 190 mg/dL, antiplatelet therapy for nonatrial fibrillation stroke, and blood pressure reduction.

Inpatient management should include dysphagia screening and prophylaxis for venous thromboembolism. Lower extremity compression stockings do not prevent venous thromboembolism in stroke patients, but intermittent pneumatic compression devices are of proven value. Patients who do not receive thrombolytic therapy should receive aspirin. A statin should be started if the patient's low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level is 100 mg/dL or higher. Delirium occurs commonly in patients with stroke and more commonly with increased age and stroke severity.

Approximately one-third of events that last less than 24 hours are associated with new infarctions on modern imaging sequences. These events, previously called apoplexy, are now called strokes. Approximately 10% of patients with TIA will have a stroke within 90 days without urgent evaluation and management; 50% of these events will occur within the first 48 hours. The ABCD(2) and ABCD(3)-I scores are validated measures that can help predict which patients are at greatest risk. With urgent evaluation and management, the rate of stroke after TIA can be reduced by up to 80%. Measures that reduce the rate of recurrence include rapid diagnosis and management of atrial fibrillation, identification and repair of carotid artery stenosis, early antithrombotic management, and use of statins for appropriate patients. Dual antiplatelet management with aspirin and clopidogrel may be useful in the first 30 days after TIA, but these drugs should not be used in combination after that time.

    "86": "Cerebral ischemia is a major neurological disorder and a leading cause of death and disability in the world. Statins are a widely used group of cholesterol-lowering agents that act by inhibiting the enzyme 3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG CoA) reductase, which catalyses the rate-limiting step of cholesterol biosynthesis. In addition to their cholesterol-lowering properties, however, statins exert a number of so-called 'pleiotropic' actions. Data has emerged largely from thromboembolic animal models of stroke and cultivated cells. It is suggested that statins which have efficacy in preventing the stroke pretreatedly may have a positive effect even given post ischemia possibly through their pleiotropic effects. Mechanisms of the protective actions on cerebral ischemia include the inhibition of inflammatory responses, the improvement of endothelial dysfunction, the regulation of apoptosis proteins, the reduction of oxidative damage and the control of other relative endogenous signal pathways. Attempting to review these properties of statins is an exciting work that will improve our understanding on stroke and thus enable us to better use clinically this type of drugs. The present review summarizes available evidences on the effects and the potential molecular mechanisms of statins on cerebral ischemia.",

Blood was collected to determine the level of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), triglycerides, glucose and insulin. Cognitive performance was measured by a neuropsychological battery covering domains of attention, language, verbal and visual memory, visuomotor speed and executive function. Z-scores were derived for each cognitive domain using the mean and standard deviations (SDs), and they were used to compare between (a) diabetic and non-diabetic groups, and (b) diabetic subjects with and without statin treatment. ANCOVAs with age, education, BMI, and the duration of diabetes as covariates were employed to examine differences in mean score of cognitive domains and subtests between the two groups.",

    "91": "It is well documented that statins protect atherosclerotic patients from inflammatory changes and plaque instability in coronary arteries. However, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. Using a previously established mouse model for vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque, we investigated the effect of atorvastatin (10 mg/kg/day) on plaque morphology. Atorvastatin did not lower plasma total cholesterol levels or affect plaque progression at this dosage; however, vulnerable plaque numbers were significantly reduced in the atorvastatin-treated group compared to control. Detailed examinations revealed that atorvastatin significantly decreased macrophage infiltration and subendothelial lipid deposition, reduced intimal collagen content, and elevated collagenase activity and expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Because vascular inflammation is largely driven by changes in monocyte/macrophage numbers in the vessel wall, we speculated that the anti-inflammatory effect of atorvastatin may partially result from decreased monocyte recruitment to the endothelium. Further experiments showed that atorvastatin downregulated expression of the chemokines monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, chemokine (C-X3-C motif) ligand 1 (CX3CL1) and their receptors CCR2 and, CX3CR1, which are mainly responsible for monocyte recruitment. In addition, levels of the plasma inflammatory markers C-reactive protein (CRP) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 were also significantly decrease in atorvastatin-treated mice. Collectively, our results demonstrate that atorvastatin can improve plaque stability in mice independent of plasma cholesterol levels. Given the profound inhibition of macrophage infiltration into atherosclerotic plaques, we propose that statins may partly exert protective effects by modulating levels of chemokines and their receptors. These findings elucidate yet another atheroprotective mechanism of statins.", 
    "92": "The mechanism of antihypertensive and lipid-lowering drugs on the human organism is still not fully understood. New insights on the drugs' action can be provided by a metabolomics-driven approach, which offers a detailed view of the physiological state of an organism. Here, we report a metabolome-wide association study with 295 metabolites in human serum from 1,762 participants of the KORA F4 (Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg) study population. Our intent was to find variations of metabolite concentrations related to the intake of various drug classes and--based on the associations found--to generate new hypotheses about on-target as well as off-target effects of these drugs. In total, we found 41 significant associations for the drug classes investigated: For beta-blockers (11 associations), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (four assoc.), diuretics (seven assoc.), statins (ten assoc.), and fibrates (nine assoc.) the top hits were pyroglutamine, phenylalanylphenylalanine, pseudouridine, 1-arachidonoylglycerophosphocholine, and 2-hydroxyisobutyrate, respectively. For beta-blockers we observed significant associations with metabolite concentrations that are indicative of drug side-effects, such as increased serotonin and decreased free fatty acid levels. Intake of ACE inhibitors and statins associated with metabolites that provide insight into the action of the drug itself on its target, such as an association of ACE inhibitors with des-Arg(9)-bradykinin and aspartylphenylalanine, a substrate and a product of the drug-inhibited ACE. The intake of statins which reduce blood cholesterol levels, resulted in changes in the concentration of metabolites of the biosynthesis as well as of the degradation of cholesterol. Fibrates showed the strongest association with 2-hydroxyisobutyrate which might be a breakdown product of fenofibrate and, thus, a possible marker for the degradation of this drug in the human organism. The analysis of diuretics showed a heterogeneous picture that is difficult to interpret. Taken together, our results provide a basis for a deeper functional understanding of the action and side-effects of antihypertensive and lipid-lowering drugs in the general population.",

This study aims to assess whether statins use is associated with reduced risk of 30-day mortality in Clostridium difficile infection (CDI). Using the computerized database of Clalit, the largest healthcare provider in Israel, we identified a cohort of adult subjects (age \u226540 years) who tested positive on a C. difficile toxin assay performed between January 2011 and December 2012. Subjects were defined as current statins users if they filled at least one prescription during the 90 days before the laboratory assay date. Current users were classified into long-term users if at least one additional prescription was filled during the previous 91-180 days; otherwise they were defined as short-term users. A total 1888 patients with CDI were included. Of them, 340 (18.0%) died during the first 30 days after diagnosis. The 30-day mortality rate was lower among current statins users 89/669 (13.3%) compared with 251/1219 (20.6%) in non-users (p <0.001). A significant reduced risk of 30-day mortality existed after adjustment for potential confounders; adjusted OR = 0.57 (95% CI 0.42-0.79) and was unique to long-term users; 0.53 (0.38-0.73) but not short-term users; 1.15 (0.56-2.34). The risk of 30-day mortality decreased with increasing number of filled statins prescriptions; adjusted OR = 0.77 (95% CI 0.67-0.89) for each additional prescription. Current aspirin use was also independently associated with reduced mortality; adjusted OR = 0.64 (95% CI 0.43-0.88).

To examine autophagy activation, we evaluated the co-localization of LC3 and LysoTracker by immunocytochemistry, as well as the expression of LC3 and p62/sequestosome-1 (SQSTM1) by western blot. In addition, we assessed the survival and proliferation of T24 and J82 cells by a clonogenic assay. We found that atorvastatin reduced the cell viability of T24 and J82 cells via apoptotic cell death and induced autophagy activation, shown by the co-localization of LC3 and LysoTracker. Moreover, pharmacologic inhibition of autophagy significantly enhanced atorvastatin-induced apoptosis in T24 and J82 cells. In sum, inhibition of autophagy potentiates atorvastatin-induced apoptotic cell death in human bladder cancer cells in vitro, providing a potential therapeutic approach to treat bladder cancer.",

Statin use is associated with a small increase in BMI and moderate (20-33%) increases in the probability of being obese. Statin use was also associated with a significant (e.g., 15% of mean) increase in moderate alcohol use among men. There was no consistent evidence of a decrease in smoking associated with statin use, and exercise worsened somewhat for females. Statin use was associated with increased physical activity among males. Finally, there was evidence that statin use increased the use of blood pressure medication and aspirin for both males and females, although estimates varied considerably in magnitude. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that healthy diet is a strong substitute for statins, but there is only uneven evidence for the hypothesis that investments in disease prevention are complementary.", 
    "105": "Pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and their metabolites are continually released from wastewater treatment plants into the aquatic environment; however, their impact on aquatic biota is poorly understood. This study examined the toxicity and bioconcentration of three pharmaceuticals: moxifloxacin, rosuvastatin, and drospirenone to the unionid mussel Lampsilis siliquoidea. Effects of moxifloxacin and rosuvastatin were assessed through aqueous 21-d static-renewal tests using 2-year-old mussels, at 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 and 100mg/L (nominal concentrations). Following exposure, survival, behavior, algal clearance rate, hemocyte viability and density, and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activity were assessed. In addition, the acute (48 h) toxicity of moxifloxacin (0-100mg/L) and drospirenone (0-3mg/L) to glochidia (larval mussels) were examined. In 21 day exposures (2-yr old mussels), there were no differences in survival, oxygen consumption, hemocyte density, or GST activity over the range of concentrations examined; however, the proportion of time mussels spent filtering, and consequently the algal clearance rate, decreased at the higher moxifloxacin and rosuvastatin concentrations. Bioconcentration factors (BCFs) ranged between 0.03 and 70 for moxifloxacin, and between 0 and 0.05 for rosuvastatin for exposures up to 100mg/L. The BCF for moxifloxacin at the highest exposure concentration was lower than that at the mid-level concentrations, likely due to decreased filtering activity at the higher exposure levels. The feeding rates declined and the amount of time the subadult mussels spent with their valves closed increased at the higher moxifloxacin and rosuvastatin exposures. Glochidia viability did not vary with exposure to drospirenone, but declined at the highest moxifloxacin concentration, resulting in an EC50 of 120 mg/L. Overall, observed sublethal and lethal effects occurred at concentrations which exceed expected environmental concentrations through aqueous exposure, suggesting a low risk to freshwater mussels from these particular PPCPs.",

Current recommendations for the prevention of cardiovascular disease issued jointly from the American Academy of Cardiology and American Heart Association emphasize that lifestyle modification should be incorporated into any treatment plan, including those on statin drugs. However, there is a dearth of data on the interaction between diet and statins with respect to additive, complementary or antagonistic effects. This review collates the available data on the interaction of statins and dietary patterns, cognition, genetics and individual nutrients, including vitamin D, niacin, omega-3 fatty acids, fiber, phytochemicals (polyphenols and stanols) and alcohol. Of note, although the available data is summarized, the scope is limited, conflicting and disparate. In some cases it is likely there is unrecognized synergism. Virtually no data are available describing the interactions of statins with dietary components or dietary pattern in subgroups of the population, particularly those who may benefit most were positive effects identified. Hence, it is virtually impossible to draw any firm conclusions at this time. Nevertheless, this area is important because were the effects of statins and diet additive or synergistic harnessing the effect could potentially lead to the use of a lower intensity statin or dose.",

Statins exhibit a class-wide side effect of muscle toxicity and weakness, which has led regulators to impose both dosage limitations and a recall. This review focuses on the best-characterized genetic factors associated with increased statin muscle concentrations, including the genes encoding cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP2D6, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5), a mitochondrial enzyme (GATM), an influx transporter (SLCO1B1), and efflux transporters (ABCB1 and ABCG2). A systematic literature review was conducted to identify relevant research evaluating the significance of genetic variants predictive of altered statin concentrations and subsequent statin-related myopathy. Studies eligible for inclusion must have incorporated genotype information and must have associated it with some measure of myopathy, either creatine kinase levels or self-reported muscle aches and pains. After an initial review, focus was placed on seven genes that were adequately characterized to provide a substantive review: CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP3A5, GATM, SLCO1B1, ABCB1, and ABCG2. All statins were included in this review. Among the genetic factors evaluated, statin-related myopathy appears to be most strongly associated with variants in SLCO1B1.",

Atorvastatin decreased the plasma concentration of non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDLC) dose-dependently; atorvastatin 0.003% decreased the plasma concentration of non-HDLC by 25% and the area of atherosclerotic lesions by 21%. Probucol decreased the plasma concentration of non-HDLC to the same extent as atorvastatin (i.e., by 22%) and the area of atherosclerotic lesions by 41%. Probucol with 0.003% atorvastatin decreased the plasma concentration of non-HDLC by 38% and the area of atherosclerotic lesions by 61%. Co-administration of probucol with atorvastatin did not affect the antioxidative effects of probucol, which were not evident on treatment with atorvastatin alone, such as prevention of in vitro LDL-oxidation, increase in paraoxonase-1 activity of HDL, and decreases in plasma and plaque levels of oxidized-LDL in vivo.",

Overall, delirium developed in 588 patients (77%). After adjusting for covariates, ICU statin use was associated with reduced delirium (p < 0.01).

In the present study, we examined the beneficial effects of the single pill-based combination therapy of amlodipine and atorvastatin on achievement of the target BP and clinic BP profile, as well as markers of vascular and renal damages in twenty hypertensive CKD patients. The combination therapy with amlodipine and atorvastatin for 16 weeks significantly decreased clinic BP, and achievement of target BP control was attained in an average of 45% after the combination therapy in spite of the presence of no achievement at baseline. In addition, the combination therapy significantly decreased the within-visit BP variability. With respect to the effects on renal damage markers, combination therapy with amlodipine and atorvastatin for 16 weeks significantly decreased albuminuria (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio, 1034 \u00b1 1480 versus 733 \u00b1 1218 mg/g-Cr, P < 0.05) without decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate.

We tested these emerging effects in a major thermal injury mouse model (3rd degree scald, ~20% TBSA) with previously documented, inflammation-mediated intestinal defects. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) inflammation measurement methods were used alongside classic gut mucosa inflammation and leakiness measurements with exogenous melatonin treatment as a positive control. Our hypothesis is that simvastatin has protective therapeutic effects against early postburn gut mucosa inflammation and leakiness. To test this hypothesis, we compared untreated thermal injury (TI) adult male mice with TI littermates treated with simvastatin (0.2\u00a0mg/kg i.p., TI\u00a0+\u00a0SMV) immediately following burn injury and two\u00a0hours before being sacrificed the day after; melatonin-treated (Mel) (1.86\u00a0mg/kg i.p., TI +\u00a0Mel) mice were compared as a positive control. Mice were assessed for the following: (1) tissue oxidation and neutrophil infiltration in terminal ileum mucosa using classic carbonyl, Gr-1, and myeloperoxidase immunohistochemical or biochemical assays, (2) NETosis in terminal ileum and colon mucosa homogenates and peritoneal and fluid blood samples utilizing flow cytometric analyses of the surrogate NETosis biomarkers, picogreen and Gr-1, and (3) transepithelial gut leakiness as measured in terminal ileum and colon with FITC-dextran and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER). Our results reveal that simvastatin and melatonin exhibit consistently comparable therapeutic protective effects against the following: (1) gut mucosa oxidative stress as revealed in the terminal ileum by markers of protein carbonylation as well as myeloperoxidase (MPO) and Gr-1 infiltration, (2) NETosis as revealed in the gut milieu, peritoneal lavage and plasma utilizing picogreen and Gr-1 flow cytometry and microscopy, and (3) transepithelial gut leakiness as assessed in the ileum and colon by FITC-dextran leakiness and TEER.

    "155": "Statins have favorable effects on endothelial function partly because of their capacity to reduce oxidative stress. However, antioxidant vitamins, unlike statins, are not as cardioprotective, and this paradox has been explained by failure of vitamin antioxidants to ameliorate endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. To determine whether statins prevent dextrose-induced ER stress in addition to their antioxidative effects, human umbilical vein endothelial cells and HepG2 hepatocytes were treated with 27.5 mM dextrose in the presence of simvastatin (lipophilic statin that is a prodrug) and pravastatin (water-soluble active drug), and oxidative stress, ER stress, and cell death were measured. Superoxide generation was measured using 2-methyl-6-(4-methoxyphenyl)-3,7-dihydroimidazo[1,2-A]pyrazin-3-one hydrochloride. ER stress was measured using the placental alkaline phosphatase assay and Western blot of glucose-regulated protein 75, c-jun-N-terminal kinase, phospho-JNK, eukaryotic initiating factor 2\u03b1 and phospho-eIF2\u03b1, and X-box binding protein 1 mRNA splicing. Cell viability was measured by propidium iodide staining. Superoxide anion production, ER stress, and cell death induced by 27.5 mM dextrose were inhibited by therapeutic concentrations of simvastatin and pravastatin. The salutary effects of statins on endothelial cells in reducing both ER stress and oxidative stress observed with pravastatin and the prodrug simvastatin suggest that the effects may be independent of cholesterol-lowering activity.",

To compare lipid-lowering efficacy of rosuvastatin with atorvastatin. Methodology. This open-label randomized controlled trial was carried out at 1 Mountain Medical Battalion from September 2012 to August 2013 on patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension, myocardial infarction, or stroke, meriting treatment with a statin. Those with secondary causes of dyslipidemia were excluded. Blood samples for estimation of serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-C, and LDL-C were collected after a 12-hour fast. Patients were randomly allocated to receive either atorvastatin 10\u2009mg HS or rosuvastatin 5\u2009mg HS daily. Lipid levels were rechecked after six weeks. Results. Atorvastatin was used in 63 patients and rosuvastatin in 66. There was a greater absolute and percent reduction in serum LDL-C levels with rosuvastatin as compared to atorvastatin (0.96 versus 0.54\u2009mg/dL; P = 0.011 and 24.34 versus 13.66%; P = 0.045), whereas reduction in all other fractions was equal. Myalgias were seen in 5 (7.94%) patients treated with atorvastatin and 8 (12.12%) patients treated with rosuvastatin (P: 0.432). Conclusion. Rosuvastatin produces a greater reduction in serum LDL-C levels and should therefore be preferred over atorvastatin.",

    "162": "Differences in the expression and function of the organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) transporters contribute to interindividual variability in atorvastatin clearance. However, the importance of the bile acid transporter sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP, SLC10A1) in atorvastatin uptake clearance (CLupt) is not yet clarified. To elucidate this issue, we investigated the relative contribution of NTCP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OATP2B1 to atorvastatin CLupt in 12 human liver samples. The impact of inhibition on atorvastatin CLupt was also studied, using inhibitors of different isoform specificities. Expression levels of the four transport proteins were quantified by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. These data, together with atorvastatin in vitro kinetics, were used to predict the maximal transport activity (MTA) and interindividual differences in CLupt of each transporter in vivo. Subsequently, hepatic uptake impairment on coadministration of five clinically interacting drugs was predicted using in vitro inhibitory potencies. NTCP and OATP protein expression varied 3.7- to 32-fold among the 12 sample donors. The rank order in expression was OATP1B1 > OATP1B3 \u2248 NTCP \u2248 OATP2B1. NTCP was found to be of minor importance in atorvastatin disposition. Instead, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 were confirmed as the major atorvastatin uptake transporters. The average contribution to atorvastatin uptake was OATP1B1 > OATP1B3 > OATP2B1 > NTCP, although this rank order varied among individuals. The interindividual differences in transporter expression and CLupt resulted in marked differences in drug-drug interactions due to isoform-specific inhibition. We conclude that this variation should be considered in in vitro to in vivo extrapolations.", 
    "163": "High-confidence prediction of complex traits such as disease risk or drug response is an ultimate goal of personalized medicine. Although genome-wide association studies have discovered thousands of well-replicated polymorphisms associated with a broad spectrum of complex traits, the combined predictive power of these associations for any given trait is generally too low to be of clinical relevance. We propose a novel systems approach to complex trait prediction, which leverages and integrates similarity in genetic, transcriptomic, or other omics-level data. We translate the omic similarity into phenotypic similarity using a method called Kriging, commonly used in geostatistics and machine learning. Our method called OmicKriging emphasizes the use of a wide variety of systems-level data, such as those increasingly made available by comprehensive surveys of the genome, transcriptome, and epigenome, for complex trait prediction. Furthermore, our OmicKriging framework allows easy integration of prior information on the function of subsets of omics-level data from heterogeneous sources without the sometimes heavy computational burden of Bayesian approaches. Using seven disease datasets from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC), we show that OmicKriging allows simple integration of sparse and highly polygenic components yielding comparable performance at a fraction of the computing time of a recently published Bayesian sparse linear mixed model method. Using a cellular growth phenotype, we show that integrating mRNA and microRNA expression data substantially increases performance over either dataset alone. Using clinical statin response, we show improved prediction over existing methods. We provide an R package to implement OmicKriging (http://www.scandb.org/newinterface/tools/OmicKriging.html).",

    "168": "Statins exert atheroprotective effects through the induction of specific transcriptional factors in multiple organs. In endothelial cells, statin-dependent atheroprotective gene up-regulation is mediated by Kruppel-like factor (KLF) family transcription factors. To dissect the mechanism of gene regulation, we sought to determine molecular targets by performing microarray analyses of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) treated with pitavastatin, and KLF4 was determined to be the most highly induced gene. In addition, it was revealed that the atheroprotective genes induced with pitavastatin, such as nitric oxide synthase 3 (NOS3) and thrombomodulin (THBD), were suppressed by KLF4 knockdown. Myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) family activation is reported to be involved in pitavastatin-dependent KLF4 induction. We focused on MEF2C among the MEF2 family members and identified a novel functional MEF2C binding site 148 kb upstream of the KLF4 gene by chromatin immunoprecipitation along with deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) followed by luciferase assay. By applying whole genome and quantitative chromatin conformation analysis {chromatin interaction analysis with paired end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET), and real time chromosome conformation capture (3C) assay}, we observed that the MEF2C-bound enhancer and transcription start site (TSS) of KLF4 came into closer spatial proximity by pitavastatin treatment. 3D-Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) imaging supported the conformational change in individual cells. Taken together, dynamic chromatin conformation change was shown to mediate pitavastatin-responsive gene induction in endothelial cells.",

This monograph includes the description of the drug: nomenclature, formulae, elemental composition, solubility, appearance, and partition coefficient. The uses and the methods that have been reported for the synthesis of this drug are described. The physical methods that were used to characterize the drug are the X-ray powder diffraction pattern, thermal methods, melting point, and differential scanning calorimetry. This chapter also contains the following spectra of the drug: the ultraviolet spectrum, the vibrational spectrum, the nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, and the mass spectrum. The compendial methods of analysis include the British Pharmacopoeia and the United States Pharmacopoeia methods. Other methods of analysis that are included in this profile are spectrophotometric, electrochemical, polarographic, voltammetric and chromatographic, and immunoassay methods. The chapter also contains the pharmacokinetics, metabolism, stability, and articles that reviewed pravastatin sodium manufacturing, characterization, and analysis. One hundred and sixty-two references are listed at the end of this comprehensive profile.", 
    "192": "Sepsis is a complex disease with typically poor outcomes. While the onset of sepsis is typically infectious, the detrimental consequences follow pathogen toxin release that produces activation of numerous cytokines and a pro-inflammatory response. These same cytokines also stimulate activation of coagulation and inhibit natural fibrinolysis. Despite decades of research targeted against these pathways the development of sepsis and mortality in patients with sepsis remains high. While statins were developed for reducing cholesterol in patients with atherosclerotic disease, we now know they have a number of other properties which may be helpful in the prevention and treatment of sepsis. Statins have demonstrated the ability to reduce a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines known to be detrimental in the development and progression of sepsis. Statins have also demonstrated the ability to limit the coagulation response and promote fibrinolysis in the setting of sepsis. Based on these encouraging pharmacologic properties of statins a number of trials have been conducted evaluating the impact of statins on the prevention and treatment of sepsis. Most of the trials to date have been retrospective cohort trials, with very few prospective randomized trials. While some trials fail to demonstrate a benefit of statins, most trials suggest a reduction in the development of sepsis and/or other important sepsis related outcomes. While the laboratory and early clinical experience with statins are encouraging, randomized controlled trials will be need to fully define the role of statins in the prevention and treatment of sepsis."
