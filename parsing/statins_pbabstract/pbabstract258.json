Xuezhikang is an extract of cholestin and has a markedly modulating effect on lipids, but the effect of xuezhikang on reducing coronary events in diabetic patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) is less clear. A total of 591 diabetic patients with CHD were randomized to the xuezhikang group (n=306) and the placebo group (n=285). During the average 4 years of follow-up, there were 28 cases of CHD events (9.2%) in the xuezhikang group and 53 cases (18.6%) in the placebo group. Risk reduction for CHD events was 50.8% (P<0.001) by xuezhikang treatment. Xuezhikang decreased the risk of non-fatal MI by 63.8%, fatal MI by 58.5%, CHD sudden death by 26.9%, and other CHD death by 53.4%. CHD death totaled to 21 cases in the xuezhikang group (6.9%) and 35 cases in the placebo group (12.3%), indicating that xuezhikang significantly decreased the risk of CHD death by 44.1% (P<0.05). Seventy-two patients died from various causes, among which there were 27 patients in the xuezhikang group and 45 patients in the placebo group. The risk for all-cause death was 44.1% lower in the xuezhikang group than in the placebo group (P<0.01).

In WHO, HHS and VA-HIT trials fibrates were shown to decrease development of complications of cardiovascular diseases. Efficacy of fenofibrate in subjects with moderate risk and type 2 diabetes combined with mild dyslipidemia was studied in the placebo controlled FIELD study. Administration of fenofibrate was associated with insignificant 11% decrease of cardiovascular events (19% decrease after adjustment for statin use) and significant 24% decrease of nonfatal myocardial infarctions. Among effects on secondary end points were significant decreases of coronary revascularizations (-21%), strokes (-11%) and requrements in laser therapy for diabetic retinopathy (-30%). Fenofibrate also caused significant slowing of progression of albuminuria and nephropathy. Fenofibrate can be used in subjects with high coronary risk and metabolic syndrome combined with atherogenic dyslipidemia (total cholesterol/high density lipoprotein cholesterol >4 mmol/l), as well as in patients with moderate and pronounced hypertriglyceridemia or normal or elevated high density lipoprotein cholesterol. One of important indications for administration of fenofibrate is type 2 diabetes without ischemic heart disease but with microvascular complications.

    "20": "Effect of statins on N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) in patients with heart failure has not been well elucidated. Purpose. To assess changes of NT-proBNP during short term use of simvastatin in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and chronic systolic heart failure. Patients and methods. Statin naive patients (n=70) with coronary heart disease (CHD), NYHA class II-IV hart failure and LV ejection fraction (EF) 35% or less after correction of treatment and 1 month of stabilization on standard therapy were randomized to open simvastatin 40 mg/day (n=36) or no statin (n=34). In 65.1% of pts (65.6 and 64.5% in statin and control groups, respectively) beta-blockers were either initiated or their dose was corrected during <stabilization> phase of the study. Blood plasma lipids, NT-proBNP were measured and echocardiography carried out at randomization and in 4 months. Seven patients were not restudied and analysis included data from 32 (statin) and 31 (control) patients. Results. Baseline characteristics of groups were similar. Addition of statin to standard therapy was associated with lowering of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (-42%) and triglycerides (-14%). Changes of other parameters were similar in both groups including equal increases of NT-proBNP (from 540.9 to 1082.2 fmol/ml, p<0.0001, and from 639.6 to 1119.72 fmol/ml, p<0.0001, in control and simvastatin group, respectively). Baseline NT-proBNP correlated negatively with ejection fraction and positively with left ventricular dimensions, heart failure class and blood serum creatinine. The patients were followed for 1 year. Baseline NT-proBNP level was related to hospitalizations because of heart failure exacerbation during this year. Conclusion. In a group of patients with systolic heart failure due to CHD and trivial relationships between baseline NT-proBNP level and characteristics of heart failure severity short term simvastatin use caused expected LDLCH lowering but was associated with NT-proBNP increase equal to that observed in control group. Rise of NT-proBNP in both groups was probably related to activation of beta-blocker therapy.",

A total of 291 and 272 patients were given a statin or placebo, respectively, in parallel group trials, whereas 265 took part in crossover trials receiving a statin and placebo (or probucol, in 1 trial). Systolic blood pressure was significantly lower in patients on statin than in those on placebo or control hypolipidemic drug (mean difference: -1.9 mm Hg; 95% CI: -3.8 to -0.1). The effect was greater when the analysis was restricted to studies with a baseline systolic blood pressure >130 mm Hg (Delta systolic blood pressure: -4.0; 95% CI: -5.8 to -2.2 mm Hg). There was a trend for lower diastolic blood pressure in patients receiving statin therapy compared with control: -0.9 mm Hg (95% CI: -2.0 to 0.2) overall and -1.2 mm Hg (95% CI: -2.6 to 0.1) in studies with a baseline diastolic blood pressure >80 mm Hg. In general, the higher the baseline blood pressure, the greater the effect of statins on blood pressure (P=0.066 for systolic blood pressure and P=0.023 for diastolic blood pressure). The blood pressure response to statins was unrelated to age, changes in serum cholesterol, or length of the trial. In conclusion, statin therapy has a relatively small but statistically significant and clinically meaningful effect on blood pressure.",

Current guidelines suggest lifestyle modification and at least a 30%-40% reduction of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol with drug therapy, to a target level of <100 mg/dL. Additional secondary therapeutic targets include increasing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and lowering triglycerides. Although the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) remain first-line therapy, combination therapy with statins and fibrates or niacin is often needed to achieve target levels in patients with diabetes. Statins significantly lower LDL and decrease the relative risk for nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) or coronary artery disease death. Clinical trials have demonstrated that in high-risk patients, such as those with diabetes, monotherapy with statins reduces overall cardiovascular events by 30%-40%. Fibrates have modest effects to lower LDL, but they significantly increase HDL and reduce triglycerides, they may improve glucose tolerance, and they have been shown to reduce nonfatal MI by 25%. Although data are limited, the combination of a statin and fenofibrate significantly reduced LDL, reduced triglycerides, and increased HDL compared with a statin alone. It is hoped that ongoing trials will demonstrate the clinical outcomes benefits of combination therapy in patients with diabetes.",

Clinical trials of PPAR-alpha agonists have demonstrated efficacy in reducing cardiovascular events; however, these benefits have been confined to subgroups of patients with low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or high levels of triglycerides. While activators of PPAR-gamma reduce early atherosclerotic lesions and reduce cardiovascular events, these agents have the effect of increasing fluid retention in patients, which results in more hospitalizations for congestive heart failure. Future studies of PPAR-gamma agonists or dual PPAR-alpha/gamma agonists will require further delineation of the risk profile to avoid adverse outcomes in susceptible patients.", 
    "30": "Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and/or the metabolic syndrome have considerable cardiovascular risk. Treatment with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) and with antihypertensive and some antihyperglycemic agents reduces this risk, but residual macrovascular morbidity and mortality persist, even in patients assigned to intensive multifactorial intervention programs. Therapeutic strategies that target inflammation and lipid abnormalities not well addressed by statins may offer additional opportunities for improving the prognosis of these patients. Inflammation, a key mechanism of atherogenesis, appears to have particular relevance to diabetic vascular complications, as well as in the development of diabetes itself. Oxidative stress and hyperglycemia also figure among the pathogenic factors that promote cardiovascular complications in patients with the metabolic syndrome and/or diabetes and may augment the ongoing inflammation. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha and PPAR-gamma, members of the nuclear receptor family, form ligand-activated transcription factors that regulate key important metabolic pathways. PPARs have become therapeutic targets through the use of the fibrate class of antidyslipidemic drugs (PPAR-alpha) and the insulin-sensitizing thiazolidinediones (PPAR-gamma). The activation of these PPARs may also suppress inflammation and atherosclerosis. Recent clinical trials (Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes [FIELD], Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial in Macrovascular Events [PROactive]) have considered the impact of these PPAR agonists on cardiovascular disease, with mixed effects that require careful analysis, especially given ongoing trials and additional PPAR agonists in development.",

Statin-treated patients showed higher levels of vitamin E (p=0.02) and lower 8-OHdG (p<0.01) than statin-free patients. An inverse correlation between oxidative stress and vitamin E was observed (r=-0.670, p<0.001).

The case of simvastatin reveals that savings to the health system from parallel trade are trivial. Finally, of the three countries examined, the only country that shows a moderate downward pattern in simvastatin prices is the Netherlands.

The risk conferred by Lp(a) appeared to be independent of other confounders, including exposure to statin/fibrate therapies. Similar odds ratios and CIs between disease groups indicated that increased Lp(a) conferred a similar risk for all groups studied.",

Log-binomial models were used to test statins prescription associations with clinical and socio-demographic characteristics.", 
    "58": "Statins were prescribed to 31.0% of 7446 patients. Among persons >74 years of age, the prescription rate was 40% lower than that found for younger persons. A positive association was also found for: female gender, being married, a main discharge diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, revascularization, diabetes and discharge from a cardiology ward. Age was an important effect modifier of the relationship between the prescribing rate and social, but not clinical, determinants.", 
    "59": "The prevention of IHD with statins is influenced by age, clinical and social factors. The prescribing rate is higher among population groups for whom statins are of proven efficacy. Among patients for whom the efficacy is uncertain, the decision to prescribe is influenced by non-clinical factors, suggesting that there exist both age-based and social-based mechanisms of rationing. Age and social determinants act in concert to further reduce the propensity of physicians to prescribe statins.",

This meta-analysis assesses the effectiveness and safety of RYR preparations on lipid modification in primary hyperlipidemia. We included randomized controlled trials testing RYR preparation, compared with placebo, no treatment, statins, or other active lipid-lowering agents in people with hyperlipidemia through searching PubMed, CBMdisk, TCMLARS, the Cochrane Library, and AMED up to December 2004. Ninety-three randomized trials (9625 participants) were included and three RYR preparations (Cholestin, Xuezhikang and Zhibituo) were tested. The methodological quality of trial reports was generally low in terms of generation of the allocation sequence, allocation concealment, blinding, and intention-to-treat. The combined results showed significant reduction of serum total cholesterol levels (weighted mean difference -0.91 mmol/L, 95% confidence interval -1.12 to -0.71), triglycerides levels (-0.41 mmol/L, -0.6 to -0.22), and LDL-cholesterol levels (-0.73 mmol/L, -1.02 to -0.043), and increase of HDL-cholesterol levels (0.15 mmol/L, 0.09 to 0.22) by RYR treatment compared with placebo. The lipid modification effects appeared to be similar to pravastatin, simvastatin, lovastatin, atorvastatin, or fluvastatin. Compared with non-statin lipid lowering agents, RYR preparations appeared superior to nicotinate and fish oils, but equal to or less effective than fenofibrate and gemfibrozil. No significant difference in lipid profile was found between Xuezhikang and Zhibituo. RYR preparations were associated with non-serious adverse effects such as dizziness and gastrointestinal discomfort. Current evidence shows short-term beneficial effects of RYR preparations on lipid modification. More rigorous trials are needed, and long-term effects and safety should be investigated if RYR preparations are to be recommended as one of the alternative treatments for primary hyperlipidemia.",

In the present work, four species (Rhizopus stolonifer, Mortierella wolfii, Syncephalastrum racemosum and Mycotypha africana) that exhibited different sensitivities to lovastatin and PAF in previous experiments were investigated. The efficiencies with which four statins (lovastatin, simvastatin, rosuvastatin and atorvastatin) inhibited sporangiospore germination in the absence or in the presence of a constant concentration of PAF were studied.

This was a prospective, crossover, randomized, open-label study performed in 12 healthy volunteers comparing the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of simvastatin (40 mg) or pravastatin (40 mg) taken alone and after 3 days of amiodarone (400 mg/day). Amiodarone increased simvastatin acid AUC (area under the plasma concentration-time curve)0-24 h, peak plasma concentration (Cmax), and t1/2 by 73% (P=0.02), 100% (P=0.02), and 48% (P=0.06), respectively, whereas it did not significantly alter pravastatin pharmacokinetics. Point estimates and 90% confidence intervals for simvastatin acid, simvastatin lactone, and pravastatin AUC0-24 h were 154% (109-216%), 155% (109-227%), and 86% (63-118%), respectively. If amiodarone and a statin have to be simultaneously prescribed, pravastatin should be preferred to simvastatin in order to avoid a drug interaction.",

Although there are plausible biologic mechanisms to suggest that statins could inhibit cellular proliferation, the epidemiologic data do not show a consistent reduction in cancer risk among statin users. Despite the current lack of evidence for a chemopreventive effect, there are several methodologic considerations in the studies reported to date that prevent a definitive conclusion that statins do not reduce cancer risk.

The patients were randomized into atorvastatin plus aspirin combined therapy group and aspirin monotherapy group. Reduced total cholesterol in the combined therapy group was found in a short term of medication for 14 days. On postoperative day (POD)-14, inhibitory effects of the combined therapy on whole blood aggregation as well as platelet activation assessed by flow cytometry were stronger than those of the monotherapy. Furthermore, cytokine, cytokine receptors, c-reactive protein and alpha1-acid glycoprotein in the combined therapy group were down-regulated on POD-14. At the same time, circulating levels of thromboxane A(2), vascular endothelial growth factor and thrombin-antithrombin III complex as well as P-selectin, L-selectin and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 were down-regulated, while E-selectin and transforming growth factor-beta1 was up-regulated. Atorvastatin plus aspirin combined therapy may improve inflammatory responses, accelerated platelet function, vascular endothelial cell function, blood coagulation system at the early stage such as 14th day after CABG.

Cob(I)alamin adenosyltransferase (MMAB) converts cob(I)alamin to adenosylcobalamin, functionally required for mitochondrial methylmalonyl-CoA mutase activity and succinyl-CoA formation. These two synthenic genes are found in a head-to-head formation on chromosome 12 in man and chromosome 5 in mouse. The 330bp intergenic region showed several conserved NF-Y sites indicative of potential bidirectional regulatory SREBP synergism. Both MVK and MMAB appear to be regulated in a similar manner, to a large extent by SREBP-2, since their tissue expression pattern was similar and both genes were suppressed by an excess of cholesterol as well as SREBP-2 knockdown. Statin treatment in mice upregulated both Mvk and Mmab mRNA levels indicating that this treatment may be useful in inborn errors of cblB complementation associated with methylmalonic aciduria as well as hyper IgD and periodic fever syndrome (HIDS).",

The treatment of hyperlipidemia in patients with renal disease has two purposes: to prevent the development of cardiovascular disease and to prevent the progression of renal disease. However, statins, which are widely used to treat hyperlipidemia, should be used very carefully in patients with renal disease, especially in those whose serum creatinine level is more than 3 mg/dL. Atorvastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, is completely metabolized in the liver. Thus, we thought that atorvastatin could be used safely in hyperlipidemic patients with chronic renal disease.",

Cholesterol-lowering therapy using statins significantly reduces the risk of coronary heart disease. Furthermore, wider use of statins leads to increases of other beneficial effects, so-called pleiotropic effects. These include reductions in cytotoxicity and inflammation reaction, oncoprotective effects - apoptosis of some types of cancer cells, improvement of endothel function, inhibition of thromb formation, decrease of the risk of dementia independent of improvement in the lipid spectrum, inibition of smooth muscle cells proliferation and inhibition of thrombocyte aggregation. One of the important effects is its influence on bone metabolism. Statins augment the expression of bone morphogenetic protein-2, a potent stimulator of osteoblast differentiation and its activity, and promote mineralization by cultured osteoblasts, indicating that statins have an anabolic effect on bone.

    "97": "Macrolides may cause severe drug interactions due to the inhibition of metabolizing enzymes. Transporter-mediated uptake of drugs into cells [e.g., by members of the human organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) family] is a determinant of drug disposition and a prerequisite for subsequent metabolism. However whether macrolides are also inhibitors of uptake transporters, thereby providing an additional mechanism of drug interactions, has not been systematically studied. The human OATP family members OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 mediate the uptake of endogenous substances and drugs such as antibiotics and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) into hepatocytes. In this study we investigated the potential role of these uptake transporters on macrolide-induced drug interactions. By using sulfobromophthalein (BSP) and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor pravastatin as substrates, the effects of the macrolides azithromycin, clarithromycin, erythromycin, and roxithromycin and of the ketolide telithromycin on the OATP1B1- and OATP1B3-mediated uptake were analyzed. These experiments demonstrated that the OATP1B1- and OATP1B3-mediated uptake of BSP and pravastatin can be inhibited by increasing concentrations of all macrolides except azithromycin. The IC50 values for the inhibition of OATP1B3-mediated BSP uptake were 11 microM for telithromycin, 32 microM for clarithromycin, 34 microM for erythromycin, and 37 microM for roxithromycin. These IC50 values were lower than the IC50 values for inhibition of OATP1B1-mediated BSP uptake (96-217 microM). These macrolides also inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner the OATP1B1- and OATP1B3-mediated uptake of pravastatin. In summary, these results indicate that alterations of uptake transporter function by certain macrolides/ketolides have to be considered as a potential additional mechanism underlying drug-drug interactions.",

Risk factor modifications should include smoking cessation as well as blood pressure and cholesterol management. Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) is the antiplatelet of choice, and clopidogrel should be used as an alternative if ASA therapy is contraindicated or an intolerance is present. Cilostazol has a minimal role for the symptomatic relief in patients with disabling intermittent claudication. All patients with PAD should be treated with a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor and potentially an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor.

A total of 50,741 patients, identified from 88 practices, were diagnosed with hyperlipidemia and had begun therapy with any statin medication during the 1998-2004 time period. In addition, total dollars spent each month on television advertising at the national and local levels for atorvastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin were obtained. DTC advertising data were merged by local media market where the physician practice was located and by the month in which the patient was first prescribed a statin. The models were run for all patients who initiated therapy, and also on a subsample of patients who continued to receive prescriptions for the drugs for at least 6 months. Logistic regressions were used to predict the likelihood that each patient attained the ATP III LDL-C blood-level goals as a function of DTC advertising and other factors.",

While this paper does not address the impact of DTC advertising on the costs of care or on unnecessary switching between statin treatments, the results do suggest that DTC advertising can have beneficial effects, which should be a factor when additional restrictions on DTC advertising are considered. This result-that DTC ad vertising might have beneficial effects-should be weighed against existing studies that have found that patients' suggestions (conceptually which could be induced by DTC advertising) may be associated with overprescribing (eg, in the case of the use of antidepressants for adjustment disorder).",

We aimed to test their efficacy as solo agents to inhibit anti-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies. We tested samples from 11 adult hemodialysis patients who were waiting for renal allotransplantation at our center, all of whom had persistently positive crossmatches with their living related donors and panel reactive antibody titers more than 20%. All patients received intravenous immunoglobulin (500 mg/kg/day on alternate days for 6 doses). Panel reactive antibody titer measurement and crossmatch testing were carried out after each dose and before each subsequent one. Two months later, 8 patients received simvastatin (20 mg/day) for 2 months. Panel reactive antibody measurement titer and crossmatch testing were carried out every 2 weeks. Only 4 patients showed an insignificant reduction in panel reactive antibody activity (P=0.36). None of them attained a negative crossmatch. Furthermore, simvastatin also resulted in an insignificant reduction of HLA antibodies in 3 patients (P=0.32). We concluded that intravenous immunoglobulin or simvastatin alone cannot effectively inhibit preformed anti-HLA antibodies to allow successful renal transplantation. Further trials of the use of intravenous immunoglobulin and simvastatin with other modalities to desensitize these patients may be warranted.",

Silent myocardial ischemia, defined as documentation of ischemia in the absence of angina or anginal equivalents, affects up to 4 million Americans and carries a poor prognosis. The assessment of the presence of subclinical coronary atherosclerosis affords an opportunity to identify patients who may be at risk for coronary artery disease over the long term. In addition to traditional risk factors (such as lipid parameters, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, and age), a variety of novel factors (such as lipoprotein[a], homocysteine, and C-reactive protein) may enhance assessment of risk in specific populations. Risk modification should be aimed at achieving recommended levels of lipids and blood pressure, reducing obesity, facilitating optimal management of diabetes and the metabolic syndrome, and encouraging smoking cessation and physical activity. Clinicians should be knowledgeable regarding the application of national guidelines for the reduction of cardiovascular risk so as to maximize the prospects for both the primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease and associated adverse outcomes.", 
    "114": "The mechanism by which the 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) induce skeletal muscle injury is still under debate. By using fura-2 cytofluorimetry on intact extensor digitorum longus muscle fibers, here we provided the first evidence that 2 months in vivo chronic treatment of rats with fluvastatin (5 and 20 mg kg-1) and atorvastatin (5 and 10 mg kg-1) caused an alteration of calcium homeostasis. All treated animals showed a significant increase of resting cytosolic calcium [Ca2+]i, up to 60% with the higher fluvastatin dose and up to 20% with the other treatments. The [Ca2+]i rise induced by statin administration was not due to an increase of sarcolemmal permeability to calcium. Furthermore, the treatments reduced caffeine responsiveness. In vitro application of fluvastatin caused changes of [Ca2+]i, resembling the effect obtained after the in vivo administration. Indeed, fluvastatin produced a shift of mechanical threshold for contraction toward negative potentials and an increase of resting [Ca2+]i. By using ruthenium red and cyclosporine A, we determined the sequence of the statin-induced Ca2+ release mechanism. Mitochondria appeared as the cellular structure responsible for the earlier event leading to a subsequent large sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release. In conclusion, we suggest that calcium homeostasis alteration may be a crucial event for myotoxicity induced by this widely used class of hypolipidemic drugs.", 
    "115": "Although several lipid-modifying drug (LMD) treatments and strategies are available to successfully manage patients at risk for cardiovascular events, the benefits of drug treatment can be realized only if these therapies are continued on a long-term basis. Previous observational studies examining rates of discontinuation with LMDs are not generalizable to current clinical practice in the United States. In this study, the discontinuation of newly initiated LMD classes in recent clinical practice was compared in a geographically diverse, commercially insured United States population. Administrative claims from the Ingenix Lab/Rx Database were used to identify patients aged >or=20 years who were newly prescribed statins, extended-release niacin, fibrates, bile acid sequestrants, or ezetimibe from January 1, 2001, to June 30, 2003. An LMD class was considered discontinued if a patient did not receive a prescription from the same LMD class within 180 days of the most recent prescription expiration date. The median time to discontinuation was 8.2 months in the bile acid sequestrant group, followed by 12 months in the extended-release niacin group, 17.4 months in the fibrate group, and 27.5 months in the statin group. By the end of 1 year, the adjusted cumulative incidence of discontinuation was 68.3% in bile acid sequestrant users, 55.4% in extended-release niacin users, 39.9% in fibrate users, 33.0% in ezetimibe users, and 28.9% in statin users (p <0.001 for all LMD classes vs statins). In conclusion, despite the changes in lipid treatment paradigms and the importance of long-term lipid therapy, this study found high discontinuation rates of LMD classes in recent United States clinical practice.", 
    "116": "This retrospective study of prospectively collected data compared coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery to drug-eluting stenting (DES) in diabetic patients with multivessel coronary artery disease (CAD). Prior randomized trials and clinical studies have suggested that CABG may be the preferred revascularization strategy in diabetic patients with multivessel CAD. Data are limited regarding the impact of DES vs. CABG on clinical outcomes.", 
    "117": "We included 205 consecutive diabetic patients who underwent either CABG (n=103) or DES (n=102). The primary clinical end points were freedom from major adverse cardiac events (MACE) at 30 days and 1 year.", 
    "118": "Baseline characteristics were similar between both groups. At 1 year, the mortality rate was similar in the CABG and DES group (8% vs. 10%, p=0.6) but the MACE rate was lower in the CABG group (12% vs. 27%, p=0.006) due to less repeat revascularization with CABG (3% vs. 20%, p<0.001). Stroke occurred only in the CABG group (4% vs. 0%, p=0.04). Angiographically-documented stent thrombosis after DES occurred in 3%. Presentation with acute myocardial infarction (hazard ratio [HR], 2.26, 95% CI, 1.13 to 4.55) and DES (HR, 2.4, 95% CI, 1.23 to 4.77) were positive independent predictors, whereas therapy with a statin was a negative independent predictor of MACE (HR, 0.40, 95% CI, 0.21 to 0.76).", 
    "119": "Bypass surgery was associated with less MACE primarily due to the higher repeat revascularization rate with DES and is therefore superior to DES despite more extensive CAD in CABG patients.", 
    "120": "Familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL), the most common inherited disorder of lipid metabolism, is associated with an increased risk of atherosclerosis that is not fully explained by the metabolic disturbances of these patients. Oxidative damage to lipid components accumulating in the plasma of FCHL patients might contribute to explaining this lack of evidence. Cholesterol is one of the preferential targets of oxidation in LDL and this may contribute to setting a proatherogenetic phenotype in FCHL. We investigated plasma oxysterols (7-ketocholesterol and 7beta-hydroxycholesterol) and alpha-tocopherol as in vivo hallmarks of lipid-related oxidative stress. Oxidative stress hallmarks were measured in 45 FCHL patients and 54 sex- and age-matched healthy controls; in FCHL patients, oxidative stress and lipid profile parameters were also assessed in response to lipid-lowering drugs in a 24-week randomized, open-label trial with atorvastatin or fenofibrate. FCHL patients showed markedly increased levels of oxysterols (p < 0.001) and reduced alpha-tocopherol/total lipids (p < 0.001) compared to controls. These differences were independent of the presence of clinical atherosclerosis and persisted after correction for hyperlipidemia. Atorvastatin and fenofibrate significantly improved the lipid profile and caused a comparable decrease in plasma oxysterols, with the normalization of 7-ketocholesterol and a significant reduction of 7beta-hydroxycholesterol (p < 0.001). These drugs also decreased the ratio of alpha-tocopherol/total lipids by more than 30% (p < 0.001). In conclusion, FCHL patients showed increased hallmarks of cholesterol oxidation and decreased levels of alpha-tocopherol/total lipids. Atorvastatin and fenofibrate displayed comparable efficiency in decreasing oxysterols, but they further decreased lipid-corrected alpha-tocopherol levels in plasma. More research work is needed to understand the clinical meaning of these findings, which may help to understand the role of oxidative stress in FCHL and lipid-lowering therapy.", 
    "121": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a worldwide epidemic. Its prevalence is rapidly increasing in both developing and developed countries. Coronary heart disease (CHD) is highly prevalent and is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. The purpose of this review is to assess the clinical impact of recent advances in the epidemiology, prevention, and management of CHD in diabetic patients. A systematic review of publications in this area, referenced in MEDLINE in the past 5 years (2000 to 2005), was undertaken. Patients with CHD and prediabetic states should undergo lifestyle modifications aimed at preventing DM. Pharmacological prevention of DM is also promising but requires further study. In patients with CHD and DM, routine use of aspirin and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I)--unless contraindicated or not tolerated-and strict glycemic, blood pressure, and lipid control are strongly recommended. The targets for secondary prevention in these patients are relatively well defined, but the strategies to achieve them vary and must be individualized. Intense insulin therapy might be needed for glycemic control, and high-dose statin therapy might be needed for lipid control. For blood pressure control, ACE-Is and angiotensin receptor blockers are considered as first-line therapy. Noncompliance, particularly with lifestyle measures, and underprescription of evidence-based therapies remain important unsolved problems.",

TUNEL technology and immunohistochemistry method were respectively used to detect the apoptotic rate and P27 protein expression in cardiomyocytes. Colorimetric method was used to measure myocardial hydroxyproline (Hyp) content. Meanwhile, left ventricular weight to body weight ratio (LVW/BW), systolic blood pressure (SBP) and serum lipids levels were examined.", 
    "124": "After 10 weeks treatment with atorvastatin, LVW/BW ratio and myocardial Hyp content in SHR(ATV) group were markedly decreased compared to SHR(DW) group (P<0.01); the apoptotic rate and P27 protein expression in cardiomyocytes in SHR(ATV) group were much higher than those in SHR(DW) group (P<0.01). In addition, compared with before treatment and SHR(DW)group, SBP in SHR(ATV) group was markedly decreased (P<0.01). The serum lipids levels in SHR(ATV) group were also markedly lower than those in SHR(DW) group and WKY group (P<0.01).",

The genetic background of these AEs is not clear and possibly side effects and lipid lowering efficacy may be linked. Aim of the study was a detailed evaluation of CYP450 and apolipoprotein E gene polymorphisms in two large series of age-sex matched patients with and without muscular side effects to statins. In a Clinical Institution specialised in lipid-lipoprotein disorders, 50 statin treated patients were selected, with subjective or objective statin-associated myopathy, evaluated using standardized forms. These were sex and age matched with 50 statin-treated patients from the same Clinic, without any subjective or objective complaints. DNA samples for the evaluation of CYP450 genetic polymorphisms and apo E genotypes were collected in order to assess correlations with both genetic polymorphisms and AEs, as well as with therapeutic efficacy. None of the assessed CYP450 polymorphisms appeared to be related to an increased incidence of AEs. The CYP2D6 *1/*4 and *4/4* poor metabolizer (PM) status was associated to a higher efficacy of statins metabolized by this system and, in addition, the apo E2 genotype was, in this series, linked to increased HDL-C levels after therapy. Patients with statin associated myopathy are not characterized by significantly different genotypes for the CYP450s responsible for statin metabolism. On the other hand, CYP2D6 PM status is associated to an increased efficacy of statins metabolized by this system.", 
    "127": "A simple and sensitive liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry method was developed and validated for the quantification of rosuvastatin in human plasma. After being treated with acetic acid and tetrabutyl ammonium hydroxide, the analyte was extracted by simple one-step liquid-liquid extraction with the internal standard (IS: estrone). The chromatographic separation was performed on a Phenomenex Luna C18 column with a mobile phase consisting of 2% formic acid/methanol (20:90, v/v) at a flow rate of 1.00 mL/min with a split of 200 microL to mass spectrometer. The retention time of rosuvastatin and internal standard was 2.3 and 3.4 min, respectively. Triple-quadrupole MS/MS detection was operated in positive mode by monitoring the transition of m/z 482-->258 for rosuvastatin and m/z 271-->253 for IS. Validation results indicated that the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 0.1 ng mL(-1) and the assay exhibited a linear range of 0.1-20 ng mL(-1) and gave a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.9990 or better. Inaccuracy was less than 8.4% and imprecision less than 12.8% at all tested concentration levels. The analyte was stable in human plasma following three freeze/thaw cycles and for up to 8 weeks following storage at -20 degrees C. The assay was successfully applied to the analysis of rosuvastatin in human plasma samples derived from clinical pre-trials.", 
    "128": "Lymphocytes possess the essential components of a cholinergic system, including acetylcholine (ACh); choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), its synthesizing enzyme; and both muscarinic and nicotinic ACh receptors (mAChRs and nAChRs, respectively). Stimulation of lymphocytes with phytohemagglutinin, which activates T cells via the T cell receptor/CD3 complex, enhances the synthesis and release of ACh and up-regulates expression of ChAT and M(5) mAChR mRNAs. In addition, activation of protein kinase C and increases in intracellular cAMP also enhance cholinergic activity in T cells, and lymphocyte function associated antigen-1 (LFA-1; CD11a/CD18) is an important mediator of leukocyte migration and T cell activation. Anti-CD11a monoclonal antibody (mAb) as well as antithymocyte globulin containing antibodies against CD2, CD7 and CD11a all increase ChAT activity, ACh synthesis and release, and expression of ChAT and M(5) mAChR mRNAs in T cells. The cholesterol-lowering drug simvastatin inhibits LFA-1 signaling by binding to an allosteric site on CD11a (LFA-1 alpha chain), which leads to immunomodulation. We found that simvastatin abolishes anti-CD11a mAb-induced increases in lymphocytic cholinergic activity in a manner independent of its cholesterol-lowering activity. Collectively then, these results indicate that LFA-1 contributes to the regulation of lymphocytic cholinergic activity via CD11a-mediated pathways and suggest that simvastatin exerts its immunosuppressive effects in part via modification of lymphocytic cholinergic activity.", 
    "129": "Acute vascular- and neuroprotective effects of simvastatin were evaluated in a rat model of transient, focal cerebral ischemia. Male, Wistar rats (n=12) underwent transient middle cerebral artery (MCA) occlusion for 3 hours followed by 3 hours of reperfusion. After 30 minutes of MCA occlusion, four rats each were subcutaneously injected with either 20 or 40 mg/kg of simvastatin. At the end of 3 hours of reperfusion, tissue injury and blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening were quantified by histology and [(14)C]-alpha-aminoisobutyric acid (AIB)-based quantitative autoradiography (QAR), respectively. Compared with untreated rats, those treated with simvastatin (20 mg/kg) had reduced volumes of AIB leakage, tissue pallor and distribution space for AIB (p<0.05). No additional effects were seen with the higher drug dose (40 mg/kg). These data suggest that the acute neuroprotective effects of statins are in part owing to attenuation of stroke-induced changes in BBB permeability.", 
    "130": "Development of the systolic left ventricular insufficiency in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) markedly decreases the survival rates, so the factors affecting the clinical status of these patients should be reevaluated. The left ventricular contractile function has been assessed by measurements of the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) values. The studied group of 160 males comprised 102 CAD patients diagnosed by coronarography, and 58 persons without CAD and left ventricular systolic insufficiency. The CAD patients were divided into 2 subgroups according to the LVEF values: 53 patients qualified to have normal left ventricular contractile function (with LVEF > 40%), and 49-patients, with LVEF < or = 40%, were considered as subgroup with the left ventricular contractile insufficiency. In the case-control set up the effects of smoking, concentrations of homocysteine (Hcy) and folic acid (FA) and of the known risk factors of the vascular diseases in the development of the left ventricular contractile insufficiency were assessed. Moreover, analysis was performed of the association between LV insufficiency and the statin therapy and the number of infarcts. LV insufficiency in CAD patients associated with increased diastolic pressure (p = 0.006) and with increased uric acid concentrations in plasma (p = 0.02). The smoking, decrease in HDL-C and increased index TC/HDLC were the risk factors of CAD, independent of the LV insufficiency. In comparison to the CAD patients with the preserved systolic function, in the group of CAD patients with LV systolic insufficiency, more persons had recurrent infarcts (34.7% vs. 5.7%), and less persons had no infarct (8.2% vs. 20.8%, p < 0.05). In CAD patients with LV systolic insufficiency smoking associated with the higher values of HC/FA index (p = 0.01), younger age of the patients (p = 0.01), the number of persons not treated with statins (0.01) and the number of persons not having had heart infarct before (p < 0.05). These findings confirm both the effects of infarcts on the development of LV insufficiency, and the presumed association between the pathogenicity of smoking in LV insufficiency and the unbalanced metabolism of Hcy. The straight of the effect of smoking on the development of LV insufficiency in susceptible persons is shown also by the findings of the younger age of the smoking CAD patients as compared to the nonsmoking patients with LV insufficiency.",

In addition, they exhibit other effects unrelated to their lipid lowering effects (pleiotropic actions). In recent years, experimental and clinical evidence demonstrates that statins exert antiarrhythmic properties, reducing the recurrences of supraventricular and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias both in patients with and without coronary artery disease (CAD). Thus, statins may constitute a novel therapeutic approach to cardiac arrhythmias. This article reviews the antiarrhythmic properties of statins as well as the possible mechanisms involved, including the lowering of LDL-C levels, the improvement of endothelial dysfunction and autonomic function, the stabilization of the atherosclerotic plaques, the antioxidant, antiinflammatory, antithrombotic and cardioprotective properties and the modulation of transmembrane ion fluxes.",

In this study, a short-term course of lovastatin treatment is shown to markedly inhibit the development of experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN) in the absence of hepatotoxic or myotoxic complications. Independent of cholesterol reduction, lovastatin treatment prevented EAN-induced peripheral nerve conduction deficits and morphologic nerve injury. Co-administration with mevalonate neutralized the prophylactic effects of lovastatin. When administered therapeutically, lovastatin significantly shortened the disease course. Autoreactive immunity, measured in vitro by myelin-stimulated proliferation of splenocytes, was significantly diminished by in vivo lovastatin treatment. Th1-dominant immune responses, measured by cytokine profiling, however, were not affected by lovastatin. Sciatic nerves of lovastatin-treated immunized rats showed markedly reduced levels of cellular infiltrates. Treating peripheral nerve endothelial monolayers with lovastatin significantly inhibited the in vitro migration of autoreactive splenocytes. Together, these data demonstrate that a short-term course of lovastatin attenuates the development and progression of EAN in Lewis rats by limiting the proliferation and migration of autoreactive leukocytes.",

The primary efficacy parameter (absolute change from baseline in total duration of ischemia at month 12) was significantly reduced in both groups at month 3 and month 12 (both P<0.001 for each treatment group) with no significant difference between the treatment groups. Atorvastatin-treated patients experienced greater low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reductions than did pravastatin-treated patients, a trend toward fewer major acute cardiovascular events (hazard ratio, 0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.46, 1.09; P=0.114), and a significantly greater reduction in all-cause death (hazard ratio, 0.33; 95% confidence interval, 0.13, 0.83; P=0.014).",

We evaluated vascular function, peroxide production by dihydroethidium and NADPH oxidase activity in vessels from atorvastatin-treated mice. Rac-1 activity was also assessed, both by immunoprecipitation of the Rac-p21-activated kinase complex and by analysis of Rac-1 translocation to the membrane. These experiments were also conducted in vessels infected with an adenoviral vector carrying a constitutively active mutant of Rac-1.",

This effect was also observed in a murine model of diabetes mellitus. More importantly, the addition of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) blocked the effects of atorvastatin in both glucose-exposed HAECs and diabetic vessels. Atorvastatin failed to afford protection against vascular abnormalities in the presence of a constitutively active mutant of Rac-1.",

The number of persons with Alzheimer's disease is expected to triple by mid-century. If steps are not taken to delay the onset or slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease, the economic and personal tolls will be immense. Different classes of potentially disease-modifying treatments that interrupt early pathological events (ie, decreasing production or aggregation of Abeta or increasing its clearance) and potentially prevent downstream events are in phase II or III clinical studies. These include immunotherapies; secretase inhibitors; selective Abeta42-lowering agents; statins; anti-Abeta aggregation agents; peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma agonists; and others. Safety and serious adverse events have been a concern with immunotherapy and gamma-secretase inhibitors, though both continue in clinical trials. Anti-amyloid disease-modifying drugs that seem promising and have reached phase III clinical trials include those that selectively target Abeta42 production (eg, tarenflurbil), enhance the activity of alpha-secretase (eg, statins), and block Abeta aggregation (eg, transiposate).",

    "176": "Simvastatin is a semisynthetic derivative of the fungal polyketide lovastatin and is an important drug for lowering cholesterol levels in adults. We have developed a one-step, whole-cell biocatalytic process for the synthesis of simvastatin from monacolin J. By using an Escherichia coli strain overexpressing the previously discovered acyltransferase LovD (X. Xie, K. Watanabe, W. A. Wojcicki, C. C. Wang, and Y. Tang, Chem. Biol. 13:1161-1169, 2006), we were able to achieve >99% conversion of monacolin J to simvastatin without the use of any chemical protection steps. The key finding was a membrane-permeable substrate, alpha-dimethylbutyryl-S-methyl-mercaptopropionate, that was efficiently utilized by LovD as the acyl donor. The process was scaled up for gram-scale synthesis of simvastatin. We also demonstrated that simvastatin synthesized via this method can be readily purified from the fermentation broth with >90% recovery and >98% purity as determined by high-performance liquid chromatography. Bioconversion using high-cell-density, fed-batch fermentation was also examined. The whole-cell biocatalysis can therefore be an attractive alternative to currently used multistep semisynthetic transformations.", 
    "177": "Numerous recent reports suggest that statins (hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors) exhibit potential to suppress tumorigenesis through a mechanism that is not fully understood. Therefore, in this article, we investigated the effects of simvastatin on TNF-alpha-induced cell signaling. We found that simvastatin potentiated the apoptosis induced by TNF-alpha as indicated by intracellular esterase activity, caspase activation, TUNEL, and annexin V staining. This effect of simvastatin correlated with down-regulation of various gene products that mediate cell proliferation (cyclin D1 and cyclooxygenase-2), cell survival (Bcl-2, Bcl-x(L), cellular FLIP, inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1, inhibitor of apoptosis protein 2, and survivin), invasion (matrix mellatoproteinase-9 and ICAM-1), and angiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor); all known to be regulated by the NF-kappaB. We found that simvastatin inhibited TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation, and l-mevalonate reversed the suppressive effect, indicating the role of hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase. Simvastatin suppressed not only the inducible but also the constitutive NF-kappaB activation. Simvastatin inhibited TNF-alpha-induced IkappaBalpha kinase activation, which led to inhibition of IkappaBalpha phosphorylation and degradation, suppression of p65 phosphorylation, and translocation to the nucleus. NF-kappaB-dependent reporter gene expression induced by TNF-alpha, TNFR1, TNFR-associated death domain protein, TNFR-associated factor 2, TGF-beta-activated kinase 1, receptor-interacting protein, NF-kappaB-inducing kinase, and IkappaB kinase beta was abolished by simvastatin. Overall, our results provide novel insight into the role of simvastatin in potentially preventing and treating cancer through modulation of IkappaB kinase and NF-kappaB-regulated gene products.", 
    "178": "The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, simvastatin, has been shown to attenuate chronic hypoxic pulmonary hypertension (CHPH). Here, we assess whether simvastatin is capable of inducing regression of established CHPH and explore potential mechanisms of statin effect. Rats (n = 8 in each group) were exposed to chronic hypoxia (10% Fi(O(2))) for 2 or 4 wk. Simvastatin treatment (20 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) commenced after 2 wk of hypoxia, at which time CHPH was fully established, reduced mean pulmonary artery pressure (19 +/- 0.5 vs. 27 +/- 0.9 mmHg; P < 0.001), the ratio of right ventricular free wall to left ventricular plus septal weight (0.41 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.54 +/- 0.03; P < 0.001), and medial thickening of small pulmonary arteries (13 +/- 0.4 vs. 16 +/- 0.4%; P < 0.01) compared with 4-wk hypoxic controls. Supplementation with mevalonate (50 mg.kg(-1).day(-1)) prevented the attenuation of CHPH induced by simvastatin during 2 wk of hypoxia. Because statins are known to inhibit Rho-kinase (ROCK), we determined expression of ROCK-1 and -2 in whole lung by Western blot and ROCK activity by phosphorylation of the myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase. Expression of both ROCK-1 and -2 were markedly diminished in simvastatin-treated animals during normoxia and hypoxia (2- and 4-wk) exposure (P < 0.01). ROCK activity was increased threefold under hypoxic conditions and normalized with simvastatin treatment (P < 0.001). We conclude that simvastatin attenuates and induces regression of established CHPH through inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase. Inhibition of ROCK expression and activity may be an important mechanism of statin effect.", 
    "179": "We assessed whether aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid, ASA), administered before reperfusion, abrogates the infarct size (IS)-limiting effect of atorvastatin (ATV). Statins reduce IS. This dose-dependent effect is mediated by upregulation of cycloxygenase-2 (COX2) and PGI(2) production. Administration of selective COX2-inhibitors either with ATV for 3 days or immediately before coronary occlusion blocks the IS-limiting effect of ATV. Sprague-Dawley rats received 3-day ATV (10 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1)) or water alone. Rats underwent 30 min coronary artery occlusion and 4 h reperfusion (IS protocol, n=8 in each group), or rats underwent 30 min coronary artery occlusion and 10 min reperfusion (enzyme expression and activity protocol, n=4 in each group). Immediately before reperfusion rats received intravenous ASA (5, 10, or 20 mg/kg) or saline. Area-at-risk (AR) was assessed by blue dye and IS by triphenyltetrazolium chloride. ATV reduced IS (10.1 +/- 1.4% of the AR) compared with controls (31.0 +/- 2.2%). Intravenous ASA alone did not affect IS (29.0 +/- 2.6%); however, ASA dose dependently (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg) attenuated the protective effect of ATV on IS (15.8 +/- 0.9%, 22.0 +/- 1.6%, and 23.7 +/- 3.8%, respectively). ASA dose dependently blocked the upregulation of COX2 by ATV. COX2 activity was as follows: control, 8.93 +/- 0.90 pg/mg; ATV, 75.85 +/- 1.08 pg/mg; ATV + ASA5, 34.39 +/- 1.48 pg/mg; ATV + ASA10, 19.87 +/- 1.10 pg/mg; and ATV + ASA20, 9.36 +/- 0.94 pg/mg. ASA, administered before reperfusion in doses comparable to those used in the clinical setting, abrogates the IS-limiting effect of ATV in a model with mechanical occlusion of the coronary artery. This potential adverse interaction should be further investigated in the clinical setting of acute coronary syndromes.", 
    "180": "In vertebrates, the morphogenetic assembly of the primitive heart tube requires the medial migration and midline fusion of the bilateral myocardial epithelia. Several mutations that result in abnormal heart-tube formation have been studied; however, an understanding of the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms of the migration and fusion of these epithelial sheets is far from complete. In a forward genetic screen to identify genes regulating early zebrafish heart development, we identified a mutation in the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A reductase 1b (hmgcr1b) gene that affects myocardial migration to the midline and subsequent heart-tube morphogenesis. The mutant phenotype can be rescued with injections of mevalonate, the direct product of HMGCR activity. Furthermore, treatment of embryos with pharmacological inhibitors of isoprenoid synthesis, which occurs downstream of mevalonate production, resulted in defective heart-tube formation. Interestingly, in hmgcr1b mutant embryos and embryos treated with HMGCR inhibitors, both RasCT20-eGFP and RhoaCT32-eGFP fusion proteins were mislocalized away from the plasma membrane in embryonic myocardial cells. We conclude that protein prenylation, acting downstream of Hmgcr1b and possibly through Ras and, or, Rho signaling, is required for the morphogenesis of the myocardial sheets for formation of the primitive heart tube.", 
    "181": "The Hedgehog signaling pathway plays a key role in directing growth and patterning during embryonic development and is required in vertebrates for the normal development of many structures, including the neural tube, axial skeleton, skin, and hair. Aberrant activation of the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway in adult tissue is associated with the development of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), medulloblastoma, and a subset of pancreatic, gastrointestinal, and other cancers. This review will provide an overview of what is known about the mechanisms by which activation of Hedgehog signaling leads to the development of BCCs and will review two recent papers suggesting that agents that modulate sterol levels might influence the Hh pathway. Thus, sterols may be a new therapeutic target for the treatment of BCCs, and readily available agents such as statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) or vitamin D might be helpful in reducing BCC incidence.",

However, whether uPA/uPAR-directed mechanisms are involved in the beneficial effects of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors on vascular remodeling remains unexplored. In this study, we have investigated the effect of the hydrophilic statin rosuvastatin on neointimal remodeling, and the role of uPAR. Using an ex vivo organ and in vitro cell culture models we demonstrate that rosuvastatin decreases injury-induced neointima formation and proliferation of medial VSMC in porcine coronary arteries, as well as migration and proliferation of human coronary VSMC. Studies on the underlying mechanisms show that rosuvastatin impairs VSMC transition from their physiological contractile to the pathophysiological synthetic phenotype. These effects are mediated, at least in part, via uPAR, as confirmed by means of rosuvastatin-directed uPAR expression and uPAR silencing in both models. Our findings provide evidence that rosuvastatin modulates VSMC phenotypic changes and subsequently their proliferation and migration, and indicate the important role for uPAR in these processes. This mechanism contributes to the beneficial non-lipid lowering effect of rosuvastatin on negative vascular remodeling.",

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the effect of simvastatin therapy on insulin resistance and on leptin, adiponectin, and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, as compared to metformin, in overweight pre-diabetic subjects. Forty-one subjects with BMI >25 kg/m(2) and impaired fasting glucose or impaired glucose tolerance were randomized to take simvastatin, 20 mg/day (N = 20) or metformin, 1.7 g/day (N = 21) for 16 weeks. Blood samples for the determination of metabolic, hormonal, and inflammatory parameters were obtained at baseline and after each treatment. After metformin therapy, significant reductions in mean BMI and waist circumference were observed, and after simvastatin treatment LDL and triglyceride levels were significantly reduced. Insulin resistance determined by the homeostasis model assessment decreased only with metformin. Independently of the type of medication, a significant decrease in CRP levels was detected from baseline to the end of the study. CRP showed a mean reduction of 0.12 +/- 0.04 mg/dL (P = 0.002) over time. No change in leptin or adiponectin levels was induced by any therapy. The data suggest that a low dose of simvastatin does not affect insulin resistance in overweight pre-diabetic subjects and has no effect on leptin or adiponectin levels. Further studies including a larger sample size, higher doses of statins, and a placebo control group are necessary to confirm the present data.",

After adjusting for patient characteristics and site, the factor most strongly associated with having both types of laboratory tests evaluated was concomitant therapy with a statin (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 1.55; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.05-2.29). Other factors associated with having both types of laboratory tests evaluated included the number of outpatient visits in the 6 months before the period of amiodarone dispensings (adjusted OR 1.06; 95% CI, 1.00- 1.13 for each additional 5 visits) and living in a neighborhood where a higher median percentage of people had a high school or higher education (adjusted OR 1.09; 95% CI, 1.00-1.18 for every 10% increase in educational level at the block level). There was no association between monitoring and patient illness severity as measured by the number of comorbid conditions. On the basis of an evaluation of a randomly selected subset of 104 patient records, the sensitivity and specificity of automated data were 94.2% and 85.7% for aminotransferase tests and 83.3% and 81.1% for thyroid function tests, respectively.", 
    "206": "Approximately half of ambulatory patients dispensed amiodarone received both recommended laboratory tests for liver and thyroid function. Improved rates of testing for liver aminotransferase and thyroid function are needed for patients who receive amiodarone.", 
    "207": "Diabetes mellitus (DM), which induces alterations in energy metabolism, is the leading cause of cardiovascular disease. We postulated that peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC-alpha), a transcriptional coactivator that is the primary regulator of oxidative metabolism and mitochondrial biogenesis, and cardiac function are depressive in DM and simvastatin and losartan therapy can improve the affects of DM on mRNA expression of PGC-1alpha and cardiac function. An experimental model of DM (induced by streptozocin 60 mg/kg) in adult male rats (n = 24) was used to investigate the mRNA expression of PGC-1alpha in the left ventricular myocardium. These rats were divided into group I (insulin therapy only, n = 8), group II (insulin plus simvastatin 20 mg/kg/day orally, n = 8), and group III (insulin plus losartan 20 mg/kg/day orally, n = 8). Diabetic rats and 8 healthy rats (group IV) were sacrificed at 3 weeks following DM induction. The mRNA expression of PGC-1alpha was measured using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Additionally, transthoracic echocardiography was performed on days 0 and 21. The experimental results indicated that the mRNA expression of PGC-1alpha and the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF %) were significantly lower in groups I, II and III than in group IV (all P < 0.001). However, the mRNA expression of PGC-1alpha and the LVEF were significantly higher in group III than in groups I and II (both P < 0.01). Conversely, mRNA expression of PGC-1alpha and LVEF did not differ between groups I and II (P > 0.5). In conclusion, DM induces suppression of mRNA expression of PGC-1alpha and LV function in diabetic rats. Losartan and not simvastatin therapy improved the LV function and the expression of this mitochondrial-biogenesis regulator.", 
    "208": "The study describes development and subsequent validation of a stability indicating reverse-phase HPLC method for the simultaneous estimation of atorvastatin (ATV), and amlodipine (AML) from their combination drug product. The proposed RP-HPLC method utilizes a Lichrospher 100 C18, 5 microm, 250 mm x 4.0 mm i.d. column, at ambient temperature, optimum mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile and 50 mM potassium dihydrogen phosphate buffer (60 : 40, v/v), apparent pH adjusted to 3+/-0.1 with 10% phosphoric acid solution, effluent flow rate monitored at 1.0 ml/min, and UV detection at 254 nm. ATV, AML, and their combination drug product were exposed to thermal, photolytic, hydrolytic, and oxidative stress conditions, and the stressed samples were analyzed by proposed method. The method was applied for the in vitro dissolution of marketed combination drug products. The described method was linear over the range of 1-90 microg/ml and 1-80 microg/ml for ATV and AML, respectively. The mean recoveries were 99.76 and 98.12% for ATV and AML, respectively. The intermediate precision data obtained under different experimental setup, the calculated value of coefficient of variation (CV, %) was found to be less than critical value. The limit of detection for ATV and AML were found to be 0.4 and 0.6 mug/ml, respectively and the limit of quantification was 1.0 microg/ml for both drugs. The average percentage drug release was found to be more than 70% within 30 min for both drugs. Chromatographic peak purity data of ATV and AML indicated no co-eluting peaks with the main peaks of drugs which demonstrated the specificity of assay method for their estimation in presence of degradation products. The proposed method can be useful in the quality control and in vitro dissolution of combination drug products.", 
    "209": "Excitotoxicity is a major cause of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death during ischemic diseases such as vessel occlusion and diabetic retinopathy. However, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Statins, inhibitors of the HMG-CoA reductase, have neuroprotective effects in addition to their original role in lowering cholesterol. We hypothesize that pitavastatin, a recently introduced potent statin, is protective against N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA)-induced RGC death. Pitavastatin, administered by gavage, abolished NMDA-induced loss of RGCs. To elucidate the mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effect of pitavastatin, we investigated its impact on inflammation. NMDA increased the expression of interleukin-1beta and TNF-alpha, and endothelial adhesion molecules, including ICAM-1, and induced leukocyte accumulation in the retinal vessels. Pitavastatin significantly reduced NMDA-induced leukocyte accumulation and up-regulation of endothelial adhesion molecules, whereas cytokine expression was unaffected. Systemic blockade of ICAM-1 in wild-type mice or absence of CD18 in gene-deficient (CD18(-/-)) mice significantly suppressed NMDA-induced leukocyte accumulation and RGC death. These findings suggest a novel and causative role for inflammatory leukocyte recruitment in NMDA-induced excitotoxicity. Furthermore, we show the novel neuroprotective effect of statins against excitotoxicity-induced RGC death. Statins or other anti-inflammatory agents may thus have therapeutic benefits in excitotoxicity-associated neuronal diseases through blockade of leukocyte recruitment.", 
    "210": "Atherosclerosis and its complications represent the major cause of death in developed countries. Statins are inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A [HMGCoA] reductase and consequently inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis. Statins have been described as the most potent class of drugs to reduce serum cholesterol levels. In clinical trials, statins are beneficial in primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. Statins, were initially designed as cholesterol-lowering drugs. However, these drugs, besides their lipid-lowering properties, exert a number of protective effects on the cardiovascular system that emerged over the past years. The benefits observed with statin treatment appear to be greater than that might be expected from reduction in lipid levels alone, suggesting effects beyond cholesterol lowering. These cholesterol-independent effects have been called \"pleiotropic\". The cholesterol-independent or \"pleiotropic\" effects of statins involve improvement of endothelial function, stability of atherosclerotic plaques, decrease of oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibition of thrombogenic response. These pleiotropic effects of statins have been proposed as key properties of these drugs to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The present review will emphasize the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of statins on endothelial function and oxidative stress. In particular, inhibition of small GTP-binding proteins, Rho, Ras and Rac, which are regulated by isoprenoids [farnesyl pyrophosphate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate], seems to play an important role in mediating the pleiotropic effects of statins."
