    "1": "From the Caserta-1 Local Health Service database, 93 general practitioners (GPs) who had consistently sent data about their patients during the years 2003-2005 were recruited. Prevalence of use and incidence of new treatments were calculated for each year, stratified by three drug cohorts: statins, omega-3 fatty acids, and fibrates. Subanalyses by gender, age, and indication of use were performed.", 
    "2": "Overall, 1-year prevalence of LLD use increased from 2003 to 2004. After reimbursement criteria revision (November 2004), a slight decrease was observed for statins, from 41.1 (95% CI: 39.9-42.2) per 1,000 inhabitants in 2004 to 40.3 (39.2-41.5) in 2005, while omega-3 utilization fell markedly: 14.6 (13.9-15.3) vs. 5.4 (5.0-5.8). The use of both statins and omega-3 fatty acids was reduced particularly for primary prevention. On the other hand, utilization of statins increased in diabetic patients and as secondary prevention from 2004 to 2005. Concerning individual molecules, 1-year prevalence of use of any statin declined from 2004 to 2005, except for rosuvastatin.", 
    "3": "Revision of reimbursement criteria led to significant changes in the trend in LLD use in general practice in southern Italy: (1) statin utilization was slightly reduced in 2005, although it increased in certain categories, such as diabetic patients, and (2) omega-3 fatty acid use was strongly reduced even though a higher use in postinfarction cases was reported.", 
    "4": "The study was designed to evaluate the effect of delayed release (DR) on absorption and bioavailability of intestinally metabolized drugs after oral dosing, using the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin, a CYP3A substrate, as a model drug.", 
    "5": "To target drug release and to assess regional gastrointestinal absorption of the CYP 3A substrate simvastatin from the distal parts of the intestine, delayed release film coated tableted oral dosage forms were developed. Simvastatin delayed release tablet, simvastatin immediate release capsule and simvastatin immediate release tablet Zocor were administered as single doses (20 mg) to fasting healthy volunteers in a crossover design.", 
    "6": "Simvastatin bioavailability was increased by a factor of three, as compared to the reference formulation Zocor. The overall metabolite levels from the immediate release capsules tended to be higher throughout the period studied than the metabolite levels following administration of Zocor and simvastatin delayed release dosage form.", 
    "7": "The interplay between gastrointestinal physiology (lower CYP 3A expression in the distal ileum and the colon) and formulation design (zero-order controlled release after a predetermined lag-time) resulted in successful absorption and bioavailability improvement and represent a viable strategy to reduce the dose of CYP 3A drugs.", 
    "8": "Phymas (swellings, masses, or bulbs) are considered the end-stage of rosacea and mostly affect the nose (rhinophyma), and rarely involve the chin (gnatophyma), the cheek (metophyma), eyelids (blepharophyma), or ears (otophyma). Herein, we report the case of a 57-year-old man who developed unilateral enlargement of his left ear over 2 years. Biopsy revealed changes of rosaceous lymphedema associated with Demodex infestation. Corticosteroid and minocycline therapies resulted in partial reduction of the ear enlargement. Literature review examining for cases of lymphedema (elephantiasis) of the ear revealed that chronic inflammatory disorders (rosacea (most frequent), psoriasis, eczema), bacterial cellulitis (erysipelas), pediculosis, trauma, and primary (congenital) lymphedema can all lead to localized, lymphedematous enlargement of the ear. Depending on the severity, medical treatment directed at the inflammatory condition for mild, diffuse enlargement to surgical debulking for extensive diffuse enlargement or tumor formation can improve the signs and symptoms of otophyma. Decreased immune surveillance secondary to rosaceous lymphedema may explain why Demodex infestation is common in rosacea and support the suspicion that phymatous skin is predisposed to skin cancer development.", 
    "9": "This is the second of two review articles evaluating peri-operative statin therapy. In surgical patients, the utility of peri-operative statin therapy is strongly suggested by retrospective studies, although it is probably overestimated, as important confounding factors have not been controlled for and hence the literature is considered to be currently inconclusive. This review examines the potential mechanisms and indications for peri-operative statin protection, the efficacy of acute peri-operative beta-blockade in addition to statin therapy, the effect of peri-operative statin therapy withdrawal and the implications of comorbidities associated with peri-operative cardiovascular risk on statin therapy. Recommendations concerning appropriate dosing, duration, therapeutic targets and necessary investigations when prescribing peri-operative statins are made. Peri-operative study design recommendations are suggested, so that future meta-analyses may be more informative. Recommendations are made regarding retrospective reporting of statin studies to minimise the bias inherent in a number of the current retrospective studies on this subject.", 
    "10": "Chronic stable angina is a common clinical problem limiting the quality of life. Patients with suspected stable angina require prompt cardiological investigation to ensure that the diagnosis is correct and that the prognosis is evaluated. An initial non-invasive strategy using an exercise test is most appropriate. All patients should be advised regarding life-style modifications to correct risk factors. In the absence of contraindications or intolerance acetylsalicylic acid and statins should be given. ACE-inhibitors are indicated in patients with left ventricular dysfunction, hypertension or diabetes and patients with other high-risk features. Beta blockers are used in all patients after myocardial infarction and those with left ventricular dysfunction. Anti-anginal therapy is based on the use of short-acting nitrates. Beta blockers, calcium antagonists and long-acting nitrates reduce the frequency and intensity of angina. In patients with high-risk features and those whose symptoms cannot be adequately controlled by medications coronary angiography should be considered. Both percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass graft operation (CABG) are effective measures to control anginal symptoms. However, only CABG has been shown to improve prognosis in some high-risk patients.", 
    "11": "We evaluated the disease modifying effect of simvastatin and atorvastatin in Dextran Sulfate Sodium (DSS) model of colitis.", 
    "12": "Thirty, 8-week old female Swiss-Webster mice were separated into 5 groups (n = 6/group). Colitis was induced by feeding 4 % DSS solution for 7 days. Following discontinuation of DSS, over the next 7 days, the groups orally received simvastatin (20 mg/kg/day), atorvastatin (60 mg/kg/day), vehicle only (0.75 % methylcellulose), subcutaneous 30 mug injections of anti-TNFalpha monoclonal antibody or intraperitoneal anti-mouse apolipoprotein A-I antibody respectively. Disease activity Index (DAI) was determined daily by a blinded investigator.", 
    "13": "The mean reduction in DAI scores from day 7 to day 14 for anti-TNFalpha group, simvastatin and atorvastatin group were 74 %, 76 % and 64 %, respectively as compared to 41 % reduction in vehicle and anti-apolipoprotein A-I antibody-treated groups.", 
    "14": "This finding suggests that statins may have the ability to modify the disease activity in the DSS model of colitis and the disease modifying effect is comparable to anti-mouse TNFalpha treatment in this model.", 
    "15": "The management of acute infarction often necessitates a network of organisation between different centres, thus making it the object of an evaluation of professional practices (EPP). We report the experience in the Franche Comt\u00e9 province of an EPP at a regional level in the management of infarction.", 
    "16": "All of the patients admitted to 10 of the 11 centres in the region were included in a prospective survey. Quality indicators for acute and chronic care were defined, as well as scores, on the basis of use of treatments specified in guidelines.", 
    "17": "Between May 2005 and May 2006, 1,170 patients were admitted. The patients' risk levels and quality scores were calculated. The rate of use of the quality indicators was higher in our survey than that observed in all of the published studies, except for the use of betablockers. The quality of care could therefore be considered as highly satisfactory. Comparison between the centres revealed some differences. Even after adjustment for the risk score on admission, the quality score for acute care was related to mortality at 1 month.", 
    "18": "An EPP is possible for the management of infarction, on a regional scale such as in the province of Franche Comt\u00e9. The acute quality score turned out to be an independent factor for mortality. The indicators showed that the quality of care was highly satisfactory, even though more progress could be made in the prescription of betablockers.", 
    "19": "A substantial proportion of patients with heart failure have a normal ejection fraction and diastolic dysfunction. However, there are few data available to guide the therapy of these patients. The effects of statins on cardiac remodeling are well documented in animal models and it is reported that statin therapy revealed a survival benefit in patients with diastolic heart failure (DHF). However, the exact mechanisms of statins possibly explaining the decreased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with DHF have not been elucidated.", 
    "20": "We used 8-week-old male C57BL/6J mice, in which angiotensin II was subcutaneously infused for 4 weeks to mimic cardiac remodeling and fibrosis. They were treated with either normal saline or pravastatin in daily doses, which did not lower the serum cholesterol levels and blood pressure.", 
    "21": "Pravastatin improved diastolic dysfunction in angiotensin II-induced hypertensive mice, which was associated with the amelioration of left ventricular hypertrophy and remodeling. However, statin treatment showed no effect on the increased systolic blood pressure or cholesterol levels by angiotensin II infusion. The cardioprotective effects of pravastatin were closely associated with the downregulation of collagen I, transforming growth factor-beta, matrix metalloproteinases-2 and -3, atrial natriuretic factor, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, ROCK1 gene expression, and the upregulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene expression.", 
    "22": "The beneficial effects of pravastatin on DHF and structural remodeling are through cholesterol- independent mechanism of statins or \"pleiotropic\" effects of statins involving improving or restoring endothelial function and decreasing vascular inflammation. These findings suggest the potential involvement of ROCK1. Thus, treatment with pravastatin might be beneficial in patients with DHF.", 
    "23": "Present study was designed to investigate modulation of experimental dementia by Pitavastatin and donepezil. Learning and memory of the swiss albino mice were studied on Morris water-maze. Celecoxib orally (p.o.)/Streptozotocin (STZ) intracerebroventricular administrations were used to induce experimental dementia. Brain acetyl cholinesterase activity was measured by EllMann's method to assess cholinergic activity of the brain. Brain thio barbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) levels and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels were measured by Ohokawa's and Beutler's method respectively, to assess total oxidative stress in brain. Total serum cholesterol level was measured by Allain's method. Celecoxib/STZ treatments produced a significant loss of learning and memory. Pitavastatin/Donepezil successfully attenuated this Celecoxib/STZ induced dementia. Higher levels of brain acetyl-cholinesterase (AChE) activity, TBARS and lower level of GSH were observed in Celecoxib/STZ treated animals, which were significantly attenuated by Donepezil. Pitavastatin also attenuated the Celecoxib/STZ induced high levels of TBARS & low levels of GSH without effecting AChE activity and total serum cholesterol levels. Celecoxib induced dementia noted in the present study may be attributed to its stimulatory effect on amyloid beta-42, brain AChE activity, and oxidative stress. Sub-diabetogenic STZ induced memory deficits closely related to Alzheimer's disease. Reversal of Celecoxib/STZ induced memory deficits by Pitavastatin may be due to its antioxidative, anti beta amyloid aggregatory property, and by Donepezil, due to its anticholinesterase and neuroprotective actions.", 
    "24": "Historically, the etiological link between hypercholesterolemia and stroke has been less clear than for coronary heart disease. The lack of association between cholesterol levels and stroke in most epidemiological and observational studies has brought about this controversy. Many recent, long-term clinical studies have confirmed that statin therapy results in a reduced risk of strokes, even in so-called \"normocholesterolemic\" patients. The magnitude of the effect is great. A large-scale analysis of more than 90,000 individuals showed that every 10% reduction in the concentration of LDL-cholesterol reduces the risk of stroke by 15.6%. The positive effect of statins on stroke depends mainly on LDL cholesterol reduction, but other non-lipid mechanisms, so-called \"pleiotropic\" effects, have been shown to play a role. This review seeks to summarize the role of statins in stroke prevention. Despite the fact that our understanding of the benefits of statins in stroke prevention is still evolving, we find marked room for improvement in stroke risk factor management. Internists must face this challenge and integrate this new knowledge into their daily clinical practice.", 
    "25": "A selective, rapid and sensitive ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method was developed for the quantitative determination of lovastatin in human plasma and its application in a pharmacokinetic study. With mycophenolate mofetil as internal standard, sample pretreatment involved a one-step extraction with tert-butyl methyl ether of 0.2 ml plasma. The analysis was carried out on an ACQUITY UPLCTM BEH C18 column (50 mm x 2.1 mm, i.d., 1.7 microm) with flow rate of 0.35 ml/min. The mobile phase was 20% water and 80% acetonitrile (v/v). The detection was performed on a triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode via electrospray ionization (ESI). Linear calibration curves were obtained in the concentration range of 0.08-24.50 ng/ml, with a lower limit of quantification of 0.08 ng/ml. The intra- and inter-day precision (RSD) values were below 15% and accuracy (RE) was -7.6 to 9.3% at all QC levels. The method was applicable to clinical pharmacokinetic study of lovastatin in healthy volunteers following oral administration.", 
    "26": "Patients with diabetes are often treated with a statin for hyperlipidaemia and an ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitor or angiotensin receptor antagonist for hypertension or albuminuria. These drugs may also exert beneficial metabolic effects, causing improved glucose tolerance in patients. Gender-related differences have also been observed in the clinical responsiveness to these drugs, but the mechanism behind this is unclear. In the present study, we have investigated whether these drugs and the fatty acid palmitate influence the pancreatic microcirculation, thereby having an impact on insulin secretion and glycaemia in vivo, in spontaneously diabetic male and female Goto-Kakizaki rats. In male rats, pancreatic IBF (islet blood flow) and total PBF (pancreatic blood flow) were increased significantly by pravastatin, captopril and irbesartan. Serum insulin levels were increased by pravastatin and captopril. Palmitate suppressed pancreatic IBF and increased blood glucose. In female animals, pancreatic IBF was stimulated by captopril, candesartan and irbesartan. Total PBF was increased by captopril, candesartan and irbesartan, and by pravastatin. Palmitate suppressed pancreatic IBF and serum insulin secretion. In conclusion, the present study lends support to the view that a local pancreatic RAS (renin-angiotensin system) and pravastatin may be selectively influencing the pancreatic microcirculation and therefore affecting insulin secretion and glycaemia. NEFAs (non-esterified fatty acids) impaired pancreatic IBF, suppressed insulin secretion and increased blood glucose. Substantial gender-related differences in the vascular and metabolic responses to these drugs prevail in this animal model of diabetes.", 
    "27": "A fast and sensitive ultra-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) method was developed for the determination of lovastatin in human plasma. With simvastatin as internal standard, sample pretreatment involved one-step extraction with n-hexane-methylene dichloride-isopropanol (20:10:1, v/v/v) of 0.5 mL plasma. Chromatographic separation was carried out on an Acquity UPLC BEH C(18) column with mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile-water (containing 5 mmol/L ammonium acetate; 85:15, v/v) at a flow-rate of 0.35 mL/min. The detection was performed on a triple-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) via electrospray ionization source with positive mode. The analysis time was shorter than 1.7 min per sample. The standard curve was linear (r2>or=0.99) over the concentration range 0.025-50.0 ng/mL with a lower limit of quantification of 0.025 ng/mL. The intra- and inter-day precision values were below 11% and the accuracy (relative error) was within 6.0% at three quality control levels. This is the first method of MS with MRM coupled to UPLC for the determination of lovastatin, which showed great advantages of high sensitivity, selectivity and high sample throughput. It was fully validated and successfully applied to the pharmacokinetic study of lovastatin tablets in healthy Chinese male volunteers after oral administration.", 
    "28": "It has been reported that hypertension carries a greater risk of myocardial infarction (MI) in South Asians living in the UK than in the indigenous British population. This has been attributed to some specifically Asian susceptibility factor.", 
    "29": "Using a longitudinal approach, we investigated the relationship between coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors amongst hypertension patients attending Sandwell and City Hospitals, and the onset of cardiovascular events over a 5-year follow-up period.", 
    "30": "A total of 350 Caucasian (83.7% male) and 104 South Asian (66.3% male) patients with hypertension [age 63.7 (7.6) years and 57.1 (11.1) years respectively, P < 0.001] were followed-up for a mean (SD) period of 64.7(12.1) months. There were 11 (6.4/1000 patient years) cases of MI in Caucasian patients vs. 11 (17.8/1000 patient years) in South Asians, with event-free survival times being significantly lower amongst South Asians (log-rank test P = 0.04). The prevalence of diabetes mellitus was 22.9% higher amongst South Asians (P < 0.001), whilst mean serum cholesterol and fasting triglyceride levels were higher amongst Caucasians (P = 0.001). There were no ethnic differences in HDL cholesterol concentrations, the use of tobacco, statin therapy or anti-platelet therapies (all P = NS), or in composite endpoint (MI, angina, peripheral vascular disease, stroke, revascularization or death; P = 0.74). On Cox regression analysis of all independent cardiovascular risk variables, associated treatments and ethnicity, MI risk was associated with diabetes mellitus (odds ratio 3.77, 95%CI 1.55-9.15, P = 0.003) but not ethnicity per se (P = 0.26).", 
    "31": "Increased risk of MI in hypertensive South Asians in the United Kingdom appears to be the result of a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus. Further work is required to understand the pathophysiological basis with which diabetes increases CHD risk in this ethnic group.", 
    "32": "Obliterative bronchiolitis (OB), the major cause of chronic lung allograft dysfunction, is characterized by airway neutrophilia, inflammation, and remodeling, with progressive fibroproliferation and obliteration of small airways that ultimately leads to patient death. Statins have potential anti-inflammatory effects and have been demonstrated to confer a survival advantage in lung transplant patients. We postulated that the beneficial effects of simvastatin in lung transplantation are in part due to inhibition of the epithelial production of key mediators of neutrophil chemotaxis, inflammation, and airway remodeling. Our objective was to assess the effect of simvastatin on a unique population of primary bronchial epithelial cells (PBECs) derived from stable lung allografts, with specific reference to airway neutrophilia and remodeling. PBEC cultures were stimulated with IL-17 or transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, with and without simvastatin. Supernatant levels of factors critical to driving airway neutrophilia and remodeling were measured. IL-17 upregulated IL-8, IL-6, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), and VEGF, whereas TGF-beta increased IL-6, GM-CSF, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, and MMP-9. Simvastatin attenuated effects of both IL-17 and TGF-beta. We have demonstrated the ability of simvastatin to attenuate release of airway neutrophilic and remodeling mediators and to inhibit their upregulation by TGF-beta and IL-17. These data illustrate the potential of simvastatin to alleviate neutrophilic airway inflammation and remodeling in the transplanted lung and may have additional relevance to other neutrophilic airway conditions, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.", 
    "33": "We previously reported that 10 mg/day of simvastatin significantly reduced clinical scores of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in patients with active RA with hypercholesterolemia. We have also reported that a certain pharmacological concentration of simvastatin, i.e., 0.05-0.1 microM, inhibits the production of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and IL-8 and the cell proliferation induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) derived from patients with RA in vitro. We investigated other effects of simvastatin on FLS from the standpoint of cell viability and apoptosis.", 
    "34": "RA FLS were cultured with or without 0.05-50 microM simvastatin for 48 h. Cell viability was determined using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Apoptosis was measured by flow cytometric analysis using propidium iodide and annexin-V. Caspase-3 and -9 activities were analyzed by colorimetric assays.", 
    "35": "High concentrations of simvastatin, i.e., 1.0-50 microM, reduced cell viability and induced prominent apoptosis in FLS in a dose-dependent manner. The apoptosis induced by simvastatin was caspase-3- and caspase-9-dependent. These effects were completely reversed in the presence of mevalonic acid or geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate, but not in the presence of farnesyl-pyrophosphate. Further, a geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor and a RhoA kinase inhibitor mimicked the effect of simvastatin.", 
    "36": "These data, together with our previous report, suggest that low (pharmacological range) and high concentrations of simvastatin affect FLS differently: (1) at a low concentration, it inhibits IL-6 and IL-8 production and the cell proliferation of FLS induced by TNF-alpha (2) at high concentrations, it induces apoptosis in FLS. Understanding this dose-dependent biphasic effect of simvastatin may prove important for its clinical applications in the treatment of RA.", 
    "37": "To determine whether use of oral bisphosphonates is associated with an increased risk of aseptic osteonecrosis (AON) among a cohort of elderly cardiovascular patients.", 
    "38": "We conducted a nested case-control study within a previously defined cardiovascular cohort of elderly Quebec patients using linked administrative health databases. Cases were defined as those with the diagnosis of hospitalization secondary to AON at a nonspecified site. For each case, 10 controls were randomly selected and matched to the cases by age, calendar time, and length of followup. The main outcome measure was the risk ratio (RR) of AON among ever-users of oral bisphosphonates compared to that among nonusers. As a quality measure, RR for AON among users of statin and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I) compared to nonusers were also calculated.", 
    "39": "The initial cohort consisted of 87,837 subjects. In the primary analysis, the adjusted RR for AON among bisphosphonate users was 2.87 (95% CI 1.71-5.05). The adjusted RR for alendronate, etidronate, and risedronate were 2.87 (95% CI 1.46-5.67), 2.43 (95% CI 1.05-5.62), and 3.34 (95% CI 1.04-10.67), respectively. There were no significant differences in RR for AON among current users (most recent drug exposure within 90 days of diagnosis) and past users (drug exposure between 91 and 365 days before diagnosis) of bisphosphonates. The adjusted RR for both statins and ACE-I were 0.79 (95% CI 0.49-1.07) and 1.16 (95% CI 0.79-1.70), respectively.",

In this population, 4.6% of women were taking both HT and LLA (fibrate for 2.4% and statin for 2.2%). In non-LLA-treated women, current HT was associated with lower total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) compared to never users. Women treated with LLA also had lower total cholesterol, LDL-C, and non-HDL-C compared to non-LLA users, whereas triglyceride levels were the highest in statin users and lowest in fibrate users. Fibrate use was associated with a more favorable lipid pattern than statin treatment independently of HT use. In women without coronary heart disease or diabetes, HT, statin or fibrate use were associated with lower LDL-C level risk based on National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.67 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.53-0.85), 0.38 (95% CI = 0.29-0.47), and 0.32 (95% CI = 0.25-0.42), respectively) with a possible interaction between fibrate and HT (0.18 (95% CI = 0.10-0.30)).",

Plasma samples were treated by acetonitrile (ACN) addition for protein precipitation (PP) and subsequent two-step liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) in 96-deepwell plates, using methyl t-butyl ether (MTBE) as the organic solvent. ACN addition step was proven to enhance method sensitivity, as well as producing cleaner samples for injection. Lovastatin (LV) and lovastatin acid (LVA) were used as internal standards (IS) for SV and SVA quantification respectively. A relatively small plasma volume (300 microL) was employed and all procedure liquid transfer steps were performed automatically, by the use of robotic liquid handling workstations. Both electrospray (ESI) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) sources were applied and compared for LC-MS/MS sample analysis, with ESI proven to be more sensitive for the specific analytes. Polarity switch (from negative to positive ionization mode) was performed during the same analytical run, so as for the simultaneous SV and SVA determination to be possible. The method had a short sample preparation time, as well as a chromatographic run time of just 1.9 min, the shortest so far reported for SV determination. It was validated and fulfilled all preset criteria for sensitivity, specificity, linearity (0.100-40.0 ng/mL), inter- and intra-accuracy and precision for both molecules. The proposed method was applied to the rapid and reliable simultaneous determination of SV and SVA in a bioequivalence study, after per os administration of a SV tablet (80 mg).",

The present study tested the capacity of statins to activate NOS in RBCs and subsequently to modulate RBC deformability in vitro. Blood samples of healthy young volunteers were incubated with or without rosuvastatin. Afterwards RBC-NOS activity and RBC deformability were determined. Rosuvastatin incubation significantly increased NOS phosphorylation, NOS dependent NO-formation, and RBC deformability.

    "86": "Diabetes mellitus is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, even in the presence of intensive glycemic control. Substantial clinical and experimental evidence suggest that both diabetes and insulin resistance cause a combination of endothelial dysfunctions, which may diminish the anti-atherogenic role of the vascular endothelium. Both insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction appear to precede the development of overt hyperglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes. Therefore, in patients with diabetes or insulin resistance, endothelial dysfunction may be a critical early target for preventing atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. Microalbuminuria is now considered to be an atherosclerotic risk factor and predicts future cardiovascular disease risk in diabetic patients, in elderly patients, as well as in the general population. It has been implicated as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease and premature cardiovascular mortality for patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, as well as for patients with essential hypertension. A complete biochemical understanding of the mechanisms by which hyperglycemia causes vascular functional and structural changes associated with the diabetic milieu still eludes us. In recent years, the numerous biochemical and metabolic pathways postulated to have a causal role in the pathogenesis of diabetic vascular disease have been distilled into several unifying hypotheses. The role of chronic hyperglycemia in the development of diabetic microvascular complications and in neuropathy has been clearly established. However, the biochemical or cellular links between elevated blood glucose levels, and the vascular lesions remain incompletely understood. A number of trials have demonstrated that statins therapy as well as angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors is associated with improvements in endothelial function in diabetes. Although antioxidants provide short-term improvement of endothelial function in humans, all studies of the effectiveness of preventive antioxidant therapy have been disappointing. Control of hyperglycemia thus remains the best way to improve endothelial function and to prevent atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular complications of diabetes.

Statins have been approved and effectively used to control hypercholesterolemia in clinical setting. Recent study showed statin's antitumor activity and suggested a potential role for prevention of human cancers. In this study, we did cell viability, DNA fragmentation, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assays to evaluate the action of statins on prostate cancer cells and used Western blotting and RhoA activation assay to investigate the underlying molecular mechanism of action. Our data showed that lovastatin and simvastatin effectively decreased cell viability in three prostate cancer cell lines (PC3, DU145, and LnCap) by inducing apoptosis and cell growth arrest at G(1) phase. Both lovastatin and simvastatin induced activation of caspase-8, caspase-3, and, to a lesser extent, caspase-9. Both statins suppressed expression of Rb, phosphorylated Rb, cyclin D1, cyclin D3, CDK4, and CDK6, but induced p21 and p27 expression in prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, lovastatin and simvastatin suppressed RhoA activation and c-JUN expression, but not cyclooxygenase-2 expression. Our data showed that the antitumor activity of statins is due to induction of apoptosis and cell growth arrest. The underlying molecular mechanism of statin's action is mediated through inactivation of RhoA, which in turn induces caspase enzymatic activity and/or G(1) cell cycle. Future studies should focus on examining statins and other apoptosis-inducing drugs (e.g., cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors or curcumin) together to assess their efficacy in prevention of prostate cancer.",

Many clinical trials have proven that plant sterol and stanol esters can effectively decrease high serum total and LDL cholesterol. They reduce the intestinal absorption of cholesterol by decreasing the incorporation of dietary and biliary cholesterol into micelles displacing cholesterol from these micelles. They also increase LDL receptor activity on liver cells causing a higher uptake of LDL cholesterol and thus decreasing the serum LDL cholesterol concentration. Animal studies have indicated that plant sterols and stanols may also lower atherosclerotic lesions development. However, the evidence from human studies to confirm this is still lacking. Anyhow, plant sterol and stanol esters can be considered as an effective and safe cholesterol-lowering functional food ingredient.

Numerous studies in nonsurgical cardiovascular patients have found reduced rates of AF with statins. In patients who have undergone CABG, several observational studies have also documented benefit. One randomized controlled trial reported a significant reduction in the risk of POAF and reduced length of hospital stay in patients given preoperative atorvastatin beginning 7 days before surgery. Ongoing research suggests that statins may reduce the risk of AF through pleiotropic effects independent of cholesterol lowering such as reductions in inflammation, oxidative damage, neurohormonal activation, and thrombosis.",

    "117": "HbA(1c) was above the target level in 71.4%. A positive family history of early CVD and/or diabetes was found in 33% of participants. LDL-cholesterol was >2.6 mmol/l in 34.5% and HDL-cholesterol was <1.1 mmol/l in 6.9% of participants. Blood pressure was above the 90th percentile by age, sex and height in 7% and above the 95th percentile in 4% of participants. Four per cent of participants were obese, 3% of those >or=12 years of age reported smoking and 1% of all participants had persistent microalbuminuria. Only 0.2% of the patients were receiving statin and 0.3% anti-hypertensive treatments. Dietary habits and physical activity level were evaluated in some patients. Almost all had higher intake of dietary fat and lower intake of fibre than recommended. A large part was less active and watched more TV than recommended.",

    "119": "We are currently witnesses to and authors of a paradigm shift in neuropathology. While classical acute and chronic neuroinflammatory diseases such as meningitis or multiple sclerosis (MS) present aspects of neurodegeneration, the disease course of progressive degenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), or stroke-mediated neuronal deficit are demonstrably affected by inflammation. These insights have immediate consequences both for research methods and for the development of novel, more efficient therapies for these diseases. In this review, we analyze the inflammatory and degenerative pathological mechanisms in the brain with particular emphasis on the classical chronic inflammatory disease MS. We demonstrate that the latest pathological considerations not only require the application of advanced research technologies to investigate new pathomechanistic pathways, but also affect the investigation, development, and monitoring of novel potential therapeutic tools.", 
    "120": "Perioperative stroke is an uncommon event associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Neurologists are often called to assess potential stroke risk factors to advice on prophylactic medical or surgical measures, which could decrease risk of this dreaded complication.", 
    "121": "The decision to continue or just temporarily hold antiplatelet medications perioperatively in patients with known risk factors depends on the type of surgery. If on oral anticoagulation, the majority of patients should be considered for bridging therapy with heparin or low-molecular-weight-heparin. If an acute perioperative stroke occurs and standard intravenous rt-PA (Alteplase) is contraindicated, a neurointerventional procedure should be considered. Some studies demonstrate that the concept of neuroprotection, ie, using statin and beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists, in the perioperative setting could be beneficial. Carotid stenosis is associated with an increased risk of stroke, however, there is no evidence that the increased risk is sufficient to mandate prophylactic carotid endarterectomy before general surgical procedures. When both coronary and extracranial carotid artery stenoses exist, symptomatic lesions should be treated first in a staged procedure. The approach to asymptomatic patients should depend on the degree of the stenosis.", 
    "122": "Perioperative stroke can be a serious complication. Hence, neurologists should assess the patient's risk factors and advice on possible prophylaxis and management of antiplatelet or anticoagulation medications. In this review, we provide several algorithms and recommendations to prevent and treat perioperative stroke.", 
    "123": "Perioperative beta-blockade and statin therapy have been advocated to reduce cardiac risk of noncardiac surgery. This review evaluates recent articles published on the cardioprotective effects of perioperative therapy with these medications.", 
    "124": "Initial studies evaluating beta-blocker therapy during the perioperative period suggested that beta-blockers may be beneficial in reducing cardiac deaths and myocardial infarctions. Later studies and recent meta-analyses, however, are less favorable and suggest that beta-blockers may be associated with increased incidence of bradycardia and hypotension. One randomized trial and several cohort studies have found a significant reduction in cardiovascular complications with perioperative statin therapy. Additionally, statin withdrawal is associated with increased postoperative cardiac risk.", 
    "125": "Based upon the available evidence and guidelines, patients currently taking beta-blockers should continue these agents. Patients undergoing vascular surgery who are at high cardiac risk should also take beta-blockers. The question remains regarding the best protocol to initiate perioperative beta-blockade. Statins should be continued in patients already taking these agents prior to surgery. The optimal duration and time of initiation of statin therapy remains unclear.", 
    "126": "The beneficial effect achieved by the treatment of endothelial dysfunction in chronic cardiovascular diseases is already an evidence belonging to the basic treatment of the disease. Given the fact that the vascular system is uniform and consubstantial both physiologically, pathophysiologically and in terms of therapy, and that it plays a key role in age-related macular degeneration (AMD)--a disease leading to tragic loss of vision with its etiology and therapy being unknown--endothelial dysfunction should be treated. The pleiotropic effects of ACE-inhibitors, AR-blockers and statins help to restitute the balance between vasodilators and vasoconstrictors in endothelial dysfunction caused by oxidative stress, the balance of growth factors and their inhibitors, pro- and anti-inflammatory substances and prothrombotic and fibrinolytic factors, inhibit the formation of oxidative stress and its harmful effects; while aspirin with its pleiotropic effects acting as an antiaggregation substance on platelets helps to set the endothelial layer back to its normal balance regarding its vasodilating, antithrombotic, antiadhesive and anti-inflammatory functions; trimetazidine as an adjuvant agent helps to normalize, to restore the disturbed metabolism of the retinal tissue functioning insufficiently, in the end. For the above reasons it is suggested that, as a part of long term primary and/or secondary prevention, the following groups of patients with AMD receive--taking into consideration all possible side effects--ACE-inhibitor and/or AR blocker and statin and aspirin treatment, and trimetazidine as adjuvant medicine 1. those without maculopathy but being above the age of 50 and having risk factors inducing endothelial dysfunction; 2. those, who already developed AMD in one eye as a prevention in the second, unaffected eye; and 3. those patients who developed AMD in both eyes in order to ameliorate or merely slow the progression of the disease. Besides, it is advisory to eliminate AMD risk factors inducing oxidative stress with consecutive endothelial dysfunction.", 
    "127": "Statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methlglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, are commonly prescribed for patients who have hyperlipidemia. Statins were first approved in 1987. Statin therapy is well documented to reduce serum low-density lipoprotein levels, incidence of cardiovascular events, and mortality. Although statin therapy is well tolerated, serious adverse affects have been reported, including neuromuscular and hepatic complications. Myopathy is particularly concerning because of the potential for rhabdomyolysis and death. Recently, peripheral neuropathy also has been identified as a possible complication. The incidence of neuromuscular complications is expected to increase with the increased number of people using statin therapy. Clinicians should be aware of the potential neuromuscular complications. This article reviews epidemiology, possible mechanisms, risk factors, and management of statin-associated neuromuscular complications.", 
    "128": "Cerebral ischaemic stroke is frequently a relapsing, if not chronic, disease. Its incidence is age-dependent, and with the ageing of society the need for effective therapies increases. This review considers current and alternative hypotheses underlying secondary prevention of stroke. Currently, secondary stroke prevention is widely practiced with aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid), a drug that has been in use for more than 100 years. Newer drugs such as ticlopidine and clopidogrel have subsequently been developed, but their efficacy barely surpasses that of aspirin. Other drugs used in secondary stroke prevention include HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and antihypertensive agents. The endovascular paradigm has shaped the thinking of secondary stroke prevention, and aspirin, ticlopidine and clopidogrel are known as 'platelet inhibitors'; however, their pharmacological and clinical effects are not fully explained within the platelet paradigm. Moreover, in recent years, reduction of stroke incidence has also been observed with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, regardless of their lipid-lowering effects. Hence, current understanding needs to be supplemented by considering mechanisms beyond platelet inhibition. Evidence has shown that aspirin, ticlopidine and clopidogrel share neuroprotective properties not explained by the platelet paradigm and that are reminiscent of a preconditioning effect. This neuroprotective mechanism is also shared with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.", 
    "129": "A reversed-phase liquid chromatographic (LC) method was developed and validated for the simultaneous determination of ezetimibe and simvastatin in pharmaceutical dosage forms. The LC method was carried out on a Synergi fusion C18 column (150 mm x 4.6 mm id) maintained at 45 degrees C. The mobile phase consisted of phosphate buffer 0.03 M, pH 4.5-acetonitrile (35 + 65, v/v) run at a flow rate of 0.6 mL/min, and detection was made using a photodiode array detector at 234 nm. The chromatographic separation was obtained within 15.0 min, and calibration graphs were linear in the concentration range of 0.5-200 microg/mL. Validation parameters such as specificity, linearity, precision, accuracy, and robustness were evaluated, giving results within the acceptable range for both compounds. Moreover, the proposed method was successfully applied for the routine quality control analysis of pharmaceutical products.", 
    "130": "The purpose of this work was to develop a sensitive, selective, and validated stability-indicating high-performance liquid chromatographic (LC) assay of atorvastatin (ATV) in bulk drug and tablet form. ATV was subjected to different stress conditions, including UV light, oxidation, acid-base hydrolysis, and temperature. ATV and its degradation products were analyzed on an Agilent Zorbax XDB C18 column using isocratic elution with acetonitrile-0.02 M sodium acetate, pH 4.2 (45 + 55, v/v) for 25 min. The samples were monitored with fluorescence (FL) detection at 282 nm (excitation)/400 nm (emission). The response ratio of FL to UV detection (at 247 nm) for ATV was 1.66. The method showed good resolution of ATV from its decomposition products. The photodegradation products were separated by silica gel thin-layer chromatography using double development with ethyl acetate-n-hexane-glacial acetic acid-methanol (40 + 55 + 0.5 + 4.5, v/v/v/v) followed by (39 + 55 + 0.5 + 5.5, v/v/v/v), and confirmed by LC-FL analysis. The FL response was linear over the investigated range for ATV. The linear range was 10-1200 ng/injection, and the limit of quantitation was 2.0 ng/injection.", 
    "131": "A simple, precise, and rapid stability-indicating reversed-phase column liquid chromatographic (RP-LC) method has been developed and subsequently validated for simultaneous estimation of atorvastatin (ATV) and ezetimibe (EZE) from their combination drug product. The proposed RP-LC method utilizes a LiChrospher 100 C18, 5 microm, 250 x 4.0 mm id column at ambient temperature; the optimum mobile phase consists of acetonitrile-water-methanol (45 + 40 + 15, v/v/v) with apparent pH adjusted to 4.0 +/- 0.1; mobile phase flow rate of 1.0 mL/min; and UV detection at 250 nm. ATV, EZE, and their combination drug product were exposed to thermal, photolytic, hydrolytic, and oxidative stress conditions, and the stressed samples were analyzed by the proposed method. There were no other coeluting, interfering peaks from excipients, impurities, or degradation products due to variable stress conditions, and the method is specific for the estimation of ATV and EZE in the presence of degradation products. The response was linear over the concentration range of 1-80 microg/mL for ATV and EZE. The mean recoveries were 99.27 and 98.5% for ATV and EZE, respectively. The intermediate precision data were obtained under different experimental conditions, and the calculated value of the coefficient of variation was found to be less than the critical value. The proposed method can be useful in the quality control of bulk manufacturing and pharmaceutical dosage forms.",

The API-4000 LC-MS/MS was operated under the multiple reaction-monitoring mode (MRM) using the electro spray ionization technique. The assay procedure involved direct precipitation of RST and IS from plasma with acetonitrile. Sample preparation with this method yielded clean extracts and consistent recoveries: 91.39% for RST and 99.28% for IS. The total chromatographic run time was 3.5 min and the elution of RST and IS occurred at 2.5 and 3.1 min, respectively; this was achieved with a mobile phase consisting of 0.05 mol/L formic acid: acetonitrile (20:80, v/v) at a flow rate of 0.50 ml/min on an Inertsil ODS-3 column (4.6 x 100 mm, 3.0 microm). The developed method was validated in human plasma with a limit of quantitation of 0.05 ng/ml. A linear response function was established for the range of concentrations of 0.05 to 50.0 ng/ml with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.999. The inter- and intra-day precision in the measurement of RST quality control (QC) samples at 0.05, 0.15, 25 and 40 ng/ml were in the range of 6.55 to 11.40% relative standard deviation (RSD) and 1.76 to 11.17% RSD, respectively. Accuracy in the measurement of QC samples for RST was in the range of 95.02 to 101.37% of the nominal values. RST was stable in the battery of stability studies viz., bench-top, auto-sampler and freeze-thaw cycles. The stability of RST was established for 1 month at -80 degrees C. The application of the assay to a clinical study confirmed the utility of the assay to derive human pharmacokinetic parameters.",

Initial effect of lovastatin appeared in decreasing chilomicrone content in both groups of patients. A distinct trend towards restoration of processes converting apoA-containing LP being accompanied by normalization of function of the peripheral lipoprotein lipase bound form was observed.

For example, the total area under the plasma-concentration time curve to the last measured time, 24 h, in plasma (AUC(0-24) (h)) of verapamil increased significantly by 42.8%. Thus, the relative bioavailability increased by the same magnitude with atorvastatin. Although the AUC(0-24) (h) of norverapamil was not significantly different between two groups of humans, the AUC(0-24) (h, norverapamil)/ AUC(0-24) (h, verapamil) ratio was significantly reduced (27.5% decrease) with atorvastatin.",

Fibrates and statins were used by 3.5 and 6.8%, respectively. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that older age, longer diabetes duration, central adiposity, increased height, higher fasting serum glucose, albuminuria and aboriginality were significant independent positive predictors of prevalent neuropathy, while systolic blood pressure and fibrate use (odds ratio 0.30, 95% CI 0.10-0.86; p=0.025) were negatively associated.

    "149": "Data analysis revealed that statins exert little effect on leucocyte gene expression. Statin-responsive genes included several immune response genes and the cholesterol efflux transporter (ABCA1). Rosuvastatin appeared to moderately downregulate expression of the genes encoding the inflammatory response proteins orosomucoid (ORM1) and interleukin 18 receptor accessory protein (IL18RAP). LPS-infusion induced a pronounced response of the leucocyte transcriptome, notably affecting transcripts related to immune regulation, cell proliferation and motility. While the majority of LPS-induced changes were not modulated by either statin, few select genes responded differently after statin treatment, such as the genes encoding the CD32 receptor (FCGR2A) or the protein geranylgeranyltransferase 1b subunit (PGGT1B).",

Simvastatin also modulated the expression of several transcription factors essential for inflammation: NF-kappaB relA/p65 subunit and ets-1 were downregulated, and an atheroprotective transcription factor KLF-2 was upregulated. The effects of simvastatin on MCP-1 and TF could be mimicked by KLF-2 overexpression using lentiviral gene transfer.",

HUVECs were incubated for 14 days in either low (5 mM) or high (20 mM) glucose concentrations, or intermittent high and low glucose on a daily basis. Constant high glucose levels increased p47-phox, p67-phox, and p22-phox expression [components of the Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate [NAD(P)H] oxidase complex]; endothelial nitric oxide synthase, nitric oxide, and O(2)(-) production; nitrotyrosine, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, and caspase-3 expression; and reduced Bcl-2 expression. These effects were significantly greater under intermittent compared to constant high/low glucose conditions. The effect of rosuvastatin (1 microM) in the presence or absence of mevalonate (200 microM) was evaluated in the cells under both constant and intermittent glucose conditions. Rosuvastatin almost normalized all these parameters. These effects of rosuvastatin were prevented when mevalonate was also added, demonstrating the link to inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase. These data suggest that rosuvastatin has the potential to prevent damage to and apoptosis of HUVECs induced by high glucose exposure, by reducing oxidative stress. The action of rosuvastatin on antioxidant pathways is related to the inhibition of the overexpression of components of NAD(P)H oxidase induced by the two conditions of high glucose.",

Apolipoprotein B kinetics were assessed at baseline and at the end of the intervention using a primed constant infusion of [5,5,5-D(3)]-l-leucine for 12 hours in the fed state. Fenofibrate significantly decreased plasma TG levels with no significant change in plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and apo B levels. On the other hand, atorvastatin significantly reduced plasma levels of TG, LDL-C, and apo B. After treatment with fenofibrate, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) apo B-100 pool size (PS) was decreased because of an increase in the fractional catabolic rate (FCR) of VLDL apo B-100. No significant change was observed in the kinetics of LDL apo B-100. Moreover, fenofibrate significantly decreased TG-rich lipoprotein (TRL) apo B-48 PS because of a significant increase in TRL apo B-48 FCR. After treatment with atorvastatin, VLDL and IDL apo B-100 PSs were significantly decreased because of significant elevations in the FCR of these subfractions. Low-density lipoprotein apo B-100 PS was significantly lowered because of a tendency toward decreased LDL apo B-100 production rate (PR). Finally, atorvastatin reduced TRL apo B-48 PS because of a significant decrease in the PR of this subfraction. These results indicate that fenofibrate increases TRL apo B-48 as well as VLDL apo B-100 clearance in men with type 2 diabetes mellitus with marked hypertriglyceridemia, whereas atorvastatin increases both VLDL and IDL apo B-100 clearance and decreases TRL apo B-48 and LDL apo B-100 PR.",

A second assessment of at-rest cerebral blood flow and cerebrovascular reactivity was performed 4 or more months (mean 6 months) after the start of statin administration. We used acetazolamide (1 g) as the vasodilator. The region of interest was the middle cerebral artery territory on a 3-dimensional stereotaxic region of interest template.", 
    "171": "Statin administration did not significantly affect the regional cerebral blood flow at rest. Before statin treatment, the patients' vasoreactivity, determined by the triple-injection technetium 99m-ethylcysteinate dimer method, demonstrated delayed, poor, or near-normal response patterns. Statin treatment improved vasoreactivity in all patients. Their mean serum total cholesterol level before statin administration was 200 mg/dL (range 187-256 mg/dL). Statin treatment significantly reduced their mean serum total cholesterol to 180 mg/dL (range 128-220 mg/dL) (P < .01).",

No radiosensitization of clonogenic cells by lovastatin could be demonstrated in both cells lines, but the colony-forming ability after lovastatin alone was decreased in FaDu cells.

The hyperandrogenemia associated with the syndrome is a result of excessive growth and steroidogenic activity of theca-interstitial tissues in response to various factors, including elevated gonadotropins, hyperinsulinemia, and oxidative stress. PCOS frequently coexists with other cardiovascular risk factors, such as dyslipidemia and systemic inflammation. Statins inhibit the synthesis of mevalonate, the key precursor to cholesterol biosynthesis, and reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Blockade of mevalonate production may also lead to decreased maturation of insulin receptors, inhibition of steroidogenesis (e.g., via limiting the amount of substrate: cholesterol), and alteration of signal transduction pathways that mediate cellular proliferation. The latter depend upon posttranslational modification of proteins (prenylation), a process mediated by mevalonate derivatives. Statins also have intrinsic antioxidant properties. Given the pleiotropic actions of statins, they are likely not only to improve the dyslipidemia associated with PCOS but may also exert other beneficial metabolic and endocrine effects.",

The introduction of these agents in clinical medicine has had a major impact and has changed the natural history of coronary artery disease in humans.

Extensive studies over the last few years have demonstrated that statins generate pro-apoptotic, growth inhibitory, and pro-differentiation responses on neoplastic cells of diverse origin. In addition, several cellular pathways activated by statins have been identified and key mechanisms involved in the generation of their antitumor effects have been characterized. Because of such in vitro effects, extensive efforts are underway to establish their utility in cancer prevention and their potential use in the treatment of certain malignancies, in combination with other agents.

The ATOR group demonstrated impaired microvessel relaxation to vascular endothelial growth factor (53% +/- 3% vs 70% +/- 7%, ATOR vs NORM at 10(-10) mol/L, P = .05) and fibroblast growth factor-2 (35% +/- 3% vs 57% +/- 5%, ATOR vs NORM at 10(-10) mol/L, P = .04). Baseline-adjusted myocardial perfusion in the ischemic circumflex territory was significantly reduced in the ATOR group (-0.29 +/- 0.10 mL/min/g vs NORM, P = .009). Phosphorylation of Akt was significantly increased in the ATOR group (+235% +/- 72%, P = .009 vs NORM), as was the myocardial expression of endostatin, an antiangiogenic protein (+51% +/- 9%, P < .001 vs NORM). Expression of vascular endothelial growth factor, Tie-2, fibroblast growth factor receptor-1, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase was similar in both groups.", 
    "233": "Atorvastatin supplementation is associated with impaired growth factor-mediated microvessel relaxation and a significant reduction in collateral-dependent perfusion. Chronic Akt activation, increased myocardial expression of endostatin, and impaired growth factor signaling may account for the diminished endogenous angiogenic response observed with atorvastatin treatment."
