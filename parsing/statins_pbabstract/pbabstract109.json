Cytokine-modulating therapeutic proteins (TPs) used in the treatment of inflammation or infection could reverse suppression, manifesting as TP-drug-drug interactions (TP-DDIs). A physiologically based pharmacokinetic model was used to quantitatively predict the impact of interleukin-6 (IL-6) on sensitive CYP3A4 substrates. Elevated simvastatin area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) in virtual rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, following 100 pg/ml of IL-6, was comparable to observed clinical data (59 vs. 58%). In virtual bone marrow transplant (BMT) patients, 500 pg/ml of IL-6 resulted in an increase in cyclosporine AUC, also in good agreement with the observed data (45 vs. 39%). In a different group of BMT patients treated with cyclosporine, the magnitude of interaction with IL-6 was underpredicted by threefold. The complexity of TP-DDIs highlights underlying pathophysiological factors to be considered, but these simulations provide valuable first steps toward predicting TP-DDI risk.",

The microbial source of lovastatin was assessed by testing the ability of fungi with higher isolation frequency in the Pu-erh tea samples to produce lovastatin on Czapek yeast extract agar (CYA). Lovastatin was not detected in any of the raw Pu-erh tea samples without storage but was found in almost all the ripe Pu-erh tea samples, with lovastatin contents ranging from 20.61 ng/gdw to 226.38 ng/gdw. After five years' storage, the lovastatin levels increased obviously in ripe Pu-erh tea samples and 55% of raw Pu-erh tea samples from 2007 were found to contain lovastatin with concentrations ranging between 28.41 ng/gdw and 228.61 ng/gdw. With increasing storage time, lovastatin concentration in ripe Pu-erh tea, and the occurrence and concentration of lovastatin for raw Pu-erh tea increased significantly. Three genera of fungi: Aspergillus, Penicillium and Trichoderma were often isolated from Pu-erh tea samples. A total of 40 strains from 3 fungal genera were selected to test their ability to produce lovastatin. Only 6 strains, Aspergillus tubingensis, Aspergillus wentii, Aspergillus fumigatus, Penicillium chrysogenum, Trichoderma asperellum and Trichoderma citrinoviride, were able to produce lovastatin reaching concentrations of 9.59 \u00b1 0.42 ng/g CYA, 2.33 \u00b1 0.21 ng/g CYA, 2.77 \u00b1 0.13 ng/g CYA, 3.36 \u00b1 0.69 ng/g CYA, 4.8 \u00b1 0.17 ng/g CYA, and 1.47 \u00b1 0.36 ng/g CYA respectively in Czapek yeast extract agar.", 
    "2": "Ageing is a progressive process that according to available knowledge cannot be effectively reversed, slowed or stopped. Here we propose a new anti-ageing approach that may lead to the design of effective therapeutic intervention. First, we hypothesize that the \"organ system\" oriented anti-ageing approach represents a better anti-ageing target than the \"whole body\" or \"cellular ageing\" concepts. The arterial system is the most suitable target, as it interconnects all the organs in the body, thus influencing them all. Second, we propose that an anti-ageing approach could be more successful in early than late ageing stages; middle-aged people seem to be the most appropriate candidates. Third, we believe that instead of searching for new medication, we should rely on already established medications with beneficial effects on the arterial wall. Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors and statins fulfill these criteria and are potential cornerstones of the new approach. The fourth hypothesis is based on the concept that in the early stages of arterial ageing only slight injury is present and therefore subtherapeutic, low-dose treatment would be effective. Fifth, we hypothesize that slight initial age-related arterial wall changes are reversible and could be corrected by a short-term (one month) treatment. Sixth, we hypothesize that the effects would be present for a certain period of time even after treatment termination. The listed assumptions combined represent the basis for a new, original anti-ageing approach - a subtherapeutic low-dose combination of a renin-angiotensin system inhibitor and a statin for one month (followed by approximately 6-12 months without treatment) could delay or even reverse the arterial ageing process and consequently decrease the incidence of cardiovascular disorders.",

    "26": "Two highly engineered halohydrin dehalogenase variants were characterized in terms of their performance in dehalogenation and epoxide cyanolysis reactions. Both enzyme variants outperformed the wild-type enzyme in the cyanolysis of ethyl (S)-3,4-epoxybutyrate, a conversion yielding ethyl (R)-4-cyano-3-hydroxybutyrate, an important chiral building block for statin synthesis. One of the enzyme variants, HheC2360, displayed catalytic rates for this cyanolysis reaction enhanced up to tenfold. Furthermore, the enantioselectivity of this variant was the opposite of that of the wild-type enzyme, both for dehalogenation and for cyanolysis reactions. The 37-fold mutant HheC2360 showed an increase in thermal stability of 8 \u00b0C relative to the wild-type enzyme. Crystal structures of this enzyme were elucidated with chloride and ethyl (S)-3,4-epoxybutyrate or with ethyl (R)-4-cyano-3-hydroxybutyrate bound in the active site. The observed increase in temperature stability was explained in terms of a substantial increase in buried surface area relative to the wild-type HheC, together with enhanced interfacial interactions between the subunits that form the tetramer. The structures also revealed that the substrate binding pocket was modified both by substitutions and by backbone movements in loops surrounding the active site. The observed changes in the mutant structures are partly governed by coupled mutations, some of which are necessary to remove steric clashes or to allow backbone movements to occur. The importance of interactions between substitutions suggests that efficient directed evolution strategies should allow for compensating and synergistic mutations during library design.",

Prior distributions are specified for the Box-Cox transformation parameters as well as the regression coefficients in this complex model, and the deviance information criterion is used to select the best transformation model. Because the model is quite complex, we develop a novel Monte Carlo Markov chain sampling scheme to sample from the joint posterior of the parameters. This model is motivated by a very rich dataset comprising 26 clinical trials involving cholesterol-lowering drugs where the goal is to jointly model the three-dimensional response consisting of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides (TG) (LDL-C, HDL-C, TG). Because the joint distribution of (LDL-C, HDL-C, TG) is not multivariate normal and in fact quite skewed, a Box-Cox transformation is needed to achieve normality. In the clinical literature, these three variables are usually analyzed univariately; however, a multivariate approach would be more appropriate because these variables are correlated with each other.

These detrimental effects were reproduced in endothelial cells overexpressing MCPIP, with elevated redox stress. Small interfering RNA knockdown of MCPIP restored the endothelial NO synthase-derived NO bioavailability. Administering simvastatin to CIA mice ameliorated the endothelial dysfunction, with attendant decreased aortic level of MCPIP. The beneficial effect of the statin was mediated by inhibiting nuclear factor \u03baB binding to the MCPIP gene enhancer.",

    "59": "Atorvastatin is commonly used to reduce cholesterol. Atorvastatin acid is converted to its corresponding lactone form spontaneously or via glucuronidation mediated by uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 and 1A3. Atorvastatin lactone is pharmacologically inactive, but is suspected to be muscle toxic and cause statin-induced myopathy (SIM). A several fold increase in systemic exposure of atorvastatin lactone has previously been observed in patients with SIM compared with healthy control subjects. In this study we aimed to investigate the association between polymorphisms in the UGT1A gene locus and plasma atorvastatin lactone levels.",

    "63": "Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death worldwide. Many pharmacologic therapies are available that aim to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease but there is significant inter-individual variation in drug response, including both efficacy and toxicity. Pharmacogenetics aims to personalize medication choice and dosage to ensure that maximum clinical benefit is achieved whilst side effects are minimized. Over the past decade, our knowledge of pharmacogenetics in cardiovascular therapies has increased significantly. The anticoagulant warfarin represents the most advanced application of pharmacogenetics in cardiovascular medicine. Prospective randomized clinical trials are currently underway utilizing dosing algorithms that incorporate genetic polymorphisms in cytochrome P450 (CYP)2C9 and vitamin k epoxide reductase (VKORC1) to determine warfarin dosages. Polymorphisms in CYP2C9 and VKORC1 account for approximately 40\u00a0% of the variance in warfarin dose. There is currently significant controversy with regards to pharmacogenetic testing in anti-platelet therapy. Inhibition of platelet aggregation by aspirin in vitro has been associated with polymorphisms in the cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-1 gene. However, COX-1 polymorphisms did not affect clinical outcomes in patients prescribed aspirin therapy. Similarly, CYP2C19 polymorphisms have been associated with clopidogrel resistance in vitro, and have shown an association with stent thrombosis, but not with other cardiovascular outcomes in a consistent manner. Response to statins has been associated with polymorphisms in the cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP), apolipoprotein E (APOE), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, calmin (CLMN) and apolipoprotein-CI (APOC1) genes. Although these genes contribute to the variation in lipid levels during statin therapy, their effects on cardiovascular outcomes requires further investigation. Polymorphisms in the solute carrier organic anion transporter 1B1 (SLCO1B1) gene is associated with increased statin exposure and simvastatin-induced myopathy. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and \u03b2-adrenoceptor antagonists (\u03b2-blockers) are medications that are important in the management of hypertension and heart failure. Insertion and deletion polymorphisms in the ACE gene are associated with elevated and reduced serum levels of ACE, respectively. No significant association was reported between the polymorphism and blood pressure reduction in patients treated with perindopril. However, a pharmacogenetic score incorporating single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the bradykinin type 1 receptor gene and angiotensin-II type I receptor gene predicted those most likely to benefit and suffer harm from perindopril therapy. Pharmacogenetic studies into \u03b2-blocker therapy have focused on variations in the \u03b21-adrenoceptor gene and CYP2D6, but results have been inconsistent. Pharmacogenetic testing for ACE inhibitor and \u03b2-blocker therapy is not currently used in clinical practice. Despite extensive research, no pharmacogenetic tests are currently in clinical practice for cardiovascular medicines. Much of the research remains in the discovery phase, with researchers struggling to demonstrate clinical utility and validity. This is a problem seen in many areas of therapeutics and is because of many factors, including poor study design, inadequate sample sizes, lack of replication, and heterogeneity amongst patient populations and phenotypes. In order to progress pharmacogenetics in cardiovascular therapies, researchers need to utilize next-generation sequencing technologies, develop clear phenotype definitions and engage in multi-center collaborations, not only to obtain larger sample sizes but to replicate associations and confirm results across different ethnic groups.", 
    "64": "We sought to investigate whether TSG suppressed the ICAM-1/VCAM-1 expression in dietary atherosclerotic rats and in Ox-LDL-induced U937 cells. For this purpose, 60 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly-and-equally divided into six groups. Atherosclerosis was induced by feeding rats a hyperlipidemic diet. TSG (120, 60 or 30 mg/kg/day) was administered by oral gavage. Simvastatin (2 mg/kg/day) was administered as positive control whereas physiological saline (0.9% NaCl) served as untreated control. After 12 weeks, rats were euthanized by ethyl carbonate (1,200 mg/kg) and aortic wall samples were collected. Besides, U937 cells were stimulated for 48 h by Ox-LDL (80 \u03bcg/mL) with and without TSG (120, 60, 30 \u03bcg/L) or simvastatin (100 \u03bcg/L). ICAM-1/VCAM-1 mRNA expression was determined by RT-PCR and protein expression was detected by immunohistochemistry and/or western blotting. The data show that ICAM-1/VCAM-1 mRNA/protein expression was significantly enhanced in atherosclerotic aortas compared with normal diet group. Ox-LDL-induced ICAM-1/VCAM-1 mRNA/protein expression in U937 cells. Importantly, TSG significantly inhibited ICAM-1/VCAM-1 expression in atherosclerotic aortas in a dose-dependent manner. TSG-pretreatment also inhibited ICAM-1/VCAM-1 expression in Ox-LDL-induced U937 cells. Therefore, we concluded that TSG suppressed the expression of adhesion (ICAM-1/VCAM-1) molecules both in vivo (in aortic wall of dietary atherosclerotic rats) and in vitro (U937 cells).",

The most common dose was 20 mg/24 h. In the high-risk population, the lowest recommended total cholesterol (TC) concentration was achieved in 3.7% of treated subjects, whereas 5.6% of patients attained LDL < 80 mg/dL (2.0 mmol/L). 9.5% of patients did not exceed the upper limit of normal values for TC (155-175 mg/dL; 4.0-4.5 mmol/L) and 12.6% of patients reached LDL between 80-100 mg/dL (2.0-2.5 mmol/L).

    "70": "We tested the hypothesis that atorvastatin active metabolite (ATM), on the basis of its distinct structural features and potent antioxidant activity, preferentially inhibits lipid oxidation in human small dense low-density lipoprotein (sdLDL) and other small lipid vesicles. LDL, sdLDL, and various subfractions were isolated from human plasma by sequential ultracentrifugation, treated with ATM, atorvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, or simvastatin and were subjected to copper-induced oxidation. Lipid oxidation was measured spectrophotometrically as a function of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances formation. Similar analyses were performed in reconstituted lipid vesicles enriched in polyunsaturated fatty acids and prepared at various sizes. ATM was found to inhibit sdLDL oxidation in a dose-dependent manner. The antioxidant effects of ATM in sdLDL were 1.5 and 4.7 times greater (P < 0.001) than those observed in large buoyant LDL and very low-density lipoprotein subfractions, respectively. ATM had similar dose- and size-dependent effects in reconstituted lipid vesicles. None of these effects were reproduced by atorvastatin (parent) or any of the other statins examined in this study. These data suggest that ATM interacts with sdLDL in a specific manner that also confers preferential resistance to oxidative stress. Such interactions may reduce sdLDL atherogenicity and improve clinical outcomes in patients with cardiovascular disease.", 
    "71": "This study based on nationwide comprehensive health registers analysed trends in characteristics of statin users in the whole community-dwelling population of Finland between 1999 and 2008. The annual number of incident users (defined as those purchasing statins for the first time ever) increased 1.6-fold from 50,125 to 78,058 and that of ongoing users (including continuous users and re-initiators) increased 4.6-fold from 114,091 to 521,211. The proportion of incident users without cardiovascular disease (CVD) or diabetes increased from 23.6% to 27.8%, while the proportion of those with diabetes increased from 15.7% to 19.5%. An increasing proportion of ongoing users had diabetes (from 13.8% to 22.8%). The proportion of ongoing users without CVD or diabetes remained below one-fifth; however, their number increased five-fold. Over the study period, there was an obvious shift towards prescribing of higher statin doses both among incident and ongoing users. In conclusion, statin use is expanding to individuals with low cardiovascular risk despite the fact that clinical guidelines emphasize interventions other than pharmacotherapy for this population. At the same time, statin use is increasingly targeted to patients with diabetes, a high-risk group that is likely to benefit from it.",

Aortic stiffness is an independent predictor of cardiovascular risk and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Vascular stiffening can activate endothelium which in turn may promote atherogenesis. Modulation of arterial stiffness has been shown to be successfully managed via changes in lifestyle and put under control of hypertension pharmacologically with antihypertensive drugs and statins.",

Second, they may play a role in the prevention of accelerated atherosclerosis in the same population. In this review, we discuss the mechanisms of immune regulation by statins and review the literature for their benefit in many autoimmune diseases. In these studies, statins lead to an improvement in the disease activity scores in rheumatoid arthritis patients; a reduction in prothrombotic factors in anti-phospholipid syndrome patients; changes in vasculature, proteinuria, and cardiac events in systemic lupus erythematosus patients; changes in vasculature and proteinuria in patients with vasculitis; disease activity scores in ankylosing spondylitis; and finally vascular changes in patients with systemic sclerosis. Hence, these studies suggest that statins could be used as adjuncts to standard therapy due to their anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory, and anti-thrombogenic effects. More evidence-based research is required to determine whether statin regimens will become the standard of care in patients with autoimmune diseases.",

In our study, the statin hydroxamic acids prepared by a fused strategy are most promising in cancer treatments. These compounds showed potent inhibitory activities against HDACs and HMGR with IC50 values in the nanomolar range. These compounds also effectively reduced the HMGR activity as well as promoted the acetylations of histone and tubulin in cancer cells, but were not toxic to normal cells.",

It has recently been shown that basal CYP activities are maintained in cold-preserved hepatocytes (Palmgren et al., 2012). After 5\u2009d of cold preservation, the viability was still more than 70%, and after 8\u2009d it was around 60%. In hepatocytes that had been cold-preserved for 3\u2009d, the activity of CYP3A4 was induced around 15-fold upon treatment with 8\u2009\u00b5M rifampicin for 72\u2009h. For CYP2B6, the activity was induced 4- to 16-fold in hepatocytes that had been cold-preserved for 3\u2009d and thereafter treated with 1\u2009mM phenobarbital for 72\u2009h. The activity of CYP1A2 was low and close to the limit of detection in non-treated cells that had been cold-preserved for up to 3\u2009d, while the activity increased in cells treated with 0.3-25\u2009\u00b5M \u03b2-naphthoflavone for 72\u2009h. CYP3A4, 2B6 and 1A2 mRNA levels were only determined with hepatocytes from one donor and increased upon treatment with the inducers. Hepatic uptakes of estrone-3-sulfate, taurocholate, ipratropium and rosuvastatin were stable in human hepatocytes that had been cold-preserved for up to 2\u2009d. In summary, cold-preserved human hepatocytes demonstrate retained viability and can advantageously be used for in vitro induction studies and for studies of hepatic uptake transporters.",

UV spectrophotometric and total organic carbon-solid sample module (TOC-SSM) method was developed and validated for the verification and determination of atorvastatin residues in the production area and to confirm the efficiency of the cleaning procedure as per ICH guideline. Atorvastatin was selected on the basis of a worst-case rating approach. It exhibited good linearity in the range of 5 to 25 \u03bcg/mL for UV spectrophotometric and 7300 to 83800 \u03bcg for the TOC-SSM method. The limit of detection was 0.419 \u03bcg/mL and 4.19 \u03bcg in the UV spectrophotometric and TOC-SSM methods, respectively. The limit of quantitation was 1.267 \u03bcg/mL and 12.69 \u03bcg in UV spectrophotometric and TOC-SSM methods, respectively. Percentage recovery from spiked stainless steel plates was found to be 95.37% and 92.82% in UV spectrophotometric and TOC-SSM methods, respectively. The calculated limit of acceptance per swab for atorvastatin (35.65 \u03bcg/swab) was not exceeded during three consecutive batches of production after cleaning procedure. Both proposed methods are suitable for quantitative determination of atorvastatin on manufacturing equipment surfaces well below the limit of contamination. The ease of sample preparation permits fast and efficient application of the proposed methods in quantitation of atorvastatin residue with precision and accuracy.

Early statin therapy has also been shown to improve cardiovascular outcomes in Japanese patients with ACS, and pretreatment with high-dose statin prior to percutaneous coronary intervention has been shown to reduce cardiovascular events in these patients. As is the case in Western populations, many Japanese patients may be undertreated and a residual cardiovascular risk remains. While differences in treatment practice, dosing and genetic factors exist between Japan and Western countries, similarities are also evident when Japanese statin studies are compared with those performed in Western populations. With the increasing prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in Japan, aggressive statin treatment may be beneficial in achieving optimal cardiovascular outcomes.", 
    "95": "Hypercholesterolaemia is a highly prevalent condition that has major health and cost implications for society. Pharmacotherapy is an important and effective treatment modality for hypercholesterolaemia, with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors ('statins') the most commonly used class of drugs. Over the past decade, there has been intensive research to identify pharmacogenetic markers to guide treatment of hypercholesterolaemia. This study aimed to review the evidence of incremental cost, effect and cost effectiveness of pharmacogenetic-guided treatment of hypercholesterolaemia. Three cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) were identified that studied the value of screening for genotypes of angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE), cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), and kinesin family member 6 (KIF6) prior to initiating statin therapy. For all three CEAs, a major limitation identified was the reproducibility of the evidence supporting the clinical effect of screening for the pharmacogenetic marker. Associated issues included the uncertain value of pharmacogenetic markers over or in addition to existing approaches for monitoring lipid levels, and the lack of evidence to assess the effectiveness of alternative therapeutic options for individuals identified as poor responders to statin therapy. Finally, the economic context of the market for diagnostic tests (is it competitive or is there market power?) and the practicality of large-scale screening programmes to inform prescribing in a complex and varied market may limit the generalizability of the results of the specific CEAs to policy outcomes. The genotype of solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1 (SLCO1B1) has recently been associated with increased risk of muscle toxicity with statin therapy and the review identified that exploration of cost effectiveness of this pharmacogenetic marker is likely warranted.", 
    "96": "Drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation is a common treatment for atherosclerosis. The safety and efficacy of these devices will depend on the uptake and distribution of drug into the vessel wall. It is established that the composition of atherosclerotic vessels can vary dramatically with patients' age and gender. However, studies focused on elucidating and quantifying the impact of these variations on important drug transport properties, such as diffusion (D) and partition (k) coefficients, are limited. We have developed an improved tissue mimic or artificial plaque to probe the effect of varying concentrations of plaque constituents on drug transport in vitro. Based on these artificial plaques, we have quantified the impact of gelatin (hydrolyzed collagen) and lipid (cholesterol) concentration on D and k using two model drugs, tetracycline and fluvastatin. We found that for tetracycline, increasing the collagen concentration from 0.025 to 0.100 (w/w) resulted in a fivefold decrease in diffusivity, whereas there was no discernible impact on solubility. Increasing the lipid concentration up to 0.034 (w/w) resulted in only minor changes to transport properties of tetracycline. However, fluvastatin exhibited nearly a fivefold increase in k and 10-fold decrease in D with increased lipid concentration. These results were in reasonable agreement with existing models and exhibited behavior consistent with previous observations on drugs commonly used in DES applications. These observations suggest that variations in the chemical characteristics of atherosclerotic plaque can significantly alter the release rate and distribution of drug following DES implantation.",

    "105": "The pleiotropic effects of statins have been suggested to prevent atrial fibrillation onset. We conducted a population-based case-control study using medical databases from Northern Denmark (population: 1.8 million) to examine the association between statin use and atrial fibrillation or flutter. We identified 51,374 patients with atrial fibrillation or flutter between 1999 and 2010 and 513,670 matched population controls. We collected data on statin prescriptions redeemed within 90 days (current users) or longer (former users) before the diagnosis date of atrial fibrillation or flutter. We stratified statin users by duration of exposure, determined by the number of days between first and last redeemed prescription before the diagnosis date (<365, 365-1094, and \u22651095 days). We used conditional logistic regression to compute odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), controlling for potential confounders. We defined people without previous statin use as never users (reference). A total of 7360 (14.3%) cases and 55,699 (10.8%) controls were current statin users. Among current users (adjusted OR: 0.96, 95% CI, 0.93-0.99), the preventive effect of statins on atrial fibrillation or flutter was related to duration of use: adjusted ORs decreased from 1.35 (95% CI, 1.28-1.42) for users who were prescribed statins for <365 days to 0.85 (95% CI, 0.81-0.89) for users who were prescribed statins for \u22651095 days compared with never users. For former users (adjusted OR: 0.94, 95% CI. 0.90-0.98), the ORs did not change with varying lengths of exposure. In conclusion, long-term statin use may reduce the risk of atrial fibrillation or flutter compared with never use.",

However, the major liver uptake transporters were either absent or expressed at significantly lower levels in human liver cell lines than in human liver. When comparing cytotoxicity of five statins, the organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 expressing HEK cells showed a significantly higher sensitivity than the wild-type HEK cells. The IC50 shifts ranged from 9- to >100-fold, and the potency shifts collapsed in the presence of rifampicin, the inhibitor for OATPs. The extent of the IC50 shift correlated with the permeability of the statins with high permeable compounds having smaller shifts and low permeable compounds having larger shifts. The changes in statin potency in transporter-transfected cells reflect the active uptake of statins into the cells, and the increased intracellular drug concentration lead to increased toxicity. The data suggested that uptake transporters have a significant impact on the outcomes of a cell-based assay and should be considered during the early stages of compound toxicity screening in drug discovery. For compounds with low permeability that are likely to undergo transporter-mediated uptake, it is important to test them in transporter-competent cell models.",

The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors have been shown to inhibit ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters but have also impact on glycosylation of such proteins. Doxorubicin is a substrate for ABC transporters like P-glycoprotein (ABCB1) which is present in human RD rhabdomyosarcoma cells. It was therefore the aim of this study to identify the compartmentalisation and action of doxorubicin in simvastatin-treated RD cells. Due to autofluorescence of doxorubicin, intracellular distribution was monitored by confocal microscopy. The biological effects were traced on the level of colony formation, caspase activation and DNA injury. Here we show that simvastatin treatment leads to ABCB1 inhibition and down-regulation of the transporter. Consequently, these cells accumulate significant amounts of doxorubicin, predominantly in the nucleus and lysosomes. While clearance of the anthracycline into lysosomes is not altered by simvastatin treatment, it significantly enhanced nuclear accumulation in a HMG-CoA reductase-independent manner. Thus, in such treated cells, topoisomerase II activity is significantly inhibited, which is further corroborated by augmented double-strand DNA breaks. Moreover, colony formation was synergistically inhibited by the combination of simvastatin and doxorubicin. Given the fact that ABCB1 expression correlates with an adverse prognosis in many tumours, adjuvant chemotherapy including statins might represent a novel therapeutic concept to overcome ABCB1-mediated multidrug resistance by direct inhibition and down-regulation.",

Therapeutic potential of rofecoxib and statins have been well documented in several experimental models of neurodegenerative disorders, however, its exact mechanism of action is not known properly. Therefore, the present study is an attempt to investigate the effect of rofecoxib along with the statins against MA induced behavioural and biochemical alterations in rats. Single intrastriatal MA (6 \u00b5mol) significantly caused motor incordination, memory dysfunction and alteration in the antioxidant enzyme levels, mitochondrial enzyme complex (I, II, IV) activities, mitochondrial redox ratio and pro-inflammatory cytokine [tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6)] levels in the striatum as compared to the naive group. Fourteen days treatment with rofecoxib, atorvastatin, simvastatin significantly attenuated these behavioural, biochemical, and cellular alterations as compared to control (MA treated group). However, the treatment of rofecoxib along with atorvastatin or simvastatin significantly attenuated these behavioural, biochemical, and cellular alterations as compared to their individual effects. The results of the present study demonstrated that rofecoxib modulates the protective effects of statins against MA-induced neurobehavioral and related biochemical and cellular alterations in rats.

The present study aims to characterise transport of statins by human and rat MRP2/Mrp2 using membrane and vesicle preparations. All statins tested (simvastatin, pravastatin, pitavastatin, fluvastatin, atorvastatin, lovastatin and rosuvastatin) stimulated vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity in membranes expressing human or rat MRP2/Mrp2, suggesting that all statins are substrates of human and rat MRP2/Mrp2. The substrate affinity (Km) of all statins for MRP2/Mrp2 was comparable and no correlation between lipophilicity (logD7.0) and Km was seen. All statins also inhibited uptake of the fluorescent Mrp2 substrate, CDF (1\u03bcM) into vesicles expressing human or rat MRP2/Mrp2 with similar IC50 values. Fitting of the inhibitory data to the hill slope equation, gave hill coefficients (h) of greater than one, suggesting that transport involved more than one binding site for inhibitors of MPR2 and Mrp2. We conclude that statins were transported by both human and rat MRP2/Mrp2 with similar affinity. Statins were also shown to compete with other substrates for transport by MRP2/Mrp2 and that this transport involved more than one binding site on the Mrp2/MRP2 protein.",

Patients with a higher EPC count at baseline showed no increase in EPC recruitment in response to statin treatment but had favorable LLL at 6- and 18-month FU, whereas patients with lower EPC count were responsive to statin therapy, but EPCs might be less functional as they had higher LLL at 6- and 18-month FU.

Increasing evidence points at the role of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in restenosis pathogenesis independently on Hb1AC levels. Thus, we investigated the predictive value of preprocedural AGE levels for in-stent restenosis in a population of euglycaemic diabetic patients undergoing PCI with DES implantation. One hundred twenty-five consecutive patients with DM in optimized glycemic control admitted for stable angina pectoris and treated with elective DES implantation at a tertiary hospital were prospectively included. The primary end point of the ARMYDA-AGEs study was to compare rates of angiographic ISR at 6 months after the intervention according to pre-PCI levels of AGEs. Secondary end points were the correlations of AGE levels with occurrence of periprocedural myocardial damage, major adverse cardiac events, and in-stent late loss at 6-month control coronary angiography. AGE levels >17 \u03bcM was found to be an independent predictor of ISR at 6 months and stent lumen loss. AGEs failed to predict occurrence of secondary endpoints. In conclusion, elevated AGE levels predict occurrence of in-stent restenosis after DES implantation in patients with DM on optimized glycemic control and might represent a dosable marker of adverse outcome after PCI.",

Bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP4) expression is increased in endothelium in atherosclerosis-prone regions and is known to induce endothelial inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, and hypertension. BMP actions are mediated by 2 different types of BMP receptors (BMPRI and BMPRII). Here, we show a surprising finding that loss of BMPRII expression causes endothelial inflammation and atherosclerosis.", 
    "150": "Using BMPRII siRNA and BMPRII(+/-) mice, we found that specific knockdown of BMPRII, but not other BMP receptors (Alk1, Alk2, Alk3, Alk6, ActRIIa, and ActRIIb), induced endothelial inflammation in a ligand-independent manner by mechanisms mediated by reactive oxygen species, nuclear factor-KappaB, and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidases. Further, BMPRII(+/-)ApoE(-/-) mice developed accelerated atherosclerosis compared with BMPRII(+/+)ApoE(-/-) mice. Interestingly, we found that multiple proatherogenic stimuli, such as hypercholesterolemia, disturbed flow, prohypertensive angiotensin II, and the proinflammatory cytokine (tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1), downregulated BMPRII expression in endothelium, whereas antiatherogenic stimuli, such as stable flow and statin treatment, upregulated its expression in vivo and in vitro. Moreover, BMPRII expression was significantly diminished in human coronary advanced atherosclerotic lesions. Also, we were able to rescue the endothelial inflammation induced by BMPRII knockdown by overexpressing the BMPRII wild type, but not by the BMPRII short form lacking the carboxyl-terminal tail region.",

    "153": "We studied TICE ex vivo in mouse and human intestinal explants, and in vivo after bile diversion and intestinal cannulation in mice. We provide the first evidence that both low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein deliver cholesterol for TICE in human and mouse jejunal explants at the basolateral side. Proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9)(-/-) mice and intestinal explants show increased LDL-TICE, and acute injection of PCSK9 decreases TICE in vivo, suggesting that PCSK9 is a repressor of TICE. The acute repression was dependent on the LDL receptor (LDLR). Further, TICE was increased when mice were treated with lovastatin. These data point to an important role for LDLR in TICE. However, LDLR(-/-) mice showed increased intestinal LDL uptake, contrary to what is observed in the liver, and tended to have higher TICE. We interpret these data to suggest that there might be at least 2 mechanisms contributing to TICE; 1 involving LDL receptors and other unidentified mechanisms. Acute modulation of LDLR affects TICE, but chronic deficiency is compensated for most likely by the upregulation of the unknown mechanisms. Using mice deficient for apical multidrug active transporter ATP-binding cassette transporter B1 a and b, and its inhibitor, we show that these apical transporters contribute significantly to TICE.",

Being an essential step prior to metastasis, blockage of micrometastasis can have potential applications in cancer therapy and metastasis prevention. Due to poorly known molecular mechanisms leading to micrometastasis, developing therapeutic strategies to target prostate cancer utilizing drugs that block micrometastasis is far from reality. Here, we demonstrate the potential benefits of simvastatin in the inhibition of prostate cancer micrometastasis and reveal the novel molecular mechanisms underlying this process. First, we showed that simvastatin inhibited the ability of human PC3 prostate cancer cells for transendothelial migration in vitro. Second, our data indicated that simvastatin modulates the expression of tumor-derived factors such as angiopoietins and VEGF-A at the mRNA and protein levels by the PC3 cells, thus preventing endothelial-barrier disruption. Third, simvastatin directly activated endothelial cells and enhances endothelial-barrier resistance. Apart from this, our study revealed that simvastatin-mediated effect on PC3 micrometastasis was mediated through inhibition of integrin \u03b1v \u03b23 activity and suppression of interaction between prostate cancer cell integrin \u03b1v \u03b23 with endothelial ICAM-1.",

    "164": "Although statins are known to inhibit proliferation and induce death in a number of cancer cell types, the mechanisms through which downregulation of the mevalonate (MVA) pathway activates death signaling remain poorly understood. Here we set out to unravel the signaling networks downstream of the MVA pathway that mediate the death-inducing activity of simvastatin. Consistent with previous reports, exogenously added geranylgeranylpyrophosphate, but not farnesylpyrophosphate, prevented simvastatin's growth-inhibitory effect, thereby suggesting the involvement of geranylgeranylated proteins such as Rho GTPases in the anticancer activity of simvastatin. Indeed, simvastatin treatment led to increased levels of unprenylated Ras homolog gene family, member A (RhoA), Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate 1 (Rac1) and cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42). Intriguingly, instead of inhibiting the functions of Rho GTPases as was expected with loss of prenylation, simvastatin caused a paradoxical increase in the GTP-bound forms of RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42. Furthermore, simvastatin disrupted the binding of Rho GTPases with the cytosolic inhibitor Rho GDI\u03b1, which provides a potential mechanism for GTP loading of the cytosolic Rho GTPases. We also show that the unprenylated RhoA- and Rac1-GTP retained at least part of their functional activities, as evidenced by the increase in intracellular superoxide production and JNK activation in response to simvastatin. Notably, blocking superoxide production attenuated JNK activation as well as cell death induced by simvastatin. Finally, we provide evidence for the involvement of the B-cell lymphoma protein 2 family, Bcl-2-interacting mediator (Bim), in a JNK-dependent manner, in the apoptosis-inducing activity of simvastatin. Taken together, our data highlight the critical role of non-canonical regulation of Rho GTPases and involvement of downstream superoxide-mediated activation of JNK pathway in the anticancer activity of simvastatin, which would have potential clinical implications.",

In particular, we have explored the stringency of the requirement of cholesterol in the regulation of cell cycle progression. For this purpose, we utilized distal and proximal inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis, and monitored their effect on cell cycle progression. We show that cholesterol content increases in S phase and inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis results in cell cycle arrest in G1 phase under certain conditions. Interestingly, G1 arrest mediated by cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitors could be reversed upon metabolic replenishment of cholesterol. Importantly, our results show that the requirement of cholesterol for G1 to S transition is absolute, and even immediate biosynthetic precursors of cholesterol, differing with cholesterol merely in a double bond, could not replace cholesterol for reversing the cell cycle arrest.

Studies have demonstrated that a rate control strategy, with a target resting heart rate between 80 and 100\u00a0beats/minute, is recommended over rhythm control in the vast majority of patients. The CHA2 DS2 \u2265 (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age \u2265 65 yrs, diabetes mellitus, stroke or transient ischemic attack, vascular disease, female gender) scoring system is a potentially useful stroke risk stratification tool that incorporates additional risk factors to the commonly used CHADS2 (congestive heart failure, hypertension, age \u2265 75 years, diabetes mellitus, stroke transient ischemic attack) scoring tool. Similarly, a convenient scheme, termed HAS-BLED (hypertension, abnormal renal/liver function, stroke, bleeding history or predisposition, labile international normalized ratio, elderly, drugs/alcohol concomitantly), to assess bleeding risk has emerged that may be useful in select patients. Furthermore, new antithrombotic strategies have been developed as potential alternatives to warfarin, including dual-antiplatelet therapy with clopidogrel plus aspirin and the development of new oral anticoagulants such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, and apixaban. Vernakalant has emerged as another potential option for pharmacologic conversion of AF, whereas recent trials have better defined the role of dronedarone in the maintenance of sinus rhythm. Finally, catheter ablation represents another alternative to manage AF, whereas upstream therapy with inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, statins, and polyunsaturated fatty acids could potentially prevent the occurrence of AF.

The in vitro enzyme-based and cell-based assays reveal that 12 compounds have good inhibitory activity against ROCK1 in the micro molar regime (IC50 values between about 7 and 28 \u03bcM) and antitumor activity against lung cancer, breast cancer or/and myeloma cell lines. The structural analysis shows that two active compounds present novel scaffolds and are potential leads for the development of novel anti-cancer drugs. We then characterized the interaction patterns between ROCK1 and two inhibitors with novel scaffolds by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and free energy decomposition analysis. In addition, the pharmacological effect of the two ROCK1 inhibitors with novel scaffolds on atorvastatin-induced cerebral hemorrhage was evaluated by using zebrafish model, and one compound candidate is able to prevent atorvastatin-induced cerebral hemorrhage effectively.", 
    "193": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are two major causes of liver disease worldwide. Epidemiological and clinical data have clearly demonstrated that NAFLD and its associated metabolic abnormalities are a risk factor for HCC. Traditionally, the mechanisms whereby NAFLD acts as a risk for HCC are believed to include replicative senescence of steatotic hepatocytes and compensatory hyperplasia of progenitor cells as a reaction to chronic hepatic injury. Recent years have witnessed significant advances in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the link between NAFLD and HCC.", 
    "194": "In the present review, we provide an update on the pathophysiological pathways linking NAFLD and its associated metabolic derangements to malignant hepatic transformation, with a special focus on insulin resistance, adipokines, inflammation, and angiogenesis. We will also discuss the potential therapeutic implications that such molecular links carry.", 
    "195": "Although treating NAFLD could reduce the risk of malignant hepatic transformation, no long-term studies focusing on this issue have been conducted thus far. Insulin resistance, inflammation as well as derangements in adipokines and angiogenic factors associated with NAFLD are closely intertwined with the risk of developing HCC.", 
    "196": "Traditional therapeutic approaches in NAFLD including metformin and statins may theoretically reduce the risk of HCC by acting on common pathophysiological pathways shared by NAFLD and HCC.", 
    "197": "We assessed the pathological characteristics of the radical prostatectomy specimen, the rate of biochemical failure and the functional outcome after surgery, in terms of incontinence and erectile dysfunction rate, in patients on statin medication.", 
    "198": "A total of 588 patients with a mean age 65.2 years (SD = 5.7 years) participated in the study. All patients were contacted and interviewed.", 
    "199": "Users who had been on statin medication for more than 2 years had lower levels of preoperative serum PSA (p = 0.034), a 2.76 times greater likelihood of being staged as pT3a to pT3b rather than pT2a to pT2c, and a 5.39 times greater likelihood of having a postoperative Gleason score equal to seven or more. Positive surgical margins and urinary incontinence were not significantly associated with statin use. The probability of erectile dysfunction was significantly greater for statin users.", 
    "200": "Statin medication was associated with a statistically significantly lower PSA value and an increased rate of high Gleason score and pathologic stage in patients receiving medication for more than 2 years. Statins were found to be an independent predictor of recurrence. Lastly, statin users were more likely to present with preoperative and postoperative erectile dysfunction.", 
    "201": "Calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA), also known as calciphylaxis, is characterized by vascular calcification, thrombosis and intense inflammation. Prior research has shown that statins have anticalcification, antithrombotic and antiinflammatory properties; however, the association between statin use and CUA has not been investigated.", 
    "202": "This matched case-control study included 62 adult maintenance hemodialysis (HD) patients with biopsy-confirmed CUA diagnosed between the years 2002 and 2011 (cases). All cases were hospitalized at the time of diagnosis. Controls (n = 124) were hospitalized maintenance HD patients without CUA (matched to cases by gender and timing of hospitalization). Univariate and multivariable logistic regression models were applied to compute odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for CUA in statin users, and also to examine previously described associations.", 
    "203": "The mean age of cases was 58 years. Most were females (68%), and of white race (64%). Statin use was more common in controls than in cases (39 vs. 19%, p < 0.01). Statin use was associated with lower odds of CUA in unadjusted (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.18-0.79) and adjusted (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.05-0.88) analyses. Hypercalcemia (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.14-4.43), hypoalbuminemia (OR 5.73, 95% CI 2.79-11.77), calcitriol use (OR 5.69, 95% CI 1.02-31.77) and warfarin use (OR 4.30, 95% CI 1.57-11.74) were positively associated with CUA in adjusted analyses whereas paricalcitol and doxercalciferol were not (OR 1.33, 95% CI 0.54-3.27).", 
    "204": "Statin use may be negatively associated with odds of CUA. Further large prospective studies with attention to potential confounders are needed to confirm these findings.", 
    "205": "In this study, we examined the relationship between exposure to siblings and 1) the risk of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and 2) C-reactive protein levels. We retrospectively analyzed pooled cross-sectional data from 2 studies: the Cardiovascular Health and Age-Related Maculopathy Study (2001-2002) and the Age-Related Maculopathy Statin Study (2004-2006). Associations between number of siblings and AMD were assessed by using multinomial logistic regression. Associations between number of siblings and C-reactive protein levels were examined by using a generalized linear model for \u03b3 distribution. A higher number of younger siblings was associated with significantly lower odds of early AMD in those with a family history of AMD (odds ratio = 0.2, 95% confidence interval: 0.1, 0.8) (P = 0.022) but was unrelated to AMD for those who had no family history of the disease (odds ratio = 1.0, 95% confidence interval: 0.9, 1.2) (P = 0.874). A higher number of younger siblings correlated with lower C-reactive protein levels (\u03b2 = -0.19, 95% confidence interval: -0.38, -0.01) (P = 0.036). This supports the theory that immune modulation contributes to AMD pathogenesis and suggests that exposure to younger siblings might be protective when there is a family history of AMD.", 
    "206": "Affective disorders and memory impairments precede the classical motor symptoms seen in Parkinson's disease (PD) and the currently approved antiparkinsonian agents do not alleviate the non-motor symptoms as well as the underlying dopaminergic neuron degeneration. On the other hand, there is increasing evidence that inflammation plays a key role in the pathophysiology of PD and that the anti-inflammatory actions of statins are related to their neuroprotective properties against different insults in the CNS. The present data indicates that the oral treatment with atorvastatin (10mg/kg/day), once a day during 7 consecutive days, was able to prevent short-term memory impairments and depressive-like behavior of rats assessed in the social recognition and forced swimming tests at 7 and 14 days, respectively, after a single intranasal (i.n.) administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) (1mg/nostril). Importantly, at this time no significant alterations on the locomotor activity of the animals were observed in the open field test. Moreover, atorvastatin was found to protect against the long-lasting motor deficits evaluated in activity chambers and the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta observed at 21 days after i.n. MPTP administration. At this time, despite the absence of spatial memory deficits in the water maze and in concentrations of the cytokines TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-10 in striatum and hippocampus following i.n. MPTP administration, atorvastatin treatment resulted in a significant increase in the striatal and hippocampal levels of nerve growth factor (NGF). These findings reinforce and extend the notion of the neuroprotective potential of atorvastatin and suggest that it may represent a new therapeutic tool for the management of motor and non-motor symptoms of PD.", 
    "207": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is known to expose the patient to a high risk of death due to cardiovascular and infective causes. In parallel, septic shock is a major challenge for cardiovascular and immune system. Therefore we tried to determine whether non-dialysis CKD, defined as a baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 ml/min/1.73 m2, for three months prior to the onset of septic shock is an independent risk factor for death.", 
    "208": "All patients treated in a teaching hospital medical ICU for septic shock between January 2007 and December 2009 were retrospectively analyzed. Patients in whom baseline eGFR could not be determined (n=14) or patients treated by chronic dialysis (n=21) or kidney transplantation (n=14) were excluded. A total of 163 patients were included. The population was divided according to baseline eGFR \u2265 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 (non-CKD group, n=107) and < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 (CKD group, n=56). Twenty-eight-day and 1-year survival curves were plotted. Prognostic factors were determined using Cox proportional hazards models.", 
    "209": "Baseline eGFR was significantly higher in the non-CKD group than in the CKD group (81 (67-108) vs. 36 (28-44) ml/min/1.73 m2, respectively; p=0.001). Age, SAPS II, serum creatinine on admission and the number of patients with a history of diabetes, hypertension, heart failure, peripheral artery disease, coronary artery disease and statin medication were significantly higher in the CKD group than in the non-CKD group. The mortality rate was lower in the non-CKD group than in the CKD group after 28 days (50% vs. 70%, respectively; p=0.03) and 1 year (64% vs. 82%, respectively; p=0.03). On multivariate analysis, the dichotomous variable CKD (eGFR < 60 ml/min/1.73 m2) remained significantly associated with the 28-day and 1-year mortality.",

    "211": "(1) To examine the association between statin use and giant cell arteritis (GCA); (2) to compare the clinical features and disease course of GCA among statin users and nonusers.", 
    "212": "For this retrospective study, we reviewed the medical records of all patients with biopsy-positive GCA diagnosed between 1998 and 2008. Using a case-control design, we compared the frequency of statin use in GCA patients to non-GCA population-based subjects who were randomly selected and individually matched by sex, age, and calendar year to the GCA cases. Statin use at diagnosis or index date and during followup was abstracted. In subjects with GCA, clinical information at diagnosis and followup was collected.", 
    "213": "We included 594 patients, 297 with GCA (73% female), mean age at diagnosis 75 years. The rate of statin exposure at index date was 18.1% for GCA patients versus 33.3% for controls (p < 0.001). Patients using statins were less likely to develop GCA compared with patients not using statins (OR 0.31, 95% CI 0.15-0.6, p < 0.001), even after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors. Among patients with GCA, the presenting clinical features and acute-phase reactants were similar in patients receiving statins compared to those not on statin therapy. These 2 groups were also similar with regard to relapse rate, prednisone tapering, and overall survival.", 
    "214": "Patients using statins may be less likely to develop GCA compared to patients who are not using statins. Statin use does not appear to modify the clinical presentation or the course of the disease.",

Of these, 11 124 had statins discontinued at least temporarily; 6579 were rechallenged with a statin over the subsequent 12 months. Most patients who were rechallenged (92.2%) were still taking a statin 12 months after the statin-related event. Among the 2721 patients who were rechallenged with the same statin to which they had a statin-related event, 1295 were receiving the same statin 12 months later, and 996 of them were receiving the same or a higher dose.", 
    "222": "Statin discontinuations and statin-related events were assessed in practices affiliated with 2 academic medical centers. Utilization of secondary data could have led to missing or misinterpreted data. Natural-language-processing tools used to compensate for the low (30%) proportion of reasons for statin discontinuation documented in structured electronic medical record fields are not perfectly accurate.", 
    "223": "Statin-related events are commonly reported and often lead to statin discontinuation. However, most patients who are rechallenged can tolerate statins long-term. This suggests that many of the statin-related events may have other causes, are tolerable, or may be specific to individual statins rather than the entire drug class.",
