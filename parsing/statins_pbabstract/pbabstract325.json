    "0": "The increased risk of atherosclerosis associated with diabetes cannot be explained by conventional cardiovascular risk factors alone. We hypothesized that transvascular lipoprotein transport may be increased in patients with diabetes, possibly explaining increased intimal lipoprotein accumulation and thus atherosclerosis.", 
    "1": "We used an in vivo method for measurement of transvascular transport of low density lipoprotein (LDL) and applied it in 24 patients with insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (type 1) and in 30 healthy controls. LDL was individually sampled and autologous 131-iodinated LDL was reinjected intravenously in addition to 125-iodinated albumin, and the 1-h fractional escape rates were taken as indices of transvascular transport.", 
    "2": "Transvascular LDL transport was 5.7+/-2.2 and 4.0+/-1.8%/h in patients with diabetes and controls (P<0.005); equivalent values for albumin were 6.8+/-2.5 and 5.4+/-2.0%/h (P<0.05). This difference most likely was not caused by altered hepatic LDL receptor expression, glycosylation of LDL, small LDL size, nephropathy, statin use, or different plasma insulin levels in diabetes patients.", 
    "3": "Transvascular LDL transport may be increased in patients with type 1 diabetes. This suggests that lipoprotein flux into the arterial wall is increased in people with type 1 diabetes, possibly explaining accelerated development of atherosclerosis.", 
    "4": "Seventeen stable cardiac transplant recipients, of whom 16 were on statin therapy, used margarine with stanol/sterol esters. Total cholesterol in the treatment group was lowered from 211 mg/dl (range 168 to 244) to 177 mg/dl (136 to 241) (17% reduction, p = 0.003) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was reduced from 125 mg/dl (73 to 161) to 98 mg/dl (57 to 146) (22% reduction, p = 0.0006). LDL cholesterol reached the pre-defined cut-off level of 115 mg/dl in 12 of 17 patients and statin dosages were reduced. In 8 of 12 patients, LDL cholesterol remained at <115 mg/dl 6 weeks after statin reduction.", 
    "5": "Eight healthy male volunteers, lumbar-punctured before and during simvastatin treatment, were phenotyped for CYP2D6 analysis of the debrisoquine metabolic ratio (the ratio between the urinary recovery of debrisoquine and its 4-hydroxy metabolite) after a single oral dose of debrisoquine. The mean cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of cholesterol and taurine did not differ before and during treatment. During (but not before) treatment taurine in the CSF correlated with the debrisoquine metabolic ratio (r=-0.93; P=0.0007) Our results might indicate an influence of CYP2D6 on the level of taurine in the CSF that was secondary to the change in plasma cholesterol.", 
    "6": "Plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and its major protein, apolipoprotein A-I, are inversely correlated with the incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Low HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I levels often are found in association with other cardiovascular risk factors, including the metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, overexpression of apolipoprotein A-I in animals has been shown to reduce progression and even induce regression of atherosclerosis, indicating that apolipoprotein A-I is directly protective against atherosclerosis. A major mechanism by which apolipoprotein A-I inhibits atherosclerosis may be by promoting cholesterol efflux from macrophages and returning it to the liver for excretion, a process termed reverse cholesterol transport. This article focuses on new developments in the regulation of reverse cholesterol transport and the clinical implications of those developments.", 
    "7": "Metabolic abnormalities associated with the metabolic syndrome are also present in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and in those with familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL). These abnormalities include central obesity, insulin resistance with hyperinsulinemia, hypertension, increased plasma triglycerides, and decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Other characteristics associated with FCHL include the presence of small, dense low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and increased apolipoprotein B. Patients with these abnormalities are at an increased risk for premature coronary artery disease. Treatment of the dyslipidemia associated with type 2 diabetes and FCHL with a combination of a statin and a thiazolidinedione or niacin offers the most comprehensive modality to correct the various lipid abnormalities.", 
    "8": "The lowering of serum cholesterol is increasingly recognised as essential in the prevention of coronary heart disease and other atherosclerotic disease. The success of statin trials and the need to deploy these drugs effectively in the population has led increasingly to the identification of many people whose serum cholesterol, triglycerides, and HDL-cholesterol require clinical assessment, and frequently treatment. Lipid disorders are mainly straightforward, but some are complex or resistant to simple treatment strategies. I have reviewed the clinical manifestations of disordered lipid metabolism (dyslipidaemia) and its management.", 
    "9": "The oxidative modification of low density lipoprotein (LDL) is thought to play an important role in atherogenesis. Drugs of beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) family are usually used as a very effective lipid-lowering preparations but they simultaneously block biosynthesis of both cholesterol and ubiquinone Q10 (coenzyme Q), which is an intermediate electron carrier in the mitochondrial respiratory chain. It is known that reduced form of ubiquinone Q10 acts in the human LDL as very effective natural antioxidant. Daily per os administration of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin to rats for 30 day had no effect on high-energy phosphates (adenosin triphosphate, creatine phosphate) content in liver but decreased a level of these substances in myocardium. We study the Cu2+-mediated susceptibility of human LDL to oxidation and the levels of free radical products of LDL lipoperoxidation in LDL particles from patients with atherosclerosis after 3 months treatment with natural antioxidants vitamin E as well as during 6 months administration of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as pravastatin and cerivastatin in monotherapy and in combination with natural antioxidant ubiquinone Q10 or synthetic antioxidant probucol in a double-blind placebo-controlled trials. The 3 months of natural antioxidant vitamin E administration (400 mg daily) to patients did not increase the susceptibility of LDL to oxidation. On the other hand, synthetic antioxidant probucol during long-time period of treatment (3-6 months) in low-dose (250 mg daily) doesn't change the lipid metabolism parameters in the blood of patients but their high antioxidant activity was observed. Really, after oxidation of probucol-contained LDL by C-15 animal lipoxygenase in these particles we identified the electron spin resonance signal of probucol phenoxyl radical that suggests the interaction of LDL-associated probucol with lipid radicals in vivo. We observed that 6 months treatment of patients with pravastatine (40 mg daily) or cerivastatin (0.4 mg daily) was followed by sufficiently accumulation of LDL lipoperoxides in vivo. In contrast, the 6 months therapy with pravastatin in combination with ubiquinone Q10 (60 mg daily) sharply decreased the LDL initial lipoperoxides level whereas during treatment with cerivastatin in combination with probucol (250 mg daily) the LDL lipoperoxides concentration was maintained on an invariable level. Therefore, antioxidants may be very effective in the prevention of atherogenic oxidative modification of LDL during HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors therapy.", 
    "10": "A 61-year-old man developed atrial fibrillation 2 weeks after the administration of simvastatin (5 mg once daily) and recovered to sinus rhythm 3 days after withdrawal of the drug. Electrocardiography had not previously revealed an abnormality except for transient atrial fibrillation and left atrial overloading. Although he has not been given any antiarrhythmic agents, sinus rhythm is being continuously maintained. The timing of the transient atrial fibrillation attack was closely related to the administration of simvastatin. An inhibitory effect of myocardial energy metabolism through ubiquinone synthesis may play a role in the development of atrial fibrillation.", 
    "11": "Cardiac stress adaptation is deteriorated in hyperlipidemia possibly due to deterioration of nitric oxide (NO) metabolism. However, inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, a key enzyme in the mevalonate pathway, was shown to increase the level of endothelial NO-synthase (eNOS) mRNA. Here we studied the effect of dietary and pharmacologic modulation of the mevalonate pathway on cardiac NO synthesis. Rats were fed 2% cholesterol-enriched or normal diet for 8 weeks. Normal and cholesterol-fed animals were treated with farnesol, a major metabolite of the mevalonate pathway (2.2 mg/kg i.p.) or with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin (3 x 5 mg/kg per os for 3 days, n = 5-6 in each group). Cardiac NO content was significantly decreased in cholesterol-fed rats as assessed by electron spin resonance spectroscopy, however, other treatments did not influence cardiac NO content. Cardiac activity of Ca(2+)-dependent NOS was unaffected by cholesterol-diet and by treatment with either farnesol or lovastatin, as assessed by (14)C-citrullin assay. Ca(2+)-independent NOS activity was negligible in all groups. Cardiac eNOS protein content measured by Western blotting was also unchanged in all groups. We conclude that cholesterol-diet decreases cardiac NO content, however, cholesterol diet-induced inhibition of the mevalonate pathway does not account for the decreased NO level in the heart, and that the mevalonate pathway does not influence cardiac NO biosynthesis.", 
    "12": "The treatment of hypercholesterolemia may be associated with greater noncardiac mortality. This current pilot study sought to determine which behaviors, if any, are associated with decreases in cholesterol level. Twelve subjects received one of two cholesterol-reducing drugs or placebo. Cholesterol and behavioral ratings were measured at baseline, 4, and 52 weeks with standardized scales. Cholesterol levels markedly declined with concomitant significant increases in impulsivity ratings at 4 weeks. At 52 weeks, the increase in impulsivity ratings was no longer apparent, but depression ratings showed a significant improvement. This pilot study, although limited in size, raises the possibility that cholesterol-lowering drugs are associated with mild, time-limited increases in impulsivity and with mild, time-delayed improvements in depression ratings.", 
    "13": "Hyperhomocysteinemia is regarded as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Lipid-lowering agents, such as fibrates, can modify homocysteine levels. However, less is known about the effect of statin therapy on homocysteine. The authors compared the effects of atorvastatin (40 mg/day), simvastatin (40 mg/day), and micronized fenofibrate (200 mg/day) on the serum concentrations of total homocysteine, vitamin B12, and folic acid in patients with primary hyperlipidemia. A total of 128 patients with primary hyperlipidemia (total cholesterol > 240 mg/dL and triglycerides < 350 mg/dL) were assigned to atorvastatin, simvastatin, or fenofibrate. Serum lipid and metabolic parameters were measured at baseline and at 6 and 12 weeks of treatment. Homocysteine correlated positively with serum creatinine and uric acid levels and inversely with serum folic acid levels. All treatment modalities reduced total, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels significantly increased only in the fenofibrate-treated patients (47.9 +/- 12.5 vs. 50.7 +/- 12.6 vs. 51.2 +/- 12.8 mg/dL, p < 0.01). Atorvastatin and fenofibrate treatment resulted in a significant reduction of serum uric acid levels (5.3 +/- 1.6 vs. 4.9 +/- 1.4 vs. 4.8 +/- 1.4 mg/dL, p < 0.0001 for atorvastatin; 5.6 +/- 1.6 vs. 4.3 +/- 1.4 vs. 4.4 +/- 1.4 mg/dL, p < 0.0001 for fenofibrate). Homocysteine levels were significantly increased only by fenofibrate (10.3 +/- 3.3 vs. 14.1 +/- 3.8 vs. 14.2 +/- 3.6 microU/L, p < 0.001) but did not change from baseline following statin treatment. Neither statins nor fenofibrate had any effect on serum vitamin B12 and folic acid levels. In contrast to fenofibrate, therapeutic dosages of atorvastatin and simvastatin have a neutral effect on serum homocysteine levels, which is in favor of their \"cardioprotective\" properties.", 
    "14": "Hypercholesterolemia causes endothelial dysfunction, an early feature of atherosclerosis, leading to increased production of adhesion molecules and cytokines. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of three months of treatment with low dose atorvastatin on serum levels of adhesion molecules, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in patients with non-familial hypercholesterolemia. Fifty-five patients with non-familial hypercholesterolemia were randomized to treatment with atorvastatin 10 mg/day or placebo for 3 months. Soluble intercellular adhesion molecules-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), E-selectin, IL-6 and hs-CRP levels were measured to assess the inflammatory activity of the endothelium. There was a significant reduction in ICAM-1 at 2 weeks (p<0.0001) with further reduction at 3 months (p<0.0001). At 3 months, there were significant reductions in VCAM-1 (p<0.02), IL-6 (p<0.0001) and hs-CRP (p<0.01), but an increase in E-selectin levels (p<0.002). Treatment with statin was an independent determinant of change in ICAM-1 (p<0.05) and IL-6 levels (p<0.05) after correcting for anthropometric indices, blood pressure and lipid profile. Low-dose atorvastatin treatment leads to reduction in proinflammatory markers of endothelial function, suggesting an attenuation of endothelial activation and improvement in endothelial function, independent of lipid lowering. This may lead to a reduction in the progression of atherosclerosis.", 
    "15": "Human adipose tissue is a main contributor to plasma levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-6. How IL-6 expression is regulated in adipocytes remains unclear. In the current study, we investigated the effect of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, cerivastatin, on the production of IL-6 from cultured human adipocytes. Cerivastatin reduced both IL-6 mRNA and secretion in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The inhibitory effect on IL-6 mRNA was prevented by the intermediates of the cholesterol synthesis pathway, mevalonate and geranyl-geranyl-phyrophosphate (GGPP) but not by farnesyl-pyrophosphate. This suggests the involvement of geranylgeranyl-modified intermediates in the effect of cerivastatin on IL-6. Moreover, cerivastatin induced an inactivation of the phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of NFkappaB which was prevented by GGPP. Our data suggest that cerivastatin exerts an anti-inflammatory effect by down-regulating IL-6 levels in adipocytes, which seems to be mediated by reduced production of GGPP and interference with the NFkappaB pathway.", 
    "16": "Diverse forms of injury cause proximal tubular cholesterol accumulation. However, underlying mechanisms in general, and those involved with ATP depletion injury in particular, remain poorly defined. To help elucidate this issue, cholesterol homeostasis and its determinants were assessed after partial ATP depletion states. Serum-exposed HK-2 cells were subjected to mild ATP depletion, induced by mitochondrial inhibition (antimycin A; AA) or glycolytic blockade (2-deoxyglucose; DG). Four or 18 h later, cell cholesterol levels, hydroxymethylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase (HMGCR), the LDL receptor (LDL-R), and ABCA1/SR-B1 cholesterol transporters were assessed. AA and DG each induced mild, largely sublethal ATP depletion injury. Each also caused significant HMGCR increments and SR-B1 decrements and left ABCA1 intact. In contrast, only AA increased the LDL-R, and only AA evoked a cholesterol-loading state (approximately 25% up). One-half of this increase was statin inhibitable, and one-half could be blocked by serum deletion, implying that both synthetic and nonsynthetic (e.g., LDL-R transport) pathways were involved. The AA-induced HMGCR and LDL-R protein changes were paralleled by their mRNAs, suggesting the presence of altered transcriptional events. We conclude that 1) sublethal ATP depletion, whether induced by mitochondrial or glycolytic blockade, can upregulate HMGCR and decrease SR-B1, and these changes represent a previously unrecognized ATP depletion \"phenotype\"; 2) mitochondrial blockade can also upregulate the LDL-R and evoke a cholesterol-loading state; 3) the latter likely occurs via synthetic and transport pathways; and 4) the mitochondrion may be a critical, and previously unrecognized, determinant of postinjury cell cholesterol homeostasis, potentially by impacting the LDL-R.", 
    "17": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors reduce cardiovascular mortality, although the mechanisms of action have not been completely elucidated. The presence of T cells and apoptotic cells in atherosclerotic plaques is well established, the reduction of cellular content being a marker of their vulnerability. One of the main mechanisms of cell death activation is the Fas-Fas ligand (FasL) system.", 
    "18": "We studied whether HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors can regulate FasL expression and cytotoxicity in human T cells (Jurkat cells). Activation of Jurkat cells with phorbol esters and ionomycin increased FasL expression, an effect prevented by atorvastatin or simvastatin. Mevalonate and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate but not farnesylpyrophosphate prevented the effect of atorvastatin, indicating that protein geranylation was involved in FasL expression. The C3 exotoxin, which selectively inactivates Rho proteins, also decreased FasL expression on T cells. Overexpression of constitutively active RhoA increased FasL expression in Jurkat cells, and dominant-negative RhoA decreased FasL expression in activated cells, indicating that RhoA is implicated in FasL expression. Atorvastatin also decreased cytotoxic activity of activated Jurkat cells on FasL-sensitive cells. Finally, atorvastatin treatment reduced FasL expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and human carotid atherosclerotic plaques.", 
    "19": "Atorvastatin regulates FasL expression in T cells, probably because of the inhibition of RhoA prenylation. These results provide novel information by which atorvastatin may regulate the cytotoxic activity of T cells and the number of cells in the atherosclerotic plaque.", 
    "20": "Cholesterol modification reduces cardiovascular events in patients with atherosclerosis, including those with peripheral arterial disease. The purpose of this study was to determine whether cholesterol lowering with atorvastatin improves walking performance in patients with intermittent claudication.", 
    "21": "This randomized, double-blind, parallel-design study included 354 persons with claudication attributable to peripheral arterial disease. Patients were treated with placebo, atorvastatin (10 mg per day), or atorvastatin (80 mg per day) for 12 months. The outcome measures included change in treadmill exercise time and patient-reported measures of physical activity and quality of life based on questionnaires. Maximal walking time after 12 months of treatment with atorvastatin did not change significantly. However, there was improvement in pain-free walking time after 12 months of treatment for the 80-mg (P=0.025) group compared with placebo. A physical activity questionnaire demonstrated improvement in ambulatory ability for the 10- and 80-mg groups (P=0.011), whereas 2 quality of life instruments, the Walking Impairment Questionnaire and Short Form 36 Questionnaire, did not show significant change.", 
    "22": "Atorvastatin improves pain-free walking distance and community-based physical activity in patients with intermittent claudication. When treated with atorvastatin, patients with peripheral arterial disease may experience improvement in symptoms to complement the anticipated reduction in cardiovascular events reported in other studies of statins.", 
    "23": "Diabetes mellitus, specifically type 2, is often associated with disorders in lipid metabolism. Elevated levels of plasma free fatty acids play a pivotal role by contributing significantly to insulin resistance. In addition free fatty acids promote diabetic dyslipidemia through increasing VLDL synthesis in the liver, and by virtue of cholesterylester transfer protein, modifying LDL to increase small-dense LDL subfractions and to decrease HDL cholesterol. This atherogenic lipoprotein profile (elevated triglycerides, increased small-dense low-density lipoproteins, and decreased high-density lipoproteins), contributes to the development of atherosclerosis and increases the risk of experiencing cardiovascular events, the most common cause of death in type 2 diabetes. To decrease the risk of cardiovascular disease events in diabetics, dyslipidemia needs to be treated, as evidenced from epidemiology, from intervention trials, and from subgroup analyses of large intervention trials initiated to evaluate effects of lipid lowering treatment that also included patients with type 2 diabetes. Most measures used to counteract hyperglycemia, are also prone to ameliorate dyslipidemia: dietary intervention (medical nutrition) including omega-3 fatty acids as part of lifestyle changes that also comprise cessation of smoking, increases in physical activity and reduction in body weight. In addition insulin, biguanides, acarbose and glitazones applied for glycemic control also improve diabetic dyslipidemia. Additional pharmacological treatment of dyslipidemia if persisting after glycemic control relies on different drug classes. Fibrates effectively reduce free fatty acids, fasting and postprandial lipemia, shift the distribution of LDL particles towards less dense subfractions and increase HDL cholesterol, thus particularly addressing key components of diabetic dyslipidemia. For LDL cholesterol lowering statins are mainly used that decrease LDL cholesterol levels by competitive inhibition of the HMG-CoA reductase. As type 2 diabetes is found to be associated with a two- to fourfold increase in coronary heart disease risk and as the degree of glycemia is more related to microvascular complications, correcting dyslipidemia appears to be a major task in order to reduce macrovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes.", 
    "24": "We examined whether fluvastatin (FV), a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, has antioxidant activity against oxidative DNA damage to hamster pancreas induced by a chemical carcinogen, N-nitrosobis(2-oxopropyl)amine (BOP). Female Syrian golden hamsters were treated with FV by gastric intubation 30 min before BOP administration. Control animals were intubated with saline. Animals were injected subcutaneously with BOP (20 mg/kg body weight) or saline, and sacrificed 1 and 4 h later. The contents of 8-oxo-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-oxodG) in the nuclear DNA and thiobarbituric acid-reacting substances (TBARS) were measured in the pancreas and liver of hamsters. Treatment with more than 0.22 mg/kg body weight FV significantly inhibited the increase in 8-oxodG content induced by BOP treatment. The TBARS contents in pancreas changed similarly by intubation of FV. In the liver, the contents of 8-oxodG and TBARS were not affected by a single administration of BOP. The protective effect of FV was stronger than those of pravastatin and other antioxidants such as Trolox, ascorbic acid and green tea catechin. These results suggest that FV inhibits oxidative damage to DNA and lipids caused by reactive oxygen species formed through the metabolism of chemical carcinogens.", 
    "25": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the deposition of beta-amyloid (A beta) plaques derived from the amyloidogenic processing; of a transmembrane protein called beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP). In addition to the known genetic/sporadic factors that promote the formation of A beta, the composition and structural dynamics of the membrane are also thought to play a significant role in the amyloidogenic processing of APP that promotes seeding of A beta. This minireview reinforces the roles played by membrane dynamics, membrane microdomains, and cholesterol homeostasis in relation to amyloidogenesis, and reviews current strategies of lowering cholesterol in treating AD.", 
    "26": "Modulation of the cytoskeletal architecture was shown to regulate the expression of CTGF (connective tissue growth factor, CCN2). The microtubule disrupting agents nocodazole and colchicine strongly up-regulated CTGF expression, which was prevented upon stabilization of the microtubules by paclitaxel. As a consequence of microtubule disruption, RhoA was activated and the actin stress fibers were stabilized. Both effects were related to CTGF induction. Overexpression of constitutively active RhoA induced CTGF synthesis. Interference with RhoA signaling by simvastatin, toxinB, C3 toxin, and Y27632 prevented up-regulation of CTGF. Likewise, direct disintegration of the actin cytoskeleton by latrunculin B interfered with nocodazole-mediated up-regulation of CTGF expression. Disassembly of actin fibers by cytochalasin D, however, unexpectedly increased CTGF expression indicating that the content of F-actin per se was not the major determinant for CTGF gene expression. Given the fact that cytochalasin D sequesters G-actin, a decrease in G-actin increased CTGF, while increased levels of G-actin corresponded to reduced CTGF expression. These data link alterations in the microtubule and actin cytoskeleton to the expression of CTGF and provide a molecular basis for the observation that CTGF is up-regulated in cells exposed to mechanical stress.", 
    "27": "This article reviews the pharmacokinetic properties of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (or statins), as reported in humans. Most data presented here refer to commercially available statins (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin and simvastatin), although statins that have recently been withdrawn (cerivastatin) or are currently under development (glenvastatin, pitavastatin and rosuvastatin) will also be considered. All statins with the exception of pitavastatin show very low systemic bioavailability due to an extensive first pass effect at the intestinal and/or hepatic level. Such a characteristic can be advantageous, since the liver is the target organ for statins. Unlike most statins, lovastatin and simvastatin are administered as inactive lactone prodrugs. Statins differ mainly in the degree of metabolism and the number of active and inactive metabolites. All statins but pravastatin show highly active metabolites, the pharmacological activity depending on the kinetic profile of both parent compound and active metabolites. Pravastatin has the lowest protein binding (50% vs. > 90%) and is eliminated by both metabolism and renal excretion. Atorvastatin shows the longest terminal half-life (11-14 h vs. 1-3 h). Pharmacokinetic interactions with statins are very likely to occur, particularly for those statins that are CYP3A4 substrates. However, although of extreme interest in clinical practice, this subject was extensively reviewed in a previous article and therefore is not discussed here.", 
    "28": "Elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol is an important risk factor for atherothrombotic arterial disease. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, or statins, are very effective in lowering cholesterol levels, and several trials using statins have shown reductions in mortality and cardiovascular events, leading to the recent recommendations that all patients with known vascular disease, or who are at high risk for vascular disease, should be considered candidates for statin therapy. Yet statins reduce cardiovascular events by only about 20%-40%. Nonstatin therapies (either as monotherapy or in addition to statins) to reduce LDL cholesterol by mechanisms that do not involve inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase are likely to be useful for patients in need of LDL reduction; particularly those who either cannot take statins or respond only partially or not at all to statins alone. These therapies include cholesterol absorption inhibitors, Acyl-CoA cholesterol acyl transferase inhibitors, farnesoid X receptor antagonists, sterol-regulating binding protein cleavage activating protein, and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein.", 
    "29": "The expression of the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase (NOS2) is reduced in cystic fibrosis (CF) epithelium despite the presence of aggressive inflammation. A potential mechanism for reduced NOS2 expression in CF is diminished signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1) activity, possibly due to an increase in expression of protein inhibitor of activated STAT1 (PIAS1). Previous evidence also suggests that NOS2 expression can be negatively regulated by increased activation of the GTPase RhoA, leading to the hypothesis that CF-related increases in PIAS1 expression and altered STAT1 signaling may be mediated by Rho GTPase function. Consistent with this hypothesis, data demonstrate increased expression of RhoA in two models of CF epithelium with a proportional increase in the active GTP-bound RhoA. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts null for p190B Rho GTPase-activating protein exhibit increased RhoA protein content and activation, similar to what is observed in CF models, and also exhibit CF-like alterations in STAT1 regulation, including decreased STAT1 activation, increased PIAS1 protein expression, and reduced NOS2 induction, implicating RhoA-mediated signaling in CF-related STAT1 alterations. Inhibition of the Rho GTPase pathway at the level of isoprenoid/cholesterol synthesis with mevastatin reduces PIAS1 expression, increases STAT1 activation, and restores NOS2 expression in models of CF epithelium, suggesting that pharmacological inhibition of the isoprenoid synthesis/Rho GTPase pathway may represent a potential avenue for therapeutic intervention for CF.", 
    "30": "The aim of this article is to examine the benefit-risk profile of rosuvastatin at doses of 10 to 40 mg. In dyslipidemic patients, rosuvastatin produced markedly greater reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and equivalent or greater improvements in various lipid measures, including high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides when compared with atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin. In addition, rosuvastatin is more effective than these statins in allowing patients to reach National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III and Joint European Societies LDL cholesterol goals. The safety profile of rosuvastatin was reviewed (as of April 2003) in 12,569 patients, representing 14,231 patient-years of treatment at doses up to 80 mg. In controlled trials, rosuvastatin 10 to 40 mg demonstrated a similar adverse event profile to those for atorvastatin 10 to 80 mg, simvastatin 10 to 80 mg, and pravastatin 10 to 40 mg. Myopathy (defined as muscle symptoms plus serum creatine kinase levels >10 times the upper limit of normal) attributed to rosuvastatin occurred in < or = 0.03% of patients receiving rosuvastatin 10 to 40 mg. No cases of rhabdomyolysis occurred in patients receiving rosuvastatin 10 to 40 mg. Clinically significant alanine aminotransferase elevations occurred in 0.2% of patients receiving rosuvastatin and those receiving atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin. Compared with other widely used statins, the benefit-risk profile of rosuvastatin 10 to 40 mg appears to be very favorable.", 
    "31": "Inflammation is a major factor in atherothrombotic disease. Levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), a marker of systemic inflammation and a mediator of atherothrombotic disease, have been shown to correlate with cardiovascular disease risk. Recent findings in 27,939 healthy women in the Women's Health Study indicate that hs-CRP (1) is a stronger predictor of risk than low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, (2) predicts elevated risk in subjects without overt hyperlipidemia, and (3) adds prognostic information to risk scoring and LDL cholesterol categories. Other data from this cohort show that hs-CRP level adds prognostic information to the diagnosis of the metabolic syndrome. Taken together with other data in men on the association of hs-CRP with vascular risk, a strong argument is provided for screening in the primary prevention population. With regard to potential treatment, statins have been found to reduce hs-CRP levels, and data from statin treatment trials raise the possibility that subjects with elevated hs-CRP levels may derive greater benefit from treatment than do patients without elevated hs-CRP. The Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) trial is planned to examine the effects of rosuvastatin treatment in preventing cardiovascular events in 15,000 healthy subjects with elevated hs-CRP levels in the absence of overt hyperlipidemia.", 
    "32": "Lipid-lowering guidelines continue to evolve toward the use of (1) global risk assessment, (2) lipid measures other than or in addition to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in assessment of risk and treatment benefit, and (3) recommendations for more aggressive lipid lowering. Findings in the Heart Protection Study (HPS) indicate that high-risk patients benefit from statin therapy initiated at a dose that provides aggressive lowering of LDL cholesterol. Statin treatment in this trial provided consistent benefits in reducing major vascular events among a wide variety of high-risk patients, including those beginning treatment with LDL cholesterol levels <100 mg/dL. The HPS findings therefore suggest that the optimal LDL cholesterol level is well below current target levels. In addition, they provide reassurance that aggressive statin therapy is safe. Frequently, current targets for LDL cholesterol are not achieved in clinical practice, particularly among those patients who have coronary artery disease or are at high risk of disease. More intensive lipid lowering than that currently practiced is necessary to achieve current goals and to provide the aggressive reduction of LDL cholesterol shown to improve outcomes in clinical trials. New statins, such as rosuvastatin, offer the prospect of improved lipid-lowering therapy.", 
    "33": "Even though the clinical effectiveness of the presently used pharmaceutical therapy of sporadic Alzheimer Disease seems to be proven sufficient, their effective mechanisms are much less known or are disregarded in the evaluation of the clinical effects. However, it seems to be inevitable to know both clinical effect and effective mechanisms of pharmaceutics in order to be able to judge their adversity and benefit. In reference to the pharmaceutics implemented on sporadic AD in Germany, total different effective mechanisms are shown. In consideration of the shown pathomechanisms which have been recognized for sporadic AD, therapeutic rationales on application of Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb 761) and Memantine are evident. The application of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, often looked on as agent of choice, is to be considered critically because of the danger of the occurrence of myopathological dysfunction, resp. the Gulf War Syndrome. Sophisticated and hastily advertised therapy strategies with statins or vaccination against beta A4 should not be used because of a lack of sufficient evidence based on the pathophysiological pattern of damage as known in sporadic AD. Future development must take in account that with sporadic AD aging influences cannot or can hardly be influenced. Therapeutic goals should consist to improve the cellular energy status and the membrane functioning.", 
    "34": "Rac is a member of the Rho family of small guanosine triphosphatases that regulate the actin cytoskeleton. Activation of Rac requires lipid modification that can be blocked by statins. Lipopolysaccharide-induced rearrangements in the actin cytoskeleton lead to changes in cell adhesion and motility that play a role in the cellular response to infection. The lipid products of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) modulate Rac effector pathways and have been linked to the activation of the Rac-guanosine triphosphatase. We hypothesize that lipopolysaccharide stimulation leads to Rac activation and that this may be inhibited by statin pretreatment. Furthermore, signaling downstream of Rac is linked to PI3K; therefore, we hypothesize that a signaling complex between PI3K and Rac may be involved.", 
    "35": "THP-1 cells were maintained in 1% fetal calf serum with or without 20 micromol/L mevastatin for 24 hours, followed by lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Active Rac was precipitated from THP-1 total cell lysate and then detected by immunoblotting. The PI3K-Rac complex was immunoprecipitated from total cell lysate, and the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K was detected by immunoblotting.",

    "38": "Several recent epidemiological studies have proposed that cholesterol-lowering drug Statin may provide protection against Alzheimer's disease (AD). Probucol is a non-Statin cholesterol-lowering drug and a potent inducer of apolipoprotein E (apoE) production in peripheral circulation. A recent clinical study using Probucol in elderly AD subjects revealed a concomitant stabilisation of cognitive symptoms and significant increases in apoE levels in the cerebral spinal fluid in these patients. To gain insight into the mechanisms underlying these effects, we treated a cohort of aged male rats (26-month-old) with oral dose of Probucol for 30 days. Specifically, we examined the effects of Probucol on apoE production and its receptors (low density lipoprotein receptor [LDLr] and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein [LRP]), astroglial marker of cell damage (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]), markers of neuronal synaptic plasticity and integrity (synaptosomal associated protein of 25 kDa [SNAP-25] and synaptophysin) as well as cholesterol biosynthesis (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase [HMGCoAr]) in the hippocampus. We report that Probucol induces the production of apoE and one of its main receptors, LRP, increases HMGCoAr (rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis), substantially attenuates age-related increases in glial activation, and induces production of synaptic marker SNAP-25, a molecule commonly associated with synaptogenesis and dendritic remodeling. These findings suggest that Probucol could promote neural and synaptic plasticity to counteract the synaptic deterioration associated with brain aging through an apoE/LRP-mediated system. Consistent with the beneficial effects of other cholesterol-lowering drugs such as the Statin, Probucol could also offers additional benefits based on apoE neurobiology.", 
    "39": "We compared the amount of new bone produced by statin collagen grafts with that produced by collagen grafts. Fifteen bone defects were created in the parietal bone of nine New Zealand White rabbits. In the experimental group, five defects were grafted with simvastatin dissolved in water for injection mixed with absorbable collagen sponge. In the control groups, five defects were grafted with water for injection mixed with absorbable collagen sponge alone (active control) and five were left empty (passive control). Animals were killed on day 14 and the defects were prepared for histological assessment. Serial sections were cut across the whole defect. Quantitative analysis of new bone formation was made on 100 sections using image analysis. A total of 308% more new bone was present in defects grafted with statin collagen grafts than those grafted with collagen grafts alone (P<0.0001). No bone was formed in the passive control group. In conclusion, statin collagen grafts were osteoinductive and can be used as a material for bone grafts.", 
    "40": "The aim of this study was to test the feasibility of cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for assessment of the infarcted rat and mouse heart and to compare the results with established methods. These models have been proven to predict genesis and prevention of heart failure in patients. The value of cine MRI was tested in studies investigating interventions to change the course of the remodeling process. MRI was performed for determination of left ventricular (LV) volumes and mass, myocardial infarct (MI) size and cardiac output. LV wet weight was determined after MRI. Rats underwent conventional hemodynamic measurements for determination of cardiac output and LV volumes by electromagnetic flowmeter and pressure-volume curves. Infarct size was determined by histology. MRI-acquired MI-size (18.5+/-2%) was smaller than that found by histology (22.8+/-2.5%, p<0.05) with close correlation (r=0.97). There was agreement in LV mass between MRI and wet weight (r=0.97, p<0.05) and in the MRI- and flowmeter measurements of cardiac output (r=0.80, p<0.05). Volume by MRI differed from pressure-volume curves with good correlation (r=0.96, p<0.05). In a serial study of mice after coronary ligation, LV hypertrophy at 8 weeks was detected (Sham 105.1+/-7.9 mg, MI 144.4+/-11.7 mg, p<0.05). Left ventricles were enlarged in infarcted mice (end-diastolic volume, week 8: Sham 63.5+/-4 microl, MI 94.2 microl, p<0.05). In conclusion, cine MRI is a valuable diagnostic tool applicable to the rat and mouse model of MI. Being non-invasive and exact it offers new insights into the remodeling process after MI because serial measurements are possible. The technique was applied to study several interventions and proved its usefulness.", 
    "41": "We have explored the therapeutic potential of statins in patients with different inflammatory rheumatic diseases refractory to conventional therapy. We found that simvastatin (80mg o.d. for eight days) induced a rapid and significant reduction in proteinuria levels in three systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. A similar kind of therapy had a marked beneficial effect in a patient with Wegener's granulomatosis and a patient with erythema nodosum. On the other hand, five patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who received atorvastatin for eight days (20mg/day) showed reduction in C-reactive protein levels and a clinical improvement that was classified as an ACR20 response. Prior to the administration of statins, all these patients had received aggressive conventional therapy with no satisfactory response. A significant reduction in spontaneous apoptosis of peripheral blood lymphocytes and expression of CD69 and HLA-DR was observed in SLE patients after simvastatin therapy. These results prompted us to perform a pilot short-time comparative (simvastatin versus chloroquine) open clinical trial in 15 patients with RA who were receiving methotrexate as a single disease modifying antirheumatic drug with no satisfactory response. Most patients (9/10) who received simvastatin (40mg/day) showed an ACR50 or better response after eight weeks, whereas such a response was not observed in any patient (0/5) treated with chloroquine. Our preliminary results indicate that statins may be an important therapeutic tool for the treatment of inflammatory rheumatic diseases.",

    "50": "IGF-I acts on vascular endothelium to activate nitric oxide synthase, thereby promoting vascular health; there is reason to believe that this protection is especially crucial to the cerebral vasculature, helping to ward off thrombotic strokes. IGF-I may also promote the structural integrity of cerebral arteries, thereby offering protection from hemorrhagic stroke. These considerations may help to explain why tallness is associated with low stroke risk, whereas growth hormone deficiency increases stroke risk--and why age-adjusted stroke mortality has been exceptionally high in rural Asians eating quasi-vegan diets, but has been declining steadily in Asia as diets have become progressively higher in animal products. There is good reason to suspect that low-fat vegan diets tend to down-regulate systemic IGF-I activity; this effect would be expected to increase stroke risk in vegans. Furthermore, epidemiology suggests that low serum cholesterol, and possibly also a low dietary intake of saturated fat--both characteristic of those adopting low-fat vegan diets--may also increase stroke risk. Vegans are thus well advised to adopt practical countermeasures to minimize stroke risk--the most definitive of which may be salt restriction. A high potassium intake, aerobic exercise training, whole grains, moderate alcohol consumption, low-dose aspirin, statin or policosanol therapy, green tea, and supplementation with fish oil, taurine, arginine, and B vitamins--as well as pharmacotherapy of hypertension if warranted--are other practical measures for lowering stroke risk. Although low-fat vegan diets may markedly reduce risk for coronary disease, diabetes, and many common types of cancer, an increased risk for stroke may represent an 'Achilles heel'. Nonetheless, vegans have the potential to achieve a truly exceptional 'healthspan' if they face this problem forthrightly by restricting salt intake and taking other practical measures that promote cerebrovascular health.",

    "56": "Rosuvastatin is a new synthetic statin that produces a more potent and prolonged inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase than any of the other statins currently available. It is also characterised by a very low lipophilicity, which is close to that of pravastatin, and by a high hepatic selectivity. Rosuvastatin is not extensively metabolised, with little or no transformation by the different isoenzymes of cytochrome P450. It is mainly eliminated in the faeces, with an elimination half-life in humans of between 13 and 21 hours. In patients with hypercholesterolaemia, rosuvastatin was associated with large dose-dependent reductions in low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, by 50.5% at a dose of 10 mg/day and up to 64.8% at a dose of 80 mg. Each doubling of the dose of rosuvastatin results in an additional 4.5% decrease in blood LDL-cholesterol. In phase III studies, rosuvastatin decreased LDL-cholesterol significantly more than atorvastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin. Compared with the other statins, the decrease in triglyceride levels was similar and the increase in high density lipoprotein-cholesterol was more marked, with a significant difference in most cases. To date, there has not been an excess of adverse reactions, especially liver or muscle problems, compared with the reference statins. The safety of rosuvastatin can only be definitively established in post-marketing surveys.", 
    "57": "It was recently proposed that people with a high absolute cardiovascular risk, for example those aged 55 years and over, might considerably benefit from a combined pill that includes proven treatments such as a statins, antihypertensives, antiplatelet therapy and folic acid. Although conceptually attractive, certain negative effects need to be considered. A strategy to treat the population aged 55 years and over might yield large benefits in high-risk patients with fairly normal values for risk factors that are currently often left untreated. It may, however, also lead to the undertreatment of patients with abnormally high values of individual risk factors and to the overtreatment of low-risk patients. In these low-risk patients, the side effects of aspirin and blood-pressure lowering treatment might outweigh the benefits. Due to the high costs and also the availability of generic drugs, it is difficult to envision trials that will address these issues. Therefore, the acceptance and implementation of this intriguing concept by health authorities and insurance companies remains doubtful.", 
    "58": "Mevalonate metabolites are vital for a variety of key cellular functions with the biosynthetic products including cholesterol and farnesyl and geranylgeranyl isoprenoids. Inhibition of this pathway using lovastatin induces a potent apoptotic response in a specific subset of human tumor-derived cell lines, including head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC). In this study, we evaluated the potential of a number of chemotherapeutics that demonstrate activity in HNSCC, including an inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) to potentiate the cytotoxic effects of lovastatin.", 
    "59": "We evaluated the cytotoxic effects of combining a variety of chemotherapeutics with lovastatin using the MTT assay and flow cytometry. The MCF-7 lovastatin-resistant breast adenocarcinoma cell line and the lovastatin-sensitive HNSCC cell lines SCC9 and SCC25 were tested. Expression levels of EGFR and ligand activated EGFR following lovastatin treatment were analyzed by Western blotting.", 
    "60": "Pretreatment or concomitant treatment of 10 microM lovastatin did not significantly augment the effects of a variety of chemotherapeutic agents tested in these cell lines. Co-administration with actinomycin D or cycloheximide, drugs that inhibit RNA and protein synthesis, respectively, inhibited lovastatin-induced apoptosis in these cell lines. This suggests a requirement for the cellular functions disrupted by these chemotherapeutic agents in lovastatin-induced apoptosis of HNSCC cells. In contrast to the chemotherapeutics analyzed, the AG1478 tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the EGFR demonstrated additive cytotoxic effects in combination with lovastatin in HNSCC cells. Mevalonate metabolites may regulate EGFR function, suggesting that lovastatin may inhibit the activity of this receptor. Indeed, lovastatin treatment inhibited EGF-induced autophosphorylation of the EGFR in the SCC9 and SCC25 cell lines. Pretreatment of SCC9 and SCC25 cell lines for 24 h with 10 microM lovastatin, conditions that demonstrated significant inhibition of EGF-induced EGFR autophosphorylation, induced significant additive effects in combination with AG1478.",

The aim was to assess the impact of these factors on autonomic nitrergic nerve and endothelial function. Thus, the effects of diabetes and treatment with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor rosuvastatin (RSV) were examined on corpus cavernosum and aorta from streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice in a 4-week prevention study and a 2-week intervention study, following 4 weeks of untreated diabetes. Cotreatment with mevalonate was used to assess the dependence of RSV's effects on HMG-CoA reductase blockade. Diabetes caused a 25% reduction in NO-mediated endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine for aorta and cavernosum. Relaxations of cavernosum were in the nondiabetic range following prevention or reversal treatment. The aortic deficit was completely prevented and 60% reversed by RSV. Maximum NO-dependent nonadrenergic, noncholinergic nerve-mediated relaxations of cavernosum were reduced 25-33% by diabetes. RSV treatment prevented 75% and reversed 71% of this diabetic deficit. Cotreatment with mevalonate inhibited the beneficial actions of RSV on aorta and cavernosum. Total plasma cholesterol was unaltered by diabetes or treatment. Thus, RSV corrected defective NO-mediated nerve and vascular function in diabetic mice independent of cholesterol lowering but via effects dependent on cholesterol biosynthesis pathway inhibition.",

The annual relapse rate of patients treated with these drugs is lower than that in placebo-treated patients, and more treated patients remain relapse-free compared with untreated patients. In addition, these compounds reduce the development of new lesions, as detected by MRI.", 
    "64": "The limited effectiveness of approved treatments for MS, as well as reports of adverse events and toxicity, emphasise the need for the development of new therapies with improved efficacy and fewer side-effects. Clinical observations, increased understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of the disease, and advances in biotechnology have led to several new therapeutic approaches to the treatment of MS that are currently under investigation. WHERE NEXT? Mitoxantrone has recently been shown to produce benefit when used to treat patients with progressive MS; it may also be an effective second-line treatment for patients who do not respond to interferon beta or glatiramer acetate. Over the past few years, several studies have drawn attention to the potential of natalizumab, alemtuzumab, statins, and oestrogens as effective treatments for MS. These drugs are at different stages of clinical development and additional clinical data are needed to support their use and devise dosage regimens. However, they are important and attractive candidates for several reasons: they counteract a fundamental and well-defined pathophysiological process; they have a less cumbersome route of administration than interferon beta and glatiramer acetate; or they have a remarkable safety record.",

Pharmacological treatment of AD is based on the use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, which have beneficial effects on cognitive, functional, and behavioural symptoms of the disease, but their role in AD pathogenesis is unknown. Other pharmacological therapies are becoming available--including the recently approved drug memantine, an NMDA channel blocker indicated for advanced AD. Here, we review clinical features of the available cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine) including their pharmacological properties, the evidence for switching from one agent to another, \"head to head\" studies, and the emerging evidence for the use of memantine in AD. New therapeutic approaches--including those more closely targeted to the pathogenesis of the disease--will also be reviewed.

Human testis, ovary, heart, placenta, and pancreas express relatively high level of hIPS mRNA, while blood leukocyte, thymus, skeletal muscle, and colon express low or marginal amount of the mRNA. In the presence of glucose, hIPS mRNA level increases 2- to 4-fold in HepG2 cells. hIPS mRNA is also up-regulated 2- to 3-fold by 2.5 microM lovastain. This up-regulation is prevented by mevalonic acid, farnesol, and geranylgeraniol, suggesting a G-protein mediated signal transduction mechanism in the regulation of hIPS gene expression. hIPS mRNA expression is 50% suppressed by 10mM lithium ion in these cells. Neither 5mM myo-inositol nor the three hormones: estrogen, thyroid hormone, and insulin altered hIPS mRNA expression in these cells.",

The HC diet alone resulted in a plasma cholesterol concentration of 18.9+/-1.4 mmol/L, and administration of rosuvastatin lowered plasma cholesterol to 14.1+/-0.7 mmol/L. In a separate low-cholesterol (LC) control group, the dietary cholesterol intake was reduced, which resulted in plasma cholesterol levels that were comparable to the HC+R group (13.4+/-0.8 mmol/L). Atherosclerosis in the aortic root area was quantified after 24 weeks. As compared with the HC group, the LC group had a 62% (P<0.001) reduction in cross-sectional lesion area.

We examined effects of pitavastatin (NK-104), a relatively novel and long acting statin, on expression of tissue factor (TF) in human monocytes (U-937), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) in human aortic smooth muscle cells (SMC) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). In monocytes, pitavastatin reduced expression of TF protein induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (OxLDL). Similarly, pitavastatin also reduced expression of TF mRNA induced by LPS. Pitavastatin reduced PAI-1 antigen released from HUVEC under basal, OxLDL-, or tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-stimulated conditions. Reductions of PAI-1 mRNA expression correlated with decreased PAI-1 antigen secretion and PAI-1 activity as assessed by fibrin-agarose zymography. In addition, pitavastatin decreased PAI-1 antigen released from OxLDL-treated and untreated SMC. Conversely, pitavastatin enhanced t-PA mRNA expression and t-PA antigen secretion in untreated OxLDL-, and TNF-alpha-treated HUVEC and untreated SMC. Finally, pitavastatin increased t-PA activity as assessed by fibrin-agarose zymography.

New attention, however, is being turned toward preventative treatments such as vitamin E, estrogen, and lipid-lowering agents. Preventative treatments focus on intervening prior to the onset of disease. These treatments are designed to modify the amyloid load. These new approaches require designs that select nonimpaired or minimally impaired populations, using new outcomes with prolonged assessment. The cost of these studies is high, but the potential benefit of delay or prevention of disease is the valuable goal.", 
    "83": "Dyslipidemia is one of the most important modifiable risk factors for coronary disease. Despite the availability of highly effective lipid-modifying agents, many patients still do not reach lipid targets established by national guidelines. Niacin has been known to be an effective treatment of dyslipidemia for almost half a century. Niacin substantially increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels while lowering levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides, and lipoprotein(a). In addition, niacin converts small LDL particles into more buoyant, less atherogenic LDL particles. Combined with other agents, niacin offers an important treatment option for patients with dyslipidemia. In particular, niacin complements LDL-C-lowering drugs; it is the most effective agent available for increasing HDL-C levels while lowering levels of LDL-C and triglycerides and improving other lipid risk factors such as lipoprotein(a). Combining niacin with statins or bile acid sequestrant therapy is safe and effective for improving lipid levels and decreasing coronary risk. Differences in niacin formulations dictate tolerability profiles and should be considered when selecting niacin as part of lipid therapy. Furthermore, adverse effects on glucose and insulin sensitivity should be considered when selecting candidates for niacin therapy. Adding niacin to lipid-lowering regimens is a valuable option for physicians treating patients with dyslipidemia and should be considered in appropriate patients.", 
    "84": "Lovastatin has been used to treat hypercholesterolemia through blocking the mevalonate biosynthesis pathway. Inhibition of mevalonate synthesis may result in antiproliferation and cell apoptosis. The aim of the present study was to examine the apoptotic effect of lovastatin in human ARO cells and delineate its underlying molecular mechanism. Our results showed that lovastatin dose- and time-dependently induced apoptosis in ARO cells. Pretreatment with cycloheximide dose-dependently suppressed lovastatin-induced apoptosis, suggesting that de novo protein synthesis is required for lovastatin effect on the induction of apoptosis in ARO cells. Treatment of the cells with 50 microM lovastatin induced cytochrome c translocation from mitochondria to cytosol; increases in caspase-2, -3, and -9 activity; and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase degradation in a time-dependent manner. However, administration of mevalonate or geranylgeraniol, but not farnesol, dose-dependently prevented lovastatin-induced poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase degradation and the occurrence of apoptosis, but treatment with geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor, GGTI-298, which blocks the geranylgeranylation, induced an increase in the percentage of the apoptotic cells. These data suggest that geranylgeranylation is required for survival of the lovastatin-treated ARO cells. To support this notion, we demonstrate that lovastatin dose-dependently decreased the translocation of RhoA and Rac1, but not Ras, from cytosol to membrane fraction. Moreover, the lovastatin-induced translocation inhibitions in RhoA and Rac1 were prevented by mevalonate and geranylgeraniol but not farnesol. In conclusion, our data suggest that lovastatin induced apoptosis in ARO cells by inhibiting protein geranylgeranylation of the Rho family but not farnesylation of the Ras family.",

    "86": "The withdrawal of cerivastatin from pretreated vascular smooth muscle cells induced an increase in monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and tissue factor (TF) mRNA expression and enhanced MCP-1 secretion as well as cell surface TF activity. In the presence of cerivastatin, this effect was mimicked by geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate or mevalonate. Withdrawal-induced MCP-1 expression was sensitive to PD98059, SB203580, and diphenylene iodonium, suggesting an involvement of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and the NADPH oxidase. Withdrawal increased the activity of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and enhanced radical generation. Because the latter effect may result from an Rac-mediated activation of the NADPH oxidase, the effect of withdrawal on Rac translocation was studied. Statin treatment induced an increase in Rac-1 content in the cytoplasm. On withdrawal, however, an \"overshoot\" translocation of Rac to the plasma membrane occurred.",

Previously, statins have been well tolerated and have shown favorable safety profiles. However, the voluntary withdrawal of cerivastatin from the market because of a disproportionate number of reports of rhabdomyolysis-associated deaths drew attention to the pharmacokinetic profile of statins, which may possibly have been related to serious drug-drug interactions. Pitavastatin (NK-104, previously called itavastatin or nisvastatin, Kowa Company Ltd., Tokyo) is a novel, fully synthetic statin, which has a potent cholesterol-lowering action. The short-term and long-term lipid-modifying effects of pitavastatin have already been investigated in subjects with primary hypercholesterolemia, heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and type-2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by hyperlipidemia. Within the range of daily doses from 1 to 4 mg, the efficacy of pitavastatin as a lipid-lowering drug seems to be similar, or potentially superior, to that of atorvastatin. According to the results of pharmacokinetic studies, pitavastatin showed favorable and promising safety profile; it was only slightly metabolized by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system, its lactone form had no inhibitory effects on the CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of concomitantly administered drugs; P-glycoprotein-mediated transport did not play a major role in its disposition, and pitavastatin did not inhibit P-glycoprotein activity. It could be concluded that pitavastatin could provide a new and potentially better therapeutic choice for lipid-modifying therapy than do the currently available statins. The efficacy and safety of higher dose treatment, as well as its long-term effects in the prevention of coronary artery disease, should be further investigated.", 
    "108": "Mevastatin arrested HCT116 colon cancer cells at the G1/S transition and increased cellular levels of p21CIP1/WAF1. p21-deficient colon cancer cells continued to proliferate in the presence of mevastatin. Although p21 was necessary for the G1/S block, the G1 cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) cyclin E-Cdk2 and cyclin D-Cdk4 remained active. Despite the activity of the G1 Cdks the retinoblastoma protein was hypophosphorylated due to unknown mechanisms that were dependent on the p21 protein. The resulting decrease in cyclin A mRNA and protein led to a decrease in the activity of cyclin A-Cdk2. Therefore, although p21 was required for the G1/S arrest of HCT116 colon cancer cells by mevastatin, its mode of action was more complicated than the simple formation of a physical complex with cyclin-Cdk2. This mechanism of inhibition is different from that seen in prostate cancer cells (Ukomadu, C., and Dutta, A. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 4840-4846) where the activating phosphorylation of cyclin E-Cdk2 is suppressed and p21 is not required, suggesting the existence of cell line-specific differences in the mechanism by which statins arrest the cell cycle.",

Their cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, LDL subtype profile, hemorrheological parameters and E-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 concentrations were measured before and at the end of atorvastatin therapy. The levels of total and LDL cholesterol respectively decreased by 25% and 24% (both p < 0.001). Furthermore, cholesterol was reduced by 8-29% in all seven LDL subfractions (density range: 1.020-1.066 g/mL) (p < 0.05). The reduction in triglyceride concentrations was of marginal significance (9%, p = 0.1), but its degree positively correlated with the reduction of small-dense LDL (r = 0.5, p < 0.025). Plasma viscosity and blood viscosity at low shear rates were respectively reduced by 2% and 16% (both p < 0.05).

The lovC disruptant was able to efficiently convert dihydromonacolin L 5 or monacolin J 9 into 1, and could also transform desmethylmonacolin J 15 into compactin 3. In contrast, the lovA mutant has an unexpectedly active beta-oxidation system and gives only small amounts of 1 upon addition of the immediate precursor 9, with most of the added nonaketide being degraded to heptaketide 22. Similarly, the lovA mutant does not accumulate the polyketide synthase product 5 and rapidly degrades any 5 added as a precursor via two cycles of beta-oxidation and hydroxylation at C-6 to give 20. The possible involvement of epoxides 21a and 21b in the biosynthesis of 1 was also examined, but their instability in fermentation media and fungal cells will require purified enzymes to establish their role.",

Treated animals received simvastatin orally (0.5 mg/kg) for 5 days before the experiment. Injury was quantitated in terms of tissue myeloperoxidase content, vascular permeability ((125)I bovine serum albumin extravasation), and bronchoalveolar lavage leukocyte and cytokine content. Changes in nuclear translocation of transcription factors were evaluated by electromobility shift assay. Additional animals received N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester before ischemia-reperfusion to assess whether inhibition of nitric oxide synthase could reverse simvastatin's protective effects. The presence of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase was also evaluated using enzyme staining both histologically and in native electrophoresis.", 
    "115": "Lung vascular permeability was reduced in treated animals by 71% compared with positive controls (P <.001). Administration of N(G)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester reversed this protection. The protective effects of statin pretreatment correlated with a 68% reduction in tissue myeloperoxidase content (P <.01), marked reductions in bronchoalveolar lavage leukocyte accumulation, and decreased expression of proinflammatory cytokines. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase expression also decreased with statin treatment.",

    "117": "These studies demonstrate that treatment of macrophages with lovastatin, a cholesterol-lowering drug that blocks farnesylation and geranylgeranylation of target proteins, increases LPS-induced TNF-alpha production. This is reversed by the addition of mevalonate, which bypasses the lovastatin block. Examination of membrane localization of RhoA, Cdc42, Rac1, and Ras demonstrated decreased membrane localization of the geranylgeranylated Rho family members (RhoA, Cdc42, and Rac1) with no change in the membrane localization of farnesylated Ras. LPS-induced TNF-alpha production in the presence of the Rho family-specific blocker (toxin B from Clostridium difficile) was significantly enhanced consistent with the lovastatin data. One intracellular signaling pathway that is required for TNF-alpha production by LPS is the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK). Significantly, we found prolonged ERK activation after LPS stimulation of lovastatin-treated macrophages. When we inhibited ERK, we blocked the lovastatin-induced increase in TNF-alpha production. As a composite, these studies demonstrate a negative role for one or more Rho family GTPases in LPS-induced TNF-alpha production.",

In this study, to identify the MCT isoform(s) responsible for the lovastatin acid uptake, the transport mechanism was investigated using bovine kidney NBL-1 cells, which have been reported to express only MCT4 at the protein level. On RT-PCR analysis, the message of mRNAs for MCT1 and MCT4 was detected in the NBL-1 cells used in this study, which was confirmed by kinetic analysis of [14C]L-lactic acid uptake, consisting of high- and low-affinity components corresponding to MCT1 and MCT4, respectively. The lovastatin acid uptake depended on an inwardly directed H+-gradient, and was inhibited by representative monocarboxylates, but not by inhibitors/substrates for organic anion transporting polypeptides and organic anion transporters. In addition, L-lactic acid competitively inhibited the uptake of lovastatin acid and lovastatin acid inhibited the low affinity component of [14C]L-lactic acid uptake dose dependently. The inhibition constant of L-lactic acid for lovastatin acid uptake was almost the same as the Michaelis constant for [14C]L-lactic acid uptake by the low-affinity component. These kinetic evidences imply that lovastatin acid was taken up into NBL-1 cells via MCT4.",

All patients received aspirin. The 1-year primary end point was a composite of death, myocardial infarction, and stroke. We performed a post hoc analysis to evaluate the clinical efficacy of concomitant clopidogrel and statin administration, categorizing baseline statin use to those predominantly CYP3A4-metabolized (atorvastatin, lovastatin, simvastatin, and cerivastatin) (CYP3A4-MET) or others (pravastatin and fluvastatin) (non-CYP3A4-MET). Of the 2116 patients enrolled, 1001 received a CYP3A4-MET and 158 a non-CYP3A4-MET statin. For the overall study population, the primary end point was significantly reduced in the clopidogrel group (8.5% versus 11.5%, RRR 26.9%; P=0.025). This clopidogrel benefit was similar with statin use, irrespective of treatment with a CYP3A4-MET (7.6% clopidogrel, 11.8% control, RRR 36.4%, 95% CI 3.9 to 57.9; P=0.03) or non-CYP3A4-MET statin (5.4% clopidogrel, 13.6% control, RRR 60.6%, 95% CI -23.9 to 87.4; P=0.11).

Atorvastatin treatment did not produce any change in oral glucose tolerance categories or induce any change in glucose and insulin response in OGTT.

Besides this very important function, several others have been recently demonstrated such as the inhibition of atherogenous plaque formation, platelet aggregation, or improvement of endothelial function and fibrinolytic activity, or even the direct protective effects of statins on the mortality of acute myocardial infarction. Aside from the major interest of both the medical community and pharmaceutical companies remain the very important anti-tumor effects of this group of drugs. As based on recent medical research, inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase, the key enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthesis, brings about depletion of several intermediates. The most important one seems to be farnesyl pyrophosphate, which has a very important role in the cell signaling affecting apoptosis. The aim of the survey is to summarize present knowledge in this medical field and to demonstrate the enormous curative potential of this group of drugs.", 
    "131": "VLDL overproduction by enhanced hepatic FFA flux is a major characteristic of familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL). The postprandial complement component 3 (C3) response has been associated with impaired postprandial FFA metabolism in FCHL. We investigated the effects of 16 weeks of treatment with atorvastatin on postprandial C3 and lipid changes in 12 FCHL patients. Atorvastatin significantly lowered fasting plasma C3 and triglyceride (TG) in FCHL. Fasting TG and insulin sensitivity were the best predictors of fasting and postprandial C3. Postprandial triglyceridemia and C3 response, estimated as area under the curve (AUC), were significantly lowered by atorvastatin by 19% and 12%, respectively, albeit still elevated, compared with 10 matched controls. Postprandial FFA-AUC and postheparin plasma lipolytic activities remained unchanged after atorvastatin, suggesting no major effect on lipolysis. After atorvastatin, postprandial hydroxybutyric acid-AUC, which was elevated in untreated FCHL patients, was decreased, reaching values similar to those in controls. The present data show reduction of postprandial hepatic FFA flux in FCHL by atorvastatin, providing an additional mechanistic explanation for the reduction of VLDL secretion reported previously for atorvastatin. This was accompanied by a decrease in fasting plasma C3 concentrations and a blunted postprandial C3 response to an acute oral fat load.", 
    "132": "Retention of LDL in the artery intima is mediated by extracellular matrix proteoglycans and plays an important role in the initiation of atherosclerosis. Compared with quiescent cells, proliferating smooth muscle cells secrete proteoglycans with elongated glycosaminoglycan side chains, which have an increased binding affinity to LDL. Because 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) decrease smooth muscle cell proliferation, we hypothesized that statin exposure would decrease both the size and LDL binding affinity of vascular proteoglycans. Monkey aortic smooth muscle cells grown in culture were exposed to simvastatin (10 and 100 microM) and cerivastatin (0.1 and 1 microM), and newly secreted proteoglycans were quantified and characterized. Both simvastatin and cerivastatin caused a concentration-dependent reduction in cell growth and reduced 35SO4 incorporation into secreted proteoglycans, on both an absolute and a per cell basis. Interestingly, statin exposure increased the apparent molecular weight and hydrodynamic size of secreted proteoglycans. However, proteoglycans secreted from statin-exposed cells demonstrated a reduction in binding affinity to LDL. Thus, statins may induce atheroprotective changes in vascular proteoglycans and lower LDL retention in the vessel wall. These findings suggest a mechanism whereby statins may benefit atherosclerosis in a manner unrelated to serum LDL lowering.", 
    "133": "Oatp14/blood-brain barrier-specific anion transporter 1 (Slc21a14) is a novel member of the organic anion transporting polypeptide (Oatp/OATP) family. Northern blot analysis revealed predominant expression of Oatp14 in the brain, and Western blot analysis revealed its expression in the brain capillary and choroid plexus. Immunohistochemical staining indicated that Oatp14 is expressed in the border of the brain capillary endothelial cells. When expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, Oatp14 transports thyroxine (T4; prothyroid hormone) (Km = 0.18 mum), as well as amphipathic organic anions such as 17beta estradiol-d-17beta-glucuronide (Km = 10 mum), cerivastatin (Km = 1.3 mum), and troglitazone sulfate (Km = 0.76 mum). The uptake of triiodothyronine (T3), an active form produced from T4, was significantly greater in Oatp14-expressed cells than in vector-transfected cells, but the transport activity for T3 was approximately 6-fold lower that for T4. The efflux of T4, preloaded into the cells, from Oatp14-expressed cells was more rapid than that from vector-transfected cells (0.032 versus 0.006 min-1). Therefore, Oatp14 can mediate a bidirectional transport of T4. Sulfobromophthalein, taurocholate, and estrone sulfate were potent inhibitors for Oatp14, whereas digoxin, p-aminohippurate, or leukotriene C4, or organic cations such as tetraetheylammonium or cimetidine had no effect. The expression levels of Oatp14 mRNA and protein were up- and down-regulated under hypo- and hyperthyroid conditions, respectively. Therefore, it may be speculated that Oatp14 plays a role in maintaining the concentration of T4 and, ultimately, T3 in the brain by transporting T4 from the circulating blood to the brain.", 
    "134": "Oxidation susceptibility of lipids in vitro is considered to reflect the exposure of lipids to oxidation stress in vivo which is related to cardiovascular morbidity. This study examined the effect of pravastatin therapy on serum oxidation susceptibility, particularly in relation to endothelial function of coronary arteries.", 
    "135": "The participants were recruited from the Pravastatin-Related Effects Following Angioplasty on Coronary Endothelium trial, a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized, multi-center study designed to analyze the effect of pravastatin treatment on endothelial function in previously dilated and normal coronary arteries. Serial, graded, intra-coronary acetylcholine infusions were used to assess endothelial function. In vitro, copper-induced, serum oxidation parameters were determined at randomization and at time of coronary endothelial function assessment.", 
    "136": "Oxidation parameters were determined in 45 patients (pravastatin 23, placebo 22). Pravastatin therapy significantly improved serum oxidation lag time (+8%, P<0.05), maximal diene formation rate (-22%, P<0.01) and total amount of dienes formed after 5 h (-16%, P<0.01). These parameters remained essentially unchanged in the placebo group. Acetylcholine-evoked responses were positively correlated to therapy-induced change in serum oxidation susceptibility in the dilated segment group (r2=0.56, P=0.006).", 
    "137": "Pravastatin's beneficial effect on endothelial dysfunction of dilated coronary segments may be secondary to pravastatin's improvement of oxidation susceptibility.", 
    "138": "Adhesion molecules and cytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of intimal injury in atherosclerosis but their relationship with endothelial function remains unclear. The objectives of this study were to examine the effects of atorvastatin on soluble adhesion molecules, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and brachial artery endothelial-dependent flow mediated dilatation (FMD) in patients with familial (FH) and non-familial hypercholesterolaemia (NFH). A total of 74 patients (27 FH and 47 NFH) were recruited. Fasting lipid profiles, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), soluble vascular-cellular adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), E-selectin, IL-6 and FMD were measured at baseline, 2 weeks, 3 and 9 months post-atorvastatin treatment (FH--80 mg/day, NFH--10 mg/day). In both groups, compared to baseline, sICAM-1 levels were significantly reduced at 2 weeks, further reduced at 3 months and maintained at 9 months (P<0.0001). The IL-6 levels were significantly reduced at 3 months and 9 months compared to baseline for FH (P<0.005) and NFH (P<0.0001). In both groups, the FMD at 2 weeks was higher than baseline (P<0.005), with progressive improvement up to 9 months. FMD was negatively correlated with sICAM-1 and IL-6. In conclusion, both low and high doses of atorvastatin lead to early progressive improvement in endothelial function in patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia. sICAM-1 and IL-6 levels reflect endothelial dysfunction in these patients.", 
    "139": "In the context of atherogenesis and restenosis, vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and apoptosis play a crucial role. Inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (statins) have been shown to inhibit the migration and proliferation of SMC, and to induce apoptosis in different cell types including SMC. However, it is not known whether these agents induce apoptosis in neointimal SMC. We investigated the effects of statin treatment on neointimal SMC as compared to medial cells by using trypan blue counting, MTT test, Annexin V staining, cell cycle analysis and a co-culture model. The incubation of neointimal or medial SMC with lovastatin reduced the MTT activity as well as the total cell number, and increased the amount of trypan blue positive cells, indicative of cell death. We tested by staining with Annexin V/propidium iodide, specific antibodies to active caspase-3, TUNEL reaction, and by the appearance of a sub-G1 peak, whether the observed increase in cell death was due to apoptosis. After treatment with lovastatin, programmed cell death was slightly increased in medial SMC, while neointimal cells showed a pronounced rate of apoptosis. In an attempt to mimic early phases of restenosis in vitro by seeding low density neointimal cells onto high density medial cells, we found that statin treatment induced cell death preferentially in the neointimal SMC. Our results suggest that statins enhance the rate of apoptosis in neointimal SMC, which may be an interesting feature to reduce restenosis after successful angioplasty.", 
    "140": "Thrombin, a serine protease, plays an important role in the progression of atherosclerosis. How atorvastatin could limit the pro-inflammatory response to thrombin was studied in cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells. The variations in expression of interleukin-6, heme oxygenase-1, p(22phox) and Mox-1 mRNAs were evaluated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Interleukin-6 release was determined using the B9 cell assay. Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) translocation was analysed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and RhoA protein translocation by Western blot. Thrombin activated interleukin-6 secretion and mRNA expression in smooth muscle cells in a dose-dependent manner. The greatest effect on mRNA expression was obtained after 1 h of stimulation. Preincubation (72 h) of the cells with various concentrations of atorvastatin prevented this effect. Simultaneous addition of mevalonate overcame this statin effect. Thrombin was without effect on p(22phox) and heme oxygenase-1 mRNA expression but, after 3 h of stimulation, induced a two-fold increase in that of Mox-1. Preincubation with atorvastatin dose-dependently downregulated this Mox-1 mRNA expression. In addition, thrombin induced NF-kappaB translocation and membrane translocation of RhoA in smooth muscle cells which were both prevented by pre-treatment of the cells by atorvastatin. These data demonstrate the ability of atorvastatin to prevent the induction by thrombin of a pro-inflammatory phenotype in smooth muscle cells.",

    "143": "Lovastatin could arrest cellcycle in the G(0)/G(1) phase in a dose- and time-dependent manner, obviously lowering the expression of IkappaBalpha, CDK4 and pRb protein level in the cytoplasm and increasing IkappaBalpha in the nucleus, but not on p16 protein level.",

    "145": "Recent large clinical trials have demonstrated that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, or statins, markedly reduce morbidity and mortality when used in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. It has been established that the benefits of statin therapy in cardiovascular disease can be explained not only by the lipid-lowering potential of statins but also by nonlipid-related mechanisms (so-called \"pleiotropic effects\") that contribute to the positive effect of statins on the incidence of cardiovascular events. The coagulation and fibrinolytic systems are two separate but reciprocally linked enzyme cascades that regulate the formation and breakdown of fibrin. Numerous studies have demonstrated that disturbances of coagulation and fibrinolysis contribute to the development and progression of atherosclerosis, and that they affect the incidence of atherosclerosis-related clinical events. High plasma levels or activities of fibrinogen, factor VII, factor VIII, von Willebrand factor (vWF), soluble thrombomodulin, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) are thought to be associated with increased morbidity and mortality related to cardiovascular disease. Experimental studies and many clinical studies have recently shown that statins produce favourable effects on haemostatic parameters, including those that are risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Statins diminish procoagulant activity, which is observed at different stages of the coagulation cascade, including tissue factor (TF) activity, conversion of prothrombin to thrombin and thrombin activity. In some studies, statins also reduced fibrinogen levels. By altering the levels and activities of tPA and PAI-1, statins seem to stimulate fibrinolysis. The data on the effects of combined treatment with statins and other drugs on haemostasis are rather limited. They suggest that statins combined with fibric acid derivatives, omega-3 fatty acids and 17beta-estradiol are superior to statins alone. The only two clinical studies performed in patients with acute coronary syndromes showed a relatively weak effect of statins on haemostasis in those patients. Although various statins may produce different effects on individual variables, there are no convincing data showing that differences in their physicochemical and pharmacokinetic properties significantly alter their net effect on excessive procoagulant activity. Apart from the lipid-lowering effect, statins suppress the synthesis of several important nonsterol isoprenoids derived from the mevalonate pathway, especially farnesyl and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphates, which via enhanced protein prenylation, are involved in the regulation of many cellular processes. It is presumed that the inhibitory effect of statins on the mevalonate pathway is involved in the regulation of some key steps of coagulation and fibrinolysis processes. In this way they probably regulate the synthesis of TF, tPA and PAI-1, and perhaps they also control the generation and activity of thrombin. The beneficial effects of statins on coagulation and fibrinolysis may be responsible for their ability to decrease the number of cardiovascular events. The lipid-independent effects of statins on haemostasis may contribute to the marked decrease in the incidence rates of mortality, hospitalisation and revascularisation in patients treated with these drugs.", 
    "146": "Management of hyperlipidaemia in patients with ischaemic heart disease is suboptimal despite the proven benefit of statin therapy. Significant improvement in management has been shown in the EUROASPIRE II study. It is unclear, however, whether such changes have also occurred in primary care. We aimed to evaluate the use of statin therapy by performing a cross-sectional survey of 300 patients with CHD aged >30 years from three general practices. A total of 249 (83%) of the 300 patients had their cholesterol measured and 141 (47%) were on statin therapy; 129 (43% of total) achieved a target cholesterol of <5 mmol/l, of whom 85 (64%) were on statin therapy. Of the remaining 120 patients whose cholesterol exceeded 5 mmol/l, 56 (47%) were on statin therapy Thus 60% (85/141) of those on statin therapy achieved adequate control compared with 40% (44/108) without statins (p<0.008). Those patients with CHD diagnosed on objective evidence were more likely to receive statin therapy (55.5%). Many patients with CHD are still not receiving appropriate secondary prevention. Those on statin therapy are more likely to achieve target levels <5 mmol/l. The average doses of statins vary and are lower than the evidence-based doses used in previous large-scale studies, which may help explain the persistence of failed treatment.", 
    "147": "Inflammatory cytokines induce erythropoietin (EPO) resistance, anorexia, and suppression of hepatic albumin synthesis. Increased levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) have been associated with relative EPO resistance in dialysis patients. More recently, studies have shown that statin therapy decreases CRP. This study analyzed the effect of statin therapy on EPO requirements in dialysis patients. This retrospective, single center study stratified stable hemodialysis patients into two groups: Group 1, statin therapy (n = 19), and Group 2, nonstatin therapy (n = 19). Group 1 was subclassified into Group 1a (prestatin therapy) and Group 1b (poststatin therapy). Baseline demographics, biochemical parameters [serum lipid panel, hemoglobin (Hgb), transferrin saturation (TSAT), ferritin, parathyroid hormone (PTH), aluminum, albumin, KT/V, urea reduction ratio (URR), and protein catabolic rate (nPCR)] and EPO requirements (u/kg per treatment) were obtained. Poststatin labs were obtained at a mean of 4.7 months. Statistically significant changes were noted in Group 1 after initiation of statin therapy for cholesterol (174.68 +/- 53.8 to 142 +/- 32.7, p < 0.05), Hgb (10.61 +/- 1.2 to 12.48 +/- 0.79, p < 0.0005), ferritin (618 +/- 334.1 to 334 +/- 265, p < 0.05), and albumin (3.58 +/- 0.4 to 3.77 +/- 0.4, p < 0.005). EPO requirements decreased by 25%. Mean values for lipid panel showed reductions in cholesterol (18%), triglyceride (37.8%), and low density lipoprotein (LDL) (26%), as well as elevation in high density lipoprotein (HDL) (11%). These data suggest that statin therapy may decrease EPO requirements in dialysis patients. The improvement in EPO responsiveness may be caused by the effect of statins on CRP.", 
    "148": "Several lipid-lowering intervention studies published in 2002 shed light on the current status and the future of cardiovascular risk reduction by drug therapy. The Heart Protection Study has demonstrated that simvastatin reduces heart attack, stroke and revascularisation risk by about one-third irrespective of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, patient's age or sex, or the nature of pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Coronary heart disease death and myocardial infarction risk reduction in elderly patients by pravastatin in the PROSPER study was similar to the benefit of statins in middle-aged populations in other studies. The ALLHAT-LLT study has failed to demonstrate a benefit of pravastatin on all-cause mortality, CHD death or nonfatal myocardial infarction, illustrating that too modest cholesterol lowering does not result in clinical benefit under all circumstances. The cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe has demonstrated significant LDL and total cholesterol lowering, and induced an additional 21% LDL cholesterol lowering when added to ongoing statin therapy. The cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitor JJT-705 produced a dose-dependent increase in HDL cholesterol concentrations of up to 34% and improved the total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio in healthy individuals while having very mild side effects. Cholesterol absorption inhibitors and HDL cholesterol enhancers may become useful tools to achieve further improvements in cardiovascular risk reduction in the future.",

Dosage was increased to 20 mg if LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) levels remained >3.4 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) at week 4. At week 26, subjects received 10 mg of atorvastatin for an additional 26 weeks. Efficacy variables included percent changes in LDL-C, total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B from baseline to week 26.", 
    "151": "Atorvastatin caused a highly significant reduction in LDL-C compared with placebo (-40% vs -0.4%, respectively; P<.001). Percent changes at week 26 also significantly favored atorvastatin for total cholesterol (-32% vs -1.5%; P<.001), triglycerides (-12% vs +1.0%; P=0.03), and apolipoprotein B (-34% vs +0.7%; P<.001), with a significantly greater increase in HDL cholesterol with atorvastatin compared with placebo (+2.8% vs -1.8%; P=.02).

    "153": "To clarify the mechanism of the stimulatory effect of statins on bone formation, we investigated the effect of simvastatin, a widely used statin, on osteoblastic and adipocytic differentiation in primary cultured mouse bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs). Simvastatin treatment enhanced the expression level of mRNA for osteocalcin and protein for osteocalcin and osteopontin, and increased alkaline phosphatase activity significantly (p<0.05). After BMSCs were exposed to an adipocyte differentiation agonist, Oil Red O staining, fluorescence activated cell sorting, and decreased expression level of lipoprotein lipase mRNA showed that treatment with simvastatin significantly inhibits adipocytic differentiation compared to controls that did not receive simvastatin (p<0.05). Lastly, we found that simvastatin induces high expression of BMP(2) in BMSCs. These observations suggested that simvastatin acts on BMSCs to enhance osteoblastic differentiation and inhibits adipocytic differentiation; this effect is at least partially mediated by inducing BMP(2) expression in BMSCs.", 
    "154": "Statins are a group of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors which are most effective as lipid lowering agents, and are currently extensively used clinically. Recently, it was also shown that statins affect the immune response. We investigated the effects of lovastatin on the maturation and functional changes of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BM-DC). Lovastatin inhibited MHC class II and CD40 expression on DC in a dose-dependent manner, but had lesser effects on CD16, CD80, CD86, and CD11b expression. Nuclear extracts of lovastatin treated DC had decreased NF-kappaB DNA binding activity. Although antigen capture capacity of DC was not affected by lovastatin, the T-cell stimulatory activity of DC was inhibited. Lovastatin up-regulated DC pro-inflammatory cytokine production induced by LPS as measured by intracellular cytokine staining, ELISA and cDNA microarrays. Mevalonate, added in vitro, prevented these effects. These results indicate that lovastatin may inhibit BM-DC maturation and up-regulate cytokine production through a mevalonate dependent pathway, and may cause adverse effects on either innate or adaptive immunity.", 
    "155": "We previously reported that human interleukin (IL)-2 dependent T cell lines derived from very late antigen (VLA)-1(+) CD45RO(+) peripheral blood (PB) T-cells adhere constitutively to collagen type IV, whereas lines from VLA-1(-) PB lymphocytes (L) adhere weakly. Here we report that the latter are induced to adhere by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Both PMA dependent and constitutive adhesion, including that of a Herpes Virus Saimiri (HVS) infected CD4(+)VLA-1(+) clone (HVST) were inhibited by anti-VLA-1 monoclonal antibodies (mAb), by inhibitors of phospholipase C (PLC)gamma and by lovastatin but not by a MEK1 inhibitor, whereas only PMA induced adhesion was blocked by inhibition of protein-kinase (PK) C. Furthermore, lovastatin enhanced PLCgamma and anti VLA-1 mAb blockade, and its effect was not reversed by mevalonic acid (MVA). Lovastatin also inhibited interferon (IFN)gamma secretion by T cells triggered with anti-CD3 and in cells detaching from collagen IV. These results suggest new ways for functional modulation of activated T-cells interacting with collagen."
