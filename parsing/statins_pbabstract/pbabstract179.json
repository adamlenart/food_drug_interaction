    "1": "Patients in the diet plus pravastatin group were divided into tertiles by their on-treatment LDL-C level, and the hazard ratios (HRs) in each tertile were compared with the diet group at 5 years using the Cox proportional hazards model. In addition, the treatment groups were combined and divided into quintiles according to the on-treatment LDL-C level during follow-up, and the incidence of cardiovascular events was compared among the 5 groups.", 
    "2": "In the tertiles of the diet plus pravastatin group, HR was lowest in the second tertile against the diet group (HR 0.57, p=0.01) with on-treatment LDL-C range of 119.8-133.4 mg/dL. In the analysis of quintiles of the total population, a significant risk reduction of CVD was found in the fourth quintile (HR 0.48, p=0.0015) with an on-treatment LDL-C range of 120.9-133.3 mg/dL, and in the fifth quintile (HR 0.64, p=0.048) with an on-treatment LDL-C range of 56.7-120.8 mg/dL against tertile 1 with an on-treatment LDL-C range of 157.5-206.2 mg/dL.", 
    "3": "The usual Japanese dose of pravastatin therapy is sufficient in this low-risk patient population to reduce cardiovascular risk, with an achieved LDL-C level <133.4 mg/dL. Further risk reduction was not found with an achieved LDL <120 mg/dL.", 
    "4": "Sitosterolemia is a rare, autosomal recessive inherited sterol storage disease associated with high tissue and serum plant sterol concentrations, caused by mutations in the adenosine triphosphate-bind-ing cassette (ABC) transporter ABCG5 or ABCG8 genes. Markedly increased serum concentration of plant sterols. such as sitosterol and campesterol, cause premature atherosclerosis and massive xanthomas. Hitherto known treatments for sitosterolemia, including a low-sterol diet, bile-salt binding resins, ileal bypass surgery and low density lipoprotein (LDL) apheresis have not yielded sufficient reduction of serum plant sterol levels and many patients show a sustained elevation of plant sterol levels, subsequently developing premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. Ezetimibe, an inhibitor of intestinal cholesterol absorption through its binding to Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1), has been widely used for decreasing serum LDL-cholesterol levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia. Ezetimibe also reduces the gastrointestinal absorption of plant sterols, thereby also lowering the serum concentrations of plant sterols. This pharmacological property of ezetimibe shows its potential as a novel effective therapy for sitosterolemia. In the current review, we discuss the current therapy for patients with sitosterolemia and present two Japanese adolescent patients with this disease, one of whom underwent percutaneous coronary intervention for accelerated coronary atherosclerosis. Ezetimibe administration in addition to conventional drug therapy successfully reduced serum sitosterol levels by 51.3% and 48.9%, respectively, in the two patients, demonstrating ezetimibe as a novel and potent treatment agent for sitosterolemia that could work additively with conventional drug therapy.",

    "6": "Orbital adipose tissues were obtained from TAO patients undergoing orbital decompression surgery. The orbital preadipocytes cultured from the orbital adipose tissues were divided into Group A (a control group) and Group B (an intervention group). Group B was subdivided into Group B1-B5, all groups were stimulated to differentiate into mature adipocytes with cocktail differentiation medium.The entire course of differentiation was 10 d. The differentiation of orbital preadipocytes in Group A was induced with routine inducer,while at in Group B1,B2, and B3 was interfered with 5 micromol/L (B1), 10 micromol/L(B2),20 micromol/L (B3) mevastatin respectively during the whole process of differentiation. The differentiation of orbital preadipocytes in Group B4 and B5 was interfered with 10 micromol/L mevastatin day 4 (B4) or day 8 (B5) of the differentiation process until the entire course was over. Intracellular fat accumulation in differentiated adipocytes was determined by oil red O staining. The value of optical absorption was measured at 492 nm with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The expression of PPAR-gamma mRNA was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.", 
    "7": "The light absorption value (A) and PPAR-gamma mRNA expression of differentiated cells in Group A,B1,B2,and B3 decreased successively,and there was significant difference in any of the 2 groups among Group A, B1 and B2, and B3 (P<0.05). The value A and PPAR-gamma mRNA expression of differentiated cells in Group A, B4, and B2 decreased successively, and the difference in any of the 2 groups among these 3 groups was significant. However, there were no significant difference between Group A and B5.", 
    "8": "Mevastatin inhibits the differentiation of TAO derived orbital preadipocytes by blocking PPAR-gamma mRNA expression. The degree of inhibition is not only concentration-dependent but also associated with the stage of differentiation. The earlier the differentiation, the stronger the inhibition.", 
    "9": "The present study was designed to evaluate vasomotor function and vascular biological responses following a novel non-polymeric cerivastatin-eluting stent (CES) versus polymer-based paclitaxel-eluting stent (PES) in a rabbit iliac artery model. Optimisation of DES components and non-polymeric stents may contribute to vascular healing and beneficial to vasomotor function.", 
    "10": "In vitro human aortic and coronary smooth muscle cells (hASMC & hCSMC), as well as endothelial cells (hAEC & hCEC) were cultured. IC50 curves were determined for cerivastatin (CER). In vivo PES (n=6) and CES (n=12) stents were implanted in nine rabbits. Vasomotor function was investigated at 28 days by acetylcholine (ACh) followed by histopathological and histomorphometric analyses. CER was cytotoxic to hASMC and hCSMC (IC50s of 10-6 M and 10-5 M, respectively), although such cytotoxic effects were not observed for hAEC and hCEC at maximal study dose. PES-associated vasodilation response to endothelial-dependent ACh was significantly suppressed at both proximal and distal adjacent arterial segments, as compared to CES. Furthermore, microscopically, neointimal inhibition quantified by the neointimal cross-sectional area (IA) was superior with CES (0.60 + or - 0.27 mm(2)) compared to PES (1.35 + or - 0.16 mm(2); P <0.05). Medial area was smaller for PES (0.3 + or - 0.04 mm(2)) than CES (0.5 + or - 0.03 mm(2), p <0.001). Additionally, significant inflammation and fibrin deposition was clearly evidenced in PES compared to CES (p <0.05).", 
    "11": "CER elicits a differential effect on hSMC compared to hEC in vitro. In contrast to PES, a novel bioabsorbable sol-gel coated CES demonstrated effective neointimal inhibition with less vessel wall toxicity accompanied by preservation of vasomotor function in the rabbit iliac model.", 
    "12": "Computed tomography angiography (CTA) enables characterization of non-calcified coronary atherosclerotic lesions (NCALs) and assessment of plaque vulnerability. We investigated whether the characteristics of NCALs detected by 64-slice CTA were influenced by preceding statin therapy and serum lipid profiles.", 
    "13": "Among 493 consecutive patients who underwent coronary CTA, we enrolled 114 patients with NCALs. We divided the patients into three groups according to preceding statin therapy: intensive statins (IS, n=24), moderate statins (MS, n = 26), and no statin (NS, n = 64). The vulnerability of each NCAL was evaluated by density (low-density plaque defined as CT density \u2264 38 HU), positive remodeling (remodeling index > 1.05), and the presence of adjacent spotty calcification.", 
    "14": "Percentages of patients in the IS, MS, and NS groups with low-density NCALs were 46%, 58%, and 80%, respectively (p = 0.009) and positive remodeling NCALs were 54%, 58%, and 75%, respectively (p = 0.10). We also found an inverse correlation between serum LDL-C level and the minimum plaque CT density. According to the regression equation, a CT density of 38 HU corresponded with LDL-C of 100 mg/dl. The number of low-density plaques was positively correlated with low-density to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (LDL-C/HDL-C). An LDL-C/HDL-C > 2.5 independently predicted multiple low-density plaques (OR 2.39 [95%CI: 1.28-4.86], p < 0.001).", 
    "15": "Our CTA findings demonstrate that low-density NCALs occur less frequently in patients with intensive statin pre-treatment. A high LDL-C/HDL-C ratio is also associated with larger numbers of low-density NCALs.", 
    "16": "Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is associated with an increased prevalence of coronary artery disease (CAD). We investigated the presenting symptoms of CAD, coronary anatomy (single versus multi-vessel CAD), and treatment among a group of subjects undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with angioplasty and/or stenting.", 
    "17": "We evaluated a retrospective cohort of 43 RA subjects and 43 matched non-RA subjects undergoing PCI at 2 academic referral centers. RA subjects were matched to non-RA subjects on age, gender, history of coronary artery bypass grafting, date of PCI, and interventional cardiologist. We compared cardiac risk factors, presentation, treatment, and outcomes.", 
    "18": "The mean age of the study cohort was 71 \u00b1 10 years, and the distribution of traditional cardiac risk factors was similar in the subjects with RA compared with the matched non-RA subjects (all P values > 0.05). Seventy-four percent of subjects with RA compared with 67% of those without RA presented with an acute coronary syndrome before PCI (P = 0.48). All subjects in this cohort undergoing PCI had at least 1 stenosis in a major epicardial vessel and similar percentages of subjects with RA (44%) and without RA (40%) had multi-vessel CAD (P = 0.66). The administration of cardiac medications both at PCI and at hospital discharge was not different among subjects with RA compared with matched non-RA subjects.", 
    "19": "Among this cohort with significant CAD undergoing PCI, clinical characteristics, presentation, severity of CAD, treatment modalities, and outcomes were similar in subjects with RA and well-matched non-RA subjects.", 
    "20": "The aim of this analysis was to assess the diagnostic importance of pressure recovery in evaluation of aortic stenosis (AS) severity.", 
    "21": "Although pressure recovery has previously been demonstrated to be particularly important in assessment of AS severity in groups of patients with moderate AS or small aortic roots, it has never been evaluated in a large clinical patient cohort.", 
    "22": "Data from 1,563 patients in the SEAS (Simvastatin and Ezetimibe in Aortic Stenosis) study was used. Inner aortic diameter was measured at annulus, sinus, sinotubular junction, and supracoronary level. Aortic valve area index (AVAI) was calculated by continuity equation and pressure recovery and pressure recovery adjusted AVAI (energy loss index [ELI]), by validated equations. Primarily, sinotubular junction diameter was used to calculate pressure recovery and ELI, but pressure recovery and ELI calculated at different aortic root levels were compared. Severe AS was identified as AVAI and ELI < or =0.6 cm(2)/m(2). Patients were grouped into tertiles of peak transaortic velocity.", 
    "23": "Pressure recovery increased with increasing peak transaortic velocity. Overestimation of AS severity by unadjusted AVAI was largest in the lowest tertile and if pressure recovery was assessed at the sinotubular junction. In multivariate analysis, a larger difference between AVAI and ELI was associated with lower peak transaortic velocity (beta = 0.35) independent of higher left ventricular ejection fraction (beta = -0.049), male sex (beta = -0.075), younger age (beta = 0.093), and smaller aortic sinus diameter (beta = 0.233) (multiple R(2) = 0.18, p < 0.001). Overall, 47.5% of patients classified as having severe AS by AVAI were reclassified to nonsevere AS when pressure recovery was taken into account.", 
    "24": "For accurate assessment of AS severity, pressure recovery adjustment of AVA must be routinely performed. Estimation of pressure recovery at the sinotubular junction is suggested.", 
    "25": "Cholesterol is one of the major components of membrane lipids. Adjustment of the membrane cholesterol balance is, therefore, pivotal in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Cholesterol biosynthesis and uptake are tightly regulated at the transcriptional level through a negative feedback control. The transcription factor family known as sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) is in charge of this feedback control. In particular, SREBP-2 is activated in a cholesterol-dependent manner, and hence is deeply involved in regulation of the expression of genes closely related to cholesterol metabolism. Sterol metabolites, including cholesterol, 24,25-dihydrolanosterol and oxysterols, strongly participate in the regulation of sterol metabolism via binding to its particular proteins.", 
    "26": "Hepatic disposition plays a significant role in the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a variety of drugs. Sinusoidal membrane transporters have been shown to participate in the hepatic disposition of many pharmaceuticals. Two sinusoidal membrane transporters with an established role in hepatic disposition are OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 (organic anion-transporting polypeptides 1B1 and 1B3, respectively). OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 have been implicated in the hepatic uptake of statin drugs, and polymorphisms linked to OATP1B1 have been associated with deleterious patient endpoints. As a result, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 represent sites for potential drug-drug interactions. Numerous methods exist for identifying potential drug-drug interactions with transporters. However, relatively few offer the convenience and speed of fluorescence-based assays. Here a fluorescence-based assay was developed for measuring the OATP1B1- and OATP1B3-mediated transport of 8-fluorescein-cAMP (8-FcA). The OATP1B1- and OATP1B3-mediated transport of 8-FcA was time dependent and saturable (K(m)=2.9 and 1.8 microM, V(max)=0.20 and 0.33 pmol/min/cm(2), respectively). Molecules known to interact with OATPs, including cyclosporin A, rifampicin, and glibenclamide, each demonstrated concentration-dependent inhibition of 8-FcA transport by OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. The in vitro fluorescence-based assays described here using 8-FcA as the substrate are convenient and rapid and have utility in screening drug candidates for potential drug-drug interactions with OATP1B1 and OATP1B3.", 
    "27": "Small dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL) plays an important role in glomerular injury through conversion to an oxidatively modified form of LDL. However, few studies have evaluated the effects of antilipidemic agents on the LDL particle size and renal function in hyperlipidemic patients with nondiabetic nephropathy.", 
    "28": "This study was a randomized crossover trial comparing the effects of atorvastatin (10 mg/day) and probucol (500 mg/day) administered for 24 weeks in 31 patients (urinary albumin excretion 0.3-2.0 g/day and creatinine clearance >30 mL/min/1.73 m (2) ). Lipid parameters, mean LDL particle diameter, creatinine clearance, and urinary albumin to creatinine excretion ratio were measured before and during treatment periods.", 
    "29": "Atorvastatin and probucol significantly reduced the serum total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol concentrations. When stratified by mean baseline LDL particle size at 25.5 nm, atorvastatin increased (p < 0.05) LDL particle size from 24.6 +/- 0.5 to 25.2 +/- 0.9 nm only in the <25.5 nm (pattern B) group, whereas probucol decreased (p < 0.05) LDL size from 24.8 +/- 0.9 to 24.2 +/- 0.9 nm in the pattern B group and from 25.9 +/- 0.5 to 24.6 +/- 0.8 nm in the >or=25.5 nm (pattern A) group. No significant differences in urinary albumin/creatinine excretion ratio and creatinine clearance were observed in both groups during treatment.",

    "32": "PBMC from 45 mL peripheral blood of healthy adult voluntary donators, were separated and cultured, and divided into 5 groups according to different culture medium: group A, PBMC and titanium particles; group B, PBMC and titanium particles with 1 x 10(-5) mol/L simvastatin; group C, PBMC and titanium particles with 1 x 10(-6) mol/L simvastatin; group D, PBMC and titanium particles with 1 x 10(-7) mol/L simvastatin; and group E, PBMC and titanium particles with the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) inhibitor U0126. The contents of TNF-alpha and MCP-1 were tested by ELISA after 24 hours of culture. PBMC were pretreated with different medium grouping as groups A, B, C, D, and E for 60 minutes, and were challenged with titanium particles for 30 minutes and 60 minutes, then the level of ERK1/2 expression was tested by Western blot.",

    "35": "Statins have therapeutic benefits for the management of several disorders. A short-term course of a high-dose statin pretreatment has demonstrated neuroprotective effects against neurological diseases. However, the molecular basis underlying the neuroprotective action of statins remains unclear.",

    "37": "Atorvastatin (5 mg/kg) or saline was given orally to Sprague-Dawley rats for 7 days before injury. The rats were subjected to crush injury in the left sciatic nerve with a vessel clamp. Biochemical, functional, electrophysiological, and morphological alterations occurring during injury-induced degeneration/regeneration were examined.", 
    "38": "Atorvastatin improved injury-induced neurobehavioral/electrophysiological changes and axonal loss. Damage-associated alterations, including structural disruption, oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis, were attenuated by atorvastatin. After injury, regeneration-associated genes, including growth-associated protein-43, myelin basic protein, ciliary neurotrophic factor, and collagen, were upregulated by atorvastatin. The suppression of extracellular signal-regulated kinase, AKT, signal transducer and activators of transcription-1, and necrosis factor-kappaB and the elevated activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase, Smad2/3, and activating protein-1 were associated with the neuroprotective action of atorvastatin.", 
    "39": "These findings suggest that a short-term course of high-dose atorvastatin pretreatment can protect against sciatic nerve crush injury through modifying intracellular or extracellular environments, making it favorable for regeneration.", 
    "40": "Increased expression of cyclooxygenase (COX-2) contributes to atherosclerosis. Recent studies suggest that COX-2 inhibitors prevent early plaque development but their effects on established lesions are less clear, while the statins promote plaque stability. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether administering a combination of a COX-2 inhibitor with a statin drug alters plaque progression in apo E-/- mice.", 
    "41": "Apo E-/- mice were fed a Western diet from 6 to 26 wk of age. At 26 wk, the Western diets supplemented with atorvastatin, celecoxib, or atorvastatin plus celecoxib were given for an additional 12 wk.",

The decreased extent of atherosclerosis observed in the apo E-/- mice fed the combination of drugs was associated with reduced levels of prostaglandin (PG) E(2,) decreased protein expression of metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, macrophage chemotactic protein (MCP-1), and COX 2, and decreased staining for MMP-9, F4-80 (a marker for macrophages), and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM).", 
    "43": "This study indicates that using statins with a COX-2 inhibitor reduced the extent of atherosclerosis and inflammatory/cell adhesion molecule levels in the apo E-/- mouse model.", 
    "44": "In the Simvastatin and Ezetimibe in Aortic Stenosis (SEAS) trial, combined ezetimibe (10 mg) and simvastatin (40 mg) decreased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 50% and ischemic cardiovascular event (ICE) risk by 22% compared to placebo. A larger decrease in ICE risk might have been expected for the degree of lipid-lowering observed. This analysis investigated relations between changes in lipoprotein components (LCs), and ICE risk decrease in the SEAS trial in all patients, by severity of aortic stenosis (AS), and compared to results of other clinical trials. A total of 1,570 patients with baseline aortic jet velocity (JV) data, baseline and 1-year low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B, and no ICEs during the first year were included in the analysis. Relations between on-treatment measurements of 1-year LCs and time-to-ICE occurrence were assessed in all patients and in JV tertiles (<2.8, 2.8 to 3.3, and >3.3 m/s). Observed and predicted ICE risk decreases were compared by Cox model. Decreases in LCs after 1 year of ezetimibe plus simvastatin were associated with decreased ICE risk in all patients and in the 2 lower JV tertiles (p <0.05 to <0.001) but not in tertile 3. In JV tertiles 1 and 2, ICE risk decreased by 47% and 36%, respectively, was reasonably well predicted by all LCs, and was consistent with findings from meta-regression analyses in other populations. In conclusion, the degree of lipid lowering by ezetimibe plus simvastatin may predict the extent of ICE risk decrease in patients with mild AS, but ICE risk prediction in patients with more severe AS is confounded by AS-associated cardiovascular events and a shorter interval of exposure to lipid lowering.", 
    "45": "Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is commonly caused by mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), apolipoprotein B, and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 genes. The study aim was to investigate patients with FH in Taiwan, using molecular diagnostic methods, and compare the abnormalities in the small mutation and large DNA rearrangement subgroups. In total, 102 unrelated probands with FH were tested for mutations by exon-by-exon sequence analysis (EBESA) and multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). EBESA identified gene apolipoprotein B R3500W in 8 probands and 25 mis-sense, 5 nonsense, and 6 frameshift LDLR mutations in 52 probands; 11 were novel mutations. Of the 42 probands with mutations undetected by EBESA, 8 had abnormal MLPA patterns, including 2 with exon 6 to 18 deletions, 2 with exon 9 deletion, 1 with exon 6 to 8 deletions, 1 with exon 11 deletion, 1 with exon 3 to 5 duplications, and 1 with exon 7 to 12 duplications. Pedigree analysis showed mutation cosegregation with hypercholesterolemia in affected family members. Mean lipid profiles and rate of failure to lower LDL cholesterol <100 mg/dl in response to rosuvastatin/ezetimibe treatment were similar in groups with abnormal MLPA patterns and groups carrying nonsense or frameshift mutations. In conclusion, frequency of large LDLR rearrangement was approximately 8% in Taiwanese patients with FH. The response to statin drugs differed between probands with abnormal MLPA patterns and probands carrying mis-sense or undetected mutations.", 
    "46": "Mounting evidence suggests that statins possess antiarrhythmic properties and inhibit atrial fibrillation (AF). The goal of this study was to evaluate the relation between statin use and new-onset AF in a large cohort of patients with coronary artery disease. We identified all Medicare beneficiaries > or =65 years old who had been hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization from 1995 to 2004 and participated in 1 of 2 government-sponsored medication benefit programs. Patients with a history of AF before and during hospitalization were excluded. This yielded a cohort of 29,088. The incidence of new AF was compared between patients who were (n = 8,450) and were not (n = 20,638) prescribed statins within 1 month of hospital discharge after their cardiac event. New-onset AFs within 5 and 10 years were 32.6% and 51.2%, respectively, in patients who received statins compared to 38.3% and 58.0% in patients who did not receive statins (unadjusted hazard ratio 0.82, 95% confidence interval 0.78 to 0.86). Multivariable analysis controlling for demographic and clinical confounders indicated that statin use independently decreased the risk of developing new-onset AF compared to nonusers (adjusted hazard ratio 0.90, 95% confidence interval 0.85 to 0.94). Adjustment for propensity-score and health-seeking behaviors yielded nearly identical results. In conclusion, statin therapy initiated within 1 month after hospital discharge is independently associated with a decrease in the risk of new-onset AF after myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization. These findings lend support to the antiarrhythmic effects of statins and suggest another benefit for their use in patients with coronary artery disease.", 
    "47": "Fatty-acid-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress has been recently described as a novel mechanism involved in the genesis of atherosclerosis. Here we show that statins, a class of drug widely employed in the clinical management of hypercholesterolemia, reduces lipid-induced macrophage endoplasmic reticulum stress in an isolated cell system and in LDL receptor knockout mice. Given the importance of endoplasmic reticulum stress as an inducer of inflammation, we suspect that the novel mechanism of action herein described for statins may play a major role on its beneficial effects in the prevention of cardiovascular disease.", 
    "48": "This study aimed to evaluate the effect of rosuvastatin upon structural and ultrastructural aortic remodeling in a rat model of hypertension induced by NO synthase blockade. Wistar rats were divided into 4 groups: Control group (C); control treated with rosuvastatin 20mg/kg/day (CR); L-NAME group 40 mg/kg/day (LN) and L-NAME treated with rosuvastatin (LNR) (same doses). Body mass and blood pressure were measured weekly; the experiment lasted 5 weeks. L-NAME administration augmented blood pressure (BP) in the LN group in comparison to the C group (123.3 vs. 180.5 mm Hg at week 5). In LNR rats, rosuvastatin slightly attenuated BP rise, but it had no effect on the BP of CR group. Intima and media thickening of the thoracic aorta were observed in the LN group, and increased elastic fiber content as well. Rosuvastatin prevented all these alterations as seen in the LNR group. Ultrastructural changes due to L-NAME intake (intracellular vesicles and altered membrane morphology in endothelial cells, extracellular matrix deposition, and cytoplasmatic projections from smooth muscle cells toward the internal elastic lamina) were also prevented by rosuvastatin. All in all, rosuvastatin administration is capable of attenuating ultrastructural aortic wall remodeling in NO-deficient rats despite small changes in blood pressure.", 
    "49": "Stroke is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Asia, and its pattern is changing. The incidence of haemorrhagic stroke is declining while the incidence of ischaemic stroke caused by large artery atherothromboembolism is increasing secondary to an increase in the prevalence of hypercholesterolaemia. The Working Group on Stroke and Lipids Management in Asia Consensus Panel assembled leading experts from the region to reach a consensus on how to address this challenge. The group discussed the observational epidemiology of the relationship between cholesterol and risk of stroke, the clinical trial evidence base for cholesterol-lowering for stroke prevention, and issues specific to stroke and lipid management for Asian doctors and patients. Stroke guidelines from many of the Asian countries have recently recommended consideration of statins for recurrent stroke prevention in patients with previous ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack. However, because these recommendations have yet to be implemented widely, there is a need to educate Asian physicians and patients about the importance of adequate control of hypercholesterolaemia. Further trials of statins in Asian patients are also needed, particularly in those with intracranial stenosis.", 
    "50": "Neurorestorative therapy is the next frontier in the treatment of stroke. An expanding body of evidence supports the theory that after stroke, certain cellular changes occur that resemble early stages of development. Increased expression of developmental proteins in the area bordering the infarct suggest an active repair or reconditioning response to ischemic injury. Neurorestorative therapy targets parenchymal cells (neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocyes, and endothelial cells) to enhance endogenous neurogenesis, angiogenesis, axonal sprouting, and synaptogenesis to promote functional recovery. Pharmacological treatments include statins, phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitors, erythropoietin, and nitric oxide donors that have all improved functional outcome after stroke in the preclinical arena. Thymosin beta4 (Tbeta4) is expressed in both the developing and adult brain and it has been shown to stimulate vasculogenesis, angiogenesis, and arteriogenesis in the postnatal and adult murine cardiac myocardium.

    "51": "We report a case of branch atheromatous disease (BAD) presenting capsular warning syndrome, who subsequently showed a complete recovery by the combination therapy as described below. A 54-year-old man with untreated hypertension was admitted to our hospital because of dysarthria and right hemiplegia. The NIHSS on admission was 12 points, but his symptoms soon completely disappeared during examination. After admission administration of aspirin, heparin, atorvastatin and t-PA were started, but stereotyped episodes of dysarthria and the right hemiplegia occurred repeatedly. We added plasma expander, and he thereafter revealed no further ischemic episodes at 22 hours from admission. Over all, he had 15 times of transient ischemic attack with no lasting deficit. The DWI scan obtained 5 hours after the onset demonstrated a high-intensity region in the left putamen to corona radiata. MRA showed no significant abnormalities. He had been diagnosed as having branch atheromatous disease with capsular warning syndrome. The present case suggests that combination therapy including t-PA and plasma expander may be effective to BAD presenting capsular warning syndrome.",

    "53": "A total of 241 BAV patients who were referred to this hospital for cardiac surgery over a 4.75-year period were included in this study. In addition to the clinical characteristics of the included patients, the morphological features of the aortic valve and aorta, the length of the left main coronary artery, and the laboratory findings (the coagulation and hematological parameters as well as the total cholesterol concentration) were determined and compared with those of the tricuspid aortic valve (TAV) patients.",

Most of the BAVs that were surgically treated were stenotic, regurgitant, or combined, and only 19 (7.88%) were normally functioning valves. According to echocardiography or operative records, 148 (78.31%) were type A, 31 (16.40%) were type B, and 10 (5.29%) were type C. The left main coronary artery was much shorter in the BAV patients than it was in the TAV patients. There was no significant difference between BAV and TAV patients in the total cholesterol concentrations; whereas differences were noted between patients receiving lipid-lowering therapy and those not receiving lipid-lowering therapy. The dimensions of the aortic root, sinotubular junction, and ascending aorta were beyond normal limits, while they were significantly smaller in the BAV patients than in the TAV patients. They were also much smaller in patients receiving statin therapy than those not receiving statin therapy in both groups. Moreover, the aortic dilation in the BAV group was found to be significantly associated with patient age.", 
    "55": "The BAV patients developed aortic wall and aortic valve disorders at a younger age than the TAV patients and were predominantly male. Aortic dilation was observed in the aortic root, sinotubular junction, and ascending aortic segments in both the BAV and TAV patients undergoing surgical aortic valve replacement, although the BAV patients had a smaller degree of dilation than the TAV patients, and dilation was also significantly age-related in this group. The shorter left main coronary artery that the BAV patients possess may contribute to the progressive course of aortic dilation that these patients experience. Statin therapy did not affect the aortic annulus in either group, but did decrease the dimensions of the aortic root, sinotubular junction and ascending aorta. In general, statin therapy had a better effect on the aortas of the TAV patients than it did on those of the BAV patients.",

In this study, we examined the ability of pretreatment with \u03b1LA and CoQ combination in rabbits to protect the bladder from contractile damage mediated by either hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) or in vitro ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) which represents two in vitro models of oxidative damage.",

This mitochondrial enzyme catalyzes the common final step of leucine degradation and ketogenesis. Acute symptoms include vomiting, seizures and lethargy, accompanied by metabolic acidosis and hypoketotic hypoglycaemia. Such organs as the liver, brain, pancreas, and heart can also be involved. However, the pathophysiology of this disease is only partially understood. We measured mRNA levels, protein expression and enzyme activity of human HMG-CoA lyase from liver, kidney, pancreas, testis, heart, skeletal muscle, and brain. Surprisingly, the pancreas is, after the liver, the tissue with most HL activity. However, in heart and adult brain, HL activity was not detected in the mitochondrial fraction. These findings contribute to our understanding of the enzyme function and the consequences of its deficiency and suggest the need for assessment of pancreatic damage in these patients.",

The management of severe hypertriglyceridemia (chylomicronemia syndrome) includes aggressive reduction of triglycerides with intravenous insulin, fibrates, omega-3 fatty acids, and/or niacin therapy to avert the risk of pancreatitis. In patients with mild to moderate hypertriglyceridemia, the treatment of choice is statin therapy to achieve the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) target goals. The evidence base would favor niacin therapy in combination with statin therapy to achieve the goals pertaining to LDL cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol.

The antinociceptive effect was assessed by chemically- (formalin, acetic acid) and thermally- (hot plate) induced nociception, while anti-inflammatory effect was evaluated using carrageenan-, formaldehyde-induced paw oedema and cotton pellet-induced granuloma. The effect of atorvastatin and rosuvastatin on liver antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase, glutathione, LPO, CAT along with the effect on lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) was evaluated in the cotton pellet-induced granuloma model. Atorvastatin and rosuvastatin showed significant decrease (p < 0.05) in carrageenan- and formaldehyde-induced rat paw oedema and reduced granuloma formation in the cotton pellet-induced granuloma method (p < 0.01) while the levels of LDH and ALP were also significantly decreased (p < 0.05). The liver antioxidant enzyme levels were found to be restored (p < 0.05). Atorvastatin and rosuvastatin also showed antinociceptive activities (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01) in the acetic acid- and formalin-induced nociception in mice, while there was no significant activity in the hot plate method. The present findings suggest that atorvastatin and rosuvastatin possess dose-dependent antioxidant, analgesic, and anti-inflammatory activities.",

Evidence for the role of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in risk has led to a series of clinical guidelines/recommendations on the importance of LDL lowering with statin treatment. There is also substantial evidence on a number of lipoproteins in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis and CV events. Health care professionals have not embraced easily novel approaches to identifying those at increased risk and more aggressive treatment. This is especially true for non-LDL factors. The use of non-statin drugs such as fibrates has been modest and many health care professionals avoid consideration of combination therapy due to an inordinate fear of toxicity. This review will attempt to provide appropriate background information on lipids/lipoproteins, including non-high density lipoprotein and risk, as well as data available on fibrates and combination pharmacologic therapy.

Here, we present a combination chemical genetic study to explore how the sterol and protein prenylation pathways work together to affect hepatitis C viral replication in a replicon assay. In addition to finding novel targets affecting viral replication, our data suggest that the viral replication is strongly affected by sterol pathway regulation. There is a marked transition from antagonistic to synergistic antiviral effects as the combination targets shift downstream along the sterol pathway. We also show how pathway regulation frustrates potential hepatitis C therapies based on the sterol pathway, and reveal novel synergies that selectively inhibit hepatitis C replication over host toxicity. In particular, combinations targeting the downstream sterol pathway enzymes produced robust and selective synergistic inhibition of hepatitis C replication. Our findings show how combination chemical genetics can reveal critical pathway connections relevant to viral replication, and can identify potential treatments with an increased therapeutic window.",

A combination tablet containing both amlodipine besylate and atorvastatin calcium has recently been approved for the treatment of hypertension and dyslipidemia in a growing number of countries. We decided to undertake a thorough literature search to evaluate the effects of amlodipine and atorvastatin in hypertensive hypercholesterolemic patients on blood pressure values, lipid profile values and, when available, data on small- and large-artery compliance, left ventricular mass index, and inflammatory parameters. From the data collected, it emerged that in hypertensive and hypercholesterolemic patients, the combination of amlodipine plus atorvastatin is more effective than the single drugs alone in reducing blood pressure and in improving lipid profile. Furthermore the combination of amlodipine plus atorvastatin also improved small-artery compliance, inflammatory markers, left ventricular hypertrophy and reduced uric acid faster and more effectively than the single drugs taken alone. For these reasons, the combination of amlodipine plus atorvastatin could be the treatment of choice in hypertensive and hypercholesterolemic patients.",

Old (e.g., clofibrate) and new (e.g., torcetrapib and ezetimibe) agents, with similar or more intense beneficial effect over lipoproteins, do not reproduce the beneficial effects of statins. Besides their anti-inflammatory and other pleiotropic effects, a blood pressure-lowering effect could be an additional mechanism of cardiovascular protection of statins. Large trials of statins in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease did not report an effect on blood pressure, but the use of blood pressure-lowering agents was left to the discretion of physicians during the trial. Post hoc analyses of small trials and a meta-analysis of some of them have suggested that statins could lower systolic blood pressure by approximately 4 mmHg, particularly in patients with high blood pressure. Most studies, however, had small samples and were not blinded. Others had a cross-over or observational design. The overall view of these studies rules out a substantial blood pressure-lowering effect of statins. An effect restricted to subjects with high blood pressure could ultimately derive from the anti-inflammatory effect of statins, since higher levels of C-reactive protein are associated with higher blood pressure. An unequivocal demonstration of an antihypertensive effect of statins, however, is still lacking, and a randomized trial with enough power to evaluate blood pressure variation in a large range of blood pressure values is required to demonstrate whether statins definitely have an antihypertensive effect.",

We compared the results of the medial (MA) and dorsal (posterior) surgical approach (DA). Fifty patients (44 males/6 females; median age [range]: 59 [49-84] years) treated for 58 atherosclerotic PAAs were studied (MA: 29 PAAs; DA: 29 PAAs). The 3-year graft patency rates were higher after DA compared with MA (76% vs 52%, respectively), but the difference was not significant (P = .056). There were no differences between the 2 approaches in amputation, restenosis, reoperation, and wound infection rates. Dorsal approach and the MA may be alternative approaches with similar long-term results. Due to the controversial results reported so far, a meta-analysis may be necessary to establish the surgical approach-of-choice. Future studies should take into account additional factors, other than the surgical technique, when assessing outcome (eg, preoperative statin use, age, and emergency vs routine surgery).",

    "133": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most frequent arrhythmia found in clinical practice. The majority of patients with AF are still candidates for antiarrhythmic drug treatment, not only for acute reversion to sinus rhythm but also for long-term treatment to prevent recurrences of AF. Currently available antiarrhythmic drugs, however, are unable to provide complete efficacy in all patients, and present problematic risks of proarrhythmia. The progressively increasing prevalence of AF supports the need to develop improved therapeutic approaches for the clinical management of arrhythmia. Accordingly, new treatment techniques aimed at suppressing the origin of the arrhythmogenic foci have been developed in the last decade. However, ablative treatments are only available for selected patients. Because of these factors, and also because primary prevention of AF should be our goal, the introduction of non-antiarrhythmic agents that could prevent both new-onset AF and recurrences of AF may eventually improve patient outcomes and reduce the incidence of this epidemic disease. The potential clinical value of these non-antiarrhythmic options is currently under active investigation. There is now clinical and experimental evidence that many drugs may have beneficial effects in preventing AF through several possible mechanisms. Non-antiarrhythmic drugs, such as ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), corticosteroids, and N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids may have a positive effect in patients with AF or in preventing AF in patients at risk.",

HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have recently been shown to reduce the incidence of ventricular tachycardia (VT)/fibrillation (VF) and sudden cardiac death, and this has been attributed to their pleiotropic effects. However, it is unclear whether this occurs through an 'indirect' anti-ischemic or 'direct' antiarrhythmic effect. We systematically reviewed articles published on MEDLINE between January 1996 and December 2009 focusing on the reduction of VT/VF and sudden cardiac death by statins and the potential mechanisms. Studies reporting sudden cardiac death or VT/VF outcomes with statin use (n = 23) or the pathophysiology of sudden cardiac death reduction by statins (n = 19) were included. We found that statins have been shown to reduce VT/VF and sudden cardiac death only in subjects with underlying coronary artery disease or ischemic cardiomyopathy. No definite benefits were seen with statins in sudden cardiac death and VT/VF in patients with non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. There is insufficient evidence to point toward a benefit in populations at low risk for VT/VF. In conclusion, an anti-ischemic rather than a primary antiarrhythmic effect emerges as the likely mechanism of sudden cardiac death reduction with statins.",

However, research into palliative care for these patients has thus far been limited. Furthermore, there has been little discussion in the literature regarding medication use in patients with advanced dementia who are nearing the end of life, and discontinuation of medication has not been well studied despite its potential to reduce the burden on the patient and to improve quality of life. There is limited, and sometimes contradictory, evidence available in the literature to guide evidence-based discontinuation of drugs such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, antipsychotic agents, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), antibacterials, antihypertensives, antihyperglycaemic drugs and anticoagulants. Furthermore, end-of-life care of patients with advanced dementia may be complicated by difficulties in accurately estimating life expectancy, ethical considerations regarding withholding or withdrawing treatment, and the wishes of the patient and/or their family. Significant research must be undertaken in the area of medication discontinuation in patients with advanced dementia nearing the end of life to determine how physicians currently decide whether medications should be discontinued, and also to develop the evidence base and provide guidance on systematic medication discontinuation.", 
    "136": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease of the central nervous system and current MS treatment is only partially effective. Recent data suggest that statins may be potent immunomodulatory agents. In order to evaluate their role in MS, we analyzed the in vitro effects of interferon (IFN)-beta and lovastatin on the differentiation and maturation of monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) of MS patients. Twenty-seven patients with relapsing-remitting MS were recruited for the study. DC differentiation and maturation were evaluated based on surface phenotypic changes and the expressions of CD14, CD83, CD1a, CD80, CD86, CD206, and C209 were analyzed by flow cytometry. The results showed that IFN-beta and lovastatin affect DC phenotype. Both agents decrease the expression of CD1a, which indicates a weakened presentation of glycolipid antigens. IFN-beta causes up-regulated and lovastatin down-regulated expression of CD86, which results in a biased Th-cell responses in MS. Furthermore, high doses of lovastatin cause a decrease in CD209 expression on the surface of DCs and can limit their migration to various tissues. One of the mechanisms of the beneficial action of IFN-beta and statins may be associated with their influence on DCs.",

Generalized estimating equations were used to assess the influence of drug therapy on LDL subfraction distribution, controlling for within-subject patterns (clustering). We adjusted for age, body mass index, and baseline concentrations of LDL-C and triglycerides.

PCSK9 is secreted by the liver into the plasma and binds the hepatic LDL receptor (LDLR), causing its subsequent degradation. We first demonstrated that a moderate dose of atorvastatin (40 mg) increases PCSK9 serum levels, suggesting why increasing statin doses may have diminished efficacy with regard to further LDL-C lowering. Since that initial observation, at least two other groups have reported statin-induced PCSK9 increases. To date, no analysis of the effect of high-dose atorvastatin (80 mg) on PCSK9 over time has been conducted. Therefore, we studied the time course of atorvastatin (80 mg) in human subjects. We measured PCSK9 and lipid levels during a 2-week lead-in baseline period and every 4 weeks thereafter for 16 weeks. We observed that atorvastatin (80 mg) caused a rapid 47% increase in serum PCSK9 at 4 weeks that was sustained throughout 16 weeks of dosing. Importantly, while PCSK9 levels were highly correlated with total cholesterol (TC), LDL-C, and triglyceride (TG) levels at baseline, atorvastatin (80 mg) completely abolished all of these correlations. Together, these results further suggest an explanation for why increasing doses of statins fail to achieve proportional LDL-C lowering.",

It has also been reported that statins and RAS (renin-angiotensin system) inhibition and have anti-atherosclerotic properties. In the present study, we have investigated whether miR-146a/b was expressed with the TLR4 signal in CAD patients, and whether combined treatment with a statin and RAS inhibition might affect these levels. A total of 66 patients with CAD and 33 subjects without CAD (non-CAD) were enrolled. Patients with CAD were randomized to 12 months of combined treatment with atorvastatin and telmisartan [an ARB (angiotensin II receptor blocker)] or atorvastatin and enalapril [an ACEI (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor)]. PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) were obtained from peripheral blood at baseline and after 12 months. Levels of miR-146a/b, IRAK1 mRNA, TRAF6 mRNA and TLR4 mRNA/TLR4 protein were significantly higher in the CAD group than in the non-CAD group (all P<0.01). Levels of miR-146a/b were positively correlated with IRAK1 mRNA and TRAF6 mRNA levels. After 12 months of treatment, these levels were markedly decreased in the ARB and ACEI groups, with the decrease in the ARB group being greater than that in the ACEI group (all P<0.05). In our 12-month follow-up study, high levels of miR-146a and TLR4 mRNA/TLR4 protein at baseline were independent predictors of cardiac events. The present study demonstrates that combined treatment with an ARB and a statin decreases miR-146a/b and the TLR4 signal in CAD patients, possibly contributing to the anti-atherogenic effects of ARBs and statins in this disorder.",

The aims of this study were to predict the relationships between the effect of rosuvastatin and various factors such as poor compliance, and morning and evening dosages, as well as the change in the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin. We characterized the PK/PD model of plasma mevalonic acid (MVA) profiles after rosuvastatin administration and simulated the plasma MVA concentration in various dosage regimens. The plasma rosuvastatin and MVA concentrations reported by Martin et al. were used as the source of PK/PD modeling data. For each simulation, a summary parameter, the area under the plasma MVA concentration-time curves for 24 h in the steady state (AUEC(24)), was used to characterize the time course of each endpoint. To estimate the influence of PK parameters on rosuvastatin effects, the AUEC(24) reduction ratio of baseline levels was simulated from the 0.33-3.0-fold value of each PK parameter estimate. The AUEC(24) reduction ratio was 7.7% lower after morning administration than after evening administration. The changes in the PK parameters more prominently affected the AUEC(24) reduction ratio after morning administration than after evening administration. The simulated plasma MVA concentrations almost reached their baseline levels in the case of patients who forgot to take rosuvastatin. These results suggest that the parameters can be used to determine the effective rosuvastatin dosage regimen.",

We have explored the effect of chronic cholesterol depletion induced by mevastatin on the function of human serotonin(1A) receptors expressed in CHO cells. An advantage with statins is that cholesterol depletion is chronic which mimics physiological conditions. Our results show a significant reduction in the level of specific ligand binding and G-protein coupling to serotonin(1A) receptors upon chronic cholesterol depletion, although the membrane receptor level is not reduced at all. Interestingly, replenishment of mevastatin-treated cells with cholesterol resulted in the recovery of specific ligand binding and G-protein coupling. Treatment of cells expressing serotonin(1A) receptors with mevastatin led to a decrease in the diffusion coefficient and an increase in the mobile fraction of the receptor, as determined by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching measurements. To the best of our knowledge, these results constitute the first report describing the effect of chronic cholesterol depletion on the organization and function of a G-protein-coupled neuronal receptor. Our results assume significance in view of recent reports highlighting the symptoms of anxiety and depression in humans upon statin administration, and the role of serotonin(1A) receptors in anxiety and depression.",

The authors aimed to investigate the effect of the CYP3AP1*3 polymorphism on the lipid-lowering efficacy of statins. They recruited 379 unrelated hyperlipidemic patients: 202 (103 men) treated with simvastatin and 177 (87 men) with atorvastatin as single-agent therapy (20 mg day(-1) orally) for 4 weeks. CYP3AP1*3(-44G>A) was genotyped using the PCR restriction fragment-length polymorphism method. Serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides (TGs) were determined before and after treatment. The frequency of the CYP3AP1*3 variant allele in Chinese hyperlipidemic patients was 70.6%. In the simvastatin treatment group, the percentage reduction of LDL-C level was greater in the CYP3AP1*3/*3 carriers than in the CYP3AP1*1 carriers. This difference was statistically significant for women but not for men. In contrast, the authors found no significant association between the lipid-lowering efficacy of atorvastatin and the CYP3AP1*3 polymorphism in all participants. However, in women, the percentage change of the TC level was significantly lower in the CYP3AP1*3/*3 carriers than in the CYP3AP1*1 carriers. These findings suggest that the CYP3AP1*3 allele may be a biomarker for the lipid-lowering efficacy of simvastatin and atorvastatin in Chinese women with hyperlipidemia.",

Patients with solid organ transplants are frequently treated with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). CsA increases atorvastatin systemic exposure severalfold, an effect not observed with Tac. The effect of CsA and Tac on atorvastatin transport via OATP1B1 was investigated in transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells. An in vitro-in vivo extrapolation (IVIVE) was performed to estimate the clinical potential for CsA and Tac to inhibit OATP1B1-mediated transport. CsA inhibited OATP1B1-mediated uptake of atorvastatin approximately 90-fold more efficiently than Tac, with half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) values of 0.021 +/- 0.004 and 1.99 +/- 0.42 muM, respectively. Coincubation compared with preincubation with CsA showed a 20-fold lower inhibitory capacity, with an IC(50) value of 0.47 +/- 0.34 muM. The IVIVE showed that clinically obtainable concentrations of CsA, but not Tac, inhibit OATP1B1 transport of atorvastatin. CsA inhibition ranged from 28 to 77% within a dosing interval, whereas it was less than 1% for Tac, considering free concentrations and assuming competitive inhibition. This does not fully explain the clinically observed interaction with CsA, suggesting that a more complex inhibitory mechanism may be present. This is also supported by the decreased IC(50) value of CsA after preincubation. This study provides evidence that OATP1B1 inhibition is a relevant mechanism for the interaction observed between CsA and atorvastatin.",

In this article, we discuss the molecular mechanisms of HDL-C elevation by statins and its effect on HDL functions. We summarize the reports to date on the effects of statins on various proteins, enzymes and receptors involved in reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), which is one of the protective systems against atherosclerosis. Since statins increase the synthesis of apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) and HDL neogenesis in the liver, the HDL-C-increasing effect of statins may reflect RCT activation. Moreover, HDL has pleiotropic effects, including anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects, as well as RCT. In the future, it may be necessary to assess the functions of HDL elevated by statins, and select statins based on differences in their effects in clinical practice.", 
    "200": "The study was aimed to investigate the protective effects of rosuvastatin on spinal cord ischemia in rats and to determine the effects of this agent on the expressions of nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Spinal cord ischemia was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by occluding the descending thoracic aorta. Experimental groups (n=30 per group) were as follows: sham operation, control (receiving only normal saline), rosuvastatin (5 mg/kg/day for 10 days before occlusion), and rosuvastatin-mevalonate (5 mg/kg/day rosuvastatin and 5 mg/kg/day mevalonate for 10 days before occlusion). Neurological function was assessed at 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h after reperfusion. After 72 h reperfusion, spinal cords were harvested for 2,3,5,-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining, TUNEL staining, and nitric oxide (NO) assay. Immunohistochemistry, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blot were performed to determine the expressions of inducible, endothelial, and neuronal NOS (iNOS, eNOS, and nNOS) in rats with spinal cord ischemia. Spinal cord ischemia thus induced was marked by neurological dysfunction, spinal infarction, and neural cell apoptosis in animals. The results show that rosuvastatin significantly reduced the motor disturbance and the volume of infarctions and attenuated apoptotic neural cells death in the treated rats. Treatment with rosuvastatin remarkably decreased the NO level in spinal cord tissue. In addition, rosuvastatin inhibited iNOS mRNA and protein expression and increased eNOS mRNA and protein expression. However, rosuvastatin had no influence on nNOS mRNA and protein expression. Administrations of mevalonate completely reversed the changes caused by rosuvastatin. These results indicate that rosuvastatin can protect rat spinal cord against ischemia injury by modulation of NOS expressions.", 
    "201": "Systemic inflammatory activity has turned out to play a key pathogenic role in vascular atherosclerosis, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Inflammatory biomarkers may therefore be a valuable tool for risk evaluation. Among them, the best evidence to date supports the use of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) to monitor insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk in diabetic and nondiabetic individuals. Data suggest that hs-CRP may also participate directly in the process of atherogenesis. A growing number of clinical trials tested the hypothesis that antidiabetic drugs specifically targeting insulin resistance could benefit individuals by reducing inflammation, atherogenesis, and thus cardiovascular risk. One such class are the thiazolidinediones (pioglitazone and rosiglitazone). These agents act as selective ligands of the nuclear transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma). This article reviewed published data on hs-CRP changes with the thiazolidinedione agent pioglitazone. Here we found pronounced insulin-sensitizing and anti-inflammatory properties in different clinical settings, including diabetic and nondiabetic individuals. Coadministration of pioglitazone to antilipidemic statin therapy resulted in additional effects on low-grade inflammation, and hs-CRP reduction has been demonstrated to occur independently of glucose lowering. The anti-inflammatory effect appeared to be a rapid physiologic reaction on PPARgamma activation and could be observed within a short-term interval after starting pioglitazone therapy. In summary, clinical study results underline the benefit of an early insulin resistance treatment to oppose systemic vascular inflammation and cardiometabolic syndrome in patients with elevated levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein.",

The advent of statin therapy has allowed optimization of the lipid profile and achievement of therapeutic goals advocated by the Adult Treatment Panel of the National Cholesterol Education Program. Statin therapy has been demonstrated to exhibit a wide variety of nonlipid or pleiotropic effects. Observational studies have demonstrated that statin therapy may cause a small but statistically significant alteration of blood pressure. Prospective clinical trials have demonstrated that statin therapy reduces this cardiovascular risk in both hypertensive and normotensive individuals. The potential role of statin therapy in blood pressure reduction is compatible with several pleiotropic mechanisms of statin therapy. However, a significant body of data from prospective, well-designed, controlled clinical trials that have analyzed the effect of statin therapy on blood pressure as the primary end point is lacking.

    "225": "Life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias such as sustained ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation are responsible for two thirds of sudden cardiac deaths annually in the United States. Implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) therapy prevents mortality from arrhythmic death but is expensive and has some associated morbidity from proarrhythmia and mechanical malfunction. Furthermore, ICDs treat ventricular arrhythmias but do not prevent them. Antiarrhythmic drugs (AADs) can be used for acute or chronic therapy to prevent ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac deaths. AADS are often used in patients with an ICD who have recurrent ICD shocks resulting from ventricular arrhythmias. Class I AADs are contraindicated in patients with structural heart disease. Other than amiodarone, all Class III drugs have either a neutral or deleterious effect on mortality. Dronedarone, a new Class III drug, may reduce mortality, but more information is needed to be sure. A class of drugs that do not qualify as an AAD can modify cardiovascular remodeling processes and have a delayed and indirect antiarrhythmic effect. These so-called \"nonantiarrhythmic drugs\" such as drugs acting on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, fish oil, and statins can reduce the likelihood of future ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation in patients with coronary artery disease or congestive heart failure. The role of AADs for chronic therapy for primary and secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death is problematic because of proarrhythmia and adverse side effects. Because these nonantiarrhythmic drugs are well tolerated and have no proarrhythmic actions, their benefits should outweigh risks.", 
    "226": "Background. Statin use in renal transplantation has been associated with a lower risk of patient death but not with an improvement of graft functional survival. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of statin use in graft survival, death-censored graft survival and patient survival using the data recorded on the Spanish Late Allograft Dysfunction Study Group.Patients and methods. Patients receiving a renal allograft in Spain in 1990, 1994, 1998 and 2002 were considered. Since the mean follow-up in the 2002 cohort was 3 years, statin use was analysed considering its introduction during the first year or during the initial 2 years after transplantation. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses with a propensity score for statin use were employed to analyse graft survival, death-censored graft survival and patient survival.Results. In the 4682 evaluated patients, the early statin use after transplantation significantly increased from 1990 to 2002 (12.7%, 27.9%, 47.7% and 53.0%, P < 0.001). Statin use during the first year was not associated with graft or patient survival. Statin use during the initial 2 years was associated with a lower risk of graft failure (relative risk [RR] = 0.741 and 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.635-0.866, P < 0.001) and patient death (RR = 0.806 and 95% CI = 0.656-0.989, P = 0.039). Death-censored graft survival was not associated with statin use during the initial 2 years.Conclusion. The early introduction of statin treatment after transplantation is associated with a significant decrease in late graft failure due to a risk reduction in patient death.", 
    "227": "The effects of various statins on platelet aggregation in blood samples from normal and diabetic rabbits were measured. All of the statins used in our study inhibited platelet aggregation by about 20% at 1 microM. Our results show that diabetes increased the rate of platelet aggregation from 48 +/- 5% to 72 +/- 8%, however, statins inhibited the rate of platelet aggregation by about 60% (p < 0.01). The addition of leptin (125 ng/ml) to blood samples from healthy rabbits increased the aggregation rate to about 64%, but statins decreased this rate to about 26%. Our results indicate that diabetes increases the rate of platelet aggregation in rabbits and increases antiplatelet efficacy of statins due to interactions with leptin.", 
    "228": "Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors play a role in nitric oxide synthesis. In this study, the impact of simvastatin (SV) on the levels of nitric oxide synthases, and arginine (Arg) and its derivatives was evaluated in rat liver under ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) conditions. Rats received SV (25 mg/kg) (groups S and S-IR) or saline solution (groups C and C-IR) intragastrically for 21 days. The livers of groups C and S were homogenized after treatment while those of groups C-IR and S-IR underwent ischemia and reperfusion before homogenization. Endothelial (eNOS) and inducible (iNOS) nitric oxide synthase concentrations were determined in the homogenates. Alanine and asparagine aminotransferase (ALT, AST, respectively), arginine (Arg), and asymmetric (ADMA) and symmetric (SDMA) methylarginine levels were determined in the blood before I/R and during reperfusion. I/R injury produced significant increases in aminotransferase, ADMA, eNOS, and iNOS, but decreases in Arg and Arg/ADMA levels. Arg concentration increased significantly after warm ischemia in the S-IR group, but decreased significantly during the first 30 minutes of reperfusion in both the S-IR and C-IR groups. eNOS concentration was significantly higher in group S than in group C. Both I/R and SV exerted no influence on SDMA concentration. SV exerted a protective action by increasing eNOS levels under normal conditions and Arg levels after ischemia and by preventing a significant increase in iNOS concentration after I/R. SV had no effect on ADMA concentration under normal and pathological conditions.", 
    "229": "The Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) trial showed statins reduce vascular risk among patients with atherosclerotic stroke or transient ischemic attack. In this study, we assessed recent nationwide trends in discharge statin treatment after acute stroke and the influence of SPARCL on clinical practice.", 
    "230": "Using data from eligible patients with stroke and transient ischemic attack admitted to Get With The Guidelines-Stroke (GWTG-Stroke) -participating hospitals between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2007, we assessed discharge statin use over time and in relation to dissemination of the SPARCL results.", 
    "231": "Among 173,284 patients with ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack, overall discharge statin treatment was 83.5%. Discharge statin prescription climbed steadily but modestly over the 2-year study period from 75.7% to 84.8% (P<0.001) with a nonsignificant increase during SPARCL reporting but a return to prior levels thereafter. Factors associated with lower discharge statin use in patients without contraindications included female sex and South region.", 
    "232": "Discharge statin prescription among hospitalized patients with stroke increased over time, but 1 in 5 patients still leaves the hospital without treatment. Primary drivers of increased use were secular trends and individual/hospital site characteristics.", 
    "233": "Novel therapies are desperately needed for radiation-induced lung injury (RILI), which, despite aggressive corticosteroid therapy, remains a potentially fatal and dose-limiting complication of thoracic radiotherapy. We assessed the utility of simvastatin, an anti-inflammatory and lung barrier-protective agent, in a dose- and time-dependent murine model of RILI (18-(25 Gy). Simvastatin reduced multiple RILI indices, including vascular leak, leukocyte infiltration, and histological evidence of oxidative stress, while reversing RILI-associated dysregulated gene expression, including p53, nuclear factor-erythroid-2-related factor, and sphingolipid metabolic pathway genes. To identify key regulators of simvastatin-mediated RILI protection, we integrated whole-lung gene expression data obtained from radiated and simvastatin-treated mice with protein-protein interaction network analysis (single-network analysis of proteins). Topological analysis of the gene product interaction network identified eight top-prioritized genes (Ccna2a, Cdc2, fcer1 g, Syk, Vav3, Mmp9, Itgam, Cd44) as regulatory nodes within an activated RILI network. These studies identify the involvement of specific genes and gene networks in RILI pathobiology, and confirm that statins represent a novel strategy to limit RILI.", 
    "234": "Neointimal hyperplasia is the major cause of vascular access failure in hemodialysis patients. Statins reduce neointimal hyperplasia in experimental models, which may reduce access failure. The study presented here evaluated whether vascular access outcomes are superior in patients receiving statin therapy than in those not on statins.", 
    "235": "A prospective computerized vascular access database was retrospectively queried to determine the access outcomes of 601 patients receiving an upper-arm fistula or graft at a single large dialysis center.", 
    "236": "Primary fistula failure was observed in 37% of patients on statin therapy versus 38% not on statin therapy. Primary graft failure occurred in 20% of patients on statin therapy versus 14% not on statin therapy. A multiple variable logistic regression analysis including statin use, diabetes, coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, sex, and age found that only sex predicted primary fistula failure and graft failure. After excluding primary failures, cumulative fistula survival was similar for patients with or without statin therapy (hazard ratio [HR] 1.26; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76 to 2.16). Likewise, cumulative graft survival was similar for statin therapy versus no statin therapy (HR 0.88; 95% CI 0.59 to 1.32). Using a multivariable survival analysis model to predict cumulative fistula survival, only age predicted fistula failure (HR 1.21 per decade; 95% CI 1.02 to 1.44). None of the variables in this model predicted cumulative graft survival.", 
    "237": "Statin therapy is not associated with improved fistula or graft outcomes in patients with chronic kidney disease.", 
    "238": "Corticosteroids are an important contributor to posttransplant hyperlipidemia. Since 2004, we have used a steroid minimization immunosuppression protocol. This study investigated the effect of steroid minimization on dyslipidemia in pediatric renal allograft recipients.", 
    "239": "Children (<18 years) who underwent renal transplants at our center from January 2001 to January 2008 were studied. Data analyzed included age, gender, race, body mass index, cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and steroid dose. Data between the cohorts receiving maintenance steroids and steroid-minimization were compared using multivariable analyses. The primary outcome measures were the prevalence of, and the effect of steroid use, on dyslipidemia.", 
    "240": "Twenty-nine patients were studied. Sixteen were receiving maintenance steroids, and 13 were on a steroid minimization regimen. Mixed effects analysis of covariance models demonstrated that at 1 month, children receiving maintenance steroids had higher cholesterol compared with the steroid minimization group. Statistically significant differences in total cholesterol were not seen at other time points. Similar findings were noted for the LDL cholesterol, LDL/HDL, and cholesterol/HDL ratios. At 1 month, the serum HDL cholesterol was substantially lower in the steroid minimization group. Differences in the HDL cholesterol levels remained significant throughout the first year.", 
    "241": "Steroid use is a significant independent risk factor for hypercholesterolemia during the first post-transplant month. The significance of lower HDL cholesterol among patients receiving steroid minimization needs further study and may be cause for concern."
