Rosuvastatin (ROS) is a new 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, with multiple biological effects. In our study, the object was to evaluate the effectiveness of ROS in the prevention of post-operative knee adhesion in rats. MATERIAL AND METHODS Femoral condyle exposing surgery was performed on 45 healthy Sprague Dawley rats. Gelatin sponges soaked with 20 mg/kg of ROS, 10 mg/kg of ROS, or saline were used to cover the surgical site. The post-operative knee joints were fixed in a flexed position with micro Kirschner wires for four weeks. ROS effectiveness for treating intra-articular adhesion was determined with visual score evaluation, hydroxyproline content, histological analyses, immunohistochemistry, and inflammatory and vascular endothelial growth factors expression. RESULTS The animals' recovery was stable after surgery. The hydroxyproline content, visual score, and inflammatory vascular growth factors expression levels suggested that, compared with the control group, the ROS treatment groups showed better outcomes. ROS prevented joint adhesion formation, collagen deposition, and vascularization at the surgical site, and also inhibited inflammatory activity post-operatively. Compared with the 10 mg/kg ROS group, the 20 mg/kg ROS group showed significantly better outcomes. CONCLUSIONS The local application of ROS reduced intra-articular adhesion formation, collagen deposition, and vascularization at the surgical site, and inhibited inflammatory activity post-operatively. These results suggested optimal concentration of ROS to be 20 mg/kg.",

    "6": "Background. Cholesterol lowering drugs HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and PPAR\u03b1 activators (fibrates) have been shown to reduce host inflammation via non-disease specific immunomodulatory mechanisms. Recent studies suggest that commonly prescribed drugs in general practice, statins and fibrates, may be beneficial in influenza-like illness related mortality. This retrospective cohort study examines the association between two lipid lowering drugs, statins and fibrates, and all-cause 30-day mortality following a medically attended acute respiratory illness (MAARI). Methods. Primary care patient data were retrospectively extracted from the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) database. The sample comprised 201,179 adults aged 30 years or older experiencing a MAARI episode. Patient exposure to statins or fibrates was coded as separate dichotomous variables and deemed current if the most recent GP prescription was issued in the 30 days prior to MAARI diagnosis. Multivariable logistic regression and Cox regression were used for analyses. Adjustment was carried out for chronic lung disease, heart failure, metformin and glitazones, comorbidity burden, socio-demographic and lifestyle variables such as smoking status and body mass index (BMI). Statistical interaction tests were carried out to check for effect modification by gender, body mass index, smoking status and comorbidity. Results. A total of 1,096 (5%) patients died within the 30-day follow up period. Of this group, 213 (19.4%) were statin users and 4 (0.4%) were fibrate users. After adjustment, a significant 35% reduction in odds [adj OR; 0.65 (95% CI [0.52-0.80])] and a 33% reduction in the hazard [adj HR: 0.67 (95% CI [0.55-0.83])] of all-cause 30-day mortality following MAARI was observed in statin users. A significant effect modification by comorbidity burden was observed for the association between statin use and MAARI-related mortality. Fibrate use was associated with a non-significant reduction in 30-day MAARI-related mortality. Conclusion. This study suggests that statin use may be associated with a reduction in 30-day mortality following acute respiratory illness that is severe enough to merit medical consultation. Findings from this study support and strengthen similar observational research while providing a strong rationale for a randomised controlled trial investigating the potential role of statins in acute respiratory infections.",

    "8": "Primary prevention of cardiovascular events in older adults is challenging because of a general paucity of evidence for safe and efficacious therapy. Furthermore, there is no validated cardiovascular risk assessment tool for older adults (\u226575 years of age), yet most are intermediate-to high-risk. Assessment of cardiovascular risk should include a discussion of the potential benefits and risks of therapy, and allow for incorporation of the patients' values and preferences, functionality and/or frailty, comorbidities, and concomitant medications (eg, polypharmacy, drug-drug interactions, adherence). The best available evidence for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in older adults is for statin therapy and blood pressure control. Statin therapy reduces the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke, although close monitoring for adverse events is warranted. Evidence does not support an association between statin therapy and either cognitive impairment or cancer. Rates of adverse effects, such as myopathy and diabetes, do not appear to be increased in elderly patients. Blood pressure control is also paramount to prevent cardiovascular events and mortality in elderly patients, although the target is debatable and should be individualized to the patient. Conversely, the benefit of antiplatelet therapy in primary prevention does not appear to outweigh the risk, and should not be recommended. Other interventions shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in elderly patients include smoking cessation, physical activity, and maintaining a normal body weight.", 
    "9": "The objective of this study was to empirically demonstrate the use of a new framework for describing the strategies used to implement quality improvement interventions and provide an example that others may follow. Implementation strategies are the specific approaches, methods, structures, and resources used to introduce and encourage uptake of a given intervention's components. Such strategies have not been regularly reported in descriptions of interventions' effectiveness, or in assessments of how proven interventions are implemented in new settings. This lack of reporting may hinder efforts to successfully translate effective interventions into \"real-world\" practice. A recently published framework was designed to standardize reporting on implementation strategies in the implementation science literature. We applied this framework to describe the strategies used to implement a single intervention in its original commercial care setting, and when implemented in community health centers from September 2010 through May 2015. Per this framework, the target (clinic staff) and outcome (prescribing rates) remained the same across settings; the actor, action, temporality, and dose were adapted to fit local context. The framework proved helpful in articulating which of the implementation strategies were kept constant and which were tailored to fit diverse settings, and simplified our reporting of their effects. Researchers should consider consistently reporting this information, which could be crucial to the success or failure of implementing proven interventions effectively across diverse care settings.",

On the 30th day of treatment, groups were randomized and DZP was administered (0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection). Control groups received saline. Results showed that DZP enhanced TBARS levels and protein carbonyl content and altered enzymatic activity in the brain of rats. Simvastatin prevented most of the alterations caused by DZP on the oxidative stress parameters.

However, the association was not consistent across the various cohorts of participants in different countries; while it was very clear in US and Northern European cohorts, it was weak in Southern European and Japanese cohorts. Nevertheless, the study triggered research into cholesterol-lowering drug strategies, ultimately leading to the development of statins amongst others. Clinical evidence in support of statins is strong and the vast majority of the medical community advocate these drugs as highly effective first-line therapeutics in primary and secondary prevention of CVD. However, growing evidence of side-effects associated with statins in a significant proportion of patients suggests that these drugs are not a universal solution to CVD. There is a need, therefore, to revisit the evidence and to re-appraise the relative importance of cholesterol amongst many other lipids as potential modulators of atherogenesis. In this review, we assess the relative merits of statin therapy in CVD versus dietary interventions that impact on lipids other than cholesterol, including omega-3 fatty acids and polar lipid fractions of various foods (e.g. fish and olive oil). We conclude that careful design around the lipid components of dietary interventions presents a credible alternative in patients who are intolerant to statins or averse to taking such drugs.",

The paper summarizes recent studies on substances from edible plants (e.g., cereals and apples) or their synthetic analogues, such as peptide lunasin, as well as substances isolated from inedible plants (e.g., birch and conifer), such as pentacyclic triterpenes (e.g., betulin, betulinic acid, and lupeol) and polyprenols. Latvian researchers have been first to demonstrate the presence of lunasin in triticale and oats. Additionally, the impact of genotype on the levels of lunasin in cereals was shown. Pharmacological studies have revealed effects of lunasin and synthetic triterpenes on the central nervous system in rodents. We were first to show that synthetic lunasin causes a marked neuroleptic/cataleptic effect and that betulin antagonizes bicuculline-induced seizures (a GABA A receptor antagonist). Studies on the mechanisms of action showed that lunasin binds to dopamine D1 receptors and betulin binds to melanocortin and gamma-aminobutyric acid A receptors therefore we suggest that these receptors play an essential role in lunasin's and betulin's central effects. Recent studies on conifer polyprenols demonstrated the ability of polyprenols to prevent statin-induced muscle weakness in a rat model. Another study on plant compounds has demonstrated the anti-hyperglycemic activity of phlorizin-containing unripe apple pomace in healthy volunteers. In summary, research into plant-derived compounds in Latvia has been focused on fractionating, isolating and characterizing of lunasin, triterpenes, polyprenols and phlorizin using in vitro, and in vivo assays, and human observational studies.",

In contrast, the 3D metric thin cap (<80\u2009\u03bcm) surface area change between the baseline and the 12-month follow-up showed dose-dependent, significant differences between the statin treatment groups (P<0.001). 3D reconstructions of fibrous caps further indicated that fibrous caps showed diverse (scattered vs. confluent) patterns and could evolve in a complex manner.",

    "49": "Besides its potent plasma cholesterol-lowering activity, statin treatment has several other important effects, including lowering high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), levels, and stabilizing risk factors of atherosclerosis, thereby reducing the risk of cardiovascular events. Our aim in this study was to identify how intensive statin therapy can affect plasma levels of inflammatory markers over the long term.", 
    "50": "We used a prospective, randomized, open blinded-endpoint design. A total of 30 patients with stable coronary artery disease treated with everolimus-eluting stent implantation were randomized to receive rosuvastatin 2.5 (standard therapy group) or 10\u2009mg (intensive therapy group) for 12 months. Plasma levels of hs-CRP, pentraxin-3, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and CXC chemokine ligand 4 were measured after a percutaneous coronary intervention, at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Levels of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) and HDL cholesterol were also measured. We investigated short-term and long-term clinical outcomes. After 12 months of therapy, the intensive therapy group had lower levels of LDL-C than the standard therapy group. Plasma levels of hs-CRP largely fluctuated in the standard therapy group, whereas they were stable in the intensive therapy group during the follow-up period. There were no significant differences in serum pentraxin-3, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and CXC chemokine ligand 4 levels, or in the incidence of any clinical adverse events, between the standard and the intensive therapy groups.", 
    "51": "Intensive rosuvastatin therapy stabilizes hs-CRP levels, but not chemokine levels, besides lowering LDL-C levels. Thus, this therapy may inhibit the progression of atherosclerosis by stably inhibiting the inflammatory cascade.", 
    "52": "The anticoagulant drug warfarin and the lipid-lowering statin drugs are commonly co-administered to patients with cardiovascular diseases. Clinically significant drug-drug interactions (DDIs) between these drugs have been recognized through case studies for many years, but the biochemical mechanisms causing these interactions have not been explained fully. Previous theories include kinetic alterations in cytochrome P-450-mediated drug metabolism or disturbances of drug-protein binding, leading to anticoagulant activity of warfarin; however, neither the enantioselective effects on warfarin metabolism nor the potential disruption of drug transporter function have been well investigated. This study investigated the etiology of the DDIs between warfarin and statins. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry methods were developed and validated to quantify racemic warfarin, 6 of its hydroxylated metabolites, and pure enantiomers of warfarin; these methods were applied to study the role of different absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion properties, leading to DDIs. Plasma protein binding displacement of warfarin was performed in the presence of statins using equilibrium dialysis method. Substrate kinetics of warfarin and pure enantiomers were performed with human liver microsomes to determine the kinetic parameters (Km and Vmax) for the formation of all 6 hydroxywarfarin metabolites, inhibition of warfarin metabolism in the presence of statins, was determined. Uptake transport studies of warfarin were performed using overexpressing HEK cell lines and efflux transport using human adenocarcinoma colonic cell line cells. Fluvastatin significantly displaced plasma protein binding of warfarin and pure enantiomers; no other statin resulted in significant displacement of warfarin. All the statins that inhibited the formation of 10-hydroxywarfarin, atorvastatin, pitavastatin, and simvastatin were highly potent compared to other statins; in contrast, only fluvastatin was found to be a potent inhibitor of formation of 7-hydroxy warfarin. Uptake and efflux drug transporters do not play any role in these DDIs. The results showed that DDIs between warfarin and statins are primarily caused by cytochrome P-450 inhibition.", 
    "53": "Coronary calcification (CAC) is highly prevalent in kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) and has been associated with cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Some studies have shown a reduction in CAC progression with statin therapy in the general and chronic kidney disease (CKD) populations.", 
    "54": "The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of statins on CAC progression in incident kidney transplant recipients. Patients were randomly assigned to the statin (n = 61, 10 mg daily) and control group (n = 59). CAC and biochemical analyses were performed at baseline and 12 months.", 
    "55": "At baseline, CAC was observed in 30% and 21% of patients in the statin and control groups, respectively (p = 0.39). The calcium score at baseline and its absolute and relative changes over 12 months of follow up were similar among the groups. In the statin group, total cholesterol (p < 0.001), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (p < 0.001) and triglycerides (p = 0.005) decreased, and the estimated glomerular function rate increased (p<0.001) significantly. CRP levels remained stable (p = 0.52) in the statin group but increased in the control group (p = 0.01). In the multivariate model, there was no difference in CAC progression between the groups (group effect p = 0.034; time-effect p = 0.23; interaction p = 0.74). Similar results were obtained when only patients with \u2265 10AU calcium score (calcified) were analyzed (group effect p = 0.051; time-effect p = 0.58; interaction p = 0.99).",

    "58": "The review is dedicated to studying the effect of perioperative use of statins while performing vascular operations, examining possible aftermaths of statins discontinuation in the perioperative period and discussing safety of perioperative use of statins. Cardiovascular complications constitute the most common cause of perioperative mortality while performing major noncardiac operations. Clinical studies demonstrated a favourable effect of statins on the cardiovascular complications rate in the perioperative period, therefore use of statins for prevention of cardiovascular diseases seems substantiated appropriate. Acting upon the levels of blood serum lipids, statins also influence various signal cellular pathways, exerting anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic and vasodilating effects. Thus, they may be used not only for patients with lipid metabolism impairments. However, currently required are further studies in order to determine optimal dosage, as well as the terms and duration of therapy with statins in the perioperative period.",

The prevalence of LDL-C \u2265 5 mmol/L is 3.8% in Polish population aged 18-79 years. Among these adults there are patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH). According to meta-analysis of 6 Polish population surveys prevalence of heterozygous FH (HeFH) diagnosed using Dutch Lipid Clinic criteria is 0.4% (95% Cl 0.28-0.53%) in men and women aged 20-74 years, i.e. one in every 250 people. As HeFH is a wellknown cause of premature coronary heart disease the rigorous treatment targets for LDL-C have been established in clinical guidelines. Their achievements, even with a high dose of high efficacy statin therapy is difficult or even impossible. New strong hypolipidaemic drugs i.e. PCSK9 inhibitors have been initiated against this chalange. Both drugs, evolocumab and alirocumab, have been extensively studied in numerous phase 2 and phase 3 trials. Fewer studies with bococizumab are available until now. The PCSK9 inhibitors, as monotherapy as well in combination with statins were associated with mean LDL-C reduction about 60%. It means that the majority of patients (70-90%) with severe hypercholesterolaemia (including HeFH), treated with statins, after addition of PCSK9 inhibitors were able to achieve an LDL-C < 2.5 mmol/L (< 100 mg/dL) or < 1.8 mmol/L (< 70 mg/dL) level. Another group of patients who may benefit from PCSK9 inhibitors include those who need lipid lowering therapy, but who are statin intolerant, especially because of statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS).

    "77": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major complication of metabolic disorders such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, and hypertension. Comorbidity of these diseases is the factor exacerbating CKD progression. Statins are commonly used in patients with metabolic disorders to decrease the risk of cardiovascular complications. Sarpogrelate, a selective antagonist of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) 2A receptor, inhibits platelet aggregation and is used to improve peripheral circulation in diabetic patients. Here, we investigated the effects of sarpogrelate and rosuvastatin on CKD in mice that were subjected to a high fat diet (HFD) for 22 weeks and a single low dose of streptozotocin (STZ, 40 mg/kg). When mice were administrated sarpogrelate (50 mg/kg, p.o.) for 13 weeks, albuminuria and urinary cystatin C excretion were normalized and histopathological changes such as glomerular mesangial expansion, tubular damage, and accumulations in lipid droplets and collagen were significantly improved. Sarpogrelate treatment repressed the HFD/STZ-induced CD31 and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 expressions, indicating the attenuation of glomerular endothelial proliferation. Additionally, sarpogrelate inhibited interstitial fibrosis by suppressing the increases in transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). All of these functional and histological improvements were also seen in rosuvastatin (20 mg/kg) group and, notably, the combinatorial treatment with sarpogrelate and rosuvastatin showed additive beneficial effects on histopathological changes by HFD/STZ. Moreover, sarpogrelate reduced circulating levels of PAI-1 that were elevated in the HFD/STZ group. As supportive in vitro evidence, sarpogrelate incubation blocked TGF-\u03b21/5-HT-inducible PAI-1 expression in murine glomerular mesangial cells. Taken together, sarpogrelate and rosuvastatin may be advantageous to control the progression of CKD in patients with comorbid metabolic disorders, and particularly, the use of sarpogrelate as adjunctive therapy with statins may provide additional benefits on CKD.",

Over the last decade, inhibition of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy to reduce residual cardiovascular disease risk. Binding of PCSK9 to the LDL receptor targets the receptor for lysosomal degradation. The recognition that inhibition of PCSK9 increases LDL receptor activity has led to the development of a number of approaches to directly target PCSK9. Numerous monoclonal antibodies against PCSK9 are currently being evaluated in phase 3 trials, involving various patient categories on different background lipid-lowering therapies. Current evidence shows reductions in LDL-C levels of up to 70\u00a0% may be achieved with PCSK9 inhibition, independent of background statin therapy.

Methods Platelet reactivity, in platelet reaction units (PRUs), was measured at baseline and after 28 days with VerifyNow, which uses arachidonic acid to determine thromboxane-mediated platelet aggregation, in 50 consecutive patients included in our study (25 receiving rosuvastatin and 25 without intervention). Results Forty-seven of 50 (94.0%) consecutively enrolled patients had two valid PRU measurements. The mean PRUs in rosuvastatin users were 609 at baseline and 613 at the end of the study (mean change 5; 95% confidence interval [CI] - 18 to 27). The mean PRUs in non-users were 620 at baseline and 618 at the end of the study (mean change - 2; 95% CI - 15 to 12). The mean difference in PRU change between users and non-users was 6 (95% CI - 20 to 33).

    "123": "The macrophage and its related cholesterol efflux are considered to be a key player in atherosclerotic formation in relation to the function of high-density lipoprotein (HDL). The HDL function can be evaluated by the reaction between lipid-loaded macrophages and lipid-acceptors in the HDL fraction from the plasma, apolipoprotein B-depleted serum, and/or whole serum/plasma. Recent studies have reported that an impaired cholesterol efflux of HDL is observed in patients with cardiometabolic diseases, such as dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and chronic kidney disease. A population-based cohort study has reported an inverse association between the cholesterol efflux capacity of HDL and the incidence of atherosclerotic disease, regardless of the serum HDL-cholesterol level. Moreover, in this paper, when we summarized several clinical interventional studies of statin treatment that examined cholesterol efflux, a potential increase in the efflux in patients treated with statins was implied. However, the effect was not fully defined in the current situation because of the small sample sizes, lack of a unified protocol for measuring the efflux, and short-term intervention periods without cardiovascular outcomes in available studies. Further investigation is necessary to determine the effect of drugs on cholesterol efflux. With additional advanced studies, cholesterol efflux is a promising laboratory index to understand the HDL function.",

This is largely believde to be a result of ifosfamide-induced oxidative stress. In this study, we investigated the antioxidant activity of simvastatin and the possible protective role of simvastatin against ifosfamide induced nephrotoxicity. Thirty Sprague-Dawely rats were divided into five groups and given orally different drug combinations. Group I and II were regarded as control groups and received 0.1% DMSO and normal saline, respectively. Group III received ifosfamide at 50 mg/kg, group IV received simvastatin at 0.3 mg/kg and group V received both ifosfamide and simvastatin. All animals were decapitated 2 days after the last ifosfamide administration. Findings revealed that ifosfamide induced nephrotoxicity as indicated by a significant increase in plasma creatinine and lipid per oxidation. This increase was significantly inhibited in animals pretreated with simvastatin. Histopathological observations were in correlation with the biochemical parameters in that simvastatin minimized ifosfamide-induced renal tubular damage. The above results promote a future use of simvastatin in combination with ifosfamide in treatment of cancer patients to indicate that simvastatin protectics against ifosfamide-induced nephrotoxicity in terms of oxidative stress and might be given in combination.",

These fully human monoclonal antibodies selectively block PCSK9, thus permitting the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor to effectively recycle to the surface of liver cells. The administration of these antibodies leads to robust LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering by 50-60% on top of maximum hypolipidemic treatment. At least 4 randomized, placebo-controlled studies are under way and will address the question of whether the administration of these PCSK9 inhibitors is associated with a significant reduction of cardiovascular events. Because of the high cost associated with the use of these medications it is very important to consider which patients may gain the most benefit, at least until the results of outcome studies are available.

In the present study, we investigated the expression profile and the biological functions of HMGCR in gastric cancer. It was found that the expression of HMGCR was increased in gastric cancer tissues. Over-expression of HMGCR promoted the growth and migration of gastric cancer cells, while knocking down the expression of HMGCR inhibited the growth, migration and tumorigenesis of gastric cancer cells. In the further molecular mechanism study, HMGCR was shown to activate Hedgehog/Gli1 signaling and promoted the expression of Gli1 target genes.

    "142": "Statins have been shown to promote neuroprotection in a wide range of neurological disorders. However, the mechanisms involved in such effects of statins are not fully understood. Quinolinic acid (QA) is a neurotoxin that induces seizures when infused in vivo and promotes glutamatergic excitotoxicity in the central nervous system. The aim of this study was to evaluate the putative glutamatergic mechanisms and the intracellular signaling pathways involved in the atorvastatin neuroprotective effects against QA toxicity. Atorvastatin (10\u00a0mg/kg) treatment for 7\u00a0days prevented the QA-induced decrease in glutamate uptake, but had no effect on increased glutamate release induced by QA. Moreover, atorvastatin treatment increased the phosphorylation of ERK1 and prevented the decrease in Akt phosphorylation induced by QA. Neither atorvastatin treatment nor QA infusion altered glutamine synthetase activity or the levels of phosphorylation of p38(MAPK) or JNK1/2 during the evaluation. Inhibition of MEK/ERK signaling pathway, but not PI3K/Akt signaling, abolished the neuroprotective effect of atorvastatin against QA-induced decrease in glutamate uptake. Our data suggest that atorvastatin protective effects against QA toxicity are related to modulation of glutamate transporters via MAPK/ERK signaling pathway.", 
    "143": "Disturbances in acid-base balance, such as acidosis and alkalosis, have potential to alter the pharmacologic and toxicologic outcomes of statin therapy. Statins are commonly prescribed for elderly patients who have multiple comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular, and renal diseases. These patients are at risk of developing acid-base imbalance. In the present study, the effect of disturbances in acid-base balance on the interconversion of simvastatin and pravastatin between lactone and hydroxy acid forms have been investigated in physiological buffers, human plasma, and cell culture medium over pH ranging from 6.8-7.8. The effects of such interconversion on cellular uptake and myotoxicity of statins were assessed in\u00a0vitro using C2C12 skeletal muscle cells under conditions relevant to acidosis, alkalosis, and physiological pH. Results indicate that the conversion of the lactone forms of simvastatin and pravastatin to the corresponding hydroxy acid is strongly pH dependent. At physiological and alkaline pH, substantial proportions of simvastatin lactone (SVL; \u223c87% and 99%, respectively) and pravastatin lactone (PVL; \u223c98% and 99%, respectively) were converted to the active hydroxy acid forms after 24\u00a0hours of incubation at 37\u00b0C. At acidic pH, conversion occurs to a lower extent, resulting in greater proportion of statin remaining in the more lipophilic lactone form. However, pH alteration did not influence the conversion of the hydroxy acid forms of simvastatin and pravastatin to the corresponding lactones. Furthermore, acidosis has been shown to hinder the metabolism of the lactone form of statins by inhibiting hepatic microsomal enzyme activities. Lipophilic SVL was found to be more cytotoxic to undifferentiated and differentiated skeletal muscle cells compared with more hydrophilic simvastatin hydroxy acid, PVL, and pravastatin hydroxy acid. Enhanced cytotoxicity of statins was observed under acidic conditions and is attributed to increased cellular uptake of the more lipophilic lactone or unionized hydroxy acid form. Consequently, our results suggest that comorbidities associated with acid-base imbalance can play a substantial role in the development and potentiation of statin-induced myotoxicity.",

    "167": "Lipid guidelines from National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III, American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, American Diabetes Association and American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology were reviewed. In addition a literature review was performed using PubMed to research diabetic peculiarities to the topic of lipids.",

    "170": "In numerous clinical trials, lowering LDL-C with statin therapy has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in primary and secondary prevention settings. Guidelines recommend statins for first-line therapy in cholesterol-lowering management of patients with CVD risk. Despite increased statin monotherapy use over the last decade, a number of patients with high CVD risk do not achieve optimal LDL-C lowering. Guidelines recommend consideration of statin combination therapy with nonstatin agents for these patients. However, combination therapy approaches have been hampered by neutral findings. Recently, ezetimibe added to simvastatin therapy reduced cardiovascular events in acute coronary syndrome patients, more than simvastatin alone. This article provides an overview of various agents in combination with statin therapy on cardiovascular outcomes. Other lipid-lowering agents in development, including PCSK9 and CETP inhibitors in development, are also described.", 
    "171": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is currently the leading cause of mortality among individuals living with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI). The purpose of this study is to: 1) Describe the prevalence of CVD risk factors including dyslipidemia (DYS), hypertension (HTN) and type II diabetes mellitus (DM) in patients with chronic SCI; 2) Report the frequency of individuals recommended for diagnostic testing, as per current Canadian CVD diagnostic guidelines; and 3) Report the frequency of individuals receiving guideline-derived appropriate therapy for these risk factors.", 
    "172": "Adults with a chronic, stable SCI (n\u2009=\u200991) were included in this study. Medical histories, current medications, blood serum analyses and blood pressures were collected and compared to current Canadian CVD diagnostic guidelines to assess for DYS, HTN and DM.", 
    "173": "Of the 81 participants with blood serum analyses, 10 (14.7%) of 23 (28.4%) individuals meeting diagnostic criteria for DYS were not taking appropriate statin medication and 2 (2.5%) of 7 (8.6%) individuals meeting diagnostic criteria for DM were not taking appropriate DM medication. Of the 91 participants having BP measurements, 13 (14.3%) of 26 (28.6%) individuals meeting diagnostic criteria for HTN were not taking appropriate BP medication.", 
    "174": "In addition to a high prevalence of CVD risk factors among individuals with chronic SCI, there is also evidence of poor adherence to diagnostic and treatment guidelines for DYS, HTN and DM. The study results highlight an important gap between the observed prevalence of disease and the low rates of screening and guideline adherence in the SCI population.", 
    "175": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) remains the leading cause of blindness in developed countries, and affects more than 150 million worldwide. Despite effective anti-angiogenic therapies for the less prevalent neovascular form of AMD, treatments are lacking for the more prevalent dry form. Similarities in risk factors and pathogenesis between AMD and atherosclerosis have led investigators to study the effects of statins on AMD incidence and progression with mixed results. A limitation of these studies has been the heterogeneity of AMD disease and the lack of standardization in statin dosage.",

Patients received 80 mg of atorvastatin daily and were monitored at baseline and every 3 months with complete ophthalmologic exam, best corrected visual acuity (VA), fundus photographs, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and blood work (AST, ALT, CPK, total cholesterol, TSH, creatinine, as well as a pregnancy test for premenopausal women).", 
    "178": "Twenty-three subjects completed a minimum follow-up of 12 months. High-dose atorvastatin resulted in regression of drusen deposits associated with vision gain (+ 3.3 letters, p = 0.06) in 10 patients. No subjects progressed to advanced neovascular AMD.", 
    "179": "High-dose statins may result in resolution of drusenoid pigment epithelial detachments (PEDs) and improvement in VA, without atrophy or neovascularization in a high-risk subgroup of AMD patients. Confirmation from larger studies is warranted.", 
    "180": "Despite attaining LDL-cholesterol targets, many patients with diabetes remain at risk of developing cardiovascular events. In addition, treatment with statins has been associated with a slight but significant increased risk of development of diabetes, particularly with high-intensity statins. Pitavastatin is a moderate- to high-intensity statin that effectively reduces LDL-cholesterol levels. Pitavastatin provides a sustained increase of HDL-cholesterol levels that may exhibit a neutral or positive effect on glucose metabolism, may not increase the risk of new-onset diabetes, may exhibit positive effects on renal function and urinary albumin excretion and the risk of drug-drug interactions is low. Therefore, it seems that pitavastatin should preferentially be considered in the treatment of dyslipidemia in diabetic patients or at risk of developing diabetes.",

    "182": "The cohort study comprised 212 consecutive patients, already taking statins, who underwent elective first-time CABG with cardiopulmonary bypass without history of atrial fibrillation (AF). Patients were randomly divided into two groups: those who received atorvastatin 40\u00a0mg (TOR40 group, 111 patients) and those who received 80\u00a0mg (TOR80 group, 101 patients) once a day for 7\u00a0days before the planned operation. The primary endpoint was the incidence of AF. The secondary endpoints were the postoperative variations of inflammatory markers, hospital length of stay, and the incidence of major adverse cardiac and clinical events.",

Median values of interleukin-6 and hsCRP at 12 and 24\u00a0h did not have differences between the two groups. No statistically significant differences in the other secondary endpoints were detected.", 
    "184": "According to our result, 7-day preoperative treatment with a high dose of atorvastatin is associated with a trend to a decrease in the incidence of POAF compared with treatment at a lower dose, although it does not impact on the level of inflammatory markers.",

Overall, there was a plausible temporal association of events in most cases. In addition, the EudraVigilance database contained 165 reports of muscle rupture reported in patients using statins. Muscle rupture was disproportionally associated with statin use in both databases. The reporting odds ratio was 23.4 (95% CI 11.9, 46.0) and 14.6 (95% CI 12.3, 17.2), respectively.",

PWCA has been associated with autoimmune, drug-induced, and viral exposures. Here, we report a case of a 74-year-old female who presented with severe proximal weakness without pain and was found to have PWCA with nonspecific inflammatory necrotizing myositis and acute liver injury on biopsies. These findings were associated with a recent course of azithromycin and her daily use of a statin. Myositis improved on prednisone but PWCA persisted. With intravenous immunoglobulin and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor therapies, her symptoms and neutrophil counts improved and were sustained for months.", 
    "191": "Numerous genetic contributors to cardiovascular disease risk have been identified through genome-wide association studies; however, identifying the molecular mechanism underlying these associations is not straightforward. The Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) trial of rosuvastatin users identified a sub-genome-wide association of rs6924995, a single-nucleotide polymorphism \u224810 kb downstream of myosin regulatory light chain interacting protein (MYLIP, aka IDOL and inducible degrader of low-density lipoprotein receptor [LDLR]), with LDL cholesterol statin response. Interestingly, although this signal was initially attributed to MYLIP, rs6924995 lies within RP1-13D10.2, an uncharacterized long noncoding RNA.", 
    "192": "Using simvastatin and sham incubated lymphoblastoid cell lines from participants of the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics (CAP) simvastatin clinical trial, we found that statin-induced change in RP1-13D10.2 levels differed between cell lines from the tails of the white and black low-density lipoprotein cholesterol response distributions, whereas no difference in MYLIP was observed. RP1-13D10.2 overexpression in Huh7 and HepG2 increased LDLR transcript levels, increased LDL uptake, and decreased media levels of apolipoprotein B. In addition, we found a trend of slight differences in the effects of RP1-13D10.2 overexpression on LDLR transcript levels between hepatoma cells transfected with the rs6924995 A versus G allele and a suggestion of an association between rs6924995 and RP1-10D13.2 expression levels in the CAP lymphoblastoid cell lines. Finally, RP1-13D10.2 expression levels seem to be sterol regulated, consistent with its potential role as a novel lipid regulator.", 
    "193": "RP1-13D10.2 is a long noncoding RNA that regulates LDLR and may contribute to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol response to statin treatment. These findings highlight the potential role of noncoding RNAs as determinants of interindividual variation in drug response.",

    "195": "Experimental animals were divided into five groups: the group I (the control group of rats fed with standard diet during 11 weeks), and the remaining 4 groups of rats (II, III, IV and V) fed with standard diet during the first week and then with hypercholesterolemic diet during the next 10 weeks. The group II of rats were left without treatment, while in the groups III, IV and V were rats treated per os with atorvastatin (1.15 mg/kg body weight--b.w.), ALTINC (0.1 mL/kg b.w.) and their combination in same doses, respectively, for the last six weeks.", 
    "196": "The cholesterol rich diet led to pronounced hyperlipidemia which could not be overcame with the therapy. However, the therapy showed positive effects on abdominal aorta wall thickness and parameters of oxidative stress (malondialdehyde--MDA, proxidative-antioxidative balance--PAB) and antioxidative protection (reduced glutathione--GSH, paraoxanase 1--PON1, superoxide dismutase--SODA SH groups), especially ALTINC was successful in oxidative status improvement.", 
    "197": "Separate treatments comparison showed that artichoke leaf tincture is very potent antioxidant with beneficial effects in early stages of atherosclerosis. Since atorvastatin and constituents of ALTINC probably have different mechanisms of action, simultaneous use of both therapies could be beneficial but should be further investigated since our results showed that ALTINC is less effective when used in combination with atorvastatin.",

    "199": "An UPLC-MS/MS method was developed and validated for the pharmacokinetics tudy of lovastatin to investigate the in vivo drug-drug interactions between lovastatin and berberine. SD male rats were random divided into lovastatin group and berberine induced prior to lovastatin group for the in vivo pharmacokinetic studies. Meanwhile HepG2 cells were induced by berberine for three days to study the metabolism of lovastatin.", 
    "200": "The AUC (p < 0.01) and Cmax (p < 0.01) could be significantly decreased in the berberine-induced group in vivo, and the metabolic activity of HepG2 cell ccould be increased by berberine induction in vitro. The metabolism parameters of lovastatin such as CL, Vmax and Km were increased after the induction of berberine. From the pharmacokinetic study of lovastatin induced with berberine, we obtained pharmacokinetic parameters which are compliance with the metabolic parameters of lovastatin in HepG2 cells with berberine induction in vitro.", 
    "201": "From the in vivo pharmacokinetics study and the HepG2 cell metabolism study in vitro, berberine could be an inducer for the metabolism of lovastatin according to our previous research on berberine induction effects on HepG2 cells, which may be relevant to the fact that berberine possesses induction effects through the CYP 450 3A4 enzyme.", 
    "202": "Managing dyslipidemia can be challenging in patients with statin intolerance. We describe the lipid effects of icosapent ethyl 4 g/day (high-purity prescription omega-3 eicosapentaenoic acid) in two coronary artery disease patients with statin intolerance who were self-treating with fish oil dietary supplements. After initiating icosapent ethyl, improvements were noted in the first and second patients, respectively, in total cholesterol (-12%; -21%), LDL cholesterol (-3%; -24%), triglycerides (-34%; -16%), non-HDL cholesterol (-12%; -22%), the omega-3 index (+42%; +8%) and eicosapentaenoic acid levels (+275%; +138%). Icosapent ethyl was well tolerated with no adverse events reported. These cases demonstrated favorable lipid effects with prescription icosapent ethyl treatment that may help optimize the care of high-risk coronary artery disease patients with statin intolerance.",

    "204": "A total of 404 patients with STEMI were reviewed. Demographics, comorbidities, laboratory values, and outcomes were collected. The patients were grouped as STATIN and NOSTAT based on the use of statin drugs at the time of admission. Ninety-seven patients were receiving statin drugs.", 
    "205": "The patients in the STATIN group were more likely to be hypertensive (53.6%), diabetic (37.1%) and to have previous coronary revascularization (9.3%). Following propensity matching of 89 patients in STATIN group to an equal number of patients in NOSTAT controls had lower neutrophil count 7.8 (6.8-8.4) compared to those in the NOSTAT group 9.1 (7.9-10.1). Although there was no difference in-hospital mortality between the two groups, the incidence of pump failure was lower in the STATIN group (5.6% vs. 15.7%; P < 0.01).", 
    "206": "Statin treatment prior to STEMI mitigates the cellular inflammatory response after the myocardial infarction, as evidenced by lower leukocyte and neutrophil cell counts in the STATIN group.", 
    "207": "G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signalling, including that involving apelin (APLN) and its receptor APLNR, is known to be important in vascular development. How this ligand-receptor pair regulates the downstream signalling cascades in this context remains poorly understood. Here, we show that mice with Apln, Aplnr or endothelial-specific Aplnr deletion develop profound retinal vascular defects, which are at least in part due to dysregulated increase in endothelial CXCR4 expression. Endothelial CXCR4 is negatively regulated by miR-139-5p, whose transcription is in turn induced by laminar flow and APLN/APLNR signalling. Inhibition of miR-139-5p in vivo partially phenocopies the retinal vascular defects of APLN/APLNR deficiency. Pharmacological inhibition of CXCR4 signalling or augmentation of the miR-139-5p-CXCR4 axis can ameliorate the vascular phenotype of APLN/APLNR deficient state. Overall, we identify an important microRNA-mediated GPCR crosstalk, which plays a key role in vascular development.", 
    "208": "Severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI) is a serious public health issue with high morbidity and mortality rates. Previous proteomic studies on sTBI have mainly focused on human cerebrospinal fluid and serum, as well as on brain protein changes in murine models. However, human proteomic data in sTBI brain is still scarce. We used proteomic and bioinformatic strategies to investigate variations in protein expression levels in human brains after sTBI, using samples from the Department of Neurosurgery, Affiliated Hospital of Hebei University (Hebei, China). Our proteomic data identified 4031 proteins, of which 160 proteins were overexpressed and 5 proteins were downregulated. Bioinformatics analysis showed significant changes in biological pathways including glial cell differentiation, complement activation and apolipoprotein catalysis in the statin pathway. Western blot verification of protein changes in a subset of the available tissue samples showed results that were consistent with the proteomic data. This study is one of the first to investigate the whole proteome of human sTBI brains, and provide a characteristic signature and overall landscape of the sTBI brain proteome.", 
    "209": "To determine the clinical effectiveness of statins on cardiovascular mortality in practice, observational studies are needed. Control for confounding is essential in any observational study. Falsification end-points may be useful to determine if bias is present after adjustment has taken place.", 
    "210": "We followed starters on statin therapy in the Netherlands aged 46 to 100\u00a0years over the period 1996 to 2012, from initiation of statin therapy until cardiovascular mortality or censoring. Within this group (n\u2009=\u200949,688, up to 16\u00a0years of follow-up), we estimated the effect of adherence to statin therapy (0\u2009=\u2009completely non-adherent, 1\u2009=\u2009fully adherent) on ischemic heart diseases and cerebrovascular disease (ICD10-codes I20-I25 and I60-I69) as well as respiratory and endocrine disease mortality (ICD10-codes J00-J99 and E00-E90) as falsification end points, controlling for demographic factors, socio-economic factors, birth cohort, adherence to other cardiovascular medications, and diabetes using time-varying Cox regression models.", 
    "211": "Falsification end-points indicated that a simpler model was less biased than a model with more controls. Adherence to statins appeared to be protective against cardiovascular mortality (HR: 0.70, 95 % CI 0.61 to 0.81).", 
    "212": "Falsification end-points helped detect overadjustment bias or bias due to competing risks, and thereby proved to be a useful technique in such a complex setting.", 
    "213": "Significant regional variation in surgical rates has been identified following multiple surgical procedures. However, limited data have examined the regional variability in patient selection and treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAAs). This study aimed to evaluate regional variation in patient selection, perioperative management, and operative approach for the repair of AAAs.", 
    "214": "All patients undergoing open repair or endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) of an AAA in the Vascular Quality Initiative from 2009 to 2014 were identified. All regional groups were deidentified, and those with fewer than 100 open repairs were combined into a single region.", 
    "215": "We identified 17,269 elective repairs (EVAR, 13,759; open, 3510) and 1462 ruptured AAAs (EVAR, 749; open, 713). There was significant regional variation in the use of EVAR for elective repair (range, 66%-88%; P\u00a0< .01) and\u00a0ruptured AAA repair (40%-80%; P\u00a0< .01). The median diameter for elective repair was similar among regions (EVAR,\u00a05.4\u00a0cm; open, 5.7\u00a0cm). There was wide variation in the treatment of small aneurysms in male patients (<5.5\u00a0cm) for EVAR (34%-49%; P\u00a0< .01) and open repair (17%-38%; P\u00a0< .01) and variation in the treatment of small aneurysms in female patients (<5\u00a0cm) for EVAR (14%-32%; P\u00a0< .01) but not significant for open repair (6%-24%). For elective cases, preoperative aspirin (EVAR, 50%-75% [P\u00a0< .01]; open, 49%-78% [P\u00a0< .01]) and statin use (EVAR, 61%-75% [P\u00a0< .01]; open, 56%-80% [P\u00a0< .01]) varied widely. Among elective cardiac patients, preoperative management varied significantly, including beta-blocker use (EVAR, 66%-78% [P\u00a0< .01]; open, 69%-88% [P\u00a0= .01]) and the frequency of stress tests (EVAR, 33%-64% [P\u00a0< .01]; open, 31%-73% [P\u00a0< .01]). Among open repairs for aneurysms extending at or beyond the juxtarenal segment, there was wide variation in the use of retroperitoneal exposures (7%-70%; P\u00a0< .01) and adjunctive renal protective measures (cold renal perfusion, 2%-43% [P\u00a0< .01]; mannitol, 47%-92% [P\u00a0< .01]).", 
    "216": "Significant regional variation exists in patient selection, perioperative management, and operative approach for the repair of AAA. Definitive evidence is lacking in many aspects of operative care, including the use of the retroperitoneal approach and renal protective strategies. However, this variation emphasizes the importance of research to determine best practice in the areas of greatest variation. Furthermore, where current clinical process measures exist and data are clear, such as the use of statin and antiplatelet agents, the high degree of variation should serve as an impetus for regional quality improvement projects."
