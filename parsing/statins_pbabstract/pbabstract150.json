However, statin use or a lower total cholesterol has been associated with an increased cancer risk, although some deny such an association. Whether a positive statin-cancer association exists or not remains a matter of debate because such a causal association, if any, may offset anticipated cardioprotective benefits from statins. So far, no statin-cancer association in gastric cancer has been systematically highlighted in the literature.",

    "4": "Severe aortic stenosis due to calcification of the aortic valve is the most common indication for aortic valve replacement in the United States and Europe. The standard therapy for symptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis is replacement of the valve. Some of the risk factors and pathophysiologic mechanisms in atherosclerosis play an important role in the development of calcific aortic stenosis. In the last few years, there have been an increased number of publications regarding the use of medications in order to delay the progression of aortic stenosis. These medications include statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and biphosphanates. This article describes and summarizes some of the medical approaches that have emerged to alter the progression of aortic stenosis. Currently, only statins have been evaluated in randomized, placebo-control trials. Furthermore, statins have not proven to alter the progression of aortic stenosis. Ongoing randomized controlled trials with the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, statins, and biphosphonates will determine the use of these medications to delay the progression of aortic stenosis.",

Herbal drugs are increasingly being used in the treatment of cardiovascular disorders. The present study was designed to examine the protective effect of Terminalia arjuna (T arjuna) bark extract on LV and baroreflex function in CHF and to elucidate the possible mechanistic clues in its cardioprotective action. The baroreflex was evaluated by measuring the changes in heart rate (HR) with changes in arterial blood pressure induced by bolus injections of phenylephrine (vasoconstrictor) and sodium nitroprusside (vasodilator). T arjuna bark extract and fluvastatin were tested/administered therapeutically and prophylactically in isoproterenol-induced rat model of CHF. Fifteen days after isoproterenol administration, rats exhibited cardiac dysfunction, hypertrophy, and LV remodeling along with reduced baroreflex sensitivity. Prophylactic and therapeutic treatment with T arjuna improved cardiac functions and baroreflex sensitivity. It also attenuated hypertrophy and fibrosis of the LV. Fluvastatin treatment exerted a similar protective effect against myocardial remodeling and heart failure. Further, T arjuna and fluvastatin significantly reduced oxidative stress and inflammatory cytokine level in CHF rats. In conclusion, T arjuna exerts beneficial effect on LV functions, myocardial remodeling, and autonomic control in CHF possibly through maintaining endogenous antioxidant enzyme activities, inhibiting lipid peroxidation and cytokine levels.",

The rats, randomly divided into two groups, received a single oral dose of 8 mg/kg clopidogrel (CP) bisulfate form I and form II, respectively, under fasting condition. The plasma concentrations of CP and its inactive carboxylic acid metabolite (CAS 144457-28-3, IM) were simultaneously determined by a sensitive, specific LC-MS/MS method. The pharmacokinetic parameters included C(max), T(max), t1/2, AUC(0-t), AUC(0-infinity). The AUC(0-infinity) of CP was 13.78 +/- 0.67 and 11.46 +/- 1.98 ng/ mL x h for CP form I and form II, respectively. The AUC(0-infinity) of IM was 33.08 +/- 5.76 and 21.67 +/- 8.95 microg/mL x h for CP form I and form II, respectively. The maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) of CP was 3.81 +/- 0.54 ng/mL for CP form I and 3.18 +/- 0.31 ng/mL for CP form II, the C(max) of IM was 3.42 +/- 0.41 and 2.08 +/- 0.68 microg/ mL for the CP form I and form II, respectively. There was an obvious difference between form I and form II for C(max) and the area under the plasma concentration time curve for both CP and IM after a t-test. This study shows that CP form I has better bioavailability in rats than CP form II.",

A literature search was conducted to identify original research studies published through October 2010 testing immediate treatment with a statin in statin-na\u00efve patients following aneurysmal SAH. Six randomized controlled clinical trials and four observational studies were identified. Despite inconsistent results among studies, a meta-analysis of randomized controlled data showed a significant reduction in delayed ischemic deficits with statins. Effect on vasospasm was more difficult to determine, due to differences in definitions used among studies. Interpretations from observational studies were limited by the use of relatively small sample sizes, historical controls, and treatment variability.", 
    "24": "The thienopyridines inhibit platelet activation and aggregation by directly inhibiting the platelet P2Y12 adenosine diphosphate receptor. The available thienopyridines are prodrugs and must be converted into active forms by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. An important portion of the variability in platelet response to clopidogrel is explained by the variability in plasma concentrations of the clopidogrel active metabolite. Several reports have thus progressively raised concerns about potential drug interactions as a result of inhibition or induction of CYP450 enzymes. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics studies have notably shown that concomitant use of clopidogrel and some proton pump inhibitors reduces the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel. Several other drugs (metabolized through CYP3A4 such as statins or antifungals) similarly impact the pharmacologic response to clopidogrel. Conversely, agents that induce CYP activity increase clopidogrel responsiveness. However, the data supporting the clinical relevance of such pharmacological drug interactions have been controversial. This review will provide an overview of the mechanisms underlying thienopyridine-associated drug-drug interactions, and highlight the most recent developments in the field and propose guidance for the practitioner.",

IL-8 protein levels, quantified by ELISA, were increased in a concentration-dependent manner when cells were stimulated by LPS or AFA. Fluvastatin strongly decreased the levels of IL-8, in a concentration-dependent manner, in whole blood from CF patients. However, its inhibitory effect was decreased or absent in whole blood from healthy subjects. Furthermore, the inhibition induced by fluvastatin in CF whole blood was reversed in the presence of intermediates within the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, mevalonate, farnesyl pyprophosphate or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate that activate small GTPases by isoprenylation.",

Amlodipine and atorvastatin are both substrates of CYP3A and are among the drugs most frequently used by patients with hepatitis C. This study was conducted to examine the effect of telaprevir on atorvastatin and amlodipine pharmacokinetics (PK). This was an open-label, single sequence, nonrandomized study involving 21 healthy male and female volunteers. A coformulation of 5 mg amlodipine and 20 mg atorvastatin was administered on day 1. Telaprevir was taken with food as a 750-mg dose every 8 h from day 11 until day 26, and a single dose of the amlodipine-atorvastatin combination was readministered on day 17. Plasma samples were collected for determination of the PK of telaprevir, amlodipine, atorvastatin, ortho-hydroxy atorvastatin, and para-hydroxy atorvastatin. When administration with telaprevir was compared with administration without telaprevir, the least-square mean ratios (90% confidence limits) for amlodipine were 1.27 (1.21, 1.33) for the maximum drug concentration in serum (C(max)) and 2.79 (2.58, 3.01) for the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 h to infinity (AUC(0-\u221e)); for atorvastatin, they were 10.6 (8.74, 12.9) for the C(max) and 7.88 (6.84, 9.07) for the AUC(0-\u221e). Telaprevir significantly increased exposure to amlodipine and atorvastatin, consistent with the inhibitory effect of telaprevir on the CYP3A-mediated metabolism of these agents.", 
    "29": "Psoriasis is a chronic IL-23/Th17 pathway-associated skin disease. An increased expression of lesional CCL20 can recruit CCR6+ Th17, and lesional cytokine milieu persistently activates keratinocytes to produce CCL20. Lipid-lowering drugs, statins, are known to possess immune-modulating functions. In this study, we explored an inhibitory effect of statins on CCL20/CCR6 interaction. We demonstrated that IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-17A significantly increased CCL20 production from HaCaT cells. However, these increments were markedly inhibited by fluvastatin and simvastatin, but not by pravastatin. In the chemotaxis migration assay, pretreatment with fluvastatin and simvastatin inhibited the migration of human CD4+ T cells towards CCL20. However, the level of CCR6 surface expression in memory CD4+ T cells was not affected. Our results suggest that not all, but specific types of statins may be of benefit in alleviating psoriasis partially via interrupting CCL20/CCR6 chemotactic interaction, the mechanism which may eventually lessen the infiltration of Th17 cells.",

Complications of cerebrovascular disease demonstrated a 2.22- and 5.29-fold higher incidence in cardiac events and cerebral events (P < 0.01 and P < 0.001, respectively). Presence of diabetes mellitus (DM) in patients without complication significantly increased the incidence in both cardiac events (2.37) and cerebral events (2.15) as compared with non-DM patients for primary prevention (P < 0.001 and P < 0.01, respectively). For the secondary prevention, DM patients with complication of cardiac disease showed a significantly higher incidence in both cardiac events (1.59) and cerebral events (3.79) compared with non-DM patients (P < 0.05 and P < 0.01, respectively). In contrast, DM patients with complications of cerebrovascular disease showed a significantly higher incidence in cerebral events (2.58, P < 0.05), but not cardiac events compared with non-DM patients. Similarly, the presence of hypertension significantly increased the incidence in both cardiac (1.64) and cerebral events (1.81) for primary prevention (P < 0.01 and P < 0.05, respectively). For secondary prevention, hypertension in patients with complication of cardiac or cerebrovascular disease did not affect incidence in both cardiac and cerebral events. In the patients without complication, high triglycerides and low high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), but not low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), increased cerebral events, while only LDL-C significantly increased cardiac events.

Platelet aggregation was assessed by conventional aggregometry, and platelet adhesion and aggregation under flow conditions by cone-and-plate(let) technology (Impact-R). Smoking, diabetes, and hypertension were more common in AMI compared to control subjects (p\u2009<\u20090.01 for all). Furthermore, aspirin, clopidogrel, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and statin administration were more common in AMI compared to controls (p\u2009<\u20090.01 for all). %FMD but not %NTG was significantly lower in AMI patients compared to controls (10.2\u2009\u00b1\u20094.2% vs. 15.4\u2009\u00b1\u20094.4%; p\u2009<\u20090.001 and 17.2\u2009\u00b1\u20093.9% vs. 18.0\u2009\u00b1\u20093.7%, p\u2009=\u20090.803, respectively). %FMD was significantly and inversely associated with all platelet functions tests (p\u2009<\u20090.001) in all study participants. In a multivariate logistic regression (unadjusted and adjusted for age, gender, smoking status, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, overweight, family history, and concomitant medications), %FMD remained the best predictor of platelet function, irrespective of group allocation (AMI patients or controls).

Advanced glycation end products (AGE) and their receptor RAGE axis is involved in accelerated atherosclerosis in diabetes as well. However, the role of AGE-RAGE axis in macrophage cholesterol efflux is not fully understood. We examined here whether AGE-RAGE axis could impair cholesterol efflux from human macrophage cells, THP-1 cells by suppressing ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression. We further investigated the effects of rosuvastatin on cholesterol efflux from AGE-exposed THP-1 cells. AGE increased reactive oxygen species generation in THP-1 cells, which was completely inhibited by rosuvastatin, anti-RAGE-antibody or diphenylene iodonium chloride (DPI), an inhibitor of NADPH oxidase. The antioxidative effect of rosuvastatin on AGE-exposed THP-1 cells was significantly prevented by geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP). AGE decreased ABCA1 and ABCG1 mRNA levels, and subsequently reduced cholesterol efflux from THP-1 cells, which was prevented by GGPP. DPI mimicked the effects of rosuvastain. The results demonstrated that rosuvastatin could inhibit the AGE-induced reduction of THP-1 macrophage cholesterol efflux by suppressing NADPH oxidase activity via inhibition of geranylgeranylation of Rac-1. Our present study provides a novel beneficial aspect of rosuvastatin in diabetes; rosuvastain may prevent the development and progression of atherosclerosis in diabetes by not only reducing serum cholesterol level, but also by improving cholesterol efflux from foam cells of the arterial wall via blocking the harmful effects of AGE on macrophages.",

Prior to loading SIM, we first characterized the HA hydrogels for their mechanical properties and swelling ratios. The results from this testing indicated that these two factors improved as the substitution degree of 2-aminoethyl methacrylate (AEMA) increased. MTT and live/dead assays showed that the HA hydrogels have good biocompatibility for use as scaffolds for bone tissue regeneration. Moreover, another MTT assay showed that the photo-cured HA hydrogels III fabricated with 30% AEMA (300 mg) conjugated HA (HA-AEMA iii) loaded with between 0.1 and 1 mg of SIM had a similar cytotoxicity as compared to the HA hydrogel III itself.

Bypass grafts were performed for rest pain (34%) or tissue loss (66%), while 56% of the reported cases were categorized as \"disadvantaged\" because of compromised vein quality or diseased arterial outflow. A 10-MHz low-profile transducer was used to image the entire bypass at case completion. Technical adequacy of the grafts was verified by absence of retained valves, arteriovenous fistulas, or localized velocity increases and presence of bypass-dependent distal pulses. Modified Rutherford scores were calculated as surrogate markers of runoff resistance and compared to distal graft EDV. The primary study end point was graft patency during a 1-year posttreatment period. Patency rates were determined using Kaplan-Meier life table methodology and compared using the log-rank test.

The main purpose was to evaluate the prevalence of IP among medical inpatients in a medical center, so to evaluate the associative factors of IP in Taiwan. From January to December of 2009, all patients aged 65 years and older who were discharged from the medical wards of Taipei Veterans General Hospital were randomly sampled for study (the sampling rate around 1.0%). The IP was evaluated by the STOPP and START criteria. Each medical record was carefully reviewed by physicians who had been trained. Overall, 520 records of elderly medical ward inpatients (mean age = 79.2 \u00b1 6.7 years, 73.8% males) were included for study. In total, 3455 items of medication were prescribed for these 520 patients (mean = 6.6 \u00b1 3.2 items). According to STOPP criteria, 36.2% of the study subjects had at least one potentially inappropriate medication (PIM). The most common PIMs were: (1) medications that may adversely affect those who are prone to falls, e.g., benzodiazepines, neuroleptics and first generation antihistamines (14.2%). (2) Ca-channel blockers with chronic constipation (12.3%). (3) Use of neuroleptic agents (5.6%). (4) Long-term, long-acting benzodiazepines (2.5%). (5) Prolonged use of first generation antihistamines (2.1%). Besides, 218 patients (41.9%) had at least one potentially prescribing omission (PPO). Common PPOs included: (1) statin therapy in diabetes mellitus if coexisting major cardiovascular risk factors present (19.0%). (2) Antiplatelet therapy in diabetes mellitus with co-existing major cardiovascular risk factors (12.5%). (3) Metformin with type 2 diabetes with or without metabolic syndrome (in the absence of renal impairment) (8.7%). (4) Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blockers with chronic heart failure (7.3%). (5) Aspirin or clopidogrel with a documented history of atherosclerotic coronary, cerebral or peripheral vascular disease in patients with sinus rhythm (7.1%). Logistic regression showed that older age and number of medications were significant risk factors for PIMs. In conclusion, the prevalence of PIMs among elderly medical inpatients in a medical center in Taiwan was 36.2% and PPOs was 41.9%.

The most common manifestation of myopathy is muscle pain (usually symmetrical, involving proximal muscles) without creatinine kinase (CK) elevation or less frequently with mild CK elevation. Clinically significant rhabdomyolysis (muscle symptoms with CK elevation >10 times the upper limit of normal and with creatinine elevation) is extremely rare. Myopathy complicates the use of all statins (class effect) and is dose-dependent. The pathophysiologic mechanism of statin-associated myopathy is unknown and probably multifactorial. The risk of statin-associated myopathy can be minimized by identifying vulnerable patients (i.e. patients with impaired renal or liver function, advanced age, hypothyroidism, etc.) and/or by eliminating-avoiding statin interactions with specific drugs (cytochrome P-450 3A4 inhibitors, gemfibrozil, etc.). In symptomatic patients, the severity of symptoms, the magnitude of CK elevation and the risk/benefit ratio of statin continuation should be considered before statin treatment is discontinued. Potential strategies are the use of the same statin at a lower dose and if symptoms recur the initiation of fluvastatin XL 80 mg daily or rosuvastatin intermittently in low dose (5-10mg), combined usually with ezetimibe 10mg daily. Failure of these approaches necessitates the use of non-statin lipid lowering drugs (ezetimibe, colesevelam). In order to provide evidence based recommendations for the appropriate management of statin-intolerant patients we need randomized clinical trials directly comparing the myopathic potential of different lipid-lowering medications at comparable doses.",

The present study examined the effects of colesevelam treatment in nondiabetic men with metabolic syndrome. Twenty men completed the study, which consisted of two 8-week phases of treatment with colesevelam (3.75 g/day) or placebo and a 6-week washout between study phases. Of the 20 men, 17 took statins throughout. The fasting plasma LDL cholesterol, triglyceride, glucose, and glycated hemoglobin levels were measured in the last 2 weeks of each study phase. Nonesterified fatty acids and 3-hydroxybutyrate, insulin, and glucose were measured hourly for 5 hours during fasting and during an extended glucose tolerance test. The colesevelam treatment reduced LDL cholesterol from 96 \u00b1 28 mg/dl to 78 \u00b1 32 mg/dl (p <0.006) and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 8.2% (p = 0.07). Triglycerides increased by 17% (p <0.02). The fasting plasma glucose was reduced by 5 mg/dl (p <0.03), and glycated hemoglobin remained unchanged by colesevelam. No significant treatment changes were noted for the 2-hour glucose test or insulin sensitivity. The fasting nonesterified fatty acid level was significantly reduced with treatment but the 3-hydroxybutyrate level was unchanged. Insulin-mediated suppression of nonesterified fatty acids during extended glucose tolerance test was significantly less effective during treatment than during placebo. In conclusion, colesevelam significantly reduced the LDL cholesterol levels, even though the baseline LDL cholesterol level was low owing to statin treatment. The fasting and postprandial blood glucose level but not the glycated hemoglobin level was lowered by colesevelam therapy. The effect on fasting glucose was unrelated to the changes in insulin resistance or fatty acid oxidation. Finally, an increase in triglycerides with colesevelam therapy might have been related to a lesser suppression of nonesterified fatty acids levels in the postprandial state.",

Additionally, experimental evidence suggests a central role for cellular cholesterol in amyloid-\u03b2 protein precursor (A\u03b2PP) processing. The present study investigated whether brain capillary endothelial cells (BCEC; the anatomical basis of the BBB) are capable of endogenous A\u03b2PP synthesis and whether and to what extent A\u03b2PP synthesis and processing is under control of cellular cholesterol homeostasis. Intracellular cholesterol metabolism was pharmacologically manipulated by using natural and synthetic liver-X receptor (LXR) agonists. Using an in vitro model of the BBB consisting of primary porcine BCEC (pBCEC), we demonstrate that endogenous full-length A\u03b2PP synthesis by pBCEC is significantly increased while the amount of cell-associated, amyloidogenic A\u03b2 oligomers is decreased in response to 24(S)-hydroxycholesterol (24OH-C) or 27OH-C, TO901317, cholesterol, or simvastatin treatment. Oxysterols, as well as simvastatin, enhanced the secretion of non-amyloidogenic sA\u03b2PP\u03b1 up to 2.5-fold. In parallel, LXR agonists reduced cholesterol biosynthesis by 30-80% while stimulating esterification (up to 2.5-fold) and efflux (up to 2.5-fold) of cellular cholesterol by modifying hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP-2), acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase 2 (ACAT-2), and ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) expression levels. In a polarized in vitro model mimicking the BBB, pBCEC secreted sA\u03b2PP\u03b1 preferentially to the basolateral compartment. In summary endothelial cells of the BBB actively synthesize A\u03b2PP, A\u03b2 oligomers, and secrete A\u03b2PP\u03b1 in a polarized manner. A\u03b2PP processing by pBCEC is regulated by LXR agonists, which have been proven beneficial in experimental AD models.",

The primary objective of the study was to determine the effect of once-daily dosing of a combination therapy for blood pressure (BP) and dyslipidemia using home BP monitoring on reaching clinical BP and the effect of daily dosing of combination therapy on reaching lipid goals. The study was conducted in middle-aged, indigent, African Americans who had high-risk, resistant hypertension and dyslipidemia. Patients were randomly assigned to either the home and clinic BP group or usual care group and were followed for 6 months. The average BPs for each group were compared and used to titrate the study drug appropriately. Both groups achieved significant declines in BP, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (P<.0001). These findings demonstrate that BP control could be achieved at a rate of 43.5% compared with the 2004 national control rate of 35%. The LDL control rate was also improved. Cardiovascular risk reduction has been proven to be achieved through managing lipids and BP. This trial demonstrates that these goals can be achieved similar to other groups in indigent African Americans with high-risk hypertension and dyslipidemia.", 
    "153": "Leptin contributes to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Ang II (angiotensin II), a proatherogenic cytokine, increases leptin synthesis in cultured adipocytes. Statin suppresses leptin expression in adipocytes and human coronary artery endothelial cells. However, the effect of Ang II and statin on leptin expression in VSMCs (vascular smooth muscle cells), the major cell types\u00a0in atheroma, is poorly understood. Thus the aim of the present study was to investigate the molecular mechanism of atorvastatin for reducing leptin expression after Ang II stimulation in VSMCs. VSMCs from human coronary artery were cultured. Ang II stimulation increased leptin protein and mRNA and phospho-JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) expression. Exogenous addition of Dp44mT (2,2'-dipyridyl-N,N-dimethylsemicarbazone) and mevalonate increased leptin protein expression similarly to Ang II. Atorvastatin, SP600125, JNK siRNA (small interfering RNA) and NAC (N-acetylcysteine) completely attenuated the leptin and phospho-JNK protein expression induced by Ang II. Ang II significantly increased ROS (reactive oxygen species) formation in human VSMCs. Addition of atorvastatin and NAC significantly attenuated the formation of ROS induced by Ang II. Addition of atorvastatin and SP600125 inhibited the phosphorylation of Rac1 induced by Ang II. The gel shift and promoter activity assay showed that Ang II increased AP-1 (activator protein-1)-binding activity and leptin promoter activity, while SP600125, NAC and atorvastatin inhibited the AP-1-binding activity and leptin promoter activity induced by Ang II. Ang II significantly increased the migration and proliferation of cultured VSMCs, while addition of atorvastatin, SP600125, NAC and leptin siRNA before Ang II stimulation significantly inhibited the migration and proliferation of VSMCs induced by Ang II. Ang II significantly increased secretion of leptin from human VSMCs, and addition of SP600125, atorvastatin and NAC before Ang II stimulation almost completely inhibited the leptin secretion induced by Ang II. In conclusion, Ang II induces leptin expression in human VSMCs, and atorvastatin could inhibit the leptin expression induced by Ang II. The inhibitory effect of atorvastatin on Ang II-induced leptin expression was mediated by Rac, ROS and JNK pathways.",

Clinical symptoms including weakness of hind limbs, staggering gait and body weight loss, accompanied by marked plasma creatinine kinase elevation in rats fed cerivastatin at around Day 6 to 8. Interestingly, microscopic examination revealed that cerivastatin-induced muscle damages characterized by hypercontraction (opaque) and necrosis of the fibers were of particular abundance in the soleus muscle at Day 8, whereas these histological lesions in the extensor digitorum longus and tibialis anterior were negligible, even at Day 9. Prior to manifestation of muscle damage, swollen mitochondria and autophagic vacuoles in the soleus were observed as the earliest ultra structural changes at Day 6; then activated lysosomes, disarray of myofibril and dilated sarcoplasmic reticulum vesicles became ubiquitous at Day 8. These results demonstrate that cerivastatin induces type I fiber-predominant muscles injury, which is associated with mitochondrial damage, in young male F344 rats.

    "180": "Statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) represent the cornerstone of drug therapy to reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and cardiovascular risk. However, even optimal statin management of LDL cholesterol leaves many patients with residual cardiovascular risk, in part because statins are more effective in reducing LDL cholesterol than apolipoprotein B (Apo B). Apo B may be a better marker of atherogenic risk than LDL cholesterol because Apo B measures the total number of all atherogenic particles (total atherosclerotic burden), including LDL, very low-density lipoprotein, intermediate-density lipoprotein, remnant lipoproteins, and lipoprotein(a). To determine whether Apo B is a better indicator of baseline cardiovascular risk and residual risk after lipid therapy compared with LDL cholesterol, a MEDLINE search of the literature published in English from January 1, 1975, through December 1, 2010, was conducted. On the basis of data from most population studies, elevated Apo B was more strongly associated with incident coronary heart disease than similarly elevated LDL cholesterol. Apo B was also a superior benchmark (vs LDL cholesterol) of statins' cardioprotective efficacy in both primary-prevention and secondary-prevention trials. To minimize cardiovascular risk among persons with hypercholesterolemia or dyslipidemia, the best available evidence suggests that intensive therapy with statins should be initiated to achieve the lowest possible Apo B level (with adequate drug toleration) and then other therapies (eg, niacin, bile acid resins, ezetimibe) added to potentiate these Apo B-lowering effects. In future consensus lipid-lowering treatment guidelines, Apo B should be considered as an index of residual risk, a potential parameter of treatment efficacy, and a treatment target to minimize risk of coronary heart disease.",

Thanks to this property, it has been hypothesized that statins may have anti-tumor activities. We investigated this issue in BALB-neuT mice, which developed Her2/neu-positive mammary cancers with 100% penetrance, and in TUBO cells, a cell line established from these tumors. Contrary to the mammary glands of BALB/c mice, the tumor tissue from BALB-neuT animals had constitutively activated Ras and ERK1/2. These were reduced by the oral administration of atorvastatin, but the statin did not prevent tumor growth in mice nor reduce the proliferation of TUBO cells, although it lowered the activity of mevalonate pathway and Ras/ERK1/2 signaling. By decreasing the mevalonate pathway-derived metabolite geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate and the RhoA/RhoA kinase signaling, atorvastatin activated NF-\u03baB, that sustained cell proliferation. Unexpectedly Her2-positive cells were much more sensitive to the inhibition of RhoA-dependent pathways than to the suppression of Ras-dependent pathways elicited by atorvastatin. Only the simultaneous inhibition of RhoA/RhoA-kinase/NF-\u03baB and Ras/ERK1/2 signaling allowed the statin to decrease tumor cell proliferation. Our study demonstrates that Her2-positive mammary cancers have redundant signals to sustain their proliferation and shows that statins simultaneously reduce the pro-proliferative Ras/ERK1/2 axis and activate the pro-proliferative RhoA/RhoA-kinase/NF-\u03baB axis. The latter event dissipates the antitumor efficacy that may arise from the former one. Only the association of statins and NF-\u03baB-targeted therapies efficiently decreased proliferation of tumor cells.",

    "187": "Myositis-myalgia is the most common cause of statin intolerance, leading to cessation of statin use, with consequent failure to lower LDL cholesterol to target levels for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). We hypothesize that symptomatic myositis-myalgia in hypercholesterolemic statin-treated patients with concurrent 25 (OH) vitamin D deficiency and statin intolerance may reflect a reversible interaction between vitamin D deficiency and statins on skeletal muscle. In hypercholesterolemic, vitamin D deficient patients, intolerant to statins because of myositis-myalgia, three non-blinded clinical case series have uniformly demonstrated that after supplementation with oral vitamin D2 which normalizes serum 25 (OH) vitamin D levels, statins can be successfully re-instituted in >90% of patients, without recurrent myositis-myalgia, with reduction of LDL cholesterol to target levels. Empirically, in 68 hypercholesterolemic patients, unable to tolerate\u22651 statin because of myositis-myalgia, selected by low (<32 ng/ml) serum 25 (OH) vitamin D, we have prospectively assessed whether resolution of vitamin D deficiency would result in statin tolerance, free of myositis-myalgia. On no statins, 50,000 units of vitamin D2 was given twice/week for 3 weeks, and was then continued once/week. After 3 weeks on vitamin D supplementation, statins were restarted, and patients were re-assessed after 3 months on statins while continuing vitamin D supplementation. At 3 months follow-up, on vitamin D supplementation and re-instituted statins, 62 of 68 (91%) previously statin-intolerant patients now tolerated statins well and were asymptomatic without myositis-myalgia. In these 68 patients, on vitamin D supplementation and statins, mean\u00b1SD vitamin D rose from 22\u00b17 to 43\u00b113 ng/ml (p<0.0001), and LDL cholesterol fell from 162\u00b155 to 101\u00b135 mg/dl (p<0.0001). Despite published and new empirical evidence, the medical establishment has refused to accept the hypothesis, requiring placebo-controlled, double-blind studies, none having been reported to date. A placebo-controlled, double-blind study is needed to document that normalization of serum 25 (OH) vitamin D levels in vitamin D deficient, statin intolerant patients would facilitate re-introduction of statins with concurrent freedom from myositis-myalgia. The ability to reverse myositis-myalgia in vitamin D deficient, statin intolerant, hypercholesterolemic patients by vitamin D supplementation would be extraordinarily valuable, facilitating reinstitution of statins to lower LDL cholesterol to reduce risk of CVD events.

Three months after osteoporosis had been induced and 4 weeks after feeding had begun, the tibia and femur BMD of OVX rats administered RMD showed significant increases compared with that of all other groups of OVX rats. Closer examination using microcomputed tomography also revealed that the RMD-administered rats had denser trabecular bone volume and a higher trabecular number compared to all other rat groups. Reconstructed 3D imaging indicated increases in cancellous bone mineral content, cancellous bone mineral density, and cortical bone mineral content of the proximal tibia in OVX rats. These findings indicate that administration of monacolin K and phytoestrogen diosgenin could prevent bone loss induced by estrogen deficiency.",

    "200": "Mito-CP11, a mitochondria-targeted nitroxide formed by conjugating a triphenylphosphonium cation to a five-membered nitroxide, carboxy-proxyl (CP), has been used as a superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetic. In this study, we investigated the antiproliferative and cytotoxic properties of submicromolar levels of Mito-CP11 alone and in combination with fluvastatin, a well known cholesterol lowering drug, in breast cancer cells. Mito-CP11, but not CP or CP plus the cationic ligand, methyl triphenylphosphonium (Me-TPP+), inhibited MCF-7 breast cancer cell proliferation. Mito-CP11 had only minimal effect on MCF-10A, non-tumorigenic mammary epithelial cells. Mito-CP11, however, significantly enhanced fluvastatin-mediated cytotoxicity in MCF-7 cells. Mito-CP11 alone and in combination with fluvastatin inhibited nuclear factor kappa-B activity mainly in MCF-7 cells. We conclude that mitochondria-targeted nitroxide antioxidant molecules (such as Mito-CP11) that are non-toxic to non-tumorigenic cells could enhance the cytostatic and cytotoxic effects of statins in breast cancer cells. This strategy of combining mitochondria-targeted non-toxic molecules with cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs may be successfully used to enhance the efficacy of antitumor therapies in breast cancer treatment.",

All studies to date are limited to the definition of statin-induced myotoxicity omitting to investigate whether and how HMGR inhibition influences muscle functions. To this end, 3-mo-old male rats (Rattus norvegicus) were treated for 3 wk with a daily intraperitoneal injection of simvastatin (1.5 mg/kg/d), and biochemical, morphological, mechanical, and functional analysis were performed on extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscle. Our results show that EDL muscles from simvastatin-treated rats exhibited reduced HMGR activity; a 15% shift from the fastest myosin heavy-chain (MHC) isoform IIb to the slower IIa/x; and reduced power output and unloaded shortening velocity, by 41 and 23%, respectively, without any change in isometric force and endurance. Moreover, simvastatin-treated rats showed a decrease of maximum speed reached and the latency to fall off the rotaroad (\u223c-30%). These results indicate that the molecular mechanism of the impaired muscle function following statin treatment could be related to the plasticity of fast MHC isoform expression.",

Including baseline C-reactive protein into a Framingham risk model very modestly improved risk prediction. Baseline C-reactive protein did not indicate the magnitude of the atorvastatin effect on CV outcome (P = 0.54). At 6 months, atorvastatin reduced median LDL-c by 40.3% and median C-reactive protein by 27.4%. In those randomized to atorvastatin, lower on-treatment LDL-c at 6 months was associated with a significant reduction in subsequent CV events [OR 0.41 (0.22, 0.75), P = 0.004] comparing those above and below the median (2.1 mmol/L). In contrast, C-reactive protein below the median (1.83 mg/L) compared with C-reactive protein above the median was not associated with a significant reduction in CV events [OR 0.86 (0.49, 1.51), P = 0.60]. Consequently, addition of on-treatment C-reactive protein to LDL-c did not improve prediction of statin efficacy.",

Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) has been shown to suppress growth factor-induced proliferation of vascular smooth muscle and endothelial cells in animal models. We hypothesized that MMF might modify the inflammatory component of atherosclerosis in SLE. We examined the effect of MMF on atherosclerosis as measured by changes in carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) or coronary artery calcium (CAC) over 2 years. CAC and carotid IMT were measured at baseline and 2 years later in a cohort of 187 patients with SLE. The cohort was 91% women, 59% Caucasian, and 35% African-American, with a mean age of 45 \u00b1 11 years. Of these, 12.5% (n = 25) received MMF during follow-up. The daily dose ranged from 500 to 3,000 mg/day, and duration ranged from 84 days to the entire 2 years. We divided MMF users into three groups: low exposure (<1,500 mg average daily dose), high exposure (\u22651,500 average daily dose), and any exposure of MMF (<1,500 or \u22651,500 average daily dose) for 2 years.

    "246": "The emergence of atherosclerosis imaging, using coronary calcium scanning (CAC) and carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) and plaque as stronger predictors of cardiovascular events than risk factors of atherosclerosis, has created a paradigm shift in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Rather than population-derived indices to define normal or abnormal low-density lipoprotein (or other lipid values) in the untreated individual patient, it is more appropriate to define \"normal\" as \"cholesterol values at which level there is no subclinical atherosclerosis\" and \"abnormal\" as \"cholesterol values at which level there is subclinical atherosclerosis,\" with the severity of \"abnormal\" depending on the degree of subclinical atherosclerosis. Similarly, the low-density lipoprotein treatment goal is the level at which atherosclerosis progression is halted. Extension of the subclinical atherosclerosis risk-based paradigms to primary prevention trials dramatically changes the manner in which trials should be conducted in the future, as well as the results of trials already performed. For example, asymptomatic patients with a CAC score of 0 have an extraordinarily low event rate but have been included in primary prevention statin trials even though their risk without treatment is very small. Reanalysis of the statin primary prevention trials after excluding the percentage (40%) of patients who would be expected to have a CAC score of 0 yields an absolute risk increase of 60% in both the placebo group (from 5.4% to 8.5%), and the statin group (from 3.0% to 4.8%). Absolute risk reduction increased by 58% (from 2.4% to 3.8%). Relative risk reduction of 44% was unchanged. In conclusion, 1) the presence or absence of atherosclerosis as measured by CAC redefines normal or abnormal lipid levels in an individual patient; 2) statin absolute risk reduction is significantly greater than previously appreciated; and 3) patients with a CAC score of 0 should be excluded from primary prevention randomized controlled trials.",

This may lead to a better understanding of the intricate link between CRP levels and the risk of ensuing vascular events and the intermediary role of statins in reducing the vascular risk beyond what is justified by the lipocentric theory, by reducing the levels of CRP."
