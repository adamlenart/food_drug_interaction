    "1": "A 60-year-old African American man with a significant past medical history presented to the emergency department with acute renal failure secondary to rhabdomyolysis. In addition, liver enzymes were elevated to greater than 3 times normal. The only change in medication was the initiation of diltiazem 3 weeks earlier for atrial fibrillation to a complicated medication regimen that included atorvastatin.", 
    "2": "Rhabdomyolysis has been reported in patients receiving hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors when coadministered with agents that may inhibit their metabolism. Atorvastatin is the most potent of this class of agents currently available and is commonly used in the treatment of hyperlipidemia. Rhabdomyolysis resulting from the drug interaction between diltiazem and other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors has been described in the literature. However, no report has specifically associated this adverse event with atorvastatin and diltiazem. We describe a patient with a complex medication regimen who was admitted for rhabdomyolysis and accompanying acute renal failure, along with acute hepatitis, thought to be secondary to a drug interaction between atorvastatin and diltiazem.", 
    "3": "While optimizing the patient's lipid profile should be the primary factor in choosing one statin over another, the potential for drug interactions requires close attention. All patients beginning HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor therapy should be counseled regarding the signs and symptoms of muscle injury; particular attention should be paid to those patients who are taking medications that may interact.", 
    "4": "The gene cluster responsible for ML-236B (compactin) biosynthesis has recently been characterized from P. citrinum No. 41520. Here, we describe how the ML-236B-producing strain was improved using a cosmid-mediated recombination technique. The introduction of the cosmid pML48, which contains seven of the nine ML-236B biosynthetic genes, into P. citrinum No. 41520 resulted in transformants which produced increased amounts of ML-236B. Southern analysis showed that pML48 had been incorporated by a homologous recombination event, and all high producers possessed two copies of each of the seven genes, mlcA- mlcF and mlcR, suggesting that increased dosage of the biosynthetic gene cluster was responsible for the enhanced production of ML-236B. On the other hand, various kinds of mutants with decreased titers of ML-236B were also obtained. Characterization of one such mutant, designated as T48.28, which was more sensitive to ML-236B than the parental strain, suggested that one of the ML-236B biosynthetic genes, mlcD, which encodes a putative HMG-CoA reductase, was involved in conferring resistance to ML-236B.", 
    "5": "To observe the anti-inflammatory effect of cerivastatin in a mouse model of vascular injury and its cholesterol-lowering effect.", 
    "6": "We developed a mouse model of vascular remodeling induced by polyethylene cuff placement and determined the anti-inflammatory effects of cerivastatin in wild mice. Cerivastatin was given by Alzet micro-osmotic minipumps implanted intraperitoneally at the same time as cuff placement at doses of 0.1 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg per day, respectively for 2 weeks after cuff placement. The insufficient doses of Cerivastatin to lower serum cholesterol and systolic blood pressure through the neointimal formation and BrdU index were investigated in mouse femoral injury artery induced by cuff-placement.", 
    "7": "There was a little change in serum cholesterol by the treatment with cerivastatin, the cross-sectional area of intima of injured femoral artery was significantly increased, the neointima formation was significantly increased by the cuff-induced vascular injury at day 14. The neointimal formation and BrdU index were inhibited in the 1 mg/kg cerivastatin, but not in the 0.1 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg cerivastatin. Furthermore, 1 mg/kg of cerivastatin significantly inhibited the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) without lowering serum cholesterol.", 
    "8": "These results suggest that cerivastatin can inhibit vascular inflammation and the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) through its lipid-lowering independent action. Such effects of cerivastatin may be an important mechanism, by which it prevents the development of atherosclerotic lesions.", 
    "9": "Myopathy in its severe forms including rhabdomyolysis is a very rare adverse effect occurring during monotherapy with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors ('statins') and is associated with pronounced signs of oxidation injury. This has been found at a local (muscle) as well as at a systemic level (blood). Several lines of evidence indicate that even mild forms of myopathy during statin treatment may be associated with in vivo oxidation injury. In contrast, statin therapy has been shown to be associated with a decrease in oxidation injury.", 
    "10": "The aim of this study was to investigate whether patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia who did not exhibit any symptoms or abnormalities in safety parameters during 6 months of treatment with various statins (atorvastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin) did exhibit a change in oxidation injury as assessed by the isoprostane levels.", 
    "11": "Blood (plasma and serum) as well as urine was tested before and 1, 3 and 6 months after starting statin therapy.", 
    "12": "Out of 111 treated patients (63 males, 48 females; aged 19 to 58 years) who did not experience any adverse effects during statin treatment, 11 (seven males, four females; aged 24 to 51 years) showed a pronounced increase in 8-epi-prostaglandin (PG) F(2alpha) in all the compartments examined. In the remaining 100 patients (56 males, 44 females; aged 19 to 58 years) there was either no change in or even an apparent decrease in 8-epi-PGF(2alpha). This increase was monitored with all the statins administered. If elevated, the increase in 8-epi-PGF(2alpha) remained without change throughout the entire follow-up period. No sex difference or differential response between smokers and nonsmokers was observed.", 
    "13": "These findings indicate that in the absence of other clinically observable adverse effects, in some of the patients, for an as yet unknown reason, statin therapy may be associated with increased oxidation injury. The fact that changing to another statin is apparently not necessarily associated with an identical response raises the question of a specific predisposition for certain compounds in a given patient. These data add a further piece of evidence that mild adverse effects of statins that are difficult to assess might be much more prevalent than widely considered. The clinical relevance and consequence of these findings still remains to be assessed.", 
    "14": "As greater numbers of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals live to middle-age and beyond, there is growing concern that elevated cholesterol and lipid values will lead to cardiovascular complications in such patients. Furthermore, several of the highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART) used to reduce levels of circulating HIV and extend acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related survival are associated with a rise in plasma lipids. Anecdotal reports suggest such rises may be linked to cardiovascular complications. Herein, we review the case of a 74-year-old HIV-infected man with advanced coronary artery disease. He was prescribed simvastatin for control of hyperlipidemia and within 4 weeks developed muscle pain, proximal muscle weakness, myoglobinuria, and a markedly elevated creatinine phosphokinase (CPK). Simvastatin was discontinued, and rhabdomyolysis improved rapidly with conservative care. This report emphasizes this rare, but potentially significant, side effect of statin anticholesterol agents. Medical providers who prescribe statins must remember to check CPK levels when their HIV-infected patients complain of muscle pain. Discontinuing the offending drug will usually result in rapid diminution of muscle pain and inflammation and improve muscle strength.", 
    "15": "Ras-homologous GTPases are involved in the regulation of genotoxic stress-induced gene expression and cell death. Since they need C-terminal isoprenylation for correct intracellular localization and function, we investigated whether depletion of cells from isopren precursor moieties using the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin affects cellular sensitivity to DNA damaging drugs. Here we show that lovastatin renders cells highly resistant to the tumor-therapeutic compound doxorubicin. Desensitization by lovastatin was reverted by co-treatment with GGPP indicating that inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation is involved in acquired doxorubicin resistance. Lovastatin does not influence cellular sensitivity to DNA damaging compounds such as cisplatin, methyl methanesulfonate and ionizing radiation. The frequency of apoptotic cell death induced by doxorubicin was not affected by lovastatin as shown by both annexin V and DNA fragmentation assay. However, lovastatin releases cells from doxorubicin induced G2 blockage. Furthermore, lovastatin protects cells from doxorubicin-induced DNA strand breakage without affecting drug uptake or the expression of multidrug resistance protein (mdr-1). Since lovastatin confers cross-resistance to the topoisomerase II specific inhibitor etoposide, we suggest desensitization by the statin to be related to topoisomerase II function. The finding that lovastatin renders cells resistant to doxorubicin and etoposide by reducing their genotoxic and cytotoxic effects might have clinical implications for cancer therapy.", 
    "16": "Atorvastatin is a powerful new synthetic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor currently in clinical use. Its effects on plasma levels of factor VII were examined in 30 hyperlipidemic patients. After 12 weeks of atorvastatin treatment, factor VII activity (FVIIc) and factor VII antigen (FVIIag) levels had decreased by 13% (p < 0.0001) and 12% (p < 0.0001), respectively. The decreased concentrations of serum triglycerides correlated with decreases in FVIIc levels (r = 0.54, p = 0.0023) and FVIIag levels (r = 0.59, p = 0.0006) at 12 weeks of treatment with atorvastatin. No significant changes were seen in activated factor VII (FVIIa) levels. Plasma concentrations of fibrinogen were slightly, but not significantly, increased at 12 weeks. No significant changes were seen in plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 levels. The effects of atorvastatin on FVII may contribute to a decreased thrombotic potential, resulting in fewer thromboembolic events, including a reduction in coronary heart disease.", 
    "17": "We investigated the mechanism by which 7-ketocholesterol damages vascular smooth muscle cells and the protective effect of the hydroxymethyl glutary CoA reductase inhibitor, pravastatin on it. When 7-ketocholesterol (50 micromol/L) was added to cultured human vascular smooth muscle cells, the extent of cell detachment increased and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labeling was positive. DNA extracted from the smooth muscle cells exposed to 7-ketocholesterol showed a ladder pattern on agarose electrophoresis. The fragmented DNA also increased in smooth muscle cells incubated with 7-ketocholesterol dose-dependently. In the presence of pravastatin, the cell detachment induced by 7-ketocholesterol was inhibited and the amount of fragmented DNA decreased significantly. These effects of pravastatin were inhibited by mevalonate. The results suggest that 7-ketocholesterol-induced apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells is inhibited by pravastatin, and mevalonate acts as a trigger of the apoptosis.", 
    "18": "The effects and tolerability of the new HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor rosuvastatin were assessed in 68 hypercholesterolemic Japanese patients (22 men and 46 postmenopausal women; age range 28-72 years) in a multicenter, double-blind, dose-ranging, early phase II study. Patients were randomized into three groups and received once-daily doses of 1, 2, or 4 mg rosuvastatin. Sixty evaluable patients (19 men and 41 women) with mean total cholesterol (TC) 294 mg/dl (7.60 mmol/l) and mean triglyceride (TG) 150 mg/dl (1.69 mmol/l) provided data in the efficacy analysis based on percentage changes in lipids at 4 and 8 weeks. All doses of rosuvastatin improved lipid parameters after both 4 and 8 weeks of therapy. On average, TC decreases were 22-29%, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) decreases 32-42%, TG decreases 2% to 22%, and HDL-C increases 3-7%. There were no remarkable differences between efficacy at 4 and at 8 weeks, and dose-dependent reductions were noted for LDL-C, with 30, 39, and 42% decreases in the 1-, 2-, and 4-mg/ day dose groups, respectively, at 8 weeks. The drug was well tolerated over the 8 weeks of therapy. These preliminary results indicate that rosuvastatin is a potent cholesterol-lowering agent, capable of achieving marked reductions in LDL-C even at low doses.", 
    "19": "Blood levels of cytokines are commonly elevated in severe congestive heart failure (CHF) and in coronary artery disease (CAD). While the adverse effects of cytokines on contractile function and myocardial cell integrity are well studied, little is known on whether cardiac cells are only targets or active players in these inflammatory reactions.", 
    "20": "We tested if human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC) may become a source of cytokine and adhesion molecule expression when stimulated with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Analysis of HCAEC supernatants by ELISA identified enhanced secretion of IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 while endothelin-1 was not increased. IL-1beta, IL-10, or TNF-alpha were not detectable by ELISA while RT-PCR revealed enhanced mRNA expression of IL-1beta and TNF-alpha but not IL-10. FACS analysis showed an LPS-induced upregulation of ICAM-1, VCAM, and ELAM-1. LFA-1 could not be detected. We further characterized receptors involved in LPS-induced signaling. Our results indicate that activation of HCAEC by LPS requires Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4. Pretreating the cells with the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitor Cerivastatin reduced IL-6 release.", 
    "21": "Taken together, our results indicate that activated HCAEC may act as inflammatory cells and thus directly contribute to the progression of CHF and CAD.", 
    "22": "Patients undergoing cardiac transplantation are at increased risk of dyslipidemia (60% to 80%). Lipid-lowering treatment in these patients should be aggressive given the known role of dyslipidemia in chronic transplant rejection. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pravastatina therapy and its effect upon cyclosporine levels in a population of dyslipidemic cardiac transplant patients.A total of 20 cardiac transplant patients were enrolled in this 39-week length prospective observational study. Patients had serum cholesterol levels exceeding 200 mg/dl, and received pravastatin therapy at the adequate dose to obtain an optimal lipid profile without significant adverse effects. Pravastatin, at a mean dose of 50 18 mg/day, produced a significant reduction in total cholesterol levels (from 291 32 to 203 25 mg/dl, p < 0.05), LDL cholesterol (from 187 34 to 102 15 mg/dl, p < 0.05) and an increase in HDL-cholesterol levels (from 48 16 to 55 14, p < 0.05). A slight asymptomatic increase in CPK levels was observed but no differences in cyclosporine levels. Pravastatin has shown to be an effective and safe therapy in dyslipidemic cardiac transplant patients.", 
    "23": "The primary aims of these two single-centre, randomized, evaluator-blind, placebo/positive-controlled, parallel-group studies were to evaluate the potential for pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interaction between ezetimibe 0.25, 1, or 10 mg and simvastatin 10 mg (Study 1), and a pharmacodynamic interaction between ezetimibe 10 mg and simvastatin 20 mg (Study 2). Evaluation of the tolerance of the coadministration of ezetimibe and simvastatin was a secondary objective.", 
    "24": "Eighty-two healthy men with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) >or=130 mg dl-1 received study drug once daily in the morning for 14 days. In Study 1 (n=58), five groups of 11-12 subjects received simvastatin 10 mg alone, or with ezetimibe 0.25, 1, or 10 mg or placebo. In Study 2 (n=24), three groups of eight subjects received simvastatin 20 mg alone, ezetimibe 10 mg alone, or the combination. Blood samples were collected to measure serum lipids in both studies. Steady-state pharmacokinetics of simvastatin and its beta-hydroxy metabolite were evaluated in Study 1 only.", 
    "25": "In both studies, reported side-effects were generally mild, nonspecific, and similar among treatment groups. In Study 1, there were no indications of pharmacokinetic interactions between simvastatin and ezetimibe. All active treatments caused statistically significant (P<0.01) decreases in LDL-C concentration vs placebo from baseline to day 14. The coadministration of ezetimibe and simvastatin caused a dose-dependent reduction in LDL-C and total cholesterol, with no apparent effect on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) or triglycerides. The coadministration of ezetimibe 10 mg and simvastatin 10 mg or 20 mg caused a statistically (P<0.01) greater percentage reduction (mean -17%, 95% CI -27.7, -6.2, and -18%, -28.4, -7.4, respectively) in LDL-C than simvastatin alone.", 
    "26": "The coadministration of ezetimibe at doses up to 10 mg with simvastatin 10 or 20 mg daily was well tolerated and caused a significant additive reduction in LDL-C compared with simvastatin alone. Additional clinical studies to assess the efficacy and safety of coadministration of ezetimibe and simvastatin are warranted.", 
    "27": "The Chiba Lipid Intervention Program (CLIP) Study was designed to clarify the prognosis of Japanese hypercholesterolemic patients taking pravastatin for 5 years. Hypercholesterolemic patients (n = 2,529) with a total cholesterol level > or = 220 mg/dl and without histories of ischemic coronary heart disease and/or cerebral infarction were administered pravastatin (10-20 mg/day). Among them, 2,131 took pravastatin fully (Pravastatin-continued group), and 398 discontinued the treatment (Discontinued group). The baseline total cholesterol level was 264.3 +/- 34.7 mg/dl (mean +/- standard deviation). The mean reduction rates of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol were 18.0% and 27.2%, respectively. Mild and moderate adverse events occurred in 86 cases (3.6%). Serious adverse events were not observed. Death rates of the pravastatin-continued group and of the discontinued group were 2.6 and 16.0/1,000 persons/year, respectively. Cardiac events (fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction, cardiac death, angina pectoris) in all, occurred in 35 patients (incidence rate = 2.77/1,000 persons/year). In the pravastatin continued group, 9 causes of fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction occurred (0.84/1,000 persons/year), whereas in the discontinued group, 4 cases occurred (2.06/1,000 persons/ year). The risk ratio for cardiac events was correlated with the number of risks. In the low-risk group (< or = 1 risk), decreased rates of LDL-cholesterol were less in the cardiac event group than the non-cardiac event group (LDL-cholesterol; 16% vs 25%, p = 0.04). These results suggested the following; 1) Pravastatin maintained a cholesterol lowering effect long-term without serious complications. 2) Pravastatin administration might reduce the mortality rate and myocardial infarction. 3) The combination of multiple risks is a strong factor for a cardiac event in addition to hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "28": "For large scale follow up studies with non-demented patients in which cognition is an endpoint, there is a need for short, inexpensive, sensitive, and reliable neuropsychological tests that are suitable for repeated measurements. The commonly used Mini-Mental-State-Examination fulfils only the first two requirements.", 
    "29": "In the PROspective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk (PROSPER), 5804 elderly subjects aged 70 to 82 years were examined using a learning test (memory), a coding test (general speed), and a short version of the Stroop test (attention). Data presented here were collected at dual baseline, before randomisation for active treatment.", 
    "30": "The tests proved to be reliable (with test/retest reliabilities ranging from acceptable (r=0.63) to high (r=0.88) and sensitive to detect small differences in subjects from different age categories. All tests showed significant practice effects: performance increased from the first measurement to the first follow up after two weeks.", 
    "31": "Normative data are provided that can be used for one time neuropsychological testing as well as for assessing individual and group change. Methods for analysing cognitive change are proposed.", 
    "32": "Assessing the inducibility of CYP3A4 by various xenobiotics can predict potential drug interactions. In the present investigation, human hepatoma cells were stably integrated with either the CYP3A4 enhancer region and a luciferase reporter gene or the CYP3A4-luciferase construct and the human pregnane X receptor (PXR). Several colonies containing one to three copies of luciferase per cell were identified by Southern blot analysis. Those transformants producing high luciferase activity in response to rifampicin were used to standardize a 96-well plate screening system with minimal inter- and intraplate variability. Standardization also consisted of assessing viability of cells cultured in medium containing various serum concentrations. In cells maintained for 48 h in medium with less than 5% serum, a significant (p < 0.01) decline was observed in viability accompanied by altered induction. A defined serum-free medium also produced less viable cells but did not alter the inductive response. Treatment of transformants with various concentrations of rifampicin produced a dose-response curve with maximal induction at 10 microM (5.6 +/- 0.18- and 2.1 +/- 0.3-fold above dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-treated cells in transformants with and without PXR, respectively). Of additional agents examined for their ability to induce CYP3A4, omeprazole (200 microM) was the most potent inducer (12.8 +/- 1.9- and 2.4 +/- 0.2-fold above DMSO-treated cells in transformants with and without PXR, respectively). Mifepristone and mevastatin produced modest induction (approximately 3-fold) in the cell line containing exogenous PXR, but produced less than 1.2-fold increases in cells lacking PXR. Thus, only potent inducers can be identified in the cell line without PXR. In contrast, cells containing the receptor can be used to rank CYP3A4 induction. Because a high volume of chemicals can be readily and accurately screened for their ability to induce CYP3A4 with this format, such a system could be valuable in the initial stages of preclinical drug development.", 
    "33": "Statins, which inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase and thus the synthesis of cholesterol, are remarkably effective in the treatment of cardiovascular disease. In addition to their favorable effect on lipid profile, these drugs may also prevent the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle that is characteristic of atherosclerosis. We hypothesize that statins prevent the post-translational prenylation, and thus inhibit the function, of critical small GTPases in vascular smooth muscle cells. We have therefore assayed the effect of lovastatin on both the growth of A10 vascular smooth muscle cells and the status of their Ras and RhoB proteins. We find that < or =1 microM lovastatin potently inhibits the proliferation of A10 cultures, and higher concentrations (> or =3 microM) induce apoptosis. We have also tested the effect of 3-allylfarnesol (3-alFOH), an inhibitor of farnesyl transferase (FTI). The data show that although > or =10 microM 3-alFOH is required for a cytostatic effect, the action of 3 microM 3-alFOH can be greatly potentiated by even nanomolar levels of lovastatin. We also find that lovastatin and 3-alFOH exhibit synergism to cause the up-regulation and relocalization of RhoB from the membrane to cytosolic compartments. This relocalization of RhoB, which is presumed to reflect an inhibition of its prenylation, correlates with the proapoptotic activities of combined 3-alFOH and lovastatin treatment. These data suggest that RhoB may be a valuable pharmacological target in cardiovascular disease, and that combinations of statins and certain FTIs may be of value in treatment of disorders that are characterized by excess cell proliferation.", 
    "34": "Atorvastatin, a synthetic HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor used for the treatment of hyperlipidemia and the prevention of coronary artery disease, significantly lowers plasma cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. It also reduces total plasma triglyceride and apoE concentrations. In view of the direct involvement of apoE in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, we have investigated the effect of atorvastatin treatment (40 mg/day) on in vivo rates of plasma apoE production and catabolism in six patients with combined hyperlipidemia using a primed constant infusion of deuterated leucine. Atorvastatin treatment resulted in a significant decrease (i.e., 30-37%) in levels of total triglyceride, cholesterol, LDL-C, and apoB in all six patients. Total plasma apoE concentration was reduced from 7.4 +/- 0.9 to 4.3 +/- 0.2 mg/dl (-38 +/- 8%, P < 0.05), predominantly due to a decrease in VLDL apoE (3.4 +/- 0.8 vs. 1.7 +/- 0.2 mg/dl; -42 +/- 11%) and IDL/LDL apoE (1.9 +/- 0.3 vs. 0.8 +/- 0.1 mg/dl; -57 +/- 6%). Total plasma lipoprotein apoE transport (i.e., production) was significantly reduced from 4.67 +/- 0.39 to 3.04 +/- 0.51 mg/kg/day (-34 +/- 10%, P < 0.05) and VLDL apoE transport was reduced from 3.82 +/- 0.67 to 2.26 +/- 0.42 mg/kg/day (-36 +/- 10%, P = 0.057). Plasma and VLDL apoE residence times and HDL apoE kinetic parameters were not significantly affected by drug treatment. Percentage decreases in VLDL apoE concentration and VLDL apoE production were significantly correlated with drug-induced reductions in VLDL triglyceride concentration (r = 0.99, P < 0.001; r = 0.88, P < 0.05, respectively, n = 6). Our results demonstrate that atorvastatin causes a pronounced decrease in total plasma and VLDL apoE concentrations and a significant decrease in plasma and VLDL apoE rates of production in patients with combined hyperlipidemia.", 
    "35": "The early response of C-reactive protein to initiation of a hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin) is not known. The purpose of this study was to determine the rate at which highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels change after initiation of simvastatin and whether this occurs independently of the change in LDL cholesterol.", 
    "36": "The study was a crossover, double-blind design including 40 subjects with elevated LDL cholesterol. Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups: simvastatin 40 mg for 14 days, then placebo for 14 days, or placebo first, then simvastatin. Simvastatin decreased LDL cholesterol by 56+/-4 mg/dL (P<0.0001) at day 7 and by an additional 8+/-3 mg/dL (P=0.02) at day 14. Baseline log(hsCRP) levels were similar in the 2 groups. By day 14, log(hsCRP) was significantly lower in patients on simvastatin when compared with placebo (P=0.011). Although there was no significant difference in fibrinogen levels, simvastatin produced a modest increase in log[lipoprotein(a)] (P=0.03) at days 7 and 14. There were no relationships between the decrease in LDL cholesterol and the decrease in hsCRP.", 
    "37": "Simvastatin lowers hsCRP by 14 days, independent of its effect on LDL cholesterol. This rapid impact of a statin on hsCRP has potential implications in the management of acute coronary syndromes.", 
    "38": "The prospective placebo-controlled LIPS study (\"Lescol Intervention Prevention Study\") demonstrated a significant cardiovascular protection by fluvastatin in patients with coronary artery disease (stable or unstable angina, silent ischemia), without major hypercholesterolaemia (135-270 mg/dl) following successful completion of their first percutaneous coronary intervention. When compared to the placebo group (n = 833), the fluvastatin group (n = 844) showed a relative risk reduction by 22% (relative risk: 0.78; 95% confidence interval: 0.64-0.95; p = 0.01) of major adverse cardiac events after a median time of follow-up of 3.9 years. This effect is observed independently of baseline total cholesterol, of the presence of diabetes mellitus or the existence of multivessel disease. These results suggest that fluvastatin may favorably influence the restenosis process after percutaneous coronary intervention, even in the absence of severe hypercholesterolaemia.", 
    "39": "We investigated the effects of statin compared with the American Heart Association (AHA) Step I Diet on lipoproteins, vasomotor function, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and serological markers of plaque stability. Furthermore, we investigated the mechanism of regulation suggested by experimental studies.", 
    "40": "For 14 weeks, we administered AHA diet+placebo and AHA diet+simvastatin (20 mg daily) to 31 and 32 randomly selected patients with coronary artery disease, respectively. Compared with diet alone, simvastatin significantly improved the percent flow-mediated dilator response to hyperemia from 3.37+/-2.28% to 5.89+/-2.35% (P<0.001) and lowered plasma levels of C-reactive protein from 0.48 to 0.10 mg/dL (P<0.001), TNF-alpha from 3.38 to 2.79 pg/mL (P<0.001), total matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 from 36 to 28 ng/mL (P=0.006), and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 from 80+/-30 to 74+/-23 ng/mL (P=0.041), and simvastatin lowered to a greater extent MMP-9 activity (from 71 to 52 ng/mL, P=0.006) and MMP-9 activity/tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1 ratios (P=0.018), although this difference did not reach statistical significance. There were significant correlations between the degree of changes in TNF-alpha and the degree of changes in MMP-9 activity (r=0.424, P=0.016). However, no significant correlations between lipoprotein levels or flow-mediated dilation percentages and levels of plaque stability markers were determined (-0.208< or =r< or =0.243).",

    "42": "Some of the statin-induced reduction in cardiac events in patients with atherosclerosis may be derived from mechanisms independent of lipid lowering. This study tested in nonhuman primates whether statins can influence inflammation (indicated by vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, interleukin-1beta, tissue factor, and macrophages) and features of plaque stability (indicated by collagen and smooth muscle cells) independent of their effect on plasma cholesterol level.", 
    "43": "Adult male cynomolgus monkeys (n=12 per group) consumed an atherogenic diet for 12 months while receiving (1) no treatment (control), (2) pravastatin (Prava, 40 mg/kg per day), or (3) simvastatin (Simva, 20 mg/kg per day). Dietary cholesterol was adjusted to equalize plasma cholesterol levels among groups. Although the intima/media ratio in the abdominal aorta did not differ among groups, drug treatment reduced inflammation and features of plaque vulnerability. Macrophage content in the lesions of statin-treated animals was lowered (2.4-fold with Prava and 1.3-fold with Simva; both P<0.001 versus control). Furthermore, lesions had approximately 2-fold less vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, interleukin-1beta, and tissue factor expression in statin-treated versus control animals (P<0.005). Lesional smooth muscle cell and collagen content was 2.1-fold greater in the Prava-treated group (P<0.001) and 1.5-fold greater in the Simva-treated group (P<0.005) than in the control group.",

    "45": "Patients with type 2 diabetes are known to have abnormalities in their remnant metabolism and low density lipoprotein (LDL) subfraction pattern, with a preponderance of small dense LDL. The effects of pitavastatin, a newly synthesized 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, on lipoprotein profiles in patients with type 2 diabetes were determined. Thirty-three patients were treated with pitavastatin with a daily dose of 2 mg for 8 weeks. After treatment, triglyceride, total and LDL cholesterol were significantly reduced by 28.7 +/- 36.7%, 25.2 +/- 14.3% and 36.1 +/- 14.3%, respectively. Remnant-like particle cholesterol (RLP-C), an independent risk factor for CAD which is known to be elevated in diabetic patients, was also significantly reduced (-30.9 +/- 30.5%) by the treatment and this decrease correlated well with the decrease in triglyceride level. The proportion of small dense LDL, which is known for its atherogenisity, decreased from 29.9 +/- 26.2% to 19.7 +/- 22.7% and the mean LDL particle size significantly increased from 26.36 +/- 1.13 nm to 27.10 +/- 1.36 nm. Pitavastatin, which is known to improve triglyceride levels and cholesterol levels, also improves RLP-C level and LDL subfraction profiles, and this in turn may reduce the cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia.", 
    "46": "The renin-angiotensin system (RAS) and dyslipidaemia have been shown to be involved in the genesis and progression of atherosclerosis. Manipulation of the RAS has been effective in modifying human coronary artery disease progression. Similarly, the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors or statins have been shown to reduce cholesterol and lower cardiovascular events in primary and secondary prevention trials in coronary artery disease. In addition to their primary mode of action, statins and blockers of the RAS possess common additional properties that include restoration of endothelial activity and inhibition of cellular proliferation. This article reviews the current data on the common properties of these classes of drugs in which the beneficial effects extend beyond their antihypertensive and lipid-lowering properties.", 
    "47": "Gibberellins (GAs) are diterpene plant hormones essential for many developmental processes. Although the GA biosynthesis pathway has been well studied, our knowledge on its early stage is still limited. There are two possible routes for the biosynthesis of isoprenoids leading to GAs, the mevalonate (MVA) pathway in the cytosol and the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway in plastids. To distinguish these possibilities, metabolites from each isoprenoid pathway were selectively labeled with (13)C in Arabidopsis seedlings. Efficient (13)C-labeling was achieved by blocking the endogenous pathway chemically or genetically during the feed of a (13)C-labeled precursor specific to the MVA or MEP pathways. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses demonstrated that both MVA and MEP pathways can contribute to the biosyntheses of GAs and campesterol, a cytosolic sterol, in Arabidopsis seedlings. While GAs are predominantly synthesized through the MEP pathway, the MVA pathway plays a major role in the biosynthesis of campesterol. Consistent with some crossover between the two pathways, phenotypic defects caused by the block of the MVA and MEP pathways were partially rescued by exogenous application of the MEP and MVA precursors, respectively. We also provide evidence to suggest that the MVA pathway still contributes to GA biosynthesis when this pathway is limiting.", 
    "48": "When sphingomyelin is digested by sphingomyelinase in the plasma membrane of rat astrocytes, productions of sphingomyelin, diacylglycerol, and phosphatidylcholine are stimulated. D609, an inhibitor of phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C, suppressed these effects. Similarly, when apolipoprotein A-I removed cellular cholesterol, phosphatidylcholine, and sphingomyelin to generate high density lipoprotein, cholesterol synthesis from acetate subsequently increased, and sphingomyelin synthesis from acetate and serine also increased. D609 inhibited these effects again. D609 also inhibited the cholesterol removal by apoA-I not only from the astrocytes but also from BALB/3T3 and RAW264 cells. D609 decreased cholesterol synthesis, although D609 did not directly inhibit hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase. ApoA-I-stimulated translocation of newly synthesized cholesterol to cytosol was also decreased by D609. A diacylglycerol analog increased the apoA-I-mediated cholesterol release, whereas ceramide did not influence it. We concluded that removal of cellular sphingomyelin by apolipoproteins is replenished by transfer of phosphorylcholine from phosphatidylcholine to ceramide, and this reaction may limit the removal of cholesterol by apoA-I. This reaction also produces diacylglycerol that potentially triggers subsequent cellular signal cascades and regulates intracellular cholesterol trafficking.", 
    "49": "Large-scale clinical trials have demonstrated significant reductions in cardiovascular events following statin therapy. The observed benefit of statin therapy, however, may be greater in these trials than is to be expected from lowering lipid levels alone. In order to clarify the mechanism by which statins prevent cardiovascular events in vascular wall cells, we investigated the changes in gene expression profiles after incubation with atorvastatin or pitavastatin in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells using DNA microarrays. Statins affected the expression levels of genes involved in inflammation, coagulation, and vascular constriction. The mRNA levels for interleukin-8 (IL-8) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) decreased after statin treatment. Statins reduced mRNA levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and increased the mRNA levels of thrombomodulin. Statins reduced the mRNA levels of endothelin-1 and increased the mRNA levels of nitric oxide synthase-3 (eNOS). These results show that, statins are clinically effective because of their ability to change the gene expression profile of endothelial cells thereby preventing vascular events.", 
    "50": "To get some insight into the regulatory mechanisms controlling the sterol branch of the mevalonate pathway, tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv Bright Yellow-2) cell suspensions were treated with squalestatin-1 and terbinafine, two specific inhibitors of squalene synthase (SQS) and squalene epoxidase, respectively. These two enzymes catalyze the first two steps involved in sterol biosynthesis. In highly dividing cells, SQS was actively expressed concomitantly with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and both sterol methyltransferases. At nanomolar concentrations, squalestatin was found to inhibit efficiently sterol biosynthesis as attested by the rapid decrease in SQS activity and [(14)C]radioactivity from acetate incorporated into sterols. A parallel dose-dependent accumulation of farnesol, the dephosphorylated form of the SQS substrate, was observed without affecting farnesyl diphosphate synthase steady-state mRNA levels. Treatment of tobacco cells with terbinafine is also shown to inhibit sterol synthesis. In addition, this inhibitor induced an impressive accumulation of squalene and a dose-dependent stimulation of the triacylglycerol content and synthesis, suggesting the occurrence of regulatory relationships between sterol and triacylglycerol biosynthetic pathways. We demonstrate that squalene was stored in cytosolic lipid particles, but could be redirected toward sterol synthesis if required. Inhibition of either SQS or squalene epoxidase was found to trigger a severalfold increase in enzyme activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, giving first evidence for a positive feedback regulation of this key enzyme in response to a selective depletion of endogenous sterols. At the same time, no compensatory responses mediated by SQS were observed, in sharp contrast to the situation in mammalian cells.",

    "57": "Evidence suggests that the inhibition of both acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase and hydroxymethyl glutaryl-CoA reductase causes a synergistic direct antiatherosclerotic effect on the vessel wall. To investigate this synergism in a single cell type and to avoid the confounding effect of plasma cholesterol lowering by these drugs, we have used an in vitro model of human macrophages (phorbol ester-treated THP-1 cells). In macrophages incubated simultaneously with acetyl low-density lipoproteins, the novel acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase inhibitor avasimibe (0.01-0.5 microM) caused a concentration-dependent reduction in cell cholesteryl ester content that was not accompanied by an increase in intracellular free cholesterol. A 5 microM concentration of atorvastatin enhanced by approximately twofold the ability of 0.5 microM avasimibe to reduce the mass of esterified cholesterol, and this was reversed by co-incubation with 200 microM mevalonate or 10 microM geranyl-geraniol. Based on these data, we propose that the synergism between acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase and hydroxymethyl glutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors found in several in vivo studies may be explained by a direct additive effect of both agents reducing the lipid content of the macrophages present in the lesion area.", 
    "58": "Exposure of blood to tissue factor (TF) sets off the coagulation cascade. TF is a transmembrane protein that serves as an essential cofactor for activated coagulation factor VII (FVIIa). TF may be exposed locally by vascular injury (such as balloon angioplasty) or by spontaneous rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque. Expression of TF may also be induced on monocytes and endothelial cells in conditions like sepsis and cancer, causing a more generalised activation of clotting. TF may thus play a central role in thrombosis in a number of settings, and attention has turned to blocking TF as a means to prevent thrombosis. Inhibiting the inducible expression of TF by monocytes can be achieved by 'deactivating' cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-4, -10 and -13, or by certain prostanoids; by drugs that modify signal transduction, such as pentoxifylline, retinoic acid or vitamin D(3), or by antisense oligonucleotides. Such approaches are for the most part at a preclinical stage. The function of TF can be blocked by antibodies that prevent the binding of FVIIa to TF; by active site-inhibited FVIIa, which competes with native FVIIa for binding; by antibodies or small molecules that block the function of the TF/FVIIa complex; and by molecules, such as TF pathway inhibitor or nematode anticoagulant peptide C2, which inhibit the active site of FVIIa in the TF/FVIIa complex after first binding to activated factor X. The latter two agents have entered Phase II clinical trials. Perhaps most intriguing is the use of anti-TF agents locally, which holds the promise of stopping thrombosis at a specific site of injury without the bleeding risk associated with systemic anticoagulation.",

These patients belonged to the cohort of the Pravastatin Turkish Trial (PTT). Forty of them were assigned randomly to have immediate pravastatin (40 mg/day) therapy adjunctive to thrombolytic therapy regardless of serum lipid levels and received statin treatment throughout the study. Lipid levels were determined immediately after admission and before angioplasty and at the end of 6 months. Patients were re-evaluated clinically and angiographically for cardiovascular adverse events and restenosis after a 6-month follow-up period. The baseline angiographic and clinical characteristics of the two groups were similar. The incidence of angina was significantly lower in the pravastatin group (30.0%, 12 patients) compared to the control group (59.5%, 22 patients) (p = 0.018). The cumulative major adverse cardiac events in the pravastatin group were significantly lower when compared to the control group (32.5% vs. 75.6%, p = 0.0001).",

A number of landmark primary and secondary prevention trials have demonstrated that lipid-lowering therapy with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), and antihypertensive therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and calcium channel blockers (CCBs), reduce CHD risk in the non-diabetic population. However, many questions remain unanswered about the use of these therapies in patients with type 2 diabetes. To address the most important of these questions, several major trials are under way that will provide more data on the benefits of lipid-lowering and antihypertensive therapy in type 2 diabetes. These include studies of atorvastatin, an established member of the statin class, with over 22 million patient-years' experience and an excellent safety profile. Similarly, the Antihypertensive and Lipid Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) and the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT) will determine the efficacy of the CCB, amlodipine, in patients with concomitant type 2 diabetes and hypertension.",

Hyperhomocysteinemia is common in patients with chronic renal failure. Kidney transplant recipients have a high risk of cardiovascular death. Recently, attention has been paid to the association between homocysteine and cardiovascular disease. Dyslipidemia is also common in kidney transplant recipients. The purpose of this study was to assess whether fluvastatin in a dose of 20 mg affects homocysteine concentration in 10 stable renal transplant recipients. We evaluated Hcy, lipoprotein (a) by the use of commercially available kits as well as plasma fibrinogen and cholesterol, triglycerides and albumin levels. All the parameters were studied before and after 1, 2 and 3 months of fluvastatin treatment. Cholesterol and LDL decreased significantly as early as after 1 month and remained lowered during the therapy. No significant changes in Hcy, lipoprotein (a) and fibrinogen were found during therapy with fluvastatin. Fluvastatin is an effective hypolipemic agent and has no effect on Hcy and fibrinogen concentration in kidney transplant recipients.", 
    "71": "Research is an evolutionary process and being complicated, time-consuming and costly one whose end result is never known at the outset. Discovering a new drug has been likened to searching for the proverbial needle in a haystack. In test tube experiments called assays, compounds are added one at a time to enzymes, cell cultures or cellular substances grown in a laboratory. In the search for a new cholesterol drug, scientists found a fungus that inhibited the HMG-CoA reductase enzyme in a test tube. Chemists then had to identify which of the fungus' dozens of chemical by-products was actually inhibiting the enzyme. Once that was done, the chemical's structure was analysed and improved on to enhance its effects. Research has aimed at discovering what a drug does to the body. If a drug's active ingredients don't get into the blood, it won't work. In research one has to know when to cut losses if one goes down a wrong way. The role of FDA in the early stages of drug research is little. FDA first becomes involved when a drug company has completed its testing in animals and is ready to test a drug on humans.

Treatment of hypercholesterolemia and other vascular risk factors may have great implications in the prevention of AD. Recent findings illustrate that the sterol metabolism in the brain is an active process, well controlled and regulated by 24-hydroxylase, an enzyme that is uniquely expressed in the brain. The use of statins in ischemic heart disease (IHD) has proven to be a phenomenal advance in pharmacological disease prevention and treatment. A growing body of evidence, suggest that statins exhibit additional benefits that are independent of their cholesterol-lowering actions. Statin treatment has also considerable effect in prevention of ischemic stroke. In animal models of ischemic stroke, statins have proven to reduce infarct size through up-regulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthases. Data from recent observational studies have revealed a potential role for statins in prevention of AD. The following review comments the processes leading to dementia including the involvement of cholesterol regulation, cerebral circulation and inflammation in development of dementia. The mechanisms by which statins may be beneficial in controlling these processes is discussed.", 
    "77": "HMG Co-A reductase inhibitors(statins) have been shown, in three large randomized trials, to decrease adverse cardiac events in patients with clinically evident coronary artery disease. All of these trials have excluded patients with an acute coronary syndrome within the three months prior to enrollment. Statin therapy is thought to stabilize coronary plaque and decrease the risk of plaque rupture. Statins have been shown to quickly reduce levels of LDL-C in addition to altering systemic inflammatory responses, improving endothelial function, and reducing platelet aggregation and activation. These mechanisms are potentially beneficial in the setting of acute coronary syndromes, a time of profound plaque instability. There is a growing body of evidence supporting the early initiation of statin therapy in the setting of acute coronary syndromes.

    "78": "Micronised fenofibrate is a synthetic phenoxy-isobutyric acid derivative (fibric acid derivative) indicated for the treatment of dyslipidaemia. Recently, a new tablet formulation of micronised fenofibrate has become available with greater bioavailability than the older capsule formulation. The micronised fenofibrate 160mg tablet is bioequivalent to the 200mg capsule. The lipid-modifying profile of micronised fenofibrate 160mg (tablet) or 200mg (capsule) once daily is characterised by a decrease in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and total cholesterol (TC) levels, a marked reduction in plasma triglyceride (TG) levels and an increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. Micronised fenofibrate 200mg (capsule) once daily produced greater improvements in TG and, generally, in HDL-C levels than the hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors simvastatin 10 or 20 mg/day, pravastatin 20 mg/day or atorvastatin 10 or 40 mg/day. Combination therapy with micronised fenofibrate 200mg (capsule) once daily plus fluvastatin 20 or 40 mg/day or atorvastatin 40 mg/day was associated with greater reductions from baseline than micronised fenofibrate alone in TC and LDL-C levels. Similar or greater changes in HDL-C and TG levels were seen in combination therapy, compared with monotherapy, recipients. Micronised fenofibrate 200mg (capsule) once daily was associated with significantly greater improvements from baseline in TC, LDL-C, HDL-C and TG levels than placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus enrolled in the double-blind, randomised Diabetes Atherosclerosis Intervention Study (DAIS) [> or =3 years follow-up]. Moreover, angiography showed micronised fenofibrate was associated with significantly less progression of coronary atherosclerosis than placebo. Micronised fenofibrate has also shown efficacy in patients with metabolic syndrome, patients with HIV infection and protease inhibitor-induced hypertriglyceridaemia and patients with dyslipidaemia secondary to heart transplantation. Micronised fenofibrate was generally well tolerated in clinical trials. The results of a large (n = 9884) 12-week study indicated that gastrointestinal disorders are the most frequent adverse events associated with micronised fenofibrate therapy. Elevations in serum transaminase and creatine phosphokinase levels have been reported rarely with micronised fenofibrate. In conclusion, micronised fenofibrate improves lipid levels in patients with primary dyslipidaemia; the drug has particular efficacy with regards to reducing TG levels and raising HDL-C levels. Micronised fenofibrate is also effective in diabetic dyslipidaemia; as well as improving lipid levels, the drug reduced progression of coronary atherosclerosis in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The results of large ongoing studies (e.g. FIELD with approximately 10 000 patients) will clarify whether the beneficial lipid-modifying effects of micronised fenofibrate result in a reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.", 
    "79": "Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that hypercholsterolemia is a significant risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The mechanism by which increased cholesterol may contribute to AD is unknown. However, as the generation and accumulation of the amyloid Abeta peptide in the brain appears to be significant for the initiation and progression of AD, it is possible that cholesterol levels can regulate Abeta formation and/or clearance. To test the effects of altering cholesterol on Abeta formation, we incubated cells in the presence of lipid depleted serum, with or without the active metabolite of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin. After confirming that cholesterol was depleted in the cells, we then measured the fraction of Abeta formed from its precursor betaPP under each condition. We observed that cholesterol depletion led to a profound decrease in the levels of Abeta released from the cells. This effect of lovastatin acid was observed at concentrations of 0.05-5 &mgr;M, ranges where this compound is effective at inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, thereby inhibiting cholesterol synthesis. In contrast, the release of an additional AbetaPP fragment, AbetaPPs, was only modestly reduced by cholesterol treatment. In further studies, we determined that the decreased release of Abeta was not due to its accumulation in the cell, but rather due to decreased formation of Abeta. Finally, we were able to exclude decreased maturation (glycosylation and sulfation) of newly synthesized AbetaPP as a cause for the effects of lovastatin acid on betaPP processing and Abeta formation. Our results demonstrate that reducing cellular cholesterol by the use of an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor regulates Abeta formation. This effect may involve alterations in the trafficking of AbetaPP and/or alterations in the activity of the proteases that cleave AbetaPP. The results suggest a mechanism by which hypercholesterolemia may increase risk for AD and indicate that reduction in cholesterol may delay the onset and/or slow the progression of AD.", 
    "80": "Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death in the industrialized world. Recent laboratory and clinical studies have shown that inflammation plays a pivotal role in the inception, progression, and destabilization of atheromas. The acute-phase reactant C-reactive protein (CRP) has been shown to reflect systemic and, perhaps, vascular inflammation and to predict future cardiovascular events in asymptomatic individuals. The relative risk associated with CRP is independent of other cardiovascular disease risk factors. High-sensitivity assays (hs-CRP) are needed for the measurement of CRP concentration for the purpose of predicting the risk of future coronary events. Available assays must be standardized because patients' results will be interpreted using population-based cutpoints. An algorithm for risk stratification incorporating hs-CRP and total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio has been developed. Statin class drugs and aspirin appear to modulate CHD risk in those with increased hs-CRP concentration. Several prospective studies are now underway to specifically develop novel clinical utilities and therapeutic strategies for hs-CRP.", 
    "81": "The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) exert numerous cellular effects through the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis. The objectives of these experiments were to determine the following: (1) whether lovastatin (LOV) inhibits phenylephrine (PE)-induced growth of neonatal rat cardiac myocytes without inducing cytotoxicity and (2) whether growth-inhibiting effects of LOV are associated with reduced PE activation of extracellular signal regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK 1/2). After 48 h of exposure, LOV alone (0.1-10 microM) inhibited 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5- diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) reduction without significant changes in propidium iodide staining, and 100 microM mevalonic acid prevented the effect of LOV on MTT reduction. PE (50 or 100-microM for 48 h) induced significant increases in protein-to-DNA ratios. PE (100 microM for 5 min) significantly increased the phosphorylated forms of ERK 1 and ERK 2 and activity of ERK. After 24 h pretreatment or 48 h cotreatment, LOV (10 microM) significantly inhibited PE-induced growth. In addition, LOV pretreatment significantly inhibited the stimulatory effect of PE on ERK 2 phosphorylation and ERK activity. These results demonstrate that LOV, at concentrations that do not alter membrane integrity, inhibits PE-induced growth of cardiac myocytes, potentially through reduced activation of ERK 1/2.", 
    "82": "To characterize the coordinate regulation of cholesterol metabolism in human liver, we simultaneously quantified mRNA levels of cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR), and low- density lipoprotein receptors (LDLRs) in liver biopsies from 76 patients undergoing cholecystectomy. The three transcript levels were not different between untreated gallstone and gallstone-free patients and not significantly altered by 10-d exclusion of dietary cholesterol. Treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid suppressed CYP7A1 and to a lesser extent HMGR mRNA levels. Cholestyramine treatment increased CYP7A1, but also HMGR and LDLR mRNA, and statins only increased HMGR mRNA. Resin + statin treatment increased all mRNA species. In untreated patients, the mRNA levels of HMGR and LDLR were more strongly correlated (r = +0.60) than those of CYP7A1 and HMGR (r = +0.49) or CYP7A1 and LDLR (r = +0.21). In the treated patients, in whom bile acid synthesis was suppressed or stimulated, mRNA levels of CYP7A1 and HMGR (r = +0.84) as well as CYP7A1 and LDLR (r = +0.62) were more strongly correlated than those of HMGR and LDLR (r = +0.59). The coordinate control of HMGR and LDLR mRNA levels reflects their common regulation by shared transcriptional activation. In contrast, following changes in bile acid flux through the liver, CYP7A1 gene expression becomes a strong modulator of hepatic cholesterol metabolism.", 
    "83": "Disease-modifying therapies are being developed for Alzheimer's disease (AD). These are expected to slow the clinical progression of the disease or delay its onset. Cerebral accumulation of amyloid beta (A beta) peptides is an early and perhaps necessary event for establishing AD pathology. Consequently therapies aimed at attenuating brain amyloidosis are expected to be disease modifying. Based on the epidemiological evidence pointing to a link between cholesterol metabolism and AD and the numerous laboratory studies implicating cholesterol in the process of A beta production and accumulation, it is now believed that cholesterol-lowering therapies will be of value as disease modifying agents. Several epidemiological studies revealed that statin use for the treatment of coronary arterial disease is associated with a decreased prevalence or a decreased risk of developing AD. These observations require both preclinical and clinical validation. The former involves testing statins in one or more animal models of AD in order to establish which disease features are affected by statin treatment, the relative efficacy with which different statins modify these features and the mechanism(s) by which statins affect AD phenotypes. The latter requires prospective, randomized, placebo controlled trials to evaluate the effect of statin treatment on cognitive and AD biomarker outcomes. We have initiated a study aimed at determining the effects of atorvastatin (Lipitor), a statin with the largest US market share, on brain A beta deposition in the PSAPP transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's amyloidosis. Our results indicate that Lipitor treatment markedly attenuates A beta deposition in this animal model.", 
    "84": "The therapeutic effects of simvastatin on hyperlipidemia and its protective effects on residual renal function (RRF) in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients with hyperlipidemia were observed. Forty-seven CAPD patients were randomly divided into two groups, the treatment group and control group. The treatments of two groups were the same except that the treatment group patients were additionally given simvastatin 20 mg.d-1. The results were that, after 12-week treatment, the total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low density lipoprotein (LDL), and apoprotein B100 (ApoB100) in the treatment group significantly decreased, but high density lipoprotein (HDL) and apoprotein A1 (ApoA1) significantly increased compared with the control group (all P < 0.05); one year later, RRF of patients of both groups all decreased but there was no significant difference between them. The results suggest that simvastatin can effectively normalize lipidemia, but has no protective effect on RRF in CAPD patients.",

Rosuvastatin 10 mghas also been shown to have superior LDL reductions to 20 mg of both simvastatin and pravastatin. This agent can raise high-density lipoprotein (HDL) 8% to 12% and lower triglycerides by 10% to 35%. Rosuvastatin is a hydrophilic agent with poor penetration in extrahepatic tissue such as human umbilical vein endothelial cells and fibroblasts. It also has a low potential for cytochrome P450 drug interactions and can be dosed in the morning or night. In conclusion, rosuvastatin is an agent with molecular alterations that provide it with unique pharmacologic and phannacokinetic effects. As such, it is a novel and unique HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor for the treatment of hyperlipidemia.", 
    "86": "Postprandial hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycemia are considered risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Evidence suggests that postprandial hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycemia induce endothelial dysfunction through oxidative stress; however, the distinct role of these two factors is a matter of debate.", 
    "87": "Thirty type 2 diabetic patients and 20 normal subjects ate 3 different meals: a high-fat meal; 75 g glucose alone; and high-fat meal plus glucose. Glycemia, triglyceridemia, nitrotyrosine, and endothelial function were assayed during the tests. Subsequently, diabetics took 40 mg/d simvastatin or placebo for 12 weeks. The 3 tests were performed again at baseline, between 3 to 6 days after the start, and at the end of each study. High-fat load and glucose alone produced a decrease of endothelial function and an increase of nitrotyrosine in normal and diabetic subjects. These effects were more pronounced when high fat and glucose were combined. Short-term simvastatin treatment had no effect on lipid parameters but reduced the effect on endothelial function and nitrotyrosine observed during each different test. Long-term simvastatin treatment was accompanied by a lower increase in postprandial triglycerides, which was followed by smaller variations of endothelial function and nitrotyrosine during the tests.", 
    "88": "This study shows an independent and cumulative effect of postprandial hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycemia on endothelial function, suggesting oxidative stress as common mediator of such effect. Simvastatin shows a beneficial effect on oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction, which may be ascribed to a direct effect as well as the lipid-lowering action of the drug.",

    "90": "Eight thousand, four hundred nine consecutive non- acute myocardial infarction patients with successful PCI and no emergency surgery or Q-wave myocardial infarction were followed for 38+/-25 months; 1446 (17.2%) had post-PCI CK-MB above normal on routine ascertainment. Patients were prospectively stratified into those with CK-MB 1 to 5x or CK-MB >5x normal. No patient with CK-MB 1 to 5x normal died during the first week after PCI, and excess risk of early death for patients with CK-MB elevation occurred primarily in the first 3 to 4 months. The actuarial 4-month risk of death was 8.9%, 1.9%, and 1.2% for patients with CK-MB >5x, CK-MB 1 to 5x, and CK-MB < or =1x normal (P<0.001). Death within 4 months was independently correlated with the degree of CK-MB elevation, creatinine > or =2 mg%, post-PCI C-reactive protein, low ejection fraction, age, and congestive heart failure class (P<0.01 for all). In a matched subset analysis, incomplete revascularization (P<0.001), congestive heart failure class (P=0.005), and no statin treatment at hospital discharge (P=0.009) were associated with death.", 
    "91": "Patients with CK-MB elevation after PCI are at excess risk of death for 3 to 4 months, although prolonging hospitalization for CK-MB 1 to 5x is unlikely to modify risk. CK-MB >5x normal, incomplete revascularization, elevated C-reactive protein, heart failure, the elderly, and hospital discharge without on statin therapy increases risk. Several of these factors suggest that inflammation may play a part in the excess risk of death.", 
    "92": "Inflammatory markers have been demonstrated to be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular events. In this setting, C-reactive protein (CRP) was shown to add predictive value to cholesterol levels. We investigated hypercholesterolemic patients and related their inflammatory variables and their coagulation state focusing on factor VII, a coagulation protein which plays an established role in thrombogenesis. We examined the relationship between factor VII clotting activity (FVIIc), FVII antigen (FVIIAg) and activated FVII (FVIIa) levels against CRP, interleukin-6 soluble receptor (IL-6sR), P-selectin, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and transforming growth factor-beta(1) (TGF-beta(1)), in fifty-eight hypercholesterolemic subjects. Patients were subjected to 6-8 weeks of lipid lowering treatment with diet or diet plus pravastatin (40 mg/day). Univariate analysis showed that FVII levels were positively associated with CRP (FVIIAg: r=0.56, P<0.0001; FVIIc: r=0.57, P<0.0001; FVIIa: r=0.39, P<0.001) and IL-6sR (FVIIAg: r=0.59, P<0.0001; FVIIc: r=0.52, P<0.0001; FVIIa: r=0.47; P<0.001). CRP was still correlated, at the baseline, with FVIIAg and FVIIc levels after multiple stepwise regression analysis (FVIIAg: P<0.0001; FVIIc: P<0.0001, respectively) and with FVIIAg at the end of lipid lowering treatment (P<0.0001). Our data indicate that the FVII level is independently associated with inflammatory variables and suggest their pathophysiological link in hypercholesterolemic patients.", 
    "93": "Animal and human studies have shown that the biosynthesis of cholesterol exhibits diurnal periodicity with nocturnal increases in the level of cholesterol precursors. Dietary cholesterol, which increases the intracellular pool of cholesterol and plasma cholesterol levels, has been shown to blunt the nocturnal increases in cholesterol biosynthesis. Patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) have very high levels of plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) due to their reduced ability to metabolize LDL particles. The present studies were carried out to determine whether diurnal variations in cholesterol synthesis occur in FH patients and to test the effects of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl CoA (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors on the diurnal cycle of cholesterol biosynthesis in these patients. Diurnal rates of cholesterol synthesis were assessed by measuring the plasma concentrations of mevalonate, an intermediate in the pathway of cholesterol biosynthesis. Female FH patients exhibited a diurnal pattern in plasma mevalonate levels similar to that previously reported in controls with peak values occurring at night. Treatment with lovastatin and simvastatin (40 mg b.i.d.) significantly reduced 24-h mean plasma mevalonate levels from baseline values. Administration of lovastatin in the evening reduced the nocturnal increases in mevalonate levels, and the administration of simvastatin completely abolished the nighttime rise. These results demonstrate that inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis by lovastatin and simvastatin modifies the normal diurnal rhythm of cholesterol biosynthesis in female FH patients.", 
    "94": "Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is a potent chemotactic factor that has been implicated in atherogenesis. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) may reduce the cardiovascular risk and vulnerability of atherosclerotic plaque through nonlipid mechanisms such as inhibition of cytokine expression. In this study, we investigated the effects of statins on IL-8 synthesis in human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Addition of angiotensin II (Ang II) increased IL-8 production in VSMCs in a time (0-24 h)- and dose (10(-8)-10(-6) mol/l)-dependent manner with increased IL-8 mRNA accumulation. The Ang II type 1 receptor (AT1R) antagonist candesartan, but not the Ang II type 2 receptor (AT2R) antagonist PD123319, significantly blocked Ang II-induced IL-8 production. Addition of fluvastatin decreased the basal and Ang II-induced IL-8 production in VSMCs in a dose (10(-8)-10(-5) mol/l)-dependent manner with a decrease in IL-8 mRNA accumulation. The effect of fluvastatin on IL-8 production was completely reversed in the presence of mevalonate or geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate, but not in the presence of squalene or farnesyl-pyrophosphate. Lipophilic cerivastatin also significantly decreased IL-8 production, while hydrophilic pravastatin showed no effect on IL-8 levels. In conclusion, we demonstrated for the first time that Ang II increased IL-8 production and fluvastatin decreased the basal and Ang II-induced IL-8 production in human VSMCs. These findings suggested that Ang II may exacerbate atherosclerosis through induction of IL-8 in VSMCs, while statins may exert therapeutic effects by modulating IL-8 synthesis in patients with atherosclerotic disease.", 
    "95": "Many of the wide-ranging health benefits conferred by statin therapy are mediated, not by reductions in LDL cholesterol, but rather by inhibition of isoprenylation reactions essential to the activation of Rho family GTPases; this may be the mechanism primarily responsible for the favorable impact of statins on risk for ischemic stroke, senile dementia, and fractures, as well as the anti-hypertensive and platelet-stabilizing actions of these drugs. Indeed, the extent of these benefits is such as to suggest that most adults would be wise to take statins; however, owing to the significant expense of statin therapy, as well as to the potential for dangerous side effects that mandates regular physician follow-up, this strategy appears impractical. However, policosanol, a mixture of long-chain aliphatic alcohols extractable from sugar cane wax, has shown cholesterol-lowering potency comparable to that of statins, and yet appears to be devoid of toxic risk. Recent evidence indicates that policosanol down-regulates cellular expression of HMG-CoA reductase, and thus has the potential to suppress isoprenylation reactions much like statins do. Consistent with this possibility, the results of certain clinical and animal studies demonstrate that policosanol has many effects analogous to those of statins that are not likely explained by reductions of LDL cholesterol. However, unlike statins, policosanol does not directly inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, and even in high concentrations it fails to down-regulate this enzyme by more than 50% - thus likely accounting for the safety of this nutraceutical. In light of the fact that policosanol is quite inexpensive and is becoming available as a non-prescription dietary supplement, it may represent a practical resource that could enable the general public to enjoy health benefits comparable to those conferred by statins. In a long-term clinical study enrolling patients with significant symptomatic coronary disease, Esselstyn has demonstrated that a low-fat, whole-food vegan diet, coupled with sufficient statin therapy to maintain serum cholesterol below 150 mg/dL, can stop the progression of coronary disease and virtually eliminate further risk for heart attack. A comparable regimen, in which policosanol is used in place of statins, may represent a practical strategy whereby nearly everyone willing to commit to health-protective eating can either prevent coronary disease, or prevent pre-existing coronary disease from progressing to a life-threatening event.", 
    "96": "1. The aims of the present study were, first, to determine whether, in the genetically hypertensive (GH) rat, fluvastatin would lower blood pressure and remodel mesenteric resistance arteries (MRA) and the basilar artery and, second, to see whether treatment with a combination of fluvastatin and the angiotensin receptor antagonist valsartan would have any extra beneficial effect on blood pressure and vascular remodelling. 2. Male GH rats had tail-cuff systolic blood pressure (SBP) monitored weekly from the age of 7 to 12 weeks. Groups (n = 12-14) were treated with fluvastatin (4 mg/kg per day), valsartan (5 mg/kg per day), both mixed in with chow, or a combination of fluvastatin 4 mg/kg per day + valsartan 5 mg/kg per day. Untreated GH and a group of normotensive Wistar (N) rats served as control groups. 3. At 12 weeks of age, intra-arterial (i.a.) blood pressure was measured by femoral cannulation and rats were then perfused (at the SBP of the animal) with Tyrode's solution containing heparin and papaverine followed by 2.5% glutaraldehyde in Tyrode's solution; MRA and basilar arteries were embedded in Technovit. Serial sections were cut and Giemsa stained and stereological methods used to obtain media width, lumen diameter, medial cross-sectional area (CSA) and the ratio of media width to lumen diameter. Hearts were weighed to determine left ventricular (LV) mass. 4. Fluvastatin had no effect on blood pressure or LV mass, whereas valsartan given alone or with fluvastatin significantly reduced both parameters. 5. In MRA, fluvastatin reduced medial CSA, increased lumen size and, therefore, probably decreased vascular resistance. The media/lumen ratio was reduced to a level below that seen with the combination treatment and to below that of the N group. 6. In the basilar artery, fluvastatin and valsartan showed similar outward remodelling of the lumen and reduction in the media/lumen ratio. The combination treatment group showed, in addition, a reduction in medial CSA and an even lower ratio than the GH group on fluvastatin or valsartan alone or the N group. 7. Although fluvastatin has no effect on blood pressure, it does cause significant remodelling of MRA and the basilar artery. These beneficial structural changes in a peripheral resistance artery bed and in an artery involved in regulating resistance in the brain are worthy of further study.", 
    "97": "Elevated triglycerides and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels are more important coronary risk factors in women, and elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels less important in women, than men. There is clear-cut evidence in clinical trials that the benefit of cholesterol lowering in women and men is virtually identical. Modifiers of lipids and lipoproteins in women include diabetes mellitus, bodyweight and its distribution, and menopausal status. Diabetes is a more powerful predictor of risk in women than men. This may relate to the importance of elevated triglycerides as a risk factor in women, and to the effects of lipoprotein glycosylation, which lead to increased susceptibility to arterial deposition of LDL and decreased reverse cholesterol transport with HDL. Therapy for lipoprotein disorders in women and men is identical. For the overwhelming majority of patients, treatment with statin therapy is both highly efficacious and well tolerated.", 
    "98": "In a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study, we investigated whether statins alter cholesterol metabolites and reduce Abeta levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of 44 patients with Alzheimer's disease. Individuals were given up to 80mg simvastatin daily or placebo for 26 weeks. Overall, simvastatin did not significantly alter cerebrospinal fluid levels of Abeta40 and Abeta42. In post hoc analysis, simvastatin significantly decreased Abeta40 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with mild Alzheimer's disease. The reduction of Abeta40 correlated with the reduction of 24S-hydroxycholesterol. These changes were not observed in more severely affected patients.", 
    "99": "We compared the effects of five different statins (atorvastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, lovastatin, and fluvastatin) on the lipid, lipoprotein, and apolipoprotein (apo) A-I-containing high-density lipoprotein (HDL) subpopulation profiles of 86 coronary heart disease (CHD) patients. Patients with established CHD, and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (C)>130 mg/dl, and triglyceride (TG)<400 mg/dl, were treated with atorvastatin 20, 40, and 80 mg/day and one of the other four statins at 20, 40, and when available 80 mg/day in increasing doses (4 weeks of each dose) in a randomized crossover fashion. There was an 8-week placebo controlled washout period between different drug treatments. All five statins on each dose resulted in significant reductions in total- and LDL-C compared to placebo treatment. There were also decreases in plasma TG and increases in HDL-C and apoA-I concentrations, but not all treatments changed these parameters significantly. Each statin except fluvastatin improved the HDL subpopulation profile by increasing the concentrations of the large, cholesterol-rich, LpA-I alpha-1 and prealpha-1 HDL subpopulations. CHD patients have significantly lower concentration of the large, LpA-I alpha-1 HDL particles compared to controls. Our data indicate that statins which are the most effective in lowering LDL-C and TG are also the most effective agents in modifying the HDL subpopulation profile in CHD patients towards the patterns found in healthy individuals. The order of efficacy of statins in increasing alpha-1 HDL subpopulation was: atorvastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, lovastatin and fluvastatin.", 
    "100": "Statins decrease low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and additionally, reduce triglycerides (TG) and raise high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. This study evaluated the frequency of abnormal TG and HDL-C levels in patients with classical familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and assessed therapeutic response at different baseline levels of these lipoproteins after 1 year of statin therapy. A total of 508 FH patients were included and mean LDL-C levels (8.37+/-2.12 mmol l(-1)) were severely elevated. After a washout period of 6 weeks, all patients started monotherapy with 80 mg simvastatin. Remarkably, LDL-C reduction was dependent on baseline LDL-C levels ranging from 51.1 to 45.5% in the top versus the bottom third of the LDL-C distribution. Unexpected in FH, elevated baseline TG levels were seen in 30% and low HDL-C levels in 15% of all patients. Also, changes in these lipoproteins were dependent on baseline levels; TG reduction was 40.7 versus 22.2% in patients with elevated versus normal levels, while HDL-C increase was 29.1 versus 11.4% in patients with low versus normal HDL-C levels. In conclusion, FH patients with the worst lipoprotein profile showed the greatest benefit from high-dose simvastatin treatment, since changes in these parameters were partly determined by baseline lipid levels.", 
    "101": "The effect of statins on Lp(a) levels is controversial; furthermore, the potential action of statins on apo(a) fragmentation is indeterminate. We therefore determined the circulating levels of Lp(a) and of apo(a) fragments in hypercholesterolemic patients before and after treatment (6 weeks) with Atorvastatin 10 mg/day (A10) or Simvastatin 20 mg/day (S20). In a double blind study, hypercholesterolemic patients (n=391) at high cardiovascular risk (LDL-C>=4.13 mmol/l; TG<2.24 mmol/l; 34% with documented CHD; 45% hypertensive; and 29% current smokers) were assigned to treatment with A10 (n=199) or S20 (n=192). Plasma Lp(a) and apo(a) fragment levels (n=206) were measured prior to and after treatment. At baseline, A10 and S20 groups did not differ in plasma levels of lipids, Lp(a) (A10: 0.45+/-0.48 mg/ml, S20: 0.46+/-0.5), and apo(a) fragments (A10: 3.88+/-5.22 microg/ml; S20: 3.25+/-3), and equally in apo(a) isoform size (A10: 26+/-5 kr, S20: 25.5+/-5.3). After treatment, both statins significantly reduced Lp(a) levels (A10: 0.42+/-0.47 mg/ml, 6% variation, P<0.001; S20: 0.45+/-0.53 mg/ml, 0.02% variation, P=0.046). A10 and S20 did not significantly differ in their efficacy to lower Lp(a) levels. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, the reduction of Lp(a) levels was independently associated with Lp(a) baseline concentration, but not to other variables, including LDL-C reduction. Plasma levels of apo(a) fragments were not modified by either statin. In conclusion, both A10 and S20 significantly lowered Lp(a), although this effect was of greater magnitude in atorvastatin-treated patients.", 
    "102": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) afflicts nearly 16 million persons in the U.S. Forty million people have impaired glucose tolerance and thus have a 10% annualized risk of developing type 2 DM. These prevalence rates are estimated to double within the next two decades. At-risk groups appear to be the elderly and minorities including African, Hispanic and Native Americans. While the epidemiologic underpinnings for this increase are not fully realized, there has been a parallel increase in societal obesity, sedentary lifestyle and a marked increase in type 2 DM among children. Although there have recently been noteworthy advances in the field of cardiovascular medicine, cardiovascular case fatalities remain the leading cause of death among diabetic patients. According to national health statistics, there continues to be a downward trend in cardiovascular mortality and morbidity. This observation has not been consistently noted among patients with DM and has led many to re-evaluate current treatment goals and pharmacologic regimens for the at-risk patients with type 2 DM. This shifting treatment paradigm for diabetic patients has led to a ratcheting down of targeted risk factor goals including low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and serum glucose levels with a requisite increase in the number of pharmacologic agents being administered. This review focuses on the current adjunctive pharmacologic treatment regimen that is well suited for patients with type 2 DM.", 
    "103": "In experimental animals and humans, the concentration of serum mevalonate (MVA), a direct product of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, is considered to reflect the activity of whole-body sterol synthesis. The relationship between the concentration of serum MVA and the activity of sterol synthesis in tissues, however, has not been fully clarified. In the present study, we examined MVA metabolism by using pravastatin, a liver-selective inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, and common marmosets, a good model animal for studying lipid metabolism. In the time course study, the maximal reduction in the concentration of serum MVA was observed 2 h after a single oral administration of 30 mg/kg pravastatin to common marmosets. We, therefore, examined the relationship between the concentrations of serum and hepatic MVA, and sterol synthesis in some tissues at this time point. Sterol synthesis was determined ex vivo in tissue slices by measuring the incorporation of [14C]acetate into digitonin-precipitable [14C]sterols. Pravastatin at 0.03-30 mg/kg reduced dose-dependently the activity of hepatic sterol synthesis, whereas no significant reduction of sterol synthesis was observed in other tissues such as intestine, kidney, testis and spleen, even with the highest dose (30 mg/kg). The liver-specific inhibition of sterol synthesis caused parallel reductions in the concentrations of both serum and liver MVA. In addition, there were good correlations between the concentration of either serum or hepatic MVA and the activity of hepatic sterol synthesis. These data indicate that the major origin of serum MVA is the liver, and that the concentration of serum MVA reflects the concentration of hepatic MVA and the activity of hepatic sterol synthesis 2 h after a single oral administration of pravastatin in common marmosets.",

This statin reduced total chlesterol by 36%, LDL-C by 46%, triglycerides by 31%, and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) by 44%, while it increased HDL-C by 7%; all these changes were significant. The NCEP LDL-C and non-HDL-C treatment goals were reached by 95% (n = 759) and 97% (n = 776), respectively, of patients on atorvastatin. Only 14% of the 'usual' care patients received any hypolipidaemic drugs throughout the study and 3% of them reached the NCEP LDL-C treatment goal.

Statins were used significantly more often in whites (30%) than in blacks (20%, P = 0.001) and in older individuals. These differences in statin use were not due to differences in lipid levels among the patient groups. As expected, the group of patients treated with statins had significantly higher serum lipid levels than untreated patients. Patient survival was significantly better in patients treated with statins than in untreated patients. That relationship became apparent, however, only after controlling for three additional factors: recipient age, transplant year, and serum cholesterol levels. In a multivariable Cox survival model, patient survival was associated significantly with statin use (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.76; confidence interval [CI], 0.6 to 0.96; P = 0.02), recipient age (HR = 1.05; CI, 1.04 to 1.06; P < 0.0001), and transplant year (HR = 1.05; CI, 1.01 to 1.08; P = 0.001).

Statins (< or =5 micromol/L) stimulate rodent bone formation, but the mechanistic basis remains unclear. Since statins and the proteasome inhibitor lactacystin are structurally similar, and high doses (> or =40 micromol/L) of statins can inhibit the chymotryptic activity of the proteasome, it has been hypothesized that statins exert their anabolic effects on bone, in part, by inhibiting the proteasome, the major eukaryotic intracellular regulatory protease. This hypothesis conflicts with reports that statins stimulate proteasome activity and that proteasome-catalyzed degradation of specific substrates is required for cell proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Our chief objective was to determine the effects of statins (< or =10 micromol/L) on the chymotryptic activity of the proteasome in the 20 S proteasome and intact murine MC3T3-E1 cells cultured to low density (preosteoblasts) or high density (differentiated osteoblasts). Lovastatin (0.001 micromol/L to 5.0 micromol/L) stimulated the chymotryptic activity of the highly purified 20 S proteasome. Preosteoblasts and differentiated osteoblasts treated with 1, 5, or 10 micromol/L lovastatin for 1 hour exhibited morphologic abnormalities that were ameliorated by preincubation and treatment with 20 micromol/L mevalonate. The chymotryptic activity of the preosteoblast proteasome increased after 2 days of 1.0 micromol/L or 5.0 micromol/L lovastatin treatment. In addition, the DNA and protein contents of 1.0 micromol/L or 5.0 micromol/L lovastatin-treated preosteoblast cultures were lower those that observed in vehicle-, 0.01 micromol/L lovastatin-, or 0.10 micromol/L lovastatin-treated cultures. The chymotryptic activity of the proteasome was much lower in differentiated osteoblasts than in preosteoblasts. Two days of treatment with 1 micromol/L lovastatin modestly stimulated the chymotryptic activity of the proteasome in differentiated osteoblasts, but had no effects on total protein or DNA, compared to cultures treated with vehicle or lower doses of lovastatin. Thus, the data support the hypothesis that statins stimulate proteasome activities in highly purified proteasome preparations and preosteoblastic cells. Treating preosteoblastic or differentiated MC3T3-E1 cells with lovastatin concentrations > or = 1 micromol/L resulted in abnormal morphology and reduced the DNA and protein levels in preosteoblastic cultures, confirming the adverse effects of statins previously reported for other cells. In conclusion, the hypothesis that lovastatin exerts its anabolic effects on bone by inhibiting the proteasome activity of the osteoblast was refuted, and the effects of lovastatin on MC3T3-E1 cells were found to be highly dose- and development-dependent.", 
    "117": "The combination of angiostatin and endostatin has been shown to have synergistic antiangiogenic and antitumor effects when the genes for these proteins are delivered to tumor cells by retroviral gene transfer. Here we report the construction of a murine angiostatin-endostatin fusion gene (Statin-AE) which shows enhanced antiangiogenic activity on human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) tube formation in vitro compared with angiostatin or endostatin alone. Similarly, the fusion gene demonstrates antiangiogenic effects in vivo and antitumor activity in a B16F10 melanoma model when co-delivered by retroviral packaging cell inoculation in mice. The fusion gene demonstrates significantly greater inhibition of tumor growth compared with angiostatin, endostatin or the combination of genes.", 
    "118": "Osteoporosis is a chronic disease that affects a large number of both men and women and is characterized by a decrease in bone mass, as well as weakened bones. It causes a significant amount of morbidity and mortality in patients and is often only diagnosed after a fracture occurs. This review will highlight recent advances in the development of novel anabolic approaches for treatment of osteoporosis, such as parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium sensing receptor modulators, statins and prostanoid receptor agonists. Selected antiresorptive targets (cathepsin K inhibitors and vitronectin receptor antagonists) will also be surveyed.", 
    "119": "Coronary calcification measured by fast computed tomography techniques is a surrogate marker of coronary atherosclerotic plaque burden. In a cohort study, we prospectively investigated whether lipid-lowering therapy with a cholesterol synthesis enzyme inhibitor reduces the progression of coronary calcification.", 
    "120": "In 66 patients with coronary calcifications in electron beam tomography (EBT), LDL cholesterol >130 mg/dL, and no lipid-lowering treatment, the EBT scan was repeated after a mean interval of 14 months and treatment with cerivastatin was initiated (0.3 mg/d). After 12 months of treatment, a third EBT scan was performed. Coronary calcifications were quantified using a volumetric score. Cerivastatin therapy lowered the mean LDL cholesterol level from 164+/-30 to 107+/-21 mg/dL. The median calcified volume was 155 mm3 (range, 15 to 1849) at baseline, 201 mm3 (19 to 2486) after 14 months without treatment, and 203 mm3 (15 to 2569) after 12 months of cerivastatin treatment. The median annualized absolute increase in coronary calcium was 25 mm3 during the untreated versus 11 mm3 during the treatment period (P=0.01). The median annual relative increase in coronary calcium was 25% during the untreated versus 8.8% during the treatment period (P<0.0001). In 32 patients with an LDL cholesterol level <100 mg/dL under treatment, the median relative change was 27% during the untreated versus -3.4% during the treatment period (P=0.0001).",

    "122": "Accumulation of a 40-42-amino acid peptide, termed amyloid-beta peptide (A beta), is associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and identifying medicines that inhibit A beta could help patients with AD. Recent evidence suggests that a class of medicines that lower cholesterol by blocking the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), termed statins, can inhibit A beta production. Increasing evidence suggests that the enzymes that generate A beta function best in a high-cholesterol environment, which might explain why reducing cholesterol would inhibit A beta production. Studies using both neurons and peripheral cells show that reducing cellular cholesterol levels, by stripping off the cholesterol with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin or by treating the cells with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, decreases A beta production. Studies performed on animal models and on humans concur with these results. In humans, lovastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, has been shown to reduce A beta levels in blood of patients by up to 40%. The putative role of A beta in AD raises the possibility that treating patients with statins might lower A beta, and thereby either delay the occurrence of AD or retard the progression of AD. Two large retrospective studies support this hypothesis. Both studies suggest that patients taking statins had an approx. 70% lower risk of developing AD. Since statins are widely used by doctors, their ability to reduce A beta offers a putative therapeutic strategy for treating AD by using medicines that have already been proved safe to use in humans.", 
    "123": "The use of cyclosporin A (CsA) in solid organ transplantation has been shown to be associated with the development of hypertension and nephrotoxicity. Several mechanisms, including endothelin (ET)-1-mediated systemic vasoconstriction, are considered to be responsible for CsA-induced hypertension. This study shows that: (i) incubation of CsA (1 microg) with bovine aortic endothelial cells leads to increased ET secretion by+40%; (ii) the use of compactin, the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor and fibric acid, the peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha activator, inhibit the CsA-induced ET secretion to the level below the basal ET secretion, by -32% and -26% respectively; (iii) both inhibitions were reversed by the addition of mevalonate, suggesting communication between the HMG-CoA reductase product and PPAR-alpha pathway. The present findings may be of significant clinical relevance, since statins and fibrates beyond their hypolipidaemic action may represent a potential therapeutic tool in the treatment or prophylaxis of CsA-associated side effects. Furthermore, we suggest that the mevalonate metabolism would interfere with PPAR-alpha activity.", 
    "124": "Postischemic acute renal failure (ARF) is common and often fatal. Cellular mechanisms include cell adhesion, cell infiltration and generation of oxygen free radicals, and inflammatory cytokine production. Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (\"statins\") directly influence inflammatory mechanisms. The hypothesis that ischemia-induced ARF could be ameliorated with statin treatment was investigated and possible molecular mechanisms were analyzed in a uninephrectomized rat model. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were pretreated with cerivastatin (0.5 mg/kg) or vehicle for 3 d. Ischemic ARF was induced by left renal artery clipping for 45 min, while the right kidney was being removed. After 24 h of ARF, serum creatinine levels were increased 7.5-fold in vehicle-treated control animals with ARF, compared with sham-operated animals (P < 0.005). Statin treatment reduced the creatinine level elevation by 40% (P < 0.005). Simultaneously, ischemia-induced severe decreases in GFR were significantly ameliorated by statin treatment (sham operation, 0.95 +/- 0.09 ml/min, n = 13; ischemia without treatment, 0.06 +/- 0.02 ml/min, n = 9; ischemia with statin pretreatment, 0.21 +/- 0.03 ml/min, n = 11; P < 0.001). Furthermore, statin pretreatment prevented the occurrence of tubular necrosis, with marked loss of the brush border, tubular epithelial cell detachment, and tubular obstruction in the S3 segment of the outer medullary stripe. In addition, monocyte and macrophage infiltration was almost completely prevented, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 upregulation was greatly decreased, and inducible nitric oxide synthase expression was reduced. Fibronectin and collagen IV expression was reduced, approaching levels observed in sham-operated animals. In vehicle-treated rats with ARF, mitogen-activated protein kinase extracellular activated kinase-1/2 activity was increased and the transcription factors nuclear factor-kappaB and activator protein-1 were activated. Statin treatment reduced this activation toward levels observed in sham-operated rats. The data suggest that hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibition protects renal tissue from the effects of ischemia-reperfusion injury and thus reduces the severity of ARF. The chain of events may involve anti-inflammatory effects, with inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and the redox-sensitive transcription factors nuclear factor-kappaB and activator protein-1.", 
    "125": "The triglyceride-lowering effect of pitavastatin, a potent 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, was investigated in a rat model of postprandial lipemia. Plasma triglyceride levels started to increase 4 h after the fat load, reached the maximum at 6 h and then gradually decreased. A single dose of pitavastatin (1 mg/kg) significantly suppressed chylomicron-triglyceride secretion into the lymph by 40% and delayed the elevation of plasma triglyceride. Pitavastatin at 1 mg/kg decreased the 6-h plasma triglyceride levels by 53% and at 0.5 mg/kg decreased the 0-12 h area under the curve (AUC) of triglyceride levels by 56%. Atorvastatin also caused decreases, but to a lesser extent. Pitavastatin, and atorvastatin to a lesser extent, reduced the activity of the intestinal microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) at 6 h. These results suggested that a single dose of pitavastatin lowered postprandial triglyceride levels in rats by decreasing chylomicron-triglyceride secretion, probably through a reduction of intestinal MTP activity and triglyceride droplet formation in the endoplasmic reticulum.", 
    "126": "Statins have been suggested as potential agents in the management of osteoporosis. Reviews of medical records have shown an increased bone mass and some studies have shown a reduced occurrence of fractures in subjects on long-term treatment with statins. We studied the effects of treatment with statins on calcium homeostasis, bone turnover and bone mineral density.", 
    "127": "In a cross-sectional design, plasma levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and biochemical markers of bone turnover, bone mineral density (BMD) and body composition (fat- and lean tissue-mass) were measured in 140 postmenopausal women who had been treated with a statin for more than 2 years (median 4 years) and compared to 140 age- and gender-matched, population-based controls.", 
    "128": "Plasma levels of bone turnover markers were lower in the statin-treated subjects than in the controls: osteocalcin (-9%, P = 0.03), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (-14%, P < 0.01), and C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (-11%, P < 0.01). On the other hand, plasma PTH levels were 16% higher in the statin-treated subjects than in the controls (P < 0.01). However, body composition and BMD at the lumbar spine, hip, forearm and whole body did not differ between the two groups. No correlation could be demonstrated between changes in biochemical quantities and dose or duration of statin use.",

    "130": "The clinical management of tacrolimus, a macrolide used as immunosuppressant after transplantation, is complicated by its narrow therapeutic index in combination with inter- and intraindividually variable pharmacokinetics. As a substrate of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A enzymes and P-glycoprotein, tacrolimus interacts with several other drugs used in transplantation medicine, which also are known CYP3A and/or P-glycoprotein inhibitors and/or inducers. In clinical studies, CYP3A/P-glycoprotein inhibitors and inducers primarily affect oral bioavailability of tacrolimus rather than its clearance, indicating a key role of intestinal P-glycoprotein and CYP3A. There is an almost complete overlap between the reported clinical drug interactions of tacrolimus and those of cyclosporin. However, in comparison with cyclosporin, only few controlled drug interaction studies have been carried out, but tacrolimus drug interactions have been extensively studied in vitro. These results are inconsistent and are of poor predictive value for clinical drug interactions because of false negative results. P-glycoprotein regulates distribution of tacrolimus through the blood-brain barrier into the brain as well as distribution into lymphocytes. Interaction of other drugs with P-glycoprotein may change tacrolimus tissue distribution and modify its toxicity and immunosuppressive activity. There is evidence that ethnic and gender differences exist for tacrolimus drug interactions. Therapeutic drug monitoring to guide dosage adjustments of tacrolimus is an efficient tool to manage drug interactions. In the near future, progress can be expected from studies evaluating potential pharmacokinetic interactions caused by herbal preparations and food components, the exact biochemical mechanism underlying tacrolimus toxicity, and the potential of inhibition of CYP3A and P-glycoprotein to improve oral bioavailability and to decrease intraindividual variability of tacrolimus pharmacokinetics.", 
    "131": "It is agreed that people with a high blood LDL-cholesterol level will have a higher risk of coronary heart disease (CAD) than those with low blood LDL-cholesterol level. Because of the present National Drug Strategy of Thailand, the promotion of \"in-country production\" of a generic drug has been established. Simvastatin is one of the drugs in this strategy. In this, the primary report of a randomized crossover study with washout period for a cholesterol lowering effect in a generic product of simvastatin (Unison company) which was compared to the original simvastatin (Zocor) hypercholesterolemic to the subjects were presented. Simvastatin used in this study were derived from two sources. The first group was the original product (Zocor), dosage 10 mg, Lot No IC4/36(N) from Merck Sharp & Dohme Company and the second group was a generic product, dosage 10 mg, Lot No T05/080 and T06/109 from Unison Company. All simvastatin tablets from the first and second sources were inserted into closed capsule of the same shape and called drug A and drug B, respectively. Both the physician in-charge and the subjects in this study were blinded for the content inside the capsule (Double blind). Thirty drug capsules were put into a sachet and distributed to the subject at each visit. The interval between each visit was 4 weeks. All subjects were asked to bring back the residual capsule within the sachet to the researcher at each visit in order to evaluate the subject's compliance. All subjects had physical examination and blood tests at each visit. Furthermore, all subjects were advised to practice diet control and regular in-take of the drug capsule daily after their evening meal. All 48 subjects were randomly allocated into 2 groups. This study was run as a randomized crossover study. After taking the drugs for the first 8 weeks, no statistically significant difference of blood LDL-cholesterol between the first and second group was detected. After a 4 week washout period, crossover and taking the drugs for the last 8 weeks, no statistically significant difference of blood LDL-cholesterol between the first and second group was detected. At the end of this study, comparing both groups by ANOVA crossover test, no statistically significant difference of blood LDL-cholesterol between the first and second group was detected.",

    "133": "A concomitant management of hypertension and high-plasma cholesterol has been suggested to significantly reduce the extent of cardiovascular complications. Hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) have been demonstrated to be very effective in the treatment of patients with hypercholesterolemia where they reduce the rate of coronary and cerebrovascular complications. This benefit is largely extended to the hypertensive population. Very recently some studies have demonstrated the capacity of statins to improve blood pressure control in patients with hypertension and this effect, which has not been demonstrated for the other lipid-lowering drugs, could be very important in the clinical management of overall cardiovascular risk.", 
    "134": "These findings confirm that the prevention of cardiovascular diseases should be based on the aggressive treatment of many different risk factors. This is particularly true for patients with hypertension and hypercholesterolemia for whom the negative interaction between risk factors could be effectively managed by an appropriate choice of both antihypertensive and lipid-lowering drugs.",

Detailed fasting lipid profiles, hepatic function tests, and serum creatinine phosphokinase were obtained regularly. Baseline and six month characteristics were compared using the unpaired student t test for continuous variables and Chi-square analysis or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate.", 
    "137": "Baseline total cholesterol levels, LDL cholesterol levels, HDL cholesterol levels, and triglyceride levels were similar in the two groups. At six months, the total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglyceride levels were greatly reduced in both groups, with greater reductions in the simvastatin group than in the pravastatin group. Only modest increases were noted in HDL cholesterol levels in the two groups. No significant adverse effects were noted, and no complications with drug withdrawals occurred. Patient compliance exceeded 97%.", 
    "138": "Simvastatin and pravastatin are safe and very effective in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol lowering in heart transplant recipients, with simvastatin being more efficacious than pravastatin in lipid lowering in this group of patients.", 
    "139": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of mortality and a major cause of disability in advanced age. The relationship between coronary heart disease (CHD) and dyslipoproteinaemia is well known. The fact, however, that atherosclerosis is a systemic disease leads also to the consideration that patients suffering from cerebrovascular and peripheral arterial disease should benefit similarly from lipid lowering therapy as do patients with CHD. There is already growing evidence that the incidence of stroke may be markedly decreased by statin therapy. Though overall, the clinical significance of hypercholesterolaemia seems to decrease with increasing age, patients at age 65 to 75 tend to benefit even more than younger patients when elevated LDL-cholesterol is treated effectively. It should be noticed that prevention or postponement of cardiovascular events may also prevent premature functional limitations and disability in old age. Hence, it is suggested to screen elderly people with CVD for dyslipoproteinaemia and to treat elevated cholesterol levels by means of life style changes, nutritional therapy, and drug therapy. Treatment regimes should be considered depending upon complete risk stratification and geriatric assessment. Chronological age alone cannot be an argument to withhold a proven effective therapy from a growing segment of the population at risk.", 
    "140": "Clinical studies indicate that treatment with statins significantly reduces the incidence of myocardial infarction and death from cardiovascular diseases. Quite recently statins were found to exert a direct cardiovascular effect, which is independent on their well-known cholesterol lowering action. In this article current views on the role of statins in improvement of function of vascular endothelium are presented."
