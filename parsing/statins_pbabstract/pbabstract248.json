Recently, it has been reported that they promote bone formation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of simvastatin on ligature-induced bone resorption in the mandible of the ovariectomized rat.", 
    "1": "Forty-nine rats were divided into seven groups; ligature was placed in all groups except group 7, which was considered the sham group: group 1 (N = 7), ovariectomy (OVX) plus simvastatin (10(-6) M); group 2 (N = 7), OVX plus simvastatin (3 x 10(-7) M); group 3 (N = 7), OVX plus simvastatin (10(-7) M); group 4 (N = 7), OVX plus normal saline; group 5 (N = 7), OVX group; group 6 (N = 7), ligature without OVX; and group 7 (N = 7), sham surgery without OVX and ligature. Simvastatin was administered subperiosteally in the buccal fold of the bottom right first molar twice a week during the study. Four weeks after insertion of the ligatures, the animals were sacrificed. Mandibles were removed for radiologic and histologic analysis. Bone density, bone loss (BL), and attachment loss were measured. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare groups.", 
    "2": "Histologic analysis showed that the simvastatin groups developed significantly less periodontal breakdown (P <0.05). BL was less in the simvastatin experimental group, but there was not a significant statistical difference between the simvastatin groups (groups 1 through 3) and the experimental control groups (groups 5 and 6; P >0.05).",

    "4": "The hepatotoxic potential of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors in patients with underlying chronic liver disease remains controversial. We performed a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial that compared pravastatin (80 mg) to a placebo administered once daily to hypercholesterolemic subjects greater than 18 years of age with at least a 6-month history of compensated chronic liver disease and with a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level greater than or equal to 100 mg/dL and a triglyceride (TG) level lower than 400 mg/dL. The efficacy was determined by the percentage change in LDL-C [along with the total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and TG] from the baseline to week 12. The safety was analyzed by the proportion of subjects who developed at least 1 alanine aminotransferase (ALT) value greater than or equal to 2 times the upper limit of normal for those with normal ALT at the baseline or a doubling of the baseline ALT for those with elevated ALT at the baseline during 36 weeks of treatment. A total of 630 subjects were screened, and 326 subjects were randomized; nonalcoholic fatty liver disease was present in 64%, and chronic hepatitis C was present in 23%. In the intent-to-treat population, pravastatin (80 mg/day) significantly lowered the mean LDL-C, TC, and TG values at week 12 and at other times (weeks 4, 8, 24, and 36) in comparison with the placebo. The incidence of subjects who met the primary prespecified ALT event definition was lower in the pravastatin group at all times over the 36 weeks of therapy in comparison with the placebo group, although the difference was not statistically significant. No differences were seen on the basis of the baseline ALT values or among the different liver disease groups.", 
    "5": "High-dose pravastatin (80 mg/day) administered to hypercholesterolemic subjects with chronic liver disease significantly lowered LDL-C, TC, and TGs in comparison with the placebo and was safe and well tolerated. The concern over an increased potential for statin-induced hepatotoxicity in patients with chronic liver disease appears to be lessened on the basis of these results.", 
    "6": "Statin therapy may target both hypercholesterolemia and cholestasis in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC). However, little is known about the efficacy and safety of statins in PBC. The aim of this single-center study was therefore to prospectively examine the effects of atorvastatin on serum markers of cholestasis, aminotransferases, and lipid and bile acid metabolism as well as inflammatory and immunological markers in patients with PBC. Fifteen patients with early-stage PBC and an incomplete biochemical response to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) therapy (defined as alkaline phosphatase 1.5-fold above the upper limit of normal after 1 year) were treated with atorvastatin 10 mg/day, 20 mg/day, and 40 mg/day for 4 weeks, respectively. Serum levels of alkaline phosphatase increased during atorvastatin 20 mg and 40 mg (P < 0.05), whereas leucine aminopeptidase and gamma-glutamyltransferase remained unchanged. No statistical differences in overall serum ALT, AST, bilirubin, and IgM levels were observed. However, atorvastatin was discontinued in 1 out of 15 patients because of ALT 2-fold above baseline, and 2 patients showed ALT elevations 3-fold above the upper limit of normal at the end of the atorvastatin treatment period. Serum total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased by 35% and 49%, respectively (P < 0.001). Precursors of cholesterol biosynthesis (lanosterol, desmosterol, lathosterol) showed a similar pattern. No changes in serum bile acid levels and composition were observed during treatment.",

    "9": "Fifty eight patients with primary dysli pidemia were recruited for a 12-week treatment. Forty two patients were allocated to be treated with statins (20 mg): 24 with simvastatin and 18 with pravastatin. Sixteen patients received gemfibrozil in a dose of 900 mg daily. Using enzyme, colorimetric, turbidimetric, immunoenzyme and chromogenic substrate methods, we studied the following laboratory parameters: 1) lipid parameters - total cholesterol, LDL and HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, apoli poprotein A-I, apoli poprotein B, anticardioli pin antibodies and lipid indices; 2) hemostasis, fibrinolysis and blood rheology parameters - platelet count, ADP-induced platelet aggregation, fibrinogen, platelet factor 4,antithrombin III activity, alpha2-anti plasmin concentrations, alpha2-macroglobulin, alpha1-antitripsin, plasma viscosity and hematocrit.", 
    "10": "Gemfibrozil elevated significantly apolipoprotein A-I, but decreased the total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, the lipid indices, the ADP-induced platelet aggregation, plasminogen, alpha2-antiplasmin and hematocrit. Simvastatin treatment of patients reduced the total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, two of the lipid indices, plasma viscosity and hematocrit. Pravastatin produced the same changes in the lipid parameters, but decreased apolipoprotein A-I. Plasminogen, alpha2-antiplasmin and rheological parameters decreased while antithrombin III increased.",

    "12": "Statins should not become available as over- or behind-the-counter drugs at chemist shops. The efficacy of these drugs when given in low dosages has not been proved although the negative aspect of possible side effects remains a realistic possibility. The use of statins as compensation for an unhealthy lifestyle is not desirable and there is a danger that patients with high vascular risk would receive treatment without being adequately supervised.", 
    "13": "A good strategy for prevention of cardiovascular disease must be population-based. So far the efficacy of lifestyle intervention on this level is sadly low. As a polypill is not yet available, a good alternative would be the introduction of a statin as an over-the-counter product in the Netherlands.", 
    "14": "Postprandial hypertriglyceridemia is associated with a series of atherogenic abnormalities, including a prothrombotic state and inflammation. Hypertensive patients have exaggerated postprandial triglyceride response. The benefit of combined treatment of statin and angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (ARB) has been demonstrated in diabetic patients. The aim of this investigation was to explore the effect of a statin, fluvastatin, and the ARB valsartan, alone and in combination, on fibrinolytic activity and inflammation after a high-fat meal in patients with essential hypertension (EHP). A total of 53 EHP patients were studied. The concentrations of plasma lipid profiles, soluble P-selectin, tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor type I (PAI-1) antigens were measured in fasting state and at 4 hours after a single high-fat meal (800 calories; 50 g fat). Patients randomly accepted placebo, fluvastatin 40 mg/day, valsartan 80 mg/day, or both for 1 week. Then a high-fat meal and assay of plasma samples were repeated. The postprandial plasma triglyceride, soluble P-selectin, PAI-1, and t-PA antigen concentrations significantly increased after a high-fat meal. Postprandial plasma concentration of triglyceride was significantly correlated with that of soluble P-selectin and PAI-1 antigen, respectively (P<0.001). The postprandial increase in plasma P-selectin, PAI-1, and t-PA antigen levels was attenuated by 1-week fluvastatin-alone and valsartan-alone treatments; their combination is more effective on both fasting and postprandial P-selectin, plasma PAI-1, and t-PA antigen levels. The improvement of these plasma variables was not significantly related to the changes of plasma lipids and blood pressure. In conclusion, postprandial hypertriglyceridemia induces postprandial fibrinolytic dysfunction and vascular inflammation in patients with essential hypertension after a high-fat meal. Short-term combined treatment with fluvastatin and valsartan more effectively inhibits this postprandial atherogenic change in plasma than monotherapy.", 
    "15": "The Rho kinase (ROCK) isoforms, ROCK1 and ROCK2, were initially discovered as downstream targets of the small GTP-binding protein Rho. Because ROCKs mediate various important cellular functions such as cell shape, motility, secretion, proliferation, and gene expression, it is likely that this pathway will intersect with other signaling pathways known to contribute to cardiovascular disease. Indeed, ROCKs have already been implicated in the regulation of vascular tone, proliferation, inflammation, and oxidative stress. However, it is not entirely clear how ROCKs are regulated, what some of their downstream targets are, and whether ROCK1 and ROCK2 mediate different cellular functions. Clinically, inhibition of ROCK pathway is believed to contribute to some of the cardiovascular benefits of statin therapy that are independent of lipid lowering (ie, pleiotropic effects). To what extent ROCK activity is inhibited in patients on statin therapy is not known, but it may have important clinical implications. Indeed, several pharmaceutical companies are already actively engaged in the development of ROCK inhibitors as the next generation of therapeutic agents for cardiovascular disease because evidence from animal studies suggests the potential involvement of ROCK in hypertension and atherosclerosis.",

    "18": "Post hoc analysis was conducted of a prospective, open-label, single-cohort, multicenter Canadian study of 953 patients who were treated for 6 weeks with ezetimibe 10 mg/day coadministered with their current statin at an unaltered dose. For each patient, E-R(CAD) at baseline and at 6 weeks was calculated using the Framingham model. The primary outcome measure of the analysis was the change in E-R(CAD).", 
    "19": "A total of 825 patients with data at baseline and 6 weeks were included in the analysis. There were 423 (51.3%) patients with hypertension, 107 (13.0%) with diabetes mellitus but not metabolic syndrome, 160 (19.4%) with metabolic syndrome but not diabetes mellitus, and 235 (28.5%) with both diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome. After 6 weeks of ezetimibe coadministration with statin therapy, mean E-R(CAD) was reduced by 4.1% from 15.6% to 11.5%, which is equivalent to a 25.3% risk reduction (p < 0.001). Of the 225 (27.3%) patients with high E-R(CAD) (> or = 20.1%) at baseline, 144 (64.0%) converted to a lower E-R(CAD) category (p < 0.001).

    "21": "Cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta- and gamma-secretases results in generation of the amyloid-beta protein (Abeta), which is characteristically deposited in the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients. Inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase (the statins) reduce levels of cholesterol and isoprenoids such as geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP). Previous studies have demonstrated that cholesterol increases and statins reduce Abeta levels mostly by regulating beta-secretase activity. In this study, we focused on the role of geranylgeranyl isoprenoids GGPP and geranylgeraniol (GGOH) in regulating Abeta production. Our data show that the inhibition of GGPP synthesis by statins plays an important role in statin-mediated reduction of Abeta secretion. Consistent with this finding, the geranylgeranyl isoprenoids preferentially increase the yield of Abeta of 42 residues (Abeta42) in a dose-dependent manner. Our studies further demonstrated that geranylgeranyl isoprenoids increase the yield of APP-CTFgamma (a.k.a. AICD) as well as Abeta by stimulating gamma-secretase-mediated cleavage of APP-CTFalpha and APP-CTFbeta in vitro. Furthermore, GGOH increases the levels of the active gamma-secretase complex in the detergent-insoluble membrane fraction along with its substrates, APP-CTFalpha and APP-CTFbeta. Our results indicate that geranylgeranyl isoprenoids may be an important physiological facilitator of gamma-secretase activity that can foster production of the pathologically important Abeta42.", 
    "22": "Little information is available concerning the possible antiproliferative effects of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) on the thyroid gland. We have hypothesized that the antiproliferative effects of statins observed in thyroid cell lines in vitro may have a clinical counterpart that could be detected by investigating the prevalence and size of thyroid nodules in patients on long-term treatment with statins.", 
    "23": "We retrospectively evaluated 135 dyslipidaemic patients receiving statin therapy continuously for at least 5 years, and 137 controls. All the subjects were submitted to ultrasound investigation of the thyroid gland, to establish prevalence, number and volume of thyroid nodules.", 
    "24": "Subjects treated with statins showed markedly lower prevalence of thyroid nodules (36.3%vs. 67.9%, P < 0.001), as well as reduced number and smaller total volume of lesions, as compared to the control group. A logistic regression analysis, taking into account age, sex, risk factors for the development of thyroid nodules and concomitant drug treatment, revealed that treatment with statins remained the only important predictor of the presence of thyroid nodules [odds ratio (OR) 0.312, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.156-0.625, P < 0.001] besides risk factors.", 
    "25": "Our data provide the first circumstantial evidence of an association between HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor treatment and reduced prevalence, number and volume of thyroid nodules. This finding may be explained by an antiproliferative and/or pro-apoptotic effect of long-term statin treatment on thyroid cells, in vivo.", 
    "26": "Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are at increased risk for macrovascular disease complications. Hyperglycemia and atherosclerotic disease clearlyare associated, andbiologic intermediates mediated by hyperglycemia exist. Our understanding of the pathobiology linking hyperglycemia and atherosclerotic disease continues to evolve. Modulation of the advanced glycation end product (AGE) receptor for AGE (RAGE)/soluble RAGE (sRAGE) system, the thromboxane receptor, and C-peptide comprise just a few of the plausible links between dysglycemia and atherosclerosis. It seems intuitive, therefore, that therapeutic management of blood glucose in patients with diabetes should reduce macrovascular disease and related deaths. However, studies of glucose-lowering therapies performed to date yield qualitatively and quantitatively different results. No definitive proof of the concept is yet available, although it remains probable, with investigations presently under way. Numerous interventions extending beyond glucose control, including lifestyle modification, pharmacologic therapy with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), aspirin, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, as well as aggressive blood pressure control independent of blood pressure levels, have proved to be of cardiovascular benefit in the high-risk population of patients with diabetes. Thus, all of these interventions should be used in addition to glucose management in all patients with diabetes who are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease.",

CRP levels were comparable between these two groups. Statin group showed significantly lower angiographic restenosis (defined as > or = 50% stenosis at the target site) rate (35.3 vs 46.3%, p = 0.042) and target lesion revascularization (TLR) rate (14.5 vs 23.9%, p = 0.018) than control group. Multivariate analysis indicated that the prescription of statin, but not LDL-C level at follow-up and % reduction of LDL-C during the follow-up period, predict the restenosis prevention.",

Multivariate predictors of non-adherence were expected short treatment duration (OR = 3.6, 1.4-9.4), low perceived risk of myocardial infarction (OR = 3.1, 1.1-8.7), concern about potential harm from statins (OR = 2.5, 1.0-6.3), being Hispanic (OR = 3.9, 1.0-15.2), and younger age (OR = 4.2, 1.1-15.8).",

After completion of the placebo-controlled study, all children continued treatment with pravastatin 20 or 40 mg, depending on their age. Blood samples were taken on a regular basis for lipids and safety parameters, and a carotid IMT measurement was performed after an average treatment period of 4.5 years. Follow-up data for 186 children were available for the statistical analyses. Multivariate analyses revealed that age at statin initiation was an independent predictor for carotid IMT after follow-up with adjustment for carotid IMT at initiation of statin treatment, sex, and duration of treatment. Early initiation of statin treatment was associated with a subsequently smaller IMT. Furthermore, no serious laboratory adverse events were reported during follow-up, and statin treatment had no untoward effects on sexual maturation.", 
    "37": "These data indicate that early initiation of statin treatment delays the progression of carotid IMT in adolescents and young adults.

    "39": "A total of 6107 consecutive patients with LDL levels less than 60 mg/dL were identified from a tertiary care medical center or affiliated community clinic. Statin therapy was defined as a prescription during the 150 days after the low LDL value was obtained. The propensity to be treated with a statin was used to adjust the association of statin therapy and survival. A total of 4295 patients (70%) had at least 1 prescription for any medication during the 150-day observation period after the low LDL value. Their mean age was 65 years, 43% had prior ischemic heart disease, and 47% had diabetes mellitus. Statins were prescribed in 2564 patients (60%) after the low LDL value was observed. During a mean follow-up of 2.0+/-1.4 years after the observation period, there were 510 deaths. After controlling for the propensity to receive a statin, statin therapy was associated with improved survival (hazard ratio [HR], 0.65; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.80). This lower mortality was also observed for subgroups of patients already taking statins at baseline (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.88), those with extremely low LDL levels (<40 mg/dL, n=623; HR, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.33 to 0.79), and those without a history of ischemic heart disease (n=2438; HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.42 to 0.80).

We compared, in the same subjects, the impact of a dietary portfolio of cholesterol-lowering foods and a statin on LDL size electrophoretic characteristics. Thirty-four hyperlipidaemic subjects completed three 1-month treatments as outpatients in random order: a very-low saturated fat diet (control); the same diet with 20 mg lovastatin; a dietary portfolio high in plant sterols (1 g/4200 kJ), soya proteins (21.4 g/4200 kJ), soluble fibres (9.8 g/4200 kJ) and almonds (14 g/4200 kJ). LDL electrophoretic characteristics were measured by non-denaturing polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis of fasting plasma at 0, 2 and 4 weeks of each treatment. The reductions in plasma LDL-cholesterol levels with the dietary portfolio and with statins were comparable and were largely attributable to reductions in the estimated concentration of cholesterol within the smallest subclass of LDL (portfolio - 0.69 (se 0.10) mmol/l, statin - 0.99 (se 0.10) mmol/l). These were significantly greater (P < 0.01) than changes observed after the control diet ( - 0.17 (se 0.08) mmol/l). Finally, baseline C-reactive protein levels were a significant predictor of the LDL size responsiveness to the dietary portfolio but not to the other treatments. The dietary portfolio, like the statin treatment, had only minor effects on several features of the LDL size phenotype, but the pronounced reduction in cholesterol levels within the small LDL fraction may provide additional cardiovascular benefit over the traditional low-fat diet of National Cholesterol Education Program Step II.",

Monascus-fermented red mold rice (RMR), a traditional Chinese medicine as well as health food, includes monacolins (with the same function as statins) and multifunctional metabolites. In this study, ethanol extract of RMR (RE) was used to evaluate neuroprotection against Abeta40 neurotoxicity in PC12 cells. Furthermore, the effects of dietary administration of RMR on memory and learning abilities are confirmed in an animal model of AD rats infused with Abeta40 into the cerebral ventricle. During continuous Abeta40 infusion for 28 days, the rats of test groups were administered RMR or lovastatin. Memory and learning abilities were evaluated in the water maze and passive avoidance tasks. After sacrifice, cerebral cortex and hippocampus were collected for the examination of AD risk factors. The in vitro results clearly indicate that RE provides stronger neuroprotection in rescuing cell viability as well as repressing inflammatory response and oxidative stress. RMR administration potently reverses the memory deficit in the memory task. Abeta40 infusion increases acetylcholinesterase activity, reactive oxygen species, and lipid peroxidation and decreases total antioxidant status and superoxide dismutase activity in brain, but these damages were potently reversed by RMR administration, and the protection was more significant than that with lovastatin administration. The protection provided by RMR is able to prevent Abeta fibrils from being formed and deposited in hippocampus and further decrease Abeta40 accumulation, even though Abeta40 solution was infused into brain continuously.",

As a biomarker of inflammation, hsCRP levels also predict incident Type 2 diabetes and modify the risk associated with the metabolic syndrome. Recent work further demonstrates that the addition of hsCRP to information provided by traditional risk factors improves risk classification, particularly for individuals otherwise considered to be at intermediate risk. Although there remains no direct evidence that lowering hsCRP lowers vascular risk, optimal clinical outcomes have been observed in statin trials among patients who not only reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol below 1.8 mmol/l (70 mg/dl), but who also reduced hsCRP below 2 mg/l. In addition to statins, CRP levels are lowered by diet, exercise and smoking cessation, all of which are known to lower vascular event rates. Whether or not CRP represents a causal agent in atherosclerosis is controversial and an area in need of further research. However, this controversy does not diminish the clinical utility of hsCRP as a biomarker of risk that, if appropriately used in clinical practice, can substantially improve clinical care.",

In a multivariate regression model, C-reactive protein (P = .02) was the only independent predictor of acetylcholine-induced venous relaxation. In turn, correlates of C-reactive protein were assessed.

Similar results were obtained when absolute LDL-C reduction or achieved LDL-C levels were considered. In contrast, for any 10% LDL-C reduction, rates of elevated liver enzymes increased significantly with higher statin doses. Additional analyses demonstrated a significant inverse association between cancer incidence and achieved LDL-C levels (R2 = 0.43, p = 0.009), whereas no such association was demonstrated with percent LDL-C reduction (R2 = 0.09, p = 0.92) or absolute LDL-C reduction (R2 = 0.05, p = 0.23).",

However, the risk of cancer is significantly associated with lower achieved LDL-C levels. These findings suggest that drug- and dose-specific effects are more important determinants of liver and muscle toxicity than magnitude of LDL-C lowering. Furthermore, the cardiovascular benefits of low achieved levels of LDL-C may in part be offset by an increased risk of cancer.", 
    "62": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) are unequivocally useful for lowering cholesterol levels in patients with dyslipidemias characterized by elevations in total and/or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The beneficial effects of statins to lower serum cholesterol translate into significant reductions in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In addition to lowering cholesterol levels, statins have other biological effects relevant to cardiovascular homeostasis including anti-inflammatory actions and downregulation of angiotensin type 1 receptor expression that contribute to improvements in endothelial function and arterial compliance. Since endothelial dysfunction and reduced arterial compliance are important pathophysiological determinants of essential hypertension, these actions of statins raise the possibility that statin therapy may be useful for simultaneously treating dyslipidemias and hypertension. However, it has been unclear whether statins are effective in lowering blood pressure. This controversy stems from a variety of methodological limitations including inadequate sample size, confounding effects of antihypertensive drugs, differences in blood pressure measurement techniques, and differences in patient populations. However, based on published results from both small clinical studies and large randomized clinical trials, statins modestly lower blood pressure in patients with high, but not normal, blood pressure, regardless of cholesterol level.",

The 4 statins inhibited HuCC cell proliferation; however, none of them affected their apoptosis. EHEB and K562 cell proliferation was inhibited by the hydrophobic statins, but not by pravastatin. Raji cell proliferation was not affected by any of the 4 statins. The hydrophobic statins solely enhanced early apoptosis of the hematological cell lines. The results point out that the antiproliferative effect of statins on tumor cells and their effect on the apoptotic rate depends on their dosage, physiochemical property, and the type of the malignant cells.", 
    "64": "Increasing evidence suggests that the quality-rather than just the quantity-of low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) exerts a great influence on cardiovascular risk. LDLs comprise multiple subclasses with discrete size and density, and different physicochemical composition, metabolic behaviors, and atherogenicity. Individuals generally cluster into 2 broad subgroups. Most have a predominance of large LDLs, and some have a higher proportion of small particles. Small, dense LDLs are good predictors of cardiovascular events and progression of coronary artery disease. Their predominance has been accepted as an emerging cardiovascular risk factor by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III. Several studies have shown that therapeutic modulation of LDL size and subclass is of great benefit in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events. This seems particularly true for statins and fibrates when they are administered to higher-risk patients, such as those with type 2 diabetes or vascular disease. Data reporting outcomes with the use of rosuvastatin, the latest statin molecule introduced to the market, and ezetimibe, a cholesterol absorption inhibitor, are promising.", 
    "65": "Serum cardiac enzyme elevation after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), a relatively common complication, is a prognostic determinant of long-term outcome in patients who undergo these procedures. Statins are postulated to reduce such complications. This study investigated the short-term effects of pravastatin on serum creatine kinase myocardial isoform (CK-MB) and serum cardiac troponin I (cTpI) levels after elective PCI. Of 93 patients studied, 72 (77.4%) were men, and 21 (22.6%) were women (mean age, 58.9+/-11.0 y). Patients were randomly divided into 3 groups before they underwent elective PCI. Preoperatively, group 1 patients (n=30) received pravastatin 10 mg/d, and group 2 patients (n=29) received pravastatin 40 mg/d. Control group patients (n=34) received no lipid-lowering medication. Serum CK-MB and serum cTpI levels were measured preoperatively and then again at 6, 24, and 36 h postoperatively. Demographic features of patients and characteristics of the PCI procedure, including number of vessels/lesions and duration and number of inflations, did not differ among groups (P>.05). Mean serum CK-MB and serum cTpI levels were significantly increased after PCI in all patients (P<.001). When compared with control group patients, those given pravastatin did not experience significantly lowered postprocedural serum CK-MB or serum cTpI levels (P>.05). Preprocedural pravastatin therapy at dosages of 10 mg/d and 40 mg/d seems inadequate for preventing serum cardiac enzyme elevations during short-term follow-up after PCI. Additional research on this topic is recommended.", 
    "66": "Statins possess an excellent safety profile and are generally well tolerated when administered in the standard once-daily dosing regimen. A small percentage of patients however, discontinue therapy because of adverse events such as myalgias. The investigators describe 8 patients with previous intolerance to daily statin dosing and examine their responses to once-weekly rosuvastatin therapy. In conclusion, once-weekly rosuvastatin may be a feasible and effective option for patients previously intolerant to once-daily statin dosing.", 
    "67": "The increased cardiovascular risk associated with hypertriglyceridemia is thought to be due in part to high levels of triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoproteins and small dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL). In this post hoc analysis, effects of increasing doses of atorvastatin (10, 20, 40, and 80 mg) on atherogenic lipid subclasses commonly associated with hypertriglyceridemia were evaluated in 191 men and women who were candidates for lipid-lowering therapy and had baseline TG levels >200 mg/dl (2.3 mmol/L). After 8 weeks of treatment, in addition to significantly decreasing LDL cholesterol and TG levels, atorvastatin significantly increased LDL peak particle diameter (p <0.01) and significantly decreased the concentration of small LDL subclasses IIIa and IIIb (p <0.0001) from baseline at all doses. These effects were more pronounced with higher compared with lower doses of atorvastatin. Each dose of atorvastatin also significantly lowered levels of very LDL, intermediate-density lipoprotein (p <0.0001), and small very LDL subclass 3 (p <0.0001). Greater decreases were achieved by those patients receiving higher doses of atorvastatin (20, 40, and 80 mg). The increase in LDL size correlated with the decrease in TG levels, but not with the decrease in LDL cholesterol levels. However, the decrease in small dense LDL cholesterol concentrations correlated significantly with TG and LDL cholesterol decreases. In conclusion, atorvastatin significantly lowered levels of TG-rich remnant lipoproteins and favorably changed LDL particle size in patients with hypertriglyceridemia. These effects may explain the benefits of statin therapy in high-risk patients with hypertriglyceridemia even when levels of LDL cholesterol are at goal.",

A retrospective review of 1,802 consecutive patients who underwent isolated coronary artery bypass grafting from January 2002 to October 2005 was performed. Of those, 1,039 patients were receiving statins preoperatively, and 763 patients were not. Two propensity score-matched cohorts each of 641 patients (statin and nonstatin groups) were constructed. Multivariate logistic regression analyses for matched patients and all patients were performed to investigate whether preoperative statin use was associated with the incidence of new renal insufficiency. In a matched analysis, the statin group had a lower incidence of new renal insufficiency than the nonstatin group (1.6% vs 3.9%, odds ratio 0.39, 95% confidential interval 0.18 to 0.82, p = 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression analysis including all patients also showed that preoperative statin use (odds ratio 0.54, 95% confidence interval 0.30 to 0.99, p = 0.047) was significantly associated with low incidence of new postoperative renal insufficiency.

All patients had an electrocardiogram on admission that was compared with a previous electrocardiogram to confirm new-onset AF or atrial flutter. Of 1,526 patients, 164 (10.8%) had new-onset AF and 601 (39.4%) were on a statin on admission. Patients with AF were significantly more likely to be older, Caucasian, have renal insufficiency and anemia, and less likely to be diabetic, on a statin or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor on admission, or have chest pain as a presenting complaint. In univariate analysis, patients on statins were significantly less likely to have new-onset AF (odds ratio 0.40, 95% confidence interval 0.33 to 0.69, p <0.01). This relation persisted in the multivariate model (odds ratio 0.57, 95% confidence interval 0.39 to 0.83, p <0.01) after correcting for age, race, diabetes mellitus, chest pain, and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor.

    "90": "Combined hyperlipidemia results from overproduction of hepatically synthesized apolipoprotein B in very low-density lipoproteins in association with reduced lipoprotein lipase activity. Thus, this condition is typically characterized by concurrent elevations in total cholesterol and triglycerides with decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. High levels of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins, most prominently carried by low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles, are an important risk factor for coronary heart disease. Statin therapy is highly effective at lowering LDL cholesterol. Despite the benefits of statin treatment for lowering total and LDL cholesterol, many statin-treated patients still have initial or recurrent coronary heart disease events. In this regard, combined therapy with statins and fibrates is more effective in controlling atherogenic dyslipidemia in patients with combined hyperlipidemia than either drug alone. Furthermore, statins and fibrates activate PPARalpha in a synergistic manner providing a molecular rationale for combination treatment in coronary heart disease. Endothelial dysfunction associated with cardiovascular diseases may contribute to insulin resistance so that there may also be additional beneficial metabolic effects of combined statin/fibrates therapy. However, there has been little published evidence that combined therapy is synergistic or even better than monotherapy alone in clinical studies. Therefore, there is a great need to study the effects of combination therapy in patients. When statins are combined with gemfibrozil therapy, this is more likely to be accompanied by myopathy. However, this limitation is not observed when fenofibrate, bezafibrate, or ciprofibrate are used in combination therapy.", 
    "91": "Mitochondrial impairment is increasingly implicated in the etiology of toxicity caused by some thiazolidinediones, fibrates, and statins. We examined the effects of members of these drug classes on respiration of isolated rat liver mitochondria using a phosphorescent oxygen sensitive probe and on the activity of individual oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes using a recently developed immunocapture technique. Of the six thiazolidinediones examined, ciglitazone, troglitazone, and darglitazone potently disrupted mitochondrial respiration. In accord with these data, ciglitazone and troglitazone were also potent inhibitors of Complexes II+III, IV, and V, while darglitazone predominantly inhibited Complex IV. Of the six statins evaluated, lovastatin, simvastatin, and cerivastatin impaired mitochondrial respiration the most, with simvastatin and lovastatin impairing multiple OXPHOS Complexes. Within the class of fibrates, gemfibrozil more potently impaired respiration than fenofibrate, clofibrate, or ciprofibrate. Gemfibrozil only modestly inhibited Complex I, fenofibrate inhibited Complexes I, II+III, and V, and clofibrate inhibited Complex V. Our findings with the two complementary methods indicate that (1) some members of each class impair mitochondrial respiration, whereas others have little or no effect, and (2) the rank order of mitochondrial impairment accords with clinical adverse events observed with these drugs. Since the statins are frequently co-prescribed with the fibrates or thiazolidinediones, various combinations of these three drug classes were also analyzed for their mitochondrial effects. In several cases, the combination additively uncoupled or inhibited respiration, suggesting that some combinations are more likely to yield clinically relevant drug-induced mitochondrial side effects than others.",

In this study, we investigated whether a lipophilic HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor pitavastatin suppresses inflammation-related mouse colon carcinogenesis. Male CD-1 (ICR) mice were initiated with a single intraperitoneal injection of azoxymethane (AOM, 10 mg/kg body weight) and promoted by 2% (w/v) dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in drinking water for 7 days. The experimental diets containing pitavastatin at 2 dose levels (1 and 10 ppm) were fed to male CD-1 (ICR) mice for 17 weeks, staring 1 week after the cessation of DSS exposure. The effects of dietary pitavastatin on colonic tumor development were assessed at Weeks 5, 10 and 20. Feeding with pitavastatin at both doses significantly inhibited the multiplicity of colonic adenocarcinoma at Week 20. Furthermore, the treatment significantly lowered the positive rates of proliferating cell nuclear antigen and increased the apoptotic index in the colonic epithelial malignancies. The treatment also reduced nitrotyrosine-positivity in the colonic mucosa. Our findings thus show that pitavastatin is effective in inhibiting colitis-related colon carcinogenesis through modulation of mucosal inflammation, oxidative/nitrosative stress, and cell proliferation.",

Oxygen free radicals, Rho A and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) play a pivotal role in modulating these effects. Indeed, nicotine caused oxygen free radical production as well as activation of Rho A and NF-kappaB pathways, evaluated by malondialdehyde levels, pulldown assay and by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, respectively. Superoxide dimutase, Rho A (Y-27639) and NF-kappaB inhibitors (pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ammonium, Bay 11-7082) suppressed nicotine effects on CAM expression.

Low- and high-density lipoprotein (LDL and HDL, respectively) subclass analysis was performed electrophoretically, whereas lipoprotein subfractions were isolated by ultracentrifugation. Ezetimibe reduced plasma Lp-PLA2 activity and mass attributable to the reduction in plasma levels of all LDL subfractions. Rosuvastatin reduced enzyme activity and mass because of the decrease in plasma levels of all LDL subfractions and especially the Lp-PLA2 on dense LDL subfraction (LDL-5). Fenofibrate preferentially reduced the Lp-PLA2 activity and mass associated with the VLDL+IDL and LDL-5 subfractions.

Desaturases are the rate-limiting enzymes in this metabolic process and statins markedly enhance delta5 desaturase activity. To evaluate the delta5 desaturase gene expression and the transcription factors involved, THP-1 cells (a monocytic cell line) were incubated with 5 microM simvastatin for different time periods. The activity of the enzyme, evaluated as product/precursor ratio in the metabolic pathway (starting from [1-(14)C] linoleic acid), increased in treated cells with respect to controls after 24 h, whereas, mRNA levels of the delta5 desaturase increased after 12 h of incubation with simvastatin. Fatty acid desaturase genes are regulated by both sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) and peroxisome proliferators activated receptors (PPARs). Both PPARalpha (WY 14643 and fenofibrate) and PPARgamma (ciglitazone) agonists did not affect linoleic acid conversion and the delta5 desaturase activity at any time considered (8-48 h), but they increased the delta5 desaturase mRNA levels, after 48 h; only fenofibrate showed a synergistic effect with simvastatin at this time, with a concomitantly increase in PPARalpha expression and beta-oxidation. Simvastatin alone increased SREBP-1 levels with respect to controls, starting from 8 h of incubation, whereas PPARalpha and linoleic acid beta-oxidation (a PPARalpha mediated process) were not affected after 48 h of incubation. These results taken together suggest that SREBP-1 is involved in the early regulation of delta5 desaturase gene by simvastatin, in THP-1 cells.",

The therapy was well tolerated without grade 3/4 toxicity. Intrapatient (cycles I/II vs. III/IV) and interpatient comparison (vs. ten patients without simvastatin) showed reduction of drug resistance by inhibition of HMG-CoA-reductase.

This was an extension study of a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia. Protocol-compliant patients who completed the 12-week base study were eligible to enter a randomised, double-blind, 14-week extension study and were administered 1 of 8 daily treatments: EZE/SIMVA 10/10-, 10/20-, 10/40- or 10/80-mg, or SIMVA 10-, 20-, 40- or 80-mg. Patients receiving these treatments during the base study remained on the same treatment in the extension. Patients administered placebo or EZE 10-mg monotherapy during the base study were re-randomised to EZE/SIMVA 10/10 mg or SIMVA 80 mg. The primary analysis was mean per cent change in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) from baseline to extension study end-point. Mean changes from baseline in LDL-C of -38.8% and -53.7% were observed for pooled SIMVA and pooled EZE/SIMVA respectively. The between treatment difference of -14.9% (95% confidence interval: -16.4, -13.3) was statistically significant (p < 0.001). The incremental LDL-C lowering effect of EZE/SIMVA compared with the corresponding dose of SIMVA alone was consistent across the dose range (p < 0.001 for each between-group comparison). More patients receiving EZE/SIMVA than SIMVA achieved LDL-C concentrations < 100 mg/dl and < 70 mg/dl (p < 0.001 for both goals). EZE/SIMVA was generally well tolerated with a safety profile similar to SIMVA monotherapy. There were no significant between-group differences in the incidences of clinically significant elevations in liver transaminase or creatine kinase levels. In conclusion, EZE/SIMVA had a comparable safety and tolerability profile and was more efficacious than SIMVA monotherapy for up to 6 months.", 
    "111": "Monascus-fermented red mold dioscorea (RMD) was proven to produce higher monacolin K levels than red mold rice (RMR) in our previous study. The goal of this study is to investigate whether the novel RMD had more hypolipidemic and antiatherosclerotic effect than traditional red mold rice. The daily dose of RMR for adults was recommended as 1 g, which corresponded to 96 mg/kg/day for hamsters. Therefore, high cholesterol diet-induced hyperlipidemic hamsters were daily administrated with a 0.5-fold (48 mg/kg/day), a 1-fold (96 mg/kg/day), or a 5-fold dose (480 mg/kg/day) of RMD for 8 weeks. Furthermore, a 1-fold dose of RMR (96 mg/kg/day) and unfermented dioscorea (96 mg/kg/day) were also respectively used to evaluate the effect of hypolipidemic and antiarteriosclerosis. The results indicated that only needing a 0.5-fold dose of RMD was able to significantly lower total cholesterol (by 13.78%, p<0.001), triglyceride (by 38.74%, p<0.01), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (by 43.11%, p<0.05) as well as maintain a high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, as compared to the hyperlipidemic group. RMD including a higher monacolin K level and a dioscorea substrate was able to exhibit a more significant difference in the hypolipidemic effect than RMR or unfermented dioscorea. Both RMR and dioscorea exhibited potent in vitro antioxidative ability and in vivo protection against hypolipidemia-induced oxidative stress. Therefore, the antioxidative ability of RMD provided by Monascus metabolites (dimerumic acid, tannin, phenol, etc.) as well as dioscorea was able to perform more antiatherosclerotic effects on increasing total antioxidant status, catalase, and superoxide dismutase activity and repressing lipid peroxidation and atherosclerotic plaque than RMR and dioscorea.", 
    "112": "In most developed and developing countries, the proportion of the population aged 60 years or more is growing faster than any other age group. Given that the vast majority of cardiovascular events occur in older individuals, new thinking is needed to reduce their risk. Epidemiological studies have shown an increasing prevalence of the metabolic syndrome with age, driven by nutrition inappropriate for a modern sedentary lifestyle. A low level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, a component of the atherogenic dyslipidaemia of the metabolic syndrome, has been shown to be an important determinant of coronary risk, which rises in prevalence with increasing age. Thus, raising HDLcholesterol, in addition to lowering the level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, seems a plausible approach to reduce cardiovascular risk in an ageing population. Clinical studies have shown that adding nicotinic acid, which raises HDL-cholesterol by 20-25%, to a statin enhances the reduction in progression of atherosclerosis. Results of the ongoing Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic syndrome with low HDL/High triglyceride and Impact on Global Health Outcomes (AIM-HIGH) study are awaited with interest to see whether such theoretical benefit translates into clinical outcome.",

We describe here a prospective study of 347 consecutive patients referred for elective CABG. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed and metabolic risk factors and hypertension were determined pre-operatively. Compliance to treatment guidelines was calculated. From the total of 347 patients, 80 patients (23%) had known and 66 (19%) had previously unknown diabetes. Dysglycaemia (that is, diabetes and pre-diabetes) was found in 194 (73%) of the 267 patients without known diabetes. Among patients with dysglycaemia, 111/274 (41%) received one antihypertensive medication, or none, and blood pressure guidelines were met in 39/274 (14%); statins were being taken by 206 (75%; average dose 23 mg simvastatin) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol guidelines were met in 43 (16%). In conclusion, diabetes diagnosis and titration of risk factor treatment to guidelines is inadequate even in elective CABG patients. A pre-admission OGTT affords an opportunity to improve care significantly.",

Therefore, the purpose of this study was to characterize the effects of losartan, simvastatin, and their combination on the progression of hypertension in the spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Also, we determined whether diet influenced the drug responses. Rats were fed three different diets - low-salt (LS), high-salt (HS), and lipid-rich (LR) - and treated with either no drug (control), losartan (LOS, 10 mg/kg/day), simvastatin (SIM, 2 mg/kg/day) or LOS combined with SIM for four weeks. After four weeks on the diets, systolic blood pressure rose in all groups and remained elevated. Treatment with LOS alone or in combination with SIM reduced BP in the rats fed the LS and HS diet, respectively. Furthermore, LOS alone increased NO in the LS and LR groups; however, LOS combined with SIM completely abolished this rise in NO in LS group. Plasma PGI2 and TXA2 levels were increased in the presence of SIM alone; however LOS combined with SIM completely blocked SIM-induced increases in PGI2 and TXA2. Kidney levels of angiotensin II were higher in the LS group and significantly increased in the HS group following treatment with LOS alone. However, kidney aldosterone levels were significantly reduced in the presence of LOS in the HS group. Total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides were significantly higher in the LR group. Together, these data suggest a contribution of endogenous NO and PGs in the antihypertensive effect of LOS and SIM that may be affected by the type of diet.", 
    "115": "Understanding the complex mechanisms underlying bone remodeling is crucial to the development of novel therapeutics. Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) localised to the extracellular matrix (ECM) of bone are thought to play a key role in mediating aspects of bone development. The influence of isolated GAGs was studied by utilising in vitro murine calvarial monolayer and organ culture model systems. Addition of GAG preparations extracted from the cell surface of human osteoblasts at high concentrations (5 microg/ml) resulted in decreased proliferation of cells and decreased suture width and number of bone lining cells in calvarial sections. When we investigated potential interactions between the growth factors fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2), bone morphogenic protein-2 (BMP2) and transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGFbeta1) and the isolated cell surface GAGs, differences between the two model systems emerged. The cell culture system demonstrated a potentiating role for the isolated GAGs in the inhibition of FGF2 and TGFbeta1 actions. In contrast, the organ culture system demonstrated an enhanced stimulation of TFGbeta1 effects. These results emphasise the role of the ECM in mediating the interactions between GAGs and growth factors during bone development and suggest the GAG preparations contain potent inhibitory or stimulatory components able to mediate growth factor activity.",

The immediate influence of statins on lipid levels in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is, however, not clear. A total of 64 consecutive patients with ACS were randomized at admission to fluvastatin 80 mg (Group 1, N = 32) or standard therapy without statin (Group 2, N = 32). The levels of total cholesterol (TC), low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides (TG) were examined at admission and after 24 h. Baseline characteristics were comparable in both groups. In Group 1, fluvastatin significantly decreased the levels of TC by 14.5%, LDL-C by 17.2%, and HDL-C by 10.0% (P < 0.001); TG were not influenced. In Group 2 only marginal reductions in TC (by 4.1%, P = 0.03) and HDL-C (by 7.5%, P < 0.01) were detected; the levels of LDL-C and TG were not changed. As compared with Group 2, in Group 1 the final levels of TC (P = 0.02) and LDL-C (P = 0.01) were significantly lower. Fluvastatin therapy, when started at admission in patients with ACS, significantly reduces TC and LDL-C already after 24 h. We suggest that the lipid-lowering effect of statins in the therapy of ACS is probably as prompt as non-lipid effects.",

For that reason, we have investigated the influence of short-term administration of quinapril on serum IL-6 concentration. 124 patients suffering from stable CAD and matched for some of CAD risk factors were enrolled in our study. Patients were randomized to treatment with quinapril or control (placebo administration). Blood samples were taken twice: before and after four weeks of quinapril administration. The effect of quinapril administration was assessed under double-blind placebo-controlled conditions. We observed that quinapril reduced serum IL-6 concentration in almost all studied subgroups of patients (p < 0.001). Interestingly, such an effect was not observed in smokers. Additionally, we found that baseline IL-6 levels were higher in: smokers as compared with nonsmokers (p < 0.001), patients with total cholesterol (TC) to high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol ratio (TC/HDL-ch ratio) above 5 as compared with subjects with TC/HDL-ch < or = 5 (p = 0.001), and in patients who did not report any statin therapy in comparison with patients undergoing statin treatment (p = 0.023).

Cells exposed to lovastatin for 4 h showed a concentration dependent reduction in protein synthesis as assessed by [3H] leucine incorporation and [35S] methionine incorporation. Compared to control, lovastatin 100 microM, which produced a 25% increase in cell death, induced a three-fold reduction in methionine incorporation. [35S] methionine autoradiography showed little (new) protein synthesis at concentrations of lovastatin of 70 microM or higher; an effect that was not limited to specific proteins. Cardiomyocytes treated with lovastatin showed morphologic changes in the nucleoli consistent with insufficient protein synthesis. These cardiomyocytes manifested cell death under conditions of reduced protein synthesis. Interruption of protein synthesis with cycloheximide, a ribosomal RNA transcription inhibitor or reduction in protein substrate availability by lowering the media concentration of fetal calf serum was associated with a concentration-dependent reductions in cell viability.

However, statin-mediated AD protection cannot be fully explained by reduction of cholesterol levels. In addition to their cholesterol lowering effects, statins have pleiotropic actions and act to lower the concentrations of isoprenoid intermediates, such as geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate and farnesyl pyrophosphate. The Rho and Rab family small G-proteins require addition of these isoprenyl moieties at their C termini for normal GTPase function. In neuroblastoma cell lines, treatment with statins inhibits the membrane localization of Rho and Rab proteins at statin doses as low as 200 nm, without affecting cellular cholesterol levels. In addition, we show for the first time that at low, physiologically relevant, doses statins preferentially inhibit the isoprenylation of a subset of GTPases. The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is proteolytically cleaved to generate beta-amyloid (Abeta), which is the major component of senile plaques found in AD. We show that inhibition of protein isoprenylation by statins causes the accumulation of APP within the cell through inhibition of Rab family proteins involved in vesicular trafficking. Moreover, inhibition of Rho family protein function reduces levels of APP C-terminal fragments due to enhanced lysosomal dependent degradation. Statin inhibition of protein isoprenylation results in decreased Abeta secretion. In summary, we show that statins selectively inhibit GTPase isoprenylation at clinically relevant doses, leading to reduced Abeta production in an isoprenoid-dependent manner. These studies provide insight into the mechanisms by which statins may reduce AD pathogenesis.", 
    "146": "The mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) inhibitors sirolimus (SRL) and everolimus (EVL) are potent immunosuppressive agents, which allow reducing the dose of the nephrotoxic calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporin and tacrolimus (TAC) in solid organ transplant recipients. However, there is evidence that mTOR inhibitors may lead to myelosuppression and dyslipidemia/hyperlipidemia. We therefore performed a retrospective analysis in heart transplant recipients with renal insufficiency, who received 3.0 mg/d SRL (SRL group; n = 28) or 1.5 mg/d EVL (EVL group; n = 27) each in combination with a reduced TAC dose for at least one yr. Fewer cardiac rejections, but a similar rate of infections occurred in the EVL group compared with the SRL group indicating that the administered EVL dose resulted in a potent immunosuppression. Serum triglyceride and total cholesterol concentrations rose significantly in the SRL group but not in the EVL group. In the SRL group only, the frequency of statin use increased significantly during follow-up. The EVL group showed a significant rise in HDL cholesterol levels during follow-up. There was a slight transient fall in haemoglobin concentrations in the SRL group but not in the EVL group. Leucocyte counts fell significantly in both study groups. However, no cases of leucopenia and also no cases of thrombopenia occurred. In summary, we could demonstrate that in heart transplant recipients with renal insufficiency the introduction of 1.5 mg/d EVL in combination with a reduced TAC dose is effective in preventing cardiac rejections and has less adverse effects on lipid metabolism than the usually prescribed SRL dose, whereas both therapy regimens are not associated with major haematological side-effects.", 
    "147": "1. In the present study, we evaluated fibrate-mediated potentiation of statin-induced apoptosis in IM-9 human lymphoblasts. 2. The pro-apoptotic effects of statin and fibrate were measured by flow cytometry with biotin-annexin V, followed by addition of avidin-fluorescein isothiocyanate and propidium iodide. Apoptosis was confirmed using karyopyknotic staining, as well as detection of DNA fragmentation and caspase 3 activation. 3. Incubation of IM-9 cells with both 0.1 micromol/L cerivastatin and 200 micromol/L clofibrate had a synergistic effect compared with 0.1 micromol/L cerivastatin alone or 200 micromol/L clofibrate alone. The magnitude of apoptosis induced by various combinations of statins and clofibrate were as follows: cerivastatin (0.1 micromol/L) + clofibrate (200 micromol/L) > atorvastatin (0.1 micromol/L) + clofibrate (200 micromol/L) > pravastatin (100 micromol/L) + clofibrate (200 micromol/L). Other fibrates (bezafibrate and clinofibrate) did not show any synergistic effect. Furthermore, karyopyknotic staining, caspase 3 activation and DNA fragmentation demonstrated synergistic pro-apoptotic effects of statin and fibrate. 4. The results of the present study suggest that simultaneous treatment with statins and clofibrate could provide improved therapeutic efficacy in leukaemia patients.", 
    "148": "Evidence based goals for the treatment and prevention of atherosclerosis in diabetes are given in international and national guidelines. The importance of optimal control of lipids and blood pressure has been shown in several studies. With available drugs and behavioural modifications the treatment goals can be reached in most cases. However, only a few patients with diabetes are treated optimally today. A major possibility to reduce cardiovascular disease in diabetes is to treat patients according to guidelines. New treatment targets may include specific treatment of the dyslipidaemia, manifested in high levels of small dense LDL and low HDL, active anti-inflammatory treatments, specific reduction of inflammatory activity in adipose tissue, reduced volume of adipose tissue, antioxidants and reduction of advanced glycosylation endproducts production. Possible strategies for these treatments are available, and should be evaluated in clinical trials.", 
    "149": "Current treatment guidelines highlight the importance of aggressive lipid-modifying therapy in reducing cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes. Statins are established as the cornerstone of dyslipidaemia management in diabetic patients, based on their efficacy in lowering levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). However, statins fail to address the high residual cardiovascular risk in treated patients, some of which may be attributable to low HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) and elevated triglycerides and to a preponderance of small, dense LDL particles, indicating the need for further intervention. Fibrates are effective against all components of atherogenic dyslipidaemia associated with type 2 diabetes. Clinical studies, most notably the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes, indicate that fibrates, most likely in combination with a statin, have a secondary role in reducing cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes, particularly in those without prior cardiovascular disease or patients with low HDL-C. Results are awaited from the ongoing Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes trial to fully evaluate the outcome benefits of this combination strategy.", 
    "150": "Macrophage-derived lipases are associated with atherosclerosis in human and animal studies. Despite numerous non-lipid-lowering effects of statins, their effect on macrophage LPL and endothelial lipase (EL) expression has not been investigated. In the present study, atorvastatin and simvastatin dose-dependently decreased LPL and EL expression as well as Rho, liver X receptor alpha (LXRalpha), and nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation in THP-1 macrophages. Atorvastatin-reduced LPL and EL expression was only partially recovered by mevalonate cotreatment, indicating that mechanisms independent of reductase inhibition may be present. By contrast, Rho activation by lysophosphatidyl acid further decreased LPL and EL expression in the presence or absence of atorvastatin. Another Rho activator, farnysyl pyrophosphate, decreased EL expression only in the absence of atorvastatin. LXRalpha activation by T0901317 and 22(R)-hydroxycholesterol not only rescued but also significantly increased LPL expression in the presence and absence of atorvastatin, respectively, whereas LXRalpha inhibition by 22(S)-hydroxycholesterol decreased LPL expression. By contrast, EL expression was suppressed by LXRalpha activation in the presence or absence of atorvastatin. NF-kappaB inhibition by SN50 was associated with an approximately 30% reduction of EL expression. Furthermore, atorvastatin treatment significantly attenuated the lipid accumulation in macrophages treated with oxidized LDL. We conclude that atorvastatin reduces LPL and EL expression by reducing the activation of LXRalpha and NF-kappaB, respectively.",

There were no associations between F(2)-isoprostanes or tocopherols and CCA-IMT in this study.",

In addition, various findings suggest that statins also exert anti-inflammatory properties and may so play a role in modulating the immune system. Because of these properties, statins could provide a potential treatment for various chronic inflammatory diseases, including neuroinflammatory disorders such as multiple sclerosis. Here, we will review the effect of statins on the expression and function of a variety of immune relevant molecules and the underlying mechanisms that contribute to the immunomodulatory properties of statins. In this discussion we will also evaluate the effects of statins on central nervous system cells to emphasize the potential of these agents in the treatment of neuroinflammatory disorders.", 
    "155": "Several studies suggested that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma). Atorvastatin (ATV) increases myocardial levels of prostaglandins (PG) by upregulating and activating cytosolic-phospholipase-A(2) and cycloxygenase-2 (COX2). We investigated whether ATV activates PPAR-gamma via 15-deoxy-delta-12,14-PGJ(2) (15DPGJ(2)) an endogenous ligand of PPAR-gamma and a product of PGD(2), and to compare the effects of pioglitazone (PIO), a known direct PPAR-gamma activator, to that of ATV. First we measured myocardial 15DPGJ(2) levels in the rat heart after a 3-day pretreatment with oral ATV (10 mg/(kg d)), PIO (10 mg/(kg d)), ATV+PIO, ATV+COX1 inhibitor, and ATV+COX2 inhibitor. We also assessed in human umbilical venous endothelial cells (HUVEC) whether ATV and PIO activate PPAR-gamma via 15DPGJ(2) using siRNA targeted to PGD(2) synthase. Both 15DPGJ(2) levels and PPAR-gamma activation were assessed. ATV and PIO increased myocardial 15DPGJ(2) levels in the rat myocardium and HUVEC. siRNA inhibited this increase in both groups. Both ATV and PIO augmented PPAR-gamma activation while co-treatment with siRNA completely blocked the ATV effect but only partially inhibited the PIO effect. In conclusion, both ATV and PIO activate PPAR-gamma and increase myocardial 15DPGJ(2) levels. Activation of PPAR-gamma by ATV is mediated solely by 15DPGJ(2), whereas PIO activates PPAR-gamma both directly and indirectly via 15DPGJ(2).", 
    "156": "After Murry et al (Circulation 1986;74:1124) described ischemic preconditioning in 1986, numerous pharmacologic agents with effects simulating ischemic preconditioning have been identified. With the exception of beta-blockers, most such agents have no proven clinical benefit in the setting of myocardial ischemia. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) have been consistently demonstrated to reduce myocardial injury, morbidity, and mortality in the clinical setting, both perioperatively and after percutaneous coronary intervention. Although the precise mechanism underlying their additional protective effect is not yet fully understood, it appears to be immediate in action and independent of cholesterol lowering. Experimental data from several animal models of ischemia and reperfusion have demonstrated an infarct size reduction with prior statin administration. At the cellular level, statins activate the phosphoinositol-3 kinase and Akt signaling cascade. Statins also increase expression and activity of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, inducible nitric oxide synthase, ecto-5'-nucleotidase, cyclooxygenase-2, and other prostaglandin synthesis pathway enzymes. However, when given by oral route to animals, relatively high dose of statins is needed to exert maximal protective effect. Understanding the underlying mechanism may enable to maximize the protective effect by using drug combination with synergistic activity and to avoid medications that may interfere with the protective effect of statins (ie, selective and nonselective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition). Future clinical applications include preoperative and periprocedural risk reduction.",

To gain more insight in mechanisms via which HMG-CoA inhibition may attenuate endothelial activation, we assessed the effects of mevastatin on eNOS expression of non- and modified-LDL treated endothelial cells and on basal and hydrogen peroxide-induced lipid peroxidation. Oxidized-LDL (Ox-LDL), but not glycated or acylated LDL decreased eNOS expression in human endothelial cells. The extent to which Ox-LDL decreases eNOS expression depends on the extent of modification of Ox-LDL. Mevastatin increased eNOS-expression, both in the presence and absence of Ox-LDL. In addition, mevastatin decreased the H(2)O(2)-induced (100 microM) lipid peroxidation in endothelial cells. This study shows that mevastatin has protective effects on endothelial cells by inducing eNOS and by inhibiting lipid peroxidation.",

Each statin was administered s.c. to mdr1a/b KO and WT mice at 3.0 mg/kg (n > or = 3 mice/time point). Blood, brain, and liver samples were harvested at 0, 0.5, 1.5, and 3 h postdose. Plasma and tissue concentrations of the acid and lactone (only the acid form was determined for pravastatin) were determined using a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry method. Both lactone and acid were observed in plasma when lactones were administered, but only acids were detected when the acid forms were administered. The plasma and liver concentrations of acid or lactone were similar between the KO and WT mice. Two- to 23-fold higher concentrations were observed in liver than in plasma, suggesting potential uptake transporters involved. A significantly higher (p < 0.05) brain penetration in the KO compared with the WT mice was observed for lovastatin acid (but the brain/plasma ratio was low for both KO and WT mice) and lactone and simvastatin lactone but not for atorvastatin or pravastatin. The present results suggest that mouse P-glycoprotein does not affect the lactone-acid interconversion or liver-plasma distribution. Furthermore, P-glycoprotein plays a limited role in restricting the brain penetration of the acid forms of atorvastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin, lovastatin, and atorvastatin lactone but may limit the brain availability of the lactone forms of simvastatin and lovastatin.", 
    "178": "Bisphosphonates are widely used inhibitors of bone resorption. They also inhibit the growth of various cancer cells in vitro, but the clinical significance of this effect is unclear. The cancer growth inhibitory effects of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates, (i.e. zoledronate) have been attributed to their ability to inhibit the mevalonate pathway. We have shown that bisphosphonates also induce p38 activation, which signals resistance against the drug-induced growth inhibition through an unknown mechanism. We show here that zoledronate induces a G1/S cell cycle arrest in human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Furthermore, p38 inhibitor augments bisphosphonate-induced growth inhibition by inducing an additional G2-phase cell cycle arrest. We also show that the nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate-induced effects on p38 phosphorylation occur before accumulation of unprenylated Rap1A or Rac1 activation. Geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, an end-product of the mevalonate pathway, reversed the accumulation of unprenylated Rap1A but not phosphorylation of p38. Geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate also reversed n-BP induced growth inhibition, but the completeness of this reversal was nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate concentration dependent. Also mevastatin induced the accumulation of unprenylated Rap1A, but it did not induce p38 phosphorylation. In conclusion, our results suggest that in addition to the previously reported effects on apoptosis, nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates also inhibit the growth of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells by inducing G1/S cell cycle arrest. The bisphosphonate-induced p38 activation signals for resistance against these drugs, by promoting progression through the G2/M-checkpoint. Of these pathways only growth inhibition is mediated via inhibition of the mevalonate pathway in MDA-MB-231 cells. Combining p38 inhibitors with bisphosphonates may result in increased anti-cancer efficacy.",

    "183": "Using dioscorea root as substrate of Monascus species was found to stimulate monacolin K (cholesterol-lowering agent) formation in our previous study, but the mycotoxin-citrinin has never been studied. This study used dioscorea root as the liquid medium to culture Monascus purpureus NTU 568 using a 6.6 L jar fermentor. Culture pH value, dioscorea concentration, and ethanol concentration were used as the factors of response surface methodology (RSM) to investigate the optimal culture condition for high monacolin K production and low citrinin formation. Monacolin K and citrinin formation of M. purpureus NTU 568 under submerged dioscorea medium were respectively found to be significantly formed by 148% and 147%, as compared to that under submerged rice medium. The reason is due to the pH value (3.5) of dioscorea medium involved in the formation of Monascus cell amount and secondary metabolite. RSM results further indicated that lowering the pH value to 2.5 would result in high monacolin K and citrinin concentrations as well as high biomass in fixed dioscorea amount, implying that pH value may stimulate the formation of monacolin K and citrinin through increasing Monascus cell amount. Lowering dioscorea and ethanol concentration was able to increase the ratio of monacolin K level to citrinin level. The optimal culture condition (pH 5.7, 1% dioscorea concentration, and 0.5% ethanol concentration) would increase monacolin K levels to 27.9 mg/g (by 47%) and decrease citrinin level to 2.15 microg/g (by 54%), as compared to control conditions (pH 3.5, 5% dioscorea, and ethanol free).", 
    "184": "Statins are drugs well known for their cholesterol-lowering properties. Lately, statins have been shown to possess anti-inflammatory properties that might be attributed to inhibition of leukocyte adhesion and migration to sites of inflammation. Therefore, we have explored the effects of administration of simvastatin (30 mg/kg body weight given i.p. once a day, from days 4-14) on the development of diabetes induced by multiple low-dose streptozotocin (MLDS) in CD-1 mice, a type 1 diabetes model. We found that treatment with simvastatin could delay and in certain mice fully protect against MLDS-induced diabetes. The protective effect could last up to 3 weeks after simvastatin treatment was ended. Morphological examinations of the pancreas suggest that simvastatin might reduce the islet inflammation. Based on experiments in vitro, using isolated pancreatic islets, we conclude that the protective effect of simvastatin is not mediated by a direct effect on streptozotocin action but rather the result of an immunomodulatory effect. This was reinforced by the finding that simvastatin treatment also prolonged islet function in the recurrence of disease model in diabetic nonobese diabetic mice.", 
    "185": "Endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase represents one mechanism by which cholesterol synthesis is controlled in mammalian cells. The key reaction in this degradation is binding of reductase to Insig proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, which is stimulated by the cholesterol precursor lanosterol. Conversion of lanosterol to cholesterol requires removal of three methyl groups, which consumes nine molecules of dioxygen. Here, we report that oxygen deprivation (hypoxia) slows demethylation of lanosterol and its metabolite 24,25-dihydrolanosterol, causing both sterols to accumulate in cells. In addition, hypoxia increases the amount of Insig-1 and Insig-2 in a response mediated by hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1alpha. Accumulation of lanosterol together with increased Insigs accelerates degradation of reductase, which ultimately slows a rate-determining step in cholesterol synthesis. These results define a novel oxygen-sensing mechanism mediated by the combined actions of methylated intermediates in cholesterol synthesis and the hypoxia-activated transcription factor HIF-1alpha.",
