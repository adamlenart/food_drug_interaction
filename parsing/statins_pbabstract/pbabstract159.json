Lipid profile, glucose metabolism markers (fasting and 2-h post-glucose challenge glucose levels, HOMA-IR and glycated hemoglobin), plasma CRP levels and the release of interleukin-2 and interferon-\u03b3 by phytohemagglutinin-stimulated T lymphocytes were determined before and after 30 and 90 days of simvastatin administration (20 mg daily). Phytohemagglutinin-stimulated T cells from both IGT and mixed dyslipidemic subjects released significantly higher amounts of both cytokines than lymphocytes of 30 dyslipidemia-free individuals with normal glucose tolerance. Despite improving the lipid profile, simvastatin produced no effects on glucose metabolism markers in either treatment groups. The drug normalized the lymphocyte cytokine release and plasma hsCRP in mixed dyslipidemic patients but not in IGT patients. Our study indicates that the presence of mixed dyslipidemia and IGT is associated with the enhanced secretory function of human lymphocytes. Simvastatin is an effective lymphocyte-suppressing agent in mixed dyslipidemic patients but not in IGT patients.", 
    "1": "Rifampin and carbamazepine have been recommended in the U.S. Food and Drug Administration draft drug interaction guidance as CYP3A4 inducers for clinical drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies. To optimize the dose regimens of these inducers for use in DDI studies, their effect at various doses and dosing durations on the area under the curve (AUC) of multiple probe substrates was simulated using a population-based simulator. A similar assessment of the inducer phenobarbital was also conducted. CYP3A4 induction by all three inducers was previously determined in hepatocytes, and the results were incorporated into simulations. The pharmacokinetics of the three inducers and their associated CYP3A4 drug interactions were predicted and compared with in vivo observations. The predicted C(max) and AUC of all the inducers and substrates correlated closely with those observed clinically. The predicted magnitudes of the DDIs caused by CYP3A4 induction were also in good agreement with the observed clinical results. Comparison of the maximal CYP3A4 induction potential among the three inducers indicated that rifampin is the most potent inducer and is the best choice for clinical CYP3A4 induction DDI studies. Moreover, a near-maximal CYP3A4 DDI was predicted to result from administration of rifampin for approximately 7 days at 450 to 600 mg q.d. or 200 to 300 mg b.i.d. These results suggest optimal dose regimens for clinical trials that maximize the probability of detecting a DDI caused by CYP3A4 induction. The simulation strategy provides the means to predict the induction profiles of compounds in development.", 
    "2": "Streptococcus pyogenes of the M1 serotype can cause streptococcal toxic shock syndrome and acute lung injury. Statins exert beneficial effects in septic patients although the mechanisms remain elusive. This study examined effects of simvastatin on M1 protein-provoked pulmonary inflammation and tissue injury. Male C57BL/6 mice were pretreated with simvastatin or a CXCR2 antagonist before M1 protein challenge. Bronchoalveolar fluid and lung tissue were harvested for determination of neutrophil infiltration, formation of edema, and CXC chemokines. Flow cytometry was used to determine Mac-1 expression on neutrophils. Gene expression of CXC chemokines was determined in alveolar macrophages by using quantitative RT-PCR. M1 protein challenge caused massive infiltration of neutrophils, edema formation, and production of CXC chemokines in the lung as well as upregulation of Mac-1 on circulating neutrophils. Simvastatin reduced M1 protein-induced infiltration of neutrophils and edema in the lung. In addition, M1 protein-induced Mac-1 expression on neutrophils was abolished by simvastatin. Furthermore, simvastatin markedly decreased pulmonary formation of CXC chemokines and gene expression of CXC chemokines in alveolar macrophages. Moreover, the CXCR2 antagonist reduced M1 protein-induced neutrophil expression of Mac-1 and accumulation of neutrophils as well as edema formation in the lung. These novel findings indicate that simvastatin is a powerful inhibitor of neutrophil infiltration in acute lung damage triggered by streptococcal M1 protein. The inhibitory effect of simvastatin on M1 protein-induced neutrophil recruitment appears related to reduced pulmonary generation of CXC chemokines. Thus, simvastatin may be a useful tool to ameliorate acute lung injury in streptococcal infections.",

We cross-referenced preexisting incidence cohorts from the Rochester Epidemiology Project for TIA (1985-1994) and MI (1979-2006) to identify all community residents with incident MI after incident TIA. Incidence of MI after TIA was determined using Kaplan-Meier life-table methods. This was compared to the age-, sex-, and period-specific MI incidences in the general population. Proportional hazards regression analysis was used to examine associations between clinical variables and the occurrence of MI after TIA.",

    "7": "In March, 2010, a group of breast cancer experts met to develop a consensus statement on breast cancer prevention, with a focus on medical and therapeutic interventions. We present the conclusions in this Review. First we agreed that the term chemoprevention is inappropriate and suggested that the term preventive therapy better represents this feature of management. Two selective oestrogen-receptor modulators--tamoxifen and raloxifene--are so far the only medical options approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for preventive therapy. Of these tamoxifen has greater efficacy and can be used in premenopausal women, but raloxifene has fewer side-effects. Two newer drugs in this class, lasofoxifene and arzoxifene, also show efficacy and possibly a better overall risk-benefit profile, but need further assessment. Aromatase inhibitors might be more efficacious, and results of prevention trials are eagerly awaited. Newer agents, notably bisphosphonates and metformin, have shown promise in observational studies and need to be assessed in randomised prevention trials. Other agents, such as aspirin, other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, COX-2 inhibitors, retinoids, rexinoids, and dietary components have limited effects or are in the early phases of investigation. New contralateral tumours in women with breast cancer might be generally useful as a model for prevention, as has been seen for tamoxifen. If valid such a model would facilitate the design of simpler, cheaper, and better-focused trials for assessing new agents.",

    "9": "The purpose of the present substudy of the Lipid Treatment Assessment Project 2 was to assess dual C-reactive protein (CRP) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol goal attainment across a spectrum of low-, moderate-, and high-risk patients with dyslipidemia in 8 countries in North America, Latin America, Europe, and Asia. Of the 9,518 patients studied overall, 45% were women, 64% had hypertension, 31% had diabetes, 14% were current smokers, 60% were high risk, and 79% were taking a statin. The median CRP level was 1.5 mg/L (interquartile range 0.2 to 2.8). On multivariate analysis, higher CRP levels were associated with older age, female gender, hypertension, current smoking, greater body mass index, larger waist circumference, LDL cholesterol level, and triglyceride/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio. In contrast, being from Asia or taking a statin was associated with lower levels. Across all risk groups, 59% of patients attained the CRP target of <2 mg/L, and 33% had <1 mg/L. Overall, 44% of patients attained both their National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III LDL cholesterol target and a CRP level of <2 mg/L, but only 26% attained their LDL cholesterol target and a CRP level of <1 mg/L. In the very high-risk group with coronary heart disease and \u22652 risk factors, only 19% attained both their LDL cholesterol goal and a CRP level of <2 mg/L and 12% their LDL cholesterol goal and a CRP level of <1 mg/L. In conclusion, with current treatment, most dyslipidemic patients do not reach the dual CRP and LDL cholesterol goals. Smoking cessation, weight reduction, and the greater use of more potent statins at higher doses might be able to improve these outcomes.",

Unadjusted and adjusted Cox-proportional hazard models were used to analyze predictive value of discharge RDW on mortality. There was a significant negative association between RDW and statin use, blood hemoglobin levels and mean corpuscular volume (MCV); whereas serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) increased with increasing RDW. A statistically significant graded increase in all-cause mortality with higher RDW quartiles (lowest vs highest quartile), independent of hemoglobin and creatinine levels, was found for all patients (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 3.21; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.77-5.83, P < .05) for AAs (adjusted HR 2.92; 95% CI: 1.50-5.71, P < .05) and for non-AAs (adjusted HR-1.27, 95% CI: 1.03-1.55, P = 0.019; RDW evaluated as continuous variable).",

    "13": "Endoglin (a type III TGF-\u03b2 receptor) is able to modulate ligand binding and signaling by association with the TGF-\u03b2 type I receptors (ALK-1 and ALK-5). In this study, we hypothesized whether atorvastatin treatment affects endoglin/ALK-1/p-Smad1/VEGF expression in the aorta and endoglin levels in serum in ApoE/LDLR double knockout mice. ApoE/LDLR double knockout mice were fed with a diet containing either 1% of cholesterol (CHOL) or cholesterol with atorvastatin (ATV) at a dose of 50mg/kg/day. Biochemical analysis of cholesterol levels and ELISA analysis of endoglin levels in serum, lesion area size, immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis in mice aorta were performed. Atorvastatin treatment resulted in a significant decrease of total, VLDL and LDL cholesterol, atherosclerotic lesion size and endoglin serum levels in comparison with CHOL mice. On the other hand, atorvastatin treatment significantly increased the expressions of endoglin by 1431%, ALK-1 by 310%, p-Smad1 by 135% and VEGF by 62% in aorta when compared to CHOL mice. In conclusion, it has been demonstrated that atorvastatin increases endoglin/ALK-1/p-Smad1/VEGF expression in aorta and decreases the size of atherosclerotic lesions, suggesting that activation of this endothelial-protective pathway might support the antiatherogenic effects of atorvastatin. Moreover, atorvastatin concurrently decreased serum levels of endoglin suggesting that monitoring of endoglin levels in blood might represent an important marker of the progression and/or treatment of atherosclerosis.", 
    "14": "The study was designed to examine whether the hydrophilic statin - pravastatin and the hydrophobic statin - simvastatin affect colon cancer cell-induced cytokine secretion by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Statins were added to human colon cancer cells (HT-29 and RKO), or to PBMC incubated separately or jointly. The secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and IFN\u03b3 and that of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-1ra and IL-10 induced by cancer cells was decreased by simvastatin but not by pravastatin, whereas that of IL-6 was not affected by both drugs. Conditioned media from colon cancer cells incubated with either simvastatin or pravastatin induced stimulation of cytokine production by PBMC similar to that caused by conditioned media derived from cancer cells incubated without the drugs, suggesting that simvastatin acts directly on the interaction between cancer and PBM cells. Simvastatin, but not pravastatin, caused inhibition of both cancer cell proliferation. The results imply that simvastatin may affect inflammation-induced colon cancer proliferation via alteration of the equilibrium between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines.", 
    "15": "Statins are the primary agents used to decrease low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Although adherence to statins improves the clinical outcomes, the affect of statin adherence on healthcare costs has not been well studied. To examine the relation among statin adherence, subsequent hospitalizations, and healthcare costs, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of 381,422 patients, aged 18 to 61 years, using an integrated pharmacy and medical claims database. We measured adherence using the medication possession ratio (MPR) for 12 months and the healthcare costs and cardiovascular disease-related hospitalizations during the subsequent 18 months. Of those studied, 258,013 (67.6%) were adherent (MPR \u226580%), 65,795 (17.3%) had an MPR of 60% to 79%, and 57,614 (15.1%) had an MPR of <60%. The adjusted all-cause total healthcare costs were lowest in the adherent group at $10,198 \u00b1 $39.4 (mean \u00b1 SE) versus $10,609 \u00b1 $77.7 (p <0.001) for an MPR of 60% to 79%, and $11,102 \u00b1 $84.3 (p <0.001) for an MPR of <60%. The adherent group had greater statin costs at $838 \u00b1 $1.0 versus $664 \u00b1 $2.0 (p <0.001) and $488 \u00b1 $2.2 (p <0.001). When evaluated by 5 levels of MPR, 0% to 59% and increments of 10% >60%, the adjusted total healthcare costs were lowest for the MPR 90% to 100% group and significantly greater statistically (p <0.001) for each lower level of adherence. Compared to the statin-adherent patients, cardiovascular disease-related hospitalizations were more likely for the patients with an MPR of 60% to 79% (odds ratio 1.12, 95% confidence interval 1.08 to 1.16) and an MPR of 0% to 59% (odds ratio 1.26, 95% confidence interval 1.21 to 1.31). In conclusion, statin adherence is associated with reductions in subsequent total healthcare costs and cardiovascular disease-related hospitalizations.", 
    "16": "Secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) is an enzyme that plays an important role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and of adverse cardiovascular events. It is currently the target of emerging therapeutic agents. Our study was designed to investigate the effect of aggressive lowering of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol with ezetimibe and atorvastatin on sPLA2 activity. We randomized 100 patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) or CAD equivalent (diabetes, stroke, or peripheral vascular disease) to receive ezetimibe 10 mg/day in association with atorvastatin 40 mg/day (combination therapy group) versus atorvastatin 40 mg/day and placebo (monotherapy group). Patients on statin therapy before inclusion were allowed to enter the study as long as the potency of the statin was lower than atorvastatin 40 mg/day. Lipid profile, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and sPLA activity were measured at baseline and after 8 weeks of therapy. The decrease in LDL cholesterol was more significant in the combination therapy group, but the decrease in hs-CRP was similar. sPLA2 activity significantly decreased in the ezetimibe/atorvastatin group from 29 U/ml (interquartile range 23 to 35) to 26 U/ml (23 to 29, p = 0.001) but remained similar in the placebo/atorvastatin group (23 U/ml, 19 to 32, vs 22 U/ml, 19 to 28, p = NS). In a multivariate stepwise linear regression model, change in sPLA2 correlated with change in hs-CRP (p <0.001), baseline LDL cholesterol level (p = 0.001), body mass index (p = 0.003), diabetes mellitus (p = 0.04) and combination therapy with ezetimibe/atorvastatin (p = 0.05). In conclusion, this study demonstrates that coadministration of ezetimibe and atorvastatin decreases sPLA2 activity.", 
    "17": "Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) causes lifelong elevated serum LDL-cholesterol. In untreated FH, the progression of coronary atherosclerosis and the risk of premature myocardial infarction are substantially increased. In addition, carotid artery atherosclerosis and the risk of ischemic brain infarction are increased. During the prestatin era, stroke may have been even 20-times more frequent among FH patients than in the general population. In the statin era, both registry studies and MRI studies suggest that the occurrence of ischemic brain damage is not increased among FH patients. It is likely that effective lowering of serum LDL-cholesterol levels made possible by statin treatment has been the key element behind the observed decrease in of the incidence of ischemic stroke. This idea is strongly supported by the results of a recent meta-analysis of controlled statin trials, in which statin treatment was demonstrated to lower the incidence of ischemic stroke among non-FH hypercholesterolemic patients.", 
    "18": "Atherogenic dyslipidemia, including low HDL levels, is the major contributor of residual risk of cardiovascular disease that remains even after aggressive statin therapy to reduce LDL-cholesterol. Currently, distinction is not made between HDL-cholesterol and HDL, which is a lipoprotein consisting of several proteins and a core containing cholesteryl esters (CEs). The importance of assessing HDL functionality, specifically its role in facilitating cholesterol efflux from foam cells, is relevant to atherogenesis. Since HDLs can only remove unesterified cholesterol from macrophages while cholesterol is stored as CEs within foam cells, intracellular CE hydrolysis by CE hydrolase is vital. Reduction in macrophage lipid burden not only attenuates atherosclerosis but also reduces inflammation and linked pathologies such as Type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Targeting reduction in macrophage CE levels and focusing on enhancing cholesterol flux from peripheral tissues to liver for final elimination is proposed.",

Among all patients, optimal levels of ApoB, HDL-C, TG, and the combined target of LDL-C + non-HDL-C + ApoB + HDL-C + TG were achieved by higher percentage of patients treated with fenofibric acid + low- and moderate-dose statin versus corresponding dose-statin monotherapies (p \u2264 0.04 for all comparisons).

In the long-term study, the proportion meeting these targets was significant, compared with baseline. Limitations include the post hoc nature of the analysis, and the fact that all patients had mixed dyslipidemia and majority were white, which limits generalization to other populations.", 
    "23": "This study investigated the role of the prostaglandin (PG) pathway in locally applied, simvastatin-induced oral bone growth. The possibility of enhancing long-term bone augmentation with an alendronate-based carrier was initiated. Mandibles of 44 mature female rats were treated bilaterally with the following combinations: 2 mg of simvastatin in ethanol (SIM-EtOH), EtOH, 2 mg of simvastatin acid complexed with alendronate-beta-cyclodextrin conjugate (SIM/ALN-CD), ALN-CD, or ALN. Bone wash technology (injection of PBS and re-collection by suction) was used to sample injection sites at baseline (day 0), and 3, 7, 14, and 21 days post-treatment. After 21-24 or 48 days, histomorphometric analysis was done. The amount of PGE(2) in bone wash fluid was measured by ELISA, normalized by total protein, and compared between high and low bone growth groups (ANOVA) and correlated with subsequent bone histology at 21 days (Spearman). SIM-stimulated PGE(2) synthase and EP4 receptor mRNA in murine osteoblast and fibroblast cell lines were evaluated with real-time PCR. Single injections of 2 mg of SIM-EtOH induced significantly more new bone than control side after 21 days. PGE(2)/protein ratios peaked at day 7 and were correlated with the subsequent 21-day new bone width. The correlations at day 14 between PGE(2) and new bone width changed to a negative relationship in the test group. SIM-stimulated osteoblasts expressed increased mRNA levels of PGE receptor EP4, while SIM activated PGE synthesis in fibroblasts. SIM/ALN-CD tended to preserve bone long-term. Findings suggest that PGE pathway activation and higher levels of PGE(2) during the first week following SIM-induced bone growth are desirable, and alendronate-beta-cyclodextrin conjugates not only act as tissue-specific carriers, but preserve new bone.",

It is a gradually progressive disease, characterized by a long asymptomatic phase that may last for several decades, followed by a short symptomatic phase associated with severe restriction of the valve orifice. Investigations on treatments for aortic valve stenosis are still in progress. Thus, it is believed that calcification of aortic valve stenosis is similar to the process of atherosclerosis that occurs in coronary artery disease.

    "26": "The approach of all ophthalmologists, diabetologists and general practitioners seeing patients with diabetic retinopathy should be that good control of blood glucose, blood pressure and plasma lipids are all essential components of modern medical management. The more recent data on the use of fenofibrate in the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) and The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) Eye studies is reviewed. In FIELD, fenofibrate (200 mg/day) reduced the requirements for laser therapy and prevented disease progression in patients with pre-existing diabetic retinopathy. In ACCORD Eye, fenofibrate (160 mg daily) with simvastatin resulted in a 40% reduction in the odds of retinopathy progressing over 4 years, compared with simvastatin alone. This occurred with an increase in HDL-cholesterol and a decrease in the serum triglyceride level in the fenofibrate group, as compared with the placebo group, and was independent of glycaemic control. We believe fenofibrate is effective in preventing progression of established diabetic retinopathy in type 2 diabetes and should be considered for patients with pre-proliferative diabetic retinopathy and/or diabetic maculopathy, particularly in those with macular oedema requiring laser.", 
    "27": "Case-control studies typically exclude fatal endpoints from the case set, which we hypothesize will substantially underestimate risk if survival is genotype-dependent. The loss of fatal cases is particularly nontrivial for studies of coronary heart disease (CHD) because of significantly reduced survival (34% one-year fatality following a coronary attack). A case in point is the KIF6 Trp719Arg polymorphism (rs20455). Whereas six prospective studies have shown that carriers of the KIF6 Trp719Arg risk allele have 20% to 50% greater CHD risk than non-carriers, several cross-sectional case-control studies failed to show that carrier status is related to CHD. Computer simulations were therefore employed to assess the impact of the loss of fatal events on gene associations in cross-sectional case-control studies, using KIF6 Trp719Arg as an example.",

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risks were assigned by the Framingham equation and events distributed among KIF6 Trp719Arg genotypes according to published prospective studies. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate odds ratios between KIF6 genotypes. Results were examined for 33%, 41.5%, and 50% fatality rates for incident CVD.In the absence of any difference in percent fatalities between genotypes, the odds ratios (carriers vs. noncarriers) were unaffected by survival bias, otherwise the odds ratios were increasingly attenuated as the disparity between fatality rates increased between genotypes. Additional simulations demonstrated that statin usage, shown in four clinical trials to substantially reduce the excess CHD risk in the KIF6 719Arg variant, should also attenuate the KIF6 719Arg odds ratio in case-control studies.", 
    "29": "These computer simulations show that exclusions of prior CHD fatalities attenuate odds ratios of case-control studies in proportion to the difference in the percent fatalities between genotypes. Disproportionate CHD survival for KIF6 Trip719Arg carriers is suggested by their 50% greater risk for recurrent myocardial infarction. This, and the attenuation of KIF6 719Arg carrier risk with statin use, may explain the genotype's weak association with CHD in cross-sectional case-control studies. The results may be relevant to the underestimation of risk in cross-sectional case-control studies of other genetic CHD-risk factors affecting survival.",

On the other hand, it is also well known that statins have pleiotropic effects; however, it still remains unclear whether statins suppress osteoblastic cell dysfunction or cytotoxicity induced by uremic toxins. To elucidate whether statins ameliorate osteoblast dysfunction induced by uremic toxins, we conducted an in vitro study using primary cultured osteoblastic cells from mouse calvariae. Indoxyl sulfate induced reactive oxygen species production and reduced cell viability in osteoblastic cells in a dose dependent manner.

Treatment with statins leads to significant low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering, resulting in reductions in major coronary and vascular events. Statins are generally well tolerated and safe; however, their use is complicated by infrequent, but often serious, muscular adverse events. For many statins, both efficacy and risk of adverse muscle events can be influenced by membrane transporters, which are important determinants of statin disposition. Genetic polymorphisms and drug-drug interactions (DDIs) involving organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1 and breast cancer resistance protein have shown the capacity to reduce the activity of these transporters, resulting in changes in LDL-C lowering by statins, as well as changes in the frequency of adverse muscle events associated with their use. This review presents evidence for how reduced transporter activity impacts the safety and pharmacology of statins. It expands on the scope of other recent statin reviews by providing recommendations on in vitro evaluation of statin interaction potential, discussing how reduced transporter activity impacts statin management during drug development, and proposing ideas on how to evaluate the impact of DDI on statin efficacy during clinical trials. Furthermore, the potential clinical consequences of perturbing statin efficacy via DDI are discussed.",

MAPK activation in T lymphocytes, measured by phospho-ERK1/2, phospho-JNK and phospho-p38 levels, was assessed by flow cytometry analysis which revealed significantly increased phosphorylated levels of ERK1/2 in patients with UA, compared to controls. In UA patients no significant changes were detected for phospho-JNK compared to both control groups. NSTEMI and STEMI groups showed a statistically significant increase in both phospho-ERK1/2 and phospho-JNK, compared to control groups. All ACS groups demonstrated significantly increased phosphorylation of p38 compared to CTRL, but not CAD. ROC curves showed that a cut-off value of 22.5 intensity of fluorescence for phospho-ERK1/2 was able to significantly discriminate UA patients from patients with stable angina with 78% sensitivity and 90% specificity. Therefore, a differential MAPK activation in T lymphocytes denotes patients with ACS. Indeed, patients with unstable angina are identified with high specificity by activated ERK1/2 and normal JNK levels. These data could represent a valuable new molecular signature to be used as specific biomarkers for the diagnosis of unstable angina within ACS.", 
    "93": "HIV-infected patients are at an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease in the general population and are reduced by statin therapy. We examined the effect of pravastatin and rosuvastatin on CRP levels in 58 dyslipidemic HIV-infected patients. A 45-day course of either statin reduced the median CRP level from 3.0 to 2.4 mg/l (P < 0.001) with no correlation with changes in lipid parameters.", 
    "94": "Statins are drugs commonly used to inhibit cholesterol synthesis, with the goal of reducing vascular diseases such as myocardial infarction and stroke. Statins have also been suggested as a therapeutic option for Alzheimer's disease (AD), although their benefit in AD remains controversial. We have previously shown that the intracellular C-terminal cleavage of the amyloid-\u03b2 protein precursor (A\u03b2PP) is a major contributor to the neuronal toxicity seen in AD, and that this cleavage can be induced by amyloid-\u03b2. We now report that certain brain permeable statins are also able to induce the C-terminal cleavage of A\u03b2PP and associated cell death, whereas other statins do not. This statin effect on A\u03b2PP exceeded the effects of all other FDA-approved drugs in a library composed of these compounds, suggesting that this effect on A\u03b2PP cleavage is unique to a subset of the statins. Furthermore, the greatest effect occurred with cerivastatin, which has previously been shown to be the statin associated with the greatest risk of rhabdomyolysis. These results may have implications for the choice of which statins to evaluate in AD therapeutic trials; furthermore, the results may inform statin choice in individuals who are at high risk for the development of AD, such as those with an apolipoprotein E \u03b54 allele.", 
    "95": "High cardiovascular risk patients need reduction of low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) to <70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L). Statins are optimal treatment but myopathy can be a limitation to their use. The incidence of statin-related myopathy is difficult to determine but up to 10.5% appears an appropriate estimate. Short-term trials report lower incidence than long-term trials. Statin-related myopathy may be influenced by genetics and tends to be dose-dependent. Ezetimibe can contribute to LDL-C reduction allowing a lower dose of statin to be used. Another approach is to administer rosuvastatin twice weekly. Statins have been shown to interfere with the cellular role of coenzyme Q10. Coenzyme Q10 supplementation may decrease or prevent statin myopathy, but this has not been proven. The occurrence of the most serious complication of myopathy-rhabdomyolysis-is very rare, but awareness of the problem, risks, and prevention are essential.",

We discuss the value of plaque progression-regression as complementary imaging endpoint and potential surrogate marker of cardiovascular event risk. In addition, the progress in serial assessment of coronary plaque composition and plaque vulnerability by radiofrequency-based analyses is reviewed. Finally, we report on the evaluation of true vessel remodelling in recent serial IVUS trials and discuss the future perspective of serial invasive imaging of coronary atherosclerosis.", 
    "97": "Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is known to induce both local and systemic inflammatory states. In addition to lowering lipid levels, statins exert well-proven anti-inflammatory effects. We investigated the effects of pravastatin on serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and neopterin levels in the short term after elective PCI.", 
    "98": "In this randomized prospective study, 93 patients undergoing elective PCI were enrolled. Group 1 (n=30) received pravastatin at a dose of 10 mg/day, Group 2 (n=29) was given 40 mg/day, and Group 3 (n=34) served as the control group and received no lipid-lowering drugs. Blood samples were drawn before and after PCI to measure serum CRP and neopterin levels. Differences among the groups for continuous variables were evaluated by the ANOVA and the Kruskal-Wallis test as appropriate. The Chi-square test was used for comparison of categorical variables.", 
    "99": "Demographic features and the characteristics of the PCI, including the number of vessels and lesions and the duration and number of inflations, did not differ among groups (p>0.05). Serum CRP and neopterin levels were significantly increased after PCI (p<0.001). Mean serum neopterin levels before and after the PCI were as follows: Group 1: 13.3\u00b15.9 vs 22.8\u00b115.4 nmol/L, Group 2: 16.9\u00b110.2 vs 22.0\u00b114.9 nmol/L, controls: 15.2\u00b111.9 and 18.8\u00b111.5 nmol/L.

Atorvastatin was injected during or after the sensitization and challenge process to evaluate its protective or reversal effects, respectively. Total and differential cells in the BAL fluids together with IL-4, IL-5 and IL-10 cytokine levels were evaluated. Total IgE and cholesterol levels in serum were studied.", 
    "104": "In the protective phase, Atorvastatin inhibited the OVA-induced cellular infiltration of lung bronchi, decreased IL-4 and IL-5 and prevented the increase in IL-10 cytokine levels. Also, it reduced the OVA-induced high serum total IgE level. Injection of Atorvastatin after challenge was not effective in reversing the inflammatory process, with no major contribution towards augmenting the actions of Dexamethasone. The cholesterol lowering effect was marked in the protective phase while less effective for the reversal phase.",

    "106": "In contrast to cerebral cortical neurons, the extent of damage to cells of the cerebellum in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still a matter of debate. Here, we examined pathological changes in the cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) of AD model mice (amyloid precursor protein transgenic (APP-Tg) mice) at 10, 15, and 20 months (M) of age, and investigated the possible protective effect of two strong statins (atorvastatin at 30 mg/kg/day or pitavastatin at 3mg/kg/day, p.o.) by administering these statins from 5 to 20 M. The number of PCs detected by hematoxylin-eosin staining in APP-Tg mice was approximately 60% of the number in non-Tg mice at 10 M, and this progressively reduced with age until 20 M. Moreover, the number of monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1)-positive PCs and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1)-positive PCs was also reduced in the transgenics. In contrast, the APP-Tg mice treated with either of the two statins showed a significant recovery in the number of PCs, and MCP-1 (at 20 M) and TNF-\u03b1 (at 15 and 20 M) staining in PCs was preserved. Because MCP-1 and TNF-\u03b1 play important roles in maintaining the synaptic network in PCs, the present study suggests that atorvastatin and pitavastatin can maintain the number of PCs and their synaptic networks in the AD cerebellum.",

    "108": "We performed a stepwise regression model to identify independent risk factors for the occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias. Using a Cox regression model, independent risk factors for total mortality were evaluated and, subsequently, a Kaplan-Meier analysis was applied. The primary endpoint of this study was the identification of independent predictors of overall mortality and the incidence of malignant arrhythmias.",

Independent predictors of arrhythmias detected and treated by the ICD included female gender (odds ratio [OR] 3.4), lack of statin therapy (OR 3.5), and increased serum creatinine (OR 3.7). The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed no difference in survival between participants with or without VT. Total mortality was predicted by increased age (OR 2.3) and an impaired renal function (OR 1.9), independently.", 
    "110": "In this cohort of NICM patients with heart failure, female gender, lack of statin therapy, and increased creatinine represented independent risk factors for the incidence of malignant arrhythmias. Furthermore, renal insufficiency and age favored total mortality. Considering these results, impaired renal function might represent a valuable noninvasive tool to identify NICM patients who, despite ICD implantation, have the highest risk of mortality and therefore require a particularly thorough follow-up.", 
    "111": "Dyslipidemia and vascular calcification are important predictors of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Vitamin D may have an influence on these two CVD risk markers. We performed a systematic review on vitamin D, dyslipidemia, statins, vascular calcification and CVD. The vast majority of intervention studies did not show an effect of vitamin D on serum cholesterol levels. There is however evidence for a triglyceride-lowering effect of vitamin D which primarily comes from studies with chronic kidney disease patients, a group with elevated triglyceride levels. The previously presumed influence of statins on circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and on cellular vitamin D actions remains obscure. Experimental studies on vascular calcification and CVD suggest a biphasic effect of vitamin D with harmful effects at both low and high vitamin D levels. Epidemiological studies on vitamin D and vascular calcification are inconsistent at present, but are probably biased by confounding. Prospective cohort studies consistently indicate an enhanced multivariable-adjusted CVD mortality risk when circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are below 25 nmol/l. Adequately designed randomised controlled trials investigating the dose-response effect of vitamin D on different CVD outcome parameters are now warranted.", 
    "112": "Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death among elderly patients and >80% of all coronary deaths occur in patients >65 years. Cerebrovascular events are also associated with older age. Since elevated cholesterol concentrations are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, lipid-lowering drugs, especially statins, are in widespread use for prevention. There is substantial underutilization of statins in the elderly population although meta-analyses of randomized trials have shown that in elderly secondary prevention patients they reduce all-cause mortality by approximately 22%, CHD mortality by 30%, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) by 26% and stroke by 25% over a treatment period of 5 years. Relative risk reduction is greater or at least equal to the one in younger patients, but absolute risk reduction is greater in the elderly because the event rate is higher. The benefit from statin treatment seems to start beyond 1 year of treatment. Data on primary prevention in the elderly are less clear. There is a significant reduction in CHD events, CHD deaths and all-cause mortality but numbers needed to treat (NNT) are higher than in secondary prevention. Treatment decisions have to consider the individual patient's situation regarding multimorbidity, polypharmacy and patient wishes. Economic considerations have to be made in some health systems. Statins have no role in the prevention or the treatment of dementia. Statins are generally safe and safety is equal in younger and older age groups. Their prescription should not be denied to patients for reasons of age alone. Other lipid-lowering drugs play only a minor role in cardiovascular disease (CVD) event prevention because convincing outcome studies are largely missing. A primary prevention statin trial in the very elderly is urgently needed.", 
    "113": "Lowering low density lipoprotein (LDL) - cholesterol is one of the key issues in modern preventive cardiology by which we are able to interact with the natural course of atherosclerosis. Diet and healthy life style are mandatory for the treatment of CAD high risk patients. Numerous lipid lowering trials confirmed the beneficial effect of statins in primary as well as secondary prevention. By this statins are the basic treatment in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) or diabetes mellitus or both. In order to reach LDL - cholesterol target levels (LDL - cholesterol < 100 mg/dl) in patients with CAD the use of potent statins or a lipid lowering combination therapy might be necessary. In our days we are able to lower LDL-cholesterol by more than 50% with drug treatment, which should enable us to reach the optimal LDL-cholesterol level in most patients.", 
    "114": "Despite statin monotherapy, many high-risk patients are not at recommended low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals. Moreover, these patients are also likely to exhibit an atherogenic dyslipidemia characterized by decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and elevated triglycerides. As a consequence, combination lipid-altering drug therapies are frequently required to improve the lipid profile. The long-term safety and tolerability of these combination therapies are key determinants for good compliance and cardiovascular benefits.",

In statin-treated cells, ABCG1 levels remained unaltered. Ezetimibe alone did not induce change of ABCA1 or ABCG1 mRNA levels (p>0.05) but 24-h ezetimibe (2.5 or 5.0 \u03bcmol/L) plus simvastatin (1 \u03bcmol/L) treatment decreased the transcription of ABCA1 and ABCG1 (p<0.05).", 
    "120": "Our findings reveal that, at the concentrations studied, statins isolated or combined with ezetimibe, but not ezetimibe alone, downregulate ABCA1 mRNA expression in Caco-2 cells. Moreover, simvastatin combined with ezetimibe treatment also decrease the ABCG1 levels in these cells.",

Appropriate control of cardiovascular risk factors accounts for 44% of the overall reduction in mortality. The decrease in plasma cholesterol concentrations, however, remains the most effective therapeutic target, leading to a -24% reduction of total mortality. Statins have proved to be effective within the first few weeks after an acute coronary event. As a consequence, their use is recommended by current guidelines (class IB) in patients with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction.

We hypothesized that a reasonable predictive model of coronary plaque regression might be constructed using the change in the peripheral monocyte count and the serum HDL-C level. The plaque volume, as assessed by volumetric intravascular ultrasound, was measured at the baseline and after 6\u00a0months of pravastatin therapy in 114 patients with coronary artery disease. After 6 months of pravastatin therapy, a significant decrease of the plaque volume by 9.9% (p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001, vs. baseline) was observed; furthermore, a corresponding increase of the serum HDL-C level and decrease of the peripheral blood monocyte count were also seen (12.5%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01 and -7.3%, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001). In a multivariate regression analysis using the serum lipids and traditional risk factors as the covariates, the increase in the serum HDL-C (\u03b2 -0.56, p\u00a0<\u00a00.0001) and the decrease in monocyte count (\u03b2 0.23, p\u00a0=\u00a00.03) were identified as independent predictors of the plaque regression. A model for the prediction of plaque regression according to whether the achieved the change in (\u0394) monocyte count and \u0394HDL-C were above or below the median values was prepared. Among the four groups, the group with \u0394HDL-C \u22658.8% and \u0394monocyte count \u2264-8.6% showed the largest plaque regression (-20.4%), and the group with \u0394HDL-C <8.8% and \u0394monocyte count >-8.6% showed the increase of the plaque volume (2.6%).

    "136": "In ESRD, the neurohormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) may act primarily through V1a and V1b receptors, which promote vasoconstriction, myocardial hypertrophy, and release of adrenocorticotropic hormone. The preanalytical instability of AVP limits the investigation of whether this hormone associates with cardiovascular events, but the stable glycopeptide copeptin may serve as a surrogate because it is co-secreted with AVP from the posterior pituitary. Here, we studied whether copeptin predicts cardiovascular risk and mortality in ESRD. We measured copeptin at baseline in 1241 hemodialysis patients with type 2 diabetes participating in the German Diabetes and Dialysis Study. The median copeptin level was 81 pmol/L (interquartile range, 81 to 122 pmol/L). In Cox regression analyses, compared with patients with copeptin levels in the lowest quartile (\u226451 pmol/L), patients with copeptin levels in the highest quartile (>122 pmol/L) had a 3.5-fold increased risk for stroke (HR, 3.48; 95% CI: 1.71 to 7.09), a 73% higher risk for sudden death (HR, 1.73; 95% CI: 1.01 to 2.95), a 42% higher risk for combined cardiovascular events (HR, 1.42; 95% CI: 1.06 to 1.90), and a 48% higher risk for all-cause mortality (HR, 1.48; 95% CI: 1.15 to 1.90). In contrast, we did not detect significant associations between copeptin levels and risks for myocardial infarction or death caused by congestive heart failure. In conclusion, copeptin levels strongly associate with stroke, sudden death, combined cardiovascular events, and mortality in hemodialysis patients with type 2 diabetes. Whether vasopressin receptor antagonists will improve these outcomes requires further studies.", 
    "137": "The statins are a well-established class of drugs that lower plasma cholesterol levels by inhibiting HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A) reductase. They are widely used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and for the prevention of coronary heart disease. Recent studies suggest that statins have anti-inflammatory effects beyond their lipid-lowering properties. We sought to investigate whether statins could affect neuropathic pain by mediating nerve injury-associated inflammatory responses. The effects of hydrophilic rosuvastatin and lipophilic simvastatin were examined in the mouse partial sciatic nerve ligation model. Systemic daily administration of either statin from days 0 to 14 completely prevented the development of mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. When administered from days 8 to 14 after injury, both statins dose-dependently reduced established hypersensitivity. After treatment, the effects of the statins were washed out within 2 to 7 days, depending on dose. Effects of both statins in alleviating mechanical allodynia were further confirmed in a different injury-associated neuropathic pain model, mental nerve chronic constriction, in rats. Both statins were able to abolish interleukin-1\u03b2 expression in sciatic nerve triggered by nerve ligation. Additionally, quantitative analysis with Iba-1 and glial fibrillary acid protein immunoreactivity demonstrated that rosuvastatin and simvastatin significantly reduced the spinal microglial and astrocyte activation produced by sciatic nerve injury. The increase of interleukin-1\u03b2 mRNA in the ipsilateral side of spinal cords was also reduced by the treatment of either statin. We identified a potential new application of statins in the treatment of neuropathic pain. The pain-alleviating effects of statins are likely attributable to their immunomodulatory effects.", 
    "138": "Niacin is currently a favored drug for increasing high-density lipoprotein, especially in patients with ischemic heart disease or at high risk of developing it. In addition, niacin further decreases low-density lipoprotein in statin-treated patients and has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality. Among the available niacin preparations, crystalline, immediate-release niacin is the most effective for increasing high-density lipoprotein and is relatively free of hepatic toxicity. We present the case of a patient who had an excellent clinical and laboratory response to 3 g daily of immediate-release niacin, but who later developed clinical hepatitis when he inadvertently switched to the same dose of slow-release niacin. We encourage the use of niacin in general, immediate-release niacin in particular, and caution that niacin is a drug and not a dietary supplement. We also present practical steps for starting niacin, including close patient contact and support, and beginning with a therapeutic dose of 2 g per day right from the start.",

    "143": "Low levels of statin adherence have been documented in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), but whether coronary revascularization is associated with improved adherence rates has yet to be evaluated. We identified all Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in 2 statewide pharmacy assistance programs who were \u226565 years old, who had been hospitalized for CAD from 1995 through 2004, and who had been prescribed statin therapy within 90 days of discharge (n = 13,130). Statin adherence was measured based on the proportion of days covered with statin therapy after hospital discharge, and full adherence was defined as proportion of days covered \u226580%. Statin adherence was compared in patients with CAD treated with medical therapy (n = 3,714), percutaneous coronary intervention (n = 6,309), or coronary artery bypass graft surgery (n = 3,107). Statin adherence significantly increased over the period of the study from 70.5% to 75.4% (p <0.0001). After hospitalization for CAD, patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention and coronary artery bypass graft surgery had full adherence rates of 70.6% and 70.2%, respectively. Full adherence rates were significantly lower for patients treated with coronary revascularization compared to patients treated with medical therapy (79.4%, p <0.0001). Independent predictors of higher statin adherence included treatment with medical therapy, later year of hospital admission, white race, previous statin use, and use of other cardiac medications after CAD hospitalization (p <0.01 for all comparisons). In conclusion, in patients receiving invasive coronary treatment, statin adherence remains suboptimal, despite strong evidence supporting their use. Given the health and economic consequences of nonadherence, these findings highlight the need for developing cost-effective strategies to improve medication adherence after coronary revascularization.",

Decrease of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) activity may play a role in the differentiating action. In the human cancer cell lines FTC 138 and 238, high DPP IV and low aminopeptidase N activities were recorded. Retinol treatment induced increases in thyroid-specific protein expression [thyroglobulin and sodium-iodide symporter (NIS)], increase in iodide uptake, and decrease in thymidine uptake accompanied by decrease in DPP IV activity.

The objective of the investigation was to examine whether atorvastatin can prevent hyporeactivity to norepinephrine (NE) in mouse aorta in sepsis, and if so, what are the mechanisms involved. Sepsis in mice was induced by cecal ligation and puncture. The aorta was harvested for tension experiment, nitric oxide (NO) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate measurements, and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and \u03b1(1D)-adrenoceptor mRNA expression studies. In comparison with sham-operated controls, sepsis significantly decreased the contractile response to NE in the mouse aorta. Pretreatment with atorvastatin of septic animals completely restored NE-induced contractions to levels similar to those of sham-operated controls and significantly increased survival time and mean arterial pressure. Atorvastatin also attenuated iNOS-induced overproduction of NO, as well as iNOS mRNA expression. Accordingly, hyporeactivity to NE was not evident in tissues pretreated with selective iNOS inhibitor 1400W in sepsis. Although basal cyclic guanosine monophosphate accumulation in the aorta was reduced in sepsis, pretreatment of the tissues with soluble guanylyl cyclase inhibitor 1H-(1,2,4)oxadiazolo(4,3-a)quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ) partially restored the reactivity to NE. Interestingly, hyporeactivity to NE in sepsis was associated with a decreased \u03b1(1D)-adrenoceptor mRNA expression in the mouse aorta. Atorvastatin pretreatment, however, prevented the decrease in \u03b1(1D)-adrenoceptor mRNA expression in septic animals. In conclusion, atorvastatin seems to prevent hyporeactivity to vasoconstrictor NE in the aorta from septic mice through attenuation of overproduction of NO as well as improved \u03b1(1D)-adrenoceptor mRNA expression. The findings of the present study may explain the beneficial effects of atorvastatin on improved hemodynamic functions in sepsis.",

Here we report an intimate link between the innate immune response to infection and regulation of the sterol metabolic network characterized by down-regulation of sterol biosynthesis by an interferon regulatory loop mechanism. In time-series experiments profiling genome-wide lipid-associated gene expression of macrophages, we show a selective and coordinated negative regulation of the complete sterol pathway upon viral infection or cytokine treatment with IFN\u03b3 or \u03b2 but not TNF, IL1\u03b2, or IL6. Quantitative analysis at the protein level of selected sterol metabolic enzymes upon infection shows a similar level of suppression. Experimental testing of sterol metabolite levels using lipidomic-based measurements shows a reduction in metabolic output. On the basis of pharmacologic and RNAi inhibition of the sterol pathway we show augmented protection against viral infection, and in combination with metabolite rescue experiments, we identify the requirement of the mevalonate-isoprenoid branch of the sterol metabolic network in the protective response upon statin or IFN\u03b2 treatment. Conditioned media experiments from infected cells support an involvement of secreted type 1 interferon(s) to be sufficient for reducing the sterol pathway upon infection. Moreover, we show that infection of primary macrophages containing a genetic knockout of the major type I interferon, IFN\u03b2, leads to only a partial suppression of the sterol pathway, while genetic knockout of the receptor for all type I interferon family members, ifnar1, or associated signaling component, tyk2, completely abolishes the reduction of the sterol biosynthetic activity upon infection. Levels of the proteolytically cleaved nuclear forms of SREBP2, a key transcriptional regulator of sterol biosynthesis, are reduced upon infection and IFN\u03b2 treatment at both the protein and de novo transcription level. The reduction in srebf2 gene transcription upon infection and IFN treatment is also found to be strictly dependent on ifnar1. Altogether these results show that type 1 IFN signaling is both necessary and sufficient for reducing the sterol metabolic network activity upon infection, thereby linking the regulation of the sterol pathway with interferon anti-viral defense responses. These findings bring a new link between sterol metabolism and interferon antiviral response and support the idea of using host metabolic modifiers of innate immunity as a potential antiviral strategy.",

Although myalgias are common with statin use, myositis and rhabdomyolysis are rare.

Hence, rather than apply randomization, all patients were administered atorvastatin at a moderate dose level. Plasma levels of three biomarkers of calcification were measured, namely osteoprotegerin (OPG), osteopontin (OPN), and soluble receptor activator of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB ligand (sRANKL).", 
    "202": "Plasma levels of all three biomarkers were decreased after atorvastatin treatment. OPG levels fell from 13.23 +/- 5.33 to 10.92 +/- 5.34 pmol/l (p < 0.05), sRANKL from 105.36 +/- 69.47 to 86.74 +/- 71.36 ng/ml (p < 0.05), and OPN from 31.60 +/- 20.29 to 28.45 +/- 15.98 ng/ml (p = NS). When comparing patients with no/mild valvular calcification to those with moderate valvular calcification, only the OPG level before atorvastatin was statistically higher in patients from the latter group: 11.44 +/- 4.51 versus 16.09 +/- 5.67 pmol/l (p < 0.05).", 
    "203": "Atorvastatin, at a dose level of 20 mg per day, reduced the plasma levels of calcification biomarkers in patients with aortic sclerosis and mild AS. The pre-atorvastatin OPG level was significantly higher when the aortic valve was moderately calcified, despite a persistent low transvalvular gradient.", 
    "204": "The study aimed to analyze the use of intensive lipid-lowering therapy (I-LLT) at discharge in a broad population of patients hospitalized with acute coronary syndrome (ACS).", 
    "205": "Early and intensive statin therapy in ACS has been shown to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Utilization and predictors of I-LLT among hospitalized ACS patients are not known.", 
    "206": "The GWTG database was analyzed for ACS-related hospitalizations from 2005 to 2009. The use of I-LLT (defined as dose of statin or combination therapy likely to produce > 50% reductions in low-density lipoprotein [LDL]) and less intensive lipid-lowering therapy (LI-LLT) at discharge was assessed. Baseline characteristics and temporal trends in LLT were compared in these 2 treatment groups.", 
    "207": "Of 65,396 patients receiving LLT, only 25,036 (38.3%) were treated with an I-LLT regimen. Mean total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides were significantly higher in the I-LLT group. Even among those with LDL > 130 mg/dL, 50% or less received I-LLT. Predictors of I-LLT at discharge included LLT before admission, hyperlipidemia, prior coronary artery disease, increasing body mass index, and in-hospital percutaneous coronary intervention. Although there was some temporal improvement in the rate of I-LLT from 2005 to 2007, a decline in use of I-LLT was noted in 2008 and 2009. This was attributed to a sharp reduction in use of ezetimibe in combination with statin, without corresponding increases in intensive statin monotherapy.", 
    "208": "In a large cohort of patients admitted with ACS, most of the eligible patients were not discharged on I-LLT. These data suggest the need for better implementation of guideline-recommended intensive statin therapy in patients with ACS.", 
    "209": "Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ) is a powerful antioxidant that reduces oxidative stress. We explored whether the quality of dietary fat alters postprandial oxidative DNA damage and whether supplementation with CoQ improves antioxidant capacity by modifying the activation/stabilization of p53 in elderly subjects. In this crossover study, 20 subjects were randomly assigned to receive three isocaloric diets during 4 weeks each: (1) Mediterranean diet (Med diet), (2) Mediterranean diet supplemented with CoQ (Med+CoQ diet), and (3) saturated fatty acid-rich diet (SFA diet). Levels of mRNAs were determined for p53, p21, p53R2, and mdm2. Protein levels of p53, phosphorylated p53 (Ser20), and monoubiquitinated p53 were also measured, both in cytoplasm and nucleus. The extent of DNA damage was measured as plasma 8-OHdG. SFA diet displayed higher postprandial 8-OHdG concentrations, p53 mRNA and monoubiquitinated p53, and lower postprandial Mdm2 mRNA levels compared with Med and Med+CoQ diets (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Moreover, Med+CoQ diet induced a postprandial decrease of cytoplasmatic p53, nuclear p-p53 (Ser20), and nuclear and cytoplasmatic monoubiquitinated p53 protein (p\u2009<\u20090.05). In conclusion, Med+CoQ diet improves oxidative DNA damage in elderly subjects and reduces processes of cellular oxidation. Our results suggest a starting point for the prevention of oxidative processes associated with aging.", 
    "210": "The present study evaluated the potential benefit of supplementation with Heracleumpersicum as an adjunctive therapy to atorvastatin in dyslipidemic subjects. In a randomized, open-label, clinical trial, 100 dyslipidemic subjects were randomly assigned to: (1) H. persicum group (n=50, completers=18), receiving H. persicum extract (500 mg/day) + atorvastatin (10 mg/day) for 8 weeks, or (2) atorvastatin group (n=50, completers=34), receiving only atorvastatin (20 mg/day) for 8 weeks. Weight, body mass index (BMI), lipid profile, and biomarkers of hepatic and renal injury were determined at baseline and at the end of the trial. There were significant reductions in serum total cholesterol and LDL-C in both the H. persicum (p=0.001) and atorvastatin (p< 0.001) groups. Serum HDL-C was elevated in the atorvastatin group (p< 0.05), while no significant change was observed in the H. persicum group (p> 0.05). Serum triglyceride levels remained statistically unchanged by the end of the trial in both groups (p> 0.05). Serum alanine (p=0.049) and aspartate aminotransferase (p=0.013) levels rose in the atorvastatin, but not the H. persicum(p> 0.05) group. In comparison with baseline values, no significant change was observed in weight and BMI, as well as serum levels of creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and fasting blood sugar in either of the groups (p> 0.05). Apart from HDL-C, the effects of atorvastatin (20 mg/day) on other lipid profile parameters do not appear to be significantly superior to those achieved by combination therapy with H. persicum+ atorvastatin (10 mg/day).", 
    "211": "This study evaluated whether statin therapy changed a diagnostic validity of lipid and inflammatory markers in ischemic heart disease (IHD) patients. Levels of lipids, lipoproteins, apolipoproteins, inflammatory markers, and atherogenic indexes were determined in 49 apparently healthy men and women, 82 patients having stable angina pectoris (SAP), 80 patients with unstable angina (USAP), and 106 patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) treated or not treated with statins. Diagnostic accuracy of markers was determined by ROC curve analysis. Significantly lower apoA-I in all statin-treated groups and significantly higher apoB in statin-treated STEMI group compared to non-statin-treated groups were observed. CRP showed the best ROC characteristics in the assessment of STEMI patients. Lp(a) is better in the evaluation of SAP and USAP patients, considering that Lp(a) showed the highest area under the curve (AUC). Regarding atherogenic indexes, the highest AUC in SAP group was obtained for TG/apoB and in USAP and STEMI patients for TG/HDL-c. Statins lowered total cholesterol, LDL-c, and TG but fail to normalize apoA-I in patients with IHD.", 
    "212": "Patients with diabetes mellitus are at increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Dyslipidemia, an important component of the insulin resistance syndrome and type 2 diabetes, is strongly related to CVD risk and is open to therapeutic intervention. Statins have proved to be safe, very-well tolerated, and highly effective in reducing the levels of LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B. Primary and secondary CVD prevention trials have shown that use of statins leads to highly significant reductions in the incidence of major CVD events. A wealth of data on the outcomes of statin therapy is now available to guide clinical practice in the population of patients with type 2 diabetes. Statin therapy in patients with type 1 diabetes seems to have a similar benefit to that seen in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, despite statin therapy, high CVD risk persists in these populations. More-intensive statin therapy produces greater reduction in the incidence of CVD events, but a more-global approach to lipid management is likely to result in further risk reduction. After reductions in the levels of LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B, the next target of lipid-lowering therapy is to increase HDL-cholesterol levels, which tend to be low in patients with type 2 diabetes. The most effective HDL-cholesterol-raising agent currently available for use in clinical practice is niacin. Trials with surrogate end points have pointed to the cardiovascular benefit of adding niacin to statin therapy. Large CVD end point trials, which include many patients with diabetes, are underway to test the combination of a statin and niacin versus a statin alone.", 
    "213": "Severe sepsis is an infection-induced inflammatory syndrome that can lead to multi-organ dysfunction and continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Because numerous cascades are triggered during sepsis, selective blocking of inflammatory mediators may be insufficient to arrest this process, and recent therapeutic approaches have proven controversial. Statins are the most commonly prescribed agents for hypercholesterolaemia and dominate the area of cardiovascular risk reduction. Moreover, these drugs have a variety of actions that are independent of their lipid lowering effect. Such anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, immunomodulatory, and antiapoptotic features have been collectively referred to as pleiotropic effects. By virtue of their pleiotropic effects, statins have also emerged as potentially useful in various critical care areas such as bacteraemia, the early phases of sepsis and septic shock, as well as the management of serious infections. This review outlines current evidence on the use of statins for preventing and treating sepsis.",

    "215": "This analysis examined data from four Phase III, randomised, double-blind trials to determine the consistency of ERN/LRPT's lipid-altering efficacy among subgroups of patients.", 
    "216": "Data from four Phase III, randomised, double-blind trials of ERN/LRPT were analysed to determine the consistency of ERN/LRPT's lipid-altering efficacy among subgroups of gender, race (white, non-white), region (US, ex-US), baseline age (<65, \u226565 years), use of statin therapy, CHD risk status (low, multiple, high) and type of hyperlipidemia (primary hypercholesterolemia, mixed dyslipidemia), as well as across baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglyceride (TG) levels. End-points included the per cent change from baseline in LDL-C, HDL-C and TG levels. Consistency of the treatment effects on LDL-C, HDL-C and TG across subgroups was evaluated by examining treatment difference estimates with 95% confidence intervals.", 
    "217": "\u2002 Treatment with ERN/LRPT significantly improved LDL-C, HDL-C and TG levels compared with placebo/active comparator in each study cohort. These effects were generally consistent across all examined subgroups.",
