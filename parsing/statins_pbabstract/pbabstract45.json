Functional recovery (neuroscore, forelimb gripping strength and adhesive removal test) was assessed during follow-up and lesion volume measured at the end. Vasoreactivity of the middle cerebral artery (MCA), type IV collagen and FITC-dextran distribution were evaluated to assess macrovascular and microvascular protection. Activated microglia, leucocyte adhesion and infiltration were chosen as markers of inflammation.",

In this treatment group, functional recovery was ameliorated, and lesion volumes were reduced as early as 24 h after experimental stroke. This was associated with vascular protection as endothelial function of the MCA and the density and patency of the microvascular network were preserved. Acute atorvastatin administration also induced an anti-inflammatory effect in association with parenchymal and vascular mechanisms; it reduced microglial activation, and decreased leucocyte adhesion and infiltration.",

Lysosomal Acid Lipase (LAL) is a key enzyme in lipid metabolism. We investigated its activity in patients with fatty liver. LAL activity (nmol/spot/h) was measured in 100 adult healthy subjects (HS) and in 240 NAFLD patients. A sub-analysis on 35 patients with biopsy-proven non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) was performed. Median LAL activity was 1.15 (0.95-1.72) in HS. It was significantly reduced in NAFLD [0.78 (0.61-1.01), p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 vs. HS]. A further reduction was observed in the subgroup of NASH [0.67 (0.51-0.77), p\u00a0<\u00a00.001 vs. HS]. Patients with LAL activity below median had higher values of serum total cholesterol (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05) and LDL-c (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), and increased serum liver enzymes (ALT, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; AST, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01; GGT, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). At multivariable logistic regression analysis, factors associated with LAL activity below median were ALT (OR: 1.018, 95% CI 1.004-1.032, p\u00a0=\u00a00.011) and metabolic syndrome (OR: 2.551, 95% CI 1.241-5.245, p\u00a0=\u00a00.011), whilst statin use predicted a better LAL function (OR: 0.464, 95% CI 0.248-0.866, p\u00a0=\u00a00.016). Our findings suggest a strong association between impaired LAL activity and NAFLD. A better knowledge of the role of LAL may provide new insights in NAFLD pathogenesis.",

The structures of the new compounds were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic analysis and chemical transformation. The inhibitory effects of 1-26 on HMG-CoA reductase and \u03b1-glucosidase were tested in vitro. Compounds 1, 3, 6, 10-14, 17, 18, 23, 25, and 26 showed much stronger inhibitory activity against HMG-CoA reductase than the positive control atorvastatin.

    "17": "The results partially replicate similar studies in health screening decisions. Reasons for the differences in results from those obtained in screening studies are considered. It is suggested that negative focussing may have less effect in decisions in which there are few risks. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Decision-making in the context of health behaviour change has been widely described, but there are few experimental studies testing hypothesised strategies. 'Non-directiveness' is often regarded as desirable because it supposedly allows exploration of the decision without influencing it. Previous studies on health screening (but not treatment) have shown that health decision outcomes can be systematically influenced by the way in which a 'non-directive' intervention is implemented. This can be accounted for by a modified subjective expected utility theory previously applied to both health screening and child vaccination decisions. What does this study add? The hypothetical decision about whether or not, in future, to take statins for elevated cholesterol levels was influenced by positive but not by negative focussing. Results were consistent with the theoretical framework. This study extends previous work on influences on the decision to undertake health screening and vaccination to treatment offered as secondary prevention. 'Non-directive' approaches to helping facilitate decisions can modify those decisions, and as such cannot be regarded as non-directive.",

    "22": "Individualized therapeutic strategy of dyslipidemias, classically relies upon a phenotypic approach. The pattern of lipid profile allows the choice of the best pharmacological option (statin, fibrate) and the patient's clinical risk profile allows the definition of therapeutic goals, especially LDL cholesterol target levels. Dyslipidemias have a major genetic component, which is best illustrated by familial hypercholesterolemia, with its two heterozygous and homozygous forms. There is a huge between-subject variability in the response to lipid-lowering therapies (especially to statins) and ongoing pharmacogenetic and pharmacogenomic studies should help to better understand this inter-individual heterogeneity. The recent discovery of mutations in the PCSK9 rene opened new perspectives regarding the understanding of some forms of familial hypercholesterolemia and led to the development of monoclonal antibodies that selectively inhibit PCSK9. These PCSK9 inhibitors allow, when combined to a statin, drastic reductions in LDL cholesterol concentrations, even when familial hypercholesterolemia is present. They are currently tested in large prospective controlled trials aiming to demonstrate a significant reduction in the residual cardiovascular risk in statin-treated patients.", 
    "23": "There is clinical interest in identifying novel lipid biomarkers for evaluating cardiovascular risk and targeting lipid-lowering treatment. Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) plays a crucial role in the dysregulated cholesterol transfer from modified lipoproteins to human coronary vascular smooth muscle cells (hVSMCs), promoting hVSMC-derived foam cell formation. LRP1 has a soluble and circulating form (sLRP1) generated from LRP1. Cholesterol modulates the release of the soluble form of LRP1. Using in vitro, ex vivo and patient-based approaches, we tested the association between circulating sLRP1 concentrations and hypercholesterolemia and the potential of sLRP1 as a biomarker of atherosclerosis.", 
    "24": "Circulating sLRP1 concentrations were higher in severe hypercholesterolemia compared to moderate hypercholesterolemia or normocholesterolemia (Study 1). Circulating sLRP1 was significantly associated with established pro-atherogenic lipid parameters in two different hypercholesterolemic populations (Studies 2 and 3). sLRP1 concentrations decreased after statin treatment and increased after statin withdrawal (Study 3). In vitro experiments showed that native LDL, aggregated LDL and VLDL+IDL lipoproteins induced the release of sLRP1 from hVSMC. sLRP1 levels were increased in the conditioned medium of coronary atherosclerotic plaque areas extracted from patients compared to non-atherosclerotic areas of the same coronary artery and patient. Circulating sLRP1 concentrations were independently associated with the occurrence of carotid atherosclerosis in a hypercholesterolemic population (Study 2). The later association was higher than that observed for other classical or novel lipid parameters.",

    "26": "This study aimed to investigate the effect of statins for the treatment of depression in individuals with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). We used 1-year follow-up data of a 24-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of escitalopram and a naturalistic prospective observational cohort study. Of 446 participants with comorbid depressive disorders and ACS at baseline, 300 participated in a randomised escitalopram trial and the remaining 146 participated in a naturalistic observational study. The participants in the two studies were approached for a 1-year follow-up investigation. Treatment response rates, defined as a \u2a7e 50% reduction in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores, were used as the outcome variables. In the escitalopram trial, both HAM-D and BDI response rates were highest in patients taking escitalopram and statins together and lowest in patients receiving neither medication. Logistic regression analyses revealed that statin use was significantly associated with higher response rates on both the HAM-D and BDI at 1 year, whereas no such associations were found for escitalopram. In the naturalistic observational study, the response rates at 1 year did not differ significantly by statin use. Instead, the HAM-D response rate was significantly higher in patients taking lipophilic statins than in those who did not. In conclusion, statins may be effective for the treatment of depression independent of medical status and escitalopram use, and they may potentiate the antidepressant action of serotonergic antidepressants in patients with ACS.", 
    "27": "The immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region (IGHV) mutational status is a strong determinant of remission duration in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The aim of this work was to compare the multidrug resistance (MDR) signature of IGHV mutated and unmutated CLL cells, identifying biochemical and molecular targets potentially amenable to therapeutic intervention.We found that the mevalonate pathway-dependent Ras/ERK1-2 and RhoA/RhoA kinase signaling cascades, and the downstream HIF-1\u03b1/P-glycoprotein axis were more active in IGHV unmutated than in mutated cells, leading to a constitutive protection from doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity. The constitutive MDR phenotype of IGHV unmutated cells was partially dependent on B cell receptor signaling, as shown by the inhibitory effect exerted by ibrutinib. Stromal cells further protected IGHV unmutated cells from doxorubicin by upregulating Ras/ERK1-2, RhoA/RhoA kinase, Akt, HIF-1\u03b1 and P-glycoprotein activities. Mevalonate pathway inhibition with simvastatin abrogated these signaling pathways and reversed the resistance of IGHV unmutated cells to doxorubicin, also counteracting the protective effect exerted by stromal cells. Similar results were obtained via the targeted inhibition of the downstream molecules ERK1-2, RhoA kinase and HIF-1\u03b1.Therefore, targeting the mevalonate pathway and its downstream signaling cascades is a promising strategy to circumvent the MDR signature of IGHV unmutated CLL cells.",

The authors searched PubMed between 1997 and mid-June 2015 (any language) and the Cochrane Library to identify all randomized controlled trials comparing ezetimibe/simvastatin with placebo or less intensive LDL-C lowering. Risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), standardized to 20 mg/dL LDL-C reduction, were calculated for 5 primary outcomes (fatal and nonfatal) and 4 secondary outcomes (non-cardiovascular [CV] death, cancer, myopathy, and hepatopathy). Five ezetimibe/simvastatin RCTs (30 051 individuals) were eligible, 2 comparing ezetimibe/simvastatin vs placebo and 3 vs less intensive treatment. Outcomes reduced almost to the same extent were stroke (RR: -13%, 95% CI: -21% to -3%), coronary heart disease (CHD; RR: -12%, 95% CI: -19% to -5%), and composite of stroke and CHD (RR: -14%, 95% CI: -20% to -8%). Absolute risk reductions: 5 strokes, 10 CHD events, and 16 stroke and CHD events prevented for every 1000 patients treated for 5 years. Residual risk was almost 7\u00d7 higher than absolute risk reduction for all the above outcomes. All death outcomes were not reduced, and secondary outcomes did not differ between groups. Logarithmic risk ratios were not associated with LDL-C lowering. Our meta-analysis provides evidence that, in patients with different CV disease burden, major CV events are safely reduced by LDL-C lowering with ezetimibe/simvastatin, while raising the hypothesis that the extent of LDL-C lowering might not be accompanied by incremental clinical-event reduction.",

Although safe and generally well tolerated, there is growing evidence to suggest that statins are associated with an elevated occurrence of new-onset diabetes mellitus. The incidence of this adverse effect is not negligible, especially for specific subsets of patients. Statins remain the cornerstone for primary and secondary cardiovascular prevention, but specific attention to glucose metabolism and metabolic syndrome features should be given before and during statin treatment, especially in cohorts at greater risk, and a potential tailored statin treatment based on the patient's cardiovascular and metabolic risk profile might emerge as the safest therapeutic approach. The main purpose of this review is to discuss the clinical evidence regarding the association of statin use with new onset diabetes mellitus, the cardiovascular benefit/risk ratio with statins, and the rationale for individualized statin therapy. Future trials with adequate and long follow-up designed to assess the benefit/risk ratio of a specific statin will further refine the basis of this strategy.",

The recommendation identifies 4 patient groups with strong evidence that the benefits of reduction in ASCVD events from statin therapy exceed adverse events. For these patients, initiating statin therapy of an appropriate intensity to reduce ASCVD risk and minimize adverse effects is recommended. A new risk estimator based on a pooled cohort equation is presented for estimating 10-year ASCVD risk. There is also a recommendation to engage in a clinician-patient discussion before initiating a statin, especially for primary prevention of ASCVD. This paper summarizes a discussion between a cardiologist and an internist about how each clinician would balance these factors and what treatment they would suggest for an individual patient.", 
    "39": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous condition characterized by androgen excess, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovaries. It is the most common endocrinopathy among women of reproductive age, affecting between 6.5% and 8% of women, and is the most common cause of infertility. Insulin resistance is almost always present in women with PCOS, regardless of weight, and they often develop diabetes and metabolic syndrome. The Rotterdam criteria are widely used for diagnosis. These criteria require that patients have at least two of the following conditions: hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and polycystic ovaries. The diagnosis of PCOS also requires exclusion of other potential etiologies of hyperandrogenism and ovulatory dysfunction. The approach to PCOS management differs according to the presenting symptoms and treatment goals, particularly the patient's desire for pregnancy. Weight loss through dietary modifications and exercise is recommended for patients with PCOS who are overweight. Oral contraceptives are the first-line treatment for regulating menstrual cycles and reducing manifestations of hyperandrogenism, such as acne and hirsutism. Clomiphene is the first-line drug for management of anovulatory infertility. Metformin is recommended for metabolic abnormalities such as prediabetes, and a statin should be prescribed for cardioprotection if the patient meets standard criteria for statin therapy.", 
    "40": "Although nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is not one of the defining criteria for metabolic syndrome, it is a common hepatic manifestation. NAFLD includes a spectrum of histologic findings ranging from simple steatosis, known as nonalcoholic fatty liver, to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). To make the diagnosis of NAFLD, other etiologies of steatosis or hepatitis, such as hepatotoxic drugs, excessive alcohol intake, congenital errors of metabolism, or viral hepatitis, must be ruled out. After ruling out other conditions, the diagnosis of NAFLD often is made clinically, but a definitive diagnosis of NASH requires liver biopsy. As with other complications of metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance is thought to be an underlying etiology of NAFLD. Management strategies attempt to reverse or improve insulin resistance while minimizing liver damage. The strongest evidence supports lifestyle modifications with weight loss, but there is some evidence to support bariatric surgery, medical therapy with insulin-sensitizing agents, and/or pharmacotherapy to promote weight loss. Cardiovascular disease is the major cause of mortality in patients with NAFLD, so management must include modification of cardiovascular risk factors.", 
    "41": "Metabolic syndrome is associated with an elevated risk of cardiovascular disease and premature mortality. When metabolic syndrome includes lipid abnormalities, management goals are weight loss and cardiovascular risk management through lifestyle modifications (eg, diet, exercise), and, when appropriate, lowering of lipid levels with pharmacotherapy. Healthy diets are recommended, particularly the Mediterranean diet. Patients also should set a goal of at least 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous exercise on most, preferably all, days of the week. Guidelines provide criteria for statin treatment based on overall cardiovascular risk. High-intensity statin treatment (eg, rosuvastatin 20 to 40 mg, atorvastatin 40 to 80 mg) typically is recommended unless the patient cannot tolerate therapy. Approximately 5% of patients experience statin-induced myalgia, in which case moderate-intensity treatment can be tried. Lipid levels should be reevaluated 4 to 12 weeks after initiating therapy; lipid levels can be measured without fasting. A lack of improvement often indicates nonadherence. Bile acid sequestrants, fibric acids, and niacin can be used if other drugs are not tolerated. The evidence to support use of integrative medicine is limited, but the strongest evidence of benefit is for garlic (Allium sativum).",

In the present study, the effect of simvastatin on the sensitivity of normal Sertoli cells to cisplatin and the role of gap junctions in such effects was investigated. The results showed that, simvastatin attenuated cisplatin toxicity only when cells exhibited high-density culture where gap junctional formation was possible. When gap junction function was decreased by the gap junction inhibitor or by siRNA targeting connexin 43, the protective effect of simvastatin to cisplatin toxicity was substantially attenuated. Simvastatin also enhanced gap junction functions between Sertoli cells. This effect was mediated by the reduction of PKC-mediated connexin phosphorylation, thereby increasing connexin 43 membrane localization. Thus, simvastatin-induced enhancement of gap junction\u2011mediated intercellular communication attenuated cisplatin toxicity on Sertoli cells.

Compared to baseline, central PWV decreased (P = 0.01) following simvastatin treatment but not placebo (drug \u2217 time interaction: P = 0.047). Changes in central PWV with simvastatin treatment were not influenced by myalgia status or time on simvastatin (P \u2265 0.15). Change in central PWV after simvastatin treatment was inversely correlated with age (r = -0.207, P = 0.030), suggesting that advancing age is associated with enhanced statin-mediated arterial destiffening. In patients with a history of statin-related muscle complaints, the development of myalgia with short-term simvastatin treatment did not attenuate the improvement in arterial stiffness.",

We performed a phase II study of atorvastatin for aGVHD prophylaxis when given to allo-HCT recipients and their HLA-matched sibling donors. Atorvastatin (40\u00a0mg/day) was administered to sibling donors, beginning 14\u00a0days before the anticipated start of stem cell collection. Allo-HCT recipients (n\u00a0=\u00a040) received atorvastatin (40\u00a0mg/day) in addition to standard aGVHD prophylaxis. The primary endpoint was cumulative incidence of grades II to IV aGVHD at day 100. Atorvastatin was well tolerated, with no attributable grades III to IV toxicities in donors or their recipients. Day 100 and 180 cumulative incidences of grades II to IV aGVHD were 30% (95% confidence interval [CI], 17% to 45%) and 40% (95% CI, 25% to 55%), respectively. One-year cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD was 43% (95% CI, 32% to 69%). One-year nonrelapse mortality and relapse incidences were 5.5% (95% CI, .9% to 16.5%) and 38% (95% CI, 18% to 47%), respectively. One-year progression-free and overall survival rates were 54% (95% CI, 38% to 71%) and 82% (95% CI, 69% to 94%). One-year GVHD-free, relapse-free survival was 27% (95% CI, 16% to 47%).

We sought to examine the angiographic burden of coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with HCV compared to HCV-negative patients. All consecutive HCV RNA-positive patients (n\u00a0= 61) who underwent coronary angiography at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences from 2001 to 2013 were identified. A parallel group of HCV-negative controls (n\u00a0= 61), matched for age, gender, and indication for coronary angiography served as control. Angiographic burden of CAD was assessed by computing Gensini scores. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 21.0. Patients with HCV had significantly lower levels of total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Preangiographic use of aspirin and statin was significantly lower in the HCV cohort. Number of patients with obstructive CAD was less in HCV group (23% vs 39%, p <0.05). However, angiographic Gensini score was similar in both groups. There was no correlation between HCV RNA titers and Gensini score (p\u00a0= 0.9, analysis of variance). In conclusion, patients with active HCV infection have similar angiographic CAD burden as HCV-negative patients. Furthermore, viral load does not appear to correlate with atherosclerosis burden. Patients with HCV have less-obstructive CAD and less-frequent use of aspirin and statins.", 
    "164": "A high level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) has proved to have a positive correlation with mortality from cardiovascular disease, and it is the key modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Lowering levels of LDL-C with statins reduces both vascular morbidity and mortality; however, myalgias occur in 10% to 15% of patients, and many patients managed with statins achieve suboptimal levels of LDL-C. The injectable drug alirocumab-the first of a new class of drugs called proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors-is a monoclonal antibody to the PCSK9 gene, which regulates LDL receptor expression and circulating levels of LDL-C. In this review, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of alirocumab and its potential role in the management of patients with high-risk cardiovascular disease. Data were gathered from articles indexed in the PubMed database (2006-April 2015). All English-language, prospective, randomized, double-blinded trials evaluating the efficacy of alirocumab, as a monotherapy or in combination with statins, for treatment of hypercholesterolemia were identified. Five clinical trials were evaluated, and the results from these studies revealed that the use of alirocumab, both as monotherapy or in combination with statins, significantly reduced LDL-C levels. Patients treated with alirocumab, with or without statins, were more likely to achieve LDL-C goals of less than 100 or 70\u00a0mg/dl compared with placebo. Despite its ability to lower LDL-C level, one study did not show any antiinflammatory activity (i.e., reduced C-reactive protein level) among patients who received alirocumab; however, more clinical trials will be needed to further assess this effect. Alirocumab also appears to cause regression of plaque. The most commonly reported adverse effect was mild injection-site reaction. With increased odds of statin discontinuation among patients taking high-intensity statins, alirocumab will contribute to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk reduction. However, morbidity and mortality data, as well as long-term safety data, are pending. Therefore, we propose that alirocumab will better serve as an adjuvant therapy for the management of hypercholesterolemia in patients at high risk for cardiovascular events. As with all new promising injectable drugs, cost will also be a key consideration.",

Previous studies have demonstrated the neuroprotective effects of simvastatin in different animal models. In the present study, we examined the effects of simvastatin (30, 60, 100 and 300mg/kg, p.o.) on the development and expression of morphine-induced tolerance and dependence in mice. For the induction of morphine tolerance and dependence, mice were twice daily treated with morphine (10mg/kg, s.c.) for 5 consecutive days. Tolerance was evaluated by the hot-plate test and physical dependence by naloxone challenge, on the sixth day. The results showed that oral administration of simvastatin produced antinociceptive activity in a dose-dependent way. Co-administration of simvastatin with morphine did not affect the acute morphine-induced analgesia (10mg/kg, s.c.). However, repeated co-administration of simvastatin with morphine significantly attenuated the development of tolerance to the analgesic effect of morphine and inhibited the naloxone (5mg/kg, s.c.)-precipitated withdrawal signs (jumping and body weight loss). Also, simvastatin at doses of 100 and 300mg/kg attenuated the expression of morphine-induced tolerance and dependence. These data indicated that, while simvastatin can alleviate both development and expression of morphine-induced tolerance, it cannot enhance morphine-induced antinociception. Taken together, simvastatin may be used as an adjutant therapeutic agent in combination with morphine and or other opioids in patients with severe chronic pain.",

The presence of mevinolin (MEV), an inhibitor of the MVA pathway, at concentrations higher than 0.5\u00a0\u03bcM significantly reduced plant development, but not the synthesis of chlorophylls and carotenoids. On the other hand, fosmidomycin (FSM), an inhibitor of the MEP pathway, at concentrations higher than 20\u00a0\u03bcM blocked the synthesis of chlorophyll, carotenoids and essential oils, and significantly reduced stem development. Notably, 1.2\u00a0mM MVA could recover the phenotype of MEV-treated plants, including the normal growth and development of roots, and could partially restore the biosynthesis of photosynthetic pigments and, to a lesser extent, of the essential oils in plantlets treated with FSM. Spike lavender shoot apices were also used in (13)C-labeling experiments, where the plantlets were grown in the presence of [U-(13)C6]glucose. GC-MS-analysis of 1,8-cineole and camphor indicated that the C5-precursors, isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) of both monoterpenes are predominantly biosynthesized via the methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway. However, on the basis of the isotopologue profiles, a minor contribution of the MVA pathway was evident that was increased in transgenic spike lavender plants overexpressing the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMGR), the first enzyme of the MVA pathway. Together, these findings provide evidence for a transport of MVA-derived precursors from the cytosol to the plastids in leaves of spike lavender.",

Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid, is incorporated into membrane phospholipids and atherosclerotic plaques and exerts beneficial effects on the pathophysiologic cascade from onset of plaque formation through rupture. Specific salutary actions have been reported relating to endothelial function, oxidative stress, foam cell formation, inflammation, plaque formation/progression, platelet aggregation, thrombus formation, and plaque rupture. EPA also improves atherogenic dyslipidemia characterized by reduction of triglycerides without raising low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Other beneficial effects of EPA include vasodilation, resulting in blood pressure reductions, as well as improved membrane fluidity. EPA's effects are at least additive to those of statins when given as adjunctive therapy. In this review, we present data supporting the biologic plausibility of EPA as an anti-atherosclerotic agent with potential clinical benefit for prevention of CV events, as well as its cellular effects and molecular mechanisms of action. REDUCE-IT is an ongoing, randomized, controlled study evaluating whether the high-purity ethyl ester of EPA (icosapent ethyl) at 4 g/day combined with statin therapy is superior to statin therapy alone for reducing CV events in high-risk patients with mixed dyslipidemia. The results from this study are expected to clarify the role of EPA as adjunctive therapy to a statin for reduction of residual CV risk.",

EBN has been reported to improve dyslipidemia, which is closely linked to hypercoagulation states. In the present study, the effects of EBN on high-fat diet- (HFD-) induced coagulation in rats were evaluated. Rats were fed for 12 weeks with HFD alone or in combination with simvastatin or EBN. Food intake was estimated, and weight measurements were made during the experimental period. After sacrifice, serum oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), adiponectin, leptin, von willibrand factor, prostacyclin, thromboxane and lipid profile, and whole blood coagulation indices (bleeding time, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, red blood count count, and platelet count) were estimated. Furthermore, hepatic expression of coagulation-related genes was evaluated using multiplex polymerase chain reaction. The results indicated that EBN could attenuate HFD-induced hypercholesterolemia and coagulation similar to simvastatin, partly through transcriptional regulation of coagulation-related genes. The results suggested that EBN has the potential for lowering the risk of cardiovascular disease-related hypercoagulation due to hypercholesterolemia.",

    "187": "Matching on the propensity score is a commonly used analytic method for estimating the effects of treatments on outcomes. Commonly used propensity score matching methods include nearest neighbor matching and nearest neighbor caliper matching. Rosenbaum (1991) proposed an optimal full matching approach, in which matched strata are formed consisting of either one treated subject and at least one control subject or one control subject and at least one treated subject. Full matching has been used rarely in the applied literature. Furthermore, its performance for use with survival outcomes has not been rigorously evaluated. We propose a method to use full matching to estimate the effect of treatment on the hazard of the occurrence of the outcome. An extensive set of Monte Carlo simulations were conducted to examine the performance of optimal full matching with survival analysis. Its performance was compared with that of nearest neighbor matching, nearest neighbor caliper matching, and inverse probability of treatment weighting using the propensity score. Full matching has superior performance compared with that of the two other matching algorithms and had comparable performance with that of inverse probability of treatment weighting using the propensity score. We illustrate the application of full matching with survival outcomes to estimate the effect of statin prescribing at hospital discharge on the hazard of post-discharge mortality in a large cohort of patients who were discharged from hospital with a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction. Optimal full matching merits more widespread adoption in medical and epidemiological research. \u00a9 2015 The Authors. Statistics in Medicine Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",

We aim to explore the relationship between the outcome and different risk factors in patients with different subtype of acute strokes treated with i.v. tPA. Records of patients in this cohort were reviewed. Data collected and analysed included the demographics, vascular risk factors, baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores, 90-day modified Rankin Scores (mRS), and subtypes of stroke. By using the 90-day mRS, patients were dichotomized into favorable versus unfavorable outcome in each subtype of stroke. We identified the vascular risk factors that are likely associated with the poor outcome in each subtype. Among 570 AIS patients received i.v. tPA, 217 were in the large artery atherosclerosis (LAA) group, 146 in the small vessel occlusion (SVO) group, and 140 in the cardioaortic embolism (CE) group. Lower NIHSS score on admission was related to favorable outcome in patients in all subtypes. Patients with history of dyslipidemia were likely on statin treatment before their admission and hence less likely to have elevated cholesterol level on admission. Therefore, there was a possible paradoxical effect on the outcome in patients with LAA and SVO subtypes of strokes. SVO patients with history of diabetes had higher risk of unfavorable outcome. SVO patients had favorable outcome if their time from onset to treatment was short.

    "200": "In older ischemic stroke patients who were not taking statins at the time of admission, discharge statin therapy was associated with lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular events and nearly 1 month more home time during the 2-year period after hospitalization.", 
    "201": "Statins have been shown to be beneficial in primary and secondary prevention settings; however, their role in the elderly remains a clinical conundrum, given that age-related factors could alter the risk-benefit ratio of statin treatment. This study aimed to critically evaluate the efficacy and safety of statins for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in the elderly.", 
    "202": "We systematically reviewed randomized controlled trials comparing any statins with placebo or usual care for primary prevention of CVD in subjects aged \u226565 years. Relative risks (RRs) using a random effects model were calculated and sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the robustness of findings.", 
    "203": "Eight studies (n = 25,952) were included in the meta-analysis. Statins significantly reduced the risks of composite major adverse cardiovascular events (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.74-0.92), nonfatal myocardial infarction [MI] (0.75, 0.59-0.94) and total MI (0.74, 0.61-0.90). Treatment effects of statins were statistically insignificant in fatal MI (0.43, 0.09-2.01), stroke (fatal: 0.76, 0.24-2.45; nonfatal: 0.76, 0.53-1.11; total: 0.85, 0.68-1.06) and all-cause mortality (0.96, 0.88-1.04). Significant differences were not observed in myalgia (0.88, 0.69-1.13), elevation of hepatic transaminases (0.98, 0.71-1.34), new-onset diabetes (1.07, 0.77-1.48), serious adverse events (1.00, 0.97-1.04) and discontinuation due to adverse events (1.10, 0.85-1.42). The occurrence of myopathy, rhabdomyolysis and cognitive impairment was largely unreported in the included trials.", 
    "204": "From a risk-benefit perspective, there is a role of statins for the primary prevention of major adverse cardiovascular events in elderly patients. Further studies are needed to ascertain the benefits of statins on fatal MI, stroke and all-cause mortality.", 
    "205": "Dual lipid-lowering and anti-inflammatory properties of statins may lead to survival benefits in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). However, data on this topic are limited, and the role of statins in RA remains unclear.", 
    "206": "To examine the association of statin use with overall mortality among patients with RA in a general population context.", 
    "207": "We conducted an incident user cohort study with time-stratified propensity score matching using a UK general population database. The study population included individuals aged \u226520\u2005years who had a diagnosis of RA and had used at least one disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD) between January 2000 and December 2012. To closely account for potential confounders, we compared propensity score matched cohorts of statin initiators and comparators (non-initiators) within 1-year cohort accrual blocks.", 
    "208": "432 deaths occurred during follow-up (mean 4.51\u2005years) of the 2943 statin initiators for an incidence rate of 32.6/1000 person-years (PY), while the 513 deaths among 2943 matched comparators resulted in an incidence rate of 40.6/1000 PY. Baseline characteristics were well-balanced across the two groups. Statin initiation was associated with a 21% lower risk of all-cause mortality (HR=0.79, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.91). When we defined RA by its diagnosis code alone (not requiring DMARD use), the corresponding HR was 0.81 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.90).", 
    "209": "Statin initiation is associated with a lower risk of mortality among patients with RA. The magnitude of association is similar to that seen in previous randomised trials among the general population.", 
    "210": "Cardiovascular disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in both men and women with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. In patients with diabetes, risk factors, such as hypertension and dyslipidemia, play a major role in inducing cardiovascular disease. To prevent cardiovascular disease control of these risk factors is paramount. In patients with type 1 diabetes in good glycemic control the lipid profile is very similar to the general population. In contrast, in patients with type 2 diabetes, even with good glycemic control, there are frequently lipid abnormalities including elevated serum triglycerides and non-HDL cholesterol and decreased HDL levels. The increase in serum triglycerides is primarily due to increased hepatic production of VLDL but a decrease in the clearance of triglyceride rich lipoproteins may also contribute. The decrease in HDL is associated with the increase in serum triglycerides. LDL levels are typically in the normal range but an increase in small dense LDL is commonly observed. In both type 1 and type 2 diabetes poor glycemic control increases triglyceride levels and decreases HDL levels with only modest effects on LDL cholesterol levels. Poor glycemic control leads to a decrease in lipoprotein lipase activity and a delay in the clearance of triglyceride rich lipoproteins. Extensive studies have demonstrated that statins decrease cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes. Treatment with high doses of potent statins reduces cardiovascular events to a greater extent than low dose statin therapy. Adding fibrates or niacin to statin therapy has not been shown to further decrease cardiovascular events. In contrast, a recent study has shown that the combination of a statin and ezetimibe does result in a greater decrease in cardiovascular events than statins alone. Current recommendations indicate that most patients with diabetes should be on statin therapy. For extensive review of all related areas of Endocrinology, visit WWW.ENDOTEXT.ORG.", 
    "211": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with a dyslipidemia comprising high triglycerides, low HDL-cholesterol and altered lipoprotein composition. Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of mortality in CKD, especially in end stage renal disease patients. Thus, therapies to reduce cardiovascular risk are urgently needed in CKD. Robust clinical trial evidence has found that use of statins in pre-end stage CKD patients, as well as in renal transplant recipients, can decrease cardiovascular events; however, providers need to be aware of dose restrictions for statin therapy in CKD subjects. Furthermore, statin therapy does not reduce cardiovascular events in dialysis patients, nor does statin therapy confer any protection against progression of renal disease. Niacin and fibrates are effective in lipid lowering in CKD and appear to have some cardiovascular benefit but further study is needed to clearly define their role. This article reviews the epidemiology of CKD, association of CKD with cardiovascular events, and the effects of CKD on lipid levels and metabolism. The article discusses clinical trial evidence for and against statin and non-statin lipid lowering therapy in CKD patients.

    "212": "Abnormalities in lipid metabolism are very commonly observed in obese patients. Approximately 60-70% of obese patients are dyslipidemic. The lipid abnormalities in obese patients include elevated serum triglyceride, VLDL, apolipoprotein B, and non-HDL cholesterol levels. The increase in serum triglycerides is primarily due to increased hepatic production of VLDL but a decrease in the clearance of triglyceride rich lipoproteins may also contribute. HDL levels are typically low and are associated with the increase in serum triglycerides. LDL cholesterol levels are frequently in the normal range but there is an increase in small dense LDL. Obese patients are at an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease and therefore treatment of their dyslipidemia is often indicated. Weight loss will decrease serum triglyceride and LDL levels and increase HDL levels. In most patients the changes in lipid levels with weight loss are not very robust. Dietary constituents of a weight loss diet have a small but significant impact on the changes in lipid levels. Low carbohydrate diets decrease triglyceride levels to a greater extent than high carbohydrate diets. High fat diets blunt the decrease in LDL that occurs with weight loss. The increase in HDL with weight loss is greatest with a high fat diet. Bariatric surgery results in robust weight loss and has a marked effect on serum lipid levels. Remission of hyperlipidemia with gastric bypass surgery is frequently observed. The reduction in cardiovascular disease with statin therapy was no different in patients with a BMI >30 or BMI <25 (i.e. statins are effective in obese patients). Many if not most obese patients should be on statin therapy. The mixed dyslipidemia that is frequently observed in obese patients will often require combination therapy. However, recent studies have failed to demonstrate that adding fenofibrate or niacin to statin therapy provides additional benefits beyond statins alone.", 
    "213": "The pathophysiology of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction is poorly understood, but may involve a systemic proinflammatory state. Therefore, statins might improve outcomes in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction defined as \u226550%.", 
    "214": "Of 46 959 unique patients in the prospective Swedish Heart Failure Registry, 9140 patients had heart failure and ejection fraction \u226550% (age 77\u00b111 years, 54.0% women), and of these, 3427 (37.5%) were treated with statins. Propensity scores for statin treatment were derived from 40 baseline variables. The association between statin use and primary (all-cause mortality) and secondary (separately, cardiovascular mortality, and combined all-cause mortality or cardiovascular hospitalization) end points was assessed with Cox regressions in a population matched 1:1 based on age and propensity score. In the matched population, 1-year survival was 85.1% for statin-treated versus 80.9% for untreated patients (hazard ratio, 0.80; 95% confidence interval, 0.72-0.89; P<0.001). Statins were also associated with reduced cardiovascular death (hazard ratio, 0.86; 95% confidence interval, 0.75-0.98; P=0.026) and composite all-cause mortality or cardiovascular hospitalization (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% confidence interval, 0.82-0.96; P=0.003).", 
    "215": "In heart failure with ejection fraction \u226550%, the use of statins was associated with improved outcomes. The mechanisms should be evaluated and the effects tested in a randomized trial.", 
    "216": "Cardiovascular risk persists despite intensive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction using statins. High-density lipoprotein (HDL-C) is inversely associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) that is independent of LDL-C levels. C-reactive protein (CRP) is an established marker of inflammation that can impair the protective function of HDL-C: however, the impact of inflammation on the association between HDL-C and long-term outcomes in patients with CAD under statin therapy remains uncertain. We prospectively enrolled 3,507 consecutive patients with CAD who underwent a first percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) from 1997 to 2011 at our institution. We stratified 1,682 patients (48%) who had been treated with statin at the time of PCI into 4 groups according to HDL-C levels (cutoffs of 40 and 50\u00a0mg/dl for men and women, respectively) and a CRP cutoff of 2\u00a0mg/dl: (1) high HDL-C/low CRP, (2) high HDL-C/high CRP, (3) low HDL-C/low CRP, and (4) low HDL-C/high CRP comparing the rates of all-cause death among them. The median follow-up period was 1,985\u00a0days (interquartile range 916 to 3,183\u00a0days). During this period, 197 patients (11.7%) died because of cardiac death (n\u00a0=\u00a058), carcinoma (n\u00a0=\u00a061), stroke (n\u00a0= 10), and other causes (n\u00a0= 69). The rates of all-cause death significantly differed among the groups (log-rank test, p <0.0001). In multivariate Cox hazard regression analyses, low HDL-C with high CRP levels remained significantly associated with a higher rate of all-cause death even after adjustment for other co-variates (hazard ratio 2.38, 1.59 to 3.61, p <0.0001). Low HDL-C together with elevated CRP levels is significantly associated with long-term outcomes in patients who received statin therapy after PCI.", 
    "217": "Acute pseudo-obstruction of the colon is a disorder characterised by an increase in intra-luminal pressure that leads to ischaemia and necrosis of the intestinal wall. The mechanism that produces the lesion is unknown, although it has been associated with: trauma, anaesthesia, or drugs that alter the autonomic nervous system. The pathophysiology of medication induced colon toxicity can progress to a perforated colon and potentially death.", 
    "218": "Present a case of a colonic pseudo-obstruction in a patient with polypharmacy as the only risk factor and to review the medical literature related to the treatment of this pathology.", 
    "219": "The case is presented of a 67 year old woman with colonic pseudo-obstruction who presented with diffuse abdominal pain and distension. The pain progressed and reached an intensity of 8/10, and was accompanied by fever and tachycardia. There was evidence of free intraperitoneal air in the radiological studies. The only risk factor was the use of multiple drugs. The colonic pseudo-obstruction progressed to intestinal perforation, requiring surgical treatment, which resolved the problem successfully.", 
    "220": "It is important to consider drug interaction in patients with multiple diseases, as it may develop complications that can be avoided if detected on time.", 
    "221": "Guidelines for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) with statins, including the most recent, fail to make the best use of the evidence from clinical trials by concentrating on absolute CVD risk as a statin indication and not also considering that a major determinant of therapeutic benefit is the magnitude of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (or non-HDL) cholesterol reduction achieved. This decrease is proportional to the pretreatment concentration. We set out to apply this knowledge to the calculation of the number needed to treat to prevent one event (NNT) and to assess critically how current guidelines performed at different degrees of CVD risk across a range of LDL (or non-HDL) cholesterol concentrations.", 
    "222": "Number needed to treat to prevent one event revealed exclusion from the treatment of some people with higher cholesterol levels, who may benefit more than others needlessly exposed to statins with no realistic prospect of benefit. Furthermore, abandonment of cholesterol therapeutic goals disadvantaged people with higher levels.", 
    "223": "These problems can be overcome by basing the decision to treat on the NNT calculated both from absolute CVD risk and also on the LDL (or non-HDL) cholesterol reduction achievable with statin treatment. This need not adds an additional layer of complexity for the clinician, because computer programmes already used to estimate CVD risk could be easily amended, thus permitting more effective deployment of statins in the population.", 
    "224": "Survivors of a myocardial infarction are at increased risk for future cardiac events, including recurrent infarction, heart failure, arrhythmia, stroke, and sudden cardiac death. The primary care physician needs to be aware of the potential risks and complications facing these patients. Secondary preventive measures after myocardial infarction include an optimal medical therapy (dual antiplatelet therapy, Statin, ACE-inhibitor, and in most cases a beta-blocker) and life style modifications (quit smoking, regular physical activity, Mediterranean-style diet). Patients should be informed about how to recognize and react to cardiac symptoms."
