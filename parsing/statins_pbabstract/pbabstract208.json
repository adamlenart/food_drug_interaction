Variables related to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) carried less predictive information than those related to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and apoA-1 was the single variable most strongly associated with HF. LDL-C was less predictive than both non-HDL-C (total cholesterol minus HDL-C) and apoB. The ratio of apoB to apoA-1 was most strongly related to HF after adjustment for potential confounders, among which diabetes had a stronger correlation with HF than did hypertension. ApoB/apoA-1 carried approximately 2.2 times more of the statistical information value than that of diabetes. Calculation of the net reclassification improvement index revealed that about 3.7% of the patients had to be reclassified into more correct categories of risk once apoB/apoA-1 was added to the adjustment factors. The reduction in risk by intensive lipid-lowering treatment as compared to usual-dose simvastatin was well predicted by the difference in apoB/apoA-1 on-treatment levels.", 
    "12": "The on-treatment ratio of apoB/apoA-1 was the strongest predictor of HF in CHD patients of both IDEAL treatment arms combined, mostly driven by the strong association with apoA-1, whereas LDL-C and non-HDL-C were less able to predict HF outcome. The predictive information value contained within apoB/apoA-1 was about 2.2 times more than that of diabetes. Between-treatment group differences in HF were to a significant extent explained by on-treatment differences in apoB/apoA-1, mostly through the changes in apoB. We argue therefore, on-treatment lipoprotein components contribute to the overall future risk of HF in statin-treated patients with CHD.",

The assessment of patients before percutaneous coronary intervention is likely to change significantly. National compliance with clinical guidelines in the preprocedural assessment of myocardial ischemia should be encouraged. Multislice computed tomographic coronary angiography continues to improve and is already an excellent screening test for CAD. Coronary stenting has an increasing role in multivessel and left main CAD, although further outcome trials are indicated, especially in the elderly. Although off-pump coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery reduces postoperative atrial fibrillation, further major outcome advantages have not been shown in comprehensive meta-analyses when compared with on-pump CABG surgery. Although an intra-aortic balloon pump reduces mortality in high-risk CABG surgery, it may be replaced gradually by the percutaneous left ventricular-assist device, which has shown clinical benefit in this challenging setting. Statin therapy significantly improves clinical outcome after CABG surgery, even when begun postoperatively. There is strong evidence that, unless contraindicated, all CABG patients should receive statin therapy. Clopidogrel therapy just before CABG surgery is still associated with prolonged hospital stay because of significant bleeding complications. This risk will be exacerbated with the advent of the more potent platelet inhibitor, prasugrel. There is a clinical necessity for readily reversible platelet blockade to minimize the bleeding risks in CABG surgery.", 
    "33": "In the last half century, phenomenal advances have been made in understanding the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease and in developing therapies to reduce cardiovascular risk. Nevertheless, cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death and morbidity in the industrialized world, with rapidly rising prevalence in developing countries, accounting for approximately 30% of all deaths worldwide. Since the initial availability of statin drugs in 1987, few novel cardiovascular therapies have emerged. Whereas statins reduce the mortality and morbidity from atherosclerotic heart disease by approximately 30%, the staggering 70% residual cardiovascular risk underscores the persistent need for novel therapies. Substantial advances in genomic research offer promise to greatly facilitate cardiovascular drug development. Over the past decade, often termed \"the genomics revolution,\" such advancements as the emergence of genome-wide genotyping in humans, the industrialization of messenger ribonucleic acid expression profiling, and the maturation of proteomic and metabolomic methodologies have been made. In addition, the advancement of informatics to allow the intersection of multiple complex datasets has led to the field of systems biology. Genomic approaches are already being utilized to drive novel compound pipelines by helping with the identification and validation of novel targets. In the future, the study of genomics is expected to support biomarker discovery and development and the identification of responder patient segments. The focus of the present review is the application of genomics to the development of novel atherosclerosis therapies.", 
    "34": "An association between hyperlipidemia and hyperhomocysteinemia (HHCY) has been suggested. This link is clinically important in management of vascular risk factors especially in elderly people and patients with metabolic syndrome. Higher plasma homocysteine (Hcy) was associated with lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol level. Moreover, HHCY was associated with disturbed plasma lipids or fatty liver. It seems that hypomethylation associated with HHCY is responsible for lipid accumulation in tissues. Decreased methyl group will decrease the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, a major phospholipid required for very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) assembly and homeostasis. The effect of Hcy on HDL-cholesterol is probably related to inhibiting enzymes or molecules participating in HDL-particle assembly.",

    "39": "Statins are lipid-lowering drugs that may help limit cancer occurrence in humans. They drive blockage of the mevalonate pathway, trigger cancer cell apoptosis in vitro and reduce tumour incidence in animals. We have shown in the present study that statins induced apoptosis in HGT-1 human gastric cancer cells, and this was prevented by intermediates of the cholesterol synthetic pathway. In addition, similarly to what we have reported previously for caspase 2 [Logette, Le Jossic-Corcos, Masson, Solier, Sequeira-Legrand, Dugail, Lemaire-Ewing, Desoche, Solary and Corcos (2005) Mol. Cell. Biol. 25, 9621-9631], caspase 7 may also be induced by statins and is under the positive control of SREBP (sterol-regulatory-element-binding protein)-1 and -2, major activators of cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis genes, in HGT-1 cells. Knocking down these proteins strongly reduced caspase 7 mRNA and protein expression, and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses showed that the proximal promoter region of the CASP7 gene could bind either SREBP-1 or -2. Strikingly, cells selected to grow in the continuous presence of statins showed increased expression of caspase 7 mRNA and protein, which was maintained in the absence of statins for several weeks, suggesting that high expression of this caspase might participate in adaptation to blunting of the mevalonate pathway in this model. Taken together, our results show that caspase 7, as an SREBP-1/2 target, can be induced under mevalonate-restricting conditions, which might help overcome its shortage.",

Adjusting for categorical adherence below or above 80% by two methods revealed that the relative risk reduction of the primary endpoint was more in the region of 15% (P=0.02) than 11% as found unadjusted. Censoring at the first occurrence of a cardiovascular event rather than at death increased this estimate to 17% (P=0.02). Noncardiovascular mortality was reduced on atorvastatin treatment by 21% (1-37%) after adjustment for adherence, whereas such reduction was not observed for cardiovascular mortality.", 
    "43": "This study found that the difference in adherence between treatment groups may have underestimated the true effect of the treatment differential. Usage of prospective randomized open label endpoint evaluation design should be carefully considered when well-known treatments are compared with rather new ones and especially in segments where patients could be more vulnerable, as in the elderly. Nonadherers in a clinical trial may be at especially high risk of fatal and nonfatal endpoints from various diseases and should be carefully monitored.",

In addition, new data indicate that any BP-lowering strategy in diabetic patients needs to be continued to realise sustained benefits. The effects of blood glucose lowering have been addressed in a number of recently concluded clinical trials; together, these have failed to provide clear evidence of cardioprotection with intensive glucose control over a 4-5-year period. Long-term data, however, suggest that such benefits may only appear later. A recent meta-analysis of statin trials has confirmed the benefits of these agents in patients with diabetes. Two new trials of aspirin for 'primary prevention' of cardiovascular events in diabetic patients have failed to show benefit; however, both were underpowered.",

Prevalence was HT 29.2%, DM 4.8%, LIP 44.1% and was higher in men than in women. Disease prevalence increased with age for every CV risk factor. Men were less likely than women to take anti-HT drugs and to reach BP control (9.9% vs. 16%). Only 17.6% of HT > 65 years had a BP < or =140/90 mmHg, though 48.5% were treated. The use of statins was very low (<1/3 of eligible subjects > 65 years, those with the highest treatment rate).

There are key differences in terms of the relative importance of risk factors, particularly in the age of presentation. The female 'gender advantage' previously felt to be due to female sex hormones remains unexplained. The effects of post-menopausal hormone replacement also remain controversial. Risk can be reduced by sensible risk-factor control, but there is an ongoing imbalance between calculated risk and evidence of subclinical atherosclerosis and in women, in particular, a more proactive approach to risk reduction may be required. The controversy surrounding the effectiveness of statins in women is probably more due to problems with meta-analyses than from gender dimorphism. Cardiac rehabilitation reduces cardiac risk but women have previously been under-referred, although the benefits are equally great in both genders.", 
    "51": "There is increasing evidence linking cholesterol metabolism with the neurofibrillary pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cholesterol and its transport have been shown to be involved in the regulation of amyloid production and tau hyperphosphorylation in the brain, while also contributing to intracranial vascular disease and cerebral ischemia. Statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis thus inserting itself into the pathogenesis of AD. Numerous studies have examined the role of statins in the prevention of dementia and treatment of established AD. This paper describes the role of cholesterol in the pathogenesis of AD and explores how statins may influence this balance. A review of the epidemiological and clinical trials with statins in dementia and AD is also presented. While evidence from retrospective case control studies suggests a beneficial role of statins in the prevention of AD, a similar benefit has not been established in prospective cohort studies or clinical trials. The ability of statins in protecting against AD is not yet elucidated. In the near future recently completed but not yet reported randomized clinical trials will hopefully clarify the role of statins in the treatment of AD.",

Matching on the propensity score creates sets of treated and untreated subjects who have a similar distribution of baseline covariates. Propensity-score matching frequently relies upon calipers, such that matched treated and untreated subjects must have propensity scores that lie within a specified caliper distance of each other. We define the 'marginally matched' subject as a subject who would be matched using the specified caliper width, but who would not have been matched had calipers with a narrower width been employed. Using patients hospitalized with an acute myocardial infarction (or heart attack) and with exposure to a statin prescription at discharge, we demonstrate that the inclusion of marginally matched subjects can have both a quantitative and qualitative impact upon the estimated treatment effect. Furthermore, marginally matched treated subjects can differ from marginally matched untreated subjects to a substantially greater degree than the differences between non-marginally matched treated and untreated subjects in the propensity-score matched sample. The concept of the marginally matched subject can be used as a sensitivity analysis to examine the impact of the matching method on the estimates of treatment effectiveness.",

The benefits of atorvastatin observed in LLA were sustained throughout BPLA. At the end of BPLA, in those assigned amlodipine-based therapy, atorvastatin reduced coronary heart disease deaths and nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI) by 46% [hazard ratio 0.54, confidence interval (CI) 0.40-0.72, P < 0.0001], stroke by 37% [hazard ratio 0.63, CI 0.46-0.87, P = 0.004] and total cardiovascular events and procedures by 27% [hazard ratio 0.73, CI 0.63-0.86, P < 0.0001]. In the atenolol-based group, atorvastatin reduced coronary heart disease death and nonfatal MI by 25% [hazard ratio 0.75, CI 0.57-0.97, P = 0.03], stroke by 10% [hazard ratio 0.90, CI 0.69-1.18, P = 0.43] and total cardiovascular events and procedures by 13% [hazard ratio 0.87, CI 0.76-1.0, P = 0.05]. P values for heterogeneity were low, but failed to achieve statistical significance (0.10, 0.10 and 0.11 for chronic heart disease, stroke and total cardiovascular events, respectively).", 
    "56": "Although not statistically significant, the benefits of atorvastatin appeared greater among those on amlodipine-based compared with atenolol-based therapy. These data provide supporting evidence that coassignment to atorvastatin may have generated differential effects on coronary and other cardiovascular outcomes by amlodipine-based and atenolol-based treatment in ASCOT-BPLA.", 
    "57": "Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 is a central enzyme of arachidonic acid metabolism, and its modulation by statins may explain some of the myocardial protective effects of these drugs. Dendritic cells (DCs) play a central role in microbial defense and in atherogenesis, and COX-2 expression in DCs is important for their migration to lymph nodes and antibody response, thus explaining why prostaglandin E(2) is a main component of the cocktails used to prepare DCs for clinical applications. On this basis, we addressed the effect of atorvastatin (ATV) on the release of arachidonic acid and on the expression of COX-2 in human monocyte-derived DCs. Although ATV on its own lacked any effect on COX-2 protein induction expression, it enhanced the release of arachidonic acid, the expression of COX-2 protein, and the production of prostaglandin E(2) induced by the fungal wall extract zymosan, and to a lower extent the effect of peptidoglycan. The effect on COX-2 protein was observed mainly 24 h after stimulation by zymosan and was not reverted by mevalonate, thus pointing to an effect unrelated to cholesterol metabolism. It is noteworthy that COX-2 protein showed a great stability, with a t((1/2)) of approximately 12 h, which was enhanced in the presence of ATV. In view of the important role played by COX-2 on DC function, these data indicate that ATV, by enhancing COX-2 stability, may increase DC function after infectious bouts and also counteract some of the risks associated with sustained inhibition of COX-2.", 
    "58": "Lipid-lowering using HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors or statin therapy forms the cornerstone of medical therapy in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. In addition, to the improvements in lipid profile, the beneficial effects elicited by this class of drugs may be attributed to their diverse variety of non-lipid lowering pleiotropic effects, including improved endothelial function, reduced oxidative stress, less platelet adhesion, and increased atherosclerotic plaque stability. A less appreciated effect of statin therapy that has been reported in experimental studies is its cardioprotective effect with respect to its ability to directly protect the myocardium from the detrimental effects of acute ischaemia-reperfusion injury. In the current article we review the cardioprotective effects of statin therapy beyond serum lipid lowering, the underlying mechanisms involved and the potential implications for patients with coronary heart disease.", 
    "59": "Dyslipidemia is highly prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), contributing to their high cardiovascular morbidity/ mortality risk and kidney damage. The lipid profile of patients with CKD commonly shows elevation of triglycerides, accumulation of atherogenic lipoproteins and decrease of HDL cholesterol. Statins are as safe and secure in CKD patients as in the general population. Used as secondary prevention in predialysis patients they seem to reduce cardiovascular mortality, but such beneficence has not been confirmed in dialysis patients. Data are still lacking in primary prevention. Ongoing studies may help to draw more precise recommendations. Meanwhile, we suggest starting lipid lowering drugs as secondary prevention in all patients at all stages of CKD.",

    "61": "Economic evaluations were identified in a systematic literature search and were critically appraised. Furthermore, because prices decreased drastically, a previously published model was adapted applying recent cost data from the Belgian national health insurance. Eleven full economic evaluations were identified. Nine studies compared statins with no treatment and presented heterogeneous results. If alternative interventions, such as smoking cessation or low-dose aspirin treatment were included in the analysis, statin therapy became less cost-effective. Prescribing the cheapest statin on the Belgian market (< Euro 90 medication cost per year) resulted in an incremental cost of Euro 29,173 per life-year gained (LYG) in a male high-risk group aged 60 compared to low-dose aspirin. The incremental cost in a male moderate-risk group aged 50 was Euro 87,022/LYG. Low-dose aspirin was more cost-effective ranging from Euro 3,854/LYG to Euro 29,509/LYG compared to smoking cessation therapy. Smoking cessation therapy was the most cost-effective intervention, providing savings compared to no treatment.", 
    "62": "In Belgium, the cost-effectiveness of statins for the primary prevention of CVD is rather elevated in comparison with low-dose aspirin, even if the cheapest statin is prescribed. From an economic point of view, prevention with low-dose aspirin is more cost-effective and may present a first choice in primary prevention. Smoking cessation, which is a dominant strategy, should be encouraged at all times.", 
    "63": "Aortic stenosis is the most frequent valvular heart disease. Its spectrum ranges from severe symptomatic stenosis on one side to aortic sclerosis without hemodynamic implications on the other. Inbetween it comprises the asymptomatic patients with severe but also those with moderate and mild aortic stenosis. The poor outcome of patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis has been well documented but current results of aortic valve replacement for acquired aortic stenosis have been shown to be excellent. In contrast, the management of asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis remains a matter of controversy. Although a watchful waiting strategy is safe until symptoms develop in most patients, further risk stratification helps to identify patients who are likely to benefit from early elective surgery: the combination of a calcified valve with a rapid hemodynamic progression identifies a patient group at high-risk. There is also a role for exercise testing in asymptomatic patients with severe aortic stenosis for risk stratification and in unmasking symptoms. It should be considered that rapid progression from mild or moderate to severe stenosis is common and may be more rapid than previously assumed.", 
    "64": "Atorvastatin (AVA) is a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor. AVA exposure resulted in the reduced in vitro growth of 22 Plasmodium falciparum strains, with the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)s) ranging from 2.5 microM to 10.8 microM. A significant positive correlation was found between the strains' responses to AVA and mefloquine (r = 0.553; P = 0.008). We found no correlation between the responses to AVA and to chloroquine, quinine, monodesethylamodiaquine, lumefantrine, dihydroartemisinin, atovaquone, or doxycycline. These data could suggest that the mechanism of AVA uptake and/or the mode of action of AVA is different from those for other antimalarial drugs. The IC(50)s for AVA were unrelated to the occurrence of mutations in the transport protein genes involved in quinoline antimalarial drug resistance, such as the P. falciparum crt, mdr1, mrp, and nhe-1 genes. Therefore, AVA can be ruled out as a substrate for the transport proteins (CRT, Pgh1, and MRP) and is not subject to the pH modification induced by the P. falciparum NHE-1 protein. The absence of in vitro cross-resistance between AVA and chloroquine, quinine, mefloquine, monodesethylamodiaquine, lumefantrine, dihydroartemisinin, atovaquone, and doxycycline argues that these antimalarial drugs could potentially be paired with AVA as a treatment for malaria. In conclusion, the present observations suggest that AVA is a good candidate for further studies on the use of statins in association with drugs known to have activities against the malaria parasite.", 
    "65": "We investigated the effect of atorvastatin on the plasma concentration of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) and nitric oxide (NO) in a rabbit model, and the relationship between these effects and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3 (PPAR-\u03b3). In our experiments, 24 male Japanese rabbits were divided into 3 groups: the high-cholesterol diet group (the high-C group), the high-cholesterol diet plus atorvastatin group (the atorvastatin group), and the normal diet group (the control group). All rabbits were killed after a 16-week feeding. The expression of PPAR-\u03b3 and the plasma concentrations of NO and PAI-1 were evaluated by an immunohistochemical assay while the level of the plasma lipid profile was measured using a commercially available kit. The atorvastatin not only reduces the plasma levels of the total cholesterol (TC) and the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), but also increases the expression of PPAR-\u03b3 and the concentration of NO in comparison to the control group [16.11 \u00b1 2.35% vs 7.68 \u00b1 1.04%; 249.30 \u00b1 27.90 vs 179.12 \u00b1 28.51 (\u03bcml/L), p<0.05 respectively]. In addition, the concentration of PAI-1 in the atorvastatin group is lower than that in the control group (0.11 \u00b1 0.01A vs 0.14 \u00b1 0.02A, p<0.05). The changes of PAI-1 and NO in the atorvastatin group are in good accordance to that of PPAR-\u03b3. Results show that atorvastatin significantly up-regulates the expression of nuclear transcription factor, namely PPAR-\u03b3, and induces the changes of the other two factors, which might provide mechanisms for the antiatherosclerotic and antithrombotic effects of atorvastatin.", 
    "66": "Myocardial ischemic preconditioning is a procedure giving powerful protection against myocardial ischemia and infarction. Clinical application of this property to anesthesia might improve anesthetic management of patients with cardiac diseases. Volatile anesthetics, including sevoflurane and isoflurane, can protect ischemic myocardium by activation of ATP-sensitive K channels (K(ATP)) and several clinical trials show that volatile anesthetics can prevent myocardial damage during operations compared with propofol, a popular intravenous anesthetic. Nicorandil is a potent K(ATP) opener and clinical application of nicorandil also can reduce myocardial damage during anesthetic management of patients undergoing off-pump CABG and patients with cardiac risks undergoing non-cardiac operations. In addition, diabetes mellitus and hyperglycemia may abolish the protective effect of preconditioning by impairing K(ATP). From point of view of clinical application of preconditioning, anesthetic maintenance with volatile anesthetics instead of intravenous anesthetics, such as propofol, and administration of nicorandil throughout perioperative period, is recommended to patients with heart diseases and control of blood glucose is useful to maintain the protective effect of preconditioning.",

Lifelong hypercholesterolemia is strongly associated with increasing risk of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease death, but the decision to treat pharmacologically depends on the absolute cardiovascular risk over the next 10 years. Clinical trial data support intensive treatment of patients at high cardiovascular risk or for the secondary prevention of recurrent coronary heart disease.

The lifetime cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated to be 15,000 Euro per quality-adjusted life year gained. In the age categories 70-79 years and 80 years or above, an additional 600,000 and 450,000 persons, respectively, would need to be treated, resulting in corresponding reductions in cumulative incidences of 14 and 18% (acute myocardial infarction), 17 and 22% (stroke), and 1.2 and 0.6% (all-cause mortality) with cost-effectiveness ratios of 20,800 and 32,300 Euro, respectively, per quality-adjusted life year.",

Subjects underwent a primed-constant infusion of a stable isotope in the fed state. The coadministration of simvastatin and ezetimibe significantly reduced plasma concentrations of cholesterol (-43.0%), LDL-C (-53.6%), and triglycerides (-44.0%). Triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL) apoB-48 pool size (PS) was significantly decreased (-48.9%) following combination therapy mainly through a significant reduction in TRL apoB-48 production rate (PR) (-38.0%). The fractional catabolic rate (FCR) of VLDL and LDL apoB-100 were significantly increased with all treatment modalities compared with placebo, leading to a significant reduction in the PS of these fractions. We also observed a positive correlation between changes in TRL apoB-48 PS and changes in TRL apoB-48 PR (r = 0.85; P < 0.0001) with combination therapy. Our results indicate that treatment with simvastatin plus ezetimibe is effective in reducing plasma TRL apoB-48 levels and that this effect is most likely mediated by a reduction in the intestinal secretion of TRL apoB-48. Our study also indicated that the reduction in LDL-C concentration following combination therapy is mainly driven by an increase in FCR of apoB-100 containing lipoproteins.",

Changes in the ratio of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) subfractions may alter the stability and the antioxidant capacity of PON1. The aim of the study was to examine the effect of atorvastatin treatment on the distribution of HDL subfractions, LDL size, cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), and PON1 activity. In all, 33 patients with type IIa and IIb hypercholesterolemia were involved in the study. LDL sizes and HDL subfractions were determined by gradient gel electrophoresis. CETP, LCAT, and PON1 activities were measured spectrophotometrically. Three months of treatment with atorvastatin 20 mg daily significantly increased the HDL3 (+8.13%) and decreased the HDL2a and HDL2b subfractions (-1.57% and -6.55%, respectively). The mean LDL size was significantly increased (+3.29%). The level of oxidized LDL was significantly decreased (-46.0%). The PON1 activity was augmented by the atorvastatin treatment (+5.0%). The CETP activity positively correlated with the HDL2b level and negatively correlated with the HDL3 and HDL2a levels. Atorvastatin alters the HDL subfractions, which may improve its antiatherogenic effect via enhancement of the PON1 activity.",

In the present study, we investigated whether simvastatin treatment changed the levels of autoantibodies against specific oxidized LDL (oxLDL) antigens as well as their association with leukocyte activation markers. Eighty volunteers with mild-to-moderate hypercholesterolemia were randomized to either simvastatin 40 mg or placebo for 6 weeks. Autoantibodies against apo B peptide antigens, C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin (IL)-6 in plasma were determined by ELISA. Subsets of circulating B and T cells were studied by flow cytometry.

The P-240 IgG levels after 6 weeks simvastatin therapy was strongly correlated to the relative increase in CD57+CD28 - CD8+T cells (p = 0.003). Simvastatin treatment induced an increase in autoantibodies against an oxLDL antigen.

    "95": "Matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) may play an important role in emphysematous change in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), one of the leading causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. We previously reported that simvastatin, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, attenuates emphysematous change and MMP-9 induction in the lungs of rats exposed to cigarette smoke. However, it remained uncertain how cigarette smoke induced MMP-9 and how simvastatin inhibited cigarette smoke-induced MMP-9 expression in alveolar macrophages (AMs), a major source of MMP-9 in the lungs of COPD patients. Presently, we examined the related signaling for MMP-9 induction and the inhibitory mechanism of simvastatin on MMP-9 induction in AMs exposed to cigarette smoke extract (CSE). In isolated rat AMs, CSE induced MMP-9 expression and phosphorylation of ERK and Akt. A chemical inhibitor of MEK1/2 or PI3K reduced phosphorylation of ERK or Akt, respectively, and also inhibited CSE-mediated MMP-9 induction. Simvastatin reduced CSE-mediated MMP-9 induction, and simvastatin-mediated inhibition was reversed by farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP). Similar to simvastatin, inhibition of FPP transferase or GGPP transferase suppressed CSE-mediated MMP-9 induction. Simvastatin attenuated CSE-mediated activation of RAS and phosphorylation of ERK, Akt, p65, IkappaB, and nuclear AP-1 or NF-kappaB activity. Taken together, these results suggest that simvastatin may inhibit CSE-mediated MMP-9 induction, primarily by blocking prenylation of RAS in the signaling pathways, in which Raf-MEK-ERK, PI3K/Akt, AP-1, and IkappaB-NF-kappaB are involved.",

The latter concept provides the mechanism by which statins selectively lower plasma LDL, reducing heart attacks and prolonging life.", 
    "97": "Theca-interstitial (T-I) cells of the ovary synthesize androgens in response to luteinizing hormone (LH). In pathological conditions such as polycystic ovarian syndrome, T-I cells are hyperactive in androgen production in response to LH and insulin. Because cholesterol is an essential substrate for androgen production, we examined the effect of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and insulin on signaling pathways that are known to increase cholesterol accumulation in steroidogenic cells. Specifically, the effect of hCG and insulin on sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1a (SREBF1a) required for cholesterol biosynthesis and uptake was examined. Primary cultures of T-I cells isolated from 25-day-old rat ovaries responded to hCG and insulin to increase the active/processed form of SREBF1a. The hCG and insulin significantly reduced insulin-induced gene 1 (INSIG1) protein, a negative regulator of SREBF processing. Furthermore, an increase in the expression of selected SREBF target genes, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (Hmgcr) and mevalonate kinase (Mvk), was also observed. Protein kinase A (PRKA) inhibitor completely abolished the hCG-induced increase in SREBF1a, while increasing INSIG1. Although the hCG-induced depletion of total and free cholesterol was abolished by aminoglutethimide, the stimulatory effect on SREBF1a was not totally suppressed. Treatment with 25-hydroxycholesterol abrogated the effect of hCG on SREBF1a. Inhibition of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway did not block the insulin-induced increase in SREBF1a, whereas mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibition reduced the insulin response. These results suggest that the increased androgen biosynthesis by T-I cells in response to hCG and insulin is regulated, at least in part, by increasing the expression of sterol response element-responsive genes by increasing SREBF1a.", 
    "98": "Takayasu arteritis (TA) is an uncommon large-vessel arteritis. We report our French single-center experience in the management of patients with TA (Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re Hospital, Paris). TA is diagnosed in patients presenting with a large-vessel arteriopathy, in whom several inflammatory and non-inflammatory differential diagnoses are ruled out by appropriate investigations. Treatment of active disease is primarily based on corticosteroids but other immunosuppressive drugs are frequently needed. Anti-platelets agents, statins and antihypertensive drugs are frequently considered. There is no validated disease activity criterion in TA; thus, we generally consider the disease as being active in the presence of the following criteria: firstly, the presence of constitutional or ischemic symptoms; secondly, the increased acute phase reactants; thirdly, the mural contrast enhancement in CT-scan or fourthly, the mural contrast enhancement or signal abnormalities in MRI; fifthly, the abnormal vascular uptake in PET-scan. When TA is active, our follow-up recommendation is to perform an ultrasonography of the supra-aortic vessels and an aortic MRI or CT-scan twice a year. When TA appears to be inactive, we recommend to perform these investigations once a year. Surgical treatment of TA is limited to a few indications. The overall prognosis of TA is good but the quality of life is altered. Management of TA patients is difficult because of the lack of reliable diagnostic criteria, consensual therapeutic strategies and validated disease activity criteria. Further studies should focus on the pathogenesis of the disease and help define better disease activity criteria.",

The rats were randomized into four groups after seven standard lesions were inflicted in each uterine horn and lower abdominal sidewall using bipolar cauterization. The rats were given atorvastatin 2.5 mg/kg/day, p.o. (10 rats), atorvastatin 30 mg/kg/day, p.o. (10 rats), metformin 50 mg/kg/day, p.o. (10 rats) and no treatment was applied in the control group (10 rats). The animals were killed 2 weeks later and adhesions were scored both clinically and pathologically by authors blinded to groups. One rat in the control group died before the end of the 2 week period. Total clinical adhesion scores regarding extent, severity and degree of adhesions and histopathological findings including inflammation and fibrosis were significantly lower in the metformin (P < 0.001 and P < 0.01, respectively) and atorvastatin 30 mg/kg/day (P < 0.001 and P < 0.01, respectively) groups when compared with control group. Metformin and atorvastatin are both effective for prevention of adhesion formation in a rat uterine horn model.", 
    "100": "Eugenosedin-A is a serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) 5-HT(1B/2A) and alpha(1)/alpha(2)/beta(1)-adrenoceptor blocker with anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory and free-radical scavenging activities. Previous reports demonstrated that 5-HT(2A) blockers could diminish hyperlipidaemia. This study therefore aimed to investigate the possible uses and mechanisms of eugenosedin-A and other agents in treating hyperlipidaemia.", 
    "101": "C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into seven groups, fed a regular diet or a high-fat diet alone or supplemented with one of five agents: eugenosedin-A, ketanserin, prazosin, propranolol or atorvastatin (5 mg/kg p.o.) for 8 weeks.", 
    "102": "Compared with the regular diet, the mice fed the high-fat diet had significantly higher body weight and glucose, insulin and lipid levels. Brain malondialdehyde concentration was increased and liver glutathione peroxidase activity decreased. Addition of eugenosedin-A to the high-fat diet resulted in less weight gain and reduced hyperglycaemia, hyperinsulinaemia and hyperlipidaemia. Lipid and glucose homeostasis were related to decreased hepatic lipogenesis mRNAs and proteins (sterol regulatory element binding protein 1a, fatty acid synthase, sterol-CoA desaturase) and restored adipose peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma expression. Eugenosedin-A also enhanced low-density lipoprotein receptor mRNA expression.", 
    "103": "Eugenosedin-A may improve plasma lipid metabolism by increasing low-density lipoprotein receptor and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma expression and diminishing sterol regulatory element binding protein 1a, fatty acid synthase and sterol-CoA desaturase. Reduction of plasma glucose and lipid levels may, in turn, reduce insulin concentration, which would explain the marked improvement in obesity-related hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidaemia. Furthermore, eugenosedin-A affected malondialdehyde concentration and glutathione peroxidase activity, suggesting it may have anti-peroxidation effects in mice fed a high-fat diet.", 
    "104": "Increasing evidence suggests that cardiomyocyte apoptosis has an important role in the transition from compensatory cardiac remodelling to heart failure. The synergistic effect of statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) and angiotensin II (Ang II) type 1 receptor antagonists reduces the incidence of cardiovascular events. However, the anti-apoptotic potential of the synergism between losartan and simvastatin in heart failure remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that Ang II-induced apoptosis is prevented by losartan and simvastatin in neonatal cardiomyocytes.", 
    "105": "The in-vitro cardiomyocyte apoptosis model was established by co-culturing neonate rat cardiomyocytes with Ang II. Cell viability was analysed by the MTT assay. Cell apoptosis was evaluated using fluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry. Apoptosis-related proteins Bax and Bcl-2 expressions were measured by flow cytometry detection.", 
    "106": "Incubation with 10(-7) M Ang II for 48 h increased cardiomyocyte apoptosis and decreased cell viability. Losartan (10(-5) M) and simvastatin (10(-5) M), either alone or in combination, significantly decreased Ang II-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis and increased cell viability. The q values calculated by the probability sum test were 1.31 for cardiomyocyte apoptosis and 1.21 for cell viability. Ang II induced a significant increase in Bax protein expression, whereas Bcl-2 protein expression was decreased. Losartan alone or in combination with simvastatin blocked the increased Bax expression and increased Bcl-2 expression. However, simvastatin had no such effect.", 
    "107": "Our data provide the first evidence that synergism of simvastatin with losartan prevents angiotensin II-induced cardiomyocyte apoptosis in vitro. Synergism between simvastatin and losartan may provide a new therapeutic approach to the prevention of cardiac remodelling.", 
    "108": "In several statin trials, vascular event rates for treatment groups begin to separate 1 year after commencement of treatment. For atherosclerosis progression, the temporal sequence of the effect has not been defined. We used data from the Measuring Effects on intima media Thickness: an Evaluation Of Rosuvastatin (METEOR) trial to determine the earliest time point at which significant differences in atherosclerosis progression rates could be detected after initiation of statin therapy.", 
    "109": "The METEOR trial was a double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial that studied the effect of LDL-C lowering with 40 mg rosuvastatin on the rate of change of carotid intima media thickness (CIMT) measured by B-mode ultrasound amongst 984 low risk subjects. Ultrasound assessments were made at baseline and every 6 months up to 2 years.", 
    "110": "Rosuvastatin treatment was associated with a 49% reduction in LDL-C-C, a 34% reduction in total cholesterol, an 8.0% increase in HDL-C and a 16% reduction in triglycerides (all P < 0.0001 compared with placebo). The difference in rate of mean maximum CIMT progression between the rosuvastatin and placebo groups (based on near and far wall measurements from both left and right common carotid and internal carotid segments and carotid bifurcation) was not statistically significant after 6 months (0.0023 mm year(-1) and 0.0106 mm year(-1), respectively P = 0.34). After 12 months, CIMT progression rates were significantly different between the groups: 0.0032 mm year(-1) and 0.0133 mm year(-1) in the rosuvastatin-treated and placebo-treated groups, respectively (P = 0.049). This divergence grew with further follow-up: -0.0009 mm year(-1) and 0.0131 mm year(-1) after 18 months (P < 0.001) and -0.0014 mm year(-1) and 0.0131 mm year(-1) after 24 months of treatment (P < 0.001). Results were stronger for the mean common CIMT progression (based on near and far wall measurements from both left and right common carotid segments).", 
    "111": "Aggressive LDL-C lowering seems to exert its beneficial effect on atherosclerosis progression during the first 12 months of treatment. This parallels the timing of event reduction seen in clinical trials and suggests that the efficacy of lipid lowering treatment on CIMT progression can be evaluated in trials with a duration of 1 year, given sufficient sample size, high precision of measurements and a treatment effect comparable to that seen in METEOR.", 
    "112": "Measles virus remains a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality, producing acute infection with a potential for development of viral persistence. To study the events underlying acute and persistent measles virus infection, we performed a global transcriptional analysis on murine neuroblastoma cells that were acutely or persistently infected with measles virus. In general, we found that acute infection induced significantly more gene expression changes than did persistent infection. A functional enrichment analysis to identify which host pathways were perturbed during each of these infections identified several pathways related to cholesterol biosynthesis, including cholesterol metabolic processes, hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (CoA) reductase activity, and acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase activity. We also found that measles virus colocalized to lipid rafts in both acute and persistent infection models and that the majority of genes associated with cholesterol synthesis were downregulated in persistent infection relative to acute infection, suggesting a possible link with the defective viral budding in persistent infection. Further, we found that pharmacological inhibition of cholesterol synthesis resulted in the inhibition of viral budding during acute infection. In summary, persistent measles viral infection was associated with decreased cholesterol synthesis, a lower abundance of cholesterol and lipid rafts in the cell membrane, and inhibition of giant-cell formation and release of viral progeny.", 
    "113": "The recent JUPITER (Justification for the Use of statins in Primary prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin) trial is another study providing evidence about the effectiveness of statin therapy in reducing cardiovascular risk. Yet, in this study significantly higher glycated hemoglobin levels and incidence rates of diabetes were observed in persons treated with rosuvastatin than the placebo group. It should be noted that adverse effects on glucose metabolism have already been reported, albeit rarely, in previous trials with statins. Although the exact mechanisms involved are unknown, it seems that statins may deteriorate glycemic control by decreasing different metabolites, including isoprenoid and ubiquinone, normally produced during the process of cholesterol synthesis. We therefore suggest that, if statins are prescribed, patients should be monitored closely for blood glucose control even though the higher incidence of diabetes by statin therapy may represent a rare finding.", 
    "114": "Although it has been demonstrated that statins stabilize atherosclerotic lesions in animal models of advanced atherosclerosis, there is little evidence to suggest that statins have a preventive effect on plaque rupture itself. In the present study, we examined the effect of fluvastatin on plaque disruption using a simple and quick method of plaque disruption in carotid artery lesions in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice. Male apolipoprotein E-deficient mice received normal chow and underwent ligation of the left common carotid artery just proximal to its bifurcation. Four weeks later, a polyethylene cuff was placed around the artery immediately proximal to the ligation site. Fluvastatin (10mg/kg per day) was given by oral gavage every day starting at 3 days before cuff placement. The administration of fluvastatin suppressed atherosclerotic plaque disruption accompanied by luminal thrombi by 31.5% compared with controls at 4 days after the cuff was placed at the ligated carotid artery. Fluvastatin administration decreased matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression, gelatinolytic activity, endothelial adhesion molecules expression and neutrophil infiltration, and increased type I collagen content in the cuffed region. In summary, fluvastatin was found to prevent plaque disruption through pleiotropic effect on acute inflammation in an animal model using apolipoprotein E-deficient mice.", 
    "115": "Despite potent antibiotics, community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) remains the most common cause of death from infection and the seventh overall leading cause of death in the United States. For this reason, interest has been redirected into non-antibiotic therapeutic measures. Despite theoretical benefits, the existing literature does not suggest a clear benefit for corticosteroid treatment, but large prospective randomized trials are needed. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs may benefit oxygenation but have no documented effect on mortality. Activation of the coagulation system appears to be a major pathophysiological event in severe pneumonia, possibly even more so than for sepsis in general. The CAP subgroup in phase III sepsis trials of both drotrecogin alfa (activated) and tifacogin (recombinant tissue factor pathway inhibitor) demonstrated the greatest benefit. The immunomodulatory effects of macrolide antibiotics may play a significant role in management of severe CAP. Exogenous surfactant replacement is being explored as adjunctive therapy for acute lung injury due to CAP. Statin use before CAP diagnosis is associated with improved outcome but requires further research to determine if initiation at the time of diagnosis will affect outcome. Other therapies have theoretical benefit but are not yet in the stage of clinical trials.", 
    "116": "Bone marrow (BM)-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) contribute to vascular maintenance by participating in angiogenesis, re-endothelialization, and remodeling. Myeloid progenitor cells in the BM are functionally and quantitatively an important precursor pool for cells that contribute to these processes. However, these precursor pools in the BM also give rise to important effector cells of the innate immune system, such as macrophages and dendritic cells. We hypothesized that the disturbed repair responses that are being observed in diabetes mellitus are also related to an effect on functional and differentiation characteristics at the level of this bone marrow precursor pool. Indeed, we observed that bone marrow differentiation cultures for EPC, macrophages (Mph), or dendritic cells (DC) from hyperglycemic BM yielded 40% fewer EPC and 50% more Mph compared with control BM. These changes were directly related to the hemoglobin A(1C) levels of the donor mice. BM-derived DC numbers were not affected by hyperglycemia. The composition of the BM was not altered; in particular, the numbers of CD31+/Ly6C+ cells, which serve as common progenitors for EPC, Mph, and DC, were unaffected. In addition, BM-derived EPC from hyperglycemic mice were less angiogenic and more proinflammatory in regards to endocytosis, T-cell activation, and interleukin 12 production. HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase inhibition by statin supplementation of the culture medium counteracted these hyperglycemia-induced changes. Our study results show that hyperglycemia alters the differentiation fate of BM precursor cells, reducing the potential to generate vascular regenerative cells and favoring the development of proinflammatory cells.", 
    "117": "Despite statin treatment, hyperlipidemia remains problematic after cardiac transplantation and is associated with the development of cardiac allograft vasculopathy. The cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe may offer a viable option for add on therapy; however, questions have been raised regarding the safety of this during concomitant cyclosporin treatment.", 
    "118": "This is the first placebo controlled, randomized double blinded trial assessing the efficacy and tolerability of ezetimibe in cardiac transplant recipients receiving cyclosporin. Sixty-eight cardiac transplant patients were randomized to receive ezetimibe (10 mg) or matching placebo for 6 months in addition to usual treatments. Fasting blood tests were performed at regular time intervals during the study.", 
    "119": "Fifty-nine patients completed the study. At 6 months, ezetimibe had reduced total cholesterol by 18% (5.4+/-1.1 to 4.4+/-0.7 mmol/L, P<0.001), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 26% (3.0+/-1.0 to 2.1+/-0.7 mmol/L, P<0.001), and triglycerides by 13.5% (2.3+/-1.3 to 1.8+/-0.9 mmol/L, P=0.02). Tolerability was excellent with no patients experiencing predefined safety endpoints. An equal number of patients withdrew consent from each arm of the study because of perceived side effects. Specific analysis confirmed ezetimibe had no significant effect on cyclosporin levels.", 
    "120": "We conclude that ezetimibe is both efficacious and tolerable in cardiac transplant recipients taking cyclosporin. It can be safely considered as add on therapy in patients taking statins (or as monotherapy) to further reduce low-density lipoprotein levels, which may in turn reduce the risk of cardiac allograft vasculopathy.", 
    "121": "Aggressive treatment with high-dose atorvastatin reduces more effectively the incidence of cardiovascular events than moderate statin therapy. The mechanism of this benefit has not been fully elucidated. In order to know the potential effects of statin treatment on the protein expression of circulating monocytes in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients, a proteomic analysis of these cells was carried out by 2-DE and MS. Twenty-five patients with non-ST-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTEACS) were randomized, the fourth day after admission, to receive ATV 80 mg/dL (n = 14) or conventional treatment (CT) (n = 11), for two months. Blood was withdrawn at the end of the treatment, and monocytes were extracted for proteomic analysis and their protein expression patterns determined. Age, sex, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, triglycerides, body mass index, presence of hypertension, diabetes, and smoking status were not significantly different between the two groups of patients. The expression of 20 proteins was modified by intensive ATV. Among the most relevant results stand out the normalization by intensive ATV treatment of the expression of proteins that modulate inflammation and thrombosis such as protein disulfide isomerase ER60 (PDI), Annexin I, and prohibitin, or that have other protective effects as HSP-70. Thus, this approach shed light at the molecular level of the beneficial mechanisms of anti-atherothrombotic drugs.", 
    "122": "Although endothelium-dependent vasodilatation has been used as a marker of endothelial dysfunction (ED), there have been no reliable plasma markers for ED. Oxidative stress, which is a major determinant of ED, oxidizes tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), an essential cofactor of endothelial type nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and resulted in the relative deficiency of BH4.", 
    "123": "In 163 patients with cardiovascular disorders, the plasma levels of BH4 and 7, 8-dihydrobiopterin (BH2) by high performance liquid chromatography were measured and compared with the flow-mediated (FMD) vasodilatory response of the brachial artery, which was measured by ultrasonography. The effects of atorvastatin on plasma pteridine levels and FMD were examined in patients with multiple coronary risk factors. There was a positive relationship between FMD and plasma BH4 levels and a negative relationship between FMD and plasma BH2 levels. Subsequently, a strong positive relationship between FMD and the BH4/BH2 ratio (r=0.585, P<0.0001) was found. Although we did not find any significant relationship between pteridine levels and individual traditional risk factors, the BH4/BH2 ratio in patients with more than 2 risk factors showed significant reductions compared with that in those without risk factors. Statin treatment improved FMD in association with an increase in the plasma BH4/BH2 ratio.", 
    "124": "Plasma pteridine levels were associated with endothelial dysfunction in cardiovascular disorders.", 
    "125": "Due to their potential role in preventing further deterioration of Parkinson's disease, anti-inflammatory strategies have attracted great interest. In this context, some studies point out the possible protective effect of anti-inflammatory compounds against the in vivo degeneration of dopaminergic neurons produced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory processes and others. We have investigated the effect of the treatment of Zocor Forte (simvastatin) in LPS and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) neurodegenerative models to identify neuroprotective drugs for Parkinson's disease. We have perfused different concentrations of LPS or 1 mM 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium ion (MPP+) in the rat's striatum, 24 h after implanting a brain microdialysis probe, both with and without Zocor Forte (simvastatin) treatment. Results show that LPS perfusion produced a decrease in the basal release of dopamine. Forty-eight hours after implanting the probe, we have perfused 1 mM MPP+ to check the integrity of the dopaminergic terminals present around the cannula. Our model to study toxicity in the striatal dopaminergic terminals suggests that Zocor Forte (simvastatin) could prevent the neurotoxic damage produced by LPS, but not that produced by MPP+.", 
    "126": "Previous reports have indicated that statins could prevent bone loss in ovariectomized (OVX) rats and increase the expressions of osteogenic genes in cultured osteoblasts. In this study, we hypothesized that simvastatin might increase osteoblast number and protein expressions of osteogenic markers localized in bones in concomitance with the prevention of bone loss in OVX rats.", 
    "127": "Fifty-four 3-month-old OVX and sham-operated (SHAM) female Sprague-Dawley rats were used. Simvastatin (10-20 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) was administrated orally for 6 weeks. Trabecular volume, osteoblast number and osteogenic proteins including BMP2, collagen type I and osteocalcin on bone sections obtained from lumbar vertebral body, distal femur and proximal tibia were measured.", 
    "128": "The results showed that SHAM rats had significantly less trabecular bone volume and osteoblast number than that of OVX rats 6 weeks after operation. Oral simvastatin treatment (10-20 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) increased bone volume and osteoblast number in the distal femurs, proximal tibiae and vertebrae of OVX rats. Furthermore, the osteoblastic cells with immuno-stained BMP2, collagen type I and osteocalcin in vertebral bones were significantly increased by simvastatin treatment (20 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) in OVX rats.", 
    "129": "This study demonstrates that simvastatin enhances the production of osteogenic proteins in bone and this effect may contribute to the prevention of bone loss in OVX rats.", 
    "130": "Statins reduce cholesterol biosynthesis by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase and thereby lower total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels in serum, which in turn lower the incidence of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Statins are also known to modulate various cellular functions such as gene expression, cell proliferation, and programmed cell death through inhibition of downstream intermediates in cholesterol synthesis. In this study, we have investigated the possible effects of statins on the secretion of serum albumin from cultured HepG2 cells since high levels of serum albumin are associated with reduced risks for CVD and statins are effective in lowering the risk of CVD through other effects in addition to their effects on serum total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels, known as pleiotropic effects. Our results showed that simvastatin increased HSA secretion up to 32.3% compared to the control group. Among 3 statin analogs we tested, simvastatin exhibited the highest stimulatory effects on HSA secretion compared to the control group. Our study also showed that the increased HSA secretions from HepG2 cells by simvastatin treatments were due to the increased rate of HSA synthesis, not due to the reduced posttranslational degradation rate of HSA. Our finding suggests another added benefit of statins' treatments in preventing CVD through stimulation of HSA biosynthesis.", 
    "131": "Endotoxemia is well known to be associated with an excessive host response to bacteria or microbial compounds, resulting in systemic inflammation and organ injury. The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of simvastatin on endotoxemic liver injury.", 
    "132": "Male C57BL/6J mice were challenged intraperitoneally with 0.5 mg/kg Escherichia coli-lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and 0.9 g/kg d-galactosamine (Gal). Mice were pretreated with 0.2 mg/kg simvastatin. Lipopolysaccharide/d-Gal-injected mice without simvastatin served as endotoxemic controls, and sham mice served as negative controls. Additional mice were challenged with LPS/d-Gal and co-treated with simvastatin and 10 mg/kg mevalonate to determine the role of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase. After 6 hours of endotoxemia serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activities as well as caspase-3 and myeloperoxidase activity were determined.", 
    "133": "Endotoxemia caused a substantial hepatocellular injury as indicated by significantly elevated serum ALT and AST levels and hepatocellular apoptosis. Leukocyte infiltration in the liver was significantly elevated in endotoxemic mice. Simvastatin significantly reduced endotoxin-induced hepatocellular damage and apoptosis. Moreover, hepatic accumulation of leukocytes was attenuated by simvastatin in endotoxemic animals. Co-administration of mevalonate abolished protective effects of simvastatin on endotoxin-provoked increases in ALT, AST, and hepatocellular apoptosis as well as leukocyte recruitment.", 
    "134": "Simvastatin has the capacity to prevent endotoxemic liver injury by inhibiting leukocyte infiltration and hepatocellular apoptosis. These protective effects exerted by simvastatin are dependent on the 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase pathway. Thus, simvastatin may represent a potential approach to prevent endotoxemia-associated liver dysfunction.", 
    "135": "Digoxin and ouabain are steroid drugs that inhibit the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase, and are widely used in the treatment of heart diseases. They may also have additional effects, such as on metabolism of steroid hormones, although until now no evidence has been provided about the effects of these cardioactive glycosides on the synthesis of cholesterol. Here we report that digoxin and ouabain increased the synthesis of cholesterol in human liver HepG2 cells, enhancing the activity and the expression of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), the rate-limiting enzyme of the cholesterol synthesis. This effect was mediated by the binding of the sterol regulatory element binding protein-2 (SREBP-2) to the HMGCR promoter, and was lost in cells silenced for SREBP-2 or loaded with increasing amounts of cholesterol. Digoxin and ouabain competed with cholesterol for binding to the SREBP-cleavage-activating protein, and are critical regulators of cholesterol synthesis in human liver cells.", 
    "136": "It has recently been proposed that statins act as vitamin D analogs in binding the ubiquitously expressed vitamin D receptor, accounting for the perceived pleiotropic effects of statins (a reduction in cancer risk, prevention of organ transplant rejection and autoimmune disease). Chronic kidney disease (CKD) offers a useful test of this hypothesis: serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels are insufficient (<75 nmol/l) in as many as 76% of patients with advanced CKD, associated with secondary hyperparathyroidism and reduced bone mineralization. Vitamin D suppresses parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion in part through its action on the vitamin D receptor. If statins act as vitamin D analogs, they may then be able to suppress PTH secretion in CKD. We examined data on 714 vitamin D analog na\u00efve patients with stage 3-4 CKD. 404 patients were treated with a statin indicated almost exclusively for primary prevention of coronary heart disease, and 310 patients were not. Both groups were similar in characteristics. Statins had no effect on the intact PTH concentration, the percentage of patients achieving K/DOQI PTH targets, or on calcium or phosphate concentrations. In patients with stage 3-4 CKD, statins had no effect on secondary hyperparathyroidism. If the hypothesis contending that statins act as vitamin D analogs to exert pleiotropic effects is true, this is of no clinical benefit in the prevention of secondary hyperparathyroidism in CKD.",

Calibration curves for TRF and SIM were linear over concentration range of 20-80 microg/mL and 1-10 microg/mL with correlation coefficients 0.9990 and 0.9991, respectively. The recovery of TRF and SIM from the NPs was in the range from 97.35 to 102.19% and from 92.71 to 104.35%, respectively.

After six months, simvastatin significantly lowered CRP levels by 19%, (p<0,01), cholesterol levels by 18%, TG levels by 8%, LDL levels by 20% and VLDL levels by 17%, whereas there was no change with placebo. After one year the difference sustained between groups. Coronary events were rarely in the simvastatin group (6,6%) than in the placebo group (14%). Coronary revascularizations were 4 in the placebo group and 1 in the simvastatin group. Rate of stroke was more often in the placebo group (18%) than in the simvastatin group (8,8%). So, reduction of acute CHD events is for 7,4% in the simvastatin group. Positive correlation was between CRP and CVD (r=0,29).

At currently, thrombolysis is accepted as standard therapy when PCI is not immediately available. However, PCI is often performed in stable patients with AMI who are/are not received thrombolysis . We performed the trial that enrolled myocardial infarction patients treated with thrombolysis, late PCI and medically to assess the potential benefits of delayed PCI. We follow up 164 consecutive patients after AMI one year. The patients are divided in two groups; first group-66 patients who received reperfusion (37 patients received only thrombolysis, 10 patients received thrombolysis and PCI 7-9 days after thrombolysis and 19 patients underwent only PCI after 7-9 days) and second group-98 patients medically treated.

Dual antiplatelet treatment (APLT) for 12 months received 93%, more than 12 months 72% and statin treatment 93% of patients. Clinical follow-up of at least 12 months post DES implantation was obtained in 597/610 (98%) patients. The incidence of VLST was 1.8%, and 1.7% of patients developed stent thrombosis (ST) up to 12 months. All patients with VLST presented with sudden cardiac death and 82% were on dual APLT at the time of the event. In a multivariate model the only predictor for VLST (HR: 20.58, 95% CI 5.17-81.90, p < 0.001) and overall ST (HR: 4.38, 95% CI 1.73-11.10, p = 0.002) was ejection fraction < 40%.",

    "151": "The combination of independent risk factors for erectile dysfunction, obesity, hypertension, and diabetes are collectively manifested in a condition known as metabolic syndrome X (MSX). However, the regulatory mechanisms responsible for the erectile dysfunction (ED) are not fully understood. Clinical studies suggest that a pleiotropic effect of statin's ability to enhance vascular relaxation might be through an impact on nitric oxide signaling or through a regulation of RhoA activation.",

    "154": "Erectile function was evaluated by assessing voltage-dependent stimulation of the cavernosal nerve in 16-20 weeks old lean and obese-diabetic Zucker rats treated with 5 mg/kg/day of rosuvastatin intraperitoneally for 3 days. Cavernosal tissue RhoA and Rho-kinases expression levels were evaluated by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, Western blot.", 
    "155": "The voltage-dependent erectile responses were suppressed by >30% in the obese-diabetic Zucker rat. The 3-day treatment with rosuvastatin partially restored the erectile response. The Rho-kinase inhibitor, H-1152, dose dependently increased the erectile responses and shifted the voltage sensitivity with statin treatment. Analysis of protein expression levels suggested elevation of RhoA and Rho kinases in obese-diabetics and statin treatment lowering Rho-kinase II. The RhoA and Rho-kinase II mRNA levels were significantly reduced in the rosuvastatin-treated obese-diabetic animals.", 
    "156": "These results support a hypothesis that short-term statin therapy may lower RhoA/Rho-kinase expression levels and improve cavernosal blood pressure response to Rho-kinase inhibition and voltage-stimulation, and reversing an augmented vasoconstricted state associated with diabetes and/or hypertension in MSX.",

Recently, multiple cholesterol-independent properties of statins have been discovered. The present review focuses on immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects of statins and their implications for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and psoriasis.", 
    "158": "Statins are potent inhibitors of HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase in the cholesterol-biosynthesis pathway. They are either lipophilic (e.g. simvastatin) or hydrophilic [e.g. pravastatin (PRV)] compounds, considered mainly for long-term treatment of hypercholesterolaemic individuals. Beneficial effects of statins are not related exclusively to their lipid-lowering action; they also possess cholesterol-independent, pleiotropic effects (e.g. anti-inflammatory and antioxidant). Recent studies revealed that simvastatin treatment increased survival significantly in scrapie-infected mice. Although PRV treatment results in measurable drug levels in the mouse brain, the anti-prion effect of this compound has not been investigated. Therefore, we aimed to test the potential therapeutic action of PRV in a murine scrapie model. Our study showed that high-dose and long-term oral PRV treatment prolonged survival times of strain 139A scrapie-infected mice significantly (194 versus 177 days) in the absence of any obvious toxicity, suggesting that protective effects of statins may be independent of absolute solvent or water solubility of the drug.",

    "163": "Although fracture healing is frequently studied in pre-clinical models of long bone fractures using rodents, there is a dearth of objective quantitative techniques to assess successful healing. Biomechanical testing is possibly the most quantitative and relevant to a successful clinical outcome, but it is a destructive technique providing little insight into the cellular mechanisms associated with healing. The advent of X-ray computed tomography (CT) has provided the opportunity to quantitatively and non-destructively assess bone structure and density, but it is unknown how measurements derived using this technology relate to successful healing. To examine possible relationships, we used a pre-clinical model to test for statistically significant correlations between quantitative characteristics of the callus by micro-CT (microCT) and the bending strength, stiffness, and energy-to-failure of the callus as assessed by three-point bending of excised bones. A closed, transverse fracture was generated in the mid-shaft of rat femurs by impact loading. Shortly thereafter, the rats received a one-time, local injection of either the vehicle or one of four doses of lovastatin. Following sacrifice after 4 weeks of healing, fractured femurs were extracted for microCT analysis and then three-point bending. Setting the region of interest to be 3.2 mm above and below the fracture line, we acquired standard and new microCT-derived measurements. The mineralized callus volume and the mineral density of the callus correlated positively with callus strength (rxy = -0.315, p = 0.016 and rxy = 0.444, p<0.0005, respectively) and stiffness (rxy = -0.271, p = 0.040 and rxy = 0.325, p = 0.013, respectively), but the fraction of the callus that mineralized and the moment of inertia of the callus did not. This fraction did correlate with energy-to-failure (rxy = -0.343, p = 0.0085). Of the microCT-derived measurements, quantifying defects within the outer bridging cortices of the callus produced the strongest correlation with both callus strength (rxy = 0.557, p<0.0001) and stiffness (rxy = 0.468, p = 0.0002). By both reducing structural defects and increasing mineralization, lovastatin appears to increase the callus strength.", 
    "164": "Although atherosclerosis is associated with the elderly, young adults with hypercholesterolemia and other cardiovascular risk factors may have subclinical atherosclerotic disease. In many cases, when two or more risk factors are present, conventional risk assessment using the Framingham score, that was not designed to detect atherosclerotic plaques, may significantly underestimate the extent of atherosclerosis. Several non-invasive imaging technologies now make it possible to identify subclinical atherosclerosis before symptoms appear or major vascular events occur. These include B-mode ultrasound to measure carotid intima-media thickness, computed tomography to measure coronary artery calcification, and high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate plaque size and composition. On the basis of available evidence, assessment of subclinical atherosclerosis should be considered in persons judged to be at intermediate risk by Framingham score, because test results may influence risk stratification and, consequently, the intensity of therapeutic intervention. Patients with significant subclinical atherosclerosis are at high risk and, like other high-risk individuals, should receive treatment designed to achieve aggressive low-density lipoprotein cholesterol targets. Clinical studies show that statin therapy may delay atherosclerosis progression and that intensive therapy with rosuvastatin may actually reverse the atherosclerotic process.",

Patients were divided by those receiving statin therapy and those not receiving statins while hospitalized. Medication data were collected from an inpatient pharmacy database. Comparisons were conducted with Fisher's exact test or Wilcoxon rank sum test.

    "178": "Drug-drug interaction studies are important building blocks in drug development to understand the perceived risk of a purported interaction due to the differing clinical pharmacology attributes of the co-administered drugs. Two case studies are presented that justify the importance of evaluating the metabolite kinetics data along with the parent in a preclinical model. Atorvastatin and verapamil have interesting clinical pharmacology attributes in that both agents are substrates and/or inhibitors of the dual cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and P-glycoprotein (Pgp) efflux transporter interplay. As articulated by the two case studies, the presence of metabolite kinetic data (i.e., norverapamil) provided unequivocal evidence in order to tease out the actual pathway responsible for the interaction between atorvastatin and verapamil. Therefore, consideration for metabolite kinetics, wherever feasible, appears to be prudent in defining the interaction liability between the two agents in a preclinical model.", 
    "179": "Decreasing very high triglyceride (TG) levels (>or=500 mg/dL) is recommended to prevent pancreatitis. Decreasing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is the primary lipid treatment target to reduce the risk of atherosclerotic coronary heart disease. A secondary lipid treatment target for patients at LDL-C goal, but with persistent TG elevations, includes achievement of non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol goals (non-HDL-C). Statins are the mainstay of therapy to lower LDL-C, but statin monotherapy may not achieve all lipid treatment goals. Thus, in patients with multiple lipid abnormalities, combination lipid-altering therapy is often necessary. Drugs such as niacin and fibrates provide lipid benefits beyond LDL-C when used in combination with a statin. Prescription omega-3-fatty acids combined with statin therapy also provide improvements in lipid parameters beyond cholesterol alone.",

    "184": "The metabolic syndrome is a cluster of cardiometabolic risk factors associated with higher risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular (CV) disease and diabetes. Its prevalence is about 20% to 30% among adults worldwide and is increasing. The primary goal is reduction of CV risk through lifestyle changes and drug therapy if required. Post hoc analyses of prospective trials showed the benefit of lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in patients with the metabolic syndrome. Statin therapy exerts beneficial effects not only by lowering LDL cholesterol but also via its so-called pleiotropic effects. These effects seem particularly important for reducing risk of CV disease in patients with the metabolic syndrome. Thus, evidence is accumulating that statins are very effective therapeutic agents in the treatment of individuals with the metabolic syndrome.",

The API-4000 LC-MS/MS was operated under the multiple reaction-monitoring mode (MRM) using electrospray ionization. The assay procedure involved precipitation of SA, AD, VS and IS from plasma with acetonitrile. The total run time was 2.8 min and the elution of SA, AD, VS and IS occurred at 1.81, 1.12, 1.14 and 1.81 min, respectively; this was achieved with a mobile phase consisting of 0.02 M ammonium formate (pH 4.5):acetonitrile (20:80, v/v) at a flow rate of 0.50 mL/min on an X-Terra C18 column. A linear response function was established for the range of concentrations 0.5-50 ng/mL (r > 0.994) for VS and 0.2-50 ng/mL (r > 0.996) for SA and AD. The method validation parameters for all three analytes met the acceptance as per FDA guidelines. This novel method has been applied to human pharmacokinetic study.", 
    "186": "An increase in compactin (ML-236B) production was achieved by introducing a whole compactin biosynthetic gene cluster or the regulatory gene mlcR into compactin high-producing Penicillium citrinum. In the previous report, we introduced mlcR encoding the positive regulator of compactin biosynthetic genes into compactin high-producing strain no. 41520, and most of the transformants produced higher amounts of compactin. Here, we characterize one of the resulting high producers (strain TIR-35, which produced 50% more compactin) and reveal that TIR-35 contained five copies of mlcR and that early, enhanced expression of mlcR caused compactin overproduction. Similarly, the introduction of mlcR into strain T48.19, which was created previously from strain no. 41520 by introducing a partial compactin biosynthetic gene cluster, enhanced compactin production further. Our results indicated that genetic engineering is an effective tool to improve compactin production, even in compactin high producers.",

We showed that cotreatment of the murine melanoma B16F10 cell with statins (atorvastatin and pravastatin) and ajoene, all at nontoxic doses, dramatically increased their cytotoxicity. B16F10 cell death induced by statins, but not by ajoene, was prevented by mevalonate and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate. To our knowledge, this is the first report that the combination of statins and ajoene, which alters the mevalonate pathway, might potentiate their cytotoxic effects on tumor cells.",
