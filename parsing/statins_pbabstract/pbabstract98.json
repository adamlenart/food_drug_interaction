We hypothesize that simvastatin may increase the expression of P4H\u03b11 in atherosclerotic plaques and ox-LDL-stimulated human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs). In HASMCs, ox-LDL suppressed P4H\u03b11 expression significantly with peak value occurring at 50 ug/ml treated for 8h. Ox-LDL also inhibited the expression of type I and III collagen and increased the phosphorylation level of p38 MAPK and ERK1/2, but blockade or silencing of p38 and ERK1/2 inhibited the suppressive effect of ox-LDL on P4H\u03b11. Then HASMCs were stimulated with or without ox-LDL (50 ug/ml) for 8h after simvastatin pretreatment for 1h. Simvastatin significantly attenuated the suppressive effect of ox-LDL on P4H\u03b11 and collagen production by inhibiting ox-LDL uptake and the activation of p38 MAPK and ERK1/2. In apolipoprotein E-deficient mice, simvastatin and the inhibitors of p38 and ERK1/2 significantly increased the stability of the carotid plaques. We also found that simvastatin significantly increased the expression of P4H\u03b11 and collagen possibly due to decreased ox-LDL content and phosphorylation of p38 and ERK1/2 in plaques. Thus, simvastatin increases P4H\u03b11 and collagen expression in ox-LDL-stimulated HASMCs and atherosclerotic plaques via p38 MAPK and ERK1/2, thereby exerting a plaque stabilizing effect.", 
    "1": "High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is a natural nanoparticle that transports peripheral cholesterol to the liver. Reconstituted high-density lipoprotein (rHDL) exhibits antiatherothrombotic properties and is being considered as a natural treatment for cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, HDL nanoparticle platforms have been created for targeted delivery of therapeutic and diagnostic agents. The current methods for HDL reconstitution involve lengthy procedures that are challenging to scale up. A central need in the synthesis of rHDL, and multifunctional nanomaterials in general, is to establish large-scale production of reproducible and homogeneous batches in a simple and efficient fashion. Here, we present a large-scale microfluidics-based manufacturing method for single-step synthesis of HDL-mimicking nanomaterials (\u03bcHDL). \u03bcHDL is shown to have the same properties (e.g., size, morphology, bioactivity) as conventionally reconstituted HDL and native HDL. In addition, we were able to incorporate simvastatin (a hydrophobic drug) into \u03bcHDL, as well as gold, iron oxide, quantum dot nanocrystals or fluorophores to enable its detection by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or fluorescence microscopy, respectively. Our approach may contribute to effective development and optimization of lipoprotein-based nanomaterials for medical imaging and drug delivery.", 
    "2": "The emphasis on periodontal regeneration has been shifted towards the harmonization of bioactive molecules and physiological phases during regeneration. This study investigated whether the combination and sequential-release of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF, mitogen) and simvastatin (differentiation factor) facilitated periodontal regeneration. PDGF and simvastatin were encapsulated in double-walled poly-( d,l-lactide) and poly-(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PDLLA-PLGA) microspheres using the co-axial electrohydrodynamic atomization technique. Critical-sized periodontal defects on rat maxillae were filled with microspheres encapsulating BSA-in-core-shell (BB), PDGF-in-shell (XP), simvastatin-in-core and BSA-in-shell (SB), simvastatin-in-core and PDGF-in-shell, or unfilled with microspheres (XX), and examined at 14 and 28 days post-operatively. The resultant microspheres were around 15 \u03bcm diameter with distinct core-shell structure, and the fast-release of PDGF followed by slow-release of simvastatin was noted in the SP group. The SP group demonstrated significantly greater bone volume fraction and decreased trabecular separation compared to the XX group at day 14, and milder inflammatory cells infiltration and elevated tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase level were noted at day 28. Fibers were also well-aligned and obliquely inserted onto the root surface similar to native periodontal ligament with signs of cementogenesis in the SP group. In conclusion, the combination and sequential-release of PDGF-simvastatin accelerates the regeneration of the periodontal apparatus.", 
    "3": "Clinical decisions are increasingly driven by evidence-based recommendations of guideline groups, which aim to be based on the highest quality knowledge-randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and meta-analyses. Although RCTs provide the best assessment of the overall value of a therapy, high-quality evidence from RCTs is often incomplete, contradictory, or absent even in areas that have been most exhaustively studied. Moreover, the likelihood of the success or failure of a therapy is not identical in all the individuals treated in any trial because therapy is not the only determinant of outcome. Therefore, the overall results of a trial cannot be assumed to apply to any particular individual, not even someone who corresponds to all the entry criteria for the trial. In addition, the potential for bias due to financial conflicts remains in many guideline groups. Guidelines are key sources of knowledge. Nevertheless, limitations in the extent, quality, generalizability, and transferability of evidence mean that we clinicians must still reason through the best choices for an individual because even in the absence of full and secure knowledge, clinical decisions must still be made. Clinical reasoning is the pragmatic, tried-and-true process of expert clinical problem solving that does value mechanistic reasoning and clinical experience as well as RCTs and observational studies. Clinicians must continue to value clinical reasoning if our aim is the best clinical care for all the individuals we treat.", 
    "4": "Pharmacologic interventions for thoracic aneurysms remain poorly characterized. The results of a pilot study by our group suggested improved outcomes among patients with thoracic aortic aneurysm who were taking statins. In the present study, we undertook a comprehensive analysis of a larger cohort of patients from the Database of the Aortic Institute at Yale-New Haven Hospital. A total of 1,560 patients met the inclusion criteria. The adverse events (i.e., death, dissection, or rupture) and surgery rates for patients with (n\u00a0= 369, 24%) and without (n\u00a0= 1,191, 76%) statin therapy were compared. We evaluated 3 anatomic components of the aorta: root, ascending and arch, and descending and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms. A smaller proportion of the statin group had adverse events: overall, 7% versus 15%; ascending and arch, 6% versus 15%; and descending and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, 8% versus 20%. Also, a smaller proportion of statin patients required surgery: overall, 48% versus 60%; ascending and arch, 51% versus 62%; and descending and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms, 36% versus 59% (p <0.001 to 0.01). The protective effect of statins was seen in all segments, except the aortic root. Log-rank evaluation of the interval to an adverse event or surgery was longer among statin-treated patients (p <0.001). Logistic regression analysis found statin use, angiotensin receptor blocker use, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were associated with decreased adverse events, and statin use, angiotensin receptor blocker use, \u03b2-blocker therapy, and age were associated with a decreased odds of requiring surgery. Multiple logistic regression analysis found only statins were associated with a decreased odds of an adverse event and that statins, coronary artery disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were associated with a decreased odds of undergoing surgery. In conclusion, these findings provide a medicinal option for the arsenal of treatment options for patients with aneurysms of the thoracic aorta.",

Separately, each of these therapies have progressed rapidly and have achieved a prime position in the current armamentarium. The simultaneous use of statins in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary revascularization procedures with stent implantation has shown a significant beneficial synergistic effect by reducing ischemia and necrosis, and improving coronary blood flow in patients with stable coronary disease, as well as in acute coronary syndromes. The use of high dose statins in conjunction with coronary angioplasty with stent implantation has shown great efficacy and safety in patients with severe coronary disease.",

Discontinuers were less satisfied with their physicians' explanation of cholesterol treatment, more likely to use the Internet to research statins, and less likely to undergo frequent cholesterol monitoring. Among adherent statin users, the primary reasons for switching were muscle side effects (33%) and cost (32%). Individuals at risk for non-adherence included those with low household income, those who experienced muscle pain as a side effect while on statin therapy, and those taking medication for cardiovascular disease.",

In addition, 64 unaffected siblings were enrolled as controls. The primary efficacy outcome is the change from baseline in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and the secondary outcome is the change in carotid intima-media thickness (c-IMT) in patients with FH compared with their siblings. The primary safety outcomes are growth and sexual maturation; secondary outcomes are the change in other lipoprotein levels and the incidence of adverse events, discontinuation rates, and abnormal laboratory values.",

Serum level of CETP was determined with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Lipid level in all patients was determined at baseline and after 12 months of treatment with 20 mg/d atorvastatin. Clinical follow-up was carried out for more than a year (12-23 months). Major adverse cardiac events including death, non-fatal infarction, revascularization and stroke (MACE) were recorded.

This review discusses the need for alternative adjunct treatment options and the potential place for omega-3 fatty acids as such. The cardiovascular benefits of fish consumption are attributed to the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and a variety of omega-3 fatty acid products are available with varied amounts of EPA and DHA. The product types include prescription drugs, food supplements, and medical foods sourced from fish, krill, algal and plant oils or purified from these oils. Two prescription omega-3 fatty acids are currently available, omega-3 fatty acid ethyl esters (contains both EPA and DHA ethyl esters), and icosapent ethyl (IPE; contains high-purity EPA ethyl ester). A pharmaceutical containing free fatty acid forms of omega-3 is currently in development. Omega-3 fatty acid formulations containing EPA and DHA have been shown to increase LDL-C levels while IPE has been shown to lower triglyceride levels without raising LDL-C levels, alone or in combination with statin therapy. In addition, recent studies have not been able to demonstrate reduced cardiovascular risk following treatment with fibrates, niacins, cholesterol absorption inhibitors, or omega-3 fatty acid formulations containing both EPA and DHA in statin-treated patients; thus, there remains a need for further cardiovascular outcomes studies for adjunct therapy.",

Randomized controlled trials showed neutral effects of statins and statin-ezetimibe combination on CVD outcomes in dialysis patients. Current guidelines in Japan recommend that low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) be <120 mg/dL, or non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) be <150 mg/dL as an alternative target in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), whereas Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcome (KDIGO) guidelines do not recommend any target lipid levels. In addition to \"treat to target\" and \"fire and forget\" guidelines, it is possible to recommend that lipid-lowering medication be initiated in certain subgroups of CKD patients. New directions of lipid research in CKD include cholesterol metabolism markers, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, and modifications of lipoproteins.",

    "59": "Intimal hyperplasia (IH) is the major cause of stenosis of vein grafts. Drugs such as statins prevent stenosis, but their systemic administration has limited effects. We developed a hyaluronic acid hydrogel matrix, which ensures a controlled release of atorvastatin (ATV) at the site of injury. The release kinetics demonstrated that 100% of ATV was released over 10 hours, independent of the loading concentration of the hydrogel. We investigated the effects of such a delivery on primary vascular smooth muscle cells isolated from human veins. ATV decreased the proliferation, migration, and passage of human smooth muscle cells (HSMCs) across a matrix barrier in a similar dose-dependent (5-10 \u00b5M) and time-dependent manner (24-72 hours), whether the drug was directly added to the culture medium or released from the hydrogel. Expression analysis of genes known to be involved in the development of IH demonstrated that the transcripts of both the gap junction protein connexin43 (Cx43) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) were decreased after a 24-48-hour exposure to the hydrogel loaded with ATV, whereas the transcripts of the heme oxygenase (HO-1) and the inhibitor of tissue plasminogen activator were increased. At the protein level, Cx43, PAI-1, and metalloproteinase-9 expression were decreased, whereas HO-1 was upregulated in the presence of ATV. The data demonstrate that ATV released from a hydrogel has effects on HSMCs similar to the drug being freely dissolved in the environment.", 
    "60": "The exact influence of statins on gefitinib resistance in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells with KRAS mutation alone or KRAS/PIK3CA and KRAS/PTEN comutations remains unclear. This work found that transfection of mutant KRAS plasmids significantly suppressed the gefitinib cytotoxicity in Calu3 cells (wild-type KRAS). Gefitinib disrupted the Kras/PI3K and Kras/Raf complexes in Calu3 cells, whereas not in Calu3 KRAS mutant cells. These trends were corresponding to the expression of pAKT and pERK in gefitinib treatment. Atorvastatin (1\u2009\u03bcM) plus gefitinib treatment inhibited proliferation, promoted cell apoptosis, and reduced the AKT activity in KRAS mutant NSCLC cells compared with gefitinib alone. Atorvastatin (5\u2009\u03bcM) further enhanced the gefitinib cytotoxicity through concomitant inhibition of AKT and ERK activity. Atorvastatin could interrupt Kras/PI3K and Kras/Raf complexes, leading to suppression of AKT and ERK activity. Similar results were also obtained in comutant KRAS/PTEN or KRAS/PIK3CA NSCLC cells. Furthermore, mevalonate administration reversed the effects of atorvastatin on the Kras/Raf and Kras/PI3K complexes, as well as AKT and ERK activity in both A549 and Calu1 cells. The in vivo results were similar to those obtained in vitro. Therefore, mutant KRAS-mediated gefitinib insensitivity is mainly derived from failure to disrupt the Kras/Raf and Kras/PI3K complexes in KRAS mutant NSCLC cells. Atorvastatin overcomes gefitinib resistance in KRAS mutant NSCLC cells irrespective of PIK3CA and PTEN statuses through inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase-dependent disruption of the Kras/Raf and Kras/PI3K complexes.",

Left-to-right ratios of the NIRF signal intensities in the CCA had a decreasing gradient from the highest value in the upper-most ligated area to the lowest value in the lower-most region adjacent to the aortic arch. Luciferase imaging showed that most Raw-luc macrophages were recruited to the ligated area of the CCA rather than to the aortic arch, despite similarly strong MMP-2/9-related NIRF signal intensities in both areas.

At the end of period II, ezetimibe plus atorvastatin 20\u00a0mg reduced LDL-C significantly more than atorvastatin 40\u00a0mg (17.4% vs 6.9%, p <0.001); switching from rosuvastatin 10\u00a0mg to ezetimibe plus atorvastatin 20\u00a0mg reduced LDL-C significantly more than uptitrating to rosuvastatin 20\u00a0mg (17.1% vs 7.5%, p\u00a0<0.001). Relative to comparative treatments, ezetimibe added to atorvastatin 10\u00a0mg (period\u00a0I) or atorvastatin 20\u00a0mg (period II) produced significantly greater percent attainment of LDL-C targets <100 or <70\u00a0mg/dl, and significantly greater percent reductions in total cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, most lipid and lipoprotein ratios, and apolipoprotein B (except ezetimibe plus atorvastatin 20 vs atorvastatin 40\u00a0mg). Reports of adverse experiences were generally similar among groups. In conclusion, treatment of hypercholesterolemic subjects at high cardiovascular risk with ezetimibe added to atorvastatin 10 or 20\u00a0mg produced significantly greater improvements in key lipid parameters and significantly greater attainment of LDL-C treatment targets than doubling atorvastatin or switching to (or doubling) rosuvastatin at the\u00a0compared doses.",

EAE was induced by MOG35-55 in female C57BL/6 mice. Therapies were initiated at day 12 post immunization when the mice developed a disability score and continued throughout the study until the day 33 when animals were sacrificed. Therapeutic treatment with half doses of atorvastatin and ATRA in combination has synergistic benefits causing the regression of clinical and neuropathological features of EAE more favorable than treatment with full doses of either drug alone. Without any advantage in anti-proliferative effect, combination treatment significantly reduced the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-17 and conversely, increased the production of anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 more prominent than either drug alone. Furthermore, FoxP3+Treg cells were significantly increased only in combination treatment.

While this response is known to prevent overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines, the mechanism through which endotoxin tolerance is established has not been identified. In the current study, we demonstrate that sufficient production of geranylgeraniol (GGOH) in macrophages is required to maintain endotoxin tolerance. We show that increased synthesis of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) protein following LPS treatment is required to produce enough GGOH to inhibit expression of Malt1, a protein known to stimulate expression of proinflammatory cytokines, in macrophages repeatedly exposed to LPSs. Depletion of GGOH caused by inhibition of HMGCR led to increased Malt1 expression in macrophages subjected to repeated exposure to LPSs. Consequently, endotoxin tolerance was impaired, and production of interleukin 1-\u03b2 and other proinflammatory cytokines was markedly elevated in these cells. These results suggest that insufficient production of GGOH in macrophages may cause autoinflammatory diseases.",

Modifiable risk factors associated with intensive therapy were elevated tryglicerides (1.63; 1.39-1.91), elevated LDL-C (1.96; 1.69-2.28), obesity (1.25; 1.07-1.47), smoking (1.32; 1.14-1.55), comedication with ezetimibe (3.76; 1.87-7.55), fibrates (1.96; 1.43-2.70) and calcium antagonists in women (1.42; 1.02-1.98).",

    "101": "Our objective was to study the possible influence of co-payment on sales volume and generic market share in two commonly used medicine groups: cholesterol-lowering medication [statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) and fibrates] and acid-blocking agents (proton pump inhibitors and histamine H2 receptor antagonists).", 
    "102": "The data were extracted from the Pharmanet database, which covers pharmaceutical consumption in all Belgian ambulatory pharmacies. First, the proportion of sales volume and costs of generic products were modelled over time for the two medicine groups. Second, we investigated the relation between co-payment and contribution by the national insurance agency using change-point linear mixed models.", 
    "103": "The change-point analysis suggested several influential events. First, the generic market share in total sales volume was negatively influenced by the abolishment of the distinction in the maximum co-payment level for name brands and generics in 2001. Second, relaxation of the reimbursement conditions for generic omeprazole stimulated generic sales volume in 2004. Finally, an increase in co-payment for generic omeprazole was associated with a significant decrease in omeprazole sales volume in 2005. The observational analysis demonstrated several changes over time. First, the co-payment amounts for name-brand and generic drugs converged in the observed time period for both medicine groups under study. Second, the proportion of co-payment for the total cost of simvastatin and omeprazole increased over time for small packages, and more so for generic than for name-brand products. For omeprazole, both the proportion and the amount of co-payment increased over time. Third, over time the prescription of small packages shifted to an emphasis on larger packages.", 
    "104": "As maximum co-payment levels decreased over time, they overruled the reference pricing system in Belgium. The changes in co-payment share over time also significantly affected sales volume, but whether physicians or patients are the decisive actors on the demand side of pharmaceutical consumption remains unclear.",

Patients with this form of myositis have unique clinical, pathologic and pathophysiologic features when compared with those with self-limited statin toxic myopathy. An autoantibody directed against HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), the pharmacologic target of statins, characterizes the disease and can be used in clinical practice to identify these patients and direct therapy. Still, many questions remain to be answered regarding the pathogenic mechanisms at play, risk factors for developing the disease, long-term prognosis and effects of rechallenge with statins or other cholesterol-lowering drugs.",

CHILD syndrome results from loss of function mutations in the NSDHL gene, which leads to inhibition of cholesterol synthesis and accumulation of toxic metabolic intermediates in affected tissues. The CHILD syndrome skin is characterized by plaques topped by waxy scales and a variety of developmental defects in extracutaneous tissues, particularly limb hypoplasia or aplasia. Strikingly, these alterations are commonly segregated to either the right or left side of the body midline with little to no manifestations on the ipsilateral side. By understanding the underlying disease mechanism of CHILD syndrome, a pathogenesis-based therapy has been developed that successfully reverses the CHILD syndrome skin phenotype and has potential applications to the treatment of other ichthyoses.

    "113": "Drug repurposing (drug repositioning, drug reprofiling, drug retasking) gains increasing importance as the development of new drugs becomes increasingly expensive. Though only a few compounds have been approved for new indications in the field of metabolic disorders, there are a number of substances which have the potential to become reprofiled in a new indication. Generally, reprofiled drugs for metabolic disorders can be classified in three groups. Group A contains those of which both, the original and repurposed indication, concern metabolic disorders. Group B comprises drugs, which were originally approved for non-metabolic disorders but show beneficial effects for metabolic disorders after repurposing. Group C comprises drugs, which were originally approved for metabolic disorders and are effective for non-metabolic disorders in their repurposed indication. Repurposed drugs in the field of metabolic disorders of group A include tetra-hydrobiopterin, originally indicated for phenylketonuria and now also approved for tetrahydrobiopterindeficiency, coenzyme-Q, originally approved for primary coenzyme-Q deficiency and reprofiled for statin-myopathy, and colesevelam, originally approved to reduce elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (LDL-C) and now being approved for type-2-diabetes. An example of group C is phenylbutyrate, which was originally approved for urea-cycle disorders and meanwhile gained approval for progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 2 due to mutations in the ABCB11 gene. Still additional compounds used to treat metabolic (non-metabolic) disorders show promising effects in non-metabolic (metabolic disorders) after repurposing in cell and tissue models. Future investigations will need to identify which candidate drugs may leave the pipeline status to acquire approval for new indications.", 
    "114": "Cholesterol gallstone disease is one of the most prevalent and the most costly digestive diseases in Western countries. Its pathogenesis is a complex paradigm resulting from the interaction of genetic factors, hepatic hypersecretion of cholesterol, increased intestinal absorption of cholesterol, a constantly \"supersaturated\" bile, crystallization of biliary cholesterol, and gallbladder stasis. De novo cholesterol biosynthesis, biliary cholesterol output, and intestinal cholesterol absorption are therefore key steps involved in cholesterol homeostasis. Establishing the right pharmacological therapy for cholesterol gallstones is of major importance in Western healthcare systems. Certain drugs might independently influence cholesterol gallstone formation by blocking the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase and inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis in the liver (statins) or blocking cholesterol absorption in the small intestine apical membrane by specifically inhibiting the Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 protein (ezetimibe). This review will focus on the possibility that statins and ezetimibe, by acting at different levels of cholesterol homeostasis, might represent novel therapeutic approaches to prevent cholesterol gallstones in selected subjects at risk.", 
    "115": "Simvastatin is considered as a stimulator for bone formation. However, the half-life for simvastatin is generally 2 hours, which means, it is difficult to maintain biologically active simvastatin in vivo. To overcome this limitation, we created a system to slowly release simvastatin in vitro and in vivo. We constructed a poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)/hydroxyapatite nano-fibrous scaffold to carry simvastatin. Releasing assays showed that simvastatin was released from poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)/hydroxyapatite/simvastatin quickly within - 15 days, and small amounts continued to be released through day 56 (experiments terminated). MTT assays demonstrated that both poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)/hydroxyapatite and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)/hydroxyapatite/simvastatin promoted MC3T3-E1 cell proliferation. However, Alkaline phosphatase assays showed that only poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)/hydroxyapatite/simvastatin scaffold significantly promoted the osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells in vitro on day 14. To further test in vivo, we created calvaria bone defect models and implanted either poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)/hydroxyapatite or poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)/hydroxyapatite/simvastatin. After 4 or 8 weeks post-implantation, the results indicated that poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)/hydroxyapatite/simvastatin scaffold induced bone formation more efficiently than poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)/hydroxyapatite alone. Our data demonstrates that poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)/hydroxyapatite/simvastatin has the potential to aid in healing bone defects and promoting bone regeneration in the future although we still need to optimize this complex to efficiently promote bone regeneration.",

Throughout the whole period of simvastatin treatment, plasma levels of 17-hydroxyprogesterone, testosterone, androstendione and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate in patients with NC-CAH remained lower compared with baseline, but increased in 2 patients after withdrawal of this drug. No changes in plasma steroids were observed in simvastatin-treated control subjects.

Recent reports have suggested that a synergistic effect can be obtained by concomitant administration of the cholesterol absorption inhibitor ezetimibe and a statin. However, in patients with type 2 diabetes who are already being treated with satins, it remains unclear whether it is more effective to add ezetimibe or to increase the statin dose. Therefore, this study was performed to examine the effects of these two regimens on LDL-C and lipoproteins.",

For all of these parameters, the percent changes were greater in the combination group. Only the combination group showed a significant decrease of triglycerides. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify factors associated with reaching an LDL-C level <80 mg/dL. As a result, add-on therapy with ezetimibe was extracted as a factor related to improvement of LDL-C.",

It still is the only practical means of obtaining spatial and temporal resolution within living cells and tissues. Most prominently, fluorescence microscopy based on dye-labeling or protein fusions with fluorescent tags is a highly sensitive and specific method of visualizing biomolecules within sub-cellular structures. It is however severely limited by labeling artifacts, photo-bleaching and cytotoxicity of the labels. Coherent Raman Scattering (CRS) has emerged in the last decade as a new multiphoton microscopy technique suited for imaging unlabeled living cells in real time with high three-dimensional spatial resolution and chemical specificity. This technique has proven to be particularly successful in imaging unstained lipids from artificial membrane model systems, to living cells and tissues to whole organisms. In this article, we will review the experimental implementations of CRS microscopy and their application to imaging lipids. We will cover the theoretical background of linear and non-linear vibrational micro-spectroscopy necessary for the understanding of CRS microscopy. The different experimental implementations of CRS will be compared in terms of sensitivity limits and excitation and detection methods. Finally, we will provide an overview of the applications of CRS microscopy to lipid biology.",

In the current study, we aimed to improve the predictive value of ApoE*3Leiden (E3L) transgenic mice regarding the cholesterol-lowering efficacy of various statins in humans by combining pharmacokinetic with efficacy data. The efficacy of five currently marketed statins (atorvastatin, simvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, and rosuvastatin) in hypercholesterolemic patients (low-density lipoprotein \u2265 160 mg/dl) was ranked based on meta-analysis of published human trials. Additionally, a preclinical combined PK efficacy data set for these five statins was established in E3L mice that were fed a high-cholesterol diet for 4 weeks, followed by 6 weeks of drug intervention in which statins were supplemented to the diet. Plasma and tissue levels of the statins were determined on administration of (radiolabeled) drugs (10 mg/kg p.o.). As expected, all statins reduced plasma cholesterol in the preclinical model, but a direct correlation between cholesterol lowering efficacy of the different statins in mice and in humans did not reach statistical significance (R(2) = 0.11, P < 0.57). It is noteworthy that, when murine data were corrected for effective liver uptake of the different statins, the correlation markedly increased (R(2) = 0.89, P < 0.05). Here we show for the first time that hepatic uptake of statins is related to their cholesterol-lowering efficacy and provide evidence that combined PK and efficacy studies can substantially improve the translational value of the E3L mouse model in the case of statin treatment.

Arg. produces the antioxidant monoterpene indole alkaloid (MIA) brachycerine, which, besides retaining a glucose residue, has its terpenoid moiety derived not from secologanin, but probably from epiloganin, representing a new subclass of MIAs. In this work we showed that osmotic stress agents, such as sodium chloride, sorbitol and polyethylene glycol (PEG), induced brachycerine accumulation in leaf disks of P. brachyceras. Other oxidative stress inducers, such as exposure to aluminum and silver, also increased brachycerine content. Abscisic acid (ABA) treatment was shown to increase brachycerine yield, suggesting its involvement in brachycerine induction during osmotic stress. Ascorbate peroxidase activity was induced in PEG-treated leaf disks, whereas superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity remained unaltered. Assays with specific inhibitors of the cytosolic mevalonate (MVA) and plastidic 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate (MEP) pathways showed that the terpenoid moiety of brachycerine derived predominantly from the MEP pathway.

Jejunal segments from Sprague-Dawley rats fasted overnight were mounted in Ussing chambers filled with 10 mL of Krebs-Ringer buffer (KRB). For P-gp inhibition studies, GG918 0.5 \u03bcM was added to the KRB solution. The experiment started by the addition of verapamil (1 or 10 \u03bcM) to either apical or basolateral sides. Samples from verapamil donor and receiver compartments were collected at 30 s and 0.166, 0.5, 1, 1.83 and 3 h after the start of the experiment. Analysis of verapamil and its major metabolite, norverapamil, in the samples and intracellularly at 3 h was performed by HPLC. The same experiment was repeated with norverapamil 10 \u03bcM (verapamil metabolite), digoxin 100 nM (positive control for P-gp activity) and atorvastatin 1 and 10 \u03bcM (example of a class 2 drug). For 1 \u03bcM verapamil, efflux ratio (B to A Papp/A to B Papp) was 4.6 and markedly decreased by GG918 (efflux ratio = 1.1). For 10 \u03bcM verapamil efflux ratio was 4.1 (control) vs 1.8 (GG918), comparable to the change seen for digoxin 100 nM with an efflux ratio of 3.6 (control) vs 1.6 (with GG918) and atorvastatin (efflux ratio of 5.2 and 3.0 for atorvastatin 1.0 and 10 \u03bcM, respectively, changed to 1.0 and 0.65 with GG918).

The extraction ratio (ER) of 10 \u03bcM verapamil to norverapamil decreased from 0.41 after an apical dose to 0.21 after a basolateral dose, but was unaffected by the incubation with GG918. The results suggest that P-gp inhibition has an effect on class 1 drug verapamil and class 2 drug atorvastatin Papp in the rat intestine. Moreover, a stronger P-gp effect on the Papp of the more polar norverapamil metabolite was observed.

The aim of our study was to examine whether statin pretreatment influences the release of Ang-2 from endothelial cells. Stimulation of HUVECs and HMVECs with PMA, thrombin or histamine resulted in significant release of Ang-2, as evidenced by ELISA. Pretreatment with simvastatin and mevastatin suppressed this release to basal level, while pravastatin had no effect. Simvastatin itself increased nitric oxide (NO, EC number 1.14.13.39) synthesis, measured by Griess reaction. Combining the statin pretreatment with the eNOS inhibitor L-NNA as well as bypassing the HMG-CoA reductase (EC number: 1.1.1.34) by adding mevalonic acid or geranyl pyrophosphate restored the exocytotic effect of PMA. Immunofluorescence microscopy showed that depletion of WPBs upon PMA stimulation ceased after pretreatment with simvastatin.

Recent evidence suggests that, in some patients, they may adversely influence cognitive function including causing memory impairments. These clinical observations have led to statin prescriptions now including a warning about possible cognitive impairments. In order to better understand the relationship between statin treatment and cognitive function, studies in animals are needed. The present study investigated the effects of chronic treatment with two statins, pravastatin and atorvastatin, in two rodent models of learning and memory. Adult rats were treated once daily with pravastatin (10 mg/kg, orally) or atorvostatin (10 mg/kg, orally) for 18 days. Before, during and after treatment, animals were tested in a simple discrimination and reversal learning task. On the last day of treatment and following one week withdrawal, animals were also tested in a task of novel object discrimination. Pravastatin tended to impair learning over the last few days of treatment and this effect was fully reversed once treatment ceased. In the novel object discrimination task, pravastatin significantly impaired object recognition memory. No effects were observed for atorvostatin in either task. These data suggest that chronic treatment with pravastatin impairs working and recognition memory in rodents. The reversibility of the effects on cessation of treatment is similar to what has been observed in patients, but the lack of effect of atorvostatin suggests that lipophilicity may not be a major factor influencing statin-induced cognitive impairments.", 
    "197": "Statins are known to modulate cell surface cholesterol (CSC) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in non-neural cells; however no study demonstrates whether CSC and AMPK may regulate simvastatin induced neuritogenesis (SIN). We found that simvastatin (SIM) maintains CSC as shown by Fillipin III staining, Flotillin-2 protein expression / localization and phosphorylation of various receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) in the plasma membrane. Modulation of CSC revealed that SIN is critically dependent on this CSC. Simultaneously, phospho array for mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) revealed PI3K / Akt as intracellular pathway which modulates lipid pathway by inhibiting AMPK activation. Though, SIM led to a transient increase in AMPK phosphorylation followed by a sudden decline; the effect was independent of PI3K. Strikingly, AMPK phosphorylation was regulated by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity which was enhanced upon SIM treatment as evidenced by increase in threonine phosphorylation. Moreover, it was observed that addition of AMP analogue and PP2A inhibitor inhibited SIN. Bio-composition of neurites shows that lipids form a major part of neurites and AMPK is known to regulate lipid metabolism majorly through acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC). AMPK activity is negative regulator of ACC activity and we found that phosphorylation of ACC started to decrease after 6 hrs which becomes more pronounced at 12 hrs. Addition of ACC inhibitor showed that SIN is dependent on ACC activity. Simultaneously, addition of Fatty acid synthase (FAS) inhibitor confirmed that endogenous lipid pathway is important for SIN. We further investigated SREBP-1 pathway activation which controls ACC and FAS at transcriptional level. However, SIM did not affect SREBP-1 processing and transcription of its target genes likes ACC1 and FAS. In conclusion, this study highlights a distinct role of CSC and ACC in SIN which might have implication in process of neuronal differentiation induced by other agents.",

Our previous studies suggested that reduction in the levels of tetraspanins CD9 and CD81 may be involved in the progression of inflammatory lung diseases, especially COPD. To search for agents that increase the levels of these tetraspanins, we screened 1,165 drugs in clinical use and found that statins upregulate CD9 and CD81 in RAW264.7 macrophages. The lipophilic statins, fluvastatin and simvastatin, reversed LPS-induced downregulation of CD9 and CD81, simultaneously preventing TNF-\u03b1 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 production and spreading of RAW264.7 cells. These statins exerted anti-inflammatory effects in vitro in wild-type macrophages but not in CD9 knockout macrophages, and decreased lung inflammation in vivo in wild-type mice but not in CD9 knockout mice, suggesting that their effects are dependent on CD9. Mechanistically, the statins promoted reverse transfer of the LPS-signaling mediator CD14 from lipid rafts into CD9-enriched microdomains, thereby preventing LPS receptor formation. Finally, upregulation of CD9/CD81 by statins was related to blockade of GTPase geranylgeranylation in the mevalonate pathway. Our data underscore the importance of the negative regulator CD9 in lung inflammation, and suggest that statins exert anti-inflammatory effects by upregulating tetraspanin CD9 in macrophages.", 
    "199": "Diseases of bone loss are a major public health problem. Here, we report the novel therapeutic action of simvastatin in osteoclastogenesis and osteoprotection, demonstrated by the ability of simvastatin to suppress osteoclast formation in vitro and in vivo. We found that in vitro, IRF4 expression is upregulated during osteoclast differentiation induced by RANKL (receptor activator of nuclear factor-\u03baB ligand), while simvastatin blocks RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis and decreases expression of NFATc1 (nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic, calcineurin-dependent 1), IRF4 and osteoclast markers. We also show that IRF4 acts in cooperation with NFATc2 and NF-\u03baB on the promoter region of NFATc1 to accelerate its initial transcription during the early stage of osteoclastogenesis. Moreover, our study using IRF4 siRNA knockdown directly demonstrates the requirement for IRF4 in NFATc1 mRNA transcription and its necessity in RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation. Our results suggest that the reduction in osteoclastogenesis is partly due to the inhibition of IRF4 production in RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation. To investigate the in vivo effects of simvastatin in RANKL-treated mice, we examined the bone mineral density (BMD) of a mouse model of bone loss, and found that simvastatin significantly reduced bone loss by suppressing osteoclast numbers in vivo, even in the presence of high concentrations of RANKL. These results suggest that the depletion of osteoclasts is not due to the reduction in RANKL produced by osteoblasts in vivo. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that simvastatin blocks RANKL-induced IRF4 expression in osteoclastogenesis. We propose that the expression of IRF4 by osteoclasts could be a promising new therapeutic target in bone-loss diseases.",

Interestingly, the total cell surface of MHC II remains unaltered. These defects can be corrected by restoring membrane cholesterol. In silico docking studies with a three-dimensional model showed the presence of a cholesterol binding site in the transmembrane domain of MHC II (TM-MHC-II). From the binding studies it was clear that cholesterol, indeed, interacts with the TM-MHC-II and alters its conformation. Mutation of cholesterol binding residues (F240, L243, and F246) in the TM-MHC-II decreased the affinity for cholesterol. Furthermore, transfection of CHO cells with full-length mutant MHC II, but not wild-type MHC II, failed to activate antigen-specific T cells coupled with decreased binding of conformation-specific antibodies.

    "213": "Cholesterol crystals are present in nascent and advanced atherosclerotic plaque. Under some conditions, they may enlarge and cause direct plaque trauma or trigger an inflammatory cascade that promotes the growth and instability of atherosclerotic plaque. Therapies that reduce the risk of cholesterol crystal formation or prevent the associated inflammatory response have the potential to improve the clinical outcome of patients with cardiovascular disease. Statins have pleiotropic effects that can reduce the size of the free cholesterol pool contained within atherosclerotic plaques and prevent the formation of cholesterol crystals. Colchicine prevents crystal-induced inflammation by virtue of its ability to inhibit macrophage and neutrophil function. Both statins and colchicine have been demonstrated to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with stable coronary disease. The efficacy of statins and colchicine for cardiovascular prevention supports the hypothesis that crystal-induced inflammation plays an integral role in the progression and instability of coronary disease. Inhibition of cholesterol crystal-induced inflammation offers a promising new target for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease.", 
    "214": "Testing for serum-based biomarkers are essential for diagnosis, risk stratification, and management of patients with cardiovascular disease. All biomarker assays have inherent analytical variability (coefficient of variance CVA), ranging from 5-20\u00a0%. There are also variances within a subject over time (CVI) and between subjects (CVG). Variances are determined by experimentation under controlled conditions on healthy subjects. Once measured, the index of individuality (II), reference change value (RCV), and number of samples to establish a homeostatic set point can be calculated. These attributes affect how results of biomarker tests are interpreted in routine clinical practice such as cardiac troponin for acute coronary syndromes, the natriuretic peptides, galectin-3 and sST2 for heart failure, lipids and lipoproteins for primary cardiovascular disease risk, and liver function tests and skeletal muscle biomarkers for detecting complications from statin use."
