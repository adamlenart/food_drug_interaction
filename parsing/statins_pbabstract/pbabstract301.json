Cardiovascular benefits of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) have been clearly established in the general population, but not in dialysis patients. This study examined statin prescription patterns and assessed the relationship between statin prescription and clinical outcomes in hemodialysis (HD) patients.", 
    "1": "Data were analyzed from the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study, a prospective observational study of HD patients randomly selected from representative dialysis facilities in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, Japan, and the United States. Predictors of statin prescription were investigated by means of logistic regression. Cox regression models tested the association between statin prescription and risk for mortality and cardiac events, with adjustments for common demographic factors and comorbid conditions.", 
    "2": "Statins were prescribed for 11.8% of HD patients overall. Most facilities (81.2%) prescribed statins to less than 20% of their patients. Patients prescribed statins had a 31% lower relative risk for death compared with those not prescribed statins (P < 0.0001). Statins were associated with a 23% lower cardiac mortality risk (P = 0.03) and a 44% lower noncardiac mortality risk (P < 0.0001). At a facility level, prescribing statins was associated with lower overall mortality rate, with a 5% lower risk for every 10% increase in number of patients prescribed statins within the facility (P = 0.02).",

    "4": "Pleiotropic, or non-lipid-dependent, effects mediated by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) have important clinical implications for the cardiovascular (CV) system. Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory process accompanied by increases in levels of plasma inflammatory markers and accumulation of immune cells within atherosclerotic plaques. Statins not only decrease serum lipid levels, but also inhibit signaling molecules at several points in inflammatory pathways. The anti-inflammatory effects and improved endothelial function associated with statin therapy are thought to be partly responsible for the reduction in CV morbidity and mortality. In analogy, patients with chronic kidney disease administered statins for CV risk reduction show evidence of improved renal function. However, whether statins confer similar protective benefits on the kidney has not been established. Several lines of evidence suggest that similar etiologic and pathological processes may be involved in CV and chronic kidney diseases. If inflammation and functional changes in the renovascular endothelium contribute to the progression of kidney disease, statins are likely to be effective in the treatment of renal disease. In this review, we critically consider emerging data indicating that statins may modulate renal function by altering the inflammatory response of the kidney and renal vasculature to dyslipidemia. Whether the amelioration of renal function by statins is separable from the lipid-lowering effects of these drugs still remains to be delineated. Other questions that remain to be addressed and issues that should be investigated also are presented.", 
    "5": "Hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme-A reductase inhibitors, or statins, have been shown to decrease mortality rates in patients who have coronary artery disease. It has been postulated that part of the mortality benefit conferred by statins is due to a decrease in ventricular arrhythmias. We assessed the effect of statin therapy on recurrent ventricular arrhythmias in 281 patients who developed coronary artery disease after implantable cardioverter-defibrillator placement. Statin therapy was associated with a significant decrease in the risk of ventricular arrhythmia that would require implantable cardioverter-defibrillator therapy.", 
    "6": "We evaluated the association of statin initiation within 48 hours of admission for an acute myocardial infarction with a 1-year prognosis on a nationwide scale. Patients who received a statin within 48 hours of admission but not before hospitalization had an improved prognosis (hazard ratio 0.57, 95% confidence interval 0.38 to 0.86, p <0.007) after adjustment for covariates and propensity score.", 
    "7": "Patients with combined hyperlipidemia (elevated triglyceride [TG] levels, elevated low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol, and multiple lipoprotein abnormalities) are at increased risk for coronary heart disease. We conducted a multicenter (in the United States), randomized, double-blind, active-controlled, 18-week study to determine if combination therapy with simvastatin plus fenofibrate is more effective in reducing elevated TG levels, thus improving the lipoprotein pattern in patients with combined hyperlipidemia compared with simvastatin monotherapy, and to evaluate safety and tolerability. Patients (aged 21 to 68 years) with a diagnosis of combined hyperlipidemia (fasting TG levels >/=150 and </=500 mg/dl, and LDL cholesterol >130 mg/dl) received simvastatin monotherapy (20 mg/day, n = 207) or simvastatin 20 mg plus fenofibrate (160 mg/day) combination therapy (n = 411) for 12 weeks following a 6-week diet and placebo run-in period. From baseline to week 12, median TG levels decreased 43.0% (combination therapy) and 20.1% (simvastatin monotherapy [treatment difference -23.6%, p <0.001]). Mean LDL cholesterol levels decreased 31.2% and 25.8% (treatment difference -5.4%, p <0.001), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels increased 18.6% and 9.7% (treatment difference 8.8%, p <0.001) in the combination therapy versus monotherapy groups, respectively. No drug-related serious adverse experiences were observed. No patient experienced clinical myopathy or severe abnormalities in liver function. Combination therapy with simvastatin 20 mg and fenofibrate 160 mg in patients with combined hyperlipidemia resulted in additional improvement in all lipoprotein parameters measured compared with simvastatin 20 mg monotherapy and was well tolerated. Thus, this combination therapy is a beneficial therapeutic option for managing combined hyperlipidemia.", 
    "8": "Mild renal impairment is an important risk factor for late cardiovascular complications. This substudy of the Lescol Intervention Prevention Study (LIPS) assessed the effect of fluvastatin on outcome of patients who had renal dysfunction and those who did not. Complete data for creatinine clearance calculation (Cockcroft-Gault formula) were available for 1,558 patients (92.9% of the LIPS population). Patients were randomized to fluvastatin or placebo after successful completion of a first percutaneous coronary intervention. Follow-up time was 3 to 4 years. The effect of baseline creatinine clearance on coronary atherosclerotic events (cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and coronary reinterventions not related to restenosis) was evaluated. Baseline creatinine clearance (logarithmic transformation) was inversely associated with an incidence of adverse events among patients who received placebo (hazard ratio 0.99, 95% confidence interval 0.982 to 0.998, p = 0.01). However, no association was noted between creatinine clearance and the incidence of adverse events among patients who received fluvastatin (hazard ratio 1.0, 95% confidence interval 0.99 to 1.0, p = 0.63). No further deterioration in creatinine clearance was observed during follow-up, regardless of baseline renal function or allocated treatment. Occurrence of adverse events was not related to changes in renal function during follow-up. Fluvastatin therapy markedly decreased the risk of coronary atherosclerotic events after percutaneous intervention in patients who had lower values of creatinine clearance at baseline. The benefit of fluvastatin was unrelated to any effect on renal function.", 
    "9": "The Hypertension High Risk Management trial (HYRIM) investigated the effect of fluvastatin treatment and lifestyle intervention on development of carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) in drug-treated hypertensive patients.", 
    "10": "HYRIM was a placebo-controlled, 2 x 2 factorial trial in which 568 drug-treated hypertensive men aged 40-74 years with total cholesterol 4.5-8.0 mmol/L, triglycerides <4.5 mmol/L, body mass index 25-35 kg/m2, and a sedentary lifestyle were randomized to receive either fluvastatin, 40 mg daily, or placebo, and either intensive lifestyle intervention (physical activity and diet) or usual care (treatment of hypertension and other disorders by own private physician). Carotid IMT was assessed by B-mode ultrasound vasculography and left ventricular (LV) mass was calculated from ultrasound recordings of the heart. Fluvastatin alone reduced the primary study endpoint of 4-year development of IMT in the common carotid artery (CCA) compared with placebo (p=0.0297). Carotid bulb IMT progression over 4 years was also significantly (p=0.0214) reduced by fluvastatin compared with placebo. Fluvastatin significantly lowered LDL-C levels (mean net difference through 4 years, 0.6 mmol/L; p<0.0001), and reduced the 2-year development of LV mass (p=0.0144) compared with placebo. Lifestyle intervention had no significant effect on LDL-C, carotid IMT or LV mass, and did not increase the effects of fluvastatin.", 
    "11": "In drug-treated hypertensive patients in a usual care setting, fluvastatin treatment reduces progression of carotid IMT and LV mass.", 
    "12": "Purpose of the study was to investigate whether short-term atorvastatin treatment improves endothelial function and affects inflammatory process in patients with heart failure (HF) and normal cholesterol levels. HF is characterized by endothelial dysfunction and increased inflammatory process, while statins restore endothelial function having also anti-inflammatory effects in hypercholesterolemic patients. We investigated the effect of 4-week atorvastatin treatment (10 mg/day) on endothelial function and inflammatory markers in patients with HF and cholesterol levels <220 mg/dl. Patients were randomly allocated into groups and received atorvastatin (n=19) or no statin (n=19). Forearm blood flow was measured using gauge-strain plethysmography. Serum levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule (sVCAM-1) were determined with ELISA. Data are expressed as median [25th-75th percentile]. Forearm vasodilatory response to reactive hyperemia was significantly improved in atorvastatin-treated patients (from 38.1% [32.0-59.1] to 70.0% [61.1-106.3], P<0.01), while it remained unaffected in the control group. Levels of IL-6, TNF-alpha and sVCAM-1 were decreased in atorvastatin-treated group (from 7.8 pg/ml [4.8-9.5], 3.2 pg/ml [2.7-4.8] and 595 ng/ml [440-810] to 5.6 pg/ml [2.5-9.0], 2.8 pg/ml [2.0-3.6] and 289 ng/ml [169-368], respectively, P<0.05 for all) but not in the control group. These findings indicate that atorvastatin may improve forearm vasodilatory response to reactive hyperemia and depress inflammatory process in patients with heart failure and normal baseline cholesterol levels.", 
    "13": "Statins can modestly raise the levels of HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I (APOA1). Recently, associations between polymorphisms in the estrogen receptor alpha (ESR1) and the HDL cholesterol response to hormone replacement therapy were reported. To test the hypothesis that common polymorphisms in ESR1 and APOA1 genes are associated with the response to statin therapy, two ESR1 (PvuII and XbaI) and two APOA1 (G-75A and +83) polymorphisms were examined in 338 hypercholesterolemic patients treated with atorvastatin 10mg. The ESR1 PvuII-XbaI+ haplotype was significantly, and independently, associated with a greater response of HDL raising in women (+13% versus +7%, p=0.010) but not in men (+9% versus +7%, p=0.248). Effects of the APOA1+83 variant allele on HDL cholesterol response also differed significantly by gender (p=0.012). The APOA1+83 variant allele was associated with higher basal LDL cholesterol levels in men as well, but not in women. Finally, significant interactions were observed between the ESR1 PvuII-XbaI+ haplotype and the APOA1+83 variant allele regarding both HDL (p=0.042) and LDL (p=0.031) cholesterol responses. In conclusion, the ESR1 haplotype was associated with a greater HDL-raising to atorvastatin in a gender-specific manner, and the interactions between ESR1 and APOA1 genotypes regarding HDL and LDL cholesterol response were also gender specific.", 
    "14": "Clinical studies showed that both hydrophilic and lipophilic statins reduce coronary events although in vitro studies demonstrated that lipophilic statins inhibited proliferation of arterial smooth muscle cells. Therefore, we examined whether lipophilic simvastatin reduces smooth muscle cells in atheromatous plaque and how simvastatin affects stability of atheroma in vivo. Coronary atherosclerosis-prone WHHLCA rabbits aged 10 months were given simvastatin (15 mg/kg) orally for 52 weeks and examined the serum lipid levels, plasma drug concentration, and aortic and coronary atherosclerosis. Compared to the placebo group, the plasma cholesterol levels decreased by about 20%. In the simvastatin group, the lipid component (macrophages+extracellular lipids) was decreased in the coronary and aortic atheroma, despite no decrease in the fibromuscular components. Consequently, the frequency of vulnerable plaque decreased. In the coronary plaque of the simvastatin group, PCNA-positive cells (which appeared to be macrophages) of the plaques decreased but the TUNEL-positive cells did not show significant change. Finally, fully differentiated smooth muscle cells increased in the aortic lesions of the simvastatin group. In conclusion, our results suggest that simvastatin did not depress the fibromuscular components in atheromatous plaques and the plaque-stabilizing effects were due to the reduction of macrophages/lipid deposits.", 
    "15": "ApoC-I plays an important role in controlling plasma lipid metabolism, however little is known about factors regulating the hepatic synthesis and secretion of this apolipoprotein. In the present study, we have carried out experiments with human hepatoma (HepG2) cells, in order to determine the effect of different tissue culture conditions on cellular lipid levels and on the production of apoC-I (and apoE) at the protein and mRNA level. Cells incubated for 48 h with 10% human serum had significantly higher cellular triglyceride (22%, P<0.05) and cholesterol levels (19%, P<0.01), higher medium apoC-I and apoE levels (2.6- and 2.9-fold, respectively), but similar levels of apoC-I and apoE mRNA, compared to cells incubated with 10% human lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS). Serum containing only HDL, or containing HDL with LDL, also increased cellular lipids and increased secreted apoC-I and apoE levels without altering apoC-I and apoE mRNA levels. Incubation of cells with Intralipid triglyceride (625 microM), increased cellular triglyceride (2.8-fold, P<0.001), decreased cellular cholesterol (32%, P<0.01), decreased cellular and medium apoC-I (24 and 26%, P<0.01) and had no effect on apoC-I mRNA levels. Additional experiments in which cells were loaded with cholesterol (incubation with 10 microg/ml cholesterol plus 1 microg/ml 25-hydroxycholesterol) or depleted of cholesterol (statin treatment) confirmed that secretion of apoC-I by HepG2 cells was dependent on cellular cholesterol levels and independent of changes in apoC-I mRNA levels. These results demonstrate that cellular cholesterol rather than triglyceride levels play a role in controlling apoC-I production by HepG2 cells and that this regulation occurs at a post-transcriptional level.",

    "17": "In recent years, the concept of \"global cardiovascular risk assessment\" has grown in interest for its role in primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Interventions for reducing the risk of relapse for persons with cardiovascular past history are well agreed-on. But for persons without such a history, the risk of a first attack varies greatly and this variability implies a range in the intensity of interventions. In several countries, guidelines for general practitioners have been diffused about pharmaceutical prescriptions in the different risk classes. In particular, in Italy, a governmental drug management commission has established that Statins, the most used cholesterol lowering medicines, can be refunded by the National Healthcare System only if they are prescribed to hyper-cholesterol patients with a global risk greater than 20%. The question is: how to calculate the risk? We performed a review of both the web and the literature and we found a lot of different \"risk calculators\". By means of a simulation study, we showed that these tools, when used for the same person, may lead to very different results. We estimated the economic impact of using one or another calculator.", 
    "18": "There are numerous studies examining the pharmacoeconomic impact of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) therapy on healthcare costs and outcomes. A recently published review demonstrated that the cost-benefit of these agents depends primarily on the risk of developing a coronary event. That is, as the risk of a coronary event increases, the cost-effectiveness ratio decreases. The typical cost per life-year saved (LYS) ranged from USD 1800 to USD 40,000 in patients with pre-existing coronary artery disease (CAD) and from USD 15,000 to > USD 1 million per LYS in patients without pre-existing CAD. The literature is sparse on the pharmacoeconomics of medication non-compliance in patients taking statin medications. Data from two studies suggest that >75% compliance results in decreased coronary events such as myocardial infarction. However, retrospective database analyses indicate that the average compliance rate hovers around the 65% mark. Many of the studies discuss medication non-compliance as a factor, but do not independently analyse compliance pharmacoeconomically. We examined the pharmacoeconomic impact of non-compliance using published studies that contained pharmacoeconomic data and/or compliance data. In general, we used the placebo arm of these published studies as the surrogate marker for complete non-compliance. The results suggest that for almost 100% compliance versus initial non-compliance, the cost effectiveness of statin medications ranges from USD 4500 to over USD 250,000 per LYS depending on patient age, presence or absence of risk factors and whether the statin is being used for primary or secondary prevention. Alternate-day or weekly dosing studies were also used to examine the impact of compliance on cost and health outcomes. Alternate-day dosing represented 50% compliance and weekly dosing 29% compliance. Less than full compliance had the expected effect of worse health outcomes and lower drug costs. However, the studies were small and not designed as true pharmacoeconomic studies looking at the relationship between medication compliance and cost. The results of this review suggest that there needs to be further examination of the relationship between compliance with statins and cost effectiveness, and studies need to include compliance in their data collection and analysis.",

Macrovascular complications (coronary, cerebrovascular and peripheral) are the main causes of diabetic morbidity and mortality. Dyslipidemia, a major cardiovascular risk factor, is common in patients with type 2 diabetes. Statins are a safe and efficacious therapy in this context. There are a number of good quality randomized controlled trials evaluating the benefit of statins in type 2 diabetic patients. We will present and discuss the most valid, important and applicable evidence available on primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease with statins in patients with type 2 diabetes. We will give practical evidence-based recommendations on selection of patients for prevention with statins.", 
    "20": "Elevated urinary albumin excretion (UAE) is associated with an increased carotid intima-media thickness (IMT). Because angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors as well as statins have been shown to lower UAE and the progression of IMT, we assessed the effects of fosinopril and pravastatin on carotid IMT in subjects with an increased UAE (15 to 300 mg/24 h).", 
    "21": "IMT was measured at the posterior wall of the left common carotid artery using radio-frequency signal analysis obtained by M-mode ultrasonography. 642 subjects were double-blind randomized to fosinopril 20 mg or matching placebo and to pravastatin 40 mg or matching placebo and were available for intention-to-treat analysis.",

The overall progression rate of IMT in 4 years was 0.037+/-0.006 mm. No significant difference in IMT progression was found between fosinopril, pravastatin, or matching placebo. IMT after 4 years was predicted by IMT at baseline, age, gender, pulse pressure, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Furthermore, a higher incidence of clinical events was observed in subjects with an IMT >1 mm after a mean follow-up of 46+/-7 months (hazard ratio, 3.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.59 to 6.16; P=0.001).",

    "28": "Although many different pathogenetic mechanisms have been proposed for osteonecrosis of the femoral head, the repair process leads to structural collapse when bone resorption exceeds production. The purpose of the current study was to determine the effects of two agents with known bone-altering qualities, alendronate and simvastatin, on the healing response of a cryosurgically induced necrotic lesion of the femoral head in canines. Eighteen beagles had cryosurgical necrosis of the right femoral head. After 2 weeks, in a blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized fashion, a 10-mg dose of oral alendronate (n = 6), a 40 mg dose of simvastatin (n = 6), or a placebo (n = 6) was administered daily for 12 weeks. At sacrifice, bone densitometry and histomorphometry quantified bone in the femoral head. In the alendronate-treated animals, a 16% increase in bone mineral density of the femoral head with induced osteonecrosis was found compared with the placebo group. Increases in bone volume and trabecular thickness also were detected in the alendronate and simvastatin groups, with alendronate having the greatest effect. Clinically, increasing the amount of bone in the femoral head may forestall mechanisms leading to joint collapse characteristic of advanced osteonecrosis of the femoral head.", 
    "29": "Hepatic hydroxymethyl glutary coenzyme A HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have various anti atherosclerosis pleiotropic effects that are independent of cholesterol reduction. Human serum paraoxonase 1 (PON1) is associated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and inhibits the oxidative modification of low-density lipoprotein (LDL). We investigated the effects of statins on PON1 gene transcription using a reporter gene assay. Promoter activity of the PON1 gene was estimated by measuring luciferase activity of plasmids with a PON1 promoter region transfected into human hepatoma HepG2 cells and human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. Pitavastatin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin each significantly increased PON1 promoter activity, and the transactivation by pitavastatin was abrogated by mevalonic acid and farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), however, not by geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. Further, PON1 promoter activity was enhanced by farnesyl transferase inhibitor (FTI), but not by geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor (GGTI). PON1 gene transcription has been reported to be dependent on Sp1 and the transactivation by pitavastatin was completely abrogated by mithramycin, an inhibitor of Sp1. Our results suggest that pitavastatin activates transcription of the PON1 gene through the FPP pathway, which may play an important role in the anti atherosclerotic effects of statins.", 
    "30": "Endothelial dysfunction syndrome initiates and usually accompanies the atherosclerotic process. Through their antioxidative, antiinflammatory, antiproliferative and antithrombotic role, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, statins, the third generation of calcium antagonists, aspirin and salicylate derivates slow down, stop and improve the endothelial dysfunction, being a real therapy of atherosclerosis.", 
    "31": "In the past decade, atherosclerosis has come to be recognized as active and inflammatory rather than simply a passive process of lipid infiltration or a reparative process after endothelial injury. In general, atherosclerosis can be considered as an intramural chronic inflammation resulting from interactions between modified lipoproteins, monocyte-derived macrophages, lymphocytes, and the normal cellular elements of the arterial wall. The process of inflammation occurs in response to functional and structural injury through a variety of known and unknown stimuli and is active over years and decades. Here, we review recent experimental and human studies of inflammatory mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.",

    "33": "Collagen-induced platelet CD40L and plasma levels of sCD40L and prothrombin fragment F1+2, a marker of thrombin generation, were investigated in 30 hypercholesterolemic patients and 20 healthy subjects. Hypercholesterolemic patients were then randomized to either diet (n=15; group A) or atorvastatin 10 mg/d (group B); the aforementioned variables were measured at baseline and after 3 days of treatment. Compared with referents, hypercholesterolemic patients showed higher values of platelet CD40L (P<0.005), sCD40L (P<0.005), and F1+2 (P<0.003). Platelet CD40L was significantly correlated with sCD40L (P<0.001), and the latter was significantly correlated with F1+2 (P<0.001). The intervention trial showed no changes in group A but a significant decrease in platelet CD40L (P<0.01), sCD40L (P<0.002), and F1+2 (P<0.03) in group B.

The docking results will be valuable for the structure-based design of novel hypolipidemic agents.", 
    "37": "Inflammatory mechanisms play a prominent role in mediating all stages of atherosclerosis, and measurement of inflammatory biomarkers provides a method for detecting individuals at future vascular risk. Evidence from observational studies indicates that the hepatic acute-phase reactant, C-reactive protein (CRP), is the strongest predictor of future myocardial infarction and stroke. The addition of CRP to standard lipid screening may improve global risk prediction among those with high as well as low cholesterol. Statins have been shown to have beneficial effects on plaque inflammation, stability and CRP levels, in addition to their lipid-lowering effects. Data from two large statin trials suggest that testing for CRP may identify many individuals without hyperlipidaemia who are at high risk for future cardiovascular events and who may benefit from statin therapy. If confirmed in ongoing large-scale prospective trials, screening for inflammation using CRP as a biomarker could prove an important adjunctive method for identifying individuals at increased risk who would benefit most from targeted preventive interventions.",

    "39": "Recent Canadian lipid guidelines recommend that all high-risk patients receive medication to reduce low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) below 2.5 mmol/L. The recently published Reversal of Atherosclerosis with Aggressive Lipid Lowering (REVERSAL) and Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy (PROVE IT) studies compared strategies of cholesterol lowering with atorvastatin 80 mg versus pravastatin 40 mg. Atorvastatin halted the progression of atherosclerosis (whereas atherosclerosis progressed in the patients receiving pravastatin), and resulted in a 16% reduction in the primary composite end point (all-cause death, myocardial infarction, unstable angina, revascularization and stroke) compared with the pravastatin-treated group. In the PROVE IT trial, LDL-C was reduced by atorvastatin to 1.6 mmol/L and by pravastatin to 2.46 mmol/L. Although lower LDL-C levels are one explanation for the improved outcomes with atorvastatin, pleiotropic differences of the two statins, such as their effects on inflammation and coagulation, cannot be excluded. Until trials are completed that compare outcomes from LDL-C lowering to different targets with the same statin, it is premature to recommend changes to the current Canadian guidelines. However, future recommendations may suggest much lower LDL-C targets than those currently recommended.", 
    "40": "Secondary thrombosis may contribute to cerebral ischemia caused by traumatic brain injury (TBI). In this study, we sought to investigate the temporal and spatial profiles of intravascular thrombosis and to evaluate the effect of atorvastatin, a beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, on thrombosis after TBI. Young male Wistar rats weighing 350-400 g were subjected to controlled cortical impact injury, and were sacrificed at 1 and 4 h, and 1, 3, 8, and 15 days after TBI (5 rats/time point), respectively. For the evaluation of the effects of atorvastatin on intravascular thrombosis, rats were subjected to TBI, and subsequently atorvastatin (1 mg/kg) was orally administered starting 1 day after TBI and then daily until sacrifice at 3, 8, and 15 days after TBI (5 rats/time point). Before sacrifice of animals, blood was withdrawn and employed for the measurement of von Willibrand factor and platelet activity using enzyme-linked immunoabsorbant assay (ELISA). Brain tissues were prepared for histological analysis. The data show that (1) delayed thrombosis is present in the lesion boundary zone and in the hippocampal CA3 region, starting at 1-4 h, peaking at 1-3 days, and then declining at 8 and 15 days after TBI; (2) intravascular thrombosis also occurs in the other areas of cortex, striatum, and corpus callosum, but with a scattered distribution; (3) delayed thrombi are composed of platelets, fibrin, and vWF; and (4) reduction of the plasma vWF level and platelet activity by atorvastatin decreases delayed thrombosis after TBI. These data suggest that atorvastatin reduces intravascular thrombosis attributed to hemostatic disturbances caused by TBI.",

In use for over a decade, they have demonstrated both safety and tolerability across a broad range of patients. The ability to inhibit the biosynthesis of cholesterol and reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels is known to play a major part in reducing cardiovascular risk. Multiple clinical trials have cemented their role in both primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic disease. Clinical evidence also supports the principle that reductions in cardiovascular risk are interdependent on mechanisms beyond cholesterol reduction alone. These pleiotropic effects of statins have underscored a widening focus and understanding into the mechanisms of vascular dysfunction, inflammation, and injury. They have also brought a new perspective to a broad spectrum of clinical uses that has implications for specialties as varied as infectious disease, rheumatology, and oncology.", 
    "42": "Although statin therapy is a mainstay of lipid treatment, complementary effects of other cholesterol-lowering therapies modify the lipid panel and other aspects of coronary disease risk. These other therapies lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides and/or raise high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, improve diabetic control, and modify other cardiovascular risks. Historically, combination therapy has been reserved for the small minority of patients with severe dyslipidemia, due to perceived risk. More recently, however, it has been recognized that the potential complications of this combination are far outweighed by the clinical benefits that are possible.", 
    "43": "High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), a nonspecific marker of inflammation, is a newly available biomarker for predicting the risk of cardiovascular events. CRP has been shown to predict risk of cardiovascular events independent of traditional risk factors and in the setting of low levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Statins have been shown to decrease CRP, and studies are now under way to evaluate if targeting patients with high CRP and low low-density lipoprotein cholesterol will have any impact on future cardiovascular events and survival and whether changes in CRP correlate to event reduction. The utility of CRP as a target of therapy remains to be proved, and these ongoing studies will likely provide us with guidance.", 
    "44": "The metabolic syndrome is a condition associated with obesity, insulin resistance, hypertension, dyslipidemia, hypercoagulability, and chronic inflammation, all of which increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). The Third National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel extensively discussed the metabolic syndrome because it is a major health issue in the United States due to the national epidemic of obesity. Statins cause significant CVD risk reduction in patients with the metabolic syndrome by alterations in lipid levels and possibly by decreasing inflammation. Because of the increased CVD risk associated with the metabolic syndrome and extensive clinical trial evidence documenting reduction of CVD risk with statin treatment, all patients with the metabolic syndrome should be evaluated as candidates for statin treatment as part of a multidisciplinary approach to reduce CVD risk.", 
    "45": "In December 2002, the National Cholesterol Education Program published its third expert panel report on the detection, evaluation, and treatment of high blood cholesterol in adults (Adult Treatment Panel III). Since then, many new studies suggest that a more aggressive approach should be taken in cholesterol therapy. Based on these new clinical trials, the National Cholesterol Education Program published recommended modifications to the Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines in July 2004. There is good evidence to support the proposed modifications to Adult Treatment Panel III, but there is still much uncertainty in many patient subsets. More evidence is necessary to clarify if current treatment guidelines and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals are optimal for all patients within each risk category. These guidelines, and the proposed modifications, should be used as a tool to guide therapy that should be tailored to fit the overall risk assessment and needs of the individual patient.",

Markers of platelet activation, P-selectin and activated GPIIb/IIIa on platelets, were measured at baseline and 2 weeks after cilostazol treatment. We empirically divided patients into tertiles (low, n =16; moderate, n = 14; high group, n = 17), according to the baseline P-selectin expression. We then performed a comparative assessment of the anti-platelet effects of cilostazol at baseline and after 2 weeks of cilosatzol administration.",

Activated GPIIb/IIIa was not significantly changed (13.5% to 17.6%, p > 0.05). Underying disease, cardiovascular risk factors, concomitant medication including statin, and hsCRP were not related to the degree of P-selectin expression.",

This study examined the in vivo effect of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor simvastatin, which controls the first step in the biosynthesis of cholesterol, on bone formation in rats. Histologic specimens were collected 7, 14, and 21 days after administration of 1 mg of simvastatin for 5 days and compared with control specimens for changes in bone tissue. The observed effects on the bone in a healthy animal model included advancement of the blood supply, acceleration of the proliferation and differentiation of osteoprogenitor cells, and formation of osteoid tissue.", 
    "51": "Evidences from cell culture experiments and animal studies suggest a strong link between cholesterol and Alzheimer's disease (AD). This relationship is supported by retrospective epidemiological studies demonstrating that statin treatment reduced the prevalence of AD in patients suffering from hypercholesterolaemia. The alternative processing of the amyloid-precursor protein (APP) in the brain of AD patients leads to the production of the neurotoxic amyloid-beta protein (Abeta), a causative factor for AD pathology. In vitro, this mechanism is modulated by alterations in cellular cholesterol levels. Moreover, lowering cholesterol in animal experiments reduced the production of Abeta in most but not all studies. These findings led to prospective clinical trials of cholesterol-lowering statins in AD patients, even if many studies do not support elevated cholesterol levels in serum and brain as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Most of these studies were negative. Thus, up to date there is insufficient evidence to suggest the use of statins for treatment in patients with AD.", 
    "52": "We have recently found that the frequency of OATP-C*15 is significantly higher in patients who experienced myopathy after receiving pravastatin or atorvastatin than in patients without myopathy. However, there were two patients who experienced pravastatin-induced myopathy despite the fact that they did not possess OATP-C*15 or other known mutations of OATP-C that have been reported to decrease the function of OATP-C. In this study, we sequenced all of the exons and exon-intron junctions of OATP-C of the two patients and found a novel mutation in exon 12 of OATP-C in one of the patients. In this mutation (1628T>G), there is a substitution of Leu to Trp at position 543 in transmembrane-spanning domain 10 of OATP-C. However, the frequency of this mutation in the Japanese population appears to be very low (<1%).", 
    "53": "Brain abnormalities, preceded by a systemic inflammation, develop in spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats (SHRSP). In this model, we investigated whether the hydrophilic statin, rosuvastatin, influences the development of inflammation associated with brain abnormalities. Because differences in hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity contribute to the differences in statin pharmacology, we also evaluated the effects of simvastatin, a lipophilic molecule", 
    "54": "SHRSP, fed a high-salt diet, were treated long-term with vehicle or rosuvastatin (1 and 10 mg/kg per day). Brain abnormalities developed after 40+/-5 days and after 60+/-5 days of salt loading, in vehicle-treated and in rosuvastatin-treated (1 mg/kg per day) SHRSP, respectively. After 100 days of treatment, no damage was detectable in 30% of the rats treated with the highest dose of the drug. In comparison with vehicle-treated SHRSP, rosuvastatin treatment attenuated the transcription of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, transforming growth factor-beta1, IL-1beta, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha in the kidney, and of P-selectin in brain vessels and increased the transcription of endothelial nitric oxide synthase mRNA in the aorta. Urinary excretion of acute-phase proteins increased with time in vehicle-treated animals but remained negligible in drug-treated animals. These effects are independent of changes in physiological parameters. Treatment of SHRSP with simvastatin (2 to 20 mg/kg per day) did not exert any protective effect.",

    "56": "Theoretical calculation and analysis of (13)C-{(1)H} dipolar spectra of small-size spin clusters is presented. Dipolar spectra simulated using the time-independent average Hamiltonian are compared with the dipolar profiles obtained by 2D and 3D (1)H-(13)C correlation experiments employing Lee-Goldburg off-resonance cross-polarization (LG-CP). It is demonstrated that the structural parameters such as interatomic distances as well as mutual orientation of internuclear vectors can be derived from the dipolar profiles of simple spin clusters. Simplified analysis of the dipolar spectra based on isolated-like spin-pair approach can be used only if interacting spin cluster is reduced to the three-spin system in which the angle between both internuclear vectors ranges from 45 degrees to 135 degrees . For other local arrangements of spin systems the produced dipolar spectra must be analyzed with high caution. Contributions of all interacting spins to dipolar evolution of (13)C magnetization are mutually mixed and cannot be easily separated. However, simplification of the dipolar spectra is achieved by selective excitation. Enhanced selectivity of LG-CP transfer due to the initial (1)H chemical-shift-evolution period makes it possible to construct the dipolar spectra from (1)H-(13)C cross-peak intensities for every detected (1)H-(13)C spin-pair. Consequently, isolated-like spin pair evolution of the detected (1)H-(13)C coherence dominates to the resulting dipolar profile, while the influence of other interacting spins is suppressed. However, this suppression is not quite complete and analysis of the selective dipolar spectra based on isolated-like spin-pair approach cannot be used generally. Especially evolution of long-range (1)H-(13)C coherence is still significantly affected by spin states of other coupled hydrogen atoms.",

Recorded perioperative complication outcomes included death, myocardial infarction, ischemia, congestive heart failure, and ventricular tachyarrhythmias occurring during the index hospitalization. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions identified predictors of perioperative cardiac complications and medications that might confer a protective effect.",

The difference was mostly accounted by myocardial ischemia and congestive heart failure. After adjusting for other significant predictors of perioperative complications (age, gender, type of surgery, emergent surgery, left ventricular dysfunction, and diabetes mellitus), statins still conferred a highly significant protective effect (odds ratio 0.52, p = 0.001). The protective effect was similar across diverse patient subgroups and persisted after accounting for the likelihood of patients to have hypercholesterolemia by considering their propensity to use statins.",

Apart from strategies aimed at maintaining very tight glycemic control, attention has turned to the development of adjuvant therapy to maintain endothelial function in these patients. The agents receiving the most critical appraisal due to their endothelial protective effects are the 3-hydrox 3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-Co-enzyme A (CoA) reductase inhibitors. The aim of the study was to investigate: (1) the early alterations in the renal diabetic injury; and (2) to examine the protective role of Pravastatin in this end-organ diabetic model.",

    "64": "We demonstrated impairment in functional, biochemical, and structural parameters in the diabetic nephropathy group, which was diminished by treatment with Pravastatin. This was attributed to an up-regulation in endothelial constitutive nitric oxide synthase (ecNOS) expression in the treated diabetic group.",

    "66": "Clopidogrel is an inactive prodrug, which requires activation by the cytochrome P450 3A4 system in order to exert its antiplatelet action. Some statins (atorvastatin, lovastatin and simvastatin) also requires metabolism by the cytochrome P450 3A4 system. From a theoretical point of view, a clinical relevant interaction may exist between clopidogrel and cytochrome P450 3A4 metabolized statins. Nine studies have investigated the existence of this potential interaction. Seven studies have used results based on platelet function as surrogate endpoints and two studies have dealt with objective clinical events including mortality, acute myocardial infarction and stroke. However the studies have yielded conflicting results. This controversy is primarily caused by substantial differences in study design and methods used for assessment of the antiaggregatory effect of clopidogrel. Most studies have included too few patients, and there appears to be no consensus regarding the definition of and optimal way of measuring the platelet inhibitory effect of clopidogrel. Therefore an adequately powered prospective study, ensuring elimination of identified possible confounders and with the use of a well-defined surrogate ex vivo parameter should be performed.", 
    "67": "HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methyglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase inhibitors (statins) reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Although statins work in part via lipid modulation, several findings of statins indicate they have broader properties, including alteration of inflammatory pathways. Ex-vivo activities of statins include suppression of adhesion molecule expression, MHC class II expression, and effects on reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediate production. Statins also modify apoptosis in smooth muscle and endothelial cells leading to altered vascular function and neovascularization. These properties offer the potential to modify the states of chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis with drugs that show minimal toxic effects in both the short and long term.", 
    "68": "Antibody titers to heat shock protein (Hsp)-60 and -65 are positively related to risk of vascular disease and cardiovascular endpoints. There are few data on the factors that regulate the levels of these antibodies. It is known that the statins have antiinflammatory and immunoregulatory properties. The authors examined the effects of 2 statins, simvastatin (Zocor) and atorvastatin (Lipitor) on antibody titers to Hsp-60, -65, and -70 in a group of dyslipidemic patients. Twenty patients attending a lipid clinic, and previously not receiving lipid-lowering treatment, were treated with 10 mg of simvastatin (n = 11) or atorvastatin (n = 9) for 4 months. An additional 14 patients were recruited from the same clinic at the same hospital as a control group. The medication of these latter patients was unaltered for 4 months and the same parameters were measured as for the statin group. Antibody titers to Hsp-60, -65, and -70 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and lipoprotein profile and highly sensitive serum C-reactive protein (CRP) were measured by routine methods before and after treatment. Pretreatment and posttreatment data were compared by paired t or Mann-Whitney tests. Overall statin treatment was associated with a significant reduction in median antibody titers to Hsp-60 (17.2%, p = 0.03), Hsp-65 (15.9%, p = 0.003) and Hsp-70 (8.3%, p = 0.006), but not in control patients. Both statins caused a reduction in median serum CRP concentrations (45% overall, p < 0.05), but significant changes were not observed in the control patients. The effects on Hsp antibody titers were not related to changes in serum CRP concentrations (p > 0.05). However, there was a significant correlation between changes in antibody titers to Hsp-60 vs Hsp-65 (p < 0.01), Hsp-60 vs Hsp-70 (p < 0.05), and Hsp-65 vs Hsp-70 (p < 0.001). Statin treatment was associated with a reduction in antibody titers to Hsp-60, -65, and -70. This reduction is not fully explained by the antiinflammatory effects of the statins but may be due to their other immunomodulatory properties.", 
    "69": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is a prevalent, chronic, and progressive atherosclerotic disease process involving the conduit vessels of the extremities. Most patients who present with objective signs of PAD are asymptomatic. These patients are at an increased risk of dying from cardiovascular events. Lipid management is the mainstay of risk-factor modification for patients with cardiovascular disease. Some evidence suggests that hypocholesterolemic drugs may halt the progression of atherosclerotic peripheral vascular disease. More recently, treatment with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) inhibitors have demonstrated improved function in patients with symptomatic peripheral vascular disease. This paper reviews the role of lipid therapy in patients with peripheral arterial disease with focus on functional improvement and symptomatic relief based on the available data.", 
    "70": "Molecular mechanisms underlying the role of statins in the induction of brain plasticity and subsequent improvement of neurologic outcome after treatment of stroke have not been adequately investigated. Here, we use both in vivo and in vitro studies to investigate the potential roles of two prominent factors, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), in mediating brain plasticity after treatment of stroke with atorvastatin. Treatment of stroke in adult mice with atorvastatin daily for 14 days, starting at 24 hours after MCAO, shows significant improvement in functional recovery compared with control animals. Atorvastatin increases VEGF, VEGFR2 and BDNF expression in the ischemic border. Numbers of migrating neurons, developmental neurons and synaptophysin-positive cells as well as indices of angiogenesis were significantly increased in the atorvastatin treatment group, compared with controls. In addition, atorvastatin significantly increased brain subventricular zone (SVZ) explant cell migration in vitro. Anti-BDNF antibody significantly inhibited atorvastatin-induced SVZ explant cell migration, indicating a prominent role for BDNF in progenitor cell migration. Mouse brain endothelial cell culture expression of BDNF and VEGFR2 was significantly increased in atorvastatin-treated cells compared with control cells. Inhibition of VEGFR2 significantly decreased expression of BDNF in brain endothelial cells. These data indicate that atorvastatin promotes angiogenesis, brain plasticity and enhances functional recovery after stroke. In addition, VEGF, VEGFR2 and BDNF likely contribute to these restorative processes.", 
    "71": "1. Although statins have been reported to inhibit the prepro-endothelin-1 (ET-1) gene transcription in endothelial cells, their effects on the vascular function of ET-1 have not been explored. We, therefore, examined the effects of statins on contraction and DNA synthesis mediated by ET-1 in vascular smooth muscle. The effects of statins on contraction induced by ET-1 were compared to those mediated by noradrenaline (NA) and KCl. 2. Simvastatin (SV) induced a concentration-dependent relaxation of tonic contraction mediated by ET-1 (10 nM) (IC50 value of 1.3 microM). The relaxation was also observed in rings precontracted with NA (0.1 microM) and KCl (60 mM). In contrast, pravastatin did not have any effect on the contractions. 3. Endothelial denudation or pretreatment with L-NAME did not prevent the relaxation, but did reduce the relaxant activity of SV. 4. SV prevented Rho activation caused by ET-1 and KCl in aortic homogenates, as assessed by a Rho pulldown assay. 5. The Rho kinase inhibitor HA-1077 mimicked the effects of SV on tonic contractions induced by ET-1, NA and KCl. 6. Pretreatment with the Kv channels inhibitor, 4-aminopyridine, attenuated the ability of SV to relax contractions mediated by ET-1 and NA. 7. In quiescent VSM cells, SV significantly inhibited DNA synthesis and Rho translocation stimulated by ET-1, as assessed by [3H]thymidine incorporation and Western blot, respectively. 8. Inhibition of Rho geranylgeranylation by GGTI-297, or treatment with HA-1077, mimicked the effects of SV on DNA synthesis stimulated by ET-1. 9. The results show that the statin potently inhibits both ET-1-mediated contraction and DNA synthesis via multiple mechanisms. Clinical benefits of statins may result, in part, from their effects on vascular function of ET-1.",

Blood biochemistry and extracellular matrix were detected at weeks 0, 2, 4, and 6. At the end of week 6, kidney tissue of all groups was evaluated with special Masson staining for the degree of renal fibrosis as well as regular histopathology.", 
    "74": "Mu-Tong caused progressive elevation of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, hyaluronic acid, procollagen type III, and laminin. All five drugs suppressed elevation of blood biochemistry and extracellular matrix to some degree, but only the simvastatin group showed a significantly reduced percentage of positive Masson staining area in renal section compared to the Mu-Tong group (p < 0.05).", 
    "75": "Our study indicates that Mu-Tong induces a similar kidney injury with general characteristics in patients with renal interstitial fibrosis. All five different drugs have suppressive effects on Mu-Tong-induced renal function damage, and in particular, simvastatin shows a protective effect on development of Mu-Tong-induced renal interstitial fibrosis to a certain degree.", 
    "76": "Simvastatin is best known for its antilipidemic action and use in cardiovascular disease due to its inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoenzymeA (HMG CoA) reductase, a key enzyme in the cholesterol synthesis pathway. Inhibition of biological precursors in this pathway also enables pleiotrophic immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory capabilities, including modulation of growth factor expression. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and persistent myofibroblast formation are major determinants of the aggressive fibrotic disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). In this study we used human lung fibroblasts derived from healthy and IPF lungs to examine Simvastatin effects on CTGF gene and protein expression, analyzed by RT-PCR and ELISA, respectively. Simvastatin significantly inhibited (P < 0.05) CTGF gene and protein expression, overriding the induction by transforming growth factor-beta1, a known potent inducer of CTGF. Such Simvastatin suppressor action on growth factor interaction was reflected functionally on recognized phenotypes of fibrosis. alpha-smooth muscle actin expression was downregulated and collagen gel contraction reduced by 4.94- and 7.58-fold in IMR90 and HIPF lung fibroblasts, respectively, when preconditioned with 10 microM Simvastatin compared with transforming growth factor-beta1 treatment alone after 24 h. Our data suggest that Simvastatin can modify critical determinants of the profibrogenic machinery responsible for the aggressive clinical profile of IPF, and potentially prevents adverse lung parenchymal remodeling associated with persistent myofibroblast formation.", 
    "77": "Statins are widely used hypocholesterolemic drugs that inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, a rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway whose biosynthetic end product is cholesterol. In addition to lowering circulating cholesterol, statins perturb the composition of cell membranes, resulting in disruption of lipid rafts, which function as signaling platforms in immunoreceptor signaling. Furthermore, by inhibiting protein prenylation, a process also dependent on mevalonate, statins block membrane targeting and hence activity of small GTPases, which control multiple pathways triggered by these receptors. T-cell activation is crucially dependent on Ras, Rho and Rab GTPases. Furthermore TCR signaling is orchestrated at lipid rafts, identifying T-cells as potential cellular targets of statins. Here we report that simvastatin suppresses T-cell activation and proliferation as the result of its capacity to inhibit HMG-CoA reductase. T-cell treatment with simvastatin does not affect intracellular cholesterol levels or raft integrity nor, accordingly, the initial tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent cascade. Conversely, inhibition of protein prenylation by simvastatin results in a dramatic impairment in the pathways regulated by small GTPases, including the Ras/MAP kinase pathway, the Rac/stress kinase pathway, and the Rab-dependent pathway of receptor endocytosis. The results identify Ras superfamily GTPases as strategic molecular targets in T-cell immunosuppression by statins.", 
    "78": "Use of herbal medicines among patients under cardiovascular pharmacotherapy is widespread. In this paper, we have reviewed the literature to determine the possible interactions between herbal medicines and cardiovascular drugs. The Medline database was searched for clinical articles published between January 1996 and February 2003. Forty-three case reports and eight clinical trials were identified. Warfarin was the most common cardiovascular drug involved. It was found to interact with boldo, curbicin, fenugreek, garlic, danshen, devil's claw, don quai, ginkgo, papaya, lycium, mango, PC-SPES (resulting in over-anticoagulation) and with ginseng, green tea, soy and St. John's wort (causing decreased anticoagulant effect). Gum guar, St. John's wort, Siberian ginseng and wheat bran were found to decrease plasma digoxin concentration; aspirin interactions include spontaneous hyphema when associated with ginkgo and increased bioavailability if combined with tamarind. Decreased plasma concentration of simvastatin or lovastatin was observed after co-administration with St. John's wort and wheat bran, respectively. Other adverse events include hypertension after co-administration of ginkgo and a diuretic thiazide, hypokalemia after liquorice and antihypertensives and anticoagulation after phenprocoumon and St. John's wort. Interaction between herbal medicine and cardiovascular drugs is a potentially important safety issue. Patients taking anticoagulants are at the highest risk.",

Pravastatin was the most frequently prescribed, followed by atorvastatin; simvastatin and fluvastatin showed lower rates of prescribing. Atorvastatin showed the greatest increased rate over time. An increase in the overall dose prescribed (test for trend P < 0.01) was chiefly due to increases in pravastatin dose, but doses were still below those recommended from clinical trials. Statins were prescribed more frequently in patients with ischaemic heart disease and diabetes, 44% (95% CI 43-45%) compared with the total GMS population, 7.7% (95% CI 7.6-7.8%), by December 2002.

We hypothesized that markers of inflammation, including C-reactive protein (CRP), white blood cell (WBC) count, and lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2), would be associated with the ankle-brachial index (ABI), a marker of atherosclerotic burden. Subjects were 247 patients referred for lower extremity arterial evaluation to the non-invasive vascular laboratory excluding those with active infection or lower extremity revascularization within the previous year. ABI was measured at two sites in both legs and the lowest of four measurements was used in the analyses.

Mean ABI was 0.84+/-0.31 and 49% had an ABI < 0.9. Age, hypertension, fasting plasma glucose, and 'ever' smoking were independently associated with the ABI. Spearman correlation coefficients of inflammatory markers with the ABI were: CRP (r = -0.15, p= 0.02), WBC count (r = -0.27, p = 0.001), and Lp-PLA2 (r = -0.09, p = 0.21). In a multiple regression model that included conventional risk factors and statin use, CRP and WBC count were no longer significantly associated with ABI, whereas Lp-PLA2 was a borderline-significant predictor of lower ABI (p = 0.05). These data indicate that CRP and WBC count are not independently associated with ABI, a marker of atherosclerotic burden in subjects referred for non-invasive lower extremity arterial evaluation. The association of Lp-PLA2 with ABI merits further study.",

    "92": "Breast cancer metastasis is directly associated with breast cancer cell motility. Using a cell culture wounding model, we have demonstrated that keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) enhanced the motility of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells. However, the mechanisms by which KGF enhanced motility of breast cancer cells are not known. In the present study, we report that KGF-induced motility requires intact tyrosine kinase signaling since genistein, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, led to decreased motility of breast cancer cells mediated by KGF. Using cDNA microarrays, we previously found that KGF increased the expression of Grb2 mRNA by 2 3-fold. Since Grb2 plays an important role in tyrosine kinase signaling, we examined the involvement of Grb2 in KGF-induced motility. Down-regulation of Grb2 protein expression inhibited KGF-induced motility. Since Grb2 is known to regulate Erk1,2 and Akt kinase activities we determined whether these downstream proteins may be vital to KGF-induced motility. Inhibiting the activation of Erk1,2 by PD98059 suppressed KGF-induced motility whereas inhibiting the activation of Akt by wortmannin did not affect KGF-induced motility. In conclusion, these results indicate that KGF mediated signal transduction employs Grb2 to transduce the tyrosine kinase signals resulting in the activation of Erk1,2 and breast cancer cell motility.",

We estimated the projected benefit of a secondary prevention \"poly-portfolio\" strategy, including pharmacologic and lifestyle approaches for those with coronary heart disease (CHD) or stroke. Based on recent clinical trial results and clinical guidelines, combinations of a high-dose statin, low to standard doses of antihypertensive therapy, aspirin, omega-3 fish oil, cardiac rehabilitation, and diet were evaluated. Patients with CHD, post-myocardial infarction (MI), or stroke were projected to experience 84%, 91%, and 77% reductions, respectively, in CHD events from a pharmacologic approach. Numbers of those needed to treat (NNT) for 5 years were 9 to 11 to prevent 1 CHD event, and 21 to prevent 1 stroke. Post-MI patients were projected to experience a 93% reduction in the risk of CHD death (NNT 16) from a pharmacologic approach and a 97% reduction in the risk of CHD death (NNT 15) with the addition of lifestyle changes.

We analyzed data from the Heart Transplant Lipid Registry (n = 12 centers). Patients were included if they underwent transplantation between 1995 and 1999, survived >/=30 days after transplantation, and had >/=30 days of Registry follow-up. Multivariable Cox regression models, with propensity scoring performed to adjust for nonrandom allocation of statin therapy, were performed to determine the association of statin therapy with death and fatal rejection. The study included 1,186 patients, with a mean follow-up of 580 +/- 469 days; 937 patients (79%) received statin therapy. Overall, 71 patients (6%) died and 40 (3.4%) had fatal rejection. The statin group had a lower frequency of death (4% vs 13.7%, p <0.0001) and fatal rejection (2.4% vs 7.2%, p = 0.0001). Using multivariable Cox regression, with propensity scoring included to adjust for likelihood of receiving statin therapy, statin use was the only factor associated with lower risk of death (hazard ratio 0.29, 95% confidence interval 0.13 to 0.67) and fatal rejection (hazard ratio 0.27, 95% confidence interval 0.09 to 0.78).

Atherogenic dyslipidemia is an important factor in cardiovascular risk in these patients, and treatment of atherogenic dyslipidemia has been identified as an important goal of therapy in patients with MS. This post hoc analysis of data from a 6-week, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, comparative trial (Statin Therapies for Elevated Lipid Levels compared Across doses to Rosuvastatin [STELLAR]) assessed the effects of rosuvastatin 10, 20, and 40 mg, atorvastatin 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg, simvastatin 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg, and pravastatin 10, 20, and 40 mg on plasma lipids in hypercholesterolemic patients (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol >/=160 and <250 mg/dl; triglycerides <400 mg/dl) who had >/=3 of the 5 National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria for MS (body mass index >30 kg/m(2) substituted for waist circumference). Of 2,268 patients, 811 met criteria for MS. Percent reductions in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol ranged from 20% in the pravastatin 10-mg group to 55% in the rosuvastatin 40-mg group. In patients with MS, triglyceride reductions were 22% to 34% with rosuvastatin, 23% to 33% with atorvastatin, 15% to 23% with simvastatin, and 12% to 15% with pravastatin. High-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased by 8% to 11% with rosuvastatin, 5% to 9% with atorvastatin, 8% to 10% with simvastatin, and 3% to 7% with pravastatin. Rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin treatment had favorable effects in hypercholesterolemic patients on the atherogenic dyslipidemia associated with MS.

    "100": "The effectiveness of statins in the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia and the reduction in cardiovascular risk have now been clearly demonstrated. While their beneficial effects on the reduction of atherosclerosis and its clinical manifestations occur mainly due to the reduction in LDL-cholesterol, some pleiotropic actions which are independent of LDL-cholesterol have frequently been put forward in recent years. In effect, an improvement in endothelial function (increased vasodilatation in particular), an in vitro reduction in smooth muscle cell proliferation, a reduction in thrombosis, promotion of fibrinolysis and positive effects on atheromatous plaque stabilisation have been observed. Elsewhere, some anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties have been attributed to statins. However, many of the described 'pleiotropic' effects are not due to the direct action of statins, but occur with the reduction in LDL-cholesterol. Furthermore, certain in vitro effects only occur at much higher than therapeutic doses. These considerations have therefore caused doubt about the clinical significance of the statins' pleiotropic effects. Finally, analysis of the results of human clinical trials on statins have proved that their effectiveness relies on the reduction in LDL-cholesterol and that the pleiotropic effects do not actually have a clinical implication.",

For CHD patients, the estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for ezetimibe coadministration is under Euro 18 000 per life-year gained (Euro/LYG) and 26 000 Euro/LYG compared with strategies based on the observed titration rates and the aggressive 'titrate to goal' strategy, respectively; for non-CHD diabetic patients, these ratios are under 26 000 Euro/LYG and 48 000 Euro/LYG for ezetimibe coadministration compared with the two titration strategies.",

Each health state can be assigned a quality-of-life weight and an expected cost in order to determine the total survival time, quality-adjusted survival time and cost associated with the alternative treatment strategies. The accuracy of the model in projecting the percentage of patients who experience fatal and nonfatal CHD events was assessed by using individual baseline patient characteristics from two long-term outcomes trials: the Air Force Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention Study, a primary prevention trial, and the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study, a secondary prevention trial.",

However, very few studies have addressed platelet activation in hypercholesterolemia, the potential effect of lipid lowering drugs upon platelet hyperfunction, and the question of whether changes in the latter are correlated to normalization of plasma lipids. This study used whole blood flow cytometry to assess in vivo and in vitro platelet activation in a group of 33 patients with hypercholesterolemia, and also the ex vivo effect of atorvastatin (20 mg/day) upon such activation. A control group of 40 normolipidemic volunteers matched in terms of age, sex and added risk factors to the patient group was used. The results showed that hypercholesterolemic patients had in vivo a significantly greater percentage of GPIIb/IIIa- and phosphatidylserine-positive platelets compared with the control group (4.62+/-3.51% and 2.58+/-1.19% versus 2.73+/-1.08% and 1.54+/-0.68%, respectively). In vitro response of CD62 expression to thrombin was also greater in the patients than in the controls (92.51+/-6.00% versus 89.63+/-10.72%, p<0.05). Atorvastatin therapy normalized platelet hyperfunction in the patients studied and reduced GPIIb/IIIa response to ADP (from 82.65+/-6.43% to 75.84+/-4.89%, p<0.01). A significant correlation can be seen between such normalization and the decrease in plasma levels of total and LDL cholesterol.", 
    "114": "Overexpression of RhoA or RhoC in breast cancer indicates a poor prognosis, due to increased tumor cell proliferation and invasion and tumor-dependent angiogenesis. Until now, the strategy of blockage of the Rho-signaling pathway has used either GGTI or HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, but they are not specific to RhoA or RhoC inhibition. In this study, a new approach with anti-RhoA and anti-RhoC siRNAs was used to inhibit specifically RhoA or RhoC synthesis. Two transfections of either RhoA or RhoC siRNA (8.5 nM) into MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells or HMEC-1 endothelial cells induced extensive degradation of the target mRNA and led to a dramatic decrease in synthesis of the corresponding protein. In vitro, these siRNAs inhibited cell proliferation and invasion more effectively than conventional blockers of Rho cell signaling. Finally, in a nude mouse model, intratumoral injections of anti-RhoA siRNA (100 microl at 85 nM) every 3 days for 20 days almost totally inhibited the growth and angiogenesis of xenografted MDA-MB-231 tumors. One may infer from these observations that specific inhibition of the Rho-signaling pathway with siRNAs represents a promising approach for the treatment of aggressive breast cancers.", 
    "115": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of 3-weeks stationary cardiac rehabilitation on plasma lipids level in patients with CHD. The study included 444 consecutive patients (364 male and 80 female, mean age 58 +/- 9 year) with CHD who underwent 3-weeks stationary cardiac rehabilitation. Patients were divided into groups depending on their baseline levels of cholesterol and medication therapy: patients with normal (< 5 mmol/L, group I, 129 patients) and elevate plasma level of Total cholesterol (> 5 mmol/L, group II, 315 patients) and subgroups Ia and IIa (with statin in therapy), Ib and IIb (without statin in therapy). After 3-weeks cardiac rehabilitation, the levels of Total cholesterol 5.75 +/- 1.34 vs. 5.17 +/- 1.08 mmol/l; p < 0.001, triglycerides 2.04 +/- 1.33 vs. 1.81 +/- 1.06 mmol/L; p = 0.004, LDL-cholesterol 3.77 +/- 1.14 vs. 3.21 +/- 0.96 mmol/L; p < 0.001 were significantly lower while the level of HDL-cholesterol 0.94 +/- 0.28 vs. 0.99 +/- 0.27 mmol/L; p = 0.008 were significantly higher in comparison with the baseline values. Furthermore, we found significant changes in lipid profile at the end of rehabilitation in each group of patients compared with the baseline values. There were no significant differences in plasma lipids level between group of patients with or without statin in therapy at the end of rehabilitation. The results of this study suggest that moderate regular physical activity and diet alone or in combination with hypolipidemic drugs already after 3 weeks have a favourable effect on plasma lipids level and should be propagate in the prevention of CHD.", 
    "116": "The significance of cytokinins for the progression of the cell cycle is well known. Cytokinins contribute to the control of the expression of D-cyclins and other cell cycle genes, but knowledge as to how they affect the progression of the cell cycle is still limited. Highly synchronized tobacco BY-2 cells with clearly defined cell cycle stages were employed to determine cytokinin patterns in detail throughout the entire cycle. Concentrations of trans-zeatin, and of some other cytokinins, oscillated during the course of the cell cycle, increasing substantially at all four phase transitions and decreasing again to a minimum value during the course of each subsequent phase. Addition of exogenous cytokinins or inhibition of cytokinin biosynthesis promoted the progression of the cell cycle when the effects of these manipulations intensified the endogenous fluctuations, whereas the progression of the cycle was retarded when the amplitude of the fluctuations was decreased. The results show that the attainment of low concentrations of cytokinins is as important as the transient increases in concentration for a controlled progression from one phase of the cell cycle to the next. Cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase activity also showed fluctuations during the course of the cell cycle, the timing of which could at least partly explain oscillations of cytokinin levels. The activities of the enzyme were sufficient to account for the rates of cytokinin disappearance observed subsequent to a phase transition.",

Univariate risk factors for graft loss or doubling of serum creatinine were as follows: serum creatinine, proteinuria, hypertension, pulse pressure, time since transplantation, donor age, human leukocyte antigen-DR mismatches, treatment for rejection, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and smoking. Multivariate analysis revealed independent risk factors for graft loss as follows: serum creatinine (relative risk [RR], 3.12 per 100-microM increase), proteinuria (RR, 1.64 per 1-g/24 hr increase), and pulse pressure (RR, 1.12 per 10 mm Hg), whereas age was a protective factor.

In addition to reducing circulating levels of cholesterol, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are thought to have direct salutary effects upon vascular cells. We hypothesized that the new statin, rosuvastatin, would have anti-inflammatory effects on the vessel wall. Eight-week-old apolipoprotein E-deficient mice were fed a normal chow diet for a period of 12 weeks. During this time mice were administered vehicle or rosuvastatin at a dose of 0, 1, 5, or 20 mg/kg by subcutaneous injection at the same time daily for a period of 2 or 6 weeks prior to sacrifice. At the end of the study, rosuvastatin-treated animals displayed lower plasma total cholesterol levels, whereas showing little change in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or triglycerides. Using a functional binding assay, we also demonstrated that endothelial adhesiveness for monocytes was significantly attenuated after 2 weeks of treatment with rosuvastatin. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction determined that rosuvastatin reduced the expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, and metalloproteinase-9 in the vessel wall. In addition, rosuvastatin inhibited vascular expression of p22(phox) and superoxide production, as well as diminishing plasma 8-isoprostanes concentrations. Thus, treatment with rosuvastatin has acute anti-inflammatory actions that likely participate in its beneficial actions during atherogenesis.", 
    "122": "Endothelin (ET)-1 has been implicated in the development of cardiac hypertrophy. We investigated the effect of pravastatin on development of ventricular hypertrophy in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and whether the attenuated hypertrophic effect was via reduced ET-1 expression. Normolipidemic SHR were treated with one of the following therapies for 8 wk: vehicle, the nonselective ET receptor antagonists bosentan, pravastatin, mevalonate, hydralazine, or combination of pravastatin + mevalonate from the age of 8 wk at the very early stage of cardiac hypertrophy. Treatment with bosentan and pravastatin significantly decreased left ventricular mass index for body weight and cardiomyocyte sizes isolated by enzymatic dissociation. The myocardial ET-1 levels and preproET-1 mRNA assessed using real-time quantitative RT-PCR were significantly higher (both P < 0.001) in the SHR compared with Wistar-Kyoto rats. The increased tissue ET-1 levels can be inhibited after pravastatin administration. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the changes of ET-1. Left ventricular mass index for body weight correlated positively with tissue ET-1 levels (P = 0.0004). A dissociation between the effects of blood pressure and cardiac structure was noted, because pravastatin and hydralazine reduced arterial pressure similarly. Pravastatin-induced effects were reversed by the addition of mevalonate. In conclusion, these results suggest a crucial role of cardiac endothelin system in the early development of ventricular hypertrophy in the SHR. Pravastatin is endowed with cardiac antihypertropic properties that are independent of its hemodynamic and hypolipidemic effects and appear to be related to their capacity to decrease cardiac ET-1 levels, which is linked to mevalonate metabolism.", 
    "123": "Therapies to limit the life-threatening vascular leak observed in patients with acute lung injury (ALI) are currently lacking. We explored the effect of simvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase inhibitor that mediates endothelial cell barrier protection in vitro, in a murine inflammatory model of ALI. C57BL/6J mice were treated with simvastatin (5 or 20 mg/kg body wt via intraperitoneal injection) 24 h before and again concomitantly with intratracheally administered LPS (2 microg/g body wt). Inflammatory indexes [bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) myeloperoxidase activity and total neutrophil counts assessed at 24 h with histological confirmation] were markedly increased after LPS alone but significantly reduced in mice that also received simvastatin (20 mg/kg; approximately 35-60% reduction). Simvastatin also decreased BAL albumin (approximately 50% reduction) and Evans blue albumin dye extravasation into lung tissue (100%) consistent with barrier protection. Finally, the sustained nature of simvastatin-mediated lung protection was assessed by analysis of simvastatin-induced gene expression (Affymetrix platform). LPS-mediated lung gene expression was significantly modulated by simvastatin within a number of gene ontologies (e.g., inflammation and immune response, NF-kappaB regulation) and with respect to individual genes implicated in the development or severity of ALI (e.g., IL-6, Toll-like receptor 4). Together, these findings confirm significant protection by simvastatin on LPS-induced lung vascular leak and inflammation and implicate a potential role for statins in the management of ALI.", 
    "124": "A quantitative method was developed and validated for rapid and sensitive analysis of pravastatin and R-416, the main metabolite of pravastatin, in human plasma. The analytes were extracted from plasma samples by a solid phase extraction method using a Bond Elut C(8). The method involved the use of liquid chromatography coupled with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) and selected reaction monitoring (SRM) mass spectrometry. A pravastatin analog, R-122798, was used as the internal standard (I.S.). Separation of pravastatin, R-416 and the I.S. was accomplished using a reverse-phase column (C(18)). The components eluted were ionized by the APCI source (negative ion) and subsequently detected by a highly selective triple quadrupole mass spectrometer in the SRM mode. Linear standard curves were obtained from 0.1 ng/mL (lower limit of quantification, LLOQ) to 100 ng/mL. The intra-assay precisions (coefficient of variation) for the samples at the LLOQ were 1.8% for pravastatin and 1.6% for R-416. The intra-assay accuracy values were 95.8-107.6% for pravastatin, and 92.6-109.0% for R-416, respectively. Precision and accuracy of quality control (QC) samples were determined at concentrations of 0.5, 10 and 80 ng/mL for all analytes. The intra- and inter-assay precision calculated from QC samples were within 10% for pravastatin and within 11% for R-416. The overall recoveries for pravastatin and R-416 were 75.7-82.1% and 68.6-74.3%, respectively. Pravastatin and R-416 were stable in human plasma for 3 weeks at -20 degrees C in a freezer, up to 6h at room temperature, and up to 48 h at 6 degrees C. This assay method was successfully used to evaluate the pravastatin and R-416 levels in healthy volunteers following oral administration of Mevalotin.", 
    "125": "The aim of the study was to compare the effect of treatment with two different statins on plasma fibrinogen levels in patients with primary isolated hypercholesterolemia. Sixty three patients enrolled into the study were randomly divided into two groups, treated with simvastatin (20 mg/d) or fluvastatin (40 mg/d), respectively. Plasma lipid profile and fibrinogen levels were measured after 4 and 12 weeks of the therapy. Both drugs decreased total and LDL cholesterol and apoprotein B levels. Simvastatin additionally reduced triglyceride levels. After 4 weeks of treatment both drugs tended to increase plasma fibrinogen levels, while after 12 weeks fibrinogen level was significantly increased in the simvastatin-treated patients. The effect on fibrinogen did not correlate with their lipid-lowering potential, gender and was similar in patients positive and negative for anti-Helicobacter pylori or anti-Chlamydia pneumoniae antibodies. Our results support the findings about a relatively weak effect of statin therapy on plasma fibrinogen level and partially explain contradictory results of previous studies.",

Although all statins share a common mechanism of action, they differ in terms of their chemical structures, pharmacokinetic profiles, and lipid-modifying efficacy. The chemical structures of statins govern their water solubility, which in turn influences their absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion. Lovastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin are derived from fungal metabolites and have elimination half-lives of 1-3 h. Atorvastatin, cerivastatin (withdrawn from clinical use in 2001), fluvastatin, pitavastatin and rosuvastatin are fully synthetic compounds, with elimination half-lives ranging from 1 h for fluvastatin to 19 h for rosuvastatin. Atorvastatin, simvastatin, lovastatin, fluvastatin, cerivastatin and pitavastatin are relatively lipophilic compounds. Lipophilic statins are more susceptible to metabolism by the cytochrome P(450) system, except for pitavastatin, which undergoes limited metabolism via this pathway. Pravastatin and rosuvastatin are relatively hydrophilic and not significantly metabolized by cytochrome P(450) enzymes. All statins are selective for effect in the liver, largely because of efficient first-pass uptake; passive diffusion through hepatocyte cell membranes is primarily responsible for hepatic uptake of lipophilic statins, while hydrophilic agents are taken up by active carrier-mediated processes. Pravastatin and rosuvastatin show greater hepatoselectivity than lipophilic agents, as well as a reduced potential for uptake by peripheral cells. The bioavailability of the statins differs greatly, from 5% for lovastatin and simvastatin to 60% or greater for cerivastatin and pitavastatin. Clinical studies have demonstrated rosuvastatin to be the most effective for reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, followed by atorvastatin, simvastatin and pravastatin. As a class, statins are generally well tolerated and serious adverse events, including muscle toxicity leading to rhabdomyolysis, are rare. Consideration of the differences between the statins helps to provide a rational basis for their use in clinical practice.", 
    "128": "The NASDAC study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of atorvastatin at starting doses of 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg.", 
    "129": "After an 8-week placebo washout period, 919 patients who were candidates for lipid-lowering therapy according to the National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines were randomized to 1 of 4 atorvastatin treatment groups: 10 mg (n = 229), 20 mg (n = 228), 40 mg (n = 231), and 80 mg (n = 231).", 
    "130": "Atorvastatin reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels dose dependently across the 10- to 80-mg-dose range (35.7%-52.2%). Each of the 20-, 40-, and 80-mg doses provided significantly greater decreases in LDL-C than all lower doses (P < .01). All doses also reduced total cholesterol, the LDL-C/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, apolipoprotein B, and triglycerides from baseline. An increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was observed in all dose groups. Most participants, regardless of their level of coronary heart disease risk, attained their National Cholesterol Education Program's Adult Treatment Panel III LDL-C goal by the end of the study. Patients in all risk groups were more likely to achieve the NCEP LDL-C goal at higher starting doses. Atorvastatin was well tolerated at all dose levels.", 
    "131": "Atorvastatin initiated at doses of 10, 20, 40, and 80 mg is effective and safe for the treatment of patients with dyslipidemia. Depending on the percentage reduction needed to achieve an LDL-C goal, patients with or at risk of coronary heart disease may benefit from starting therapy at a higher dose of atorvastatin.", 
    "132": "We encountered a 49-year-old HIV-infected man with chronic renal insufficiency who developed rhabdomyolysis after treatment with simvastatin. He recovered after initiating hemodialysis and discontinuing oral medications. Rhabdomyolysis most likely resulted from an excessive blood concentration of simvastatin caused by concomitant use of fluconazole in the presence of renal insufficiency.", 
    "133": "To investigate the effects of pravastatin, a potent 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, on impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation induced by lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), the major component of oxidized low-density lipoprotein, in rat thoracic aorta.", 
    "134": "Both the endothelium-dependent relaxation response to acetylcholine and the endothelium-independent relaxation response to sodium nitroprusside of aortic rings were measured by recording isometric tension after the rings were exposed to LPC in the absence or presence of pravastatin to estimate the injury effect of LPC and the protective effect of pravastatin on the aortic endothelium, respectively.", 
    "135": "Exposure of aortic rings to LPC (1-10 micromol/L) for 30 min induced a significant concentration-dependent inhibition of endothelium-dependent relaxation to acetylcholine, but did not affect endothelium-independent relaxation in response to sodium nitroprusside. Pre-incubation of aortic rings with pravastatin (0.3-3 mmol/L) for 15 min and then co-incubation of the rings with LPC (3 micromol/L) for another 30 min significantly attenuated the inhibition of endothelium-dependent relaxation induced by LPC. This protective effect of pravastatin (1 mmol/L) was abolished by NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (30 micromol/L), an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, but not by indomethacin (10 micromol/L), an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase. Moreover, protein kinase C inhibitor chelerythrine (1 micromol/L) the superoxide anion scavenger superoxide dismutase (200 kU/L), and the nitric oxide precursor L-arginine (3 mmol/L) also improved the impaired endothelium-dependent relaxation induced by LPC, similar to the effects of pravastatin.", 
    "136": "Pravastatin can protect the endothelium against functional injury induced by LPC in rat aorta, a fact which is related to increasing nitric oxide bioavailability.", 
    "137": "Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) are one of the most widely prescribed classes of drugs throughout the world, because of their excellent cholesterol-lowering effect and overall safety profile except for rare but fatal rhabdomyolysis arising either directly or indirectly by pharmacokinetic interactions with certain other drugs. As package inserts in pharmaceuticals are the primary source of information for health care providers, we carried out a literature search to examine how crucial information was provided in package inserts of five statins approved in Japan (simvastatin, atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pravastatin and pitavastatin).", 
    "138": "A MEDLINE search from 1996 to June 2004 was carried out to identify studies on clinical pharmacokinetic drug interactions for the five statins. We mainly collected information on area under plasma concentration (AUC) following co-administration of statins with other drugs. The current package inserts used in Japan were obtained from the website of the Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Agency whereas USA package inserts were obtained from the Food and Drug Administration website.", 
    "139": "The majority of package inserts listed the drugs that interacted with statins with most describing the risk of rhabdomyolysis because of the possibility of increases in blood concentration. However, quantitative information such as change in AUC was provided in only a few cases. Instructions for dosage adjustment are seldom provided in the Japanese package inserts. USA package inserts list almost identical drug interactions as the Japanese package inserts, although they contain more quantitative data, especially for typical cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibitors.", 
    "140": "All pharmacokinetic drug interactions including relevant quantitative data for potential effectors and details on mechanisms of interaction need to be given in package inserts as soon as the information becomes available, to ensure safe and proper use of the drugs concerned. Including such information in the package insert will be an extremely valuable aid for health care providers.", 
    "141": "To observe the intervention of Xuezhikang (XZK) on patients of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with different levels of blood lipids.", 
    "142": "Adopting the double blind randomized controlled method, 105 patients of ACS were divided into two groups. The 53 patients in the treated group, 26 with normal blood lipids (NBL) and 27 with hyperlipemia (HL) were treated with conventional western medicine plus XZK 1.2 g per day for 12 weeks. The 52 patients in the control group, 25 with NBL and 27 with HL, were treated with conventional western medicine alone. Besides, a healthy control group consisted of 40 subjects was set up. The changes of brachial arterial endothelium-dependent diastolic function (FMD) before and after treatment was observed, the changes of blood levels of nitric oxide (NO), endothelin-1 (ET-1), C-reactive protein (CRP) and lipids were also recorded.", 
    "143": "Before treatment, FMD value and serum NO level were lower and ET-1 and CRP levels in ACS patients were higher than those in the healthy subjects, and a significant correlation existed between CRP, NO and FMD with LDL-C. After treated for 12 weeks, FMD value and serum NO level increased, levels of ET-1 and CRP decreased significantly in the treated group, showing significant difference to those in the control group (P < 0.05, P < 0.01). Serum levels of TC, TG and LDL-C in the treated group lowered significantly. HDL-C level in patients with HL increased significantly while in those with NBL, it showed a trend of increasing but with no statistical significance.", 
    "144": "Applying XZK in ACS patients in early stage, either with NBL or with HL, could improve the endothelial function, antagonize inflammatory response to stabilize the atheromatous plaque.", 
    "145": "Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) is associated with elevated cholesterol levels and early-onset atherosclerosis. We assessed the efficacy and safety for up to 2 yr of pravastatin treatment in 19 girls and 11 boys (age range, 4.1-18.5 yr) with HeFH. Pravastatin was started at 10 mg/d, with a forced titration by 10 mg at 2, 4, 6, and 12 months until the target cholesterol level [< or =194 mg/dl (< or =5 mmol/liter)] was reached. By 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 months of treatment, the total cholesterol levels had, respectively, decreased by 19, 20, 23, 27, and 26%, and the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels had decreased by 25, 27, 29, 33, and 32% compared with the dietary baseline values. Seventeen percent of patients had lipid deposits (carotid plaque, xanthomas, or corneal arcus) at baseline, and 27% had deposits at 1 yr. The side effects were mild, and no clinically significant elevations in alanine aminotransferase, creatine kinase, or creatinine were seen. Growth and pubertal maturation remained normal in all subjects. In conclusion, pravastatin treatment was safe and well tolerated. The efficacy in children with slight or moderate hypercholesterolemia was satisfactory, but in children with severe hypercholesterolemia, it was insufficient."
