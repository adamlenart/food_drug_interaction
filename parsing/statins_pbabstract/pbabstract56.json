These effects, independent of the lipid-lowering effects, make the statins a class of drugs that are primed for repurposing and being used in disease states where innate and adaptive immunity and endothelial damage play a key role. Thus far, statins have been used in Behcet's, rheumatoid arthritis and Kawasaki disease with some promising results.

Since, instead of serum cholesterol, intracellular cholesterol may play a crucial role in the regulation of tumorigenesis and metastasis. The mechanism by which cholesterol is stored within cancer cells may differ among cancer types and also in different individuals.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death worldwide and will be for some time. Cholesterol is a critical player which drives the underlying pathophysiological process of atherosclerosis. Statins are the first line treatment for lipids in CVD given their ability to low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) by up to 50%, and their proven benefits in both primary and secondary intervention . Despite the unprecedented efficacy of statins, additional treatments are sought to potentially reduce the residual risk that remains despite statin treatment such as that associated with reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (HDL-C) or triglycerides . In the last 5 years, several trials have reported on their potential additional benefit beyond statin therapy. These include omega-3 fatty acids in patients with prediabetes or diabetes , fibrates in diabetes , nicotinic acid/niacin in cardiovascular disease and cholesterol ester transfer protein inhibitors in cardiovascular disease . Despite their promise, none of these treatments were able to demonstrate benefit beyond baseline statin therapy when compared with placebo .

Atherosclerosis is also involved in the pathogenesis of bone demineralization, a typical hallmark of aging, which is associated with ectopic calcification at vascular and valvular levels. Animal studies have recently contributed to demonstrate that lipids play an important role in AS pathogenesis through the activation of molecular cell signalings, such as Wnt/Lrp5 and RANK/RANKL/Osteprotegerin, which induce the transition of valvular myofibroblasts toward an osteogenic phenotype with consequent valvular bone deposition. Although all these evidence strongly support the lipid theory in AS pathogenesis, lipids lowering therapies failed to demonstrate in controlled trials a significant efficacy to slow AS progression.

Therefore, lifestyle interventions and pharmacological approaches to decrease cholesterol are widely used in cardiovascular disease prevention. The introduction and widespread use of 3-hydroxy-3 methylglutaryl coenzyme A inhibitors (statins) for individuals at risk of atherosclerotic disease has been an important advance in cardiovascular care. There can be no doubt that better control of dyslipidemia, even in subjects whose low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level is not particularly high, has reduced overall event rates. On a background of lifestyle interventions, statins are routinely used to decrease risk along with aspirin and interventions to control hypertension and diabetes. More than other risk factors, the approach to the identification and treatment of dyslipidemia has been heterogeneous and widely debated. The recent release of the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association dyslipidemia guidelines has reignited the controversy over the best approach for risk stratification and treatment. In this article we review the importance of statin therapy for global cardiovascular risk reduction, compare the Canadian Cardiovascular Society dyslipidemia guidelines with other standards, and discuss the points of debate. Despite the seeming variety of recommendations, their common link is a systematic approach to risk stratification and treatment, which will continue to benefit our patients at risk.",

By contrast, baseline and postrosuvastatin treatment plasma sphingomyelin levels were not associated with apoB-100 kinetics. Plasma ceramides and sphingomyelin were not associated with the kinetics or concentrations of high-density lipoprotein apoA-I, and low-density lipoprotein apoB.

Recently, elevation of sitosterol, a lipid absorption marker, was reported to be associated with premature atherosclerosis. The purpose of the present study was to examine the impact of ezetimibe, a selective intestinal cholesterol transporter inhibitor, in ACS patients. Methods. A total of 197 ACS patients were randomized to pitavastatin + ezetimibe (n = 100) or pitavastatin (n = 97). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and sitosterol levels were evaluated on admission and after 12 weeks. Results. After 12 weeks, the pitavastatin + ezetimibe group showed a significantly greater decrease of sitosterol (baseline versus after 12 weeks; 2.9 \u00b1 2.5 versus 1.7 \u00b1 1.0\u2009ng/mL, P < 0.001) than the pitavastatin group (2.7 \u00b1 1.5 versus 3.0 \u00b1 1.4\u2009ng/mL).

Conclusions. Ezetimibe plus statin therapy in ACS patients with dyslipidemia decreased LDL-C and sitosterol levels more than statin therapy solo. Sitosterol Elevation was a predictor of poor response to aggressive lipid-lowering treatment in ACS patients.",

This study aimed to investigate the effects of atorvastatin on the prevention of osteoporosis and dyslipidemia in ovariectomized rats fed with high-fat emulsion. The 3-month-old female rats were subjected to either sham operations (n = 8) or ovariectomized operations (OVX, n = 24). The OVX rats were orally administered deionized water (n = 8) or standardized high-fat emulsion without (n = 8) or with atorvastatin (n = 8). All rats were injected twice with calcein before sacrificed for the purpose of double in vivo labeling. After 12 weeks, all rats were sacrificed under anesthesia. Biochemistry, histomorphometry, mechanical test, micro-computed tomography analysis, mechanical test, histology, and component analysis were performed. We found that high-fat emulsion significantly decreased body weight, bone formation, collagen content of bone, and bone biomechanics, while increased blood, liver, and bone marrow lipids. Atorvastatin treatment prevented dyslipidemia, reversed hepatic steatosis, optimized composition of bone, and improved bone mechanical properties. The current study provided further evidence that atorvastatin might be useful for the treatment of osteoporotic patients with dyslipidemia.",

Markers of cholesterol metabolism (plant sterols and cholestanol as markers of cholesterol absorption and lathosterol as an indicator of cholesterol synthesis) and oxyphytosterols were determined in plasma and aortic valve tissue from 104 consecutive patients with severe aortic stenosis (n=68 statin treatment; n=36 no statin treatment) using gas chromatography-flame ionization and mass spectrometry. The extent of CAD was determined by coronary angiography prior to aortic valve replacement. Patients treated with statins were characterized by lower plasma cholesterol, cholestanol, and lathosterol concentrations. However, statin treatment did not affect the sterol concentrations in cardiovascular tissue. The ratio of campesterol-to-cholesterol was increased by 0.46\u00b10.34\u03bcg/mg (26.0%) in plasma of patients with CAD. The absolute values for the cholesterol absorption markers sitosterol and campesterol were increased by 18.18\u00b111.59ng/mg (38.8%) and 11.40\u00b18.69ng/mg (30.4%) in the tissues from patients with documented CAD compared to those without concomitant CAD. Campesterol oxides were increased by 0.06\u00b10.02ng/mg (17.1%) in the aortic valve cusps and oxidized sitosterol-to-cholesterol ratios were up-regulated by 0.35\u00b10.2ng/mg (22.7%) in the plasma of patients with CAD. Of note, neither cholestanol nor the ratio of cholestanol-to-cholesterol was associated with CAD. Patients with concomitant CAD are characterized by increased deposition of plant sterols, but not cholestanol in aortic valve tissue. Moreover, patients with concomitant CAD were characterized by increased oxyphytosterol concentrations in plasma and aortic valve cusps.", 
    "53": "Inhibition of hepatic transporters such as organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs) 1B can cause drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Determining the impact of perpetrator drugs on the plasma exposure of endogenous substrates for OATP1B could be valuable to assess the risk for DDIs early in drug development. As OATP1B orthologs are well conserved between human and monkey, we assessed in cynomolgus monkeys the endogenous OATP1B substrates that are potentially suitable to assess DDI risk in humans. The effect of rifampin (RIF), a potent inhibitor for OATP1B, on plasma exposure of endogenous substrates of hepatic transporters was measured. From the 18 biomarkers tested, RIF (18 mg/kg, oral) caused significant elevation of plasma unconjugated and conjugated bilirubin, which may be attributed to inhibition of cOATP1B1 and cOATP1B3 based on in vitro to in vivo extrapolation analysis. To further evaluate whether cynomolgus monkeys are a suitable translational model to study OATP1B-mediated DDIs, we determined the inhibitory effect of RIF on in vitro transport and pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin (RSV) and atorvastatin (ATV). RIF strongly inhibited the uptake of RSV and ATV by cOATP1B1 and cOATP1B3 in vitro. In agreement with clinical observations, RIF (18 mg/kg, oral) significantly decreased plasma clearance and increased the area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) of intravenously administered RSV by 2.8- and 2.7-fold, and increased the AUC and maximum plasma concentration of orally administered RSV by 6- and 10.3-fold, respectively. In contrast to clinical findings, RIF did not significantly increase plasma exposure of either intravenous or orally administered ATV, indicating species differences in the rate-limiting elimination pathways.",

Using Cox proportional-hazards models, we identified the following independent predictors of stroke in patients without AF (ranked by \u03c7(2) value): age (hazard ratio, 1.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-1.63 per 10 years), New York Heart Association class (1.60, 1.21-2.12 class III/IV versus II), diabetes mellitus treated with insulin (1.87, 1.22-2.88), body mass index (0.74, 0.60-0.91 per 5 kg/m(2) up to 30), and previous stroke (1.81, 1.19-2.74). N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (available in 2632 patients) was also an independent predictor of stroke (hazard ratio, 1.31; 1.11-1.57 per log unit) when added to this model.

    "72": "The regression discontinuity (RD) design is a quasi-experimental design that estimates the causal effects of a treatment by exploiting naturally occurring treatment rules. It can be applied in any context where a particular treatment or intervention is administered according to a pre-specified rule linked to a continuous variable. Such thresholds are common in primary care drug prescription where the RD design can be used to estimate the causal effect of medication in the general population. Such results can then be contrasted to those obtained from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and inform prescription policy and guidelines based on a more realistic and less expensive context. In this paper, we focus on statins, a class of cholesterol-lowering drugs, however, the methodology can be applied to many other drugs provided these are prescribed in accordance to pre-determined guidelines. Current guidelines in the UK state that statins should be prescribed to patients with 10-year cardiovascular disease risk scores in excess of 20%. If we consider patients whose risk scores are close to the 20% \u2009risk score threshold, we find that there is an element of random variation in both the risk score itself and its measurement. We can therefore consider the threshold as a randomising device that assigns statin prescription to individuals just above the threshold and withholds it from those just below. Thus, we are effectively replicating the conditions of an RCT in the area around the threshold, removing or at least mitigating confounding. We frame the RD design in the language of conditional independence, which clarifies the assumptions necessary to apply an RD design to data, and which makes the links with instrumental variables clear. We also have context-specific knowledge about the expected sizes of the effects of statin prescription and are thus able to incorporate this into Bayesian models by formulating informative priors on our causal parameters.",

We achieved a MEDLINE/EMBASE comprehensive search for studies published up to August 2014 investigating the association between use of statins and the risk of hematological malignancies, including Hodgkin- and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, and myeloma. Fixed- and random-effect models were fitted to estimate the summary relative risk (RR) based on adjusted study-specific results. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed using the Q and I(2) statistics and the sources of heterogeneity were investigated using Deeks' test. Moreover, an influence analysis was performed. Finally, publication bias was evaluated using funnel plot and Egger's regression asymmetry test. Fourteen studies (10 case-control and four cohort studies) contributed to the analysis. Statin use, compared to nonuse of statins, was negatively associated with all hematological malignancies taken together (summary RR 0.86; 95% CI: 0.77-0.96), with leukemia (0.83; 0.74-0.92), and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (0.81; 0.68 to 0.96), but it was not related to the risk of myeloma (0.89; 0.53-1.51). Long-term users of statins showed a statistically significant reduction in the risk of all hematological malignancies taken together (0.78; 0.71-0.87). Statistically significant between-studies heterogeneity was observed for all outcome except for leukemia. Heterogeneity was caused by differences confounding-adjustment level of the included studies only for Myeloma. No significant evidence of publication bias was found.",

We characterized the morphology, encapsulation efficiency and in vitro drug release of SIM-loaded PLGA microspheres as well as the macrostructure, pore size, porosity and mechanical strength of the scaffolds. Rabbit bone mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) were seeded onto SIM-PLGA-CPC scaffolds, and the proliferation, morphology, cell cycle and differentiation of BMSCs were investigated using the cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), flow cytometry, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and alizarin red S staining, respectively. The results revealed that SIM-PLGA-CPC scaffolds were biocompatible and osteogenic in vitro. To determine the in vivo biocompatibility and osteogenesis of the scaffolds, both pure PLGA-CPC scaffolds and SIM-PLGA-CPC scaffolds were implanted in rabbit femoral condyles and microradiographically and histologically investigated. SIM-PLGA-CPC scaffolds exhibited good biocompatibility and could improve the efficiency of new bone formation.

Our primary hypothesis was that maximal dose rosuvastatin would decrease the apoB-100 production rate (PR), as well as increase apoB-100 fractional catabolic rate (FCR). Eight subjects received placebo, rosuvastatin 5 mg/day, and rosuvastatin 40 mg/day for 8 weeks each in sequential order. The kinetics of apoB-100 in TRL and LDL and apoA-I in HDL were determined at the end of each phase using stable isotope methodology, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and multicompartmental modeling. Rosuvastatin at 5 and 40 mg/day decreased LDL cholesterol by 44 and 54% (both P < 0.0001), triacylglycerol by 14% (ns) and 35% (P < 0.01), apoB by 30 and 36% (both P < 0.0001), respectively, and had no significant effects on HDL cholesterol or apoA-I levels. Significant decreases in plasma markers of cholesterol synthesis and increases in cholesterol absorption markers were observed. Rosuvastatin 5 and 40 mg/day increased TRL apoB-100 FCR by 36 and 46% (both ns) and LDL apoB-100 by 63 and 102% (both P < 0.05), respectively. HDL apoA-I PR increased with low dose rosuvastatin (12%, P < 0.05) but not with maximal dose rosuvastatin. Neither rosuvastatin dose altered apoB-100 PR or HDL apoA-I FCR. Our data indicate that maximal dose rosuvastatin treatment in subjects with combined hyperlipidemia resulted in significant increases in the catabolism of LDL apoB-100, with no significant effects on apoB-100 production or HDL apoA-I kinetics.",

The Plackett-Burman design was used to select important variables affecting lovastatin production. Accordingly, glucose, peptone, and agitation speed were determined as the variables that have influence on lovastatin production. In a further experiment, these variables were optimized with a Box-Behnken design and applied in a submerged process; this resulted in 12.51 mg/L lovastatin production on a medium containing glucose (10 g/L), peptone (5 g/L), thiamine (1 mg/L), and NaCl (0.4 g/L) under static conditions. This level of lovastatin production is eight times higher than that produced under unoptimized media and growth conditions by Omphalotus olearius. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to optimize submerged fermentation process for lovastatin production by Omphalotus olearius.",

The incidence of coronary perforation in patients undergoing PCI ranges from 0.1% to 0.5%. The use of long balloon inflation and reversal anticoagulation is associated with high mortality, periprocedural myocardial infarction and emergency coronary bypass surgery. We present a case of severe coronary perforation treated with the dual catheter technique through the radial and femoral approach. The dual catheter technique enabled rapid delivery of a covered stent without losing control of the perforation site. Our patient did not show pericardial effusion, hemodynamic instability or need for emergency bypass surgery. About 1h after PCI, he developed acute stent thrombosis treated with thromboaspiration and biolimus-eluting stent implantation. At 2 years of follow-up, he was asymptomatic without evidence of exercise-induced ischemia. We conclude that the dual catheter technique is a safe and effective approach to treat PCI-induced severe coronary perforation, and may significantly improve patient outcome compared to historical series.",

A bioactive graft may be produced by combining tissue scaffolds and healing promotive factors in order to accelerate bone repair. We investigated the role of Simvastatin (Sim)-embedded porous Gelapin (Gel) scaffold on experimental bone healing. At first, the effectiveness of different concentrations of Gel and Sim powders was investigated in an experimentally induced femoral hole model in rabbits (n = 6) for 30 days. Then bone bioactive grafts were produced by combination of the effective concentrations of Gel, Sim, and Genipin. The bioimplants were subcutaneously tested in a rabbit model (n = 9) to determine their biocompatibility and biodegradability for 10-30 days. Finally, a large radial bone defect model was produced in rabbits (n = 20), and the bioimplants were inserted in the defects. The untreated and autograft-treated bone defects were served as controls. The animals were euthanized after 30 and 60 days of bone injury. The bone samples were evaluated by radiography, three-dimensional CT scan, bone densitometry, histopathology, and nano-indentation. At a concentration of 5 mg/hole, Sim closed the femoral bone holes after 30 days, while in the defect, autograft, and Gel groups, the holes were open. Both the Gel and Gel-Sim scaffolds were biocompatible and biodegradable. Subcutaneously, the Gel-Sim scaffold was replaced with the newly regenerated ectopic bone after 30 days. After implantation of the Gel-Sim scaffold in the radial bone defects, the scaffold was completely replaced with new woven bone after 30 days which was then matured and remodeled into a cortical bone after 60 days. Sixty days after bone injury, the Gel-Sim-treated defects had significantly higher bone volume, matrix mineralization, elastic modulus, and contact hardness when compared to the controls. The Gel-Sim scaffold may be a suitable option in managing LBDs.",

The prevalence of dyslipidemias in children with CKD and ESRD is high, being present in 39-65% of patients. Elevated lipid levels in children without renal disease are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD), while the risk for CVD in pediatric CKD/ESRD is unclear. The pathogenesis of dyslipidemia in CKD features various factors, including increased levels of triglycerides, triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, apolipoprotein C3 (ApoC-III), decreased levels of cholesterylester transfer protein and high-density lipoproteins, and aberrations in serum very low-density and intermediate-density lipoproteins. If initial risk assessment indicates that a child with advanced CKD has 2 or more co-morbidities for CVD, first-line treatment should consist of non-pharmacologic management such as therapeutic lifestyle changes and dietary counseling. Pharmacologic treatment of dyslipidemia may reduce the incidence of CVD in children with CKD/ESRD, but randomized trials are lacking. Statins are the only class of lipid-lowering drugs currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in the pediatric population. FDA-approved pediatric labeling for these drugs is based on results from placebo-controlled trial results, showing 30-50% reductions in baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

Moreover, atorvastatin was able to induce PPAR\u03b3 expression and activation in human monocytes in vivo and in vitro, resulting in priming primary human monocytes differentiation into M2 macrophages with a more pronounced paracrine anti-inflammatory activity in M1 macrophages. Additional data with molecular approaches revealed that p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 activation was involved in atorvastatin-mediated PPAR\u03b3 activation and enhanced alternative M2 macrophage phenotype.

We present a case of bilateral persistent plantar warts, resistant to treatment with repeated cryotherapy and topical salicylic acid over a 6-year period. Following a patient initiated decision to discontinue their statin medication, we observed rapid clearance of plantar warts without change to standard therapy or their environment. This case correlates with emerging literature demonstrating a link between statin medication and proliferation of HPV through increased levels of FOXP3+ regulatory T cells.", 
    "166": "The 3-hydroxy-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, statins, are widely used in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases to lower serum cholesterol levels. As type 2 diabetes mellitus is accompanied by dyslipidemia, statins have a major role in preventing the long term complications in diabetes and are recommended for diabetics with normal low density lipoprotein levels as well. In 2012, United States Food and Drug Administration released changes to statin safety label to include that statins have been found to increase glycosylated haemoglobin and fasting serum glucose levels. Many studies done on patients with cardiovascular risk factors have shown that statins have diabetogenic potential and the effect varies as per the dosage and type used. The various mechanisms for this effect have been proposed and one of them is downregulation of glucose transporters by the statins. The recommendations by the investigators are that though statins can have diabetogenic risk, they have more long term benefits which can outweigh the risk. In elderly patients and those with metabolic syndrome, as the risk of diabetes increase, the statins should be used cautiously. Other than a subset of population with risk for diabetes; statins still have long term survival benefits in most of the patients.", 
    "167": "Portal hypertension (PH) is a common complication of chronic liver disease, and it determines most complications leading to death or liver transplantation in patients with liver cirrhosis. PH results from increased resistance to portal blood flow through the cirrhotic liver. This is caused by two mechanisms: (a) distortion of the liver vascular architecture and (b) hepatic microvascular dysfunction. Increment in hepatic resistance is latterly accompanied by splanchnic vasodilation, which further aggravates PH. Hepatic microvascular dysfunction occurs early in the course of chronic liver disease as a consequence of inflammation and oxidative stress and determines loss of the normal phenotype of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSEC). The cross-talk between LSEC and hepatic stellate cells induces activation of the latter, which in turn proliferate, migrate and increase collagen deposition around the sinusoids, contributing to fibrogenesis, architectural disruption and angiogenesis. Therapy for PH aims at correcting these pathophysiological abnormalities: liver injury, fibrogenesis, increased hepatic vascular tone and splanchnic vasodilatation. Continuing liver injury may be counteracted specifically by etiological treatments, while architectural disruption and fibrosis can be ameliorated by a variety of anti-fibrogenic drugs and anti-angiogenic strategies. Sinusoidal endothelial dysfunction is ameliorated by statins and other drugs increasing NO availability. Splanchnic hyperemia can be counteracted by non-selective beta-blockers (NSBBs), vasopressin analogs and somatostatin analogs. Future treatment of portal hypertension will evolve to use etiological treatments together with anti-fibrotic agents and/or drugs improving microvascular function in initial stages of cirrhosis (pre-primary prophylaxis), while NSBBs will be added in advanced stages of the disease.",

Model inputs, such as age, gender, and prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors of the dyslipidemic Portuguese patients were obtained from the Portuguese cohort of the Dyslipidemia International Study (DYSIS). The efficacy of each treatment regimen, the cost of drugs and of treating CHD events, and the utilities for each disease state were derived from published sources.",

    "172": "Chronic L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD) often results in debilitating involuntary movements known as L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (LID), which is the main obstacle in PD. The abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) are consistently involved with the activation of the Ras-extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Previous research has also shown that blockade of ERK phosphorylation could reduce the induction of LID. Consequently, inhibitors of MAPK signaling cascade that block the aberrant supersensitive response of direct pathway striatal neurons could provide a novel therapeutic adjunct to L-DOPA in the treatment of PD. Statins, a specific inhibitor of the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, can also inhibit Ras isoprenylation and activity, and the subsequent phosphorylation of ERK1/2 (pERK1/2). Simvastatin, a representative of statins, could reduce L-DOPA-induced AIM incidence and severity in the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) rat model of PD by preventing the L-DOPA/benserazide-induced increase in pERK1/2 levels in our study. The simvastatin-L-DOPA/benserazide-treated 6-OHDA animals displayed less severe rotational behavior and a dramatic reduction in AIM severity than the L-DOPA/benserazide-treated ones. This lower AIM severity was related to a decrease in L-DOPA-induced increase in the following: (1) striatal pERK1/2 and (2) FosB levels. These results suggest that simvastatin could represent a treatment option for managing LID in PD.",

For example, switching to a different statin, changing statin dosing, using lipid-lowering drugs other than statins (e.g., ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants and fibrates, alone or in combination), or combining statins with other lipid-lowering drugs. The authors focus on the potential mechanisms involved in statin-related myopathy. New lipid-lowering drugs currently in development (e.g., cholesterol ester transfer protein inhibitors [anacetrapib] and proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 inhibitors) inhibitors may help in the management of statin intolerance while achieving low-density lipoprotein cholesterol targets as set out by the guidelines.",

We have been using zebrafish to overcome the limitations of the in vitro approach and to study the sub-cellular structures and processes involved during myogenesis. We use simvastatin--a drug widely used to prevent high levels of cholesterol and cardiovascular disease--during zebrafish skeletal muscle formation. Simvastatin is an efficient inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis that has various myotoxic consequences. Here, we employed simvastatin concentrations that cause either mild or severe morphological disturbances to observe changes in the cytoskeleton (intermediate filaments and microfilaments), extracellular matrix and adhesion markers by confocal microscopy. With low-dose simvastatin treatment, laminin was almost normal, and alpha-actinin was reduced in the myofibrils. With high simvastatin doses, laminin and vinculin were reduced and appeared discontinuous along the septa, with almost no myofibrils, and small amounts of desmin accumulating close to the septa. We also analyzed sub-cellular alterations in the embryos by electron microscopy, and demonstrate changes in embryo and somite size, septa shape, and in myofibril structure. These effects could be reversed by the addition of exogenous cholesterol. These results contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms of action of simvastatin in muscle cells in particular, and in the study of myogenesis in general.",

We compared these CAC-based treatment strategies to a \"treat all\" strategy and to treatment according to the Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) guidelines. Clinical and economic outcomes were modeled over both five- and ten-year time horizons. Outcomes consisted of CHD and CVD events and Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs).

However, no holistic metabolic information of curcumin on hyperlipidemia models has been revealed, which may provide us an insight into the underlying mechanism. In the present work, NMR and MS based metabolomics was conducted to investigate the intervention effect of curcumin on hyperlipidemia mice induced by high-fat diet (HFD) feeding for 12 weeks. The HFD induced animals were orally administered with curcumin (40, 80 mg/kg) or lovastatin (30 mg/kg, positive control) once a day during the inducing period. Serum biochemistry assay of TC, TG, LDL-c, and HDL-c was conducted and proved that treatment of curcumin or lovastatin can significantly improve the lipid profiles. Subsequently, metabolomics analysis was carried out for urine samples. Orthogonal Partial Least Squares-Discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was employed to investigate the anti-hyperlipidemia effect of curcumin and to detect related potential biomarkers. Totally, 35 biomarkers were identified, including 31 by NMR and nine by MS (five by both). It turned out that curcumin treatment can partially recover the metabolism disorders induced by HFD, with the following metabolic pathways involved: TCA cycle, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, synthesis of ketone bodies and cholesterol, ketogenesis of branched chain amino acid, choline metabolism, and fatty acid metabolism. Besides, NMR and MS based metabolomics proved to be powerful tools in investigating pharmacodynamics effect of natural products and underlying mechanisms.",

We aimed to examine the association of statin therapy with diagnoses of inflammatory bowel diseases and noninfectious gastroenteritis. This is a retrospective study using data of a military health care system from October 1, 2003, to March 1, 2012. Based on medication fills during fiscal year 2005, patients were divided into: (1) statin users (received at least 90-day supply of statin) and (2) nonusers (never received a statin). A propensity score-matched cohort of statin users and nonusers was created using 80 variables. Primary analysis examined the risks of being diagnosed with inflammatory bowel diseases and noninfectious gastroenteritis between statin users and nonusers in the propensity score-matched cohort. Secondary analyses examined the risk of outcomes in the whole cohort and in patients with no comorbidities according to Charlson Comorbidity Index. Of 43,438 patients meeting study criteria (13,626 statin users and 29,812 nonusers), we propensity score matched 6,342 statin users with 6,342 nonusers.

In this 24-week, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study (NCT01592240), subjects with LDL-C levels\u226580 mg/dl on stable statin therapy were randomized to Q14 days subcutaneous placebo or bococizumab 50, 100, or 150 mg or Q28 days subcutaneous placebo or bococizumab 200 or 300 mg. Doses of bococizumab were reduced if LDL-C levels persistently decreased to \u226425 mg/dl. The primary end point was the absolute change in LDL-C levels from baseline to week 12 after placebo or bococizumab administration. Continuation of bococizumab administration through to week 24 enabled the collection of safety data over an extended period. Of the 354 subjects randomized, 351 received treatment (placebo [n=100] or bococizumab [n=251]). The most efficacious bococizumab doses were 150 mg Q14 days and 300 mg Q28 days. Compared with placebo, bococizumab 150 mg Q14 days reduced LDL-C at week 12 by 53.4 mg/dl and bococizumab 300 mg Q28 days reduced LDL-C by 44.9 mg/dl; this was despite dose reductions in 32.5% and 34.2% of subjects at week 10 or 8, respectively. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model-based simulation assuming no dose reductions predicted that bococizumab would lower LDL-C levels by 72.2 and 55.4 mg/dl, respectively. Adverse events were similar across placebo and bococizumab groups. Few subjects (n=7; 2%) discontinued treatment because of treatment-related adverse events. In conclusion, bococizumab significantly reduced LDL-C across all doses despite dose reductions in many subjects. Model-based simulations predicted greater LDL-C reduction in the absence of bococizumab dose reduction. The Q14 days regimen is being evaluated in phase 3 clinical trials."
