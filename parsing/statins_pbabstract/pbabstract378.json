    "0": "The pyridine derivative cerivastatin is a new entirely synthetic and enantiomerically pure inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase. As a sodium salt cerivastatin is present in the active, open ring form. Cerivastatin inhibited the membrane-bound (non-solubilized) HMG-CoA reductase of the native microsomal fraction isolated from rat liver with a Ki value of 1.3 x 10(-9) M. The reference compound lovastatin was 100-fold less potent and exhibited a Ki value of 150 x 10(-9) M. Cerivastatin inhibited the cholesterol synthesis in the human hepatoma cell line HepG2 cells with a similar IC50 value of 1.0 x 10(-9) M. In vivo studies reflected its high in vitro activity. In both rats and dogs, cerivastatin inhibited the hepatic [14C]cholesterol synthesis from [14C]acetate with an oral ED50 value of 0.002 mg/kg body weight, while lovastatin exhibited an oral ED50 value of 0.3 mg/kg in rats, showing again the ratio of 100 or more between cerivastatin and lovastatin. In the small intestine and testes, cerivastatin was at least 50-fold less active with oral ED50 values higher than 0.1 mg/kg, which is indicative for a high liver selectivity of cerivastatin. In cholestyramine-primed dogs cerivastatin dose-dependently lowered the serum cholesterol concentrations by up to 59% with 0.1 mg/kg after 20 days. Interestingly, the serum triglycerides were markedly reduced by 53 and 76% with 0.03 and 0.1 mg/kg, respectively. In normal chow fed dogs the low density lipoprotein (LDL) concentrations were reduced by up to 75% after 0.1 mg cerivastatin/kg. The ratio of HDL/LDL increased by 81% compared with a change of only 14% in the placebo treated control group. The antiatherogenic effect of cerivastatin was shown in rabbits fed a diet enriched with 0.2% cholesterol. After 9 weeks on diet 0.1 mg cerivastatin/kg decreased the accumulation of cholesterol ester in the arterial tissue by 73%. In summary, these data as compared to published data on other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors demonstrate cerivastatin to be the most active compound in this class. Vastatins used in therapy are effective in mg doses, while cerivastatin offers a new low dose therapy in the microg range.", 
    "1": "A novel two-base deletion in the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A lyase (HL) gene was found in a Spanish patient with homozygous 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric aciduria. Amplification by RT-PCR of the mRNAs showed that the gene was transcribed into three different mRNAs. One showed the complete deletion of exons 5 and 6 located between nucleotides 348 and 561 of the HL cDNA. The second transcript showed deletion of exon 6 only, and the third contained a two-base deletion CT in exon 6, corresponding to nucleotides 504 and 505 of the HL cDNA. These aberrant mRNAs are predicted to encode three abnormal HMG-CoA lyase proteins; the first (from skipped exons 5 and 6) lacks 71 amino acids, which represents 24% of the mature protein; the second, (from the skipping of exon 6, producing a frameshift) contains only 192 amino acids, the last 26 of which are missense amino acids preceding a stop codon; the third contains only 175 amino acids, the last 7 of which are missense. Northern blot analysis showed that the HL mRNA levels of the patient were 4% of the control. PCR quantitative analysis indicated that the mRNA lacking exons 5 and 6 was the most abundant, representing 88% of the total. The other two mRNAs represented 8% and 4%, respectively. In the genomic DNA only one CT deletion was found at positions +7 and +8 at beginning of exon 6. No mutations were observed in the splice donor, splice acceptor, or pyrimidine-rich sequences of the intronic regions flanking exons 5 and 6. All three aberrant mRNAs resulted only from the deletion of nucleotides CT. We suggest that this deletion may affect the interaction between the small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) and exon 6, and that, as a result, the abnormal splicing of the pre-mRNA produces two different aberrant transcripts.", 
    "2": "Plasma platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) is the enzyme that inactivates PAF (1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine). We determined the relative contributions of genetic and environmental factors to variation in plasma PAF-AH activity in 240 individuals from 60 nuclear families. Regression of mean-offspring PAF-AH activity on the mid-parent value indicated that 62% of the variation in plasma PAF-AH activity was heritable. Spousal values were weakly negatively correlated, indicating that familial aggregation of PAF-AH activity is due to genetic rather than to environmental factors. Among normolipidemic individuals, plasma PAF-AH activity was strongly correlated with the plasma concentration of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and treatment with lovastatin resulted in proportional decreases in plasma PAF-AH activity and LDL-C concentrations. To further elucidate the relationship between PAF-AH and plasma concentrations of LDL, plasma PAF-AH activity was measured in families with well-defined, monogenic disorders of LDL metabolism. Plasma PAF-AH activity cosegregated with plasma LDL-C concentrations in familial hypercholesterolemia, but not in familial hypobetalipoproteinemia. We speculate that the rate of removal of LDL from the circulation may determine the clearance rate of PAF-AH, thereby modulating the activity of PAF-AH in blood.", 
    "3": "Laboratory investigations have demonstrated that blockade of HMG-CoA reductase in vitro reduces lymphocyte proliferation in response to mitogens as well as other facets of the immune system, such as natural killer cell cytotoxicity. However, in this randomized and double-blind clinical investigation, treatment with 20-mg lovastatin for 6 months did not significantly alter several enumerative and functional characteristics of circulating immune cells.", 
    "4": "The results of the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S) and the Cholesterol and Recurrent Events (CARE) study make abundantly clear the benefits of lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in patients with a history of coronary artery disease. Current guidelines in the United States and Germany recommend a treatment goal for LDL cholesterol of 100 mg/dl. However, the evidence for setting such a goal is not consistent among trials. It has even been argued that setting an absolute LDL goal may be unhelpful, per se, because the higher the patient's pretreatment LDL cholesterol, the more difficult achieving this goal becomes. It has also been recognized that measures to lower LDL cholesterol, and medications in particular, produce a relative rather than an absolute degree of reduction in circulating levels. For example, most statins produce a similar proportional decrease in LDL cholesterol irrespective of baseline LDL. Thus, if the baseline LDL is 180 mg/dl, the decrease in LDL with a particular statin dose may be 60 to 120 mg/dl, whereas if the baseline LDL is 120 mg/dl, the expected decrease in LDL with the same statin dose would be only 40 to 80 mg/dl (i.e., a 30% reduction in each case). These points have led some investigators to suggest that it may be more practicable to recommend the amount by which LDL should be lowered rather than by specifying an absolute level of LDL cholesterol which should be achieved. This report summarizes the proceedings of an international symposium held on this topic on October 4, 1996, in Berlin by the International Task Force for Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease and the Institute of Arteriosclerosis Research at the University of M\u00fcnster.", 
    "5": "Exposure of developing rats to a diet containing elemental tellurium systemically inhibits cholesterol synthesis at the level of squalene epoxidase. At high tellurium exposure levels (> 0.1% in the diet), there is an associated segmental demyelination of the PNS. Low levels of dietary tellurium (0.0001%) led to in vivo inhibition of squalene epoxidase activity in sciatic nerve, and inhibition increased with increasing exposure levels. With increasing dose and increasing exposure times, there was an increasing degree of demyelination and increasing down-regulation of mRNA levels for myelin P0 protein, ceramide galactosyltransferase (rate-limiting enzyme in cerebroside synthesis), and HMG-CoA reductase (rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis). Because these were all down-regulated in parallel, we conclude there is coordinate regulation of the entire program for myelin synthesis in Schwann cells. An anomaly was that at early time points and low tellurium levels, mRNA levels for HMG-CoA reductase were slightly elevated, presumably in response to tellurium-induced sterol deficits. We suggest the eventual down-regulation relates to a separate mechanism by which Schwann cells regulate cholesterol synthesis, related to the need for coordinate synthesis of myelin components. Levels of mRNA for the low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor (indicator of alterations in axon-Schwann cell interactions) and for lysozyme (marker for phagocytic macrophages) were both up-regulated in a dose- and time-dependent manner which correlated with the presence of segmental demyelination. Levels of mRNA coding for myelin-related proteins were down-regulated at low tellurium exposure levels, without demyelination or up-regulation of nerve growth factor receptor. This suggests the down-regulation is related to the tellurium-induced cholesterol deficit, and not to the loss of axonal contact associated with early stages of demyelination or to the entry of activated macrophages.", 
    "6": "Apheresis only partially controls raised low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, who usually respond poorly to lipid-lowering drugs. The efficacy and mechanism of action of a new 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, atorvastatin, was therefore investigated in seven homozygotes undergoing apheresis. One receptor-negative and six receptor-defective homozygotes undergoing plasma exchange or LDL apheresis every 2 weeks were studied during 2 months each on placebo and on atorvastatin 80 mg daily. Changes in plasma lipids and mevalonic acid, an index of cholesterol synthesis, were measured and the kinetics of the rebound of low density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein B after apheresis were analyzed. All subjects had significant improvements on atorvastatin. Mean decreases in low density lipoprotein cholesterol were 31% greater both pre- and post-apheresis on atorvastatin compared with placebo, accompanied by a 63% decrease in mevalonic acid. Percentage changes in low density lipoprotein cholesterol and mevalonic acid were closely correlated (r = 0.89, P = 0.007). The mean production rates of low density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein B were 21% and 25% lower, respectively, on atorvastatin than on placebo (P < 0.005 and <0.02) but changes in mean fractional clearance rates were not statistically significant. We conclude that atorvastatin enhances the efficacy of plasma exchange and low density lipoprotein apheresis in patients who lack low density lipoprotein receptors. This effect appears to be due to marked inhibition of cholesterol synthesis which results in a decreased rate of production of low density lipoprotein.", 
    "7": "Recent clinical trials and meta-analyses of beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) have demonstrated a reduction in ischemic stroke in patients with a history of coronary artery disease both with and without elevations of serum cholesterol. This review summarizes clinical trials of these compounds and their recent impact on stroke and explores the underlying vascular mechanisms of their actions.", 
    "8": "Use of statins in patients with vascular disease has been shown to lower the incidence of stroke by approximately 30%. Statins exhibit a number of antiatherosclerotic and antithrombotic properties that likely underlie the recently observed reductions in cerebrovascular disease. Statins reduce inflammatory, proliferative, and thrombogenic processes in plaque, making it less likely to rupture. Additionally, they reverse the endothelial dysfunction and platelet activation accompanying hypercholesterolemia and may reduce the tendency to thrombosis.", 
    "9": "Hypercholesterolemia has reemerged as a risk factor for ischemic stroke. Statins protect against thromboembolic stroke through multiple beneficial effects within the vascular milieu. Further data are awaited to support the growing importance of cholesterol as a risk factor for ischemic stroke and the benefits of statin therapy in patients with cerebrovascular disease.", 
    "10": "Multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease, particularly hypercholesterolemia, are often present in the hypertensive patient. Recent guidelines, ranging from those prepared by the World Health Organization/International Society of Hypertension to those of the three European Societies of Cardiology, Atherosclerosis, and Hypertension, stress the importance of evaluating global risk, based on the presence of all cardiovascular risk factors in an individual or in a group of subjects. It has also been suggested that treatment should aim to correct all modifiable risk factors. This is a reasonable recommendation, but although observational epidemiologic studies have shown that the effects of concomitant risk factors are additive, if not multiplicative, it is surprising that no intervention trial has been undertaken to determine whether the benefits of treating more than one risk factor are also additive. The Plaque Hypertension Lipid-Lowering Italian Study (PHYLLIS) is the first such study. Its aim is to investigate the potential benefit of lowering blood pressure and plasma cholesterol on the progression of carotid plaque in hypertensive patients with elevated plasma cholesterol. Using a factorial design, the antiatherosclerotic effect of two different antihypertensive drugs, the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor fosinopril and the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide will be compared. The study aims to confirm animal experiments demonstrating the benefit of ACE inhibitors on experimental atherosclerosis. PHYLLIS will also compare the effects of two lipid-lowering regimens, diet plus placebo and diet plus pravastatin, in the study population. This 3-year, multicenter, double-blind, randomized Italian study, using B-mode ultrasound evaluation of the carotid walls with central reading of the ultrasound scans (Bowman Gray University, Winston-Salem, NC) is now underway and should provide useful evidence about the benefits of multiple risk factor treatment in the hypertensive patient.",

The delta 7,9(11) moiety was efficiently introduced in three steps in 71% yield by the regioselective abstraction of allylic 8 beta hydrogen. The formyl group of the key intermediate, 3 beta-benzoyloxylanosta-7,9(11)-dien-32-al, has been stereoselectively alkylated into (32S) derivative, whereas its oxidation unexpectedly afforded 3 beta-benzoyloxy-7-oxolanost-8-ene-32,11 alpha-lactone and not the corresponding acid. delta 7,9(11)-lanostadienes possessing HC(32)=O, C(32) [symbol: see text] N, HC(32S)CH3OH, H2C(32)OH, as well as some 11-keto lanostenes, were tested in vitro against several purified cholesterogenic enzymes showing moderate activity, with most the active aldehyde 16 having IC50 = 86 microM.", 
    "12": "Cholesterol ester storage disease (CESD) is a rare congenital disorder of lipid metabolism, with mutation of the lysosomal acid lipase gene, causing chronic liver disease, usually before adolescence. We here describe three adult siblings with CESD diagnosed by light microscopic demonstration of excessive lysosomal storage of lipids with accumulation of foamy cells in liver biopsies and by a decrease in acid lipase activity (2-3% of controls). One patient (male, 46a) had extensive liver fibrosis, another (female, 58a) had cirrhosis of the liver. The third patient had died from variceal haemorrhage (female, 56a). Using sequence analysis of RT-PCR products of LAL mRNA, the patients were identified as compound heterozygotes for a G-->A substitution at position -1 of the exon 8 splice donor site and a point mutation at the second allele, resulting in a His108-->Pro shift. In two patients, therapy with lovastatin was initiated, which led to normalisation of serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels. After 12 months, liver biopsy demonstrated a significant decrease in vacuolisation of hepatocytes, with fewer and smaller droplets. Semi-automated computer-assisted image analysis of electron microscopic sections demonstrated a decrease in the hepatocellular lysosomal area from 20.5+/-7.1% to 11.7+/-6.5% (p<0.05) and 41.7+/-5.1% to 33.4+/-4.4% (p<0.01). We conclude that in two siblings with a novel LAL variant and mild phenotype of CESD, lovastatin decreased both serum lipid concentrations and hepatocellular lysosomal content.",

    "20": "The effects of the administration of vitamin E (10 mg/day) plus lovastatin (2 mg/day; group A, n = 10), lovastatin alone (2 mg/day; group B, n = 10), and placebo (group C, n = 10) were compared over 24 weeks in a randomized, single-blind controlled trial. All groups of rabbits received a trans fatty acid (TFA)-rich diet (5-10 g/day) for 36 weeks. Treatment with vitamin E plus lovastatin (group A) and lovastatin (group B) started after 12 weeks of administration of TFA-rich diet was associated with a significant but similar decline in serum cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and triglycerides in both groups at 36 weeks. Lipid peroxides and diene conjugates showed a significant decline in association with a significant increase in the plasma level of vitamin E in group A rabbits at 36 weeks. However, the lovastatin group B showed a lesser but significant decrease in lipid peroxides and diene conjugates at 36 weeks, indicating that lovastatin may have antioxidant activity. In control group C, the increase in blood lipids and oxidative stress at 36 weeks was much greater than the decrease in groups A and B. After experimental lipid peroxidation at 24 weeks in all of the rabbits, 2 of 10 group B and 3 of 10 group C rabbits died due to coronary thrombosis; there were no deaths in group A. Thus antioxidant therapy with vitamin E can provide protection against death due to free radical stress. Aortic lipids and sudanophilia indicating athorosclorosis were significantly lower in groups A and B than in group C. The atherosclerotic coronary plaque sizes were significantly smaller in group A (18.5 +/- 3.6 microns) than in groups B (41.6 +/- 4.2 microns) and C (85 +/- 6.7 microns). Aortic plaque sizes were also smaller in group A than in group B and C. It is possible that antioxidant therapy with vitamin E, as an adjunct to lipid lowering with lovastatin, can provide additional benefit in the inhibition of oxidative stress and atherosclerosis. The antioxidant activity of lovastatin has not been reported, to our knowledge.", 
    "21": "The effects of cerivastatin sodium (BAY w 6228), a new type of inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, on plasma cholesterol concentrations and the induction of hepatic LDL receptors were investigated with beagle dogs and Hep G2 cells. Oral administration of cerivastatin (0.01, 0.03, and 0.1 mg/kg per day) for 3 weeks reduced plasma total and very low-density lipoprotein plus low-density lipoprotein (VLDL + LDL) cholesterol concentrations and increased hepatic LDL receptor binding activity in dogs. Scatchard plot analysis revealed a 1.9-fold increase in the maximum binding capacity of hepatic LDL receptors in cerivastatin-treated animals. Similar results were obtained by administration of pravastatin (1.0 and 5.0 mg/kg/day) for 3 weeks. Binding activity of the LDL receptor, as well as receptor mRNA and protein concentrations, were increased in a dose-dependent manner (0.01-1.0 microM) by exposure of Hep G2 cells to cerivastatin. The results suggest that cerivastatin reduces plasma cholesterol concentrations by increasing hepatic LDL receptor expression. The mechanism of lowering cholesterol concentration by cerivastatin was the same as with the other previously examined HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, but the effects with cerivastatin were apparent at doses much lower than the effective doses of the other drugs. Cerivastatin, therefore, shows potential for clinical use as a potent and efficacious plasma cholesterol-lowering drug.",

The frequency of the homozygous (+/+) mutation was 9.5% among patients versus 8.5% among control subjects, resulting in an odds ratio of 1.21 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.87 to 1.68), relative to the (-/-) genotype.

For a summary estimation of the risk of the (+/+) genotype for CAD, we performed a meta-analysis on 8 different case-control studies on thermolabile MTHFR in CAD. In the meta-analysis, the homozygous (+/+) genotype was present in 299 of 2476 patients (12.1%) and in 257 (10.4%) of 2481 control subjects, resulting in a significant odds ratio of 1.22 (95% CI, 1.01 to 1.47) relative to the (-/-) genotype.",

    "25": "The observation that relatively short periods of cholesterol lowering therapy can reduce the incidence of coronary artery disease events has prompted interest in the short term effects of lipoproteins on cardiovascular responsiveness. Numerous studies in animals and humans have demonstrated that oxidized LDL-cholesterol can impair endothelial dependent vasodilation in coronary arteries and peripheral resistance vessels. Reduction of plasma LDL-cholesterol levels in hypercholesterolaemic patients improves nitric oxide mediated vasodilator responses in the coronary and peripheral circulation. LDL-cholesterol also potentiates responses to vasoconstrictors such as noradrenaline and endothelin-1 in the absence of endothelium, possibly by enhancing calcium influx into vascular smooth muscle cells. Pharmacological reduction of plasma LDL-cholesterol levels has been shown to reduce blood pressure responses to intravenous infusions of pressor hormones and to stress. However, the relative contribution of changes in endothelial dependent vasodilation and vasoconstrictor or inotropic responses remains to be established. Short term changes in LDL-cholesterol produce changes in cardiovascular responsiveness that may influence the development of ischaemic events.", 
    "26": "The Rho GTPases are involved in actin cytoskeleton organization and signal transduction. They need polyisoprenylation for membrane association and activation. Lovastatin, a hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A inhibitor, prevents isoprene synthesis and thereby lipid modification of the Rho protein carboxy terminus. Because lovastatin causes rounding up of cultured cells, we investigated whether the compound acts on the actin cytoskeleton through Rho proteins. Lovastatin treatment decreased F-actin content in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. G-actin content remained unchanged. In lovastatin-treated NIH 3T3 cells, the amount of Rho protein which was ADP-ribosylated by Clostridium botulinum exoenzyme C3 decreased in membranes and increased in the cytosol fraction. Cycloheximide prevented lovastatin-induced rounding up of cells. However, after microinjection or direct application of exoenzyme C3, cells treated with cycloheximide and lovastatin rounded up again. On the contrary, lovastatin-treated, round Swiss 3T3 cells reverted to a flat morphology when microinjected with dominant active RhoA (Val14RhoA). Escherichia coli cytotoxic necrotizing factor (CNF1) which activates Rho proteins caused flattening of round, lovastatin-treated NIH 3T3 cells. These results suggest that lovastatin affects the actin cytoskeleton through inactivation of Rho proteins.", 
    "27": "The effect of lovastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity, on the kinetics of de novo cholesterol synthesis and apolipoprotein (apo) B in very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was investigated in five male patients with combined hyperlipidemia. Subjects were counseled to follow a Step 2 diet and were treated with lovastatin and placebo in randomly assigned order for 6-week periods. At the end of each experimental period, subjects were given deuterium oxide orally and de novo cholesterol synthesis was assessed from deuterium incorporation into cholesterol and expressed as fractional synthesis rate (C-FSR) and production rate (C-PR). Simultaneously, the kinetics of VLDL, IDL, and LDL apo B-100 were studied in the fed state using a primed-constant infusion of deuterated leucine to measure fractional catabolic rates (FCR) and production rates (PR). Drug treatment resulted in significant decreases in total cholesterol (-29%), VLDL cholesterol (-40%), LDL cholesterol (-27%), and apo B (-16%) levels and increases in HDL cholesterol (+13%) and apolipoprotein (apo) A-I (+11%) levels. Associated with these plasma lipoprotein responses was a significant reduction in both de novo C-FSR (-40%; P = .04) and C-PR (-42%; P = .03). Treatment with lovastain in these patients had no significant effect on the FCR of apoB-100 in VLDL, IDL, or LDL, but resulted in a significant decrease in the PR of apoB-100 in IDL and LDL. Comparing the kinetic data of these patients with those of 10 normolipidemic control subjects indicates that lovastatin treatment normalized apoB-100 IDL and LDL PR. The results of these studies suggest that the declines in plasma lipid levels observed after treatment of combined hyperlipidemic patients with lovastatin are attributable to reductions in the C-FSR and C-PR of de novo cholesterol synthesis and the PR of apoB-100 containing lipoproteins. The decline in de novo cholesterol synthesis, rather than an increase in direct uptake of VLDL and IDL, may have contributed to the decline in the PR observed.",

    "35": "The integrin heterodimer CD11b/CD18 expressed on monocytes interacts with intercellular adhesion molecule-1 on endothelium and is involved in monocyte adhesion to endothelium. Treatment of monocytes with lovastatin in vitro slightly and dose dependently reduced surface expression of CD11b on monocytes. Moreover, lovastatin inhibited CD11b-dependent adhesiveness to fixed endothelium of unstimulated monocytes or monocytes stimulated with monocyte chemotactic protein 1. Coincubation with mevalonate, but not with low density lipoprotein (LDL), reversed the effects of lovastatin, suggesting that early cholesterol precursors, but not cholesterol, are crucial for adhesiveness of CD11b. In hypercholesterolemic patients, adhesion of isolated monocytes to endothelium ex vivo was dramatically increased over values in healthy control subjects. Treatment of these patients with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors lovastatin or simvastatin (20 to 40 mg/day) for 6 weeks slightly decreased total and LDL cholesterol plasma levels and monocyte CD11b surface expression but resulted in a significant reduction of monocyte adhesion to endothelium (p < 0.01, n = 7).",

    "37": "Accelerated coronary artery disease is the most serious obstacle to long-term survival in heart transplant recipients. Hyperlipemia, hyperinsulinism, and changes in endothelial cell hemostatic function have been implicated in cardiac allograft vascular disease. Both lovastatin and bezafibrate are safe, effective, and well tolerated therapies for hyperlipidemia. Our study compares the effect of these lipid-lowering drugs in 21 patients with post-heart transplantation hyperlipidemia on different risk factors related to insulin resistance syndrome. Patients were given the same diet for 3 months, then randomized to lovastatin or bezafibrate for a period of 8 weeks, and crossed over to an additional 8 weeks of either bezafibrate or lovastatin. Baseline parameters were also compared with those of a control group of healthy subjects and after both periods of pharmacologic treatment. Transplant patients had higher insulin (35 +/- 3 vs 24 +/- 3 microIU/L), fibrinogen (298 +/- 15 vs 261 +/- 14 mg/dl), and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) (17 +/- 2 vs 11.7 +/- 2 arbitrary units/ml) plasma levels than controls. Significant decreases in insulin (-37 +/- 3%), fibrinogen (-12 +/- 4%), and PAI-1 plasma levels (-18 +/- 12%) were only observed after bezafibrate treatment. In conclusion, bezafibrate decreases plasma insulin, fibrinogen, and PAI-1 in hyperlipidemic heart transplant recipients.", 
    "38": "The biosynthesis of cholesterol is regulated mainly by HMG-CoA reductase, however, recent studies indicated the pivotal role of another enzyme in cholesterol homeostasis. A previous report showed a marked decrease in the activity of mevalonate pyrophosphate decarboxylase (MPD) in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats and its possible involvement in the pathogenesis of the disorder. In this study, we purified liver MPD from rats fed a diet containing cholestyramine and pravastatin (CP diet) using conventional chromatographic techniques. We obtained two electrophoretically homogeneous enzyme preparations; 45 and 37 kDa proteins with specific activities of 8.0 and 7.4 micromol/min/mg, respectively. The enzymes showed similar molecular weights of 90 kDa, as judged on gel permeation chromatography. A kinetic study indicated apparent Km values for mevalonate pyrophosphate and ATP of 22.7 microM and 0.71 mM, respectively, for the 45 kDa MPD, and 20.0 microM and 0.80 mM, respectively, for the 37 kDa MPD. Half maximum activities were observed at 1.5 mM and 1.1 mM Mg2+ for the 45 and 37 kDa MPDs, respectively. Both enzymes required ATP as a phosphate acceptor, and in addition Mg2+, Mn2+, and Co2+ were effective as divalent cations. The optimum pH for both enzymes was 7.0. The isoelectric points for the 45 and 37 kDa MPDs were 5.6 and 5.4, respectively. Polyclonal antiserum raised against the 45 kDa enzyme detected both the 45 and 37 kDa bands on immunoblots with CP diet-induced liver crude extract as an antigen. However, non-induced liver contained the 45 kDa protein but not the 37 kDa protein. These results indicated that the CP diet induced a new species, 37 kDa, of MPD which is characteristically and immunologically very similar to the well-known 45 kDa MPD.", 
    "39": "Proliferation of tubular epithelial cells underlies the development of cystic lesions and the subsequent impairment of renal function after renal mass reduction. The effect of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (HRI) on cell proliferation was investigated in rat renal proximal tubular epithelial cells in primary culture. Treatment of renal tubular epithelial cells with three different HRI reduced fetal calf serum (FCS)-induced [3H]-thymidine incorporation (IC50 values were 0.7 microM, 1.7 microM, and 1.6 microM for simvastatin, lovastatin, and compactin, respectively), and lovastatin blocked BrdUrd incorporation, as assessed by immunocytochemical studies. The proliferative effect of epidermal growth factor (EGF) was similarly abolished by lovastatin. The effect of lovastatin (1 microM) was prevented by 100 microM mevalonate, 5 microM farnesyl-pyrophosphate and 5 microM geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate (in percent of control value, 31% vs. 102%, 60%, and 82%, respectively) while cholesterol and other products of the mevalonate pathway were inactive. Immunoblot analysis showed that lovastatin decreased membrane-bound p21ras and inhibited FCS-induced c-fos and c-jun protein expression. Furthermore, electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated the functional impairement of AP-1 DNA binding activity in lovastatin-treated cells. In conclusion, these results demonstrate that HRI are antiproliferative in epithelial tubule cells and that this effect is exerted, at least in part, via inhibition of the p21ras-activated and AP-1 dependent mitogenic cascade.", 
    "40": "Renal cyst formation in polycystic diseases or after nephron reduction is attributed to enhanced tubular cell proliferation with unbalanced cell death. The induction of tubular cell death could be effective to reduce renal cyst formation. In this study, we examined the effects of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors on apoptosis in mouse proximal tubular (MPT) cells in primary culture. After treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, the extracted DNA was analyzed by gel-electrophoresis under ultraviolet light. Apoptosis was evaluated quantitatively by estimating the ratio of fragmented DNA over intact DNA. For morphologic studies, cells were stained with Hoechst 33,258. DNA ladder pattern of 200 kDa typical of apoptosis and significant increase in DNA fragmentation were seen after 24 hours of treatment with lovastatin, a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor. Staining with the Hoechst dye revealed cleavage of nucleus into pieces under the same condition. Geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (20 microM) and mevalonate (500 microM) completely reversed the effect of lovastatin, while farnesylpyrophosphate (20 microM) partially reversed it. Other products of HMG-CoA pathway such as cholesterol, ubiquinone, dolichol, and isopentenyladenine had no effect. Perillic acid and alpha-hydoxyfarnesylphosphonic acid, isoprenylation inhibitors, induced apoptosis of the cells. A treatment with lovastatin caused actin filament disruption. Cytochalasin D, an inhibitor of actin polymerization, induced apoptosis. Interleukin-1 beta-converting enzyme inhibitor II, a protease inhibitor, had no effect on the apoptosis induced by either HRI or cytochalasin D. The present study suggests that in mouse proximal tubules, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors induce apoptosis via inhibition of isoprenoid production, and disruption of actin filaments may play a role in the apoptosis induction.", 
    "41": "Pregnant Wistar-MS rats received whole body irradiation with 2.6 Gy gamma-rays from a 60Co source at day 20 of pregnancy. Control rats were fed a basal diet and were implanted with a diethylstilbestrol (DES) pellet at 30 days after weaning. In the experimental group, rats were fed a diet containing simvastatin immediately after weaning and received a DES pellet at 30 days after weaning. A high incidence of total mammary tumours was observed in the rats fed the control diet and treated with DES for 1 year. The administration of dietary simvastatin together with DES treatment significantly decreased the incidence of mammary tumours. The development of adenocarcinoma in the control rats was significantly higher than that in the rats fed the simvastatin diet. After the administration of simvastatin to the experimental group for 1 year, the serum estradiol-17beta concentration in these rats was markedly reduced, but that of prolactin was not. No significant difference was seen in the development of the mammary glands between rats fed the control diet and those fed the simvastatin diet by whole mount observations. Simvastatin feeding produced an increased development of ER- PgR- tumours and a reduced incidence of ER+ PgR+ tumours. These findings suggest that simvastatin has a potent preventive activity during the DES-dependent promotion/progression phase of radiation-induced mammary tumorigenesis.", 
    "42": "This 24-week, randomized, open-label multicenter study evaluated the efficacy and safety of atorvastatin compared with fenofibrate in the treatment of patients with combined hyperlipidemia (CHL). Following a 6-week baseline period, 84 patients with CHL were randomly assigned to either atorvastatin treatment, 10 mg QD for 12 weeks increasing to 20 mg QD for 12 weeks, or fenofibrate treatment, 100 mg TID for 24 weeks. Changes from baseline in lipid parameters were evaluated at weeks 12 and 24. At both 10- and 20-mg doses, atorvastatin treatment resulted in significantly greater reductions in LDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein (apo) B, total cholesterol, LDL-apoB, and lipoprotein-B compared to 300-mg fenofibrate treatment (P < .05). While atorvastatin also resulted in clinically significant reductions in triglyceride, VLDL cholesterol, apoB in VLDL, triglyceride in VLDL, and apoC-III and significant increases in HDL cholesterol and apoA-I levels, fenofibrate was more effective than atorvastatin in altering all these parameters. However, by significantly affecting both the cholesterol-rich and triglyceride-rich particles, atorvastatin holds promise as a lipid-regulator able to adequately treat a broad range of patients that includes those with CHL.",

    "44": "The effects of lovastatin on lens transparency and on lens epithelial cell proliferation and structure have been investigated using organ-cultured rat lenses and cultured epithelial cells from human and rabbit lenses, respectively. Lens histologic and morphologic changes were recorded microscopically. Small GTP-binding protein profiles were determined by [alpha-32P] GTP overlay assays.", 
    "45": "Rat lenses organ cultured for 7 days with lovastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitor, developed frank subcapsular opacity. Lens epithelial cells (both human and rabbit) demonstrated extensive morphologic changes and inhibition of proliferation when treated with lovastatin. Histologic sections of lovastatin-treated lenses showed partial to complete degeneration of the central epithelium, distortion of elongating epithelial cells, and extensive vacuole formation in the equatorial regions of the cortex. Supplementation of the medium with DL-mevalonic acid (a precursor of isoprenoids whose synthesis is inhibited by lovastatin) prevented the lovastatin-induced changes in whole lenses or in lens epithelial cell cultures, whereas supplementation with cholesterol had no such effect. GTP-binding proteins accumulated in the soluble fractions of lovastatin-treated lens epithelial cells. This was consistent with a blockade in isoprenylation preventing normal association with membranes.", 
    "46": "The findings suggest that impairment of the function of small GTP-binding proteins, due to a lovastatin-induced blockade in their isoprenylation, affects lens cell structure and proliferation in tissue culture and induces lens opacity in organ culture. These findings are consistent with the proposed roles of small GTP-binding proteins as molecular switches that regulate fundamental cellular processes, including growth, differentiation, and maintenance of cell structure.", 
    "47": "Recently we have shown that in fibroblasts (NIH 3T3 and Rat-1 cells) inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation leads to a G0/G1 arrest, whereas inhibition of protein farnesylation does not affect cell cycle distribution. Here we demonstrate that in human tumor cells the geranylgeranyltransferase-I (GGTase-I) inhibitor GGTI-298 blocked cells in G0/G1, whereas the farnesyltransferase (FTase) inhibitor FTI-277 showed a differential effect depending on the cell line. FTI-277 accumulated Calu-1 and A-549 lung carcinoma and Colo 357 pancreatic carcinoma cells in G2/M, T-24 bladder carcinoma, and HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells in G0/G1, but had no effect on cell cycle distribution of pancreatic (Panc-1), breast (SKBr 3 and MDAMB-231), and head and neck (A-253) carcinoma cells. Furthermore, treatment of Calu-1, Panc-1, Colo 357, T-24, A-253, SKBr 3, and MDAMB-231 cells with GGTI-298, but not FTI-277, induced the protein expression levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF. HT-1080 and A-549 cells had a high basal level of p21WAF, and GGTI-298 did not further increase these levels. Furthermore, GGTI-298 also induces the accumulation of large amounts of p21WAF mRNA in Calu-1 cells, a cell line that lacks the tumor suppressor gene p53. There was little effect of GGTI-298 on the cellular levels of another cyclin- dependent kinase inhibitor p27KIP as well as cyclin E and cyclin D1. These results demonstrate that GGTase-I inhibitors arrest cells in G0/G1 and induce accumulation of p21WAF in a p53-independent manner and that FTase inhibitors can interfere with cell cycle events by a mechanism that involves neither p21WAF nor p27KIP. The results also point to the potential of GGTase-I inhibitors as agents capable of restoring growth arrest in cells lacking functional p53.", 
    "48": "Micronised fenofibrate is a new formulation of the fibric acid derivative fenofibrate. It is indicated for the treatment of patients with type IIa, IIb, III or IV dyslipidaemia who have failed to respond to dietary control or other nonpharmacological interventions. Micronised fenofibrate has improved absorption characteristics compared with the standard preparation, allowing a lower daily dosage and once-daily administration. The lipid-modifying profile of micronised fenofibrate is characterised by a decrease in low density lipoprotein (LDL) and total cholesterol levels, a marked reduction in elevated plasma triglyceride levels and an increase in high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. Consistent with the standard formulation, which is administered as 300mg daily in divided doses, the micronised preparation has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of type IIa, IIb and IV primary dyslipidaemias but at a lower daily dosage of 200mg once daily. Because of its significant triglyceride-lowering effect, micronised fenofibrate appears to be of greatest benefit in patients with hypertriglyceridaemia (with or without hypercholesterolaemia), including patients with type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus and dyslipidaemia. In the comparisons available, micronised fenofibrate 200mg once daily was of similar efficacy to or less effective than the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors simvastatin 20mg daily and pravastatin 20mg daily at reducing LDL and total cholesterol levels. However micronised fenofibrate produced greater improvements in triglyceride and, generally, HDL cholesterol levels than both simvastatin and pravastatin. Data on the long term tolerability of micronised fenofibrate are limited. However, data from a large short term (3-month) study have indicated that gastrointestinal disorders are the most frequent adverse events associated with therapy. Elevations in serum transaminase and creatine phosphokinase levels have been reported rarely with micronised fenofibrate. In conclusion, available data suggest that the more convenient lower once-daily dosage of micronisedfeno fibrate retains the beneficial lipid-modifying effects of the standard formulation. Further studies are required to determine whether the lipid changes achieved with micronised fenofibrate result in a reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.",

    "54": "The present study evaluated the effects of lovastatin on renal function and the development of hypertension in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). Four-week-old SHR were given lovastatin (10 mg/kg) or vehicle twice daily by gavage. After 4 weeks of treatment, mean arterial pressure was significantly lower in lovastatin-treated SHR (131 +/- 4 mm Hg, n=5) than in control animals (160 +/- 4 mm Hg, n=12) (P<.05). The fall in arterial pressure in lovastatin-treated rats was accompanied by changes in renal function. The slope of the relationship between arterial pressure and sodium excretion was threefold greater in lovastatin-treated SHR (n=6) than in control rats (n=6), and this was associated with significant elevations in renal medullary blood flow and renal interstitial hydrostatic pressure. Glomerular filtration rate was 17% higher in lovastatin-treated SHR (n=6) than in control rats (n=6) (0.94 +/- 0.05 versus 0.81 +/- 0.07 mL/min per g of kidney weight, P<.05). The wall-to-lumen area ratio of renal arterioles was significantly reduced in lovastatin-treated SHR compared with vehicle-treated rats (0.86 +/- 0.05 versus 1.08 +/- 0.04 for vessels with inner diameters <50 microm and 0.62 +/- 0.02 versus 0.75 +/- 0.04 for vessels with inner diameters of 50 to 100 microm, P<.05). These results indicate that chronic treatment with lovastatin shifts the relations between renal medullary blood flow, renal interstitial pressure, sodium excretion, and renal perfusion pressure to lower levels of arterial pressure and attenuates the development of hypertension and renal vascular hypertrophy in SHR.",

The median AUC(0-24) of lovastatin was 243 microg x hr/L (105 to 858 microg x hr/L) on day 1 and 459 microg x hr/L (140 to 1508 microg x hr/L) on day 28. Besides a significant accumulation during the study period (p < 0.001), the lovastatin AUC(0-24) values were twentyfold higher than values reported without cyclosporine. Coadministration of pravastatin or lovastatin did not alter cyclosporine pharmacokinetics. In this study, 20 mg/day doses of both drugs resulted in a significant improvement of the lipid profile and were well tolerated.",

    "59": "This study tested the hypothesis that exercise in combination with a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor produces greater creatine kinase (CK) elevations, an index of skeletal muscle injury, than exercise alone, using a double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Fifty-nine healthy men aged 18 to 65 years with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels greater than 3.36 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) despite diet therapy were studied. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive lovastatin (40 mg/d) or placebo for 5 weeks. Subjects completed 45 minutes of downhill treadmill walking (-15% grade) at 65% of their predetermined maximum heart rate after 4 weeks of treatment. During the subsequent week, they completed four 10-repetition sets of one-arm biceps curl exercise using 50% of their maximum capacity. CK levels were measured before exercise and daily for 4 and 5 days after the treadmill and biceps exercises, respectively. Age, body weight, and blood lipid and lipoprotein levels were similar in lovastatin and placebo groups. Resting CK levels were 33% higher in the lovastatin group before treatment (P < .05), but were not significantly altered by lovastatin. CK levels were 62% and 77% higher (P < .05) in the lovastatin group 24 and 48 hours after treadmill exercise after adjusting for initial CK differences. There were no significant CK differences between lovastatin and placebo groups after biceps curl exercise. We conclude that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors exacerbate exercise-induced skeletal muscle injury.", 
    "60": "Simvastatin (SV) is a lactone prodrug used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Upon incubation of SV with liver microsomal preparations from human donors, four major metabolic products were formed (3'-hydroxy SV, 6'-exomethylene SV, 3',5'-dihydrodiol SV, and the active hydroxy acid, SVA), together with several minor unidentified metabolites. The 3',5'-dihydrodiol SV, a new metabolite, was inactive as an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase. Kinetic studies of SV metabolism in human liver microsomes suggested that the major NADPH-dependent metabolites (3'-hydroxy SV, 6'-exomethylene SV, and 3',5'-dihydrodiol SV) were formed with relatively high intrinsic clearances, consistent with the extensive metabolism of SV observed in vivo. Based on four different in vitro approaches, namely 1) correlation analysis, 2) chemical inhibition, 3) immunoinhibition, and 4) metabolism by recombinant human P450, it is concluded that CYP3A is the major enzyme subfamily responsible for the metabolism of SV by human liver microsomes. Both CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 were capable of catalyzing the formation of 3',5'-dihydrodiol, 3'-hydroxy, and 6'-exomethylene metabolites. However, CYP3A4 exhibited higher affinity (> 3 fold) for SV than CYP3A5. Also, the studies indicated that CYP2D6, CYP2A6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP1A2, and CYP2E1 did not play significant roles in the metabolism of SV in vitro. Over the concentration range of 0-40 microM, SV inhibited the activity of CYP3A, but not the activities of CYP2C8/9, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6 in human liver microsomes. The inhibition of hepatic midazolam 1'-hydroxylase, a CYP3A marker activity, by SV was competitive with a Ki value of approximately 10 microM. SV was > 30-fold less potent than ketoconazole and itraconazole as an inhibitor of CYP3A. Under the same conditions, SVA, the hydrophilic hydroxy acid form of SV, did not inhibit CYP3A, CYP2C8/9, CYP2C19, or CYP2D6 activities. The results suggested that the in vivo inhibitory effects of SV on the metabolism of CYP3A substrates likely would be less than those of ketoconazole and itraconazole at their respective therapeutic concentrations. In addition, metabolic activities mediated by the other P450 enzymes tested are unlikely to be affected by SV.", 
    "61": "The biliary excretion of pravastatin in normal rats and Eisai hyperbiliruminemic rats (EHBRs) was examined in vivo and in vitro using bile canalicular membrane vesicles (CMVs). In vivo, the total body clearances at steady-state (CLtot) for both rat strains decreased as the infusion rate increased. At the lowest infusion rate, CLtot for normal rats was 1.6 times higher than that for EHBRs. Under this set of conditions, the biliary excretion clearance (CLbile), defined as the biliary excretion rate at steady-state divided by the concentration in the liver (Cliver), for normal rats was 3-fold higher than that for EHBRs. The CLbile fell markedly with increasing Cliver for normal rats and the Michaelis constant (KM) for Cliver was 180 microM; in contrast, the degree of saturation was slight if any in EHBRs. In vitro, the uptake of pravastatin by CMVs prepared from normal rats exhibited clear ATP-dependence, whereas only a minimal effect of ATP was observed on the uptake by CMVs from EHBRs. Transport kinetic studies were performed over a wide range of pravastatin concentration (0.2-10,000 microM) with a tracer tritium-labeled pravastatin. Saturation was observed both in the ATP-dependent (KM: 220 microM) and ATP-independent (KM: 480 microM) uptake by CMVs prepared from normal rats. ATP-dependent uptake of 2, 4-dinitrophenyl glutathione, a typical substrate for the canalicular multispecific organic anion transporter (cMOAT), was inhibited by pravastatin in a concentration-dependent manner and the resultant inhibitory constant of pravastatin (170 microM) was comparable with the KM value of ATP-dependent pravastatin uptake itself. In conclusion, biliary excretion of pravastatin is mediated mainly by cMOAT in normal rats. This can explain the decrease in the biliary excretion of pravastatin in EHBRs.", 
    "62": "The p21ras protein has been shown to be active in many growth factor signaling systems, including that of prolactin (PRL). In our studies, the main objective was to examine further the involvement of ras in prolactin-stimulated mitogenic and metabolic processes. We used the farnesylation inhibitor lovastatin to block effectively ras-dependent signaling in Nb2 cells, a pre-T lymphoma cell line, and mammary gland explants derived from 12- to 14-day pregnant mice. Lovastatin completely inhibited PRL-induced Nb2 cell mitogenesis at 1 micron. In the mammary gland, lovastatin at 0.1 micron inhibited the PRL stimulation of lipid and lactose synthesis; at 2 microns, lovastatin abolished the PRL stimulation of casein production. When p21ras was immunoprecipitated from lovastatin (25 microns)-treated Nb2 cells and mammary gland explants, the unfarnesylated (inactive) form of ras was shown to be redistributed from the cell membrane to the cytosolic compartment of the cell. This suggests that the anchoring of ras to the cell membrane is essential for its action in prolactin signal transduction. Thus, in addition to the well-known active participation of ras in mitogenic growth factor signaling, the presence of functional ras also appears necessary for the PRL stimulation of specific metabolic processes involved in lactation.",

All patients received aspirin (100 mg/day). The primary angiographic end point was minimal lumen diameter (MLD) at follow-up, assessed by quantitative coronary angiography. A sample size of 313 patients per group was required to demonstrate a difference of 0.13 mm in MLD between groups (allowing for a two-tailed alpha error of 0.05 and a beta error of 0.20). To allow for incomplete angiographic follow-up (estimated lost to follow-up rate of 10%), 690 randomized patients were required.

Simvastatin significantly decreased the plasma concentrations of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 36%, triglycerides by 26%, mevalonic acid by 34%, and lathosterol by 32%. Hepatic secretion of VLDL apoB was measured using a primed constant intravenous infusion of [1-13C]leucine with monitoring of isotopic enrichment of apoB by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; fractional turnover rate was derived using a monoexponential function. Simvastatin decreased VLDL apoB pool size by 53% and the hepatic secretion rate of VLDL apoB by 46% but did not significantly alter its fractional catabolism. The change in hepatic VLDL apoB secretion was significantly and independently correlated with changes in plasma mevalonic acid and lathosterol concentrations and the lathosterol-to-cholesterol ratio. The data support the hypothesis that the rate of de novo cholesterol synthesis directly regulates the hepatic secretion of VLDL apoB in normal subjects.",

The aim of the treatment was to maintain post-transplantation LDL-cholesterol levels at <120 mg/dL. Seventy-two heart transplant recipients receiving standard triple immunosuppression were randomly assigned to an active-treatment group (low-cholesterol diet and simvastatin, n=35) or a control group (general dietary measures, n=37). In the course of 4 years after transplantation, the simvastatin group had significantly lower LDL-cholesterol concentrations than the control group (mean+/-SD, 115+/-14 versus 156+/-17 mg/dL,P=.002), a significantly better long-term survival (88.6% versus 70.3%,P=.05), and a lower incidence of GVD in the coronary angiographic findings (16.6% versus 42.3%,P=.045). The incidence of graft rejections did not differ between the two groups, although there was a tendency toward a lower number of serious rejections in the simvastatin group (2.8% versus 13.5%, P=.1). Intracoronary ultrasound performed after 4 years in a subgroup of 27 patients (simvastatin, 10; control, 17) showed less intimal thickening in patients with LDL-cholesterol levels of <110 mg/dL (170+/-84 versus 370+/-171 microm, P=.04) and a lower intimal index (13.8+/-7.1% versus 27.9+/-12.1%,P=.04).",

It is planned to run for at least five years with 9014 patients from 85 centers in Australia and New Zealand. The trial will monitor cause-specific mortality and major clinical events associated with each treatment. Running in parallel with the main study is a prospective economic analysis, the objectives of which are (1) to estimate the effectiveness of pravastatin compared with placebo in terms of survival, quality of life (QOL), and quality-adjusted life-years (QALY); (2) to estimate the resource usage associated with pravastatin compared with placebo-in particular, to study whether it alters resource usage through prevention of disease progression; and (3) to use this information for a cost-utility analysis with cost per quality-adjusted life-year as the unit of analysis. A novel aspect of the design is the use of a preliminary cost-effectiveness analysis, based on \"best-guess\" values, and a sensitivity analysis over plausible ranges to guide the choice of subsample size. Some data, such a mortality, days spent in hospital, major clinical events, and drug use, are being collected within the main LIPID trial. However, additional subsamples for the cost-effectiveness study will include information on quality of life, time off work, and resources used, such as time in hospital, procedures, and medications taken.

The average annual amount spent on these patients was calculated for eight cardiovascular drug groups defined in the British National Formulary (BNF), hospitalizations for ischaemic heart disease, and revascularization and angiography procedures. The proportion of the study population with the potential to benefit from treatment with statins was then determined by identifying individuals with the characteristics of participants who benefited in any one of three published clinical trials. Identification of these individuals was assisted by the use of population-specific morbidity data and serum cholesterol levels reported in published surveys.", 
    "77": "The actual average annual expenditure on statins (pound 774 per 1000 patients registered) was lower than that on ACE inhibitors, beta-adrenoceptor blockers, calcium channel blockers, diuretics and nitrates and was less than one-tenth of the combined annual cost of all coronary hospitalizations examined. In the patient population studied it was estimated that 7547 (1.7%) individuals would be eligible for secondary prevention with statins whilst 20406 (4.5%) would be eligible for primary prevention. After adjusting for possible non-adherence, the estimated annual cost of statin treatment for all such individuals was calculated to be between pound 22 599 and pound 28 413 per 1000 of the study population. Application of these figures to the registered population of the health authority would add approximately pound 11.8 million to a pound 60 million primary and secondary care drugs budget. It is proposed that statin treatment will have to be prioritized for those at highest risk, whilst maintaining a population-based strategy of promoting lifestyle advice to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.",

Here we also show that SR-12813 inhibits cholesterol biosynthesis in vivo. A sterol balance study was performed in normolipemic beagle dogs. The dogs were given SR-12813 orally at dosages of 10 and 25 mg/kg/day for a period of 9 days. After 7 days plasma cholesterol was decreased by 15% in the 10 mg/kg/day group and by 19% in the 25 mg/kg/day group. Using a dual isotope technique no effects on intestinal cholesterol absorption were observed. The sterol balance indicated that endogenous synthesis of cholesterol was reduced by 23% in the 10 mg/kg/day group and by 37% in the 25 mg/kg/day group. Plasma lathosterol-cholesterol levels in dogs treated with 25 mg/kg/day SR-12813 were reduced by 56%, confirming a reduction of the cholesterol biosynthesis. Treatment with SR-12813 or the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin resulted in a large decrease in low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. It is concluded that SR-12813 reduces cholesterol biosynthesis in the dog model which results in a decrease of bile acid excretion, cholesterol excretion and plasma cholesterol level. The in vivo profile of SR-12813 is very similar to that of direct HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, although the mode of action of the compound is unique.", 
    "79": "No monotherapy is able to tackle effectively all atherogenic features of familial combined hyperlipidemia: high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides (TG), and plasma fibrinogen, as well as low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. The present study investigated the safety and efficacy of combined pravastotin or simvastatin with gemfibrozil or ciprofibrate treatment on total cholesterol, LDL, TG, plasma fibrinogen, and apoproteins B and A-I in patients with refractory familial combined hyperlipidemia, with or without coronary artery disease. From the initial 420 patients included in the study, 389 (294 men and 95 women, mean age 51 years [range 30 to 65]) completed the study. These patients were followed for a mean period of 29 months (1 year [n = 107], 2 years [n = 102], 3 years [n = 95], and 4 years [n = 85]). Patients given a hypolipidemic diet were randomly assigned to pravastatin + gemfibrozil (n = 135, 20 and 1,200 mg/day, respectively), simvastatin + gemfibrozil (n = 130, 20 and 1,200 mg), or simvastotin + ciprofibrate (n = 124, 20 and 100 mg). Lipid parameters, apoproteins B and A-I, and plasma fibrinogen were assessed every 3 months. Physical and laboratory investigations for adverse effects were performed every month for the first 3 months and every 3 months thereafter. No patient exhibited myopathy or rhabdomyolysis. Five patients (1.3%) were withdrawn from the study because of high transaminases (more than threefold the upper normal limit). Five nonfatal coronary artery disease events were recorded. All 3 combination treatments were more effective in normalizing lipid profile than any monotherapy in the past. Simvastatin + ciprofibrate was more effective than pravastatin + gemfibrozil in reducing LDL, TG, and plasma fibrinogen levels. Simvastatin + gemfibrozil increased HDL levels more than the other 2. The apoprotein B decrease was analogous to the LDL reduction by all combinations, whereas apoprotein A-I was increased more with simvastatin + gemfibrozil. The data suggest that the statin-fibrate combinations used in the study are safe and have a favorable effect on all major coronary artery disease risk factors in patients with refractory familial combined hyperlipidemia with or without coronary artery disease. Early detection of the rare drug-induced reversible hepatotoxicity calls for close monitoring of patients.", 
    "80": "Prevention of coronary heart disease is a major public health goal. The efficacy of lovastatin in lowering serum cholesterol has been proven in research studies, but its efficacy in practice is unclear. To evaluate our practice patterns and outcome in the Veterans Administration Northern California System of Clinics, we reviewed computer-based records of 203 unselected patients issued lovastatin; 193 (95%) were men, and the average patient age was 66 +/- 9 years. The average daily dose of lovastatin was 24 +/- 10 mg, and average duration of therapy was 22 +/- 11 months. Only 72 patients (35%) were instructed on the prescription to take their medication with the evening meal, and only 59 patients (29%) had seen a dietitian during the observed (1 to 3 years) treatment period. Nevertheless, among the 124 patients with pretreatment lipid data, total serum cholesterol decreased by 18% from 271 +/- 45 to 221 +/- 41 mg/dL (P < 0.001), and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol decreased by 23% from 185 +/- 43 to 143 +/- 37 (P < 0.001) mg/dL. High density lipoprotein-cholesterol and triglycerides were unchanged. Of the 168 patients with LDL-cholesterol data during the treatment period, only 74 (44%) achieved an LDL-cholesterol level of less than 130 mg/dL, the minimum goal for a population of older males with a high incidence of other cardiac risk factors. Safety surveillance with liver function testing was performed at least once in 192 patients (95%), but with creatine phosphokinase (CPK) testing in only 123 patients (61%) during the survey period. Enzyme elevations were minor, but occurred at least intermittently in approximately one quarter of patients. Only 5.7% of patients on lovastatin manifested an increase in transaminases on therapy. Due to incomplete baseline data, it is unclear how many patients had elevated CPK as a result of lovastatin. We conclude that: (1) lovastatin is effective in lowering total and LDL-cholesterol in practice, but is often used in dosage insufficient to lower LDL-cholesterol to goal levels; (2) patients are not being adequately educated on dosing schedules; (3) toxicity may be underestimated by infrequent and inconsistent surveillance; and (4) nonpharmacologic therapy is underutilized.", 
    "81": "A wide range of dietary changes is likely to reduce the risk of macrovascular complications of diabetes. It is critically important to recommend a balance of macronutrients different from that currently consumed in most Western countries. Saturated fatty acids, especially myristic and palmitic acids, and trans fatty acids must be reduced to lower LDL cholesterol. Intake of polyunsaturated fatty acids should not be excessive (less than 10% total energy). Fiber-rich carbohydrate, derived from cereals, vegetables, and fruit with intact cell walls, and cis monounsaturated fatty acids should provide the bulk of total energy. These changes are likely to be associated with the most favorable lipoprotein profile and increase intake of dietary antioxidants and so reduce the level of oxidative stress. A reduction of sodium to below 6 g per day will help to reduce blood pressure levels. Optimal glycemic control has not yet been proved to reduce the risk of macrovascular complications, though this is a desirable goal for many other reasons. Ensuring appropriate energy balance (so that BMI is within the desirable range), using low glycemic index foods, and appropriately balancing carbohydrate intake with hypoglycemic drug therapy provide the best nutritional means of achieving satisfactory blood glucose levels. Successful implementation of nutritional recommendations requires the availability of dietitians capable of translating appropriate nutrition into appropriate foods acceptable to people with diabetes and their families. Clear food labeling and the availability of appropriate manufactured foods will further help patients with diabetes to achieve the dietary recommendations.", 
    "82": "We have recently reported that the isoprenoid compound farnesol accelerates degradation of the cholesterologenic enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, when added to cultured cells. We have thus proposed that farnesol is a required nonsterol regulator of this degradation event (T. E. Meigs, D. S. Roseman, and R. D. Simoni, 1996, J. Biol. Chem. 271, 7916-7922). In this report, we have studied the enzyme farnesyl pyrophosphatase (FPPase) in Chinese hamster ovary cells. We demonstrate that FPPase activity increases under conditions of increased metabolic flow through the isoprenoid pathway. Also, we show that a nonhydrolyzable analog of farnesyl pyrophosphate, an isoprenoid (phosphinylmethyl)phosphonate, inhibits FPPase in vitro, and when added to cells this inhibitor blocks the mevalonate-dependent, sterol-induced degradation of HMG-CoA reductase. Furthermore, exogenous farnesol overcomes the effect of this inhibitor. These results suggest an isoprenoid-mediated regulatory mechanism governing intracellular farnesol production and support the hypothesis that farnesol is a nonsterol regulator of reductase degradation.", 
    "83": "We analyzed the antiproliferative effect of simvastatin (SV), an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, on human glioma cell lines. Inhibition of cell growth with SV was observed in all cell lines tested. Different culture conditions altered this inhibition of growth: the lower the concentration of fetal bovine serum (FBS) in the medium, the higher the inhibitory effect of SV on glioma cells. On morphological examination, we found that most of the cells exposed to SV became rounded and the proportion of floating cells was increased in a time-dependent manner. Then we examined whether exogenously added mevalonic acid reversed the growth inhibitory effect of SV. Exogenous mevalonic acid suppressed the inhibitory effect of SV on glioma cells in a dose-dependent manner. SV also enhanced the expression of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor on glioma cells. We also found that peroxidized LDL (p-LDL) was cytotoxic to glioma cells and that SV had additive effects on pLDL-induced cytotoxicity. In a mouse model, growth of glioma cells inoculated into nude mice was inhibited by intratumoral injection of both SV and peroxidized LDL. These results indicate that mevalonic acid or a metabolite in the cholesterol synthesis pathway is necessary for the growth of glioma cells and that simvastatin and/or peroxidized LDL should be examined further as potential therapeutic agents for gliomas.",

For total cholesterol, the mean decrease with hormone therapy was 14 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 11 to 16 percent) and the mean decrease with simvastatin was 26 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 23 to 29 percent). For LDL cholesterol, the mean decrease was 24 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 20 to 28 percent) with hormone therapy and 36 percent (95 percent confidence interval, 32 to 40 percent) with simvastatin. The effect of simvastatin was significantly greater than that of hormone therapy (P<0.001). HDL cholesterol increased similarly with hormone therapy (mean increase, 7 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 2 to 12 percent) and simvastatin (mean increase, 7 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 4 to 10 percent). Triglyceride levels increased with hormone therapy (mean increase, 29 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 15 to 42 percent) but decreased with simvastatin (mean decrease, 14 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 8 to 20 percent).

At the beginning and at the end of the follow-up period they made sonographic examinations of the common carotid artery. In 31 patients treated by statins they observed statistically significant changes: cholesterol declined by 23%, LDL cholesterol by 25.3%. The maximal rate in the common carotid artery (ACC) declined from 93 +/- 22 to 73 +/- 13 cm/s. The diameters of the ACC increased from 6.0 +/- 0.8 to 6.5 +/- 0.8 mm. The intima of the ACC diminished from 0.84 +/- 0.26 to 0.75 +/- 0.20 mm. In 22 patients treated with fibrates the anticipated lipid changes occurred.

Two groups of cholesterol-fed rabbits were treated with L-arginine (2.0% in drinking water) or lovastatin (10 mg/d) during weeks 5 through 16. Systemic nitric oxide (NO) formation was assessed as the urinary excretion rates of nitrate and cGMP in weekly intervals. Cholesterol feeding progressively reduced urinary nitrate excretion to approximately 40% of baseline (P<.05) and increased plasma concentrations of asymmetrical dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous NO synthesis inhibitor. Dietary L-arginine reversed the reduction in plasma L-arginine/ADMA ratio and partly restored urinary excretion of nitrate and cGMP (each P<.05 vs cholesterol) but did not change plasma cholesterol levels. L-Arginine completely blocked the progression of carotid intimal plaques, reduced aortic intimal thickening, and preserved endothelium-dependent vasodilator function. Lovastatin treatment reduced plasma cholesterol by 32% but did not improve urinary nitrate or cGMP excretion or endothelium-dependent vasodilation. Lovastatin had a weaker inhibitory effect on carotid plaque formation and aortic intimal thickening than L-arginine. L-Arginine inhibited but lovastatin potentiated superoxide radical generation in the atherosclerotic vascular wall.",

(1983) J. Cell. Physiol. 155, 340-348]. In this study we show that several [3H]mevalonate labeled proteins in FRTL-5 cells associate with membrane and cytoskeleton and, among these, we describe the presence of a 48-kDa prenylated protein, identified by immunoprecipitation as 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide 3'-phosphodiesterase (CNP), that associates with microtubules. This latter association persists through several polymerization/depolymerization cycles, whereas other prenylated proteins are lost. It is suggested that CNP can be a novel microtubule-associated protein (MAP) and a promising candidate as a membrane anchor for microtubules.", 
    "95": "Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) is a serine protease inhibitor that regulates tissue factor-induced blood coagulation. In an open-label 8-week study, 20 hypercholesterolemic patients (10 type IIa and 10 type IIb) were enrolled and given fluvastatin 40 mg once daily at bedtime. At baseline (after a 4-week controlled diet) and at week 8, total cholesterol, total triglycerides and lipoprotein subfractions were assessed. TFPI antigen levels were measured at the same time by ELISA. We also measured TFPI concentrations in 10 control subjects and in 10 patients at the time of and ten days after acute myocardial infarction. In type IIa patients fluvastatin reduced total cholesterol levels by 26% and LDL-cholesterol by 30% (P < 0.001); in type IIb, fluvastatin significantly reduced total cholesterol levels by 24% (P < 0.001). In both dyslipidemic groups the baseline total TFPI levels were significantly higher than in the control group (P < 0.002). The therapeutic lipid-lowering effect was paralleled by a significantly reduction of total TFPI antigen concentrations from 132 +/- 23 to 71 +/- 37 ng/mL (P < 0.001) in type IIa and from 120 +/- 30 to 91 +/- 29 ng/mL (P < 0.05) in type IIb patients; in control subjects total TFPI levels were 81 +/- 22 ng/mL; however the lipoprotein-bound TFPI antigen subfractions did not differ significantly in the treated and control groups. In patients with recent myocardial infarction there was a significant reduction from day 0 to day 10 in total TFPI antigen levels, from 120 +/- 48 ng/mL to 80 +/- 16 ng/mL (P < 0.05). The reported reduction of TFPI antigen levels after fluvastatin treatment could be a sign of normalization of an up-regulated clotting system rather than an unfavourable reduction of a natural anticoagulant.", 
    "96": "Lovastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG) CoA reductase, and 6-fluoromevalonate (Fmev), an inhibitor of diphosphomevalonate decarboxylase, blocked the synthesis of downstream mevalonate products, including prenyl-derived lipids, and prevented membrane localization of Ras in the myeloid cell line U-937. In contrast to lovastatin, which induced cytosol localization of Ras in U-937 cells, Fmev failed to increase cytosolic Ras and also completely prevented the proliferation of U-937 cells. Growth of U-937 cells was restored by the addition of lovastatin to Fmev-blocked cells. These results implied that a product of mevalonate metabolism proximal to isopentenyl diphosphate was responsible for the suppression of proliferation. To delineate the action of this endogenous inhibitor of cell proliferation and determine the relationship between its impact on Ras localization and cell proliferation, the effect of Fmev on a variety of leukemia- and lymphoma-derived cells was examined. Whereas Fmev blocked the growth of these cell lines, there were more than 50-fold differences in the concentrations required to inhibit the growth of individual cell lines by 90%. Regardless of its effect on cell proliferation, the biochemical effect of Fmev was similar. Thus, Fmev uniformly prevented the conversion of radiolabeled mevalonate to isopentenyl diphosphate and other downstream products, including synthesis of sterol and nonsterol lipids and prenylation of proteins. A correlation was noted between higher intrinsic rates of mevalonate synthesis by a cell and susceptibility to inhibition by Fmev. Thus, sensitivity of a cell line to inhibition by Fmev was associated with markedly increased rates of HMG CoA reductase activity that were further increased by incubation with Fmev. Whereas Fmev depleted cellular levels of the prenylated protein Ras in the sensitive cell line U-937, there was no depletion of cellular Ras levels in the resistant cell line EL-4, but rather, there was a shift of Ras from membrane to cytosol, as expected for inhibition of prenylation. These results suggest that leukemic cells with increased HMG CoA reductase activity produce increased levels of an endogenous mevalonate-derived inhibitor that leads to Ras depletion and suppression of cell growth. As a result, inhibition of the growth of these transformed cells might be specifically accomplished by Fmev.", 
    "97": "In cells exposed to brefeldin A (BFA), enzymes of the Golgi apparatus are redistributed to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by retrograde membrane flow, where they may cause modifications on resident ER proteins. We have used a truncated form of the rough ER-specific type I transmembrane glycoprotein ribophorin I as a probe to detect Golgi glycosyltransferases relocated to the ER in a BFA-dependent fashion. This polypeptide (RI332) comprises the 332 amino-terminal amino acids of ribophorin I and behaves like a luminal ER protein when expressed in HeLa cells. Upon treatment of the cells with BFA, RI332 becomes quantitatively O-glycosylated by Golgi glycosyltransferases that are transported back to the ER. Here we demonstrate that pretreatment of the cells with lovastatin, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, abrogates this modification and that mevalonate, the product formed in the step inhibited by the drug, is able to counteract the effect of lovastatin. We also show by immunofluorescence using mannosidase II as a Golgi marker that the BFA-induced retrograde transport of Golgi enzymes is blocked by lovastatin, although electron microscopy indicates that BFA causes disassembly of the Golgi apparatus into swollen vesicles and tubules. Our observations support the role of a prenylated protein, such as the geranylgeranylated small G protein Rab6, in the retrograde transport from the Golgi apparatus to the ER, since lovastatin acts by inhibiting its prenylation.",

A comparative study on the effects of Xuezhikang and Simvastatin (Zocor) was carried out. One hundred and eight patients with primary hyperlipidemia were randomly divided into two groups. Group 1 consisted of 53 patients, each taking 4 Xuezhikang capsules/day (1.2 g/day) for 8 weeks and group 2 included 55 cases, each taking Zocor 10 mg/day for 8 weeks. At the end of 8 weeks, the lipid levels were compared with those of the baseline in each group. In group 1 serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides (TG) were decreased by 23.0%, 28.0% and 28.1% (P < 0.001) respectively and in group 2 they were reduced by 23.3%, 29.5% and 29.5% (P < 0.001) respectively. Serum level of high density lipoprotein (HDL-C) was increased by 5.0% (P > 0.05) with Xuezhikang and 14.3% (P < 0.01) with Zocor, but no significant differences were found between the two groups in TC, LDL-C, TG and HDL-C.

The other 122 cases (35.5%) failed to meet any of the indications of the usage guidelines. Only 102 patients (29.7%) had their baseline lipid profiles examined and 117 patients (34%) had their baseline liver function tested. Over all, very few cases had lipid profiles and liver function tests every 3 months while taking antihyperlipidaemic agents. Patients who had been prescribed antihyperlipidaemic agents for more than 1 year were evaluated to assess the effectiveness of their pharmacological therapy. The prescribed doses were found to be lower than recommended in the general literature except for patients who received lovastatin and pravastatin.", 
    "102": "There are many treatment guidelines for hypercholesterolaemia in north America and Europe. This study revealed that a large proportion of antihyperlipidaemic agents used in our patient population did not comply with these general recommendations. Although the reasons for not complying with usage guidelines need to be further investigated, our study findings may well serve as the basis for further quality management and pharmacoeconomic analysis.", 
    "103": "The in vitro and in vivo activity of atorvastatin and other 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMGCoA) reductase inhibitors (fluvastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin) has been investigated. Atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin caused a significant and dose-dependent (0.1-50 microM) reduction in cell multiplication of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) in cultures associated with the retardation of cycling cells in the G1 and G2/M compartments at 24 h, a phenomenon leading to apoptosis (programmed cell death) in several experimental in vitro models. The effects on the cell cycle resulted in a strong inhibition of cell proliferation at 48 h, followed by apoptosis when incubation was prolonged to 72 h as assessed by nuclei morphology and cytofluorimetric analysis of DNA. The apoptotic effect observed for the statins is completely prevented by the addition of exogenous mevalonate at a 100 microm concentration. in vivo SMC proliferation was stimulated by applying a silastic collar to the outside surface of carotid arteries in normocholesterolemic rabbits in the presence of an anatomically intact endothelium. The positioning of the collar promoted apoptosis in control vessels as assessed by Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase-dUTP-Biotin Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) assay. The pre-treatment with 5 mg kg-1 per day of atorvastatin before collar insertion strongly increased the number of TUNEL-positive cells, suggesting a pro-apoptotic effect of HMGCoA reductase inhibitors also in vivo, even though cell DNA rearrangement still needs to be excluded. No apoptotic signal was detectable in sham operated arteries with no collar in either control or atorvastatin-treated rabbits. These data indicate that HMGCoA reductase inhibitors effect on the arterial wall may involve the modulation of both cell proliferation and programmed cell deaths supporting a possible role of statins in the prevention of early lesion and restenosis.", 
    "104": "Hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors are the drugs of choice in heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), which has a high risk of ischemic heart disease. An open-label study was conducted to test the efficacy and safety of atorvastatin, a new synthetic HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor in proven FH. After a 4-week placebo phase, 22 subjects were randomized to either 80 mg atorvastatin at night (n = 11) or 40 mg twice a day for 6 weeks. The two dosage groups were well matched and had no difference in lipoprotein responses. After 6 weeks, the LDL cholesterol concentration was reduced by 57%, from 8.16 +/- 1.15 to 3.53 +/- 0.99 mmol/L (P < .001). The total cholesterol concentration decreased from 9.90 +/- 1.32 to 5.43 mmol/L (P < .001). HDL cholesterol concentration increased from 1.19 +/- 0.31 to 1.49 +/- 0.43 mmol/L (P < .001). Triglyceride concentrations decreased from 1.34 +/- 0.66 to 0.88 +/- 0.36 mmol/L (P < .01). Three subjects had single, transient increases of serum transaminase of up to twice the upper limit of normal. Apolipoprotein B concentration decreased significantly by 42%. Changes in apolipoproteins AI and (a) were not statistically significant. Nondenaturing gradient gel electrophoresis revealed increases in the size of smaller LDL particles in four subjects. Plasma fibrinogen concentration increased by 44%. The drug was well tolerated. One subject withdrew for personal reasons. Atorvastatin is a powerful and safe lipid-modifying agent for LDL cholesterol; it also modifies HDL cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations, and may suffice as a single agent for many subjects with heterozygous FH.", 
    "105": "The overall objective of this study was to determine whether peroral treatment with the 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor fluvastatin influences the leukocyte-endothelial cell adhesion (LECA) observed in postcapillary venules of hypercholesterolemic rats. Rats were fed either normal chow or a chow supplemented with 1% cholesterol for 10 days. Leukocyte adherence and extravasation, leukocyte rolling velocity, red blood cell velocity, and vessel diameter were monitored in mesenteric venules superfused with either 100 nmol/L platelet-activating factor (PAF) or 20 nmol/L leukotriene B4 (LTB4). Hypercholesterolemic rats exhibited an exaggerated LECA response compared with their normocholesterolemic counterparts. In hypercholesterolemic rats, treatment with fluvastatin significantly attenuated the leukocyte-adherence responses to PAF and LTB4 as well as the leukocyte emigration response to LTB4. Fluvastatin treatment also inhibited the PAF- and LTB4-induced reductions in leukocyte rolling velocity. These findings indicate that fluvastatin blunts the inflammatory responses elicited in post-capillary venules by lipid mediators.", 
    "106": "The relationship between the inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis and occurrence of myopathy was studied in L6 myoblasts using two lines of cholesterol biosynthesis inhibitors, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor (simvastatin) and squalene epoxidase inhibitors (TU-2078 and NB-598). All inhibitors completely inhibited the cholesterol synthesis in L6 myoblasts at doses of 1 and 3 microM. Simvastatin (3 microM) inhibited the fusion reaction of L6 myoblasts followed by the severe cellular damage. The myoblasts also had failed actin fiber formation and creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) production. Additionally, this agent also caused apoptotic cell death in differentiated L6 muscle fiber, indicating that skeletal myopathy by HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors seems to occur not only in differentiating immature myoblasts but also in matured skeletal myotubes. In contrast, TU-2078 and NB-598 had no effect on the fusion reaction of differentiating myoblasts or on the cellular viability of muscle fiber at 3 microM, enough to completely inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis. It is conceivable that the mevalonate depletion and subsequent failure of ras farnesylation induced by simvastatin might cause the defects in differentiation and maintenance of the muscle fiber. Squalene epoxidase inhibitors did not show this adverse effect presumably because of the enzyme inhibition downstream of farnesyl synthesis. The present findings suggest the safe use of squalene epoxidase inhibitors in lipid-lowering therapy.", 
    "107": "Pharmacological properties of NK-104 ((+)-monocalcium bis\u00bf(3R,5S,6E)-7-[2-cyclopropyl-4-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-quinolyl++ +]-3,5-dihydroxy-6- heptenoate\u00bf, CAS 147526-32-7), a novel synthetic inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, were investigated. The kinetic study, using rat liver microsomal HMG-CoA reductase, revealed that NK-104 is a competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase with a Ki of 1.7 nmol/l. To examine the inhibitory effect on sterol synthesis in vivo, de novo synthesis of sterols from [14C]acetate 3 h after oral administration of NK-104 was measured in rats. NK-104 showed marked inhibition in liver (ED50 0.13 mg/kg) and in ileum (ED50 0.20 mg/kg), but much weaker in the other tissues. The inhibitory effect of NK-104 on liver sterol synthesis lasted over 6 h, while that of pravastatin and simvastatin disappeared 6 h after administration of the drugs twice the ED50s. Due to induction of HMG-CoA reductase, initial suppression of hepatic sterol synthesis by pravastatin and simvastatin was compensated, and the cumulative change in hepatic sterol synthesis during 12 h after drug administration was remarkably negative only with long-acting NK-104. Hypolipidemic effects of NK-104 (0.03, 0.1, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg p.o. for 2 weeks) were examined in beagle dogs. NK-104 reduced plasma total cholesterol dose-dependently (13.1, 18.5 and 20.2% at doses of 0.1, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg, respectively), and also plasma triglycerides by 0.1 mg/kg or more. Pravastatin (1 and 3 mg/kg) and simvastatin (3 mg/kg) lowered plasma total cholesterol (14.0, 15.4 and 17.4%, respectively), but did not significantly affect plasma triglyceride levels. These results indicate that NK-104 is a potent, liver-selective, long-acting HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor with a high cholesterol- and triglyceride-lowering potency.", 
    "108": "1. In this study the effect of lovastatin, an inhibitor of cholesterol and isoprenoid synthesis, on the rises in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) induced by platelet derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB), angiotensin II (AII), low density lipoproteins (LDL) and foetal calf serum (FCS) was examined in human cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) from saphenous vein. Changes in [Ca2+]i were measured in cell suspensions by the Ca2+ sensitive probe, fura 2. 2. Incubation with lovastatin for 24-26 h markedly reduced the peak rise and sustained phase of [Ca2+]i elevation in response to PDGF-BB but the responses to AII, LDL and FCS were unaffected. Further experiments showed that lovastatin pretreatment inhibited PDGF-BB induced Ca2+ influx but not intracellular Ca2+ release. This inhibition could be overcome by co-incubation with mevalonic acid. 3. Pretreatment of cells with the heterotrimeric G protein inhibitor pertussis toxin for up to 24 h completely abolished AII-induced [Ca2+]i rises but the response to PDGF-BB was unaffected. 4. The tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein largely abolished PDGF-BB-induced [Ca2+]i elevation but had no significant effect on AII-induced responses. 5. Pre-incubation with lovastatin had no effect on the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of PDGF-beta receptors (as measured by Western blot) in response to the PDGF-BB ligand. 6. PDGF-BB elicits Ca2+ influx via a tyrosine kinase-dependent mechanism distinct from the heterotrimeric G protein coupled pathway utilized by AII. Lovastatin most likely acts by inhibition of isoprenylation (via blockade of isoprenoid synthesis) of an intermediate molecule involved in PDGF-BB-induced Ca2+ influx.", 
    "109": "Competitive inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase improve hypercholesterolemia. However, reports about the effects of these agents on bile acid synthesis, the metabolic pathway of cholesterol, are conflicting. We studied the short-term effect on one of these agents, pravastatin, on bile acid synthesis. Six male volunteers were given 40 mg of pravastatin. Plasma mevalonate level (which reflects cholesterol synthesis) and 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one level (which reflects bile acid synthesis) were measured every 2 h for 8 h. These plasma levels were compared to those of the same volunteers without pravastatin. Plasma mevalonate level after 2 h was lower than control (3.0 +/- 1.1 ng/mL vs. 6.7 +/- 2.5, mean +/- SD; P < 0.05). This decrease continued for 8 h (2.5 +/- 0.8 vs. 5.2 +/- 1.5; P < 0.05). On the other hand, plasma 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one level did not change until after 6 h; then at 8 h it was lower than control (15.7 +/- 11.8 ng/mL vs. 24.7 +/- 16.9; P < 0.05). According to three-way layout analysis of variance, mevalonate level was influenced by both pravastatin treatment (P < 0.01) and time-course (P < 0.01). On the other hand, the 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one level was affected by both individual difference (P < 0.01) and time course (P < 0.01), but pravastatin treatment did not influence this compound. This indicates that bile acid synthesis was influenced by pravastatin, although cholesterol synthesis was inhibited. The short-term inhibition of cholesterol synthesis did not affect bile acid synthesis.", 
    "110": "Advances in treatment of elevated cholesterol levels and recent documentation of efficacy and safety in clinical trials justify expanded use of cholesterol-lowering therapy in clinical practice. Patients with CHD or other forms of clinical atherosclerotic disease can benefit from aggressive cholesterol management. Maximal dietary modification, weight control, and physical activity are valuable adjuncts to drug therapy in secondary prevention. Recent studies have shown that appropriate use of cholesterol-lowering drugs is cost-effective and efficacious in patients with CHD. Use of such drugs can increase patients' life expectancy. Primary care physicians have a key role in instituting intensive cholesterol management in patients with clinically manifest atherosclerotic disease. Furthermore, they should take the lead in coordinating with cardiovascular specialists to manage cholesterol levels in patients who have had a recent acute coronary syndrome or undergone a revascularization procedure.",

    "113": "The Air Force/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention Study (AFCAPS/TexCAPS) is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled primary prevention trial. It is designed to test the hypothesis that in addition to a lipid-lowering diet, treatment with lovastatin is more effective than placebo in reducing acute major coronary events (i.e., sudden cardiac death, fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction, and unstable angina) in a cohort with normal to mildly elevated total (180 to 264 mg/dl) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (130 to 190 mg/dl) and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (< or =45 mg/dl for men and < or =47 mg/dl for women). Two sites in Texas, Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio and the University of North Texas Health Science Center in Fort Worth, will conduct the study. After at least 12 weeks of an American Heart Association Step 1 diet and 2 weeks placebo run-in, 6,605 men and women, ages 45 to 73 and 55 to 73 years, respectively, without clinical evidence of coronary heart disease, are randomized in equal numbers to either lovastatin (20 mg/day) or placebo. Study procedures maintain the blind, allowing titration of lovastatin from 20 to 40 mg/day to achieve an LDL cholesterol goal of < or = 110 mg/dl. All participants are followed until study completion, when 320 participants have had a primary end point or a minimum of 5 years after the last participant is randomized, whichever occurs last. All end points are adjudicated by an independent committee using prespecified criteria. Unique features of this trial are (1) the inclusion of unstable angina in the primary end point to reflect the increasing trend to treat coronary heart disease aggressively before a myocardial infarction has occurred, (2) aggressive pharmacologic intervention, with titration, to attain an LDL cholesterol goal less than the current National Cholesterol Education Panel guidelines for primary prevention, and (3) a cohort that includes women, the elderly, and those with mild to moderate hyperlipidemia and low HDL cholesterol. Compared with earlier studies, results will be applicable to a broader population and may help clarify the role of aggressive LDL cholesterol reduction measures in primary prevention. Treatment of this population is likely to realize the greatest cumulative long-term benefit in the prevention of acute major coronary events.", 
    "114": "Despite the potential for reduced morbidity and mortality, aggressive intervention against mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) remains controversial and infrequently practiced. Eligible patients in the 2.5-year Lipoprotein and Coronary Atherosclerosis Study were men and women aged 35 to 75 years with angiographic CHD and mean low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol of 115 to 190 mg/dl despite diet. Patients (n = 429; 19% women) were randomized to fluvastatin 20 mg twice daily or placebo. One fourth of patients were also assigned open-label adjunctive cholestyramine up to 12 g/day because prerandomization LDL cholesterol remained > or = 160 mg/dl. The primary end point, assessed by quantitative coronary angiography, was within-patient per-lesion change in minimum lumen diameter (MLD) of qualifying lesions. Across 2.5 years, mean LDL cholesterol was reduced by 23.9% in all fluvastatin patients (+/- cholestyramine) (146 to 111 mg/dl) and by 22.5% in the fluvastatin only subgroup (137 to 106 mg/dl). Primary end point analysis (340 patients) showed significantly less lesion progression in all fluvastatin versus all placebo patients, deltaMLD -0.028 versus -0.100 mm (p <0.01), and for fluvastatin alone versus placebo alone, deltaMLD -0.024 versus -0.094 mm (p <0.02). A consistent angiographic benefit with treatment was seen whether baseline LDL cholesterol was above or below 160 or 130 mg/dl. Beneficial trends with treatment were also consistently seen in clinical event rates but were not statistically significant. Thus, lipid lowering by fluvastatin in patients with mildly to moderately elevated LDL cholesterol significantly slowed CHD progression.", 
    "115": "The effects of atorvastatin (lipitor) on cholesterol-rich and triglyceride-rich lipoproteins were evaluated in this multicenter trial. Following a 6-week baseline period, 47 patients with elevated cholesterol and triglyceride levels were treated with atorvastatin 10 mg once daily (QD) for the initial 12 weeks (Period 1) increasing to 20 mg QD for the following 12 weeks (Period 2). At both the 10 and 20 mg doses, atorvastatin treatment resulted in significant reductions compared to pretreatment levels in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), apolipoprotein (apo) B, apoB in LDL (LDL-apo B), apo B in VLDL (VLDL-apo B), lipoprotein (Lp)B, lipoprotein B-complex (LpBc), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein triglycerides (LDL-TG), very low-density lipoprotein triglyceride (VLDL-TG), high-density lipoprotein triglycerides (HDL-TG), and apo C-III. Atorvastatin 10 and 20 mg QD also resulted in significant increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), apo AI, and LpAII:B:C:D:E. Due to its unique ability to normalize both cholesterol-rich and triglyceride-rich particles, atorvastatin is a promising candidate for monotherapy in a broad range of patients including those with varying degrees of hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia.", 
    "116": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors ameliorate atherosclerotic diseases in several models of vascular disease. This is largely due to their ability to reduce plasma cholesterol levels in vivo. Proliferation of cellular components is one of the major events in the development and progression of atherosclerotic lesions. We recently demonstrated that oxidized low density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL), a likely atherogenic lipoprotein present in vivo, is capable of inducing macrophage growth in vitro. In the present study, we investigated the effect of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, simvastatin and pravastatin, on Ox-LDL-induced macrophage growth. Our results demonstrated that these inhibitors effectively suppressed Ox-LDL-induced macrophage growth with concentrations required for 50% inhibition by simvastatin and pravastatin being 0.1 and 80 microM, respectively, and that this inhibitory effect was reversed by mevalonate but not by squalene. Under these conditions, simvastatin did not affect the endocytic degradation of Ox-LDL, nor subsequent accumulation of intracellular cholesteryl esters. Our results suggest that a non-cholesterol metabolites(s) of mevalonate pathway may play an important role in Ox-LDL-induced macrophage growth. Since it is well known that macrophage-derived foam cells are the key cellular element in the early stage of atherosclerosis, a significant inhibition of Ox-LDL-induced macrophage growth by HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in vitro, particularly simvastatin, may also explain, at least in part, their anti-atherogenic action in vivo.", 
    "117": "Hypertension and diabetes mellitus are common chronic conditions which frequently coexist. Diabetic nephropathy is a major cause of elevated blood pressure in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM). Diabetic nephropathy, arterial sclerosis, obesity and association of essential hypertension can be the causes of hypertension in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring has revealed that the nocturnal fall of blood pressure is blunted in patients with diabetic nephropathy. A blunted diurnal blood pressure variation is seen in microalbuminuric diabetic patients and even in some normoalbuminuric patients. Accumulating data suggest that normalisation of blood pressure in hypertensive IDDM patients is most important to minimise the loss of kidney function. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have been reported to be effective in postponing the development of nephropathy and in slowing its progression. Whether only ACE inhibitors have such beneficial renal effects on diabetic nephropathy is under discussion. While many studies have suggested that insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia are related to an elevated blood pressure in hypertensive patients, there does not seem to be enough evidence to prove that insulin per se can raise blood pressure in humans. Neither an insulin infusion within a physiological range nor sustained hyperinsulinaemia and insulin resistance (e.g. patients with insulinoma, cystic ovary syndrome) have been associated with an elevated blood pressure. Insulin resistance in some hypertensive patients may be a consequence of a decreased blood flow due to an increased peripheral resistance. Preliminary evidence suggests that low birth weight or impaired fetal growth is related to hypertension and NIDDM. Familial clustering of diabetic nephropathy suggests the contribution of genetic susceptibility and/or environmental inheritance. The frequent association of nephropathy with hypertension has led to research on the genes related to hypertension (ACE, angiotensinogen). Nevertheless, to date no reliable and clinically useful genetic marker has been found. Attempts to correct the metabolic abnormalities derived from diabetes are a new topic in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy. The effects of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (antihypercholesterolaemic drugs), aldose reductase inhibitors (inhibitors of the polyol pathway) and glycation inhibitors (inhibitors of formation of advanced glycosylation end-products) on diabetic nephropathy have been evaluated in animal studies and in some clinical trials. Thus far, results with HMG CoA reductase and aldose reductase inhibitors have been somewhat conflicting. The potential therapeutic role of glycation inhibition in the treatment of diabetes deserves further study.", 
    "118": "In the Post Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (POST CABG) clinical trial, the primary outcome is substantial worsening (i.e., narrowing of the lumen diameter) of the vein grafts upon comparison of the baseline and follow-up angiograms. The patients had one to five non-occluded vein grafts at entry, so there may be from one to five primary outcome responses per patient. A modified ratio estimate (MRE) statistic, as described previously by Zucker and Wittes, may be used to analyze data of this kind. In the present paper we propose a more powerful MRE statistic when the event rates and/ or intraclass correlations vary according to number of grafts per patient. We also adapt this statistic to the factorial treatment design of the POST CABG clinical trial.",

    "124": "The mechanism by which dietary cholesterol regulates expression of the hepatic low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor was investigated. In a previous study (Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 325, 242-248, 1996), we demonstrated that dietary cholesterol reduces the rate of LDL receptor protein degradation without affecting steady-state levels of receptor protein. In view of these findings, it was expected that dietary cholesterol would decrease the rate of transcription of the hepatic LDL receptor gene, resulting in lower mRNA levels and lower rates of synthesis of LDL receptor protein. Surprisingly, neither the rate of transcription nor the level of LDL receptor mRNA was reduced in response to dietary cholesterol, even though hepatic cholesterol levels were increased twofold. This suggests that under normal conditions, dietary cholesterol does not affect LDL receptor gene expression at the level of transcription. In contrast, feeding 2% cholesterol to rats fed a diet supplemented with 0.04% lovastatin significantly decreased hepatic LDL receptor mRNA levels and transcription rates. These results suggest that lovastatin unmasks transcriptional regulation of the hepatic LDL receptor by dietary cholesterol. The levels of the mature nuclear forms of sterol response element binding proteins-1 and -2 were unaffected despite significant changes in hepatic cholesterol levels, mRNA levels, and transcription rates caused by lovastatin treatment. This suggests that the observed changes in transcription rates may not be mediated by these proteins in rat liver.", 
    "125": "To better understand the molecular interactions between somatic and germ cells in the mammalian testis, we have begun to analyze with mRNA differential display changes in gene expression induced by coculturing rat Sertoli cells and germ cells. We have identified 10 cDNAs that are either down-regulated or up-regulated in cocultures of germ cells and Sertoli cells. Three genes expressed in Sertoli cells and three genes expressed in germ cells were down-regulated in Sertoli cell-germ cell cocultures, whereas four genes were up-regulated in the cocultures. Northern blot analysis was used to establish the expression pattern of the mRNAs encoded by the cDNAs and to define the sizes of the differentially expressed mRNAs. Sequence analysis of the cDNAs and computer searches against the GenBank and EMBL DNA databases were used to relate the ten cDNAs to known genes. Of the three Sertoli cell cDNAs, one appeared identical to transferin, while the other two shared regions of similarity to an endoplasmic reticulum stress protein and to a pro-alpha 2 XI collagen, respectively. The three germ cell cDNAs shared sequences with fibronectin, with a basic fibroblast growth factor receptor and with an IgG gamma 2b, respectively. The four cDNAs that were up-regulated in the Sertoli-germ cell cocultures showed similarity to an isoform of casein kinase 1 delta, to an epidermal growth factor, to a statin-related protein, and to an integral membrane glycoprotein. These data demonstrate that a number of specific genes are up- and down-regulated when germ cells and Sertoli cells are cocultured, and suggest these genes are important in cell to cell communication during spermatogenesis.", 
    "126": "The cellular events following interaction between matrix proteins and cells are important requisites for physiological mechanisms as well as the progress of a number of diseases. Cellular adhesion to fibronectin, an important component of the extracellular matrix has been demonstrated to be associated with translocation of protein kinase C (PKC) by an integrin-dependent pathway. For this process G-proteins may play an important role as coupling proteins. Membrane association and activity of G-proteins has been shown to be regulated by isoprenylation. We therefore studied whether fibronectin mediated adhesion resulted in PKC translocation and if isoprenylation of cellular proteins may play a role for this integrin-dependent pathway of PKC activation. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were pretreated with either the Hydroxy-methylglutaryl(HMG)-CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin or prenylation inhibitor limonene. For the stimulation by extracellular matrices, CHO cells were plated on tissue culture dishes coated with fibronectin or bovine serum albumin and PKC activity was determined. To investigate direct effects of inhibition of isoprenylation on cytoskeletal organization, phalloidin-stained stress fibers were characterized after adhesion on different matrices. CHO cells seeded on fibronectin displayed over twice the PKC translocation to the particulate fraction in comparison to that measured in cells on albumin. Pretreatment of CHO cells with lovastatin or limonene resulted in partial suppression of PKC activation after cell-seeding on the specific matrix fibronectin. Changed PKC distribution was not due to a disorganization of the actin skeleton. These data show that inhibition of isoprenylation of cellular proteins, possibly small Guanosine triphosphate(GTP)-binding proteins, alters only the integrin-mediated PKC distribution but does not greatly influence constitutive PKC distribution.",

There was also no significant increase in risk of cancer (RR, 1.03; 95% CI, 0.90-1.17).", 
    "132": "This overview of all published randomized trials of statin drugs demonstrates large reductions in cholesterol and clear evidence of benefit on stroke and total mortality. There was, as expected, a large and significant decrease in CVD mortality, but there was no significant evidence for any increases in either non-CVD deaths or cancer incidence.", 
    "133": "The folate receptor, like many glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins, is found associated with membrane domains that are insoluble in Triton X-100 at low temperature and that are enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids. Depletion of cellular cholesterol has been shown to inhibit vitamin uptake by this receptor (Chang, W. -J., Rothberg, K. G., Kamen, B. A., and Anderson, R. G. W. (1993) J. Cell Biol. 118, 63-69), suggesting that these domains regulate this process. In this study, the importance of sphingolipids for folate receptor function was investigated in Caco-2 cells using fumonisin B1, a mycotoxin that inhibits the biosynthesis of these lipids. The folate receptor-mediated transport of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate was almost completely blocked in cells in which sphingolipids had been reduced by approximately 40%. This inhibition was dependent on the concentration and duration of the treatment with the mycotoxin and was mediated by the sphingolipid decrease. Neither receptor-mediated nor facilitative transport was inhibited by fumonisin B1 treatment, indicating that the effect of sphingolipid depletion was specific for folate receptor-mediated vitamin uptake. A concurrent loss in the total amount of folate binding capacity in the cells was seen as sphingolipids were depleted, suggesting a causal relationship between folate receptor number and vitamin uptake. These findings suggest that dietary exposure to fumonisin B1 could adversely affect folate uptake and potentially compromise cellular processes dependent on this vitamin. Furthermore, because folate deficiency causes neural tube defects, some birth defects unexplained by other known risk factors may be caused by exposure to fumonisin B1.", 
    "134": "Lipid-lowering therapy during 2 years in the Regression Growth Evaluation Statin Study (REGRESS) was associated with less progression of coronary atherosclerosis in the pravastatin group compared with the placebo group. The effect of lipid-lowering therapy on the functional state of the coronary circulation is less well known. The purpose of this study was to evaluate this effect.", 
    "135": "In a substudy of REGRESS, 69 patients were randomized to pravastatin or placebo. Thirty-seven of these patients were allocated to the medical management stratum. Quantitative coronary angiography, regional myocardial perfusion, exercise testing, and classification of angina pectoris were assessed at baseline and after 2 years of therapy. Regional myocardial perfusion was assessed by digital subtraction angiography after intracoronary papaverine with video-densitometric calculation of the hyperemic mean transit time (HMTT) of contrast. In the medical management stratum, regional myocardial perfusion was assessed in 31 regions in the pravastatin group and 25 regions in the placebo group. The change in HMTT in the pravastatin group was -0.18 seconds (-5%) and in the placebo group +0.52 seconds (+18%), a difference of 0.70 seconds (P=.004). The mean difference in change in classification of angina pectoris (scale, 1 to 4) between pravastatin and placebo was 0.7 (P=.03) in favor of the pravastatin-treated patients. The change in HMTT was correlated with the change in exercise time (r=-.65, P=.002).", 
    "136": "In patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease, treatment with the HMG-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor pravastatin during 2 years resulted in a preserved regional myocardial perfusion, whereas patients on placebo deteriorated. The classification of angina pectoris improved only in patients receiving pravastatin. In lipid-lowering therapy, the evaluation of myocardial perfusion by assessment of the HMTT reveals a combined measure of functional and structural changes in the coronary circulation.", 
    "137": "The efficacy, safety, and tolerability of a moderate dose, 3-drug lipid-lowering regimen were evaluated among 29 male patients with hyperlipidemia and coronary artery disease. In an initial 12-month phase, regular niacin, 500 mg qid, lovastatin, 20 mg bid, and colestipol, 10 g/bid, were given with dose adjustment for lipid targets and side effects. This was followed by 2 random sequence crossover phases (8 months each) alternating regular niacin with a polygel controlled-release formulation of niacin for use in this regimen. Lipid, lipoprotein, apoprotein, and clinical chemistry determinations were obtained at baseline, during the initial phase, at the 2 crossover phases, and at 6 weeks after therapy. A final questionnaire queried specific side effects and overall preferences. Low-/high-density lipoprotein (LDL/HDL) changed from means of 215/46 mg/dl at baseline, to 94/59 mg/dl after run-in, to 85/52 mg/dl after 8 months of controlled-release niacin, and to 98/56 mg/dl after 8 months of regular niacin (regular niacin vs controlled-release niacin, p <0.005/<0.05). The target of LDL < or = 100 mg/dl was achieved at 8 months by 83% of these patients with controlled-release niacin and by 52% with regular niacin (p <0.01). Compliance was 95% with controlled-release niacin versus 85% with regular niacin (p <0.001). The controlled-release niacin and regular niacin regimens did not differ in terms of uric acid, glucose, insulin, or asparate aminotransferase levels. Overall, 21% of patients called the 3 drugs \"very easy\" and 72% \"fairly easy\" to take. The controlled-release niacin-containing regimen was preferred by 21 patients and the regular niacin by 4. In conclusion, these regimens achieve striking lipid changes among hyperlipidemic patients. Controlled release is the preferred niacin preparation in terms of LDL reduction, compliance, patient preference, and achieving the National Cholesterol Education Program guideline of LDL < or = 100 mg/dl. The 2 niacin preparations did not differ in evidence of toxicity.", 
    "138": "The aim of this study was to compare the cost effectiveness of micronised fenofibrate 200 mg and simvastatin 20 mg in the treatment of type IIa and IIb hyperlipidaemia. In a retrospective analysis, data from 2 randomised controlled clinical trials were evaluated. The results show that micronised fenofibrate has a better short term cost effectiveness than simvastatin. The costs per successfully treated patient with hyperlipidaemia over a 12-week period were [in Deutschmarks (DM); DMI = $US0.66, April 1995] DM537 for fenofibrate and DM809 for simvastatin. When the data were analysed according to type of hyperlipidaemia (classification of Frederickson), there were only small differences between both test drugs (DM450 for fenofibrate, DM517 for simvastatin) in patients with type IIa because simvastatin had higher response rates which, in part, compensated for the higher acquisition cost. However, response rates in patients with type IIb hyperlipidaemia were higher for fenofibrate, which led to a substantial cost advantage for this agent (DM768 for fenofibrate, DM2080 for simvastatin). These results were confirmed by various sensitivity analyses, including the assessment of drug monitoring programmes (postmarketing surveillance) to validate response rates and the total costs of the therapy. In this study, we evaluated the total costs of a 12-week period of therapy, not the costs per day. The results are based on actual clinical data and not just on theoretical models. The study underlines the necessity to differentiate between the types of hyperlipidaemia when performing a pharmacoeconomic analysis of lipid-lowering treatments.", 
    "139": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors effectively reduce cholesterol levels, and this is associated with a lower rate of cardiovascular events. Some HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are more effective than others in reducing low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and such drugs should help patients achieve LDL cholesterol targets prescribed by the National Cholesterol Education Panel (NCEP). This paper describes the design of a trial comparing the clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness of four HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in reducing LDL cholesterol to specified targets. This trial is being conducted in 30 physicians' practices in the USA. Its primary aim is to assess the resource use required to achieve and maintain NCEP targets by all patients randomised and followed up for one year."
