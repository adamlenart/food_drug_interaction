    "0": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the difference in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics between extended-release (ER) fluvastatin tablet and its immediate-release (IR) capsule in Chinese healthy subjects. This was an open-label, single/multiple-dose, two-period, two-treatment, crossover, randomized trial with a minimum washout period of 7 days. Twenty healthy male adult subjects were given fluvastatin ER tablet 80\u2009mg QD by oral administration or fluvastatin IR capsule 40\u2009mg BID for seven days. Blood samples were collected up to 24 hours after dosing on day 1 and day 7. Serum concentrations of fluvastatin were determined by LC-MS/MS. For fluvastatin ER tablet 80\u2009mg QD, C(max) was 61.0 \u00b1 39.0 and 63.9 \u00b1 29.7\u2009ng/mL, and AUC(0-24\u2009h) was 242 \u00b1 156 and 253 \u00b1 91.1 ng\u00b7h/mL on day 1 and 7, respectively. For fluvastatin IR capsule 40\u2009mg BID, C(max) was 283 \u00b1 271 and 382 \u00b1 255\u2009ng/mL, and AUC(0-24\u2009h) was 720 \u00b1 776 and 917 \u00b1 994\u2009ng\u00b7h/mL on day 1 and day 7, respectively. The relative bioavailability of fluvastatin ER tablet 80\u2009mg QD to fluvastatin IR capsule 40\u2009mg BID is (45.3 \u00b1 23.9)% and (43.3 \u00b1 24.1)% on day 1 and day 7, respectively. T(max) for fluvastatin ER tablet was 2.50 and 2.60\u2009h and for capsule was 0.78 and 0.88\u2009h on day 1 and day 7, respectively. In the first period, compared to baseline, cholesterol decreased 15.3% in fluvastatin ER tablet 80\u2009mg QD and 16.9% in fluvastatin IR capsule 40\u2009mg BID. Triglyceride decreased 3.7% in fluvastatin ER tablet 80\u2009mg QD and 19.1% in fluvastatin IR capsule 40\u2009mg BID. The difference has no statistical significance at P > 0.05 in reduction percent of cholesterol and triglyceride between the two groups. No adverse events were recorded. The results indicated that C(max) of fluvastatin ER tablet is reduced and T(max) is prolonged compared with IR capsule. There is no accumulation for ER formulation after multiple doses.", 
    "1": "PCSK9 proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type (PCSK9) is a crucial protein in LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) metabolism by virtue of its pivotal role in the degradation of the LDL receptor. In recent years, both in vitro and in vivo studies have greatly supplemented our understanding of the (patho)physiological role of PCSK9 in human biology. In the current review, we summarize studies published or in print before May 2012 concerning the physiological role of PCSK9 in cholesterol metabolism. Moreover, we briefly describe the clinical phenotypes encountered in carriers of mutations in the gene encoding PCSK9. As PCSK9 has emerged as a novel target for LDL-C lowering therapy, methods to inhibit PCSK9 will also be reviewed. Initial data from investigations of PCSK9 inhibition in humans are promising and indicate that PCSK9 inhibition may be a viable new therapeutic option for the treatment of dyslipidemia and associated cardiovascular diseases.", 
    "2": "Cerebral hypoperfusion due to impaired bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO) synthesized by endothelial nitric oxide synthase and neuronal nitric oxide synthase leads to cognitive decline and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Risk factors for endothelial dysfunction, such as inadequate lifestyle, cardiovascular/metabolic diseases, and aging, evokes cerebral hypoperfusion, impaired autoregulation, and increased production of amyloid-\u03b2 peptides (A\u03b2) in association with vasculogenic memory loss and dementia. Decrease in parasympathetic nitrergic nerve activity also plays a role in cerebral hypoperfusion. A\u03b2 is a functional obstacle to NO-mediated vasodilatation; therefore, it decreases cerebral blood flow. Generation of reactive oxygen species by A\u03b2 is a major action in promoting NO degradation. Effective strategies for the prophylaxis or treatment of AD includes acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, drugs acting on the NO-cyclic GMP signaling pathway, antioxidants, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b3-agonists, and hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors. Here our hypothesis about the mechanisms underlying the actions of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in relation to NO-mediated cerebral blood flow is presented. Future detailed analyses of the relationship between cerebral blood flow regulation by constitutive NO and cognitive decline/neurodegeneration will provide clues for developing novel prophylactic measures and therapeutic means to alleviate AD.",

Many genes involved in the pharmacodynamic pathway of statins have been part of pharmacogenetic research in patients with hypercholesterolemia, with an emphasis on genes involved in the cholesterol pathway. The present study was carried out with an aim to evaluate the association between the genetic variants of lipoprotein lipase gene [HindIII (+/+)/HindIII (-/-)], multiple drug resistance gene (C3435T) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene (4a/4b) with clinical outcome including an increased risk of recurrent stroke or death in ischemic stroke patients on atorvastatin therapy. 525 stroke patients and 500 healthy controls were involved in the study. Follow-up telephone interviews were conducted with patients post-event to determine stroke outcome. Blood samples were collected and genotypes determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction digestion technique. A significant association of MDR1 and LPL gene variants with bad outcome in stroke patients on atorvastatin therapy was found. However, there was no significant association of 27\u00a0bp VNTR polymorphism of eNOS gene with outcome. MDR analysis was carried out to analyze gene-gene interaction involving these gene variants contributing to clinical outcome of patients on stratin therapy but no significant interaction between these variants was observed. In conclusion the individuals with HindIII (-/-) genotype of LPL and CC genotype of MDR1 gene would benefit more from atorvastatin therapy.",

Immunohistochemical studies revealed that vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) are a major component of the neointima. The percentage of cells positive for proliferating cell nuclear antigen and Mac-3-positive immunostaining intensity within the intima of vein grafts was significantly lower in the pravastatin-treated group than in the control group. We separated VSMCs from mouse inferior vena cava and collected peritoneal macrophage from mice injected intraperitoneally with 4% thioglycollate. Pravastatin significantly decreased VSMC proliferation and platelet-derived growth factor-induced VSMC migration and, in a dose-dependent manner, inhibited macrophage migration induced by monocyte chemotactic protein-1.",

The separated monocytes underwent flow cytometry analysis to evaluate the expression levels of the cell membrane adhesion molecules: CD18, CD11a/b/c, and very late antigen-4. Endothelial cell function was assessed by adding monocytes to an endothelial monolayer on ECIS arrays and coculturing overnight. Peak changes in transendothelial electrical resistance were measured and compared between patient groups.",

There was no significant difference between risk factors among PVD and AAA patients except for age, where AAA patients were significantly older than PVD patients in both flow cytometry and ECIS groups (P=0.02 and 0.01, respectively). There were significantly higher levels of adhesion molecules CD11a, CD18, and CD11c (averaged mean fluorescent intensity P values: 0.047, 0.038, and 0.014, respectively) in PVD patients compared with AAA patients. No significant difference was found for CD11b and very late antigen-4 expression (P=0.21 and 0.15, respectively).

We used a gas chromatography-time-of-flight mass-spectrometry-based metabolomics platform to evaluate global effects of simvastatin on intermediary metabolism. Analyses were conducted in 148 participants in the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics study who were profiled pre and six weeks post treatment with 40 mg/day simvastatin: 100 randomly selected from the full range of the LDL-C response distribution and 24 each from the top and bottom 10% of this distribution (\"good\" and \"poor\" responders, respectively). The metabolic signature of drug exposure in the full range of responders included essential amino acids, lauric acid (p<0.0055, q<0.055), and alpha-tocopherol (p<0.0003, q<0.017). Using the HumanCyc database and pathway enrichment analysis, we observed that the metabolites of drug exposure were enriched for the pathway class amino acid degradation (p<0.0032). Metabolites whose change correlated with LDL-C lowering response to simvastatin in the full range responders included cystine, urea cycle intermediates, and the dibasic amino acids ornithine, citrulline and lysine. These dibasic amino acids share plasma membrane transporters with arginine, the rate-limiting substrate for nitric oxide synthase (NOS), a critical mediator of cardiovascular health. Baseline metabolic profiles of the good and poor responders were analyzed by orthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis so as to determine the metabolites that best separated the two response groups and could be predictive of LDL-C response. Among these were xanthine, 2-hydroxyvaleric acid, succinic acid, stearic acid, and fructose. Together, the findings from this study indicate that clusters of metabolites involved in multiple pathways not directly connected with cholesterol metabolism may play a role in modulating the response to simvastatin treatment.",

We, therefore, examined the association between statin use and risk of breast cancer by conducting a detailed meta-analysis of all observational studies published regarding this subject. PubMed database and bibliographies of retrieved articles were searched for epidemiological studies published up to January 2012, investigating the relationship between statin use and breast cancer. Before meta-analysis, the studies were evaluated for publication bias and heterogeneity. Combined relative risk (RR) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a random-effects model (DerSimonian and Laird method). Subgroup analyses, sensitivity analysis, and cumulative meta-analysis were also performed. A total of 24 (13 cohort and 11 case-control) studies involving more than 2.4 million participants, including 76,759 breast cancer cases contributed to this analysis. We found no evidence of publication bias and evidence of heterogeneity among the studies. Statin use and long-term statin use did not significantly affect breast cancer risk (RR = 0.99, 95 % CI = 0.94, 1.04 and RR = 1.03, 95 % CI = 0.96, 1.11, respectively). When the analysis was stratified into subgroups, there was no evidence that study design substantially influenced the effect estimate. Sensitivity analysis confirmed the stability of our results. Cumulative meta-analysis showed a change in trend of reporting risk of breast cancer from positive to negative in statin users between 1993 and 2011. Our meta-analysis findings do not support the hypothesis that statins' have a protective effect against breast cancer. More randomized clinical trials and observational studies are needed to confirm this association with underlying biological mechanisms in the future.",

We found that IR combined with MP showed increased therapeutic efficacy when compared with either treatment alone in PC-3 cells. In addition, the combined treatment enhanced DNA damage and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The combined treatment induced primarily autophagy in PC-3 cells, and the cell death that was induced by the combined treatment was chiefly the result of inhibition of the Akt/mTOR signaling pathways. In an in vivo study, the combination treatment showed greater anti-tumor growth effects.

A prospective, open label, randomized, parallel design study, with blinded endpoints, included 116 subjects. We compared the effects of a 12-week treatment with 40 mg rosuvastatin or the combination of 40 mg simvastatin/10 mg ezetimibe on markers of cholesterol absorption (campesterol and \u03b2-sitosterol), synthesis (desmosterol), and their ratios to cholesterol. Both therapies similarly decreased total and LDL cholesterol, triglycerides and apolipoprotein B, and increased apolipoprotein A1 (P < 0.05 vs baseline for all). Simvastatin/ezetimibe increased plasma desmosterol (P = 0.012 vs baseline), and decreased campesterol and \u03b2-sitosterol (P < 0.0001 vs baseline for both), with higher desmosterol (P = 0.007) and lower campesterol and \u03b2-sitosterol compared to rosuvastatin, (P < 0.0001, for both).

The emotional status of the animals was evaluated by elevated plus-maze and modified forced swimming tests, whereas cognitive performance was assessed by a Morris water maze task. Morphological changes in the hippocampus were examined by design-based stereology. HFD exposure significantly increased blood serum triglycerides without altering cholesterol levels relative to the controls. After four weeks of oral SMV (5 mg/kg) administration, serum triglycerides reverted to the control level. SMV caused significant anxiolytic, antidepressant-like, and nootropic effects in animals fed the standard diet. In the HFD group, enhanced anxiety and depression, and reduced cognitive performances of animals were reversed by SMV treatment. Although a total volume estimation of the hippocampal subfields indicated no significant change among the groups, the total number of pyramidal neurons decreased significantly in animals fed the HFD; following SMV treatment, this detrimental effect was reversed. In conclusion, chronic SMV administration has significant therapeutic potential for the treatment of affective and cognitive disorders with or without altering the serum lipid profiles.",

The present study was designed to assess the effect of repeated exposure of PM(10) on the turnover and release of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) from the bone marrow into the circulation and the effect of lovastatin on the PM(10)-induced bone marrow stimulation. Rabbits exposed to PM(10)three times a week for 3 wk, were given a bolus of 5'-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine to label dividing cells in the marrow to calculate the transit time of PMNs in the mitotic or postmitotic pool. PM(10) exposure accelerated the turnover of PMNs by shortening their transit time through the marrow (64.8 \u00b1 1.9 h vs. 34.3 \u00b1 7.4 h, P < 0.001, control vs. PM(10)). This was predominantly due to a rapid transit of PMNs through the postmitotic pool (47.9 \u00b1 0.7 h vs. 21.3 \u00b1 4.3 h, P < 0.001, control vs. PM(10)) but not through the mitotic pool. Lovastatin delayed the transit time of postmitotic PMNs (38.2 \u00b1 0.5 h, P < 0.001 vs. PM(10)) and shifted the postmitotic PMN release peak from 30 h to 48 h. PM(10) exposure induced the prolonged retention of newly released PMNs in the lung, which was reduced by lovastatin (P < 0.01). PM(10) exposure increased plasma interleukin-6 levels with significant reduction by lovastatin (P < 0.01). We conclude that lovastatin downregulates the PM(10)-induced overactive bone marrow by attenuating PM(10)-induced systemic inflammatory responses.", 
    "68": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, or statins, are widely used as cholesterol-lowering agents in the treatment of dyslipidemias. Statins have also been reported to have pleiotropic effects, independent of their effects on cholesterol synthesis, possibly through inhibition of the monomeric G proteins Ras and Rho, which are able to signal through ERK and Rho kinase activities, respectively. We have previously demonstrated that inhibition of ERK activation enhances \u03b2-adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilatation in the porcine isolated coronary artery. As statins can also inhibit ERK activation, the initial aim of this study was to determine whether statins have a similar influence on \u03b2-adrenoceptor-evoked vasodilatation. Segments of porcine distal coronary artery were mounted in a Mulvany wire myograph and bathed in Krebs-Henseleit buffer gassed with 95% O(2)/5% CO(2) and maintained at 37 \u00b0C. Tissues were pre-contracted with the thromboxane mimetic U46619 prior to cumulative concentration-response curves to the \u03b2-adrenoceptor agonist salbutamol in the absence or presence of simvastatin (1, 5 or 10 \u03bcM), pravastatin (10 \u03bcM), or lovastatin (10 \u03bcM). Simvastatin inhibited the salbutamol-induced relaxation of the coronary artery. Similar effects were seen with lovastatin, but not pravastatin or the sodium salt of simvastatin. Simvastatin, but not pravastatin also inhibited the relaxations to the Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel opener NS1619 and the K(ATP) channel opener pinacidil. Unexpectedly, these data indicate that, rather than enhancing \u03b2-adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilatation, lipophilic statins impair these responses. This is likely to be due to effects on K(+) channels.",

Both vitamin D(3) and 1, 25-dihydroxyviatmin-D(3) (calcitriol) had beneficial effects in EAE/MS. However, the exact cause of vitamin D deficiency in EAE/MS is not clear. Previously, we documented that lovastatin (LOV) provides protection in EAE animals via inhibition of RhoA-ROCK signaling. Herein, we demonstrate that LOV prevents the lowering of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin-D(3) and 1,25-dihydroxyviatmin-D(3) levels including 1,25-dihydroxyviatmin-D(3) levels in the peripheral lymphoid organs and CNS of treated EAE animals. These effects of LOV were attributed to enhanced expression of vitamin D synthesizing enzyme (1\u03b1-hydroxylase) in kidney and the CNS, with corresponding reduction of vitamin D catabolizing enzyme (24-hydorxylase) expression in the CNS of EAE animals via inhibition of RhoA-ROCK signaling. Ex vivo and in vitro studies established that autoreactive Th1/Th17 cells had higher expression of 24-hydroxylase than Th2/T regulatory cells, that was reverted by LOV or ROCK inhibitor. Interestingly, LOV-mediated regulation of vitamin D metabolism had improved vitamin D(3) efficacy to confer protection in EAE animals and that was ascribed to the LOV- and calcitriol-induced immunomodulatory synergy. Together, these data provide evidence that interfering with RhoA-ROCK signaling in autoreactive Th1/Th17 cells can improve vitamin D(3) efficacy in clinical trials of MS and related neurodegenerative disorders.",

In the last decade, several randomized controlled studies have demonstrated the benefit of statins in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). These studies showed that use of statins in patients with ACS is associated with a significant reduction of the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events. Current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) guidelines recommend (Level of Evidence 1A) the use of statin therapy before hospital discharge for all patients with ACS regardless of the baseline low-density lipoprotein. Although there is no consensus on the preferable time of administration of statins during ACS, some clinical trials and pooled analyses provided substantial support for the institution of an early initiation to improve strategies that target the pathophysiologic mechanism operating during myocardial infarction. In particular, recent findings suggested that the earlier the treatment is started after the diagnosis of ACS the greater the expected benefit. Experimental studies with statins in ACS have shown several other effects that could extend the clinical benefit beyond the lipid profile modification itself. In particular, statins demonstrated the ability to induce anti-inflammatory effects, modulate endothelium and inhibit the thrombotic signaling cascade. Given these recognized potential benefit, statins should conceivably modulate the pathophysiological processes involved in the very early phase of plaque rupture and coronary thrombosis.", 
    "95": "Neuro-inflammation and oxidative stress plays a key role in the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease (PD). Studies demonstrated that neuro-inflammation and associated infiltration of inflammatory cells into central nervous system are inhibited by 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl co-enzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors. Based on these experimental evidences, the present study has been designed to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (atorvastatin and simvastatin) against 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) induced unilateral lesion model of PD. In the present study, the animals were divided into nine groups (n=15 per group). Group I: Naive (without treatment); Group II: Sham (surgery performed, vehicle administered); Group III: Atorvastatin (20mg/kg); Group IV: Simvastatin (30 mg/kg); Group V: Control [Intrastriatal 6-OHDA (20 \u03bcg; single unilateral injection)]; Groups VI and VII: 6-OHDA (20 \u03bcg)+atorvastatin (10mg/kg and 20mg/kg) respectively; Groups VIII and IX: 6-OHDA (20 \u03bcg)+simvastatin (15 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg) respectively. Intrastriatal administration of 6-OHDA (20 \u03bcg; 4 \u03bcl of 5 \u03bcg/\u03bcl) significantly caused impairment in body weight, locomotor activity, rota-rod performance, oxidative defense and mitochondrial enzyme complex activity, and increase in the inflammatory cytokine levels (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6) as compared to naive animals. Atorvastatin (20mg/kg) and simvastatin (30 mg/kg) drug treatment significantly improved these behavioral and biochemical alterations restored mitochondrial enzyme complex activities and attenuated neuroinflammatory markers in 6-OHDA (20 \u03bcg) treated animals as compared to control group. The findings of the present study demonstrate the neuroprotective potential of statins in experimental model of 6-OHDA induced Parkinson like symptoms.",

The fact that NAFLD might progress from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis and cirrhosis showed that NAFLD is not always a benign disorder. NAFLD has many etiological factors, but the majority of cases are those in the context of metabolic syndrome, known as primary NAFLD. Statins are well known as 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) inhibitors, but this class has also pleiotropic actions non-related with HMG-CoA inhibition. Particularly, the possible anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrinogenesis qualities make statins an option in NAFLD. So, regarding the statins treatment in NAFLD, there are two aspects that are important. First of all, if statins (that are essential in the therapy for the improvement of cardiovascular risk) are safe at patients with NAFLD, given their adverse effect of increasing hepatic transaminases. Secondly, considering the strong associations between NAFLD and metabolic syndrome components, like obesity and insulin resistance, if statins could be a therapeutic option for the patients with NAFLD in the absence of dyslipidemia.",

    "152": "Patients with diabetes mellitus might be at a higher risk of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin)-induced myotoxicity, possibly because of reduced clearance of the statin lactone. The present study was designed to investigate the effect of diabetes on the biotransformation of atorvastatin acid, both in vivo in nondiabetic and diabetic renal transplant recipients, and in vitro in human liver samples from nondiabetic and diabetic donors.", 
    "153": "A total of 312 plasma concentrations of atorvastatin acid and atorvastatin lactone, from 20 nondiabetic and 32 diabetic renal transplant recipients, were included in the analysis. Nonlinear mixed-effects modelling was employed to determine the population pharmacokinetic estimates for atorvastatin acid and atorvastatin lactone. In addition, the biotransformation of these compounds was studied using human liver microsomal fractions obtained from 12 nondiabetic and 12 diabetic donors.", 
    "154": "In diabetic patients, the plasma concentration of atorvastatin lactone was significantly higher than that of atorvastatin acid throughout the 24-hour sampling period. The optimal population pharmacokinetic model for atorvastatin acid and atorvastatin lactone consisted of a two- and one-compartment model, respectively, with interconversion between atorvastatin acid and atorvastatin lactone. Parent drug was absorbed orally with a population estimate first-order absorption rate constant of 0.457 h(-1). The population estimates of apparent oral clearance (CL/F) of atorvastatin acid to atorvastatin lactone, intercompartmental clearance (Q/F), apparent central compartment volume of distribution after oral administration (V(1)/F) and apparent peripheral compartment volume of distribution after oral administration (V(2)/F) for atorvastatin acid were 231 L/h, 315 L/h, 325 L and 4910 L, respectively. The population estimates of apparent total clearance of atorvastatin lactone (CL(M)/F), apparent intercompartmental clearance of atorvastatin lactone (Q(M)/F) and apparent volume of distribution of atorvastatin lactone after oral administration (V(M)/F) were 85.4 L/h, 166 L/h and 249 L, respectively. The final covariate model indicated that the liver enzyme lactate dehydrogenase was related to CL/F and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was related to Q/F. Importantly, diabetic patients have 3.56 times lower CL(M)/F than nondiabetic patients, indicating significantly lower clearance of atorvastatin lactone in these patients. Moreover, in a multivariate population pharmacokinetics model, diabetes status was the only significant covariate predicting the values of the CL(M)/F. Correspondingly, the concentration of atorvastatin acid remaining in the microsomal incubation was not significantly different between nondiabetic and diabetic liver samples, whereas the concentration of atorvastatin lactone was significantly higher in the samples from diabetic donors. In vitro studies, using recombinant enzymes, revealed that cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 is the major CYP enzyme responsible for the biotransformation of atorvastatin lactone.", 
    "155": "These studies provide compelling evidence that the clearance of atorvastatin lactone is significantly reduced by diabetes, which leads to an increased concentration of this metabolite. This finding can be clinically valuable for diabetic transplant recipients who have additional co-morbidities and are on multiple medications.", 
    "156": "In this review, we describe a rat model for chemically induced hepatocarcinogenesis that can be used for studying the anticarcinogenic effects of different agents. In this model the process of carcinogenesis can be followed through the different stages of initiation, promotion and progression. Mechanistic studies of anticarcinogenic agents can be carried out and two examples are given by studies on selenium and statins as anticarcinogenic agents. These compounds suppress cancer via different mechanisms. In the case of selenium the induction of glutathione peroxidase 4 and inhibition of lipid peroxidation might be a part of the anticarcinogenic effect. In the case of statins, the inhibition of ubiquinone synthesis, as well as of the selenium-containing enzyme thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR1) might explain their anticarcinogenic properties. Interestingly, also in the case of selenium the inhibited carcinogenesis was associated with reduced TrxR activity, indicating an important role for this enzyme in carcinogenesis.", 
    "157": "The physiological function of the ATP-binding cassette G1 (ABCG1) transporter in humans is not yet elucidated, as no genetic disease caused by ABCG1 mutations has been documented. The goal of our study was, therefore, to investigate the potential role(s) of ABCG1 in lipid metabolism in humans.", 
    "158": "Here we report that among the 104 polymorphisms present in the ABCG1 gene, the analysis of the frequent functional rs1893590 and rs1378577 single nucleotide polymorphisms located in the regulatory region of ABCG1 in the Regression Growth Evaluation Statin Study population revealed that both ABCG1 single nucleotide polymorphisms were significantly associated with plasma lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity. Moreover, we observed that plasma LPL activity was modestly reduced in Abcg1(-/-) mice as compared with control mice. Adipose tissue and skeletal muscle are the major tissues accounting for levels and activity of plasma LPL in the body. However, beyond its lipolytic action in the plasma compartment, LPL was also described to act locally at the cellular level. Thus, macrophage LPL was reported to promote foam cell formation and atherosclerosis in vivo. Analysis of the relationship between ABCG1 and LPL in macrophages revealed that the knockdown of ABCG1 expression (ABCG1 knockdown) in primary cultures of human monocyte-derived macrophages using small interfering RNAs led to a marked reduction of both the secretion and activity of LPL. Indeed, LPL was trapped at the cell surface of ABCG1 knockdown human monocyte-derived macrophages, likely in cholesterol-rich domains, thereby reducing the bioavailability and activity of LPL. As a consequence, LPL-mediated lipid accumulation in human macrophage foam cells in the presence of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins was abolished when ABCG1 expression was repressed.", 
    "159": "We presently report that ABCG1 controls LPL activity and promotes lipid accumulation in human macrophages in the presence of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, thereby suggesting a potential deleterious role of macrophage ABCG1 in metabolic situations associated with high levels of circulating triglyceride-rich lipoproteins together with the presence of macrophages in the arterial wall.",

This study analyzed 8-year follow-up of STEMI patients enrolled in the Florence Acute Myocardial Infarction Registry, a population-based, observational study performed in Italy in 2000-2001.", 
    "161": "The prognostic effect of pPCI adjusted for clinical and demographic characteristics on a composite end-point of new myocardial infraction, urgent revascularization or death, and on all-cause mortality separately, was assessed in multivariable Cox analysis, calculating hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. This analysis is concerned with 875 STEMI patients (mean age 70.6\u200a\u00b1\u200a12.9 years), treated with pPCI (459) or conservatively (416).", 
    "162": "After 8 years, 59% of patients had experienced the composite end-point and 49% had died. The multivariable analysis showed a significantly better prognosis in patients receiving pPCI (hazard ratio 0.72, P\u200a=\u200a0.001), evident also in the 645 patients who were event-free after the first year of follow-up (hazard ratio 0.72, P\u200a=\u200a0.010). Other independent prognostic factors were advanced age, Killip class greater than 1, some cardiovascular or noncardiovascular comorbidities, in-hospital cardiogenic shock, ejection fraction less than 30%, and treatment with aspirin and statin during hospitalization. The beneficial effect of pPCI observed both in cases younger (adjusted hazard ratio 0.65, P\u200a=\u200a0.013) and older than 75 years (adjusted hazard ratio 0.65, P\u200a=\u200a0.001) was also confirmed considering as outcome all-cause mortality only.",

    "164": "Statin use may be limited by muscle side effects. Although incompletely understood to date, their pathophysiology may involve oxidative stress and impairments of mitochondrial function and of muscle Ca(2+) homeostasis. In order to simultaneously assess these mechanisms, 24 male healthy volunteers were randomized to receive either simvastatin for 80 mg daily or placebo for 8 weeks. Blood and urine samples and a stress test were performed at baseline and at follow-up, and mitochondrial respiration and Ca(2+) spark properties were evaluated on a muscle biopsy 4 days before the second stress test. Simvastatin-treated subjects were separated according to their median creatine kinase (CK) increase. Simvastatin treatment induced a significant elevation of aspartate amino transferase (3.38\u00b15.68 vs -1.15\u00b14.32 UI/L, P<0.001) and CK (-24.3\u00b199.1\u00b1189.3 vs 48.3 UI/L, P=0.01) and a trend to an elevation of isoprostanes (193\u00b1408 vs 12\u00b153 pmol/mmol creatinine, P=0.09) with no global change in mitochondrial respiration, lactate/pyruvate ratio or Ca(2+) sparks. However, among statin-treated subjects, those with the highest CK increase displayed a significantly lower Vmax rotenone succinate and an increase in Ca(2+) spark amplitude vs both subjects with the lowest CK increase and placebo-treated subjects. Moreover, Ca(2+) spark amplitude was positively correlated with treatment-induced CK increase in the whole group (r=0.71, P=0.0045). In conclusion, this study further supports that statin induced muscular toxicity may be related to alterations in mitochondrial respiration and muscle calcium homeostasis independently of underlying disease or concomitant medication.", 
    "165": "In the present study we investigated the protective effect of pravastatin (PRV) against mercury-induced cellular damage. Human erythrocytes were incubated with PRV, HgCl(2) and HgCl(2) pretreated with PRV. Our results revealed that incubation of erythrocytes with HgCl(2) induces a significant increase the ratios of superoxide dismutase/glutathione peroxidase (SOD/GPx), superoxide dismutase/catalase (SOD/CAT), oxidized/reduced glutathione (GSSG/GSH), malondialdehyde(MDA) and protein carbonyl(PCO) by 60%, 50%, 333%, 400% and 208% respectively. Whereas, prior incubation of erythrocytes with PRV maintains these parameters at values similar to control cells. Furthermore, the level of nitrite in erythrocytes decreases significantly on treatment with HgCl(2), whereas it remains similar to the control when pretreated with PRV. Also, there was an increase in erythrocytes hemolysis when treated with HgCl(2), whereas it remained the like to the control when pretreated with PRV. In conclusion, PRV pretreatment maintained the erythrocytes oxidant/antioxidant balance and nitrite level during mercury exposure. Consequently, PRV pretreatment is worthy of further investigation in the reduction of the cardiovascular risk of mercury.", 
    "166": "It has been studied in detail that cellular differentiation during chondrogenesis can be recapitulated in vitro by differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells as embryoid bodies (EBs). We here used this model system of cartilage development to analyze the effect of simvastatin, a potentially embryotoxic substance. Statins are a group of drugs used to treat hypercholesterolaemia. We found that simvastatin activated cartilage nodule formation during EB differentiation. Extended application of simvastatin resulted in enhanced expression of cartilage marker molecules and prolonged persistence of cartilage nodules. Expression of collagen type II was upregulated during simvastatin-induced chondrogenic ES cell differentiation as demonstrated by quantitative real time PCR. However, immunostaining for cartilage marker molecules revealed that cartilage nodules within simvastatin-treated EBs were defective, bearing cavities of cell loss. Furthermore, caspase activity was reduced in comparison to untreated controls indicating reduced apoptosis. Taken together, we may speculate that simvastatin prolongs survival of chondrocytes and disrupts cellular integrity of cartilage nodules during EB development by affecting apoptotic mechanisms. The study underlines that ES cell-derived EBs are a useful in vitro model to screen substances for their embryotoxic and teratogenic potential.", 
    "167": "Statin therapy is widely used across the globe for the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). It is well established that statin therapy is associated with significant decrease in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and plasma cholesterol levels.

    "169": "Dyslipidemia in patients with HIV is different from the normal population, due to the fact that HIV treatment may not only cause dyslipidemia, but may also interact with lipid lowering medication. Statin-unresponsive HIV-dyslipidemia can be treated with the addition of ezetimibe, fenofibrate, fish oil and niacin. Current guidelines recommend the use of pravastatin and atorvastatin as first-line therapy, whereas European guidelines include rosuvastatin. There is an urgent need to confirm whether the use of statins in HIV-dyslipidemia is associated with an increase in the incidence of diabetes; this is significant because HIV patients are known to be insulin-resistant. HIV is also associated with Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), a condition known to be associated with insulin resistance. Further clinical trials are urgently needed to assess the impact of statins on CVD in HIV patients, and future challenges for researchers in this area are enormous.",

The outcome was readmission within 2-30 days of discharge. The main independent variables were receipt of outpatient quality-of-care measures (i.e., two hemoglobin A1c tests, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) test, 90-day supply of statin, and 90-day supply of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers). Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine the impact of outpatient quality of care on hospital readmission while controlling for demographics, clinical characteristics, health care utilization, and insurance type in the year prior to admission.",

    "174": "Although it is still not clear whether elevated serum triglycerides are directly atherogenic or not, the results of many studies indicate that they are undoubtedly an important risk factor/biomarker for coronary heart disease (CHD). Therefore, targeting hypertriglyceridaemia should be beneficial for subjects at high risk for CHD. Elevated triglycerides are often accompanied with low HDL cholesterol, particularly in high risk patients with diabetes type 2 and/or metabolic syndrome. Such a disturbance is called atherogenic dyslipidaemia and has an increasing prevalence. The treatment of hypertriglyceridaemia has to be focused primarily on intensive lifestyle changes (weight reduction in obesity, reduction of alcohol consumption as well as reduction of added sugars, fructose and trans-fatty acids, regular aerobic physical activity) by which reduction of up to 50% in triglycerides can be achieved. Subjects with high CHD risk who cannot lower hypertriglyceridaemia by lifestyle measures should be treated with pharmacological therapy. The available medications include fibrates, niacin and prescription omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. If LDL cholesterol is elevated too, combination therapy is needed. Based upon recent studies in such patients a combination of a statin with fenofibrate and/or omega-3 fatty acids can be recommended.", 
    "175": "Bile secretion is essential for whole body sterol homeostasis. Loss-of-function mutations in specific canalicular transporters in the hepatocyte disrupt bile flow and result in cholestasis. We show that two of these transporters, ABCB11 and ATP8B1, are functional targets of miR-33, a micro-RNA that is expressed from within an intron of SREBP-2. Consequently, manipulation of miR-33 levels in vivo with adenovirus or with antisense oligonucleotides results in changes in bile secretion and bile recovery from the gallbladder. Using radiolabelled cholesterol, we show that systemic silencing of miR-33 leads to increased sterols in bile and enhanced reverse cholesterol transport in vivo. Finally, we report that simvastatin causes, in a dose-dependent manner, profound hepatotoxicity and lethality in mice fed a lithogenic diet. These latter results are reminiscent of the recurrent cholestasis found in some patients prescribed statins. Importantly, pretreatment of mice with anti-miR-33 oligonucleotides rescues the hepatotoxic phenotype. Therefore, we conclude that miR-33 mediates some of the undesired, hepatotoxic effects of statins.", 
    "176": "National guidelines recommend lipid-lowering therapy for patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), its equivalent (eg, diabetes mellitus, peripheral arterial disease, cerebrovascular disease), and those at high risk of CHD. Quality-of-care studies demonstrate that patients at high risk of CHD are undertreated. Overtreatment of patients at low risk of CHD remains relatively unexplored. Our study aimed to determine patient characteristics associated with under- and overtreatment of hyperlipidemia.", 
    "177": "We conducted a retrospective chart review of patients aged 35 to 80 years attending an inner-city ambulatory teaching clinic.

    "178": "Of 676 patients included, 46% were at high (>15% for 10 years) and 37% were at low (<5%) risk. Of the patients at high risk for CHD, 34% received no drug therapy, including 5% of patients with known CHD; 37% of patients with diabetes mellitus; and 59% of patients without CHD equivalents. Undertreatment was associated with lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL; odds ratio [OR] per 30 mg/dL 2.7, confidence interval [CI] 2.0-3.6), fewer risk factors (OR per risk factor 1.5 CI 1.1-2.1), and not receiving other preventive care interventions (OR 2.1, CI 1.0-4.5). Of 247 patients at low risk for CHD, 8% received drug therapy. Overtreatment was associated with higher LDL (OR per 30 mg/dL 3.0, CI 1.7-5.3) and more cardiac risk factors (OR per risk factor 3.1, CI 1.4-6.7). Age, race, sex, and specific risk factors were not associated with overtreatment or undertreatment.",

    "180": "The aim of this study was to identify the molecular mechanisms and biological pathways associated with the anticancer effects of atorvastatin. For this purpose, we conducted cell-based microarray and bioinformatic analyses to determine the effect of atorvastatin exposure on endothelial cell response. The results of bioinformatic analysis performed using the Connectivity Map (cMap) to examine the atorvastatin-induced changes in gene expression in the human umbilical vein endothelial cell line, EA.hy926, indicated that treatment with 10 \u00b5M of atorvastatin for 24 h upregulated the expression of 295 genes and downregulated the expression of 354 genes by 2-fold compared to the control treatment. The gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) pathway analysis, and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed that Kruppel-like factors (KLFs) and cell cycle-related genes were the genes most significantly affected by atorvastatin treatment. The upregulation of KLFs and the downregulation of the cell cycle-related genes, including cyclin (CCN)A2, CCNE2, CCNB1 and CCNB2, were validated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). A comparison of the gene expression profile of atorvastatin-treated cells with that of the control cells and with that of 6,100 compounds in the cMap database revealed that the profile of atorvastatin-treated cells was highly similar to that of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor-treated cells. Therefore, these results suggest that atorvastatin acts as an HDAC, a G1/S (start) and a G2/M (mitosis) cell cycle inhibitor. These findings provide evidence of the feasibility of the use of atorvastatin as an anticancer drug.", 
    "181": "Dyslipidaemia is a major risk factor of cardiovascular diseases, the role of serum total cholesterol (Chol) especially LDL-Chol is well established in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and ischemic heart disease. Use of cholesterol lowering drugs within the first 24 h of hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is associated with a lower rate of cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, cardiac arrest and recurrent myocardial infarction. We assessed data of 416 patients admitted to hospital with AMI in a 2 year period (2001-2003) focusing on statin therapy. We have not found a correlation between serum lipid parameters and mortality of patients with AMI. Chronic statin treatment used before AMI (in 36 patients) did not influence mortality of patients. Chol level of patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) was significantly higher (p = 0,043). Mortality of patients who did not receive statin treatment after AMI was significantly higher. These data highlight the importance of early aggressive statin treatment in patients with AMI and necessity of statins in patients with hypercholesterolaemia.", 
    "182": "Acute Coronary Syndromes (ACS) are a group of disorders caused by the significant reduction of circulation in coronary arteries. The most common reason of the dysfunction is a blood clot formed in place of plaque rupture. The role of scavenger receptors in development and progression of atherosclerosis has been confirmed in many animal experiments, however the knowledge about contribution of the receptors in the development of ACS symptoms in humans still remains insufficient. The aim of this work was to define the expression of two scavenger receptors: CD36 and MSR1 in monocytes of patients with ACS after the onset of symptoms and after the 6\u00a0months of treatment. The analysis of CD36 and MSR1 expression was carried out with the use of real-time PCR and flow cytometry. Analyses of lipid and glucose concentration in blood and the level of inflammatory markers in plasma were performed additionally for all ACS patients. All data obtained during the research were analyzed using statistical tests, such as Mann Whitney test, Wilcoxon test, or correlation. In all patients with symptoms of ACS the amount of CD36 and MSR1 mRNA in circulating monocytes, as well as the density of both receptors on the cells surface was significantly higher. Re-analysis of subjects after 6\u00a0months of treatment, showed a significant decrease in the CD36 and MSR1 expression in all patients who received atorvastatin. The results of presented studies demonstrate that both investigated receptors are involved in the development and/or progression of ACS.",

We studied in vitro the effect of extracellular LDL-cholesterol on the number of prostate epithelial cells and on the expression of key regulators of cholesterol metabolism. Two normal prostatic epithelial cell lines (P96E, P97E), two in vitro immortalized epithelial cell lines (PWR-1E, RWPE-1) and two cancer cell lines (LNCaP and VCaP) were grown in cholesterol-deficient conditions. Cells were treated with 1-50 \u00b5g/ml LDL-cholesterol and/or 100 nM simvastatin for seven days. Cell number relative to control was measured with crystal violet staining. Changes in mRNA and protein expression of key effectors in cholesterol metabolism (HMGCR, LDLR, SREBP2 and ABCA1) were measured with RT-PCR and immunoblotting, respectively. LDL increased the relative cell number of prostate cancer cell lines, but reduced the number of normal epithelial cells at high concentrations. Treatment with cholesterol-lowering simvastatin induced up to 90% reduction in relative cell number of normal cell lines but a 15-20% reduction in relative number of cancer cells, an effect accompanied by sharp upregulation of HMGCR and LDLR. These effects were prevented by LDL. Compared to the normal cells, prostate cancer cells showed high expression of cholesterol-producing HMGCR but failed to express the major cholesterol exporter ABCA1. LDL increased relative cell number of cancer cell lines, and these cells were less vulnerable than normal cells to cholesterol-lowering simvastatin treatment. Our study supports the importance of LDL for prostate cancer cells, and suggests that cholesterol metabolism in prostate cancer has been reprogrammed to increased production in order to support rapid cell growth."
