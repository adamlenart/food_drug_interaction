Evidence suggests that statin muscle toxicity may be mediated by abnormalities in lipid metabolism. To test the hypothesis that myotubes from patients intolerant of lipid-lowering therapies have abnormal fatty acid oxidation (FAO) responses we compared muscle from 11 subjects with statin intolerance (Intolerant) with muscle from seven statin-naive volunteers undergoing knee arthroplasty (Comparator). Gross muscle pathology was graded and skeletal muscle cell cultures were produced from each subject. FAO was assessed following treatment with increasing statin concentrations. There was no difference in muscle biopsy myopathy scores between the groups. Basal octanoate oxidation was greater in Intolerant than in Comparator subjects (P = 0.03). Lovastatin-stimulated palmitate oxidation tended to be greater for Intolerant compared to Control subjects' myotubes (P = 0.07 for 5 microM and P = 0.06 for 20 microM lovastatin). In conclusion abnormalities in FAO of Intolerant subjects appear to be an intrinsic characteristic of these subjects that can be measured in their cultured myotubes.",

To gain insight into the mechanism of statins on human T cells, we investigated the effects of both lovastatin and atorvastatin on activated human primary T cells. The human primary T cells from the blood of normal human beings were isolated. We found that lovastatin, but not atorvastatin, can dose-dependently inhibit cytokine production such as interleukin-2, interleukin-4, and interferon-gamma from activated human T cells. Neither lovastatin nor atorvastatin can regulate the TNF-alpha production on both activated human T cells and monocytes. Molecular investigation was performed that lovastatin, but not atorvastatin, could down-regulate both activator protein-1 and NF-kappaB DNA binding activities, assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay.

Instead, autophagic cell changes were observed regardless of the radiosensitivity of the cell line. An inhibitor of autophagy, 3-methyladenine suppressed the cytotoxic effect of irradiation with pitavastatin, indicating that autophagy is a result of an antitumor mechanism. Using the most radiosensitive A172 cell line, the intracellular localization of p50, a representative subunit of NF-kappaB, was evaluated through immunoblotting and immunofluorescence studies.

On the other hand, it has been demonstrated that fibrate agents decrease triglyceride levels more effectively compared to HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. A cost-effectiveness study comparing fenofibrate, a fibrate agent, and atorvastatin was therefore conducted in hypertriglyceridemia patients. Referring to an analytical method published in the UK, the percentage of patients received fenofibrate and atorvastatin treatments at each dose level was estimated from prescription records at the medical institutions investigated. Changes in the total cholesterol and triglyceride values after the drug administration were investigated examining published reports. Based on the said data, the treatment effectiveness was measured by the percentage of patients who achieved the target lipid levels. The treatment costs were estimated based on the number of patients investigated and reimbursement prices of the drugs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of fenofibrate in decreasing triglyceride levels was dominant over atorvastatin. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of atorvastatin in decreasing low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels was JPY 69911.

Measurements were performed in participants (n = 135) at baseline and after 6 weeks on either rosuvastatin (40 mg/day) or atorvastatin (80 mg/day) therapy. Plasma sterols were measured using gas-liquid chromatography. Rosuvastatin and atorvastatin significantly (P < 0.001) altered plasma total cholesterol (C) levels by -40%, and the ratios of lathosterol/C by -64% and -68%, and campesterol/C by +52% and +72%, respectively, with significant differences (P < 0.001) between the treatment groups for the latter parameter. When using absolute values of these markers, subjects with the greatest reductions in both synthesis (lathosterol) and absorption (campesterol) had significantly greater reductions in total C than subjects in whom the converse was true (-46% versus -34%, P = 0.001), with similar effects for LDL-C. Rosuvastatin and atorvastatin decreased markers of cholesterol synthesis and increased markers of fractional cholesterol absorption, with rosuvastatin having significantly less effect on the latter parameter than atorvastatin. In addition, alterations in absolute values of plasma sterols correlated with the cholesterol lowering response.", 
    "40": "The lipid hypothesis, the concept that cholesterol plays a causal role in atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease, has been the subject of a controversy which started in the 1950s, peaked in the 1970s and 80s and then subsided in the 1990s. It was finally resolved by the positive outcome of the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study, the first of 14 prevention trials using statins which showed that lowering cholesterol reduced both cardiovascular events and total mortality. This commentary focuses primarily on the events and people involved in the cholesterol controversy in Britain. The foremost critics of the lipid hypothesis are now deceased but unfortunately for many of the patients with hypercholesterolaemia and coronary heart disease it took the best part of 50 years to disprove the sceptics. This brief account relates why it took so long.", 
    "41": "Although some data suggest that statins can improve cardiac mechanical function in some patients with chronic heart failure (CHF), the effects of long-term statin therapy on cardiac electrical instability remain unclear. We performed a randomized perspective analysis of the effects of 10 mg/d (statin group 1, n=40), 20 mg/d (statin group 2, n=38) of atorvastatin and controls (control group, n=41) on corrected QT intervals (QTc), corrected QT dispersion (QTcd) and cardiac function in patients with CHF secondary to coronary artery disease (CAD) for one year. At 6 and 12 months, the statin groups displayed lower QTc and QTcd compared with controls. The changes were becoming more distinct in statin group 2, (P<0.05). In statin groups, the changes of QTc and QTcd were independent of changes of plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and total cholesterol levels, and the decrease of QTcd was correlated with the increase of LVEF within 12 months. Atorvastatin shortens QTc, QTcd and improves cardiac function, and might thereby be parts of the mechanisms which atorvastatin benefited CHF patients secondary to CAD.",

Recently, 3-Hydroxy-3-methyl-gutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) have been reported to be immunomodulatory besides lowering serum cholesterol level. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of statins on composite tissue allografts and T lymphocyte in vivo and in vitro. Rats were divided into 5 groups: syngeneic transplantation group (Lewis-Lewis); allogeneic control group (Brown Norway-Lewis, no treatment); low-dose statins group (15 mg /kg); high-dose statins group (30 mg /kg) and cyclosporin A group. In vivo, treatment of statins significantly prolonged allografts survival as compared to control group. Histological findings further supported these clinical results and demonstrated less extent of rejection. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that there was a remarkably reduced T cells infiltration in statins groups. Moreover, the serum levels of IL-2 and IFN-gamma were decreased after statins therapy, while these in control group increased significantly. Meanwhile, transcriptional activities of IL-2 and IFN-gamma were also dramatically down-regulated after statins treatment. In vitro, mixed lymphocyte reaction assay was performed and the results revealed lymphocyte proliferation was inhibited by statins in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, administration of statins exhibited inhibitory effects on CD3/CD28 mediated T cell activation and proliferation. Besides, the results demonstrated that statins significantly down-regulated mRNA expression and suppress cytokine production of IL-2 and IFN-gamma in vitro. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that application of statins could induce immunosuppressive effect and prolong allografts survival through inhibiting activation and proliferation of T cell and reducing production of IL-2 and IFN-gamma.",

The effect of various Rho inhibitors on the biological behavior of ovarian cancer cells in vitro and in vivo was also examined. A stable RhoA-transfectant of an ovarian cancer cell line SKOV3 was generated and examined in vitro for alterations of proliferative activity and invasiveness, and also in the nude mice model for peritoneal dissemination. In addition, the effect of a specific Rho inhibitor (C3 exoenzyme), Rho kinase inhibitor (Y27632) and hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor (Lovastatin and Pravastatin) were studied in vitro and in vivo. Forced overexpression of RhoA did not alter proliferative activity but significantly increased the invasiveness in vitro, which was suppressed by addition of C3 exoenzyme, Y27834, Lovastatin and Pravastatin. In the nude mice model, the frequency of dissemination and the number of disseminated lesions were significantly increased in the RhoA transfectant than in the control. In addition, oral administration of Lovastatin significantly decreased the number of metastatic sites compared with the control. These findings suggest that upregulation and/or activation of RhoA play an important role in the peritoneal dissemination of ovarian carcinoma, and that Lovastatin might be a candidate for the possible, novel treatment for ovarian carcinoma patients with peritoneal dissemination.",

LXR were initially described as orphan receptors and later oxidized cholesterol derivatives (oxysterols) were identified as their natural ligands. In addition, several synthetic LXR agonists such as T0901317 and GW3965 were synthesized. Oxysterols are formed in amounts proportional to cholesterol content in the cell and therefore LXR operate as cholesterol sensors which protect from cholesterol overload by inhibiting intestinal cholesterol absorption, stimulating cholesterol efflux from cells to high-density lipoproteins (HDL), its transport to the liver, conversion to bile acids, and biliary excretion. In addition, LXR agonists activate fatty acid synthesis by stimulating the expression of a lipogenic transcription factor, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), leading to the elevation of plasma triglycerides and liver steatosis. Lipogenic effect seems is the most important negative feature of LXR agonists considered as potential hypolipidemic drugs. Some of currently used drugs also affect LXR signaling. For example, statins may impair LXR signaling by inhibiting oxysterol synthesis, whereas fibrates and thiazolidinediones increase LXR expression and activity.",

Other measurements included insulin resistance index using the homeostasis model of insulin resistance (HOMA(IR)), plasma lipids, and markers of inflammation. The FDRs were then randomized and treated with atorvastatin (80 mg) or placebo daily in a 4-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.

The purpose of this study was to analyze whether the antiatherogenic effect of statin therapy was not limited to its lipid lowering effect, but also included anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects, paying special attention to the measurement of circulating concentrations of anti-Hsp70 and anti-Hsp60 antibodies previously related to vascular disease. Two-hundred and seventy-five subjects aged 40-60 years, randomly selected in an epidemiological study on the incidence of vascular risk factors, were studied. Laboratory tests included a complete lipid profile after a 12-h fast and measurements of glucose, C-reactive-protein, anti-Hsp70 and anti-Hsp60 antibodies. Subjects with hypercholesterolemia had significantly higher concentrations of anti-Hsp70 antibodies as compared to subjects with normal cholesterol concentrations. Statin therapy was associated with 11.63 and 15.3% reductions in total and LDL-cholesterol (P = 0.005 and 0.017, respectively) as compared to untreated subjects, and with lower concentrations of circulating anti-Hsp70 (P = 0.016) antibodies. No differences were found in C-reactive-protein values. Since statin therapy not only reduces lipid profile, but also anti-Hsp70 and anti-Hsp60 antibody concentrations, without changing C-reactive-protein values, it is suggested that such an effect could not be accounted for by the anti-inflammatory properties of statins, but by their direct immunomodulatory properties through their effects on lymphocyte function.",

    "110": "Since previous studies have reported a beneficial effect of amlodipine and atorvastatin treatment in experimental atherosclerosis, we aimed to investigate the effect of the combination of both drugs on blood and plaque inflammation in patients with carotid stenosis. For that purpose, twenty six hypertensive patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy were randomized to receive either atorvastatin 20 mg/day alone (ATV, n=12) or in combination with amlodipine 20 mg/day (ATV+AML, n=14) before scheduled carotid endarterectomy. At the end of follow-up (4-6 weeks), there was a significant decrease in total and LDL-cholesterol levels, but not in blood pressure levels. In contrast, decreased MCP-1 plasma levels, NF-kappaB activation (EMSA) and MCP-1 mRNA expression (quantitative PCR) was only observed in blood from ATV+AML treated-patients. Moreover, carotid atherosclerotic plaques from ATV+AML group demonstrated a significant reduction in macrophage infiltration in relation to ATV group (immunohistochemistry). Our results suggest that combined treatment with atorvastatin and amlodipine decreases inflammatory status of atherosclerotic patients more than atorvastatin treatment alone, suggesting that co-administration of both drugs could have beneficial additive effects.",

We analyzed whether short-term treatment with atorvastatin affects soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L) plasma levels in subjects at high cardiovascular risk. sCD40L plasma concentrations were measured in 852 subjects from the Atorvastatin on Inflammatory Markers (AIM) Study, a 12-week prospective multicenter, open-label trial which enrolled statin-free subjects with coronary heart disease (CHD), CHD-equivalent (diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, or cerebrovascular disease), or a 10-year CHD risk >20%. Subjects were assigned to atorvastatin (10-80 mg/day) based on LDL-C at screening. Overall, sCD40L levels were not different in patients at high cardiovascular risk compared with healthy subjects. When sCD40L levels were divided in quartiles, patients in the highest quartile (N=213) had higher sCD40L concentrations than age- and gender-matched healthy subjects (N=29) (P<0.0001). Interestingly, all doses of atorvastatin significantly diminished sCD40L levels in subjects at the highest quartile. Furthermore, atorvastatin treatment decreased sCD40L more markedly in subjects with metabolic syndrome compared with those without metabolic syndrome. In conclusion, atorvastatin diminishes sCD40L plasma levels, more markedly so in subjects with metabolic syndrome. Our results indicate that short-term treatment with atorvastatin exhibits anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic effects in subjects at high cardiovascular risk.", 
    "112": "Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) show a high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. This seems to be consequence of the cardiovascular risk factor clustering in CKD patients. Non traditional risk factors such as oxidative stress and inflammation are also far more prevalent in this population than in normal subjects. Renal disease is associated with a graded increase in oxidative stress markers even in early CKD. This could be consequence of an increase in reactive oxygen species as well as a decrease in antioxidant defence. This oxidative stress can accelerate renal injury progression. Inflammatory markers such as C reactive protein and cytokines increase with renal function deterioration suggesting that CKD is a low-grade inflammatory process. In fact, inflammation facilitates renal function deterioration. Several factors can be involved in triggering the inflammatory process including oxidative stress. Statin administration is accompanied by risk reduction in all major vascular events in patients with CKD that are considered high-risk patients. These beneficial effects seem to be consequence of not only their hypolipidemic effect but especially their pleitropic actions that involve modulation of oxidative stress and inflammation.", 
    "113": "Lipid parameters are altered in the earliest stages of primary kidney disease, some even when measured glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is still normal. The main problem is that routinely measured lipid parameters are deceivingly normal except low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and moderately elevated triglycerides (TGs) (>150 mg per 100 ml). Behind this unimpressive spectrum, serious anomalies are hidden: increased very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and chylomicron remnants, accumulation of delipidated small dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL), post translational modification of lipoproteins, abnormal concentrations of Lp(a) and nonprotective HDL. A routine parameter with some predictive value is the concentration of non-HDL cholesterol. Several of these abnormal lipoprotein particles stimulate cellular free oxygen radical formation which in turn induce inflammation and impact on endothelial function.A bone of contention is the indication for treatment with statins in endstage renal disease. Poor survival is paradoxically predicted by low cholesterol. This appears to be the result of confounding by microinflammation. One controlled interventional study in hemodialysed type 2 diabetics, the 4-D study, failed to show a significant benefit on the primary cardiovascular endpoint. We discuss potential explanations for this 'negative' outcome and the implications for statin treatment.",

Fluvastatin (FV), used to reduce cholesterol levels, and lercanidipine (LER), used to control blood pressure, are marketed as racemic mixtures. Therapeutic activities are 30-fold higher for (+)-3R, 5S-FV and 100- to 200-fold higher for S-LER compared with their respective antipodes. The present study describes the enantioselective pharmacokinetic interaction between LER and FV in healthy volunteers. A crossover randomized study was conducted in 3 phases on 8 volunteers treated with a single oral racemic dose of LER (20 mg) or FV (40 mg) or LER plus FV. Serial blood samples were collected from 0 to 24 hours. Plasma concentrations of the LER and FV enantiomers were determined by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry, and pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated using the WinNonlin software. The Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney tests (P < .05) were used to analyze enantiomer ratios and the pharmacokinetic drug interaction. Data are expressed as medians. In monotherapy, the kinetic disposition of both FV and LER was enantioselective. AUC values were significantly higher for (-)-3S,5R-FV than for (+)-3R,5S-FV (358.20 vs 279.68 ng.h/mL) and for S-LER compared with R-LER (13.90 vs 11.88 ng.h/mL). The pharmacokinetic parameters of FV were not enantioselective when combined with LER (AUC: (-)-3S,5R-FV: 325.21; (+)-3R,5S-FV: 316.44 ng.h/mL). There was a significant reduction in S-LER (8.06 vs 13.90 ng.h/mL) and R-LER (6.76 vs 11.88 ng.h/mL) AUC values when FV was coadministered. In conclusion, the interaction between FV-LER might be clinically relevant because AUC values of (+)-3R,5S-FV were increased when LER was coadministered, and AUC values of the 2 LER enantiomers were reduced when FV was coadministered.",

However, the effects of cellular lipids on rotavirus assembly are still not fully understood. The present study analyzes the effects of lovastatin, an inhibitor of cholesterol biosynthesis, during rotavirus infection in MA104 cells with regard to viral growth and particle assembly. Following viral infection, a 2-log relative reduction of viral titers was observed in drug-treated cells, while viral mRNA levels in infected cells remained unaltered in both groups. Furthermore, the levels of some viral proteins in drug-treated cells were elevated. The observed discordance between the viral RNA and protein levels and the decrease in infectivity titers of viral progeny in the drug-treated cells suggested that the drug affects viral assembly, the viral proteins not being properly incorporated into virions. Transmission electron microscopic (TEM) analysis revealed that in drug-treated cells there was an increase in \"empty-looking\" rotavirus particles devoid of an electron-dense core as compared to the normal, electron-dense particles seen in untreated infected cells. The present study thus provides visual evidence of defective rotavirus particle assembly as a result of cholesterol depletion.",

Participants rated the relative importance of treatment consequences using visual analogue scales (VAS) and category rating scales (CRS) with five response options. We randomized participants to either VAS or CRS first and to one of six summary statistics: relative risk reduction (RRR) and five absolute measures of effect: absolute risk reduction, number needed to treat, event rates, tablets needed to take, and natural frequencies (whole numbers). We used logistic regression to determine the association between participants' elicited values and treatment choices. 770 participants age 18 or over and literate in English completed the study. In all, 13% in the VAS-first group failed to complete their VAS rating, while 9% of the CRS-first group failed to complete their scoring (p = 0.03). Different ways of weighting the elicited values had little impact on the analyses comparing the different presentations. Most (51%) preferred the RRR compared to the other five summary statistics (1% to 25%, p = 0.074).

Subjects treated with torcetrapib plus atorvastatin displayed higher postrandomization systolic blood pressure and plasma sodium and bicarbonate levels in conjunction with lower potassium levels. The decrease in potassium levels was associated with the blood pressure increase. Markedly, the use of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors tended to aggravate the blood pressure increase. Subjects receiving torcetrapib plus atorvastatin with the strongest low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction showed the smallest cIMT progression, whereas subjects with the highest systolic blood pressure increase showed the largest cIMT progression.

Male apoE(-/-) mice were placed on a 12-week high-fat diet supplemented with A-002 alone or combined with pravastatin. Atherosclerotic lesions were examined for size and composition using en face analysis, Movat staining, anti-CD68, and anti-alpha actin antibodies. Plasma lipids and PON activity were measured.

Pravastatin monotherapy had no effect on lesion size but when combined with A-002, decreased lesion area 50% and total cholesterol levels 18% more than A-002 alone. A-002, a sPLA2 inhibitor, acts synergistically with pravastatin to decrease atherosclerosis, possibly through decreased levels of systemic inflammation or decreased lipid levels. A-002 treatment also resulted in a profound increase in plasma PON activity and significantly larger fibrous caps, suggesting the formation of more stable plaque architecture.", 
    "145": "Ezetimibe represents the first of a new class of agents, the cholesterol absorption inhibitors, able to reduce low-density lipoproteins (LDL)-cholesterol by 15-25% from baseline in monotherapy and on top of statins and fibrates. To-date all the data regarding the efficacy of ezetimibe comes from the studies of its lipid-lowering power. Yet, recent findings from the ENHANCE study on atherosclerosis progression showed that the addition of ezetimibe to simvastatin in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia did not affect the mean change in carotid intima-media thickness, although a significant reduction in LDL-cholesterol levels was present. Therefore, we cannot exclude that ezetimibe is treating mainly LDL-cholesterol and not the underlying dyslipidemia. Reviewing all available evidences on the effects on atherogenic small, dense LDL, it seems that ezetimibe produce quantitative rather than qualitative changes in LDL, with small net effects on LDL subclass distribution. Yet, we cannot exclude that clinical and laboratory factors influenced this result. We found important differences in the methodology used to measure LDL size and subfractions and this represents a crucial point, since these methods cannot be fully used interchangeably. In addition, it is reasonable to imagine that ezetimibe may be more effective on small, dense LDL in subjects with hypertriglyceridemia. Further formal cardiovascular event outcome trials are underway and this will provide additional insights into the long-term effects of ezetimibe. Future prospective studies are also needed to clarify to which extent ezetimibe is able to reduce atherogenic dyslipidemia, beyond LDL-cholesterol levels.",

A teenager harboring the A3243G mutation had the unusual association of hereditary glomerulopathy and recurrent episodes of raised creatine kinase levels with the use of lipid-lowering agents. Muscle biopsy showed both normal respiratory chain enzyme activities and normal coenzyme Q(10) levels, although decreased muscle coenzyme Q(10) concentration had been postulated to have a pathogenic role in statin-related myopathies.

We identified 16 patients with the TF +5466AG genotype and 79 subjects with the +5466AA genotype. Baseline maximum rates of F1.2 and TAT formation and their maximum levels at the site of vascular injury, but not in venous blood, were higher in +5466G allele carriers than in those with +5466AA genotype (P<0.0001). The magnitude of reduction in maximum rates of F1.2 and TAT formation following simvastatin was larger (P<0.001) in +5466G allele carriers than in +5466AA subjects. The degree of decrease in maximum local levels of F1.2 and TAT after simvastatin was similar in both genotype groups. The presence of the +5466G allele was independently associated with the maximum velocity of F1.2 and TAT generation and maximum levels of both markers before and after simvastatin in multiple regression models (P<0.01 for all analyses).

Therefore, the present study was designed to evaluate the involvement of CRF receptor signaling against vascular inflammatory stress using human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs). In addition, due to the possible involvement of CRF receptor signaling in the effects of statin on endothelial cells, the effects of pitavastatin on the expression of UCN-related peptides in HAECs were also evaluated. HAECs expressed all UCNs, CRF type 1 receptor (CRF-R1), and CRF type 2 (CRF-R2)alpha and CRF-R2beta mRNAs. Real time PCR analysis revealed that UCN I mRNA was down-regulated, whereas UCN II mRNA was up-regulated by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Selective blockade of CRF-R1 resulted in significant increase in TNF-alpha-induced expression of vascular adhesion molecule-1 at mRNA level and E-selectin at mRNA and protein levels. Pitavastatin up-regulated UCN I mRNA without TNF-alpha, but co-incubation with pitavastatin and TNF-alpha resulted in decrease in UCN I mRNA. On the contrary, UCN II, CRF-R1, and CRF-R2 mRNAs were markedly increased by co-incubation of pitavastatin and TNF-alpha. These facts indicate that CRF-R1 signaling may have protective role against TNF-alpha-induced vascular inflammation. In addition, because of up-regulation of CRF-R1 mRNA by pitavastatin with or without TNF-alpha, CRF-R1 may be involved in the vasoprotective effects of pitavastatin.",

These compounds promoted the synthesis and evaluation of new inhibitors for HMGR, named HMGRIs. The high number of possible candidates creates the necessity of Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship models in order to guide the HMGRI synthesis. There are two main problems of the reported QSAR models: the homogeneous series of the compounds and the chirality of many candidates. In this work, we propose for the first time a QSAR model for a very large and heterogeneous series of HMGRIs. The model is based on the Topological Indices (TIs) of molecular structures. Using the predictions of this model as input, we construct the first complex network that describes the drug-drug similarity relationships for more than 1600 experimentally non-explored chiral HMGRIs isomers. We also presented a reduced version of this network (Giant Component) that contains the most representative set of chiral HMGRI candidates.

Both the unadjusted (0.8; 95% CI 0.6, 1.1) and adjusted ROR (0.7; 95% CI 0.6, 1.0) suggested a lower rate of reports of psychiatric events for statins as a whole class compared with all other drugs, although the difference was not significant. The five most frequently reported psychiatric events combined with statins were insomnia, somnolence, agitation, confusion and hallucination. Only insomnia was reported with higher frequency for statins compared with all other drugs (ROR = 3.3; 95% CI 1.9, 5.7), while confusion was reported with a lower frequency (ROR = 0.4; 95% CI 0.1, 0.9). Amongst statins available in Italy, only simvastatin (ROR = 0.5; 95% CI 0.2, 0.9) showed a significantly lower rate of reports of psychiatric events compared with all other drugs together.", 
    "163": "A relatively small number of possible statin-associated psychiatric ADRs have been found in our database. No significant risks for a higher overall reporting of psychiatric ADRs associated with statins were identified in comparison with all other drugs combined. However, statin-associated insomnia resulted in a significant ROR that requires further investigation.",

    "168": "Sixty-nine healthy men aged 18-60 years. Intervention. Subjects received either a loading dose of prasugrel 60 mg followed by a maintenance dose of 10 mg/day or a loading dose of clopidogrel 300 mg followed by 75 mg/day. The drug was given as monotherapy for 10 days, and after a 6-day run-in period with atorvastatin 80 mg/day, the same dosage of atorvastatin was continued with the respective thienopyridine for 10 days. A 14-day washout period separated the treatment regimens.", 
    "169": "Blood samples were collected before and at various time points after dosing on days 1 and 11 for determination of plasma concentrations of metabolites and for measurement of platelet aggregation induced by adenosine 5'-diphosphate 20 microM and vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (VASP). Coadministration of atorvastatin did not alter exposure to active metabolites of prasugrel or clopidogrel after the loading dose and thus did not alter inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA). During maintenance dosing, atorvastatin administration resulted in 17% and 28% increases in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) values of prasugrel's and clopidogrel's active metabolites, respectively. These small changes in AUC did not result in a significant change in IPA response to prasugrel but did result in a significant increase in IPA during clopidogrel maintenance dosing at some, but not all, of the time points on day 11. Coadministration of atorvastatin with either prasugrel or clopidogrel had no effect on VASP phosphorylation relative to the thienopyridine alone after the loading dose.", 
    "170": "Coadministration of atorvastatin 80 mg/day with prasugrel or clopidogrel did not negatively affect the antiplatelet response to either drug after a loading dose or during maintenance dosing. The lack of a clinically meaningful effect of high-dose atorvastatin on the pharmacodynamic response to prasugrel after the loading or maintenance dose indicates that no dosage adjustment should be necessary in patients receiving these drugs concomitantly.", 
    "171": "Atherosclerosis is a disease affecting arterial blood vessels due to the accumulation of macrophage white blood cells and low density lipoproteins. Effects of atorvastatin, a recently introduced lipid lowering statin was studied alone and in combination with clopidogrel in high fat diet fed atherosclerotic rats orally. Results showed significant reduction in total serum cholesterol and malondialdehyde levels and significant improvement in urine creatinine levels. Aortic cross sections of rats treated with clopidogrel alone showed reversal of atherosclerotic calcification. The same effect was observed with the combined treatment of clopidogrel and atorvastatin. Only atorvastatin treatment did not show any histological atheroprotective effect. Atorvastatin and clopidogrel alone and in combination have offered significant atheroprotective effect. No specific advantage was seen with combined treatment of atorvastatin and clopidogrel, moreover the advantages seen with independent drug administration also reduced with combined treatment.", 
    "172": "Mucus hypersecretion in the respiratory tract and goblet cell metaplasia in the airway epithelium contribute to the morbidity and mortality associated with airway inflammatory diseases. This study aimed to examine the effect and mechanisms of simvastatin on airway mucus hypersecretion in rats treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS).", 
    "173": "Mucus hypersecretion in rat airways was induced by intra-tracheal instillation of LPS. Rats treated with or without LPS were administered intra-peritoneally simvastatin (5 and 20 mg/kg) for 4 days. Expression of Muc5ac, RhoA and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) p38 in lung were detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunohistochemistry or Western blotting. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and IL-8 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were assayed by an enzyme-linked lectin assay and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).", 
    "174": "Simvastatin attenuated LPS-induced goblet cell hyperplasia in bronchial epithelium and Muc5ac hypersecretion at both the gene and protein levels in lung (P <0.05). Moreover, simvastatin inhibited neutrophil accumulation and the increased concentration of TNF-alpha and IL-8 in BALF follows LPS stimulation (P < 0.05). The higher dose of simvastatin was associated with a more significant reduction in Muc5ac mRNA expression, neutrophil accumulation and inflammatory cytokine release. Simultaneously, the increased expression of RhoA and p38 MAPK were observed in LPS-treated lung (P <0.05). Simvastatin inhibited the expression of RhoA and p38 phosphorylation in lung following LPS stimulation (P < 0.05). However, the increased expression of p38 protein in LPS-treated lung was not affected by simvastatin administration.", 
    "175": "Simvastatin attenuates airway mucus hypersecretion and pulmonary inflammatory damage induced by LPS. The inhibitory effect of simvastatin on airway mucus hypersecretion may be through, at least in part, the suppression of neutrophil accumulation and inflammatory cytokine release via inactivation of RhoA and p38 signaling pathway.",

    "177": "Sixty-two patients with acute coronary syndrome were included. Patients were allocated to low and high doses of atorvastatin according to baseline levels of cholesterol and triglycerides and the index of vascular risk and were studied at hospital admission and at 12 months. Cholesterol, triglycerides, total calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, osteocalcin and urinary deoxypyridinoline were determined in all patients at baseline and at 12 months of follow up. Densitometric studies were conducted in the lumbar spine and hip. Patients with a T-score<-2.5 were considered osteoporotic. The Lys656Asn leptin receptor gene polymorphism was determined by PCR.", 
    "178": "Forty-two patients were Lys/Lys homozygotic and 20 Lys/Asn heterozygotic. The prevalence of osteoporosis was 31% for the Lys/Lys genotype and 27% for the Lys/Asn genotype with no significant differences between groups. There was a significant increase in bone mineral density in the lumbar spine (1.117 +/- 0.24 versus 1.135 +/- 0.24, P = 0.008) in patients with the Lys/Lys genotype.",

    "180": "The lack of therapies that inhibit valvular calcification and the conflicting outcomes of clinical studies regarding the impact of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors on valve disease highlight the need for controlled investigations to characterize the interactions between HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and valve tissue. Thus, we applied multiple in vitro disease stimuli to valvular interstitial cell (VIC) cultures and examined the impact of simvastatin treatment on VIC function.", 
    "181": "VICs were cultured on 3 different substrates that supported various levels of nodule formation. Transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 was also applied as a disease stimulus to VICs on 2-D surfaces or encapsulated in 3-D collagen gels and combined with different temporal applications of simvastatin. Simvastatin inhibited calcific nodule formation in a dose-dependent manner on all materials, although the level of statin efficacy was highly substrate-dependent. Simvastatin treatment significantly altered nodule morphology, resulting in dramatic nodule dissipation over time, also in a substrate-dependent manner. These effects were mimicked in 3-D cultures, wherein simvastatin reversed TGF-beta1-induced contraction. Decreases in nodule formation were not achieved via the HMG-CoA reductase pathway, but were correlated with decreases in ROCK activity.", 
    "182": "These studies represent a significant contribution to understanding how simvastatin may impact heart valve calcification.", 
    "183": "Statins as hypocholesterolimic drugs have recently shown to have ant-inflammatory properties and thus are being assessed for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). Dietary phytosterols such as beta-sitosterol (SIT) are also hypocholesterolemic compounds and from preliminary studies they appear to have also anti-inflammatory properties. In this communication, we report on studies to investigate the immunomodulatory effects of SIT on proliferation and release of key cytokines from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of MS patients. In PBMC of MS patients, 16 microM SIT had no effect on cell proliferation; however simvastatin (SV) at 10 and 20 microM reduced cell proliferation by as much as 60%. SIT (4 microM) reduced TNF-alpha release by 24% in PBMC of MS patients whereas 10 microM SV reduced TNF-alpha release by 94%. SIT reduced IL-12 release in MS patients at 4 and 16 microM by 27% and 30%, respectively. In healthy subjects, 16 microM SIT increased the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 by 47% whereas 10 microM SV decreased IL-10 by 30%. In PBMC of MS patients, SIT had no effect on IL-10 release whereas 10 microM SV reduced IL-10 by 62%. SIT (4 microM) reduced IL-5 release by 47% in MS patients while 10 microM SV reduced IL-5 by 89%. The results show that SIT is effective in modulating the secretion of pro/anti-inflammatory cytokines and suggest a potential beneficial effect of SIT in MS management without the side effects associated with statin therapy.", 
    "184": "Nurse-led assessment/management of risk factors is effective in many chronic medical conditions. We aimed to evaluate whether this finding was true for patients with intermittent claudication and to analyze its impact on patient-reported quality of life and predicted mortality due to coronary heart disease. We prospectively studied a series of 78 patients (51 men; median age, 65 years [IQR: 56-74 years]), diagnosed with intermittent claudication and referred to a nurse-led risk assessment/management clinic (NLC) from a consultant-led vascular surgical clinic. The NLC used clinical care pathways to manage antiplatelet medication, smoking cessation, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes and to provide exercise advice. All patients were reassessed at a 3 months. Medication compliance, smoking status, fasting lipid profiles, blood pressure, and HbA1c were recorded. Disease-specific quality of life was assessed using King's College VascuQoL and predicted cardiac morbidity and mortality were calculated using the PROCAM and Framingham risk scores. We found that NLC enrollment produced an antiplatelet and a statin compliance of 100%, a smoking cessation rate of 17% (9 patients) and significant improvements in total cholesterol (median, 5.2-4.5 mmol/l), LDL (median, 3.1-2.5 mmol/l) and triglyceride (median, 1.7-1.4 mmol/l) levels. Significant disease-specific quality of life improvements and significant reduction in both the PROCAM (14% to 10%) and Framingham (14% to 11%) coronary risk scores were observed. Providing care at NLCs for claudicants is effective in assessing and managing risk factors, improves disease-specific quality of life and reduces predicted morbidity and mortality due to coronary heart disease."
