However, to what extent these guidelines are followed and their conditioning factors at different levels of the health care system are still insufficiently known. In January 2004, a decentralized drug budget was implemented in the county of Scania, Sweden. Focusing on lipid-lowering drugs (i.e., statins), we evaluated the effect of this intervention across a 25-month period. We expected that increased local economic responsibility would promote prescribing of recommended statins.", 
    "1": "We performed two separate multilevel regression analyses; on 110,827 individual prescriptions issued at 136 publicly-administered health care centres (HCCs) nested within 14 administrative areas (HCAs), and on 72,012 individual prescriptions issued by 115 privately-administered HCCs. Temporal trends in the prevalence of prescription of recommended statins were investigated by random slope analysis. Differences (i.e., variance) between HCCs and between HCAs were expressed by median odds ratio (MOR).", 
    "2": "After the implementation of the decentralized drug budget, adherence to guidelines increased continuously. At the end of the observation period, however, practice variation remained high. Prescription of recommended statins presented a high degree of clustering within both publicly (i.e., MORHCC = 2.18 and MORHCA = 1.31 respectively) and privately administered facilities (MORHCC = 3.47).", 
    "3": "A decentralized drug budget seems to promote adherence to guidelines for statin prescription. However, the high practice differences at the end of the observation period may reflect inefficient therapeutic traditions, and indicates that rational statin prescription could be further improved.", 
    "4": "The CD spectra of the pyrrole-imidazole alkaloids, (-)-dibromophakellin and (-)-dibromophakellstatin, have been calculated employing the quantum-chemical time-dependent density functional theory. Comparison of calculated and measured spectra showed that this well-established method is also a useful tool to elucidate the absolute stereochemistry of this class of compounds. The computational results have further been used to analyze the spectra measured in methanol and to explain the remarkable red shift of one CD band when trifluoroethanol is used as a solvent instead of methanol.", 
    "5": "Recent research has drawn attention to protective effects of statins on colorectal cancer (CRC) and possible joint effects with other drugs. Because statins are often administered in combination with low-dose aspirin for the prevention of cardiovascular disease, the aim of our study was to investigate individual and combined effects of statins and low-dose aspirin on CRC risk. We assessed use of statins and low-dose aspirin in 540 cases with histologically confirmed incident CRC and 614 control subjects in a population-based case-control study in Germany. Multiple logistic regression was used to estimate the impact of regular use of either low-dose aspirin or statins, and of both drugs combined on CRC risk. We found modest risk reduction of CRC for regular use of low-dose aspirin (adjusted odds ratio 0.77, 95% confidence interval 0.55-1.07) and a stronger association with regular use of statins (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.43-0.99) or use of both drugs (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.36-1.10). Combined use of low-dose aspirin and statins was associated with risk reduction by 62% after 5 or more years (OR 0.38, 95% CI 0.15-0.97). Combinational chemoprevention with low-dose aspirin and statins might provide stronger risk reduction than either of the single drugs after at least 5 years use, but confirmation is needed, preferably in prospective cohort studies and eventually by randomized controlled trials.",

Mean serum cholesterol concentration was 4.5 mmol/l (SD 1.3), LDL-cholesterol 2.54 (0.48), HDL-cholesterol 1.25 (0.48), and triglycerides 1.62 (0.84). Only 40 patients (19.7%) were using statins, this was increased to 72 (33.6%) after clinic visit. Consequently, 50.0% and 53.2% met the current total cholesterol (<4.5 mmol/l) and LDL-cholesterol (<2.5 mmol/l) goals, respectively.",

    "10": "The aim of the present study was to examine the potential antitumor activity of lovastatin and other statins together with pamidronate, a second generation bisphosphonate (BP), against tumor cell lines. Cytostatic/cytotoxic effects were measured using crystal violet assay. Regulation of the cell cycle and induction of apoptosis were evaluated using flow cytometry and Western blotting, migration of tumor cells was measured in a scratch wound assay and their invasiveness was measured with a Matrigel-invasion assay. Antitumor effects of the combination treatment were evaluated in a murine PANC 02 pancreatic adenocarcinoma model. Combination of pamidronate and lovastatin produced potentiated cytostatic/cytotoxic effects against breast and pancreatic cancer cell lines. The combination was also effective in inhibition of tumor cell adhesion to collagen IV and fibronectin and interfered with migration and invasiveness of tumor cells. Neither pamidronate nor lovastatin alone affected tumor growth in mice but the combination treatment resulted in retardation of tumor growth and prolongation of mouse survival. The combination of statins and pamidronate, a second generation bisphosphonate, demonstrates promising antitumor effects at doses readily achievable in patients. This combination holds promise for future clinical studies.",

    "18": "This study investigated the effects of dual delivery of statin and vancomycin on the healing process of a femoral defect injury using tricalcium phosphate lysine (TCPL) delivery system in an animal model. The experimental design consisted of 14 rats divided into the following three groups: Group I animals (n=5) served as the intact control without treatment. Group II animals (n=5) were subjected to a surgically induced defect (2 mm, midshaft of the right femur) and implanted (IM) with TCPL capsules loaded with vancomycin (20mg) (TCPL-AB). Group III animals (n=4) were operated on in a similar fashion as Group II, and subsequently implanted with TCPL capsules loaded vancomycin (20 mg) plus statin (5 mg). The animals were euthanized at 30 days post-implantation using overdose of isoflourane. The right femurs were then harvested in addition to the vital organs, the reproductive organs, and sample of the adjacent skeletal muscles. The hard and soft tissues were evaluated histopathologically by following laboratory standard techniques. The results of this study indicated that statin plus vancomycin treated animals healed in a greater magnitude than the sham group (independent evaluators (p<0.001)). Histomorphometric analysis demonstrated that exposure to sustained delivery of statin resulted in increased in cortical width compared to the sham and control groups (p<0.05). Furthermore, the periosteal area was significantly greater than the areas observed in sham group (p<0.05). Image analysis revealed that there were more bone formation in the vancomycin and statin exposed animals than the sham. Overall, the use of TCPL system was able to deliver statin in a sustained manner without eliciting any adverse effects on the reproductive, vital organs and the muscles. In conclusion, data obtained from this study demonstrated that sustained delivery of statin resulted in a remarkable increase in osteogenic activity.", 
    "19": "This study is an attempt to develop a simple search method for lead peptide candidates, which include constrained structures in a recognized sequence, using the design of a competitive inhibitor for HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR). A structure-functional analysis of previously synthesized peptides proposes that a competitive inhibitory peptide can be designed by maintaining bioactive conformation in a recognized sequence. A conformational aspect of the structure-based approach was applied to the peptide design. By analysis of the projections obtained through a principle component analysis (PCA) for short linear and cyclic peptides, a head-to-tail peptide cycle is considered as a model for its linear analogy. It is proposed that activities of the linear peptides based on an identical amino acid sequence, which are obtained from a less flexible peptide cycle, would be relatively higher than those obtained from more flexible cyclic peptides. The design criterion was formulated in terms of a 'V' parameter, reflecting a relative deviation of an individual peptide cycle from an average statistical peptide cycle based on all optimized structures of the cyclic peptides in set. Twelve peptide cycles were selected for the peptide library. Comparing the calculated 'V' parameters, two cyclic peptides (GLPTGG and GFPTGG) were selected as lead cycles from the library. Based on these sequences, six linear peptides obtained by breaking the cycle at different positions were selected as lead peptide candidates. The linear GFPTGG peptide, showing the highest inhibitory activity against HMGR, increases the inhibitory potency nearly tenfold. Kinetic analysis reveals that the GFPTGG peptide is a competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA with an equilibrium constant of inhibitor binding (K(i)) of 6.4 +/- 0.3 microM. Conformational data support a conformation of the designed peptides close to the bioactive conformation of the previously synthesized active peptides.", 
    "20": "Little is known on the use of evidence-based medications in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) across all ages. We undertook this study to describe the patterns of prescription and discontinuation of anti-platelet agents, beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and/or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and statins in all patients post-AMI.", 
    "21": "Using population-based administrative databases, patients with an AMI between 1999 and 2004 (21 494 men and 13 241 women) were identified. Rates of prescriptions after discharge and time to discontinuation of the study drugs were computed for various age groups.", 
    "22": "The proportion of patients prescribed a study drug increased throughout the study period. In 2003-2004, 90% of patients were prescribed an anti-platelet agent, 77% a beta-blocker, 72% a statin and 70% an ACE inhibitor and/or an ARB within 30 days of discharge from their AMI. However, the rates of discontinuation increased significantly during follow-up and, in men, reached 27% by 2 years and 42% by 5 years for beta-blockers. The rates of discontinuation of all four study drugs had a parabolic shape with the youngest and oldest patients having the highest rates.", 
    "23": "The use of evidence-based drugs for patients after AMI is increasing. However, efforts aimed at closing the treatment gap may be mitigated by high rates of discontinuation, especially in patients at the extremes of the age spectrum.",

The plasma lipid profile showed that his total cholesterol level was 898 mg/dL (23.2 mmol/L), LDL cholesterol level was 756 mg/dL (19.6 mmol/L) and triglyceride level was 60 mg/dL (0.7 mmol/L). There were no living donors with a normal LDL receptor in their family, and it was difficult to find a deceased donor in Japan; thus he underwent LDLT with his father as the donor. His sister was born 2 years after his LDLT. She underwent ABO-incompatible LDLT at the age of 2 with her mother as the donor.",

There is promising evidence of a beneficial effect of CoQ(10) when given alone or in addition to standard therapies in hypertension and in heart failure, but less extensive evidence in ischemic heart disease. 2. Large scale multi-centre prospective randomised trials are indicated in all these areas but there are difficulties in funding such trials. 3. Presently, due to the notable absence of clinically significant side effects and likely therapeutic benefit, CoQ(10) can be considered a safe adjunct to standard therapies in cardiovascular disease.", 
    "29": "Nitric oxide (NO) may decrease bubble formation in diving. Statin medications are attractive potential options to increase NO. Statins exhibit a proven safety profile, and possess a myriad of pleiotropic properties improving vascular endothelial function. Additionally, statin-mediated lipid reduction may reduce bubble generation via alterations in plasma surface tension. We investigated the efficacy of atorvastatin as a pharmacological intervention to reduce the risk of bubble formation after diving, a surrogate for decompression sickness (DCS).", 
    "30": "There were 16 trained military divers who completed a provacative hyperbaric chamber dive protocol after taking either 80-mg of atorvastatin or placebo for 4 d. Subjects completed the alternate medication regimen no sooner than 2 wk. After each dive, subjects were subjected to precordial trans-thoracic echocardiographic exams via standardized protocols. Bubbles were graded via a non-parametric, ordinal grading system and statistically analyzed via Wilcoxon signed-rank tests.", 
    "31": "We found no within subject differences for the maximum bubble grade scores (z = 0.00, p = 1.00, n=16). Low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and total cholesterol (TC) levels decreased significantly (107.6 +/- 26.2 to 79.3 +/- 21.9 mg x dl(-1) and 175 +/- 20.9 to 147 +/- 22.4 mg x dl(-1), respectively) 1-2 wk post statin administration. Age, bioelectrical impedance (BEI), TC, LDL, potassium, and calcium demonstrated positive correlations to placebo bubble grades.", 
    "32": "Prophylactic 80-mg atorvastatin administration for 4 d failed to reduce the number of intravascular bubbles observed following a 60-ft, 80-min dry chamber dive despite significant acute reductions in lipid levels. Several hypotheses may explain why statins failed to decrease bubble volume: (1) differential influence of statins on the venous vs. arterial vasculature; (2) failure to elicit an improvement in endothelial function and, therefore, the hypothesized endothelial conditioning in younger patients possessing normal baseline; and (3) the ordinal grading system encompassing a substantial variation in bubble volume (bubbles Scm(-2)).", 
    "33": "Solid dispersions in water-soluble carriers have attracted considerable interest as a means of improving the dissolution rate, and hence possibly bioavailability, of a range of hydrophobic drugs. The aim of the present study was to improve the solubility and dissolution rate of a poorly water-soluble drug, Lovastatin, by a solid dispersion technique. Solid dispersions were prepared by using polyethylene glycol 4000 (PEG 4000) and polyvinylpyrrolidone K30 (PVP K30) in different drug-to-carrier ratios. Dispersions with PEG 4000 were prepared by fusion-cooling and solvent evaporation, whereas dispersions containing PVP K30 were prepared by solvent evaporation technique. These new formulations were characterized in the liquid state by phase solubility studies and in the solid state by differential scanning calorimetry, X-ray powder diffraction, and FT-IR spectroscopy. The aqueous solubility of Lovastatin was favored by the presence of both polymers. The negative values of the Gibbs free energy and enthalpy of transfer explained the spontaneous transfer from pure water to the aqueous polymer environment. Solid-state characterization indicated Lovastatin was present as amorphous material and entrapped in polymer matrix. In contrast to the very slow dissolution rate of pure Lovastatin, the dispersion of the drug in the polymers considerably enhanced the dissolution rate. This can be attributed to improved wettability and dispersibility, as well as decrease of the crystalline and increase of the amorphous fraction of the drug. Solid dispersion prepared with PVP showed the highest improvement in wettability and dissolution rate of Lovastatin. Even physical mixture of Lovastatin prepared with both polymers also showed better dissolution profile than that of pure Lovastatin. Tablets containing solid dispersion prepared with PEG and PVP showed significant improvement in the release profile Lovastatin compared with tablets containing Lovastatin without PEG or PVP.", 
    "34": "The \"tako-tsubo\" syndrome, initially described by Japanese authors is an apical akinesis of the left ventricule without significant coronary artery disease, with a moderate elevation of troponine I. We report 2 cases of women (with an average age of 68 years). They were refered for suspected acute coronary syndrome including on admission chest pain and ST segment elevation. Cardiac ultrasonography shew an apical akinesis. Coronary angiography didn't show significant coronary lesion. A moderate elevation of troponine was noted but no significant elevation of CPK. The prognosis has been excellent for these 2 patients. We observed a ventricular tachycardia due to QT lengthening in 1 case treated anteriorly by Fleca\u00efn which spontaneously resolved. The first month, the electrocardiogram and cardiac ultrasonography anomalies disappeared totally. The treatment is based on beta-blockers, aspirin, statines, ACE. In the two cases, we didn't find arguments for myocarditis, recanalized thrombosis, coronary spasm, pheochromocytomas, but a risk factor is inboth: emotional stress. Maybe the diagnosis could be easier with the submillimeter cardiac computed tomography.", 
    "35": "Many patients at high cardiovascular risk still fail to achieve recommended LDL-C goals. Showing evidence of a difference between two statins at the same dose can significantly contribute to selecting the most appropriate strategy to reduce cardiovascular risk in these patients. ARIANE study was a randomized, open-label comparative study. 844 patients at high cardiovascular risk were recruited by primary care cardiologists in France. They were randomized to receive once-daily dose of 10 mg of rosuvastatin or atorvastatin. The primary objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of rosuvastatin with that of atorvastatin in achieving an LDL-C goal of < 1.00 g/1 at 12 weeks. High cardiovascular risk was defined by either history of cardiovascular event, or a type IIa or IIb dyslipidemia associated with more than 2 other cardiovascular risk factors or 2 risk factors and a 10-year coronary risk > 20% based on Framingham score. 790 patients were available for intention-to-treat analysis. At 12 weeks, LDL-C goal was reached by 211 of the 411 patients treated with rosuvastatin (51.3%) and 119 of 379 patients treated with atorvastatin (31.4%), the difference being statistically significant (p < 0.0001). Both treatments were well tolerated. Adverse events were equally observed in the 2 groups, one patient in the rosuvastatin group showed a CK elevation without clinical consequence. The risk profile for the patients in this study matched that which, in 2005, had led to the Afssaps lowering the LDL-C target below 1.00g/l. The doses of the two statins compared here correspond to the doses most commonly used in day-to-day clinical practice. The greater efficacy of rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin at the same dose demonstrated here confirms previous data. Therefore, in high risk patients treated by primary care cardiologists, rosuvastatin allows a significantly greater proportion to reach the LDL-C goal of < 1.00 g/l compared to atorvastatin at the same dose. However, many patients remain not at goal.", 
    "36": "Recently, considerable progress has been made in understanding the genetic basis of dyslipidemias and in studying the safety and efficacy of lipid-lowering drugs for coronary heart disease (CHD) prevention. Novel loci have been identified for monogenic hypercholesterolemia, such as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR)-associated protein, proprotein convertase subtilisin-like kexin type 9, and ATP-binding cassette transporters ABCG5 and ABCG8. LDLR-associated protein promotes clustering of LDLRs into clathrin-coated pits for LDL uptake; proprotein convertase subtilisin-like kexin type 9 is involved in LDLR degradation; and ABCG5 and 8 pump sterols out of the hepatic and intestinal cells into bile and intestinal lumen, respectively. A novel gene encoding apolipoprotein AV, an activator of lipoprotein lipase, has also been linked to familial hypertriglyceridemia. Linkage of familial combined hyperlipidemia to upstream stimulatory factor 1 remains controversial. Recent guidelines of the Adult Treatment Panel III emphasize intensive reduction of LDL or non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients at high risk of CHD. However, of the four recently concluded trials comparing high- vs. low-dose statin therapy, only two showed an unequivocal reduction in cardiovascular endpoints. Because intensive statin therapy can increase the risk of myopathy and hepatotoxicity, it is important to consider its risk-benefit ratio in individual patients. Restriction of dietary saturated and trans-fat and cholesterol, along with increased intake of soluble fiber, can also achieve substantial LDL cholesterol lowering. Fibrates may reduce the risk of acute pancreatitis in severely hypertriglyceridemic patients and may be beneficial for CHD prevention. However, the safety and efficacy of combined therapy of fibrates and statins needs to be established.", 
    "37": "The family of statins includes pharmacologic inhibitors of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase that are potent regulators of cholesterol biosynthesis. In addition to their cholesterol-lowering effects, statins inhibit cell proliferation and promote apoptosis of malignant cells in vitro, but their potential therapeutic roles in the treatment of malignancies remain to be defined. We examined the effects of statins on the growth and differentiation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells. Atorvastatin and fluvastatin were found to be potent inducers of cell differentiation and apoptosis of the NB4 acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cell line. Such effects correlated with activation of the small G-proteins Rac1/Cdc42 and downstream engagement of the c-Jun NH(2)-terminal kinase kinase pathway, whose function was found to be essential for the generation of proapoptotic responses. Importantly, different statins were found to enhance all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA)-dependent differentiation of APL blasts and reverse resistance to the antileukemic effects of ATRA. In addition, fluvastatin exhibited growth-inhibitory properties on primary bone marrow-derived leukemic progenitors from patients with AML and enhanced the suppressive effects of ATRA on leukemic progenitor colony formation. Altogether, these studies establish that statins exhibit potent antileukemic properties in vitro and raise the possibility that combinations of statins with ATRA may be an effective approach to overcome the development of ATRA resistance by the leukemic cells.", 
    "38": "Statins are drugs of known and undisputed efficacy in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, usually well tolerated by most patients. In some cases treatment with statins produces skeletal muscle complaints, and/or mild serum CK elevation; the incidence of rhabdomyolysis is very low. As a result of the common biosynthetic pathway Coenzyme Q (ubiquinone) and dolichol levels are also affected, to a certain degree, by the treatment with these HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Plasma levels of CoQ10 are lowered in the course of statin treatment. This could be related to the fact that statins lower plasma LDL levels, and CoQ10 is mainly transported by LDL, but a decrease is also found in platelets and in lymphocytes of statin treated patients, therefore it could truly depend on inhibition of CoQ10 synthesis. There are also some indications that statin treatment affects muscle ubiquinone levels, although it is not yet clear to which extent this depends on some effect on mitochondrial biogenesis. Some papers indicate that CoQ10 depletion during statin therapy might be associated with subclinical cardiomyopathy and this situation is reversed upon CoQ10 treatment. We can reasonably hypothesize that in some conditions where other CoQ10 depleting situations exist treatment with statins may seriously impair plasma and possible tissue levels of coenzyme Q10. While waiting for a large scale clinical trial where patients treated with statins are also monitored for their CoQ10 status, with a group also being given CoQ10, physicians should be aware of this drug-nutrient interaction and be vigilant to the possibility that statin drugs may, in some cases, impair skeletal muscle and myocardial bioenergetics.", 
    "39": "The cell-to-cell interaction through binding intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and CD40 on monocytes and their ligands such as lymphocyte function-associated antigen (LFA)-1 and CD40 ligand (CD40L) on T-cells plays roles in cytokine production and T-cell proliferation. Interleukin (IL)-18, which is elevated in the plasma during acute rejection after organ transplantation, induces the expression of ICAM-1 and CD40 on monocytes, the production of interferon (IFN)-gamma and IL-12 and the proliferation of T-cells during the human mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). In addition to the cholesterol lowering effect, statins improve patient survival and decrease rejection episodes in transplant recipients. In the present study, we investigated the difference of effect of statins and calcineurin inhibitors during MLR. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, fluvastatin and pravastatin and statin-derived LFA-1 inhibitors, LFA703 and LFA878, which did not inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, suppressed the production of IFN-gamma and IL-12 and the lymphocyte proliferation as well as the expression of ICAM-1 and CD40 on monocytes regardless of the presence of IL-18. However, the calcineurin inhibitors, tacrolimus and cyclosporine A (CsA), inhibited the IL-18-enhanced cytokine production and lymphocyte proliferation without any effect on the adhesion molecule expression. Thus, the action mechanism of stain is different from that of calcineurin inhibitors.", 
    "40": "The relationship between peripheral arterial disease (PAD), cardiovascular disease (CAD), and underlying atherosclerotic risk factors such as dyslipidemia, smoking, diabetes, and hypertension is well established. Patients with PAD have dramatically increased risks of cardiovascular mortality due to underlying atherosclerosis. As interventionalists, we focus primarily on improving the functional status of our patients by \"fixing\" their peripheral arterial occlusions, often ignoring the more serious concerns, as well as the root cause of the problem. In addition to interventional strategies, comprehensive clinical management of PAD should include attention to risk factor modification, lifestyle changes, exercise therapy, and pharmacologic interventions. Conventional training in interventional radiology imparts very little familiarity with these management issues. The following article addresses one critical modifiable risk factor, dyslipidemia, and treatment with the powerful class of drugs, the statins, reviewing the rationale for as well as the practical considerations in the use of these agents.", 
    "41": "In recent studies it was observed antioxidant effects of statin independently on their hypolipemic effects. It is supposed that differences in statins pharmacological properties may cause different antioxidant actions. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of simvastatin, atorvastatin and pravastatin on plasma lipids, thio-barbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) concentrations in the isolated erythrocytes membranes, activities of antioxidants enzymes in erythrocytes: catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), superoxide dismutase (SOD) in patients (pts) with dyslipidemia.", 
    "42": "The study comprised 114 pts, including 94 pts with dyslipidemia without concomitant chronic diseases and 20 healthy volunteers.

Pts were randomized to three groups: group I-n = 31 pts treated with atorvastatin (10 mg/d); group II-n = 31-simvastatin (20 mg/d), group III-n = 32 pravastatin (20 mg/d).", 
    "43": "After 4 and 12 weeks of active treatment the following parameters were determined: TC, HDL-C, TG (by enzymatic method using bioMerieux tests); LDL-C was calculated from the Friedewald formula, TBARS concentrations (by method of Stock and Dormandy), CAT (method of Bartosz et al.), GSH-Px (method of Rice-Evansa et al.), SOD (method of Misra) activities.", 
    "44": "During statin therapy significant decrease of TC, LDL-C, TG was observed, both after 4 and 12 weeks, as compared with the initial values. All statins significantly decreased TBARS concentrations either 4 or 12 week therapy at all. The activities of antioxidants enzymes (CAT, GSH-Px, SOD) significantly increased after 4 weeks therapy in patients treated with atorvastatin and simvastatin. During pravastatin therapy it was noticed only increase of CAT activity after 12 weeks.", 
    "45": "In patients with dyslipidemia without clinical symptoms of atherosclerosis atorvastatin, simvastatin and pravastatin decreased similar TBARS concentrations in membrane in the isolated erythrocyte membranes. It was observed a significant increase of the antioxidant enzyme activities during atorvastatin and simvastatin treatment. Pravastatin therapy caused increase the CAT activity without any effect on the activities of GSH-Px and SOD.", 
    "46": "Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) concentration in blood cells was analyzed by HPLC and compared to plasma concentration before, during, and after CoQ10 (3 mg/kg/day) supplementation to human probands. Lymphocyte DNA 8-hydroxydeoxy-guanosine (8-OHdG), a marker of oxidative stress, was analyzed by Comet assay. Subjects supplemented with CoQ10 showed a distinct response in plasma concentrations after 14 and 28 days. Plasma levels returned to baseline values 12 weeks after treatment stopped. The plasma concentration increase did not affect erythrocyte levels. However, after CoQ10 supplementation, the platelet level increased; after supplementation stopped, the platelet level showed a delayed decrease. A positive correlation was shown between the plasma CoQ10 level and platelet and white blood cell CoQ10 levels. During CoQ10 supplementation, delayed formation of 8-OHdG in lymphocyte DNA was observed; this effect was long-lasting and could be observed even 12 weeks after supplementation stopped. Intracellular enrichment may support anti-oxidative defense mechanisms.",

Natriuretic peptides have been demonstrated to be promising new preoperative risk markers. Although recommended in high-risk patients, noninvasive cardiac stress testing may be safely omitted in patients at intermediate risk. The antiischemic properties of beta-blockers have been well described. In clinical practice, however, adequate beta-blocker dosage, tight perioperative heart rate control and continuation of beta-blockers after surgery may also be important factors. Statins have emerged as promising drugs with perioperative cardioprotective properties. Before recommending routine administration of statin therapy, however, more clinical trials are needed.",

Coronary aneurysms may be asymptomatic, or they may be complicated by thrombosis and rupture. We report a multiple coronary artery aneurysm that caused thrombosis in a patient, along with 22-month follow-up results with multi-slice spiral computerized tomography. A 43-year-old man was admitted to hospital with a diagnosis of acute inferior myocardial infarction. He underwent thrombolytic treatment with streptokinase. Cardiac catheterization revealed multiple large aneurysms of the proximal coronary arteries and intracoronary thrombosis in the midportion of the circumflex coronary artery. His multi-slice spiral computerized tomography revealed an organized thrombus in the CX coronary artery, no critical stenosis and no change in the coronary aneurysm after 22 months. The patient did not experience any problem during the 22-month follow-up period. In our opinion, middle diameter coronary artery aneurysms that are asymptomatic and not accompanied by critical stenosis can be followed up with medical treatment, and multi-slice spiral computerized tomography is a safe way to follow up these patients.",

The primary objective was to assess the association between ankle-brachial index (ABI) values and renal outcome. The secondary objective was to evaluate whether statins and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) are associated with improved renal and cardiovascular outcome in patients with PAD. In a prospective observational cohort study of 1940 consecutive patients with PAD, ABI was measured and chronic statin and ACEI therapy was noted at baseline. Serial creatinine concentrations were obtained at baseline, 6 mo, and every year after enrollment. End points were ESRD, all-cause mortality, and cardiac events during a median follow-up period of 8 yr. Baseline estimated GFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) was assessed in 27% of patients. ESRD, all-cause mortality, and cardiac events occurred in 10, 46, and 31% of patients, respectively. In multivariate analysis, a lower baseline ABI was significantly associated with a higher progression rate of ESRD (hazard ratio [HR] per 0.10 decrease 1.34; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.21 to 1.49). Chronic use of statins and ACEI were significantly associated with lower ESRD (HR 0.41 [95% CI 0.28 to 0.63] and 0.74 [95% CI 0.54 to 0.98], respectively), mortality (HR 0.66; [95% CI 0.55 to 0.82] and 0.84 [95% CI 78 to 0.95], respectively), and cardiac events (HR 0.71 [95% CI 0.56 to 0.91] and 0.81 [95% CI 0.68 to 0.96], respectively).

We carried out a 6-month longitudinal study in 10 dyslipidemic patients receiving 10 mg/day atorvastatin and 13 healthy sedentary subjects. Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and reduced ascorbic acid (RAA) were measured in plasma at rest and every 5 minutes after submaximal isometric thumb adduction and handgrip sustained until exhaustion. At inclusion, resting TBARS and RAA levels in controls and patients did not differ and exercise increased TBARS and decreased RAA. Atorvastatin reduced resting TBARS and RAA levels in a time-dependent but lipid-independent manner. The main effect was a post-exercise increase in TBARS, without affecting the post-exercise RAA levels. The reduction in oxidative stress occurred earlier in oxidative muscles involved in thumb adduction. In conclusion, atorvastatin lowers resting oxidant-antioxidant activity: exercise-induced oxidative stress occurs mainly in muscles having a high oxidative capacity.",

Coenzyme Q10 depletion has been speculated to play a potential role in statin-related adverse events, and withdrawal of statin is the choice in patients developing myotoxicity or liver toxicity. However, the effect of statin withdrawal on circulating levels of coenzyme Q10 remains unknown. Twenty-six patients with hypercholesterolemia received atorvastatin at 10 mg/day for 3 months. Serum lipid profiles and coenzyme Q10 were assessed before and immediately after 3 months and were also measured 2 and 3 days after the last day on the statin. After 3 months' atorvastatin therapy, serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and coenzyme Q10 (0.43 +/- 0.23 to 0.16 +/- 0.10 microg/mL) were all significantly reduced (all p<0.001). On day 2 after the last atorvastatin, the coenzyme Q10 level was significantly elevated (0.37 +/- 0.16 microg/mL) and maintained the same levels on day 3 (0.39 +/- 0.18 microg/mL) compared with those on month 3 (both p< 0.001), while TC and LDL-C did not significantly change within the same 3 days.

    "66": "3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (HRIs) are widely used to reduce serum cholesterol in patients with hypercholesterolemia. Previous studies have shown that HRIs can induce apoptosis in colon cancer cells. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the apoptosis-inducing effect of HRIs in greater detail. The HRI lovastatin induced apoptosis in the human colon cancer cell line SW480 by blocking the cholesterol synthesis pathway. Immunoblot analysis of antiapoptotic molecules, including survivin, XIAP, cIAP-1, cIAP-2, Bcl-2, and Bcl-X(L), revealed that only survivin expression was decreased by lovastatin. Survivin down-regulation by RNA interference induced apoptosis, and survivin overexpression rendered the cells resistant to lovastatin-induced growth inhibition. These results indicate that survivin down-regulation contributes substantially to the proapoptotic properties of lovastatin. Farnesyl pyrophosphate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, two downstream intermediates in the cholesterol synthesis pathway, simultaneously reversed survivin down-regulation and the blocking of Ras isoprenylation by lovastatin. Ras isoprenylation is important for the activation of Ras-mediated signaling, including the activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase)/Akt pathway. The PI3-kinase inhibitor down-regulated survivin in SW480 cells. In addition, lovastatin blocked Ras activation and Akt phosphorylation. We conclude that survivin down-regulation is crucial in lovastatin-induced apoptosis in cancer cells and that lovastatin decreases survivin expression by inhibiting Ras-mediated PI3-kinase activation via the blocking of Ras isoprenylation.",

    "77": "Regulated secretion of EC (endothelial cell) vWF (von Willebrand factor) is part of the haemostatic response. It occurs in response to secretagogues that raise intracellular calcium or cAMP. Statins are cholesterol-lowering drugs used for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. We studied the effect of fluvastatin on regulated secretion of vWF from HUVEC (human umbilical-vein ECs). Secretion in response to thrombin, a protease-activated receptor-1 agonist peptide, histamine, forskolin and adrenaline (epinephrine) was inhibited. This inhibition was reversed by mevalonate or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, and mimicked by a geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor, demonstrating that the inhibitory mechanism includes inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation. To investigate this mechanism further, calcium handling and NO (nitric oxide) regulation were studied in fluvastatin-treated HUVEC. Intracellular calcium mobilization did not correlate with vWF secretion. Fluvastatin increased eNOS [endothelial NOS (NO synthase)] expression, but NOS inhibitors failed to reverse the effect of fluvastatin on vWF secretion. Exogenous NO did not inhibit thrombin-induced vWF secretion. Many small GTPases are geranylgeranylated and some are activated by secretagogues. We overexpressed DN (dominant negative) Rho GTPases, RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 (cell division cycle 42), in HUVEC. DNCdc42 conferred inhibition of thrombin- and forskolin-induced vWF secretion. We conclude that, via inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation, fluvastatin is a broadspectrum inhibitor of regulated vWF secretion. Geranylgeranylated small GTPases with functional roles in regulated secretion, such as Cdc42, are potential targets for the inhibitory activity of fluvastatin.", 
    "78": "Vasoconstriction and vascular medial hypertrophy, resulting from increased intracellular [Ca2+] in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMC), contribute to elevated vascular resistance in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH). Caveolae, microdomains within the plasma membrane, contain the protein caveolin, which binds certain signaling molecules. We tested the hypothesis that PASMC from IPAH patients express more caveolin-1 (Cav-1) and caveolae, which contribute to increased capacitative Ca2+ entry (CCE) and DNA synthesis. Immunohistochemistry showed increased expression of Cav-1 in smooth muscle cells but not endothelial cells of pulmonary arteries from patients with IPAH. Subcellular fractionation and electron microscopy confirmed the increase in Cav-1 and caveolae expression in IPAH-PASMC. Treatment of IPAH-PASMC with agents that deplete membrane cholesterol (methyl-beta-cyclodextrin or lovastatin) disrupted caveolae, attenuated CCE, and inhibited DNA synthesis of IPAH-PASMC. Increasing Cav-1 expression of normal PASMC with a Cav-1-encoding adenovirus increased caveolae formation, CCE, and DNA synthesis; treatment of IPAH-PASMC with siRNA targeted to Cav-1 produced the opposite effects. Treatments that down-regulate caveolin/caveolae expression, including cholesterol-lowering drugs, reversed the increased CCE and DNA synthesis in IPAH-PASMC. Increased caveolin and caveolae expression thus contribute to IPAH-PASMC pathophysiology. The close relationship between caveolin/caveolae expression and altered cell physiology in IPAH contrast with previous results obtained in various animal models, including caveolin-knockout mice, thus emphasizing unique features of the human disease. The results imply that disruption of caveolae in PASMC may provide a novel therapeutic approach to attenuate disease manifestations of IPAH.", 
    "79": "Hepatic uptake carriers of the organic anion-transporting peptide (OATP) family of solute carriers are more and more recognized as being involved in hepatic elimination of many drugs and potentially associated drug-drug interactions. The gemfibrozil-statin interaction was studied at the level of active hepatic uptake as a model for such drug-drug interactions. Active, temperature-dependent uptake of fluvastatin into primary human hepatocytes was shown. Multiple transporters are involved in this uptake as Chinese hamster ovary or HEK293 cells expressing either OATP1B1 (K(m) = 1.4-3.5 microM), OATP2B1 (K(m) = 0.7-0.8 microM), or OATP1B3 showed significant fluvastatin uptake relative to control cells. For OATP1B1 the inhibition by gemfibrozil was substrate-dependent as the transport of fluvastatin (IC(50) of 63 microM), pravastatin, simvastatin, and taurocholate was inhibited by gemfibrozil, whereas the transport of estrone-3-sulfate and troglitazone sulfate (both used at 3 microM) was not affected. The OATP1B1- but not OATP2B1-mediated transport of estrone-3-sulfate displayed biphasic saturation kinetics, with two distinct affinity components for estrone-3-sulfate (0.23 and 45 microM). Only the high-affinity component was inhibited by gemfibrozil. Recombinant OATP1B1-, OATP2B1-, and OATP1B3-mediated fluvastatin transport was inhibited to 97, 70, and 62% by gemfibrozil (200 microM), respectively, whereas only a small inhibitory effect by gemfibrozil (200 microM) on fluvastatin uptake into primary human hepatocytes was observed (27% inhibition). The results indicate that the in vitro engineered systems can not always predict the behavior in more complex systems such as freshly isolated primary hepatocytes. Therefore, selection of substrate, substrate concentration, and in vitro transport system are critical for the conduct of in vitro interaction studies involving individual liver OATP carriers.",

Inhibition of statin glucuronidation has been postulated as a potential mechanism of interaction (Drug Metab Dispos 30:1280-1287, 2002). This study was conducted to determine the in vitro inhibitory potential of fibrates toward atorvastatin glucuronidation. [(3)H]Atorvastatin, atorvastatin, and atorvastatin lactone were incubated with human liver microsomes or human recombinant UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) and characterized using liquid chromatography (LC)/tandem mass spectrometry and LC/UV/beta-radioactivity monitor/mass spectrometry. [(3)H]Atorvastatin yields a minor ether glucuronide (G1) and a major acyl glucuronide (G2) with subsequent pH-dependent lactonization of G2 to yield atorvastatin lactone. Atorvastatin lactonization best fit substrate inhibition kinetics (K(m) = 12 microM, V(max) = 74 pmol/min/mg, K(i) = 75 microM). Atorvastatin lactone yields a single ether glucuronide (G3). G3 formation best fit Michaelis-Menten kinetics (K(m) = 2.6 microM, V(max) = 10.6 pmol/min/mg). Six UGT enzymes contribute to atorvastatin glucuronidation with G2 and G3 formation catalyzed by UGTs 1A1, 1A3, 1A4, 1A8, and 2B7, whereas G1 formation was catalyzed by UGTs 1A3, 1A4, and 1A9. Gemfibrozil, fenofibrate, and fenofibric acid inhibited atorvastatin lactonization with IC(50) values of 346, 320, and 291 microM, respectively. Based on unbound fibrate concentrations at the inlet to the liver, these data predict a small increase in atorvastatin AUC (approximately 1.2-fold) after gemfibrozil coadministration and no interaction with fenofibrate. This result is consistent with recent clinical reports indicating minimal atorvastatin AUC increases ( approximately 1.2- to 1.4-fold) with gemfibrozil.", 
    "81": "Young patients with diabetes but without established vascular disease have altered conduit and resistance artery reactivity. Early endothelial dysfunction is an initial step in atherogenesis: reductions in nitric oxide (NO) production in these vascular beds are implicated. The study aim was two-fold: first, to detect baseline abnormalities in cardiac function, conduit vessels and the microcirculation using applanation tonometry, brachial artery ultrasound and laser Doppler fluximetry, respectively; and second, to investigate any modification in these parameters with the use of pravastatin. Nine young men with diabetes and normoalbuminuria were randomised in a double-blind cross-over fashion to placebo or pravastatin (40 mg) treatment for two weeks. They underwent scans on three separate occasions. Control patients (n=12) underwent a baseline scan but were not given any drug treatment. It was found that patients with diabetes had significantly higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures, heart rate and Buckberg index (propensity to myocardial ischaemia). Brachial artery reactivity and microcirculatory dilation were both reduced. Levels of von Willebrand Factor, a marker of endothelial damage, were also elevated. Pravastatin treatment restored these sub-clinical abnormalities towards normal levels. In conclusion, pravastatin improves vascular abnormalities in young male patients with diabetes through alterations in microcirculation and conduit vessel function, with secondary myocardial effects. This may be of benefit in preventing end-organ injury.", 
    "82": "The management of the hypercholesterolemic patient has evolved tremendously with the introduction of the HMG-CoA Reductase inhibitors, a class of drugs better known as the statins. Statins modify cholesterol metabolism by inhibiting the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis, producing greater decreases in plasma cholesterol levels than previously realized with hypolipidemic therapy. With the advent of the classic statin-megatrials such as the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S), WOSCOPS, CARE, and the more recent Heart Protection Study (HPS), the role of statins in both the primary and secondary prevention and ultimate risk reduction of patients with coronary disease has been firmly established.",

They were also matched for dialysis adequacy and duration of dialysis but the statin group patients were older (57 +/- 13 vs 52 +/- 17 years, p = 0.01). Serum cholesterol was lower in the statin group (4.74 +/- 1.05 vs 5.02 +/- 1.17 mmol/L, p < 0.05).

While extensively studied in regard with cholesterol synthesis and its implications in cardiovascular diseases, in recent years the mevalonate pathway has become a challenging and, in the meantime, fascinating topic, when a large number of experimental and clinical studies suggested that inhibition of non-sterol isoprenoids might have valuable interest in human pathology. These molecules that are essential for cell growth and differentiation appear to be potential interesting therapeutic targets for many areas of ongoing research: oncology, autoimmune disorders, atherosclerosis, and Alzheimer disease. Also, considerable progress has been made in the past decade in understanding the pathophysiology of two auto-inflammatory disorders resulting from an inherited deficiency of mevalonate kinase, the first committed enzyme of the mevalonate pathway. Here we present a brief description of the biochemistry of the mevalonate pathway, together with a review of the current knowledge of the clinical and therapeutical implications of this fascinating and complex metabolic pathway.",

Effective plasma concentration of lovastatin hydroxy acid ranged from 21-157 ng/mL (0.8-3.7 x 10(-7) M). In vitro rapid pacing, mostly with isoproterenol (5 x 10(-7) M) superfusion, produced delayed afterdepolarizations and triggered activity (9 +/- 2 action potentials). Lovastatin (10(-7) M) produced no change in action potentials or delayed afterdepolarizations. However, triggered activity was attenuated to 2 +/- 1 action potentials with lovastatin (P <.05, n = 13) but not with vehicle alone. Triggered activity returned to control after lovastatin washout (20 minutes) as well as with co-superfusion with mevalonic acid (10(-6) M, n = 5). 2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl, an antioxidant that enters tissues (10(-3) M, n = 8), prevented triggered activity in a fashion similar to lovastatin.",

In this study we analyzed the effects of atorvastatin and simvastatin acid (SVA) on the currents responsible for the duration of the plateau of human atrial action potentials: hKv1.5, Kv4.3, and L-type Ca(2+) (I(Ca,L)). hKv1.5 and Kv4.3 currents were recorded in transfected Ltk(-) and Chinese hamster ovary cells, respectively, and I(Ca,L) in mouse ventricular myocytes, using whole-cell patch-clamp. Atorvastatin and SVA produced a concentration-dependent block of hKv1.5 channels (IC(50)=4.5+/-1.7 microM and 5.7+/-0.03 microM, respectively) and shifted the midpoint of the activation and inactivation curves to more negative potentials. Importantly, atorvastatin- and SVA-induced block was added to that produced by quinidine, a drug that blocks hKv1.5 channels by binding to their pore cavity. Atorvastatin and SVA blocked Kv4.3 channels in a concentration-dependent manner (IC(50)=13.9+/-3.6 nM and 7.0+/-0.8 microM, respectively). Both drugs accelerated the inactivation kinetics and shifted the inactivation curve to more negative potentials. SVA (10 nM), but not atorvastatin, also blocked I(Ca,L) producing a frequency-dependent block that, at 2 Hz, reached a 50.2+/-1.5%. As a consequence of these effects, at nanomolar concentrations, atorvastatin lengthened, whereas SVA shortened, the duration of mouse atrial action potentials. The results suggest that atorvastatin and SVA alter Kv1.5 and Kv4.3 channel activity following a complex mechanism that does not imply the binding of the drug to the channel pore.", 
    "105": "The ATP-binding cassette transporters, ABCA1 and ABCG1, are LXR-target genes that participate in the removal of cholesterol from lipid-laden macrophages, a crucial anti-atherogenic mechanism. Statins are currently the most efficacious therapy for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and cardiovascular disease. We and others have shown that statins decrease ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression as well as cholesterol efflux from human macrophages. However, other studies have reported that statins produce no change, or even a modest increase in these variables. In an attempt to reconcile these conflicting reports, we investigated how the effect of statins on transcription of ABCA1 and ABCG1 is modulated by cellular cholesterol status and the extent of macrophage differentiation. We showed that supplementing human macrophages with cholesterol reversed the statin-mediated down-regulation of ABC transporter expression whereas depletion of cellular cholesterol tended to accentuate the statin effect. Down-regulation of ABC transporter expression was more pronounced with increased macrophage differentiation status and already evident at statin concentrations equivalent to those present in plasma. Addition of LXR agonists, which are currently on trial as anti-atherogenic agents, reversed the effects on ABC transporter expression while PPAR alpha and PPAR gamma agonists did not. The significance of these results in light of current and future combination therapies is discussed.", 
    "106": "Data from recent clinical trials of high- versus moderate-dose statin therapy support the recommendation to achieve a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) <100 mg/dl in high-risk patients and reveal that many patients will require a high-dose statin to achieve this goal. Overall, low rates of serious musculoskeletal (<0.6%) and hepatic (<1.3%) toxicity have been observed with high-dose statin therapy. In the long-term trials, atorvastatin 80 mg had higher rates of persistent transaminase elevations but rates of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis similar to lower doses of statins. The rate of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis for simvastatin 80 mg, although still low, was about 4x higher than for atorvastatin 80 mg and lower doses of statin. A similar margin of safety would be expected in properly selected patients with characteristics similar to those who participated in the clinical trials. High-dose statin therapy or combination therapy will be required for the large majority of very high-risk patients to achieve the optional LDL goal of <70 mg/dl. While the combination of ezetimibe, bile-acid sequestering agents, niacin, and fenofibrate with moderate dose statins appears to be reasonably safe, the long-term safety of combination with high-dose statins remains to be established. In order to optimize patient outcomes, clinicians should be aware of specific patient characteristics, such as advancing age, gender, body mass index, or glomerular filtration rate, which predict muscle and hepatic statin toxicity.", 
    "107": "Atherogenesis involves the migration of leukocytes into vascular subendothelial space, a process mediated by endothelial and leukocyte cell adhesion molecules. Endothelial molecules are assessed indirectly via serum levels, but leukocyte molecules can be assessed directly. We have therefore hypothesized that leukocyte adhesion molecules are altered to a greater degree in hypercholesterolemia than serum endothelial adhesion molecules. We examined 29 subjects with hypercholesterolemia and 27 controls at baseline and after 12 weeks of atorvastatin treatment (20 mg/day). Expression of leukocyte integrins CD11a, CD11b, CD18, and CD49d and of L-selectin was measured by flow cytometry. Serum ICAM-1, E-selectin and von Willebrand factor were measured by ELISA. Expression of leukocyte adhesion molecules was significantly higher in patients at baseline than in the controls, except for CD11a. Expression significantly decreased after atorvastatin in most adhesion molecules except for CD11b. In contrast, there was no effect of hypercholesterolemia and/or atorvastatin on the serum endothelial molecules. Leukocyte but not endothelial adhesion molecules were influenced by hypercholesterolemia and by lipid lowering treatment. Leukocyte molecules may therefore be a more sensitive marker of atherogenesis than endothelial molecules. Our results support the role of increased leukocyte adhesiveness in atherogenesis.",

CCl(4) induced toxicity was attenuated after lovastatin pretreatment, which was expressed in less increased values of LDH activity and TBARS levels, as well as in less decreased cell viability and GSH concentrations. However, the pretreatment of hepatocytes with amiodarone abolished the protective effect of lovastatin.",

All patients were started on atorvastatin (80 mg/day) on the day of the procedure, and continued receiving it for at least nine months.Six of the 91 patients (6.5%) experienced a clinical restenosis and underwent target lesion revascularisation; a further two underwent re-PTCA due to progressive atherosclerosis in untreated sites. Seventy-one patients (78.0%; 125 stents) were followed up with angiography after a mean 8.5 months (7-10 months): binary angiographic restenosis was observed in 18/71 patients (25.3%) (in-stent restenosis 21.1%; in-segment restenosis 4.2%), and 17/125 stents (13.6%).We matched 122 lesions (125 stents) from the present population with a reference group of 600 consecutive lesions treated at the Ospedale Maggiore della Carit\u00e0 in Novara during the same period of time, but without high-dose statin treatment: 88 lesions (94 stents) were successfully matched on the basis of the clinical and angiographic variables of diabetes, acute myocardial infarction, treated vessel, reference diameter and lesion length.

    "119": "Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase, is emerging as a key contributor for endothelial dysfunction associated with inflammation. Statins can inhibit vascular inflammatory reaction and improve endothelial function. The aim of this study was to investigate in human endothelial cells the signaling pathways of ADMA-induced inflammatory reaction and potential inhibitory effects of simvastatin. Endothelial cells were cultured and used for all of the studies. Tumor necrosis factor-alpha(TNF-alpha) and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) was assayed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including p38 MAPK and extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK(1/2)), were characterized by Western blot analysis. Treatment with ADMA (3-30 micromol/L) increased the concentration of sICAM-1 in a dose-dependent manner. ADMA (30 micromol/L) significantly enhanced the concentrations of TNF-alpha and sICAM-1, the activity of NF-kappaB and the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and ERK(1/2). The increased secretion of TNF-alpha and sICAM-1 and the increased activity of NF-kappaB by ADMA were altered by SB203580 (5 micromol/L) or PD98059 (20 micromol/L), but not by LY294002 (20 micromol/L). Simvastatin (0.1, 0.5, or 2.5 micromol/L) markedly inhibited the elevated concentrations of TNF-alpha and sICAM-1, the activity of NF-kappaB, and the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and ERK(1/2) induced by ADMA. Simvastatin inhibited ADMA-induced inflammatory reaction by p38 MAPK and ERK(1/2) pathways in cultured endothelial cells.", 
    "120": "Statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, were originally developed to lower cholesterol. Their pleiotropic (or cholesterol-independent) effects at the cellular and molecular levels are highly related to numerous cellular functions, such as proliferation and differentiation. However, they are hardly studied in embryonic stem cells. In this study, we evaluated the effects of statins on mouse ESCs (J1, D3, and RW.4) to enhance our understanding of the molecular basis of ESC self-renewal. Treatment of ESCs with simvastatin, mevastatin, atorvastatin, or pravastatin induced morphological change and decreased cell proliferation. We observed that the use of simvastatin was most effective in all three ESCs. Loss of ESC self-renewal by simvastatin was determined by marked downregulation of ESC markers alkaline phosphatase, Oct4, Nanog, Rex-1, and SSEA-1. Simvastatin effects were selectively reversed by either mevalonate or its metabolite geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) but not by cholesterol or farnesyl pyrophosphate. These results suggest that simvastatin effects were mainly derived from depletion of intracellular pools of GGPP, the substrate required for the geranylgeranylation. Using this approach, we found that GGPP, a derivative of the mevalonate pathway, is critical for ESC self-renewal. Furthermore, we identified that simvastatin selectively blocked cytosol-to-membrane translocalization of RhoA small guanosine triphosphate-binding protein, known to be the major target for geranylgeranylation, and lowered the levels of Rho-kinase (ROCK)2 protein in ESCs. In addition, simvastatin downregulated the ROCK activity, and this effect was reversed by addition of GGPP. Our data suggest that simvastatin, independently of its cholesterol-lowering properties, impairs the ESC self-renewal by modulating RhoA/ROCK-dependent cell-signaling.", 
    "121": "Both statins and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma ligands have been reported to protect against the progression of atherosclerosis. In the present study, we investigated the effects of statins on PPARgamma activation in macrophages. Statins increased PPARgamma activity, which was inhibited by mevalonate, farnesylpyrophosphate, or geranylgeranylpyrophosphate. Furthermore, a farnesyl transferase inhibitor and a geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor mimicked the effects of statins. Statins inhibited the membrane translocations of Ras, RhoA, Rac, and Cdc42, and overexpression of dominant-negative mutants of RhoA (DN-RhoA) and Cdc42 (DN-Cdc42), but not of Ras or Rac, increased PPARgamma activity. Statins induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation. However, DN-RhoA and DN-Cdc42 activated p38 MAPK, but not ERK1/2. ERK1/2- or p38 MAPK-specific inhibitors abrogated statin-induced PPARgamma activation. Statins induced cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression and increased intracellular 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2) (15d-PGJ(2)) levels through ERK1/2- and p38 MAPK-dependent pathways, and inhibitors or small interfering RNA of COX-2 inhibited statin-induced PPARgamma activation. Statins also activate PPARalpha via COX-2-dependent increases in 15d-PGJ(2) levels. We further demonstrated that statins inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor alpha or monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 mRNA expression, and these effects by statins were abrogated by the PPARgamma antagonist T0070907 or by small interfering RNA of PPARgamma or PPARalpha. Statins also induced ATP-binding cassette protein A1 or CD36 mRNA expression, and these effects were suppressed by small interfering RNAs of PPARgamma or PPARalpha. In conclusion, statins induce COX-2-dependent increase in 15d-PGJ(2) level through a RhoA- and Cdc42-dependent p38 MAPK pathway and a RhoA- and Cdc42-independent ERK1/2 pathway, thereby activating PPARgamma. Statins also activate PPARalpha via COX-2-dependent pathway. These effects of statins may explain their antiatherogenic actions.", 
    "122": "Angiotensin II (Ang II) is involved in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation (AF). L-type calcium channel (LCC) expression is altered in AF remodeling. We investigated whether Ang II modulates LCC current through transcriptional regulation, by using murine atrial HL-1 cells, which have a spontaneous calcium transient, and an in vivo rat model. Ang II increased LCC alpha1C subunit mRNA and protein levels and LCC current density, which resulted in an augmented calcium transient in atrial myocytes. An approximately 2-kb promoter region of LCC alpha1C subunit gene was cloned to the pGL3 luciferase vector. Ang II significantly increased promoter activity in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Truncation and mutational analysis of the LCC alpha1C subunit gene promoter showed that cAMP response element (CRE) (-1853 to -1845) was an important cis element in Ang II-induced LCC alpha1C subunit gene expression. Transfection of dominant-negative CRE binding protein (CREB) (pCMV-CREBS133A) abolished the Ang II effect. Ang II (1 micromol/L, 2 hours) induced serine 133 phosphorylation of CREB and binding of CREB to CRE and increased LCC alpha1C subunit gene promoter activity through a protein kinase C/NADPH oxidase/reactive oxygen species pathway, which was blocked by the Ang II type 1 receptor blocker losartan and the antioxidant simvastatin. In the rat model, Ang II infusion increased LCC alpha1C subunit expression and serine 133 phosphorylation of CREB, which were attenuated by oral losartan and simvastatin. In summary, Ang II induced LCC alpha1C subunit expression via a protein kinase C-, reactive oxygen species-, and CREB-dependent pathway and was blocked by losartan and simvastatin.",

A total of 279 consecutive patients who underwent successful primary angioplasty for a first AMI were studied. Contrast-induced nephropathy was defined as an increase in serum creatinine of > or =5 mg/dL after the primary PCI. 56 patients receiving statin treatment before admission had lower incidence of the contrast-induced nephropathy than those without it (7.1% and 20.6%, P<0.01). Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that absence of statin pre-treatment was a significant predictor of the reperfusion arrhythmia along with anterior AMI, baseline creatinine value, time-to-reperfusion, higher volume of the contrast agent. Pre-treatment with statin could reduce the contrast-induced nephropathy after primary coronary intervention in patients with AMI.",

At days 2 , 4 and 7 there was no significant change in mean LDL-C levels in the NLLD group (-10%, -6%, and -9%, all P > 0.09), while there were significant reductions with SIMVA (-15%, -27%, and -25%, respectively, all P < 0.001 vs. day 0) and even greater reductions with co-administration of EZE/SIMVA (-27%, -41%, and -51%, respectively, all P < 0.001 vs. day 0). The percentages of patients achieving LDL-C below 70 mg dL(-1) at days 4 and 7 were substantially greater with EZE/SIMVA (45% and 55%, respectively) than with SIMVA (5% and 10%, respectively), while no NLLD patient reached this goal. Triglyceride levels showed a progressive increase in the NLLD group (+45% at day 7, P < 0.05 vs. day 0), no change in the SIMVA group, but a decrease in the EZE/SIMVA group (-17% at day 7, P < 0.05 vs. day 0).

Present prevention strategies, mainly confined to high-risk subjects (proposed implantable cardioverter defibrillators recipients), have a limited effect on SCD burden in the general population. A relatively unexplored strategy for extending SCD prevention could imply targeting the early (upstream) processes of the complex cascade leading to SCD by non-antiarrhythmic drugs (i.e., beta-blockers, aldosterone antagonists, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor-blocker agents, statins and omega-3 fatty acids). In this innovative pharmacological perspective, agents with upstream effects may also be used in high-risk patients in association with a strictly downstream intervention, such as the implantable cardioverter defibrillator, in an attempt to obtain an additive/synergetic effect.", 
    "130": "To investigate the contribution of genetic polymorphisms of SLCO1B1 and ABCG2 to the pharmacokinetics of a dual substrate, pitavastatin, 2 mg of pitavastatin was administered to 38 healthy volunteers and pharmacokinetic parameters were compared among the following groups: 421C/C(*)1b/(*)1b (group 1), 421C/C(*)1b/(*)15 (group 2), 421C/C(*)15/(*)15 and 421C/A(*)15/(*)15 (group 3), 421C/A(*)1b/(*)1b (group 4), 421A/A(*)1b/(*)1b (group 5), and 421C/A(*)1b/(*)15 (group 6). In SLCO1B1, pitavastatin area under plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC(0-24)) for groups 1, 2, and 3 was 81.1+/-18.1, 144+/-32, and 250+/-57 ng h/ml, respectively, with significant differences among all three groups. In contrast to SLCO1B1, AUC(0-24) in groups 1, 4, and 5 was 81.1+/-18.1, 96.7+/-35.4, and 78.2+/-8.2 ng h/ml, respectively. Although the SLCO1B1 polymorphism was found to have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of pitavastatin, a nonsynonymous ABCG2 variant, 421C>A, did not appear to be associated with the altered pharmacokinetics of pitavastatin.", 
    "131": "Proinflammatory cytokines, like interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), are implicated in the development of atherosclerosis. The role of anti-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-10, is largely unknown. We investigated the association of four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region of the IL-10 gene (4259AG, -1082GA, -592CA, and -2849GA), with coronary and cerebrovascular disease in participants of the PROspective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk (PROSPER) trial. All associations were assessed with Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for sex, age, pravastatin use, and country. Haplotype analysis of the four SNPs showed a significant association between haplotype 4 (containing the -592A variant allele) and risk of coronary events (P = 0.019). Moreover, analysis of separate SNPs found a significant association between -2849AA carriers with incident stroke (HR (95%CI) 1.50 (1.04-2.17), P value = 0.02). Our study suggests that not only proinflammatory processes contribute to atherosclerosis, but that also anti-inflammatory cytokines may play an important role.",

Statins have been reported to demonstrate chemopreventive potentials in prostate cancer cell lines, but the association in observational studies has been inconclusive.Probiotics, defined as live microbial food supplements, have been tested for an impact on a variety of clinical conditions, e.g., urinary tract infections and calcium oxalate stone disease. Furthermore, oral administration of a lactic acid bacterium was effective against experimentally induced bladder tumors.

In addition, there were questions concerning renal adverse effects, particularly dose-dependent proteinuria. Inadequate information was available to know whether the risk of rhabdomyolysis differed from that of other statins. (2) A review of adverse events reported to the FDA in late 2004 showed that reports of renal and muscular adverse events were more frequent with rosuvastatin than with other statins currently on the market. (3) Regulatory agencies analysed their results and issued warnings, but they withheld the raw data. This is regrettable, especially given the frequent use of the drug, the specific risks associated with this class, and the questions that were left unanswered in its initial clinical evaluation. Healthcare professionals and the public need access to more precise data on rosuvastatin. (4) In practice, it is better to select the two statins with the most thorough clinical assessments, namely simvastatin and pravastatin.", 
    "134": "In recent years, remarkable therapeutic advances have been made in the field of interventional cardiology with the introduction of statins, thienopyridines, such as clopidogrel and drug-eluting stents. Only a small minority in developing countries can afford these new treatment modalities, while the public health system would be rapidly bankrupted if it were to provide these modalities for all patients who might benefit from it. The purpose of this review article is to provide insight regarding the cost-effectiveness of these new treatment strategies and to address the added costs resulting upon their adoption and their appropriateness in developing countries.", 
    "135": "Patients excreting large amounts of urinary protein, who are otherwise deemed to be optimally treated, should still be considered at high risk for renal disease progression. The observation that reductions in urinary protein excretion, in a graded fashion over a relatively short period of time, correlate with long-term preservation of renal function supports the idea of using urinary protein excretion as a guide to implementation of renoprotective therapies. The association between residual proteinuria and renal outcomes suggests that minimization of proteinuria is an important therapeutic goal in the management of proteinuric chronic kidney disease patients. This article reviews the evidence for using proteinuria as a target for the implementation of therapies shown to have renal protective effects.", 
    "136": "While a large numbers of clinical trials using various kinds of statins has been reported, a possible preventive effect on new onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus was shown only by the subanalysis of The West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS) using pravastatin. The aim of this study was to investigate whether pravastatin has a preferable effect on glucose tolerance among statins. An open-label prospective cross-over trial was performed to compare the effect of pravastatin (10 mg/day) or atorvastatin (10 mg/day) in Japanese early-state type 2 diabetes mellitus with hypercholesterolemia. The analyzed study subjects were treated with pravastatin (10 mg/day, n = 12) or atorvastatin (10 mg/day, n = 12) for 12 weeks. After a 4-week-washout period, the drugs were switched and treatment was continued for another 12 weeks. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was performed to evaluate several parameters including the appropriateness of beta cell function for the individual insulin sensitivity (disposition index: product of a validated secretion parameter and sensitivity) at the end of each therapy. HbA(1c) and 2 h-glucose levels during OGTT in the pravastatin treatment were significantly lower than atorvastatin treatment. Disposition index after pravastatin treatment was significantly higher than after atorvastatin treatment. In conclusion, our study suggests that pravastatin has a favorable effect on pancreatic beta cell function compared with atorvastatin.",

    "141": "Coadministration of gemfibrozil (600 mg, b.i.d., 3 days) with pravastatin (40 mg/day) decreased the renal clearance of pravastatin by approximately 40% in healthy volunteers. To investigate the mechanism of this drug-drug interaction in the renal excretion process, we undertook an uptake study of pravastatin using human organic anion transporters (hOATs)-expressing S2 cells. hOAT3 and hOAT4 transported pravastatin in a saturatable manner with Michaelis--Menten constants of 27.7 microM and 257 microM respectively. On the other hand, hOAT1 and hOAT2 did not transport pravastatin. Gemfibrozil and its glucuronide and carboxylic metabolite forms inhibited the uptake of pravastatin by hOAT3 with IC(50) values of 6.8 microM, 19.7 microM and 5.4 microM, respectively. Considering the plasma concentrations of gemfibrozil and its metabolites in humans, the inhibition of hOAT3-mediated pravastatin transport by gemfibrozil and its metabolites would lead to a decrease in the renal clearance of pravastatin in clinical settings.", 
    "142": "In most regions of the central nervous system (CNS), the composition of the neuronal microenvironment is maintained by virtue of particular blood-brain-barrier (BBB) characteristics, to which vascular endothelial cells (ECs) contribute an important role. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the CNS, characterized at tissue level by multifocal perivascular infiltrates, predominantly of lymphocytes and macrophages. Thus, lymphocyte recruitment into the brain across ECs of the BBB represents a critical event in disease pathogenesis, which is highly restricted and carefully regulated. In recent years, different investigations have identified the crucial components involved in leukocyte migration, providing new insights into mechanisms modulating neuroinflammatory reactions. In this review, several topics relating to these events are discussed, namely: (1) cellular and molecular characteristics of the BBB regulating permeability, as well as signals inducing EC differentiation in the brain and specific cell properties; (2) pathogenic mechanisms guiding the migration of different leukocyte populations through the BBB in MS; and (3) current knowledge on how different MS therapies targeting leukocytes migration across the BBB function. Furthermore, because the BBB has proven to be an important retaining wall preventing drug passage into the CNS, novel strategies directed at successful delivery of large molecules for effective treatment of various inflammatory conditions of the brain, both currently available or still under development, are discussed.",

Lymphocyte proliferation was inhibited by pitavastatin, and RPA showed down-regulation of interleukin-6 in pitavastatin-treated cardiac allografts. Allografts in the pitavastatin-treated group after 8 weeks showed less GAD compared with the control group. In vitro, pitavastatin suppressed the smooth muscle cell proliferation in response to activated T cells and inhibited extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 activation.",

    "147": "Sterol-regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) control the expression of genes involved in fatty acid and cholesterol biosynthesis. Using microarrays, we observed that mature SREBP-1 also induced the expression of genes unrelated to lipid metabolism, such as heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1), plasma glutathione peroxidase, the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase regulatory subunit p55 gamma, synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A, and COTE1. The expression of these genes was repressed upon addition of sterols, which block endogenous SREBP cleavage, and was induced by the statin drug mevinolin. Stimulation of fibroblasts with platelet-derived growth factor, which activates SREBP-1, had a similar effect. Fasted mice that were refed with a high-carbohydrate diet presented an increased expression of HMOX1 and p55 gamma in the liver. Overall, the transcriptional signature of SREBP-1 in fibroblasts stimulated by growth factors was very similar to that described in liver cells. We analyzed the HMOX1 promoter and found one SREBP binding site of the E-box type, which was required for regulation by SREBP-1a and SREBP-1c but was insensitive to SREBP-2. In conclusion, our data suggest that SREBP-1 regulates the expression of stress response and signaling genes, which could contribute to the metabolic response to insulin and growth factors in various tissues.",

    "149": "We designed a Markov model to compare daily high-dose with conventional-dose statin therapy for hypothetical 60-year-old cohorts with ACS and stable CAD over patient lifetime. Pooled estimates for major clinical end points (all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, rehospitalization, and revascularization) from relevant clinical trials were incorporated. Incremental benefit was quantified as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Threshold analyses determined at what price difference high-dose statins would yield incremental cost-effective ratios below $50,000, $100,000, and $150,000 per QALY gained. In ACS patients, a high-dose versus conventional-dose statin strategy resulted in a gain of 0.35 QALYs. In threshold analyses, a high-dose statin strategy consistently yielded incremental cost-effective ratios below $30,000 per QALY even under conservative model assumptions. In stable CAD patients, a high-dose statin strategy yielded a gain of only 0.10 QALYs and was sensitive to model assumptions about statin efficacy. The daily cost difference between a high- and conventional-dose statin would need to be <$1.70, $2.65, and $3.55 to yield incremental cost-effective ratios below $50,000, $100,000, and $150,000 per QALY.",

In patients with stable CAD, however, the cost-effectiveness of high-dose statin therapy is highly sensitive to model assumptions about statin efficacy and cost.

Case-crossover analysis revealed events that were associated with a return to adherence, including visits with the physician who initiated the statin regimen (odds ratio [OR], 6.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 5.9-6.3), a visit with another physician (OR, 2.9; 95% CI, 2.8-3.0), and a cholesterol test (OR, 1.5; 95% CI, 1.4-1.5). Incident myocardial infarction (OR, 12.2; 95% CI, 8.9-16.9) and other cardiovascular disease-related hospitalizations (OR, 3.6; 95% CI, 3.1-4.3) were also strong predictors of reinitiation of treatment.",

A follow-up visit with the physician who wrote the initial statin prescription and having a cholesterol test predicted reinitiation of statin therapy. Our results suggest that continuity of care combined with increased follow-up and cholesterol testing could promote long-term adherence by shortening or eliminating long gaps in statin use.

A Bayesian change-point regression model was used to determine the rate of maximum uptake (inflection point) for use of cardiac catheterization service and statins after AMI. The inflection points were compared with the corresponding publication dates of the first positive evidence for outcome efficacy of use of cardiac catheterization service and statins after AMI as obtained from randomized control trials.",

The inflection point for post-AMI angiography service use was September 1998, 11 months before the publication of the first positive randomized controlled trial demonstrating benefit of routine post-AMI angiography. Conversely, the inflection point for statin therapy occurred in October 1998, 47 months after the publication of the first positive randomized controlled trial demonstrating the benefits of statin therapy for the secondary prevention of coronary artery disease. These findings were consistent regardless of the presence of on-site cardiac catheterization facilities at the admitting AMI institution and patient illness severity levels.",

    "159": "Our previous studies described a newly identified potential of grapefruit juice (GFJ) in mediating pharmacokinetic drug interactions due to its capability of esterase inhibition. The current study identifies the active components in GFJ responsible for its esterase-inhibitory effect. The esterase-inhibitory potential of 10 constitutive flavonoids and furanocoumarins toward p-nitrophenylacetate (PNPA) hydrolysis was investigated. The furanocoumarins bergamottin, 6',7'-dihydroxybergamottin, and bergapten, and the glycoside flavonoids naringin and hesperidin, at concentrations found in GFJ or higher, did not inhibit the hydrolysis of PNPA by purified porcine esterase and human liver microsomes. However, the flavonoid aglycones morin, galangin, kaempferol, quercetin, and naringenin showed appreciable inhibition of PNPA hydrolysis in purified porcine esterase, and human and rat liver systems. In Caco-2 cells, demonstrated to contain minimal CYP3A activity, the permeability coefficient of the prodrugs lovastatin and enalapril was increased in the presence of the active flavonoids kaempferol and naringenin, consistent with inhibition of esterase activity. In rats, oral coadministration of kaempferol and naringenin with these prodrugs led to significant increases in plasma exposure to the active acids. In addition, in portal vein-cannulated rats, coadministration of lovastatin with kaempferol (10 mg/kg) led to a 154% and a 113% increase in the portal plasma exposure to the prodrug and active acid, respectively, compared with coadministration with water. The contribution of CYP3A inhibition was demonstrated to be minimal. Overall, a series of flavonoids present in GFJ are identified as esterase inhibitors, of which kaempferol and naringenin are shown to mediate pharmacokinetic drug interaction with the prodrugs lovastatin and enalapril due to their capability of esterase inhibition.",

This study focussed on atherogenic protein expression under non-uniform shear stress and the pharmacological modulation of shear-related endothelial dysfunction. Bifurcating flow-through cell culture slides were used to expose HUVECs to steady laminar or non-uniform shear stress for 18 h at 10 dyn/cm(2). Protein expression was determined by immunofluorescence, and quantified using MetaVue software. Laminar shear stress resulted in cell alignment, reduced F-actin fibers, and significant induction of endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression. Under non-uniform shear stress at bifurcations, minor upregulation of adhesion molecules was observed. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) was significantly downregulated by laminar shear stress and induced in cells exposed to non-uniform shear stress. CTGF upregulation by non-uniform shear stress was RhoA-dependent, because it was almost completely inhibited in cells transfected with dominant negative RhoA-N19, and when cells were treated with 1 micromol/L simvastatin during flow. Pre-incubation of HUVECs with inhibitors of Rho-associated kinase before exposure to flow significantly suppressed the CTGF induction in regions of non-uniform shear stress. In conclusion, non-uniform shear stress-dependent CTGF expression requires active RhoA and can be prevented pharmacologically. Interference with shear stress-induced protein expression may inhibit endothelial dysfunction in atheroprone vessel regions.",
