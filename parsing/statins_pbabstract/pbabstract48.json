An abnormality in at least two TEG parameters is considered a hypercoagulable state. Patient data was compared between the hypercoagulable and non-hypercoagulable groups. Potential risk factors for hypercoagulability were analyzed by logistic regression models. Subgroup analysis was performed in hypercoagulable patients. Compared to the non-hypercoagulable MN patients, the hypercoagulable patients showed a significantly higher proportion of female patients, urinary protein, platelet count, triglyceride and fibrinogen level, along with more severe hypoproteinemia and a reduction of serum antithrombin III. Correlation analysis showed that hypoproteinemia was the primary risk factor for hypercoagulability in MN patients. Among the hypercoagulable MN patients, a subgroup TEG parameter analysis showed that glucocorticoids-used subgroup and smoker subgroup had shortened time to initial fibrin formation (R value) and increased coagulation index respectively (P < 0.05), indicating a more serious hypercoagulable state. Meanwhile, the time to initial fibrin formation (R value) and time to clot formation (K value) of the statin-used patients were remarkably higher than those of the non-statin patients. TEG examinations facilitated the detection of hypercoagulable states in MN patients, and hypoproteinemia was the most important risk factor for hypercoagulability in these patients. The use of glucocorticoids and smoking may help to aggravate hypercoagulable states, while statin drugs may alleviate hypercoagulability.",

Statins are hypolipidemic factors and recent studies have demonstrated that they have a protective role during the process of atherogenesis and that they reduce mortality caused by cardiovascular diseases. This review tries to reveal the function of the statins as a component of the primary and secondary action of acute coronary syndrome and to describe the lifestyle changes that have the same effect as the use of statins.",

However, the effects of statins on renal outcomes, including decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and proteinuria in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), are controversial. This meta-analysis evaluated the impact of statins on renal outcomes in patients with CKD.",

The selected dependent variables were: mean particle size (Y1), zeta potential (Y2), drug loading efficiency (Y3), drug encapsulation efficiency (Y4), and yield (Y5). The optimized formulation was assayed for compatibility using an X-ray diffraction assay. In vitro diffusion of the optimized formulation was carried out.

The present study was designed to investigate the effect of pretreatment with SIM on isoproterenol (ISO)-induced cardiac hypertrophy in rats. Twenty-four male albino Wistar rats weighing 180-200 g were divided into four groups. Groups I and III received normal saline while groups II and IV received SIM (10 mg/kg body weight) for 30 days per gavage. In the last 7 days, rats of groups III and IV were administered ISO (5 mg/kg) intraperitoneally to induce cardiac hypertrophy. Administration of ISO induced an increase in heart-to-body weight (HW/BW) ratio, an increase in serum interleukin-6, and elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Serum levels of lipids, cardiovascular risk indices, and cardiac troponin I and creatine phosphokinase-MB showed significant increase in ISO-induced hypertrophic rats. Histopathological examination of heart tissue revealed focal areas of subendocardium degeneration, mononuclear cellular infiltrations, fibrous tissue deposition, and increased thickness of the myocardium of left ventricle. In addition, ISO-administered rats exhibited significant upregulation of cardiac Janus kinase, phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription, and nuclear factor-kappa B. Pretreatment with SIM significantly prevented ISO-induced cardiac hypertrophy, alleviated the altered biochemical parameters, and improved the heart architecture. In conclusion, our study provides evidence that SIM prevented the development of cardiac hypertrophy via modulation of the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription-signaling pathway in the heart of ISO-administered animals.",

This work aims to utilize custom fractional factorial design to assess the development of self-nanoemulsifying drug delivery systems (SNEDDS) and solid nanosuspensions (NS) in order to enhance the oral delivery of atorvastatin (ATR). According to the design, 14 experimental runs of ATR SNEDDS were formulated utilizing the highly ATR solubilizing SNEDDS components: oleic acid, Tween 80, and propylene glycol. In addition, 12 runs of NS were formulated by the antisolvent precipitation-ultrasonication method. Optimized formulations of SNEDDS and solid NS, deduced from the design, were characterized. Optimized SNEDDS formula exhibited mean globule size of 73.5 nm, zeta potential magnitude of -24.1 mV, and 13.5 \u03bcs/cm of electrical conductivity. Optimized solid NS formula exhibited mean particle size of 260.3 nm, 7.4 mV of zeta potential, and 93.2% of yield percentage. Transmission electron microscopy showed SNEDDS droplets formula as discrete spheres. The solid NS morphology showed flaky nanoparticles with irregular shapes using scanning electron microscopy. The release behavior of the optimized SNEDDS formula showed 56.78% of cumulative ATR release after 10 minutes. Solid NS formula showed lower rate of release in the first 30 minutes. Bioavailability estimation in Wistar albino rats revealed an augmentation in ATR bioavailability, relative to ATR suspension and the commercial tablets, from optimized ATR SNEDDS and NS formulations by 193.81% and 155.31%, respectively. The findings of this work showed that the optimized nanocarriers enhance the oral delivery and pharmacokinetic profile of ATR.", 
    "12": "Until recently there was little evidence that statin therapy reduced the risk of stroke recurrence. The SPARCL trial, published in 2006, was the first trial to show the benefits of statin therapy in preventing recurrent stroke. The SPARCL trial showed that treatment with atorvastatin 80mg/day reduced recurrent stroke in patients with a recent stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). Several post hoc analyses of different subgroups followed the SPARCL trial. They have not revealed any significant differences when patients were grouped by age, sex or type of stroke. The SPARCL trial has also helped to identify patients who may have a greater benefit from statins: Patients with carotid stenosis, with more intense lipid lowering, and those who achieve optimal levels of LDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides, and blood pressure. The trial has also helped to identify individuals at high risk of new vascular events. Clearly there is a before and after in stroke prevention since the SPARCL trial was published.",

For the first time, this study describes the simultaneous delivery of a combination of three drugs using a dissolving polymeric MN system. In the present study, aspirin, lisinopril dihydrate, and atorvastatin calcium trihydrate were used as exemplar cardiovascular drugs and formulated into MN arrays using two biocompatible polymers, poly(vinylpyrrollidone) and poly(methylvinylether/maleic acid). Following fabrication, dissolution, mechanical testing, and determination of drug recovery from the MN arrays, in vitro drug delivery studies were undertaken, followed by HPLC analysis. All three drugs were successfully delivered in vitro across neonatal porcine skin, with similar permeation profiles achieved from both polymer formulations. An average of 126.3 \u00b1 18.1 \u03bcg of atorvastatin calcium trihydrate was delivered, notably lower than the 687.9 \u00b1 101.3 \u03bcg of lisinopril and 3924 \u00b1 1011 \u03bcg of aspirin, because of the hydrophobic nature of the atorvastatin molecule and hence poor dissolution from the array.

Yet important gaps in our knowledge remain. For example, knowledge on intracellular cholesterol traffic and its relation to the regulation of cholesterol synthesis and plasma cholesterol levels is incomplete. One way of addressing the remaining questions is by making use of computational models. Here, we critically evaluate existing computational models of cholesterol metabolism making use of ordinary differential equations and addressed whether they used assumptions and make predictions in line with current knowledge on cholesterol homeostasis. Having studied the results described by the authors, we have also tested their models. This was done primarily by testing the effect of statin treatment in each model. Ten out of eleven models tested have made assumptions in line with current knowledge of cholesterol metabolism. Three out of the ten remaining models made correct predictions, i.e. predicting a decrease in plasma total and LDL cholesterol or increased uptake of LDL upon treatment upon the use of statins. In conclusion, few models on cholesterol metabolism are able to pass a functional test. Apparently most models have not undergone the critical iterative systems biology cycle of validation. We expect modeling of cholesterol metabolism to go through many more model topologies and iterative cycles and welcome the increased understanding of cholesterol metabolism these are likely to bring.",

This has contributed to outbreak control, but has done much less to reduce the high mortality rate in individual patients. Ebola patients experience a breakdown in endothelial barrier integrity that leads to massive fluid losses and vascular collapse. Statins and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) maintain or restore endothelial barrier integrity. Local physicians in Sierra Leone have treated approximately 100 consecutive Ebola patients with atorvastatin and irbesartan, and all but two inadequately treated patients have survived. The results of this experience have not been released and they need to be reviewed and validated. Unlike other treatments that target the Ebola virus itself, this 'bottom up' approach to treatment represents a paradigm shift by targeting the host response to infection. Treatment with these safe, inexpensive generic agents could be implemented readily throughout West Africa.",

We examined all meta-analyses of statins for primary prevention over the last 5 years. We assessed whether each meta-analysis addressed five key points: whether authors examined endpoints based on the use of statin therapy, and not stratified by low-density lipoprotein reduction; whether authors included only studies of statin versus placebo, and not varying doses or brands of statin; whether authors considered commonly cited harms; whether secondary prevention patients were excluded; and, whether overall mortality was examined. We examined 189 articles to identify 24 meta-analyses of statins that made claims regarding primary prevention. Six studies (25%) reported outcomes as a function of reduction in serum lipid levels rather than treatment received. Seven studies (29%) included trials of high-dose versus low-dose statin in their analysis. Five studies (21%) did not examine all-cause mortality. The majority of studies (n = 21, 88%) failed to exclude patients with known cardiovascular disease, and 22 (92%) studies failed to assess two of three common safety concerns. Nevertheless, most (n = 20, 83%) meta-analyses supported the use of statins in primary prevention.

Statin therapy also had benefit in reducing all cardiac events (relative risk [RR]\u2009=\u20090.90; 95%CI [0.83,\u20090.97], p\u2009=\u20090.006), but had no effect on cardiovascular deaths (RR\u2009=\u20090.97; 95%CI [0.88,\u20091.07], p\u2009=\u20090.54) or all-cause mortality (RR\u2009=\u20090.98; 95%CI [0.93,\u20091.04], p\u2009=\u20090.49). In conclusion, statins had no impact on all-cause or cardiovascular mortality, while there was an overall significant improvement for dyslipidemia, hs-CRP, hypoalbuminemia and cardiovascular events in dialysis patients.", 
    "46": "Despite decades of research on neuroprotectants in the fight against ischemic stroke, no successful results have been obtained and new alternative approaches are urgently needed. Translation of effective candidate drugs in experimental studies to patients has systematically failed. However, some of those treatments or neuroprotectant diets which demonstrated only beneficial effects if given before (but not after) ischemia induction and discarded for conventional neuroprotection, could be rescued in order to apply an 'advanced neuroprotection strategy' (ADNES). Herein, the authors discuss how re-profiling those neuroprotective candidate drugs and diets with the best potential, some of which are mentioned in this article as an ADNES, may be a good approach for developing successful treatments that protect the brain against ischemic damage. This novel approach would try to protect the brain of patients who are at high risk of suffering a stroke, before damage occurs, in order to minimize brain injury by having the neuroprotectant drug or diet 'on board' if unfortunately stroke occurs.", 
    "47": "Statins are a major group of drugs that reduces LDL-C levels, which are proven to have other beneficial effects such as preventing coronary events. The objective of this study was to evaluate oxidative stress and select novel coronary artery disease risk factors among coronary artery disease patients on statins.", 
    "48": "In this observational, cross-sectional study, we compared total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, lipoprotein (a), homocysteine, reduced glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, ascorbic acid, malondialdehyde and oxidized LDL among male coronary artery disease patients on statin therapy (group 2, n\u00a0=\u00a0151) with sex-matched, diabetic patients (group 3, n\u00a0=\u00a080) as well as healthy controls (group 1, n\u00a0=\u00a084).", 
    "49": "Total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol were significantly lower among subjects of group 2 compared to other two groups. The novel risk factors studied did not differ significantly between groups, except for a higher homocysteine level among group 2 subjects compared to the other two groups. Elevated oxidative stress, indicated by lower reduced glutathione, glutathione peroxidase, and ascorbic acid as well as higher malondialdehyde and oxidized LDL was observed among group 2 subjects. Triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, ascorbic acid and malondialdehyde were found to be independent predictors for coronary artery disease among this study population.",

Novel risk factors were not found to be major predictors for coronary artery disease among the study subjects.", 
    "51": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) constitutes one of the major causes of deaths and disabilities, globally claiming 17.3 million lives a year. Incidence of CVD is expected to rise to 25 million by 2030, and Saudi Arabia, already witnessing a rapid rise in CVDs, is no exception. Statins are the drugs of choice in established CVDs. In the recent past, evidence was increasingly suggesting benefits in primary prevention. But over the last decade Saudi Arabia has a witnessed significant rise in CVD-related deaths. Smoking, high-fat, low-fiber dietary intake, lack of exercise, sedentary life, high blood cholesterol and glucose levels were reported as frequent CVD-risk factors among Saudis, who may therefore be considered for primary prevention with statin. The prevalence of dyslipidemia, in particular, indicates that treatment should be directed at reducing the disorder with lipid-modifying agents and therapeutic lifestyle changes. The recent American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines has reported lowering the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) target levels, prescribed by the 2011 European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/the European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS). The new ACC/AHA guidelines have overemphasized the use of statin while ignoring lipid targets, and have recommended primary prevention with moderate-intensity statin to individuals with diabetes aged 40-75\u00a0years and with LDL-C 70-189\u00a0mg/dL. Treatment with statin was based on estimated 10-year atherosclerotic-CVD (ASCVD) risk in individuals aged 40-75\u00a0years with LDL-C 70 to 189\u00a0mg/dL and without clinical ASCVD or diabetes. Adoption of the recent ACC/AHA guidelines will lead to inclusion of a large population for primary prevention with statins, and would cause over treatment to some who actually would not need statin therapy but instead should have been recommended lifestyle modifications. Furthermore, adoption of this guideline may potentially increase the incidences of statin intolerance and side-effects. On the other hand, the most widely used lipid management guideline, the 2011 ESC/EAC guidelines, targets lipid levels at different stages of disease activity before recommending statins. Hence, the 2011 ESC/EAC still offers a holistic and pragmatic approach to treating lipid abnormalities in CVD. Therefore, it is the 2011 ESC/EAC guidelines, and not the recent ACC/AHA guidelines, that should be adopted to draw guidance on primary prevention of CVD in Saudi Arabia.", 
    "52": "The Hippo signalling is emerging as a tumour suppressor pathway whose function is regulated by an intricate network of intracellular and extracellular cues. Defects in the signal cascade lead to the activation of the Hippo transducers TAZ and YAP. Compelling preclinical evidence showed that TAZ/YAP are often aberrantly engaged in breast cancer (BC), where their hyperactivation culminates into a variety of tumour-promoting functions such as epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, cancer stem cell generation and therapeutic resistance. Having acquired a more thorough understanding in the biology of TAZ/YAP, and the molecular outputs they elicit, has prompted a first wave of exploratory, clinically-focused analyses aimed at providing initial hints on the prognostic/predictive significance of their expression. In this review, we discuss oncogenic activities linked with TAZ/YAP in BC, and we propose clinical strategies for investigating their role as biomarkers in the clinical setting. Finally, we address the therapeutic potential of TAZ/YAP targeting and the modalities that, in our opinion, should be pursued in order to further study the biological and clinical consequences of their inhibition.",

    "54": "We retrospectively analysed age-, weight-, and lipid-matched populations of type 2 diabetic patients of both sexes, who, because of atherogenic dyslipidaemia, were treated with simvastatin (40 mg daily), fenofibrate (200 mg daily), or simvastatin plus fenofibrate. Monocyte release of tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), inteleukin-1\u03b2, interleukin-6, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), as well as circulating levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and free fatty acids (FFA) were assessed separately for men and women before and after 12 weeks of treatment.", 
    "55": "Baseline monocyte release of TNF-\u03b1, interleukin-1\u03b2, interleukin-6, and MCP-1, as well as plasma hsCRP and FFA levels were comparable in both sexes. Simvastatin, fenofibrate, and simvastatin/fenofibrate combination therapy reduced monocyte release of TNF-\u03b1, inteleukin-1\u03b2, interleukin-6, and MCP-1, with no difference between the treatment groups. The impact of simvastatin and fenofibrate administered alone on monocyte cytokine release and systemic inflammation did not differ between the men and women. The effect of simvastatin/fenofibrate combination therapy on monocyte release of interleukin-6 and MCP-1 was more pronounced in the male population. The impact of simvastatin administered together with fenofibrate on TNF-\u03b1, interleukin-1\u03b2, and hsCRP was also stronger in the men than in the women, but the difference did not reach the level of significance.",

    "57": "Since its introduction, endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) has proved as a favourable alternative to open surgery (OR) in the treatment of abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA). Long-term outcomes of EVAR and OR are similar while complications are more likely to develop after EVAR. Risk factors for mortality and complications after AAA surgery have been identified, however, a general overview is lacking.", 
    "58": "In a systematic literature search via PubMed, we identified publications on the topic of factors influencing the postoperative outcome of AAA surgery.", 
    "59": "Patient age >\u200980 years was found to be a significant predictor of increased mortality, whereas the influence of aneurysm diameter on OR remains moderate, the outcome of EVAR performed in AAA >\u20096.5\u2009cm is associated with higher mortality and increased complication rates. In patients with ruptured AAA the postoperative mortality is higher than in those with intact aneurysms. Preoperative haemodynamic instability has a crucial influence on patient outcome and is strongly associated with intra- and postoperative death. The prevalence of cardiovascular co-morbidity leads to increased long-term mortality. Preoperative statin medication was found to reduce short- and long-term mortality by the factor of 0.5. Patients suffering from chronic lung disease such as COPD and patients with a deficiency in renal function are more likely to experience adverse events including death. While the prevalence of cerebrovascular disease is associated with an increase in mortality by the factor of 1.5 or higher, findings on patients with diabetes mellitus are conflicting with no definite point to be made.", 
    "60": "Several factors influencing the outcome of surgery for AAA present a condition developed from factors involved in the pathogenesis of AAA. The impact of non-disease factors like patient age and aneurysm diameter can be reduced by the means of population-wide screening for AAA, and optimised treatment of disease-related risk factors can reduce mortality. Studies comparing the outcome of EVAR and OR in patients with risk factors should be performed to support decision-making about the ideal individual treatment.", 
    "61": "Cholesterol homeostasis maintenance is regulated by a cellular feedback system that senses cholesterol amount in cellular membranes. 3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) plays a pivotal role in cholesterol metabolism as it is the key rate-limiting enzyme of its biosynthetic pathway; its inhibition provokes a feedback response capable of reducing plasma cholesterol content. HMGR inhibition is a keystone in the treatment and prevention of cardiovascular disease and, therefore, statins (HMGR inhibitors) are widely prescribed even though they may sometimes induce side effects. These drugs are prescribed indifferently to both man and women even if there are several well-known differences in cholesterol metabolism depending on the gender and the age. Thus, gender-related differences in cholesterol metabolism should be taken into account to identify new targets for customized pharmacological treatments for hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "62": "The combination of ezetimibe and atorvastatin (Liptruzet - referred to in this article as eze/ator), has recently been approved by the FDA for reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) in patients with primary or mixed hyperlipidemia as in case of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. It helps block intestinal absorption of cholesterol and it inhibits the production of cholesterol in the liver.",

    "64": "The combination of (eze/ator) is proven to be effective in lowering LDL-c. It is not only a safe and effective treatment of hyperlipidemia, but it also reduces inflammatory markers and atherosclerosis. It is not yet clear, however, whether the combination therapy can decrease the risk of diabetes associated with statin administration. Insulin sensitivity is improved by the single administration of ezetimibe, a finding that is documented by several clinical and animal studies. More specifically, ezetimibe has been shown to decrease insulin resistance associated with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The effects of combination therapy that have to be explored in future research and clinical trials include whether this combination can be used in the treatment of NAFLD, cholesterol gallstones and portal hypertension.", 
    "65": "Fenofibrate/simvastatin combination is useful for patients with mixed dyslipidemia. Aim of this review is to critically present the safety aspects of the fenofibrate/simvastatin combination.", 
    "66": "Current evidence regarding the adverse effects of fenofibrate/simvastatin combination is critically presented based on the results of large randomized controlled trials and other relevant studies. Additionally, clinical pharmacology, drug interactions and the effects of fenofibrate and simvastatin on metabolic variables and cardiovascular risk are briefly described.", 
    "67": "Large randomized clinical trials show that the combined administration of fenofibrate with simvastatin is not associated with significantly increased incidence of serious adverse events compared with simvastatin monotherapy. The incidence of rhabdomyolysis is slightly increased with fibrate/statin combination compared with monotherapy but the actual risk is very low. Although fenofibrate increases creatinine and homocysteine serum levels, the incidence of diabetic nephropathy and thrombotic events was not significantly increased with fenofibrate/simvastatin combination compared with simvastatin monotherapy in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) Lipid trial. Furthermore, a decrease in albuminuria was observed with fenofibrate in the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) and ACCORD Lipid trials. Overall, the combined administration of fenofibrate with simvastatin appears to be safe, unless clinicians give fenofibrate/simvastatin combination to patients with predisposing risk factors for the occurrence of adverse events.", 
    "68": "Macrophages recycle components of dead cells, including cell membranes. When quantities of lipids from cell membranes of dead cells exceed processing capacity, phospholipid and cholesterol debris accumulate as atheromas. Plasma lipid profiles, particularly HDL and LDL cholesterol, are important tools to monitor atherosclerosis risk. Membrane lipids are exported, as triglycerides or phospholipids, or as cholesterol or cholesterol esters, via lipoproteins for disposal, for re-use in cell membranes, or for fat storage. Alternative assays evaluate other aspects of lipid pathology. A key process underlying atherosclerosis is backup of macrophage fatty acid catabolism. This can be quantified by accumulation of acylcarnitine intermediates in extracellular fluid, a direct assay of adequacy of \u03b2-oxidation to deal with membrane fatty acid recycling. Further, membranes of somatic cells, such as red blood cells (RBC), incorporate fatty acids that reflect dietary intake. Changes in RBC lipid composition occur within days of ingesting modified fats. Since diets with high saturated fat content or artificial trans-fatty acids promote atherosclerosis, RBC lipid content shifts occur with atherosclerosis, and can show cellular adaptation to pathologically stiff membranes by increased long-chain doubly unsaturated fatty acid production. Additional metabolic changes with atherosclerosis of potential utility include inflammatory cytokine production, modified macrophage signaling pathways, and altered lipid-handling enzymes. Even after atherosclerotic lesions appear, approaches to minimize macrophage overload by reducing rate of fat metabolism are promising. These include preventive measures, and drugs including statins and the newer PCSK9 inhibitors. New cell-based biochemical and cytokine assays provide data to prevent or monitor atherosclerosis progression.", 
    "69": "Obesity is a common cause of hyperlipidemia, which is a major coronary risk factor. Previous studies have shown red yeast rice (RYR) effectiveness in lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of RYR on obesity and hyperlipidemia. Mice were randomly separated into five groups: the control group with a normal diet, the high-fat diet (HFD) group fed a HFD without any treatment, and HFD-fed groups supplemented with RYR (1\u2009g/kg/day for 8 weeks, 1\u2009g/kg/day for 12 weeks, and 2.5\u2009g/kg/day for 8 weeks). Body weight was recorded twice and food intake thrice weekly. Liver and fat pads were surgically removed and weighed. The levels of lipid parameters, liver enzymes, and leptin levels were measured. The HFD feeding resulted in obesity, which was associated with increases in body weight, liver weight, fat pad weight, liver enzymes, and plasma leptin levels with the development of hyperlipidemia. RYR prevented weight gain and fat pad weight in mice fed a HFD. RYR alleviated blood lipid parameters, liver enzymes, and leptin levels, and improved atherogenic index. These findings suggest that RYR has therapeutic potential in treating obesity and hyperlipidemia.",

Study of coronary atheroma by intravascular ultrasound: effect of rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin was a randomized controlled trial employing serial IVUS to evaluate the antiatherosclerotic efficacy of high-dose rosuvastatin and atorvastatin during a 24-month study period. Study of coronary atheroma by intravascular ultrasound: effect of rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin revealed significantly greater coronary atheroma regression in women compared with men, particularly in the setting of lower achieved LDL cholesterol. Results of this analysis also identified a significant interaction between sex and type of statin used.", 
    "72": "These findings support the broad use of statins, especially high-intensity statins, in women with coronary artery disease, who may in fact derive greater benefit than men. These findings also suggest the need for dedicated clinical trials involving women, supporting the notion of more personalized therapeutic strategies for tackling atherosclerotic disease.",

The Overt-Aggression-Scale-Modified-Aggression-Subscale (OASMa) assessed behavioral aggression. A significant sex-statin interaction was deemed to dictate sex-stratified analysis. Exploratory analyses assessed the influence of baseline-aggression, testosterone-change (men), sleep and age.", 
    "75": "The sex-statin interaction was significant (P=0.008). In men, statins tended to decrease aggression, significantly so on pravastatin: difference=-1.0(SE=0.49)P=0.038.

Age\u226440 predicted greater aggression-decline on statins: difference=-1.4(SE=0.64)P=0.026. Aggression-protection was emphasized in those with low baseline aggression: age<40-and-low-baseline-aggression (N=40) statin-difference-vs-placebo=-2.4(SE=0.71)P=0.0016.

The increase was significant, without exclusions, for women of more typical postmenopausal age (\u226545): (N=304) \u03b2=0.68(SE=0.34)P=0.048 - retaining significance with modified age-cutoffs (\u226550 or \u226555). Significance was observed separately for simvastatin. The aggression-increase in women on statins was stronger in those with low baseline aggression (N=175) \u03b2=0.84(SE=0.30)P=0.006. No statin effect on whole blood serotonin was observed; and serotonin-change did not predict aggression-change.",

    "78": "The present study has been deliberated in order to compare the cardioprotective potential of 3-hydroxymethyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, Atorvastatin and Simvastatin in hyperhomocysteinemic rat hearts. L-methionine (1.7 g/kg/day orally) was administered to rats for 4 weeks to produce experimental hyperhomocysteinemia (Hhcy). Isolated Langendorff-perfused normal and hyperhomocysteinemic rat hearts were subjected to global ischemia for 30 min followed by reperfusion for 120 min. The extent of myocardial damage was assessed in terms of myocardial infarct size using triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining, and release of creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) in the coronary effluent; whereas the oxidative stress in the heart was assessed by measuring lipid peroxidation, superoxide anion generation and reduced glutathione. Ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) was noted to produce myocardial injury in normal and hyperhomocysteinemic rat hearts, assessed in terms of increase in myocardial infarct size, LDH and CK in coronary effluent and oxidative stress. Treatment with Atorvatstain (50 \u00b5M) and Simvastatin (10 \u00b5M) afforded cardioprotection against I/R-induced myocardial injury in normal and hyperhomocysteinemic rat hearts as assessed in terms of reductions in myocardial infarct size, LDH and CK levels in coronary effluent and oxidative stress. It may be concluded that reductions in the high degree of oxidative stress may be responsible for the observed cardioprotective potential of Atorva-and Simvastatin, and both statins can be used interchangeably to afford cardioprotection against I/R-induced myocardial injury in normal and hyperhomocysteinemic rat hearts.",

Wistar rats were divided into a blank group and diabetic model group, which was further randomly divided into treatment and control groups. Rats in the treatment group received 10 mg/kg atorvastatin daily, while rats in the blank and control groups received normal saline. Rats were randomly euthanized at 3 or 6 months. Immunohistochemical staining was used to determine changes in VEGI and vascular endothelial growth factor, interleukin-4, and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 levels in rats with diabetic retinopathy. Survival rate in the treatment group was 84% (63/75) after 6 months, which was significantly higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05); rats in the control group showed the lowest survival rate. Survival in the treatment group was higher than that in the control group but not significant compared with the blank group after 3 months. VEGI, vascular endothelial growth factor, tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, and interluekin-4 expression was lower than that in the control group, but higher than the blank group after 3 months. The expression of each factor decreased to the blank group level in the treatment group and was significantly lower than that in the control group after 6 months (P < 0.05). Expression in control and blank groups was similar at 3 and 6 months. Atorvastatin can inhibit VEGI and vascular endothelial growth factor expression to protect rats from diabetic retinopathy.", 
    "81": "We have utilized the enveloped viral model to study the effect of fluvastatin on membrane trafficking in isolated rat myofibers. Our immunofluorescence studies constantly showed that infections in myofibers, which were treated with fluvastatin prior and during the infection with either vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) or influenza A virus, propagated more slowly than in control myofibers without drug treatment. Experiments with a virus expressing Dad1 tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP-Dad1) showed that fluvastatin did not affect its distribution within the ER/SR network and immunofluorescence staining for GM130 did not show any marked effect on the structure of the Golgi components. Furthermore, fluvastatin did not inhibit trafficking of the chimeric transport marker VSV temperature sensitive G protein (tsG-GFP) from the ER to the Golgi. We next subjected VSV infected myofibers for pulse-chase labeling experiments and found that fluvastatin did not slow down the ER-to-Golgi trafficking or Golgi to plasma membrane trafficking of the viral glycoprotein. These studies show that fluvastatin inhibited the propagation of viral infection in skeletal myofibers but no adverse effect on the exocytic trafficking could be demonstrated. These results suggest that other effects of statins rather than inhibition of ER-to-Golgi trafficking might be behind the myotoxic effects of the statins.",

I investigated the antidepressant effect of simvastatin (SMV) on diabetic rats. Rats were divided into control (CTR) and streptozotocin-induced diabetic (STZ) groups and were orally administered 0, 5, or 10 mg/kg of SMV daily for 14 days, then exposed to the forced swimming test (FST). Our results showed that diabetic rats had higher immobility duration than the CTR rats, and SMV decreased this depressive-like behavior in the diabetic rats. However, clomipramine lowered the immobility time in the CTR and STZ rats. STZ decreased serotonin concentration in the hippocampus, which was reversed by SMV and clomipramine. The dopamine concentration in the hippocampus decreased in the STZ groups compared with the CTR groups. However, SMV and clomipramine had no significant effect on the dopamine levels in either the CTR or STZ groups. Corticosterone levels were increased in the untreated STZ group; SMV and clomipramine significantly decreased corticosterone levels in the STZ groups, but had no effect on the CTR groups. In conclusion, SMV exerts an antidepressant-like effect on diabetic rats that are submitted to the FST. The antidepressant-like effect of SMV in the FST appears to be mediated, at least in part, by the biochemical changes to the blood levels of corticosterone and of serotonin concentration in the hippocampus.",

Intratumor o,p'-DDD concentrations in five ACC samples of mitotane-treated patients were found to be independent of cholesterol transporter expression, scavenger receptors, and LDL receptors. In vitro studies showed significant higher antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects and higher cell and mitochondrial uptake of mitotane when H295R cells were grown in LP-F medium.

Lomitapide is extensively metabolized via cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) and is a weak CYP3A inhibitor. Two phase 1 open-label, randomized (1:1), 2-arm drug interaction studies in healthy subjects assessed the effects of atorvastatin and ethinyl estradiol (EE)/norgestimate, both weak CYP3A inhibitors, on lomitapide pharmacokinetics with staggered (separated by 12 hours) or simultaneous administration. All subjects received a single dose of lomitapide (20 mg) in the evening on day 1. Atorvastatin (80 mg once daily, n = 32) or EE/norgestimate (0.035/0.25 mg once daily, n = 32) dosing was initiated on days 11 or 8, respectively, with evening (arm 1) or morning (arm 2) dosing; at steady state (days 15 or 22), a single lomitapide dose was administered; CYP3A inhibitor dosing continued for 6 days. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were taken until 168 hours postdose. With atorvastatin, lomitapide exposure was increased by approximately 2-fold and 1.3-fold, respectively, with simultaneous and staggered administration, respectively. Simultaneous and staggered EE/norgestimate and lomitapide administration resulted in an approximately 1.3-fold increase in lomitapide exposure. Reductions in lomitapide dose may be required for some patients when administered concomitantly with a weak CYP3A inhibitor.",

Thus, at the first moment, the in vitro antifungal activity of simvastatin, atorvastatin and pravastatin was tested against Candida spp. and Cryptococcus spp. Then, in a second approach, considering that the best results were obtained for simvastatin, this drug was evaluated in combination with antifungal drugs against planktonic growth and tested against biofilms of Candida spp. and Cryptococcus spp. Drug susceptibility testing was performed using the microdilution broth method, as described by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. The interaction between simvastatin and antifungals against planktonic cells was analyzed by calculating the fractional inhibitory concentration index. Regarding biofilm susceptibility, simvastatin was tested against growing biofilm and mature biofilm of one strain of each tested yeast species. Simvastatin showed inhibitory effect against Candida spp. and Cryptococcus spp. with minimum inhibitory concentration values ranging from 15.6 to 1000 mg L(-1) and from 62.5 to 1000 mg L(-1), respectively. The combination of simvastatin with itraconazole and fluconazole showed synergism against Candida spp. and Cryptococcus spp., while the combination of simvastatin with amphotericin B was synergistic only against Cryptococcus spp. Concerning the biofilm assays, simvastatin was able to inhibit both growing biofilm and mature biofilm of Candida spp. and Cryptococcus spp. The present study showed that simvastatin inhibits planktonic cells and biofilms of Candida and Cryptococcus species.", 
    "107": "Resistin is an adipokine secreted by macrophages and inflammatory cells linked to insulin resistance and inflammation. Leptin is an adipokine regulator of appetite and obesity. Although circulating levels of both have been associated with atherosclerosis, few data have reported their relation to coronary events in the context of statin therapy. This study measured on-statin levels of both resistin and leptin through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in a nested case-control cohort (n\u00a0= 176 cases with coronary death, myocardial infarction, or unstable angina pectoris observed in follow-up matched 1:1 to 176 controls) derived from the Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 22 study, a randomized controlled trial of atorvastatin 80\u00a0mg/day versus pravastatin 40\u00a0mg/day in patients with a recent acute coronary syndrome. Resistin demonstrated a moderate association with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP; Spearman rho\u00a0= 0.25, p <0.0001). On-statin resistin levels were linked to recurrent coronary events in conditional logistic regression analysis adjusted for additional risk factors including hsCRP and history of diabetes (tertile 3 vs 1 adjusted odds ratio 2.08; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04 to 4.19). An additive risk was noted when patients were stratified by resistin and glycated hemoglobin levels. In contrast, leptin levels were associated with obesity, diabetes, triglycerides, and hsCRP (p <0.001 for each) but demonstrated no association with recurrent coronary events (tertile 3 vs 1 adjusted odds ratio 0.72; 95% CI 0.28 to 1.83). In conclusion, on-statin resistin, but not leptin, is an independent marker of residual risk for recurrent coronary events in patients after hospitalization for an acute coronary syndrome.", 
    "108": "Although randomized studies have shown optimal medical therapy (OMT) to be as efficacious as revascularization in stable coronary heart disease (CHD), the application of OMT in routine practice is suboptimal. We sought to understand the predictors of receiving OMT in stable CHD and its impact on clinical outcomes. All patients with stable CHD based on coronary angiography from October 2008 to September 2011 were identified in Ontario, Canada. OMT was defined as concurrent use of \u03b2 blocker, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor/angiotensin receptor blocker, and statin. Aspirin use was not part of the OMT definition because of database limitations. Multivariable hierarchical logistic models identified predictors of OMT in the 12\u00a0months after angiography. Cox proportional hazard models with time-varying covariates for OMT and revascularization status examined differences in death and nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI). In these models, patients transitioned among 4 mutually exclusive treatment groups: no OMT and no revascularization, no OMT and revascularization, OMT and no revascularization, OMT and revascularization. Our cohort had 20,663 patients. Over a mean period of 2.5\u00a0years, 8.7% had died. Only 61% received OMT within 12\u00a0months. The strongest predictor of receiving OMT at 12\u00a0months was OMT before the angiogram (odds ratio 14.40, 95% confidence interval [CI] 13.17 to 15.75, p <0.001). Relative to no OMT and nonrevascularized patients, patients on OMT and revascularized had the greatest reduction in mortality (hazard ratio 0.52, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.60, p <0.001) and nonfatal MI (hazard ratio 0.74, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.84, p\u00a0<0.001). In conclusion, our study highlights the low rate of OMT in stable CHD. Patients who received both OMT and revascularization achieved the greatest reduction in mortality and nonfatal MI.", 
    "109": "Neurotrophins are important for neuronal health and function. Here, statins, inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase and cholesterol lowering drugs, were found to stimulate expression of neurotrophins in brain cells independent of the mevalonate pathway. Time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) analyses, computer-derived simulation, site-directed mutagenesis, thermal shift assay, and de novo binding followed by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) demonstrates that statins serve as ligands of PPAR\u03b1 and that Leu331 and Tyr 334 residues of PPAR\u03b1 are important for statin binding. Upon binding, statins upregulate neurotrophins via PPAR\u03b1-mediated transcriptional activation of cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB). Accordingly, simvastatin increases CREB and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the hippocampus of Ppara null mice receiving full-length lentiviral PPAR\u03b1, but not L331M/Y334D statin-binding domain-mutated lentiviral PPAR\u03b1. This study identifies statins as ligands of PPAR\u03b1, describes neurotrophic function of statins via the PPAR\u03b1-CREB pathway, and analyzes the importance of PPAR\u03b1 in the therapeutic success of simvastatin in an animal model of Alzheimer's disease.", 
    "110": "The evidence supporting a link between statin use and incident diabetes is seemingly robust; it has been observed in multiple prospective randomized trials and confirmed by meta-analyses. However, differences in survival among statin vs placebo-treated patients in randomized trials might have caused bias with respect to diabetes surveillance. Bias might have been further exaggerated from the strong association between diabetes and cardiovascular events, which were the primary end points in major statin trials. Meta-analyses of randomized trials have demonstrated a 9% increase in the odds of incident diabetes among patients who receive statins compared with placebo (odds ratio [OR], 1.09; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-1.17) and a 12% increase of high-dose statin therapy vs low doses (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.04-1.22). To simulate the possible effect of bias in these meta-analyses, each pooled trial was modified by assuming that 10% of the patients who experienced primary end points subsequently developed diabetes undetected. Meta-analyses of these simulated trials attenuated the association to a nonsignificant level among placebo-controlled trials (simulated OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.98-1.10), and high- vs low-dose trials (simulated OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 1.00-1.15). Our results demonstrate how a small influence of bias in each randomized trial could have contributed substantially to the observed association between statin use and diabetes.", 
    "111": "There has been some evidence for a role of statins in reducing the risk of atrial fibrillation, but the response to statin treatment varies considerably due to environmental and genetic factors. One of these is related to CETP expression. So we assessed whether CETP TaqIB polymorphism influences atrial fibrillation occurrence after treatment with statins. 200 unrelated dyslipidemic Caucasian patients (146 men and 54 women; mean age 75\u00b18) from Salento (Southern Italy), assigned to atorvastatin treatment, and 158 normolipidemic subjects (119 men and 39 women; mean age 75\u00b111), selected from the same ward, were enrolled. All patients were followed at six-month intervals. CETP TaqIB polymorphism was genotyped by RFLP-PCR. During a mean follow-up time of 71\u00b16 months, 64 patients (32%) of the group treated with atorvastatin and 70 subjects (44%) of the group without atorvastatin experienced at least one episode of AF, with a statistically significant difference (p = 0,0208) between the two groups. No significant differences were observed between the two groups with regard to demographic and echocardiographic data, to clinical history and pharmacological treatment. While in patients not assuming atorvastatin there was no significant difference (p = 1) between TaqIB genotype and atrial fibrillation occurence, in subjects treated with atorvastatin B2B2 genotype was more frequent in patients with atrial fibrillation (p = 0,0001). According to these data the subjects with the B2B2 genotype seem to be more susceptible to atrial fibrillation development (RR 2,74; IC 95% 1,92-3,90; p<0.025). Our data seem to provide a further evidence for the hypothesis that statins may have adverse effect in subjects with genetically low CETP levels. Because statins reduce CETP activity up to 30%, we hypothesize that such CETP activity reduction by statins, in patients with low CETP levels induced by polymorphism, may counteract the beneficial effect of statins on atrial fibrillation.", 
    "112": "A cardiologist and respirologist examined the recent, neutral Prospective Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial of Simvastatin in the Prevention of COPD Exacerbations (STATCOPE) for issues of relevance to cardiovascular risk reduction with statin medications. Although the potential benefit of the pleiotropic effects of statins on this inflammatory disease was not borne out, the effect over the longer term on total respiratory and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality remain unexplored. This study was unique as the only statin trial to date to use a national guideline (Adult Treatment Panel III) to exclude patients from the trial if at sufficient cardiovascular risk to warrant statin therapy. Furthermore, observed fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events were shown to provide some evidence to suggest that statins might reduce cardiovascular events despite the low risk category and the relatively low levels of cholesterol. The magnitude of this beneficial trend paralleled the magnitude of lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol achieved in the active statin arm. Finally, the authors questioned whether the current standard of care adequately includes adherence to any national lipid guideline or adequate attention to the cardiovascular comorbidity of these patients. In conclusion, knowledge translation of the STATCOPE trial should at a minimum encourage assessment of cardiovascular risk in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, implementation of proven cardiovascular risk reduction therapies based on national guidelines, including statins, and plans to undertake a trial adequate in size and duration to address cardiovascular event reduction in patients not already eligible for evidence-based risk-reducing therapies.", 
    "113": "The increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has been recognized for many years. However, although the characteristics of CVD and its burden resemble those in diabetes, the focus on cardiovascular (CV) prevention in RA has lagged behind, both in the clinical and research settings. Similar to diabetes, the clinical picture of CVD in RA may be atypical, even asymptomatic. Therefore, a proactive screening for subclinical CVD in RA is warranted. Because of the lack of clinical trials, the ideal CVD prevention (CVP) in RA has not yet been defined. In this article, we focus on challenges and controversies in the CVP in RA (such as thresholds for statin therapy), and propose recommendations based on the current evidence. Due to the significant contribution of non-traditional, RA-related CV risk factors, the CV risk calculators developed for the general population underestimate the true risk in RA. Thus, there is an enormous need to develop adequate CV risk stratification tools and to identify the optimal CVP strategies in RA. While awaiting results from randomized controlled trials in RA, clinicians are largely dependent on the use of common sense, and extrapolation of data from studies on other patient populations. The CVP in RA should be based on an individualized evaluation of a broad spectrum of risk factors, and include: 1) reduction of inflammation, preferably with drugs decreasing CV risk, 2) management of factors associated with increased CV risk (e.g., smoking, hypertension, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, kidney disease, depression, periodontitis, hypothyroidism, vitamin D deficiency and sleep apnea), and promotion of healthy life style (smoking cessation, healthy diet, adjusted physical activity, stress management, weight control), 3) aspirin and influenza and pneumococcus vaccines according to current guidelines, and 4) limiting use of drugs that increase CV risk. Rheumatologists should take responsibility for the education of health care providers and RA patients regarding CVP in RA. It is immensely important to incorporate CV outcomes in testing of anti-rheumatic drugs.", 
    "114": "Hydrogen (H(2)) attenuates the development of atherosclerosis in mouse models. We aimed to examine the effects of H(2) on atherosclerotic plaque stability. Low-density lipoprotein receptor-knockout (LDLR(-/-)) mice fed an atherogenic diet were dosed daily with H(2) and/or simvastatin. In vitro studies were carried out in an oxidized-LDL (ox-LDL)-stimulated macrophage-derived foam cell model treated with or without H(2). H(2) or simvastatin significantly enhanced plaque stability by increasing levels of collagen, as well as reducing macrophage and lipid levels in plaques. The decreased numbers of dendritic cells and increased numbers of regulatory T cells in plaques further supported the stabilizing effect of H(2) or simvastatin. Moreover, H(2) treatment decreased serum ox-LDL level and apoptosis in plaques with concomitant inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and reduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation in the aorta. In vitro, like the ERS inhibitor 4-phenylbutyric acid, H(2) inhibited ox-LDL- or tunicamycin (an ERS inducer)-induced ERS response and cell apoptosis. In addition, like the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine, H(2) inhibited ox-LDL- or Cu(2+) (an ROS inducer)-induced reduction in cell viability and increase in cellular ROS. Also, H(2) increased Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor-2, an important factor in antioxidant signaling) activation and Nrf2 small interfering RNA abolished the protective effect of H(2) on ox-LDL-induced cellular ROS production. The inhibitory effects of H(2) on the apoptosis of macrophage-derived foam cells, which take effect by suppressing the activation of the ERS pathway and by activating the Nrf2 antioxidant pathway, might lead to an improvement in atherosclerotic plaque stability.", 
    "115": "Postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) is a common complication of cardiac surgery that occurs in up to 60% of patients. POAF is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular mortality, stroke and other arrhythmias that can impact on early and long term clinical outcomes and health economics. Many factors such as disease-induced cardiac remodelling, operative trauma, changes in atrial pressure and chemical stimulation and reflex sympathetic/parasympathetic activation have been implicated in the development of POAF. There is mounting evidence to support a major role for inflammation and oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of POAF. Both are consequences of using cardiopulmonary bypass and reperfusion following ischaemic cardioplegic arrest. Subsequently, several anti-inflammatory and antioxidant drugs have been tested in an attempt to reduce the incidence of POAF. However, prevention remains suboptimal and thus far none of the tested drugs has provided sufficient efficacy to be widely introduced in clinical practice. A better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for the onset and persistence of POAF is needed to develop more effective prediction and interventions.", 
    "116": "Atorvastatin is the most commonly used of all statins to lower cholesterol. Atorvastatin is extensively metabolized in both gut and liver to produce several active metabolites. The purpose of the present study is to develop a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model for atorvastatin and its two primary metabolites, 2-hydroxy-atorvastatin acid and atorvastatin lactone, using in vitro and in vivo data. The model was used to predict the pharmacokinetic profiles and drug-drug interaction (DDI) effect for atorvastatin and its metabolites in different DDI scenarios. The predictive performance of the model was assessed by comparing predicted results to observed data after coadministration of atorvastatin with different medications such as itraconazole, clarithromycin, cimetidine, rifampin and phenytoin. This population based PBPK model was able to describe the concentration-time profiles of atorvastatin and its two metabolites reasonably well in the absence or presence of those drugs at different dose regimens. The predicted maximum concentration (Cmax), area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) values and between-phase ratios were in good agreement with clinically observed data. The model has also revealed the importance of different metabolic pathways on the disposition of atorvastatin metabolites. This PBPK model can be utilized to assess the safety and efficacy of atorvastatin in the clinic. This study demonstrated the feasibility of applying PBPK approach to predict the DDI potential of drugs undergoing complex metabolism.", 
    "117": "Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death in most countries, with the high prevalence currently driven by dual epidemics of obesity and diabetes. Statin drugs, the most effective, evidence-based agents to prevent and treat this disease, have a central role in management and are advised in all published guidelines. The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) cholesterol and assessment guidelines ('new ACC/AHA guidelines') emphasized global cardiovascular (CV) risk reduction as opposed to targeting low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, stressed the use of statins in two dose intensities, utilized a new risk calculator using pooled cohort equations, and lowered the risk cutoff for initiation of statin therapy. Although there were major strengths of the new ACC/AHA guidelines, substantial controversy followed their release, particulars of which are discussed in this review. They were generally regarded as improvements in an ongoing transition using evidenced-based data for maximum patient benefit. Several guidelines, other than the ACC/AHA guidelines, currently provide practitioners with choices, some depending on practice locations. Cholesterol control with statin drugs is used in all paradigms. However, some patients respond inadequately, approximately 15% are intolerant, and other factors prevent attaining cholesterol goals in as many as 40% of patients. Even after treatment, substantial residual risk for ongoing major events remains. Another readily available modality that can rival statin drugs in effectiveness is vast improvement in diet and lifestyle within the general population; however, despite great effort, existing programs to implement such changes have failed. Hence, despite unrivaled success, there is great need for additional drugs to prevent and treat CHD, whether as monotherapy or in combination with statin drugs. New American guidelines do not discuss or recommend any nonstatin drugs for CHD, and the US FDA has moved away from approving drugs based solely on changes in surrogates in the absence of clinical outcomes trials. Both have significantly altered the realities of developing pharmacotherapies and cardiology practice.",

    "122": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been the number one cause of death in the U.S. for 114 of the last 115 years. Risk factors for prostate cancer have primarily mirrored risk proven risk factors for CVD, especially aggressive disease. Obesity, dyslipidemia, glucose intolerance, metabolic syndrome, unhealthy dietary habits or caloric excess, lack of physical activity, and inflammation are just some of these shared risk factors. The evidence also suggests proven CVD preventive measures are identical to prostate cancer preventive measures, especially in regard to aggressive disease. Thus, apart from lifestyle measures that can encourage optimal heart and prostate health there are potentially several dietary supplements that need to be avoided in healthy men because they may also increase the risk of prostate cancer. However, there are also several low-cost, generic, safe in the appropriate individuals, and naturally derived agents that could reduce prostate cancer risk, and these can be discussed and remembered utilizing the acronym S.A.M. (statins, aspirin, and/or metformin).",

Simvastatin was administered perorally for donor (5 mg/kg) and/or for recipient (2 mg/kg) 2 hours before transplantation and/or as daily treatment starting on the first postoperative day (2 mg/kg/day). The study included 5 groups: (1) no simvastatin, (2) donor pretreatment, (3) daily recipient treatment, (4) donor pretreatment + daily recipient treatment and (5) donor pretreatment + recipient pretreatment + daily recipient treatment. The grafts were recovered at day 90 for histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis. Kidney function was followed weekly with serum creatinine, and 24-hour urine protein was measured 60 and 90 days after transplantation.",

Classical risk factors (age, smoking, obesity, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia) may result in the progression of atherosclerotic lesions by processes including inflammation and lipid accumulation. Thus, the evaluation of blood lipids and the full lipid complement produced by cells, organisms, or tissues (lipidomics) is an issue of importance. In this review, we shall describe the recent progress in vascular health research using lipidomic advances. We will begin with an overview of vascular wall biology and lipids, followed by a short analysis of lipidomics. Finally, we shall focus on the clinical implications of lipidomics and studies that have examined lipidomic approaches and vascular health.",

Moreover, a large number of subjects cannot tolerate statins or full doses of these drugs, in particular patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. Thus, there is a need for additional effective LDL cholesterol-reducing agents. Evolocumab (AMG145) is a monoclonal antibody inhibiting proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 that binds to the liver LDL receptor and prevents it from normal recycling by targeting it for degradation. Phase I, II, and III trials revealed that, on subcutaneous injection, either alone or in combination with statins, evolocumab is able to reduce high LDL cholesterol levels from 54% to 80%, apolipoprotein B100 from 31% to 61%, and lipoprotein(a) from 12% to 36%, in a dose-dependent manner. The incidence of side effects seems to be low and mainly limited to nasopharyngitis, injection site pain, arthralgia, and back pain. Evolocumab is an innovative powerful lipid-lowering drug, additive to statins and/or ezetimibe, with a large therapeutic range associated with a low rate of mild adverse events. If the available data are confirmed in long-term trials with strong outcome measures, evolocumab will become an essential tool in the treatment of a large number of high-risk patients, such as those affected by familial hypercholesterolemia, those who are unable to tolerate an efficacious statin dosage, and those at very high cardiovascular risk and unable to achieve their target LDL cholesterol levels with currently available lipid-lowering therapies.",

Heterozygous ABCA1 mutation carriers had a 20% higher target:background ratio than in controls (target:background ratio; P=0.008). In carriers using statins (n=7), target:background ratio was 21% reduced than in nonstatin users (n=7; P=0.03). We then measured plasma cytokine levels. Tumor necrosis factor \u03b1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and interleukin-6 levels were increased in heterozygous and homozygous ABCA1 mutation carriers. We isolated monocytes from carriers and controls and measured inflammatory gene expression. Only TNF\u03b1 mRNA was increased in monocytes from heterozygous ABCA1 mutation carriers.

The first one was a genetically engineered model, mogp-TAg, in which the promoter of oviduct glycoprotein-1 was used to drive the expression of SV40 T-antigen in gynecologic tissues. These mice spontaneously developed serous tubal intraepithelial carcinomas (STICs), which are known as ovarian cancer precursor lesions. The second model was a xenograft tumor model in which human ovarian cancer cells were inoculated into immunocompromised mice. Mice in both models were treated with lovastatin, and effects on tumor growth were monitored. The molecular mechanisms underlying the antitumor effects of lovastatin were also investigated.", 
    "154": "Lovastatin significantly reduced the development of STICs in mogp-TAg mice and inhibited ovarian tumor growth in the mouse xenograft model. Knockdown of prenylation enzymes in the mevalonate pathway recapitulated the lovastatin-induced antiproliferative phenotype. Transcriptome analysis indicated that lovastatin affected the expression of genes associated with DNA replication, Rho/PLC signaling, glycolysis, and cholesterol biosynthesis pathways, suggesting that statins have pleiotropic effects on tumor cells.",

    "160": "Statin intake has been reported to reduce the risk of several malignancies beyond its cholesterol-lowering effects. However, little is known regarding the survival benefit of statins for patients with colorectal cancer (CRC).We conducted a systematic literature search of multiple databases for studies published before November 2014, which investigated associations between statin intake and CRC prognosis. Meta-analysis was performed using random-effects model. The primary outcomes of interest were all-cause mortality (ACM) and cancer-specific mortality (CSM).Ten studies involving 76,851 patients were eligible for this meta-analysis, with 7 studies investigating prediagnosis statin use and 5 studies reporting postdiagnosis statin use. Prediagnosis statin use was associated with reduced ACM (hazard ratio [HR] 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.61-0.88, P\u200a=\u200a0.001) and CSM (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.77-0.84, P\u200a<\u200a0.001) for patients with CRC. This effect persisted when stratified by tumor site and in studies adjusted by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use. In addition, postdiagnosis statin use was associated with decreased CSM (HR 0.70, 95% CI 0.60-0.82, P\u200a<\u200a0.001). However, we did not note reduced ACM for postdiagnosis statin use (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.68-1.27, P\u200a=\u200a0.639). There appeared to be an association between postdiagnosis statin use and increased ACM in KRAS-mutated CRC.Our findings provide evidence that prediagnosis statin therapy was associated with reduced ACM and CSM in CRC patients; postdiagnosis statin therapy indicated decreased CSM. However, findings may not apply to patients with postdiagnosis statin therapy for ACM. Further studies are warranted to determine the relation between statin dose and duration on CRC survival.",

Five weeks previously, the patient started a course of clarithromycin for infection of a finger wound with Mycobacterium marinum. His current medications included simvastatin, which he continued along with clarithromycin. The severity of the acute kidney injury necessitated initial continuous venovenous haemofiltration followed by 12 haemodialysis sessions before a spontaneous improvement in renal function occurred. Statins are widely prescribed and we report this case to encourage increased vigilance in avoiding drug interactions known to increase the risk of statin-induced myopathy, including macrolide antibiotics, calcium channel antagonists and amiodarone. The authors would also like to highlight recent guidance on atorvastatin as the statin of choice in patients with chronic kidney disease, and of the need for dose adjustment in those with an estimated glomerular filtration rate less than 30 mLs/min/1.73 m\u00b2.",

Adherence (proportion of days covered [PDC]) with oral hypoglycemic agents, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, and statins was tracked for 6 months before and after the diagnosis date. Multivariable regression models assessed the independent impact of a cancer diagnosis, life expectancy (proxy measure: died 7 to 12 months after index date), and coverage generosity (proxy measure: low-income subsidy recipient) on PDC, controlling for individual characteristics.",

This study evaluates the effects of diet alone or in combination with atorvastatin therapy on the progression/regression of atherosclerosis and its correlation with NAFLD. This research was performed on a cohort of chickens on standard (SD) or hyperlipidemic diets (HD), either with or without atorvastatin therapy. The development of atherosclerotic lesions was assessed by histology, immunohistochemistry and quantitative image analysis and correlated with liver histology. The lowest levels of atherosclerotic lesions were found in animals on the HD for 3 months, followed by 3 months of SD in combination with oral atorvastatin. There was a strong association between the histologic findings of atherosclerosis and those of NAFLD. These studies show that standard diet and atorvastatin therapy can positively affect both arterial and hepatic lesions, influencing the regression of the changes. These results support the hypothesis that NAFLD and atherosclerosis may be actually two aspects of a shared disease and suggest the possibility of regression of both disorders with dietary and pharmacologic manipulations.",

Exclusion criteria were: tobacco consumption, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, aspirin or statin treatment. Brachial artery (BA) FMD after release of hand ischemia and glyceryl trinitrate (GTN)-induced EID was measured using a high-resolution radiofrequency-based echotracking system blind to the diagnosis.",

SBP was higher in FD (125\u200a\u00b1\u200a15mmHg) and EH (121\u200a\u00b1\u200a12mmHg) than EH (113\u200a\u00b1\u200a10mmHg) despite antihypertensive treatments. BA external diameter was significantly lower in FD than in both HS and EH before, during and after hand ischemia and after GTN. BA intima media thickness (IMT), internal diameter did not differ between the 3 groups. FMD (%) or EID (%) did not significantly differ between the 3 groups. BA flow velocity did not significantly differ in any experimental condition.(Figure is included in full-text article.)",

    "182": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) represents the most common and lethal chronic disease worldwide. Lipids levels are the strongest risk factors for CVD and this is demonstrated by the fact that lipid-lowering statin therapy is largely used to prevent CVD. The role of the KIF6 gene in response to the statin therapy is controversial, and the biological mechanism through which it may act is still unknown.We investigated the role of KIF6 locus variants alone and their interaction with the well-established lipid locus at HMGCR in the variability of metabolic traits and in response to statin therapy in an Italian sample.", 
    "183": "We genotyped two intronic rs20455, rs9462535 and a coding rs9471077 within the KIF6 gene, as well as two non-coding rs3761740 and rs3846662 at HMGCR. We tested the association of these SNPs with 19 cardiometabolic phenotypes and lipid-lowering therapy response in a sample of 1645 individuals from the Brisighella cohort (BC).", 
    "184": "Established rs3846662 (Willer et al, Nat Gen 2013) at HMGCR is associated (P\u200a=\u200a8.5x10-4) with LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) in BC. We did not find any significant association of KIF6 variants with response to statin therapy. We observe a locus-wide significant association at KIF6 between rs9471077 and APOB levels and rs20455 and HDL-C (P less than 0.001). rs3761740 at HMGCR showed an effect on systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP, P less than 0.007), which however wasn't significant after multiple testing correction.", 
    "185": "This is the first genetic study reported for Brisighella cohort, which confirms association with LDL-C at HMGCR locus. We noticed an effect of KIF6 variants on APOB and HDL-C, while we don't observe any effect on statin therapy. The study sample is relatively small to discover a common variant effect and might still be due to chance; therefore, we are seeking for replication in additional cohorts. These findings, if confirmed, might contribute to development of approaches for stratified patient care.", 
    "186": "Retirement has been suggested to reduce medication adherence, but no evidence is available for statins. We investigated changes in adherence to statins among Swedish adults after retirement.", 
    "187": "A prospective cohort study was carried out on all individuals living in Sweden on 31 December 2004, alive in 2010, having purchased statins in the second half of 2005, and retired in 2008 (n=11 718). We used prescription dispensing data in 2006-2010 to determine nonadherence (defined as <80% of days covered by filled prescriptions) before and after old-age or disability retirement. Using multiple repeat measurements of filled statin prescriptions, we calculated the annual prevalence rates of nonadherence for those who continued therapy. Discontinuation was defined as no statin dispensations during a calendar year.", 
    "188": "After adjustment for age at retirement, the prevalence ratio (PR) of nonadherence after retirement in comparison with those before retirement was 1.23 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.17-1.29] for the men and 1.19 (95% CI 1.13-1.26) for the women. A post-retirement increase in nonadherence was consistently observed across the strata of age at retirement, marital status, education, income, type of retirement, and participants with and without cardiovascular disease, the largest increases being observed for statin use in secondary prevention (men: PR 1.38, 95% CI 1.26-1.54; women: PR 1.43, 1.18-1.72). For primary prevention, the corresponding prevalence ratios were 1.18 (95% CI 1.13\u20121.25) and 1.18 (95% CI 1.11-1.24), respectively.", 
    "189": "Retirement appears to be associated with increased nonadherence to statin therapy among Swedish men and women.", 
    "190": "C-reactive protein (CRP) level is associated with the 10-year risk of an atherosclerotic vascular disease (ASVD), suggesting presence of systemic inflammation probably long before ASVD is present. Where, however, does this systemic inflammation come from? One active area of research has been the study of dental infection and various forms of periodontal disease (PD), both of which are highly prevalent in populations at risk for ASVD. Recent data show that ASVD and PD interact with each other via systemic release of specific pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, small signal molecules and enzymes which modulate initiation and progression of the chronic inflammatory reaction involved in both diseases. In addition, periodontal pathogens were identified within atherosclerotic lesions and thrombi isolated from myocardial infarction patients. LDL cholesterol, a strong risk factor for ASVD, is also associated with PD; and statins, used to treat ASVD, are also active to prevent or reduce PD. Finally, there is growing evidence for common genetic susceptibility factors involved in both diseases. These findings support commonalities with respect to the pathogenic mechanisms involved in both inflammatory diseases. Conversely, a causative relationship cannot yet be concluded in the absence of data from large longitudinal cohort and randomized controlled intervention trials.", 
    "191": "European guidelines acknowledge that patients with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) should have LDLc levels below 70mg/dL or reduced a 50% respect to their basal levels. However, some studies demonstrated that this goal is achieved in a small number of patients. The aim of this study was to determine how cardiologists (MC) and primary care specialist (GPs) from Spain manage LDLc in ACS patients during their daily practice.", 
    "192": "An observational, cross-sectional, multicentric study was conducted. Information about daily practice was obtained from 291 MC and 564 GPs across Spain.", 
    "193": "68% of MC and 67% of GPs considered ACS patients to be high-risk. Most consider the cLDL targets based on European guidelines. The statins most widely used for MC are atorvastatin and rosuvastatina and for GPs are atorvastatin and simvastatin. 66.4% of GPs follow the prescription of MC. 42% of MC and 19.9% of GPs considered that 75-100% of their patients achieved the LDLc target. The main reason of not achieving this target was lack of treatment adherence.", 
    "194": "The lack of adherence and poor perception of real LDLc control may contribute to the failure in achieving lipid targets in ACS patients.", 
    "195": "Pharmaceutical direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) is widely prevalent on US television. This study tests the relationship between estimated exposure to DTCA for statin drugs, which often feature mixed messages about the efficacy of diet and exercise in reducing risk of cholesterol and heart disease, and guilty feelings regarding food and exercise.", 
    "196": "A series of repeated cross-sectional surveys of the US population between 2001 and 2007 (N=106,859 adults aged 18 and older) were combined with data on the frequency of DTCA appearances on national, cable, and local television during the same time period.", 
    "197": "Adjusting for potential confounders with ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, increased potential exposure to statin DTCA was associated with increased food guilt (in a dose-response pattern) and exercise guilt (in a threshold pattern).",

    "199": "Health practitioners should be prepared to encounter and counsel patients who are prompted by DTCA to feel guilty about their food and exercise behaviors, feelings which may impact the likelihood of adherence to prescribed behavioral modification for weight management.", 
    "200": "Rosuvastatin is used to treat dyslipidemia and its use is quite frequent among postmenopausal women. Menopause significantly affects the pharmacokinetics of drugs, and altered drug response and therapeutic efficacy may be anticipated in postmenopausal women compared with premenopausal women. The current study is based on assessment of differences in pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin between pre- and postmenopausal women of Asian ethnicity.", 
    "201": "Volunteers were administered a single oral dose of rosuvastatin 40\u00a0mg in an open-label and non-controlled pharmacokinetic study.

    "203": "Rosuvastatin plasma level was significantly higher in premenopausal compared with postmenopausal women, which raises the question whether the latter are getting due therapeutic results, as after the menopause women experience more frequent cardiovascular problems and dyslipidemia.", 
    "204": "In December 2014, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) approved a joint clinical practice guideline for the management of dyslipidemia for cardiovascular disease risk reduction in adults. This synopsis summarizes the major recommendations.",

    "207": "Statins are commonly used against arteriosclerotic disease, but recent retrospective analyses have suggested that statins also prevent cancer. The aim of this systematic review is to verify the vitro anti-tumor effects of statins on head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.", 
    "208": "Studies were gathered by searching Cochrane, MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and PubMed, up until May 9, 2015, with no time or language restrictions. Only in vitro studies that discuss the effect of statins on head and neck carcinoma were selected.", 
    "209": "Of 153 identified papers, 14 studies met the inclusion criteria. These studies demonstrated that statins had a significant effect on head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines and influenced cell viability, cell cycle, cell death, and protein expression levels involved in pathways of carcinogenesis, which corroborates with the potential in vitro anti-tumor effects. It provides highlights about the biological mechanisms of statins used alone or associated with traditional therapy for cancer.", 
    "210": "Though there are few studies on the topic, currently available evidence suggests that statins shows that preclinical experiments supports the potentiality of statin as an adjuvant agent in chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy approaches routinely used in the management of HNSCC and should undergo further clinical assessment.", 
    "211": "The first objective was to investigate if intracellular and extracellular levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within the mouse aorta increase before or after diet-induced lesion formation. The second objective was to investigate if intracellular and extracellular ROS correlates to cell composition in atherosclerotic lesions. The third objective was to investigate if intracellular and extracellular ROS levels within established atherosclerotic lesions can be reduced by lipid lowering by diet or atorvastatin.", 
    "212": "To address our objectives, we established a new imaging technique to visualize and quantify intracellular and extracellular ROS levels within intact mouse aortas ex vivo. Using this technique, we found that intracellular, but not extracellular, ROS levels increased prior to lesion formation in mouse aortas. Both intracellular and extracellular ROS levels were increased in advanced lesions. Intracellular ROS correlated with lesion content of macrophages. Extracellular ROS correlated with lesion content of smooth muscle cells. The high levels of ROS in advanced lesions were reduced by 5 days high dose atorvastatin treatment but not by lipid lowering by diet. Atorvastatin treatment did not affect lesion inflammation (aortic arch mRNA levels of CXCL 1, ICAM-1, MCP-1, TNF-\u03b1, VCAM, IL-6, and IL-1\u03b2) or cellular composition (smooth muscle cell, macrophage, and T-cell content).", 
    "213": "Aortic levels of intracellular ROS increase prior to lesion formation and may be important in initiation of atherosclerosis. Our results suggest that within lesions, macrophages produce mainly intracellular ROS whereas smooth muscle cells produce extracellular ROS. Short term atorvastatin treatment, but not lipid lowering by diet, decreases ROS levels within established advanced lesions; this may help explain the lesion stabilizing and anti-inflammatory effects of long term statin treatment.", 
    "214": "Statins represent the most widely prescribed drugs. Accordingly, in daily practice statin-related muscle pain and other myopathic sensations are frequently seen. In this practice review the clinical approach to statin myopathy is discussed.", 
    "215": "Epidemiological and experimental studies indicate that high cholesterol may increase susceptibility to age-associated neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, it has been suggested that statins, which are inhibitors of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), may be a useful therapeutic tool to diminish the risk of AD. However, several studies that analyzed the therapeutic benefits of statins have yielded conflicting results. Herein, we investigated the role of lovastatin on neuronal cholesterol homeostasis and its effects on amyloid \u03b2 protein production in vivo and in vitro.", 
    "216": "Lovastatin effects were analyzed in vitro using differentiated human neuroblastoma cells and in vivo in a lovastatin-fed rat model. We demonstrated that lovastatin can differentially affect the expression of APP and A\u03b2 production in vivo and in vitro. Lovastatin-induced HMGCR inhibition was detrimental to neuronal survival in vitro via a mechanism unrelated to the reduction of cholesterol. We found that in vivo, dietary cholesterol was associated with increased A\u03b2 production in the cerebral cortex, and lovastatin was not able to reduce cholesterol levels. However, lovastatin induced a remarkable increase in the mature form of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 (SREBP-2) as well as its target gene HMGCR, in both neuronal cells and in the brain.", 
    "217": "Lovastatin modifies the mevalonate pathway without affecting cholesterol levels in vivo and is able to reduce A\u03b2 levels only in vitro.", 
    "218": "Atherosclerosis is a multifactorial condition characterized by endothelial injury, fatty streak deposition, and stiffening of the blood vessels. The pathogenesis is complex and mediated by adhesion molecules, inflammatory cells, and smooth muscle cells. Statins have been the major drugs in treating hypercholesterolemia for the past two decades despite little efficacy. There is an urgent need for new drugs that can replace statins or combined with statins. The preclinical studies evaluating atherosclerosis require an ideal animal model which resembles the disease condition, but there is no single animal model which mimics the disease. The animal models used are rabbits, rats, mice, hamsters, mini pigs, etc. Each animal model has its own advantages and disadvantages. The method of induction of atherosclerosis includes diet, chemical induction, mechanically induced injuries, and genetically manipulated animal models. This review mainly focuses on the various animal models, method of induction, the advantages, disadvantages, and the current perspectives with regard to preclinical studies on atherosclerosis."
