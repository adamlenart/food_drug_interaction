    "2": "Data for this study were obtained from the PHARMO medical record linkage system in the Netherlands. Participants were patients with a new statin and no statin prescription in the preceding year. The outcome, discontinuation, was defined based on a variable number of days without medication after exposure (gaps) or based on the availability of supplies 12 months after the inclusion date (at 1 year). Exposure to statins was assessed by 2 methods. The method termed No Overlap accounted for only the supplies of the last prescription to calculate exposure, and the method termed Overlap accounted for all supplies from previous prescriptions. We investigated the effect of 4 exposure outcome combinations on statin discontinuation estimates.", 
    "3": "The exposure outcome combinations, including overlap, resulted in a 7% unit lower discontinuation rate. At gap lengths of 90 days and longer, no significant differences between No Overlap and Overlap were observed. Shorter minimum gap lengths gave higher discontinuation rates compared to longer minimum gap lengths and ranged from as high as 86% to 21%.", 
    "4": "If previous supplies are accounted for in the calculation of exposure to statins, lower discontinuation rates are observed. The influence of previous supplies on discontinuation rates is less pronounced than the influence of gap lengths. The calculation of exposure does not influence discontinuation if gaps longer than 90 days are used to assess discontinuation.", 
    "5": "We report a case of reversible cerebral vasoconstriction, possibly secondary to the use of indomethacin to relieve pain during a migraine with aura attack. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are not reported among substances precipitating secondary forms of reversible cerebral vasoconstriction. A transcranial Doppler sonography study, performed during the phase with headache and the other neurological deficits, suggested the presence of distal cerebral vasospasm, which normalized when all symptoms regressed completely (<24 hours). We speculated that indomethacin might represent the trigger factor of these particular phenomena, by acting either directly on distal cerebral vessels, or under certain predisposing conditions, such as migraine with aura attacks.", 
    "6": "The purpose of this study is to examine the contributions of organic anion transporting polypeptide (Oatp) and/or P-glycoprotein (P-gp) to grapefruit juice (GFJ) interaction with two statins, pravastatin and pitavastatin, which undergo negligible metabolism in rats. The two statins were found to be substrates of both Oatp1a5 and Oatp2b1, whereas pitavastatin, but not pravastatin, was a substrate of P-gp. The plasma concentration of pravastatin after oral administration was significantly decreased by GFJ and naringin, whereas that of pitavastatin was significantly increased. Naringin inhibited Oatp1a5- and Oatp2b1-mediated uptake of pravastatin and Oatp1a5-mediated, but not Oatp2b1-mediated, uptake of pitavastatin. Naringin also inhibited P-gp-mediated transport of pitavastatin. These results suggested that the decrease of pravastatin absorption in the presence of GFJ is due to the inhibitory effect of naringin on Oatp, whereas the increase of pitavastatin is due to the inhibition of P-gp. These observations are consistent with the results of in situ absorption studies. In conclusion, Oatp and/or P-gp contribute to the intestinal absorption of statins, and the differential effect of GFJ on pravastatin and pitavastatin absorption is at least partly accounted for by the different inhibitory effects of naringin on these transporters.", 
    "7": "This paper compares the pleiotropic effects of statins and omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) in treating and preventing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and deals with the possible interactions of those compounds. Statins represent one of the most important discoveries to have been made in the field of cardiovascular medicine in recent decades. Their beneficial cardiovascular effects, which have reduced the number of fatal events in patients with atherosclerosis, encompass more than their ability to lower cholesterol levels. The pleiotropic effects of statins involve their anti-inflammatory and antiplatelet properties and their ability to normalize endothelial function. In addition, these drugs may display antiarrhythmic activity, improve insulin sensitivity and counteract hypertension and obesity. The low rate of coronary disease documented in Eskimos corroborates the cardioprotective effects of the n-3 PUFA eicosapentaenoic (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acids beyond their hypolipemic effects. The reduction of CVD-related deaths attributable to the action of \u03b1-linolenic fatty acid appears to be related to its strong antiarrhythmic properties. In addition, as a precursor of EPA and this last fatty acid of thromboxane A3, prostacyclin I3, serie-3 prostaglandines and serie 5-leukotrines and inhibitor/modulator of thromboxane A2, prostacyclin I2, serie-2 prostaglandines and serie 4-leukotrienes formation, the \u03b1-linolenic acid may reduce inflammation and thrombogenesis. As results of some studies suggest that the combined use of statins and n-3 PUFA improves cardiovascular protection and reduces the CVD-related mortality rate; the paper also reviews the possible synergism between both groups of compounds on CVD treatment and concludes that clear benefits may be obtained.",

The ACCORD Lipid trial studied the additive effect of fenofibrate therapy along with low-dose simvastatin therapy in 5,518 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and found that fenofibrate did not affect any of the adverse cardiovascular outcomes, either individually or as part of a composite outcome, after 4.7 years of follow-up. An a priori subgroup analysis showed a significant benefit from fenofibrate-simvastatin combination therapy over simvastatin alone in participants with moderate hypertriglyceridemia and low HDL-cholesterol on major cardiovascular events, consistent with post-hoc analyses of previous fibrate trials. The ACCORD-Eye study adds to the sparse clinical data on the effect of fenofibrate on diabetic retinopathy, and showed that fenofibrate may be used to reduce the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy even in patients with established disease. The combination of statin and fibrate was well tolerated.",

All studies included lapaquistat 100 mg daily; 5 included 50 mg; and 1 included 25 mg. The main outcome measures were the percent change in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, secondary lipid/metabolic parameters, and overall safety. Lapaquistat 100 mg significantly decreased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 21.6% in monotherapy and by 18.0% in combination with a statin. It also reduced other cardiovascular risk markers, such as C-reactive protein. Total adverse events were higher for lapaquistat than placebo, although individual events were generally similar. At 100 mg, there was an increase in alanine aminotransferase value \u22653 times the upper limit of normal on \u22652 consecutive visits (2.0% versus 0.3% for placebo in the pooled efficacy studies; 2.7% versus 0.7% for low-dose atorvastatin in the long-term study).

We adjusted for patient characteristics, including demographics, comorbid conditions, and illness severity, and accounted for healthy user effect and indication bias using propensity analysis. We determined risk of severe sepsis and 90-day mortality. We measured markers inflammation (tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-6, interleukin-10), coagulation (antithrombin, factor IX, plasminogen activator inhibitor, d-dimer, thrombin antithrombin complex), and lymphocyte cell surface protein expression during the first week of hospitalization. There were no differences in severe sepsis risk between statin users and nonusers for prior (30.8% vs. 30.7%, p = .98) or continued statin use (30.2% vs. 30.8%, p = .85) in univariate analyses and after adjusting for patient characteristics and propensity for statin use.

The general practitioners (GPs) in Dumfries and Galloway were randomized into two groups. They received an email invitation to a web-based survey. The survey asked for treatment recommendation for three patient vignettes, each with a 10-year cardiovascular risk of 20%. In one group descriptions of the patient included type 1 diabetes, epilepsy and unemployed and in the other group these were replaced by type 2 diabetes, schizophrenia and retired. The questionnaires had no other differences. After three email invites, 53 questionnaires were completed (40% of a potential 133 participants).

This study demonstrates under-prescribing of statins. This was not worse for patients with schizophrenia as compared with patients with epilepsy. This suggests that the low rates of treatment of metabolic risk factors in patients with schizophrenia are not the result of clinician bias when compared with patients with epilepsy.

Emerging data have suggested that they also have \"pleotropic effects,\" including modulating actin cytoskeleton reorganization. Here, we report an effect of simvastatin on the trafficking of aquaporin-2 (AQP2). Specifically, simvastatin induced the membrane accumulation of AQP2 in cell cultures and kidneys in situ. The effect of simvastatin was independent of protein kinase A activation and phosphorylation at AQP2-Ser(256), a critical event involved in vasopressin (VP)-regulated AQP2 trafficking. Further investigation showed that simvastatin inhibited endocytosis in parallel with downregulation of RhoA activity. Overexpression of active RhoA attenuated simvastatin's effect, suggesting the involvement of this small GTPase in simvastatin-mediated AQP2 trafficking. Finally, the effect of simvastatin on urinary concentration was investigated in VP-deficient Brattleboro rats. Simvastatin acutely (3-6 h) increased urinary concentration and decreased urine output in these animals. In summary, simvastatin regulates AQP2 trafficking in vitro and urinary concentration in vivo via events involving downregulation of Rho GTPase activity and inhibition of endocytosis. Our study provides an alternative mechanism to regulate AQP2 trafficking, bypassing the VP-vasopressin receptor signaling pathway.", 
    "48": "Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) is one of the causative factors of diabetic nephropathy, which is associated with lipid accumulation in glomeruli. This study was designed to investigate whether N(\u03b5)-(carboxymethyl) lysine (CML; a member of the AGEs family) increases lipid accumulation by impairing the function of sterol-regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) in human mesangial cells (HMCs). Intracellular cholesterol content was assessed by Oil Red O staining and quantitative assay. The expression of molecules controlling cholesterol homeostasis was examined using real-time quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting. The activity of Golgi-processing enzymes was determined using enzyme-based methods, and the translocation of SCAP from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi was detected by confocal microscopy. CML increased cholesterol accumulation in HMCs. Exposure to CML increased expression and abnormal translocation of SCAP from the ER to the Golgi even in the presence of a high concentration of LDL. The increased SCAP translocation carried more SREBP-2 to the Golgi for activation by proteolytic cleavages, enhancing transcription of 3-hydroxy-3-methylclutaryl-CoA reductase and the LDL receptor. CML increased Golgi mannosidase activity, which may enhance glycosylation of SCAP. This prolonged the half-life and enhanced recycling of SCAP between the ER and the Golgi. The effects of CML were blocked by inhibitors of Golgi mannosidases. AGEs (CML) increased lipid synthesis and uptake, thereby causing foam cell formation via increasing transcription and protein glycosylation of SCAP in HMCs. These data imply that inhibitors of Golgi-processing enzymes might have a potential renoprotective role in prevention of mesangial foam cell formation.",

    "50": "Atherosclerosis and its thrombotic complications are the major cause of morbidity and mortality in the industrialized countries. Despite advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology, pathogenesis, and new treatment modalities, the absence of an adequate non-invasive imaging tool for early detection limits both the prevention and treatment of patients with various degrees and anatomical localizations of atherothrombotic disease. An ideal clinical imaging modality for atherosclerotic vascular disease should be safe, inexpensive, non-invasive or minimally invasive, accurate, and reproducible, and the results should correlate with the extent of atherosclerotic disease and have high predictive values for future clinical events. High-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has emerged as the most promising technique for studying atherothrombotic disease in humans in vivo. Most importantly, MRI allows for the characterization of plaque composition, i.e. the discrimination of lipid core, fibrosis, calcification, and intraplaque haemorrhage deposits. Magnetic resonance imaging also allows for the detection of arterial thrombi and in defining thrombus age. Magnetic resonance imaging has been used to monitor plaque progression and regression in several animal models of atherosclerosis and in humans. Emerging MRI techniques capable of imaging biological processes, including inflammation, neovascularization, and mechanical forces, may aid in advancing our understanding of the atherothrombotic disease. Advances in diagnosis do prosper provided they march hand-in-hand with advances in treatment. We stand at the threshold of accurate non-invasive assessment of atherosclerosis. Thus, MRI opens new strategies ranging from screening of high-risk patients for early detection and treatment as well as monitoring of the target lesions for pharmacological intervention. Identification of subclinical atherosclerosis and early treatment initiation has the potential to surpass conventional risk factor assessment and management in terms of overall impact on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Such strategy is currently under clinical investigation.", 
    "51": "Pleiotropic effects of statins have not been fully elucidated. Recently we demonstrated that cholesterol expands when crystallizing and may trigger plaque rupture. The present study evaluated the potential direct effects of statins in altering cholesterol crystallization as a possible mechanism for plaque stabilization independent of cholesterol lowering. Cholesterol powder was dissolved in oil with and without pravastatin, simvastatin, or atorvastatin (10 to 90 mg) and then allowed to crystallize to measure peak volume expansion (\u0394VE) in graduated cylinders. Effect of \u0394VE on fibrous membrane damage was also evaluated. Human coronary, carotid, and peripheral arterial plaques (65 plaques from 55 patients) were incubated with statin or saline solution using matched plaque segments to evaluate direct effects of statins on preformed crystals. Also, the effect of in vivo use of oral statins on crystal structure was examined by scanning electron microscopy and crystal content in plaques scored from 0 to +3. For all statins, \u0394VE decreased significantly in a dose-dependent fashion (0.76 \u00b1 0.1 vs 0 ml at 60 mg, p <0.001). By scanning electron microscopy crystal structure with statins had loss of pointed tip geometries, averting fibrous membrane damage. Cholesterol crystal density was markedly decreased and appeared dissolved in human plaques incubated with statins (+2.1 \u00b1 1.1 vs +1.3 \u00b1 1.0, p = 0.0001). Also, plaques from patients taking oral statins compared to controls had significantly more dissolving crystals (p = 0.03).

On stepwise multiple regression analysis, gender, high-sensitive C-reactive protein, duration of hemodialysis, serum ferritin, and statin use were independent determinants of the erythropoietin responsiveness index. Our results suggest that statin treatment leads to lower inflammation and improves hematopoiesis in hemodialysis patients.",

The percentage difference between the brand name prescription reimbursement amount to Medicaid in the last 2 months of the 6-month extension and the generic prescription reimbursement amount to Medicaid in the first 2 months following exclusivity expiration was then calculated for each drug. This was done using data from the 5 months surrounding the exclusivity expiration by regressing the log-transformed Utah Medicaid reimbursement amount on an indicator for patent expiration, controlling for number of units, volume of sales, month filled and strength. This was used to estimate what the initial generic prescription price would have been without the 6-month patent extension and what costs would have been in the 18 months following the original expiration date if the patent extension had not been granted. Medicaid rebates were assumed to be 15.1% for branded products and 11% for generics.",

Projected to the US Medicaid population, this cost was $US430 (95% CI 371, 475) million. For the individual drugs that we examined, the percentage cost decrease in reimbursement amount resulting from exclusivity expiration and generic entry ranged from 24.4% (p\u2009<\u20090.001) for enalapril to 3.8% (p\u2009=\u20090.0951) for pravastatin sodium.",

Rat VSMCs were isolated and cultured. After incubation with atorvastatin or Nur77 siRNA, the cells were stimulated with PDGF and detected for BrdU incorporation to measure the proliferation of the VSMCs. Quantitative PCR and Western blotting were used to determine the Nur77 protein and the CREB phosphorylation level, to observe their relations with PDGF-induced VSMC proliferation. Our results showed that PDGF increased the BrdU incorporation in VSMCs, suggesting that it induced the proliferation of the cells. The VSMC proliferation was associated with increased Nur77 expression and elevated CREB phosphorylation. Atorvastatin inhibited the PDGF-induced VSMC proliferation, suppressed Nur77 expression. After silencing of Nur77 gene, the PDGF-induced VSMC proliferation was decreased. It was concluded that PDGF-induced VSMC proliferation was related to the Nur77 expression and CREB phosphorylation. Atorvastatin reduced the Nur77 expression and, at the same time, inhibited the VSMC proliferation.",

    "71": "Statins, drugs commonly used to lower serum cholesterol, have been shown to stimulate osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. These effects have been attributed to the depletion of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP). In this study, we tested whether specific inhibition of GGPP synthase (GGPPS) with digeranyl bisphosphonate (DGBP) would similarly lead to increased osteoblast differentiation. DGBP concentration dependently decreased intracellular GGPP levels in MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts and primary rat calvarial osteoblasts, leading to impaired Rap1a geranylgeranylation. In contrast to our hypothesis, 1\u2009\u00b5M DGBP inhibited matrix mineralization in the MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblasts. Consistent with this, DGBP inhibited the expression of alkaline phosphatase and osteocalcin in primary osteoblasts. By inhibiting GGPPS, DGBP caused an accumulation of the GGPPS substrate farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP). This effect was observed throughout the time course of MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblast differentiation. Interestingly, DGBP treatment led to activation of the glucocorticoid receptor in MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblast cells, consistent with recent findings that FPP activates nuclear hormone receptors. These findings demonstrate that direct inhibition of GGPPS, and the resulting specific depletion of GGPP, does not stimulate osteoblast differentiation. This suggests that in addition to depletion of GGPP, statin-stimulated osteoblast differentiation may depend on the depletion of upstream isoprenoids, including FPP.", 
    "72": "Although statins are generally well-tolerated drugs, recent cases of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) associated with their use have been reported. A 59-year-old Japanese man reported with liver damage, which appeared one month after beginning treatment with fluvastatin and continued after discontinuation of the drug. Although drug-induced liver injury was possible, positive autoantibody tests (antinuclear antibodies >1/1280, anti-mitochondrial M2 antibodies 21 index value) also suggested autoimmune liver disease. Liver biopsy findings were consistent with an overlap of autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis. Treatment with prednisone and ursodeoxycholic acid led to a good response. In this patient, manifestation of AIH and primary biliary cirrhosis overlap syndrome was possibly triggered by statin use. Autoimmune liver disease should be considered as a possible diagnosis in patients with evidence of prolonged liver damage after discontinuation of statins.",

MSCs from male rats were injected into the myocardium 1 week after AMI. Cardiac function and histology, as well as the expression of Y-chromosomal genes and JAK-STAT signaling proteins, were examined at 4 weeks after transplantation. Better functional recovery, increased survival and differentiation of MSCs occurred in group M+R. Furthermore, phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3 was higher in group M+R.

Potential high risk groups for fatal outcome, such as age group younger than 10 years old and body weight group less than 50 kg were suggested. Suspected drugs for younger cases and their probable indication appear to be different from adult cases. There has been long standing controversial concern regarding an increased risk when a fibric acid derivative is added to an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor.

In this study we investigated the potential neuroprotective effect of a single i.v. treatment with four increasing doses of pravastatin on permanent occlusion of middle cerebral artery (MCAo) in spontaneously hypertensive rats. Pravastatin was given 10 min after MCAo and its effect was determined 24 h later. Treatment results were evaluated in terms of infarct volume, homolateral hemisphere oedema, glial fibrillary acid (GFAP), vimentin (Vim) and endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) immunoreactivity and TUNEL positivity. Cerebral levels of eNOS were measured by western blot analysis. Pravastatin did not reduce cerebral infarct while it mitigated homolateral hemisphere oedema in a dose-dependent manner with respect to controls. No differences among groups were found regarding GFAP and Vim immunoreactivity and TUNEL positivity. Instead, pravastatin-treated animals presented a more marked cerebral eNOS immunoreactivity as compared with controls. In agreement with immunohistochemistry, immunoblot revealed dose-dependent increases in cerebral levels of eNOS in pravastatin rats. Our data confirm statin neuroprotection in cerebral ischemia. In particular, it is of great interest that a single i.v. Pravastatin administration reduced cerebral oedema by upregulating eNOS expression/activity. This, by increasing vascular NO bioavailability, could have produced proximal vasodilation and contributed to reducing perfusional deficit. It is worthy stressing how important the anti-oedema action is that pravastatin seems to exert. Indeed, cerebral oedema, when widespread and beyond limits of physiological compensation, causes endocranic hypertension and additional cerebral damage over time.",

The biosynthesis of the lovastatin backbone (dihydromonacolin L) and the final 2-methylbutyryl decoration have been fully characterized. However, it remains unclear how two central reactions are catalyzed, namely, introduction of the 4a,5-double bond and hydroxylation at C-8. A cytochrome P450 gene, lovA, clustered with polyketide synthase lovB, has been a prime candidate for these reactions, but inability to obtain LovA recombinant enzyme has impeded detailed biochemical analyses. The synthetic codon optimization and/or N-terminal peptide replacement of lovA allowed the lovA expression in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae). Both in vivo feeding and in vitro enzyme assays showed that LovA catalyzed the conversion of dihydromonacolin L acid to monacolin L acid and monacolin J acid, two proposed pathway intermediates in the biosynthesis of lovastatin. LovA was demonstrated to catalyze the regio- and stereo-specific hydroxylation of monacolin L acid to yield monacolin J acid. These results demonstrate that LovA is the single enzyme that performs both of the two elusive oxidative reactions in the lovastatin biosynthesis.",

High residual risk is common in patients with metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, insulinoresistance and abdominal obesity. Residual risk can be decreased by combination therapy statins with fibrates or statins with niacin; niacin can affect almost all lipids and lipoproteins that participate in residual risk.

The use of CRP as a guide in primary prevention was tested for the first time in the JUPITER study, a large randomized trial comparing rosuvastatin 20 mg and placebo. Admission criteria were based on the presence of an inflammatory status only (CRP >2 mg/l), aside from CV risk factors (LDL <130 mg/dl). Rosuvastatin 20 mg, compared to placebo, significantly reduced composite primary endpoint (CV mortality, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina and myocardial revascularization). These results confirmed the continuous relationship between decreased cholesterol level and clinical benefit also in primary prevention. The high prevalence of metabolic syndrome in this study population confirmed the link between this condition and the presence of an inflammatory status, and the high incidence of events occurred in the placebo group suggests an important role of CRP in the detection of subjects at higher CV risk. The greatest reduction of CV events was seen in the subgroup of patient who achieved the \"double target\" of both decreased lipids and inflammation marker, similarly to PROVE IT-TIMI 22 in secondary prevention.

Statins, which are inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoAR), the rate-limiting enzyme in the mevalonic acid synthesis pathway, exert cytostatic and cytotoxic effects towards tumor cells. It seems that the cytostatic and cytotoxic effects of statins result from blocking protein prenylation, leading to inhibition of isoprenoid compound synthesis. Another compound which affects cholesterol metabolism is the plant alkaloid berberine. The aim of this study was to investigate potential antitumor effects of lovastatin combined with berberine. Combined with berberine, lovastatin appeared to exert potentiated cytostatic and/or cytotoxic effects against human MDA-MB231 breast cancer and murine Panc\u00a002 pancreatic cancer cells. The obtained results indicated that the effect of berberine is not dependent on blocking protein prenylation in cells, and the toxic effect of lovastatin combined with berberine is reversed by addition of the substrates of this pathway to the level brought out by lovastatin alone. Lovastatin-berberine combination caused cell cycle inhibition in G1 phase after 48\u00a0h of incubation with drugs. In a Panc 02 pancreatic cancer model in mice, lovastatin-berberine combination slightly, but significantly, slowed down tumor growth.

Whether additional benefits can be achieved with the use of statin in decreasing the risk of CIN remains undetermined. The purpose of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the effects of statin pretreatment for the prevention of CIN. PubMed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, EMBASE and EBM Reviews databases were searched for randomised controlled trials comparing statin pretreatment with non-statin pretreatment for the prevention of CIN. Two reviewers independently assessed studies and performed data extraction. Risk ratio (RR) or weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using random-effects models. Four trials with 751 subjects were included. Pooled analyses showed that the incidence of CIN was not significantly lower in statin pretreatment group, as compared with control group (RR = 0.76, 95% CI 0.44-1.29, p = 0.30). Similarly, none of 276 patients in statin pretreatment group needed renal replacement therapy (RRT), which was not significantly less than 2 of 275 patients assigned to control group during 1-month follow up (RR = 0.33, 95% CI 0.03-3.17, p = 0.34). Moreover, statin pretreatment was associated with mild reduction of serum creatinine (SCr) (WMD = -0.06 mg/dl, 95% CI -0.12 to 0.00 mg/dl, p = 0.05). The current cumulative evidence suggests that statin pretreatment may neither prevent CIN nor reduce the need for RRT. However, it may slightly decrease the level of SCr.",

The main predictor of blood clot formation, hypercoagulation, had been detected by means of our laboratory technology \"Coaguloscop-TC\" (Ukraine patent) which allows registration 36 biomarkers of coagulation cascade and the fibrinolysys system. It can calculate coagulation module (MC) and fibrinolysis module (MF). These biomarkers corresponded to new (2009) requirements of the American Heart Association. After analysis of results of 818 patients we have defined an interval line of MC and MF disorders located within degree (from I to X) of their dysfunction. Patients with hypertension (400) of II-III stage and concomitant ischemic heart disease (44.2% of cases) without antiplatelet therapies, hypercoagulation was found in 61% of patients. Very high risk factor (MC IX-X degree) took place in all patients with acute stroke. The high risk factor (MC VI-VIII degree) testified presence of urgent situation, for its correction we administered an antiplatelet agent (acelisin) intramuscularly once a day for 4-6 days in an individual dosis which was calculated based on MC level and body weight. After the treatment MC usually decreased to 2 degrees (low risk factor). The dislipidemia negatively effects efficiency of the treatment as its biomarkers have direct correlation (P < 0.001) with density of blood clot which increase inhibits the fibrinolysis system to dissolve blood clot. The use of effective complex treatment of patients with arterial hypertension ( antihypertensive, antiplatelet and hypolipidemic (statin) medications) is supposed to decrease the development of ischemic stroke by 80% that four times higher than in the 2006-2020 program assigned by Ministry of Health of Ukraine.",

Treatment with statins has been convincingly shown to both reduce blood lipid levels and mortality rates from cardiovascular disease in adult patients in CKD stages 2-4. There is no strong literature support for treating patients on dialysis or after having had a transplant. Data on benefits of statin therapy do not exist in children with CKD.

We hypothesized that uncoupled endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3) through upregulated arginase contributes to cutaneous microvascular dysfunction in hyperocholesterolaemic (HC) humans and that a statin intervention would decrease arginase activity. Five microdialysis fibres were placed in the skin of nine normocholesterolaemic (NC: LDL level 95\u00b14 mg dl\u207b\u00b9) and nine hypercholesterolaemic (HC: LDL: 177\u00b16 mg dl\u207b\u00b9) men and women before and after 3 months of systemic atrovastatin. Sites served as control, NOS inhibited, arginase inhibited, L-arginine supplemented and arginase inhibited plus L-arginine supplemented. Skin blood flow was measured while local skin heating (42\u00b0C) induced NO-dependent vasodilatation. L-NAME was infused after the established plateau in all sites to quantify NO-dependent vasodilatation. Data were normalized to maximum cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC(max)). Skin samples were obtained to measure total arginase activity and arginase I and arginase II protein. Vasodilatation was reduced in hyperocholesterolaemic subjects (HC: 76\u00b12 vs. NC: 94\u00b13%CVC(max), P < 0.001) as was NO-dependent vasodilatation (HC: 43\u00b15 vs. NC: 62\u00b14%CVC(max), P < 0.001).

Arginase activity and protein were increased in HC skin (P < 0.05 vs. NC) and activity decreased with atrovastatin treatment (P < 0.05).

Hypercholesterolemia was induced experimentally in rats by including 0.75 g% cholesterol and 1.5 g% bile salts in normal diet for 14 days. Hypercholesterolemic rats were administered fresh Triticum aestivum GJ at the dose of 5 mL/kg and 10 mL/kg and the standard drug atorvastatin 0.02% w/v in 2% gum acacia suspension at the dose of 1 mg/kg for 14 days by gavage. Blood samples were collected after 24 h of last administration and used for estimation of lipid profile. Fecal cholesterol levels were estimated using standard methods. Fresh GJ administration at 5 mL/kg and 10 mL/kg resulted in dose dependent significant decline in total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and very low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (VLDL-C) levels in hypercholesterolemic rats. Further, in comparison to atorvastatin, GJ administration at the dose of 10 mL/kg resulted in comparable decrease of TC, LDL-C, TG and VLDL-C levels (p > 0.05). Fecal cholesterol excretion was significantly (p < 0.05) enhanced by Triticum aestivum GJ administration. Phytochemical analysis revealed the presence of flavonoids, triterpenoids, anthraquinol, alkaloids, tannins, saponins and sterols in fresh wheat grass juice.

Epidemiologic and interventional studies have clearly established an inverse association between plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and incidence of atherosclerosis. The atheroprotective benefits of HDL are not only dependent on HDL concentrations (quantity), but also on HDL function (quality). Therefore, several techniques have been recently developed to assess the different properties of HDL. Because reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) is considered a key player in the beneficial action of HDL, this review focuses on the different methods used to evaluate cholesterol efflux. Measuring the in vivo function of HDL could be of significant importance for both the clinical evaluation of an individual patient and to evaluate the effectiveness of different RCT-enhancing therapeutic approaches.",

However, there exists evidence indicating their potential chemotherapeutic characteristics in cancer. In this study, we used bioinformatic analysis of publicly available data in order to systematically identify the genes involved in resistance to cytotoxic effects of these two drugs in the NCI60 cell line panel. We used the pharmacological data available for all the NCI60 cell lines to classify simvastatin or lovastatin resistant and sensitive cell lines, respectively. Next, we performed whole-genome single marker case-control association tests for the lovastatin and simvastatin resistant and sensitive cells using their publicly available Affymetrix 125K SNP genomic data. The results were then evaluated using RNAi methodology. After correction of the p-values for multiple testing using False Discovery Rate, our results identified three genes (NRP1, COL13A1, MRPS31) and six genes (EAF2, ANK2, AKAP7, STEAP2, LPIN2, PARVB) associated with resistance to simvastatin and lovastatin, respectively. Functional validation using RNAi confirmed that silencing of EAF2 expression modulated the response of HCT-116 colon cancer cells to both statins. In summary, we have successfully utilized the publicly available data on the NCI60 cell lines to perform whole-genome association studies for simvastatin and lovastatin. Our results indicated genes involved in the cellular response to these statins and siRNA studies confirmed the role of the EAF2 in response to these drugs in HCT-116 colon cancer cells.",

While the role of mTORC1 in TSC2-dependent growth has been extensively characterized, little is known about the role of mTORC2. Our data demonstrate that mTORC2 modulates TSC2-null cell proliferation and survival through RhoA GTPase and Bcl2 proteins. TSC2-null cell proliferation was inhibited not only by reexpression of TSC2 or small interfering RNA (siRNA)-induced downregulation of Rheb, mTOR, or raptor, but also by siRNA for rictor. Increased RhoA GTPase activity and P-Ser473 Akt were inhibited by siRNA for rictor. Importantly, constitutively active V14RhoA reversed growth inhibition induced by siRNA for rictor, siRNA TSC1, reexpression of TSC2, or simvastatin. While siRNA for RhoA had a modest effect on growth inhibition, downregulation of RhoA markedly increased TSC2-null cell apoptosis. Inhibition of RhoA activity downregulated antiapoptotic Bcl2 and upregulated proapoptotic Bim, Bok, and Puma. In vitro and in vivo, simvastatin alone or in combination with rapamycin inhibited cell growth and induced TSC2-null cell apoptosis, abrogated TSC2-null tumor growth, improved animal survival, and prevented tumor recurrence by inhibiting cell growth and promoting apoptosis. Our data demonstrate that mTORC2-dependent activation of RhoA is required for TSC2-null cell growth and survival and suggest that targeting both mTORC2 and mTORC1 by a combination of proapoptotic simvastatin and cytostatic rapamycin shows promise for combinational therapeutic intervention in diseases with TSC2 dysfunction.",

Also, there was a significant trend toward increasing prostate cancer risk with increasing cumulative dose (\u03c7(2) for linear trend\u2009=\u20097.23, P\u2009=\u20090.007).",

    "220": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the neuroprotective effect of the hydrophilic statin rosuvastatin on cortical neurons exposed to oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD) followed by reoxygenation. Rosuvastatin (RSV), at concentrations ranging from 10 nM to 1\u03bcM, was able to ameliorate the survival of cortical neurons exposed to OGD followed by reoxygenation. This effect was observed either if neurons were pretreated with RSV 24 hrs before OGD/reoxygenation exposure or if RSV was added during the OGD or the reoxygenation phase. Moreover, RSV was also able to improve mitochondrial oxidative capacity in basal conditions, an effect that was already observed at 10 nM either after 24 or after 48 hrs of treatment. These neuroprotective actions were not counteracted by mevalonate, an intermediate of cholesterol biosynthesis that bypasses RSV induced blockade of cholesterol synthesis. Furthermore, the hypothesis that RSV might affect neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) activity during OGD/reoxygenation was explored. RSV was able to reduce the increase of NO occurring during the reoxygenation phase, an effect prevented by NPLA, the selective inhibitor of nNOS. Finally, the possibility that RSV-induced NO reduction during OGD/reoxygenation might involve ERK1/2 activation was also investigated. The treatment of neurons with PD98059, an ERK1/2 kinase inhibitor, abolished the neuroprotective effect exerted by RSV in cortical neurons exposed to OGD/reoxygenation. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that RSV-induced neuroprotection involves an impairment of constitutive and inducible NOS activity which in turn causes the improvement of mitochondrial function and the stimulation of ERK1/2 via H-Ras activation."
