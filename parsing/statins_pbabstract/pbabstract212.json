Exposure to its metabolite 2'-hydroxy-atorvastatin remained essentially unchanged and exposure to 4'-hydroxy-atorvastatin was increased by 15%. The small changes observed are deemed of little clinical relevance given the overall inter-individual variability in the metabolism of atorvastatin. Furthermore, there were no changes in the concentrations of active HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in plasma following dabigatran etexilate coadministration. Six subjects in the atorvastatin treatment group, six subjects during combination treatment, and eight subjects in the dabigatran treatment group reported adverse events.

To evaluate the potential long-term effects of statin therapy among patients with RA, and to determine their associated cost effectiveness by incorporating both the cardiovascular and the anti-rheumatic benefits. A Markov decision-analytic model was developed to simulate cardiovascular and RA disease profiles over time. The impact of statin therapy was estimated by adjusting the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) events and changes in the RA Disease Activity Score (DAS28), based on the results of a randomized trial. The benefits (QALYs) and costs (in year 2005 values) were evaluated from a US payer perspective. A full uncertainty analysis, including a value-of-information (VOI) analysis, was undertaken to evaluate the importance of individual parameters. Using a 10-year time horizon, the additional cost and QALYs of statin therapy were estimated to be USD4690 and 0.44 QALYs, respectively, resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of USD10 650 per QALY (95% CI 1525, 156 565). The QALY gain associated with statin therapy depended more on the anti-rheumatic effects of statin therapy than on its cardiovascular prevention effect. The VOI analysis found the long-term benefit of statin therapy (i.e. >or=12 months) and the consequent impact on quality of life to be the most uncertain and, therefore, influential parameters. Our analysis indicates that the dual anti-inflammatory/cardiovascular benefits of statins could make this therapy highly cost effective in RA. However, uncertainties remain in the available data, warranting further research on refining the precise RA disease-activity benefits and health-utility changes associated with statin therapy, at least over a 12-month period.",

We have examined the effect of fluvastatin alone and in combination with zoledronic acid in the ATP-based tumour chemosensitivity assay (ATP-TCA) for effects on breast and ovarian cancer tumour-derived cells. Both zoledronic acid and fluvastatin showed activity in the ATP-TCA against breast and ovarian cancer, though fluvastatin alone was less active, particularly against breast cancer. The combination of zoledronic acid and fluvastatin was more active than either single agent in the ATP-TCA with some synergy against breast and ovarian cancer tumour-derived cells. Sequential drug experiments showed that pre-treatment of ovarian tumour cells with fluvastatin resulted in decreased sensitivity to zoledronic acid. Addition of mevalonate pathway components with zoledronic acid with or without fluvastatin showed little effect, while mevalonate did reduced inhibition due to fluvastatin. These data suggest that the combination of zoledronic acid and fluvastatin may have activity against breast and ovarian cancer based on direct anti-cancer cell effects.

    "27": "High-density lipoprotein (HDL) plays an important protective role against atherosclerosis, and the anti-atherogenic properties of HDL include the promotion of cellular cholesterol efflux and reverse cholesterol transport (RCT), as well as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anticoagulant effects. RCT is a complex pathway, which transports cholesterol from peripheral cells and tissues to the liver for its metabolism and biliary excretion. The major steps in the RCT pathway include the efflux of free cholesterol mediated by cholesterol transporters from cells to the main extracellular acceptor HDL, the conversion of free cholesterol to cholesteryl esters and the subsequent removal of cholesteryl ester in HDL by the liver. The efficiency of RCT is influenced by the mobilization of cellular lipids for efflux and the intravascular remodelling and kinetics of HDL metabolism. Despite the increased cardiovascular risk in people with type 2 diabetes, current knowledge on RCT in diabetes is limited. In this article, abnormalities in RCT in type 2 diabetes mellitus and therapeutic strategies targeting HDL and RCT will be reviewed.",

Rutin has several pharmacological properties including antioxidant and cardioprotective activities. Also, it was identified that rutin is the major low-density lipoprotein (LDL) antioxidant compound of mulberry in an in vitro study. The effects of rutin were tested by using it as a supplement in a high-cholesterol diet. Male rats were fed a high-cholesterol diet (1 ml/100 g) for 4 weeks with rutin (10 or 100 mg/kg) or rutin 100 mg/kg and lovastatin supplementation to study the hypocholesterolaemic effects of rutin on plasma lipid levels, hepatic enzyme activity, and liver tissue. Feeding the animals a high-cholesterol diet resulted in marked hypercholesterolaemia and increased the serum level of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C). Rutin (at 100 mg/kg) alone or in combination with lovastatin significantly reduced the levels of total cholesterol, and LDL-C and also markedly decreased liver enzymes and weight in animals with a high-cholesterol diet. Our findings show that 100 mg/kg of rutin alone or with lovastatin supplementation lowered liver weight and enzymes as well as plasma total cholesterol and LDL. The hepatic histopathological results reflect the correlation of rutin and lovastatin combination with both liver weight and the levels of plasma total cholesterol and LDL-C. These results indicate that rutin in combination with lovastatin has increased anti-hypercholesterolaemic effects in an animal model.",

PDMP and adiponectin were measured by ELISA at baseline and after 3 and 6 months of drug treatment. Thirty normolipidemic patients were recruited as healthy controls. PDMP levels prior to treatment in hyperlipidemic patients with diabetes were higher than levels in healthy controls (10.4 +/- 1.9 vs. 3.1 +/- 0.4 U/ml, p < 0.0001), and adiponectin levels were lower than controls (3.20 +/- 0.49 vs. 5.98 +/- 0.42 microg/ml, p < 0.0001).

In contrast, group A exhibited a significant increase in adiponectin levels after treatment (before vs. 6M, 3.29 +/- 0.51 vs. 4.16 +/- 0.60 microg/ml, p < 0.001). Furthermore, group C exhibited significant improvement in both PDMP and adiponectin levels after treatment (PDMP, before vs. 6M, 11.2 +/- 2.0 vs. 4.5 +/- 2.7 U/ml, p < 0.001; adiponectin, before vs. 6M, 3.24 +/- 0.41 vs. 4.02 +/- 0.70 microg/ml, p < 0.001). Reductions of PDMP in combined therapy were significantly greater than those observed with EPA alone (p < 0.05 by ANOVA). In addition, soluble CD40 ligand exhibited almost the same change as PDMP in all therapy groups. These results suggest that pitavastatin possesses an adiponectin-dependent antiatherosclerotic effect, and this drug is able to enhance the anti-platelet effect of EPA.

In diabetic rats, atorvastatin ameliorated the erectile response to the ES of the cavernous nerve and normalized sildenafil effect on erectile function, strongly decreased by diabetes. In penile tissue from diabetic animals, atorvastatin completely restored the diabetes-induced hypersensitivity to Y-27632 and prevented RhoA membrane translocation/activation. In hfPSMCs, high glucose significantly increased not only membrane RhoA expression, but also ROCK activity (increased phosphorylation of the ROCK substrate myosin phosphatase target subunit 1) and several RhoA-dependent functions such as proliferation, migration, and smooth muscle-related gene expression. Atorvastatin restored all the high-glucose-induced effects, an action specifically reverted by GGPP.",

Tight control of blood pressure and glycaemia are mandatory components of primary prevention strategies, but are insufficient to eliminate risk in all patients. A body of evidence supports a role for lipid-modifying therapy in reducing the diabetic retinopathy endpoints. Although inconclusive for statin therapy, results from the Fenofibrate Intervention and Event Lowering in Diabetes (FIELD) study show beneficial effects of fenofibrate in reducing the requirement for laser therapy, and particularly in preventing disease progression in patients with pre-existing diabetic retinopathy. However, there is a need for confirmation of these findings in large prospective studies with progression of retinopathy as the primary endpoint, such as the ACCORD-EYE (Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes-EYE) study, and in a clinical trial specifically conducted for diabetic maculopathy. In addition, elucidation of the mechanism(s) of effect of fenofibrate is indicated.", 
    "71": "The risk of cardiovascular disease increases with declining glomerular filtration rate. Hyperlipidemia and dyslipidemia, characterized by increased triglycerides and low levels of high-density lipoprotein, are both associated with cardiovascular outcome as well as the risk of progression of loss of renal function. Both hyperlipidemia and dyslipidemia respond to pharmacologic therapy, including hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors and fibric acid derivatives, to alteration in diet as well as to extreme measures such as bariatric surgery. However, the effects of these modalities on cardiovascular or renal outcomes are dependent upon the level of renal function. There is strong evidence that patients with stages 1-3 chronic kidney disease attain benefit from lipid-lowering therapy both with reduction in cardiovascular risk and possibly reduction in the rate of decline in renal function. Among dialysis patients little risk reduction appears to be achieved by treatment of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level. Bariatric surgery reduces hyperlipidemia in patients with chronic kidney disease, but has also been associated with subsequent rapid decline in renal function secondary to oxalate deposition.",

Ranked according to the Wald chi(2) value, age (56), ejection fraction (44), and body mass index (42) were most predictive of all-cause mortality in Step 1 (total model chi(2) 343). Creatinine was the most powerful predictor at Step 2 (48) and ApoA-1 ranked fifth (25), with the overall chi(2) increasing to 440. Log NT-proBNP (167) was the most powerful of the 14 independently predictive variables identified at Step 3 and the overall chi(2) increased to 600.

Rosuvastatin is the most powerful statin to reduce LDL-cholesterol, but its effects on HDL metabolism in type 2 diabetes remain unknown. We performed a randomized double-blind cross-over trial of 6-week treatment period with placebo or rosuvastatin 20 mg in eight patients with type 2 diabetes. An in vivo kinetic study of HDL-apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) with (13)C leucine was performed at the end of each treatment period. Moreover, a similar kinetic study was carried out in eight nondiabetic normolipidemic controls. Rosuvastatin significantly reduced plasma LDL-cholesterol (-51%), triglycerides (TGs) (-38%), and HDL-TG (-23%). HDL-apoA-I fractional catabolic rate (FCR) was decreased by rosuvastatin (0.25 +/- 0.06 vs. 0.32 +/- 0.07 pool/day, P = 0.011), leading to an increase in plasma HDL-apoA-I residence time (4.21 +/- 1.02 vs. 3.30 +/- 0.73 day, P = 0.011). Treatment with rosuvastatin was associated with a concomitant reduction of HDL-apoA-I production rate. The decrease in HDL-apoA-I FCR, induced by rosuvastatin, was correlated with the reduction of plasma TGs and HDL-TG. HDL apoA-I FCR and production rate values in diabetic patients on rosuvastatin were not different from those found in controls. Rosuvastatin is responsible for a 22% reduction of HDL-apoA-I FCR and restores to normal the increased HDL turnover observed in type 2 diabetes. These kinetic modifications may have beneficial effects by increasing HDL plasma residence time.",

After adjusting for baseline differences and the use of statins, the hazard ratio was 0.39 (95% confidence interval 0.27-0.58).

Calcium determination of the implanted pericardial tissue was also performed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) assessment. ICP-MS analysis showed that pericardial fragments in SG had significantly (p<0.01) less calcium content than CG (625+/-142 vs. 962+/-590 microg/g, respectively).

This study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of simvastatin on the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) related signaling pathway and secondary brain injury in rats after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Adult male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: (1) Sham group (n=25); (2) Sham+vehicle group (n=25); (3) TBI+vehicle group (n=30); and (4) TBI+simvastatin group (n=30). Right parietal cortical contusion was made by using a weight-dropping method. In TBI+simvastatin group, simvastatin was administered orally at a dose of 37.5 mg/kg at 1 and 6 h after TBI. Brain samples were extracted at 24 h after trauma. As a result, we found that treatment with simvastatin markedly inhibited the mRNA and protein expressions of TLR4, NF-kappaB and the downstream inflammatory agents, such as interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Administration of simvastatin following TBI significantly ameliorated the secondary brain damage, such as cortical apoptosis, brain edema, blood-brain barrier (BBB) impairment, and motor deficits. In conclusion, post-TBI simvastatin administration may attenuate TLR4/NF-kappaB-mediated inflammatory response in the injured rat brain, and this may be one mechanism by which simvastatin improves outcome following TBI.",

Rosuvastatin once a week was tolerated by 37 (74%) of the 50 study participants, with doses ranging from 2.5 mg to 20 mg a week (mean 10 +/- 4 mg). Patients tolerating the once-a-week regimen experienced a 17% reduction in total cholesterol, 23% reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 12% reduction in triglycerides, and a 5% increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (all p <0.001), during a mean follow-up of 4 months +/- 2. Although this alternative dosing regimen has not been proven to reduce cardiovascular events, it may provide a therapeutic option for patients who may otherwise go without the proven benefits of statin therapy.

Mean percentage changes from baseline in CRP and LDL cholesterol were examined using analysis of variance in patients with CRP < or =10 mg/L. Effects within subgroups (age, gender, race, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, metabolic syndrome, CAD, baseline CRP or lipids, and statin potency) and correlations between CRP and LDL cholesterol were also examined. Reduction in CRP by ezetimibe monotherapy was numerically greater than with placebo (treatment difference 6%, p = 0.09). Added to statin therapy, ezetimibe was associated with a significant additional reduction in CRP (treatment difference 10%, p <0.001). Treatment effects were generally consistent across subgroups for the 2 analyses. With monotherapy and add-on to statin therapy, LDL cholesterol reduction with ezetimibe was significantly greater than with placebo (treatment differences -19% and -23%, respectively, p <0.001). Spearman's correlation coefficients among baseline values and percentage changes from baseline in CRP and LDL cholesterol ranged from -0.007% to 0.13%. In conclusion, the addition of ezetimibe to statin treatment provides significantly enhanced CRP reductions over and above those achieved with statin monotherapy. Correlations between changes in CRP and changes in LDL cholesterol were weakly positive and significant only when ezetimibe was added to statin treatment. The effects of ezetimibe monotherapy are not well defined. The effects of ezetimibe on CRP were consistent across patient subgroups.",

    "118": "Calcific aortic stenosis is a frequent degenerative disease, which represents the most common indication for adult heart valve surgery, and carries substantial morbidity and mortality. Due to ageing populations in western countries, its prevalence is expected to increase in the coming years. Basic science studies suggest that the progression of aortic valve stenosis involves an active biological process, and that the molecular mechanisms promoting this development resemble those of atherosclerosis, as stenotic aortic valves are characterized by complex histological lesions, consisting of activated inflammatory cells, lipid deposits, extracellular matrix remodeling, calcific nodules, and bone tissue. This has led to the hypothesis that drugs effective in delaying atherosclerosis progression (e.g. statins) might also be able to prevent the progression of calcific aortic valve stenosis. The potential benefit of statin therapy, however, is controversial and widely debated, as recent randomized studies done in patients with moderate to severe degrees of aortic stenosis failed to consistently show substantial benefits of this class of drugs. This review focuses on various aspects of molecular mechanisms underlying calcific aortic valve stenosis and discusses recent experimental and clinical studies that address the potential benefit of targeted drug therapies. Taken together, current evidence suggests that the progression of calcific aortic stenosis is a multi-factorial process; the multitude of the mechanisms potentially involved in aortic valve stenosis indicates that drug therapy aimed at reducing its progression is necessarily multi-factorial and should address the earliest stages of the disease, as it is now evident that pharmacological treatment administered in more advanced stages of the disease may be ineffective or, at best, much less effective.",

Here we review the statin AE literature, first focusing on muscle AEs as the most reported problem both in the literature and by patients. Evidence regarding the statin muscle AE mechanism, dose effect, drug interactions, and genetic predisposition is examined. We hypothesize, and provide evidence, that the demonstrated mitochondrial mechanisms for muscle AEs have implications to other nonmuscle AEs in patients treated with statins. In meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), muscle AEs are more frequent with statins than with placebo. A number of manifestations of muscle AEs have been reported, with rhabdomyolysis the most feared. AEs are dose dependent, and risk is amplified by drug interactions that functionally increase statin potency, often through inhibition of the cytochrome P450 3A4 system. An array of additional risk factors for statin AEs are those that amplify (or reflect) mitochondrial or metabolic vulnerability, such as metabolic syndrome factors, thyroid disease, and genetic mutations linked to mitochondrial dysfunction. Converging evidence supports a mitochondrial foundation for muscle AEs associated with statins, and both theoretical and empirical considerations suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction may also underlie many nonmuscle statin AEs. Evidence from RCTs and studies of other designs indicates existence of additional statin-associated AEs, such as cognitive loss, neuropathy, pancreatic and hepatic dysfunction, and sexual dysfunction. Physician awareness of statin AEs is reportedly low even for the AEs most widely reported by patients. Awareness and vigilance for AEs should be maintained to enable informed treatment decisions, treatment modification if appropriate, improved quality of patient care, and reduced patient morbidity.",

In this article, we review the lipid- and non-lipid-based mechanisms of statin-induced disease regression using the information provided by the recent intravascular ultrasonography trials. We conclude that, despite several potential mechanisms, reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol appears to be the dominant mechanism responsible for regression of atherosclerosis.",

Lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels with statins remains the primary goal of therapy. For secondary prevention patients, those with coronary heart disease (CHD) or CHD risk equivalents, intensive LDL-C lowering is recommended, although the precise target value is still debated. For primary prevention, reduction in LDL-C levels is based on patient risk for CHD. In clinical outcome trials to date, statins benefit those who are at moderate to high risk and appear to have less clinical benefit for those at low risk. Yet despite aggressive LDL-C management with statins, there remains a residual risk for CHD events in high-risk patients. Secondary targets have been proposed to decrease this risk, including non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and apolipoprotein B, as well as other emerging targets, including LDL particle number and lipoprotein(a). In many high-risk patients, statin monotherapy is unlikely to achieve goals, and combination therapy with other agents is a safe, effective, and optimal therapeutic approach.",

Circulating endothelial progenitor cells, brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilatation, an index of endothelial function, and the lipid profile were measured before and after the 4-week statin therapy. At baseline, we found a correlation between circulating endothelial progenitor cells and flow-mediated vasodilatation (r = .31, P = .029). At the end of the 4-week intervention with rosuvastatin there was a 37% reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P < .001) and a significant 72% increase in the number of endothelial progenitor cells and flow-mediated vasodilatation (4.7 + 0.7% to 8.8 + 0.4%, P < .001). Endothelial progenitor cells and flow-mediated vasodilatation were unchanged at the end of the study in patients not taking statin. A correlation emerged between endothelial progenitor cells and flow-mediated vasodilatation variations (r = .52, P < .001), this correlation being still significant after controlling for blood cholesterol reduction. In conclusion, short-term rosuvastatin therapy contributes in hyperchoelsterolemic patients to improving endothelial function by lowering cholesterol and increasing the number of circulating endothelial progenitor cells; the latter effect appears to be partly independent from reduction in plasma cholesterol.", 
    "155": "Widespread vascular calcification is a ubiquitous feature of aging and is prevalent in association with a number of common pathologies including atherosclerosis, renal failure, and diabetes. Once thought of as innocuous, emerging evidence suggests that calcification is causal in precipitating vascular events and mediating chronic cardiovascular damage, independent of disease context. Importantly, a large body of data has shed light on the factors that favor the formation of calcification in vivo, as well as on the complex mechanisms that initiate and promote it. This has identified some novel targets and allowed for the possibility that calcification can potentially be blocked and ultimately regressed. Targets include local and circulating inhibitors of calcification as well as factors that may ameliorate vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) apoptosis. Despite this, the vasculature remains a difficult tissue to target and currently there are no effective treatments in general use. More crucially, any potential treatments will need to be carefully evaluated as they may impinge on bone metabolism. Our best hope for the near future is to normalize factors associated with accelerated calcification in pathologies such as renal failure where, aberrant mineral metabolism, as well as treatment regimes, may contribute to the initiation and progression of calcification.",

After adjustment for all univariate predictors of the occurrence of study primary end-points, statin therapy was shown to be associated with significant and independent reduction in all-cause mortality (HR = 0.24 [95%CI:0.07 - 0.90] P < 0.05) and cardiovascular rehospitalization rate (HR = 0.55 [95%CI: 0.33 - 0.92] P< 0.05). After propensity matching statin therapy remained an independent factor reducing one-year mortality rate (HR = 0. 11 [95%CI: 0.01 - 0.99] P < 0.05].", 
    "167": "This study showed that statin therapy may have beneficial effects on mortality and rehospitalization rates among patients with HF and PLVEF. It also suggests a potential role for statins as a new therapeutic option in patients with HF and PLVEF, but these observations need to be confirmed in large randomized trials.", 
    "168": "The objectives of the study were to determine whether identifying patients with metabolic syndrome (MetS) (as defined by International Diabetes Federation [IDF] criteria) among patients with diabetes would affect the decision to prescribe statin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD), based on currently available public health guidelines. We analysed the most recent recorded CVD risk profiles obtained from electronic patient files from 304 general practices in England and Wales. Of 60,258 patients with diabetes, 11,005 men and women aged 30-74 years fulfilled criteria for primary CVD prevention and were not on lipid-lowering drugs. Outcome data were extrapolated to an estimated national diabetes prevalence of 3.6%. Identifying MetS in this group of patients would produce an additional 29,536 (8.4%; 95% CI: 7.7, 9.0), 104,288 (29.6%; 95% CI: 28.5, 30.7) and 147, 328 (41.9%; 95% CI: 40.8, 43.0) patients nationally who would not have been eligible otherwise for primary CVD prevention strategies with statins, based on the Joint British Societies', the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence and the General Medical Services contract guidelines, respectively. The sensitivity and positive predictive value of these different strategies to detect metabolic syndrome were 87.5% and 69.1%; 57.3% and 76.8%; and 37.8% and 70.2%, respectively. In conclusion, among individuals with diabetes, identifying patients with MetS may further increase the use of statin therapy for primary CVD prevention.",

We investigated which of the generally used methods to test postprandial lipaemia differentiated best between patients with premature CAD (50+/-4 years, n=20) and healthy controls. Furthermore, the effects of rosuvastatin 40 mg/day on postprandial parameters were assessed. Standardised oral fat-loading tests (OFLT) and ambulant self-measurements of daylong capillary triglycerides (TGc) were performed. Total responses of individual lipoproteins, plasma TG (TGp) and remnant-like particle cholesterol (RLP-C) were estimated as area under the curve (AUC). Most AUCs were highest in untreated patients and reached control levels after rosuvastatin. From all AUCs, RLP-C-AUC was best associated to TGp-AUC in untreated patients and controls (adjusted R2=0.84, beta=0.92, p.", 
    "171": "Patients with high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) and asymptomatic high creatine kinase (CK) (>or=250 but <2500 IU/L, 10x the laboratory upper normal limit [UNL]) are often not started on statins or have statins stopped because of concern about myositis-rhabdomyolysis. In the current report, we prospectively examined the hypothesis that asymptomatic patients with high CK (>or=250 but <2500 IU/L) tolerate statins well at doses reducing LDLC to target, less than 100 mg/dL, without development of myalgia-myositis. We assessed outcomes of 3 groups of patients referred to us because of asymptomatic high CK (>or=250 but <2500 IU/L)--1 group (n = 29) on statins at referral and continued on statins, 1 group (n = 20) not on statins and started on statins, and 1 group (n = 19) not on statins and not given statins--all restudied 1 month after entry and then every 3 months. Of the 68 patients, 59 (87%) had CK greater than 1 to 3 times the UNL, 7 (10%) had CK greater than 3 to 5 times the UNL, and 2 (3%) had CK greater than 5 to 10 times the UNL. After 1.2 months of follow-up in 29 statin-->statin patients, median CK fell from 353 to 301 (P = .0018) and was 287 (P = .015) after 4 months. After 1.3 months of follow-up in 20 no statin-->statin patients, median CK fell from 397 to 292 (P = .0094) and was 419 after 4.1 months. After 1.1 months of follow-up in 19 no statin-->no statin patients, median CK fell from 392 to 323 (P = .14) and was 271 (P = .029) after 4.2 months. By repeated-measures analysis, there were no differences in entry CK among the 3 treatment groups; CK fell (P = .04) in the no statin-->no statin patients. Despite high baseline CK (48 patients with CK 1-5x the UNL, 1 with CK 5-10x UNL), no patients during follow-up on statins developed CK greater than 10 times the UNL (2500 IU/L), none discontinued statins or reduced statin dose because of myalgia-myositis, and there was no rhabdomyolysis. High pretreatment CK, particularly 1 to 5 times the UNL, should not be an impediment to start or continue statins to lower LDLC.",

    "173": "C57BL/6 mice were treated with simvastatin (0.02 and 0.2 mg.kg(-1)) and vehicle before and after undergoing bile duct ligation (BDL) for 12 h. Leukocyte recruitment and microvascular perfusion in the liver were analysed using intravital fluorescence microscopy. CXC chemokines in the liver were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Liver damage was monitored by measuring serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). Hepatic levels of myeloperoxidase (MPO) were also determined.", 
    "174": "Administration of 0.2 mg.kg(-1) simvastatin decreased ALT and AST by 87% and 83%, respectively, in BDL mice. This dose of simvastatin reduced hepatic formation of CXC chemokines by 37-82% and restored sinusoidal perfusion in cholestatic animals. Moreover, BDL-induced leukocyte adhesion in sinusoids and postsinusoidal venules, as well as MPO levels in the liver, was significantly reduced by simvastatin. Notably, administration of 0.2 mg.kg(-1) simvastatin 2 h after BDL induction also decreased cholestatic liver injury and inflammation.", 
    "175": "These findings show that simvastatin protects against BDL-induced liver injury. The hepatoprotective effect of simvastatin is mediated, at least in part, by reduced formation of CXC chemokines and leukocyte recruitment. Thus, our novel data suggest that the use of statins may be an effective strategy to protect against the hepatic injury associated with obstructive jaundice.", 
    "176": "This commentary discusses the findings of Agalliu and colleagues, who performed a population-based, case-control study on the association between statin drugs and prostate cancer risk. Consistent with recent studies, statins were not associated with overall prostate cancer risk, but users had a possible lower risk of advanced disease. Obese men taking a statin had a higher risk of prostate cancer than those not taking a statin; however, a previously conducted, large, prospective, cohort study did not observe this association. This unexpected finding by Agalliu et al. could be a chance result, or could have arisen because of complex bias. Although statins might favorably affect men's prostate health, evidence is too limited to recommend statin use for the prevention of advanced prostate cancer. Consideration of the harms and benefits when prescribing a statin for vascular indications, including in obese men, should not presently include prostate cancer risk.",

    "178": "this study were conducted at Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo General Hospital (RSUPN-CM), Persahabatan Hospital, MMC Hospital and Medistra Hospital, Jakarta. The study started from 1 May 2005 to 5 May 2006. Study Design was an interventional study which was a randomized double blind controlled trial to evaluate the effects of curcumin administration at escalating doses (low dose 3 times 15 mg/day, moderate dose 3 times 30 mg/day, and high dose 3 times 60 mg/day) on total cholesterol level, LDL cholesterol level, HDL cholesterol level, and triglyceride level in ACS patients.", 
    "179": "a 75 ACS patients undergoing randomization participated in randomized controlled trial (RCT). Of the 75 ACS patients participating in that RCT, 67 received care at RSCM, 6 at Persahabatan Hospital, and 2 at MMC Hospital. As many as 63 patients were able to participate in the RCT up to its conclusion. There was no significant difference in age, sex, risk factor of dyslipidemia, DM, smoking, hypertension, CHD history in family, height, body weight and body mass index, waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure in the four groups of patients. This showed that the randomization performed was reasonably good. There was no significant difference in laboratory parameters, such as total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride, fasting blood glucose, blood glucose 2 hours PP, glyco Hb, triglyceride, Hb, Ht, leukocyte, thrombocyte, ureum, creatinine, SGOT, SGPT, in the four groups. There was no significant difference in types of ACS and locations of ACS in the four groups as well. There was no significant difference in statin medicatios (simvastatin), aspirin ACE inhibitor, and DM medications in the four groups. No patient used tiazolidindion. No significant difference was found in the percentage of compliance in the four groups of patients. The effects of curcumin on total cholesterol level and LDL cholesterol level, there was a trend that the lower the dose of curcumin, the higher the effect of reduction. For HDL cholesterol level, there was also a trend that the lower the dose of curcumin, the higher the effect of increase in HDL cholesterol level. However, for triglyceride the pattern was not the same, and the group of moderate-dose curcumin shoed the minimal effect of increase, followed by the low-dose curcumin and finally the high-dose curcumin that showed the highest effect of increase.",

    "181": "A case report of a ciprofloxacin and simvastatin interaction is presented. The addition of ciprofloxacin to chronic simvastatin therapy led to the development of rhabdomyolysis. As ciprofloxacin is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4, it is very likely that other mechanisms involving the ATP-binding cassette drug efflux transporter family played a role in this drug interaction.", 
    "182": "This study aimed to determine the effect of lovastatin on Rho G-protein expression and activation in human trabecular meshwork (TM) cells.", 
    "183": "Confluent cultures of low-passage (primary) or transformed (GTM3) human TM cells were incubated overnight with vehicle (0.01% ethanol) or activated lovastatin (10 microM). Changes in Rho mRNA, protein content, and activation were quantified by qRT-PCR, immunoblotting, and ELISA, respectively. F-actin organization was determined using Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated phalloidin.", 
    "184": "Low-passage or transformed TM cells treated with lovastatin exhibited marked increases in RhoA and RhoB mRNA and protein content. Actinomycin D prevented lovastatin-dependent increases in RhoB, but not RhoA, protein accumulation. In contrast, cycloheximide prevented lovastatin from increasing both RhoA and RhoB. Supplementation with mevalonate or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate prevented, whereas inhibition of geranylgeranyl transferase mimicked, the effects of lovastatin on RhoA and RhoB accumulation. The effect of lovastatin was dose dependent, with newly synthesized protein accumulating in the cytosol. The amount of functionally active (GTP-bound) RhoA in cell lysates was significantly reduced by lovastatin. Lovastatin altered the morphology of TM cells by disrupting F-actin organization.", 
    "185": "Lovastatin enhances the accumulation of RhoA and RhoB in human TM cells, in part, by limiting geranylgeranyl isoprenylation of these G-proteins. We propose that post-translational geranylgeranylation serves as a regulator of both RhoA and RhoB protein expression and processing in human TM cells. Increased accumulation of unprenylated forms of RhoA and RhoB may disrupt Rho-dependent regulation of TM cell cytoskeletal organization.", 
    "186": "We have recently shown that CRP induces chemokine secretion and adhesion molecule up-regulation in human primary monocytes cultured in adherence. Given the increasing evidence on direct immunomodulatory properties of statins, we investigated their possible anti-inflammatory role on CRP-treated human monocytes.", 
    "187": "Monocytes were isolated by Ficoll-Percoll gradients and cultured in adherence to polystyrene. Chemokine secretion and adhesion molecule expression were detected by ELISA and flow cytometry. Migration assays were performed in modified Boyden chambers. Intracellular kinase activation was assessed by western blot.", 
    "188": "Treatment with simvastatin or atorvastatin decreased CRP-induced release of CCL2, CCL3 and CCL4. In addition, both statins reduced CRP-induced intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1) up-regulation, but had no effects on CD11b and CD18. Treatments with 1 microM simvastatin or atorvastatin significantly inhibited monocyte migration in response to CRP. CD32 and CD64 (CRP receptors) expression on monocytes was not affected by statins. Statin-induced inhibition of CRP-mediated chemokine secretion, ICAM-1 up-regulation and migration occurred through the inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2. Treatment with L-mevalonate or farnesylpyrophosphate, but not geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate reversed the statin-induced effect on CRP-mediated functions and ERK 1/2 phosphorylation, confirming that statins blocked CRP-induced ERK 1/2 phosphorylation through the inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase.", 
    "189": "Statins inhibited CRP-induced chemokine secretion, ICAM-1 up-regulation and migration in human adherent monocytes, through the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase-ERK 1/2 pathway. This pathway could represent a very promising target to reduce CRP-induced activities in monocyte-mediated diseases, such as atherosclerosis or RA.", 
    "190": "Statins and fibrates are hypolipidemic drugs which decrease cardiac events in individuals without raised levels of cholesterol. These drugs inhibit platelet function, but the mechanisms by which this pleiotropic effect is exerted are not known.", 
    "191": "We used a range of approaches to show statins inhibit human platelet activation in vitro while engaging PPARalpha and PPARgamma. The effects of simvastatin were prevented by the PPARgamma antagonist GW9662 or the PPARalpha antagonist GW6471. In a small-scale human study fluvastatin activated PPARalpha and PPARgamma in platelets and reduced aggregation in response to arachidonic acid ex vivo. The effects of fenofibrate were prevented by PPARalpha antagonism with GW6471. Fenofibrate increased bleeding time in wild-type, but not in PPARalpha-/- mice. The inhibitory effect of fenofibrate, but not simvastatin, on aggregation was prevented by deletion of PPARalpha in murine platelets. PKCalpha, which influences platelet activation, associated and immune-precipitated with PPARgamma in platelets stimulated with statins and with PPARalpha in platelets stimulated with fenofibrate.", 
    "192": "This study is the first to provide a unifying explanation of how fibrates and statins reduce thrombotic and cardiovascular risk. Our findings that PPARs associate with PKCalpha in platelets also provide a mechanism by which these effects are mediated.", 
    "193": "Besides a cholesterol-lowering effect, simvastatin possesses anti-inflammatory properties attributed to inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase and/or direct binding to, and inhibition of, the integrin lymphocyte function associated antigen-1 (LFA-1). We have shown that simvastatin protects against multiple low dose streptozotocin (MLDS) induced type 1 diabetes in mice. Presently, we examined if this effect could be abolished by co-administration of mevalonic acid, thus determining if the protective effect is dependent or independent of inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase. Mevalonic acid did not affect the protective effect of simvastatin against MLDS diabetes. Moreover, spleens from these mice did not show any signs of toxic side-effects, thus excluding the possibility that the protective effect is secondary to a general inflammatory response. We suggest that simvastatin's protective effect mainly is independent of HMG-CoA reductase inhibition. This implies that inhibition of LFA-1 activation is important for the protective effect exerted by simvastatin.", 
    "194": "Multiple organ dysfunction resulting from hemorrhagic shock (HS) and subsequent resuscitation was mediated by several inflammatory factors such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-10 (IL-10).

    "195": "The experimental rats were randomly divided into three groups. The vehicle group received only vitamin K without HS, the HS-control group received vitamin K and HS, and the HS-experimental group received both vitamin K and fluvastatin (1mg/kg) before HS. HS was produced by bleeding from a femoral arterial catheter to remove 60% of total blood volume (6ml/100g BW) over 30min. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) were monitored continuously for 12h after the start of blood withdrawal. The biochemical parameters, including arterial blood gas, glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cre), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine phosphokinase (CPK), and lactate were obtained at 30min before induction of HS and at 0, 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12h after HS. Equal volume of normal saline was given to replace blood volume loss. Cytokine levels including TNF-alpha and IL-10 in serum were measured at 1h after HS. Kidney, liver, lung and small intestine were removed for pathology examination at 48h after HS.", 
    "196": "HS significantly increased HR, blood GOT, GPT, BUN, Cre, LDH, CPK, lactate, TNF-alpha and IL-10 levels, and also induced metabolic acidosis and decreased MAP in rats. Pre-treatment with fluvastatin was found to improve survival rate, preserved MAP, decreased the markers of organ injury, suppressed the release of TNF-alpha and increased IL-10 after HS in rats.",

    "198": "Effects independent from cholesterol reduction on vascular function are considered to importantly contribute to the beneficial effects of statin therapy in cardiovascular disease. We aimed to evaluate the effect of high versus low dose atorvastatin on endothelial dysfunction in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) in a setting of comparable cholesterol reduction.", 
    "199": "Fifty-eight patients with CAD were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment for 8 weeks with atorvastatin 80 mg per day (A80) or atorvastatin 10mg+ezetimibe 10mg per day (A10E10), respectively. Flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD) of the brachial artery, nitroglycerin-mediated endothelium-independent vasodilation (NMD), lipid, C-reactive protein (CRP) plasma concentrations and urinary 8-iso-prostaglandin F2alpha excretion were measured before and after treatment. Total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL-cholesterol levels were significantly reduced with no difference between A80 and A10E10. A80 caused significantly stronger improvement of FMD compared to A10E10 (absolute change FMD: A80+2.7+/-3.0% (post vs. pre p<0.001), A10E10+0.6+/-2.9% (post vs. pre p=0.25), A80 vs. A10E10 p=0.018). NMD was improved by A80 but not by A10E10 (absolute change NMD: A80+2.7+/-4.6%, A10E10+0.7+/-3.5%, p=0.12). Both treatment groups caused a comparable reduction of CRP and did not effect urinary 8-iso-prostaglandin F2alpha excretion. There was no correlation between FMD or NMD change and LDL-cholesterol change in either treatment group.", 
    "200": "The present findings clearly suggest that in the presence of comparable LDL-lowering effects of both treatment forms, LDL-cholesterol independent effects of high dose atorvastatin therapy account for the improvement of endothelium-dependent vasodilation in patients with stable CAD.", 
    "201": "The aim was to assess the cost-effectiveness of a genetic screening program for first-degree relatives of patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), followed by treatment when necessary, compared with the alternative of no screening.", 
    "202": "The cost-effectiveness analysis modeled the effect of statin treatment on individuals who were diagnosed with FH after genetic screening. The impact of uncertainty was evaluated using univariate probabilistic sensitivity analysis. The alternate strategy considered was no screening. In the cost-effectiveness analysis, the number of life-years gained (LYG) was regarded as the health outcome and the costs of screening, statin treatment, specialist consultations and hospital visits were all included. In addition, the expected value of perfect information was calculated as part of the sensitivity analysis.", 
    "203": "In the base case, the incremental cost of the screening program for close relatives was 3423 euros per LYG. Although the sensitivity analysis gave a range of results, the conclusions were not affected by changes in the parameters considered. The screening program was found to be better than the alternative considered at a probability level of 95% if the acceptable level of health-care costs was at least 7400 euros per LYG.", 
    "204": "This analysis indicates that a genetic screening program, supplemented by treatment, for the close relatives of individuals with FH is preferable to the alternative of no screening in terms of incremental cost-effectiveness.", 
    "205": "Arterial stiffness is a powerful predictor of cardiovascular outcome in various patient groups as well as in general population, and can directly accelerate the atherosclerotic process. Arterial stiffness is regulated by numerous factors. Traditionally, mean arterial pressure and structural changes in the components of arterial wall were thought to be main determinants of arterial stiffness, however it is now recognized that arterial stiffness is also regulated by the smooth muscle tone and that endothelium derived mediators, such as NO, contribute to the functional regulation of arterial stiffness. It has also become apparent that inflammation has an important role in the stiffening of the large arteries, possibly via changes in the composition of the arterial wall due to inflammatory cell infiltration or via endothelial dysfunction. Recently, numerous small scale interventional studies have looked into the possibility of using anti-inflammatory and cholesterol-reduction therapies with anti-inflammatory properties as a means to reduce arterial stiffness and therefore cardiovascular risk. Anti-inflammatory therapies, such as corticosteroids and anti-TNF alpha therapy have been shown to reduce arterial stiffness in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions. In addition, statins and other cholesterol-reducing agents have been shown to have beneficial effects on wave reflection and aortic stiffness reduction in several patient groups. This review aims to explore the studies investigating the role of inflammation on arterial stiffening and to review the results from the studies investigating the effect of anti-inflammatory drugs and statins for arterial stiffness reduction and finally, to discuss the potential mechanisms by which these drugs may reduce arterial stiffness."
