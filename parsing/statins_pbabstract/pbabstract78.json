Pharmacokinetics (PK) of drugs varies in males and females that may result in altered drug response and therapeutic efficacy. In current study, PK of rosuvastatin has been evaluated in males and females. A single oral dose (40 mg rosuvastatin), open-label and non-controlled PK study was arranged. A reversed phase HPLC method was applied for quantification of rosuvastatin in serum samples. PK parameters of rosuvastatin were compared in males and females by applying student t test at 95 % confidence interval. The C max, [Formula: see text]and [Formula: see text]of rosuvastatin was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in females compared with males. The Vd/F of rosuvastatin was insignificantly higher (p > 0.05) in males compared with females while CL/F was significantly (p < 0.05) faster in males when compared at 95 % confidence interval. Rosuvastatin plasma level was significantly high in females compared with males that may be a possible reason for higher incidence of cardiac myopathy and other side effects in females. The variation in PK of drugs in males and females may require dose adjustment for maximum therapeutic effectiveness and safety.",

    "5": "Despite great progress in prevention strategies, pharmacotherapy and interventional treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD), cardiovascular events still constitute the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the modern world. Traditional risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, obesity, dyslipidemia, and positive family history account for the occurrence of the majority of these events, but not all of them. Adequate risk assessment remains the most challenging in individuals classified into low or intermediate risk categories. Inflammation plays a key role in the initiation and promotion of atherosclerosis and may lead to acute coronary syndrome (ACS) by the induction of plaque instability. For this reason, numerous inflammatory markers have been extensively investigated as potential candidates for the enhancement of cardiovascular risk assessment. This review aims to critically assess the clinical utility of well-established (C-reactive protein [CRP] and fibrinogen), newer (lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 [Lp-PLA2] and myeloperoxidase [MPO]) and novel (growth differentiation factor-15 [GDF-15]) inflammatory markers which, reflect different pathophysiological pathways underlying CAD. Although according to the traditional approach all discussed inflammatory markers were shown to be associated with the risk of future cardiovascular events in individuals with and without CAD, their clear clinical utility remains not fully elucidated. Current recommendations of numerous scientific societies predominantly advocate routine assessment of CRP in healthy people with intermediate cardiovascular risk. However, these recommendations substantially vary in their strength among particular societies. These discrepancies have a multifactorial background, including: (i) the strong prognostic value of CRP supported by solid scientific evidence and proven to be comparable in magnitude with that of total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or hypertension, (ii) favourable analytical characteristics of commercially available CRP assays, (iii) lack of CRP specificity and causal relationship between CRP concentration and cardiovascular risk, and (iv) CRP dependence on other classical risk factors. Of major importance, CRP measurement in healthy men \u226550 years of age or healthy women \u226560 years of age with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol <130\u2009mg/dL may be helpful in the selection of patients for statin therapy. Additionally, evaluation of CRP and fibrinogen or Lp-PLA2 may be considered to facilitate risk stratification in ACS patients and in healthy individuals with intermediate cardiovascular risk, respectively. Nevertheless, the clinical utility of CRP requires further investigation in a broad spectrum of CAD patients, while other promising inflammatory markers, particularly GDF-15 and Lp-PLA2, should be tested in individuals both with and without established CAD. Further studies should also focus on novel performance metrics such as measures of discrimination, calibration and reclassification, in order to better address the clinical utility of investigated biomarkers and to avoid misleadingly optimistic results. It also has to be emphasized that, due to the multifactorial pathogenesis of CAD, detailed risk stratification remains a complex process also involving, beyond assessment of inflammatory biomarkers, the patient's clinical characteristics, results of imaging examinations, electrocardiographic findings and other laboratory parameters (e.g. lipid profile, indices of renal function, markers of left ventricular overload and fibrosis, and biomarkers of myocardial necrosis, preferably cardiac troponins).",

Further, the inhibitory effect of the statins on leptin-induced migration was shown to be modulated by the prenylation of farnesyl pyrophosphate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. Although stimulation with a leptin showed no significant effect, a marked increase in capillary-like tube formation was observed with a joint stimulation with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Although statins caused inhibition of proliferation and migration, the same dose of the agents amplified the selective growth of capillary-like tube formation.

More recently, the drug was approved for use in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) to improve glycemic control. Thus, colesevelam is currently the only single-agent monotherapy approved by the FDA to lower both LDL-C and glycated hemoglobin (A1c) levels in adults with T2DM and elevated LDL-C. Moreover, the formulation options for colesevelam have also expanded since its original approval.",

We characterized the C. elegans hmgr-1(tm4368) mutant, which lacks HMG-CoA reductase, and show that its phenotypes recapitulate that of statin treatment, though in a more severe form. Specifically, the hmgr-1(tm4368) mutant has defects in growth, reproduction and protein prenylation, is rescued by exogenous mevalonate, exhibits constitutive activation of the UPRer and requires less mevalonate to be healthy when the UPRmt is activated by a constitutively active form of ATFS-1. We also show that different amounts of mevalonate are required for different physiological processes, with reproduction requiring the highest levels. Finally, we provide evidence that the mevalonate pathway is required for the activation of the UPRmt.",

    "16": "Statins reduce lipid levels and are widely prescribed. Statins have been associated with an increased incidence of type 2 diabetes, but the mechanisms are unclear. Activation of the NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3)/caspase-1 inflammasome, promotes insulin resistance, a precursor of type 2 diabetes. We showed that four different statins increased interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) secretion from macrophages, which is characteristic of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. This effect was dose dependent, absent in NLRP3(-/-) mice, and prevented by caspase-1 inhibition or the diabetes drug glyburide. Long-term fluvastatin treatment of obese mice impaired insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in adipose tissue. Fluvastatin-induced activation of the NLRP3/caspase-1 pathway was required for the development of insulin resistance in adipose tissue explants, an effect also prevented by glyburide. Fluvastatin impaired insulin signaling in lipopolysaccharide-primed 3T3-L1 adipocytes, an effect associated with increased caspase-1 activity, but not IL-1\u03b2 secretion. Our results define an NLRP3/caspase-1-mediated mechanism of statin-induced insulin resistance in adipose tissue and adipocytes, which may be a contributing factor to statin-induced development of type 2 diabetes. These results warrant scrutiny of insulin sensitivity during statin use and suggest that combination therapies with glyburide, or other inhibitors of the NLRP3 inflammasome, may be effective in preventing the adverse effects of statins.",

    "21": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is one of the most frequent manifestations of atherosclerosis and is associated with atherosclerosis in the coronary and carotid arteries, leading to a highly increased incidence of cardiovascular events. Major risk factors of PAD are similar to those that lead to atherosclerosis in other vascular beds. However, there are differences in the power of individual risk factors in the different vascular territories. Cigarette smoking and diabetes mellitus represent the greatest risks of PAD. For prevention of the progression of PAD and accompanying cardiovascular events similar preventative measures are used as in coronary artery disease (CAD). However, recent data indicate that there are some differences in the efficacy of drugs used in the prevention of atherothrombotic events in PAD. Antiplatelet treatment is indicated in virtually all patients with PAD. In spite of the absence of hard evidence- based data on the long term efficacy of aspirin, it is still considered as a first line treatment and clopidogrel as an effective alternative. The new antiplatelet drugs ticagrelol and prasugrel also represent promising options for treatment of PAD. Statin therapy is indicated to achieve the target low density lipoprotein cholesterol level of \u22642.5 mmol/L (100 mg/dL) and there is emerging evidence that lower levels are more effective. Statins may also improve walking capacity. Antihypertensive treatment is indicated to achieve the goal blood pressure (<140/90 mmHg). All classes of antihypertensive drugs including beta-blockers are acceptable for treatment of hypertension in patients with PAD. Diabetic patients with PAD should reduce their glycosylated haemoglobin to \u22647%. As PAD patients represent the group with the highest risk of atherothrombotic events, these patients need the most intensive treatment and elimination of risk factors of atherosclerosis. These measures should be as comprehensive as those in patients with established coronary and cerebrovascular disease.",

Mice were subjected to hind limb ischemic insult for 2 h and were simultaneously administered an intraperitoneal injection of simvastatin (5 mg/kg); this was followed by 36 h of reperfusion. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels in the muscles of the hind limb were determined. CXC chemokines and pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-2, cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant (KC), interleukin (IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, and P-selectin, were assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Leukocyte rolling and adhesion in vitro was assessed to indicate leukocyte recruitment at the site of inflammation. Quantitative measurement of skeletal muscle tissue injury was performed. The fluorescent dye level in tissue and serum was used to determine hind limb vascular leakage and tissue edema after I/R. Systemic and differentiated leukocytes were also counted. Simvastatin significantly reduced MIP-2, KC, TNF-\u03b1, MPO, IL-6, and P-selectin levels compared to the sham group and I/R plus pretreatment with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) group (P<0.05). Compared to the sham group and I/R plus PBS group, the I/R plus simvastatin group had attenuated inflammation, vascular leakage, and muscular damage (P<0.05). Simvastatin also significantly inhibited leukocyte rolling and adhesion compared to PBS (P<0.05).

We aimed to study the modulation of the hepatobiliary transport of bilirubin by four statin derivatives, atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pravastatin, and rosuvastatin in sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes. All statins except pravastatin significantly inhibited the uptake of bilirubin. The biliary efflux of bilirubin conjugates was increased by pravastatin and rosuvastatin concentration dependently. Rosuvastatin stimulated not only the Mrp2 mediated biliary, but the Mrp3 mediated sinusoidal elimination, resulting in decreased intracellular bilirubin accumulation. The significantly induced Mrp2/3 protein levels (ranging from 1.5 to 1.8-fold) accounted for the elevated efflux. Cell polarization, the formation of biliary network was also significantly increased by fluvastatin, pravastatin and rosuvastatin (151%, 216% and 275% of the control, respectively). The simultaneous inhibition of the uptake and the stimulation of the sinusoidal and canalicular elimination may explain, at least in part, the clinical observation of elevated serum bilirubin levels. In conclusion, our results suggest that in spite of the elevated serum bilirubin levels, the altered Mrp2 and Mrp3 functions by statins is probably not associated with hepatotoxic effects.",

Transcription of the repeats causes a toxic RNA gain of function involving their accumulation in ribonuclear foci. This leads to sequestration of splicing factors and alters pre-mRNA splicing in a range of downstream effector genes, which is thought to contribute to the diverse DM2 clinical features. Hyperlipidemia is frequent in DM2 patients, but the treatment is problematic because of an increased risk of statin-induced adverse reactions. Hypothesizing that shared pathways lead to the increased risk, we compared the skeletal muscle expression profiles of DM2 patients and controls with patients with hyperlipidemia on statin therapy. Neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally downregulated-4 (NEDD4), an ubiquitin ligase, was one of the dysregulated genes identified in DM2 patients and patients with statin-treated hyperlipidemia. In DM2 muscle, NEDD4 mRNA was abnormally spliced, leading to aberrant NEDD4 proteins. NEDD4 was down-regulated in persons taking statins, and simvastatin treatment of C2C12 cells suppressed NEDD4 transcription. Phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN), an established NEDD4 target, was increased and accumulated in highly atrophic DM2 muscle fibers. PTEN ubiquitination was reduced in DM2 myofibers, suggesting that the NEDD4-PTEN pathway is dysregulated in DM2 skeletal muscle. Thus, this pathway may contribute to the increased risk of statin-adverse reactions in patients with DM2.",

Medical evaluation, anthropometric measurements, blood tests and cardiac computed tomography were obtained.", 
    "57": "In analyses adjusted for age, gender, diabetes, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, smoking and statin therapy, no association was found between coronary calcium score (CCS) and LDL-C [1.79 (0.75-4.29)]. There was no association between triglycerides and CCS. The association between high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and CCS was significant and robust in unadjusted [0.32 (0.15-0.67)] as well as in the fully adjusted analysis [0.34 (0.15-0.75)].",

Of those, 7832 patients included in the intention-to-treat analysis were stratified into 4 groups: abnormal fasting glucose (AFG) plus high TGs, high TGs alone, AFG alone, and normal fasting glucose plus normal TGs (reference). Cox proportional hazard models were used to compare the incidence of and mortality from CVD in the 4 groups.", 
    "61": "Incidence of CVD and coronary heart disease was significantly higher in the groups with AFG alone (hazard ratio [HR], 2.02 and 3.38; P < .01, respectively) and AFG plus high TGs (HR, 2.87 and 3.87; P < .01, respectively) than the reference group. A similar relation was found in models adjusting for high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Although the incidence of cerebral infarction was significantly higher only in the group with AFG plus high TGs (HR, 2.16; P = .01), it was marginally significantly higher than the reference group after adjustment for HDL-C (HR, 1.86; P = .06). Diet plus pravastatin treatment reduced the risk of cerebral infarction by 66% in the group with AFG plus high TGs (P = .03).",

CCTA results were categorized as no CAD, <50% stenosis, and \u226550% stenosis. Based on the number of involved segments, extent of disease was categorized as nonextensive (\u22644 segments) or extensive CAD (>4 segments). Electronic medical records and patient interviews were reviewed blinded to CCTA findings to assess initiation of aspirin and intensification of lipid-lowering therapies. Survival analysis was performed to evaluate intensification of lipid therapy as a predictor of cardiovascular death or nonfatal myocardial infarction. Among 2839 patients with mean follow-up of 3.6 years, the odds of physician intensification of lipid-lowering therapy significantly increased for those with nonobstructive CAD (odds ratio, 3.6; 95% confidence interval, 2.9-4.9; P<0.001) and obstructive CAD (odds ratio, 5.6; 95% confidence interval, 4.3-7.3; P<0.001). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels declined significantly in association with intensification of lipid-lowering therapy after CCTA in all patient subgroups. In a hypothesis-generating analysis, among patients with nonobstructive but extensive CAD, statin use after CCTA was associated with a reduction in cardiovascular death or myocardial infarction (hazards ratio, 0.18; 95% confidence interval, 0.05-0.66; P=0.01).",

Their baseline FFA and hsCRP levels were also increased. Ezetimibe decreased circulating levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B-100. The drug significantly reduced plasma levels of visfatin and only tended to reduce plasma levels of leptin, TNF-\u03b1, visfatin, FFA and CRP. The effect of ezetimibe on these markers was lipid-independent but stronger in insulin-sensitive than in insulin-resistant patients.",

Subsequently, its effect on extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase 1 and 2 (JNK 1/2) expression was estimated by Western blot. Finally, the influence of fluvastatin on cell migration and production of MMP-9 and VEGF was determined using a wound-healing assay and ELISA test, respectively.", 
    "72": "The results obtained showed that fluvastatin had a remarkable inhibitory and cytotoxic effect on tumor C6 cells (IC(50) = 8.6 \u03bcM, 48 h), but did not inhibit the growth of normal neuronal cells. The concentrations from 1 to 10 \u03bcM induced marked morphologic alterations typical for apoptosis including shrinkage of cytoplasm, chromatin condensation, and nucleus breakdown.", 
    "73": "The inhibitory effects of fluvastatin on cell proliferation seemed to be associated with decreased p-ERK1/2 expression, upregulation of p-JNK1/2, and reduction in the MMP-9 and VEGF concentrations in culture media. The high anticancer (antiproliferative, proapoptotic, antiinvasive) activity of fluvastatin and lack of its toxicity against normal cells indicate a potential use of this statin in the treatment of malignant glioma.",

    "88": "Increased intake of omega-3 fatty acids associated with decreased omega-6 - resulting in higher omega-3 to omega-6 ratio compared with Western-type diet - is inversely associated with breast cancer risk. The modernized Mediterranean diet with high omega-3 to omega-6 ratio, high fiber and polyphenol intake, and consumption of low-glycemic index foods reduces overall cancer risk and specifically breast cancer risk. It has been suggested that consuming no more than one alcoholic drink per day, preferably wine, is preferable. Eliminating environmental contaminants, including endocrine disruptors, and favoring organic foods to increase polyphenol intake and the omega-3 to omega-6 ratios were also shown to be beneficial. Cholesterol-lowering statins may decrease antitumor defenses; are toxic for the mitochondria; decrease the omega-3 to omega-6 ratio; increase body mass index, insulin resistance and diabetic risk; and have been associated with an increased breast cancer risk.",

    "90": "In situ forming implants are an attractive choice for controlled drug release into a fixed location. Currently, rapidly solidifying solvent exchange systems suffer from a high initial burst, and sustained release behavior is tied to polymer precipitation and degradation rate. The present studies investigated addition of hydroxyapatite (HA) and drug-loaded poly(\u03b2-amino ester) (PBAE) microparticles to in situ forming poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA)-based systems to prolong release and reduce burst. PBAEs were synthesized, imbibed with simvastatin (osteogenic) or clodronate (anti-resorptive), and then ground into microparticles. Microparticles were mixed with or without HA into a PLGA solution, and the mixture was injected into buffer, leading to precipitation and creating solid scaffolds with embedded HA and PBAE microparticles. Simvastatin release was prolonged through 30\u2009days, and burst release was reduced from 81 to 39% when loaded into PBAE microparticles. Clodronate burst was reduced from 49 to 32% after addition of HA filler, but release kinetics were unaffected after loading into PBAE microparticles. Scaffold dry mass remained unchanged through day 15, with a pronounced increase in degradation rate after day 30, while wet scaffolds experienced a mass increase through day 25 due to swelling. Porosity and pore size changed throughout degradation, likely due to a combination of swelling and degradation. The system offers improved release kinetics, multiple release profiles, and rapid solidification compared to traditional in situ forming implants.",

Secondary end points were the incidence of atrial fibrillation (AF) during hospitalization and length of hospital stay.", 
    "93": "The primary end point occurred in 2.4% of patients treated with atorvastatin reload and in 8% in the placebo arm (p = 0.0088). The incidence of AF during hospitalization was 6.8% in patients treated with atorvastatin reload and 17% in the placebo arm (p = 0.0003). Compared with the placebo arm, the atorvastatin reload arm shortened the length of stay (9.8 \u00b1 3.3 vs. 10.6 \u00b1 3.5 days, p = 0.009).

    "95": "There is almost no data on the genetics of acute coronary syndromes, so this review discusses primarily the 50 genetic risk variants associated with coronary artery disease that are of genome-wide significance in the discovery population and replicated in an independent population. All of these risk variants are extremely common with more than half occurring in >50% of the general population. They increased only minimally the relative risk for coronary artery disease. The most striking finding is that 35 of the 50 risk variants act independently of known risk factors, indicating there are several pathways yet to be appreciated, contributing to the pathogenesis of coronary atherosclerosis and myocardial infarction. All of the genetic variants seem to act through atherosclerosis, except for the ABO blood groups, which show that A and B are associated with increased risk for myocardial infarction, mediated by a prolonged von Willebrand plasma half life leading to thrombosis. The potential molecular mechanisms of 9p21 are discussed, including cell cycle kinase inhibitors. Discovery of risk variants associated with PCSK9 has led to the development of novel treatment for plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. A monoclonal antibody inhibiting PCSK9 has already undergone phase I and II clinical trials, showing it is a potent inhibitor of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and is mediated through more rapid removal of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol from the plasma. This therapy complements that of statin therapy, which inhibits the synthesis of cholesterol. The benefits of Mendelian randomization to assess safety and efficacy and their limitations are discussed along with future directions.", 
    "96": "The period following an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) represents a critical time frame with a high risk for recurrent events and death. The pathogenesis of this increase in clinical cardiovascular disease events after ACS is complex, with molecular mechanisms including increased thrombosis and inflammation. Dyslipoproteinemia is common in patients with ACS and predictive of recurrent cardiovascular disease events after presentation with an ACS event. Although randomized clinical trials have provided fairly convincing evidence that high-dose statins reduce the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events after ACS, there remain questions about how aggressively to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in ACS. Furthermore, no other lipid-related interventions have yet been proven to be effective in reducing major cardiovascular events after ACS. Here, we review the relationship of lipoproteins as biomarkers to cardiovascular risk after ACS, the evidence for lipid-targeted interventions, and the potential for novel therapeutic approaches in this arena.",

The rats were orally administered paroxetine (10 mg/kg) and pravastatin (10 mg/d) or both the drugs daily for 28 d. The pharmacokinetics of paroxetine and pravastatin were examined on d 1 and d 28. Biochemical parameters including serum insulin, glucose and lipids were monitored during the treatments. An insulin-secreting cell line (INS-1) was used for measuring insulin secretion.", 
    "99": "In diabetic rats, co-administration of paroxetine and pravastatin markedly increased the concentrations of both the drugs compared with administration of each drug alone. Furthermore, co-administration severely impaired glucose homeostasis in diabetic rats, as demonstrated by significantly increased serum glucose level, decreased serum and pancreatic insulin levels, and decreased pancreatic Insulin-2 mRNA and tryptophan hydroxylase-1 (Tph-1) mRNA levels. Treatment of INS-1 cells with paroxetine (5 and 10 \u03bcmol/L) significantly inhibited insulin secretion, decreased the intracellular insulin, 5-HT, Insulin-2 mRNA and Tph-1 mRNA levels. Treatment of the cells with pravastatin (10 \u03bcmol/L) significantly stimulated insulin secretion, which was weakened by co-treatment with paroxetine.",

    "101": "Metastasis is one of the major obstacles for the successful therapy of breast cancer. Although increased candidate drugs targeting cancer metastasis are tested, their clinical translation is limited by either serve toxicity or low efficacy. In present work, a nano-drug delivery system loading atorvastatin calcium (Ator) was developed for the efficient suppression of the metastasis of breast cancer. The nano-drug delivery system was constructed by a amphiphilic copolymer of methoxy polyethylene glycol-s-s-vitamin E succinate (mPEG-s-s-VES, PSV), which was consisted of a hydrophilic mPEG1k segment and a hydrophobic VES head, which were conjugated with a linker bearing amide and disulfide groups simultaneously. Self-assembly of PSV and Ator formed Ator-loaded PSV micelles (ASM) with good colloidal stability, high drug loading content (up to 50%) and great encapsulation efficiency (99.09\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.28%). In cellular level, it was found that the ASM could efficiently release the Ator payload into cytosol due to detachment of PEG shell at high intracellular glutathione condition. ASM could significantly inhibit the migration and invasion of 4T1 breast cancer cells with inhibitory rates of 79.2% and 88.5%, respectively. In a 4T1 orthotropic mammary tumor metastatic cancer model, it was demonstrated that ASM could completely blocked the lung and liver metastasis of breast cancer with minimal toxicity owing to enhanced Ator accumulation in tumor and lung as compared with that of free Ator. The down-regulations of metastasis-promoting MMP-9, Twist and uPA proteins were demonstrated as the main underlying mechanism. As a result, ASM could be a promising drug delivery system for the efficient therapy of breast cancer metastasis.", 
    "102": "Randomized, controlled clinical trials have shown significant benefits of statin therapy in patients with or at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). But these trials typically enroll patients for only 5\u00a0years or so, prompting some clinicians to ask what the longer term follow-up of these patients will show. While most trials have a duration of only approximately 5\u00a0years, four large trials report extended post-trial follow-up to 10\u00a0years, and these trials, as well as multiple large cohort studies, suggest an expected benefit of statins' effects beyond 10\u00a0years. In this review we will summarize the current state of the literature, the benefits noted to date, and the potentially accumulating, adverse effects of long-term statin use.", 
    "103": "Severe pneumonia has a high mortality (38.2%) despite evidence-based therapy. Rising rates of antimicrobial resistance increase the urgency to develop new treatment strategies. Multiple adjuvant therapies for pneumonia have been investigated but none are currently licensed. Profound immune dysregulation occurs in patients with severe infection. An initial hyper-inflammatory response is followed by a secondary hypo-inflammatory response with 'immune-paralysis'. There is focus on the development of immunostimulatory agents to improve host ability to combat primary infection and reduce secondary infections. Successful treatments must be targeted to immune response; promising biomarkers exist but have not yet reached common bedside practice. We explore evidence for adjuvant therapies in community-acquired pneumonia. We highlight novel potential treatment strategies using a broad-based search strategy to include publications in pneumonia and severe sepsis. We explore reasons for the failure to develop effective adjuvant therapies and highlight the need for targeted therapy specific to immune activity.", 
    "104": "Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I) is a lysosomal storage disease characterized by deficient \u03b1-L-iduronidase activity, leading to the accumulation of poorly degraded glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Children with MPS I exhibit high incidence of spine disease, including accelerated disc degeneration and vertebral dysplasia, which in turn lead to spinal cord compression and kyphoscoliosis. In this study we investigated the efficacy of neonatal enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), alone or in combination with oral simvastatin (ERT\u2009+\u2009SIM) for attenuating cervical spine disease progression in MPS I, using a canine model. Four groups were studied: normal controls; MPS I untreated; MPS I ERT-treated; and MPS I ERT\u2009+\u2009SIM-treated. Animals were euthanized at age 1 year. Intervertebral disc condition and spinal cord compression were evaluated from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images and plain radiographs, vertebral bone condition and odontoid hypoplasia were evaluated using micro-computed tomography (\u00b5CT), and epiphyseal cartilage to bone conversion was evaluated histologically. Untreated MPS I animals exhibited more advanced disc degeneration and more severe spinal cord compression than normal animals. Both treatment groups resulted in partial preservation of disc condition and cord compression, with ERT\u2009+\u2009SIM not significantly better than ERT alone. Untreated MPS I animals had significantly lower vertebral trabecular bone volume and mineral density, whereas ERT treatment resulted in partial preservation of these properties. ERT\u2009+\u2009SIM treatment demonstrated similar, but not greater, efficacy. Both treatment groups partially normalized endochondral ossification in the vertebral epiphyses (as indicated by absence of persistent growth plate cartilage), and odontoid process size and morphology. These results indicate that ERT begun from a very early age attenuates the severity of cervical spine disease in MPS I, particularly for the vertebral bone and odontoid process, and that additional treatment with simvastatin does not provide a significant additional benefit over ERT alone.",

The method was validated over a linear concentration range of 0.25-15\u2009\u00b5g/mL for ciprofloxacin and 0.33-20\u2009\u00b5g/mL for rosuvastatin (r(2) \u2009\u2265\u20090.999). The ranges of reliable response (limits of detection and quantitation) for ciprofloxacin were 3-15 and 9-45\u2009ng/mL and 17-29 and 52-88\u2009ng/mL, respectively, for rosuvastatin in all API, pharmaceutical formulations and human serum. Analytical recovery from human serum was >98% and relative standard deviation (RSD) was <2. The accuracies were 97.13-102.55 and 97.41-101.31% and precisions in RSD were 0.04-1.90 and 0.02-1.23% for ciprofloxacin and rosuvastatin, respectively. No matrix interferences, ion suppression/enhancement and carry-over were detected. The total assay run time was less than 5\u2009min. In another study, for optimum performance the detector was programmed for multiwavelength scanning at the absorption maxima of each component. Consequently, the linearity range was improved and limit of detection and quantitation values were down to 1-4 and 4-12\u2009ng/mL for ciprofloxacin and 3-5 and 9-15\u2009ng/mL for rosuvastatin, respectively. The validation parameters fitted ICH guidelines through the isosbestic and individual \u03bbmax approach.

    "110": "Favourable lifestyles promote cardiovascular protection. Exercise can induce beneficial changes in the genome that decrease low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and increase anti-inflammatory markers. The Mediterranean dietary pattern, fortified by nuts, while not reducing weight, reduces mortality. Lifestyle changes combined with statin therapy provide potent protection against coronary heart disease, especially when used for secondary prevention after cardiovascular events. Decisions regarding the initiation of statin therapy for primary prevention are more difficult, requiring consideration of both the LDL-C level and the degree of cardiovascular risk for dyslipidaemic patients. Combining intensive exercise and statin therapy substantially reduces the mortality risk, and thus is potentially the ideal risk-reducing combination.",

Acute antihyperlipidemic activity was evaluated by using Triton WR-1339 (100 mg kg(-1)) and chronic, induced by high fat diet. Total Cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), Low Density Lipoproteins (LDL), High Density Lipoproteins (HDL) and Very Low Density Lipoproteins (VLDL) were examined in addition to HMG-CoA reductase enzyme activity and fecal cholesterol excretion. In Triton WR-1339 (acute model) at the dose of 400 mg kg(-1), AF-LIP significantly lowered TC, TG, very Low Density Lipoproteins Cholesterol (VLDL-C), Low Density Lipoproteins Cholesterol (LDL-C) levels with simultaneous increase in High Density Lipoproteins Cholesterol (HDL-C) levels (p < 0.01) at 6 and 24 h. Also there was significant reduction in TC and LDL-C levels at 48 h at the dose of 400 mg kg(-1). In chronic model also at the dose of 100, 200 and 400 mg kg(-1), AF-LIP significantly reduced (p < 0.001) TC and LDL-C levels with increase in HDL-C levels. TG and VLDL-C levels were also not much affected. HMG-CoA reductase enzyme activity when estimated was not much decreased. Also AF-LIP showed significant reduction in atherogenic index (p < 0.01) with significant increase in HDL/TC ratio (p < 0.01). Fecal cholesterol excretion was significantly enhanced (p < 0.01) in all the test doses of AF-LIP. AF-LIP may be beneficial for the treatment of atherosclerosis, since atherosclerosis is one of the secondary complications of hyperlipidemia.",

    "118": "Statins are the first line treatment for the management of hyperlipidemia. However, the primary adverse effect limiting their use is myopathy. This study examines the efficacy and safety of red yeast rice (RYR), a source of natural statins, as compared with atorvastatin, which is the most widely used synthetic statin. Statin interference with the endogenous synthesis of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) prompted the hypothesis that its deficiency may be implicated in the pathogenesis of statin-associated myopathy. Hence, the effects of combination of CoQ10 with either statin have been evaluated. Rats were rendered hyperlipidemic through feeding them a high-fat diet for 90 days, during the last 30 days of the diet they were treated daily with either atorvastatin, RYR, CoQ10, or combined regimens. Lipid profile, liver function tests, and creatine kinase were monitored after 15 and 30 days of drug treatments. Heart contents of CoQ9 and CoQ10 were assessed and histopathological examination of the liver and aortic wall was performed. RYR and CoQ10 had the advantage over atorvastatin in that they lower cholesterol without elevating creatine kinase, a hallmark of myopathy. RYR maintained normal levels of heart ubiquinones, which are essential components for energy production in muscles. In conclusion, RYR and CoQ10 may offer alternatives to overcome atorvastatin-associated myopathy.", 
    "119": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in dialysis patients and the most common cause of death and allograft loss among kidney transplant recipients. End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is associated with an increased incidence and prevalence of a wide range of CVDs including coronary artery disease, stroke, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation, sudden cardiac death, pulmonary hypertension, and valvular heart disease. CVD risk factors are very common in patients with ESRD, and most patients have multiple risk factors. Kidney transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients with ESRD, as a successful transplant improves longevity and quality of life, primarily by decreasing the incidence and severity of CVD. Correction of the uremic state and improved glomerular filtration rate seem to be the major mechanism of this benefit. Transplant candidates should undergo cardiovascular assessment, usually echocardiography and exercise stress testing, and may require formal cardiology consultation. Higher risk candidates, including those aged >50 years, hypertension, diabetes, established coronary artery disease or peripheral vascular disease, left ventricular hypertrophy, and dialysis duration >1 year, should have repeat cardiovascular assessment every 1-2 years. Transplant candidates and recipients should have individualized treatment for CVD and risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and obesity. Special consideration should be given for statin therapy, as its use is associated with decreased cardiovascular death in dialysis and transplant patients. Prospective randomized, controlled trials are needed to determine the optimal approach to diagnosis and treat CVD in the transplant candidate and recipient population.",

    "165": "Normal high density lipoprotein (HDL) protects vascular function; however these protective effects of HDL may absent in valvular heart disease (VHD). Because vascular function plays an important role in maintaining the circulation post-cardiac surgery and some patients are difficult to stabilize, we hypothesized that a deleterious vascular effect of HDL may contribute to vascular dysfunction in VHD patients following surgery. HDL was isolated from age-match 28 healthy subjects and 84 patients with VHD and during cardiac surgery. HDL pro-inflammation index was measured and the effects of HDL on vasodilation, protein interaction, generation of nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide were determined. Patients with VHD received either simvastatin (20mg/d) or routine medications, and endothelial effects of HDL were characterized. HDL inflammation index significantly increased in VHD patients and post-cardiac surgery. HDL from VHD patients and post-cardiac surgery significantly impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation, inhibited both Akt and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) phosphorylation at S1177, eNOS associated with heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), NO production and increased eNOS phosphorylation at T495 and superoxide generation. Simvastatin therapy partially reduced HDL inflammation index, improved the capacity of HDL to stimulate eNOS and Akt phosphorylation at S1177, eNOS associated with HSP90, NO production, reduced eNOS phosphorylation at T495 and superoxide generation, and improved endothelium-dependent vasodilation. Our data demonstrated that HDL from VHD patients and cardiac surgery contributed to endothelial dysfunction through uncoupling of eNOS. This deleterious effect can be reversed by simvastatin, which improves the vasoprotective effects of HDL. Targeting HDL may be a therapeutic strategy for maintaining vascular function and improving the outcomes post-cardiac surgery.",

A combinatorial approach protects each drug from the development of resistance and reduces generally the overall transmission rate of malaria. Statins, the inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A reductase and a family of lipid-lowering drugs, have in vitro anti-malarial properties, and more specially atorvastatin. However, atorvastatin has a short elimination half-life (14 hours) and an efficient combination of anti-malarial drugs must associate a drug with a short elimination half-life and a drug with a long elimination half-life. The objective of the present work was to identify new potential partners among standard new anti-malarial drugs with long elimination half-life, such as lumefantrine, piperaquine, pyronaridine and atovaquone, to improve the in vitro activity of atorvastatin against different Plasmodium falciparum strains to treat uncomplicated malaria.",

The spatial organization of K-Ras is controlled by the prenyl binding protein PDE\u03b4, which enhances Ras diffusion in the cytosol. Inhibition of the Ras-PDE\u03b4 interaction by small molecules impairs Ras localization and signaling. Here we describe in detail the identification and structure guided development of Ras-PDE\u03b4 inhibitors targeting the farnesyl binding pocket of PDE\u03b4 with nanomolar affinity. We report kinetic data that characterize the binding of the most potent small molecule ligands to PDE\u03b4 and prove their binding to endogenous PDE\u03b4 in cell lysates.

The current work, for the first time, accounts the antioxidant, genoprotective, antilipoperoxidative, and HMG-CoA reductase (EC 1.1.1.34) inhibitory properties of traditional medicinal plant, Ficus palmata Forsk. Our result showed that among sequentially extracted fractions of Ficus palmata Forsk, FPBA (F. palmata bark aqueous extract) and FPLM (F. palmata leaves methanolic extract) extracts have higher phenolic content and also exhibited significantly more radical scavenging (DPPH and Superoxide) and antioxidant (FRAP) capacity. Moreover, FPBA extract also exhibited significantly higher inhibition of lipid peroxidation assay. Additionally, results showed almost complete and partial protection of oxidatively damaged DNA by these plant extracts when compared to mannitol. Furthermore, our results showed that FPBA extract (IC50 = 9.1 \u00b1 0.61 \u00b5g/mL) exhibited noteworthy inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase activity as compared to other extracts, which might suggest its role as cardioprotective agent. In conclusion, results showed that FPBA extract not only possess significant antioxidant and genoprotective property but also is able to attenuate the enzymatic activity of HMG-CoA reductase, which might suggest its role in combating various oxidative stress-related diseases, including atherosclerosis.",

Even when a family history of premature cardiovascular disease is taken into account, there is often ambiguity about the need for statin therapy for patients with a 10-year FRS of 5%-19% and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol <3.5 mmol/L. Current Canadian dyslipidemia guidelines recommend consideration of a diversity of other factors, including biochemical measurements and imaging studies to help determine whether the calculated FRS might be misleadingly low and whether statin therapy might, therefore, be prudent. However, efficient use of the plethora of secondary factors makes this decision process itself potentially ambiguous. This brief summary provides a practical approach for using clinical information, basic biochemical tests, and more specialized tests, such as carotid ultrasound and coronary artery calcium scoring, to identify groups of patients at greater risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease than suggested by the FRS.",
