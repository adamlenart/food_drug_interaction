    "1": "90 patients with UAP treated with conventional medications and PCI were recruited and were randomly divided into the control group and the experimental group. The control group had 42 patients were treated with atorvastatin alone, while the experimental group had 48 cases treated with atorvastatin combined with trimetazidine. All the patients were checked the preoperative 24h and postoperative 24h PCI concentrations of cardiac troponin I (cTnI), hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), serum interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) and interlukin-10 (IL-10).", 
    "2": "At the pre-PCI stage, every serum factors was no significant difference. 24 hours after the PCI intervention, the occurence of abnormal cTnI level in the experimental group was remarkable reduced than the control group. In the experimental group, the serum levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3 significantly decreased (p < 0.05); while IL-10 was increased. In the control group, all the mediators were increased significantly except the hs-CRP (p < 0.05).", 
    "3": "No unexpected symptom was found in patients with large dose atorvastatin combined with large dose trimetazidine. The administration of conventional medications together with the atorvastatin plus trimetazidine were able to reduce the prevalence of postoperative myocardial injury.", 
    "4": "Myeloperoxidase (MPO) and C-reactive protein (CRP) may play critical roles in generation of oxidative stress and the development of the systemic inflammatory response. The aim of the study was to determine the effect of atorvastatin therapy on the MPO gene expression and its plasma level in relation to lipids level lowering and an anti-inflammatory response in patients after acute myocardial infarction. The research material was represented by 112 samples. Thirty-eight patients with first AMI receiving atorvastatin therapy (40 mg/day) and followed up for one month were involved in the study. The relative MPO gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was examined using RT-qPCR in 38 patients before-, 38 patients after-therapy and in 36 patients as the control group. The plasma concentrations of MPO and serum concentrations of biochemical parameters were determined using commercially available diagnostic tests. After one month of atorvastatin therapy, in 60.5% patients a decrease of MPO gene expression, whereas in 39.5% patients an increase, was observed. The plasma MPO levels behaved in the same way as the MPO gene expression. However, the serum lipids and CRP concentrations were significantly lower after one month of atorvastatin therapy in both groups of patients - with decreased and increased MPO gene expression. Atorvastatin exhibited a different effect on MPO gene expression and its plasma level. Short-term atorvastatin therapy resulted in lipid lowering and anti-inflammatory activity in patients after AMI, independently of its effect on MPO gene expression. The molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon are not yet defined and require further research.", 
    "5": "The aim of the study was to estimate association of the extent of angiographically proven coronary artery disease (CAD) with plasma 8-isoprostane F2 (8-iso-PGF2\u03b1) levels as a reliable marker of lipid peroxidation and serum activity of paraoxonase-1, which demonstrates the ability to protect against lipid oxidation. The study included 105 patients with angiographically documented CAD (CAD+) and 45 patients with negative results of coronary angiography (CAD-). Compared to the control group CAD+ patients were characterized by increased 8-iso-PGF2\u03b1 levels (P = 0.007) and reduced activity of PON-1 towards paraoxon (PONase, P = 0.002) and phenyl acetate (AREase, P = 0.037). Univariate correlation analysis indicated that 8-iso-PGF2\u03b1 concentrations were positively associated with the severity of CAD as evaluated by the Gensini score (R = 0.41, P < 0.001) while PONase activity (R = -0.26, P < 0.05) and AREase activity (R = -0.23, P < 0.05) were inversely correlated with CAD severity. PONase activity and 8-iso-PGF2\u03b1 concentration remained independent determinant of atherosclerosis severity in multiple linear regression after adjusting for age, gender, smoking habits, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, statin therapy, and HDL-C and TAG concentration (\u03b2 coefficients -0.267; P < 0.05 and 0.368; P < 0.001, resp.). The results suggest that PON-1 activity and 8-iso-PGF2\u03b1 concentration are associated with the presence and extent of coronary stenosis and may be considered additional markers of coronary artery disease.", 
    "6": "Hypercholesterolemia is the major risk factor that leads to atherosclerosis. Nowadays, alternative treatment using medicinal plants gained much attention since the usage of statins leads to adverse health effects, especially liver and muscle toxicity. This study was designed to investigate the hypocholesterolemic and antiatherosclerotic effects of Basella alba (B. alba) using hypercholesterolemia-induced rabbits. Twenty New Zealand white rabbits were divided into 5 groups and fed with varying diets: normal diet, 2% high cholesterol diet (HCD), 2% HCD + 10\u2009mg/kg simvastatin, 2% HCD + 100\u2009mg/kg B. alba extract, and 2% HCD + 200\u2009mg/kg B. alba extract, respectively. The treatment with B. alba extract significantly lowered the levels of total cholesterol, LDL, and triglycerides and increased HDL and antioxidant enzymes (SOD and GPx) levels. The elevated levels of liver enzymes (AST and ALT) and creatine kinase were noted in hypercholesterolemic and statin treated groups indicating liver and muscle injuries. Treatment with B. alba extract also significantly suppressed the aortic plaque formation and reduced the intima: media ratio as observed in simvastatin-treated group. This is the first in vivo study on B. alba that suggests its potential as an alternative therapeutic agent for hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis.", 
    "7": "Myocarditis, which is commonly known as heart inflammation, is a multifaceted disease that includes at least three phases. The host's immune system is mostly active during the first viral and the second autoimmune phase, when several inflammatory pathways are activated. One of the pivotal transcription factors that regulate immune responses is the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB). If, on one side, the acute response to heart injury activates the production of inflammatory cytokines to protect and limit host damage, on the other side sustained and long-term inflammation is one of the leading causes of cardiac hypertrophy and chronic heart failure. An update on the current knowledge of inhibitors and treatments that limit excessive inflammation in experimental and viral autoimmune myocarditis, and therapeutic approaches to cure patients with myocarditis, are described and discussed in this review.", 
    "8": "Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) remains a significant clinical challenge and is the leading cause of acute liver failure in most countries. An aging population that uses more medications, a constant influx of newly developed drugs and a growing risk from unfamiliar herbal and dietary supplements will make DILI an increasing part of clinical practice. Currently, the most effective strategy for disease management is rapid identification, withholding the inciting agents, supportive care and having a firm understanding of the expected natural history. There are resources available to aid the clinician, including a new online \"textbook\" as well as causality assessment tools, but a heightened awareness of risk and the disease's varying phenotypes and good history-taking remain cornerstones to diagnosis. Looking ahead, growing registries of cases, pharmacoepidemiology studies and translational research into the mechanisms of injury may produce better diagnostic tools, markers for risk and disease, and prevention and therapeutics.", 
    "9": "The identification of an effective disease-modifying treatment for the neurodegenerative progression in Parkinson's disease (PD) remains a major challenge. Epidemiological studies have reported that intake of statins, cholesterol lowering drugs, could be associated to a reduced risk of developing PD. In-vivo studies suggest that statins may reduce the severity of dopaminergic neurodegeneration. The trophic potential of statins and their impact on the expression of dopaminergic synaptic markers and dopamine (DA) transport function in SH-SY5Y cells has been investigated. The findings showed that statin treatment induces neurite outgrowth involving a specific effect on the complexity of the neurite branching pattern. Statins increased the levels of presynaptic dopaminergic biomarkers such as vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), synaptic vesicle glycoproteins 2A and 2C (SV2C), and synaptogyrin-3 (SYNGR3). Gene expression analysis confirmed a rapid statin-induced up-regulation of VMAT2-, SV2C-, and SYNGR3-mRNA levels. Assessment of [(3) H]DA transport in statin-treated cells showed a reduction in DA uptake concomitant to a modification of VMAT2 pharmacological properties. It was also observed that a nuclear translocation of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1). The results suggested that statins induced phenotypic changes in dopaminergic cells characterized by an increase of growth, complexity of structural synaptic elements, and expression of key presynaptic proteins with functional impact on the DA transport capacity. Statin-induced changes are likely the result of a downstream modulation of SREBP-1 pathway. Overall, these mechanisms may contribute to the neuroprotective or neurorestorative effects observed in the dopaminergic system and strengthen the therapeutic potential of statins for PD.", 
    "10": "No medical therapy has been proven to prevent the progression of aortic dilatation in bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) disease, and prophylactic aortic surgery remains the mainstay of treatment.", 
    "11": "Among patients with BAV disease who are referred for surgery, preoperative statin use is associated with decreased odds of ascending aortic dilatation.", 
    "12": "We reviewed all BAV patients who underwent aortic valve and/or aortic surgery at our center between April 2004 and December 2013. Aortic diameter (AD), defined as the maximum ascending aortic dimension, was determined by magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, or echocardiography. Patients were divided into 2 groups: maximal AD <4.5 cm or \u22654.5 cm. The association between preoperative statin use and aortic dilatation was assessed using multivariable logistic regression modeling.", 
    "13": "Of 680 consecutive patients, 405 (60%) had AD <4.5 cm (mean age, 60 \u00b1 14 years; 45% on statins), whereas 275 (40%) had AD \u22654.5 cm (mean age, 54 \u00b1 13 years; 35% on statins) at the time of surgery. After adjusting for age, body surface area, sex, hypertension, aortic stenosis, severity of aortic regurgitation, and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, and \u03b2-blockers, patients with AD \u22654.5 cm had 0.66\u00d7 lower odds (95% confidence interval: 0.45-0.96) of being on preoperative statins compared with those with AD <4.5 cm (P = 0.029).", 
    "14": "In a retrospective study of BAV patients referred for surgery, preoperative statin use was associated with lower odds of clinically significant ascending aortic dilatation.", 
    "15": "Antihyperlipidemic drug statins reportedly promote both bone formation and soft tissue healing. We examined the effect of sustained-release, fluvastatin-impregnated poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) microspheres on the promotion of bone and gingival healing at an extraction socket in vivo, and the effect of fluvastatin on epithelial cells and fibroblasts in vitro. The maxillary right first molar was extracted in rats, then one of the following was immediately injected, as a single dose, into the gingivobuccal fold: control (no administration), PLGA microspheres without a statin (active control), or PLGA microspheres containing 20 or 40 \u03bcg kg(-1) of fluvastatin. At days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 after injection, bone and soft tissue healing were histologically evaluated. Cell proliferation was measured under the effect of fluvastatin at dosages of 0, 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10, and 50 \u03bcM. Cell migration and morphology were observed at dosages of 0 and 0.1 \u03bcM. Following tooth extraction, the statin significantly enhanced bone volume and density, connective tissue volume, and epithelial wound healing. In the in vitro study, it promoted significant proliferation and migration of epithelial cells and fibroblasts. A single dose of topically administered fluvastatin-impregnated PLGA microspheres promoted bone and soft tissue healing at the extraction site.",

    "17": "AP prevalence is similar in those with vs without DM in a community sample with CAD.", 
    "18": "In adults with CAD in the US NHANES 2001-2010, AP was determined by self-report and Rose questionnaire and compared by DM status. Physical functioning and medication use were also evaluated.", 
    "19": "Of 1957 adults with CAD, 619 (28.2%) had DM. Prevalence of AP was similar in those with vs without DM (48.9% vs 46.3%; P = 0.38). There was a trend toward more severe AP in those with glycated hemoglobin \u22657% (50.4%) vs <7% (27.1%; P = 0.09). Adjusted logistic regression showed a similar odds of AP (1.06, 95% CI: 0.84-1.33) in those with vs without DM, although among DM, a 2-fold greater odds of AP in women vs men. Physical functioning was worse in those with vs without AP overall (score of 25.9 vs 24.3; P < 0.001) and further diminished within those with comorbid DM (26.7 vs 24.0; P < 0.001). Among those with AP, those with vs without DM were more likely on \u03b2-blockers, statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and antiplatelet therapy.",

    "21": "Metastatic melanoma is a life-threatening disease for which no effective treatment is currently available. In melanoma cells, Rho overexpression promotes invasion and metastasis. However, the effect of statins on spontaneous metastasis and tumor growth remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of statin-mediated tumor growth and metastasis inhibition in an in vivo model. We found that statins significantly inhibited spontaneous metastasis and tumor growth. Statins inhibited the mRNA expression and enzymatic activities of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in vivo and also suppressed the mRNA and protein expression of very late antigens (VLAs). Moreover, statins inhibited the prenylation of Rho as well as the phosphorylation of LIM kinase, serum response factor (SRF), and c-Fos downstream of the Rho signaling pathway. In addition, statins enhanced p53, p21, and p27 expression and reduced phosphorylation of cyclin-dependent kinase and expression of cyclin D1 and E2. These results indicate that statins suppress Rho signaling pathways, thereby inhibiting tumor metastasis and growth. Furthermore, statins markedly improved the survival rate in a metastasis model, suggesting that statins have potential clinical applications for the treatment of metastatic cancers.",

This paper reviews our current understanding of HDL, HDL structure and function, HDL subclasses, the relationship of low HDL with myocardial infarction, HDL targeted therapy, and clinical trials and studies.

    "23": "The oral route of administration is still by far the most ubiquitous method of drug delivery. Development in this area still faces many challenges due to the complexity and inhomogeneity of the gastrointestinal environment. In particular, dosing unpredictably relative to motility phase means the gastrointestinal environment is a random variable within a defined range. Here, we present a mass balance analysis that captures this variation and highlights the effects of gastrointestinal motility, exploring what impacts it ultimately has on plasma levels and the relationship to bioequivalence for high solubility products with both high and low permeability (BCS I and III). Motility-dependent compartmental absorption and transit (MDCAT) mechanistic analysis is developed to describe the underlying fasted state cyclical motility and how the contents of the gastrointestinal tract are propelled.", 
    "24": "The cardiac glycoside digitoxin preferentially inhibits the growth of breast cancer cells and targets the Erk pathway. Digitoxin alters the expression of genes that mediate calcium metabolism and IAP genes.", 
    "25": "Since the optimal treatment for cancer involves the use of agents in combination, we assessed the growth inhibitory effects of digitoxin combined with agents that alter calcium metabolism, thapsigargin, a sarcoplasmic/ER Ca(2+)-ATPase inhibitor, and the statin simvastatin, as well as digitoxin's effect on the IAP pathway of apoptosis.", 
    "26": "To reveal signaling pathways, we treated human cancer cells with digitoxin, alone or combined with thapsigargin or simvastatin, and measured cell growth using the MTT and colony formation assays. We used histology and Western blot analysis of HEK293 cells to assay effects on IAPs.", 
    "27": "Digitoxin inhibited the growth of breast, colon and ovarian cancer cells. Consistent with an effect on calcium metabolism, digitoxin exhibited synergy with thapsigargin and simvastatin on ER-negative breast cancer cells. Digitoxin activates expression of Erk pathway genes and suppresses expression of IAP genes. The growth inhibitory effects on HEK293 cells are not blocked by the pancaspase inhibitor zVAD-FMK, indicating that digitoxin may act by a caspase independent pathway of apoptosis. Furthermore, digitoxin does not have an effect on XIAP protein, a major anti-apoptotic protein.", 
    "28": "Digitoxin appears to act through the Erk and stress response pathways and is worthwhile to study to prevent and treat cancer. Our findings warn of possible safety issues for cardiac patients who take a combination of digitoxin and statins.", 
    "29": "Mutant p53 proteins are present in more than half of human cancers. Yes-associated protein (YAP) is a key transcriptional regulator controlling organ growth, tissue homeostasis, and cancer. Here, we report that these two determinants of human malignancy share common transcriptional signatures. YAP physically interacts with mutant p53 proteins in breast cancer cells and potentiates their pro-proliferative transcriptional activity. We found YAP as well as mutant p53 and the transcription factor NF-Y onto the regulatory regions of cyclin A, cyclin B, and CDK1 genes. Either mutant p53 or YAP depletion down-regulates cyclin A, cyclin B, and CDK1 gene expression and markedly slows the growth of diverse breast cancer cell lines. Pharmacologically induced cytoplasmic re-localization of YAP reduces the expression levels of cyclin A, cyclin B, and CDK1 genes both in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, primary breast cancers carrying p53 mutations and displaying high YAP activity exhibit higher expression levels of cyclin A, cyclin B, and CDK1 genes when compared to wt-p53 tumors.", 
    "30": "Statins have been linked with improved prostate cancer survival and lower risk of recurrence in men treated with radiation therapy. However, the association is unclear for surgically-treated men. We studied the risk of prostate cancer recurrence and death by statin usage after radical prostatectomy in a cohort of prostate cancer patients treated with radical prostatectomy.", 
    "31": "A cohort of 1,314 men who underwent curative-intent radical prostatectomy at the Tampere University Hospital, Tampere, Finland during 1995-2009 were linked to national prescription database to obtain detailed information on statin purchases. The risk of PSA recurrence and death (overall and prostate cancer-specific) by statin use before and after the surgery were evaluated using Cox regression with model adjustment for tumor characteristics, total cholesterol and simultaneous use of antidiabetic and antihypertensive drugs. Tissue expression of putative prognostic markers were measured from a subgroup of 323 men.", 
    "32": "During the median follow-up of 8.6 years after surgery 484 men recurred, while 244 men died (32 due to prostate cancer). In general statin use before or after prostatectomy was not associated with risk of disease recurrence or death. Tissue expression of Ki-67 and ERG modified the association between statin use and risk of disease recurrence; the risk estimates were lower in men with Ki-67 expression above the median (P for interaction 0.001 and 0.004 for statin use before and after prostatectomy, respectively) and no ERG expression in the tumor tissue (P for interaction 0.006 and 0.011).", 
    "33": "Statin use generally did not affect prostate cancer prognosis after prostatectomy. The effect on disease recurrence may depend on tumor properties, such as proliferation activity. Thus possible future prospective studies should recognize and enroll subgroups of prostate cancer patients most likely to benefit from statins.",

    "37": "We used prospective data from 30,239 participants of the Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study, a national cohort of community-dwelling adults \u226545 years old. We identified serious infection hospitalizations between 2003 and 2012. Using the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria, we defined AKI as an increase in serum creatinine (sCr) \u22650.3 mg/dl from the first inpatient sCr measurement during the first 7 hospitalization days. We excluded individuals with a history of renal transplant or preexisting end-stage renal disease as well as individuals with <2 sCr measurements.

AKI occurred in 296 of 2,074 hospitalizations (16.5%). On multivariable analysis, prehospitalization characteristics independently associated with AKI among individuals hospitalized for a serious infection included a history of diabetes [odds ratio (OR) 1.38; 95% CI 1.02-1.89], increased cystatin C (OR 1.73 per SD; 95% CI 1.20-2.50), and increased albumin-to-creatinine ratio (OR 1.19 per SD; 95% CI 1.007-1.40). Sex, race, hypertension, myocardial infarction, estimated glomerular filtration rate, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory, statin, or antihypertensive medications were not associated with AKI.",

Herein, we describe genetic analysis of severely affected homozygous FH patients who were mostly resistant to statin therapy and were managed on an apheresis program. We identified a recurrent frameshift mutation p.(G676Afs*33) in exon 14 of the LDLR gene in 9 probands and their relatives in an apparently unrelated Saudi families. We also describe a three dimensional homology model of the LDL receptor protein (LDLR) structure and examine the consequence of the frameshift mutation p.(G676Afs*33), as this could affect the LDLR structure in a region involved in dimer formation, and protein stability. This finding of a recurrent mutation causing FH in the Saudi population could serve to develop a rapid genetic screening procedure for FH, and the 3D-structure analysis of the mutant LDLR, may provide tools to develop a mechanistic model of the LDLR function.", 
    "41": "The interaction of atorvastatin with bovine serum albumin (BSA) was investigated using multi-spectroscopic methods and molecular docking technique for providing important insight into further elucidating the store and transport process of atorvastatin in the body and the mechanism of action and pharmacokinetics. The experimental results revealed that the fluorescence quenching mechanism of BSA induced atorvastatin was a combined dynamic and static quenching. The binding constant and number of binding site of atorvastatin with BSA under simulated physiological conditions (pH=7.4) were 1.41 \u00d7 10(5) M(-1) and about 1 at 310K, respectively. The values of the enthalpic change (\u0394H(0)), entropic change (\u0394S(0)) and Gibbs free energy (\u0394G(0)) in the binding process of atorvastatin with BSA at 310K were negative, suggesting that the binding process of atorvastatin and BSA was spontaneous and the main interaction forces were van der Waals force and hydrogen bonding interaction. Moreover, atorvastatin was bound into the subdomain IIA (site I) of BSA, resulting in a slight change of the conformation of BSA.",

    "57": "Thirty-one polygenic hypercholesterolemic subjects were included in this study. Levels of cholesterol and ox-LDL in 3 plasma LDL subfractions and plasma levels of remnant-like particle cholesterol, ox-LDL, and adiponectin were measured after 0, 3, 6, and 12 months of treatment with rosuvastatin. Sequential ultracentrifugation was performed to subfractionate plasma lipoproteins.", 
    "58": "The mean daily dose of rosuvastatin over the 12 months of treatment was 2.9 \u00b1 1.0 mg (mean \u00b1 standard deviation). The cholesterol subfraction distribution was 43 \u00b1 10% as low-density LDL, 46 \u00b1 8% as medium-density LDL, and 13 \u00b1 5% as high-density LDL. Similarly, the distribution of ox-LDL was 31 \u00b1 10% as low-density LDL, 48 \u00b1 7% as medium-density LDL, and 22 \u00b1 8% as high-density LDL. After 12 months of treatment with rosuvastatin, the level of cholesterol was significantly reduced in all 3 subfractions (P < .0001), as was the level of ox-LDL (P < .0001). Furthermore, the plasma cholesterol level in high-density lipoprotein2 increased significantly.", 
    "59": "The distribution of ox-LDL in plasma LDL subfractions was more skewed toward the denser subfractions, compared with cholesterol. Rosuvastatin treatment significantly reduced plasma levels of cholesterol and ox-LDL in all LDL subfractions.",

    "61": "Children with HeFH and fasting LDL-C >4.92 mmol/L (190 mg/dL) or >4.10 mmol/L (>158 mg/dL) with other cardiovascular risk factors received rosuvastatin 5 mg daily. Based on LDL-C targets (<2.85 mmol/L [<110 mg/dL]), rosuvastatin could be uptitrated to 10 mg (aged 6-9 years) or 20 mg (aged 10-17 years). Treatment lasted 2 years. Changes in lipid values, growth, sexual maturation, and adverse events (AEs) were assessed.",

At 24 months, LDL-C was reduced by 43, 45, and 35% vs baseline in patients aged 6-9, 10-13, and 14-17 years, respectively (P < .001 for all groups). Most AEs were mild. Intermittent myalgia was reported in 11 (6%) patients and did not lead to discontinuation of rosuvastatin treatment. Serious AEs were reported by 9 (5%) patients, all considered unrelated to treatment by the investigators. No clinically important changes in hepatic biochemistry were reported. Rosuvastatin treatment did not appear to adversely affect height, weight, or sexual maturation.",

    "65": "Using Finnish health registers, we assembled a cohort of 52\u2009868 statin initiators with diabetes in 1995-2006. We conducted a nested case-control analysis matching cases with IS with up to four controls for age, sex, date of statin initiation and follow-up duration. Adjusted rate ratios for IS were estimated with conditional logistic regression. Additional potential confounders were considered with inverse probability weighting and the role of unmeasured confounding using external adjustment. Statin adherence was measured as the proportion of days covered (PDC).", 
    "66": "Among 1703 cases and 6799 controls, good adherence to statins (PDC\u2009\u2265\u200980%) was associated with a 23% decreased incidence of IS (95%CI 14-32%) compared with poor adherence (PDC\u2009<\u200980%). This association remained broadly unchanged when stratified by sex, age, history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or IS. There was a dose-response relationship between adherence level and the risk of IS (RR 0.63 [0.53-0.75] for PDC\u2009\u2265\u200980% versus PDC\u2009<\u200920%, P for trend <0.0001). Among patients with good adherence, those initiating with low intensity statin therapy had a 15% lower incidence (95%CI 2-27%) and those initiating with moderate intensity therapy a 29% lower incidence (16-41%) of IS compared with those with poor adherence who initiated with low intensity therapy. Our sensitivity analyses supported the robustness of the results.", 
    "67": "In diabetes, poor statin adherence may considerably increase the risk of IS both in primary and secondary prevention of IS.", 
    "68": "Accurate measurement of drug adherence is essential for valid risk-benefit assessments of pharmacologic interventions. To date, measures of drug adherence have almost exclusively been applied for a fixed-time interval and without considering changes over time. However, patients with irregular dosing behaviour commonly have a different prognosis than patients with stable dosing behaviour.", 
    "69": "We propose a method, based on the proportion of days covered (PDC) method, to measure time-varying drug adherence and drug dosage using electronic records. We compare a time-fixed PDC method with the time-varying PDC method through detailed examples and through summary statistics of 100 randomly selected patients on statin therapy.", 
    "70": "We demonstrate that time-varying PDC method better distinguishes an irregularly dosing patient from a stably dosing patient and demonstrate how the time-fixed method can result in a biassed estimate of drug adherence. Furthermore, the time-varying PDC method may be better used to reduce certain types of confounding and misclassification of exposure.",

    "72": "In approximately 80% of cardiovascular disease-related deaths, patients suffer from coronary atherosclerotic heart disease. Ezetimibe is the first intestinal cholesterol absorption inhibitor. Its combination with statins for treating coronary atherosclerotic heart disease has attracted attention worldwide.", 
    "73": "The study group comprised 106 patients with coronary atherosclerotic heart disease and hyperlipidaemia. Each was randomly assigned to one of two groups: (1) Ezetimibe (10mg, once a night) plus rosuvastatin (10mg, once a night) (n=55) or (2) Rosuvastatin alone (10mg, once a night) (n=51). The primary endpoint was new or recurrent myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac death, and stroke. Blood lipid, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) levels were measured before treatment and at one, six and 12 months after treatment. Coronary plaque size and compositional changes were determined using intravascular ultrasonography.", 
    "74": "The combination of ezetimibe plus rosuvastatin decreased total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, hsCRP, IL-6, and MMP-9 levels at six and 12 months after treatment. Statistical significance was detected between two groups. At 12 months, the plaque burden, plaque cross-sectional area, and percentage of necrotic plaque composition were significantly lower in the combination group than in rosuvastatin alone group (P<0.05). And compared with rosuvastatin alone group, the primary endpoint decreased more effectively in combination group.", 
    "75": "The combination of ezetimibe and rosuvastatin apparently diminishes lipid levels and plaque burden and improves plaque stability, which may be associated with the potent inhibitory effects of ezetimibe and rosuvastatin on inflammatory cytokines.", 
    "76": "Guidelines recommend initiating primary prevention with statins to those at highest cardiovascular risk. We assessed the gender-specific implementation and effectiveness of this risk-guided approach.", 
    "77": "We identified 1399 consecutive patients without known cardiovascular disease or diabetes hospitalized with a first myocardial infarction (MI) in Denmark. Statin use before MI was assessed, and cardiovascular risk was calculated using SCORE (Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation).", 
    "78": "Among patients with first MI, 36% were women. Compared with men, they were older (mean 72 vs. 65years) but had a lower estimated risk (median 3.4% vs. 6.7%, SCORE high-risk model in the statin-na\u00efve patients). Statin therapy had been initiated in 12% of women and 10% of men prior to MI. After adding 1.5mmol/L to the total cholesterol concentration of those already on statins, the estimated pre-treatment risk was much lower in women than men (median 3.8% vs. 9.2%, SCORE high-risk model), and only 29% of women would have passed the risk-based treatment threshold defined by the European guidelines (SCORE \u22655%). Estimated risk and statin use correlated directly in men but not in women. Only ~5% of first MI are prevented by the current use of statins in people without diabetes.", 
    "79": "In people destined for a first MI, statin therapy is uncommon and prevents few events. Lower-risk women receive as much statins as higher risk men. This gender disparity and inefficient targeting of statins to those at highest risk indicate that risk scoring is not widely used in routine clinical practice in Denmark.", 
    "80": "In pharmacogenetic research, genetic variation in non-responders and high responders is compared with the aim to identify the genetic loci responsible for this variation in response. However, an important question is whether the non-responders are truly biologically non-responsive or actually non-adherent? Therefore, the aim of this study was to describe, within the PROspective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk (PROSPER), characteristics of both non-responders and high responders of statin treatment in order to possibly discriminate non-responders from non-adherers.", 
    "81": "Baseline characteristics of non-responders to statin therapy (\u226410 % LDL-C reduction) were compared with those of high responders (>40 % LDL-C reduction) through a linear regression analysis. In addition, pharmacogenetic candidate gene analysis was performed to show the effect of excluding non-responders from the analysis.", 
    "82": "Non-responders to statin therapy were younger (p = 0.001), more often smoked (p < 0.001), had a higher alcohol consumption (p < 0.001), had lower LDL cholesterol levels (p < 0.001), had a lower prevalence of hypertension (p < 0.001), and had lower cognitive function (p = 0.035) compared to subjects who highly responded to pravastatin treatment. Moreover, excluding non-responders from pharmacogenetic studies yielded more robust results, as standard errors decreased.", 
    "83": "Our results suggest that non-responders to statin therapy are more likely to actually be non-adherers, since they have more characteristics that are viewed as indicators of high self-perceived health and low disease awareness, possibly making the subjects less adherent to study medication. We suggest that in pharmacogenetic research, extreme non-responders should be excluded to overcome the problem that non-adherence is investigated instead of non-responsiveness.", 
    "84": "Balance between cell growth and proliferation determines cell size homeostasis, but little is known about how metabolic pathways are involved in the maintenance of this balance. Here, we perform a screen with a library of clinically used drug molecules for their effects on cell size. We find that statins, inhibitors of the mevalonate pathway, reduce cell proliferation and increase cell size and cellular protein density in various cell types, including primary human cells. Mevalonate pathway effects on cell size and protein density are mediated through geranylgeranylation of the small GTPase RAB11, which is required for basal autophagic flux. Our results identify the mevalonate pathway as a metabolic regulator of autophagy and expose a paradox in the regulation of cell size and proteostasis, where inhibition of an anabolic pathway can cause an increase in cell size and cellular protein density.", 
    "85": "Cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction are associated with a pro-inflammatory state and reduced NO bioavailability. Effects on myocardial structural and molecular alterations were compared between Waon therapy (WT; repeated dry sauna therapy) and statin in hypertensive rats. Seven-week-old Dahl salt-sensitive rats were assigned to 4 groups: low-salt (LS) diet, high-salt (HS) diet, HS diet with oral fluvastatin (FL; 10\u00a0mg/kg/day for 4\u00a0weeks) starting from the age of 9\u00a0weeks, and HS diet with WT treatment in a far-infrared dry sauna (39\u00a0\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min followed by 34\u00a0\u00b0C for 20\u00a0min once daily for 4\u00a0weeks). HS rats developed left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy with preserved LV systolic function. WT reduced LV wall thickness and myocyte cross-sectional area along with decreased levels of myocardial ANP and BNP mRNA expression compared with HS rats. Reduction in LV fibrosis and increase in capillary density in WT animals were accompanied by reductions in myocardial levels of TGF-\u03b21, MMP2, p22(phox) and gp91(phox) mRNA expression, and increases in myocardial levels of VEGF and HSP90 mRNA and phosphorylated eNOS protein. These effects were comparable between WT and FL animals. WT improves structural and molecular alterations in salt-induced hypertensive rats similarly to fluvastatin.", 
    "86": "Previously, studies have demonstrated that topical application of simvastatin can promote wound healing in diabetic mice via augmentation of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. This study aimed to formulate and characterize simvastatin in alginate-based composite film wound dressings. Biopolymers used for composite films were sodium alginate blended with pectin or gelatin. The films were prepared and characterized based on their physical properties, surface morphology, mechanical strength and rheology. Then, in vitro drug releases from the films were investigated and, finally, the cell viability assay was performed to assess the cytotoxicity profile. From the pre-formulation studies, alginate/pectin composite film showed to possess desirable wound dressing properties and superior mechanical properties. The in vitro drug release profile revealed that alginate/pectin film produced a controlled release drug profile, and cell viability assay showed that the film was non-toxic. In summary, alginate/pectin composite film is suitable to be formulated with simvastatin as a potential wound dressing.", 
    "87": "The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) are the most widely utilized class of cholesterol-lowering agents, carrying multiple indications for both primary and secondary cardiovascular risk reduction. Concern was raised by previously published post hoc analyses and observational studies that noted an increased risk of hemorrhagic stroke in patients receiving a statin. Subsequent studies have demonstrated conflicting results regarding the role of statin therapy on hemorrhagic stroke risk and patient outcomes. New evidence suggests that statins taken prior to or continued during admission for intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) may be associated with positive outcomes. Evidence also suggests deleterious outcomes resulting from the abrupt discontinuation of statins upon hospital admission for multiple disease states including ICH. Conflicting data also exist for the use of statins following aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). Recent evidence suggests statins started during admission for aSAH confer no additional benefit in reducing delayed ischemic neurologic deficits despite initial positive results. Larger scale evaluation of the role of statin therapy following hemorrhagic stroke is warranted. The available literature is reviewed to provide guidance for therapeutic decision making.", 
    "88": "Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) is an important regulator of bone formation. Gain-of-function mutations in the FGFR3 gene result in chondrodysplasias which include achondroplasia (ACH), the most common form of dwarfism, in which skull, appendicular and axial skeletons are affected. The skeletal phenotype of patients with ACH showed defective proliferation and differentiation of the chondrocytes in the growth plate cartilage. Both endochondral and membranous ossification processes are disrupted during development. At cellular level, Fgfr3 mutations induce increased phosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase receptor FGFR3, which correlate with an enhanced activation of its downstream signaling pathways. Potential therapeutic strategies have emerged for ACH. Several preclinical studies have been conducted such as the C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) analog (BMN111), intermittent parathyroid hormone injections, soluble FGFR3 therapy, and meclozine and statin treatments. Among the putative targets to antagonize FGFR3 signaling, CNP (or BMN111) is one of the most promising strategies. BMN111 acts as a key regulator of longitudinal bone growth by downregulating the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, which is activated as a result of a FGFR3 gain-of-function mutation. Preclinical studies showed that BMN111 treatment led to a large improvement in skeletal parameters in Fgfr3Y367C/+ mice mimicking ACH. In 2014, a clinical trial (phase 2) of BMN111 in pediatric patients with ACH has started. This first clinical trial marks the first big step towards real treatment for these patients.", 
    "89": "This prospective, randomized, nonblind, controlled trial evaluated the effects of clopidogrel on platelet function upon coadministration with atorvastatin and lansoprazole. One hundred four adult patients with non-ST-segment elevated acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stent implantation were included. All patients were treated with standard dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) plus rosuvastatin 10 \u200amg daily after the operation. On the sixth day after PCI, patients were randomly divided into 4 groups, Group A: DAPT\u200a+\u200aatorvastatin 20 \u200amg daily (a change from rosuvastatin to atorvastatin)\u200a+\u200alansoprazole 30 \u200amg daily, Group B: DAPT\u200a+\u200aatorvastatin 20\u200a mg daily (a change from rosuvastatin to atorvastatin), Group C: DAPT\u200a+\u200alansoprazole 30\u200a mg daily (continuing to take rosuvastatin), Group D is the control group. Additional drugs were used according to the situation of patients. Platelet function and concentrations of platelet activation markers (granular membrane protein 140 (P-selectin), thromboxane B2 (TXB2), and human soluble cluster of differentiation 40 ligand (sCD40L)) were assessed before randomization and at 15- and 30-day follow-up visits. All patients were maintained on treatment for 6 months and observed for bleeding and ischemic events. A total of 104 patients were enrolled, 27 patients in group A, 26 patients in Group B/C, 25 patients in Group D separately, and all the patients were analyzed. There were no differences in platelet function and the levels of platelet activation markers (P-selectin, TXB2, and sCD40L) among or within the 4 groups at the 3 time points of interest (P\u200a>\u200a0.05). In the subsequent 6 months, no significant bleeding events occurred, and 12 patients experienced ischemic events, these results were also not significantly different among the groups (P\u200a>\u200a0.05). In patients diagnosed with NSTE-ACS who have had drug-eluting stent implantation, simultaneously administering clopidogrel, atorvastatin, and lansoprazole did not decrease the antiplatelet efficacy of clopidogrel or increase adverse event frequency over 6 months.", 
    "90": "Low socioeconomic status (SES) should be a robust predictor of medication nonadherence because it shares key features with the theoretical origins of this phenomenon. However, population-based studies have demonstrated weak associations overall, possibly because SES is inadequately represented. We compared the performance of multiple versus single-domain measures of SES as predictors of statin adherence.", 
    "91": "This retrospective cohort study used population-based administrative data mapped to area-level census information of individuals who received a statin medication following a hospitalization for coronary heart disease. One-year adherence was calculated by dividing the sum of all tablets dispensed by the total number of days in the observation period (365 d following the first statin dispensation). Logistic regression models were constructed and the relative impact of each SES measure was assessed by its adjusted odds ratio (OR) and improvement over the predictive accuracy of a reference model that included non-SES factors only.", 
    "92": "More than two thirds (ie, 68.8%; 6517/9478) of eligible individuals exhibited optimal adherence (ie, \u226580%). The estimated impact of SES on optimal adherence differed depending on the SES measure tested. The highest performing single-domain measure, household income (OR=0.75; 95% confidence interval, 0.63-0.90; model c-statistic improvement 0.5%, P=0.04) generated a similar result to the multiple-domain measure (adjusted OR=0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.62-0.88; model c-statistic improvement 0.7%, P=0.01).",

    "95": "In a framework of developing a new health-economic model for evaluating different screening strategies for primary prevention of CVD in Europe (EPIC-CVD project), we identified seven key modeling issues and reviewed papers published between 2000 and 2013 to assess how they were addressed.", 
    "96": "We found 13 relevant health-economic modeling studies of screening to prevent CVD in primary care. The models varied in their degree of complexity, with between two and 33 health states. Programmes that screen the whole population by a fixed cut-off (e.g., predicted 10-year CVD risk >20\u00a0%) identify predominantly elderly people, who may not be those most likely to benefit from long-term treatment. Uncertainty and model validation were generally poorly addressed. Few studies considered the disutility of taking drugs in otherwise healthy individuals or the budget impact of the programme.", 
    "97": "Model validation, incorporation of parameter uncertainty, and sensitivity analyses for assumptions made are all important components of model building and reporting, and deserve more attention. Complex models may not necessarily give more accurate predictions. Availability of a large enough source dataset to reliably estimate all relevant input parameters is crucial for achieving credible results. Decision criteria should consider budget impact and the medicalization of the population as well as cost-effectiveness thresholds.", 
    "98": "Postprandial atherogenic lipoproteins, characterizing high-risk patients, correlate positively with cardiovascular events. Although the effect of niacin on fasting lipids is well established, its impact on atheroprotective reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) pathway and on functional features of circulating lipoproteins during the postprandial state remains indeterminate.", 
    "99": "We evaluated RCT pathway during postprandial phase in dyslipidemic patients displaying a low high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol phenotype. Ten subjects on stable statin therapy received 1 g/20 mg extended-release niacin/laropiprant (ERN/LRPT) for 4 weeks followed by 2 g/40 mg ERN/LRPT for additional 8 weeks. At each experimental period, postprandial hypertriglyceridemia and major steps of RCT, including cholesterol efflux from human macrophages, cholesteryl ester transfer protein-mediated cholesteryl ester transfer, and hepatic HDL-cholesteryl ester selective uptake were evaluated. Equally, the capacity of postprandial HDL particles isolated from patients before and after ERN/LRPT treatment to mediate RCT to feces was evaluated in vivo in human apolipoprotein B/cholesteryl ester transfer protein double transgenic mouse model. Compared with baseline, ERN/LRPT significantly reduced postprandial hypertriglyceridemia (incremental area under the curve-triglyceride: -53%; P=0.02). Postprandial increase in endogenous plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein activity was completely abolished after ERN/LRPT treatment. Despite a slight reduction in plasma cholesterol efflux capacity from human THP-1 macrophages, evaluation of global RCT efficacy by combining both ex vivo and in vivo approaches indicate that postprandial HDL particles formed under ERN/LRPT therapy displayed a greater capacity for HDL-mediated RCT to feces.", 
    "100": "ERN/LRPT treatment efficiently attenuates atherogenic postprandial lipemia and stimulates HDL-mediated cholesterol return to the liver and elimination into feces during postprandial phase, thus maintaining an efficient removal of cholesterol from the body.",

    "102": "In the Carotid Plaque Composition Study, 126 subjects with a history of cardiovascular disease were randomized to atorvastatin or combination therapy (atorvastatin/niacin). At baseline and after 1 year of treatment, the concentration of HDL and its 3 subclasses (small, medium, and large) were quantified by calibrated ion mobility analysis (HDL-PIMA). We also measured total cholesterol efflux from macrophages and ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1)-specific cholesterol efflux capacity.", 
    "103": "Atorvastatin decreased low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 39% and raised HDL-C by 11% (P=0.0001) but did not increase HDL-PIMA or macrophage cholesterol efflux. Combination therapy raised HDL-C by 39% (P<0.0001) but increased HDL-PIMA by only 14%. Triglyceride levels did not correlate with HDL-PIMA (P=0.39), in contrast to their strongly negative correlation with HDL-C (P<0.0001). Combination therapy increased macrophage cholesterol efflux capacity (16%, P<0.0001) but not ABCA1-specific efflux. ABCA1-specific cholesterol efflux capacity decreased significantly (P=0.013) in statin-treated subjects, with or without niacin therapy.", 
    "104": "Statin therapy increased HDL-C levels but failed to increase HDL-PIMA. It also reduced ABCA1-specific cholesterol efflux capacity. Adding niacin to statin therapy increased HDL-C and macrophage efflux, but had much less effect on HDL-PIMA. It also failed to improve ABCA1-specific efflux, a key cholesterol exporter in macrophages. Our observations raise the possibility that niacin might not target the relevant atheroprotective population of HDL.",

    "106": "Twenty-month-old, normal female Wistar rats were divided into three groups: group A (n=8) was fed high-dose AVT (10mg/kg/d); group B (n=8) was fed low-dose AVT (1mg/kg/d); and group C (controls, n=8) received the same volume of normal saline; 3-month-old, normal female Wistar rats served as young normal controls (n=8). All rats were sacrificed following a 4-month treatment period. Serum creatinine and blood lipid levels were measured. The glomerular sclerosis index and tubulointerstitial lesions were determined using renal periodic acid-Schiff-stained paraffin sections. The mRNA and protein expressions of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-9 and -2, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 and -2, transforming growth factor-\u03b21 (TGF-\u03b21), and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) were examined using reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions and Western blots, respectively.", 
    "107": "Serum lipid (including serum cholesterol and serum triglycerides) levels in aged rats were significantly higher than those in young rats (p<0.05). Compared to the aged control group, high-dose AVT was associated with significantly lower serum total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in aged rats (p<0.05); low-dose AVT was associated only with lower serum LDL-C levels (p<0.05). Renal morphological changes in aged rats included focal glomerulosclerosis, infiltration of inflammatory cells, and arteriole sclerosis. Improved renal pathology was observed in aged, AVT-treated rats, and included a decreased glomerular sclerosis index and tubulointerstitial lesion score, especially in those receiving high-dose AVT. Additionally, renal artery wall thickening, luminal narrowing, and arteriolosclerosis were significantly less severe in aged rats receiving high-dose AVT. Upregulated expression of MMP-9 and TGF-\u03b21 was observed in the renal tissue of aged rats. AVT treatment was associated with a reversal of these phenomena and upregulated expression of TIMP-1, PPAR\u03b1, PPAR\u03b2, and PPAR\u03b3 in aged rats.", 
    "108": "AVT improved the renal pathology of aged rats. These effects may have been induced by the lowering of blood lipids, maintaining the MMP/TIMP balance, and downregulating the expression of TGF-\u03b21. AVT may reduce the levels of MMP-9 and TGF-\u03b2 in aged rats by upregulating the expression of PPARs.", 
    "109": "In order to achieve better in-vivo performance of the final dosage form comprising a poorly soluble drug the physicochemical properties of the active pharmaceutical ingredient can be altered not only by changing the solid state form but also through the conversion of their crystal habits. To elucidate this approach in the case of simvastatin, the dissolution behaviour of large crystals with the same internal structure but expressing different crystal habits was studied using atomic force microscope. The obtained differences in the dissolution were explained through the determination of crystal morphology its orientation and assignation of the molecular functional groups that were emerging on the surface of the dissolving crystal face. The dissolution rates of the particular crystal faces were found to be distinctly higher than others. The dissolution rate of single crystals differed as a consequence of higher incidence of more polar faces in case of rod shaped crystals isolated from more hydrophilic solvent mixture which we have established through a thorough research of the single crystal morphology, orientation and the assignation of specific functional groups for each of evolved crystal faces.", 
    "110": "Hypertriglyceridemia is an important marker of increased levels of highly atherogenic remnant-like particles. The importance of lowering plasma levels of triglycerides (TG) has been called into question many times, but currently it is considered an integral part of residual cardiovascular risk reduction strategies. Lifestyle changes (improved diet and increased physical activity) are effective TG lowering measures. Pharmacological treatment usually starts with statins, although associated TG reductions are typically modest. Fibrates are currently the drugs of choice for hyperTG, frequently in combination with statins. Niacin and omega-3 fatty acids improve control of triglyceride levels when the above measures are inadequately effective. Some novel therapies including anti-sense oligonucleotides and inhibitors of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein have shown significant TG lowering efficacy.

The summary adjusted hazard ratio per standard deviation of total cholesterol (TC) to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ratio was 1.25 (95% confidence interval 1.15 to 1.35) for CVD in a primary prevention population but heterogeneity was high (I(2)\u2009=\u200998%); similar results were observed for non-HDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B and other ratio measures. Associations were smaller for other single lipid measures. Across 10 trials, low-dose atorvastatin (10 and 20\u2009mg) effects ranged from a TC reduction of 0.92\u2009mmol/l to 2.07\u2009mmol/l, and low-density lipoprotein reduction of between 0.88\u2009mmol/l and 1.86\u2009mmol/l. Effects of 40\u2009mg and 80\u2009mg were reported by one trial each. For primary prevention, over a 3-year period, we estimate annual monitoring would unnecessarily treat 9 per 1000 more men (28 vs. 19 per 1000) and 5 per 1000 more women (17 vs. 12 per 1000) than monitoring every 3 years. However, annual monitoring would also undertreat 9 per 1000 fewer men (7 vs. 16 per 1000) and 4 per 1000 fewer women (7 vs. 11 per 1000) than monitoring at 3-year intervals. For secondary prevention, over a 3-year period, annual monitoring would increase unnecessary treatment changes by 66 per 1000 men and 31 per 1000 women, and decrease undertreatment by 29 per 1000 men and 28 per 1000 men, compared with monitoring every 3 years.

A retrospective cohort study was conducted. Patient demographic data, statin use, sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores, vasopressor requirements, ventilator days, length of SICU stay, and mortality in septic patients were collected.

In our previous study, a significant decline in ZO-1 was observed along with enhanced MMP-9 activity in the duodenum and distal colon of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-intoxicated mice. In this study, the protective effect of simvastatin on ZO-1 was investigated using an MPTP mouse model of PD. Seven days after the end of MPTP application, the expression level of ZO-1 was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The protein expression levels of ZO-1 and MMP9 were detected by Western blotting. Meanwhile, MMP-9 activity was analyzed by gelatin zymography. MPTP treatment led to a decrease in the expression of ZO-1, which was accompanied by elevated MMP-9 activity. Treatment with simvastatin could partly reverse the MPTP-induced changes in ZO-1 expression and reduce MMP-9 protein and activity.

In vitro research indicates that statins potentially impair \u03b2-cell function and decrease insulin sensitivity but how these findings relate to patients is unknown. In the clinic, statins should be prescribed on the basis of CVD risk and individual patient characteristics.

The tissue characteristics of target coronary plaque in each patient were analyzed using IB-IVUS before and after treatment. We also measured plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines sampled in the coronary sinus (CS) and peripheral vein.A significant reduction in lipid volume (18.5 \u00b1 1.3 to 15.0 \u00b1 1.5 mm(3), P=0.007) and a significant increase in fibrous volume (22.9 \u00b1 0.8 to 25.6 \u00b1 1.1 mm(3), P=0.01) were observed in IB-IVUS image analyses in the EPA group, but no significant changes in the plaque components in the control group.

After 8 weeks of treatment, body weight, adipose tissue and liver mass were measured, and liver and plasma lipid levels were determined to evaluate to effect of FSE with or without AS treatment on diet-induced obesity, hyperlipidemia and hepatic steatosis. Liver enzyme activities, anti-oxidative status and membrane permeability transition were also assessed to determine if FSE could reduce the side effects induced by AS.",

However, FSE supplementation exerted no further beneficial effect on diet-induced metabolic syndrome when it is combined with AS treatment, compared with rats given AS-treatment alone. At the dose of 0.45%, dietary FSE supplementation resulted in: (a) reduced liver enzymes (ALT and AST) levels; (b) reduced macrophage infiltration (CD68); (c) improved liver glutathione levels (anti-oxidative status); (d) reduced liver reactive oxidative species; (e) a trend to reduce calcium-induced membrane permeability transition within the liver. Most importantly, these improvements induced by FSE treatment were not only observed in the livers of rats given high-fat-diet, but also in high-fat-fed rats with atorvastatin-induced hepatotoxicity.",

    "199": "Early initiation of statin therapy in acute coronary syndrome patients has a favorable prognostic impact because of its anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic properties. In this study, we explored the effect of atorvastatin-loading, followed by intensive atorvastatin therapy, on clinical and biochemical outcomes in non-ST-segment-elevation acute coronary syndrome patients who were scheduled for percutaneous coronary intervention. We prospectively enrolled 140 patients (mean age, 56 \u00b1 9 years, 68% men). Once eligible, patients were randomly assigned to receive either a moderate 20-mg daily dose of atorvastatin (Group A) or a 160-mg loading dose followed by an intensified 80-mg daily dose (Group B). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels were recorded before and after intervention. Evaluation after 6 months included hs-CRP levels, left ventricular systolic function, and major adverse cardiac events. We found no significant difference between the 2 groups in regard to the interventional data. However, blood sampling after coronary intervention, and again 6 months later, revealed a significant decline in mean hs-CRP level among Group B patients (P < 0.001). Moreover, patients in Group B manifested a higher left ventricular ejection fraction than did patients in Group A (P < 0.05). After 6 months, we found no significant difference between groups in the incidence of major adverse cardiac events. We conclude that intensive atorvastatin therapy in non-ST-segment-elevation acute coronary syndrome patients is associated with lower hs-CRP levels and with higher left ventricular ejection fraction after 6 months, with no significant impact on adverse cardiac events.", 
    "200": "Most allogenic bone graft substitutes have only osteoconductive properties. Developing new strategies to improve the osteoinductive activity of bone graft substitutes is both critical and practical for clinical application. Previously, we developed novel simvastatin-encapsulating poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres (SIM/PLGA) that slowly release simvastatin and enhance fracture healing. In this study, we combined SIM/PLGA with a rapidly absorbable calcium sulfate (CS) bone substitute and studied the effect on bone healing in critical-sized calvarial bone defects in a rat model. The cytotoxicity and cytocompatibility of this combination was tested in vitro using lactate dehydrogenase leakage and a cell attachment assay, respectively. Combination treatment with SIM/PLGA and the CS bone substitute had no cytotoxic effect on bone marrow stem cells. Compared with the control, cell adhesion was substantially enhanced following combination treatment with SIM/PLGA and the CS bone substitute. In vivo, implantation of the combination bone substitute promoted healing of critical-sized calvarial bone defects in rats; furthermore, production of bone morphogenetic protein-2 and neovascularization were enhanced in the area of the defect. In summary, the combination of SIM/PLGA and a CS bone substitute has osteoconductive and osteoinductive properties, indicating that it could be used for regeneration of bone in the clinical setting.", 
    "201": "Adequate membrane fluidity is required for a variety of key cellular processes and in particular for proper function of membrane proteins. In most eukaryotic cells, membrane fluidity is known to be regulated by fatty acid desaturation and cholesterol, although some cells, such as insect cells, are almost devoid of sterol synthesis. We show here that insect and mammalian cells present similar microviscosity at their respective physiological temperature. To investigate how both sterols and phospholipids control fluidity homeostasis, we quantified the lipidic composition of insect SF9 and mammalian HEK 293T cells under normal or sterol-modified condition. As expected, insect cells show minimal sterols compared with mammalian cells. A major difference is also observed in phospholipid content as the ratio of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) to phosphatidylcholine (PC) is inverted (4 times higher in SF9 cells). In vitro studies in liposomes confirm that both cholesterol and PE can increase rigidity of the bilayer, suggesting that both can be used by cells to maintain membrane fluidity. We then show that exogenously increasing the cholesterol amount in SF9 membranes leads to a significant decrease in PE:PC ratio whereas decreasing cholesterol in HEK 293T cells using statin treatment leads to an increase in the PE:PC ratio. In all cases, the membrane fluidity is maintained, indicating that both cell types combine regulation by sterols and phospholipids to control proper membrane fluidity.",

Simvastatin, an HMG-coA reductase inhibitor, is known to attenuate inflammation and prevent certain cancers. Here, we show that simvastatin decreases the SASP of senescent human fibroblasts by inhibiting protein prenylation, without affecting the senescent growth arrest. The Rho family GTPases Rac1 and Cdc42 were activated in senescent cells, and simvastatin reduced both activities. Further, geranylgeranyl transferase, Rac1 or Cdc42 depletion reduced IL-6 secretion by senescent cells. We also show that simvastatin mitigates the effects of senescent conditioned media on breast cancer cell proliferation and endocrine resistance. Our findings identify a novel activity of simvastatin and mechanism of SASP regulation. They also suggest that senescent cells, which accumulate after radio/chemo therapy, promote endocrine resistance in breast cancer and that simvastatin might suppress this resistance.",

Expected lipoprotein changes with statins on the background of modern antiretroviral therapy are similar to the general population. In addition to lipids, the statin benefit may be mediated in part by improvements in vascular inflammation and levels of T-cell and monocyte activation. One concern is the potential for rosuvastatin to cause insulin resistance. Decisions to prescribe statins must be done in the context of global risk assessment, but traditional risk calculators such as the Framingham Risk Score or the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association pooled-risk equations underestimate risk in this population.

The clinical practice guidelines recommend the use of high-intensity statins to lower LDL-cholesterol by at least 50% in patients with CVD and those at high cardiovascular risk. The recommendations for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia by the ACC/AHA have led to a paradigm shift in cardiovascular prevention. These recommendations have abandoned the therapeutic goals of LDL-cholesterol, and recommend the treatment with statins of high or moderate intensity in four high cardiovascular risk groups. These recommendations are different from the European guidelines on cardiovascular disease prevention, in which their objectives are still towards LDL-cholesterol. This paper reviews this controversy from different angles and from the perspective of the Spanish Interdisciplinary Committee for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention. Intervention studies with high intensity statins in primary prevention, in patients with acute coronary syndrome, and with stable ischaemic heart disease are also described. Likewise, treatment with statins of high intensity is addressed in terms of their effectiveness in cardiovascular prevention and in terms of their safety, with particular attention to muscle effects, as well as taking into account the pharmacological characteristics of the different statins and the increased safety of those with less potential for interactions. Finally, new agents are described for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia, with special emphasis on anti-PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies, a new therapeutic group for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia that will offer a huge progress in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.",

After adjusting for confounders, high statin users had 52% lower risk of developing graft loss (HR 0.48, 95% CI 0.29-0.80) and a nonstatistically significant reduction in death (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.23-1.06) compared to low statin users. Acute rejection was not significantly influenced by statin use (HR 0.77 95% CI 0.46-1.27). There was a significant interaction between race and statin therapy for death (P\u200a=\u200a0.007), but not for graft loss (P\u200a=\u200a0.121) or rejection (P\u200a=\u200a0.605). After stratifying by race, high statin use reduced the risk of death in AAs (HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.20-0.94), but not in non-AAs (HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.49-2.44).High statin use reduces the risk of graft loss in RTx, with a mortality benefit in AAs compared to non-AA, despite similar LDL levels. These results suggest a compelling reason to optimize statin therapy in renal transplant recipients (RTR), especially in AAs.",

    "240": "Some process standards were not met. Patients with a current cholesterol measurement >5 mmol/L were less likely to have a current statin prescription (adjusted OR=3.10; 95% CI 2.70 to 3.56). They were more likely to have clustering of other CVD risk factors. Women were significantly more likely to have raised cholesterol after adjustment for other factors (adjusted OR=1.74; 95% CI 1.53 to 1.98).", 
    "241": "In this study, the key factor that explained poor lipid control in people with CVD was having no current prescription record of a statin. Women were more likely to have poorly controlled cholesterol (independent of comorbid risk factors and after adjusting for age, ethnicity, deprivation index and practice-level variation). Women with CVD should be offered statin prescription and may require higher statin dosage for improved control.", 
    "242": "Statins are one of the most popular lipid-lowering drugs (LLDs). Upon oral administration, these drugs are well absorbed by the intestine and effectively used for the treatment of dyslipidemias. Recently, statins are becoming also well-known for their cholesterol-independent effects and their potential use in brain diseases and different types of cancers. While still controversial, recent research has suggested that statin's cholesterol-independent activities work possibly through alterations on isoprenoid levels. This reduction of isoprenoids in the central nervous system might result in effective biochemical and behavioral improvements on certain neurological disorders. This manuscript aims to highlight current research describing the use of statin therapy in the brain and discuss whether statins might affect neuronal dynamics and function independently of their cholesterol regulatory role.", 
    "243": "Perioperative medical management of patients undergoing carotid, aortic, or peripheral arterial procedures, both open and endovascular, should be optimized in all cases to achieve excellent outcomes. This particular patient population is often plagued with multiple comorbidities, primarily of the cardiovascular system, but frequently involving other systems. For this reason, management of these comorbidities is complex and should be carefully addressed in every patient throughout the surgical encounter, in many cases through a multidisciplinary approach. Most recently, the perioperative use of statins, antiplatelet agents, and \u03b2-blockers have been scrutinized in the literature specifically targeting peripheral vascular disease patients, and results have sometimes been conflicting. The objective of this review is to summarize current available evidence regarding optimal perioperative medical management of patients undergoing arterial vascular surgical procedures, open and endovascular.", 
    "244": "Due to the high prevalence of cardiovascular diseases and the corresponding prescription of cardiac drugs, side effects and interactions may occur in a substantial number of patients. They can be explained by either pharmacokinetic or pharmaco-dynamic drug interactions which may be desired, but may also be life-threatening. Despite the fact that the novel oral anticoagulants are well tolerated, several factors restricting the use of these drugs, such as renal failure, have to be considered. The use of antihypertensive drugs may be limited by concomitant use of drugs that either induce of inhibit enzymatic metabolism, respectively inhibit renal drug, electrolyte, and/or water excretion. In this respect, the interaction between beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and thiazide diuretics with non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs is especially important. Muscle disorders are frequent side effects in patients undergoing statin therapy and affect up to 5% of patients. They may manifest as mild myalgia, but also as life-threatening rhabdomyolysis.", 
    "245": "The purpose of this study was to explore the ten-year trends in utilization of bioequivalent doses of statin amongst elderly patients with diabetes according to sex/gender in Ontario, Canada.", 
    "246": "A cohort of patients with diabetes (>65 years) was constructed using the Ontario Diabetes Database Statin utilization data (2003-2012) was obtained from the Ontario Drug Benefit Program for both women and men. Bioequivalent doses for statins were calculated according to the dosing conversion factor in therapeutic interchange programs in clinical practice. Utilization pattern of high potency (Atorvastatin and Rosuvastatin) vs. low potency statins (Simvastatin, Lovastatin, Fluvastatin, Pravastatin) were also analyzed.", 
    "247": "The average bioequivalent Simvastatin utilization in 2003 was 29.22 mg/day for women and 30.35 mg/day for men. By 2008, this gap in dosing was higher for both women and men and by 2013 it had increased to 47.75 mg/day for women and 52.98 mg/day for men. For average number of day supply per year, there was no significant trend of changes over the 10-year period, although the use of high potency statins increased significantly (P<0.001) for both women and men. No differences were seen for sex/gender; either for the 10-year period or for each year.", 
    "248": "There has been significant increase in bioequivalent statin utilization amongst elderly patients with diabetes in Ontario; for both men and women. In a publicly-funded healthcare system such as Ontario, there were no sex/gender differences in the utilization of high potency statin (Atorvastatin and Rosuvastatin) amongst elderly patient with diabetes.", 
    "249": "We reviewed the current and potential future management of dyslipidemia in patients with diabetes, with a focus on reduction of risk for macrovascular disease. We considered novel dyslipidemia therapies, in particular, inhibitors of proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK9), which have been approved in Canada for reducing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in certain patient groups. We searched for English-language randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of lipid-lowering modalities, mainly since 2012, that included patients with diabetes. The results from some RCTs may have future impacts on the approach to patients with diabetes. In particular, ezetimibe added to statins in the context of acute coronary syndromes seems to have particular benefits in patients with diabetes. Also, patients with diabetes show no differences, so far, from patients without diabetes with respect to efficacy of PCSK9 inhibitors in LDL cholesterol reduction and also in the frequency of adverse effects. RCTs of clinical outcomes with PCSK9 inhibitors performed exclusively in patients with diabetes are desirable, but approval of these agents for use in Canada has occurred before the availability of such results. Clinicians will have to gauge whether certain subjects with diabetes might benefit from this therapy, such as those with superimposed familial dyslipidemia, those with recurrent cardiovascular events and recalcitrant LDL cholesterol levels despite maximally tolerated statin therapy and those with high cardiovascular risk who cannot tolerate any dose of statins.", 
    "250": "This study was designed to investigate the plasma level of soluble ST2 (sST2) and related influencing factors, and establish its reference value in the healthy community-based population in Beijing area of China.", 
    "251": "We measured plasma sST2 level by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay between March 2012 and August 2012 in 1 334 healthy subjects in communities, including 597 males and 737 females. Empiric and quantile regression methods were used to determine the reference range of plasma sST2. A multiple linear regression model was established to analyze the factors that might affect the level of plasma sST2.", 
    "252": "Gender is the most important factor affecting the plasma level of sST2 in healthy people. Plasma level of sST2 is significantly higher in men than in women (P < 0.01). Within each age strata, i.e. < 45, 45-54, 55-64, \u2265 65 years old, the plasma levels of sST2 were significantly higher in men than age-matched female (all P < 0.01). Age, body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and smoking did not affect plasma sST2 level. Reference range of sST2 was 5.7-53.5 \u00b5g/L for men and 4.4-42.4 \u00b5g/L for women (95% nonparametric reference interval). The one-side upper 95th percentile value of sST2 to discriminate the cardiovascular disease from healthy state was 47.2 \u00b5g/L for men and 37.2 \u00b5g/L for women.",
