The statins available in Malaysia include atorvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, simvastatin, and fluvastatin. Over the years, they have accumulated in the National Drug Formulary; hence, the need for review. Effective selection of the best drugs to remain in the formulary can become complex due to the multiple drug attributes involved, and is made worse by the limited time and resources available. The multiattribute scoring tool (MAST) systematizes the evaluation of the drug attributes to facilitate the drug selection process. In this study, a MAST framework was developed to rank the statins based on their utilities or benefits.", 
    "6": "Published literature on multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) were studied and five sessions of expert group discussions were conducted to build the MAST framework and to review the evidence. The attributes identified and selected for analysis were efficacy (clinical efficacy, clinical endpoints), safety (drug interactions, serious side effects and documentation), drug applicability (drug strength/formulation, indications, dose frequency, side effects, food-drug interactions, and dose adjustments), and cost. The average weights assigned by the members for efficacy, safety, drug applicability and cost were 32.6%, 26.2%, 24.1%, and 17.1%, respectively. The utility values of the attributes were scored based on the published evidence or/and agreements during the group discussions. The attribute scores were added up to provide the total utility score.", 
    "7": "Using the MAST, the six statins under review were successfully scored and ranked. Atorvastatin scored the highest total utility score (TUS) of 84.48, followed by simvastatin (83.11). Atorvastatin and simvastatin scored consistently high, even before drug costs were included. The low scores on the side effects for atorvastatin were compensated for by the higher scores on the clinical endpoints resulting in a higher TUS for atorvastatin. Fluvastatin recorded the lowest TUS.",

The efficacy and safety of statins in primary and secondary prevention of CHD is confirmed in several large studies, and rosuvastatin is the latest statin on market. We review the published literature on rosuvastatin in Chinese people. The pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin in Chinese is somewhat different from that in Caucasians, but this does not influence the linear relationship between dosage and efficacy and with no drug accumulation. Rosuvastatin 5-20 mg/day is effective and safe in decreasing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in both younger and elderly patients with hypercholesterolemia, even in very elderly patients. Rosuvastatin also shows anti-inflammatory and anti-atherosclerosis features, such as reducing carotid intima-media thickness and plaque area. Rosuvastatin can also improve the prognosis of Chinese CHD patients, such as in the case of acute myocardial infarction. Its adverse-event rate is low and comparable to other statins. In conclusion, rosuvastatin is effective and safe for younger or elderly Chinese patients.",

    "11": "The case subjects were 2535 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with an average duration of 14 years, 1891 of whom had kidney disease and 1218 with retinopathy. The case subjects were matched for diabetes mellitus duration, age, sex, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to 3683 control subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus who did not have kidney disease or retinopathy. The study was conducted in 24 sites in 13 countries. The primary analysis included kidney disease and retinopathy cases. Matched analysis was performed by use of site-specific conditional logistic regression in multivariable models that adjusted for hemoglobin A1c, hypertension, and statin treatment. Mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration was 2.3 mmol/L. The microvascular disease odds ratio increased by a factor of 1.16 (95% confidence interval, 1.11-1.22) for every 0.5 mmol/L (\u22481 quintile) increase in triglycerides or decreased by a factor of 0.92 (0.88-0.96) for every 0.2 mmol/L (\u22481 quintile) increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. For kidney disease, the odds ratio increased by 1.23 (1.16-1.31) with triglycerides and decreased by 0.86 (0.82-0.91) with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Retinopathy was associated with triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in matched analysis but not significantly after additional adjustment.", 
    "12": "Diabetic kidney disease is associated worldwide with higher levels of plasma triglycerides and lower levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol among patients with good control of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Retinopathy was less robustly associated with these lipids. These results strengthen the rationale for studying dyslipidemia treatment to prevent diabetic microvascular disease.", 
    "13": "Studies in recent years have shown a positive relationship between metabolic syndrome (MS) and periodontal disease (PD). Given that patients with MS take statins to reduce cholesterol, and statins also have anti-inflammatory effects, it is important to determine if statin intake hinders the progression of MS-associated PD. In this study, PD was induced in Zucker fat rats (ZFRs), an animal model for MS, and in control lean rats by periodontal injection of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans lipopolysaccharide (LPS), while simvastatin was given to some of the rats via gavage. After 4 wk of treatment, alveolar bone loss was determined by micro-computed tomography. To explore the underlying mechanisms, we determined the effect of simvastatin on tissue inflammation and the expression of molecules involved in osteoclastogenesis. Results showed that while bone loss was increased by LPS in both ZFRs and the control lean rats, it was significantly more in the former than the latter. Simvastatin effectively alleviated bone loss in both ZFRs and the control rats. Results also showed that LPS stimulated leukocyte tissue infiltration and expression of molecules for osteoclastogenesis, but simvastatin significantly modulated the stimulation. This study demonstrated that simvastatin inhibited LPS-induced alveolar bone loss and periodontal tissue inflammation in rats with MS.", 
    "14": "The association between liver cirrhosis (LC) and diabetes mellitus (DM) is well known. However, the impact of the severity or etiology of LC on the occurrence of DM is relatively unknown. We aimed to determine the prevalence and clinical correlates of DM in a large cohort of patients with cirrhosis. A total of 1,068 patients with LC were included in this cross sectional study (CIRCE study). The diagnosis of cirrhosis irrespective of its etiology was based on histological confirmation by liver biopsy or, in the absence of biopsy, on typical clinical, morphological and biological data. Data related to the cirrhosis etiology: alcohol, viral markers of hepatitis B, C, iron load parameters and autoimmune markers were collected for each patient. Venous blood samples were taken in the morning after 12-h overnight fasting. There were 383 patients with cirrhosis associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). DM was found in 412 (39.7\u00a0%) patients. Patients with DM were older and more likely to be overweight and male, with a family history of DM and a diagnosis of HCC. DM was not associated with a history of stroke or myocardial infarction. Cirrhosis secondary to hepatitis infection was less strongly associated with DM than with NASH or alcoholic cirrhosis. The severity of LC was not associated with DM. In multivariate analysis, the factors associated with DM were age, BMI, a family history of DM, and statin use. There was a significant interaction between HCC and cirrhosis etiology for the risk of DM. Cirrhosis secondary to hepatitis was associated with a lesser presence of DM only in patients with HCC (interaction p\u00a0=\u00a00.0015). LC was strongly associated with DM, with around 40\u00a0% of diabetic patients. In the group of patients with LC without HCC, diabetes was not associated with the etiology of cirrhosis.", 
    "15": "Pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive and fatal lung disorder with high mortality rate. To date, despite the fact that extensive research trials are ongoing, pulmonary fibrosis continues to have a poor response to available medical therapy. Statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, known for its broad pharmacological activities, remains a remedy against multiple diseases. The present study investigated the antifibrotic potential of atorvastatin against bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis and to further explore the possible underlying mechanisms. Our results showed that atorvastatin administration significantly ameliorated the bleomycin mediated histological alterations and blocked collagen deposition with parallel reduction in the hydroxyproline level. Atorvastatin reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) level and lung indices. Atorvastatin also markedly decreased the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in lung tissues and, thus, prevented nitric oxide (NO) release in response to bleomycin challenge. Furthermore, atorvastatin exhibited target down-regulation of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF (CCN2)) and phosphorylation extracellular regulated protein kinases (p-ERK) expression. Taken together, atorvastatin significantly ameliorated bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in rats, via the inhibition of iNOS expression and the CTGF (CCN2)/ERK signaling pathway. The present study provides evidence that atorvastatin may be a potential therapeutic reagent for the treatment of lung fibrosis.",

These conditions are common in the HIV-infected population as a result of ageing and the increased risk associated with both HIV infection and antiretroviral intake.", 
    "17": "Ageing is related to slowdown/breakdown of the somatotropic axis (i.e. the somatopause) leading to many physiological changes. The somatopause is accompanied by DNA and other macromolecule damage, and is characterized by a progressive decline in vitality and tissue function. We still do not have a definitive understanding of the mechanism( s) of ageing. Several overlapping theories have been proposed such as: 1) The free radical theory, 2) Mitochondrial Ageing, 3) The Glycation Theory, 4) Protein Damage and Maintenance in Ageing, and, 5) DNA Damage and Repair. Furthermore, several models of ageing were introduced such as genetically programmed senescence, telomere shortening, genomic instability, heterochromatin loss, altered epigenetic patterns and long lived cells. There are certain lipid modifications associated with the somatopause, characterized mainly by an increase in total cholesterol and triglyceride levels in both genders. In this review we consider the mechanisms of ageing and the associated changes in lipid metabolism according to gender.",

Mean (\u00b1 standard deviation [SD]) CDU scans per person was 4.6 (\u00b1 1.4). All were conducted by the same technologist using a standard protocol on the same machine. Aneurysm sac change in centimeters and percentage terms was calculated. The presence or absence of an endoleak was also recorded. Change in aneurysm sac size was correlated with preoperative risk factors.", 
    "20": "Mean sac size change at 1 month was a decrease of 0.24 cm, equating to a percentage change of 4.3%. At 7 months, the decrease was 0.59 cm (9.8%), at 12 months, 0.73 cm (12.4%), at 18 months 0.92 cm (15.8%), and at 36 months 1.0 cm (16.6%). Both univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that statin therapy (P = .002) was the only risk factor variable positively associated with aneurysm regression while the presence of an endoleak was inversely related to sac reduction (P = .01).", 
    "21": "Maximum aneurysmal sac reduction seems to occur in the first year following endograft implantation. Statin therapy appears to be associated with an increased likelihood of sac regression following EVAR. Further investigation of the role of statins in the biology of abdominal aortic aneurysmal disease is warranted.", 
    "22": "While statin intake has been proven to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC), the mechanism of antitumor effects and clinical significance in survival benefits remain unclear. Statin-induced antiproliferative effects and its underlying mechanism were examined using six CRC cell lines. Statins except pravastatin showed antiproliferative effects (simvastatin \u2265 fluvastatin > atorvastatin) even though both of simvastatin and pravastatin could activate mevalonate pathways, suggesting the statin-mediated antiproliferative effects depended on non-mevalonate pathway. Indeed, statin induced p27(KIP1) expression by downregulation of histone methyltransferase enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), which acts as an epigenetic gene silencer. Additionally, the use of simvastatin plus classII histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor (MC1568) induced further overexpression of p27(KIP1) by inhibiting HDAC5 induction originated from downregulated EZH2 in CRC cells and synergistically led to considerable antiproliferative effects. In the clinical setting, Statin intake (except pravastatin) displayed the downregulated EZH2 expression and inversely upregulated p27(KIP1) expression in the resected CRC by immunohistochemical staining and resulted in the significantly better prognoses both in overall survival (p = 0.02) and disease free survival (p < 0.01) compared to patients without statin intake. Statins may inhibit tumor progression via an EZH2-mediated epigenetic alteration, which results in survival benefits after resected CRC. Furthermore, statin plus classII HDAC inhibitor could be a novel anticancer therapy by their synergistic effects in CRC.",

Thirty-six healthy male and female volunteers were enrolled in the study receiving a single oral dose of niacin extended-release/simvastatin 1,000/20\u00a0mg. The results indicated that the systemic exposure of simvastatin hydroxy acid and the total urine excretion of niacin were significantly higher for females compared with those for males, and the T max of niacin in plasma was significantly shorter for males than that for females. There were no significant differences in the systemic exposure of simvastatin, niacin, and NUA in plasma between males and females.", 
    "24": "The effect of silymarin (SMN) on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin in diabetic rats was evaluated. Male Wistar rats were assigned into two major groups and then sub-grouped according to the purposes of the study. The first major group was subdivided into three groups (n\u00a0=\u00a06) including control, non-treated diabetic and SMN-treated diabetic animals. In the first major group, metabolism of testosterone by the hepatic microsomes was studied. The second major group also was divided to three groups including atorvastatin-treated non-diabetic, atorvastatin-treated diabetic and diabetic animals which received both atorvastatin and SMN. To study the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, serum samples were collected at 0, 3, 6, 12 and 24\u00a0h after the atorvastatin administration. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using non-compartmental model. Streptozotocin-induced diabetes resulted in a remarkable induction of testosterone hydroxylation as the V max for 6\u03b2-hydroxytestosterone production in the diabetic rats (77.3\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.6\u00a0pM/min/mg) was significantly higher than that in the control animals (45.9\u00a0\u00b1\u00a05.9\u00a0pM/min/mg). Moreover, SMN-treated animals showed a significant (P\u00a0<\u00a00.05) reduction of V max (59.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a06.1\u00a0pM/min/mg). Diabetes resulted in a significant reduction of AUC (control 6.98\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.58 vs diabetic rats 4.35\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.24\u00a0h\u00a0mg/ml) and C max values (control 0.52\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03 vs diabetic group 0.33\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.01\u00a0\u03bcg/ml), while the SMN-received group showed remarkable recovery of diabetes-reduced values of AUC and C max. These findings indicated that diabetes resulted in a significant up-regulation of microsomal enzyme activities. Moreover, as SMN could significantly regulate the enzyme activities and consequently the atorvastatin pharmacokinetics in diabetic rats, its regulative effect in a combination therapy is concluded.",

CD45-/133+/34+, CD45-/CD34+/kinase insert domain receptor (KDR)+, and CD45-/CD144+/KDR+ EPCs in the peripheral blood were determined by flow cytometry 1 hour before as well as 1 hour, 6 hours, and 24 hours after PCI. Soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM-1), hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hCRP), and troponin-I (TnI) serum concentrations were analyzed immediately prior to and 24 hours after PCI.", 
    "27": "In the 40mg Atorvastatin and control groups, none of the analyzed EPC blood concentrations changed significantly from 1h before operation to 1h and 6 h postoperative values. In contrast, the number of circulating early differentiation stage EPCs CD45-/133+/34+ and CD45-/CD34+/ KDR+ raised significantly from 1 h preoperative values (57.3\u00b19.3; 57.3 \u00b1 10.7) to 1 h postoperative ((74.4 \u00b1 11.4; 78.8 \u00b1 16.2), (p < 0.05)) and 6 h postoperative ((93 \u00b1 16.9; 99.7 \u00b1 11.9), (p < 0.05)) concentrations after coronary angioplasty in the 80mg Atorvastatin medication patients. In the control group, the sICAM-1 (174.55 \u00b1 38.91 vs 204.11 \u00b1 58.24) and hCRP (1.89 \u00b1 1.93 vs 9.0 \u00b1 11.1) serum concentrations at 24 hours after PCI were significantly elevated (P < .05) compared to preoperative values, whereas the increases in the 2 groups treated with atorvastatin were not significant. In addition, the rise in serum TnI concentration level from pre- to postoperative in the 80-mg (0.02 \u00b1 0.02 vs 0.09 \u00b1 0.08) and the 40-mg (0.01 \u00b1 0.03 vs 1.2 \u00b1 2.59) reloading groups was less than that of the controls (0.01 \u00b1 0.02 vs 1.75 \u00b1 3.09) (p < 0.05).", 
    "28": "Our results suggested that high-dose atorvastatin application before PCI triggered early EPC circulation.

The epidemiology of dyslipidemia and its interactions with malnutrition and inflammation in CKD patients have been the subject of much interest in the past decade. Recent clinical trials have explored the effects of statins on CVD specifically in CKD patients.", 
    "30": "Whereas the risk relationship between total cholesterol level and CVD morbidity and mortality is direct, strong and progressive in CKD patients without malnutrition and inflammation, it is inconsistent and often paradoxical in those with malnutrition and inflammation. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that statins reduce significantly the risk of CVD in CKD patients before the initiation of dialysis. However, the beneficial effect of statins in CKD patients on dialysis is uncertain. In CKD patients on dialysis, malnutrition and inflammation pose a higher risk for CVD than dyslipidemia.",

Noninvasive spatial maps of tablet swelling and dissolution, as well as the mobilization and distribution of the drug are quantified and visualized. Two-dimensional active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) mobilization and distribution maps were obtained via (19)F MRI.

    "33": "In patients with cardiovascular diseases, adherence to medication is a fundamental prerequisite for pharmacological therapy to be effective. Nonadherence to medication is a major public health problem that compromises the effectiveness of therapies and results in suboptimal clinical outcomes. The behaviour of nonadherence is complex and is strongly influenced by an interaction between various factors, such as patient education, communication between patients and physicians, drug dosing schedules, and access to health care. Interventions have been implemented to target these barriers to adherence; however, individual interventions have generally been associated with fairly modest improvements in adherence. Financial incentive schemes and modern technology, such as mobile telephone applications, are being harnessed as novel strategies to improve adherence. Ultimately, multifaceted strategies tailored to individual patients are likely to be required to improve long-term adherence to medication and consequently enhance patient health.",

The present study aimed to explore changes in hepatic breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) expression and functions, as well as the possible underlying mechanisms, in type 2 diabetic patients, type 1 (streptozotocin-induced), and type 2 (Goto Kakizaki) diabetic rats. Protein and mRNA levels of human (h) and rat (r) BCRP were investigated using Western blot and quantitative polymerase chain reaction analyses. Functions of liver rBCRP were evaluated using rosuvastatin. Sandwich cultured rat hepatocytes (SCRH) were cultured with d-glucose, insulin, or oleic acid for 72 h, and rBCRP mRNA was detected. The effect of oleic acid on rBCRP function in SCRH was also investigated using rosuvastatin. Results showed that liver rBCRP mRNA levels decreased to 20% in type 1 diabetic rats, whereas that in diabetic patients and GK rats significantly increased threefold and twentyfold, respectively. No changes were observed in h/rBCRP protein levels of type 2 diabetic patients and GK rats. The functions of rBCRP significantly declined in type 1 diabetic rats but showed no significant changes in GK rats. The data from SCRH indicated that d-glucose decreased rBCRP mRNA level to 60%. Oleic acid increased rBCRP mRNA in SCRH by approximately eightfold but decreased rBCRP function to 50%. Therefore, h/rBCRP expression and functions were oppositely regulated in type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus subjects. Alternations in d-glucose, insulin, and free fatty acid levels in plasma might contribute to the changes in h/rBCRP expression and functions.", 
    "35": "Secondary prevention trials have demonstrated the efficacy of statins in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with coronary artery disease and events after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). However, there are few data describing the clinical value of statins in patients with coronary artery disease and chronic kidney disease (CKD) undergoing PCI. Of 10,148 patients who entered into Evaluation of Drug Eluting Stents and Ischemic Events, a multicenter registry of unselected patients undergoing PCI from July 2004 to December 2007, we studied 2,306 patients with CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate \u226460 ml/min based on the Modified Diet in Renal Disease calculation). Patients were stratified into those receiving statins at discharge (n = 1,833, 79%) or not (n = 473, 21%). Patients in the statin group had a greater prevalence of hypertension, recent myocardial infarction (MI), and use of \u03b2 blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. Outcomes were assessed from discharge through 1-year follow-up. One-year all-cause mortality was 5.7% in statin group versus 8.7% in the no statin group (adjusted hazard ratio 0.55, 95% confidence interval 0.34 to 0.88). The composite of death, MI, and repeat revascularization was lower in statin group (adjusted hazard ratio 0.71, 95% confidence interval 0.51 to 0.99). In conclusion, among patients with CKD undergoing PCI, the prescription of statins at hospital discharge was associated with a significant improvement in subsequent outcomes including mortality and composite end point of death, MI, and repeat revascularization.",

This subanalysis of the recently published CRUCIAL trial compared the treatment-related reductions in calculated CHD and stroke risk among Pacific Asian (PA) patients using a variety of region-specific risk assessment models. As a result, greater reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides were observed in the proactive multifactorial intervention (PMI) arm compared with the usual care arm at Week 52 for PA patients. The relative percentage change in 10-yr CHD risk between baseline and Week 52 in the PMI versus usual care arms was greatest using the NIPPON DATA80 fatal CHD model (LS [least square] mean difference -42.6%), and similar in the SCORE fatal CHD and Framingham total CHD models (LS mean difference -29.4% and -30.8%, respectively).

    "41": "Transform methods have proved effective for networks describing a progression of events. In semi-Markov networks, we calculated the transform of time to a terminating event from corresponding transforms of intermediate steps. Saddlepoint inversion then provided survival and hazard functions, which integrated, and fully utilised, the network data. However, the presence of censored data introduces significant difficulties for these methods. Many participants in controlled trials commonly remain event-free at study completion, a consequence of the limited period of follow-up specified in the trial design. Transforms are not estimable using nonparametric methods in states with survival truncated by end-of-study censoring. We propose the use of parametric models specifying residual survival to next event. As a simple approach to extrapolation with competing alternative states, we imposed a proportional incidence (constant relative hazard) assumption beyond the range of study data. No proportional hazards assumptions are necessary for inferences concerning time to endpoint; indeed, estimation of survival and hazard functions can proceed in a single study arm. We demonstrate feasibility and efficiency of transform inversion in a large randomised controlled trial of cholesterol-lowering therapy, the Long-Term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischaemic Disease study. Transform inversion integrates information available in components of multistate models: estimates of transition probabilities and empirical survival distributions. As a by-product, it provides some ability to forecast survival and hazard functions forward, beyond the time horizon of available follow-up. Functionals of survival and hazard functions provide inference, which proves sharper than that of log-rank and related methods for survival comparisons ignoring intermediate events.", 
    "42": "Older antihypertensive medications are believed to be associated with metabolic disturbances, especially raised glucose levels. Owing to this, many physicians shun their use. Newer antihypertensive medications are metabolically neutral or metabolically favorable; therefore, they are looked upon favorably and are chosen as primary medications for the treatment of hypertension. Here we review the literature on the glucose effects of older and newer antihypertensive medications. We also consider what, if any, impact these metabolic effects have on cardiovascular disease outcomes. We show that the diabetogenic effects of thiazide diuretics and beta blockers are small relative to the glucose effects of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and calcium channel blockers, and that over time, the glucose differences between older and newer medications diminish. Importantly, we show that the diabetogenic effects of older antihypertensive medications do not translate into increased cardiovascular disease risk.", 
    "43": "Despite population-based improvements in cardiovascular risk factors, such as blood pressure, cholesterol and smoking, cardiovascular disease still remains the number-one cause of mortality in the United States. In 1989, Kaplan coined the term \"Deadly Quartet\" to represent a combination of risk factors that included upper body obesity, glucose intolerance, hypertriglyceridemia and hypertension [Kaplan in Arch Int Med 7:1514-1520, 1989]. In 2002, the third report of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel (NCEP-ATP III) essentially added low HDL-C criteria and renamed this the \"metabolic syndrome.\" [The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) in JAMA 285:2486-2497, 2001] However, often forgotten was that a pro-inflammatory state and pro-thrombotic state were also considered components of the syndrome, albeit the panel did not find enough evidence at the time to recommend routine screening for these risk factors [The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) in JAMA 285:2486-2497, 2001]. Now over a decade later, it may be time to reconsider this deadly quartet by reevaluating the roles of obesity and subclinical inflammation as they relate to the metabolic syndrome. To complete this new quartet, the addition of increased exposure to elevated levels of particulate matter in the atmosphere may help elucidate why this cardiovascular pandemic continues, despite our concerted efforts. In this article, we will summarize the evidence, focusing on how statin therapy may further impact this new version of the \"deadly quartet\".", 
    "44": "Statins, routinely used to treat hypercholesterolemia, selectively induce apoptosis in some tumor cells by inhibiting the mevalonate pathway. Recent clinical studies suggest that a subset of breast tumors is particularly susceptible to lipophilic statins, such as fluvastatin. To quickly advance statins as effective anticancer agents for breast cancer treatment, it is critical to identify the molecular features defining this sensitive subset. We have therefore characterized fluvastatin sensitivity by MTT assay in a panel of 19 breast cell lines that reflect the molecular diversity of breast cancer, and have evaluated the association of sensitivity with several clinicopathological and molecular features. A wide range of fluvastatin sensitivity was observed across breast tumor cell lines, with fluvastatin\u00a0triggering cell death in a subset of sensitive cell lines. Fluvastatin sensitivity was associated with an estrogen receptor alpha (ER\u03b1)-negative, basal-like tumor subtype, features that can be scored with routine and/or strong preclinical diagnostics. To ascertain additional candidate sensitivity-associated molecular features, we mined publicly available gene expression datasets, identifying genes\u00a0encoding regulators of mevalonate production, non-sterol lipid homeostasis, and global cellular metabolism, including the oncogene MYC. Further exploration of this data allowed us to generate a 10-gene mRNA abundance signature predictive of fluvastatin sensitivity, which showed preliminary validation in an independent set of breast tumor cell lines. Here, we have therefore identified several candidate predictors of sensitivity to fluvastatin treatment in breast cancer, which warrant further preclinical and clinical evaluation.", 
    "45": "Thin-cap fibroatheroma (TCFA) is the most common type of vulnerable plaque and is the precursor of plaque rupture. However, rupture of a TCFA is not the only mechanism underlying thrombus formation or acute coronary syndrome. Although statin therapy changes the composition of coronary artery plaques, the effects of statins, particularly different types of statins, on plaque phenotype have not been fully examined. This study compared the effects of pitavastatin versus pravastatin on coronary artery plaque phenotype assessed by virtual histology (VH) intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) in patients with angina pectoris (AP). Coronary atherosclerosis in nonculprit lesions was evaluated using VH-IVUS at baseline and 8 months after statin therapy; analyzable IVUS data were obtained from 83 patients with stable AP (39 patients treated with pitavastatin and 44 with pravastatin) and 36 patients with unstable AP (19 patients treated with pitavastatin and 17 with pravastatin). Pitavastatin had a strong effect on reducing pathologic intimal thickening (PIT), especially in patients with unstable AP, but had no impact on VH-TCFA or fibroatheroma (FA). By contrast, pravastatin had weak effects on reducing PIT, VH-TCFA, or FA. Increases in the number of calcified plaques were observed for both statins. In conclusion, pitavastatin and pravastatin changed coronary artery plaque phenotype as assessed by VH-IVUS in patients with AP. However, the effects of these statins on coronary artery plaque phenotype were different.", 
    "46": "Despite recent advances in the management of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) by using protective ventilator strategies, the mortality rate of ARDS remains high. The complexity of the pathogenesis and the heterogeneity of coexisting diseases in patients with ARDS require critical care physicians and researchers to search for multiple therapeutic approaches in order to further improve patient outcome. This review article therefore focuses on the recent studies in the field of pharmacological intervention in ARDS.", 
    "47": "A number of approaches for pharmacological intervention have been evaluated in patients with ARDS, but most of them failed to reduce mortality or improve outcomes despite some promising observations seen in preclinical studies. Prior methods such as nitric oxide inhalation, neuromuscular blocking agents and corticosteroids may still have a place in the treatment, while novel therapeutic approaches including the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, statins and stem cells are currently under investigation.", 
    "48": "Overall, there is no proven pharmacological therapy in ARDS, but some pharmacological interventions were associated with beneficial effects in certain subgroups of patients depending on the cause, underlying diseases, the concurrent supportive therapies and timing. Further clinical trials are warranted to assess multiple outcome measurement of the promising pharmacological interventions in selected patients with ARDS.",

    "50": "We carefully documented discharge medications at baseline and self-reported use of medications at annual follow-up in the Northeast Melbourne Stroke Incidence Study (NEMESIS). We defined optimal medication use when patients reported taking (1) antihypertensive agents and (2) statin and antithrombotic agents (ischemic stroke only). Logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with optimal medication use between 2 and 10 years after stroke.", 
    "51": "We recruited 1241 patients with stroke. Optimal prescription at discharge from hospital was the most important factor associated with optimal medication use at each time point: odds ratio (OR), 32.2 (95% confidence interval [CI], 13.6-76.1) at 2 years; OR, 7.86 (95% CI, 4.48-13.8) at 5 years (425 of 505 survivors); OR, 6.04 (95% CI, 3.18-11.5) at 7 years (326 of 390 survivors); and OR, 2.62 (95% CI, 1.19-5.77) at 10 years (256 of 293 survivors). Associations were similar in men and women. The association between optimal prescription at discharge and optimal medication use at each time point was greater in those who were not disadvantaged, particularly women.", 
    "52": "Prescription of medications at hospital discharge was the strongest predictor of ongoing medication use in survivors of stroke, even at 10 years after stroke. Ensuring that patients with stroke are discharged on optimal medications is likely to improve their long-term management, but further strategies might be required among those who are disadvantaged.", 
    "53": "Maintaining cholesterol and triglyceride (TG) levels within healthy limits is critical for decreasing the risk of heart disease. Dyslipidemia refers to the abnormal levels of lipids in the blood, including low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), also known as good cholesterol, high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), also known as bad cholesterol, and/or high TG levels that contribute to the development and progression of atherosclerosis. In this article we reviewed some of the current therapeutic targets for the treatment of dyslipidemia, with a primary focus on endothelial lipase and lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase for raising HDL-C, and the proprotein convertase subtilisin-like kexin type 9 (PCSK9), microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, and the messenger RNA of apolipoprotein B for lowering LDL-C. In addition, we reviewed the role of apolipoprotein AI (apoAI) in raising HDL-C, where we discuss three apoAI-based drugs under development. These are its mutated dimer (apoAI-Milano), a complex with phospholipids, and a mimetic peptide. Atherosclerosis, mainly because of dyslipidemia, is a leading cause of cardiovascular disease. Regarding the title of this article, the 'good' refers to HDL-C, the 'bad' refers to LDL-C, and the 'ugly' refers to atherosclerosis.",

The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of rosuvastatin or simvastatin/ezetimibe on arterial wall stiffness measured according to the brachial and ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) in CAD patients.", 
    "56": "Both treatments significantly improved the levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TGs), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (p<0.05). The ROCK activity and baPWV were significantly improved in the rosuvastatin group compared with that observed in the simvastatin/ezetimibe group (p<0.05). The changes in baPWV were significantly correlated with the changes in the ROCK activity (r=0.488, p<0.01), but not with the changes in the lipid profile or the hs-CRP level.", 
    "57": "Compared with simvastatin/ezetimibe (10/10 mg), rosuvastatin (10 mg) appears to more effectively improve arterial wall stiffness that may be mediated by modulation of the ROCK activity.", 
    "58": "In order to investigate the effect and mechanism of action of rosuvastatin on atherosclerotic lesion in a Wistar rat model, 16 Wistar rats were fed a cholesterol-rich, vitamin D3 overload diet and underwent balloon injury of the aorta. One day prior to injury, half of the rats began rosuvastatin treatment (5mg/kg/d) via oral gavage. Eight control rats received a basal diet and sham operation. After 14 weeks of treatment, the animals were sacrificed. Blood was collected to measure lipid and angiotensin II (Ang II) levels and morphologic analysis was performed on the aorta. Scavenger receptor-class B type I (SR-BI), Ang II type-1 (AT1) receptor and phosphorylated extracellular signal regulated kinase 1/2 (p-ERK1/2) protein and mRNA levels were measured via Western blot and real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Spearman's rank correlation was utilized to examine the relationships between SR-BI and Ang II or AT1 receptor expression. The atherosclerosis model group demonstrated an increase in plasma lipid levels and aortic plaque formation. After 14 weeks of treatment with rosuvastatin, there was a significant decrease in plasma lipid and Ang II levels accompanied by an improvement in aortic lesions. Rosuvastatin increased the expression of SR-BI but significantly inhibited the expression of AT1 receptor and p-ERK1/2. SR-BI protein expression was inversely correlated with both the level of Ang II and expression of the AT1 receptor. In conclusion, rosuvastatin attenuates atherosclerosis in the Wistar rat model, and its anti-atherosclerotic activity may be through upregulation of SR-BI expression and inhibition of p-ERK1/2 levels and AT1 receptor expression.", 
    "59": "This work aimed at designing a formulation based on nanostructured lipid carriers (NLC) for transdermal co-administration of olanzapine and simvastatin, using passive and active strategies in a combined in vitro/in vivo development approach. NLC were prepared by two distinct methods, namely solvent emulsification-evaporation (SE/E) and high pressure homogenization (HPH). HPH was selected on the basis of a better performance in terms of drug loading and in vitro permeation rate. Several mathematical models were used to elucidate the release mechanisms from lipid nanoparticles. In vitro release kinetics was shown to be driven by diffusion, but other mechanisms were also present, and supported the feasibility of using NLC for sustained drug delivery. The in vitro skin studies showed that the chemical penetration enhancers, limonene and ethanol, added to the NLC formulations, promoted a synergistic permeation enhancement of both drugs, with olanzapine exhibiting a higher permeation than simvastatin. Transdermal administration to rats resulted in steady-state levels reached at around 10h and maintained for 48h, again with olanzapine exhibiting a better permeation rate. The pharmacokinetic parameters indicated that the NLC dispersion displayed a better in vivo performance than the gel, which was consistent with the in vitro results. These differences were, however, negligible in the flux values, supporting the use of gel as a final, more convenient, formulation. The in vivo experiments in rats correlated well with in vitro findings and revealed that the combined use of ethanol and limonene, incorporated in the NLC formulation, provided the main driving force for drug permeation. The Dermaroller\u00ae pretreatment did not significantly enhance drug permeation, supporting the use of passive methods as suitable for a transdermal delivery system. Furthermore, this work may provide a promising proof-of-concept for further clinical application in the treatment of schizophrenia and associated disorders, combined with dyslipidemia.",

Statin users were more likely to be men, older age, and have higher burden of risk factors (p <0.05). In age gender adjusted analysis the odds ratio for NAFLD with statin use was 0.87 (0.61-1.25, p = 0.46) in the presence of metabolic syndrome and 1.08 (0.88-1.32, p = 0.56) in its absence.

There was no significant association between statin use and fatty liver index in a subanalysis of NAFLD individuals (71 \u00b1 18 vs. 69 \u00b1 23, p = 0.18). Although FIB-4 was mildly elevated with statin use (1.20 \u00b1 0.51 vs. 1.02 \u00b1 0.46, p <0.001), a multivariate analysis adjusted for age, gender and risk factors revealed statin use was not associated with severe fibrosis (FIB >1.45) (OR 0.88, 95% CI: 0.60-1.29, p = 0.50).",

In the pre-treatment, rats were given atorvastatin or vehicle for 7 days before MCAO. In the post-treatment, rats received atorvastatin or vehicle for 7 days after MCAO. Measurement of infarct volume, as well as neurological and immunohistochemical assessments, were done 24h and 7 days after reperfusion.",

Seven days after reperfusion, infarct volumes in the post-treatment group and continuous-treatment group (but not the pre-treatment group) were significantly smaller than in the vehicle-treated group. Only the continuous-treatment group had significantly improved neurological scores 7 days after reperfusion compared with the vehicle group. Post-treatment and continuous-treatment groups had significantly decreased lipid peroxidation, oxidative DNA damage, microglial activation, expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and neuronal damage in the cortical ischemic boundary area after 7 days of reperfusion.",

The overall attainment rate was 50%, with the lowest rate in patients set at the most stringent target (22%), followed by those whose therapeutic goals were <100 mg/dL (69%) and <130 mg/dL (87%). The success of LDL-C control was lower in patients with multiple risk factors other than CHD or its equivalents than in those without these multiple risk factors (37% vs. 53%, p < 0.001), and lower in patients with metabolic syndrome than in those without (43% vs. 66%, p < 0.001). Baseline LDL-C and cardiovascular risk were inversely associated with goal attainment, whereas treatment with statins was directly associated with the achievement of LDL-C goals.

Treadmill CPET parameters were measured before and after exercise preoperatively for these patients. These parameters were as follows: peak oxygen uptake (VO2 peak), anaerobic threshold (AT), and ventilator equivalents for oxygen and carbon dioxide (VE/VO2 and VE/VCO2, respectively). Total exercise time and the time at which AT was achieved were also recorded. A comparison between pre- and postexercise parameters was made to detect for a possible improvement in aerobic fitness.",

Theoretically, in states associated with very low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, cholesterol conversion to steroid hormones may be impaired. The study included 15 men with coronary artery disease, in whom initial statin treatment had been unsuccessful and therefore was replaced with rosuvastatin (20-40\u00a0mg daily). Although in 11 patients, rosuvastatin decreased plasma LDL cholesterol levels to below 70\u00a0mg/dL, the drug only moderately reduced testosterone levels and increased gonadotropin levels, as well as insignificantly increased plasma ACTH levels. Aggressive rosuvastatin treatment did not affect plasma cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate levels, and urine free cortisol. Our results suggest that intensive rosuvastatin treatment is associated with only small changes in adrenal and testicular steroidogenesis.", 
    "81": "High serum/plasma cholesterol levels have been suggested as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Some reports, mostly retrospective epidemiological studies, have observed a decreased prevalence of AD in patients taking the cholesterol lowering drugs, statins. The strongest evidence causally linking cholesterol to AD is provided by experimental studies showing that adding/reducing cholesterol alters amyloid precursor protein (APP) and amyloid beta-protein (Ab) levels. However, there are problems with the cholesterol-AD hypothesis. Cholesterol levels in serum/plasma and brain of AD patients do not support cholesterol as a causative factor in AD.Prospective studies on statins and AD have largely failed to show efficacy. Even the experimental data are open to interpretation given that it is well-established that modification of cholesterol levels has effects on multiple proteins, not only amyloid precursor protein and Ab. The purpose of this review, therefore, was to examine the above-mentioned issues, discuss the pros and cons of the cholesterol-AD hypothesis, involvement of other lipids in the mevalonate pathway, and consider that AD may impact cholesterol homeostasis.",

It is therefore not surprising that there is overlap between these two common chronic liver diseases, although the relationship appears to go beyond isolated co-existence. Hepatic steatosis is a common feature of CHC infection and can be related to both metabolic and viral specific factors. Steatosis in the setting of nongenotype 3 CHC has been predictive of response to therapy prior to the advent of the direct acting antiviral medications (DAAs). Similarly, lipid metabolism appears important in response to CHC treatment. The pathways for both lipid homeostasis and NAFLD as it pertains to CHC infection as well as the utilization of statin therapy in CHC infection will be reviewed with a focus on the relevance of these topics in the era of DAA therapy.",

The brain may be affected during the sepsis, and acute and long-term brain dysfunctions have been observed in both animal models and septic patients. Oxidative stress and antioxidant systems may prove the basis underling brain dysfunction in sepsis. The antioxidant therapy may be theoretically achieved by the following strategies: restoring endogenous antioxidants and nutrients and supplementation with exogenous trace elements, vitamins, and nutrients with antioxidant proprieties; or administering drugs that reduce oxidative stress, such as N-acetylcysteine (NAC), vitamins and statins. In the review, we described below the involvement of oxidative stress and antioxidants defenses and potential utility of these strategies and present data regarding their use in sepsis.",

High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) is a strong, independent and inverse predictor of cardiovascular risk in many epidemiologic studies and has, therefore, emerged as a potential novel therapeutic target for addressing this substantial residual risk. Nevertheless, the failure of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors and niacin in clinical trials has generated considerable speculation about the beneficial effects of HDL. Experimental studies have identified several HDL cardioprotective functions, including enhancement of macrophage reverse cholesterol transport and endothelial function and its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic properties. Furthermore, HDL is highly heterogeneous and the atheroprotective functions of the different HDL subpopulations are not completely understood. Current available data indicate that increased HDL-C levels do not always correlate with enhanced HDL functions and, therefore, should not be considered a biomarker of HDL functionality. The clinical application of the novel HDL-based therapeutic approaches requires the development of validated and reproducible measures of key HDL functions.",

Hyperlipidaemia is thought to aggravate glomerulosclerosis (hardening of blood vessels in the kidneys) and enhance progression of glomerular disease. Studies have established that reduction in total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is associated with reduction in risk of cardiovascular diseases. In 2011, the European Society of Cardiology and European Atherosclerosis Society guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemia recommended use of statins as first-line agents in the management of nephrotic dyslipidaemia. However, the effectiveness and safety of statins for people with nephrotic syndrome remains uncertain. Furthermore, the efficacy of second-line lipid-lowering drugs, such as ezetimibe and nicotinic acid, has not been proven in patients with nephrotic syndrome who are unable to tolerate statin therapy.",

We found no published studies comparing second-line agents such as ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, and nicotinic acid with placebo or no treatment. Our assessment of the risk of bias found that one study was judged overall to be at low risk of bias and the remaining four were judged to be at high risk of bias.Most outcomes were supported by single study data. One study reported significantly increased high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol among participants in the statin arm compared with the no treatment group (MD 5.40 mg/dL, 95% CI 2.31 to 8.49). Another study reported higher serum albumin in the statin group compared to those who received no treatment (MD 0.60 g/dL, 95% CI 0.14 to 1.06). No serious adverse events, such as rhabdomyolysis, were reported, however some minor events occurred. One study reported no significant difference in the number of participants with elevated liver enzymes (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.13 to 69.52); three studies reported liver enzymes remained within the normal range (no data provided). Four studies reported creatinine phosphokinase (CPK). One study indicated that CPK values fluctuated in both the simvastatin and placebo groups (no data provided); the remaining three studies reported CPK either stayed within the normal range (one study) or there was no significant difference between the lipid lowering agents and placebo.",

Of 85 017 individuals, 55%, 76%, and 61% used angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, \u03b2-blockers, and statins, respectively, within 30 days after discharge. No marked differences in use were found by race/ethnicity, but women were less likely to use angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers and \u03b2-blockers compared with men. However, at 12 months after discharge, compared with white men, black and Hispanic women had the lowest likelihood (\u224830%-36% lower; P<0.05) of being adherent, followed by white, Asian, and other women and black and Hispanic men (\u22489%-27% lower; P<0.05).

Averaged changes in cellular cholesterol efflux during active treatment were correlated positively with changes in HDL cholesterol, apoA-I and pre-\u03b2-HDL (P < 0.05 to P < 0.001). There were no inter-relationships between changes in the three HDL functionalities during treatment (P > 0.10).

In this review, we discuss the phenotypic transformation of SMC in cerebral vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage. Phenotypic transformation starts with an insult as caused by aneurysm rupture: Elevation of intracranial and blood pressure, secretion of norepinephrine, and mechanical force on an artery are factors that can cause aneurysm. The phenotypic transformation of SMC is accelerated by inflammation, thrombin, and growth factors. A wide variety of cytokines (e.g., interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-33, matrix metalloproteinases, nitric oxidase synthases, endothelins, thromboxane A2, mitogen-activated protein kinase, platelet-derived vascular growth factors, and vascular endothelial factor) all play roles in cerebral vasospasm (CVS). We summarize the correlations between various factors and the phenotypic transformation of SMC. A new target of this study is the transient receptor potential channel in CVS. Statin together with fasdil prevents phenotypic transformation of SMC in an animal model. Clazosentan prevents CVS and improves outcome in aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage in a dose-dependent manner. Clinical trials of cilostazol for the prevention of phenotypic transformation of SMC have been reported, along with requisite experimental evidence. To conquer CVS in its complexity, we will ultimately need to elucidate its general, underlying mechanism.",

The downstream effects of statins are not limited to inhibition of cholesterol synthesis alone. Statins have anti-inflammatory effects thought to be important in the setting of acute myocardial infarction which also may be a mechanism involved in anti-carcinogenic properties of statins. Furthermore, statin inhibition of the mevalonate pathway may impact Ras and RhoGTPases that are important in cell proliferation, migration and apoptosis. These alterations may also play a role in the anti-cancer effect of statins.

The mechanisms that underlie the anti-tumor activity of the statins are nonetheless poorly defined. No studies have analyzed how they alter the tumor-associated leukocyte infiltrate, a central factor that influences tumor stroma and cancer evolution. Here we used HER2/neu transgenic (Tg-neu) mice to analyze the effect of lovastatin (Lov) on the inflammatory reaction of spontaneous mammary tumors. Lov treatment of tumor-bearing Tg-neu mice did not alter growth of established tumors, but significantly reduced the number of new oncogenic lesions in these mice. Moreover, Lov inhibited the growth of newly implanted Tg-neu tumors in immunocompetent but not in immunodeficient mice. We found that Lov enhanced tumor infiltration by effector T cells, and reduced the number of immunosuppressive and pro-angiogenic M2-like tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). Concomitantly, the drug improved the structure and function of the tumor vasculature, measured as enhanced tumor oxygenation and penetration of cytotoxic drugs. Microarray analysis identified a Lov-elicited genetic program in Tg-neu tumors that might explain these effects; we observed Lov-induced downregulation of placental growth factor, which triggers aberrant angiogenesis and M2-like TAM polarization. Our results identify a role for lovastatin in the shaping and re-education of the inflammatory infiltrate in tumors, with functional consequences in angiogenesis and antitumor immunity.",

Heart rate was not significantly altered during PS administration, but mean blood pressure decreased slightly. The hematological and blood biochemical values were within normal limits during PS administration.

    "156": "A simple and fast methodology to detect and identify multiple classes of lipid from human plasma is developed utilizing ultra-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF) as lipidomics platform. All the conditions for the sample preparation and analytical instruments were optimized in detail to detect nine lipid classes (phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylglycerol (PG), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), phosphatidylcholine (PC), triacylglyceride (TG), phosphatidylinositol (PI), lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC), lysophosphatidic acid (LysoPA), and sphingomyelin (SM)), which are the most important biologically active lipids but have different characteristics. Finally, the plasma was prepared after a liquid-liquid extraction with a mixture of chloroform/methanol (1:2v/v) including salting out by adding 0.15M of NaCl and the residue after evaporation was reconstituted with a mixture of chloroform/methanol (1:1v/v) to dissolve all lipids which have different polarity. The chromatographic conditions were set up such that mobile phase (A) comprised 10mM ammonium acetate in 40% acetonitrile and mobile phase (B) comprised 10mM ammonium acetate in acetonitrile:isopropanol=10:90(v/v) with ACQUITY BEH C18 as the stationary phase. In particular, a retention time index of PC was constructed by analyzing known standards to confirm each variant of PC without the use of any additional standards in every experiment. The lipidomic methodology and the retention time index of PC were applied to analyze the lipidomic profiling of human plasma from rosuvastatin (lipid lowering drug) treated subjects. In the developed lipidomic platform, all lipids were successfully analyzed within 16min and PCs could be confirmed with the PC retention time index. In rosuvastatin treatment, the lipid profiling was changed in all the eight lipid classes. The level of SM, TG, PI and PE decrease significantly but LysoPCs and PCs were whether decreased or increased. Those results indicated that the plasma level of overall lipids decreased by drug response, however, the changes in the lipids which are important components for biological membrane such as LysoPC and PC were more complicated, and it could be related to the side effect of rousuvastatin. In conclusion, it was found that our lipidomic methodology and the PC retention time index provided not only overall lipidomic information but also profiled specific information of drug response.",

A gap is acknowledged in LDL-C goal attainment, but because of the passage of the American Recovery & Reinvestment Act and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Acts there is now reason for optimism that this gap can be narrowed. For HIT to be effectively used to achieve treatment goals, it must be implemented in a setting in which the health care team is fully committed to achieving these goals. Implementation of HIT alone has not resulted in reducing the gap. It is critical to build an effective management strategy into the HIT platform without increasing the overall work/time burden on staff. By enhancing communication between the health care team and the patient, more timely adjustments to treatment plans can be made with greater opportunity for LDL-C goal attainment and improved efficiency in the long run. Patients would be encouraged to take a more active role. Support tools are available. The National Lipid Association has developed a toolkit designed to improve patient compliance and could be modified for use in an HIT system. The importance of a collaborative approach between nongovernmental organizations such as the National Lipid Association, National Quality Forum, HIT partners, and other members of the health care industry offers the best opportunity for long-term success and the real possibility that such efforts could be applied to other chronic conditions, for example, diabetes and hypertension.",

Recent studies indicate that phosphatidyl inositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P2] regulates the plasma-membrane localization of certain proteins, and its synthase, the type I phosphatidyl inositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (PI4P5K), is largely controlled by RhoA/ROCK. Here, we examined whether PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PI4P5K are involved in the increased expression of ileal P-gp following the ERM activation by ETP treatment. Male ddY mice (4-week-old) were treated with ETP (10 mg/kg/day, per os, p.o.) for 5 days. Protein-expression levels were measured by either western blot or dot blot analysis and molecular interactions were assessed using immunoprecipitation assays. ETP treatment significantly increased PI4P5K, ERM, and P-gp expression in the ileal membrane. This effect was suppressed following the coadministration of ETP with rosuvastatin (a RhoA inhibitor) or fasudil (a ROCK inhibitor). Notably, the PtdIns(4,5)P2 expression in the ileal membrane, as well as both P-gp and ERM levels coimmunoprecipitated with anti-PtdIns(4,5)P2 antibody, were increased by ETP treatment. PtdIns(4,5)P2 and PI4P5K may contribute to the increase in ileal P-gp expression observed following the ETP treatment, possibly through ERM activation via the RhoA/ROCK pathway.",

Previous studies have shown that some polymorphisms of the gene encoding farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FDPS), the main target of aminobisphosphonates, modulate the response to these drugs. In this study, we explored whether those single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) also influence the changes in bone mineral density (BMD) following therapy with statins. Sixty-six patients with coronary heart disease were studied at baseline and after 1-year therapy with atorvastatin. BMD was measured by DXA. Three SNPs of the FDPS gene (rs2297480, rs11264359 and rs17367421) were analyzed by using Taqman assays. The results showed that there was no association between the SNPs and basal BMD. However, rs2297480 and rs11264359 alleles, which are in linkage disequilibrium, were associated with changes in hip BMD following atorvastatin therapy. Thus, patients with AA genotype at the rs2297480 locus had a 0.8 \u00b1 0.8 % increase in BMD at the femoral neck, whereas in patients with AC/CC genotypes, BMD showed a 2.3 \u00b1 0.8 % decrease (p = 0.02). Similar results were obtained regarding changes of BMD at the femoral trochanter and when alleles at the rs11264359 locus were analyzed. However, there was no association between BMD and rs17367421 alleles. In conclusion, these results suggest that polymorphisms of the FDPS gene may influence the bone response to various drugs targeting the mevalonate pathway, including not only aminobisphosphonates but also statins.",

However, the electrophysiological properties of new-onset AF may vary because of the clinical background of patients. In this study, we evaluated clinical factors to identify the determinants of FCL in new-onset AF. Electrocardiograms (ECGs) recorded from 2008 through 2011 were analyzed using our digital ECG-profiling system. In the 1,578 AF episodes recorded, 466 new-onset AF episodes were identified using clinical referral history and previous ECGs. After evaluating FCL in these new-onset AF episodes, using a customized fibrillation wave analyzer with fast Fourier transform analysis, we divided the patients into a longer-FCL group and a shorter-FCL group using the median FCL (158 ms). Propensity score matching yielded 135 matched pairs of patients with comparable mean ages between the two groups. Four factors (brain natriuretic peptide levels, and use of angiotensin receptor blockers, calcium channel blockers or statins) exhibited a significant difference between the two groups. Multivariate analysis revealed that statin use was the only significant independent predictor of longer FCL (Odds ratio, 3.86; 95% CI, 1.659.63; P = 0.003). Among various clinical parameters, statin use was related to longer FCL at the time of new-onset AF in patients with AF.",

We selected from the Shinken Database a single-hospital-based cohort of Japanese patients (n = 15,227) who visited The Cardiovascular Institute between 2004 and 2010 to undergo PCI. We followed-up the patients after PCI. A major adverse cardiac event (MACE) was defined as composite endpoints including all-cause death, acute myocardial infarction (AMI), and target-lesion revascularization (TLR). This study included 747 SAP patients (median follow-up period, 1,000 \u00b1 703 days). The all cause mortality rate in SAP was 1.3% at 1 year, 2.7% at 3 years, and 6.1% at 5 years. The AMI rate was 0.5% at 1 year, 1.1% at 3 years, and 3.0% at 5 years, and the MACE rate was 14.0% at 1 year, 17.6% at 3 years, and 25.6% at 5 years. Moreover, new lesion PCI and heart failure admission continued to occur beyond 1 year after PCI without attenuation of their annual incidences up to 5 years. Multivariate analysis showed that poor left ventricular ejection fraction, chronic kidney disease (CKD), and absence of statin treatment were independent predictors of all-cause death of SAP patients after PCI. The results of the present study revealed the characteristics and long-term outcomes of Japanese SAP patients after PCI. The results of the present study suggest cardiorenal interaction and statin treatment play important roles in the long-term outcomes of Japanese CAD patients treated by PCI.", 
    "222": "Current evidence supports a robust association between obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) and the risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). YKL-40, a 40 kDa heparin- and chitin-binding glycoprotein, is found to be associated with the presence of CAD. This study aims to examine the association of serum levels of YKL-40 with the presence and severity of CAD in patients with OSAS.", 
    "223": "A total of 246 patients with OSAS who underwent coronary angiography for the evaluation of CAD (134 patients with CAD and 112 patients without CAD) were enrolled in this study. The severity of CAD was assessed using the coronary atherosclerosis index (CAI). Serum levels of YKL-40 were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.", 
    "224": "Serum YKL-40 levels were significantly higher in OSAS patients with CAD compared with those without CAD. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that serum YKL-40 levels were an independent determinant of the presence of CAD in patients with OSAS. In addition, Spearman correlation analysis showed that serum YKL-40 levels were positively correlated with CAI in OSAS patients with CAD. Patients with statin treatment showed significantly lower levels of serum YKL-40 compared with those without.", 
    "225": "Elevated levels of serum YKL-40 are associated with the presence and severity of CAD in patients with OSAS.", 
    "226": "The dramatic effectiveness of statins in improving the course of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease tends to overshadow questions of statin intolerance. Thus after more than 25 years of clinical statin use, intolerance remains a poorly understood, frustrating issue for patients and providers. It has been extraordinarily difficult to define statin intolerance and its implications for clinical practice. Here, we briefly summarize current knowledge and raise questions that need to be addressed."
