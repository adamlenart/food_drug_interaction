    "0": "Background The challenge of the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is to identify patients who would benefit from treatment with statins. Statins are currently prescribed to many patients, even those at a low 10-year risk of CVD. These latter patients may not be eligible for statins according to current guidelines. Design This study investigated the prescription of guideline-consistent (according to guidelines) and guideline-inconsistent (not according to guidelines) lipid-lowering treatment in primary prevention in a large contemporary Dutch cohort study (Lifelines). Methods Lifelines is a large cohort study from the Netherlands. Participants were recruited between 2006 and 2013. They completed questionnaires and underwent a physical examination. Participants with previous CVD were excluded. Statins and ezetimibe were grouped as statin treatment. The Dutch guideline on cardiovascular management was used to assess eligibility for statins. Results Of 147,785 participants, 7092 (4.8%) reported statin treatment. In 4667 (66%) participants, statin treatment was inconsistent with the Dutch guideline. A total of 78% of these participants had a low 10-year predicted CVD risk. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that female sex and smoking were strongly associated with guideline-inconsistent treatment. Interestingly, 65% of the these participants had low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels above the 95(th) percentile, adjusted for age and sex, two or more major risk factors of CVD or a positive family history of premature CVD. Therefore treatment might be reasonable. Conclusions There is a large inconsistency between guideline recommendations and the prescription of statins in clinical practice in the Netherlands. This is especially true for patients with low CVD risk. Many of these patients probably had risk-increasing circumstances justifying treatment.", 
    "1": "Statins are lipid-lowering medications used for primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic disease and represent a substantial portion of drug costs in the United States. A better understanding of prescribing patterns and drug costs should lead to more rational utilization and help constrain health care expenditures in the United States. The 2013 Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data: Part D Prescriber Public Use File for the State of Hawai'i was analyzed. The number of prescriptions for statins, total annual cost, and daily cost were calculated by prescriber specialty and drug. Potential savings from substituting the highest-cost statin with lower-cost statins were calculated. Over 421,000 prescriptions for statins were provided to Medicare Part D beneficiaries in Hawai'i in 2013, which cost $17.6M. The three most commonly prescribed statins were simvastatin (33.4%), atorvastatin (33.4%), and lovastatin (13.9%). Although rosuvastatin comprised 5.4% of the total statin prescriptions, it represented 30.1% of the total cost of statins due to a higher daily cost ($5.53/day) compared to simvastatin ($0.25/day) and atorvastatin ($1.10/day). Cardiologists and general practitioners prescribed the highest percentage of rosuvastatin (8% each). Hypothetical substitution of rosuvastatin would have resulted in substantial annual cost savings (Simvastatin would have saved $1.3M for 25% substitution and $5.1M for 100% substitution, while atorvastatin would have saved $1.1M for 25% substitution and $4.3M for 100% substitution). Among Medicare Part D beneficiaries in Hawai'i, prescribing variation for statins between specialties were observed. Substitution of higher-cost with lower-cost statins may lead to substantial cost savings.",

In this study, an NADPH-dependent carbonyl reductase (SrCR) from Synechocystis sp. was characterized to demonstrate a broad substrate spectrum, and the highest activity (53.1U/mg protein) with COBE. To regenerate the cofactor NADPH, Bacillus subtilis glucose dehydrogenase was successfully coexpressed with SrCR. Owing to the product inhibition, no more than 400mM of COBE could be completely reduced to (S)-CHBE using the recombinant Escherichia coli/pET-SrCR-GDH. The macroporous adsorption resin HZ 814 was applied to adsorb (S)-CHBE in situ to alleviate the product inhibitio. Consequently, 3000mM (494g/L) of COBE was bioconverted within 8h, resulting in a (S)-CHBE yield of 98.2%, with 99.4% ee and total turnover number of 15,000, revealed great industrial potential of (S)-CHBE production.",

We investigated the association between statin use and risk of multiple myeloma in a large US population, with an emphasis on accounting for this potential bias. We conducted a case-control study nested within 6 US integrated healthcare systems participating in the National Cancer Institute-funded Cancer Research Network. Adults aged \u226540 years who were diagnosed with multiple myeloma from 1998-2008 were identified through cancer registries (N\u2009=\u20092,532). For each case, five controls were matched on age, sex, health plan, and membership duration prior to diagnosis/index date. Statin prescriptions were ascertained from electronic pharmacy records. To address potential biases related to lipid levels and medication prescribing practices, multivariable marginal structural models were used to model statin use (\u22656 cumulative months) and risk of multiple myeloma, with examination of multiple latency periods. Statin use 48-72 months prior to diagnosis/index date was associated with a suggestive 20-28% reduced risk of developing multiple myeloma, compared to non-users. Recent initiation of statins was not associated with myeloma risk (risk ratio range 0.90-0.99 with 0-36 months latency). Older patients had more consistent protective associations across all latency periods (risk ratio range 0.67-0.87). Our results suggest that the association between statin use and multiple myeloma risk may vary by exposure window and age.

Monoclonal antibodies have been developed targeting PCSK9, which have been demonstrated to produce profound low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering when provided as monotherapy or in combination with statins. With the reports that the PCSK9 inhibitor evolocumab has a favorable impact on both plaque progression and cardiovascular outcomes, these findings begin to translate the benefits of PCSK9 inhibition from lipids to the vessel wall and ultimately to clinical outcomes.

    "27": "Statins are efficient cholesterol-lowering medicines utilized worldwide. However, 10% of patients suffer from adverse effects specially related to skeletal muscle function. Pro- or anti-oxidant effects of statins have been reported. Here we hypothesized that statins induce muscle mitochondrial oxidative stress leading to mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) which may explain statin muscle toxicity. Thus, our aims were to investigate the effects of statin chronic treatment on muscle mitochondrial respiration rates, MPT and redox state indicators in the context of hypercholesterolemia. For this purpose, we studied muscle biopsies of the hypercholesterolemic LDL receptor knockout mice (LDLr(-/-)) treated with pravastatin during 3 months. Plantaris, but not soleus muscle of treated mice showed significant inhibition of respiration rates induced by ADP (-14%), oligomycin (-20%) or FCCP (-40%). Inhibitions of respiratory rates were sensitive to EGTA (Ca(2+) chelator), cyclosporin A (MPT inhibitor), ruthenium red (inhibitor of mitochondria Ca(2+) uptake) and coenzyme Q10 (antioxidant), indicating that pravastatin treatment favors Ca(2+) induced MPT. Diet supplementation with creatine (antioxidant) also protected treated mice against pravastatin sensitization to Ca(2+) induced MPT. Among several antioxidant enzymes analyzed, only catalase activity was increased by 30% in plantaris muscle of pravastatin treated mice. Oxidized lipids, but not proteins biomarkers were identified in treated LDLr(-/-) plantaris muscle. Taken together, the present results suggest that chronic pravastatin administration to a model of familial hypercholesterolemia promotes mitochondrial dysfunctions in plantaris muscle that can be counteracted by antioxidants administered either in vitro (CoQ10) or in vivo (creatine). Therefore, we propose that inhibition of muscle mitochondrial respiration by pravastatin leads to an oxidative stress that, in the presence of calcium, opens the permeability transition pore. This mitochondrial oxidative stress caused by statin treatment also signals for cellular antioxidant system responses such as catalase upregulation. These results suggest that the detrimental effects of statins on muscle mitochondria could be prevented by co-administration of a safe antioxidant such as creatine or CoQ10.", 
    "28": "Statins and PCSK9 inhibitors dramatically lower plasma LDL levels and dramatically increase LDL receptor number within hepatocyte cell membranes. It seems self-evident that total clearance of LDL particles from plasma and total delivery of cholesterol to the liver must increase in consequence. However, based on the results of stable isotope tracer studies, this analysis demonstrates the contrary to be the case. Statins do not change the production rate of LDL particles. Accordingly, at steady state, the clearance rate cannot change. Because LDL particles contain less cholesterol on statin therapy, the delivery of cholesterol to the liver must, therefore, be reduced. PCSK9 inhibitors reduce the production of LDL particles and this further reduces cholesterol delivery to the liver. With both agents, a larger fraction of a smaller pool is removed per unit time. These findings are inconsistent with the conventional model of cholesterol homeostasis within the liver, but are consistent with a new model of regulation, the multi-channel model, which postulates that different lipoprotein particles enter the hepatocyte by different routes and have different metabolic fates within the hepatocyte. The multi-channel model, but not the conventional model, may explain how statins and PCSK9 inhibitors can produce sustained increases in LDL receptor number.",

However, little is known about the effects of long-term statin use prior to PPCI on such outcomes. Therefore, the aim of the present analysis was to clarify the effects of long-term statin use before PPCI on the treatment outcomes of patients following AMI. The records of 213 patients who had AMI and met the inclusion criteria were retrospectively reviewed. Patients were divided into two groups: A control group (n=178) who had received no statin pretreatment before AMI onset, and a statin group (n=35) who had received statin treatment for \u22651 month before AMI onset. All patients received a standard treatment regimen for the secondary prevention of coronary artery disease after PPCI. Baseline clinical variables, details of the PPCI procedure and clinical outcomes within 3 months after treatment were reviewed. Patients in the statin group were significantly older than those in the control group (P=0.003). Compared with the control group, there was a greater proportion of patients with hyperlipidemia and previous angina pectoris in the statin group. There were no differences in the use of other drugs (aspirin, \u03b2-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors) prior to PPCI between the two groups. The corrected TIMI frame count (cTFC) was significantly lower in the statin group than in the control group (24.1\u00b112.8 vs. 29.4\u00b114.3, respectively; P=0.043). Multivariable linear regression analysis showed that long-term statin use before AMI was a significant predictor of cTFC after PPCI (P=0.012). Furthermore, the incidence of major adverse cardiac events within 3 months after PPCI was higher in the control group than in the statin group (16.8 vs. 2.9%, respectively; P=0.032). Logistic regression analysis showed that previous statin use was associated with the incidence of major adverse cardiac events within 3 months after treatment (P=0.012).

Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between post-diagnostic statin use and all-cause or ovarian cancer-specific mortality. Among 4,419 patients with epithelial ovarian cancer, post-diagnostic statin use was not statistically significantly associated with all-cause (HR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.78-1.04) or ovarian cancer-specific mortality (HR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.76-1.08).

In women with endometrioid or clear cell tumour histology, cancer-specific mortality was reduced by 30-40% among statin users compared to non-users, however the analyses were limited by small numbers. Significantly reduced mortality with statin use was observed in subcohorts of new users of statins and of patients not using low-dose aspirin. In conclusion, we found no strong evidence of an association between post-diagnostic statin use and reduced mortality in ovarian cancer patients.

The matrix effect phenomenon evaluated by comparison of slopes of calibration curves was completely eliminated by solid-phase extraction based on the technique of molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs). Comparison of elution profiles obtained on the MIP and corresponding control non-imprinted polymer (NIP) showed selectivity of the extraction procedure. In addition, selectivity of the MIP material and the molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction (MISPE) was also proved by experiments evaluating retention of analytes physico-chemically similar to the target molecule. Extraction recoveries of these analytes represented by estrogen derivatives (estrone, estriol, 17\u03b1-ethinylestradiol, and \u03b2-estradiol) were very low or even null. Synthesis and preparation of the resulting MIP sorbent was characterized by excellent repeatability expressed as RSD 7.7% (n=9) of extraction recoveries.

    "94": "Hypercholesterolemia is one of the major risk factors for the development of cardiovascular disease. Atherosclerosis resulting from hypercholesterolemia causes many serious cardiovascular diseases. Statins are generally accepted as a treatment of choice for lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, which reduces coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality. Since statin use can be associated with muscle problems and other adverse symptoms, non-adherence and discontinuation of statin therapy often leads to inadequate control of plasma cholesterol levels and increased cardiovascular risk. Moreover, there is compelling evidence on the presence of still considerable residual cardiovascular risk in statin-treated patients. Ezetimibe improves cholesterol-lowering efficacy and provides mild additional cardiovascular protection when combined with statin treatment. Despite a favorable safety profile compared to statins, ezetimibe-induced cholesterol-lowering is modest when used alone. Hence, there is a critical need to identity additional effective hypolipidemic agents that can be used either in combination with statins, or alone, if statins are not tolerated. Thus, hypolipidemic agents such as proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, apolipoprotein B-100 antisense oligonucleotides, cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors, and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP) inhibitors, as well as yeast polysaccharides (beta-glucans and mannans) and compounds derived from natural sources (nutraceuticals) such as glucomannans, plant sterols, berberine, and red yeast rice are being used. In this review, we will discuss hypercholesterolemia, its impact on the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and the use of yeast polysaccharides, various nutraceuticals, and several therapeutic agents not derived from 'natural' sources, to treat hypercholesterolemia.",

    "102": "Background- Adaptive immune-response is associated with a worse outcome in acute coronary syndromes. Statins have anti-inflammatory activity beyond lowering lipid levels. We investigated the effects of ex-vivo and in-vivo atorvastatin treatment in acute coronary syndromes on CD4+T-cells, and the underlying molecular mechanisms.Approach and results- Blood samples were collected from 50 statin-na\u00efve acute coronary syndrome patients. We assessed CD4+T-cell activation by flow-cytometry, the expression of 84 T-helper transcription-factors and 84 T-cell related genes by RT-qPCR, and protein expression by Western-blot, before and after 24-hours incubation with increasing doses of atorvastatin: 3-10-26 \u03bcg/ml (corresponding to blood levels achieved with doses of 10-40-80 mg, respectively). After incubation, we found a significant decrease in interferon-\u03b3-producing CD4+CD28nullT-cells (P = 0.009) and a significant increase in interleukin-10-producing CD4+CD25highT-cells (P < 0.001). Atorvastatin increased the expression of 2 genes and decreased the expression of 12 genes (in particular, EGR1, FOS,CCR2 and toll like receptor-4; >3-fold changes).The in-vivo effects of atorvastatin were analyzed in 10 statin-free acute coronary syndrome patients at baseline, and after 24h and 48h of atorvastatin therapy (80 mg/daily): EGR1-gene expression decreased at 24h (P = 0.01) and 48h (P = 0.005); EGR1-protein levels decreased at 48h (P = 0.03).Conclusions-In acute coronary syndromes, the effects of atorvastatin on immune system might be partially related to the inhibition of the master regulator gene EGR1. Our finding might offer a causal explanation on why statins improve the early outcome in acute coronary syndromes.", 
    "103": "The therapeutic use of statins has been associated to a reduced risk of Parkinson's disease (PD) and may hold neuroprotective potential by counteracting the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. Transcriptional activation of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) is one of the major downstream signaling pathways triggered by the cholesterol-lowering effect of statins. In a previous study in neuroblastoma cells, we have shown that statins consistently induce the upregulation of presynaptic dopaminergic proteins and changes of their function and these effects were accompanied by downstream activation of SREBP. In this study, we aimed to determine the direct role of SREBP pathway in the modulation of dopaminergic phenotype. We demonstrate that treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with U18666A, an SREBP activator, increases the translocation of SREBPs into the nucleus, increases the expression of SREBP-1, SREBP-2, and of the presynaptic dopaminergic markers such as vesicular monoamine transporter 2, synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2 A and 2 C, synaptogyrin-3, and tyrosine hydroxylase. The addition of SREBP inhibitor, PF-429242, blocks the increase of U18666A-induced expression of SREBPs and presynaptic markers. Our results, in line with previously reported effects of statins, demonstrate that direct stimulation of SREBP translocation is associated to differentiation toward a dopaminergic-like phenotype and suggest that SREBP-mediated transcriptional activity may lead to the restoration of the presynaptic dopamine markers and may contribute to neuroprotection of dopaminergic neurons. These findings further support the potential protective role of statin in PD and shed light upon SREBP as a potential new target for developing disease-modifying treatment in PD.",

Here we aim to characterise the molecular pathways that influence levels of hexadecanedioate linked to BP regulation, using genetic and transcriptomic studies. The top associations for hexadecanedioate in a genome-wide association scan (GWAS) conducted on 6447 individuals from the TwinsUK and KORA cohorts were tested for association with BP and hypertension in the International Consortium for BP and in a GWAS of BP extremes. Transcriptomic analyses correlating hexadecanedioate with gene expression levels in adipose tissue in 740 TwinsUK participants were further performed. GWAS showed 242 SNPs mapping to two independent loci achieving genome-wide significance. In rs414056 in the SCLO1B1 gene (Beta(SE) = -0.088(0.006)P = 1.65 x 10-51, P < 1 x 10-51), the allele previously associated with increased risk of statin associated myopathy is associated with higher hexadecanedioate levels. However this SNP did not show association with BP or hypertension. The top SNP in the second locus rs6663731 mapped to the intronic region of CYP4Z2P on chromosome 1 (0.045(0.007), P = 5.49x10-11). Hexadecanedioate levels also correlate with adipose tissue gene-expression of the 3 out of 4 CYP4 probes (P<0.05) and of alcohol dehydrogenase probes (Beta(SE) = 0.12(0.02); P = 6.04x10-11). High circulating levels of hexadecanedioate determine a significant effect of alcohol intake on BP (SBP: 1.12(0.34), P = 0.001; DBP: 0.70(0.22), P = 0.002), while no effect is seen in the lower hexadecanedioate level group. In conclusion, levels in fat of ADH1A, ADH1B and CYP4 encoding enzymes in the omega oxidation pathway, are correlated with hexadecanedioate levels. Hexadecanedioate appears to regulate the effect of alcohol on BP.", 
    "124": "The two major goals of the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia are the prevention of cardiovascular disease and pancreatitis. Here we discuss the drugs currently available for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia: (niacin, fibrates, omega-3-fatty acids, and lipoprotein lipase gene therapy (alipogene tiparvovec)). Statins, ezetimibe, PCSK9 inhibitors, lomitapide, and mipomersen, which are primarily used to lower LDL cholesterol, also lower plasma triglyceride levels and are discussed in detail in Chapter 25 \u201cCholesterol Lowering Drugs\u201d. Niacin decreases all the pro-atherogenic lipid and lipoprotein particles including total cholesterol, triglycerides (20-50% decrease), LDL cholesterol, and Lp(a) levels. Additionally, niacin decreases small dense LDL resulting in a shift to large, buoyant LDL particles. Moreover, niacin increases HDL cholesterol levels. Skin flushing, insulin resistance, and other side effects have limited the use of niacin. Moreover, the enthusiasm for the use of niacin has decreased with the failure of AIM-HIGH and HPS-2 Thrive to show a decrease in cardiovascular events when niacin was added to statin therapy. The lipid lowering effects of fish oil are mediated by two omega-3-fatty acids: eicosapentaenoic acid (C20:5n-3) (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (C22:6n-3) (DHA). Omega-3-fatty acids lower triglycerides by 10-50% but do not effect total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, or Lp(a) levels. LDL cholesterol levels may increase with EPA + DHA treatment when the triglyceride levels are markedly elevated (>500mg/dl). EPA alone does not increase LDL cholesterol levels. Omega-3-fatty acids have few side effects, drug interactions, or contraindications. Despite numerous studies the effect of omega-3-fatty acids on cardiovascular outcomes is uncertain but additional studies are underway. Fibrates reduce triglyceride levels by 25-50% and increase HDL cholesterol levels by 5-20%. The effect on LDL cholesterol is variable. If the triglyceride levels are very high (>400-500mg/dl), fibrate therapy may result in an increase in LDL cholesterol levels, whereas if triglycerides are not markedly elevated fibrates decrease LDL cholesterol by 10-30%. Fibrates also reduce apolipoprotein B, LDL particle number, and non-HDL cholesterol levels and there may be a shift from small dense LDL towards large LDL particles. Fibrates do not have any major effects on Lp(a) levels. Due to increased myopathy the combination of gemfibrozil and statins should be avoided but fenofibrate can be used safely with statins. Monotherapy with fibrates appears to reduce cardiovascular events particularly in patients with high triglyceride and low HDL cholesterol levels. Whether the addition of fibrates to statin therapy will reduce cardiovascular disease is uncertain. In patients with diabetes fibrates appear to slow the progression of microvascular disease. Alipogene tiparvovec is a gene therapy approved in Europe for adult patients with Familial Lipoprotein Lipase deficiency and a history of multiple or severe episodes of pancreatitis who have failed dietary therapy. Therapy with alipogene tiparvovec results in the expression of lipoprotein lipase in muscle, which accelerates the clearance of triglyceride rich lipoproteins. Studies have suggested a decrease in episodes of pancreatitis. Thus, a number of drugs are available for the treatment of hypertriglyceridemia and maybe employed when lifestyle changes are not sufficient.", 
    "125": "Over the last quarter century, clinical trials have consistently demonstrated that lowering levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with statins reduce the rate of major adverse cardiovascular events. However, the findings that many patients continue to experience events or harbour inappropriately high LDL-C levels despite intensive statin therapy and the clinical reality of statin intolerance suggests that additional therapeutic strategies are required in order to achieve more effective reductions in cardiovascular risk. The emergence of inhibitory monoclonal antibodies targeted against proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9 (PCSK9) provides a novel approach to reducing LDL-C levels. The current experience of PCSK9 inhibitors and implications for clinical use and cost effectiveness will be reviewed.",

Male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were pretreated with simvastatin (1 mg/kg) for 30 min before the addition of LPS (8 mg/kg), with variations in left ventricular pressure recorded throughout. Ninety min after LPS injection, whole blood was collected from the inferior vena cava, and neutrophils were separated from the whole blood using separating medium. The neutrophils were then lysed for Western blotting to detect the levels of urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1). In addition, mesentery microcirculations of inlet diameter, outlet diameter and blood flow rate were measured in all three groups. The results indicated that simvastatin significantly promoted heart systolic function and increased the level of uPA while simultaneously inhibited the expression of PAI-1 as compared with LPS group. Moreover, simvastatin reversed the LPS-induced inhibition of mesentery microcirculation. Taken together, it was suggested that simvastatin can effectively protect the rats from LPS-induced septic shock.",

The present study investigated the effects of pravastatin on endothelial function and hemorheology in patients with stable angina pectoris (AP) before and after eating a test meal. We recruited 26 patients with stable AP who had impaired glucose tolerance and mild dyslipidemia and six healthy men as controls to assess endothelial function and hemorheological behavior. In each group, we measured forearm blood flow (FBF) during post-ischemic reactive hyperemia and obtained blood samples before and 2\u00a0h after the test meal. Pravastatin 20\u00a0mg/day was then commenced in the 26 AP patients. The above tests were repeated after 2 days and 6 months. Maximum FBF during hyperemia in the baseline fasting phase was significantly lower in the AP patients than in the controls (p\u2009<\u20090.05). Fasting and postprandial FBF during reactive hyperemia time-dependently improved after pravastatin treatment (p\u2009<\u20090.05 vs. baseline data for each phase). Pravastatin treatment for 6 months, but not for 2 days, inhibited leukocyte activation and improved hemorheological parameters. In conclusion, pravastatin treatment for 6 months improved fasting and postprandial endothelial and hemorheological dysfunction in AP patients.",

Thirty-two male rats from a local Wister-derived strain were included in this prospective study and were classified into four groups. Each group consisted of eight animals: Group 1, non-diabetic negative controls; Group 2, diabetic positive controls; Group 3, non-diabetic rats receiving atorvastatin for 4 weeks; and Group 4, diabetic rats receiving atorvastatin for 4 weeks. At the end of the designated period, the animals were sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and the kidneys were excised and homogenized to determine the level of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10, and PGE2. The study duration was from June 2015 to May 2016 at Al-Ahlyya Amman University, Amman, Jordan. In the kidneys of rats with streptozotocin-induced diabets, the levels of cytokines IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-10, and PGE2 were significantly elevated above those of the control group. This clearly showed a detrimental effect of diabetes on the kidney. Treatment of diabetic rats with atorvastatin caused a decrease in all evaluated cytokines to levels near control values. Our data suggest that atorvastatin has the potential to protect or attenuate diabetes-induced renal injury. However, the possible protective effect of atorvastatin should be supported by clinical evidence.",

We reviewed 294 consecutive cases of TAVR performed at a single tertiary care medical center. We defined high-intensity statin therapy as atorvastatin 40 to 80\u00a0mg/day or rosuvastatin 20 to 40\u00a0mg/day. Study outcomes included post-TAVR adverse events, 30-day mortality, and overall survival. At the time of TAVR, 14% (n\u00a0= 41) were on high-intensity statin therapy, 59% (n\u00a0= 173) were on low- or moderate-intensity statin therapy, and 27% (n\u00a0= 80) were not on statin therapy. There was no association between statin therapy and the rate of post-TAVR stroke, myocardial infarction, acute kidney injury, in-hospital mortality, or 30-day mortality. At 2\u00a0years, 83% of patients in the high-intensity statin group were alive, 70% in the low/moderate-intensity statin group were alive, and 57% in the no statin group were alive (log-rank p\u00a0= 0.016).

Therefore, there is need for safe and effective novel therapies for the pharmacological management of hypercholesterolaemia, in addition or as alternative to lipid-lowering therapies (LLT) currently in use. Areas covered: In 2015, the Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency approved alirocumab (Praluent\u00ae; Sanofi), a fully human monoclonal antibody against proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemic patients unable to meet LDL-C targets, as an adjunct to diet in addition/alternative to LLT. The authors review the pharmacological features, clinical efficacy, and safety of alirocumab in lowering LDL-C, and discuss its therapeutic perspectives based on the most recent clinical trials. Expert commentary: Alirocumab causes a marked reduction in LDL-C, presents good safety and tolerability, and represents a promising approach for LDL-C lowering, particularly in patients with intolerance to statin or elevated LDL-C despite maximal statin therapy; nevertheless, further long-term data on safety and efficacy are necessary, such as data on the improvement of cardiovascular outcomes.",

Yet, certain data indicate that these symptoms often present in populations with underlying musculoskeletal complaints and are not likely statin related. Switching statins or using lower doses resolves muscle complaints in most patients. However, there is a growing population of individuals who experience intolerable musculoskeletal symptoms with multiple statins, regardless of the individual agent or prescribed dose. Recent randomized, placebo-controlled trials enrolling highly intolerant subjects provide significant insight regarding statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS). Notable findings include the inconsistency with reproducing muscle complaints, as approximately 40% of subjects report SAMS when taking a statin but not while receiving placebo, but a substantial cohort reports intolerable muscle symptoms with placebo but none when on a statin. These data validate SAMS for those likely experiencing true intolerance, but for others, suggest a psychosomatic component or misattribution of the source of pain and highlights the importance of differentiating from the musculoskeletal symptoms caused by concomitant factors. Managing the highly intolerant requires candid patient counseling, shared decision-making, eliminating contributing factors, careful clinical assessment and the use of a myalgia index score, and isolating potential muscle-related adverse events by gradually reintroducing drug therapy with the utilization of intermittent dosing of lipid-altering agents. We provide a review of recent data and therapeutic guidance involving a focused step-by-step approach for managing SAMS among the highly intolerant.

This has been accompanied by changes in disease characteristics including more non-ST segment elevation myocardial infraction and less vulnerable plaques as assessed by histological analysis of surgical specimens. However, many patients with established disease still suffer from recurrent cardiovascular events in spite of treatment with state-of-the-art-therapy including statins. It is likely that this reflects a state of the disease in which statins control the pro-inflammatory effects of lipids allowing other statin-unresponsive disease mechanisms to become increasingly important. If this assumption is correct it means that patients with established disease with time will get insuffient protection by current therapies alone. Against this background it is critical to reach a better understanding of alternative mechanisms for plaque vulnerability. Examples of such mechanisms include altered patterns of blood flow caused by plaque stenosis resulting in down-regulation of the anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic signals in the endothelium, impaired vascular repair associated with diabetes and plaque inflammation driven by cholesterol crystals, infectious pathogens as well as autoimmune responses against modified plaque components. Novel biomarkers and other diagnostics are needed to establish the clinical importance of these mechanisms as well as to determine how they are affected by current treatments. Consequently, there will also be a need for development of new treatments targeting these mechanisms and that can act in concert with current therapies.",

However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Herein, we show that HDLs, not LDLs, significantly decreased the apoptosis of human Tregs in vitro, whereas they did not alter na\u00efve or memory CD4(+) T cell survival. Similarly, oleic acid bound to serum albumin increased Treg survival. Tregs bound and internalized high amounts of HDL compared with other subsets, which might arise from the higher expression of the scavenger receptor class B type I by Tregs; accordingly, blocking this receptor hindered HDL-mediated Treg survival. Mechanistically, we showed that HDL increased Treg ATP concentration and mitochondrial activity, enhancing basal respiration, maximal respiration, and spare respiratory capacity. Blockade of FA oxidation by etoxomir abolished the HDL-mediated enhanced survival and mitochondrial activity. Our findings thus suggest that Tregs can specifically internalize HDLs from their microenvironment and use them as an energy source. Furthermore, a novel implication of our data is that enhanced Treg survival may contribute to HDLs' anti-inflammatory properties.", 
    "246": "Nowadays, obesity is seriously increasing in most of the populations all over the world, and is associated with the development and progression of high-mortality diseases such as type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its subsequent cardiovascular pathologies. Recent data suggest that both body fat distribution and adipocyte phenotype, can be more determinant for fatal outcomes in obese patients than increased general adiposity. In particular, visceral adiposity is significantly linked to long term alterations on different cardiac structures, and in developed forms of myocardial diseases such as hypertensive and ischaemic heart diseases, and diabetic cardiomyopathy. Interestingly, this depot may be also related to epicardial fat accumulation through secretion of lipids, adipokines, and pro-inflammatory and oxidative factors from adipocytes. Thus, visceral adiposity and its white single-lipid-like adipocytes, are risk factors for different forms of heart disease and heart failure, mainly in higher degree obese subjects. However, under specific stimuli, some of these adipocytes can transdifferentiate to brown multi-mitochondrial-like adipocytes with anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic proprieties. Accordingly, in order to improve potential cardiovascular abnormalities in obese and T2DM patients, several therapeutic strategies have been addressed to modulate the visceral and epicardial fat volume and phenotypes. In addition to lifestyle modifications, specific genetic manipulations in adipose tissue and administration of PPAR\u03b3 agonists or statins, have improved fat volume and phenotype, and cardiovascular failures. Furthermore, incretin stimulation reduced visceral and epicardial fat thickness whereas increased formation of brown adipocytes, alleviating insulin resistance and associated cardiovascular pathologies.",

Mean baseline PCSK9 levels were higher with high versus moderate and low statin doses (318.5 vs 280.6 ng/mL). Baseline LDL-C levels were similar across pools, regardless of statin intensity. No associations were observed between statin type/dose and LDL-C % change from baseline or % of patients achieving LDL-C goals at Week 24 for alirocumab versus control (interaction P-values non-significant).

Non-randomized studies in clinical settings support these findings, but large, long-term, observational studies addressing CVD and non-CVD endpoints are lacking. In this retrospective longitudinal study, we followed ACS patients in Sweden during 2001-2012 using national health registry and medical record data. A total of 49,857 patients were identified, of whom 10,092 (20.2%) received high dose statins and 21,174 (42.7%) received no statins. Royston-Parmar parametric time-to-event models were implemented to model hazard for second CVD events and death, stratified by gender and diabetes diagnosis. We found that risk of a second CVD event developed similarly in both treatment groups, but was much higher in the no statin group. Risk of CVD-related death remained relatively constant for the high-statin group, while it increased over time for the no-statin group. Interestingly, males had higher mortality rates in the no-statin group, but not in the high-statin group. All-cause mortality and non-CVD-related death followed similar trends to those observed for CVD-related death.

Data on hospitalisations and diagnoses were collected from the Stockholm County Council administrative databases on healthcare consumption. Dispensed prescriptions with statins and, for comparative purposes, antihypertensive agents 9-12\u00a0months after discharge were acquired from the National Swedish Prescribed Drug Register.

We ascertained the prior statin use of cases and controls through a prescription registry. Based on this information, exposure to statins was categorized into 'ever use' or 'never use'. Ever use of statins was classified by how recently they had been used ('current use' or 'past use'); current use was further classified into long-term use (5+ years) and high- or low-intensity use.

Despite the broad impact of inflammation on acute and chronic clinical manifestations of SCA, no directed anti-inflammatory therapies currently exist. Statins are cholesterol-lowering agents shown to confer protection from vascular injury by suppressing inflammation. We previously documented a reduction in soluble biomarkers of inflammation in patients with sickle cell disease treated with simvastatin. To determine the potential clinical efficacy of simvastatin, we treated 19 SCA patients with single daily dose simvastatin for 3\u00a0months and assessed changes from baseline in the frequency and intensity of diary-reported pain and levels of circulating nitric oxide metabolites (NOx), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), ICAM-3, E-selectin, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Treatment with simvastatin resulted in a significant reduction in the frequency of pain (P\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b70003), oral analgesic use (P\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b7003) and circulating hs-CRP (P\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b7003), soluble (s)E-selectin (P\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b701), sICAM-1 (P\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b702), sICAM-3 (P\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b702) and sVEGF (P\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b701). Simvastatin had no effect on pain intensity or levels of NOx, sP-selectin and sVCAM-1. The observed reductions in pain rate and markers of inflammation were greatest in subjects receiving hydroxycarbamide (HC), suggesting a synergistic effect of simvastatin. These results provide preliminary clinical data\u00a0to support a larger trial of simvastatin in SCA.",

Eight eligible studies comprising of 103\u2009576 participants and 13\u2009168 recurrent VTE outcomes were included in the pooled analysis. In pooled analysis of 7 studies, the RR for recurrent VTE was 0.73 (0.68-0.79) when comparing statin use with no use. There was no evidence of heterogeneity between contributing studies (I2=0%, 0-71%; P\u2009=\u20090.93). The RRs for recurrent PE (three studies) and DVT (two studies) comparing statin use with no statin use were 0.75 (95% CI: 0.58-0.96) and 0.66 (95% CI: 0.60-0.71) respectively.",
