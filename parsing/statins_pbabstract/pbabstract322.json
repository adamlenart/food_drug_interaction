Combination treatment with both statin and fibrate has been shown to enhance achieving of recommended targets in these patients with high-risk of coronary heart disease. On the other hand unpleasant side effects including myopathy and rhabdomyolysis were described in some cases after statin-fibrate combination therapy. Aim of the study was to evaluate efficacy and safety of long-term treatment of pravastatin + fenofibrate or simvastatin + ciprofibrate therapy in the high-risk group of patients with severe mixed hyperlipoproteinemia.", 
    "1": "A set of 86 patients (55 M/31 F) was followed for a period at least one year (median 3 years). These patients were randomly assigned to combination of pravastatin 20 mg + fenofibrate 200 mg (n = 46) (group A), or simvastatin 20 mg + ciprofibrate 100 mg (n = 40) (group B). We have observed significant reduction in plasma TC (22% in group A, 20% in group B), in LDL-C (36%, resp. 33%), reduction of TG (44%, resp. 46%), apo-B (35%, resp. 33%) whilst HDL-C significantly increased (18%, resp. 16%). Concomitantly we have seen significant decreases in uricaemia (14%, resp. 18%). No patient needed to stop treatment due to abnormalities in liver function tests. Levels of creatinkinase became non-significantly elevated (by 16%, resp. 13%). No patient exhibited myopathy or rhabdomyolysis.",

Both combinations seemed to be similarly efficient and safe.", 
    "3": "Monascus, a traditional Chinese fermentation fungus, is used as a natural dietary supplement. Its metabolic products monacolin K and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) have each been proven to be a cholesterol-lowering drug and a hypotensive agent. Citrinin, another secondary metabolite, is toxic to humans, thus lowering the acceptability of red mold rice to the general public. In this study, the influence of different carbon and nitrogen sources, and fatty acid or oils, on the production of monacolin K, citrinin and GABA by Monascus purpureus NTU 601 was studied. When 0.5% ethanol was added to the culture medium, the production of citrinin decreased from 813 ppb to 561 ppb while monacolin K increased from 136 mg/kg to 383 mg/kg and GABA increased from 1,060 mg/kg to 7,453 mg/kg. In addition, response surface methodology was used to optimize culture conditions for monacolin K, citrinin and GABA production, and data were collected according to a three-factor (temperature, ethanol concentration and amount of water supplemented), three-level central composite design. When 500 g rice was used as a solid substrate with 120 ml water and 0.3% ethanol, the production of monacolin K at 30 degrees C increased from 136 mg/kg to 530 mg/kg, GABA production increased from 1,060 mg/kg to 5,004 mg/kg and citrinin decreased from 813 ppb to 460 ppb.", 
    "4": "3-hydroxy-3-methyglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, 'statins' are widely used oral cholesterol-lowering drugs. Statins competitively inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, the enzyme that catalyzes conversion of HMG-CoA to L-mevalonate, a key intermediate in cholesterol synthesis. Certain metabolites of mevalonate are also involved in posttranslational modification of specific proteins involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. Thus, statins have important biologic effects that may be independent of their cholesterol-reducing properties. Recent studies indicate that statins have antiinflammatory and neuroprotective properties which may be beneficial in the treatment of multiple sclerosis as well as other central nervous system (CNS) neurodegenerative diseases. This article will outline current experimental evidence that may suggest potential clinical benefits for patients with CNS autoimmune disorders. Ultimately, clinical trials will have to determine the safety and efficacy of statins in this patient population.",

In addition, in 78 patients with hypercholesterolemia who took 5 mg simvastatin, the TC lowering effect by simvastatin in subjects with the Arg/Arg homozygotes was significantly lower than in those with the Arg/Gln heterozygotes and Gln/Gln homozygotes (the reduction in serum TC levels; 62+/-4 vs. 79+/-6, P=0.044).", 
    "10": "We demonstrate that Ob-R Arg223Gln polymorphism in Japanese men is associated with significant elevation of serum TC and LDL-C levels. Our data also show that the Arg/Arg homozygotes tend to show lowered level of serum HDL-C. Furthermore, this polymorphism tends to show an attenuated response to an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor in terms of the cholesterol lowering effect. These results suggest that the Ob-R gene may serve as a novel modifier gene for hypercholesterolemia in Japanese men.",

    "13": "Quite surprisingly, the drug negatively affected the wasting pattern induced by the AH-130 hepatoma. In fact, the administration of simvastatin to tumor hosts induced a further weight reduction of all the tissues examined except for the soleus, in the absence of significant effects of simvastatin on tumor growth or on food intake. No effects were observed after simvastatin administration in control animals, with the exception of a significant (P < 0.05) reduction in heart weight.", 
    "14": "Simvastatin administration, although capable of negatively modulating the inflammatory response, did not prevent muscle wasting in this experimental model of cancer cachexia. Moreover, the further muscle loss observed in simvastatin-treated tumor-bearing animals suggests that a note of caution should be introduced in treating cancer patients with statins in view of the possible occurrence of harmful side effects.", 
    "15": "Reductions in low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) result from diets containing almonds, or diets that are either low in saturated fat or high in viscous fibers, soy proteins, or plant sterols. We have therefore combined all of these interventions in a single diet (portfolio diet) to determine whether cholesterol reductions could be achieved of similar magnitude to those reported in recent statin trials which reduced cardiovascular events. Twenty-five hyperlipidemic subjects consumed either a portfolio diet (n=13), very low in saturated fat and high in plant sterols (1.2 g/1,000 kcal), soy protein (16.2 g/1,000 kcal), viscous fibers (8.3 g/1,000 kcal), and almonds (16.6 g/1,000 kcal), or a low-saturated fat diet (n=12) based on whole-wheat cereals and low-fat dairy foods. Fasting blood, blood pressure, and body weight were obtained at weeks 0, 2, and 4 of each phase. LDL-C was reduced by 12.1% +/- 2.4% (P<.001) on the low-fat diet and by 35.0% +/- 3.1% (P<.001) on the portfolio diet, which also reduced the ratio of LDL-C to high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) significantly (30.0% +/- 3.5%; P<.001). The reductions in LDL-C and the LDL:HDL-C ratio were both significantly lower on the portfolio diet than on the control diet (P<.001 and P<.001, respectively). Mean weight loss was similar on test and control diets (1.0 kg and 0.9 kg, respectively). No difference was seen in blood pressure, HDL-C, serum triglycerides, lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], or homocysteine concentrations between diets. Combining a number of foods and food components in a single dietary portfolio may lower LDL-C similarly to statins and so increase the potential effectiveness of dietary therapy.", 
    "16": "Classically, the statins are the first choice drugs when treating dyslipidemias, especially in patients with hypercholesterolemia alone or accompanied by hypertriglyceridemia. The recent evidence of the effectiveness, safety and impact comes from hard endpoints, as demonstrated in 6 trials which included more than 40,000 subjects. The statins are being recommended for the treatment of a large number of patients with overt coronary heart disease, regardless of serum cholesterol levels, in patients with acute phases of coronary syndromes, and in patients without apparent coronary heart disease with moderate risk and average serum cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels. These drugs are also being prescribed to patients with high-risk medical conditions that are \"equivalent to coronary heart disease,\" like diabetes, lower limb atherosclerosis, or vascular cerebral disease, independent of the basal serum cholesterol levels or LDL cholesterol ranging from normal to high. Despite all the evidence collected as to the efficacy and safety of these drugs, the statins are not sufficiently used in daily practice, probably due to the ignorance of new concepts and the doubts related to the safety that may be cleared by careful analysis of 6 major studies with these drugs.", 
    "17": "Calcium antagonists are effective in hypertensive patients of all ethnic groups, irrespective of age, dietary salt intake, salt-sensitivity status or plasma renin activity profile. Some prospective studies show that the calcium antagonists, nifedipine GITS and nitrendipine, reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality at least to the same extent as the diuretics. Other prospective studies are in progress to evaluate the effect of calcium antagonists on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and the progression of atherosclerosis in hypertensive patients. Calcium antagonists, especially the highly lipophilic amlodipine, lacidipine and nisoldipine, are shown to possess antioxidant properties. These drugs reduce the oxidation of LDL and its influx into the arterial wall, and reduce atherosclerotic lesions in animals. Platelet production of malondialdehyde, a marker of oxygen free radical formation, is suppressed by amlodipine, lacidipine or nifedipine in hypertensive patients. New evidence from long-term clinical trials of calcium antagonists indicates that these drugs can reduce the rate of progression of atherosclerosis in hypertensive and coronary heart disease patients. In the Regression Growth Evaluation Statin Study (REGRESS), co-administration of calcium antagonist, amlodipine or nifedipine with pravasatin caused a significant reduction in the appearance of new angiographic lesions. In the Verapamil in Hypertension and Atherosclerosis Study (VHAS), verapamil was more effective than chlorthalidone in promoting regression of thicker carotid lesions in parallel with a reduction in the incidence of cardiovascular events. In the Prospective Randomized Evaluation of the Vascular Effects of Norvasc Trial (PREVENT), amlodipine slowed the progression of early coronary atherosclerosis in patients with coronary artery disease. In a subprotocol of the Intervention as a Goal in the Hypertension Treatment (INSIGHT) study, nifedipine GITS significantly decreased intima-media thickness as compared to co-amilozide (hydrochlorothiazide + amiloride). Preliminary results of the European Lacidipine Study on Atherosclerosis (ELSA) show that lacidipine reduced the intima-media thickness progression rate as compared to atenolol. Thus, selective calcium antagonists are potential antiatherosclerotic agents.",

It has strong antioxidant properties equipotent to those of probucol and antiinflammatory properties. It inhibits gene expression of VCAM-1 and MCP-1 and has been effective at preventing atherosclerosis in all tested animal models including the non-human primate. In the Canadian Antioxidant Restenosis Trial (CART) 1, AGI-1067 and probucol improved lumen dimensions at the site of percutaneous coronary intervention. AGI-1067 also improved luminal dimensions of non-intervened coronary reference segments in the Canadian Antioxidant Restenosis Trial, which suggests a direct antiatherosclerosis effect. Probucol reduced post-percutaneous coronary intervention restenosis and progression of carotid atherosclerosis in other clinical trials. Although statins reduce atherosclerotic events, they do not appear to have a significant effect on restenosis. The failure of folate therapy to protect against restenosis in the Folate After Coronary Intervention Trial (FACIT) occurred despite significant reductions in homocysteine levels.",

Two important trials that test the antioxidant/antiinflammatory hypothesis are ongoing with AGI-1067: the Canadian Atherosclerosis and Restenosis Trial 2, which assesses its value for the reduction of both atherosclerosis progression and post-percutaneous coronary interventions restenosis, and the Aggressive Reduction of Inflammation Stops Events (ARISE) trial which is evaluating its effects on cardiovascular events.", 
    "21": "Several lines of evidence have demonstrated an association between a variety of chronic bacterial infections and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. This has led to the proposal that antibiotic therapy might be helpful in the secondary prevention of atherosclerosis. A variety of smaller pilot studies have been reported testing this hypothesis and several large multicenter trials are also underway. The purpose of this review is to summarize the results of these studies and comment on their implications for the treatment of atherosclerosis.", 
    "22": "Most of the antibiotic studies to date have been secondary prevention studies that have targeted patients exposed to Chlamydia pneumoniae. Most have used either azithromycin or roxithromycin with treatment courses ranging from a few days to 3 months. Several small studies of coronary artery disease patients have shown significant promise for reducing cardiovascular events such as death, myocardial infarction, or admission for unstable angina. However, other studies have not been so positive. Weekly Intervention with Zithromax for Atherosclerosis and its Related Disorders, WIZARD, the largest study to date, in which stable post-myocardial infarction patients were randomized to receive a 3-month course of azithromycin or placebo, demonstrated a significant reduction in death and myocardial infarction by 6 months, but this benefit was not sustained throughout the remaining course of follow-up. The Azithromycin and Coronary Events (ACES) and Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy (PROVE-IT) trials are ongoing and are testing the effect of more prolonged treatment duration.", 
    "23": "A variety of antibiotic trials for the secondary prevention of atherosclerosis have been performed. Several pilot studies have shown significant positive clinical effects, but, thus far, no large randomized trial has confirmed those findings. Some concerns over the antibiotics chosen and the duration of treatment have been raised. Other trials are underway to address some of those concerns. In the meantime, no recommendation for the use of antibiotic therapy for the secondary prevention of atherosclerosis can yet be made.",

This paper reviews the available data on these effects and discusses the potential intracellular mechanisms involved.", 
    "25": "Experimental studies have clearly shown that statins protect against ischaemia-reperfusion injury of the heart, and exert pro-angiogenic effects by stimulating the growth of new blood vessels in ischaemic limbs of normocholesterolemic animals. The mechanisms underlying these serum lipid-independent statin effects are not completely understood, but there is increasing evidence that statins improve endothelial function through molecular mechanisms that mediate an increase in endothelium-derived nitric oxide. Recent research has revealed a link between statins and the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt that regulates multiple angiogenic processes in endothelial cells. In contrast to these data, it has also been reported that higher doses of statins can inhibit endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis.", 
    "26": "Statins have biphasic potential either to promote or inhibit angiogenesis. Low statin doses induce a pro-angiogenic effect through Akt activation and increase nitric oxide production, whereas high statin doses may decrease protein prenylation and inhibit cell growth. Notwithstanding, the clinical relevance of these serum lipid-independent effects is not fully understood. Further studies on the actions of statins on endothelial cells may lead to the identification of new pharmacological targets for the control of angiogenesis.",

This differed sharply from the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial, Lipid Lowering Arm, which was stopped before the planned termination due to a marked reduction (36%) in coronary death or myocardial infarction (primary endpoint). This trial also found significant reductions in stroke (27%) and separately, all major vascular events (21%). The two studies were similar in that they each contained over 10 000 participants with documented high blood pressure requiring drug therapy and they both used a fixed dose of a single statin. Pravastatin (40 mg/day) was used in the former and atorvastatin 10 mg/day in the latter. The major difference was that the control group in the Anglo-Scandinavian trial was treated with placebo with a double blind design whereas antihypertensive and lipid-lowering trial was open label with controls receiving usual care.", 
    "29": "The benefit of achieving and maintaining significant LDL cholesterol reduction in patients with high blood pressure was convincingly demonstrated in the Anglo-Scandinavian trial. The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial failed to achieve similar success due to use of a less effective drug and loss of the differential effect with increasing statin treatment in the usual care control group.", 
    "30": "Subgroups with diabetes or with features of the metabolic syndrome have been increasingly highlighted in large clinical endpoint trials with lipid therapy. This review will focus on the results of trials with statins or fibrates and examine the strength of the evidence for major cardiovascular event reduction with each kind of therapy in these high-risk subgroups that typically have low-to-moderate levels of LDL cholesterol.", 
    "31": "Of six statin trials in populations with moderately increased LDL cholesterol only one, the Heart Protection Study, has shown that statin therapy will significantly reduce the major coronary heart disease events of non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary heart disease death in diabetes. None of these trials has shown that statins have a particular predilection for reducing cardiovascular events in individuals with higher levels of body weight or other features of the metabolic syndrome. There are far fewer trial data with fibrates than with statins. However, the Veterans Affairs High Density Lipoprotein Intervention Trial has shown that a fibrate can significantly reduce major cardiovascular events, most particularly coronary heart disease death, in those with diabetes as well as those without diabetes who have insulin resistance. Indeed, all fibrate trials show that this therapy appears to selectively benefit the individual with obesity and features of the metabolic syndrome.", 
    "32": "Based principally on evidence from the Veterans Affairs High Density Lipoprotein Intervention Trial and the cumulative experience with statins, trial data would thus far suggest that the patient with a modest increase in LDL cholesterol who has diabetes or features of the metabolic syndrome might be likely to achieve more substantial cardiovascular benefit from fibrate than from statin therapy.", 
    "33": "This study assessed hemostatic effects of an HMC-CoA reductase inhibitor, atorvastatin, on different parameters in 32 hypercholesterolemic patients of both sexes. In the patients and in 25 control subjects, plasma levels of tissue-type plasminogen activator, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1), D-dimer, prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 (F1 + 2), total cholesterol, triglycerides and fibrinogen had been measured. All these parameters were evaluated in patients after 6 and 12 months of treatment with atorvastatin at a dosage of 20 mg/day. This treatment significantly lowered the total cholesterol level in all patients. Moreover, after 6 months of atorvastatin treatment, PAI-1 and F1 + 2, which were both increased at baseline, were significantly reduced. This reduction continued after 12 months. The present results show that a reduction of hemostatic abnormalities, which exist in hypercholesterolemia, may be another important effect of the atorvastatin therapy.",

In this study we used heart rate variability analysis to determine the effect of lipid lowering by statins on the response of the heart to parasympathetic stimulation. In parallel, we examined whether changes in parasympathetic responsiveness correlated with changes in the expression of Galpha(i2), a molecular component of the parasympathetic signaling pathway in the heart.", 
    "38": "Patients were randomized in a crossover study of pravastatin and simvastatin. R-R interval analysis of Holter monitor studies demonstrated that in patients treated initially with pravastatin, the peak high-frequency power fraction during sleep, which reflects parasympathetic modulation of heart rate, increased by 24.0+/-5.02% (SEM, n=13, P<0.001) compared with the untreated control value. Simvastatin had no significant effect. Western blot analysis of lymphocytes from patients treated with pravastatin demonstrated a 90.1+/-27.3% (n=10, P=0.009) increase in Galpha(i2) expression, whereas simvastatin had no effect. Relative changes in Galpha(i2) correlated significantly with the changes in the fraction of high-frequency power (rho=0.574, P=0.016).",

We have previously shown that levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), the major physiologic inhibitor of fibrinolysis, are increased with atherogenic metabolic derangement. Because the liver is one of the major sources of circulating PAI-1, we here examined the effects of two proinflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-1beta, and IL-6, on PAI-1 production in a human hepatoma cell line, HepG2. IL-1beta (1 ng/ml) and IL-6 (1 ng/ml) increased the accumulation of PAI-1 in the conditioned media over 24 h (IL-1beta: 2.1 +/- 0.2 (mean +/- SD) fold over the control; IL-6:1.4 +/- 0.2 fold; Western blot, p < 0.05). The increase in PAI-1 protein accumulation correlated with the increased expression of PAI-1 mRNA (Northern blot). An HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (mevastatin, 10 micromol/l) attenuated the PAI-1 production induced by IL-1beta and IL-6. The plasma PAI-1 activity level was higher in hypertensives than in normotensives (10.0 +/- 9.8 AU/ml vs. 6.2 +/- 4.5 AU/ml, p < 0.05). The plasma PAI-1 antigen level was also higher in hypertensives than in normotensives (30.9 +/- 22.4 ng/ml vs. 24.4 +/- 13.3 ng/ml, p < 0.05). Thus, 1) IL-1beta and IL-6 can increase PAI-1 production in hepatic cells and 2) mevastatin may exert anti-thrombotic effects by decreasing the PAI-1 protein production induced by these proinflammatory cytokines. These results provide further insights into how inflammation is involved in the atherothrombotic complications observed in hypertensives, which may be ameliorated by HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.", 
    "57": "Ezetimibe is the first agent of a novel class of selective cholesterol absorption inhibitors recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment in the United States. Ezetimibe inhibits the absorption of biliary and dietary cholesterol from the small intestine without affecting the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, triglycerides, or bile acids. Ezetimibe localizes at the brush border of the small intestine and decreases cholesterol uptake into the enterocytes. Preclinical studies demonstrated lipid-lowering properties of ezetimibe as monotherapy and showed a synergistic effect in combination with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins). The efficacy and safety of ezetimibe 10 mg/day have been established in phase III clinical trials. In these trials, ezetimibe was investigated as monotherapy, as an add-on to ongoing statin therapy, and as combination therapy with statins in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia. In addition, ezetimibe has been evaluated in patients with homozygous and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and in those with sitosterolemia. When given as monotherapy or in combination with statins or fenofibrate, ezetimibe reduces low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) by 15-20% while increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 2.5-5%. Unlike other intestinally acting lipid-lowering agents, ezetimibe does not adversely affect triglyceride levels and, due to its minimal systemic absorption, drug interactions are few. Ezetimibe's side-effect profile resembles that of placebo when given as monotherapy or in combination with statins. In clinical practice, ezetimibe has a role as monotherapy for patients who require modest LDL reductions or cannot tolerate other lipid-lowering agents. In combination therapy with a statin, ezetimibe is used in patients who cannot tolerate high statin doses or in those who need additional LDL reductions despite maximum statin doses.", 
    "58": "Statins are widely used in clinical practice because they are effective in the prevention of cardiovascular events. Most likely, these beneficial effects are due not only to an improved lipid profile bud also to direct vascular actions. Statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, which is a rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate-cholesterol pathway. Activation of this pathway leeds to the production of intermediates such is all-trans geranyl-geranyl pyrophosphate. This intermediate activates Rho by post-translational modification, a process of which is inhibited by statins. Recent findings on statin-induced inhibition of Rho/Rho-kinase and activation of Akt provide new insights into the protective action of statins in acute coronary syndromes.",

None of the treatments had any significant effect on HDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Only raloxifene significantly reduced Lp(a) [18% (1-36)] and ICAM-1 [17% (8-25)] and VCAM-1 [24% (15-33)] plasma levels compared to baseline (p = 0.019, p < 0.0001 and p = 0.003, respectively). Hyperemic blood flow response on raloxifene was significantly higher compared to baseline [52% (0-105)], (p < 0.05), whereas no significant change was noted on simvastatin. Endothelium independent blood flow induced by nitroglycerine was not influenced by either active treatment.",

Endothelial functions were assessed with high-resolution vascular ultrasound, which measured the brachial artery flow mediated dilatation (FMD). Lipid measurements, symptom limited exercise tests and vascular ultrasound images were obtained before and at the end of 3 months. After the treatment, FMD improved significantly in pravastatin group. Exercise duration, and time to 1mm-ST depression were significantly prolonged after statin therapy.

However, there were no significant changes in FMD and exercise parameters in placebo group.",

    "78": "Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) guidelines recommend specific treatment targets for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels according to an individual.s short-term and long-term risk for coronary heart disease (CHD). Therapeutic lifestyle changes are recommended for all patients at any level of risk for CHD. Although most patients will achieve some LDL-C lowering with lifestyle modification, ATP III recognizes that a majority of patients with dyslipidemia will require drug therapy to reach their LDL goal. Surveys of physicians. practices suggest that only a small percentage of patients enrolled in an active treatment program actually achieve their LDL-C target. In addition, other surveys suggest that not all patients who are treatment candidates are receiving assessment. From a medication perspective, either up-titration of statin dose or the use of drug combinations should further enhance the likelihood of achieving target lipid levels. Combination therapies that target both the endogenous and exogenous pathways of cholesterol synthesis are particularly attractive. This paper reviews the pharmacotherapeutic effects of combination therapy, summarizes the strengths and weaknesses of current lipid-lowering drug combinations, and identifies the potential contribution of the novel cholesterol absorption inhibitor, ezetimibe, to the LDL-C treatment algorithm.", 
    "79": "Since 1988, the National Cholesterol Education Program has identified low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) as the target of therapy; the new Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) guidelines continue the tradition of matching the aggressiveness of LDL-lowering therapy according to the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). A significant change in the new guidelines is the definition of.CHD risk equivalents. and the inclusion of a modified Framingham global risk score. These revisions significantly raise the number of patients who qualify for lipid-lowering therapy. ATP III recognizes statins as the drug of first choice for LDL-C lowering. Statins are proven to be safe and effective for LDL-C reduction and are proven to reduce CHD event rates and mortality. Some patients are not candidates for statin therapy, however, and must rely on nonstatin agents that are less effective in reducing LDL-C, less safe, or poorly tolerated. Consequently, new cholesterol-lowering therapies are needed. Ezetimibe, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2002, is the first in a new class of selective cholesterol absorption inhibitors and offers a novel approach to the treatment of dyslipidemia. Phase 2 data demonstrated that ezetimibe lowers LDL-C by 18% and has a tolerability and short-term safety profile similar to placebo. This paper reviews the cholesterol metabolic pathways and the mechanism of action of the currently available lipid-modifying agents and introduces ezetimibe, the first selective cholesterol absorption inhibitor.", 
    "80": "Although the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) guidelines stress the importance of nonpharmacologic lipid modification interventions such as diet and exercise, the guidelines also recognize that many patients will require drug therapy to achieve low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) target goals. Currently available lipid-modifying drugs include bile acid sequestrants (or resins), fibrates, nicotinic acid, and statins, with each class exerting different effects on the lipid profile. In addition, nonprescription agents such as plant stanols and sterols have been shown to be effective in modifying plasma lipids. Of these agents, the statins are the most effective, most widely prescribed, and best-tolerated form of lipid-lowering drug therapy. New formulations of other drugs, such as niacin and bile acid sequestrants, can also improve treatment regimes and reduce side effects, thereby improving patient compliance with these therapies. In patients who have high levels of LDL-C and triglycerides together with low concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), combination therapy may be required. Ezetimibe, a selective cholesterol absorption inhibitor, is the first of a new class of lipid-lowering agents and provides a new agent for the management of patients with dyslipidemia. Data from the ezetimibe clinical development program suggests that this agent can be used alone or in combination with statins to reduce LDL-C, improve compliance, and bring more patients to ATP III target goal.", 
    "81": "Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) have thrombogenic properties in vivo, through their interactions with soluble coagulation factors and their ability to modulate the functions of cells involved in coagulation homeostasis. These antibodies have also been shown to enhance the adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells (ECs) in vivo. New lipophilic statins such as fluvastatin have antiinflammatory and antithrombogenic effects. This study uses an in vivo mouse model to investigate whether fluvastatin has an effect on decreasing both the adhesion of leukocytes to ECs and the thrombus formation induced by aPL.", 
    "82": "Two groups of CD-1 male mice, each comprising approximately 18 mice, were fed either normal saline solution or 15 mg/kg fluvastatin for 15 days. Each of the 2 groups was further subdivided to receive either purified IgG from patients with the antiphospholipid syndrome (IgG-APS) or normal IgG from healthy subjects. Analysis of thrombus dynamics was performed in treated and control mice, using a standardized thrombogenic injury procedure, and the area (size) of the thrombus was measured. Adhesion of leukocytes to ECs was analyzed with a microcirculation model of exposed cremaster muscle. Baseline and posttreatment soluble intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (sICAM-1) levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.",

    "85": "The inhibition by imatinib of the cytochrome p450 3A4 isoenzyme may reduce the CYP3A4-mediated metabolic clearance of clinically important coadministered drugs. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of the coadministration of imatinib on the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin, a probe CYP3A4 substrate. In total, 20 patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia received an oral dose of 40 mg of simvastatin on study day 1. On study days 2-7, each patient received 400 mg of imatinib once daily orally and on study day 8, 400 mg imatinib together with 40 mg of simvastatin was given. Blood levels of simvastatin were measured predose and for 24 h postdose on study days 1 and 8. Two additional blood samples were taken for imatinib pharmacokinetic (PK) assessment on day 8 before, and 24 h after, imatinib administration. Imatinib increased the mean maximum concentration (C(max)) value of simvastatin two-fold and the area under concentration-time curve (AUC ((0-inf))) value 3.5-fold (P<0.001) compared with simvastatin alone. There was a statistically significant decrease in total-body clearance of drug from the plasma (CL/F) with a mean reduction of 70% for simvastatin (P<0.001): the mean half-life of simvastatin was prolonged from 1.4-2.7 h when given together with imatinib. No changes in imatinib PK parameters were found when given concomitantly with simvastatin. In conclusion, the coadministration of imatinib at steady state with 40 mg simvastatin increases the exposure (C(max) and AUCs) of simvastatin significantly (P<0.001) by two-three-fold. Caution is therefore required when administering imatinib with CYP3A4 substrates with a narrow therapeutic window. The coadministration of simvastatin with imatinib (400 mg) was well tolerated and no major safety findings were reported in this study.", 
    "86": "Inborn errors of cholesterol synthesis are associated with multiple systemic abnormalities, including skeletal malformations. The regulatory role of cholesterol during embryogenesis appears to be mediated by Shh, a signaling molecule in which activity depends on molecular events involving cholesterol. Based on this evidence, we hypothesized that cholesterol, by modifying the activity of Ihh (another of the Hedgehog family proteins) in the growth plate, regulates longitudinal bone growth. To test this hypothesis, we treated rats with AY 9944, an inhibitor of the final reaction of cholesterol synthesis. After 3 weeks, AY 9944 reduced the cumulative growth, tibial growth, and the tibial growth plate height of the rats. To determine whether cholesterol deficiency affects bone growth directly at the growth plate, we then cultured fetal rat metatarsal bones in the presence of AY 9944. After 4 days, AY 9944 suppressed metatarsal growth and growth plate chondrocyte proliferation and hypertrophy. The inhibitory effect on chondrocyte hypertrophy was confirmed by the AY 9944-mediated decreased expression of collagen X. Lastly, AY 9944 decreased the expression of Ihh in the metatarsal growth plate. We conclude that reduced cholesterol synthesis in the growth plate, possibly by altering the normal activity of Ihh, results in suppressed longitudinal bone growth and growth plate chondrogenesis.", 
    "87": "Given that combination therapy with statin plus fibrate confers a risk of myopathy, it is worthwhile to determine whether statin or fibrate monotherapy is associated with greater clinical benefit in individuals with combined hyperlipidemia. In this randomized double-blind study, we compared the efficacy of simvastatin and fenofibrate on indexes of endothelial function (flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery) and inflammatory markers (plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), soluble CD40, and soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L) levels), as surrogate indicators of future coronary heart disease (CHD), in patients with combined hyperlipidemia. A total of 70 patients with plasma triglyceride levels between 200 and 500 mg/dl and total cholesterol levels of >200 mg/dl were randomly assigned to receive either simvastatin (20 mg/day) (n=35) or micronized fenofibrate (200 mg/day) (n=35) for 8 weeks. Treatment with simvastatin was associated with significantly greater reduction of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), while the decrease in triglycerides was significantly greater in patients receiving fenofibrate. Both fenofibrate and simvastatin markedly reduced plasma levels of high-sensitivity CRP, IL-1 beta, and sCD40L, and improved endothelium-dependent FMD without mutual differences. The changes in plasma inflammatory markers did not correlate with baseline clinical characteristics in both groups. However, the improvement in FMD with fenofibrate treatment correlated inversely with baseline high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, whereas the improvement in FMD with simvastatin treatment was positively related to HDL-C levels. Accordingly, in the subgroup with a baseline HDL-C of < or =40 mg/dl, only fenofibrate significantly improved the endothelium-dependent FMD. On the other hand, in the subgroup with HDL-C >40 mg/dl, only treatment with simvastatin achieved significant improvement in FMD. The data here indicate that in patients with combined hyperlipidemia, both fenofibrate and simvastatin have comparative beneficial effects on various inflammatory markers and differential beneficial effects on endothelial function according to baseline HDL-C levels. These findings should be validated by additional prospective studies, in which patients are stratified by baseline HDL-C prior to randomization.", 
    "88": "3-Hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) are effective in patients with hypercholesterolemia to reduce risk of cardiovascular diseases, because of not only their lowering cholesterol effects but also their pleiotropic effects, such as improvement of endothelial cell dysfunction. On the other hand, statins prevent cell proliferation of various cells, including endothelial cells. We examined effects of all statins available at present on the viability of cultured rat pulmonary vein endothelial cells. Lovastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin, fluvastatin and cerivastatin, which are hydrophobic statins, markedly reduced cell viability associated with DNA fragmentation, DNA laddering and activation of caspase-3, suggesting apoptotic cell death. Pravastatin, which is a hydrophilic statin, however, did not induce cell apoptosis. Apoptosis induced by hydrophobic statins was associated with activation of apoptosis-related intracellular signal transduction systems; attenuation of localization of RhoA to the membrane, induction of Rac1, and increase in phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase and c-Jun. Endothelial cell apoptosis is underlying the improvement of the endothelial dysfunction with hydrophobic statins.", 
    "89": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) can modulate the formation of new blood vessels, but the reports on their contribution to angiogenesis are contradictory.

    "90": "Under basal conditions human vascular smooth muscle cells (HVSMC) and microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1) constitutively generate and release vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). In contrast, primary macrovascular endothelial cells (HUVEC) produce minute amounts of VEGF. Different statins (atorvastatin, simvastatin and lovastatin, 1-10 micromol/l) significantly reduced basal and cytokine-, nitric oxide- or lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC)-induced VEGF synthesis in HMEC-1 and HVSMC. Interestingly, at the same concentrations statins upregulated VEGF generation in HUVEC. Furthermore, statins exerted dual, concentration-dependent influence on angiogenic activities of HUVEC as determined by tube formation assay. At low concentrations (0.03-1 micromol/l) the pro-angiogenic activity of statins is prevalent, whereas at higher concentrations statins inhibit angiogenesis, despite increasing VEGF synthesis.",

    "92": "Statin therapy (3-hydroxy-3methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor) is beneficial for primary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients younger than age 65 years with hyperlipidemia, yet there is uncertainty about using these agents for primary prevention in octogenarians. We present the case that can be made for not treating octogenarians with statins for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. This case is built on three points: 1) cholesterol levels are not associated with cardiovascular disease events in octogenarians without overt coronary artery disease; 2) no randomized, controlled trials have assessed the role of statins in reducing events in octogenarians without coronary artery disease; and 3) statins may increase risks of myositis, rhabdomyolysis, and cancer in the elderly. In view of gaps in the current evidence and the resulting clinical uncertainty, it is unclear whether the balance of risk and benefit favors treatment for the primary prevention of coronary artery disease in octogenarians. The use of statins in this age group should be based on patient preference.", 
    "93": "Statins should be given to octogenarians for primary prevention of coronary heart disease. There is a substantial burden of disease and disability in this population that statin treatment can address in an effective manner. It has been shown that statin treatment is both effective and safe, and details of the Prospective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk (PROSPER) trial are reviewed. It may be useful to tease out those at particularly high risk who would benefit from statin treatment. In this regard, a low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein level, and subclinical measures of atherosclerosis may be particularly useful.", 
    "94": "TAK-475 is a squalene synthase inhibitor, rapidly metabolized to T-91485 in vivo. We investigated the myotoxicities of T-91485 and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors in a human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line, RD, and in human skeletal myocytes. In differentiated RD cells, T-91485, atorvastatin (ATV) and simvastatin acid (SIM) inhibited cholesterol biosynthesis, with IC(50) values of 36, 2.8 and 3.8 nM, respectively. ATV and SIM decreased the intracellular ATP content, with IC(25) values (concentrations giving a 25% decrease in intracellular ATP content) of 0.61 and 0.44 microM, respectively. Although T-91485 potently inhibited cholesterol synthesis in RD cells, the IC(25) value exceeded 100 microM. In human skeletal myocytes, T-91485, ATV and SIM concentration-dependently inhibited cholesterol biosynthesis, with IC(50) values of 45, 8.6 and 8.4 nM, respectively. ATV and SIM decreased intracellular ATP content, with IC(25) values of 2.1 and 0.72 microM, respectively. Although T-91485 potently inhibited cholesterol synthesis, the IC(25) value exceeded 100 microM. Myotoxicity induced by ATV was prevented by mevalonate or geranylgeranyl-PP, but not by squalene in skeletal cells. Furthermore, T-91485 attenuated the myotoxicity of ATV. These findings suggest that TAK-475 and T-91485 may not only be far from myotoxic, they may also decrease statin-induced myotoxicity in lipid-lowering therapy.",

    "96": "To investigate whether marked and sustained lipid-lowering in subjects with stable angina pectoris and dyslipidemia reduces exercise-induced myocardial ischemia, 17 subjects were treated with dose-adjusted atorvastatin over 1 year and underwent serial evaluation of exercise electrocardiographic ischemic parameters, serum biomarkers, and brachial artery endothelial function. Endothelial function improved progressively and C-reactive protein, P-selectin, and tissue plasminogen activator inhibitor levels decreased, but there was no decrease in exercise electrocardiographic ischemia.", 
    "97": "The effects of combined treatment with low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-apheresis, chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor were studied in 2 patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. Patient 1 was initially treated with LDL-apheresis alone: serum cholestanol levels decreased by 50% after each apheresis, but returned to their initial levels within 2 weeks. After an addition of CDCA administration, the serum cholestanol levels steadily decreased, resulting in slight improvement of neurological symptoms. Patient 2 received a combined treatment with LDL-apheresis, CDCA and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor. This combination showed less LDL-apheresis-dependent fluctuation and more rapid decrease of serum cholestanol levels than those in Patient 1, resulting in improvement and stabilization of the symptoms. Our results suggest that LDL-apheresis in combination with CDCA and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor may have beneficial effects and can be one of the treatment options.", 
    "98": "Lipids may adversely affect renal function. The recently published MRC/BHF Heart Protection Study (HPS) subgroup analysis showed that simvastatin significantly reduced the fall in glomerular filtration rate in high-risk patients with and without diabetes mellitus. These findings are in line with those of smaller earlier studies, including the GREek Atorvastatin and Coronary heart disease Evaluation (GREACE) Study. Lipid lowering trials need to consider that changes in renal function may occur. Renal and ischaemic heart disease may progress in parallel and statins may be beneficial to both organs.", 
    "99": "This retrospective study was carried out to assess the effectiveness of statin-gemfibrozil combination therapy in a community practice lipid clinic and to review safety data from published literature. Forty-six consecutive patients received a statin and gemfibrozil combination for resistant hyperlipidemia to either agent therapy. Fasting total cholesterol (mg/dL), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (mg/dL), and triglycerides (mg/dL) were measured. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (mg/dL) was calculated using the Friedewald formula if triglycerides were <400 mg/dL. Combination therapy reduced total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides by 11% (p=0.02), 22% (p=0.049), and 39% (p=0.0002), respectively, and raised high-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 5% (p=0.3). A pooled analysis of 838 patients from the literature on statin-gemfibrozil combination therapy revealed an incidence of myositis and severe myopathy of 0.7% and 0.6%, respectively (excluding cerivastatin). We conclude that statin-gemfibrozil combination therapy is effective in significantly reducing total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides with a trend toward raising high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in patients with hyperlipidemia resistant to either agent alone. Myositis and severe myopathy are infrequent, but not rare side effects which may be statin-specific regarding the incidence of occurrence.",

Measurement or anticipation of patients most susceptible to lipoprotein subfraction abnormalities may influence therapeutic choices for the optimal management of dyslipidemia. Previously, the ADvicor Vs. Other Cholesterol-modulating Agents Trial Evaluation demonstrated that niacin extended release/lovastatin provided greater global improvement in lipid parameters such as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, lipoprotein (a), apolipoprotein B, and apolipoprotein A-I blood levels compared with atorvastatin and simvastatin monotherapies. In this report, niacin extended release/lovastatin was also more effective than atorvastatin and simvastatin monotherapies in reducing small, dense low-density lipoprotein particles and improving low-density lipoprotein phenotype pattern at relative starting doses, and was more effective in increasing the proportion of high-density lipoprotein in the potentially cardioprotective 2b subclass at all doses.", 
    "101": "Vascular inflammation is central to the pathogenesis of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and the response to vascular injury after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). For both ACS and PCI, the magnitude of vascular inflammation is linked to adverse late clinical outcomes (e.g., death, recurrent myocardial infarction [MI] or ischemia, and restenosis). Many pharmacologic therapies with demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of ACS have anti-inflammatory properties, which are distinct from their perceived primary mechanism of action. The anti-inflammatory effects of aspirin, clopidogrel, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), platelet glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitors, statins, and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are reviewed, and the hypothesis is generated that modulation of vascular inflammation at least in part contributes a common basis for the long-term clinical benefit ascribed to these medications.

However, intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis of clinical studies generally provides an observed treatment effect that is likely to underestimate what the treatment effect would be if compliance were perfect, because compliance in a clinical trial is invariably <100% during long-term follow-up.", 
    "103": "The aim of this study was to analyze the relationship between compliance and treatment effect in LIPS.", 
    "104": "In LIPS, patients who had undergone a successful first PCI were randomized to receive fluvastatin 40 mg BID or placebo BID for 3 to 5 years. The primary end point was survival time free of MACE (ie, cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or reintervention procedure), and a Cox proportional hazards regression model with time-dependent covariates was used to predict the effect that fluvastatin would have had if trial medication had been continued. Logistic regression was used to determine factors influencing discontinuation of trial medication.", 
    "105": "A total of 1677 patients were enrolled in LIPS: 844 in the fluvastatin group and 833 in the placebo group. In the fluvastatin group, 294 patients (34.8%) discontinued taking trial medication and 73 (8.6%) switched to another lipid-lowering medication, compared with 353 (42.4%) and 187 (22.4%) patients in the placebo group, respectively. The risk factor-adjusted RR of MACE with fluvastatin treatment was 0.74 (P = 0.004; 95% CI, 0.61-0.91). When also adjusted for noncompliance, the RR for fluvastatin versus placebo was 0.68 (P = 0.002; 95% CI, 0.53-0.86). Discontinuing fluvastatin without switching to another lipid-lowering medication increased the risk of MACE compared with that of patients who stayed on fluvastatin (RR = 2.27; P < 0.001; 95% CI, 1.60-3.23) and the increase in the risk of MACE was greater than that associated with discontinuing placebo (P = 0.032).", 
    "106": "The present study found a 32% RR reduction for experiencing MACE during fluvastatin treatment after a successful PCI in LIPS, when analysis allowed for noncompliance. This suggests that the ITT analysis discussed in the main LIPS publication underestimated the benefit of fluvastatin treatment.

There was a linear effect with increased levels of LDL cholesterol increasing the risk of having a small aneurysm (test for trend p=0.03).",

Statins may protect vascular endothelium in hypercholesterolemia by reducing enhanced plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein and decreasing oxidative stress. Herein, we describe increased circulating levels of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and E-selectin and total 8-iso-prostaglandin F(2 alpha) (8-iso-PGF(2 alpha)) concentrations, as indexes of endothelial activation and lipid peroxidation, respectively, in 67 hypercholesterolemic patients compared with 32 normocholesterolemic subjects. Significant cholesterol reductions were achieved in hypercholesterolemic patients after 6 months under either simvastatin (40 mg/d) or bezafibrate (800 mg/d) treatment, given according to a randomized double-blind trial. Simvastatin but not bezafibrate simultaneously reduced soluble adhesin and total 8-iso-PGF(2 alpha) concentrations also. Vitamin E supplementation (400 IU/d) further reduced indexes of endothelial activation and lipid peroxidation in simvastatin-treated patients and significantly reduced the above indexes in bezafibrate-treated patients. Changes in circulating soluble adhesion molecule levels were directly correlated with changes in total 8-iso-PGF(2 alpha) concentrations in simvastatin-treated patients also receiving vitamin E supplementation. All together, our data demonstrated that hypercholesterolemia was combined with endothelial activation and lipid peroxidation, which were efficaciously counteracted by simvastatin but not bezafibrate treatment. Thus, a different vascular protection can be achieved by different lipid-lowering treatments.", 
    "112": "Psychiatric abnormalities have been described in primary neurological disorders like multiple sclerosis, primary generalized epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), central nervous system glioma, and syndrome X with vascular dementia. It was therefore considered pertinent to compare monoamine neurotransmitter pattern in schizophrenia with those in the disorders described above. The end result of neurotransmission is changes in membrane Na(+)-K+ ATPase activity. Membrane Na(+)-K+ ATPase inhibition can lead to magnesium depletion, which can lead to an upregulated isoprenoid pathway. The isoprenoid pathway produces three important metabolites--digoxin, an endogenous membrane Na(+) -K+ ATPase inhibitor; ubiquinone, a membrane antioxidant and component of mitochondrial electron transport chain; and dolichol, important in N-glycosylation of protein. The serum/plasma levels of digoxin, dolichol, ubiquinone, magnesium, HMG CoA reductase activity, and RBC Na(+)-K+ ATPase activity were estimated in all these disorders. The result showed that the concentration of serum tryptophan and serotonin was high and serum tyrosine, dopamine, adrenaline, and noradrenaline low in all the disorders studied. The plasma HMG CoA reductase activity, serum digoxin, and serum dolichol levels were high and serum ubiquinone levels, serum magnesium, and RBC Na(+)-K+ ATPase activity were low in all the disorders studied. The significance of these changes in the pathogenesis of syndrome X, multiple sclerosis, primary generalized epilepsy, schizophrenia, SSPE, and Parkinson's disease is discussed in the setting of the interrelationship between these disorders documented in literature.",

    "117": "Farnesyl transferase inhibitors have emerged as bona fide anticancer agents whereas the development of geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitors has been mitigated by overt systemic toxicities. Evidence suggests that the therapeutic value of farnesyl transferase inhibitors is an indirect result of perturbations in the function of geranylgeranylated Rho proteins. To address this question, we used inhibitors of the mevalonate synthesis pathway to decrease cellular levels of farnesly and geranylgeranly isoprenoids and supplemented our culture systems with exogenous isoprenoids accordingly. Using a murine lung alveolar carcinoma cell line (Line 1), we report a dose-dependent inhibition of tumor cell proliferation, adhesion and invasiveness, in response to alendronate (3-30 micromol/L) and mevastatin (1-10 micromol/L). Supplementation of cultures with geranylgeranyl pyrophosphates (100 micromol/L) was observed to rescue drug-induced phenotypic changes whereas farnesyl pyrophosphate (100 micromol/L) had a minimal effect. Our observations highlight the mevalonate synthesis pathway as a target for anticancer therapies and suggest a greater role for geranylgeranylated proteins in cellular processes germane to cancer.", 
    "118": "The corpus allatum (CA) of adult female Ceratitis capitata produces methyl palmitate (MP) in vitro, in addition to JHB(3) and JH III. Biosynthesized MP migrates on TLC and co-elutes from RP-18 HPLC with synthetic MP. Its identity is verified herein by GCMS. MP production is up-regulated twofold by mevastatin, an inhibitor of mevalonic acid-dependent isoprene biosynthesis. Fosmidomycin, an inhibitor of mevalonic acid-independent isoprene synthesis in graminaceous plants, up-regulates MP synthesis by about fourfold. However, it does not depress JHB(3) biosynthesis concurrently. This suggests that the initial enzyme(s) in the conversion of 1-deoxy-xylulose 5-phosphate to isoprene is presumably present in C. capitata, but is inhibited by fosmidomycin, and this inhibition diverts precursors to MP synthesis. Phytol, an acyclic diterpene, might be suppressing isoprene biosynthesis by CA, thereby resulting in a fourfold increase in the MP biosynthesis. Linolenic acid is an end-product and its presence in incubation media up-regulates MP biosynthesis by twofold, presumably due to the feedback diversion to biosynthesis of C(16:0) and its methyl ester. Biosynthesis of MP is markedly depressed after mating, while otherwise maintained at significantly higher levels in virgin females. MP biosynthesis is significantly reduced in virgin females by direct axonal control but is less consistent after mating.",

    "145": "Large-scale trials established that statin administration in hypercholesterolaemic individuals and patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) significantly reduces the risk of vascular events and death. This benefit was primarily attributed to their actions on lipids. This review focuses on the benefits (clinical and experimental) of statins observed soon (approximately 12 weeks) after their administration. Statins rapidly increase nitric oxide production and improve endothelial function (e.g. increased flow-mediated dilatation). Similarly, antioxidant properties decrease the susceptibility of low density lipoprotein cholesterol to oxidation. Statins inhibit the migration of macrophages and smooth muscle cell proliferation leading to an antiproliferative effect and the stabilisation of atherosclerotic plaques. Anti-inflammatory effects include a reduction in serum C-reactive protein levels, inflammatory and proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. IL-6, IL-8), adhesion molecules (e.g. ICAM-1, VCAM-1) and other acute phase proteins. Statins influence the haemostatic system. They reduce tissue factor expression and platelet activity, whereas fibrinolysis can be enhanced. Statins improve microalbuminuria, renal function, hypertension and arterial wall stiffness. A significant reduction of the carotid intima media thickness (IMT) was also reported early after statin treatment. These early effects of statins probably contribute to the significant reduction in vascular events seen in some 'short-term' studies. There is a need to further elucidate the rapid and non-lipid lowering properties of statins.",

Accumulation of hepatic lipid droplets was higher in the control group than in the rats supplemented with either cinnamate or lovastatin. Hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase activity was significantly lower in the cinnamate group compared with the other groups, whereas only acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase activity was significantly lower in the lovastatin group compared with the control group. Cinnamate supplementation resulted in higher catalase and glutathione peroxidase activities, while hepatic thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances were significantly lower in both the cinnamate and lovastatin groups. The fecal acidic sterol was higher in the lovastatin group than in the control or cinnamate groups. These results suggest that dietary cinnamate inhibits hepatic HMG-CoA reductase activity, resulting in lower hepatic cholesterol content, and suppresses lipid peroxidation via enhancement of hepatic antioxidant enzyme activities.", 
    "158": "BACKGROUND: Macrophages can produce vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in response to hypoxia, transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1), angiotensin II, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and interleukin-1. These factors have been found in the serum of coronary artery disease (CAD) patients as well as in atherosclerotic lesions. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that the expression of VEGF, TGF-beta1 and bFGF in peripheral monocytes and lymphocytes is related to CAD. METHODS: Human Mononuclear cells and lymphocytes from peripheral blood were isolated from 53 donors undergoing angiography. Seventeen were found to be healthy and 36 were diagnosed with CAD. The respective mRNAs were extracted and quantified. RESULTS: The statistical analysis revealed a significant increase of the basal level expression for macrophage VEGF and bFGF in the CAD SA (stable angina) patient group compared to the noCAD (control) (p = 0.041 and p = 0.022 respectively) and CAD UA (unstable angina) (p = 0.024 and p = 0.005 respectively) groups, which was highly dependent on the diabetic status of the population. Furthermore, we demonstrated with an in vitro cell culture model that the levels of VEGF and bFGF in monocytes of healthy donors are not affected by short term exposure to increased glucose levels (usually observed in the diabetic patients) and/or statin. CONCLUSION: Our findings display a statistically significant association of the increased VEGF and bFGF levels in peripheral monocytes, with stable angina and diabetes in coronary artery disease. The results give new insight to CAD and the impaired collateral vessel formation in diabetics.",

Plasma cholesterol levels and coronary heart disease risk can be reduced pharmacologically by decreasing cholesterol synthesis, increasing its elimination and/or reducing its absorption from the intestine. The more profound knowledge about cholesterol homeostasis has allowed the development of several lipid-lowering drugs with different mechanisms of action, with the purpose of reducing both morbidity and mortality associated with coronary heart disease. Two new and more potent 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins), also called superstatins (rosuvastatin and pitavastatin), are being studied for their ability to improve lipid profiles. Rosuvastatin is a potent, hepato-selective and relatively hydrophilic statin with a low propensity for muscle toxicity and drug interactions. Pitavastatin is another statin with a high oral bioavailability and minimal propensity for cytochrome p450-mediated drug interactions. Rosuvastatin seems to be more potent than other available statins while pitavastatin presents with a similar potency to that of atorvastatin. Another promising approach for lowering total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels is inhibition of cholesterol absorption. A wide variety of new agents with the capacity for inhibiting the intestinal cholesterol absorption is currently being investigated. Ezetimibe is a selective cholesterol absorption inhibitor whose clinical efficacy has been recently demonstrated both in monotherapy and in combination with other lipid-lowering drugs. Colesevelam, a new bile acid sequestrant, has shown a clinical efficacy similar to that of other resins, with minimal gastrointestinal side effects, improving tolerability and patient compliance. Other lipid-lowering drugs with the ability to act at the enterocyte level, such as avasimibe and implitapide, are currently being investigated in humans.", 
    "160": "Tangles are a major histopathological feature of Alzheimer's disease and their regional location and number correlate significantly with the individual's cognitive decline. Intriguingly, these tangles are formed only in a small subset of nerve cell types and are practically absent in most animal species examined so far. In humans, tangle formation seemingly starts decades before clinical signs of dementia are seen and spread over cortical areas in a regular manner described by the Braak classification. In the present article the role of plasticity-related molecules and mechanisms are discussed considering their putative role in neuronal vulnerability and spread of tangles. Special emphasis is given to some aspects of lipid metabolism, that is, apolipoprotein E polymorphism, statin effects, and lysosomal dysfunction in Alzheimer's and Niemann-Pick C's diseases.", 
    "161": "Evidence suggests that statin therapy reduces the risk of stroke in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), but its benefit for patients with cerebrovascular disease and no history of CHD remains uncertain. The Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels (SPARCL) Study is a prospective, multi-centre, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate the effects of atorvastatin 80 mg/day in patients who previously experienced a stroke or transient ischaemic attack, but who have no known CHD. A total of 4732 patients have been enrolled, and the data collection phase of the study is expected to be completed by October 2004. SPARCL is the first study primarily designed to prospectively evaluate the effect of statin treatment in secondary stroke prevention.", 
    "162": "Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) plays a central role in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) metabolism. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and haplotypes in the CETP gene were determined in 98 patients with untreated dyslipidemias and analyzed for associations with plasma CETP and plasma lipids before and during statin treatment. Individual CETP SNPs and haplotypes were both significantly associated with CETP enzyme mass and activity. However, only certain CETP haplotypes, but not individual SNPs, significantly predicted the magnitude of change in HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides. After adjusting for covariates and multiple testing, the TTCAAA haplotype showed a gene-dose effect in predicting the HDL-C increase (P=0.03), while the TTCAAAGGG and AAAGGG haplotypes predicted a decrease in triglycerides (P=0.04 both). This is the first study to demonstrate that SNP haplotypes derived from allelic SNP combinations in the CETP gene were more informative than single SNPs in predicting the response to lipid-modifying therapy with statins."
