The study is planned to include 200 patients with hypercholesterolemia ineffectively treated with statins for at least 6\u00a0weeks. After enrollment participants are randomized into one of two arms receiving rosuvastatin and ezetimibe. In the first arm the study drug is administered in the morning (8:00\u00a0am) for 6\u00a0weeks and then in the evening for the next 6\u00a0weeks; in the second arm the study drug is administered at first in the evening (8:00\u00a0pm) for the first 6\u00a0weeks and then in the morning for the following 6\u00a0weeks. In order to minimize non-adherence to the treatment, all patients will receive the study drug free of charge. The primary outcome of the study is change in LDL-C at 6 and 12\u00a0weeks of the treatment, depending on the time of day of study drug administration.

Authors have evaluated erectile function in men with coronary artery disease (CAD) and the relationship between the degree of erectile dysfunction (ED) and the age of their first acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The incidence of erectile dysfunction in three groups of patients of AMI survivors was investigated: AMI survivors younger than 45 years, AMI survivors older than 65 years, and normal male population aged between 30 and 60 years. Erectile function was assessed by the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5) questionnaire. In post-AMI male patients younger than 45 years ( n = 76), mild ED occurred in 26% and severe in 7%. In the older AMI group, mild ED occurred in 52% and severe in 38%. In the control group age matched to younger survivors, 96% denied ED and only one control patient had a score of 20 on the IIEF-5. A paradoxical result was observed in patients using beta blockers (BB), who had better scores than the group without BB. Statin treatment had a positive influence on the score in questionnaires. Those on statins had an average score of 21.0 \u00b1 4.9 vs. without statin 17.7 \u00b1 5.7, p = .03. The current findings identified that the prevalence of ED is relatively high in young patients with CAD and is related to treatment of the CAD. The overall increase in ED presence suggests that the background of their coronary event is not due to destabilization of single focused atheroma but may reflect a generalized atherosclerotic process.",

We estimated the impact of publications on pharmaceutical sales in 3 markets (statins, rheumatoid arthritis, and asthma drugs) with varying generic competition. An event-study approach with fixed effects and difference-in-fixed-effects modeling was used to estimate the causal effects of drug-specific publications on subsequent quarter's drug-specific sales and volume. High-impact clinical and HEOR publications have significant positive effects on sales (mediated through price) and volume in the statin market (high generic competition). High-impact clinical publications have a significant positive effect on sales (mediated through volume) in low-generic competition market (asthma). The effects of publications in the rheumatoid arthritis market (no generic competition) on sales were null. Manufacturers' investment in clinical and HEOR publications needs to be strategic and should be anticipated and complemented by public investments in such studies.",

Monoclonal antibodies targeting PCKS9 are currently in the advanced phase of development. We aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of PCSK9 inhibitors in patients at different cardiovascular risk in a systematic review. Studies were searched on MEDLINE and EMBASE until January 2016. Differences in the outcomes among groups were expressed as mean differences, or pooled odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI), which were calculated using a fixed-effects and a random-effects model. Statistical heterogeneity was evaluated using the I (2) statistic. 22 RCTs and 8833 patients were included. Six studies were performed in patients affected by homozygous or heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, or with increased cardiovascular risk, two in patients with statin intolerance, three in statin-na\u00efve patients, and 10 in patients unable to achieve LDL-C target with statin therapy. PCSK9 inhibitors were associated with a statistically significant reduction of LDL-C (mean\u00a0=\u00a0-48.8%; 95% CI -54.1, -43.4; I (2)\u00a0=\u00a094%) compared to control groups, and with a statistically significant reduction in death for any cause (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.34; 95% CI 0.17, 0.69; I (2)\u00a0=\u00a00) and a favorable trend for cardiovascular events (OR\u00a0=\u00a00.79; 95% CI 0.61, 1.02; I (2)\u00a0=\u00a00%).

All were diagnosed with childhood-onset (i.e., prior to age 18) T1D between 1950 and 1980 and were seen within one year of diagnosis at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. Self-reported statin use (yes/no and if yes, name of statin) was collected biennially from parent study baseline (1986-1988) to time of neurocognitive testing. Logistic regression models tested associations between statin use groups and cognitive impairment (defined as having two or more cognitive test scores 1.5SD or worse than published norms) while linear regression models tested associations between statin use groups and cognitive domain z-scores (domains: Verbal IQ, memory, executive function, psychomotor speed, and visuo-construction).

Compared with never users, using statins 1-6 years tripled the odds of cognitive impairment (OR = 3.16; 95%CI: 0.93-10.72; P = 0.06) and using statins 7-12 years almost quintupled the odds of cognitive impairment (OR = 4.84; 95%CI: 1.63-14.44; P = 0.005). Compared with never users, using statins 1-6 or 7-12 years was related to worse performance in the memory domain (\u03b2 = -0.52; P = 0.003, and -0.39; P = 0.014, respectively). Adjusting for coronary artery disease, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and Apo E4 status did not substantially alter results, and none of these covariates were significantly related to cognitive outcomes (all P > 0.05).

The use of statins, potent inhibitors of hydroxyl-methyl glutaryl (HMG) Co-A reductase, a rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, has significantly reduced the rates of cardiovascular and general mortality in patients with coronary artery disease. How statins lower plasma cholesterol levels presents a mechanistic conundrum since persistent exposure to these drugs in vitro or in vivo is known to induce overexpression of the HMG Co-A reductase gene and protein. In an attempt to solve this mechanistic puzzle, Schonewille et al, studied detailed metabolic parameters of cholesterol synthesis, inter-organ flux and excretion in mice treated with 3 common statins, rosuvastatin, atorvastatin or lovastatin, each with its unique pharmacokinetics. From the measurements of the rates of heavy water (D2O) and [(13)C]-acetate incorporation into lipids, the authors calculated the rates of whole body and organ-specific cholesterol synthesis in control and statin-treated mice. These analyses revealed dramatic enhancement in the rates of hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis in statin-treated mice that concomitantly elicited lower levels of cholesterol in their plasma. The authors have provided strong evidence to indicate that statin treatment in mice led to induction of compensatory metabolic pathways that apparently mitigated an excessive accumulation of cholesterol in the body. It was noted however that changes in cholesterol metabolism induced by 3 statins were not identical. While sustained delivery of all 3 statins led to enhanced rates of biliary excretion of cholesterol and its fecal elimination, only atorvastatin treated mice elicited enhanced trans-intestinal cholesterol excretion. Thus, blockade of HMGCR by statins in mice was associated with profound metabolic adaptations that reset their cholesterol homeostasis. The findings of Schonewille et al, deserve to be corroborated and extended in patients in order to more effectively utilize these important cholesterol-lowering drugs in the clinic.",

P2X7-related machinery was characterized and the effects of P2X7 antagonists (A740003, KN62) and MMPs inhibitors (Batimastat, Ro28-2653) were studied in ex-vivo tissue cultures of human PL's vs. non-atherosclerotic internal mammary artery (IMA) by using molecular biology, immune-biochemical and microscopy methodologies. We highlighted atherosclerosis-related differences between PLs and IMAs molecular patterns, and their responsivity to P2X7 antagonism. High IL-1\u03b2 tissue content was associated with PLs morphology and instability/vulnerability. We demonstrated that A740003, but not KN62, decreased IL-1\u03b2 and MMP9 independently from NLR family pyrin domain containing 3, but in relationship with patient's smoking status. Acting downstream P2X7 by MMPs inhibitors, diminished IL-1\u03b2 mRNA without transcriptional effect at MMP9, possibly because the assumption of statin by patients.

The 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC-AHA) guideline expands recommended statin use, but its cost-effectiveness has not been compared with other guidelines. Methods -We used the Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Policy Model to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the ACC-AHA, relative to current use, Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) guidelines, and universal statin use in all men age 45-74 years and women age 55-74 years over a 10-year horizon from 2016 to 2025. Sensitivity analyses varied costs, risks, and benefits. Main outcomes were incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) and numbers needed to treat for ten years per quality-adjusted life-year gained (NNT/QALY). Results -Each approach produces substantial benefits and net cost savings relative to the status quo. Full adherence to the ATP III guideline would result in 8.8 million more statin users than the status quo, at an NNT/QALY of 35. The ACC-AHA guideline would potentially result in up to 12.3 million more statin users than the ATP III guideline, with a marginal NNT/QALY of 68. Moderate-intensity statin use in all men 45-74 and women 55-74 would result in 28.9 million more statin users than the ACC-AHA guideline, with a marginal NNT/QALY of 108. In all cases, benefits would be greater in men than women. Results vary moderately with different risk thresholds for instituting statins and statin toxicity estimates, but greatly depend on the disutility caused by daily medication use (pill burden). Conclusions -At a population level, the ACC-AHA guideline for expanded statin use for primary prevention is projected to treat more people, save more lives, and cost less compared with ATP III, in both men and women. Whether individuals benefit from long-term statin use for primary prevention depends more on the disutility associated with pill burden than their degree of cardiovascular risk.",

Those who are homozygous have severe disease. The average worldwide prevalence of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is at least 1 in 500, although recent genetic epidemiological data from Denmark and next generation sequencing data suggest the frequency may be closer to 1 in 250. Diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia in children is based on elevated total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels or DNA-based analysis, or both. Coronary atherosclerosis has been detected in men with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia as young as 17 years old and in women with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia at 25 years old. Since the clinical complications of atherosclerosis occur prematurely, especially in men, lifelong treatment, started in childhood, is needed to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. In children with the disease, diet was the cornerstone of treatment but the addition of lipid-lowering medications has resulted in a significant improvement in treatment. Anion exchange resins, such as cholestyramine and colestipol, were found to be effective, but they are poorly tolerated. Since the 1990s studies carried out on children aged 6 to 17 years with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia have demonstrated significant reductions in their serum total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. While statins seem to be safe and well-tolerated in children, their long-term safety in this age group is not firmly established.

    "81": "There are more and more data concerning the role of cellular metabolism in innate immune cells, such as macrophages or conventional dendritic cells. However, few data are available currently concerning plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDC), another type of innate immune cells. These cells are the main type I interferon (IFN) producing cells, but they also secrete other pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor or interleukin [IL]-6) or immunomodulatory factors (e.g., IL-10 or transforming growth factor-\u03b2). Through these functions, PDC participate in antimicrobial responses or maintenance of immune tolerance, and have been implicated in the pathophysiology of several autoimmune diseases, as well as in tumor immune escape mechanisms. Recent data support the idea that the glycolytic pathway (or glycolysis), as well as lipid metabolism (including both cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism) may impact some innate immune functions of PDC or may be involved in these functions after Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7/9 triggering. The kinetics of glycolysis after TLR7/9 triggering may differ between human and murine PDC. In mouse PDC, metabolism changes promoted by TLR7/9 activation may depend on an autocrine/paracrine loop, implicating type I IFN and its receptor IFNAR. This could explain a delayed glycolysis in mouse PDC. Moreover, PDC functions can be modulated by the metabolism of cholesterol and fatty acids. This may occur via the production of lipid ligands that activate nuclear receptors (e.g., liver X receptor [LXR]) in PDC or through limiting intracellular cholesterol pool size (by statin or LXR agonist treatment) in these cells. Finally, lipid-activated nuclear receptors (i.e., LXR or peroxisome proliferator activated receptor) may also directly interact with pro-inflammatory transcription factors, such as NF-\u03baB. Here, we discuss how glycolysis and lipid metabolism may modulate PDC functions and how this may be harnessed in pathological situations where PDC play a detrimental role.",

Hyaluronan fragments may serve as endogenous TLR2 ligands.

There is no generally accepted effective treatment for NAFLD/NASH. The joint guidelines of the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL), the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) and the European Association for the Study of Obesity (EASO) suggest the \"off label\" use of pioglitazone in patients without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and pioglitazone in subjects with T2DM or vitamin E or their combination for the treatment of NASH; however pioglitazone has considerable limitations: weight gain, bone fractures in women, and heart failure. The aim of this narrative review is to assess the existing evidence supporting statin use for the treatment of NASH and the reduction of the high CVD risk of these patients. Animal data suggest that there is some benefit from statin use in liver histology in models of NASH. In humans, 3 post hoc analyses of randomised controlled trials (n=1,600, n=1,123, n=8,864) suggest that the use of atorvastatin (even in 80 mg/day) has a beneficial effect on NAFLD/NASH, in terms of liver enzyme reduction and ultrasonographic amelioration. Moreover, and most importantly, statin treatment halved CVD morbidity and mortality in statin-treated NAFLD/NASH patients compared with statin-treated participants with normal liver structure and function and reduced by 2/3rds CVD events in comparison with NAFLD/NASH patients that were not on a statin (90% of this population is not on statins because of the unjustified fear for liver damage). Three biopsy studies (n=20, n=107 and n=356) showed that statin treatment had a protective effect on steatosis, steatohepatitis and fibrosis. Data suggest that statin treatment in humans substantially improve or cure NAFLD/NASH, but above all substantially reduce CVD morbidity and mortality.

Methods A retrospective study, where all hospital records of all diabetes patients who had undergone minimum one amputation below the ankle at the CWHC Bispebjerg Hospital, Denmark, in the period 1996-2013, were examined. The amputations were mainly trans-metatarsal amputations and partial amputations of toes. The participants were found via ICD10-codes. The included patients were followed from their first contact to the last registered contact. The statistical analysis in this article is performed on patients with a of minimum 5-year follow-up. Results The 5 year mortality was 42% for patients with type 2 diabetes, and 29% for patients with type 1 diabetes. For patients with type 2 diabetes, multivariable analysis showed that high age, peripheral arterial insufficiency and short time from first admission to amputation were independently statistically significantly associated with increased 5-years mortality. Use of statins was associated with decreased mortality. 35% died as a result of their diabetes, mostly due to cardiovascular causes. Conclusion Short time from first admission to amputation is a risk factor for early death. Arterial insufficiency and high age is also associated with increased mortality, whereas use of statin is associated with decreased mortality, in patients with type 2 diabetes.", 
    "125": "Aortic stenosis is common and an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Prevalence will increase significantly in forthcoming decades as a function of the ageing population; treatment by means of surgery or percutaneous intervention is expensive. Epidemiological, mechanistic and interventional studies are therefore vital to determine optimal and innovative treatments and their funding. Recent studies suggest that aortic stenosis is not a passive degenerative disease, but an active process involving several pathways, including lipid infiltration, chronic inflammation, fibrosis formation, osteoblast activation, and active valve mineralisation. Despite similarities with atherosclerosis, randomised statin trials proved negative in aortic stenosis, underlining the need to explore alternative pathophysiological pathways. Left ventricular hypertrophy in response to pressure overload in aortic stenosis is initially adaptive but ultimately decompensates, leading to progressive left ventricular impairment, symptoms and adverse cardiovascular events. This transition is driven primarily by myocyte death and myocardial fibrosis. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging can visualise and quantify myocardial fibrosis and may provide additional and independent prognostic information in aortic stenosis. Moreover, new markers of fibrosis utilising novel imaging techniques are rapidly emerging. Transcatheter aortic valve implantation is a disruptive technology that has transformed the management of aortic stenosis, and encouraged a wider multidisciplinary approach to the management of valvular heart disease. While originally applied in older, high-risk patients, recent trends for its use in intermediate risk patients have been supported by the findings of key clinical trials in 2016.",

Predictions of drug-drug interactions (DDI) are important for the safety of combination therapies with statins, in particular drugs that are metabolized by CYP3A4. Little information is available regarding drug interactions with fluvastatin. Since CYP2C9 is a polymorphic enzyme, we investigated the effect of DDI via CYP2C9, CYP3A4, and CYP2C8 on fluvastatin pharmacokinetics by using a validated prediction method in relation to CYP2C9 variants. The predicted increases in the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) ratios of fluvastatin in carriers with CYP2C9*1/*2, CYP2C9*1/*3, CYP2C9*2/*2, CYP2C9*2/*3, and CYP2C9*3/*3 versus that found in carriers with CYP2C9*1/*1 were 1.16, 1.35, 1.37, 1.65, and 2.06, respectively. Our in silico model predicted that administration of fluvastatin in conjunction with the potent inhibitors that completely inhibited CYP3A4 and CYP2C8 in carriers with the CYP2C9*3/*3 variant would cause a 3.23- and 2.60-fold increase in the AUC ratios, respectively, when compared to that for the carriers with the CYP2C9*1/*1 taking fluvastatin alone.

Many genes have been identified as possible contributors to variability in statin response and safety. Genetic polymorphisms may alter the structure or expression of coded proteins, with potential impacts on lipid and statin absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination as well as response pathways related to the pharmacologic effect. Many studies have explored the variation in statins' pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters; however, to our knowledge, few have established definitive relationships between the genetic polymorphisms and patient outcomes, such as cardiovascular events. In this review article, we provide a statin-based summary of available evidence describing pharmacogenetic associations that may be of clinical relevance in the future. Although currently available studies are often small or retrospective, and may have conflicting results, they may be useful in providing direction for future confirmatory studies and may point to associations that could be confirmed in the future when more patient outcomes-based studies are available.

Antiplatelet therapy for primary prevention of cardiovascular events should generally be discontinued seven to 10 days before surgery to avoid increasing the risk of bleeding, unless the risk of a major adverse cardiac event exceeds the risk of bleeding. Antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention should be continued perioperatively, except before procedures with very high bleeding risk, such as intracranial procedures. Antiplatelet drugs should be continued and surgery delayed, if possible, for at least 14 days after percutaneous coronary intervention without stent placement, 30 days after percutaneous coronary intervention with bare-metal stent placement, and six to 12 months after percutaneous coronary intervention with drug-eluting stent placement. Perioperative beta blockers are recommended for patients already receiving these agents, and it is reasonable to consider starting therapy in patients with known or strongly suspected coronary artery disease or who are at high risk of perioperative cardiac events and are undergoing procedures with a high risk of cardiovascular complications. Long-term statin therapy should be continued perioperatively or started in patients with clinical indications who are not already receiving statins. Clonidine should not be started perioperatively, but long-term clonidine regimens may be continued. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers generally can be continued perioperatively if patients are hemodynamically stable and have good renal function and normal electrolyte levels.",

We previously found that promoting transcriptional activity of the Class I bHLH factor E47 in highly aggressive PDA cells induced stable growth arrest in vitro and in vivo. To translate these findings for clinical utility, we developed a high throughput screening platform to identify small molecule inducers of Class I/II bHLH activity. A screen of 4,375 known drugs identified 70 bHLH activators. Prominent among the hits were members of the statin class of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, cholesterol lowering drugs that are also being evaluated in cancer. Studies with pitavastatin in primary patient derived tumor cells and established PDA lines, revealed dose dependent growth inhibition. At the molecular level, pitavastatin induced expression of the cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21 in a cholesterol independent manner, blocked repressive phosphorylation of the Retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein at CDK targeted sites, and reduced expression of E2F target genes required for progression through the G1/S boundary. Together, the data provide new insight into mechanisms by which statins constrain proliferation in cancer and establish the effectiveness of a novel screening platform to identify small molecules of clinical relevance in pancreatic cancer.",

Interestingly, familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) patients with mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene are protected against diabetes mellitus (DM), despite these patients being subjected to long-term statin therapy. Since the common pathway between FH and statin therapy is LDLR-mediated cellular cholesterol uptake, the arising question is whether the LDLR plays an important role in the diabetogenic effect of statins. Indeed, given that statins can regulate the LDLR expression in liver and peripheral tissue, there is a possible mechanism that the increased LDLR causes cellular cholesterol accumulation and dysfunction in pancreatic islets, explaining why statins fail to increase the risk of DM in FH patients. In this paper, with regarded to recent literatures, we highlight the role of LDLR in the pathophysiology of cholesterol-induced pancreatic islets dysfunction, which may provide the key link between statins treatment and the increased risk of new-onset diabetes mellitus.",

Recently, there are emerging interests in the perspectives of statin drugs as anticancer agents based on preclinical evidence of their antiproliferative, proapoptotic, and anti-invasive properties. Functional impact of statin application on transformed cells still remains obscure that requires systematic study on adequate cellular models to provide correct comparison with their non-transformed counterparts. Cholesterol is the major lipid component of mammalian cells and it plays a crucial role in organization, lateral heterogeneity, and dynamics of plasma membrane as well as in membrane-cytoskeleton interrelations. To date, it is uncertain whether cellular effects of statins involve lipid-dependent alteration of plasma membrane. Here, the effects of simvastatin on lipid rafts, F-actin network and cellular viability were determined in comparative experiments on transformed fibroblasts and their non-transformed counterpart. GM1 lipid raft marker staining indicated no change of lipid raft integrity after short- or long-term simvastatin treatments. In the same time, simvastatin induced cytoskeleton rearrangement including partial F-actin disruption in cholesterol- and lipid raft-independent manner. Simvastatin dose-dependently affected viability of BALB/3T3 and 3T3B-SV40 cell lines: transformed fibroblasts were noticeably more sensitive to simvastatin comparing to non-transformed cells.",

Familial hypercholesterolaemia is relatively common, but is often underdiagnosed and undertreated. Cardiologists are likely to encounter many individuals with familial hypercholesterolaemia; however, patients presenting with premature ASCVD are rarely screened for familial hypercholesterolaemia and fasting lipid levels are infrequently documented. Given that individuals with familial hypercholesterolaemia and ASCVD are at a particularly high risk of subsequent cardiac events, this is a missed opportunity for preventive therapy. Furthermore, because there is a 50% chance that first-degree relatives of individuals with familial hypercholesterolaemia will also be affected by the disorder, the underdiagnosis of familial hypercholesterolaemia among patients with ASCVD is a barrier to cascade screening and the prevention of ASCVD in affected relatives. Targeted screening of patients with ASCVD is an effective strategy to identify new familial hypercholesterolaemia index cases. Statins are the standard treatment for individuals with familial hypercholesterolaemia; however, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol targets are not achieved in a large proportion of patients despite treatment.

We examined whether FDA's manufacturing standards led to standard concentrations of the statin monacolin K in red yeast rice supplements. We analyzed 28 brands of red yeast rice supplements by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry for monacolin K content. Monacolin K was not detected in two brands. In the 26 brands that contained monacolin K, the quantity ranged more than 60-fold from 0.09 to 5.48\u2009mg per 1200\u2009mg of red yeast rice. Following the manufacturers' recommendations for daily servings, the quantity of monacolin K consumed per day would range more than 120-fold from 0.09 to 10.94\u2009mg. Despite FDA manufacturing standards, strength and composition of red yeast rice supplements sold at mainstream retail stores in the United States remains unpredictable.", 
    "268": "Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is a low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-like particle that associates with major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). We examined relationships between Lp(a) measurements and changes in coronary atheroma volume following long-term maximally-intensive statin therapy in coronary artery disease patients.", 
    "269": "Study of coronary atheroma by intravascular ultrasound: Effect of Rosuvastatin Versus Atorvastatin (SATURN) used serial intravascular ultrasound measures of coronary atheroma volume in patients treated with rosuvastatin 40\u00a0mg or atorvastatin 80\u00a0mg for 24 months. Baseline and follow-up Lp(a) levels were measured in 915 of the 1039 SATURN participants, and were correlated with changes in percent atheroma volume (\u0394PAV).", 
    "270": "Mean age was 57.7\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08.6 years, 74% were men, 96% were Caucasian, with statin use prior to study enrolment occurring in 59.3% of participants. Baseline [median (IQR)] LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) and measured Lp(a) levels (mg/dL) were 114 (99, 137) and 17.4 (7.6, 52.9) respectively; follow-up measures were 60 (47, 77), and 16.5 (6.7, 57.7) (change from baseline: p\u00a0<\u00a00.001, p\u00a0=\u00a00.31 respectively). At baseline, there were 676 patients with Lp(a) levels <50\u00a0mg/dL [median Lp(a) of 10.9\u00a0mg/dL], and 239 patients with Lp(a) levels\u00a0\u2265\u00a050\u00a0mg/dL [median Lp(a) of 83.2\u00a0mg/dL]. Quartiles of baseline and follow-up Lp(a) did not associate with \u0394PAV. Irrespective of the achieved LDL-C (<vs. \u226570\u00a0mg/dL), neither baseline nor on-treatment (<vs. \u2265median) Lp(a) levels significantly associated with \u0394PAV. No significant differences were observed in \u0394PAV in Lp(a) risers versus non-risers, nor in those patients with baseline or on-treatment Lp(a) levels <vs. > 50\u00a0mg/dL.", 
    "271": "In coronary artery disease patients prescribed long-term maximally intensive statin therapy with low on-treatment LDL-C levels, measured Lp(a) levels (predominantly below the 50\u00a0mg/dL threshold) do not associate with coronary atheroma progression. Alternative biomarkers may thus associate with residual cardiovascular risk in such patients.", 
    "272": "The MEKK3/MEK5/ERK5 signalling axis is required for cardiovascular development in vivo. We analysed the physiological role of ERK5 in cardiac endothelial cells and the consequence of activation of this kinase by the statin class of HMG Co-A reductase inhibitor drugs. We utilised human microvascular endothelial cells (HCMECs) and altered ERK5 expression using siRNA mediated gene silencing or overexpression of constitutively active MEK5 and ERK5 to reveal a role for ERK5 in regulating endothelial tight junction formation and cell permeability. Statin treatment of HCMECs stimulated activation of ERK5 and translocation to the plasma membrane resulting in co-localisation with the tight junction protein ZO-1 and a concomitant reduction in endothelial cell permeability. Statin mediated activation of ERK5 was a consequence of reduced isoprenoid synthesis following HMG Co-A reductase inhibition. Statin pretreatment could overcome the effect of doxorubicin in reducing endothelial tight junction formation and prevent increased permeability. Our data provides the first evidence for the role of ERK5 in regulating endothelial tight junction formation and endothelial cell permeability. Statin mediated ERK5 activation and the resulting decrease in cardiac endothelial cell permeability may contribute to the cardioprotective effects of statins in reducing doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.

    "273": "Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) remains the number one killer in the western world. Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction with statins and ezetimibe has been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. Now, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) monoclonal antibodies (mabs) are available for high-risk individuals with ASCVD or familial hypercholesterolemia on maximally tolerated statin therapy but requiring greater LDL-C reduction. PCSK9 mab outcome trial results from the Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research with PCSK9 Inhibitions in Subjects with Elevated Risk (FOURIER) study, which was presented at the American College of Cardiology in March 2017, which demonstrated a decrease of 15% in primary and 20% secondary end points over a 2-year period [1\u2022\u2022]. These results firmly demonstrated additional benefit beyond maximally tolerated statin therapy in high-risk individuals. Thus, management of LDL-C will soon become more complex, as a new class of medication is added to our standard armamentarium. This review explores the discovery of PCSK9, its biology and physiology, and the development of the PCSK9 mabs.", 
    "274": "Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is still associated with a large burden and causes significant morbidity and mortality. Besides universal vaccination and antibiotic treatment, statins as adjunctive therapy may also have a beneficial role in the prevention and treatment of CAP. Our goal from this review is to discuss the epidemiology of CAP, and role of statins as adjunctive therapy in the development of CAP.", 
    "275": "Statins are lipid-lowering medications characterized by their ability to control hypercholesterolemia in addition to other pleiotropic effects that could explain their role in the pathogenesis of CAP. While most observational studies have shown that statins reduce risk of pneumonia in the general population, patients with diabetes, and recently in patients with myocardial infarction, no randomized controlled trial (RCT) to date has been conducted to assess the efficacy of statins to prevent development of CAP. Given the paucity of robust randomized evidence to assess statin use and the development of CAP, and considering conflicting results of the observational studies, we are not in favor of initiation of statins for either the prevention or treatment of CAP.", 
    "276": "The risk of recurrent stroke is high in patients with intracranial atherosclerotic stenosis (ICAS). Statin use has been demonstrated to decrease the incidence of stroke by reducing atherosclerotic plaque burden. However, its effect on the hemodynamic situation and cerebral perfusion status has not yet been validated. With the use of computed tomography perfusion (CTP), we aim to evaluate the impact of Rosuvastatin on cerebral hemodynamic changes, as well as the downstream perfusion.", 
    "277": "Cerebral bood flow evaluation of intensive rosuvastatin therapy in patients with intracranial arterial atherosclerotic stenosis (CEIRIS) is a single-center, prospective, randomized, parallel-group, and open-label trial, and it will include 50 participants as estimated. Patients with moderate to severe (50%-99%) ICAS are randomized 1:1 to 10\u00a0mg/day or 20\u00a0mg/day Rosuvastatin and followed every 13\u00a0weeks until 52\u00a0weeks. The primary outcome for the trial is the change in the relative regional cerebral blood flow evaluated by CTP after 52\u00a0weeks of Rosuvastatin treatment. The secondary outcomes are cerebral blood volume, change in the degree of stenosis of the target vessel and lipid parameters.", 
    "278": "The CEIRIS trial about the effects of statin on the temporal hemodynamic progression of ICAS may extend our understanding of the basic pathophysiology and mechanisms of stroke in ICAS patients.", 
    "279": "Across the world, health systems are adopting approaches to manage rising healthcare costs. One common strategy is a medication copayments scheme where consumers make a contribution (copayment) towards the cost of their dispensed medicines, with remaining costs subsidised by the health insurance service, which in Australia is the Federal Government.In Australia, copayments have tended to increase in proportion to inflation, but in January 2005, the copayment increased substantially more than inflation. Results from aggregated dispensing data showed that this increase led to a significant decrease in the use of several medicines. The aim of this study is to determine the demographic and clinical characteristics of individuals ceasing or reducing statin medication use following the January 2005 Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme (PBS) copayment increase and the effects on their health outcomes.", 
    "280": "This whole-of-population study comprises a series of retrospective, observational investigations using linked administrative health data on a cohort of West Australians (WA) who had at least one statin dispensed between 1 May 2002 and 30 June 2010. Individual-level data on the use of pharmaceuticals, general practitioner (GP) visits, hospitalisations and death are used.This study will identify patients who were stable users of statin medication in 2004 with follow-up commencing from 2005 onwards. Subgroups determined by change in adherence levels of statin medication from 2004 to 2005 will be classified as continuation, reduction or cessation of statin therapy and explored for differences in health outcomes and health service utilisation after the 2005 copayment change.",
