Inhibition of cardiac remodeling is now a target of multiple therapies, including 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, commonly known as statins, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) ligands. We examined the potential antifibrotic effect of the combination of a statin (pravastatin) and a PPAR-gamma ligand (pioglitazone) in ANG II-treated mouse cardiac fibroblasts. ANG II treatment induced procollagen-1 expression, which was inhibited by pravastatin and pioglitazone in a dose-dependent fashion. Pretreatment of fibroblasts with low therapeutic concentrations of either pravastatin (0.1 microM) or pioglitazone (5 microM) only slightly decreased ANG II-induced NADPH oxidase expression, superoxide anion production, and procollagen-1 expression; however, the combination of pravastatin and pioglitazone markedly modulated these effects of ANG II. The combination also blocked ANG II-mediated p38 MAPK and p44/42 MAPK activation. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that ANG II activated transcription factors NF-kappaB and activator protein-1 (AP-1). Although pravastatin and pioglitazone alone had a variable effect on NF-kappaB and AP-1 activation, their combination exerted a potent inhibitory effect on the activation of both NF-kappaB and AP-1. The effects of pravastatin and pioglitazone in combination on superoxide generation and procollagen-1 expression mimicked those of alpha-tocopherol and gamma-tocopherol, two potent antioxidants. Thus it appears that there is a positive interaction between pravastatin and pioglitazone in modulating ANG II-mediated oxidative stress, inhibiting MAPK activation, and procollagen-1 expression.", 
    "1": "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promotes normal and pathological angiogenesis. VEGF is a chemotactic factor for macrophages and vascular smooth muscle cells, and induces synthesis of metalloproteinases and adhesion molecules. VEGF expression is regulated by hypoxia, cytokines, oncogenes, and oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LDL). The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between levels of lipid parameters and VEGF, to investigate whether pravastatin treatment influences VEGF serum concentrations, and to examine the relationship between VEGF and the variations in post-treatment lipid and inflammatory parameters.",

The controls included 12 individuals aged 50+/-7.4 years with TC <5.1 mmol/L. TC, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLC), triglycerides, LDLC, C-reactive protein (CRP), and VEGF were determined in both groups at baseline, and in the hypercholesterolemic group after 4 months of treatment with 20 mg/day pravastatin.", 
    "3": "A significant correlation was observed between concentrations of VEGF and TC, LDLC and TG, and a significant difference in VEGF concentration was observed between the control group (mean 142 ng/L) and the hypercholesterolemic group (mean 272.9 ng/L). A significant decrease was observed in TC (14.7 %), LDLC (21.5 %), CRP (22.7 %), and VEGF (14.8 %) after 4 months of treatment with pravastatin.",

    "5": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) are widely used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Their efficacy in preventing cardiovascular events has been shown by a large number of clinical trials. However, myotoxic side effects, sometimes severe, including myopathy or rhabdomyolysis, are associated with the use of statins. In some cases, such toxicity is associated with pharmacokinetic alterations. In this review, the pharmacokinetic aspects and physicochemical properties of statins are reviewed in order to understand the mechanism governing their pharmacokinetic alterations. Among the statins, simvastatin, lovastatin and atorvastatin are metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) while fluvastatin is metabolized by CYP2C9. Cerivastatin is subjected to 2 metabolic pathways mediated by CYP2C8 and 3A4. Pravastatin, rosuvastatin and pitavastatin undergo little metabolism. Their plasma clearances are governed by the transporters involved in the hepatic uptake and biliary excretion. Also for other statins, which are orally administered as open acid forms (i.e. fluvastatin, cerivastatin and atorvastatin), hepatic uptake transporter(s) play important roles in their clearances. Based on such information, pharmacokinetic alterations of statins can be predicted following coadministration of other drugs or in patients with lowered activities in drug metabolism and/or transport. We also present a quantitative analysis of the effect of some factors on the pharmacokinetics of statins based on a physiologically based pharmacokinetic model. To avoid a pharmacokinetic alteration, we need to have information about the metabolizing enzyme(s) and transporter(s) involved in the pharmacokinetics of statins and, along with such information, model-based prediction is also useful.", 
    "6": "Statins improve all major lipid fractions, reduce coronary heart disease risk, and may have a minor effect on glucose tolerance. A reduction in free fatty acid flux and concentrations could be partly responsible for these effects. We measured nocturnal and postprandial plasma palmitate concentrations and rate of appearance (R(a)) on 2 occasions in 12 obese dyslipidemic subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus, using a single-blind, crossover format (placebo followed by simvastatin, 80 mg/d), and also on 1 occasion in 6 untreated control subjects. The diabetic subjects had increased average nocturnal (127+/-13 vs 80+/-10 micromol/L, P<.05) and 2-hour postprandial (49+/-6 vs 17+/-2 micromol/L, P<.001) palmitate concentrations, as well as increased nocturnal (31.6+/-3.7 vs 19.5+/-3.7 mmol/m(2) over 9 hours, P<.05) and postprandial (11.5+/-3.7 vs 5.5+/-3.7 mmol/m(2) every 4 hours, P<.005) integrated palmitate R(a) compared to normal controls. High-dose simvastatin reduced serum triglycerides by 35% but had no effect on plasma palmitate concentrations or R(a). These results suggest that the triglyceride-lowering effect of statins is not mediated through an effect on FFA metabolism.", 
    "7": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, so called statins, decrease cardiac events. Previous studies have shown that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors inhibit cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in vitro and in vivo by blocking Rho isoprenylation. We have shown that the G1 cell cycle regulatory proteins cyclin D1 and Cdk4 play important roles in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. However, the relation between Rho and cyclin D1 in cardiomyocyte is unknown. To investigate whether HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors prevent cardiac hypertrophy through attenuation of Rho and cyclin D1, we studied the effect of fluvastatin on angiotensin II-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in vitro and in vivo. Angiotensin II increased the cell surface area and [(3)H]leucine uptake of cultured neonatal rat cardiomyocytes and these changes were suppressed by fluvastatin treatment. Angiotensin II also induced activation of Rho kinase and increased cyclin D1, both of which were also significantly suppressed by fluvastatin. Specific Rho kinase inhibitor, Y-27632 inhibited angiotensin II-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and increased cyclin D1. Overexpression of cyclin D1 by adenoviral gene transfer induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, as evidenced by increased cell size and increased protein synthesis; this hypertrophy was not diminished by concomitant treatment with fluvastatin. Infusion of angiotensin II to Wistar rats for 2 weeks induced hypertrophic changes in cardiomyocytes, and this hypertrophy was prevented by oral fluvastatin treatment. These results show that an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, fluvastatin, prevents angiotensin II-induced cardiomyocyte hypertrophy in part through inhibition of cyclin D1, which is linked to Rho kinase. This novel mechanism discovered for fluvastatin could be revealed how HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are preventing cardiac hypertrophy.", 
    "8": "The effect of multitarget dependent descriptor transformation on classification performance is explored in this work. To this end decision trees as well as neural net QSAR in combination with PLS were applied to predict the activity class of 5HT3 ligands, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, 3-hydroxyl-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, platelet activating factor antagonists, and thromboxane A2 antagonists. Physicochemical descriptors calculated by MOE and fragment-based descriptors (MOLPRINT 2D) were employed to generate descriptor vectors. In a subsequent step the physicochemical descriptor vectors were transformed to a lower dimensional space using multitarget dependent descriptor transformation. Cross-validation of the original physicochemical descriptors in combination with decision trees and neural net QSAR as well as cross-validation of PLS multitarget transformed descriptors with neural net QSAR were performed. For comparison this was repeated using fragment-based descriptors in combination with decision trees.", 
    "9": "Cyclodextrins (CDs) are cyclic oligosaccharides, capable of forming inclusion complexes with hydrophobic molecules in aqueous solution and therefore, of improving the bioavailability of many drugs. They are biocompatible with living cells and do not cause toxic side effects. In this study, interactions in aqueous solutions between chemically different CDs and lovastatin and simvastatin, respectively, were investigated. It was found that the solubility of both statins can be considerably increased by the CD derivatives. The influence of the chemical structure of CD and of the temperature and pH on the solubility of the statin derivatives is described. Possible ways of increasing the solubility of these cholesterol-lowering drugs and their utilization in practice are also outlined.",

GFR, AER, and SD protein mRNA were studied in 86 microalbuminuric, hypertensive, type II diabetics at baseline and after 4-year random double-blind treatment either with 40 mg simvastatin (Group 1) or with 30 g cholestyramine (Group 2) per day. Both groups had at baseline a GFR decay per year in the previous 2-4 years of 3 ml/min/1.73 m(2). Both Groups 1 and 2 showed a significant decrease of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels after simvastatin and cholestyramine treatment (P<0.01). No change from base line values was observed as for hs-C-reactive protein and interleukin-6. A significant decrease of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine urinary excretion was observed after simvastatin treatment. GFR did not change from baseline with simvstatin, whereas a decrease was observed with cholestyramine treatment (simvastatin vs cholestyramine: -0.21 vs -2.75 ml/min/1.73 m(2), P<0.01). AER decreased in Group 1 (P<0.01), but not in Group 2 patients. Real-time polymerase chain reaction measurement of mRNA SD proteins (CD2AP, FAT, Actn 4, NPHS1, and NPHS2) significantly increased in kidney biopsy specimens after simvastatin, but not cholestyramine treatment. Simvastatin, but not cholestyramine, 4-year treatment maintains steady patterns of GFR, and improves AER and expression of SD proteins in type II diabetes, despite similar hypocholesterolemic effects in circulation.",

Hyperlipidemia can alter vascular endothelial function and impair some of its pro-fibrinolytic and anti-thrombotic regulatory properties, as well as initiate the atherosclerotic process. There are strong links between vascular changes and hyperlipidemia in children, both from pathologic and non-invasive assessment studies. More severe lipid abnormalities in children are related to primary familial dyslipidemias. Current recommendations for screening begin with assessment of family history for cardiovascular disease or events or parental hyperlipidemia. High-risk individuals merit more intensive investigation and intervention. While fat-restricted diets have been shown to be safe in children, lipid-lowering is modest. Those with more severe lipid abnormalities may meet criteria for drug therapy, and the statin agents commonly used in adults are increasingly being used in high-risk children, with similar efficacy and safety, although long-term concerns remain.",

Primary reasons for discussing cholesterol or cardiac risk factors and assessment in urology include (a) the primary cause of death of men and women in the United States and most countries around the world is CVD; (b) the primary or secondary cause of death from the largest cancer prevention trials (high or average risk) is CVD; (c) the primary or secondary cause of death in men with prostate cancer is CVD; (d) there may be a correlation in some of the mechanisms that contribute to CVD and mechanisms that contribute to numerous urologic conditions, such as benign prostatic hyperplasia, bladder cancer, erectile dysfunction, female sexual dysfunction, kidney cancer, and prostate cancer; and (e) one of the better methods to monitor the success of lifestyle changes for the patient in urology is to monitor these CVD markers, as is the case in some lifestyle studies of men with prostate cancer.", 
    "56": "Patients with left ventricular dysfunction who are undergoing major noncardiac vascular surgery are at increased risk of adverse postoperative events. We sought to evaluate whether perioperative medication use, including angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta-blockers, statins, and aspirin, was associated with a reduced incidence of postoperative in-hospital mortality in these high-risk patients. The study enrolled 511 patients with left ventricular dysfunction (left ventricular ejection fraction <30%) who were undergoing major noncardiac vascular surgery. Cardiac risk factors and medication use were noted before surgery. Preoperative dobutamine stress echocardiography (DSE) was performed to identify patients with stress-induced myocardial ischemia. The end point was postoperative in-hospital mortality. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the relation between perioperative medication use and mortality. The mean age of the study population was 64 +/- 11 years, and 75% were men. Perioperative use of ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, statins, and aspirin was recorded in 215 (48%), 139 (27%), 107 (21%), and 125 patients (24%), respectively. Stress-induced myocardial ischemia occurred in 82 patients (16%). Sixty-four patients (13%) died. Perioperative use of ACE inhibitors (odds ratio [OR], 0.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.12-0.91), beta-blockers (OR, 0.03; 95% CI, 0.01-0.26), statins (OR, 0.06; 95% CI, 0.01-0.53), and aspirin (OR, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.03-0.55), was significantly associated with a reduced incidence of mortality, after adjusting for cardiac risk factors and DSE results. In conclusion, the present study showed that the perioperative use of ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, statins, and aspirin is independently associated with a reduced incidence of in-hospital mortality in patients with left ventricular dysfunction who are undergoing major noncardiac vascular surgery.", 
    "57": "Since positive coronary artery remodeling with large plaque burden is associated with subsequent coronary events, the authors tested their hypothesis that secondary prevention of coronary events by a statin may be associated with inhibition of the process of positive coronary artery remodeling in underlying coronary atherosclerotic lesions in patients with coronary artery diseases. They evaluated the intravascular ultrasound imaging in angiographically normal coronary lesions at baseline and after 6 months of therapy in 64 patients with coronary artery diseases. External elastic membrane area was defined as the vessel area, and the difference between the vessel and lumen area was calculated as plaque area. The relative echogenicity of coronary plaque to adventitia was evaluated as acoustic characteristics of coronary plaque. Twenty-five patients were treated with a statin and 39 patients did not receive a statin. In patients treated with a statin, plaque area decreased by 12% (p = 0.013) compared to an increase in plaque area of 13% (p = 0.023) in those who did not receive a statin. The vessel area was not enlarged in patients treated with a statin but did show positive remodeling in patients who had plaque progression without a statin. The relative echogenicity of plaque was unchanged in patients treated with a statin but significantly decreased in patients not receiving a statin. A statin may prevent positive coronary artery remodeling via inhibition of plaque progression in underlying coronary atherosclerotic lesions in patients with coronary artery diseases.",

It is a multisystemic disorder in which cholesterol crystals released from atherosclerotic plaques obstruct small arterioles, resulting in local ischemia and end-organ damage. There are no established treatments, and with the limited treatment options available, it is important to make the diagnosis as early as possible. We present the case of a 68-year-old man with cholesterol embolism who had a few fluttering atheromas in the aorta, as demonstrated by transesophageal ultrasonography. The diagnosis was confirmed by skin biopsy, and treatment with statins and steroids proved effective, as renal failure progressively improved. This case emphasizes the importance of early diagnosis and shows the possible therapeutic effects of statins and steroids for patients with this syndrome.",

We defined as MACE the occurrence of death, myocardial infarction, or need for target lesion revascularization. From this cohort, 103 patients had at least one lipid parameter from the lipid profile evaluated within 2 months from the date of the procedure. Patients who had the stent because of an acute myocardial infarction were included in the study only if their lipid profile was evaluated before or at least 6 weeks after the event. Patients with triglyceride levels above 500 had both triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels excluded from the statistical analysis.

    "66": "Data concerning the treatment of lipoprotein disturbances in patients with cerebrovascular disease (CVD) are less robust than those for coronary heart disease (CHD), raising clinical questions as to which is the appropriate therapeutic approach to stroke patients. Although observational cohort studies have failed to demonstrate an association between lipoprotein disorders and stroke incidence, recently completed trials of subjects at risk for CHD have shown that statins reduce not only the risk of myocardial infarction and death, but also that of brain infarction and transient ischemic attacks. At present, it seems reasonable to conclude that stroke patients with undesirable lipid profiles who have a history of CHD should receive specific treatment for the lipid disorder. Recommendations are more problematic for stroke patients with lipid disorder but no history of CHD. Furthermore, many of the risk factors for CVD and vascular dementia (VaD), including serum total cholesterol (TC), lipoprotein(a), diabetes, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, apolipoprotein E levels, and atherosclerosis, have also been shown to increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In a recent study, we estimated the prevalence, incidence and rate of progression of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to dementia, and correlated vascular risk factors with incident MCI and its progression to dementia. We evaluated 2963 individuals from the population-based sample of 5632 subjects 65-84 years old of the Italian Longitudinal Study on Aging, with a 3.5-year follow-up. We found a progression rate to dementia (all causes) of 3.8/100 person-years. Furthermore, age was a risk factor for incident MCI, while education was protective, and serum TC evidenced a non-significant borderline trend for a protective effect. There was a non-significant trend for stroke as a risk factor of progression of MCI to dementia. In conclusion, in our population, among MCI patients who progressed to dementia, 60% progressed to AD and 33% to VaD. Vascular risk factors and CVD may influence the development of MCI and the rate of progression to dementia.",

    "75": "A rice bran oil (RBO) diet can reduce plasma lipids; this was attributed to the specific components, gamma-oryzanol and gamma-tocotrienol, which individually were shown to be hypocholesterolemic; however, the mechanism of their effects on diabetic hyperlipidemia and the development of diabetes is not known. Rats with streptozotocin/nicotinamide-induced type 2 diabetes were divided into control, RO10, and RO15 groups, and fed cholesterol-free diets containing 0, 10, and 15 g RBO with 0, 352, and 528 g gamma-oryzanol and 0, 6.0 and 9.0 mg gamma-tocotrienol/100 g diet for 4 wk. Diabetic rats fed the RBO diet had greater insulin sensitivity (P = 0.02) than rats fed the control diet. Diabetic rats fed the RBO diet also had lower plasma triglyceride (P = 0.003), LDL cholesterol (P = 0.028), and hepatic triglyceride concentrations (P = 0.04), as well as greater fecal neutral sterol and bile acid excretion than those fed the control diet. After 4 wk, there was an approximately 100% (P < 0.001) increase in the abundance of hepatic cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase, an 89% (P < 0.001) increase in the hepatic LDL-receptor, and a 50% (P < 0.001) increase in hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase mRNA in rats fed the RBO diet compared with those fed the control diet. These findings support the conclusion that a rice bran oil-containing diet can significantly suppress hyperlipidemic and hyperinsulinemic responses in diabetic rats. The high contents of gamma-oryzanol and gamma-tocotrienol in RBO can lead to increased fecal neutral sterol and bile acid excretion, via upregulation of cholesterol synthesis and catabolism.", 
    "76": "Statins, specific inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase, are now widely used for treatment of patients with hypercholesterolemia. In addition to the reduction of cholesterol biosynthesis, accumulating evidence indicates that statins have several pleiotropic effects especially on cardiovascular system. However, the exact role of statin in cardiac myocytes remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated whether atorvastatin induces vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) release in cardiac myocytes, and the underlying mechanism. We observed that atorvastatin significantly stimulated VEGF release in a dose-dependent manner. It induced the phosphorylation of p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and p38 MAP kinase but not SAPK (stress-activated protein kinase)/JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase). The atorvastatin-induced VEGF release was enhanced by PD98059, which is a specific inhibitor of the upstream kinase that activates p44/p42 MAP kinase (MEK). Further, it was significantly reduced by SB203580, a specific inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase. Furthermore, the atorvastatin-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase was attenuated by SB203580, whereas it was enhanced by PD98059. Taken together, these results suggest that the atorvastatin-induced VEGF release in cardiac myocytes is positively regulated by p38 MAP kinase and negatively regulated byp44/p42 MAP kinase and that the atorvastatin-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase is regulated by p44/p42 MAP kinase in these cells.", 
    "77": "Severe pulmonary hypertension (SPH) is characterized by precapillary arteriolar lumen obliteration, dramatic right ventricular hypertrophy, and pericardial effusion. Our recently published rat model of SPH recapitulates major components of the human disease. We used this model to develop new treatment strategies for SPH. SPH in rats was induced using VEGF receptor blockade in combination with chronic hypoxia. A large variety of drugs used in this study, including anticancer drugs (cyclophosphamide and paclitaxel), the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril, the antiangiogenic agent thalidomide, and the peroxisome proliferator-actived receptor-gamma agonist PGJ2, failed to decrease mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) or right ventricular hypertrophy. In contrast, treatment of rats with established SPH with simvastatin markedly reduced mean PAP and right ventricular hypertrophy, and this reduction was associated with caspase-3 activation and pulmonary microvascular endothelial cell apoptosis. Simvastatin partially restored caveolin-1, caveolin-2, and phospho-caveolin expression in vessel walls. In rat primary pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells, simvastatin induced caspase 3 activation and Rac 1 expression while suppressing Rho A and attenuated levels of Akt and ERK phosphorylation. We conclude that simvastatin is effective in inducing apoptosis in hyperproliferative pulmonary vascular lesions and could be considered as a potential drug for treatment of human SPH.",

Darbepoetin alfa increased haemoglobin levels in heart failure patients and improved some aspects of quality of life compared to placebo. In the ASTEROID study rosuvastatin significantly reduced LDL-cholesterol levels and induced regression of atherosclerosis in patients with CAD. Rosuvastatin also produced a significant reduction in LDL-cholesterol levels in heart failure patients in the UNIVERSE study, but had no effect on left ventricular remodelling compared to placebo. The paediatric carvedilol study failed to show a benefit of carvedilol in children with heart failure. Ultrafiltration produced a greater weight and fluid loss than intravenous diuretics in heart failure patients with volume overload in the UNLOAD study but did not exert a greater improvement in breathlessness; however, ultrafiltration did reduce readmission rates.

Treatment with rosuvastatin prevented pressure-induced cardiac hypertrophy (5.5+/-0.18, p<0.05). TAC induced a 4-fold up-regulation of myocardial NADPH oxidase activity as well as Rac1 activity; both effects were absent in statin-treated animals. In cultured rat cardiomyocytes, treatment with angiotensin II (AngII) increased translocation of Rac1 to cell membranes and Rac1 activity. AngII altered neither expression nor tyrosine phosphorylation of GTPase activating protein GAP-p190 and the guanine nucleotide exchange factors Vav and Tiam. Transaortic constriction as well as AngII increased the binding of Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (RhoGDIalpha) to Rac1. The association of RhoGDIalpha with Rac1 was mediated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and depended on geranylgeranylation. Statin treatment inhibited RhoGDIalpha-Rac1 binding both in cultured cardiomyocytes and during myocardial hypertrophy in vivo. Transfection with RhoGDIalpha siRNA constructs potently reduced RhoGDIalpha protein expression, decreased AngII-induced superoxide production and lipid peroxidation, and inhibited AngII-induced leucine incorporation.",

Naturally occurring polymorphisms in OATP1B1, including *5, *9, *15, and *18, were associated with profound loss of activity toward rosuvastatin. Interestingly, the major human hepatic bile acid uptake transporter NTCP, but not rat Ntcp, also transported rosuvastatin. Human hepatocyte studies suggested that NTCP alone accounted for approximately 35% of rosuvastatin uptake. Remarkably, NTCP*2, a variant known to have a near complete loss of function for bile acids, exhibited a profound gain of function for rosuvastatin. Quantitative messenger RNA analysis revealed marked intersubject variability in expression of OATPs and NTCP.", 
    "86": "Multiple transporters mediate the overall hepatic uptake of rosuvastatin, and NTCP may be a heretofore unrecognized transporter important to the disposition of rosuvastatin and possibly other drugs/statins in clinical use.

Persistent inflammation is an additional risk factor; 3) The cardiovascular risk should be evaluated, and modifiable risk factors should be corrected; 4) In patients with RA requiring glucocorticoid therapy, the need for cardiovascular risk minimization is among the reasons that mandate the use of the minimal effective dose; 5) It should be recognized that methotrexate may protect against cardiovascular mortality in patients with RA; 6) It should be recognized that TNFalpha antagonists remain contraindicated in patients with RA and severe heart failure. TNFalpha antagonists do not seem to worsen moderate heart failure and may protect against cardiovascular mortality; 7) AFSSAPS recommendations about LDL-cholesterol objectives should be followed, with active RA being counted as a cardiovascular risk factor; 8) In patients with RA, statin therapy should be considered only when cholesterol levels are elevated despite appropriate dietary treatment; 9) RA per se does not indicate aspirin for primary prevention. When aspirin is used for secondary prevention, it should be recognized that concomitant treatment with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may decrease the antiplatelet effects and increase the gastrointestinal side effects of aspirin therapy.",

    "121": "Atherosclerosis is a progressive, lifelong condition that is the leading cause of death among middle-aged and elderly individuals aged > or =65 years. Up to 80% of elderly patients are found to have evidence of obstructive coronary heart disease at autopsy. Demographic trends, including the advancing median age and life expectancy of Western societies, suggest that a large share of the burden of atherosclerotic plaque is likely to be borne by elderly individuals. These trends are in part due to increases in a number of chronic diseases associated with adverse cardiovascular outcomes, including metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease. Because the elderly have a higher attributable risk of coronary heart disease as a result of hypercholesterolaemia, more coronary deaths and overall events can be prevented via treatment in this age group compared with younger persons with hypercholesterolaemia. The efficacy, safety and tolerability of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have been confirmed in randomised, controlled, multicentre trials involving large numbers of patients aged > or =65 years. Although muscle symptoms such as myalgia are relatively common adverse events, more severe signs of myolysis such as myopathy and rhabdomyolysis are rare, but their risk is elevated by conditions (e.g. concomitant medications) that increase the systemic exposure of these agents. Statins differ in their susceptibility to increases in systemic exposure, but most statins have been demonstrated to be well tolerated and safe when administered to elderly patients. These favourable clinical findings should help clinicians counter highly prevalent 'ageism' bias in statin prescribing, whereby elderly patients, particularly those at highest cardiovascular risk, are often denied the benefits of statins without any meaningful foundation.",

He experienced stiffness, myalgias, and classic rippling, which was confirmed on clinical examination. Discontinuation of the statin improved his symptoms. Simvastatin therapy was resumed and resulted in a prompt and severe return of his symptoms. Approximately 1 year after symptom onset he developed mild seropositive oculobulbar myasthenia gravis, which spontaneously remitted after 5 months. We postulate that an immune-mediated disruption of caveolar function was exacerbated by statin exposure. We are unaware of any previous cases of statin-mediated unmasking of RMD.",

To further investigate the mechanical contribution of NM myosin to force maintenance during smooth muscle contraction, we utilized a selective inhibitor of the NM myosin ATPase, blebbistatin [Straight et al. (2003) Science 299:1743-1747]. Force and myosin light chain (MLC(20)) phosphorylation were measured during KCl stimulation of small strips of intact mouse bladder and aorta at 22 degrees C. The bladder strips contracted with a typical phasic force response, characterized by a large, rapid, transient increase in force followed by a decline to a lower, steady-state level. The addition of blebbistatin did not alter the peak force, but decreased force maintenance. KCl depolarization of aortic strips resulted in a tonic contraction; force increased to a sustained steady state. Similar to the bladder tissue, blebbistatin substantially decreased the steady-state force in the aorta. Blebbistatin did not influence the MLC(20) phosphorylation transient in either tissue type. Additionally, blebbistatin did not change the maximum shortening velocity (V (max)) during KCl depolarization of the aorta. Our results also suggest that NMIIA and NMIIB isoforms are differentially expressed. The expression of NMIIA is more prominent in the bladder, while NMIIB expression is predominant in the aorta. These results suggest that NM myosin contributes to the mechanism of force maintenance in smooth muscle, and could suggest that the expression of NMIIB is a factor for determining the tonic contractile phenotype.",

In NSY mice, atorvastatin accelerated glucose intolerance as a result of insulin resistance and decreased SLC2A4 expression in WAT.

Acute colitis was induced using 8% DSS in female BALB/c mice. Colonic mucosal inflammation was evaluated clinically, biochemically, and histologically. Mucosal protein contents and mRNA levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were determined by immunoassay and real time-PCR. The mRNA levels of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) were determined by real-time PCR. Disease activity scores in DSS-induced colitis model mice, as determined by weight loss, stool consistency, and blood in stool, were significantly lower in the rosuvastatin-treated mice than in control mice. Shortening of the colon was significantly reversed by rosuvastatin. Increases in tissue-associated myeloperoxidase activity and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances after DSS administration were both significantly inhibited by treatment with rosuvastatin. Rosuvastatin also inhibited increases in intestinal TNF-alpha protein and mRNA expression after DSS administration, respectively. The mucosal mRNA levels of eNOS were decreased after DSS administration, but preserved in mice treated with rosuvastatin. These results suggest that rosuvastatin prevents the development of DSS-induced colitis in mice via the inhibition of mucosal inflammatory responses associated with the preservation of eNOS transcription.",

Recent studies have shown a Th2-biasing effect of statins, although the underlying mechanism has not been identified. In this study, we investigated whether simvastatin can exercise a Th2-promoting effect through modulation of function of dendritic cells (DCs) without direct interaction with CD4+ T cells. Exposure of DCs to simvastatin induced the differentiation of a distinct subset of DCs characterized by a high expression of B220. These simvastatin-conditioned DCs up-regulated GATA-3 expression and down-regulated T-bet expression in cocultured CD4+ T cells in the absence of additional simvastatin added to the coculture. The Th2-biased transcription factor profile induced by simvastatin-treated DCs also was accompanied by increased Th2 (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13) and decreased Th1 (IFN-gamma) cytokine secretion from the T cells. The Th2-promoting effect of simvastatin was found to depend on the chitinase family member Ym1, known to be a lectin. Anti-Ym1 antibody abolished the Th2-promoting effect of simvastatin-treated DCs. Also, simvastatin was unable to augment Ym1 expression in DCs developed from STAT6-/- or IL-4R alpha-/- mice. Thus, modulation of Ym1 production by DCs identifies a previously undescribed mechanism of Th2 polarization by statin.",

A healthy lifestyle decreases serum CRP levels, while obesity, physical inactivity, and smoking increase them. CRP, a stable pentameric protein, has a half-life of 19 hr, is not subject to diurnal variation, and can serve as a marker of wellness and a candidate for future direct access testing for people monitoring their health after adopting a healthier lifestyle. The CRP level may be influenced more by lifestyle than by genetics. Monozygotic twins may not have the same CRP level; within each twin pair, the one with higher adiposity generally has a higher CRP level than the one with low adiposity. Chronic diseases generally have a lower prevalence among Asians than among Westerners. Asians also have lower CRP levels than Westerners. In large population studies, the median CRP level of Asians is only one-tenth that of Westerners. Is there a factor in the lifestyle or diet of Asians that accounts for lower CRP levels? For example, a statin inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis occurs in red yeast rice, an important component of the Asian diet. In summary, CRP is a marker for monitoring cardiovascular therapy and assessing the wellness of the general population. Through improving health and preventing disease, CRP testing may help lower a nation's health costs.",

Six patients in group I (25%) and 2 patients in group II (8.3%) had spontaneous conversion before EC (p >0.05). The end point was the recurrence of AF during 3 months of follow-up. Eighteen patients in group I (12.5%) and 11 patients in group II (45.8%) had recurrence (p = 0.01, log-rank test). With the Cox proportional model, the predictors of recurrence included a body mass index of 25 to 30 kg/m2 (relative risk [RR] 0.07, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.008 to 0.59), body mass index > or = 30 kg/m2 (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.72), AF duration of > or = 3 months (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.83), diabetes mellitus (RR 0.34, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.98), and left atrial diameter of > or = 45 mm (RR 0.23, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.74).

Recent studies have associated statin, aspirin, and beta-blocker therapies with improved postoperative outcome. However, the effect of all these factors on LOS has not been defined. Our aims were to determine the effect of cardiac risk factors and (preventive) statin, aspirin, and beta-blocker therapy on LOS and to deduce from these factors a model that predicts LOS. In total, 2,374 patients from 1990 to 2004 were enrolled. Mean LOS was 18 +/- 9 days. Cardiac risk factors that were significantly associated with LOS in the multivariable analysis were age, previous heart failure, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, renal failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Statin and aspirin use was associated with a shorter LOS. Beta blockers shortened LOS only in patients with underlying coronary artery disease. Together, these factors explained 14.1% of the variance in LOS. In conclusion, in-hospital LOS in patients who undergo major vascular surgery can be predicted more accurately by clinical cardiac risk factors. A significant decrease in in-hospital LOS was achieved with statin, aspirin, and beta-blocker therapies.", 
    "159": "We have been examining the role of heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) in the pleiotropic effects of statins. In parallel studies, we found that statin induces the nuclear translocation of HSF1 and that a decoy oligonucleotide encoding the heat shock element inhibits the statin-induced expression of heat shock protein 70, endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and thrombomodulin. Also, in vascular endothelial cells, increases in the expression of human HSF1 corresponded with elevated steady-state levels of eNOS and thrombomodulin and reduced levels of endothelin-1 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. We also found that heat shock proteins induced eNOS and thrombomodulin expression and reduced PAI-1 and ET-1 expression. In particular, a combination of HSP70 and HSP90 strongly induced eNOS expression and reduced PAI-1 expression. In the current studies, we generated a constitutively active form of HSF1 and found that it is more effective than the wild-type HSF at inducing thrombomodulin and eNOS expression and decreasing endothelin-1 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 expression. These results show that the wild-type and constitutively active forms of HSF1 induce anticoagulation and relaxation factors in vascular endothelial cells and could therefore be used to treat cardiovascular disease.", 
    "160": "Clinical trials have indicated that the use of fibric acid derivatives confers a benefit against cardiovascular disease (CVD) in selected populations. However, whether fibrates provide a CVD risk reduction independent of changes in the traditional lipoprotein fractions and other known CVD risk factors is not clear.",

    "162": "This was a matched, retrospective cohort study. From the electronic records of a large health maintenance organization in the northwestern United States, we identified a population that had newly initiated fibrate pharmacotherapy between January 1, 1996, and December 31, 2000. We then identified a comparator group of patients not using fibrates, matching them to fibrate users based on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglyceride (TG) levels, age, sex, and year of HDL-C and TG measurement. Subjects were followed until a CVD hospitalization, termination from the health plan, or December 31, 2003, whichever came first. We then used multivariate analysis accounting for differences in followup to identify predictors of CVD incidence.", 
    "163": "The study population included 1722 matched pairs (56.6% male; mean [SD] age, 57.3 [11.1] years). The patients who had newly initiated fibrate pharmacotherapy had low baseline HDL-C levels (mean, 37.4 mg/dL) and very high TG levels (617 mg/dL). The 2 groups were similar overall, with the only significant differences between fibrate users and nonfibrate controls being a greater prevalence of diabetes (37.7% vs 34.3%, respectively; P=0.040) and greater use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin-receptor blockers (56.6% vs 51.6%, respectively; P=0.003), beta-blockers (53.7% vs 49.0%; P=0.006), calcium channel blockers (25.1% vs 20.9%; P=0.004), and niacin (11.7% vs 7.4%; P<0.001). Overall, CVD risk was 26% lower for every 5-mg/dL increment in HDL-C. After adjustment for age, sex, smoking history, diabetes, existing diagnosis of CVD, weight, systolic blood pressure, baseline HDL-C, change in HDL-C, total cholesterol, TG, and use of statins, niacin, and other CVD drugs, fibrate use did not confer an additional CVD risk reduction.", 
    "164": "In this cohort with low baseline HDL-C levels and very high TG levels, fibrate use did not confer an independent CVD risk reduction after adjustment for CVD risk factors. Given the current obesity epidemic in the United States and the corresponding rise in the number of patients with the metabolic syndrome, the apparent risk reduction observed in association with higher HDL-C levels should not be ignored.",

However, the impact of OATP1B1*1b alleles, the frequency of which is high in all ethnicities, on the pharmacokinetics of substrate drugs is not known after complete separation of subjects with OATP1B1*1a and *1b. Furthermore, the correlation between the clearances of OATP1B1 substrate drugs in individuals has not been characterized. We investigated the effect of genetic polymorphism of OATP1B1, particularly the *1b allele, on the pharmacokinetics of 3 anionic drugs, pravastatin, valsartan, and temocapril, in Japanese subjects.",

Carriers of *1b/*15 (38.2 +/- 15.9 ng.h/mL) exhibited a 45% lower AUC than *1a/*15 carriers (69.2 +/- 23.4 ng.h/mL) (P = .024). In the case of valsartan we observed a similar trend as with pravastatin, although the difference was not statistically significant (9.01 +/- 3.33 microg.h/mL for *1b/*1b carriers versus 12.3 +/- 4.6 microg.h/mL for *1a/*1a carriers [P = .171] and 6.31 +/- 3.64 microg.h/mL for *1b/*15 carriers versus 9.40 +/- 4.34 microg.h/mL for *1a/*15 carriers [P = .213]). The AUC of temocapril also showed a similar trend (12.4 +/- 4.1 ng.h/mL for *1b/*1b carriers versus 18.5 +/- 7.7 ng.h/mL for *1a/*1a carriers [P = .061] and 16.4 +/- 5.0 ng.h/mL for *1b/*15 carriers versus 19.0 +/- 4.1 ng.h/mL for *1a/*15 carriers [P = .425]), whereas that of temocaprilat (active form of temocapril) was not significantly affected by the haplotype of OATP1B1. Interestingly, the AUC of valsartan and temocapril in each subject was significantly correlated with that of pravastatin (R = 0.630 and 0.602, P < .01). The renal clearance remained unchanged for each haplotype for all drugs.", 
    "168": "The major clearance mechanism of pravastatin, valsartan, and temocapril appears to be similar, and OATP1B1*1b is one of the determinant factors governing the interindividual variability in the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin and, possibly, valsartan and temocapril.",

The most up-regulated genes were troponin T3, actin alpha1, tubulin alpha1, regulator of G-protein signaling 5 (Rgs5), stathmin-like 2 and myosin light chain kinase. Most of them are related with cytoskeleton organization, while Rgs5 is a G-protein signal transduction molecule. The most down-regulated genes were adenosine deaminase, atrial natriuretic peptide, troponin T2, FXYD domain-containing ion transport regulator 3, and glutathione S-transferase alpha4.",

Not least among these reports is that from the van den Bergh group, who provide further data on their intensive insulin protocol in a more heterogeneous group, namely medical intensive care unit patients. Finally, we discuss another good reason to take statins.", 
    "178": "The influence of cholesterol and the lovastatin (cholesterol-lowering drug) on secretion of alpha-secretase cleavage product of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and expression of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) was investigated in human HTB-15 astrocytes. The results showed that exposure of cholesterol to astrocytes inhibited the secretion of alpha-form of secreted APP (alphaAPPs) and reduced cell viability, while lovastatin enhanced the alpha-secretase processing on astrocytes; cholesterol treatment decreased expression of alpha7 nAChR, whereas lovastatin induced an up-regulation of the receptor; the increase in alphaAPPs resulted from lovastatin was partially inhibited by the alpha7 nAChR antagonists, alpha-bungarotoxin or methyllycaconitine; cholesterol or lovastatin did not influence either whole APP level or expression of alpha4 nAChR. We suggest that high dose of cholesterol may inhibit both the activity of alpha-secretase in APP metabolic processing and the expression of alpha7 nAChR, while lovastatin may stimulate alpha-secretase cleavage processing that might be regulated by alpha7 nAChR.",

The objective of this study is to measure these treatments' impact on the cardiovascular (CV) mortality rate among patients receiving usual care in the province of Quebec.", 
    "180": "The study population consisted of a \"naturalistic\" cohort of all patients > or = 65 years old living in the Quebec province, who survived a MI (ICD-9: 410) in 1998. The studied dependant variable was time to death from a CV disease. Independent variables were revascularization procedure and cardioprotective drugs. Death from a non CV disease was also studied for comparison. Revascularization procedure was defined as percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG). The exposure to cardioprotective drugs was defined as the number of cardioprotective drug classes (Acetylsalicylic Acid (ASA), Beta-Blockers, Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitors, Statins) claimed within the index period (first 30 days after the index hospitalization). Age, gender and a comorbidity index were used as covariates. Kaplan-Meier survival curves, Cox proportional hazard models, logistic regressions and regression trees were used.", 
    "181": "The study population totaled 5596 patients (3206 men; 2390 women). We observed 1128 deaths (20%) within two years following index hospitalization, of them 603 from CV disease. The CV survival rate at two years is much greater for patients with revascularization, regardless of pharmacological treatments. For patients without revascularization, the CV survival rate increases with the number of cardioprotective drug classes claimed. Finally, Cox proportional hazard models, regression tree and logistic regression analyses all revealed that the absence of revascularization and, to a lower extent, absence of cardioprotective drugs were major predictors for CV death, even after adjusting for age, gender and comorbidity.", 
    "182": "Considering usual care management of MI in the province of Quebec in 1998, CV survival is positively correlated to the presence of a revascularization procedure and to the intensity of cardioprotective pharmacological treatment. These results are coherent with data from randomized control trials.", 
    "183": "Although the healthcare program in Canada is in many ways universal, there are several differences between the provinces. Two key federal bodies (the Health Protection Branch of Health Canada and the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board) are involved in the drug review process. In addition, the Canadian Coordinating Office for Health Technology Assessment (CCOHTA), an organization funded jointly by provinces and the federal government, reviews new or existing drugs at the request of provinces. Each province or territory and the federal government has its own drug plan or plans. The 10 Canadian provinces require a notice of compliance, information on pricing, and clinical and comparative information for submission of a new drug. Over the last 3 years, 8 of the 10 provinces have required pharmacoeconomic analyses to be added to the submissions. Four of the eight provinces requiring pharmacoeconomic evaluations have specified that these evaluations should be made according to the Canadian Coordinating Office for Health Technology Assessment guidelines. A review of the utilization patterns of lipid-lowering therapies is presented in this Canadian context. Statins comprised 80% of the lipid-lowering drug market in 1995. Prescribers use statins available in Canada interchangeably for all approved and nonapproved indications. The newest statin, atorvastatin, has attained a market share for new prescriptions equivalent to simvastatin and pravastatin, despite the lack of clinical outcome studies. CCOHTA reviewed the evidence of efficacy and effectiveness of statins, evaluated whether significant differences existed between statins, and analyzed published economic evaluations. It found that treatment of higher-risk patients with statins is more cost-effective than that of lower-risk subjects. The evaluation also concluded that the statins, as a class, probably act in reducing LDL and raising HDL, resulting in beneficial clinical outcomes.", 
    "184": "The first formal economic evaluation of a lipid-lowering intervention was conducted almost 20 years ago. The field exploded in the mid-1980s following the publication of findings from the Lipid Research Clinics Coronary Primary Prevention Trial (LRC-CPPT), in which the bile-acid sequestrant, cholestyramine, was reported to reduce the incidence of coronary artery disease in adults with significant elevations in cholesterol. Almost all of the early pharmacoeconomic studies that followed focused on this agent. Later in the decade, the introduction of lovastatin, the first 3-hydroxy-3 methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor (or \"statin\"), revolutionized the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, as it was significantly more effective than earlier agents (as were the other statins that followed it). Pharmacoeconomic studies of the statins generally have reported that, despite their higher cost, they are significantly more cost-effective than bile acid sequestrants. Recent long-term clinical trials, such as the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS) and the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S), have provided firm evidence of the benefits of the statins in both the primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease. Formal economic evaluations were incorporated into most of these end-point studies-in contrast to morbidity and mortality trials of earlier lipid-lowering agents-and results from these evaluations are just now becoming available. The availability of primary economic data derived directly from large-scale, long-term clinical trials raises important questions about the future role of modeling in this area.", 
    "185": "To consider the benefits and risks of large postmarketing outcomes studies, as demonstrated by studies of the statin drugs.", 
    "186": "Literature review.", 
    "187": "The risks were that the statin studies had a strong coat-tail effect. Each new study was beneficial to all statins as well as the one studied. Economic analyses based on the results of the postmarketing studies concluded that the drugs were not cost-effective. Long-term postmarketing studies were slow to be put into perspective and did not immediately influence other researchers or clinicians. During that time, the sponsoring companies shouldered opportunity costs as well as the actual costs of the studies. The risk that one drug company would use another company's results instead of investing in their own research did not materialize. The benefits were that the studies definitively showed that the drugs and the lowering of lipids were safe and efficacious. The studies also expanded the indications for the drugs, generated goodwill in the medical and research communities for the sponsors, allowed sponsors to include specific claims in their advertisements, generated follow-up studies, spawned economic analyses that sparked interest in the medical and lay press, and had a major impact on clinicians' use of the drug.", 
    "188": "The risks and benefits of postmarketing studies may depend on the company's time perspective. In the short term, the risks may outweigh the benefits. Only companies that have a longer perspective may find it beneficial to undertake large postmarketing studies.", 
    "189": "Statins are the most commonly prescribed agents for the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia. This is due to their efficacy in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) level which is the primary goal of the treatment especially for patients with multiple risk factors or with established coronary heart diseases. The purpose of this study was to develop a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model that describes the LDL-lowering process in patients with hypercholesterolaemia treated with atorvastatin, fluvastatin or simvastatin. A total of 100 patients were studied retrospectively. They received atorvastatin (n = 57), fluvastatin (n = 26) or simvastatin (n = 17). As no pharmacokinetic data were available, the absorption rate was fixed to 1/h and atorvastatin, simvastatin and fluvastatin elimination half-lives were fixed to 14, 2 and 2.5 h respectively. A total of 309 LDL levels were measured and the data were analysed by nonmem v. The time course of the LDL-lowering effect of statins was described by an indirect-response model with precursor (LDL synthesis, input rate K(in)) and response (circulating LDL, input and output rates K) compartments. The following parameters were estimated: LDL input rate (K(in)) 0.14 +/- 0.015 g/L/day (mean +/- SD); inhibition fraction of K(in) (INH) 0.21 +/- 0.017; and dose producing 50% increase of LDL removal (D50), 26 +/- 7.8, 1.3 +/- 0.48 and 15 +/- 5.25 mg for atorvastatin, simvastatin and fluvastatin, respectively. Gender, bodyweight, age, calories/day, sugar/day, lipids/day, hyperlipidaemia types and waist/hip circumference, renal and hepatic functions had no effect on the pharmacodynamic parameters. The pharmacodynamic parameters for the three statins were accurately estimated. The PK/PD model developed successfully predicted the time course of the LDL-lowering effect of statins.", 
    "190": "The pathophysiological features of nephrosclerosis may be analogous to those of atherosclerosis, which is intimately related to lipid metabolism. Thus, we examined whether a lipid-lowering agent, pravastatin, would ameliorate renal damage in hypertensive model animals. Salt-loaded Dahl salt-sensitive (S) rats were given pravastatin (2 mg/ml in drinking water) for 5 weeks. Pravastatin decreased systolic blood pressure. Although pravastatin did not influence the serum total, high-density, or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, serum triglycerides were decreased. Pravastatin decreased urinary protein excretion and ameliorated histopathological damage in salt-loaded Dahl S rats. Increased urinary excretion of 8-iso-prostagaldin F2alpha and 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine and renal superoxide overproduction and decreased reduced glutathione in the renal parenchyma were ameliorated with pravastatin in Dahl S rats fed a high salt diet. Therefore, pravastatin inhibited the progression of renal injury in salt-loaded Dahl S rats, through its antioxidant as well as its depressor effects.", 
    "191": "Angiotensin II plays a key role in the development of vascular disease. We examined the long-term effects of selective angiotensin II receptor (ATR) blockade with valsartan on arterial wall stiffness. Brachial to ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) was measured in 28 women and 25 men with hypertension (mean age: 62+/-2 years). The measurements were repeated after 24 weeks of treatment with valsartan, 40 to 160 mg/day, with (n=10) or without (n=36) concomitant statin therapy. By multiple regression analysis, baseline baPWV was correlated with age (p<0.001), systolic blood pressure (SBP, p<0.0001), body mass index (p=0.018), and pulse pressure (p=0.005), but not with total cholesterol (p=0.446). Valsartan lowered mean SBP and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) from 155+/-3 to 140+/-3 mmHg and from 90+/-2 to 82+/-2 mmHg, respectively, and mean baPWV from 1,853+/-49 to 1,682+/-52 cm/s. Lowering of baPWV was not influenced by statin therapy. An overlap analysis was performed to separate the effect of angiotensin II receptor blockade from that of blood pressure (BP) lowering. The decrease in the baPWV value of 1,794+/-46 cm/s before valsartan (n=39) vs. 1,663+/-45 cm/s during valsartan (p=0.048, n=31) at a similar mean SBP level (149+/-2 vs. 146+/-3 mmHg, p=0.304) confirmed that ATR blockade had a beneficial effect independent of BP lowering. SBP strongly influences baPWV. However, the decrease in baPWV with valsartan was independent of BP lowering. Statins had no synergistic effect on baPWV. Lowering of baPWV may account for the therapeutic benefit conferred by valsartan independent of its BP-lowering effect.", 
    "192": "Lipid-lowering drugs produce myopathic side effects in up to 7% of treated patients, with severe rhabdomyolysis occurring in as many as 0.5%. Underlying metabolic muscle diseases have not been evaluated extensively. In a cross-sectional study of 136 patients with drug-induced myopathies, we report a higher prevalence of underlying metabolic muscle diseases than expected in the general population. Control groups included 116 patients on therapy with no myopathic symptoms, 100 asymptomatic individuals from the general population never exposed to statins, and 106 patients with non-statin-induced myopathies. Of 110 patients who underwent mutation testing, 10% were heterozygous or homozygous for mutations causing three metabolic myopathies, compared to 3% testing positive among asymptomatic patients on therapy (P = 0.04). The actual number of mutant alleles found in the test group patients was increased fourfold over the control group (P < 0.0001) due to an increased presence of mutation homozygotes. The number of carriers for carnitine palmitoyltransferase II deficiency and for McArdle disease was increased 13- and 20-fold, respectively, over expected general population frequencies. Homozygotes for myoadenylate deaminase deficiency were increased 3.25-fold with no increase in carrier status. In 52% of muscle biopsies from patients, significant biochemical abnormalities were found in mitochondrial or fatty acid metabolism, with 31% having multiple defects. Variable persistent symptoms occurred in 68% of patients despite cessation of therapy. The effect of statins on energy metabolism combined with a genetic susceptibility to triggering of muscle symptoms may account for myopathic outcomes in certain high-risk groups.",
