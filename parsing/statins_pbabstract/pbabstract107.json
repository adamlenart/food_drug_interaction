The 30-day all-cause mortality was 31/478 (6.48%) among statin nonusers vs 4/274 (1.45%) for statin users (P < 0.002). As compared with nonusers, patients on statin therapy had a 5-fold reduced risk of 30-day all-cause mortality.

Atorvastatin is a hypolipidemic drug that may have a role in treatment of cancer. Moreover, atorvastatin was reported to decrease the resistance of cancer cells to many chemotherapeutic agents. The aim of this work was to study the effect of each of methotrexate (MTX) and atorvastatin alone and in combination on solid Ehrlich carcinoma (SEC) in mice. Fifty BALB/c mice were divided into five equal groups: control untreated group, SEC, SEC+MTX, SEC+atorvastatin, SEC+MTX+atorvastatin. Tumor volume, tissue glutathione reductase (GR), catalase, malondialdehyde (MDA), cholesterol and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1) were determined. A part of the tumor was examined for histopathological and immunohistochemical study. MTX or atorvastatin alone or in combination induced significant increase in tissue catalase and GR with significant decrease in tumor volume, tissue MDA, cholesterol and TNF-\u03b1 and alleviated the histopathological changes with significant increase in p53 expression and apoptotic index compared to SEC group. In conclusion, the combination of MTX and atorvastatin had a better effect than each of MTX or atorvastatin alone against solid Ehrlich tumor in mice.", 
    "64": "We have analyzed the effects of fluvastatin, an inhibitor of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase involved in mevalonate synthesis, on human NK cell-mediated anti-tumor cytolysis. Fluvastatin inhibited the activation of the small guanosin triphosphate binding protein (GTP) RhoA and the consequent actin redistribution induced by ligation of LFA1 involved in NK-tumor target cell adhesion. Also, fluvastatin reduced ganglioside M1 rafts formation triggered through the engagement of NK cell activating receptors as Fc\u03b3RIIIA (CD16), NKG2D and DNAM1. Cytolysis of tumor targets was inhibited up to 90% when NK cells were cultured with fluvastatin by affecting i) receptor-mediated increase of the intracellular free calcium concentration, ii) activation of akt1/PKB and iii) perforin and granzyme release. Fluvastatin displayed a stronger inhibiting effect on NKG2D, DNAM1, 2B4, NKp30, NKp44 and NKp46 than on CD16-mediated NK cell triggering. This was in line with the impairment of surface expression of all these receptors but not of CD16. Remarkably, fluvastatin did not affect the expression of the inhibiting receptors CD94, KIR2D and LAIR1. FasL release elicited by either NK-tumor cell interaction or CD16 or NKG2D engagement, as well as FasL-mediated killing, were not sensitive to fluvastatin. Moreover, TNF\u03b1 secretion triggered in NK cells upon incubation with tumor target cells or engagement of NKG2D receptor was not impaired in fluvastatin-treated NK cells. Likewise, antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) triggered through Fc\u03b3RIIIA engagement with the humanized monoclonal antibody rituximab or trastuzumab was only marginally affected in fluvastatin-treated NK cells. Altogether these findings suggest that interference with mevalonate synthesis impairs activation and assembly of cytoskeleton, degranulation and cytotoxic effect of perforins and granzyme but not FasL- and TNF\u03b1-mediated cytotoxicity.", 
    "65": "Employing DERA (2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate aldolase), we developed the first whole-cell biotransformation process for production of chiral lactol intermediates useful for synthesis of optically pure super-statins such as rosuvastatin and pitavastatin. Herein, we report the development of a fed-batch, high-density fermentation with Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) overexpressing the native E. coli deoC gene. High activity of this biomass allows direct utilization of the fermentation broth as a whole-cell DERA biocatalyst. We further show a highly productive bioconversion processes with this biocatalyst for conversion of 2-substituted acetaldehydes to the corresponding lactols. The process is evaluated in detail for conversion of acetyloxy-acetaldehyde with the first insight into the dynamics of reaction intermediates, side products and enzyme activity, allowing optimization of the feeding strategy of the aldehyde substrates for improved productivities, yields and purities. The resulting process for production of ((2S,4R)-4,6-dihydroxytetrahydro-2H-pyran-2-yl)methyl acetate (acetyloxymethylene-lactol) has a volumetric productivity exceeding 40 g L(-1) h(-1) (up to 50 g L(-1) h(-1)) with >80% yield and >80% chromatographic purity with titers reaching 100 g L(-1). Stereochemical selectivity of DERA allows excellent enantiomeric purities (ee >99.9%), which were demonstrated on downstream advanced intermediates. The presented process is highly cost effective and environmentally friendly. To our knowledge, this is the first asymmetric aldol condensation process achieved with whole-cell DERA catalysis and it simplifies and extends previously developed DERA-catalyzed approaches based on the isolated enzyme. Finally, applicability of the presented process is demonstrated by efficient preparation of a key lactol precursor, which fits directly into the lactone pathway to optically pure super-statins.",

The mechanisms by which non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and statins inhibit cancer cell growth and induce apoptosis are not fully understood. This study was designed to investigate lung cancer chemoprevention through a mechanism-based approach using sulindac at low doses in combination with simvastatin. We found that sulindac-induced cytotoxicity was significantly enhanced in the presence of simvastatin. The combination of sulindac and simvastatin induced more extensive caspase-dependent apoptosis in A549 cells compared to that induced with either drug alone. The combination of sulindac and simvastatin also increased the loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential (\u2206\u03a8m) and the cytosolic release of cytochrome\u00a0c. In addition, ROS generation in cells treated with both sulindac and simvastatin was markedly increased compared to cells treated with either sulindac or simvastatin alone. The enhancement of ROS generation by sulindac and simvastatin was abrogated by pretreatment with NAC, which also prevented apoptosis and mitochondrial dysfunction induced by sulindac and simvastatin.

These reduction rates were comparable between groups (P=0.61). Meanwhile, in the etidronate group, maximal vessel wall thickness of the thoracic aorta remained unchanged (2.2%; 95% confidence interval, -0.3 to 4.8). Conversely, maximal vessel wall thickness of the abdominal aorta was reduced more effectively in the combination therapy group (-11.4%) than in the atorvastatin group (-0.9%; P<0.001) and the etidronate group (5.5%; P=0.006).", 
    "114": "Atorvastatin plus etidronate combination therapy for 12 months significantly reduced both thoracic and abdominal aortic plaques, whereas atorvastatin monotherapy reduced only thoracic aortic plaques and etidronate monotherapy reduced only abdominal aortic plaques. The effectiveness of combination therapy in reducing atherosclerotic plaques in the abdominal aorta was significantly greater than for both atorvastatin and etidronate monotherapy.",

    "116": "Monacolin K is the secondary metabolite isolated from Monascus spp. It is the natural form of lovastatin, which is clinically used to reduce the synthesis of cholesterol by inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase. In the present study, monacolin K increased protein expression of SIRT1 and phosphorylation level of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in HepG2 cells. Through activation of SIRT1/AMPK pathway, monacolin K increased phosphorylation of acetyl CoA carboxylase and caused nuclear translocation of forkhead box O1. The western blotting results showed that monacolin K increased expression of adipose triglyceride lipase but decreased abundances of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1). Monacolin K also decreased the intracellular accumulation of lipids as demonstrated by Oil Red O staining. In addition, the immunostaining showed that monacolin K prevented the nuclear translocation of SREBP1, indicating the association with down-regulation of FAS. All the demonstrated effects of monacolin K were counteracted by nicotinamide or compound C, the inhibitors of SIRT1 or AMPK. In summary, monacolin K reduces the lipid content through SIRT1/AMPK pathway in HepG2 cells, which promotes catabolism and inhibits anabolism of lipid.", 
    "117": "Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a protein secreted by the hepatocyte that regulates the surface expression of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors by targeting them for lysosomal degradation. Statins enhance PCSK9 synthesis, an effect that blunts the LDL-cholesterol (-C)-lowering effectiveness of statins. Loss-of-function mutations in the PCSK9 gene produce life-long low levels of LDL-C and reduce cardiovascular risk. Monoclonal antibodies to PCSK9, which mimic the effects of genetic mutations by inhibiting PCSK9, are in clinical trial development. Two different commercial development programs have demonstrated significant success in lowering LDL-C in phase 1 and 2 trials with similar agents: REGN727/SAR236553 (REGN727) and, more recently, AMG 145. When administered subcutaneously at doses ranging from 50 to 150 mg every 2 weeks or 200 to 400 mg every 4 weeks, these agents produced similar dose-responses in LDL-C lowering. In hypercholesterolemic patients, LDL-C reductions ranged up to 60%, and, as would be expected, an even greater response was reported for statin-treated hypercholesterolemic patients-up to 70% decrease. LDL-C has typically shown a gradual increase after the nadir as monoclonal antibodies are cleared from the circulation. Results to date indicate that the PCSK9 monoclonal antibody approach appears safe, well-tolerated, and profoundly lowers LDL-C levels while also favorably altering apolipoprotein B, triglycerides, lipoprotein (a), and high-density lipoprotein-C. It is expected to meet an important clinical need for patients unable to achieve adequate LDL-C-lowering with currently available therapies.", 
    "118": "In a randomized, double-blind, crossover study of 15 aspirin-naive patients (mean age 48.8 \u00b1 10.2 years) with the metabolic syndrome, statin monotherapy (simvastatin 40 mg daily) was compared to combination therapy (simvastatin 40 mg and ezetimibe 10 mg daily) on biomarkers of inflammation and platelet activity. The addition of ezetimibe to simvastatin over a 4-week period was associated with reduced expression of CD141 (thrombomodulin; p = 0.02), platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (p < 0.0001) and CD51/61 (vitronectin receptor; p = 0.048) compared to statin monotherapy. Ezetimibe added to simvastatin improves several indices of platelet reactivity beyond statin monotherapy. However, the clinical relevance of these findings await results of the IMPROVE-IT trial (Improved Reduction of Outcomes: Vytorin Efficacy International Trial).",

All patients received supplemental hydration. Immediately after surgery, patients in the furosemide group received intravenous furosemide injection (20 mg); those in the control group received no treatment. Total fluid intake and urine output were recorded. Pre- and postsurgical changes in serum creatinine levels (SCr), glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and creatinine clearance rate (CCr) were assessed, and the incidence of CIN was also evaluated between the two groups. Logistic regression analysis was used to study risk factors for CIN.", 
    "121": "General baseline conditions were similar between the two groups. Patients who received furosemide had significantly less increase in SCr and a more marked increase in GFR and CCr than those who did not. The incidence of CIN was significantly higher in the control group. Logistic regression analysis revealed that female gender and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor were risk factors for CIN, whereas furosemide acted as a protective agent.",

    "124": "Recent large randomized clinical trials testing the hypothesis of raising HDL-C with niacin and dalcetrapib in statin-treated patients failed to improve cardiovascular outcomes. Emerging evidence suggests that many of the cardioprotective functions of HDL, such as vasodilation, angiogenesis and endothelial barrier function, protection against ischemia/reperfusion injury, and inhibition of atherosclerosis, may be attributable to its S1P cargo. HDL-associated S1P may represent a future therapeutic target.",

In CESD, the severity of the symptoms, hepatomegaly and hypercholesterolaemia, can be highly variable, presenting in childhood or adulthood. Therefore, it is likely that many patients are undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. Nevertheless, LAL deficiency has been recognized for more than 25 years, but adequate therapeutic strategies are limited.", 
    "127": "CESD has an estimated prevalence of one in 90,000 to 170,000 individuals in the general population, confirming the likelihood that this disease is currently underdiagnosed. A number of studies have shown that in LIPA deficient patients the hypercholesterolaemic phenotype can be attenuated using statin therapy, and favourable effects on reduction of lipid accumulation in lysosomes have been reported. Targeting lysosomal exocytosis with LAL replacement therapy was shown to be successful in animal models and recently a phase I/II study demonstrated its safety and its potential metabolic efficacy on transaminase levels.", 
    "128": "The hypercholesterolaemic phenotype in CESD can be difficult to distinguish from other known hypercholesterolaemic disorders. In the majority of CESD cases with hypercholesterolaemia favourable responses on statin treatment are observed, but the effect on reduction of lipid accumulation in lysosomes needs to be further evaluated. Combining statins with LAL replacement therapy may provide a promising approach for optimal treatment of LIPA deficiencies in the future.",

Two CETP inhibitors, dalcetrapib and torcetrapib, have been tested in large clinical trials in statin-treated coronary heart disease patients and have shown no clinical benefit compared to placebo. Anacetrapib and evacetrapib, two potent CETP inhibitors, are now being tested in large clinical trials. Torcetrapib has been shown to decrease the fractional catabolic rate (FCR) of HDL apolipoproteins (apo) A-I and A-II, enhance the FCR of TRL apoB-100 and apoE, and decrease TRL apoB-48 production, but has no significant effects on fecal cholesterol excretion in humans. Anacetrapib also delays the FCR of HDL apoA-I.",

The incidence and prevalence of CKD are increasing with age, and patients with CKD are a population at very high risk for developing stroke. CKD may increase the risk for incident stroke independent of conventional stroke risk factors. A common pathological process including anemia, homocysteine, nitric oxide, oxidative stress, inflammation, and conditions promoting coagulation may be related to the development of stroke in the course of CKD. CKD can also serve as a marker of brain injury, because the cerebral microvascular system has similar hemodynamic features with the vascular beds of the kidney. CKD has been linked with markers of cerebral small artery disease including white matter lesions, lacunar infarctions, and cerebral microbleeds. CKD has been implicated with neurological deterioration during hospitalization, poor functional outcome, and hemorrhagic transformation in patients with acute stroke. Recurrence of stroke may also be higher in CKD patients compared with those having normal kidney function. However, there have been no specific recommendations for antiplatelet therapy in patients with ischemic stroke plus CKD. As CKD patients have distinct characteristics including high bleeding complications and poor response to antiplatelet agents, selecting and adjusting platelet aggregation inhibitors should be individualized. In addition, it should be noted that aspirin may aggravate renal dysfunction. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors restore endothelial dysfunction and may serve as a target for preventing stroke in CKD patients. Aside from antiplatelet therapy, other treatments including lipid control, blood pressure lowering, and renal transplantation are also important. Further studies are warranted for optimal treatment in stroke prevention in CKD patients.",

Although a number of clinical drug-drug interactions associated with hepatic transport proteins have been reported, in practice it is not always straightforward to discriminate other pathways (e.g. drug metabolism) from being involved in these interactions. The present study was designed to assess the interactions between organic anion transporting polypeptide (Oatp) substrates (pravastatin or repaglinide) and inhibitors (spironolactone or diphenhydramine) in vivo in rats. The mechanisms behind the interactions were then investigated using in vitro tools (isolated hepatocytes and rat liver microsomes). The results showed a significant increase in the systemic exposures of pravastatin (2.5-fold increase in AUC) and repaglinide (1.8-fold increase in AUC) after co-administration of spironolactone to rats. Diphenhydramine increased the AUC of repaglinide by 1.4-fold. The in vivo interactions observed in rats between Oatp substrates and inhibitors may a priori be classified as transport-mediated drug-drug interactions. However, mechanistic studies performed in vitro using both isolated rat hepatocytes and rat liver microsomes showed that the interaction between pravastatin and spironolactone may be solely linked to the inhibition of pravastatin uptake in liver. On the contrary, the inhibition of cytochrome P450 seemed to be the reason for the interactions observed between repaglinide and spironolactone. Although the function and structure of transport proteins may vary between rats and humans, the approach used in the present study can be applied to humans and help to understand the role of drug transport and drug metabolism in a given drug-drug interaction. This is important to predict and mitigate the risk of drug-drug interactions for a candidate drug in pre-clinical development, it is also important for the optimal design of drug-drug interactions studies in the clinic.",

Interestingly, the proper function of Rho proteins depends on prenylation. Significantly, it has been reported that metastasis in human melanoma can be reduced by atorvastatin which inhibits RhoC activity by preventing its geranylgeranylation. Given that RhoC is a key oncogene involved in metastasis, we hypothesized Atorvastatin can reduce head and neck metastasis by inhibiting RhoC activity.",

Meta-regression analysis was performed to determine whether the effects of rosuvastatin therapy were modulated by the prespecified factors. Of 159 potentially relevant articles screened initially, 28 reports of randomized trials enrolling a total of 7802 patients were included. Pooled analysis suggested a significant reduction in final sdLDL levels among patients randomized to rosuvastatin versus atorvastatin therapy (MD, -1.56 mg/dl; 95 % CI, -2.30 to -0.83 mg/dl; P < 0.0001). The meta-regression coefficients were statistically significant for the baseline LDL/sdLDL level and the difference in LDL changes between the two groups. In conclusion, rosuvastatin rather than atorvastatin therapy is likely more effective in reduction of sdLDL levels. It should be further investigated whether the reduction in sdLDL levels implies overt clinical benefits of rosuvastatin over atorvastatin.",

The present study investigated an integrated in vivo and in vitro approach to determine the involvement of organic anion transporting polypeptides (Oatps) in the disposition of drugs in rats using rifampicin as an inhibitor. When bromosulfophthalein (BSP) and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), which were used as model substrates for Oatps, were administered intravenously (3 and 1 mg/kg, respectively) to rats pretreated with rifampicin orally (30 mg/kg), the total plasma clearance of BSP and statins was attenuated compared with that in control rats, suggesting the involvement of Oatps in the disposition of these drugs in vivo. On the other hand, the pharmacokinetics of midazolam, used as a model substrate of cytochrome P450 3a (Cyp3a), was unchanged between control rats and rifampicin-pretreated rats. The involvement of Oatps in the disposition of statins observed in vivo was further clarified by employing an in vitro hepatic uptake study and media-loss assay in the presence or absence of 100 \u03bcM rifampicin. Hepatic intrinsic clearance was reduced in the presence of rifampicin in both the media-loss assay and hepatocyte uptake study.

Cardioprotective effects of statins were suggested to be mediated at least in part through inhibition of small GTPases, particularly those of the Rho family. The present study was designed to examine whether rosuvastatin can improve electrical remodeling and contractile dysfunction in type 1 diabetic rat heart via modulation of RhoA pathway. Type 1 diabetes was induced by single dose injection of STZ (50 mg/kg). One week after injection rosuvastatin (10 mg/kg/day) and sham treatment was given for 5 weeks in the diabetic rats, as well as in control groups. Shortening and Ca\u00b2\u207a transients were recorded in myocytes loaded with Fura2-AM. Membrane currents and Ca\u00b2\u207a transients were measured synchronously via whole-cell patch clamping. In untreated diabetic rats, relaxation of shortening and decay of the matched Ca\u00b2\u207a transients were prolonged. Fractional shortening and Ca\u00b2\u207a transients were also decreased. Rosuvastatin treatment reversed those changes. I(CaL) density did not change in either group but rosuvastatin recovered the loss of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca\u00b2\u207a and Na\u207a/Ca\u00b2\u207a exchange as evidenced from amplitude and decay of caffeine-induced Ca\u00b2\u207a transients, peak INCX and calculated sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca\u00b2\u207a content. Diabetes-induced attenuation of I(to) and I(sus) was also reversed, whilst I(K1) was unchanged in diabetes and unaffected by treatment. Rosuvastatin prevented the diabetes-induced increase in RhoA expression. Plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels were higher in diabetic rats, but rosuvastatin reduced only the latter. In conclusion, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor rosuvastatin can prevent diabetes-induced electrical and functional remodeling of heart due to inhibition of RhoA signalling rather than reduction of cholesterol level.",

When SmgGDS was knocked down by its small interfering RNA in human umbilical venous endothelial cells, statins were no longer able to induce Rac1 degradation or inhibit angiotensin II-induced production of reactive oxygen species.

The cAMP/PKA pathway continues to be a promising drug target with the emergence of new PDE inhibitors and a novel PKA target protein, HSP20, which mediates smooth muscle relaxation via actin depolymerization. Smooth muscle relaxation can also be elicited by inhibitors of the RhoA/Rho kinase pathway via inhibition of myosin light chain phosphorylation and actin depolymerization.

    "225": "Rosuvastatin is one of the most potent statins available for reducing circulating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, which enables more high-risk patients to achieve their lipid goals. Its favorable balance of effects on atherogenic and protective lipoproteins and its pleiotropic effects, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects and improvement in endothelial dysfunction, are associated with slowing of progression of atherosclerosis within the artery wall and have been translated into clinical benefits for cardiovascular outcomes. This review provides an update on the safety and the efficacy of rosuvastatin in recent large clinical trials. It appears that rosuvastatin has a beneficial effect on the progression of atherosclerosis across the clinical dosage range of 2.5-40 mg. It reduced cardiovascular events in relatively low-risk subjects with elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and normal low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. As with other statins, rosuvastatin did not show overall benefit in terms of survival in patients with heart failure, but certain clinical or biochemical markers reflecting underlying disease characteristics may help to identify subgroups of patients that benefit from statin therapy. In patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing chronic hemodialysis, rosuvastatin had no effect on reducing cardiovascular events. Although there is a slightly increased risk of incident diabetes with this class of agents, the absolute benefits of statin therapy on cardiovascular events overweigh the risk in patients with moderate or high cardiovascular risk or with documented cardiovascular disease. As with other statins, rosuvastatin is an appropriate therapy in addition to antihypertensive treatment to reduce cardiovascular risk in hypertensive patients.", 
    "226": "Venous neointimal hyperplasia (VNH) is responsible for hemodialysis vascular access malfunction. Here we tested whether VNH formation occurs, in part, due to vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 gene expression causing adventitial fibroblast transdifferentiation to myofibroblasts (\u03b1-SMA-positive cells). These cells have increased proliferative and migratory capacity leading to VNH formation. Simvastatin was used to decrease VEGF-A and MMP-9 gene expression in our murine arteriovenous fistula model created by connecting the right carotid artery to the ipsilateral jugular vein. Compared to fistulae of vehicle-treated mice, the fistulae of simvastatin-treated mice had the expected decrease in VEGF-A and MMP-9 but also showed a significant reduction in MMP-2 expression with a significant decrease in VNH and a significant increase in the mean lumen vessel area. There was an increase in terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining, and decreases in \u03b1-SMA density, cell proliferation, and HIF-1\u03b1 and hypoxyprobe staining. This latter result prompted us to determine the effect of simvastatin on fibroblasts subjected to hypoxia in vitro. Simvastatin-treated fibroblasts had a significant decrease in myofibroblast production along with decreased cellular proliferation, migration, and MMP-9 activity but increased caspase 3 activity suggesting increased apoptosis. Thus, simvastatin results in a significant reduction in VNH, with increase in mean lumen vessel area by decreasing VEGF-A/MMP-9 pathway activity.",

We used in situ brain perfusion to show that rosuvastatin and taurocholate, two established Oatp1a4 substrates, decreased (5-fold) the Clup of [3H]A\u03b2 while L-thyroxine increased it (5.5-fold). We demonstrated an interaction between A\u03b2 and Oatp1a4 by co-immunoprecipitation and western blotting experiments, supporting the hypothesis that the rosuvastatin- and taurocholate-sensitive transporter was Oatp1a4. In conclusion, our results suggest that, in mice, the brain uptake of A\u03b2 is partly mediated by Oatp1a4 and that L-thyroxine may play a crucial role in the inhibition of brain A\u03b2 clearance.",

Despite this burden, currently approved treatments have demonstrated limited efficacy. To date, therapeutic strategies have principally targeted hematoma expansion and resultant mass effect. However, secondary mechanisms of brain injury are believed to be critical effectors of cell death and neurological outcome following ICH. This article reviews the pathophysiology of secondary brain injury relevant to ICH, examines pertinent experimental models, and highlights emerging therapeutic strategies. Treatment paradigms discussed include thrombin inhibitors, deferoxamine, minocycline, statins, granulocyte-colony stimulating factors, and therapeutic hypothermia. Despite promising experimental and preliminary human data, further studies are warranted prior to effective clinical translation.",

Because low-dose combination regimens can offer potential additive or synergistic effects without toxicity, GLAD combination was tested for toxicity and chemopreventive efficacy for suppression of intestinal tumorigenesis in adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)(Min/+) mice. Six-week-old wild-type and APC(Min/+) mice were fed modified American Institute of Nutrition 76A diets with or without GLAD (25 + 50 + 50 + 500 ppm) for 14 weeks. Dietary GLAD caused no signs of toxicity based on organ pathology and liver enzyme profiles. GLAD feeding strongly inhibited (80-83%, P < .0001) total intestinal tumor multiplicity and size in APC(Min/+) mice (means \u00b1 SEM tumors for control vs GLAD were 67.1 \u00b1 5.4 vs. 11.3 \u00b1 1.1 in males and 72.3 \u00b1 8.9 vs 14.5 \u00b1 2.8 in females). Mice fed GLAD had >95% fewer polyps with sizes of >2 mm compared with control mice and showed 75% and 85% inhibition of colonic tumors in males and females, respectively. Molecular analyses of polyps suggested that GLAD exerts efficacy by inhibiting cell proliferation, inducing apoptosis, decreasing \u03b2-catenin and caveolin-1 levels, increasing caspase-3 cleavage and p21, and modulating expression profile of inflammatory cytokines. These observations demonstrate that GLAD, a novel cocktail of chemopreventive agents at very low doses, suppresses intestinal tumorigenesis in APC(Min/+) mice with no toxicity. This novel strategy to prevent colorectal cancer is an important step in developing agents with high efficacy without unwanted side effects."
