Four strategies were evaluated: 1) current practice; 2) current prevention guidelines for cardiovascular disease; 3) CT screening for coronary calcium; and 4) statin therapy for all individuals. Asymptomatic individuals at intermediate risk of CHD were simulated over their remaining lifetime.

Controls were the 34 049 patients who had an eye examination, but did not undergo cataract surgery or have a diagnosis of cataract in their medical record. observation procedure: The primary source of data to assess cataract surgery, treatment with statins, and other risk factors is the electronic database of Kaiser Permanente. main outcome measure: Use of the statin class of drug.",

After adjustment for age, sex, race, smoking status, diabetes, and coronary artery disease, longer-term statin use was found to be protective against cataract extraction (OR: 0.93, P = .02), while shorter-term use was associated with cataract surgery (OR: 1.11, P < .0001). Age-stratified logistic regression analysis showed that statin use of 5 years or more was protective against cataract surgery in the younger age group (50-64 years), while shorter-term use (<5 years) was associated with an increased risk of surgery in both the younger and older age groups (60+ years).",

Numerous studies have described statin use for secondary prevention; however, few data have highlighted IST use after ACS. The objective of the present study was to describe IST use in an ACS population before hospitalization, on discharge, and during early follow-up after discharge. A retrospective chart review was conducted of randomly selected patients admitted to a tertiary care center from November 1, 2007 to October 31, 2008. Eligible patients included adults admitted to cardiology with a most responsible diagnosis of ACS (International Classification of Diseases code 20-25). The exclusion criteria included transfer to another hospital or cardiovascular surgery ward and in-hospital death. Phase 1 included an inpatient chart review. Phase 2 was a follow-up cardiologist clinic letter review that included only patients who started IST in-hospital. Of 234 charts reviewed, 111 (47%) patients met the inclusion criteria (mean age 65 \u00b1 11.7 years, 76% men). Most patients (93%) were discharged with a statin. However, although 72% of the study population were eligible for IST, only 52% had IST during hospitalization. Of the patients who started IST with clinic letters available (n = 31), 68% continued IST (mean interval to follow-up 85 days, range 33 to 208). In conclusion, although statin use is good, IST use after ACS is suboptimal. Additionally, newly initiated IST demonstrates poor persistence after discharge.",

The use of lipid-lowering therapies, particularly statins, to achieve these goals has reduced cardiovascular disease (CVD) morbidity and mortality; however, significant residual risk for events remains. This, combined with the rising prevalence of obesity, which has shifted the risk profile of the population toward patients in whom LDL-C is less predictive of CVD events (metabolic syndrome, low HDL-C, elevated triglycerides), has increased interest in the clinical use of inflammatory and lipid biomarker assessments. Furthermore, the cost effectiveness of pharmacological intervention for both the initiation of therapy and the intensification of therapy has been enhanced by the availability of a variety of generic statins. This report describes the consensus view of an expert panel convened by the National Lipid Association to evaluate the use of selected biomarkers [C-reactive protein, lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A(2), apolipoprotein B, LDL particle concentration, lipoprotein(a), and LDL and HDL subfractions] to improve risk assessment, or to adjust therapy.

    "39": "Although statins impart a number of cardiovascular benefits, whether statin therapy during the peri-infarct period improves subsequent myocardial structure and function remains unclear. Thus, we evaluated the effects of atorvastatin on cardiac function, remodeling, fibrosis, and apoptosis after myocardial infarction (MI). Two groups of rats were subjected to permanent coronary occlusion. Group II (n\u200a=\u200a14) received oral atorvastatin (10 mg/kg/d) daily for 3 wk before and 4 wk after MI, while group I (n\u200a=\u200a12) received equivalent doses of vehicle. Infarct size (Masson's trichrome-stained sections) was similar in both groups. Compared with group I, echocardiographic left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and fractional area change (FAC) were higher while LV end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) and LV end-systolic and end-diastolic diameters (LVESD and LVEDD) were lower in treated rats. Hemodynamically, atorvastatin-treated rats exhibited significantly higher dP/dt(max), end-systolic elastance (Ees), and preload recruitable stroke work (PRSW) and lower LV end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP). Morphometrically, infarct wall thickness was greater in treated rats. The improvement of LV function by atorvastatin was associated with a decrease in hydroxyproline content and in the number of apoptotic cardiomyocyte nuclei. We conclude that atorvastatin therapy during the peri-infarct period significantly improves LV function and limits adverse LV remodeling following MI independent of a reduction in infarct size. These salubrious effects may be due in part to a decrease in myocardial fibrosis and apoptosis.",

TH1 cytokines are involved as effector T cells in inflammatory response, while TH2 cytokines can be anti-inflammatory such as IL-10 and IL-4. It is well known that statins enhance the production of TH2 cytokines whereas the secretion of TH1 cytokines is suppressed. For this purpose, we studied the significance of anti-inflammatory effect and suppression of inflammation by statins.

The majority were small trials using a nonrandomized open-label design with a single HD group (no HD controls). Alpha-tocopherol was the most investigated antioxidant, with 20/25 studies reporting that this vitamin decreased oxidative stress, and one clinical outcome trial in 196 patients finding that it protected against secondary CVD. Studies using vitamin C were more equivocal, with 4/11 showing decreased oxidative stress and one clinical outcome trial showing no effect on morbidity or mortality. N-acetylcysteine was the most efficacious agent, with 4/4 studies indicating a decrease in oxidative stress and one trial (n=134) showing reduced CVD events. Seven studies have used therapy containing a combination of antioxidants, with five of these reporting decreased oxidative stress. Most intervention studies in HD patients, such as statin therapy and increased dialysis dose, have failed to show improvement in CVD outcomes.

It also has beneficial effects in mortality reduction after a myocardial infarction. Omacor is a highly potent form of Omega-3 fatty acids that lowers plasma triglycerides. In patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia who are refractory to statins, it helps augment triglyceride reduction. Omacor also increases high-density lipoprotein and decreases low-density lipoprotein levels. It is well tolerated with minimal adverse effects and no known interactions causing rhabdomyolysis. In high doses, Omacor has pronounced cardiovascular benefits with improvement of triglycerides and various lipid parameters. Omega-3 fatty acids have also been shown to have beneficial effects on arrhythmias, inflammation, and heart failure. It may also decrease platelet aggregation and induce vasodilation. Omega-3 fatty acids also reduce atherosclerotic plaque formation and stabilize plaques preventing plaque rupture leading to acute coronary syndrome. Moreover, omega-3 fatty acids may have antioxidant properties that improve endothelial function and may contribute to its antiatherosclerotic benefits.

Hypertension (HTN) is one of the known risk factors for MS. However, whether HTN is associated with sdLDL in patients without MS is not yet clear. The lipid profiles, including low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) subfractions, of 383 consecutive subjects were evaluated. The patients without MS consisted of 198 hypertensive patients (non-MS/HTN group) and 108 normotensive subjects (non-MS/non-HTN group). The peak and mean particle diameter of LDL were measured by gradient gel electrophoresis. Plasma total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), HDL cholesterol/Apo A1, LDL-C/ApoB and Apo(A1, B, CII and E) levels did not differ between the non-MS/non-HTN and non-MS/HTN groups. When analyzing LDL subfraction, the absolute amount of patterns A and B was not different between the non-MS/non-HTN and non-MS/HTN groups. Compared with the non-MS/non-HTN groups, the proportion of sdLDL was higher in the non-MS/HTN group (37.7% versus 39.9%, P=0.046), but not significant after adjustment of waist circumference, serum TG, age and statin usage. The proportion of sdLDL to total LDL was higher in hypertensive subjects, even those without MS, than in normotensive subjects. However, this difference of LDL subfraction in hypertensive patients is associated with higher waist circumference, higher serum TG, older age and more statin usage. This result suggests that HTN may contribute to atherosclerosis and endothelial dysfunction with associated risk factors that influence LDL size.", 
    "63": "Homocysteine, a non-protein amino acid, important risk factor for atherosclerosis and thrombosis, causes dysfunction of vascular endothelial cells traduced in inadequate vasodilatation mechanism, is pro-inflammatory and induces endoplasmic reticulum stress. The more reactive conformation is the homocysteine thiolactone (HcyT), product to the nonspecific action of methionyl-tRNA synthetase, which is incorporated into proteins by disulfide bonds (S-homocysteinilation) or amide bonds (N-homocysteinilation) affecting protein structure and function leading to cell toxicity, autoimmune responses and atherogenesis. The enzyme paraoxonase-1 (PON1), part of high density lipoprotein (HDL), had been studied only for its ability to hydrolyze organophosphate derivatives. But, more recently it has been attributed other important role. The enzyme activities are involving in protecting against the development of atherosclerosis, by preventing oxidation of lipoproteins and hydrolyze HcyT. There is growing evidence about the protective role of PON1 in vascular disease. Genetic factors (polymorphisms of the PON1), environmental and lifestyle influence their concentration and biological activity, but drugs used as cardioprotectives and lipid-lowering or others, such as antibiotics and steroids, are also important modulators. This review is an updated of the most prominent information on clinical and experimental studies for understanding the role of the PON-1 in the protection against development of atherosclerosis.", 
    "64": "Pravastatin is one of the first available statins on the market. The purpose of this study was to isolate and identify the quinoline-degrading microorganism from petroleum-contaminated soil that could bioconvert compactin to pravastatin. There were 10,011 microorganism colonies isolated; five strains showed a higher capability for quinoline biodegradation. These five strains were evaluated for their pravastatin bioconversion ability; Pseudonocardia sp. had the highest efficiency for conversion of compactin to pravastatin. The strain was further identified as Pseudonocardia carboxydivorans PAH4. The bioconversion rates were studied under difference incubation conditions. Pre-incubation in medium containing 0.005% compactin sodium, resulted in the compactin utilization rate of almost 100% in a 1mg/ml compactin-containing medium. The rate of conversion of pravastatin was up to 68% after 6 days of incubation. In conclusion, the results of this study suggest that P. carboxydivorans PAH4 could be considered a candidate for the production of pravastatin on an industrial scale.",

    "103": "Statins are widely used in the treatment of dyslipidemia and associated cardiovascular abnormalities including atherosclerosis, hypertension and coronary heart disease. Needless to mention, statins have cholesterol-lowering effects by means of inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase, a rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis. Besides cholesterol-lowering effects, statins possess pleiotropic anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant, anti-platelet and anti-fibrotic properties, which may additionally play imperative roles in statins-mediated cardiovascular protection. However, the precise mechanisms involved in the cardiovascular defensive potential of statins have not completely been elucidated. Intriguingly, a considerable number of studies demonstrated the potential modulatory role of statins on endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), a key enzyme involved in the regulation of cardiovascular function by generating endothelium-derived relaxing factor (often represented 'nitric oxide'). Worthy of note is that vascular generation of nitric oxide has beneficial anti-inflammatory, anti-platelet and vasodilatory actions. The upregulation of eNOS by statins is mediated through inhibition of synthesis of isoprenoids and subsequent prevention of isoprenylation of small GTPase Rho, whereas statin-induced activation of eNOS is mediated through activation of phosphotidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) signals. Additionally, statins enhance eNOS activation by abrogating caveolin-1 expression in vascular endothelium. In light of this view-point, we suggest in this review that eNOS upregulation and activation, in part, could play a fundamental role in the cardiovascular defensive potential of statins. The eNOS modulatory role of statins may have an imperative influence on the functional regulation of cardiovascular system and may offer new perspectives for the better use of statins in ameliorating cardiovascular disorders.",

    "109": "We evaluate the protective role of simvastatin-induced HO-1 in remote preconditioning against testis ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury in vivo. Simvastatin was intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected 24 h before IR injury. Testis was occluded in the right testis for 40 min and followed by 30 min of reperfusion to induce IR injury. Tin protoporphyrin (Snpp), a competitive inhibitor of hemeoxygenase, was i.p. injected 1 h before the IR injury in separate groups of rats. The rat testes were harvested 24 h later. Induction of HO-1 expression by simvastatin was significantly increased at 24 and 48 h. Rats pre-treated with simvastatin showed higher expression of HO-1 protein by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC), and presented lower caspases-3 activity by caspase-3 activity assay. TUNEL staining analysis revealed simvastatin pretreatment significantly reduced IR induced cellular apoptosis. Contrarily, the simvastatin-induced cytoprotective effect was entirely abolished by administrations of Snpp. Further, lower caspase-3 activities were also noted in simvastatin plus Snpp (SS) group than the control plus Snpp (CS) group. After IR injury, eNOS immunoreactivity was markedly increased in the germ cell and Leydig cell of testicular tissues. Pretreatment of simvastatin significantly decreased eNOS immunoreactivity in the germ cell of the tubules in the rat testes. In conclusion, we suggest HO-1 plays a protective role in IR-induced injury in the testes of rats.", 
    "110": "The pathophysiology of post-PCI restenosis involves neointimal formation that consists of three phases: thrombosis (within 24 h), recruitment (3-8 days), and proliferation, which starts on day 8 of PCI. Various factors suggested to be predictors/risks for restenosis include C-reactive protein (CRP), inflammatory mediators (cytokines and adhesion molecules), oxygen radicals, advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and their receptors (RAGE), and soluble RAGE (sRAGE). The earlier noted factors produce thrombogenesis, vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, and extracellular matrix formation. Statins have pleiotropic effects. Besides lowering serum cholesterol, they have various other biological effects including antiinflammatory, antithrombotic, CRP-lowering, antioxidant, antimitotic, and inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation. They inhibit matrix metalloproteinase and cyclooxygenase-2, lower AGEs, decrease expression of RAGE and increase levels of serum sRAGE. They also increase the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO) by increasing endothelial NO synthase expression and activity. Preprocedural statin therapy is known to reduce peri- and post-PCI myonecrosis and reduce the need for repeat revascularization. There is evidence that statin-eluting stents inhibit in-stent restenosis in animal models. It is concluded that because of the above attributes of statins, they are suitable candidates for reduction of post-PCI restenosis and post-PCI myonecrosis. The future directions for the use of statins in reduction of post-PCI restenosis and myonecrosis have been discussed.", 
    "111": "Lovastatin, a member of the statin family of drugs, is widely prescribed for treating hypercholesterolemia. The statin family of drugs, however, also shows promise for cancer treatment and prevention. Although lovastatin is known to be an inhibitor for HMG-CoA reductase, the precise mechanisms underlying the drug's antiproliferative activity remain unclearly defined. Here we utilized mass spectrometry, in conjunction with stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), to analyze the perturbation of protein expression in HL-60 cells treated with lovastatin. We were able to quantify \u223c3200 proteins with both forward and reverse SILAC labeling experiments, among which \u223c120 exhibited significant alterations in expression levels upon lovastatin treatment. Apart from confirming the expected inhibition of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, our quantitative proteomic results revealed that lovastatin perturbed the estrogen receptor signaling pathway, which was manifested by the diminished expression of estrogen receptor \u03b1, steroid receptor RNA activator 1, and other related proteins. Lovastatin also altered glutamate metabolism through down-regulation of glutamine synthetase and \u03b3-glutamylcysteine synthetase. Moreover, lovastatin treatment led to a marked down-regulation of carbonate dehydratase II (a.k.a. carbonic anhydrase II) and perturbed the protein ubiquitination pathway. Together, the results from the present study underscored several new cellular pathways perturbed by lovastatin.", 
    "112": "We employed second-harmonic generation (SHG) imaging and the zebrafish model to investigate the myopathy caused by statin in vivo with emphasis on the altered microstructures of the muscle sarcomere, the fundamental contractile element of muscles. This approach derives an advantage of SHG imaging to observe the striated skeletal muscle of living zebrafish based on signals produced mainly from the thick myosin filament of sarcomeres without employing exogenous labels, and eliminates concern about the distortion of muscle structures caused by sample preparation in conventional histological examination. The treatment with statin caused a significantly shortened sarcomere relative to an untreated control (1.73\u00b10.09 \u00b5m vs 1.91\u00b10.08 \u00b5m, P<0.05) while the morphological integrity of the muscle fibers remained largely intact. Mechanistic tests indicated that this microstructural disorder was associated with the biosynthetic pathway of cholesterol, or, specifically, with the impaired production of mevalonate by statins. This microstructural disorder exhibited a strong dependence on both the dosage and the duration of treatment, indicating a possibility to assess the severity of muscle injury according to the altered length of the sarcomeres. In contrast to a conventional assessment of muscle injury using clinical biomarkers in blood, such as creatine kinase that is released from only disrupted myocytes, the ability to determine microstructural modification of sarcomeres allows diagnosis of muscle injury before an onset of conventional clinical symptoms. In light of the increasing prevalence of the incidence of muscle injuries caused by new therapies, our work consolidates the combined use of the zebrafish and SHG imaging as an effective and sensitive means to evaluate the safety profile of new therapeutic targets in vivo.",

    "117": "Most metastatic melanomas are refractory to current available therapy, underscoring the need to identify new effective treatments. Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor of the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway, showed promise in earlier stages of clinical development, but ultimately failed to demonstrate efficacy as a single agent in the treatment of melanoma. In order to enhance the efficacy of sorafenib in the treatment of melanoma, we tested over 2,000 naturally occurring compounds and marketed drugs in the presence of sorafenib in chemoresistant human melanoma cell lines also resistant to sorafenib-induced apoptosis. Of the 9 compounds identified as sorafenib sensitizers, we prioritized the cholesterol-lowering agent fluvastatin, based on its favorable pharmacokinetics and safety profile. Our results demonstrate that fluvastatin at 1 \u03bcM, a level safely achieved through oral administration, dramatically enhances the growth-inhibitory activity of clinically achievable concentrations of sorafenib in M14 and SKM-173 melanoma cells, with a 3.2- and 3.6-fold reduction in sorafenib 50% growth inhibition (GI50), respectively. Similar effects were observed for other melanoma cell lines. Combination indices analysis revealed a synergistic relationship between the two agents. Fluvastatin enhances sorafenib-mediated apoptosis as revealed through enhanced cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase. In combination with sorafenib, fluvastatin treatment results in reduced levels of activated murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog along with enhanced levels of activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase. Sensitization to sorafenib is unique to fluvastatin, as other statins (pravastatin and simvastatin) do not enhance sorafenib-mediated growth inhibition. These promising results warrant further investigation into the clinical applicability of fluvastatin as an agent for enhancing the efficacy of sorafenib in the treatment of melanoma.", 
    "118": "The role of cholesterol in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still controversial. Some studies exploring the association between lipids and/or lipid lowering treatment and AD indicate a harmful effect of dyslipidemia and a beneficial effect of statin therapy on AD risk. The findings are supported by genetic linkage and association studies that have clearly identified several genes involved in cholesterol metabolism or transport as AD susceptibility genes, including apolipoprotein E, apolipoprotein J, and the sortilin-related receptor. Functional cell biology studies support a critical involvement of lipid raft cholesterol in the modulation of amyloid-\u03b2 protein precursor (A\u03b2PP) processing by \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretase resulting in altered amyloid-\u03b2 production. Contradictory evidence comes from epidemiological studies showing no or controversial association between dyslipidemia and AD risk. Additionally, cell biology studies suggest that there is little exchange between circulating and brain cholesterol, that increased membrane cholesterol is protective by inhibiting loss of membrane integrity through amyloid cytotoxicity, and that cellular cholesterol inhibits co-localization of BACE1 and A\u03b2PP in non-raft membrane domains, thereby increasing generation of plasmin, an amyloid-\u03b2-degrading enzyme. The aim of this review is to summarize the findings of epidemiological and cell biological studies to elucidate the role of cholesterol in AD etiology.", 
    "119": "Statins inhibit the endogenous intracellular mevalonate pathway and exposure to statins affects innate and adaptive immune responses. Different statins are currently under evaluation as (co)therapy in neuro-inflammatory diseases like multiple sclerosis. However, there are important discrepancies in the reported effects of statins on innate immune responses in different cell types. Studies to characterize such responses in clinically relevant primary cells are currently lacking. In this study, we investigated the effect of statins on Toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced responses of microglia, the resident macrophages of the central nervous system (CNS). Exposure of primary microglia from adult rhesus monkeys to different statins strongly amplified pro-inflammatory cytokine protein and mRNA levels in response to myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88-dependent TLR activation in particular. Rather than affecting nuclear facor-\u03baB activation levels, statin exposure affected stress-activated protein/Jun-amino-terminal and p38 kinase signaling pathways. Mechanistic studies using specific pathway inhibitors and rescue experiments show that statin-induced inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis, rather than inhibition of isoprenylation, was mainly responsible for the amplified TLR responses. Additionally, microglia were more sensitive to statin-mediated effects than bone marrow-derived macrophages of the same donor. This correlated to lower intrinsic microglial expression levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, the enzyme targeted by statins. Amplification of TLR-induced responses in microglia by statin exposure might contribute to the generation of a more pro-inflammatory CNS microenvironment which can be of relevance for the pathogenesis of neuroinflammatory disorders.",

Groups 3, 4, 5, and 6 exhibited polydipsia and hyperglycemia after injection with streptozotocin (60 mg/kg body weight). Insulin, but not naringin, significantly lowered fasting blood glucose levels in diabetic rats. Plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations were significantly higher in nontreated diabetic rats (group 5) compared with control (group 1), whereas total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly higher in naringin- and simvastatin-treated diabetic rats, respectively. Hepatic total cholesterol and triglycerides were significantly elevated in nontreated diabetic compared with the control, naringin-, insulin-, and simvastatin-treated diabetic rats, respectively. Hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl CoA reductase and Acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase activities were significantly elevated in nontreated diabetic compared with the control, naringin-, and simvastatin-treated diabetic rats, respectively. However, plasma low-density lipoprotein to high-density lipoprotein ratio was significantly higher in nontreated diabetic compared with the control, whereas naringin and simvastatin significantly reduced the ratio in diabetic rats.

Although steroids clearly benefit adult cardiac surgical patents, the evidence is weaker in pediatric cardiac surgery. Current large randomized trials of steroids likely will determine the future role of steroids in adult cardiac surgery. In the intensive care unit, steroid therapy is indicated in septic shock that is refractory to fluid and pressor therapy. Recent data, however, indicate that liberal steroid therapy for sepsis may have adverse outcome consequences. A 2nd concern in the intensive care unit is acute adrenal suppression secondary to bolus etomidate therapy because it may be deleterious in patients with septic shock. Possible clinical solutions include alternative induction agents, concomitant steroid therapy, and recent etomidate derivatives. Statins also reduce mortality and atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery. Furthermore, they slow the progression of rheumatic valvular stenosis, an important consideration in the developing world. Statins also may reduce delirium, stroke, and acute renal injury after cardiac surgery, but further randomized trials are required before definitive recommendations can be formulated. Statins are essential in vascular surgery because they reduce mortality, myocardial ischemia, and acute renal injury.

Epidemiological data presently available do not, however, provide convincing evidence that reduced CETP levels or activity due to genetic factors and associated with HDL-C elevations, reduce cardiovascular risk. Indeed, the opposite may be true in some instances. All the three CETP inhibitors were the object of experimental and clinical evaluation. Large clinical trials with torcetrapib led to very negative findings, that is, raised cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in addition to raised risk of cancer and sepsis. Off-target effects of the drug, such as aldosterone retention and raised blood pressure, were believed to provide an explanation for these negative findings. The two newer agents, dalcetrapib and anacetrapib, do not exert off-target effects. The two drugs differ because anacetrapib has a more dramatic effect on HDL cholesterolemia (+139%) versus more moderate effects of dalcetrapib (+20-30%). Anacetrapib, however, may impair formation of pre-\u03b2 HDL, that is, the primary particles in the process of cholesterol removal. The initial large trial with anacetrapib (DEFINE study) in coronary patients on statin treatment, appeared to confirm a remarkable HDL raising property, together with some reduction in vascular end points, in particular coronary procedures. The issue of other potentially harmful effects of CETP inhibition (sepsis and others) has yet to be clarified. Large clinical end-point trials, however, will be necessary to provide convincing evidence that, in addition to raising HDL-C, CETP inhibitors provide a valid additional treatment, for example, to statins in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) or at high risk of CHD.",

After 8 weeks of treatment atherosclerotic plaque areas in the aortic arch and plasma lipid concentrations were determined. Vasoconstriction and relaxation of the proximal part of aorta were investigated in vitro. Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) was visualized using immunoblotting. As opposed to WT and fluvastatin- and vehicle-treated mice, OA-fed ApoE(-/-) mice gained no weight during the treatment period. Plasma concentrations of total-cholesterol and triglyceride were not significantly reduced by OA- or fluvastatin treatment. Plaque area of vehicle-treated mice was 25%, but only 14% in OA- and 19% in fluvastatin-treated mice. As compared to WT, vasoconstriction to phenylephrine was attenuated in ApoE(-/-) mice. The NOS inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) enhanced phenylephrine constriction, but significantly more so in vehicle- and fluvastatin-treated than in OA-treated and WT mice. Relaxation to acetylcholine was only slightly attenuated in ApoE(-/-) mice and not affected by OA or fluvastatin treatment. ADMA abolished acetylcholine relaxation almost completely. In ApoE(-/-) mice iNOS expression was reduced by OA treatment. In conclusion OA exerts potent antiatherogenic effects independent of plasma lipid levels and without major changes in eNOS-mediated acetylcholine relaxation.

Recently simvastatin has been found to result in the synergistic induction of apoptosis with 7-hydroxystaurosporine (UCN-01) (a Chk1 inhibitor) in myeloma cells. Therefore we hypothesized that Chk1 plays a role in the anti-myeloma effect of simvastatin. Interestingly, we found that simvastatin caused a dose-dependent increase in S phase cell cycle and induced significant apoptosis. The results of western blot showed that simvastatin-induced S-phase cell cycle arrest was associated with activation of Chk1, downregulation of Cdc25A, cyclin A and CDK2 expression. Additionally, simvastatin-induced apoptosis was accompanied by diminished Bcl-2 protein expression, increased cytosolic cytochrome c level, and activation of caspase 9 and caspase 3. Further investigation revealed that silence of Chk1 expression by Chk1 specific siRNA inhibited simvastatin-induced activation of Chk1, downregulation of Cdc25A, cyclin A and CDK2 expression, and diminished S phase cell cycle arrest. Additionally, inhibition of Chk1 expression enhanced simvastatin-induced downregulation of Bcl-2, caspase 9 cleavage and subsequent apoptosis. These results suggested that the Chk1-Cdc25A-cyclin A/CDk2 pathway was involved in simvastatin-induced S-phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in multiple myeloma cell lines.",

Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated by using multiple logistic regression. We examined 297 female lung cancer cases and 1188 controls. The unadjusted odds ratios (ORs) for any statin prescription were 0.78 (95% confidence interval=0.57-1.07) and the adjusted OR was 0.82 (95% CI=0.58-1.15). Compared with no use of statins, the adjusted ORs were 0.83 (95% CI=0.54-1.28) for the group having been prescribed statins with cumulative defined daily dose (DDDs) below 92.41 and 0.79 (95% CI=0.50-1.25) for the group with cumulative statin use of 92.41 DDDs or more.

    "167": "This study is to evaluate the effects of Simvastatin on left ventricular hypertrophy and left ventricular function in patients with essential hypertension. Untreated or noncompliance with drug treatment patients with simple essential hypertension were treated with a therapy on the basis of using Telmisartan to decrease blood pressure (BP). There were 237 patients who had essential hypertension combined with left ventricular hypertrophy as diagnosed by echocardiography, taken after their BPs were decreased to meet the values of the standard normal. Among them, there were only 41 out of the original 237 patients, 17.3%, who had simple essential hypertension combined with left ventricular hypertrophy without any other co-existing disease. They were the patients selected for this study. All patients were randomly, indiscriminately divided into two groups: one was the control group (Group T), treated with the Telmisartan-based monotherapy; the other was the target group (Group TS), treated with the Telmisartan-based plus simvastatin therapy. The changes of left ventricular hypertrophy and left ventricular function were rediagnosed by echocardiography after 1 year. The results we obtained from this study were as follows: (i) The average BPs at the beginning of the study, of simple essential hypertension combined with left ventricular hypertrophy, were high levels (systolic blood pressure (SBP) 189.21 \u00b1 19.91 mm Hg, diastolic blood pressure 101.40 \u00b1 16.92 mm Hg). (ii) The Telmisartan-based plus simvastatin therapy was significantly effective in lowering the SBP (128.26 \u00b1 9.33 mm Hg vs. 139.22 \u00b1 16.34 mm Hg). (iii) After the 1-year treatment, the parameters of left ventricular hypertrophy in both groups were improved. Compared to group T, there were no differences in the characteristics of the subjects, including interventricular septum, left ventricular mass, left ventricular mass index, ejection fraction, left atrium inner diameter at baseline. The patients' interventricular septum (Group TS 10.30 \u00b1 1.80 mm vs. Group T 10.99 \u00b1 1.68 mm, P < .05), LVM (Group TS 177.43 \u00b1 65.40 g vs. Group T 181.28 \u00b1 65.09 g, P < .05), and LVMI (Group TS 100.97 \u00b1 37.33 g/m(2) vs. Group T 106.54 \u00b1 27.95 g/m(2), P < .05), all dropped more prominently (P < .05) in group TS; the ejection fraction rose more remarkably in group TS (Group TS: 57.50 \u00b1 16.41% to 65.43 \u00b1 11.60%, P < .01 while showing no change in Group T); the left ventricular hypertrophy reversed more significantly and the left ventricular systolic function improved more. (iv) The left atrium inner diameter of Group TS decreased (P < .01), the ratio of E/A, which indicates the left ventricular diastolic function, continued to drop further, showing no change to the trend of left ventricular diastolic function declination. Patients who have hypertension with left ventricular hypertrophy usually suffer other accompanying diseases at the same time. Telmisartan-based plus Simvastatin treatment can significantly reduce SBP, reverse left ventricular hypertrophy, improve the left ventricular systolic function, but it has no effect on reversing the left ventricular diastolic function. This experiment indicated that Simvastatin can reverse left ventricular hypertrophy and improve left systolic function.",

Statins, inhibitors of HMG CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase, reduce the expression of inflammatory proteins in addition to their lipid-lowering action. However, the effect and detailed anti-inflammation mechanisms of statins in macrophages induced by oxLDL remain unclearly. In the present study, we investigated the effect of atorvastatin on inflammatory response upon oxLDL stimulation in murine macrophages and analyzed the underlying mechanisms. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)\u03b1 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) mRNA levels were assayed by real-time PCR. The expression of cyclooxygenases-2 (COX-2) was detected by real-time PCR and Western blotting. While mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation and I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation were determined by Western blotting. Our results showed that exposure of RAW264.7 cells to oxLDL, substantially changed the morphology of the cells and increased TNF\u03b1 and MCP-1 secretion. While pretreatment with atorvastatin resulted in a significant inhibition of oxLDL-induced morphological alteration and inflammatory cytokines expression in a dose-dependent fashion. Further investigation of the molecular mechanism revealed that oxLDL upregulated the transcription and protein expression of COX-2 in a time-dependent manner. Whereas, pretreatment with atorvastatin suppressed COX-2 expression, MAPK activation and I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation. Thus, we conclude that the anti-inflammatory effect of atorvastatin is mediated through the inhibition of proinflammatory COX-2. Furthermore, suppression of ERK phosphorylation and I\u03baB\u03b1 degradation is involved in this regulation. Our findings provide a novel evidence that statins suppress inflammatory response, exert its anti-atherogenic actions via against inflammation beyond cholesterol-lowing effect.",

Statins, which are used clinically for reducing cholesterol levels, can also exert beneficial vascular actions. Thus, we examined the protective effects of statins on NVU disturbances in a mouse AD model. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic (Tg) mice were used as a model of AD. Atorvastatin (30 mg/kg/day, p.o.) or pitavastatin (3 mg/kg/day, p.o.) were administered from 5 to 20 months of age. Changes in the NVU, including the endothelium and basement membrane, as well as astrogliosis and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) activation, were assessed. There was a reduction in immunopositive staining for N-acetyl glucosamine oligomer (NAGO) in the endothelium and in collagen IV in the APP vehicle (APP/Ve) group, with collagen IV staining most weakest near senile plaques (SPs). There was also an increase in intensity and number of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive astrocytes, particularly around the SP, where MMP-9 was more strongly labeled. Double immunofluorescent analysis showed that astrocytic endfeet had detached from the capillary endothelium in the APP/Ve group. Treatment with atorvastatin or pitavastatin ameliorated the activation of MMP-9. Overall, these data suggest that statins may have therapeutic potential for AD by protecting NVU.",

A strategy of reducing virulence and virulence factors of Candida spp. is an attractive approach for the treatment of serious infections caused by these yeasts. Recently, farnesol has been reported to be a quorum-sensing autoinducer, as well as a virulence factor of C. albicans. In the present study, we examined the effects of pravastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor on the in vitro production of farnesol. In addition, the synergistic effects of pravastatin with fluconazole (FLC) were examined in a mouse model of systemic infections. In vitro experiments demonstrated that pravastatin had synergistic activity with FLC as judged by fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) and suppression of farnesol production at sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations. Furthermore, significant improvement of survival in systemic infection models was shown with pravastatin supplementation. The survival benefits of pravastatin were correlated with reductions of fungal burden. These data suggest the potential of pravastatin as a supportive therapy against C. albicans infections. Synergistic antifungal activity and suppression of HMG-CoA reductase-associated Candida virulence factors, including farnesol, may explain, at least in part, the in vivo efficacy of pravastatin.",

It is important to reassure patients with clinically significant coronary artery disease, both symptomatic and asymptomatic, that for most lifestyle modification and optimal medical therapy will prove sufficient treatment. However, a minority of patients may also require intervention by stents or surgery. It is vital that patients with obvious precipitating factors that may promote or aggravate underlying coronary artery disease address these with lifestyle changes. Smoking should be stopped and a balanced diet and regular exercise encouraged. Advice should be given on factors that aggravate angina e.g. cold weather, heavy exercise and emotional stress. Advice about physical exertion and sexual activity should be included. A short-acting nitrate for angina prevention and treatment of episodes of angina is recommended. It should be used prophylactically in advance of any exertion. In terms of secondary prevention, basic therapy includes aspirin and a statin and antihypertensive agents for those with higher blood pressure. Optimal drug therapy consists of two anti-anginal drugs, such as a beta-blocker or calcium channel blocker as first-line treatment and in preference to other drug therapy unless there are side-effects or contraindications to these. Prognosis of coronary artery disease is strongly linked to the volume of underlying myocardial ischaemia and this cannot be determined simply by the level of symptoms. This should be explained to patients who should be offered further investigation if they wish and should certainly be encouraged in younger patients. Patients who have positive exercise tests require further investigation, usually by angiography. Unless a significant volume of myocardium (>10%) is at risk from ischaemia, there may be no prognostic benefit from revascularisation. However, even in patients in whom there is no significant burden of ischaemia, revascularisation can be justified if the patient remains highly symptomatic despite optimal medical therapy or is intolerant of maximal medical therapy.",

    "194": "Nutritional insufficiency during pregnancy has been shown to alter the metabolism of the offspring and can increase the risk of type 2 diabetes. The phenotype in the offspring involves changes to the morphology and functional capacity of the endocrine pancreas, and in the supporting islet microvasculature. Pancreatic \u03b2-cells possess a plastic potential and can partially recover from catastrophic loss. This is partly due to the existence of progenitors within the islets and the ability to generate new islets by neogenesis from the pancreatic ducts. This regenerative capacity is induced by bone marrow-derived stem cells, including endothelial cell progenitors and is associated with increased angiogenesis within the islets. Nutritional insults in early life, such as feeding a low protein diet to the mother, impair the regenerative capacity of the \u03b2-cells. The mechanisms underlying this include a reduced ability of \u03b2-cells to differentiate from the progenitor population, changes in the inductive signals from the microvasculature and an altered presence of endothelial progenitors. Statin treatment within animal models was associated with angiogenesis in the islet microvasculature, improved vascular function and an increase in \u03b2-cell mass. This demonstrates that reversal of the impaired \u03b2-cell phenotype observed following nutritional insult in early life is potentially possible.",

Prospective, two-phase, randomized-sequence, open-label pharmacokinetic study. Setting. Clinical research center at a teaching hospital. Subjects. Twenty-three healthy volunteers who were screened for genotype: 10 subjects carried the CYP3A5*1 allele (expressors) and 13 subjects did not (nonexpressors). Intervention. In one phase, subjects received a single oral dose of atorvastatin 20 mg. In the other phase, subjects received clarithromycin 500 mg twice/day for 5 days; on day 4 after the morning dose, subjects also received a single oral dose of atorvastatin 20 mg. All subjects participated in both phases of the study, which were separated by at least 14 days. Measurements and Main Results. Pharmacokinetic parameters of both forms of atorvastatin-atorvastatin acid and atorvastatin lactone-were compared between CYP3A5 expressors and nonexpressors, both in the absence and presence of clarithromycin, a strong CYP3A inhibitor. The acid form is pharmacologically active, and the lactone form has been associated with the atorvastatin's muscle-related adverse effects. Atorvastatin acid exposure did not differ significantly between CYP3A5 genotype groups. When subjects had not received clarithromycin pretreatment, the area under the concentration-time curve from time zero extrapolated to infinity (AUC(0-\u221e)) of atorvastatin lactone was 36% higher in nonexpressors than in expressors (median 47.6 ng\u2022hr/ml [interquartile range (IQR) 37.8-64.3 ng\u2022hr/ml] vs 34.9 ng\u2022hr/ml [IQR 21.6-42.2 ng\u2022hr/ml], p=0.038).

    "211": "Data were collected on patient demographics, home addresses, and adherence to four classes of drugs - statins, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, \u03b2-blockers, and aspirin - at 6-12 months after discharge for the ACS index event. A GIS program was used to map patient addresses and adherence data to geographic coordinates. Hot Spot Analysis was used to determine the existence of any spatial clustering patterns in adherence rates. The analysis was performed at the census tract level by using the percentage of nonadherent patients within a census tract to represent adherence for the people living within that tract, standardized by the number of residents in a census tract aged 40 years or older. Hot Spot Analysis identified unique geographic areas of high, neutral, and low adherence in the southeast area. Highly adherent census tracts were primarily located in and around the city where the university hospital and clinics are located. Areas of low adherence were located to the west, southwest, and southeast of the city. All other census tracts were considered neutral in adherence rates.", 
    "212": "Mapping geographic areas of drug adherence is feasible with use of GIS technology, with spatial mapping able to detect areas of varying levels of adherence. Future research should examine local-level factors associated with low adherence, which can be used to derive tailored, locally relevant interventions to improve long-term drug adherence.", 
    "213": "In this study, we examined the effect of chronic administration of simvastatin immediately after status epilepticus (SE) on rat brain with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). First, we evaluated cytokines expression at 3 days post KA-lesion in hippocampus and found that simvastatin-treatment suppressed lesion-induced expression of interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). Further, we quantified reactive astrocytosis using glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) staining and neuron loss using Nissl staining in hippocampus at 4-6 months after KA-lesion. We found that simvastatin suppressed reactive astrocytosis demonstrated by a significant decrease in GFAP-positive cells, and attenuated loss of pyramidal neurons in CA3 and interneurons in dentate hilar (DH). We next assessed aberrant mossy fiber sprouting (MFS) that is known to contribute to recurrence of spontaneous seizure in epileptic brain. In contrast to the robust MFS observed in saline-treated animals, the extent of MFS was restrained by simvastatin in epileptic rats. Attenuated MFS was related to decreased neuronal loss in CA3 and DH, which is possibly a mechanism underlying decreased hippocampal susceptibility in animal treated with simvastatin. Electronic encephalography (EEG) was recorded during 4 to 6 months after KA-lesion. The frequency of abnormal spikes in rats with simvastatin-treatment decreased significantly compared to the saline group. In summary, simvastatin treatment suppressed cytokines expression and reactive astrocytosis and decreased the frequency of discharges of epileptic brain, which might be due to the inhibition of MFS in DH. Our study suggests that simvastatin administration might be a possible intervention and promising strategy for preventing SE exacerbating to chronic epilepsy.", 
    "214": "Statins are generally well tolerated and effective at reducing a patient's risk of both primary and secondary cardiovascular events. Many patients who would benefit from statin therapy either do not adhere to or stop taking their statin medication within the first year. We developed an audio booklet targeted to low health literacy patients to teach them about the benefits and risks of statins to help the patients adhere to their statin therapy.", 
    "215": "Through focus groups and an iterative design, an audio booklet was developed for both English-speaking and Spanish-speaking patients. We then compared the booklet with standard of care in 132 patients from our target patient population to measure its impact on knowledge and understanding of statins.", 
    "216": "The patients enjoyed the audio booklet and showed significant increases in knowledge after listening to it when compared with those who received the standard of care materials.", 
    "217": "The audio booklet shows promise as a tool that can be used effectively in clinical practice to teach patients about statin therapy.", 
    "218": "Statin therapy after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has been associated with reduced major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). However, it has been less clear as to whether statin therapy before acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is beneficial. We studied the effect of previous statin therapy, initiated \u22651 month before PCI, on the outcome of patients with ACS who had undergone early invasive strategies.", 
    "219": "We stratified 479 consecutive patients with ACS who had undergone PCI, according to preprocedural statin administration as follows: previous statin-treated patients (statin group, n=237) and statin-naive patients (control group, n=242). The incidence of periprocedural myocardial infarction (MI) and in-hospital MACE was assessed.", 
    "220": "The incidence of Braunwald class III angina and MI presentation were significantly lower in the statin group than in the control group. Angiographic and procedural characteristics were similar between the two groups; however, slow/no reflow phenomenon occurred more frequently in the control group. After PCI, the incidence of periprocedural MI was higher in the control group than in the statin group (6.6% vs. 2.1%, p=0.016). Multivariate analysis revealed that no prior use of statin {odds ratio (OR)=2.8; 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.1-7.2; p=0.038), procedural complication (OR=4.0; 95% CI=1.5-10.5; p=0.004), stent overlap (OR=4.7; 95% CI=1.3-16.4; p=0.015), and old age (OR=3.2; 95% CI=1.2-8.0; p=0.016) were independent predictors for in-hospital MACE.", 
    "221": "Previous statin therapy before ACS was associated with milder clinical presentation and lower incidence of in-hospital MACE after early invasive strategies. The beneficial outcome is attributable to a significant reduction in periprocedural MI after PCI."
