Subsequently occurring regulatory processes can induce an aberrant stimulation of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT1) as well as changes in histone deacetylases (HDACs) and microRNAs in many cancer cell lines. Inhibitors of the mevalonate pathway are increasingly recognized as anticancer drugs. Extensive evidence indicates an intense cross-talk between signaling pathways, which affect growth, differentiation, and apoptosis either directly or indirectly via epigenetic mechanisms. Herein, we show data obtained by novel transcriptomic and corresponding methylomic or proteomic analyses from cell lines treated with pharmacologic doses of respective inhibitors (i.e., simvastatin, ibandronate). Metabolic pathways and their epigenetic consequences appear to be affected by a changed concentration of NADPH. Moreover, since the mevalonate metabolism is part of a signaling network, including vitamin D metabolism or fatty acid synthesis, the epigenetic activity of associated pathways is also presented. This emphasizes the far-reaching epigenetic impact of metabolic therapies on cancer cells and provides some explanation for clinical observations, which indicate the anticancer activity of statins and bisphosphonates.", 
    "1": "Trypanosoma cruzi is the causal agent of Chagas Disease that is endemic in Latin American, afflicting more than ten million people approximately. This disease has two phases, acute and chronic. The acute phase is often asymptomatic, but with time it progresses to the chronic phase, affecting the heart and gastrointestinal tract and can be lethal. Chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy involves an inflammatory vasculopathy. Endothelial activation during Chagas disease entails the expression of cell adhesion molecules such as E-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) through a mechanism involving NF-\u03baB activation. Currently, specific trypanocidal therapy remains on benznidazole, although new triazole derivatives are promising. A novel strategy is proposed that aims at some pathophysiological processes to facilitate current antiparasitic therapy, decreasing treatment length or doses and slowing disease progress. Simvastatin has anti-inflammatory actions, including improvement of endothelial function, by inducing a novel pro-resolving lipid, the 5-lypoxygenase derivative 15-epi-lipoxin A4 (15-epi-LXA4), which belongs to aspirin-triggered lipoxins. Herein, we propose modifying endothelial activation with simvastatin or benznidazole and evaluate the pathways involved, including induction of 15-epi-LXA4. The effect of 5 \u03bcM simvastatin or 20 \u03bcM benznidazole upon endothelial activation was assessed in EA.hy926 or HUVEC cells, by E-selectin, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression. 15-epi-LXA4 production and the relationship of both drugs with the NF\u03baB pathway, as measured by IKK-IKB phosphorylation and nuclear migration of p65 protein was also assayed. Both drugs were administered to cell cultures 16 hours before the infection with T. cruzi parasites. Indeed, 5 \u03bcM simvastatin as well as 20 \u03bcM benznidazole prevented the increase in E-selectin, ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 expression in T. cruzi-infected endothelial cells by decreasing the NF-\u03baB pathway. In conclusion, Simvastatin and benznidazole prevent endothelial activation induced by T. cruzi infection, and the effect of simvastatin is mediated by the inhibition of the NF\u03baB pathway by inducing 15-epi-LXA4 production.",

The replacement dose of daily levothyroxine is usually calculated at 1.6 mcg/kg body weight per day. We report a 77-year-old man who required supraphysiologic thyroxine replacement (>2.7 mcg/ kg/day) to treat his hypothyroidism. The patient was referred for persistent thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) elevation (40 mcIU/ml) while on 175 mcg of levothyroxine. Patient was compliant with medication. Medical history included diabetes mellitus type 2, cerebrovascular accident, depression, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency, Addison\u2019s disease, as well as a colostomy secondary to diverticulitis. He was taking aspirin, carvedilol, cholecalciferol, finasteride, fluoxetine, furosemide, ketoconazole, levothyroxine, prednisone, and albuterol/ipratropium inhaler. His height was 180.3 cm; weight, 107 kg. Thyroid was impalpable, and he was clinically euthyroid. Despite discontinuation of iron and statin which are known to interfere with thyroxine absorption and crushing of thyroxine tablets to enhance absorption, his TSH remained elevated. Celiac disease and Helicobacter pylori infection were ruled out with serological testing. There was no proteinuria and anti-parietal cell antibody was positive. Gastroparesis was confirmed by gastric emptying study. He continued to require increasing doses of thyroxine with increment to 300 mcg daily. To our knowledge, this is the first documented association between gastroparesis and thyroxine malabsorption. We recommend that gastroparesis be considered in any patient with persistent TSH elevation despite usual thyroxine doses.", 
    "8": "Statins inhibit the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, which is involved in the production of mevalonic acid in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. This pathway also results in the production of other bioactive molecules including coenzyme Q10 (also known as ubiquinone or ubidecarenone). Coenzyme Q10 is a naturally-occurring coenzyme with antioxidant effects that is involved in electron transport in mitochondria and is thought to play a role in energy transfer in skeletal muscle. Muscle-related problems are a frequently reported adverse effect of statins, and it has been hypothesised that a reduced endogenous coenzyme Q10 concentration is a cause of statin-induced myopathy. Coenzyme Q10 supplementation has therefore been proposed to reduce the adverse muscular effects sometimes seen with statins. Here, we consider whether coenzyme Q10 has a place in the management of statin-induced myopathy.",

Early and non-invasive detection of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques (VP) would be significant in preventing some aspects of these syndromes. As a new contrast agent, dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) modified ultra-small super paramagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) was synthesized and used to identify VP and rupture plaque by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).",

Adenovirus-carrying p53 genes were injected into the aortic segments rich in plaques after 8 weeks. Group C was treated with atorvastatin for 8 weeks. Sixteen weeks later, all rabbits underwent pharmacological triggering, and imaging were taken daily for 5 d after DMSA-USPIO infusion. At the first day and before being killed, serum MMP-9, sCD40L, and other lipid indicators were measured.",

The purpose of our study was to assess the association of a spectrum of CVD related genes and combined state of hypertension hypercholesterolemia (HH) in unrelated Lebanese. Twelve polymorphisms were studied by multiplex PCR and reverse hybridization of DNA from 171 healthy individuals and 144 HH subjects. Two genes were significantly associated with HH: ACE (OR: 9.20, P<0.0001) and PAI-1 (OR: 2.29, P = 0.007), respectively with the occurrence of the risky alleles \"Del\" and \"4G\". The frequencies of the Del and 4G alleles were found to be 0.98 and 0.90 in the HH group versus 0.84 and 0.79 in the healthy group, respectively. Serum ACE activity and PAI-I increased significantly with Del/Del and 4G/5G genotypes. The co-expression of Del/4G(+/+) was detected in 113 out of 171 (66.0%) controls and 125 out of 144 (86.8%) HH subjects. Del/4G(-/-) was detected in only 6 (3.5%) controls and undetected in the HH group. Three venous thrombosis related genes [FV(Leiden), MTHFR(A1298C) and FXIII(V34L)] were significantly related to the prominence of the co-expression of Del/4G(+/+). A range of 2 to 8 combined polymorphisms co-expressed per subject where 5 mutations were the most detected. In Del/4G(+/+) subjects, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) produced significant elevated levels of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 contrary to IL-10, and no variations occurred for IL-4. ACE inhibitor (ramipril) in combination with statin (atorvastatin) and not alone reversed significantly the situation. This first report from Lebanon sheds light on an additional genetic predisposition of a complex spectrum of genes involved in CVD and suggests that the most requested gene FVL by physicians may not be sufficient to diagnose eventual future problems that can occur in the cardiovascular system. Subjects expressing the double mutations (Del/4G) are at high risk for the onset of CVDs.",

Thus, patients affected by the combination of FH and acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) are not exceptional and neurologists should be prepared to encounter them. Despite a recent finding of beneficial association between statin use during hospitalization and improved outcomes, the increased risk of recurrent ICH in the long term may make clinicians avoid statins in patients with a history of ICH. However, discontinuing statins in patients with FH worsens cardiovascular outcomes and even increases all-cause mortality.

Therefore the aim of the meta-analysis was to assess the effect of statins on circulating ADMA levels. We searched selected databases (up to August 2014) to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigate the effect of statins on plasma ADMA concentrations. A weighted meta-regression (WMD) using unrestricted maximum likelihood model was performed to assess the impact of statin dose, duration of statin therapy and baseline ADMA concentrations as potential variables on the WMD between statin and placebo group. In total, 1134 participants in 9 selected RCTs were randomized; 568 were allocated to statin treatment and 566 were controls.

We evaluated 167 patients without diabetes 8-10 weeks after kidney transplantation, performing oral glucose tolerance tests and measuring VAT content from dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scans. Median VAT weight in normal glucose tolerance patients was 0.9 kg, impaired fasting glucose patients 1.0 kg, impaired glucose tolerance patients 1.3 kg and patients with post-transplant diabetes (PTDM) 2.1 kg (P = 0.004, indicating a difference between groups). Percentage VAT of total body fat was associated with fasting (R(2) = 0.094, P < 0.001) and 2-h glucose concentration (R(2) = 0.062, P = 0.001), while BMI was only associated with 2-h glucose concentration (R(2) = 0.029, P = 0.028).

    "35": "Systemic treatment with statins mitigates allergic airway inflammation, TH2 cytokine production, epithelial mucus production, and airway hyperreactivity (AHR) in murine models of asthma. We hypothesized that pravastatin delivered intratracheally would be quantifiable in lung tissues using mass spectrometry, achieve high drug concentrations in the lung with minimal systemic absorption, and mitigate airway inflammation and structural changes induced by ovalbumin. Male BALB/c mice were sensitized to ovalbumin (OVA) over 4\u00a0weeks, then exposed to 1% OVA aerosol or filtered air (FA) over 2\u00a0weeks. Mice received intratracheal instillations of pravastatin before and after each OVA exposure (30\u00a0mg/kg). Ultra performance liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry was used to quantify plasma, lung, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) pravastatin concentration. Pravastatin was quantifiable in mouse plasma, lung tissue, and BALF (BALF\u00a0>\u00a0lung\u00a0>\u00a0plasma for OVA and FA groups). At these concentrations pravastatin inhibited airway goblet cell hyperplasia/metaplasia, and reduced BALF levels of cytokines TNF\u03b1 and KC, but did not reduce BALF total leukocyte or eosinophil cell counts. While pravastatin did not mitigate AHR, it did inhibit airway hypersensitivity (AHS). In this proof-of-principle study, using novel mass spectrometry methods we show that pravastatin is quantifiable in tissues, achieves high levels in mouse lungs with minimal systemic absorption, and mitigates some pathological features of allergic asthma. Inhaled pravastatin may be beneficial for the treatment of asthma by having direct airway effects independent of a potent anti-inflammatory effect. Statins with greater lipophilicity may achieve better anti-inflammatory effects warranting further research.",

This study assessed the effect of controlled simvastatin (SIM) release from a thermo-sensitive hydrogel in vitro and in vivo. We successfully manufactured and evaluated thermo-sensitive poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide)-poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) triblock copolymers (PLGA-PEG-PLGA) loaded with SIM. The osteogenic effect of this hydrogel was tested in vitro and in vivo. MC-3T3 E1 cells proliferation and osteoblastic differentiation was analyzed after cultivation with the hydrogel extracts. Cells co-cultured with SIM/PLGA-PEG-PLGA extracts showed an increase in mineralization and osteogenic gene expression compared to the other two groups. Additionally, the characteristics of this composite in vivo were demonstrated using a rat bone defect model. The bone defects injected with SIM/PLGA-PEG-PLGA hydrogel showed increased new bone formation compared to samples treated with PLGA-PEG-PLGA and control samples. The results of this study suggest that SIM/PLGA-PEG-PLGA might provide potential therapeutic value for bone healing.", 
    "37": "A low plasma level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (HDL-C) is a major risk factor for the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). However, several observations have highlighted the shortcomings of using cholesterol content as the sole reflection of HDL metabolism. In particular, several large randomized controlled trials of extended release niacin and cholesteryl-ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors on background statin therapy have failed to show improvement in ASCVD outcomes despite significant increases in HDL-C. Reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) is the principal HDL function that impacts macrophage foam cell formation and other functions such as endothelial activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, monocyte adhesion, and platelet aggregation. Cholesterol efflux from macrophages to plasma/serum reflects the first critical step of RCT and is considered a key anti-atherosclerotic function of HDL. Whether this function is operative in humans remains to be seen, but recent studies assessing cholesterol efflux in humans suggest that the cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC) of human plasma or serum is a potent marker of ASCVD risk. This review describes the methodology of measuring CEC ex vivo from human samples and the findings to date linking CEC to human disease. Studies to date confirm that CEC can be reliably measured using stored human blood samples as cholesterol acceptors and suggest that CEC may be a promising new biomarker for atherosclerotic and metabolic diseases. Further studies are needed to standardize measurements and clarify the role CEC may play in predicting risk of developing disease and response to therapies.",

Loss of corresponding CCM proteins increases RhoA kinase-mediated endothelial permeability in vitro, and in mouse brains in vivo. A prospective case-controlled observational study investigated whether the brains of human subjects with familial CCM show vascular hyperpermeability by dynamic contrast-enhanced quantitative perfusion magnetic resonance imaging, in comparison with CCM cases without familial disease, and whether lesional or brain vascular permeability correlates with CCM disease activity. Permeability in white matter far (WMF) from lesions was significantly greater in familial than in sporadic cases, but was similar in CCM lesions. Permeability in WMF increased with age in sporadic patients, but not in familial cases. Patients with more aggressive familial CCM disease had greater WMF permeability compared to those with milder disease phenotype, but similar lesion permeability. Subjects receiving statin medications for routine cardiovascular indications had a trend of lower WMF, but not lesion, permeability. This is the first demonstration of brain vascular hyperpermeability in humans with an autosomal dominant disease, as predicted mechanistically. Brain permeability, more than lesion permeability, may serve as a biomarker of CCM disease activity, and help calibrate potential drug therapy.",

Wistar rats (N = 96) were divided into the following 8 groups (12 rats each): ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) model group, high-dose, medium-dose, and low-dose Munziq groups, normal I/R group, sham model group, normal sham group, and Atorvastatin group. Changes in heart physiology and myocardial morphology after injury with MIRI were monitored in each group. Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) protein expression and serum concentrations of superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-8 were detected by using western blot and ELISA methods, respectively. The large-dose Munziq group showed the most significant changes. The VPC incurring time was not delayed in the small-dose group, but the accumulative time was significantly reduced (P < 0.01). The ventricular tachycardia incurring time did not differ significantly between groups. Compared with the normal sham surgical group, the I/R groups showed significant increases in HSP70 and CGRP expression (P < 0.01) and MDA, IL-6, and IL-8 concentrations (P < 0.05) and a significant decrease in the SOD concentration (P < 0.05). Compared with the I/R groups, Munziq intervention significantly enhanced HSP70 and CGRP expression (P < 0.01), significantly decreased MDA, IL-6, and IL-8 concentrations (P < 0.05), and significantly increased the SOD concentration (P < 0.05). In conclusion, Munziq intervention improves cardiac physiological function, increases the expression of HSP70 and CGRP, and decreases the inflammatory reaction in MIRI model rats.",

Lowering LDL-C by statin therapy is the cornerstone for cardiovascular disease prevention, but the residual risk in HoFH remains high, emphasizing the need for additional therapies. In the present study, we evaluated the effect of serial infusions with CER-001, a recombinant human apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I)-containing high-density lipoprotein-mimetic particle, on carotid artery wall dimensions in patients with HoFH.",

Before and 1 hour after the first infusion, lipid values were measured. Magnetic resonance imaging (3-T magnetic resonance imaging) scans of the carotid arteries were acquired at baseline and after 24 weeks to assess changes in artery wall dimensions. After CER-001 infusion, apoA-I increased from 114.8 \u00b1 20.7 mg/dL to 129.3 \u00b1 23.0 mg/dL. After 24 weeks, mean vessel wall area (primary end point) decreased from 17.23 to 16.75 mm(2) (P = .008).

Here we propose an approach to correct for the matrix effect in LC-MS with electrospray ionization using postcolumn infusion of eight internal standards (PCI-IS). We applied this approach to a generic ultraperformance liquid chromatography-time-of-flight (UHPLC-TOF) platform developed for small-molecule profiling with a main focus on drugs. Different urine samples were spiked with 19 drugs with different physicochemical properties and analyzed in order to study matrix effect (in absolute and relative terms). Furthermore, calibration curves for each analyte were constructed and quality control samples at different concentration levels were analyzed to check the applicability of this approach in quantitative analysis. The matrix effect profiles of the PCI-ISs were different: this confirms that the matrix effect is compound-dependent, and therefore the most suitable PCI-IS has to be chosen for each analyte. Chromatograms were reconstructed using analyte and PCI-IS responses, which were used to develop an optimized method which compensates for variation in ionization efficiency. The approach presented here improved the results in terms of matrix effect dramatically. Furthermore, calibration curves of higher quality are obtained, dynamic range is enhanced, and accuracy and precision of QC samples is increased. The use of PCI-ISs is a very promising step toward an analytical platform free of matrix effect, which can make LC-MS analysis even more successful, adding a higher reliability in quantification to its intrinsic high sensitivity and selectivity.",

Evidence regarding CAC use for screening has established an excellent prognosis in patients with no detectable CAC, and the ability to risk re-classify the majority of asymptomatic patients considered intermediate risk by traditional risk scores. While data regarding the ideal management of CAC findings are limited, evidence supports statin consideration in patients with CAC\u2009>\u20090 and individualized aspirin therapy accounting for CAD risk factors, CAC severity, and factors which increase a patient's risk of bleeding. In patients with stable or acute symptoms undergoing coronary CTA, a normal CTA predicts excellent prognosis, allowing reassurance and disposition without further testing. When CTA identifies nonobstructive CAD (<50\u00a0% stenosis), observational data support consideration of statin use/intensification in patients with extensive plaque (at least four coronary segments involved) and patients with high-risk plaque features. In patients with both nonobstructive and obstructive CAD, multiple studies have now demonstrated an ability of CTA to guide management and improve CAD risk factor control. Still, significant under-treatment of cardiovascular risk factors and high-risk image findings remain, among concerns that CTA may increase invasive angiography and revascularization.

    "109": "Lovastatin (LOV) is a statin, used to lower cholesterol which has been found as a hypolipidemic agent in commercial red yeast rice. In present study, a sensitive molecular imprinted quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) sensor was prepared by fabricating a self-assembling monolayer formation of allylmercaptane on QCM chip surface for selective determination of lovastatin (LOV) in red yeast rice. To prepare molecular imprinted quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) nanosensor, LOV imprinted poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate-methacryloylamidoaspartic acid) [p(HEMA-MAAsp)] nanofilm was attached on the modified gold surface of QCM chip. The non-modified and improved surfaces were characterized by using contact angle, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The imprinted QCM sensor was validated according to the ICH guideline (International Conference on Harmonisation). The linearity range was obtained as 0.10-1.25 nM. The detection limit of the prepared material was calculated as 0.030 nM. The developed QCM nanosensor was successfully used to examine red yeast rice. Furthermore, the stability and repeatability of the prepared QCM nanosensor were studied. The spectacular long-term stability and repeatability of the prepared LOV-imprinted QCM nanosensor make them intriguing for use in QCM sensors.",

Five of these compounds inhibit geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase (GGDPS) with IC50 values below 1 \u03bcM in enzyme assays, but in cells their apparent activity is more varied. In particular, the isomeric C-geranyl-O-prenyl and C-prenyl-O-geranyl bisphosphonates are quite different in their activity with the former consistently demonstrating greater impairment of geranylgeranylation in cells but the latter showing greater impact in the enzyme assays with GGDPS. Together, these findings suggest an organized binding of these inhibitors in the two hydrophobic channels of the geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase enzyme.", 
    "111": "Despite advances in antimicrobial chemotherapy and access to sophisticated intensive care facilities, bacterial community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) continues to carry an unacceptably high mortality rate of 10% to 15% in hospitalized cases. CAP, considered by many to be the most underestimated disease worldwide, poses a particular threat to the elderly whose numbers are steadily increasing in developed countries. Indeed, elderly patients with severe CAP, as well as those with other risk factors, are at significant risk for development of inflammation-mediated acute cardiac events that may undermine the success of antimicrobial therapy. Adjunctive antiinflammatory strategies are, therefore, of considerable potential benefit in this setting. Currently, the most promising of these are the macrolides, corticosteroids, and, more recently, statins, all of which target immune/inflammatory cells. In addition, recent insights into the immunopathogenesis of acute coronary events in patients with CAP have revealed a probable pivotal role of platelet activation, potentially modifiable by agents that possess antiinflammatory or platelet-targeted activities or both. Statins, which not only possess antiinflammatory activity but also appear to target several pathways involved in platelet activation, seem particularly well suited as adjuncts to antibiotic therapy in bacterial CAP. Following a brief consideration of the immunopathogenesis of bacterial CAP, this review is focused on mechanisms of platelet activation by CAP pathogens, as well as the pharmacologic control thereof, with emphasis on statins.", 
    "112": "Hypertension is the most common cardiovascular disease and the main risk factor for stroke, peripheral arterial disease, arterial aneurysms and kidney disease. It has been reported recently that hypertensive patients and animals are characterized by decreased density of arterioles and capillaries in the tissues, called rarefaction. Rarefaction significantly increases peripheral resistance which results in elevated blood pressure, leads to vessel damage and induction of inflammation. Therefore, we hypothesized that hypertension is associated with decreased serum concentration of physiological pro-angiogenic factors and concomitant increased production of angiogenesis inhibitors.",

    "116": "Statins are largely used in clinics in the treatment of patients with cardiovascular diseases for their effect on lowering circulating cholesterol. Lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein (LOX-1), the primary receptor for ox-LDL, plays a central role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disorders. We have recently shown that chronic exposure of cells to lovastatin disrupts LOX-1 receptor cluster distribution in plasma membranes, leading to a marked loss of LOX-1 function. Here we investigated the molecular mechanism of statin-mediated LOX-1 inhibition and we demonstrate that all tested statins are able to displace the binding of fluorescent ox-LDL to LOX-1 by a direct interaction with LOX-1 receptors in a cell-based binding assay. Molecular docking simulations confirm the interaction and indicate that statins completely fill the hydrophobic tunnel that crosses the C-type lectin-like (CTLD) recognition domain of LOX-1. Classical molecular dynamics simulation technique applied to the LOX-1 CTLD, considered in the entire receptor structure with or without a statin ligand inside the tunnel, indicates that the presence of a ligand largely increases the dimer stability. Electrophoretic separation and western blot confirm that different statins binding stabilize the dimer assembly of LOX-1 receptors in vivo. The simulative and experimental results allow us to propose a CTLD clamp motion, which enables the receptor-substrate coupling. These findings reveal a novel and significant functional effect of statins.",

    "129": "The publication of the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines on the treatment of high blood cholesterol has had a strong impact due to the paradigm shift in its recommendations. The Spanish Interdisciplinary Committee for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention and the Spanish Society of Cardiology reviewed this guideline and compared it with current European guidelines on cardiovascular prevention and dyslipidemia management. The most striking aspect of the American guideline is the elimination of the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol treat-to-target strategy and the adoption of a risk reduction strategy in 4 major statin benefit groups. In patients with established cardiovascular disease, both guidelines recommend a similar therapeutic strategy (high-dose potent statins). However, in primary prevention, the application of the American guidelines would substantially increase the number of persons, particularly older people, receiving statin therapy. The elimination of the cholesterol treat-to-target strategy, so strongly rooted in the scientific community, could have a negative impact on clinical practice, create a certain amount of confusion and uncertainty among professionals, and decrease follow-up and patient adherence. Thus, this article reaffirms the recommendations of the European guidelines. Although both guidelines have positive aspects, doubt remains regarding the concerns outlined above. In addition to using risk charts based on the native population, the messages of the European guideline are more appropriate to the Spanish setting and avoid the possible risk of overtreatment with statins in primary prevention.",

Studies in most cases focused on substances with known immunosuppressive functions, but there is growing evidence for immunomodulatory effects also of commonly used drugs with wide distribution. In particular combinations of those antiproliferative and antiphlogistic side effects of different substance classes have not been studied in detail but may substantially interfere with the development of a functional humoral and cellular immune response.

Recent meta-analyses have summarized the results of >100 randomized clinical trials and have clearly established that LDL-cholesterol is reduced by 9-12% with consumption of PS-fortified foods in different formats at doses of 2-3 g per day. PS are effective and safe cholesterol-lowering agents with many clinical applications: adjuncts to a healthy diet, common hypercholesterolemia, combination treatment with statins, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes. The cholesterol-lowering efficacy appears to be similar in all clinical situations. PS are also ideal agents to treat hypercholesterolemic children who are still not candidates to statin therapy or receive only low-dose statins. In the setting of statin treatment, the expected LDL-cholesterol reduction with PS is equivalent to up titrating twice the statin dose. There is not enough information on the efficacy of PS as add-on therapy to ezetimibe, fibrates, or bile acid binding resins. Attesting to the consistent scientific evidence on the cholesterol-lowering efficacy and safety of functional foods supplemented with PS, several national and international clinical societies have endorsed their use as adjuncts to a healthy diet.", 
    "169": "Consensus practice guidelines and the implementation of clinical therapeutic advances are usually based on the results of large, randomized clinical trials (RCTs). However, RCTs generally inform us on an average treatment effect for a presumably homogeneous population, but therapeutic interventions rarely benefit the entire population targeted. Indeed, multiple RCTs have demonstrated that interindividual variability exists both in drug response and in the development of adverse effects. The field of pharmacogenomics promises to deliver the right drug to the right patient. Substantial progress has been made in this field, with advances in technology, statistical and computational methods, and the use of cell and animal model systems. However, clinical implementation of pharmacogenetic principles has been difficult because RCTs demonstrating benefit are lacking. For patients, the potential benefits of performing such trials include the individualization of therapy to maximize efficacy and minimize adverse effects. These trials would also enable investigators to reduce sample size and hence contain costs for trial sponsors. Multiple ethical, legal, and practical issues need to be considered for the conduct of genotype-based RCTs. Whether pre-emptive genotyping embedded in electronic health records will preclude the need for performing genotype-based RCTs remains to be seen.",

Emerging evidence showed promising results of treating HPS by abolishment of intrapulmonary inflammation and angiogenesis. Rosuvastatin is a kind of 3-hydroxy-methyl-3-glutamyl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor. In addition to lipid-lowering effects, it has anti-inflammation and anti-angiogenesis properties. We postulated that rosuvastatin treatment can ameliorate HPS. Common bile duct ligation (CBDL) was applied in an experimental HPS animal model. CBDL rats received 2-week rosuvastatin (20 mg/kg/day) treatments from the fifteenth day after operation. The haemodynamic data, blood gas analysis, liver biochemistries, tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were examined after rosuvastatin treatment. The liver and lung tissues were dissected for histopathological studies and protein analyses. In the parallel groups, intrapulmonary shunts were determined. The haemodynamic and liver biochemistries were not changed after rosuvastatin treatment in CBDL rats, but the alveolar-arterial oxygen pressure gradient was significantly decreased, implying that HPS-induced hypoxia was reversed after rosuvastatin treatment. In addition, rosuvastatin treatment reduced intrapulmonary shunts and plasma levels of VEGF and TNF-\u03b1. Besides, the intrapulmonary protein expression of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB), VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-1,2 and Rho-associated A kinase were significantly down-regulated and the intrapulmonary angiogenesis was ameliorated. We concluded that rosuvastatin alleviates experimental HPS through blockade of pulmonary inflammatory angiogenesis via TNF-\u03b1/NF-\u03baB and VEGF/Rho-associated A kinase pathways down-regulation.",

Considering that previous studies reported that HMG and MGA have pro oxidant properties, the present study evaluated the ex vivo and in vitro effects of HMG and MGA on frequency and index of DNA damage in cerebral cortex and striatum of young rats. The ex vivo effects of both organic acids on 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (OHdG) levels and their in vitro effects on 2',7'-dichlorofluorescin (DCFH) oxidation and glutathione (GSH) concentrations in rat striatum were also determined. We also investigated the ex vivo effects of both organic acids on 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (OHdG) levels in rat striatum. In the ex vivo experiments, DNA damage was determined in striatum homogenates prepared 30\u00a0min after a single intrastriatal administration of HMG or MGA. On the other hand, the in vitro evaluation was performed after an incubation of rat cerebral cortex or striatum homogenates or slices in the presence of HMG or MGA during 1\u00a0h at 37\u00a0\u00b0C. We observed that the intrastriatal administration of HMG and MGA increased the frequency and the index of DNA damage, as well as OHdG staining in rat striatum. We also verified that MGA, but not HMG, increased DNA damage frequency and index in vitro in striatum of rats. In contrast, no alterations were verified in vitro in cerebral cortex. Finally, we found that HMG and MGA increased DCFH oxidation and decreased GSH concentrations in rat striatum. Therefore, it may be presumed that DNA damage provoked by HMG and MGA possibly via reactive species generation is involved, at least in part, in the pathophysiology of brain injury, particularly in the striatum of HL-deficient patients.",

The present study aimed to establish an in vitro model for the evaluation of drug efficacy in the intervention of atherosclerosis from the inflammatory perspective, and to observe the anti-inflammatory effects of tanshinone IIA and andrographolide on atherosclerosis. The IL-1\u03b2-induced inflammation-activated endothelial cell (EC)-smooth muscle cell (SMC)-mononuclear cell (MC) co-culture model was established, based on the changes in a series of atherosclerosis-associated inflammatory markers secreted by ECs and SMCs. The expression of connexin in ECs, adhesion of MCs and changes in inflammatory signalling molecules were selected as evaluation indices for the in\ufb02ammatory microenvironment of atherosclerosis. The use of this model revealed that tanshinone IIA exhibited significant efficacy against atherosclerosis and its inflammatory reactions. Inflammatory reactions were regarded as the primary mechanism underlying atherosclerosis. The established model simulated a series of relevant changes in the arterial wall under the inflammatory cytokines with oxidized low-density lipoprotein during the atherosclerotic process.

The basis of treating hyperlipidemia remains diet, physical exercise and weight reduction. Olive oil and nuts have been shown to be beneficial. Statins remain first line drug treatment. Further treatment options are ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, fibrates and fish oil. Side effects of statins include myopathies and, as shown during the last years, also an increased risk of diabetes mellitus. In patients with statin-related myopathies first results of a gene analysis have been published showing a means of predicting which statin can be administered at which dose for the individual patient with least risk of side effects. Most convincing data have been shown for simvastatin. Patients with renal insufficiency have been shown to have a raised cardiovascular risk. In the SHARP Study the combination of simvastatin plus ezetimibe was effective in reducing cardiovascular events in patients with severe renal insufficiency (especially before dialysis but also in dialysis dependent patients).

The increased level of lipid peroxidation, superoxide, protein carbonyl; decreased activity of catalase, glutathione-S-transferase, reduced glutathione and total thiol levels in MIA rats were restored to the normal levels, however, superoxide dismutase and nitric oxide levels remained unaltered by atorvastatin. Further, atorvastatin reduced the MIA-induced histopathological alteration in the knee joint.", 
    "223": "Our study demonstrated that atorvastatin attenuates MIA-induced osteoarthritic pain and protect cartilage degradation through inhibition of oxidative stress suggesting its importance in osteoarthritic pain management.", 
    "224": "Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) is widely used to exclude coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with low-to-intermediate pretest probability (PTP) of obstructive CAD. The aim of our study was to investigate the reclassification by CCTA and the implications of CCTA results on management because limited studies exist on these subjects; 1,560 patients with chest pain without a history of CAD and with low or intermediate PTP of CAD referred for CCTA from the out-patient clinic were prospectively included. PTP was defined by the Duke Clinical Score as either low (<15%), low-intermediate (15% to 50%), or high-intermediate (50% to 85%). Distribution of CCTA results among the categories of PTP of CAD and the influence of CCTA results on management were analyzed. CCTA revealed obstructive CAD in 7%, 15%, and 23% of cases, in patients with low, low-intermediate, and high-intermediate PTP, respectively; 855 of 1,031 patients (83%) with intermediate PTP of CAD showed no obstructive CAD on CCTA and were consequently reclassified. Management changes after CCTA occurred in 689 patients (44%). In 633 patients (41%), medication was altered and 135 (9%) were referred for invasive coronary angiography. Treatment with statin was initiated in 442 (28%) and stopped in 71 patients (5%). Aspirin was initiated in 192 (12%) and stopped in 139 patients (9%). In conclusion, in a routine clinical cohort, CCTA resulted in reclassification in most patients. Furthermore, our study suggests that the Duke Clinical Score overestimates the probability of obstructive CAD compared with CCTA findings. Finally, CCTA results have implications on patient management, with medication changes in 41% of patients."
