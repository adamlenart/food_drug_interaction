They also participate in antioxidant defenses, due to the synthesis of glutathione, coupled to glutamate metabolism. Although the cause of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains elusive, some changes in neurochemical parameters, such as glutamate uptake, glutamine synthetase activity and glutathione have been investigated in this disease. A possible neuroprotective effect of two statins, simvastatin and pravastatin (administered p.o.), was evaluated using a model of dementia, based on the intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of streptozotocin (STZ), and astrocyte parameters were determined. We confirmed a cognitive deficit in rats submitted to ICV-STZ, and a prevention of this deficit by statin administration. Moreover, both statins were able to prevent the decrease in glutathione content and glutamine synthetase activity in this model of AD. Interestingly, simvastatin increased per se glutamate uptake activity, while both statins increased glutamine synthetase activity per se. These results support the idea that these drugs could be effective for the prevention of alterations observed in the STZ dementia model and may contribute to reduce the cognitive impairment and brain damage observed in AD patients.", 
    "1": "Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease affecting medium and large arteries resulting from a complex interaction between genetic and environmental risk factors that include dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and smoking. The most serious manifestations of atherosclerotic vascular disease, such as unstable angina, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and sudden death, largely result from thrombosis superimposed on a disrupted (ruptured or eroded) atherosclerotic plaque. Adoption and maintenance of a healthy lifestyle coupled with management of modifiable risk factors significantly reduce the adverse clinical consequences of athero-thrombosis. Reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels using statins and other agents serves as the primary pharmacologic approach to stabilize atherosclerotic vascular disease. However, a large residual risk remains, prompting the search for additional therapies for atherosclerosis management, such as raising atheroprotective high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and/or improving HDL function. This review focuses on new and emerging HDL-based therapeutic strategies targeting atherosclerosis.",

Participants from the Utrecht Cardiovascular Pharmacogenetics (UCP) studies were enrolled from a population-based registry of pharmacy records linked to hospital discharge records (PHARMO) to investigate tagging SNPs within candidate genes involved in the cholesterol lowering pathway for modification of the effectiveness of statins in reducing the risk of myocardial infarction (MI). Patients who received a prescription for an antihypertensive drug and/or had hypercholesterolemia were selected from the PHARMO database. We designed a nested case-control study in which cases were hospitalized for MI and controls were not. Patients were contacted through their community pharmacies. For this study, only hypercholesterolemic participants were selected. Logistic regression analysis was used to investigate pharmacogenetic interactions. The Heart and Vascular Health Study (HVH) was used to replicate findings from UCP. The study population included 668 cases and 1217 controls. We selected 231 SNPs of which 209 SNPs in 27 genes passed quality control. Ten SNPs in eight genes were found to influence the effectiveness of statins in UCP, of which the most significant interaction was found with SCARB1 rs4765615.

The results allow us concluding that among high or very high cardiovascular risk patients about three patients out of five should be prescribed high-efficacy statins or drug combinations. The other two prescriptions might take into account lower-efficacy statins. If we also compute the values of HDL-c in these subjects--the large majority of which stands below the optimal values as suggested by International guidelines--we bring forward the need either to select specific statins able to increase the levels of these protective lipoproteins or to consider combination therapies of statins with fibrates or nicotinic acid. Our data might conceivably be applied to other low-cardiovascular risk countries and should be taken into account when defining the proportion of drugs with different efficacy and cost in the everyday clinical practice.",

Our primary objectives were to assess the efficacy and safety of modified-policosanol (MP) on the major lipoproteins among hyperlipidemic subjects receiving background statin therapy or as monotherapy. This 8-week clinical trial consisted of 3 arms. Subjects receiving chronic statin therapy (N\u00a0=\u00a036) were randomized in a double-blind design to MP 20\u00a0mg daily or placebo. In the third arm, subjects not receiving statin therapy (N\u00a0=\u00a018) were assigned open-label MP 20\u00a0mg daily.

The mice were monitored for the modulation of hepatic mRNA expression and the activities of lipid-regulating enzymes. Both TA and CF supplementation lowered hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) activity and prevented atherosclerotic lesion formation in comparison with the control group. Hepatic carnitine palmitoyl transferase and \u03b2-oxidation activities were significantly higher in the TA and CF groups than in the control group. Both CF and TA supplementation resulted in significant decreases in hepatic HMGR mRNA levels in association with its enzyme activity. However, in contrast to CF supplementation, TA supplementation seemed to decrease the accumulation of hepatic lipids in the apo E(- / -) mice without increasing liver weight. These results suggest that the overall effect of TA is more desirable than CF for the alleviation of hepatic lipogenesis and atherogenesis in apo E(- / -) mice.",

Furthermore, in the Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) Study, this combination did not result in a significant reduction of CVD events compared with simvastatin monotherapy. However, a possible benefit in this trial was observed in the subgroup of patients with high triglyceride and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.",

We also examined the effect of simvastatin, geraniol and the combination of both on the biosynthesis of lipids from [\u00b9\u2074C]-acetate. Our results demonstrate that the combination of simvastatin and geraniol synergistically inhibited cholesterol biosynthesis and proliferation of Hep G2 cell line, contributing to a better understanding of the action of a component of essential oils targeting a complex metabolic pathway, which would improve the use of drugs or their combination in the fight against cancer and/or cardiovascular diseases.", 
    "45": "The control and treatment of dyslipidemia is a major public health challenge, particularly for patients with coronary heart diseases. In this paper we propose a framework for survival analysis of patients who had a major cardiac event, focusing on assessment of the effect of changing LDL-cholesterol level and statins consumption on survival. This framework includes a Cox PH model and a Markov chain, and combines their results into reinforced conclusions regarding the factors that affect survival time. We prospectively studied 2,277 cardiac patients, and the results show high congruence between the Markov model and the PH model; both evidence that diabetes, history of stroke, peripheral vascular disease and smoking significantly increase hazard rate and reduce survival time. On the other hand, statin consumption is correlated with a lower hazard rate and longer survival time in both models. The role of such a framework in understanding the therapeutic behavior of patients and implementing effective secondary and primary prevention of heart diseases is discussed here.",

    "47": "Small, dense LDL, which is known to be most closely associated with atherogenesis, is more preferentially glycated in vivo and more susceptible to glycation in vitro than more buoyant LDL. Glycation and oxidation of LDL appear to be intimately linked. In patients with type 2 diabetes, plasma glycated apolipoprotein B correlated with small, dense LDL apolipoprotein B, but not with HbA1c. Glycated apolipoprotein B is significantly lower in statin-treated type 2 diabetes compared with those not on statins.", 
    "48": "Glycation of LDL occurs chiefly because of the nonenzymatic reaction of glucose and its metabolites with the free amino groups of lysine of which apolipoprotein B is rich. Higher concentrations of glycated LDL are present in diabetes than in nondiabetic individuals and metabolic syndrome. Even in nondiabetic individuals, however, there is generally more circulating glycated LDL than oxidatively modified LDL. Probably, oxidation and glycation of LDL are partially interdependent and indisputably coexist, and both prevent LDL receptor-mediated uptake and promote macrophage scavenger receptor-mediated LDL uptake. The recognition that LDL glycation is at least as important as oxidation in atherogenesis may lead to improvements in our understanding of its mechanism and how to prevent it.", 
    "49": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease commonly seen in the elderly and is characterized by progressive cognitive and physical decline. Current understanding of AD pathogenesis revolves around amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2), a product of the sequential proteolytic cleavage of the transmembrane amyloid-\u03b2 protein precursor (A\u03b2PP) by \u03b2- and \u03b3-secretase, enzymes found predominantly in the cholesterol rich micro domains of the cell membrane. Several risk factors for AD are associated with cholesterol metabolism, including dyslipidaemia, coronary artery and cerebrovascular disease. Statins are widely prescribed for their cholesterol lowering ability and show a favorable side effect profile overall. By competitive inhibition of hydroxymethyl co-enzyme A-reductase, statins reduce the production of cholesterol and isoprenoid intermediates including geranylgeranyl and farnesyl pyrophosphate. These isoprenoids modify recently translated proteins such as small GTPase molecules that are essential in numerous cell-signaling pathways, including vesicular trafficking and inflammation. In experimental models of AD, statins reduce the production of A\u03b2 by disrupting secretase enzyme function and by reducing neuroinflammation. Furthermore, epidemiological studies suggest that statins may reduce the incidence of AD. Consequently, statins, secondary of their anti-hypercholesterolaemic, plieotropic and anti-inflammatory effects, are being investigated for a potential therapeutic role. This review will discuss evidence for the role of statins in the treatment and prevention of AD neurodegeneration.", 
    "50": "Acute coronary syndromes are generally caused by atherosclerotic plaque rupture. Inflammation is one of the most important features of vulnerable plaque. Adventitial vanilloid receptor TRPV1 and sensory C-fibers may play a pistol role for adventitial inflammation. TRPV1 is also present in platelets, and the presence of this receptor may provide a link between inflammatory mediators and platelet activation in atherosclerosis. The hypothesis we propose here is that TRPV1 may be a useful therapeutic target for patients with vulnerable coronary plaques. The fact that statins act directly on sensory neurons to decrease expression of proinflammatory neuropeptides, supports our hypothesis as above. However, the mechanisms mediating this potential effect are poorly understood. Future studies are required to determine whether downregulated expression of TRPV1 contributes to these therapeutic actions.", 
    "51": "The aim of this study was to explore the influence of simvastatin dosing time, variable compliance and circadian cholesterol production on the reduction of low-density lipoprotein (LDL). A published pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PKPD) model for simvastatin was identified and evaluated. A model for circadian LDL production was incorporated into the PKPD model. Reduction in LDL from baseline was simulated stochastically from the full model at dose levels of 10, 20, 40 and 80 mg daily for 30 days. Simulated dosing times for each data set were morning (8.00 a.m.), evening (22.00 p.m.), evening with reduced compliance and evening for a hypothetical bioequivalent generic. Differences in LDL reduction from baseline between evening (33-43%) and morning dosing (31-43%) were negligible across a range of doses. Any differences were negated when variable compliance was considered. In addition, differences in simvastatin effect between morning and evening dosing were found to be within the range of LDL concentrations that would be permissible for a bioequivalent generic (at the lower limit) and hence are not likely to be important clinically. The results of this study suggest that taking simvastatin in the evening is not superior to morning dosing.",

We describe a chemical epistasis approach that can be useful in refining the mechanism of statin muscle toxicity, as well as in screening for agents that suppress muscle toxicity while preserving the ability of statins to increase the expression of the low-density lipoprotein receptor. Using this approach, we identified one compound that attenuates the muscle side effects in both cellular and animal models of statin toxicity, likely by influencing Rab prenylation. Our proof-of-concept screen lays the foundation for truly high-throughput screens that could help lead to the development of clinically useful adjuvants that can one day be co-administered with statins.",

Treatment with atorvastatin limited LDL oxidation significantly (LDL thiobarbituric acid reactive substances 2.19 nmol/mg protein, LDL-conjugated diene 222 \u03bcmol/mg protein). Paraoxonase, which prevents LDL oxidation and inactivates LDL-derived oxidized phospholipids, showed a pronounced decrease in the group receiving the atherogenic diet (110 U/L to 28 U/L), and atorvastatin treatment increased paraoxonase activity.

NMDA receptor alterations in the post-mortem rat brain were detected by [\u00b3H]MK-801(Dizocilpine) binding autoradiography. 6-hydroxydopamine treated PC12 was applied to investigate the neuroprotection of simvastatin, the association with NMDA receptors, and the anti-inflammation. 6-hydroxydopamine induced anxiety and the downregulation of NMDA receptors in the hippocampus, CA1(Cornu Ammonis 1 Area), amygdala and caudate putamen was observed in 6-OHDA(6-hydroxydopamine) lesioned rats whereas simvastatin significantly ameliorated the anxiety-like activity and restored the expression of NMDA receptors in examined brain regions. Significant positive correlations were identified between anxiolytic-like activity and the restoration of expression of NMDA receptors in the hippocampus, amygdala and CA1 following simvastatin administration. Simvastatin exerted neuroprotection in 6-hydroxydopamine-lesioned rat brain and 6-hydroxydopamine treated PC12, partially by regulating NMDA receptors, MMP9 (matrix metalloproteinase-9), and TNF-a (tumour necrosis factor-alpha).",

A study of 952 US physicians found that 83% likely would prescribe a polypill for high-risk patients and 62% likely would do so for moderate-risk patients. Among physicians in both countries, degree of risk reduction was an important factor in willingness to prescribe. Other factors considered important were side effects and cost. Physicians had low agreement with forgoing risk factor level monitoring in patients taking a polypill. The majority (89%) of US physicians surveyed would not want a polypill available without a prescription.",

Then, 42 statin-na\u00efve patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass graft surgery were randomized to atorvastatin 40 mg/d or placebo for 3 days before surgery to examine the impact of atorvastatin on endothelial function and O(2)(\u00b7-) generation in internal mammary arteries. Finally, segments of internal mammary arteries from 26 patients were used in ex vivo experiments to evaluate the statin-dependent mechanisms regulating the vascular redox state. Statin treatment was associated with improved vascular NO bioavailability and reduced O(2)(\u00b7-) generation in internal mammary arteries. Oral atorvastatin increased vascular tetrahydrobiopterin bioavailability and reduced basal and N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester-inhibitable O(2)(\u00b7-) in internal mammary arteries independently of low-density lipoprotein lowering. In ex vivo experiments, atorvastatin rapidly improved vascular tetrahydrobiopterin bioavailability by upregulating GTP-cyclohydrolase I gene expression and activity, resulting in improved endothelial NO synthase coupling and reduced vascular O(2)(\u00b7-). These effects were reversed by mevalonate, indicating a direct effect of vascular hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibition.", 
    "77": "This study demonstrates for the first time in humans the direct effects of statin treatment on the vascular wall, supporting the notion that this effect is independent of low-density lipoprotein lowering. Atorvastatin directly improves vascular NO bioavailability and reduces vascular O(2)(\u00b7-) through tetrahydrobiopterin-mediated endothelial NO synthase coupling. These findings provide new insights into the mechanisms mediating the beneficial vascular effects of statins in humans.",

This paper describes initial Phase I trials of a novel dual orexin receptor antagonist SB-649868 that has demonstrated preclinical potential for treatment of sleep disorders. The trial designs included a single ascending dose escalation study (dose range: 10-80\u2009mg in the fed and fasted states) and a multiple repeat dose study (dose range: 5-30\u2009mg in the fed state) enrolling a total of 103 male volunteer subjects. SB-649868 was well tolerated at all doses in this study population, with mechanism-related adverse events (e.g. somnolence and fatigue) observed in a majority of subjects after 60 and 80\u2009mg single doses. Although total drug exposure was similar in the fed and fasted states, the rate, but not the extent, of absorption increased in the fed state, resulting in an increased C(max). The typical estimated half-life of SB-649868 was 3-6\u2009h - comparable with currently used hypnotic agents. Repeated administration of SB-649868 dose-dependently increased exposure to simvastatin (10\u2009mg), suggesting CYP3A4 inhibition ranging from very mild (5\u2009mg) to strong (30\u2009mg). Evening dosing resulted in significant dose-dependent improvement in latency to persistent sleep, total sleep time and wake after sleep onset as measured by polysomnography. Next-morning testing did not detect evidence of residual cognitive effects. Results of these trials support further investigation of SB-649868 and other dual orexin receptor antagonists as potentially effective and well-tolerated treatments for patients with sleep disorders.",

Experiments were divided into control and test groups (5 \u00b5mol/L, 10 \u00b5mol/L, 20 \u00b5mol/L SIM groups). The growth inhibitory rate of SHI-1 cells was detected using methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) method. The cell cycle distribution and apoptotic rate were measured by using flow cytometry. The expression of BCL-2, caspase-3 mRNA were determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The expression of BCL-2, caspase-3 protein levels were analyzed by Western blot. The results demonstrated that SIM inhibited the growth of SHI-1 cells in time- and does-dependent manners. Cell cycle analysis showed that SHI-1 cells significantly arrested in S phase (p < 0.05) after treating with SIM for 48 hours, as compared with control group. 5 \u00b5mol/L SIM in test group significantly blocked cell cycle progression, but can not induce apoptosis. The expressions of BCL-2 mRNA and protein were down-regulated and caspase-3 mRNA and protein were up-regulated along with the increase of SIM concentration (p < 0.05). It is concluded that SIM is able to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis of SHI-1 cells, the mechanism may be associated with downregulating the expression of apoptosis-related gene BCL-2, upregulating the expression of caspase-3.",

It demonstrated also that treatment of simvastatin did not influence serum apoM levels in these mouse model, although serum apoM levels were increased by about 13% in the 10 mg/kg simvastatin group than in the vehicle control group without simvastatin. In HepG2 cell cultures, simvastatin could significantly decrease apoM mRNA levels with dose- and time-dependent manners. At 10 \u03bcM simvastatin treatment, apoM mRNA decreased by 52% compared to the controls.",

To categorise statin users with respect to patterns of reimbursement, this study was performed using the main French health reimbursement database for the Aquitaine region of south-western France. The cohort included subjects who submitted a reimbursement for at least one delivery of a statin (index) during the inclusion period (1st of September 2004-31st of December 2004). Indicators of adherence from reimbursement data were considered for principal component analysis. The 119,570 subjects included and analysed had a sex ratio of 1.1, mean (SD) age of 65.9 (11.9), and 13% were considered incident statin users. Principal component analysis found three dimensions that explained 67% of the variance. Using a K-means classification combined with a hierarchical ascendant classification, six groups were characterised. One group was considered nonadherent (10% of study population) and one group least adherent (1%). This novel application of principal component analysis identified groups that may be potential targets for intervention. The least adherent group appears to be one of the most appropriate because of both its relatively small size for case review with prescribing physicians and its very poor adherence.",

Atherosclerosis in characterised by the development of a fibrofatty lesion that consists of a diverse cell population, including inflammatory cells that create an intensely oxidising environment within the vessel. Coupled with normal replication, the local intracellular and extracellular environment causes damage to cellular DNA that is recognised and repaired by the DNA damage response (DDR) pathway. The role of DNA damage and the resulting deregulation of 'normal' cellular behaviour and subsequent loss of cell cycle control checkpoints have been widely studied in cancer. However, despite the extensive evidence for DNA damage in atherosclerosis, it is only over the past two decades that a causative link between DNA damage and atherosclerosis has been hypothesised. Whilst atherosclerosis is a feature of human disease characterised by defects in DNA damage, currently the role of DNA damage in the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis remains highly debated, as a 'chicken and egg' situation. This review will analyse the evidence for, the causes of, and consequences of DNA damage in atherosclerosis, detail the DNA damage response pathway that results in these consequences, and highlight therapeutic opportunities in this area. We also outline the evidence that DNA damage is a cause of both initiation and progression of atherosclerosis, and not just a consequence of disease.",

Repurposing of safe, older drugs provides a lower risk alternative. Vascular protection is a novel strategy for improving stroke outcome. Promising targets for vascular protection after stroke have been identified, and several of these targets can be approached with \"repurposed\" old drugs, including statins, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and minocycline. We tested the vascular protection (ability to reduce hemorrhagic transformation) of three marketed drugs (candesartan, minocycline, and atorvastatin) in the experimental stroke model using three different rat strains [Wistar, spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and type 2 diabetic Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats]. All agents decreased the infarct size, improved the neurological outcome and decreased bleeding. Mechanisms identified include inhibition of MMP-9, activation of Akt, and increased expression of proangiogenic growth factors. Premorbid vascular damage (presence of either diabetes or hypertension) increased the likelihood of vascular injury after ischemia and reperfusion and improved the response to vascular protection.",

Then, a search of online medical databases was performed. Meta-analyses between 1994 and 2009 involving mortality were chosen. The same was done for religiosity and spirituality. The combined hazard ratio was obtained directly by the systematic reviews and the mortality reductions by S/R and other health interventions were compared. Twenty-eight meta-analyses with mortality outcomes were selected (25 health interventions and three dealing with S/R). From these three meta-analyses, considering those with the most conservative results, persons with higher S/R had an 18% reduction in mortality. This result is stronger than 60.0% of the 25 systematic reviews analyzed (similar to consumption of fruits and vegetables for cardiovascular events and stronger than statin therapy). These results suggest that S/R plays a considerable role in mortality rate reductions, comparable to fruit and vegetable consumption and statin therapy.",

    "134": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is currently the second most frequent cause of death (after cancer) among HIV-positive subjects. The clinical use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has dramatically reduced mortality and morbidity in HIV-positive population, leading to prolonged and improved quality of life. However, as mortality and morbidity from AIDS-related conditions improve, CVD assumes increasing magnitude. It is estimated that by 2015 more than 50% of HIV-positive patients will be older than 50 years. Since age is a major unmodifiable cardiovascular risk factor, the risk for CVD in this population will significantly and progressively increase in the near future. A large part of the risk for cardiovascular events appears to be a result of lipid abnormalities characterizing HIV-positive persons. This review focuses on HIV-associated lipid abnormalities and CVD. Lipid abnormalities may be related to either viral infection, HAART or both. Dyslipidemia characterizing HIV-infected patients has become a therapeutic target to reduce cardiovascular risk of HIV-treated patients. HAART-treated patients show an atherogenic lipid profile comprised of low HDL-cholesterol levels, hypertrigliceridemia and increased levels of small-LDL particles. Current guidelines for the treatment of dyslipidemia and reducing cardiovascular risk in HIV-positive patients suggest that when lifestyle modifications (i.e., diet and exercise) and switching antiretroviral therapy are not enough, statins should be the first-line therapy for dyslipidemia. HDL raising interventions (niacin and fibrates) should be considered to raise HDL levels and lower triglyceride in HIV-infected patients. Implications of lipid-related interventions in HIV-treated patients to avoid drug interactions and their adverse effects are also discussed.",

VLCFA accumulation was much higher in CCALD oligodendrocytes than AMN oligodendrocytes but was not significantly different between CCALD and AMN neurons, indicating that the severe clinical manifestations in CCALD might be associated with abnormal VLCFA accumulation in oligodendrocytes. Furthermore, the abnormal accumulation of VLCFA in the X-ALD oligodendrocytes can be reduced by the upregulated ABCD2 gene expression after treatment with lovastatin or 4-phenylbutyrate.",

In tissue sections of atherosclerotic plaque, the expression of matrix metalloproteinases is increased. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) decrease the tissue expression of matrix metalloproteinases-1, -2, -3, and -9 in atheromatous plaque by attenuating the inflammatory process that leads to increased expression. However, it is not known whether statins decrease levels of matrix metalloproteinase-13--an enzyme crucial to the initiation of collagen degradation-as part of their plaque-stabilizing effect.We prospectively examined the effect of statin therapy on serum levels of matrix metalloproteinase-13, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1, and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol in 14 patients with hypercholesterolemia. All were at low risk for adverse cardiovascular events and were given 20 mg/d of rosuvastatin for 4 weeks. Post-therapy levels of matrix metalloproteinase-13 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 were compared with baseline levels. Although low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol levels were significantly decreased in the 14 patients (mean baseline level, 152 \u00b1 21 mg/dL vs mean post-therapy level, 73 \u00b1 45 mg/dL; P < 0.001), matrix metalloproteinase-13 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 levels were unchanged (matrix metalloproteinase-13, 0.295 \u00b1 0.06 ng/mL vs 0.323 \u00b1 0.11 ng/mL, P = 0.12; and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1, 400.8 \u00b1 43.4 ng/mL vs 395.3 \u00b1 47.5 ng/mL, P = 0.26). We conclude that even though there was a decrease in low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, short-term, high-dose rosuvastatin therapy has no effect on matrix metalloproteinase-13 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 levels in hypercholesterolemic patients.

Since that time, significant advances have been made in medical management, namely high dose statin therapy and improved antiplatelet agents, and in carotid interventions, namely the advent of carotid artery stenting. Especially with carotid stenting, the technology has grown by leaps and bounds and continues to advance at a rapid pace. These advances have necessitated new studies to compare these treatments with the gold standard of carotid endarterectomy. In asymptomatic patients, the current data does not justify medical management alone for severe (>80%) carotid stenosis. Furthermore, in both asymptomatic and symptomatic patients current studies have failed to demonstrate equivalence of CAS to CEA for significant carotid stenosis. Clearly additional studies comparing CAS, CEA, and medical management are needed to further clarify this issue.

However, the beneficial effects of this class of drugs are far greater than would be expected from lowering of cholesterol alone, and they appear to offer cardiovascular protection at multiple levels, primarily as a result of their pleiotropic activity. Indeed, their favourable effects on the heart seem to be mediated in part through reduced prenylation and subsequent inhibition of small GTPases, particularly those of the Rho family. Such statin-mediated effects are manifested by reduced onset of heart failure and improvements in cardiac dysfunction and remodelling in heart failure patients. Experimental studies have shown that statins mediate their effects on the two major resident cell types of the heart--cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts--and thus facilitate improvement of adverse remodelling of ischaemic or non-ischaemic aetiology. This review examines evidence for the cellular effects of statins in the heart, and discusses the underlying molecular mechanisms at the level of the cardiomyocyte (hypertrophy, cell death and contractile function) and the cardiac fibroblast (differentiation, proliferation, migration and extracellular matrix synthesis).

The aim of this study was to assess the temporal change in the concordance between patient presenting risk and the intensity of evidence-based therapies received for non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes over a 9-year period. Data from 3,562 patients with non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes enrolled in the Australian and New Zealand population of the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) from 1999 to 2007 were analyzed. Patients were stratified to risk groups on the basis of the GRACE risk score for in-hospital mortality. Main outcome measures included in-hospital use of widely accepted evidence-based medications, investigations, and procedures. Invasive management was consistently higher in low-risk patients than in intermediate- or high-risk patients (coronary angiography 66.7% vs 63.5% vs 35.3%, p <0.001; percutaneous coronary intervention 31.1% vs 22.0% vs 12.9%, p <0.001). Absolute rates of angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention in the high-risk group remained 24% and 15% lower compared to the low-risk group in the most recent time period (2005 to 2007). In-hospital use of thienopyridine, low-molecular weight heparin, and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors showed a similar inverse relation with risk. Prescription of aspirin, \u03b2 blockers, statins, and angiotensin receptor blockers was inversely related to risk before 2004, although this inverse relation was no longer present in the most recent time period (2005 to 2007). Only in-hospital use of unfractionated heparin showed use concordant with patient risk status. In conclusion, despite an overall increase in the uptake of evidence-based therapies, most investigations and treatments are not targeted on the basis of patient risk. Clinician risk stratification remains suboptimal compared to objective measures of patient risk.",

Trials focused on insulin resistance are ongoing and they may be able to help establish the management of diabetes/impaired glucose tolerance. Evidence for treatment of dyslipidemia has contrasted science to diabetes mellitus.

The present study aimed to examine the role of OATP2B1 in the intestinal absorption and tissue uptake of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins). We first investigated the functional affinity of statins to the transporter as a function of extracellular pH, using OATP2B1-transfeced HEK293 cells. The results indicate that OATP2B1-mediated transport is significant for rosuvastatin, fluvastatin and atorvastatin, at neutral pH. However, OATP2B1 showed broader substrate specificity as well as enhanced transporter activity at acidic pH. Furthermore, uptake at acidic pH was diminished in the presence of proton ionophore, suggesting proton gradient as the driving force for OATP2B1 activity. Notably, passive transport rates are predominant or comparable to active transport rates for statins, except for rosuvastatin and fluvastatin. Second, we studied the effect of OATP modulators on statin uptake. At pH 6.0, OATP2B1-mediated transport of atorvastatin and cerivastatin was not inhibitable, while rosuvastatin transport was inhibited by E-3-S, rifamycin SV and cyclosporine with IC(50) values of 19.7 \u00b1 3.3 \u03bcM, 0.53 \u00b1 0.2 \u03bcM and 2.2 \u00b1 0.4 \u03bcM, respectively. Rifamycin SV inhibited OATP2B1-mediated transport of E-3-S and rosuvastatin with similar IC(50) values at pH 6.0 and 7.4, suggesting that the inhibitor affinity is not pH-dependent. Finally, we noted that OATP2B1-mediated transport of E-3-S, but not rosuvastatin, is pH sensitive in intestinal epithelial (Caco-2) cells. However, uptake of E-3-S and rosuvastatin by Caco-2 cells was diminished in the presence of proton ionophore. The present results indicate that OATP2B1 may be involved in the tissue uptake of rosuvastatin and fluvastatin, while OATP2B1 may play a significant role in the intestinal absorption of several statins due to their transporter affinity at acidic pH.",

The maximum yield of lovastatin, 916.7 \u03bcg/ml, was obtained as A. terreus Z15-7 was submerged cultured in the chemically defined medium supplemented with 3% glycerol as a carbon source, 1% corn meal as an organic nitrogen source, and 0.2% sodium nitrate as an inorganic nitrogen source at 30 \u00b0C in the shake flask. The result shows that heavy-ion beam irradiation is an effective method for the mutation breeding of lovastatin production of A. terreus."
