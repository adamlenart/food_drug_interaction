We thus approached the question of whether treatment with simvastatin might improve cardiovascular function and survival in sepsis.", 
    "1": "Mice treated with simvastatin and rendered septic by cecal ligation and perforation (CLP) show a mean survival time close to 4 times the value found in untreated mice. This dramatic improvement is based on a complete preservation of cardiac function and hemodynamic status, which are severely impaired in untreated CLP mice [eg, 20 hours after CLP, cardiac output declined from 1.24+/-0.09 to 0.87+/-0.11 mL x min(-1) x g(-1) in untreated mice (P<0.005; n=12), while remaining unaltered (1.21+/-0.08 mL x min(-1) x g(-1) at baseline and 1.15+/-0.1 mL x min(-1) x g(-1) 20 hours after CLP, P=NS, n=12) in CLP mice treated with simvastatin]. Untreated CLP mice remained refractory to beta-stimulation, whereas the responsiveness to dobutamine was restored by treatment with simvastatin. Susceptibility of coronary flow to endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) stimulation by bradykinin was close to 3 times as pronounced in untreated CLP mice as in untreated sham-operated mice, indicating a high level of eNOS activation secondary to sepsis. In addition, treatment with simvastatin reversed inflammatory alterations in CLP mice, namely, increased monocyte adhesion to endothelium.", 
    "2": "Simvastatin, which is well established in the treatment of lipid disorders and coronary artery disease, might have the additional potential of being an effective agent in sepsis treatment.", 
    "3": "A few past clinical and recent case-control studies of statin use, for example, in patients with and without prostate cancer have not demonstrated its potential for reducing or preventing the risk for this disease, and the potential for benefit may have been a confounding coincidence. Data from larger continuing and future studies will be needed to resolve this issue, but the recent data on cholesterol or dyslipidemia and risk increase or reduction with treatment are interesting, especially because of other potential improvements with therapy in nonprostate cancers. In addition, the finding that some available cancer treatments improve some parameters of the lipid profile is fascinating, and some cancer drugs are being used in a specific cardiovascular disease treatment setting to improve outcome. Even if CHD, dyslipidemia, and the treatment of these conditions has no role in preventing prostate cancer or its progression, what has been lost? CVD is still the leading cause of death of men, and a heart-healthy program for the patient concerned about prostate disease would reduce this primary cause of death. Patients would take a step forward in improving all-cause mortality. Recent data from surveys, however, continue to demonstrate that men have an inadequate understanding of cholesterol and heart disease. Crisis creates opportunity, and individuals working in urology have ample reasons not only to discuss the overall benefits of reducing lipid markers, but to improve cholesterol and CHD awareness as much as health professionals working in other fields of medicine. The marriage between general preventive medicine and urology seems to be inevitable, and in the authors' opinion, this merger will provide the foundation for novel research that could affect patients' lives dramatically.",

We approached 169 physicians responsible for lipid clinics for information on their practice in young patients, and valid responses were received from 54%. A typical lipid clinic has only 3.5 patients aged under 16 with FH. In boys aged 10-15 years 65% of physicians were prepared to treat with bile acid sequestrants but only 23% with statins. There was greater reluctance to treat in girls of the same age, corresponding figures being 52% and 12%. Despite the efficacy of statins in reducing low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol, these agents are little used in children with FH. Their safety and clinical efficacy should be assessed by a randomized double-blind trial.", 
    "9": "This article will review six of the most important insights that have come from the measurement of apolipoprotein B (apoB). Amongst these are critical clinical advances, which include better definition of those at high risk of vascular disease and better definition of the adequacy of statin therapy. There are also major advances in our understanding of the fundamental processes that interact to cause vascular disease. These include a more precise understanding of the determinants of lipoprotein levels and lipoprotein composition in plasma and, even more importantly, an appreciation of the pivotal role excess fatty acid intake and impaired fatty acid trapping by adipose tissue play in the generation of the complex risk profile that is so common in patients with coronary disease. We have designated the constellation of hypertriglyceridemic (hyperTg) hyperapoB, dysglycemia, and elevated levels of markers of prothrombosis and inflammation--all of which are traceable to adipose tissue dysfunction--as the Medusa Hypothesis. The Medusa Hypothesis puts forward a common pathophysiology for the complex and biologically diverse array of factors that have been associated with vascular disease.",

The cardiovascular risk profile and laboratory parameters of inflammation (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP], serum amyloid A [SAA], fibrinogen, serum albumin, neutrophil counts) were obtained, and patients were followed for a median of 21 months (interquartile range 12-25) for the occurrence of myocardial infarction (MI) and death. We observed 19 MIs (5 fatal and 14 nonfatal) and 65 deaths. Cumulative survival and event-free survival rates (freedom from death and MI) at 6, 12, and 24 months were 97%, 95%, and 89%, and 96%, 93% and 87%, respectively. Patients receiving statin therapy (n=269, 52%) had a lower level of inflammation (hs-CRP p<0.001, SAA p=0.001, fibrinogen p=0.007, albumin p<0.001, neutrophils p=0.049) and better survival (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.52, p=0.022) and event-free survival rates (adjusted HR 0.48, p=0.004) than patients not treated with statins. However, patients with low inflammatory activity (hs-CRP < or =0.42 mg/dl) had no significant benefit from statin therapy (p=0.74 for survival; p=0.83 for event-free survival), whereas in patients with high hs-CRP (>0.42 mg/dl) statin therapy was associated with a significantly reduced risk for mortality (adjusted HR 0.58, p=0.046) and the composite of myocardial infarction and death (adjusted HR 0.46, p=0.016).",

    "16": "Here, we characterize the actions of MK-0767, a dual ligand of the nuclear receptors peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)alpha and PPARgamma. In cell-based assays, MK-0767 produced potent activation of human PPARgamma and PPARalpha with a gamma:alpha potency ratio of approximately 2. The dual agonist induced high affinity interactions of PPARalpha and PPARgamma with the transcriptional coactivator CBP in vitro. In ob/ob mice, MK-0767 normalized hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia with equal or greater potency and efficacy than pioglitazone. Treatment of hamsters with MK-0767 produced substantial reductions in blood cholesterol and triglycerides. In dogs, MK-0767 reduced serum cholesterol levels with a potency more than 10-fold greater than simvastatin. The efficacies of MK-0767 and simvastatin were additive when given together. We conclude that MK-0767 is a potent dual PPARalpha/gamma agonist with robust insulin sensitizing and hypolipidemic activities.", 
    "17": "Statin trials have indicated that effective reduction of serum cholesterol should last up to one year before reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases can be detected. This observation can be applied most probably also to the use of plant stanol/sterol ester spreads for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. However, despite the fact that the two spreads lower serum cholesterol similarly in short term studies, a comparison of one year results reveals an inconsistent effect of plant sterol spread as compared with that of plant stanol spread on cholesterol concentration in both men and women. This favors the use of plant stanol ester spread for long-term lowering of serum cholesterol. Doses of about 2 g/day of plant stanols as fatty acid ester spread enhances fecal elimination of cholesterol, but not of bile acids, through inhibition of cholesterol absorption by about 40%. This lowers serum total and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol despite enhanced compensatory increase in cholesterol synthesis by about 10% and 15% as compared with control spread, respectively, and by up to 20% as compared with the baseline diet. About one-third of mildly hypercholesterolemic subjects reach an accepted cholesterol level. A small dose of statin should be added to treatment in individuals resistant to monotherapy with plant stanol ester spread. A life-long consumption of plant stanol ester spread has been predicted to lower coronary events by about 20%.",

    "21": "Lipid values were significantly reduced in both treatment groups, but with significantly greater reduction in the aggressively treated group. Furthermore, aggressive statin treatment significantly decreased hsCRP and fibrinogen, while only small reductions were seen in the conventionally treated group, resulting in significant differences between the two treatment groups (p < 0.001). Nitric oxide-total increased significantly in both treatment groups, although the increase was more pronounced in the aggressively treated group (22.6 vs. 15.6%).", 
    "22": "Aggressive statin treatment significantly improved lipid status and reduced markers of inflammation and improved endothelial function compared with conventional treatment in patients with CAD.

    "23": "Statins are among the most widely prescribed drugs. An increasing number of lupus-like syndrome has recently been reported with these lipid-lowering agents. We describe a new case associated with simvastatin therapy. The presence of anti-dsDNA antibodies in the serum is for the first time reported confirming that statins may also induce a systemic autoimmune reaction. Statin-induced lupus-like syndrome is characterized by the long delay between the beginning of therapy and the skin eruption. Antinuclear antibodies may persist for many months after drug discontinuation. The causal relationship may be therefore difficult to establish, and probably many cases are unrecognized. Early diagnosis may avoid unnecessary immunosuppressive therapy.", 
    "24": "Today 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) are the most often prescribed drugs among the therapeutics for hypercholesterolemia. Pitavastatin is a novel statin that has been developed entirely in Japan from the biological screening to clinical studies persuing more efficatious statin than hitherto known. Preclinical studies on drug metabolism revealed that pitavastatin is distributed selectively to the liver, excreted into bile without metabolic modification, and efficiently re-circulates to the liver to show a prolonged plasma half-life. In guinea pigs, pitavastatin enhanced hepatic LDL receptor activity and reduced VLDL secretion in a liver perfusion study, and it lowered plasma total cholesterol (TC) levels at 0.3 mg/kg and triglyceride (TG) levels at 1 mg/kg, respectively, and more. From these results, pitavastatin is assumed to lower LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) by promoting LDL receptor expression and further potentiate the cholesterol-lowering effect and exert TG-lowering effect by reducing VLDL secretion. (14)C-Pitavastatin is metabolized with CYP2C9 to 8-hydroxy derivative, but its Vmax /Km was about 2 micro l/min/mg, about 1/8 to 1/100 in comparison to the reported values of other statins, indicating that pitavastatin is hardly metabolized. Also, other human P450 species were not inhibited by pitavastatin. Therefore, pitavastatin is considered to have little interaction with drugs through P450. In the summarized clinical results with 862 patients, pitavastatin lowered TC and LDL-C by 28% and 40%, respectively. There was no difference in the frequency of side effects and no serious adverse effect was observed for pitavastatin. Pitavastatin possesses superior plasma lipid-improving effects, induces little drug interaction, and is expected to make a good contribution to the medication of hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "25": "3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors or statins are competitive inhibitors of the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. Several large landmark clinical studies have shown a marked reduction of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in patients treated with statins. Because of the strong association between serum cholesterol levels and coronary artery disease, investigators initially assumed that the predominant beneficial effects of statins result from their lipid-lowering properties. However, more recent observations have suggested that the clinical benefits of statins may be in part independent of their cholesterol-lowering effects. The pleiotropic or cholesterol-independent effects of statins might result from preventing the production of isoprenoids. Isoprenoids serve as important lipid attachments for the post-translational modification of a variety of proteins such as small GTP binding proteins implicated in intracellular signaling. The list of different pleiotropic effects of statins is still growing and, among others, includes the modulatory effects of statins on endothelial function, oxidative stress, coagulation, plaque stability, and inflammation. The pleiotropic effects of statins represent an area of great interest in prevention and therapy of cardiovascular and other chronic diseases. An area of particular interest is the potential beneficial effects of statins in diabetes and its micro/macrovascular complications. This review summarizes our current understanding of the pleiotropic effects of statins in diabetes and the modulatory effects of statins in various pathobiological pathways involved in diabetes and its complications.",

The clinical characteristics of 95 case reports submitted to the World Health Organization (WHO), the Food and Drug Administration, and the National Registry of Drug-Induced Ocular Side Effects are summarized with classification of this ocular side effect according to WHO criteria. The average time to onset of ocular hemorrhage was 300 days with 11 positive dechallenge reports and 2 positive rechallenge cases. Some patients also received medications known to increase bleeding times. From the collected data, ocular hemorrhage is \"possibly\" due to statin therapy.", 
    "27": "Corticosteroids and azathioprine are considered standard treatment for autoimmune hepatitis. There are, however, well-known systemic side effects that may preclude continuation with these immunosuppressive therapies, and small trials of the anti-metabolite mycophenolate mofetil have been reported. We report liver biopsy findings in a follow-up biopsy of a patient who had been switched from azathioprine to mycophenolate mofetil for treatment of presumed, steroid-responsive autoimmune hepatitis. Both cytoplasmic features of adaptation and nuclear alterations were noted in hepatocytes. Possible mechanisms for these findings are discussed.", 
    "28": "Atherosclerosis is at least in part an inflammatory disease. CD14 is an endotoxin receptor that after binding of lipopolysaccharides evokes endothelial activation and secretion of several cytokines. A polymorphism of CD14 has been associated with myocardial infarction. We evaluated the role of the -159 T/C polymorphism in the promoter region of the CD14 gene in relation to severity and progression of coronary atherosclerosis and response to the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor pravastatin. We recruited patients from the multi-center double-blind randomized placebo controlled REGRESS trial and genotyped the -159T/C CD14 polymorphism. DNA and angiographic follow-up were available from 759 patients with objectivated coronary artery disease. We measured changes in mean segment diameter (MSD) and minimum obstruction diameter (MOD) with quantitative coronary angiography and noted the occurrence of major adverse cardiac events. The genotype distribution was 28% TT, 49% CT, 23% CC. We did not find any association between genotype and MSD and MOD at baseline, frequency of previous myocardial infarction, changes in MSD and MOD or major clinical events. Treatment with the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor pravastatin reduced progression of coronary atherosclerosis and adverse events equally for all genotypes. We conclude, that the -159T/C polymorphism in the CD14 monocyte receptor gene was not associated with progression of coronary atherosclerosis in this population nor did it influence the efficacy of pravastatin in the treatment of atherosclerosis.", 
    "29": "Hyperimmunoglobulinemia D (hyper-IgD) and periodic fever syndrome, a hereditary autoinflammatory syndrome, is characterized by lifelong recurrent episodes of fever and inflammation. No effective treatment is known. It is caused by a defect of mevalonate kinase, an enzyme that follows 3'-hydroxy-3'-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase in the isoprenoid pathway. We wanted to test the hypothesis that inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase would ameliorate the inflammatory attacks. Six patients with hyper-IgD syndrome and proven mevalonate kinase deficiency were followed up for 2 treatment periods with either simvastatin, 80 mg/d, or placebo for 24 weeks, separated by a 4-week washout period in a double-blind fashion. Simvastatin resulted in a drop in urinary mevalonic acid concentration in all patients and decreased the number of febrile days in 5 of 6 patients. No side effects were observed. These data offer preliminary evidence for the hypothesis that simvastatin may improve inflammatory attacks in the hyper-IgD syndrome. This highlights the anti-inflammatory properties of HMG-CoA reductase inhibition.", 
    "30": "Coadministration of statins and gemfibrozil is associated with an increased risk for myopathy, which may be due in part to a pharmacokinetic interaction. Therefore the effect of gemfibrozil on rosuvastatin pharmacokinetics was assessed in healthy volunteers. Rosuvastatin has been shown to be a substrate for the human hepatic uptake transporter organic anion transporter 2 (OATP2). Inhibition of this transporter could increase plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin. The effect of gemfibrozil on rosuvastatin uptake by cells expressing OATP2 was also examined.", 
    "31": "In a randomized, double-blind, 2-period crossover trial, 20 healthy volunteers were given oral doses of gemfibrozil, 600 mg, or placebo twice daily for 7 days. On the fourth morning of each dosing period, a single oral dose of rosuvastatin, 80 mg, was coadministered. Plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin, N-desmethyl rosuvastatin, and rosuvastatin-lactone were measured. In addition, the effect of gemfibrozil on the uptake of radiolabeled rosuvastatin by OATP2-transfected Xenopus oocytes was studied.", 
    "32": "Gemfibrozil increased the rosuvastatin area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to the time of the last quantifiable concentration [AUC(0-t)] 1.88-fold (90% confidence interval, 1.60-2.21) and the maximum observed rosuvastatin plasma concentration (C(max)) 2.21-fold (90% confidence interval, 1.81-2.69) compared with placebo. N-desmethyl rosuvastatin AUC(0-t) and C(max) decreased by 48% and 39%, respectively. Pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin-lactone was unchanged. The in vitro results indicate that the maximum gemfibrozil inhibition of rosuvastatin OATP2-mediated uptake was 50%; the inhibition constant for the inhibitory process was 4.0 +/- 1.3 micromol/L.", 
    "33": "Gemfibrozil increased rosuvastatin plasma concentrations approximately 2-fold, which is similar to the effect of gemfibrozil on pravastatin, simvastatin acid, and lovastatin acid plasma concentrations and substantially less than the effect observed for cerivastatin. Gemfibrozil inhibition of OATP2-mediated rosuvastatin hepatic uptake may contribute to the mechanism of the drug-drug interaction. Care is warranted when gemfibrozil is coadministered with rosuvastatin and other statins.",

Strikingly, values of AUC(0-6) from the OATP-C *1b group were more than 60% lower than those derived from carriers of the wild-type OATP-C *1a haplotype, although this difference failed to reach statistical significance. However, the amount of pravastatin excreted into the urine from time 0 to 12 hours [Ae(0-12)] was significantly diminished in the OATP-C *1b haplotype group (1729 +/- 907 microg) compared with *1a wild-type control subjects (2974 +/- 1590 microg) (P =.049).",

    "42": "In the present study we investigated the effects of simvastatin treatment on lipid metabolism and peroxidation, antioxidant enzyme activities and ultrastructure of the diabetic rat myocardium. Diabetes was induced by single injection of streptozotocin (45 mg/kg i.p.). Eight weeks after induction of diabetes, a subgroup of control and of diabetic rats was treated with simvastatin for 4 weeks (10 mg/kg/day, orally). Blood glucose, plasma cholesterol and triacylglycerol, as well as levels of cardiac thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) were significantly increased in diabetic rats. The activities of antioxidant enzymes, catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSHPx), were also elevated in the diabetic myocardium. Treatment with simvastatin markedly reduced serum triacylglycerol and cholesterol, and partially controlled hyperglycemia in diabetic animals. The increased activation of antioxidant enzymes and the excess of lipid peroxidation measured by TBARS were completely reversed by simvastatin treatment. Diabetic rats displayed ultrastructural ischemia-like alterations of cardiomyocytes and capillaries, which support oxidative stress-induced tissue remodelling. In the diabetic myocardium simvastatin treatment partly attenuated angiopathic and atherogenic processes, detected by electron microscopy. These results suggest that simvastatin, known as a lipid-lowering drug, may positively affect diabetes induced cardiovascular complications via reducing risks of atherosclerotic pathological processes, such as imbalance between oxidant and antioxidant state.", 
    "43": "This prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind clinical trial was performed to analyze the effect of atorvastatin compared with placebo on the occurrence of a 6-month composite of cardiovascular events after vascular surgery.

    "47": "Leukocytes play important roles in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy. Recently, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors have been reported to exert various effects in addition to their lipid-lowering ability. We investigated the effects of simvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, on leukocyte-induced diabetic changes in retinas. Diabetes was induced in Long-Evans rats with streptozotocin, and simvastatin administration was begun immediately after the induction of diabetes. Two weeks of treatment with simvastatin suppressed significantly the number of leukocytes adhering to retinal vessel endothelium and the number of leukocytes accumulated in the retinal tissue by 72.9% and 41.0%, respectively (P < 0.01). The expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and the CD18 (the common beta-chain of ICAM-1 ligands) were both suppressed with simvastatin. The amount of vascular endothelial growth factor in the retina was attenuated in the simvastatin-treated group. To evaluate the effects of simvastatin on leukocyte-induced endothelial cell damage, vascular permeability in the retina was measured with fluorescein-labeled dextran. Treatment with simvastatin markedly reduced retinal permeability (P = 0.014). This suggests that simvastatin attenuates leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions and subsequent blood-retinal barrier breakdown via suppression of vascular endothelial growth factor-induced ICAM-1 expression in the diabetic retina. Simvastatin may thus be useful in the prevention of diabetic retinopathy.", 
    "48": "Nitric oxide (NO) generated by endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) plays a crucial role in vascular function and homeostasis. NO possesses vasodilatory, anti-inflammatory, antithrombotic and antiproliferative properties. Augmentation of NO production increases cerebral blood flow, which can lead to neuroprotection during brain ischaemia. Several modalities that upregulate eNOS expression and/or activity have recently been identified, including HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), steroid hormones, nutrients and physical activity. They all increase NO bioavailability, leading to enhanced cerebral blood flow and protection from ischaemic stroke. Thus, therapeutic modalities that target eNOS not only serve as preventive measures to reduce stroke incidence but also could represent novel treatment strategies for reducing brain injury during cerebral ischaemia.", 
    "49": "With the aim of identifying new target genes that could contribute to limit foam cell formation, we analyzed changes in the pattern of gene expression in human THP-1 macrophages treated with atorvastatin and oxidized-LDL (oxLDL). To this end, we used a human cDNA array containing 588 cardiovascular-related cDNAs. Exposure to oxLDL resulted in differential expression of 26 genes, while coincubation with atorvastatin modified the expression of 29 genes, compared to treatment with oxLDL alone. Changes in the expression of candidate genes, potentially connected to the atherosclerotic process, were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot. We show that atorvastatin prevents the increase in the expression of scavenger receptor CD68 and that of fatty acid binding protein 4 caused by oxLDL. In addition, atorvastatin reduces the expression of HDL-binding protein, apolipoprotein E, and matrix metalloproteinase 9. These findings are relevant to understand the direct antiatherogenic effects of statins on macrophages.",

Statin therapy was administered to 134 patients (12%) during the study period. Over a 1.3-year mean follow-up, there were 413 deaths (29 deaths/100 person-years). Adjusting for age, gender, diabetes, smoking, heart failure etiology, ejection fraction, and New York Heart Association class, statin therapy was associated with a 62% lower risk of death (hazard ratio 0.38, 95% confidence interval 0.23 to 0.65), or 1 fewer death/5 patients taking statin therapy for 1 year. This association was not greatly altered by additional adjustment for a variety of other patient characteristics, including serum cholesterol levels. After propensity score analyses, statin therapy was still associated with a 48% lower risk of death (hazard ratio 0.52, 95% confidence interval 0.30 to 0.89).

In this study, we proposed that simvastatin reduces MMP-9 expression in osteoblasts and HT1080 fibrosarcoma cell line. Gelatin zymography, Western blot analysis and reverse transcriptase-PCR were used to investigate the effects of simvastatin on MMP-9 in primary calvaria cells, U2-OS osteosarcoma cells, and HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells. The results from gelatin zymography and Western blot analysis revealed that simvastatin suppressed MMP-9 activity in these cells in concentration- and time-dependent manners. The effective concentrations of simvastatin were 100 - 500 nM, 5 - 15 microM, and 2.5 - 10 microM in primary calvaria, U2-OS, and HT1080 cells, respectively.

In primary prevention, although the target levels of LDL-C fixed by the AFSSAPS were attained in 94.4% and 82.6% respectively for patients with no other risk factor or with one associated risk factor, the objectives were reached in only 55.4% of patients with two other risk factors and in 29.6% of patients with more than two other risk factors. In secondary prevention, the AFSSAPS objectives were attained in only 45.2% of patients.

GPs found it difficult to prioritize patients for statin treatment, their statin treatment targets varied, and many found primary prevention risk assessment tools difficult to interpret. Coronary prevention was limited by practice space and organisational issues, by problems with recording and retrieval of electronic data, and by limited doctor and nurse time. GPs suggested that funded nurse time, nurse-led heart disease clinics, and better use of electronic data would improve primary care coronary prevention.",

These agents competitively inhibit HMG CoA reductase, which is the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of HMG CoA to L-mevalonate. Although L-mevalonate is a key intermediate in cholesterol synthesis, several of its metabolites are involved in post-translational modification of specific proteins involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. Thus, independent of their cholesterol-reducing properties, statins have important pleiotropic biologic effects. Recent reports indicate that statins have anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties. Whether statins will be of clinical benefit for patients with multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system will only be known after they are evaluated in prospective randomized clinical trials.",

Of the two types of ischemic stroke, thrombotic stroke is caused by a thrombus that develops within the cerebral vasculature, while embolic stroke arises from a distant embolus that lodges in a cerebral artery. The neurologic manifestations of stroke depend on the location of injury in the brain and the degree of ischemia or infarction. Symptoms may be reversible or irreversible and range from sensory deficits to hemiplegia. Risk factors for development of ischemic stroke include hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, smoking, atrial fibrillation, prior stroke, and transient ischemic attack. Tissue plasminogen activator is currently the only available drug treatment for acute ischemic stroke. Stroke recurrence rates are high (about 40% over 5 years), and all ischemic stroke patients should receive antithrombotic therapy (unless contraindicated) for secondary prevention.

In contrast, atorvastatin conferred an early clinical benefit in the lipid-lowering arm of the long-term Anglo Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial as well as early benefit on progression of atherosclerosis in the Reversal of Atherosclerosis with Aggressive Lipid Lowering trial. An unexpected finding at baseline in the prospective Interaction of Atorvastatin and Clopidogrel Study was that patients on atorvastatin had significantly decreased platelet activity compared with either patients on other statins or those taking no statins. Atorvastatin has protective effects against membrane lipid peroxidation at pharmacologic concentrations.

However, the interaction between angiotensin II receptor blocker and statin, and monocyte-derived microparticles in atherosclerosis is poorly understood. The effects of losartan and simvastatin on circulating concentrations of monocyte-derived microparticles, chemokines, and soluble adhesion markers were studied in hypertensive patients with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus. Monocyte-derived microparticles were measured by flow cytometry, and levels of serum chemokines (MCP-1 and RANTES) and soluble adhesion markers (sP-selectin and sVCAM-1) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Losartan decreased both the systolic and diastolic blood pressure in hypertensive patients with and without type 2 diabetes mellitus. The concentrations of monocyte-derived microparticles, chemokines, and soluble adhesion molecules were higher in hypertensive patients who also had type 2 diabetes mellitus vs. those who did not. The administration of angiotensin II receptor blocker decreased the circulating concentration of all these markers. In addition, all markers were decreased by combination therapy, and monocyte-derived microparticles were decreased more with combination therapy with losartan and simvastatin than monotherapy with losartan. The administration of angiotensin II receptor blocker inhibited monocyte-derived microparticle generation and suggests that angiotensin II is intimately related to vascular changes that occur in type 2 diabetes mellitus. Combination therapy with a statin and angiotensin II receptor blocker might be valuable as anti-atherosclerotic therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and nephropathy.",

Furthermore, we examined the effects of a 30-day treatment with atorvastatin on serum levels of these inflammatory factors. Serum concentrations of MMP-1, -2, -9, TIMP-1, IL-6 and TNF-alpha were measured (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method) in 23 acute myocardial infarction patients and 20 unstable angina patients on 0 day, 1st, 3rd, 7th and 30th day after admission. Sixteen normal volunteers were used as healthy controls.

In patients with myocardial infarction and unstable angina, serum levels of MMP-2, -9, TIMP-1, TNF-alpha and IL-6 were significantly higher than those of healthy controls in all time frames (p<0.05). In the group of unstable angina patients, we observed a statistically significant reduction in the levels of MMP-9, TIMP-1 and IL-6 after the 30-day atorvastatin administration. Our results suggest that serum MMPs, TIMP-1 and proinflammatory cytokines play an important role in the pathophysiology of the acute coronary syndromes.

Statins can reduce cholesterol levels but their use in heart transplant patients is complicated by pharmacokinetic interactions with cyclosporin and the risk of serious adverse effects including rhabdomyolysis. Fluvastatin has been used safely to treat hypercholesterolemia in renal transplant patients but there are few data relating to its use after heart transplantation. Therefore, we conducted a randomised blinded placebo controlled trial.", 
    "112": "Seventy-nine patients, 3 months to 12 years after heart transplantation with a low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol between 3.5 and 8.0 mmol/l were randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive either fluvastatin 40 mg od (n=52) or matching placebo (n=27). Changes in total cholesterol (TC) in the fluvastatin and placebo groups were -17.0% and +4.5%, respectively, (p<0.001); the corresponding changes in LDL were -20.5% and +4.8% (P<0.001) and in triglycerides -14.5% and +7.1% (p=0.012) at the end of the 1-year study period. Withdrawals were more frequent in the fluvastatin group (23% vs. 11% p=0.24). Two deaths occurred during the study (the rate expected from International Society of Heart Lung Transplantation registry) and appeared to be unrelated to the study medication. There were no episodes of rhabdomyolysis or other serious drug-related side effects.",

RPMI 8226 and U266 myeloma cells seeded in culture plates were treated with Sim (5 and 10 microM, respectively) combined with melphalan (Mel; 25 and 20 microM, respectively) or dexamethasone (Dex; 1 microM). We assessed cell cycle (propidium iodide staining and flow cytometric analysis), cell morphology, viability (WST1), total cell count and cell death (Trypan blue exclusion). Sim significantly enhanced the anti-myeloma activity of cytotoxic agents in vitro (p<0.05). Incubation of U266 and RPMI 8226 with Sim prior to Mel increased the cytotoxicity in an additive manner, whereas the exposure of U266 to combined Sim and Dex resulted in a synergistic amplification of the individual effects. Combined application of Dex and Sim to RPMI 8226 cells resulted in antagonistic activity. The possible roles of Ras and phosphoinositol 3-kinase are discussed.",

Statin therapy reduced major coronary events by 27% (95%CI 23, 30%), stroke by 18% (95%CI 10, 25%) and all-cause mortality by 15% (95%CI 8, 21%). There was a 4% (95%CI -10, 3%) nonsignificant reduction in noncardiovascular mortality. The reduction in major coronary events is independent of gender and presence of hypertension or diabetes. The risk reduction was greater in smokers (P < 0.05). Coronary events were reduced by 23% (95%CI 18, 29%) in pravastatin trials and 29% (95%CI 25, 33%) in five trials using other statins. Pravastatin reduced strokes by 12% (95%CI 1, 21%) whilst other statins reduced strokes by 24% (95%CI 16, 32%) (P = 0.04).",

Patients with RA with a wide range of comorbid conditions, disease activity, and background medications were randomly assigned in a 4:1 allocation ratio to treatment with anakinra 100 mg or placebo administered daily by injection. Safety was assessed by comparing adverse event profiles between anakinra and placebo patients according to concomitant medications received.", 
    "121": "Anakinra patients (n = 1116) showed no difference in the incidence of upper respiratory infections or overall serious adverse events compared with placebo patients (n = 283). The anakinra group had more injection site reactions (72.6% vs 32.9% in placebo) and a small increase in serious infections (2.1% vs 0.4% in placebo). Anakinra's safety profile did not differ in patients receiving antihypertensive, antidiabetic, or statin drugs.", 
    "122": "This study indicates that anakinra has a good safety profile in patients typically seen in a rheumatology practice who are considered candidates for therapy with agents that are immunomodulatory and disease modifying. Except for injection site reactions and a nonstatistically although potentially clinically significant increase in serious infections in the anakinra versus the placebo groups, the addition of anakinra to a stable background regimen of RA medications introduced no other important safety risk in patients with RA.",

Hypercholesterolemia with statin use was associated with less risk of ICH (OR=0.30; P=0.0008) in multivariable analysis after controlling for alcohol use, hypertension, previous stroke, first-degree relative with ICH, education level, and apolipoprotein E alleles.", 
    "126": "Hypercholesterolemia was associated with a lower risk of ICH. We have not found an increased risk of ICH with the widespread use of statins in our population. Given the lack of cholesterol levels in the current study, further studies are needed to determine if lower cholesterol levels secondary to statin use bear the same risk as low cholesterol levels for ICH.", 
    "127": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase inhibitors, statins, provide beneficial effects independent of their lipid-lowering effects. One beneficial effect appears to involve acute activation of endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase (eNOS) and increased NO release. However, the mechanism of acute statin-stimulated eNOS activation is unknown. Therefore, we hypothesized that eNOS activation may be coupled to altered eNOS phosphorylation. Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs), passages 2-6, were treated with either lovastatin or pravastatin from 0 to 30 min. eNOS phosphorylation was examined by Western blot by use of phosphospecific antibodies for Ser-1179, Ser-635, Ser-617, Thr-497, and Ser-116. Statin stimulation of BAECs increased eNOS phosphorylation at Ser-1179 and Ser-617, which was blocked by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase)/Akt inhibitor wortmannin, and at Ser-635, which was blocked by the protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor KT-5720. Statin treatment of BAECs transiently increased NO release by fourfold, measured by cGMP accumulation, and was attenuated by N-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester, wortmannin, and KT-5720 but not by mevalonate. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that eNOS is acutely activated by statins independent of HMG-CoA reductase inhibition and that in addition to Ser-1179, eNOS phosphorylation at Ser-635 and Ser-617 through PKA and Akt, respectively, may explain, in part, a mechanism by which eNOS is activated in response to acute statin treatment.",

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a small amount of scarring in the anteroseptal wall, moderate left ventricular enlargement, and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 26%. Patient was started on simvastatin 20 mg daily, gradually increased to 80 mg daily, which were maintained for another 4 weeks. Twelve weeks after the initial presentation, the patient experienced a marked improvement in his symptoms. Repeat cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed global improvement in left ventricular contractility, with ejection fraction of 36% and end-diastolic volume decreasing from 230 to 153 ml. We speculate that high-dose statin therapy had a significant role in improving the ventricular function in our patient by improving the endothelial flow. This hypothesis is presently being tested in a larger prospective trial.",

The percentage of patients treated with statins increased each year (from 22.6% in 1996 to 43.8% in 2000) as did the percentage of adequately dosed patients (from 4.3% in 1996 to 23.9% in 2000). The overall cost of dispensed statins amounted to 10,610 euros in 1996 and 45,102 euros in 2000. The proportion of cost for statins accountable to adequately dosed patients ranged from 36.4% in 1996 to 77.4% in 2000.

Possible primary prevention candidates: eight guideline-based criteria were developed from the SIGN guideline. There were 85 (87%) patients with a total cholesterol concentration available on admission of whom 56 (66%) had a predicted CHD risk > or = 15% and 10 (12%) had CHD risk > or = 30%. Of those with CHD risk > or = 15% 6 (11%) had been receiving an anti-platelet agent and of those with CHD risk > or = 30% only 1 (10%) was recorded as taking a statin. Of known hypertensives with CHD risk > or = 15%, 21% (5/24) were not recorded as having received treatment. Secondary prevention candidates: a further eight guideline-based criteria were developed from the SIGN guidelines. There were 42/65 (65%) candidates for aspirin documented as receiving it.

    "138": "We are continuing to both elucidate underlying mechanisms and identify clinical applications for a chemically induced murine model of dose-controlled hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis. This murine model neither utilizes genetically modified mice nor a high-fat, cholate-containing diet, although simultaneous ingestion of a high-fat, cholate-enriched diet potentiates the hyperlipidemic response and the number and size of aortic atherosclerotic lesions formed in C57BL/6 mice. The chemical agent used to induce hyperlipidemia is poloxamer 407 (P-407), a nonionic surface-active-agent. To date, we have investigated the effect of P-407 on the biologic activity of a variety of key enzymes involved with lipid metabolism and transport. These enzymes include 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, lipoprotein lipase (LPL), cholesterol 7alpha-hydoxylase (C7alphaH), sterol 27-hydroxylase (S27H), lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), cholesteryl-ester-transfer-protein (CETP), hepatic lipase (HL), and endothelial lipase (EL). P-407 directly inhibits the heparin-releasable fraction of LPL and HL and indirectly increases the biologic activity of CETP and LCAT. Long-term (> 4 months) administration of P-407 to C57BL/6 mice appears to have no effect on the biologic activity of S27H and HMG-CoA reductase, but decreases the activity of C7alphaH. This would suggest that hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia result from inhibition of LPL and C7alphaH, respectively, while the biologic activity of CETP and LCAT are indirectly increased to compensate for the increased cholesterol burden. The above model has proven useful for predicting the therapeutic efficacy of existing and possibly newer statin drugs, as well as evaluating the potential of one statin drug (atorvastatin calcium) to cause the regression of P-407-induced atherosclerotic lesions in mice. The P-407-induced murine model of atherogenesis represents an alternative to the use of either genetically modified or diet-induced models and may also prove beneficial for the evaluation of newer classes of antihyperlipidemic agents such as antioxidants, CETP inhibitors, and liver X receptor (LXR) agonists.",

Before and after lipid-lowering therapy with simvastatin (n = 22) or pravastatin (n = 22), myocardial blood flow at rest and during dipyridamole loading was measured using positron emission tomography with [(13)N]ammonia, and myocardial vasodilatation was assessed. Treatments with simvastatin and pravastatin similarly reduced plasma total cholesterol and plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Resting myocardial blood flow was comparable in the controls, simvastatin group, and pravastatin group and unchanged after therapy. Myocardial blood flow during dipyridamole loading and myocardial vasodilatation was lower in the two therapy groups before treatment than in the controls. These parameters improved significantly after therapy with simvastatin, whereas no improvement was observed after pravastatin therapy. The per cent change in myocardial vasodilatation after simvastatin therapy was significantly and inversely correlated with per cent changes in plasma lipid fractions.",

However, in spite of the dramatic success in large randomized clinical trials, two thirds of patients administered statins are not protected against cardiovascular events. This has prompted a search for additional targets for therapy. The pandemic of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes has led to a dramatic increase in the prevalence of dyslipidemia. This, in turn, has prompted a resurgence of the search for drugs and algorithms that favorably affect high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) metabolism and function. Fibrates are the best-studied class of agents to be used as an addition to statins since they have also been proven to reduce clinical events as a monotherapy. However, there is a need for large safety trials of statin-fibrate combination therapy. Statin-niacin combination therapy has proven to be safe and effective in altering lipoprotein pattern. Randomized clinical trials and more research on the mechanism of action of niacin are necessary. Inhibitors of cholesterol ester transfer protein and HDL therapy drugs are in early developmental stages, and are the most promising potential additions to the current arsenal.", 
    "143": "Although elevated cholesterol levels have been associated with coronary heart disease, the evidence for a role of cholesterol in stroke is less well defined. Epidemiological studies indicate that high lipid levels are linked with an increase in ischemic stroke, while low lipid levels may increase the risk of hemorrhagic stroke. Lipid lowering with statins reduces the incidence of ischemic stroke without increasing the frequency of hemorrhagic stroke. The benefits of statins on stroke may be due to a combination of mechanisms. Statins lower cholesterol levels and reduce the progression of atherosclerotic plaque formation in carotid arteries, and the incidence of emboli from cardiac, aortic and carotid sites. Furthermore, statins may produce cholesterol-independent effects such as improving cerebral blood flow and reducing inflammation and oxidative stress, which could limit the size of an ischemic lesion. Statins offer potential benefits for reducing the incidence and improving the prognosis of stroke.", 
    "144": "To test the hypothesis that variations in the multidrug resistance-1 gene influence the response to statin treatment, 2 prevalent polymorphisms (G2677T/A and C3435T) were examined in 344 hypercholesterolemic patients treated with atorvastatin (10 mg). The C3435T polymorphism was significantly and independently associated with a smaller reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and with a larger increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, relative to variant allele carriers, in a gender-specific manner. Also, haplotype determination combined with these polymorphisms identified a subgroup that showed a striking response to treatment, which was not defined by a single polymorphism.", 
    "145": "Therapy with niacin (nicotinic acid) is unique in that it improves all lipoprotein abnormalities. It significantly reduces low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglyceride, and lipoprotein(a) levels, while increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. This makes niacin ideal for treating a wide variety of lipid disorders, including the metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, isolated low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and hypertriglyceridemia. Niacin-induced changes in serum lipid levels produce significant improvements in both coronary artery disease and clinical outcomes. Niacin is currently available in 3 formulations (immediate release, extended release, and long acting), which differ significantly with respect to their safety and efficacy profiles. Immediate-release niacin is generally taken 3 times a day and is associated with adverse flushing, gastrointestinal symptoms, and elevations in blood glucose levels. Long-acting niacin can be taken once daily and is associated with significantly reduced flushing, but its metabolism increases the risk of hepatotoxic effects. Extended-release niacin, also given once daily, has an absorption rate intermediate between the other formulations and is associated with fewer flushing and gastrointestinal symptoms without increasing hepatotoxic risk.",

Serial echocardiograms were performed to measure LV function. Myocardial apoptosis, eNOS, and capillary density were measured at 6 weeks. Cardiomyopathic hamsters had lower LV shortening fraction (SF) compared with controls (17 +/- 3% vs 59 +/- 2%), higher LV end-diastolic volume (30 +/- 3 vs 6 +/- 2 mL/m2), and lower LV mass/volume ratio (0.5 +/- 0.04 vs 0.72 +/- 0.02 mg/ml, P < 0.001). During follow-up, SF decreased (9 +/- 2%) and LV volume increased (38 +/- 1 mL/m2) in untreated hamsters (P < 0.05 from baseline) but did not change significantly in the Sim group (P < 0.05 vs untreated). Myocardial caspase-3 activity was higher and apoptotic nuclear density was lower in Sim compared with untreated CM hamsters (0.072 +/- 0.02% vs 0.107 +/- 0.03%, P < 0.01). Myocardial capillary density was highest in the Sim group (P < 0.05). eNOS expression was not different between groups. Sim retards the progression of HF in CM hamsters. This may be related to an increase in coronary microvasculature, increase in NO availability, and decreased apoptosis."
