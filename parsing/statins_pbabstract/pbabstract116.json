In particular, the benefit of these drugs in type 2 diabetes (T2D) is well established. In February 2012, the Food and Drug Administration released changes to statin safety label to include that statins have been associated with increases in hemoglobin A1C and fasting serum glucose levels. This has stirred much debate in the medical community. Estimate for new onset diabetes from statin treatment is approximately one in 255 patients over four years. The number needed to treat for statin benefit is estimated at one in 40 depending on the population. The mechanism of this link remains unknown. Statins may accelerate progression to diabetes via molecular mechanisms that impact insulin resistance and cellular metabolism of carbohydrates. It remains clear that the benefit of statin therapy outweighs the risk of developing diabetes.", 
    "1": "CHD morbidity and mortality rates have more than halved since their peak in the 1960s and 1970s. This trend is a result of many factors; however, primary prevention provides the bulk of this benefit. Despite this tremendous progress, cardiovascular disease remains the major cause of death and this trend is projected to persist given the continuous growth in those aged 65\u00a0years or greater. Although statin therapy has been a main contributor to a primary prevention strategy, there is still controversy about exposing a large healthy population to long-term statin therapy. Advocates contend the mortality benefits from an aggressive statin approach would remove heart disease from its perch as the greatest killer of Americans and stroke mortality would drop from third to fifth place. Those advocating a much more conservative approach contend the data are not available to expose a healthy population to lifelong statin therapy given limited data on mortality, potential adverse events, and considerable costs. Given these opposing views, this summary of the evolution of statin therapy for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease will review the major factors fueling this debate.", 
    "2": "Large randomized trials have shown that lowering the concentration of LDL cholesterol with statins reduces vascular morbidity and mortality rapidly, with further benefit emerging during each year of treatment allocation. But, limited evidence is available about the long-term efficacy and safety of statin treatment. Long-term follow-up of surviving trial participants allows direct assessment of the benefits (and any hazards) of a sustained reduction in LDL cholesterol concentration during the post-trial period. Post-trial follow-up of several large statin trials (of which the Heart Protection Study was the largest) confirms that the substantial absolute benefits and cost-effectiveness of statin therapy were, in fact, underestimated in previous analyses restricted to the \"in-trial\" periods of randomized studies. Reassuringly, no adverse effects on cancer incidence or non-vascular mortality emerged during the extended follow-up of the Heart Protection Study. These findings support the prompt initiation and long-term continuation of statin therapy in individuals at increased vascular risk.", 
    "3": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major cardiovascular (CV) risk factor. General Framingham Risk Profile (GFRP) and World Health Organization/International Society of Hypertension (WHO/ISH) charts were used to assess CV risk in DM in Oman. The GFRP identified more patients with medium-risk DM; GFRP and WHO/ISH identified essentially equal numbers at very high risk. These were then used to evaluate statin usage in Oman, including economics. Google lists innumerable tools from organizations, hospitals, practitioners, magazines, societies, clinics, and medical associations. The GFRP and WHO/ISH calculations provided useful DM assessment of populations in Oman. Other major risk models are Adult Treatment Panel III, based on Framingham, and Reynolds Risk Score; the latter incorporates other factors such as family history, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and hemoglobin A(1c) (in DM). These models are useful in assessing specific populations. Individual practitioners with limited time may just evaluate patients as low, medium, and high CV risk based on general knowledge and then treat.", 
    "4": "Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a set of metabolic alterations including high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), which increase the risk of cardiomyopathy often leading to surgery. Despite inducing myopathy, statins are widely used to lower LDL. Cardiopulmonary bypass (Cpb) causes oxidative stress and metabolic injury, altering mitochondrial expression (Grp75) and endoplasmic reticulum (Grp78) chaperones, apoptotic enzymes (Bcl2 family) and increasing cardiomyocyte lipid/lipofuscin storage. We believe that cardiomyocytes from patients with MetS may be more sensitive to surgical stress, in particular after simvastatin therapy (MetS+Stat). The study group included ten patients with MetS, ten patients with Mets+Stat and ten healthy subjects. Myocardial biopsies were obtained both before and after-Cpb. Grp75, Grp78, Bax, Bcl2, lipids, lipofuscin and fibrosis were evaluated by immuno/histochemistry. MetS cardiomyocytes had higher Grp75, Bax, fibrosis and lipofuscin. MetS+Stat had lower Grp75 and higher Grp78 expressions, high Bax, fewer fibrosis and higher lipofuscin content. Cpb did not vary the fibrosis and lipids/lipofuscin content, although it influenced the chaperones and Bax expression in all groups. These changes were more profound in patients with MetS and even more so in patients with MetS+Stat. The results suggest that MetS and MetS+Stat cardiomyocytes were more highly stressed after-Cpb. Interestingly, simvastatin caused high stress even before-Cpb.", 
    "5": "Vasospasm plays a major role in the morbidity and mortality after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). The preliminary studies suggest that statins protect against cerebral vasospasm.", 
    "6": "The aim of the study was to determine the role of simvastatin in preventing clinical vasospasm and improving functional outcome in patients with aSAH.", 
    "7": "All patients with aSAH admitted within 96 h of ictus were randomized to receive either Simvastatin or placebo - 80 mg/day for 14 days. Thirty eight patients were recruited in the study- 19 received Simvastatin and 19 placebo. All the patients underwent surgical clipping of the aneurysm. The primary outcome of the study was the development of clinical cerebral vasospasm. The secondary outcomes included Glasgow Outcome Score (GOS), Modified Rankin Scale (MRS) and Barthel Index Score (MBI) at follow-up at 1, 3 and 6 months.", 
    "8": "16% of the patients in the simvastatin group had high Middle Cerebral Artery velocities (> 160 cm/sec) on transcranial Doppler on one or more than one day during the study duration as compared to 26% of the patients in the placebo group (p = 0.70). Neurological deterioration occurred in 26% and 42% of the patients in simvastatin group versus placebo group, respectively (p = 0.31). There was an improvement in the functional outcome in the simvastatin group at 1, 3 or 6 months in the follow-up; however, this difference was not statistically significant.", 
    "9": "There was benefit of simvastatin in terms of reduction in clinical vasospasm, mortality or improved functional outcome, however, this was not statistically significant.", 
    "10": "To examine the prevalence of systemic and ocular disease among choroideremia patients and carriers.", 
    "11": "A cross-sectional analysis was performed on responses from affected males with choroideremia, female carriers, and unaffected brothers to an Internet-based survey made available from September 2009 to November 2010. Affected males were classified into two groups, those with or without functional vision. Carrier females were classified into those with and without symptoms. Comparisons were made between these groups.", 
    "12": "There was a higher prevalence of dry eye in our respondents than the North American population. The prevalence of dry eye, cataract, hypertension, diabetes, psychological problems and hypercholesterolemia were higher in choroideremia males without functional vision compared to those with functional vision. Likewise, statin intake was more prevalent among the affected males without functional vision than those with functional vision. After age adjustment, any differences between the two subgroups of male patients (with and without functional vision) were not significant.", 
    "13": "Age plays an important role in determining the onset of severe visual impairment with loss of functional vision in male subjects affected by choroideremia. Although Internet surveys have limitations such as the use of self-reported diagnoses and the possibility that the responses may not be representative of the population as a whole, this study shows that such surveys can provide data quickly and easily, and for rare diseases such as choroideremia, with relatively large numbers of responses.", 
    "14": "We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of administering a daily \"polypill\" consisting of three antihypertensive drugs, a statin, and aspirin to prevent cardiovascular disease among high-risk patients in Latin America. We found that the lifetime risk of cardiovascular disease could be reduced by 15 percent in women and by 21 percent in men if the polypill were used by people with a risk of cardiovascular disease equal to or greater than 15 percent over ten years. Attaining this goal would require treating 26 percent of the population at a cost of $34-$36 per quality-adjusted life-year. Offering the polypill to women at high risk and to men age fifty-five or older would be the best approach and would yield acceptable incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. The polypill would be very cost-effective even in the country with the lowest gross national income in our study. However, policy makers must weigh the value of intervention with the polypill against other interventions, as well as their country's willingness and ability to pay for the intervention.", 
    "15": "Organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATP) 1B1, 1B3, and 2B1 can serve as the loci of drug-drug interactions (DDIs). In the present work, the cynomolgus monkey was evaluated as a potential model for studying OATP-mediated DDIs. Three cynomolgus monkey OATPs (cOATPs), with a high degree of amino acid sequence identity (91.9, 93.5, and 96.6% for OATP1B1, 1B3, and 2B1, respectively) to their human counterparts, were cloned, expressed, and characterized. The cOATPs were stably transfected in human embryonic kidney cells and were functionally similar to the corresponding human OATPs (hOATPs), as evident from the similar uptake rate of typical substrates (estradiol-17\u03b2-d-glucuronide, cholecystokinin octapeptide, and estrone-3-sulfate). Moreover, six known hOATP inhibitors exhibited similar IC(50) values against cOATPs. To further evaluate the appropriateness of the cynomolgus monkey as a model, a known hOATP substrate [rosuvastatin (RSV)]-inhibitor [rifampicin (RIF)] pair was examined in vitro; the monkey-derived parameters (RSV K(m) and RIF IC(50)) were similar (within 3.5-fold) to those obtained with hOATPs and human primary hepatocytes. In vivo, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve of RSV (3 mg/kg, oral) given 1 hour after a single RIF dose (15 mg/kg, oral) was increased 2.9-fold in cynomolgus monkeys, consistent with the value (3.0-fold) reported in humans. A number of in vitro-in vivo extrapolation approaches, considering the fraction of the pathways affected and free versus total inhibitor concentrations, were also explored. It is concluded that the cynomolgus monkey has the potential to serve as a useful model for the assessment of OATP-mediated DDIs in a nonclinical setting.", 
    "16": "Systemic administration of anti-PCSK9 antibodies induces dramatic reductions in LDL-cholesterol levels, and the effect of this therapy on LDL-receptor activity seems to be additive to that of statin therapy. Inhibition of PCSK9 is potentially very important to the clinician, and should enable more patients to achieve their LDL-cholesterol-level goal.", 
    "17": "Statins have been shown to increase the level of circulating progenitor cells in peripheral blood supposedly due to a mobilization of progenitor cells from the bone marrow niche. Osteoclast/osteoblast interaction has been associated with progenitor cell mobilization. Here, we investigated the role of statins on progenitor cell mobilization with a focus on bone metabolism.", 
    "18": "FGF2(-/-) and wild type (wt) mice were treated with atorvastatin or placebo. In contrast to wt mice, the number of sca-1/flk-1 positive progenitor cells in peripheral blood (PB) of atorvastatin treated FGF2(-/-) mice did not increase, and was accompanied by a defective reendothelialization after perielectric injury of the common carotid artery. In wt, but not FGF2(-/-) mice, statin treatment was associated with increased levels of receptor activator of NF-\u03baB ligand (RANKL) in bone marrow (BM) supernatant. Treatment with recombinant RANKL increased sca-1/flk-1 positive progenitors in FGF2(-/-) mice. Interestingly, osteoclast activation was not altered. To measure the egress of sca-1/flk-1 positive progenitor cells from the bone marrow, we performed in-situ perfusion experiments of isolated hind limbs. Mobilization was not significantly affected by atorvastatin in both wt and FGF2(-/-) mice. Furthermore, RANK - the specific receptor to RANKL - is expressed on progenitor cells, and RANKL stimulation increases cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo.", 
    "19": "Atorvastatin treatment increases RANKL levels with no measurable effect on bone metabolism and mobilization of progenitor cells from BM to PB. RANKL is essential for the statin-mediated increase of progenitor cell levels but predominantly due to a RANKL-induced stimulation of cell proliferation.", 
    "20": "Ischemia/reperfusion injury of a transplanted heart may result in serious early and late adverse effects such as primary graft dysfunction, increased allograft immunogenicity, and initiation of fibroproliferative cascades that compromise the survival of the recipient. Microvascular dysfunction has a central role in ischemia/reperfusion injury through increased vascular permeability, leukocyte adhesion and extravasation, thrombosis, vasoconstriction, and the no-reflow phenomenon. Here we review the involvement of microvascular endothelial cells and their surrounding pericytes in ischemia/reperfusion injury, and the pleiotropic, cholesterol-independent effects of statins on microvascular dysfunction. In addition, we delineate how the rapid vasculoprotective effects of statins could be used to protect cardiac allografts against ischemia/reperfusion injury by administering statins to the organ donor before graft removal and transplantation.", 
    "21": "Statins, which are inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and inhibit endogenous cholesterol synthesis, possess pleiotropic activities, such as anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative and antifibrotic effects. Here, we investigated whether statins ameliorate steatohepatitis using a high-fat and high-cholesterol (HFHC) diet-induced rat model.", 
    "22": "Eight-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed control chow or HFHC diet. Half of the HFHC diet-fed rats were orally administered 2 mg/kg/day rosuvastatin for 12 weeks. Hepatic injury, steatosis, fibrosis and markers of lipid peroxidation/oxidant stress were evaluated.", 
    "23": "As previously reported, HFHC diet induced steatohepatitis in rat livers with hypercholesterolaemia. Rosuvastatin decreased Oil Red O stained-positive areas, liver/body weight ratio, serum total cholesterol levels and hepatic free fatty acid contents in HFHC diet-fed rats. Further study revealed that rosuvastatin significantly decreased hepatic mRNA expression of tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 and interleukin-6, serum alanine aminotransferase levels and hepatic lobular inflammation grade. Hepatic fibrosis was also ameliorated by rosuvastatin with decreases in hepatic mRNA expression of transforming growth factor-\u03b2, connective tissue growth factor and type-1 procollagen. Similarly, hepatic Sirius red stained or \u03b1-smooth muscle actin stained-positive areas and expression of markers of lipid peroxidation/oxidant stress [hepatic 8-hydroxy-oxyguanosine and hepatic 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal] were decreased. Interestingly, whereas the expression of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 and long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase was not affected, that of catalase and acyl-coA oxidase was restored.",

    "27": "Non-hospitalized CAD patients are usually followed in general practice. There is a need for identify biomarkers which could help to foresee the prognoses of these patients. Elevated serum YKL-40 is a short-term predictor for myocardial infarction, cardiovascular mortality and all-cause mortality in patients with stable CAD.",

At follow-up from 2004 to 2005, 144 (77%) of 187 patients were clinically examined. Self-assessment information about memory problems, anxiety, depression, sleeping problems, education and employment was compared with answers from standardized questionnaires from 167 controls. Functional outcome was measured by the modified Rankin Scale (mRS).",

The combination of ezetimibe and a statin has been the focus of a number of recent studies, given initial data showing a substantial reduction in low- density lipoprotein with the addition of ezetimibe. However, it is unclear how this low-density lipoprotein reduction impacts cardiovascular disease outcomes. This review will briefly discuss the burden of cardiovascular disease and the pathophysiology of dyslipidemia in chronic kidney disease patients. It will then assess the data regarding the impact of adding ezetimibe to a statin on the general population, and specifically predialysis chronic kidney disease patients.",

    "37": "Epicatechin and cocoa metabolites caused an increase in ApoAI expression in HepG2 cells. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays revealed the involvement of Sites A and B of the ApoAI promoter in the induction of ApoAI mRNA upon incubation with cocoa metabolites. Using supershift assays, we demonstrated the binding of HNF-3\u03b2, HNF-4, ER-\u03b1, and RXR-\u03b1 to Site A and the binding of HNF-3\u03b2, NFY, and Sp1 to Site B. Luciferase assays performed with a construct containing Site B confirmed its role in the upregulation of ApoAI by cocoa metabolites. Incubation with 3-methyl-epicatechin led to an increase in HNF-3\u03b2 mRNA, HNF-3\u03b2, ER-\u03b1, Sp1, and NFY protein levels and the activation of ApoAI transcription mediated by NFY, Sp1, and ER-\u03b1.",

    "39": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease that mainly affects young women, a group usually free of atherosclerosis. As treatment for SLE has improved during recent years and long term survival increased, it has become clear that patients with SLE have increased morbidity and mortality from atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Several imaging techniques showed increased prevalence of premature atherosclerosis which was most striking in young patients with SLE. Pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is an inflammatory process. Inflammatory cells and mediators play a key role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Systemic inflammation and immune dysfunction are thought to accelerate atherosclerosis in patients with SLE as well. Several possible reasons for accelerated atherosclerosis in SLE have been suggested. Traditional coronary risk factors, other coronary risk factors including lipoprotein (a), CRP, homocysteine, inflammatory cytokines, increased vascular damage, lupus related factors and medications may affect the development of atherosclerosis in SLE. Atherosclerosis risk assessment, preventive strategy for accelerated atherosclerosis and its treatment would be required in patients with SLE.", 
    "40": "Microparticles formulated from poly (D,L-lactic-co-glycolide) (PLGA), a biodegradable polymer, have been investigated extensively as a drug delivery system. In this study, solid tiny PLGA microspheres were fabricated using the electrospraying method. PLGA polymer was dissolved in dichloromethane (DCM), and the solution was electrosprayed. The electrospraying conditions were adjusted so that the stream ejected from the needle was divided into spheres instead of continuous fibers or irregular-shaped particles. Several experiments were carried out using the PLGA-DCM source solution with different amounts of simvastatin (SIM), a drug that enhances bone regeneration, to understand this drug delivery system. The surface morphology and microstructure of the microspheres formed were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, and differential scanning calorimetry. The in vitro experiments on drug loading and drug release behavior of the microspheres suggested a drug encapsulation efficacy >90%. The drug was continuously released from the microspheres for >3 weeks. Other experiments, such as MTT, cell attachment and proliferation and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction showed good biocompatibility of the electrosprayed PLGA microspheres, which increased in the presence of SIM. Thus, electrosprayed PLGA microspheres have potential as a drug delivery system and application in bone tissue engineering.", 
    "41": "Statins, inhibitors of the enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, are known not only as cholesterol-lowering agents but also as anti-inflammatory mediators. However, their regulatory effect on intestinal mucosal immunity remains unclear. The present study examined the possible direct effects of statin on intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs), the front line cells of the intestinal mucosal immune system. Murine IELs were isolated from the small intestines of C57BL/6 mice. IELs activated with anti-CD3/CD28 monoclonal antibodies produced interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-2, and IL-4 in significant numbers; however, they did not produce IL-5. Both simvastatin and lovastatin suppressed IEL production of IFN-\u03b3, TNF-\u03b1, IL-2, and IL-4 in a dose-dependent manner, whereas 48-h treatment with high concentrations (5 \u00d7 10(-5)M) of simvastatin and lovastatin did not affect the number of IELs. The suppressive effect of the simvastatin was significantly restored by the addition of mevalonate, farnesyl pyrophosphate ammonium salt, and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate ammonium salt, which are downstream metabolites of HMG-CoA. These findings suggest that statins have direct suppressive effects on the production of T helper 1-cytokines and IL-4 in IELs; these effects are associated with inhibition of the mevalonate pathway to some extent.", 
    "42": "Our objective was to assess the number of patients with an indication for lipid-lowering therapy according to their non-HDL cholesterol (N-HDL-C) (>130\u00a0mg/dL) concentrations despite on-target LDL (\u2264100\u00a0mg/dL) values determined using ultracentrifugation (UC) or direct enzymatic methods (DM).",

The percentage of patients with an N-HDL-C concentration above the recommended level, despite having an LDL concentration that was on target, also increased significantly across the TG tertiles (3.1%, 15.6% and 57.%, respectively; p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Of the patients with a TG level above 400\u00a0mg/dL and an LDL concentration that was on target, 86% had an N-HDL-C concentration above 130\u00a0mg/dL. Of the patients with a TG level above 400 and an N-HDL-C concentration qualifying for therapy, 40% had an LDL concentration that was on target. The ApoB concentration had a stronger concordance with the LDL concentration than N-HDL-C.", 
    "45": "Using the N-HDL-C concentration as a therapeutic target in hypertriglyceridemic patients almost doubled the number of patients requiring treatment. The ApoB concentration had a better association with LDL when determining the need for lipid-lowering therapy.", 
    "46": "The ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCG2 can actively extrude a broad range of endogenous and exogenous substrates across biological membranes. Thereby, ABCG2 limits oral drug bioavailability, mediates hepatobiliary and renal excretion and participates functionally in the blood-brain barrier.", 
    "47": "The paper provides a review of the clinical evidence of the role of ABCG2 in the bioavailability and brain disposition of drugs. It also sheds light on the value of experimental/preclinical data in predicting the role of ABCG2 in pharmacokinetics in humans.", 
    "48": "Experimental studies indicate that ABCG2 may limit the oral bioavailability and brain penetration of many drugs. ABCG2 has also been recognized as an important determinant of the disposition of some drugs in humans. For example, loss-of-function variants of ABCG2 affect the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rosuvastatin in a clinically significant manner. Moreover, clinically relevant pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions have been attributed to ABCG2 inhibition. However, examples from human studies are still rare compared with the overwhelming evidence from experimental studies. The large degree of functional redundancy of ABCG2 with other transporters such as P-glycoprotein may explain the rare occurrence of ABCG2-dependent drug-drug interactions in humans. Providing clinicians with consolidated information on the clinically relevant interactions of drugs with ABCG2 remains a matter of future exploration.",

Patients were randomly selected to receive 20 mg of rosuvastatin or placebo for 10 days. The main goal was to determine the effect of rosuvastatin on plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-10 after 72 hours of TBI. Amnesia, disorientation, and disability were assessed 3 and 6 months after TBI.",

The best-fit mixed model showed a significant effect of rosuvastatin on the reduction of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 levels (p = 0.004). Rosuvastatin treatment did not appear to affect the levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-10.

We now address the issue, focusing on the temporal changes having occurred: most patients in recent RCTs are no longer n-3 deficient and the vast majority are now treated with statins. Recent RCTs testing n-3 against arrhythmias suggest that n-3 reduce the risk only in patients not taking a statin. Other recent RCTs in secondary prevention were negative although, in a post-hoc analysis separating statin users and non-users, non-significant protection of n-3 was observed among statin non-users whereas statin users had no effect. Recent RCTs testing statins - after the implementation of the New Clinical Trial Regulation in 2007 - are negative (or flawed) suggesting that the lack of effect of n-3 cannot be attributed to a parallel protection by statins. Finally, statins favor the metabolism of omega-6 fatty acids (n-6), which in turn inhibits n-3 and, contrary to n-3, they increase insulin resistance and the risk of diabetes. Thus, n-3 and statins are counteractive at several levels and statins appear to inhibit n-3.",

Despite all efforts efficacy of a specific compound has not been proven, so far. In consequence, recommendations for a use of vitamins or other supplements with the intention of prostate cancer prevention should be avoided today. In contrast, there is some evidence that life style modification might be helpful: recent investigations suggest that smoking may be involved in prostate cancer carcinogenesis. In addition, there is evidence that moderate food consumption, reduction of dairy products and an Asian or Mediterranean diet might not only prevent prostate cancer but also harbors additional beneficial effects on general health. This move from single compounds to more complex diets can be considered as a change of paradigm in prostate cancer prevention and could be the starting point of future epidemiological research. Disappointing findings with regards to nutritional cancer prevention contrast with a solid evidence concerning the efficacy of chemoprevention using 5a-reductase inhibitors: Long-term use of Finasteride and Dutasteride significantly reduces prostate cancer detection. Further candidate drugs are under investigation. However, translation of these findings into urological practice remains a matter of controversial discussion.", 
    "70": "Circulating blood CD34(+) cells consist of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells, angiogenic cells, and endothelial cells. In addition to their clinical use in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, CD34(+) cells may also promote therapeutic neovascularization. Therefore, understanding the factors that influence circulating CD34(+) cell frequency has wide implications for vascular biology in addition to stem cell transplantation. In the present study, we examined the clinical and genetic characteristics associated with circulating CD34(+) cell frequency in a large, community-based sample of 1786 Framingham Heart Study participants.Among subjects without cardiovascular disease (n = 1595), CD34(+) frequency was inversely related to older age, female sex, and smoking. CD34(+) frequency was positively related to weight, serum total cholesterol, and statin therapy. Clinical covariates accounted for 6.3% of CD34(+) variability. CD34(+) frequency was highly heritable (h(2) = 54%; P < .0001). Genome-wide association analysis of CD34(+) frequency identified suggestive associations at several loci, including OR4C12 (chromosome 11; P = 6.7 \u00d7 10(-7)) and ENO1 and RERE (chromosome 1; P = 8.8 \u00d7 10(-7)). CD34(+) cell frequency is reduced in older subjects and is influenced by environmental factors including smoking and statin use. CD34(+) frequency is highly heritable.

    "80": "Low density lipoproteins (LDL) and high density lipoproteins (HDL) are independent risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD); decreasing LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels with statin therapy represents the primary goal in the management of cardiovascular disease. However, despite the efficacy of statins in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, a significant residual risk has been observed even after reaching the LDL-C target, suggesting that other risk factors beyond LDL-C should be addressed, including low levels of HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C). Several clinical trials have shown an inverse relationship between HDL-C levels and cardiovascular risk, and 1 mg/dl increment in HDL-C is associated in epidemiological studies with a 2-3% decrease in cardiovascular risk, suggesting that raising HDL-C levels might have beneficial effects to reduce cardiovascular disease. However, several lines of evidence indicate that the functional properties of HDL may be relevant as well. In patient with CAD and normal HDL-C levels, HDL exhibit significantly reduced protective functions, and rather appear to be pro-atherogenic; on the other hand some genetic mutations causing low levels of HDL-C are not associated with increased atherosclerosis. Furthermore, although niacin significantly increased HDL-C levels, no further clinical benefit was observed from the addition of niacin to statin therapy, suggesting that increasing HDL-C levels is not sufficient and perhaps functional properties of HDL must be considered when choosing a therapeutic strategy to reduce the residual cardiovascular risk.",

However, few investigations have been able to study this relationship prospectively and in well-controlled settings. Moreover, no studies have determined whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that influence ALA metabolism are associated with this common cancer. The purpose of this study was to explore associations between prostatic levels of ALA, SNPs and prostate cancer-specific biomarkers in samples collected from a previous randomized clinical trial conducted using a presurgical model and which tested the effects of flaxseed supplementation, a rich source of ALA, prior to prostatectomy (n\u200a=\u200a134). Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) was determined and immunohistochemistry was used to assess tumor proliferation rate (Ki67). Prostatic ALA was determined with gas chromatography. Seven previously identified SNPs associated with delta-6 desaturase activity (rs99780, rs174537, rs174545, rs174572, rs498793, rs3834458 and rs968567) were tested for associations with prostatic ALA, PSA and Ki67. Despite consuming seven times more ALA per day, men in the flaxseed arm had similar amounts of prostatic ALA relative to men not consuming flaxseed. In unadjusted analysis, there were significant positive associations between prostatic ALA and PSA (\u03c1\u200a=\u200a0.191, p\u200a=\u200a0.028) and Ki67 (\u03c1\u200a=\u200a0.186, p\u200a=\u200a0.037). After adjusting for covariates (flaxseed, age, race, BMI and statin-use) the association between ALA and PSA remained (p\u200a=\u200a0.004) but was slightly attenuated for Ki67 (p\u200a=\u200a0.051). We did not observe associations between any of the SNPs studied and prostatic ALA; however, in models for PSA there was a significant interaction between rs498793 and ALA and for Ki67 there were significant interactions with ALA and rs99780 and rs174545. Independent and inverse associations were observed between rs174572 and Ki67. This study provides evidence that prostatic ALA, independent of the amount of ALA consumed, is positively associated with biomarkers of aggressive prostate cancer and that genetic variation may modify this relationship.",

Visit-to-visit variability in blood pressure (standard deviation) was determined using a minimum of five measurements over 1 year; an inception cohort of 4819 subjects had subsequent in-trial 3 years follow-up; longer-term follow-up (mean 7.1 years) was available for 1808 subjects. Higher systolic blood pressure variability independently predicted long-term follow-up vascular and total mortality (hazard ratio per 5 mmHg increase in standard deviation of systolic blood pressure\u200a=\u200a1.2, 95% confidence interval 1.1-1.4; hazard ratio 1.1, 95% confidence interval 1.1-1.2, respectively).

Pulse pressure variability was associated with increased stroke risk (hazard ratio 1.2, 95% confidence interval 1.0-1.4 for each 5 mmHg increase), vascular mortality (hazard ratio 1.2, 95% confidence interval 1.0-1.3) and total mortality (hazard ratio 1.1, 95% confidence interval 1.0-1.2), all in long-term follow-up. All associations were independent of respective mean blood pressure levels, age, gender, in-trial treatment group (pravastatin or placebo) and prior vascular disease and cardiovascular disease risk factors.

Their role as physiological regulators under in vivo conditions is controversial, however. In the present work, we utilized a previously described mouse model with overexpressed human sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1). The levels of 27OH were increased about 12-fold in the brain. The brain levels of HMG-CoA reductase mRNA and HMG-CoA synthase mRNA levels were increased. In accordance with increased cholesterol synthesis, most of the cholesterol precursors were also increased. The level of 24OH, the dominating oxysterol in the brain, was decreased by about 25%, most probably due to increased metabolism by CYP27A1. The LXR target genes were unaffected or slightly changed in a direction opposite to that expected for LXR activation. In the brain of Cyp27(-/-) mice, cholesterol synthesis was slightly increased, with increased levels of cholesterol precursors but normal mRNA levels of HMG-CoA reductase and HMG-CoA synthase. The mRNA levels corresponding to LXR target genes were not affected. The results are consistent with the possibility that both 24OH and 27OH are physiological suppressors of cholesterol synthesis in the brain. The results do not support the contention that 27OH is a general activator of LXR target genes in this organ.",

Independent of their lipid lowering effect, statins have been shown to down-regulate inflammatory mediators and endothelial adhesion molecules, reduce tissue factor expression and restore nitric oxide bioavailability.

The promising results obtained in vivo and in epidemiological studies are generally not in accordance with those of placebo-controlled randomized clinical trials.

One week later, the same sites were subjected to induction of experimental periodontitis by three injections (i.e. one injection administered every other day for five\u00a0d) of 0.01\u00a0mg of Escherichia coli endotoxin [lipopolysaccharide (LPS)] in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) or PBS alone. After an additional week, the rats were killed, the palates were harvested and interproximal bone volume and adjacent thickness were calculated using microcomputed tomography. Subsequently, specimens were decalcified, and interproximal histologic sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin for evaluation of alveolar crest osteoclasts and surrounding inflammation.

While LPS caused a significant loss in bone thickness over the palatal roots (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.04), the injection protocol (PBS) also caused a significant loss of palatal bone thickness (p\u00a0\u2264\u00a00.03). However, prophylactic SIM-ALN-CD injections resulted in no further loss of bone thickness during experimental periodontitis.

Among these, statins might cause a disruption of a number of regulatory pathways including insulin signaling. This may affect insulin sensitivity, pancreatic beta-cell function and adipokine secretion. The statin-associated risk of new-onset diabetes (NOD) appears to be a dose-dependent class effect. It still remains unclear whether statin treatment is associated with increased risk of NOD in the general population or if there are groups of individuals at particular risk. However, according to the available data it seems that cardiovascular (CV) benefits in high-risk individuals strongly favor statin therapy since it outweighs other risks. Whether statins should be used for primary prevention among patients with a relatively low baseline CV risk is still questionable, however the results of primary prevention trials have shown reductions in mortality in this population. Thus, there is a need for randomized, placebo-controlled statin studies with carefully selected groups of patients and NOD as a key end point in order to resolve queries concerning this issue.",

Pressure force is an important mechanism contributing to induction and progression of tubulointerstitial fibrogenesis in ureteric obstruction. In this study, we investigated the influence of rosuvastatin on pressure-induced fibrotic responses in rat renal tubular cells (NRK-52E). We established an in vitro pressure culture system to study pressure-induced fibrotic responses in NRK-52E cells. When NRK-52E cells were cultured in the pressure culture system, 60 mm Hg of pressure induced the expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2, fibronectin, Smad3, and phospho-Smad3. Rosuvastatin significantly reduced these pressure-induced fibrotic responses at concentrations above 10 \u03bcM. Rosuvastatin also reduced the TGF-\u03b2-induced expression of fibronectin and CTGF in NRK-52E cells. Pretreatment with rosuvastatin significantly induced prostacyclin (PGI(2)) generation, but reduced pressure-induced prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)). PGI(2) synthase small interfering RNA (siRNA) transfection significantly inhibited rosuvastatin-induced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1 activation. The blockage of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1 by siRNA transfection reduced the inhibitory effect of rosuvastatin on pressure-induced fibrotic responses. N-[2-(cyclohexyloxy)-4-nitrophenyl]-methanesulfonamide (NS398), a specific inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2, diminished pressure-induced PGE(2) generation, and also reduced pressure-induced fibrotic responses. Additionally, PGE(2) decreased the antifibrotic effect of rosuvastatin. In conclusion, rosuvastatin reduces pressure-induced fibrotic responses in renal tubular cells by enhancing the PGI(2)-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor \u03b1 pathway and reducing PGE(2) generation.",

Plasma HDL subclasses were measured in 85 patients with established CHD and quantified by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. In CHD patients with statin treatment, the mean value of total cholesterol (TC) reached the desirable level and the triacylglycerol level (TAG) was borderline high. Moreover, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), apolipoproteinA-I, and apolipoproteinB-100 levels in these patients resembled those in normolipidemic healthy subjects. The HDL subclass did not show a normal distribution and was characterized by the lower large-sized HDL(2b) contents and higher contents of small-sized pre\u03b2\u2081-HDL in CHD patients, compared to those in normolipidemic control subjects. Multiple stepwise regression analysis revealed that the severity of coronary stenosis, determined by the Gensini Score, was significantly and independently predicted by HDL(2b) and HDL(3b). Statin therapy was effective in modifying plasma lipids levels, but not adequate as a monotherapy to normalize the HDL subclass distribution phenotype of patients with CHD undergoing PCI. The HDL subclass distribution may aid in risk stratification, especially in patients with CHD and therapeutic LDL-C and HDL-C levels.",

Health care claims from large, employer-based and Medicare insurance databases for 2000 to 2010 were used. To minimize healthy user bias, patients were identified who underwent nonemergent CABG who either newly initiated a statin <20 days before surgery or were unexposed for \u2265200 days before CABG. AKI was identified <15 days after CABG. Multivariate-adjusted risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using Poisson regression. Analyses were repeated using propensity score methods adjusted for clinical and health care utilization variables. A total of 17,077 CABG patients were identified. Post-CABG AKI developed in 3.4% of statin initiators and 6.2% of noninitiators. After adjustment, a protective effect of statin initiation on AKI was observed (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.96). This effect differed by age, with an RR of 0.91 (95% CI 0.68 to 1.20) for patients aged \u226565 years and an RR of 0.62 (95% CI 0.45 to 0.86) for those aged <65 years, although AKI was more common in the older group (7.7% vs 4.0%). In conclusion, statin initiation immediately before CABG may modestly reduce the risk for postoperative AKI, particularly in younger CABG patients.",

This study examines whether the incidence of eCD observed 24hr after asymptomatic CEA varies as a function of statin type or dose. Patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis scheduled for CEA consented to participate in an observational IRB-approved study (N=324). Patients were evaluated with an extensive battery of neuropsychometric tests pre-operatively and 24hr post-operatively. Of the 324 consented patients, 200 were taking statins. Patients taking pravastatin and fluvastatin exhibited no eCD, while patients taking lovastatin (17.7%) and rosuvastatin (16.7%) exhibited incidences of eCD similar to those not taking statins (20.2%). Patients taking simvastatin exhibited a significantly lower incidence of eCD than those taking atorvastatin (3.0% vs. 16.0%, P=0.005). Patients taking a maximal dose of any statin exhibited a significantly lower incidence of eCD than patients taking sub-maximal doses (2.7% vs. 15.9%, P=0.002). These observations suggest that the incidence of eCD may in fact vary as a function of statin type and that maximal doses may be the optimal dose for patients undergoing CEA. This variation may be due to the physico-chemical properties of statins such as lipophilicity, molecular size, and blood brain barrier penetrability. These findings should be used to inspire randomized prospective work to determine the safety, feasibility, and outcomes of optimizing statin use prior to CEA.", 
    "157": "Over the last four decades, cardiac transplantation has become the preferred therapy for select patients with end-stage heart disease. Critical to the success of heart transplantation are the continual investigational efforts to optimize immunosuppressive regimens. One of the major advances over the past few decades has been the use of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (commonly referred to as statins) to reduce the risk of rejection and allograft vasculopathy in heart transplant recipients. This chapter will focus on the advances of statin therapy in the management of heart transplant recipients. Statins are widely used for the primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and the benefit is derived not only from lipid lowering, but also through the pleiotropic, cholesterol-independent effects, which include vasculoprotective, antiinflammatory, and immunosuppressive properties. Statin therapy administered to patients after heart transplantation results in a decrease in rejection, cardiac allograft vasculopathy, and an increase in short- and long-term survival. Statins can be considered a feat of translational medicine, where the mechanistic analysis of potential benefit has been realized in an improvement in the quality and quantity of life of heart transplant recipients.", 
    "158": "Rett syndrome (RTT), an X-linked neurological disorder caused by mutations in MECP2, may have a metabolic component. We reported a genetic suppressor screen in a Mecp2-null mouse model to identify pathways for therapeutic improvement of RTT symptoms. Of note, one suppressor mutation implied that cholesterol homeostasis was perturbed in Mecp2 null mice; indeed, cholesterol synthesis was elevated in the brain and body system. Remarkably, the genetic effect of downregulating the cholesterol pathway could be mimicked chemically by statin drugs, improving motor symptoms, and increasing longevity in the mouse. Our work linked cholesterol metabolism to RTT pathology for the first time. Both neurological and systemic effects of perturbed cholesterol homeostasis overlap with many RTT symptoms. Here we show in patients that peripheral cholesterol, triglycerides, and/or LDLs may be elevated early in RTT disease onset, providing a biomarker for patients that could be aided by therapeutic interventions that modulate lipid metabolism.", 
    "159": "On the base of previously developed microbial models high effective scheme for screening of inhibitors of sterol biosynthesis (ISB) is proposed. It is based on cultivation of halophilic bacteria Halobacterium salinarum (former Halobacterium halobium), possessing mevalonate pathway of sterol biosynthesis, and cultivation of fungus Acremonium fusidioides (former Fusidium coccineum), that is producer of steroid antibiotic fusidin (fusidic acid), which biosynthesis has great similarity (with coincidence of its initial steps till squalene formation) to cholesterol biosynthesis in human organism. In H. salinarum model ISB are revealed as compounds that inhibit test-culture growth, whereas in A. fusidioides test-system they are revealed as compounds that strongly reduce fusidin production without any visible influence on producer's growth. Mevalonate that is one of the crucial intermediates of sterol biosynthesis remove inhibition induced by many microbial metabolites that is the evidence of their action at early stages of sterol biosynthetic pathway, including HMG-CoA reductase step. Both test-systems are developed as micromethod and could be easily mechanized due to miniaturization of microbiological procedures, cultivation in sterile 96-well plates and usage of automatic micropipettes and dispensers. Effectiveness of both test-systems, as well as their sensitiveness, laboriousness and ability to give false-positive or false-negative results in ISB screening work is compared. The proposed scheme of screening of ISB includes microbial models at early steps of screening procedures and Hep G2 test-system at the late step. The preliminary screening of microbial metabolites possessing antifungal activity at initial step is compulsory. Miniaturization and mechanization of microbial processes and purification of producers' culture broth with micro- and ultrafiltration are under consideration as well.",

The system is based on cultivation of the bacterial strain Halobacterium salinarum (former Halobacterium halobium), that possesses mevalonate pathway of sterol biosynthesis and is much similar in the biosynthesis to cholesterol formation in humans. In the H. salinarum test system the ISB were found as compounds that inhibited the test culture growth. Mevalonate which is one of the crucial intermediates of sterol biosynthesis dismissed the inhibitory effect of many microbial metabolites thus being evident of their action at the early stages of the sterol biosynthesis, including the HMG-CoA reductase stage. The H. salinarum test system was developed as a micromethod and could be easily mechanized by miniaturization of the microbiological procedures, cultivation in sterile 96-well plates and using automatic micropipettes and dispensers. The H. salinarum test system was effective in testing crude extracts of the culture broths and advantageous at early stage of screening. The use of the H. salinarum test system was shown possible for screening antitumor antibiotics.", 
    "161": "The study was aimed at assessing long-term survival after reconstructive surgery on non-coronary arteries in different age groups as well as the confounding factors. 469 case histories were analyzed retrospectively. The most patients underwent coronary angiography (CA) and preventive myocardial revascularization along with non-coronary artery exam. The mean follow-up period was 57.5 +/- 14.9 months. The groups were similar in terms of aspirin and statin therapy; however, older patients more often received beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors (p < 0.03). The number of patients who undergone CA increased with age (p = 0.002). Older patients had higher long-term mortality (p = 0.008) and poorer long-term survival (p = 0.001) as compared to patients below 60 years of age. The risk of death increased with age (OR 1.11; p = 0.001), in smokers (OR 2.79; p = 0.009) and in case of complications in the postoperative period (OR 4.09; p = 0.001). In turn, lower mortality was associated with CA and further preventive myocardial revascularization, if medical reasons (OR 0.15; p = 0.001). Thus, routine CA and preventive myocardial revascularization were associated with lower long-term mortality. This allows recommending an aggressive preoperative assessment to this category of patients.", 
    "162": "New effective economic microbial test-system for screening of microbial metabolites, that are inhibitors of sterol biosynthesis, is proposed. It is based on cultivation of fungal strain Acremonium fusidioides (former Fusidium coccineum), that produces fusidic acid (fusidin) that is antibiotic of steroid structure. Great similarity of fusidic acid biosynthesis in fungous strain and cholesterol biosynthesis in human organism, coincidence of their initial steps till squalene formation, allows use A. fusidioides as a model for estimation of microbial secondary metabolites that are potential inhibitors of sterol biosynthesis. Such inhibitors in A.fusidioides model are revealed as compounds that strongly reduce fusidin production without any visible influence on fungus growth. Mevalonate that is one of the crucial intermediates of sterol biosynthesis could be successfully applied for removal of inhibition induced by some microbial metabolites. A.fusidioides test-system can be easily mechanized because of miniaturization of microbiological procedures, cultivation in 6-, 24-, or 96-well plates and usage of automatic micropipettes and dispensers. The results of this model are well correlated with the ones obtained with human cells (Hep G2 test-system, offered earlier). A.fusidioides test-system can be applied at rather early stages of screening procedures and is quite effective for testing of crude extracts of producers' culture liquid.",

Among the 288 nonoccasional users, we found a compliance rate of 80% only in the 59.7%. The cost analysis shows that 59.787,72 euros (23.4%) have been spent for patients with compliance of less than 80% (ineffective adherence).",

    "169": "In this population-based historical cohort study, biochemistry data from patients in Tayside, Scotland, with LFTs performed in primary care were record-linked to secondary care and prescription databases to ascertain baseline characteristics, and to mortality data. Using this derivation cohort a survival model was developed to predict mortality. The model was assessed for calibration, discrimination (using the C-statistic) and performance, and validated using a separate cohort of Scottish primary care practices.",

The C-statistic for the final model was 0.82 (95% CI 0.80-0.84), and was similar in the validation cohort (n\u200a=\u200a11 653) 0.86 (0.79-0.90).

    "172": "Our aim was to improve the survival and reduce the apoptosis of chondrocytes derived from mesenchymal stem cells from Wharton's jelly of human umbilical cord (WJMSCs) by Lovastatin supplementation under hydrogen-peroxide-induced injury conditions to simulate the osteoarthritic micro-environment. Chondrocytes were differentiated in vitro from WJMSCs. The cultured WJMSCs expressed CD90 (84.07%), CD105 (80.84%), OCT4 (26.90%), CD45 (0.42%) and CD34 (0.48%) as determined by flow cytometry. Increased aggregation of proteoglycans observed by Safranin-O staining accompanied by increased expression of COL2A1, ACAN, SOX9 and BGN shown by immunocytochemistry and reverse transcription with the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) confirmed the chondrogenic differentiation of the WJMSCs. The in vitro differentiated chondrocytes were subjected to oxidative stress by exposure to 200 \u03bcM hydrogen peroxide, either in the presence or absence of Lovastatin (2 \u03bcM) for 5 h. Lovastatin treatment resulted in decreased apoptosis, senescence and LDH release and in increased viability and proliferation of WJMSC-derived chondrocytes. Real time PCR analysis showed markedly up-regulated expression of prosurvival, proliferation and chondrogenic genes (BCL2L1, BCL2, AKT, PCNA, COL2A1, ACAN, SOX9 and BGN) and significantly down-regulated expression of pro-apoptotic genes (BAX, FADD) in the Lovastatin-treated group in comparison with injured cells. The reduced expression of VEGF and p53 as determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and PCR suggests the suitability of the use of Lovastatin in adjunct to WJMSC-derived chondrocytes for the treatment of osteoarthritis. We conclude that Lovastatin protects WJMSC-derived chondrocytes from hydrogen-peroxide-induced in vitro injury.",

LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides worsened alongside HbA1c with distinct thresholds. Association of lower HDL-cholesterol with higher daily insulin dose is consistent and it points out to a role of exogenous hyperinsulinemia in the pathophysiology of the CVRF clustering. These data suggest diverse pathophysiological processes depending on HbA1c, refuting a unified explanation for cardiovascular risk in type 1 diabetes.", 
    "177": "Statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, have been reported to attenuate amyloid-\u03b2 peptide (A\u03b2) production in various cellular models. However, the mechanisms by which statins affect neuronal A\u03b2 production have not yet been clarified. Here, we investigated this issue in rat primary cortical neurons using two statins, pitavastatin (PV) and atorvastatin (AV). Treatment of neurons with 0.2-2.5\u00a0\u03bcM PV or AV for 4\u00a0days induced a concentration- and time-dependent reduction in the secretion of both A\u03b240 and A\u03b242. Moreover, Western blot analyses of cell lysates showed that treatment with PV or AV significantly reduced expression levels of the mature form of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Thr668-phosphorylated APP (P-APP), but not immature form of APP; the decreases in P-APP levels were more notable than those of mature APP levels. The statin treatment did not alter expression of BACE1 (\u03b2-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1) or \u03b3-secretase complex proteins (presenilin 1, nicastrin, APH-1, and PEN-2). In neurons overexpressing APP via recombinant adenoviruses, PV or AV similarly reduced A\u03b2 secretion and the levels of mature APP and P-APP. Statins also markedly reduced cellular cholesterol content in neurons in a concentration-dependent manner. Co-treatment with mevalonate reversed the statin-induced decreases in A\u03b2 secretion and mature APP and P-APP levels, whereas co-treatment with cholesterol did not, despite recovery of cellular cholesterol levels. Finally, cell-surface biotinylation experiments revealed that both statins significantly reduced the levels of cell-surface P-APP without changing those of cell surface mature APP. These results suggest that statins reduce A\u03b2 production by selectively modulating APP maturation and phosphorylation through a mechanism independent of cholesterol reduction in cultured neurons.",

We therefore investigated the association of SNP rs1333049:C>G with MI as well as familial hypercholesterolemia patients and also determined the effect of genotype on lipid levels in a northern Pakistani population. A case-control association study was performed in which 611 individuals (294 patients, 290 healthy controls and 27 patients from hypercholesterolemia families) were genotyped for rs1333049:C>G, using an Allele specific polymerase chain reaction. We found a significant association of rs1333049:C>G with MI (\u03c7(2)=22.3, p<0.001). The frequency of risk genotype CC was significantly different from the healthy controls (p<0.001, \u03c7(2)=22.3). The risk allele C was at a higher frequency in the MI patients as compared to the controls (odds ratio [OR]=1.55 (95% confidence interval [CI]=1.22-1.96), p<0.001). The logistic regression analysis for the genotype distribution resulted in strong association of risk allele C with MI under recessive model (OR=3.17 (95% CI=1.85-5.44) p<0.001). When the data were further analyzed along the lines of gender, a significant association with both males and females was observed. The pleiotropic role of rs1333049 was revealed further when CC genotype hypercholesterolemic individuals on statins were found to have a significantly lower TC, LDL-C and Tg levels as compared to the CG and GG individuals (p<0.05). The current study demonstrates a strong association of the ANRIL SNP (rs1333049) with MI as well as familial hypercholesterolemia patients in a northern Pakistani population and could be used as a useful genetic marker for the screening of MI in the general Pakistani population.",

    "206": "The SLCO1B1 521T\u2009>\u2009C and 388A\u2009>\u2009G variants were found to be relatively common in Chinese patients with essential hyperlipidemia. These frequencies were found to be similar to those observed in healthy Chinese and Japanese individuals, but significantly different from Caucasians and blacks. SLCO1B1 521T\u2009>\u2009C and 388A\u2009>\u2009G polymorphisms may not be associated with the lipid-lowering effects of atorvastatin and simvastatin.", 
    "207": "Acute brain dysfunction (delirium and coma) during critical illness is prevalent and costly, but the pathophysiology remains unclear. The relationship of acute brain dysfunction with endothelial function, which is impaired in critical illness and may contribute to alterations in cerebral blood flow and blood-brain barrier permeability, has not been studied. This study sought to determine whether systemic endothelial dysfunction is associated with acute brain dysfunction during critical illness.", 
    "208": "In this prospective cohort study, adult medical/surgical intensive care unit patients in shock and/or respiratory failure were enrolled. Endothelial function was assessed at enrollment using peripheral artery tonometry to calculate the reactive hyperemia index, with lower reactive hyperemia index indicative of worse endothelial function. Patients were assessed for coma and delirium with the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale and Confusion Assessment Method for the Intensive Care Unit. Multivariable linear regression was used to analyze the association between reactive hyperemia index and (1) delirium/coma-free days among all patients and (2) delirium duration among survivors, both over a 14-day period.", 
    "209": "One hundred forty-seven patients with median age of 57 yr and median Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score of 26 were enrolled. After adjusting for age, severity of illness, severe sepsis, preexisting cognitive function, medical versus surgical intensive care unit admission, and prehospital statin use, lower reactive hyperemia index (worse systemic endothelial function) was associated with fewer delirium/coma-free days (P = 0.02) and more delirium days (P = 0.05).",

    "211": "Vitamin D deficiency is nowadays considered as a potential cardiovascular and renal risk factor. We tested the hypotheses that vitamin D deficiency impairs the endothelial function of renal vasculature and whether vitamin D levels and endothelial function can be improved by the treatment with statins.", 
    "212": "In a double-blind, randomized study of 31 hypercholesterolemic patients with vitamin D insufficiency (<30 ng/ml) were randomly assigned to rosuvastatin (10 mg/d) and placebo for 6 weeks. Basal nitric oxide (NO) activity of the renal vasculature was assessed both before and after the blockade of NO synthases with systemic infusion of N(G)-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA). In parallel, 25(OH)D was measured.", 
    "213": "Multiple regression analysis revealed that at baseline 25(OH)D is an independent determinant of basal NO activity as assessed by the decrease in RPF, in response to L-NMMA (\u03b2 = -0.446, r = 0.015). Compared to placebo treatment, rosuvastatin increased 25(OH)D levels (21.6 \u00b1 4.0 vs. 24.1 \u00b1 8.1 ng/ml, p = 0.039). Basal NO activity was significantly more increased after 6-week therapy with rosuvastatin than with placebo (-94.8 \u00b1 70 vs. -68.2 \u00b1 32 ml/min, p = 0.044), indicating increased basal NOS activity after 6 weeks of rosuvastatin treatment. Basal NO activity in the placebo phase was correlated inversely with 25(OH)D (r = -0.385; p = 0.027).", 
    "214": "Thus, vitamin D insufficiency is associated with impaired endothelial function in the renal vasculature and both were beneficially influenced by the treatment with rosuvastatin.", 
    "215": "Tocotrienol rich fraction (TRF) of vitamin E was previously shown to have anticancer activity against murine tumor cells in vitro. TRF was also shown to potentiate the anticancer activity of statins. The objectives of this study were therefore (a) to prepare and characterize stable parenteral lipid nanoemulsions as a novel platform for the concurrent delivery of TRF and simvastatin for subsequent use in combination chemotherapy, and (b) to evaluate the antiproliferative activity of the nanoemulsions against MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 human mammary tumor cells. Nanoemulsions were prepared by the high-pressure homogenization technique using a viscous 70/30 blend of TRF and medium chain triglycerides as the oil phase in which simvastatin was dissolved at 9%w/w loading. Nanoemulsion droplets were about 200 nm in size and had surface potential of -45 mV. In a dissolution study, approximately 20% of simvastatin was released in sink conditions after 24h. The stability of the nanoemulsions was monitored over 6 months of storage. No oxidation or degradation products were detected and no loss in simvastatin loading was observed during this period. The antiproliferative activity of the nanoemulsions was also retained after storage. The IC50 of the TRF nanoemulsions against MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 was 14 and 7 \u03bcM, respectively, which decreased to 10 \u03bcM and 4.8 \u03bcM when simvastatin was added to the nanoemulsions. Nanoemulsions prepared with tocopherol had no anticancer activity and were used as negative control. This study demonstrated that parenteral lipid nanoemulsions are viable delivery platform for potential use in cancer chemotherapy.",

    "220": "LDL-receptor deficiency may provide a mechanism which contributes to atherogenic lipoprotein abnormalities in experimental nephrosis and in humans with glomerular proteinuria. The proprotein convertase subtilisin-kexin type 9 (PCSK9) pathway plays a key role in lipoprotein metabolism by promoting LDL-receptor degradation. We tested whether plasma PCSK9 is elevated in proteinuric states, and determined relationships of PCSK9 with lipoprotein responses to proteinuria reduction.",
