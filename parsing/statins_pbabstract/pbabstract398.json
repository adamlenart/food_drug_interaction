The drug combination was synergistic, being more potent in terms of inhibition of promastigote proliferation, macrophage infection and amastigote numbers. In promastigote cultures the effect was more marked in Leishmania amazonensis than L. donovani. Analysis of the sterol compositions of both promastigote and amastigote cultures revealed the inhibition of sterol 14 alpha-demethylation by miconazole and showed some apparent evidence of inhibition of sterol biosynthesis by lovastatin.", 
    "1": "Cholesterol in animals is a major structural component of cell membranes. It may therefore play a functional role in the modulation of cell osmolarity, the process of pinocytosis and the activities of membrane-associated proteins such as ionic pumps, immune responses, etc. A major relationship exists between the cell-growth processes and the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. The cholesterol needed for new membranes may be derived either from endogenous synthesis or from exogenous sources, principally plasma low-density-lipoproteins (LDL) which enter the cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Both these pathways are enhanced in rapidly growing cells. Conversely, if synthesis is inhibited and no exogenous cholesterol is available, cell growth is blocked. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMGCoA) reductase (the rate-limiting reaction in cholesterol biosynthesis) is the enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of HMGCoA to mevalonic acid. It has been suggested that mevalonate may play an important role in cell proliferation. All cells need at least two products synthesized from mevalonate in order to proliferate, and the only one yet identified is cholesterol. Other melavonate-derived potential candidates as cell-cycle and cell-survival products include the dolichols ubiquinone side chains, isopentenyladenosine derivatives, etc. Furthermore, it has recently been shown that membrane association appears to be an important function in mevalonate-derive modifications of several important proteins such as cellular membrane G proteins, those coded for by oncogenes (ras proteins) and lamins (nuclear proteins). In recent years the development of cholesterol-synthesis-inhibiting drugs, for lowering plasma cholesterol levels has mainly been centred on the control of HMGCoA reductase activity (vastatins). However, because mevalonic acid is the precursor of numerous metabolites, any reduction of such activity may potentiate pleiotropic effects. Vastatins are now, therefore, receiving increased attention as potential pharmacological tools for the control of abnormal cell growth in pathological situations, i.e. tumours and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation under atherogenic conditions. In our laboratories, we have demonstrated that simvastatin can prevent arterial myocyte proliferation both in vivo and in vitro. Simvastatin can also inhibit in vitro the rate of human glioma cell growth, since it shows a strong synergistic inhibitory effect on cell proliferation when used in association with anticancer agents such as Carmustine or beta-interferon. Both simvastatin-induced cell growth inhibition and the synergy observed with these drugs can be completely reversed by incubating cells with mevalonate. This shows that the effect of simvastatin of cell proliferation is due to its specific inhibitory activity on intracellular mevalonate synthesis.", 
    "2": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the lipid-lowering effect of simvastatin in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) patients with hypercholesterolaemia while possible clinical and biochemical adverse effects were monitored for. Forty-three NIDDM patients with hypercholesterolaemia (total cholesterol > 6.5 mmol/l) used simvastatin after a detailed clinical laboratory evaluation as well as a 4-week wash-out period and a 4-week placebo baseline period. Simvastatin treatment was initiated with a 10 mg dose for 6 weeks; this was increased to 20 mg and 40 mg at 12 and 18 weeks of follow-up respectively if the total cholesterol level had not decreased to below 5.17 mmol/l. Patients were placed on a lipid-lowering diet and continued to take any regular non-lipid-lowering medication throughout the trial; side-effects were monitored at 6-week intervals until patients had taken simvastatin for 24 weeks. The mean total cholesterol level was reduced by 22.2% at the first follow-up visit, and by 24.2%, 23.3%, and 28.5% at the second, third and fourth follow-up visits respectively compared with base-line levels. A dose of 10 mg simvastatin brought about a reduction in total cholesterol similar to those found with higher doses. The mean triglyceride level was reduced by 20.9% with 20 mg simvastatin. The high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level was not altered significantly and neither was the control of diabetes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "3": "The aim of this study was to develop and test a descriptive, intensive drug surveillance methodology in order to examine the effectiveness and safety of new drugs in the immediate postmarketing period. The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, simvastatin (Zocor), was chosen as the test drug. Data were collected from 100 randomly chosen cardiologists, specialist physicians and general practitioners practising in the six main centres of South Africa. A 66% doctor response rate was achieved and 438 patients were enrolled in the study. The overall effectiveness expressed as a percentage decrease (from baseline) in total cholesterol levels was 20.5% for the 251 patients who started on a 10 mg daily dose of the drug and 27.6% for the 42 patients who started on 10 mg but changed to 20 mg/d. The safety profile of simvastatin was comparable with the premarketing clinical trial data, and patient non-compliance appeared to be dose-related. The methodology employed was found to be suitable for the collection of safety and effectiveness data in the postmarketing period and simvastatin was shown to be effective with few adverse events reported.", 
    "4": "The Pravastatin, Lipids, and Atherosclerosis in the Carotids trial (PLAC-II) was initiated in 1987 and is the first double-masked randomized clinical trial with progression of early extracranial carotid atherosclerosis as an outcome variable. The trial will compare a lipid-lowering agent (pravastatin, a hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitor) with placebo for ability to retard the rate of progression of extracranial carotid atherosclerosis over 3 years. Inclusion criteria consisted of prevalent coronary artery disease, moderately elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (between the 60th and 90th percentiles), and the presence of at least one extracranial carotid artery atherosclerotic plaque that had an intimal-medial thickness (IMT) > or = 1.3 mm as visualized by B-mode ultrasound. Of approximately 650 patients who qualified on the basis of coronary disease and elevated LDL cholesterol, 55% were excluded because of B-mode criteria. One hundred and fifty-one males and females 50-75 years of age were recruited. Random allocation produced placebo-treated and test-treated groups that were similar for baseline historical data, physical findings, laboratory tests, lipid values, and B-mode characteristics. Baseline concentrations of plasma total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were 234, 166, and 41 mg/dl, respectively. Baseline plasma concentration of triglyceride was 170 mg/dl. Despite selection of participants whose arteries, overall, were suitable for the trial, individual segments in some participants could not be visualized. Ninety-seven percent of the individual carotid artery segments were visualized in the common carotid, 88% in the bifurcation, and 63% in the internal carotid artery. Far walls were slightly more often visualized than near walls, and nonvisualization was most common for the near wall of the internal carotid. Nonvisualized segments were comparable between both treatment groups. The distribution of arterial walls with qualifying plaque of > or = 1.3 mm IMT was similar for the two groups, and the two groups were also comparable for the primary outcome determinant, mean maximum IMT (mean of maximum of all visualizable sites, 1.32 mm for each treatment group). There are special problems related to recruitment and evaluation of patients for a clinical trial such as this, but the atherosclerosis outcome measurement markedly enhances power and compensates for difficulty in recruitment.", 
    "5": "Changes in plasma concentrations of high density lipoproteins (HDL) and triglycerides may partly explain the ability of cholesterol-lowering drugs to decrease the incidence of coronary heart disease. We measured the response of fasting plasma lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins in 46 subjects with Type IIa hypercholesterolemia treated with simvastatin for 3 months. The initial dose of simvastatin (10 mg/day) was subsequently increased up to 40 mg/day if the plasma cholesterol concentration had not fallen below 5.2 mmol/l. Plasma concentrations of HDL cholesterol and of the apolipoproteins AI and AII were increased by simvastatin. The increase in HDL cholesterol (9%) was due to increases in both subfractions (HDL2 17%; HDL3 7%), changes that would be consistent with a beneficial effect on cardiovascular risk. Simvastatin decreased plasma triglyceride concentrations by 25%. Plasma total cholesterol concentrations fell by 35% after 3 months of treatment; this fall was proportional to the initial concentration and was due almost entirely to a 45% fall in low density lipoprotein cholesterol. In contrast, plasma concentrations of lipoprotein Lp(a) were not affected by simvastatin.", 
    "6": "266 patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia were followed for 48 weeks at 27 different centres to evaluate the safety, tolerability and effect on plasma lipids of lovastatin ranging from 20 to 80 mg/day. Mean change from baseline after 12 weeks of treatment with lovastatin was -34% (CI:33-35) for total cholesterol, -42% (CI:40-43) for LDL-cholesterol, +14% (CI:12-17) for HDL-cholesterol and -14% (CI:10-18) for triglycerides. Combination therapy with cholestyramine (8-24 g/day) was optional, and was started in 89 patients from week 13. At week 48 only 25% of all patients had obtained the second objective of the study: a total cholesterol value below 5.2 mmol/l. At the same time 60% of all patients had a total cholesterol below 6.2 mmol/l. Four patients dropped out of the study owing to adverse clinical experience. Only three of these events were probably related to lovastatin. Six patients were withdrawn because of adverse laboratory experiences. One patient showed clinical signs of myositis and increase of CK. In severe primary hypercholesterolaemia combination therapy with lovastatin and a resin such as cholestyramine is required to obtain total cholesterol values below 5.2 mmol/l.", 
    "7": "Elongation factor-1 alpha (EF-1 alpha) is an ubiquitous protein that functions in peptide elongation during mRNA translation. We previously reported the isolation of a rat S1 protein that is antigenically related to statin, a nonproliferation-specific protein; this S1 gene shares a high degree of homology to EF-1 alpha. We constructed specific riboprobes to the two genes, based on the difference in the 3' noncoding regions of both S1 and EF-1 alpha mRNAs. Northern analysis and RNase protection assays have revealed that S1 mRNA is present only in brain, heart, and muscle, while EF-1 alpha mRNA has been detected in all tissues surveyed so far. The same tissue specificity has been observed in mouse, suggesting that S1 expression is conserved between these two mammalian species. S1 transcript was detected in late brain embryogenesis (day 20), but in lower amounts than in 3-month-old adult brain. We show that the relative levels of both S1 and EF-1 alpha transcripts and their respective tissue abundances remain unchanged during the aging process. The function of S1 is not yet known; but these results suggest that it may be involved in specific control mechanisms for protein synthesis in tissues where cells (i.e. neurons and myocytes) are permanently locked in a state of nonproliferation.", 
    "8": "A total of 291 patients with primary hypercholesterolemia [total plasma cholesterol > or = 6.20 mmol/liter (> or = 240 mg/dl)] were enrolled in an open, randomized, parallel, comparative study of simvstatin and pravastatin. All patients started or continued a standard lipid-lowering diet for > or = 6 weeks before entry into the 4-week placebo baseline period. There were 145 patients who received simvastatin and 146 patients who received pravastatin, both at the commonly recommended starting dose of 10 mg once daily, for a treatment period of 6 weeks. Concentrations of total cholesterol in plasma were reduced by 23% with simvastatin, and by 16% with pravastatin. Concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in plasma were reduced by 32 and 22%, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations were increased by 7 and 5% with simvastatin and pravastatin, respectively. Plasma triglyceride concentrations were reduced by 13% with simvastatin and by 6% with pravastatin. Adverse experiences were similar between treatment groups and both drugs were well tolerated. In each treatment group, 3 patients were withdrawn from the study for clinical adverse experiences; 1 patient in the pravastatin group required a reduction in dose to 5 mg/day because of insomnia. At the commonly recommended starting dose for each, simvastatin had a significantly greater lipid-lowering effect than pravastatin. Both drugs were well tolerated.", 
    "9": "We report the expression cloning of pMev, a cDNA that facilitates cellular uptake of mevalonate. pMev was isolated from the met-18b-2 clone of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, which were selected for growth in low concentrations of mevalonate when synthesis is blocked by compactin (Faust, J. R., and Krieger, M. (1987) J. Biol. Chem. 262, 1996-2004). pMev encodes a 494-residue protein, Mev, that is predicted to have 12 membrane-spanning regions, consistent with a membrane transporter. Surprisingly, levels of Mev mRNA and protein are similar in CHO and met-18b-2 cells. The Mev gene differs from the wild-type gene by a single base change that substitutes a cysteine for phenylalanine in the 10th membrane-spanning region. met-18b-2 cells are heterozygous for this dominant gain-of-function mutation. Transfection of a cDNA encoding pMev, but not the wild-type cDNA, elicited a marked increase in [3H]mevalonate uptake and incorporation into cellular lipids in stably and transiently transfected cells. The availability of pMev will facilitate studies of [3H]mevalonate incorporation into trace products, including p21ras and other prenylated proteins.", 
    "10": "26-Oxygenated derivatives of delta 8(14)-15-ketosterols have been synthesized from (25R)-3 beta,26-diacetoxy-5 alpha-cholest-8(14)-en-15-one (IX) as part of a program to prepare potential metabolites and analogs of 3 beta-hydroxy-5 alpha-cholest-8(14)-en-15-one (I), a potent regulator of cholesterol metabolism. Partial hydrolysis of IX gave a mixture, from which the 3 beta,26-diol II and the 26-acetate (XI) and 3 beta-acetate (X) monoesters were isolated. Mitsunobu reaction of XI followed by hydrolysis gave (25R)-3 alpha,26-dihydroxy-5 alpha-cholest-8(14)-en-15-one (VI). Oxidation of XI with pyridinium chlorochromate followed by hydrolysis of the acetate gave (25R)-26-hydroxy-5 alpha-cholest-8(14)-ene-3,15-dione (VII). Oxidation of X with Jones reagent followed by hydrolysis of the acetate gave (25R)-3 beta-hydroxy-15-keto-5 alpha-cholest-8(14)-en-26-oic acid (IVa). Jones oxidation of II gave (25R)-3,15-diketo-5 alpha-cholest-8(14)-en-26-oic acid (VII). 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance assignments and analyses of mass spectral fragmentation data are presented for each of the new compounds and their derivatives. The 3,15-diketone VII was found to be highly active in lowering the levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity in CHO-K1 cells, with a potency comparable to that of I. In contrast, 3 alpha,26-diol VI was less potent than I or VII. The two carboxylic acid analogs IVa and VIII were considerably less potent than VI in lowering the levels of HMG-CoA reductase activity.", 
    "11": "Mevinolin (lovastatin), a competitive inhibitor of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, directly inhibited acyl-CoA cholesteryl acyltransferase in rabbit intestinal microsomes at a dose of 20 micrograms/ml or more. Lineweaver-Burk analysis showed a competitive type of inhibition with respect to oleoyl-CoA. In cultured intestinal Caco-2 cells, mevinolin reduced [14C]oleate incorporation into cholesteryl-esters by 86% of controls at doses as low as 0.1 micrograms/ml. However, in cells whose activity of acyl-CoA cholesteryl acyltransferase was stimulated 7-fold by 10 mM mevalonolactone, a significant inhibitory effect on cholesteryl-ester formation could not be detected, even at 40 micrograms/ml of mevinolin. In contrast, cells supplied with liposomal cholesterol or cholesterol derived from low-density lipoproteins showed a marked reduction of cholesteryl-ester formation in the presence of 10 or 0.1 micrograms/ml of mevinolin, respectively. It is concluded that the observed suppressive effects of mevinolin on cholesterol esterification in cultured Caco-2 cells are indirect and possibly caused by changes in the acyl-CoA cholesteryl acyltransferase substrate pool or intracellular cholesterol transport.", 
    "12": "Rats were treated with mevinolin by intraperitoneal injection (15 days) or dietary administration (30 days). The cholesterol, dolichol, dolichyl phosphate and ubiquinone contents of the liver, brain, heart, muscle and blood were then investigated. The cholesterol contents of these organs did not change significantly, with the exception of muscle. Intraperitoneal administration of the drug increases the amount of dolichol in liver, muscle and blood and decreases the dolichyl-P amount in muscle. The same treatment increases the level of ubiquinone in muscle and blood and decreases this value in liver and heart. Oral administration decreases dolichol, dolichyl-P and ubiquinone levels in heart and muscle, while in liver the dolichol level is elevated and ubiquinone level lowered. In brain the amount of dolichyl-P is increased. Intraperitoneal injection of mevinolin also modifies the liver dolichol and dolichyl-P isoprenoid pattern, with an increase in shorter chain polyisoprenes. The levels of dolichol and ubiquinone in the blood do not follow the changes observed in other tissues. Incorporation of [3H]acetate into cholesterol by liver slices prepared from mevinolin-treated rats exhibited an increase, whereas in brain no change was seen. Labeling of dolichol and ubiquinone was increased in both liver and brain, but incorporation into dolichyl phosphate remained relatively stable. The results indicate that mevinolin affects not only HMG-CoA reductase but, to some extent, also affects certain of the peripheral enzymes, resulting in considerable effects on the various mevalonate pathway lipids.", 
    "13": "Lovastatin blocks the biosynthesis of the isoprenoid precursor, mevalonate. When Friend murine erythroleukemia (MEL) cells are cultured in medium containing lovastatin, the precursor of murine leukemia virus envelope glycoprotein (gPr90env) fails to undergo proteolytic processing, which normally occurs in the Golgi complex. Consequently, newly synthesized envelope proteins are not incorporated into viral particles that are shed into the culture medium. gPr90env appears to be localized in a pre-Golgi membrane compartment, based on its enrichment in subcellular fractions containing NADPH-cytochrome c reductase activity and the sensitivity of its carbohydrate chains to digestion with endoglycosidase H. Arrest of gPr90env processing occurs at concentrations of lovastatin that are not cytostatic, and the effect of the inhibitor is prevented by addition of mevalonate to the medium. The low molecular mass GTP-binding proteins, rab1p and rab6p, which are believed to function in early steps of the exocytic pathway, are normally modified posttranslationally by geranylgeranyl isoprenoids. However, in MEL cells treated with 1 microM lovastatin, nonisoprenylated forms of these proteins accumulate in the cytosol prior to arrest of gPr90env processing. These observations suggest that lovastatin may prevent viral envelope precursors from reaching the Golgi compartment by blocking the isoprenylation of rab proteins required for ER to Golgi transport.",

Triglyceride levels were reduced by high-dose pravastatin only (7% +/- 29%), but were found to increase with resin (45% +/- 63%). During long-term treatment over 36 months, still greater reductions in total and LDL cholesterol were found in patients taking pravastatin (n = 35), but not in those taking resin (n = 11). There was an apparent decrease in effect beyond 18 months in both groups, possibly related to reduced compliance with diet or cholestyramine intake. Eight subjects allocated to pravastatin and seven allocated to resin withdrew (one and two subjects respectively because of drug-induced adverse events). Adverse events during 12 weeks' monotherapy with pravastatin included central nervous system (CNS) symptoms (12%), gastrointestinal (GIT) symptoms (7%) and an acute hepatitic reaction (one subject).

The study was a randomized double-blind cross-over trial of two diets: a low fat diet and a higher fat diet, and was performed to determine whether ongoing attention to diet is necessary for patients receiving this drug for the treatment of familial hypercholesterolaemia. Plasma cholesterol concentration was 6.5 per cent lower on the low fat diet than on the high fat diet. The difference was within the range predicted by the Jacobs modification of the Keys formula from the reported intake on the two diets. The fall on the low fat diet was principally accounted for by a reduction in low density lipoprotein cholesterol, although high density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein A1 also fell. Patients taking HMGCoA reductase inhibitors for the treatment of familial hypercholesterolaemia respond to changes in dietary fat intake. They are thus likely to achieve further reduction in their coronary heart disease risk, and should remain on a low saturated fat low cholesterol diet even when taking these powerful lipid lowering drugs.",

    "35": "Transforming growth factor-Beta (TGF-beta) is a potent growth inhibitor for several cell types including epithelial cells and hematopoietic progenitor cells. Using a human promonocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1, we have shown that TGF-beta inhibits their proliferation and promotes differentiation into cells exhibiting macrophage-like properties. Therefore, a key question is whether TGF-beta influences the expression of genes associated with proliferation and/or growth inhibition. TGF-beta treatment of THP-1 cells results in downregulation of expression of c-myc. We also observe that TGF-beta 1-treated cells express reduced levels of the cell cycle regulated histone, H2B, but express elevated levels of an RNA splicing variant of this histone that has been observed to be upregulated in growth inhibited and terminally differentiated cells. In addition, a nuclear protein associated with senescence and withdrawal of cells from the cell cycle, statin, is also expressed by THP-1 cells in response to TGF-beta 1 treatment. These results suggest that TGF-beta 1 is capable of inducing expression of specific nuclear proteins associated with differentiation and/or cessation of proliferation that may result in changes in nuclear organization and altered gene expression.

Lovastatin was administered at a dosage of 40-80 mg for 20 weeks and was discontinued for 5 weeks thereafter. Parallel to a 47% fall in plasma LDL cholesterol, there was a significant reduction (P < 0.01) in erythrocyte membrane cholesterol:phospholipid molar ratio, while erythrocyte membrane fluidity assessed by diphenylhexatriene (DPH) fluorescence polarization increased significantly (P < 0.01). Discontinuation of lovastatin resulted in the reversal of erythrocyte membrane composition and fluidity to pre-treatment values.", 
    "37": "The association between increased risk for coronary artery disease (CAD) and elevated plasma cholesterol has been firmly established. The beneficial effect of cholesterol lowering treatment modalities was confirmed in both primary and secondary intervention trials. Because long-term treatment is usually required for lipid lowering therapies the drugs used for lipid reduction have to be not only efficacious but also safe. Inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis that have become clinically available during the last few years, can reduce plasma levels of total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol very effectively. In the Familial Atherosclerosis Treatment Study (FATS) an intensive cholesterol lowering treatment modality consisting of a combination of an inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis and colestipol reduced the progression of coronary lesions and caused a partial regression of such lesions. Among the various inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis developed recently, pravastatin appears to be tissue-specific because of its hydrophilic property.", 
    "38": "Reduced cholesterolemia lowers the risk of ischemic cardiopathy, especially if LDL cholesterol levels are reduced. Today this effect can be achieved using drugs following the discovery of a new class of molecules: statins are specific inhibitors of HMG-CoA-reductase, a key enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. These molecules act by modifying the intracellular quota of cholesterol, especially at a hepatocytic level, thus enabling an enhanced expression of those genes responsible for forming receptors for membrane LDL with an increased number of receptors. This leads to a modulation of receptor activity which interferes with LDL uptake, promoting more rapid clearance. The aim of this study was to confirm the efficacy and tolerability of pravastatin when used for long periods in patients with high cholesterol levels, and to compare its activity to that of gemfibrozil.", 
    "39": "The recent introduction in clinical practice of a new class of drugs able to reduce the endogenous synthesis of cholesterol has undoubtedly made a noteworthy contribution to the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia which, as is well known, is one of the greatest risk factors in the natural history of atherosclerotic disease and of its cardiovascular complications. A last generation drug belonging to this family is pravastatin which differs from the other substances inhibiting the activity of the key enzyme of cholesterol metabolism, HMGCaA reductase, because of certain features of the molecule, such as hydrophilia and the fact it is already pharmacologically active at the moment of oral administration. Pravastatin, which is probably a special category of HMGCoA reductase inhibitor, has shown, in numerous experimental studies and controlled clinical trials, a notable effectiveness in reducing in a highly selective fashion the synthesis of cholesterol in the liver cells and consequently the number of cholesterol-rich lipoproteins in the systemic circulation, without also determining significant biologically negative side-effects.", 
    "40": "Lovastatin was administered to six hypercholesterolaemic patients (mean plasma cholesterol 450 mg dl-1). Plasma lipoproteins (VLDL, LDL, and HDL) were separated before and following 7 and 12 weeks treatment with lovastatin. Fluidity was quantified by fluorescence polarization measurements using 1,6-diphenyl 1,3,5 hexatriene (DPH) as the fluorescent probe. Lovastatin treatment resulted in a significant reduction of total plasma cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and VLDL cholesterol (-41%, -44%, -68%, respectively). Fluidity measurements showed significant (p < 0.01) increase in LDL fluidity by 11% and 21% after 7 and 12 weeks of lovastatin treatment, whereas, VLDL fluidity was increased by 27% after 12 weeks of therapy. HDL fluidity was not altered. These alterations in the fluidity of the atherogenic lipoproteins (LDL and VLDL) in hypercholesterolaemic patients may prove to be of significance in reducing the risk of atherosclerosis.", 
    "41": "The effects of daily chronic treatment for 6 months with pravastatin was evaluated on the performance of the skeletal muscle system of different rat groups. At all doses (0.1 mg/kg-20 mg/kg) the righting reflex and the electromyographic signals observed in vivo did not show any abnormality. At the end of the treatment the Extensor digitorum longus muscles were dissected from treated and control rats and their passive and active electrical parameters were analyzed in vitro by standard microelectrodes technique. Pravastatin did not modify the chloride conductance nor the excitability characteristics of the fibers. Chronic treatment with pravastatin does not produce any alteration of skeletal muscle function.", 
    "42": "Dahl salt-sensitive (S) rats fed a high salt diet develop hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and progressive renal disease. Previous studies have suggested that lipids may be important in the pathogenesis of glomerulosclerosis in Dahl S rats. To investigate this possibility, Dahl S rats fed 4% NaCl chow were treated chronically with the cholesterol synthesis inhibitor lovastatin. After 22 weeks, lovastatin-treated rats had a 38% reduction in serum cholesterol, a 76% reduction in urine albumin excretion, and one-sixth the incidence of focal glomerulosclerosis compared with vehicle-treated control rats. Blood pressure in lovastatin-treated rats was significantly (p < 0.05) lower than that in vehicle-treated rats both early in the study (4 weeks of treatment) and at the end of the protocol. Lovastatin had no effect on glomerular filtration rate or glomerular ultrafiltration dynamics. The efficacy of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in attenuating proteinuria and experimental glomerular disease may be dependent on sodium intake. Thus, we also investigated the effects of long-term enalapril treatment on glomerular injury in Dahl S rats fed high salt chow. Enalapril treatment (50 or 200 mg/l drinking water) significantly lowered blood pressure in Dahl S rats, but did not significantly affect albuminuria or glomerulosclerosis. Enalapril also had no effect on glomerular hemodynamics. These results suggest that lipids may be important in the development of both glomerular disease and hypertension in Dahl S rats and that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition may not affect the course of renal disease in a setting of high salt intake.", 
    "43": "Protein phosphorylation is well established as a regulatory mechanism in higher plants, but only a handful of plant enzymes are known to be regulated in this manner, and relatively few plant protein kinases have been characterized. AMP-activated protein kinase regulates key enzymes of mammalian fatty acid, sterol and isoprenoid metabolism, including 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. We now show that there is an activity in higher plants which, by functional criteria, is a homologue of the AMP-activated protein kinase, although it is not regulated by AMP. The plant kinase inactivates mammalian HMG-CoA reductase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and peptide mapping suggests that it phosphorylates the same sites on these proteins as the mammalian kinase. However, with the target enzymes purified from plant sources, it inactivates HMG-CoA reductase but not acetyl-CoA carboxylase. The kinase is located in the soluble, and not the chloroplast, fraction of leaf cells, consistent with the idea that it regulates HMG-CoA reductase, and hence isoprenoid biosynthesis, in vivo. The plant kinase also appears to be part of a protein kinase cascade which has been highly conserved during evolution, since the kinase is inactivated and reactivated by mammalian protein phosphatases (2A or 2C) and mammalian kinase kinase, respectively. This contrasts with the situation for many other mammalian protein kinases involved in signal transduction, which appear to have no close homologue in higher plants. To our knowledge, this represents the first direct evidence for a protein kinase cascade in higher plants.", 
    "44": "Stable compensation of diabetes mellitus, including normolipidemia, underlies the therapy of diabetic angiopathies. Mevacor represents a nonactive lactone form of a certain hydroxy acid, a potent inhibitor of endogenous synthesis of cholesterol, conducive to blood cholesterol reduction. The aim of the present study was the assessment of the efficacy of this drug in therapy of patients with diabetes mellitus. Ten patients were administered mevacor in a dose of 20 mg for a month. Such therapy was conducive to a significant reduction of the levels of cholesterol, LNP cholesterol, triglycerides, and cholesterol/LVP ratio. It also promoted a reduction of the content of lipid peroxidation products in the blood, these products being an active factor of vessel destruction. The levels of hydroperoxides, blood serum and red cell malonic dialdehyde, and superoxide dismutase were also reduced. These results necessitate addition of mevacor to a complex of therapy for diabetes to normalize lipid metabolism.", 
    "45": "18 patients were studied with primary hypercholesterolemia (type II according to Fredricksen) and fasting cholesterol level during low fat diet above 250 mg/dl. Blood samples were taken: I--before lovastatin administration on diet, II--after 4 weeks administration of 20 mg, III--after 4 weeks of 80 mg and IV--4 weeks after the drug discontinued. The following tests were performed: platelets aggregation induced by ADP and adrenaline, PF3 and PF4, platelet MDA, serum triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol. Before treatment patients showed significant platelets hyperaggregation and MDA concentration comparing to the control group. During the drug administration significant lowering of platelets MDA concentration, was observed small but significant HDL cholesterol level increase which correlated with platelet MDA concentration. Availability of PF3 and release of PF4 did not change during study.", 
    "46": "Pravastatin is a new drug that inhibits 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, the key enzyme in cholesterol synthesis. It prevents mevalonate synthesis, thus reducing cholesterol. Pravastatin also stimulates the expression of LDL receptors, leading to an activation of this specific pathway of LDL catabolism. Gemfibrozil is a fibrate drug. Although the mechanism of hypolipidemic action of fibrates is not conclusively elucidated, it seems to involve reduction of LDL cholesterol secondary to decreased VLDL production and increased VLDL catabolism. Therefore, it might be hypothesized that combination therapy with both agents could afford greater reduction of cholesterol levels as compared to pravastatin alone. This study compared the efficacy and safety of pravastatin in monotherapy or in combination with gemfibrozil in the treatment of primary hypercholesterolemia with moderate hypertriglyceridemia. Thirty-eight subjects (aged 57 +/- 15 years, 25 M and 13 F) with baseline cholesterol levels > 220 mg/dl, were included in the study. Serum triglyceride levels were greater than 170 mg/dl and lower than 250 mg/dl. All patients initially followed 4 weeks of hypolipidemic diet. The patients were there assigned to receive either 20 mg once a day of pravastatin alone (n 13) or 20 mg of pravastatin in association with 600 mg of gemfibrozil daily (n 11). Fourteen additional patient, treated with diet only, served as a control group. The treatment plan provided 18 months of active treatment with clinical and laboratory controls every month. Both groups of treated patients showed a reduction of total and LDL-cholesterol levels. The HDL-cholesterol levels increased significantly both with pravastatin and with gemfibrozil.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "47": "Molecular markers of the coagulation system and the effects of pravastatin on lipid levels and the coagulation markers were studied in 48 patients (mean age, 55 years) with hypercholesterolemia (plasma total cholesterol levels > 280 mg/dl). Each patient received 10 mg of pravastatin daily for 3 months. Plasma total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels decreased significantly during treatment and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels increased significantly. Above-normal plasma levels of thrombin-antithrombin III complex, fibrinopeptide A, FDP-D-dimer, plasminogen activator inhibitor-I, and thrombomodulin were found in the patients before treatment; each of these was reduced significantly during treatment. The findings suggest the presence of a hypercoagulable state in hypercholesterolemia and that pravastatin might prevent the hypercoagulable state by reducing hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "48": "The protein statin is found in nuclei of nonproliferating cells. Here we report that statin is a phosphoprotein, phosphorylated at serine residues in cultured cells. During immunoprecipitation with anti-statin (S44) antibody, a 45-kDa protein co-precipitates with the 57-kDa statin. In vitro kinase assays demonstrate that the S44 immunoprecipitates can phosphorylate, besides statin, immunoglobulins, enolase, and casein, at either serine or serine/threonine residues. Kinase assays with immunoprecipitated proteins performed on casein- or enolase-impregnated gels show that these substrates are phosphorylated by the 45-kDa (p45) protein. When the S44 immunoprecipitates from human cultured fibroblasts with different in vitro life-spans were compared, the p45 kinase activity was present only in young nongrowing and senescent cells, but not in young growing ones. In other cell cultures, the kinase is detected only in protein complexes precipitated from quiescent 3T3 cells, but not from cycling 3T3 cells or from transformed human glioma (U251-4) cells. Cell fractionation studies, indicating that the phosphorylating activity of S44 immunoprecipitates correlates both qualitatively and quantitatively with the amount of statin present, provide strong evidence that in vivo statin is specifically associated with the p45 kinase. These results suggest that the nonproliferation-specific nature of statin is indeed related to the phosphorylated property of this protein and maybe contributed by the associated kinase.",

A test of the extent of the patients' understanding about the drugs they were taking showed that only 39% knew how the drug acted and the reasons for the chosen dosing schedule. 23% of the patients would like to have received more information, but 9% of these had problems in formulating questions to the health personnel. Anxiety was a problem for 16% of patients, especially in the early phase of the clinical study. Only half of the team-members were aware of this. 45% of the patients felt that they would disappoint the team if they expressed a wish to drop out of the study.

Among the derivatives, 3 beta-hydroxylanost-7-en-32-oic acid was the most active in depressing HMG-CoA reductase activity (IC50: 0.7 microM) and cholesterol biosynthesis (IC50: 0.4 microM) from 24,25-dihydrolanosterol.",

However, this effect is not seen after oral administration of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in rats. We found that oral administration of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor Simvastatin also had no effect on plasma cholesterol in severely hyperlipidaemic Nagase analbuminaemic rats (NAR). Simvastatin (an apolar compound dissolved in propylene glycol) was infused continuously for 28 days into the subcutis of control Sprague-Dawley rats (SDR) and NAR using an implanted osmotic pump. All doses which were effective in reducing cholesterol in the NAR (reductions up to approximately 60%), reduced apolipoprotein AI but not apolipoprotein B and caused a severe inflammatory reaction in the dermis. Similar toxicity was observed in the SDR. Subcutaneous administration of the vehicle (propylene glycol) did not cause this reaction and did not affect plasma lipids. Administration of Lovastatin in osmotic pumps resulted in a similar inflammatory reaction. Incorporation of Simvastatin into liposomes did not diminish the toxic effect. On the other hand, infusion of Pravastatin (a polar HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor dissolved in isotonic saline) caused no changes in the dermis and had no effect on plasma lipids in NAR or SDR. Liver microsomes prepared from the Pravastatin-treated rats demonstrated a 3- to 4-fold increase in HMG-CoA reductase activity as compared to untreated rats, confirming uptake of the drug. We conclude that continuous subcutaneous administration of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors Simvastatin, Lovastatin and Pravastatin for 28 days may not reduce plasma cholesterol in rats by a mechanism which is related to inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase activity in the liver. The decrease of plasma cholesterol effected by subcutaneous infusion of Simvastatin or Lovastatin in NAR coincides with, and may be related to inflammatory changes caused by administering these compounds into the dermis.", 
    "72": "To further define thyroid hormone effects on bile acid synthesis and biliary lipid secretion, studies were done in chronic bile fistula rats. Euthyroid and methimazole-hypothyroid rats, with and without triiodothyronine (T3) injection, had total bile diversion for timed bile collections. With interrupted enterohepatic circulation, cholesterol absorption is negligible and bile acid secretion equals bile acid synthesis rate. Hypothyroid rats had diminished levels of bile acid synthesis and biliary secretion of cholesterol and phospholipid. Single dose T3 injection produced a 13-fold increase in bile cholesterol secretion and a 3-fold increase in phospholipid secretion, both initiated 12 h after T3. Bile acid synthesis increased by 50%, but the increase did not begin until 24 h after T3. Neither hypothyroidism nor T3 treatment abolished diurnal rhythms of bile acid synthesis and biliary lipid secretion. Inhibition of cholesterol synthesis with lovastatin resulted in a persistent 33% decrease in bile acid synthesis in euthyroid and hypothyroid rats, while bile cholesterol secretion only transiently decreased. Inhibition of cholesterol synthesis did not alter T3-induced bile cholesterol secretion, with a 10-fold increase seen. However, bile acid synthesis was not stimulated by T3 in the presence of lovastatin. We conclude that facilitated bile acid synthesis and biliary cholesterol secretion are early effects of T3 and may account for the hypocholesterolemia of T3. Cholesterol synthesis does not appear to be required for the T3-induced bile cholesterol secretion.", 
    "73": "Thyroid hormone lowers serum cholesterol and alters sterol metabolic processes. This laboratory has previously reported increased biliary lipid secretion as an early effect of triiodothyronine (T3) in the rat. To evaluate whether the bile lipid action of T3 is a primary or secondary effect, the isolated-perfused rat liver model was used. Red blood cells in lipid-free buffer were used to perfuse livers of euthyroid and methimazole-hypothyroid rats, as well as hypothyroid rats given T3 at intervals before perfusion. Bile flow was maintained by taurocholate perfusion. Hypothyroid rats had elevated pre-perfusion serum cholesterol compared to euthyroid (107 +/- 4 vs. 65 +/- 2 mg/dl) and decreased biliary cholesterol (0.016 +/- 0.001 vs. 0.031 +/- 0.004 mumol/g liver/h) secretion. Serum cholesterol decreased to euthyroid levels by 18 h after T3, an effect that was prevented by bile duct ligation. Bile cholesterol secretion doubled by 18 h, and reached levels twice euthyroid by 42 h, while phospholipid secretion doubled to levels just above euthyroid. The fourfold increase in biliary cholesterol secretion occurred with lipid-free perfusion and unchanging bile acid uptake or output. It occurred without a fall in hepatic lipoprotein cholesterol secretion. Blockade of cholesterol synthesis with lovastatin failed to alter T3-augmented bile cholesterol secretion. We conclude that T3 induces biliary cholesterol secretion concomitantly with the fall in serum cholesterol. This augmented biliary secretion did not appear to depend upon lipoprotein uptake, increased bile acid transport, or cholesterol synthesis. It did not occur at the expense of hepatic lipoprotein secretion. Facilitated biliary lipid secretion may be a primary effect of T3.",

A look ahead uncovers new properties that may be of potential benefit in the treatment of atherosclerosis, hypertension, cholelithiasis, mild renal disease and possibly thrombogenesis and cancer. In view of the fact that the magnitude of low density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering is commensurate with the degree of atherosclerosis regression, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors provide a unique tool for the control of aggressive atherosclerotic vascular disease and for secondary prevention of coronary artery disease.", 
    "79": "Tissue selectivity of pravastatin sodium (pravastatin), lovastatin and simvastatin, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors was examined by measuring inhibition of de novo sterol synthesis and active drug concentrations in the liver, spleen and testis in rats after a single oral administration (25 mg/kg) of these drugs. Regarding tissue drug concentrations, all three drugs were liver selective: concentrations of drugs in the liver were about ten-times higher than those in the spleen and testis. On the other hand, pravastatin was far more liver selective in inhibiting sterol synthesis than two other inhibitors: pravastatin inhibited de novo sterol synthesis in the liver but minimally in the spleen and testis, whereas lovastatin and simvastatin inhibited in all three tissues. Microautoradiographic and in vitro cellular-uptake studies demonstrated that pravastatin remained in the extracellular space in the spleen, whereas the other drugs entered the cell. We conclude that pravastatin exhibits a liver-selective inhibition of sterol synthesis because the agent permeates the cell membrane in the liver, but not in non-hepatic tissues.",

Although simvastatin reduced serum TC concentrations by 30% after 6 months, calculations from age- and risk-related TC quintiles show that the absolute difference in attributable CHD deaths would be just > 1%. These results are reminiscent of the experience from several large prospective primary drug trials that demonstrated impressive relative benefit ratios but much smaller absolute differences (< 2%) in CHD endpoints between the treated and untreated groups. This epidemiologically based approach of assessing efficacy and potential long-term benefit of a lipid-lowering drug may be more appropriate and potentially less misleading than just the percentage change of TC (or other lipoproteins) so frequently reported in short-term drug trials.", 
    "81": "Mammalian AMP-activated protein kinase is the central component of a protein kinase cascade which inactivates three key enzymes involved in the synthesis or release of free fatty acids and cholesterol inside the cell. The kinase cascade is activated by elevation of AMP, and perhaps also by fatty acid and cholesterol metabolites. The system may fulfil a protective function, preventing damage caused by depletion of ATP or excessive intracellular release of free lipids, a type of stress response. Recent evidence suggests that it may have been in existence for at least a billion years, since a very similar protein kinase cascade is present in higher plants. This system therefore represents an early eukaryotic protein kinase cascade, which is unique in that it is regulated by intracellular metabolites rather than extracellular signals or cell cycle events.",

    "84": "Significant reductions higher than 25% were obtained in plasma levels of total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol associated with an increase > 10% in the HDL cholesterol plasma concentration in 51% of the patients. The individual results were classified as satisfactory (higher than 20% decrease) in 70% of the studied population. The compliance of pravastatin was excellent, since 118 patients (6.4%) developed adverse reactions, but interruption of the treatment was necessary in only 18 (0.9%); 9 patients due to muscular pain, 3 by gastrointestinal symptoms, 2 by cutaneous reactions and 4 due to general complaints. The clinical conditions of diabetes, obesity, hypertension did not modify the efficacy of the drug. Previous unsatisfactory hypolipidemic treatment did not alter the results of the efficacy.",

    "86": "Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) is inhibited in a non-competitive manner by oleoyl CoA, oleic acid and 2-monopalmitoylglycerol, 50% inhibition being observed at concentrations of approx. 0.1 microM, 0.5 microM and 500 microM, respectively. HSL is a key enzyme in lipid metabolism, mobilising triacylglycerol and cholesterol ester stores in several tissues. Feedback inhibition of HSL by oleoyl CoA and oleic acid may therefore prevent accumulation of free fatty acids and cholesterol in the cell, whereas 2-monoacylglycerol may act as a feedback inhibitor if the capacity of monoacylglycerol lipase is exceeded.", 
    "87": "The monoclonal antibody, S-44, identifies statin, a 57 kDa nuclear protein which appears to be expressed exclusively in non-proliferating cells. We previously demonstrated that in the aging rat corpus callosum approximately one third of neuroglia are statin-negative, suggesting the existence of an unexpectedly large cycling glial compartment. In the present study, double-labeling of individual cultured astroglia with [3H]thymidine and the S-44 antibody provided direct evidence for the non-proliferative status of statin-positive cells. The S-44 antibody was used to immuno-localize statin and thereby determine growth fractions for neuroglia in various grey matter regions of 3-, 18-, and 33-month-old rats. The proportion of statin-negative (cycling) cells for the three ages combined ranged from about 24% in the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus to 38% in the molecular layer of the parietal cortex. In most regions surveyed total glial counts and proportions of statin-positive and -negative cells did not vary significantly as a function of advancing age. These results suggest that (i) as in corpus callosum, pools of cycling neuroglia in various grey matter regions are far in excess of those previously predicted by S-phase labeling with [3H]thymidine or BUdR, and (ii) ratios of proliferating-to-quiescent neuroglia are tightly regulated over much of the animal's adult life span. These conserved ratios may be used as markers of normal CNS senescence, and deviations thereof may indicate the presence and extent of intervening neuropathologic processes.", 
    "88": "Squalene synthase (farnesyldiphosphate:farnesyldiphosphate farnesyltransferase, EC 2.5.1.21) converts farnesyl pyrophosphate to squalene, the first metabolic step committed solely to the biosynthesis of sterols. Using a fluorescence-activated cell sorting technique designed to screen for cells defective in the regulated degradation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, we isolated a squalene synthase-deficient mutant of Chinese hamster ovary cells. The mutant cell line, designated SSD, exhibits less than 7% of the squalene synthase activity of the parental cell line, CHO-HMGal. Both the SSD and the parental cells stably express HMGal, a model protein for studying the regulated degradation of HMG-CoA reductase, which consists of the membrane domain of HMG-CoA reductase fused to bacterial beta-galactosidase (Skalnik, D. G., Narita, H., Kent, C., and Simoni, R. D. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 6836-6841). In this study, the regulatory effects of mevalonate and compactin on the activity levels of HMGal are substantially reduced in SSD cells as compared to the parental cell line. In lipid-poor medium, SSD cell growth is arrested. The rate of [3H]acetate incorporation into cholesterol for the mutant SSD cells is less than 2% of the rate for the parental cells. However, the incorporation of [3H] squalene into sterols is essentially wild type for SSD cells. When the mutant SSD cells are fed [3H]acetate, radioactivity accumulates in farnesol, much of which is secreted into the medium. By growing SSD cells in lipid-poor medium, a revertant cell type, designated SSR, was isolated. In every assay performed the revertant SSR cells exhibited a phenotype that was essentially wild type, demonstrating that the SSD mutant phenotype was the result of a single mutation.",

Activating mutations of K-ras gene have been detected in most human pancreatic adenocarcinomas. In the present study, the effect of lovastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A, the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol synthesis, on the growth of five pancreatic cancer cell lines (human-CAV, MIA Paca2, CAPAN2 and PANC1, and hamster-H2T) in vitro and of two cell lines (CAV and H2T) in vivo was examined. Inhibition of cell growth was observed with lovastatin doses at or above 2.5 micrograms/mL for H2T, CAV, MIA Paca2, and CAPAN2 or 10 micrograms/mL in PANC1. The H2T cell line was studied further to determine the reversibility of growth inhibition. Mevalonic acid (1 mmol/L) reversed lovastatin-induced inhibition of cell growth if it was added with lovastatin (2.5 micrograms/mL). Similarly, removal of lovastatin from the medium within 24 hours after treatment allowed recovery of cell growth. The effect of lovastatin on cell growth was irreversible after 48 hours of exposure. The survival fraction of H2T cells was markedly decreased by 1- or 24-hour exposure to 75 micrograms/mL but not to doses ranging from 0.5 to 60 micrograms/mL of lovastatin. Growth of pancreatic carcinoma xenografts (CAV and H2T) in nude mice was inhibited by a subcutaneous infusion of lovastatin (50 micrograms/h). These results indicate that mevalonic acid or a metabolite in the cholesterol synthesis pathway is necessary for growth of pancreatic cancer cells and suggest that lovastatin should be further examined as a potential therapeutic agent for pancreatic cancer.", 
    "94": "The efficacy, safety profile, and tolerability of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors simvastatin and lovastatin were compared in a multicenter, randomized, double-blind study in patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia. Commonly prescribed doses of these two drugs were used by 544 men and women, who followed an American Heart Association phase I diet during a 6-week baseline period and for the 24 weeks of active treatment. Simvastatin 10 mg and lovastatin 20 mg produced statistically significant reductions in total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Patients receiving simvastatin 10 mg once daily and lovastatin 20 mg once daily experienced similar reductions in LDL-C and total cholesterol; however, simvastatin 20 mg was statistically superior to lovastatin 40 mg in decreasing these lipid fractions. For all treatment groups, increases in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were inversely related to baseline levels. Moderate decreases in triglycerides occurred with all doses. Lipoprotein(a) levels, measured in a subset of patients, were similar before and after treatment. Both drugs were well tolerated.", 
    "95": "Ras-related small GTP-binding proteins (SMGs) exist in a cytosolic and a membrane-bound pool. The mechanism regulating the intracellular distribution of SMGs remains to be elucidated. We have, therefore, investigated the properties of SMGs expressed in cells of the insulin-secreting lines RINm5F and HIT-T15. Phase-partitioning analysis revealed that smg25A/rab3A as well as all the SMGs in the 23-27 kDa range, labeled by radioactive GTP after blotting, were hydrophobic, regardless of their subcellular distribution. In contrast, the cytosolic forms of ADP ribosylation factor, rho, and CDC42 were hydrophilic. The cytosolic pool of the 23-27-kDa group, including smg25A/rab3A, sedimented in a sucrose density gradient as complexes with an apparent M(r) of about 80,000, whereas rho and CDC42 were recovered in 45-kDa complexes. ARF, however, was uncomplexed (M(r) close to 20,000). The 80-kDa aggregates were likely to be formed by 1:1 complexes with the regulatory protein smg25/GDP dissociation inhibitor (smg25/GDI). In fact, pure smg25/GDI by sucrose gradient exhibited a molecular mass of 55 kDa, but cosedimented with the 80-kDa complexes in cytosolic extracts of insulin-secreting cells. Moreover, purified smg25/GDI was able to extract the SMGs of the 23-27-kDa group from the membranes. Similarly, in cytosolic extracts, rho/GDI cosedimented with the 45-kDa aggregates. Blocking the synthesis of isoprenoid groups with lovastatin resulted in the appearance in the cytosol of SMGs that were hydrophilic. These SMGs were found to sediment with an apparent M(r) close to 25,000 and to be unable to form complexes with smg25/GDI. Lovastatin treatment also caused the accumulation of the noncomplexed form of CDC42 but not of rho proteins. We propose that 1) except for ARF, all the SMGs detected in the cytosol of insulin-secreting cells are associated in 1:1 complexes with their regulatory proteins; 2) the different SMGs can be subdivided into functional groups according to the regulatory protein bound to them; 3) the formation of the 80-kDa complexes with smg25/GDI and of the CDC42 complexes with rho/GDI necessitate the correct carboxyl-terminal post-translational modification of the SMGs.",

The key C-3 hydroxyl group is introduced via a Baeyer-Villiger reaction on the methyl ketone 17 which is obtained in three high-yielding steps from the known tricyclic lactone 12. In an isolated enzyme assay dihydroeptastatin had a similar IC50 to mevinolin but in cellular assays using Hep G2 and HES 9 cell lines, dihydroeptastatin was much less potent.

    "97": "The field change is one hypothesis concerning the development of colorectal carcinoma. Removal of a carcinoma without its entire surrounding altered mucosa may result in the development of a recurrence. S44, a monoclonal antibody directed against statin, a nuclear protein expressed in nonproliferating cells in either a quiescent or senescent state, was used to determine the rate of cell growth in colorectal mucosa at different distances from carcinomas. The specimens of 18 patients undergoing resection of a colorectal carcinoma were immediately opened after operation, and strips of mucosa were taken at distances of 1 cm, 5 cm, and 10 cm from the carcinoma. For each location, 10 longitudinally oriented crypts were evaluated for statin-positive cells identified by the presence of a dark brown peroxidase-conjugated antibody reaction product. The average percentage of statin-positive cells per crypt was significantly lower at a 1-cm distance from the carcinoma compared with the mucosa located 5 and 10 cm from the carcinoma (20.89 +/- 4.33 at 1 cm, 32.41 +/- 5.27 at 5 cm, and 34.23 +/- 6.45 at 10 cm). None of the calculated parameters showed any significant difference between the 5-cm and 10-cm locations. The fact that the proliferation rate of the mucosal cells returns to the normal level at 5 cm from the margin of the carcinoma suggests that cells located within this distance still retain proliferative potential even though they are morphologically indistinguishable from their normal counterparts. We conclude that failure to remove this transitional, potentially proliferative mucosa may result in subsequent development of anastomotic or perianastomotic recurrences.", 
    "98": "This case report describes a 51-year-old hypercholesterolemic male patient who had a large solitary cholesterol gallstone. The patient was treated with the 3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor pravastatin, 40 mg/day. After 3 months of therapy, serum cholesterol level normalized (7.7 mmol/L before and 5.2 mmol/L during treatment), and biliary cholesterol saturation index decreased from 1.3 before to 0.8 during treatment. Repeatedly performed ultrasonography showed complete gallstone dissolution. Pravastatin may be valuable in the nonsurgical treatment of cholesterol gallstone disease particularly when there is an additional indication for HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors because of hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "99": "Ortho,para,dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethane (o,p'DDD, Mitotane (Roussell)) is used as an adrenolytic drug to reduce adrenocortical mass and circulating cortisol levels in Cushing's syndrome but has the unwanted side-effect of inducing hypercholesterolaemia. This paper examined the mechanism of that effect in 30 patients with Cushing's syndrome treated with o,p'DDD during the past 10 years. o,p'DDD increased serum cholesterol by 68 per cent, mainly by increasing LDL-cholesterol. The latter effect was not due to impaired binding of LDL to its receptor, as shown in vitro using cultured fibroblasts. Increases in plasma mevalonic acid during o,p'DDD administration were suggestive of increased cholesterol synthesis, this effect being reversed by simvastatin. These findings suggest that o,p'DDD causes hypercholesterolaemia by increasing cholesterol synthesis. It is proposed that this effect is due to the drug's known ability to block cytochrome P450-mediated reactions, thus impairing the formation of oxysterols responsible for down-regulating hepatic cholesterol synthesis. Treatment with simvastatin, an inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis, reverses the hyperlipidaemia and enables o,p'DDD therapy to be maintained without increasing cardiovascular risk.",

The inhibitory properties of the R stereoisomer were determined in reactions with 3S and 3RS substrate and were shown to be of partially competitive type. Ki values of competitive inhibitors are shown to be approximately equal if determined with either stereochemically pure substrate or the diastereomeric 3RS mixture containing the inhibitory stereoisomer.", 
    "101": "We have compared the effects of lovastatin and simvastatin on plasma lipoproteins, fibrinogen and urinary mevalonic acid excretion in twenty-three patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. After a baseline period patients were randomly assigned to receive lovastatin or simvastatin at doses of 10, 20 and 40 mg twice daily, for a period of 2 months each, and then, after a 4-week wash-out period, all patients received the alternate drug for a similar period of therapy. Both drugs were well-tolerated and no patients were withdrawn due to side effects. Lipid values returned to baseline after discontinuation of therapy and no carry-over effect was observed. Treatment with lovastatin resulted in decreases in LDL cholesterol concentrations from 274 mg/dl at baseline to 211, 192 and 178 mg/dl, respectively, on doses of 20, 40 and 80 mg/day. Treatment with simvastatin reduced concentrations of LDL cholesterol to 194, 168 and 156 mg/dl, respectively, on doses of 20, 40 and 80 mg/day. Concentrations of HDL cholesterol increased on both drugs, but no dose response relationship was apparent. Both drugs reduced the 24-h urinary excretion of mevalonic acid, an intermediate in cholesterol biosynthesis, but the magnitude of decrease was similar with lovastatin and simvastatin. Small, but statistically non-significant decreases in fibrinogen occurred with both drugs. Patients who showed the greatest hypolipidemic effect during treatment with lovastatin also showed an excellent therapeutic response to simvastatin and vice versa. We conclude that, on a milligram per milligram basis, simvastatin is twice as potent as lovastatin in the treatment of familial hypercholesterolemia and that with both drugs, reductions in LDL cholesterol concentrations are accompanied by decreases in the urinary excretion of mevalonic acid.",

    "103": "In study 1, serum lipid and estrogen levels were determined in 30 women (aged 40 to > 60 years). Total cholesterol (TC) levels increased significantly with age, but no significant association was found between TC levels and menopausal status. Hypercholesterolemia (TC > 220 mg/dl) was identified in 10 women and hypertriglyceridemia (> 150 mg/dl) in 5 women. Among women not receiving estrogen replacement therapy, a significant negative correlation was found between TC levels and estradiol-17 beta levels. In study 2, serum lipid and estrogen levels were determined in 74 women; 12 of the 74 were receiving conjugated estrogen for the treatment of the menopausal syndrome and 21 hyperlipidemic women were receiving pravastatin (2.5 to 30 mg daily). Among postmenopausal women, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were significantly higher and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels significantly lower in the estrogen-treated than untreated women. Serum TC and LDL cholesterol levels were significantly reduced during pravastatin treatment. Levels of endogenous estrogens (estradiol-17 beta, estrone, and estrone sulfate) were not significantly affected by pravastatin treatment. The results indicate that pravastatin can be used to reduce hyperlipidemia in menopausal women without affecting endogenous estrogen levels.",

The further metabolism of the AA that is hereby enriched in the chylomicron remnant acylglycerols has not been investigated. In the present study, we examined the low density lipoprotein (LDL) dependent and independent metabolism of [14C]AA present in chylomicron remnants in the human hepatoma cell line Hep G2. Mesenteric duct cannulated rats were fed [14C]AA and [3H]cholesterol in corn oil, and the chyle obtained was injected intravenously into hepatectomized rats to form chylomicron remnants labeled with [14C]AA in the triacylglycerol (TG) and with 3H in the cholesteryl ester portion. The remnants were then incubated with Hep G2 cells. The uptake of [14C]AA within 2-4 h was similar to that of [3H]cholesteryl ester. After uptake into the cells, [14C]AA was preferentially incorporated into phospholipids, a high proportion being found in phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylinositol. [14C]AA and [3H]cholesteryl ester uptake were influenced to similar extents by factors unknown to regulate the LDL receptor and by an anti-LDL receptor antibody. Addition of compactin thus increased the uptake of [14C]AA by 50% in 4 h and mevalonolactone decreased the uptake by 86%. Using an anti-LDL receptor antibody, 25.0% of [3H]cholesterol/cholesteryl ester and 37.7% of [14C]AA binding to the cells at 4 degrees C were blocked.

A fast, simple and accurate method for determining SV and SVA concentrations in human plasma has been developed and validated for use in the analysis of plasma samples from patients and healthy volunteers. This method involves an extraction procedure using a mixture of acetonitrile-water and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with UV detection. The procedure was linear from 20 to 1000 ng ml-1 for SV and from 25 to 1000 ng ml-1 for SVA, respectively. The method was accurate with relative errors of 5.0, 2.1 and 3.2% for human plasma controls containing 50, 250 and 500 ng ml-1 of SV, respectively. The corresponding precision was 2.3, 1.8 and 1.0% (RSD%). Similarly, relative standard deviations less than 2.3% and relative errors of less than 5.2% were obtained from human plasma controls containing SVA at identical concentrations.

Lovastatin monotherapy (80 mg daily) for 12 weeks reduced serum cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides levels by 36%, 44% and 24% respectively. HDL-cholesterol level was increased by 12%. The addition of 16 g cholestyramine daily further increased the reduction of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels by 17% and 24% respectively. Addition of 1 g probucol daily decreased total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol levels by 9%, 5% and 27% respectively. Addition of omega-3-fatty acids (3.6 g daily) reduced total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides levels by 10%, 12% and 20% respectively.

    "107": "The effect of simvastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, on human glioma cell growth was investigated. When incubated with simvastatin, cell proliferation decreased in a concentration-dependent fashion, as measured by cell number and [3H]-thymidine incorporation into DNA (concentration producing 50% inhibition, 60 nM). The effect was detectable 12 h after cells were exposed to the drug and persisted for 2 days. Addition of mevalonate to cells exposed effect of simvastatin in combination with beta-interferon and N,N'-bis(2-chloroethyl)-N-nitrosourea, both antitumoral drugs, was also evaluated by cell growth inhibition assay. The concentration producing 50% inhibition for each of these drugs was 650 units/ml and 50 nM, respectively. Subliminal concentrations of beta-interferon or N,N'-bis(2-chloroethyl)-N-nitrosourea were incubated together with 1 nM simvastatin. The data were analyzed with the aid of an isobologram using the concept of an envelope of additivity. Simultaneous cell exposure to simvastatin with either N,N'-bis(2-chloroethyl)-N-nitrosourea or beta-interferon produced a strong synergistic inhibitory effect on cell proliferation. These data provide in vitro support for the possibility that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, utilized as plasma cholesterol-lowering agents, could potentiate the effect of antiblastic drugs on tumor growth.", 
    "108": "Our previous apolipoprotein (apo) B kinetic studies of miniature pigs fed fish oil (Maxepa) demonstrated that very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) apo B concentrations were markedly reduced but that low density lipoprotein (LDL) concentrations were only modestly lowered because of a threefold increase in the conversion of VLDL apo B to LDL. In the present study, the effect of Maxepa plus lovastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, on apo B metabolism was assessed. Miniature pigs (n = 6) were simultaneously injected with autologous 131I-VLDL and 125I-LDL after a diet of pig chow supplemented with 30 g/day of Maxepa and again after the addition of lovastatin, 30 mg/day. Kinetic data were analyzed by compartmental analysis with use of the CONSAM program. Compared with Maxepa alone, the addition of lovastatin reduced VLDL apo B concentrations by 21% (p less than 0.003) because of reduced VLDL apo B production (26%, p less than 0.005), as the fractional clearance rate was not affected. Conversion of VLDL apo B to LDL was reduced by 48% (p less than 0.005), and the direct removal of VLDL apo B from plasma was reduced by 25% (p less than 0.01). Maxepa plus lovastatin reduced LDL apo B concentrations by 44% (p less than 0.004). This was due to a 38% (p less than 0.002) decrease in LDL production, which was primarily derived from VLDL. The LDL apo B fractional catabolic rate was not significantly changed. Thus, a combination of Maxepa and lovastatin reduces both VLDL and LDL apo B concentrations, primarily by decreasing production rates.", 
    "109": "Saccharomyces cerevisiae sterol and heme auxotrophs were used to elucidate a role for hemes in sterol esterification. Steryl ester synthase (SES) activity was stimulated on average fourfold in cells supplemented with 50 micrograms/ml delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA). This stimulation was not dependent on ALA per se, but on the ability of this precursor to effect heme competency. The addition of ALA stimulated SES activity of yeast on either fermentative or respiratory carbon sources. The elevation of SES activity was independent of intracellular free sterol, unsaturated fatty acid, or methionine levels. SES activity increases as the cells enter stationary phase, and this increase is enhanced by heme competency. SES was directly inhibited by the hypocholesterolemic drug lovastatin (mevinolin). The inhibition of SES activity by lovastatin was enhanced in heme-competent cells.", 
    "110": "Restenosis remains a critical limitation of percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). Recent experimental and clinical data have suggested that lovastatin, an hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, may reduce the rate of restenosis through reduction of low density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol or possibly by direct effects. Lovastatin may therefore produce favorable alterations in endothelial healing, resulting in a decreased smooth muscle cell proliferative response to injury after angioplasty. Emory University, in conjunction with Merck Research Laboratories, has initiated a 10-center double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized trial to assess the effect of both pretreatment and aggressive lipid lowering with lovastatin in reducing the rate of restenosis. Lovastatin achieves approximately 75% of its effect on LDL cholesterol by 1 week. Thus, patients scheduled for PTCA are randomly assigned pretreatment with lovastatin, 40 mg twice daily, or placebo 7 to 10 days before PTCA. Therapy is continued for 6 months, at which time repeat coronary arteriography is performed. A detailed safety algorithm was designed, with patients receiving lovastatin and matching placebo back-titrated on a 1:1 basis for LDL cholesterol less than 50 mg/dl. The power is a 90%, alpha = 0.05, 2-tailed test to reduce restenosis from 30 to 15%.

Pravastatin sodium is a new 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Its structural formula is similar to those of lovastatin and simvastatin, but it is active in the parent form. It competitively inhibits HMG-CoA reductase, reduces hepatic cellular cholesterol synthesis, increases the expression of hepatic low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors, and reduces hepatic very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) synthesis. Pravastatin has been demonstrated to reduce cholesterol in patients with familial and nonfamilial polygenic hypercholesterolemia and patients with diabetes mellitus. In doses of 10-40 mg/day, pravastatin has been shown to reduce total cholesterol by 15-30% and LDL cholesterol by 15-40%. It also increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 2-20% and reduces triglycerides. It is generally well tolerated, with few adverse effects reported in clinical trials. Pravastatin reduces LDL cholesterol and increases HDL cholesterol comparably to lovastatin but possibly with fewer adverse effects. Further studies and clinical use will be needed to confirm potential differences in adverse effect profiles between the two drugs.", 
    "113": "A novel anti-tumour amphibian oocyte RNase, ONCONASER (ONC), previously known as P-30 Protein, is in the clinical trials. The effect of ONC alone and in combination with lovastatin (LVT), an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, a rate-limiting enzyme of mevalonate (MVA) and cholesterol synthesis pathway, in three human tumour cell lines ASPC-1 pancreatic, A-549 lung, and HT-520 lung carcinomas, has been presently studied. A synergism between ONC and LVT in inducing the cytostatic and cytotoxic effects was observed. The cytostatic effect, seen during the early phase of the treatment with this combination of drugs was manifested as prolongation of the cell cycle duration, especially of the G1 phase; cell death was apparent after 72 h of treatment. The synergistic effect of ONC and LVT was also evident in the clonogenicity assays. Both LVT lactone and its in vitro activated beta-hydroxy acid form, alone and in respective combinations with ONC, exerted similar degree of growth suppression. The effects of both forms of LVT (used alone or in combination with ONC) were reversed by MVA, which suggests that HMG-CoA reductase inhibition is a primary mechanism of LVT action. The data indicate that the LVT lactone can be activated intracellularly by tumour cells studied, and that the combination of ONC with LVT can produce significantly enhanced anti-tumour activities.", 
    "114": "Simavastatin (MK-733, Zocor, CAS 79902-63-9), a new 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, was administered for a period of at least 3 years to 21 patients suffering from primary hypercholesterolemia. Significant decreases were noted for plasma cholesterol (30%), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (40%), whereas an increase in plasma high density lipoprotein cholesterol (11%) was observed. The drug therapy was well tolerated and clinical examinations revealed no adverse effects. No development of cataracts or other ocular side effects have been observed during this 3-year follow-up period.", 
    "115": "1. A group of 21 to 24-kDa proteins of pheochromocytoma (PC-12) cells was found in blot overlay assays to bind specifically [alpha-32P]GTP. Binding was inhibited by GTP analogues but not by ATP. Such small GTP-binding proteins were found in the cytosolic and in the particulate fraction of the cells, but they were unevenly distributed: about 75% of the small GTP-binding proteins were localized within the particulate fraction of the cells. Separation of these proteins by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed the existence of seven distinct [alpha-32P]GTP-binding proteins. 2. Targeting of the small GTP-binding proteins to the particulate fraction of PC-12 cells requires modification by isoprenoids, since depleting the cells of the isoprenoid precursor mevalonic acid (MVA) by the use of lovastatin resulted in a 50% decrease in membrane-bound small GTP-binding proteins, with a proportionate increase in the cytosolic form. This blocking effect of lovastatin was reversed by exogenously added MVA. 3. In addition, metabolic labeling of PC-12 cells with [3H]MVA revealed incorporation of [3H]MVA metabolites into the cluster of 21 to 24-kDa proteins in a form typical of isoprenoids; the label was not removed from the proteins by hydroxylamine, and labeling was enhanced in cells incubated with lovastatin. The latter effect reflects a decrease in the isotopic dilution of the exogenously added [3H]MVA, as the addition of exogenous MVA reversed the effect of lovastatin on [3H]MVA-metabolite incorporation into the 21 to 24-kDa proteins. 4. Additional experiments demonstrated that isoprenylation is required not only for membrane association of small GTP-binding proteins, but also for their further modification by a methylation enzyme. This was evident in experiments in which the cells were metabolically labeled with [methyl-3H]methionine, a methylation precursor. The group of 21 to 24-kDa proteins was labeled with a methyl-3H group in a form typical of C-terminal-cysteinyl carboxylmethyl esters. Their methylation was blocked by the methylation inhibitors methylthioadenosine (MTA), 3-deazadenosine and homocysteine thiolactone as well as by lovastatin. MVA reversed the lovastatin block of methylation. 5. Two-dimensional gel analysis of the [3H]methylated proteins detected seven methylated small GTP-binding proteins that correspond to the isoprenylated proteins. Levels of the small GTP-binding proteins as well as isoprenylation and methylation were reduced by cycloheximide. 6. Distribution of the methylated proteins between particulate and cytosolic fractions was found to be similar to that of the small GTP-binding proteins (i.e., a 4:1 ratio).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)", 
    "116": "We have determined the effect of lovastatin alone or in combination with cholestyramine on lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] levels in 59 heterozygotes for familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) treated for 33.8 (+/- 6.1) months. The median pretrial Lp(a) value was 10.2 mg/100 ml, which is twice the median value in healthy people examined at the Institute of Medical Genetics, University of Oslo. The median Lp(a) level was insignificantly reduced by 10.3% during the first 20 weeks when the subjects were on a standardized medication of increasing doses of lovastatin and cholestyramine. The first 20 weeks were followed by usual care treatment period, and a further decrease in Lp(a) level to 16.2% (P = 0.0012) was observed at the end of the study. Comparison between the 20 subjects on lovastatin monotherapy and the 31 subjects on the combined therapy of lovastatin and cholestyramine, revealed that the subjects on monotherapy had a median reduction of 20.1%, and the subjects on the combined therapy had a reduction of 15.4%. Thus, it appears that the reduction in Lp(a) level could be ascribed to lovastatin alone."
