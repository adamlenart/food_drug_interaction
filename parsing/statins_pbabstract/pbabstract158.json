Human studies are limited, with one observational study showing benefits, but results from small, short-term randomized trials have been conflicting. A study with pravastatin showed general benefits on both biomarkers and lung physiology, whereas the Simvastatin as a Treatment for Pulmonary Hypertension Trial with simvastatin added to PDE-5 inhibitors and endothelin-1 antagonists showed transient improvement in biomarkers but not in physiological markers over 1 year.

The papillary thyroid carcinoma (B-CPAP) and normal (Nthy-ori 3-1) thyroid cell lines were treated with rosuvastatin at 12.5, 18.5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 \u03bcM concentrations. After 48 and 72 h of rosuvastatin treatment, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide, Ki-67 immunolabeling, FACS analysis, electron microscopy, caspase-3, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) analysis were performed. Decreased cell viability and G1 phase arrest were detected in papillary thyroid cell line treated with rosuvastatin. Positive immunoreactivity of Ki-67 and dose-dependent increase in S phase on Nthy-ori 3-1 cells were also detected. B-CPAP cells showed intense vacuolisation and autophagosomes with low concentrations and 48 h incubations, while Nthy-ori 3-1 cells showed these changes at higher concentrations. A decrease in the percentage of cells showing autophagy was determined with increasing concentrations of rosuvastatin in B-CPAP cells. Rosuvastatin treatment also caused a dose- and time-dependent increase in caspase-3 activity and apoptotic index by TUNEL assay in B-CPAP cells compared with the Nthy-ori 3-1 cells. Apoptotic cells with nuclear condensation and fragmentation were observed in B-CPAP cell line. Rosuvastatin induced autophagic changes in B-CPAP papillary thyroid cancer cells in lower doses and caused a shift from autophagy to apoptosis. Rosuvastatin may be an alternative treatment for refractory papillary thyroid cancer. Further in vivo studies are necessary to clarify the effects of rosuvastatin in papillary thyroid carcinoma and the clinical implications of rosuvastatin treatment.",

Statins decrease inflammation and improve endothelial function in cardiovascular disease, but their effect in SCD is not known. In this pilot study, we examined the safety and effect of short-term simvastatin on biomarkers of vascular dysfunction in SCD. We treated 26 SCD patients with simvastatin, 20 or 40 mg/d, for 21 d. Plasma nitric oxide metabolites (NOx), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), tissue factor (TF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were analyzed and responses to simvastatin were compared between the two treatment groups. Simvastatin increased NOx levels by 23% in the low-dose (P =0\u00b701) and 106% in the moderate-dose (P =0\u00b701) groups, and by 52% overall (P=0\u00b70008). CRP decreased similarly in both dose groups and by 68% overall (P =0\u00b702). Levels of IL-6 decreased by 50% (P=0\u00b704) and 71% (P<0\u00b705) in the low- and moderate-dose groups, respectively. Simvastatin had no effect on VEGF, VCAM1 or TF. Simvastatin was well-tolerated and safe. Our preliminary findings showing a dose-related effect of simvastatin on levels of NOx, CRP and IL-6 suggest a potential therapeutic role for simvastatin in SCD.",

From neurosphere formation in culture, time-lapse microscopic video recording, and tumor xenograft, we show that DCX synthesis significantly reduces self-renewal of brain tumor stem cells (BTSC) in human primary glioma (YU-PG, HF66) cells from surgically removed human glioma specimens and U87 cells in vitro and in vivo. Time-lapse microscopic video recording revealed that double transfection of YU-PG, HF66, and U87 cells with DCX and neurabin II caused incomplete cell cycle with failure of cytokinesis, that is, endomitosis by dividing into three daughter cells from one mother BTSC. Activation of c-jun NH2-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) after simvastatin (10\u2003nM) treatment of DCX(+) neurabin II(+) BTSC from YU-PG, HF66, and U87 cells induced terminal differentiation into neuron-like cells. dUTP nick end labeling data indicated that JNK1 activation also induced apoptosis only in double transfected BTSC with DCX and neurabin II, but not in single transfected BTSC from YU-PG, HF66, and U87 cells. Western blot analysis showed that procaspase-3 was induced after DCX transfection and activated after simvastatin treatment in YU-PG, HF66, and U87 BTSC. Sequential immunoprecipitation and Western blot data revealed that DCX synthesis blocked protein phosphatase-1 (PP1)/caspase-3 protein-protein interaction and increased PP1-DCX interaction. These data show that DCX synthesis induces apoptosis in BTSC through a novel JNK1/neurabin II/DCX/PP1/caspase-3 pathway.", 
    "13": "Elevated levels of lipoprotein(a) are causally related to premature atherosclerosis. It is therefore of interested to evaluate by which treatment modalities elevated lipoprotein(a) levels can be decreased. With the exception of niacin, currently available lipid modifying drugs have only little effect on lipoprotein(a) levels. Niacin can decrease lipoprotein(a) concentration in a dose dependent fashion by approximately 20-30%. Similarly, acetylsalicylic acid and L-carnitine as well as some medications in development (mipomersen, eprotirome, Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK-9) inhibitors, Cholesterol-ester-transfer protein (CETP inhibitors) can decrease elevated lipoprotein(a) concentrations. It is unclear whether this lipoprotein(a) reduction also translates into a decreased cardio-vascular morbidity or mortality. Estrogen (with or without progesterone) and tibolone but not tamoxifene or raloxifene can also decrease elevated lipoprotein(a) concentrations. The most dramatic change in lipoprotein(a) concentration can be achieved with regular lipid apheresis.",

Patients were randomized to two treatment groups: group A with low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) target of < 100 mg/dl and group B with a target of < 130 mg/dl. Atorvastatin was used in both groups on top of optimal multifactorial treatment, (quinapril, amlodipine, hydrochlorothiazide for hypertension, metformin for impaired fasting glucose, and orlistat for obesity). The e-CVD risk was calculated using the Framingham, the PROCAM and Reynold's equations.",

Although statin therapy is generally considered safe, a number of known adverse effects do occur, most commonly treatment-associated muscular pain. In vitro evidence also supports the potential for drug-drug interactions involving this class of agents, and to examine this a ligand-binding assay was used to determine the ability of six clinically used statins for their ability to directly activate the nuclear receptors pregnane X-receptor (PXR), farnesoid X-receptor (FXR) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), demonstrating a relative activation of PXR>FXR>CAR. Using reporter gene constructs, we demonstrated that this order of activation is mirrored at the transcriptional activation level, with PXR-mediated gene activation being pre-eminent. Finally, we described a novel regulatory loop, whereby activation of FXR by statins increases PXR reporter gene expression, potentially enhancing PXR-mediated responses. Delineating the molecular interactions of statins with nuclear receptors is an important step in understanding the full biological consequences of statin exposure. This demonstration of their ability to directly activate nuclear receptors, leading to nuclear receptor cross-talk, has important potential implications for their use within a polypharmacy paradigm.",

Statin treatment alone or in combination with other drugs has a substantially beneficial effect on CVD morbidity and mortality. The question was if these regimens were harmful for the liver. Mounting data suggest that statin monotherapy or statin-based treatments are safe in patients with NAFLD and can improve liver tests and liver ultrasonographic evidence of NAFLD. Recent data suggest that statin-based therapies are beneficial to the liver and at the same time reduce CVD morbidity and mortality in patients with NAFLD more than in subjects without it. These findings suggest that with statins we are able to get two birds with one stone.",

THA also caused a reduction in weight gain very similar to orlistat (40 and 38\u200a%, respectively) when the animals were submitted to a high-fat diet. Moreover, THA showed a stronger and continuous pancreatic lipase inhibitory activity when compared with orlistat, causing inhibition of this enzyme during 6 hours associated to a significant reduction of triglyceride serum levels.

    "47": "Special AT-rich sequence binding protein 1 (SATB1) regulates the expression of more than 1,000 genes in tumor cells. SATB1 expression has been implicated in metastasis, and its silencing results in reduced cancer progression and the reversion of metastatic cells to normal appearance. Therefore, any compound causing down-regulation of SATB1 expression or activity may be exploited for its therapeutic potential in terms of cancer regression. Earlier studies showed that the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzymeA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statin drugs), which are widely used to treat hypercholesterolemia, possess other pleotropic activities. These are now increasingly gaining attention for their cancer prevention abilities. However, the downstream interplay of the molecular mechanisms of such anti-cancer activities is unclear. Here, we show that SATB1 is down-regulated by statins in a time- and dose-dependent manner in COLO205 cells. This effect was statin-specific as the down-regulation of SATB1 was brought about by hydrophobic statins, such as simvastatin and fluvastatin, but not by hydrophilic pravastatin. Notably, treatment with mevalonate, an intermediate in the cholesterol and isoprenoid biosynthetic pathways, led to the inhibition of SATB1 down-regulation and cytotoxicity mediated by statins. Treatment with the proteasome inhibitors lactacystine and MG-132 inhibited the statin-mediated down-regulation of SATB1, suggesting that regulation occurs at the post-translational level. Thus, our results demonstrate a novel molecular mechanism for the anti-cancer activity of statin drugs in colon cancer cells, without invoking significant cytotoxicity.",

Treatment with statins can significantly reduce CVD events and mortality in both primary and secondary prevention. Yet despite the high CVD risk among the elderly, there is underutilization of statins in this population (ie, the treatment-risk paradox). Few studies have investigated the use of statins in the elderly, particularly for primary prevention and, as a result, guidelines for treating the elderly are limited. This is likely due to: uncertainties of risk assessment in older individuals where the predictive value of individual risk factors is decreased; the need to balance the benefits of primary prevention with the risks of polypharmacy, health care costs, and adverse medication effects in a population with decreased life expectancy; the complexity of treating patients with many other comorbidities; and increasingly difficult social and economic concerns. As life expectancy increases and the total elderly population grows, these issues become increasingly important. JUPITER (Justification for the Use of statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin) is the largest primary prevention statin trial to date and enrolled a substantial number of elderly adults.

Despite some controversies exist, the use of statins has been shown to improve both incidence and survival in acute ischemic stroke. The molecular mechanisms underlying statin-mediated clinical benefits were recently identified in the reduction of carotid plaque vulnerability and the increase of neuroprotection. In the present review, we will update evidence on the promising results with statins to improve ischemic stroke outcomes.", 
    "58": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor statins are used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. However, statins have adverse effects on skeletal muscles with unknown mechanism. We have reported previously that fluvastatin induced vacuolation and cell death in rat skeletal myofibers by depleting geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP) and suppressing small GTPases, particularly Rab (FASEB J 21:4087-4094, 2007). Rab1 is one of the most susceptible Rab isoforms to GGPP depletion and is essential for endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-to-Golgi trafficking. Here, we explored whether Rab1 and ER-to-Golgi vesicle trafficking were affected by statins in cultured single myofibers isolated from flexor digitorum brevis muscles of adult rats. Western blot analysis revealed that Rab1A protein resided predominantly in membrane but not in cytosol in control myofibers, whereas it was opposite in fluvastatin-treated myofibers, indicating that fluvastatin inhibited Rab1A translocation from cytosol to membrane. GGPP supplementation prevented the effect of fluvastatin on Rab1A translocation. Brefeldin A, a specific suppressor of ER-to-Golgi trafficking, induced vacuolation and cell death in myofibers in a manner similar to that of fluvastatin. Although ER-to-Golgi traffic suppression induces unfolded protein response (UPR) and cell death in some cell types, neither fluvastatin nor brefeldin A up-regulated UPR in myofibers. Immunofluorescence study revealed that the distribution of an ER marker, calnexin, was restricted to the region around nucleus with fluvastatin, suggesting the inhibition of ER membrane traffic by fluvastatin. We conclude that suppression of Rab1 GTPase and the subsequent inhibition of ER-to-Golgi traffic are involved in statin-induced skeletal myotoxicity.", 
    "59": "Lipid lowering with statins improves morbidity and mortality, particularly in diabetics, and may have additional nonlipid effects. South Asians (SAs) are at higher risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes compared with white Europeans (WEs). We hypothesized that abnormal endothelial (marked by von Willebrand factor), angiogenesis (VEGF, angiopoietins 1 and 2) and platelet function (soluble P selectin, soluble CD40L) improve with statin treatment in diabetics in different ethnic groups. Plasma was obtained before and 8 weeks after treatment with atorvastatin (80 mg/day) by SAs and WEs with or without diabetes. Research indices were measured by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Treatment increased angiopoietin-2 (P < .04) in all groups regardless of diabetes or ethnicity. In those free of diabetes, angiopoietin-2 increased 3-fold, whereas in diabetes, it increased 2-fold. We suggest that an additional effect of statins is to increase levels of growth factor angiopoietin-2 in the direction of normality. This effect is weaker in participants with diabetes.",

We used linear mixed-effects models including random subject intercepts and adjusted for several potential confounders. We used inverse probability of response weighting to adjust for potential selection bias due to loss to follow-up. An IQR increase in annual BC (0.25 microg/m3) was associated with a 7.6% decrease (95% confidence interval, -12.8 to -2.1) in LTL. We found evidence of effect modification, with a stronger association among subjects > or = 75 years of age compared with younger participants (p = 0.050) and statin medications appearing protective of the effects of BC on LTL (p = 0.050).",

A fixed-dose combination of extended-release niacin (ERN) with laropiprant (LRPT) provides comprehensive lipid management. We adapted a decision-analytic model to evaluate the economic value (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER] in terms of costs per life-years gained [LYG]) of ERN/LRPT 2 g over a lifetime in secondary prevention patients in a German setting. Two scenarios were modelled: (1) ERN/LRPT 2 g added to simvastatin 40 mg in patients not at LDL-C goal with simvastatin 40 mg; (2) adding ERN/LRPT 2 g compared with titration to simvastatin 40 mg in patients not at LDL-C goal with simvastatin 20 mg. In both scenarios, adding ERN/LRPT was cost-effective relative to simvastatin monotherapy at a commonly accepted threshold of \u20ac30,000 per LYG; ICERs for ERN/LRPT were \u20ac13,331 per LYG in scenario 1 and \u20ac17,684 per LYG in scenario 2. Subgroup analyses showed that ERN/LRPT was cost-effective in patients with or without diabetes, patients aged \u2264 65 or >65 years and patients with low baseline high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels; ICERs ranged from \u20ac10,342 to \u20ac15,579 in scenario 1, and from \u20ac14,081 to \u20ac20,462 in scenario 2. In conclusion, comprehensive lipid management with ERN/LRPT 2 g is cost-effective in secondary prevention patients in Germany who have not achieved LDL-C goal with simvastatin monotherapy.", 
    "67": "Whether Simvastatin has beneficial effect on pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH) remains unclear. This study aimed to explore the effect of simvastatin on PAH and the underlying mechanism. Male SD rats were randomized into three groups: control group, PAH model group, and treatment group with the intervention of the Simvastatin (n = 10, each group). Rat PVSMCs were isolated from pulmonary artery, cultured in vitro, and subjected to different treatment with PDGF, and/or Simvastatin or parthenolide. The mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP), endomembrane proliferation in the pneumono-arteriole, and scores of the average angiemphraxis (VOS) were measured. The expression of NF-\u03baB at mRNA and protein levels in the artery and PVSMCs was evaluated by fluorescent quantitative PCR, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot. Our results showed that mPAP, endomembrane proliferation in the pneumono-arteriole and VOS increased significantly in PAH model group compared with control group (P < 0.05). NF-\u03baB expression was significantly higher in PAH model group than control group (P < 0.05), and also higher in the stimulated PVSMCs than control PVSMCs (P < 0.05). With the intervention of simvastatin, mPAP, endomembrane proliferation in the pneumono-arteriole and VOS decreased dramatically, compared with model group (P < 0.05). NF-\u03baB expression was significantly decreased in both the artery and PVSMCs (P < 0.05). In conclusion, our study provides experimental evidence that NF-\u03baB plays an important role in the occurrence of pulmonary artery hypertension and Simvastatin has beneficial effect on pulmonary artery hypertension by inhibiting the expression of NF-\u03baB.",

Occurrence of periprocedural myocardial infarction, defined as postintervention creatine kinase-MB increase \u22653 times the upper limit of normal, and 30-day major adverse cardiac events (death, myocardial infarction, target-vessel revascularization) was evaluated. Incidence of periprocedural myocardial infarction was 7.0% in the high-dose statin versus 11.9% in the control group, which corresponds to a 44% risk reduction in the active-treatment arm (odds ratio by fixed-effects model 0.56, 95% confidence interval, 0.44 to 0.71, P<0.00001). The rate of major adverse cardiac events at 30 days was significantly lower in the high-dose statin group (7.4% versus 12.6%, a 44% risk reduction; P<0.00001), and 1-month major adverse cardiac events, excluding periprocedural events, were also reduced (0.6% versus 1.4%; P=0.05). The benefit of high-dose statins was realized irrespective of clinical presentation (P for interaction=0.43) and was maintained across various subgroups but appeared greater in the subgroup with elevated baseline C-reactive protein levels (n=734; 68% risk reduction for periprocedural myocardial infarction versus 31% in those 1861 patients with normal CRP; P for quantitative interaction=0.025).",

Recent data suggest that statins influence metabolic bone activity by their actions on three molecules: RANKL; RANK; and osteoprotegerin (OPG), the soluble decoy receptor for RANKL. The purpose of this study was to evaluate OPG and RANKL production in resting and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2)-activated human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs), and to determine the effect of statins on their production.",

There was a trend towards an increase in RANKL production as a result of stimulation with IL-1\u03b2. Both statins, at multiple concentrations, significantly increased the constitutive RANKL/OPG ratio. Only atorvastatin at the highest concentration (5\u00d710(-6) \u2003m) significantly increased the IL-1\u03b2-stimulated RANKL/OPG ratio.",

Both statins increased constitutive RANKL/OPG ratios, but generally not IL-1\u03b2-stimulated ratios. Thus, statins may influence the production of RANKL and OPG by HGFs to favor bone catabolism, under noninflammatory conditions.", 
    "75": "Lovastatin exhibits higher thermal stability and lower degradation rate than simvastatin. However, the amount of research studying a lovastatin delivery device has been far less than similar research on simvastatin. As a consequence, a high lovastatin release rate system has not been developed. We hypothesized that highly efficient release of lovastatin from poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles in a short-term release (7 days) could provide an effective delivery system for bone repair. This study optimized the emulsion (o/w) technique in the fabrication process for PLGA nanoparticles, thereby producing the first recorded case of a high release rate (97%) of lovastatin. We also calculated the calibration curve of lovastatin using a UV spectrometer. The results demonstrated that the ALPase activity in human osteoblasts could be significantly stimulated by lovastatin carried in PLGA nanoparticles, but was prominently decreased by free lovastatin with the concentration higher than 4\u2009\u00b5g/ml. Animal studies showed that the amount of lovastatin contained in 1\u2009mg PLGA was the optimum dosage. These results suggest the new lovastatin-releasing PLGA delivery device exhibits potential for clinical treatment of bony defects.",

Patients receiving an e-prescription with FDS were 59% more likely to achieve LDL goal than those with a manual prescription (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.12-2.25). Superior LDL goal attainment may be from lower cost of medications; patients with an e-prescription were significantly more likely to receive a generic statin than patients with a manual prescription (38% vs 22.9%; P = 0.0004), and for each $10 increase in prescription price, the likelihood of being at goal decreased by 5% (odds ratio = 0.95; 95% CI: 0.93-0.98).",

Methods. Forty Wistar rats (111.06 \u00b1 3.36\u2009g) were divided into 4 groups (A1, A2 controls, B1, B2 experimental). Groups A1 and A2 consumed normal cereal rodents diet during the experimental hyperlipidemic mixture. The A2 and B2 were treated with simvastatin (Zocor) 40\u2009mg/kg/daily p.o. for 3 months. Results. Total cholesterol, triglycerides, high density lipoproteins, and low density lipoproteins were increased in groups B1 and B2 while the parotid weight was decreased. The histological findings demonstrated changes in the parotid gland morphology of the B1 and B2, such as the presence of chronic inflammation, fibrosis, lipocytes, and foci of lymphocytic infiltration. Conclusions. The influence of statin tended to predominate over the chronic inflammation while the lipocytes were decreased and remodelling of the parotid's structure occurred.", 
    "82": "Antiinflammatory effect of statins mediated by the reduction of cytokine IL-6 in hepatocytes have been reported. Contrary to beneficial effect, statins can increase susceptibility to mitochondrial dysfunction. Extrahepatic biliary obstruction is associated with oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory response and hepatocyte mitochondrial dysfunction. The aim of our study was to verify the effect of fluvastatin on cholestatic liver injury. Cholestasis was induced in Wistar rats by bile duct ligation. Fluvastatin (1 or 5 mg/kg) was administered after surgery and then daily for 7 days. The dose of 5 mg/kg led to the deterioration of hepatocellular injury. Despite lower production of IL-6, decrease in GSH content, rise of TGF\u00df and inhibition of respiratory complex I in mitochondria were determined. The mRNA expressions of canalicular transporter Mdr1b and basolateral transporter Mrp3 increased in cholestatic liver. Fluvastatin administration then led to the attenuation of this change. Analogously, mRNA expression of conjugative enzyme Ugt1a1 was diminished by fluvastatin administration to cholestatic rats. We can conclude that decrease in the antioxidative status and mitochondrial dysfunction could at least in part participate on the deteriorating effect of fluvastatin. Whether these processes can be a consequence of the alteration in metabolism and transport of potentially toxic substances remains to verify.",

A Markov model was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of treatments taking into account adherence and the likely reduction in cost for atorvastatin when the patent expires. There is a clear dose-response: rosuvastatin 40\u2009mg/day produces the greatest reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (56%) followed by atorvastatin 80\u2009mg/day (52%), and simvastatin 40\u2009mg/day (37%). Using a threshold of \u00a320,000 per QALY, if adherence levels in general practice are similar to those observed in RCTs, all three higher dose statins would be considered cost-effective compared to simvastatin 40\u2009mg/day. Using the net benefits of the treatments, rosuvastatin 40\u2009mg/day is estimated to be the most cost-effective alternative.

    "132": "Vascular calcification is strongly linked with increased morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease. Vascular calcification is an active cell-mediated process that involves the differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) to an osteoblast-like phenotype. Several inhibitors of this process have been identified, including insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I). In this study, we examined the role of the IGF receptor (IGFR) and the importance of IGFR glycosylation in the maintenance of the VSMC phenotype in the face of factors known to promote osteogenic conversion. IGF-I (25 ng/ml) significantly protected VSMCs from \u03b2-glycerophosphate-induced osteogenic differentiation (p < 0.005) and mineral deposition (p < 0.01). Mevalonic acid depletion (induced by 100 nm cerivastatin) significantly inhibited these IGF protective effects (p < 0.01). Mevalonic acid depletion impaired IGFR processing, decreased the expression of mature IGFRs at the cell surface, and inhibited the downstream activation of Akt and MAPK. Inhibitors of N-linked glycosylation (tunicamycin, deoxymannojirimycin, and deoxynojirimycin) also markedly attenuated the inhibitory effect of IGF-I on \u03b2-glycerophosphate-induced mineralization (p < 0.05) and activation of Akt and MAPK. These results demonstrate that alterations in the glycosylation of the IGFR disrupt the ability of IGF-I to protect against the osteogenic differentiation and mineralization of VSMCs by several interrelated mechanisms: decreased IGFR processing, reduced IGFR cell-surface expression, and reduced downstream signaling via the Akt and MAPK pathways. IGF-I thus occupies a critical position in the maintenance of normal VSMC phenotype and protection from factors known to stimulate vascular calcification.",

Long-term drug prevention aiming to minimize disease progression and CV events in these subjects is probably beneficial, but expensive. The purpose of this analysis was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of pharmacological risk reduction in subclinical PAD. Long-term costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated by employing a decision-analytic model for ACE-inhibitor, statin, aspirin and non-aspirin anti-platelet therapy. Rates of CV events without treatment were derived from epidemiological studies and event rate reduction were retrieved from clinical trials. Costs and health-related quality of life estimates were obtained from published sources. All four drugs reduced CV events. Using ACE-inhibition resulted in a heart rate (HR) of 0.67 (95% CI: 0.55-0.79), statins 0.74 (0.70-0.79), and clopidogrel 0.72 (0.43-1.00). Aspirin had a HR of 0.87 and the 95% CI passed included one (0.72-1.03). ACE-inhibition was associated with the largest reduction in events leading to the highest gain in QALYs (7.95). Furthermore, ACE-inhibitors were associated with the lowest mean cost \u20ac40.556. In conclusion, while all drugs reduced CV events, ACE-inhibition was the most cost-effective. These results suggest that we should consider efforts to identify patients with asymptomatic PAD and, when identified, offer ACE-inhibition.",

While treatment with PMA increased MMP-9 and TIMP-1 levels (by 556% and 159%, respectively; both P < 0.05), it exerted no effects on MMP-2 and TIMP-2 levels. Simvastatin and atorvastatin, but not pravastatin, attenuated PMA-induced increases in MMP-9 levels (P < 0.05). Only atorvastatin decreased baseline MMP-2 levels significantly (P < 0.05). We found no effects on TIMP-2 levels. Simvastatin and atorvastatin, but not pravastatin, decreased MMP-9/TIMP-1 ratio significantly (both P < 0.05), whereas atorvastatin and pravastatin, but not simvastatin, decreased MMP-2/TIMP-2 ratio significantly (both P < 0.05). Our data support the notion that statins with different physicochemical features exert variable effects on MMP/TIMP ratios (which reflect net MMP activity). Our results suggest that more lipophilic statins (simvastatin and atorvastatin), but not the hydrophilic statin pravastatin, downregulate net MMP-9 activity. However, atorvastatin and pravastatin may downregulate net MMP-2 activity. The clinical implications of the present findings deserve further investigation.",

Therefore in this work we study the effect of time, temperature as well as concentration on the loading of pravastatin in human erythrocytes to be using them as systemic sustained release delivery system for this drug. After the loading process is performed the carriers' erythrocytes were physically and cellulary characterized. Also, the in vitro release of pravastatin from carrier erythrocytes was studied over time interval. Our results revealed that, human erythrocytes have been successfully loaded with pravastatin using endocytosis method either at 25(o)C or at 37(o)C. The loaded amount at 10 mg/ml is 0.32 mg/0.1 ml and 0.69 mg/0.1 ml. Entrapment efficiency is 34% and 94% at 25(o)C and 37(o)C respectively at drug concentration 4 mg/ml. Moreover the percent of cells recovery is 87-93%. Hematological parameters and osmotic fragility behavior of pravastatin loaded erythrocytes were similar that of native erythrocytes. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that the pravastatin loaded cells has no change in the morphology. Pravastatin releasing from carrier cell was 83% after 23 hours in phosphate buffer saline and decreased to 72% by treatment of carrier cells with glutaraldehyde. The releasing pattern of the drug from loaded erythrocytes obeyed first order kinetics. It concluded that pravastatin is successfully entrapped into erythrocytes with acceptable loading parameters and moderate morphological changes, this suggesting that erythrocytes can be used as prolonged release for pravastatin.",

The compound was withdrawn from the market in 1998 because of the potential for rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, or bradycardia when it was coadministered with other drugs. Mibefradil has previously been shown to be a potent reversible (IC(50) = 0.3-2 \u03bcM) and mechanism-based (K(i) = 2.3 \u03bcM; k(inact) = 0.4 min(-1)) inhibitor of CYP3A4-catalyzed statin metabolism. At present, the mechanism of CYP3A4 inactivation by mibefradil is not known. Mechanism-based inactivation experiments and spectral studies were used to examine the mechanism of CYP3A4 inactivation by mibefradil and its major metabolite, des-methoxyacetyl mibefradil (Ro 40-5966), in vitro. Both mibefradil and Ro 40-5966 were shown to exhibit type I binding characteristics (K(s) = 0.69 \u00b1 0.06 and 1.39 \u00b1 0.04 \u03bcM, respectively) toward CYP3A4. Complete K(i)/k(inact) experiments were performed, revealing a rapid and irreversible decrease in CYP3A4-catalyzed 1'-hydroxymidazolam formation. Approximately 70% of CYP3A4 activity was lost in the first minute of incubation with mibefradil, and inactivation was nonlinear after 2 min. Ro 40-5966 also resulted in time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4, albeit to a lesser extent than mibefradil. The decrease in CYP3A4 activity in the presence of mibefradil and NADPH was subsequently shown to have a good correlation with the time-dependent loss of CO binding, which, coupled with the lack of stable heme and/or apoprotein adducts, suggests heme destruction as the mechanism of inactivation of CYP3A4 by mibefradil.", 
    "221": "The objective of the present study was to determine the efflux transporters responsible for acid and lactone statin drug efflux using transporter knockdown Caco-2 cells. The bidirectional transport was determined in Caco-2 cell monolayers in which the expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), or multidrug resistance associated protein 2 (MRP2) was knocked down by transduction with lentivirus containing human transporter-targeted small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs). Cells transduced with lentivirus containing nontargeted shRNA served as the vector control. Atorvastatin, lovastatin, and rosuvastatin displayed extremely low apical-to-basolateral (A-to-B) transport, which made the P(app,A-B) values too unreliable to calculate the efflux ratio. Thus, transport comparisons were performed using the B-to-A permeability (P(app,B-A)) values. Presented in the order of vector control, P-gp, BCRP, and MRP2 knockdown Caco-2 cells, the P(app,B-A) values (\u00d710(-6), cm/s) were 28.1 \u00b1 1.3, 8.6 \u00b1 2.9, 20.3 \u00b1 1.8, and 21.5 \u00b1 1.6 for atorvastatin; 96.1 \u00b1 7.1, 25.3 \u00b1 3.5, 57.3 \u00b1 9.8, and 48.2 \u00b1 2.3 for fluvastatin; and 14.1 \u00b1 1.9, 4.6 \u00b1 1.7, 5.8 \u00b1 0.7, and 6.6 \u00b1 1.8 for rosuvastatin, respectively. Lovastatin and simvastatin showed no efflux in the vector control or knockdown cell monolayers in either lactone or acid forms. Results indicate that atorvastatin, fluvastatin, and rosuvastatin were transported by P-gp, BCRP, and MRP2. On the other hand, neither the lactone nor the resulting acid of lovastatin and simvastatin was transported by P-gp, BCRP, or MRP2. The current study demonstrated that the transporter knockdown Caco-2 cells are useful tools for studying drug-transporter interactions and should help eliminate some of the ambiguity associated with the identification of drug-transporter interactions based on chemical inhibitors alone.",

In this study, human prostate adenocarcinoma PC-3 and breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cell lines were used as models to investigate the mechanism of action of atorvastatin, one of the statins. Atorvastatin was found to induce apoptosis in PC-3 cells at a concentration of 1 \u03bcM, and in MCF-7 cells at 50 \u03bcM. Initial survey of possible pathway using various pathway-specific luciferase reporter assays showed that atorvastatin-activated antioxidant response element (ARE), suggesting oxidative stress pathway may play a role in atorvastatin-induced apoptosis in both cell lines. Among the antioxidant response genes, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) was significantly up-regulated by atorvastatin. Pre-incubation of the cells with geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate blocked atorvastatin-induced apoptosis, but not up-regulation of HO-1, suggesting that atorvastatin-induced apoptosis is dependent on GTPase activity and up-regulation of HO-1 gene is not. Six ARE-like elements (designated StRE1 [stress response element] through StRE6) are present in the HO-1 promoter. Atorvastatin was able to activate all of the elements. Because these StRE sites are present in clusters in HO-1 promoter, up-regulation of HO-1 by atorvastatin may involve multiple StRE sites. The role of HO-1 in atorvastatin-induced apoptosis in PC-3 and MCF-7 remains to be studied.",

Though octogenarians form a small percentage of the general population their absolute risk of coronary and cerebrovascular disease is high, but there is still some doubt as to whether high plasma cholesterol levels increase vascular risk in this age group, as published data are conflicting. There is evidence that elevated plasma cholesterol increases the risk of coronary artery disease in older adults, and an inverse linear relationship was found between HDL cholesterol levels and the risk of mortality from ischemic heart disease in all age groups. The relationship between total plasma cholesterol and the risk of death from ischemic stroke is weak in younger populations and is even lower in people between 70 and 89 years, and is inverse for hemorrhagic stroke. However, studies showed that statin treatment lowers the risk of ischemic stroke, independently of age. Statins are underused in the elderly, perhaps because of lack of perception of the real vascular risk of older adults, concerns about statin efficacy or safety in this population, or the increase of comorbidities and polypharmacy which could affect adherence to drug-treatment. Trials designed to address this issues are urgently needed, in order to be able to make evidence-guided decisions on lipid management of the elderly.", 
    "228": "In developed and developing countries, the population of very old people (more than 80 years) is expected to increase over the coming decades. By 2050, there will be an estimated 56.9 million nonagenarians worldwide, an 800% increase compared with today. In this group, the prevalence and incidence of stroke is very high, with great impact on morbidity and mortality. Only 10% of survivors may expect desirable recovery, and over 50% results with severe disability, the majority of them requiring in-home geriatric care or admittance to nursing homes. In spite of this, clinical trials that investigate acute management and primary and secondary prevention drugs are scarce in this population because most of the main trials excluded patients over 80 years. Results in young patients can not be extrapolated. In the elderly population, decrease in hepatic and renal function, metabolic pathways disturbances, polypharmacy and cognitive decline affects the efficacy, safety and adherence to long-term treatments. In this issue of the journal, we will review the evidence of acute treatment (intravenous thrombolysis) in the reduction of the functional impact of ischemic events in the very old. We will also evaluate the different therapies (antihypertensive and hypolipidemic drugs) in primary and secondary prevention and discuss the management of desired blood pressure levels. We will analyze the safety, efficacy and tolerability of statin therapy in this special group. A deeper understanding of the characteristics of aged patients would facilitate a better management of their cerebrovascular events.", 
    "229": "Previous imaging studies have demonstrated that the beneficial impact of high-dose statins on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis associates with their ability to lower levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and C-reactive protein (CRP) and to raise high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). The Study of Coronary Atheroma by InTravascular Ultrasound: Effect of Rosuvastatin versus AtorvastatiN (SATURN, NCT00620542) aims to compare the effects of high-dose atorvastatin and rosuvastatin on disease progression.", 
    "230": "A total of 1385 subjects with established coronary artery disease (CAD) on angiography were randomized to receive rosuvastatin 40\u2009mg or atorvastatin 80\u2009mg for 24 months. The primary efficacy parameter will be the nominal change in percent atheroma volume (PAV), determined by analysis of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) images of matched coronary artery segments acquired at baseline and at 24-month follow-up. The effect of statin therapy on plasma lipids and inflammatory markers, and the incidence of clinical cardiovascular events will also be assessed. The study does not have the statistical power to directly compare the treatment groups with regard to clinical events.", 
    "231": "Serial IVUS has emerged as a sensitive imaging modality to assess the impact of treatments on arterial structure. In this study, IVUS will be used to determine whether high-dose statins have different effects on plaque progression.", 
    "232": "Pitavastatin is the newest member of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor family and is approved as adjunctive therapy to diet to reduce elevated levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, apolipoprotein (Apo) B, and triglycerides and to increase levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol in adult patients with primary hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia. Pitavastatin undergoes minimal metabolism by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and, therefore, has a low propensity for drug-drug interactions with drugs metabolized by CYP enzymes or the CYP3A4 substrate grapefruit juice. In clinical trials, pitavastatin potently and consistently reduced serum levels of total, LDL, and non-HDL cholesterol, and triglycerides in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia where diet and other non-pharmacological measures were inadequate. Mean reductions from baseline in serum total and LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels were 21-32%, 30-45%, and 10-30%, respectively. Moreover, a consistent trend towards increased HDL cholesterol levels of 3-10% was seen. Long-term extension studies show that the beneficial effects of pitavastatin are maintained for up to 2 years. Pitavastatin produces reductions from baseline in serum total and LDL cholesterol levels to a similar extent to those seen with the potent agent atorvastatin and to a greater extent than those seen with simvastatin or pravastatin. In the majority of other studies comparing pitavastatin and atorvastatin, no significant differences in the favorable effects on lipid parameters were seen, although pitavastatin was consistently associated with trends towards increased HDL cholesterol levels. Pitavastatin also produces beneficial effects on lipids in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome without deleterious effects on markers of glucose metabolism, such as fasting blood glucose levels or proportion of glycosylated hemoglobin. Pitavastatin appears to exert a number of beneficial effects on patients at risk of cardiovascular events independent of lipid lowering. In the JAPAN-ACS (Japan Assessment of Pitavastatin and Atorvastatin in Acute Coronary Syndrome) study, pitavastatin was non-inferior to atorvastatin at reducing plaque volume in patients with ACS undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. Further beneficial effects, including favorable effects on the size and composition of atherosclerotic plaques, improvements in cardiovascular function, and improvements in markers of inflammation, oxidative stress, and renal function, have been demonstrated in a number of small studies. Pitavastatin is generally well tolerated in hyperlipidemic patients with or without type 2 diabetes, with the most common treatment-related adverse events being musculoskeletal or gastrointestinal in nature. Increases in plasma creatine kinase levels were seen in <5% of pitavastatin recipients and the incidence of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis was extremely low. In summary, pitavastatin, the latest addition to the statin family, produces potent and consistent beneficial effects on lipids, is well tolerated, and has a favorable pharmacokinetic profile. The combination of a potent decrease in total and LDL cholesterol levels and increase in HDL cholesterol levels suggest that pitavastatin may produce substantial cardiovascular protection.", 
    "233": "Inflammation is an independent risk factor of cardiovascular diseases and is associated with endothelial dysfunction. Monascus purpureus-fermented rice, containing naturally occurring statins and various pigments, has lipid-modulating, anti-inflammatory and antioxidative effects.", 
    "234": "The effects of monacolin K, ankaflavin and monascin, as metabolites from Monascus-fermented rice, on the expression of cell adhesion molecules (intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecular-1 (VCAM-1) and E-selectin) by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1-treated human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) were investigated. Supplement of HAECs with these Monascus-fermented rice metabolites significantly suppressed cellular binding between the human monocytic cells U937 and TNF-\u03b1-stimulated HAECs. Immunoblot analysis showed that Monascus-fermented rice metabolites significantly attenuated TNF-\u03b1-induced VCAM-1 and E-selectin but not ICAM-1 protein expression. Gel shift assays showed that Monascus-fermented rice metabolites treatment reduced TNF-\u03b1-activated transcription factor nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB. Furthermore, Monascus-fermented rice metabolites also attenuated reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in vitro and in TNF-\u03b1-treated HAECs. Supplement with an ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine gave similar results as compared with Monascus-fermented rice metabolites.", 
    "235": "Monascus-fermented rice metabolites reduced TNF-\u03b1-stimulated endothelial adhesiveness as well as downregulating intracellular ROS formation, NF-\u03baB activation, and VCAM-1/E-selectin expression in HAECs, supporting the notion that the various metabolites from Monascus-fermented rice might have potential implications in clinical atherosclerosis disease.", 
    "236": "Genetic variation of ATP-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 (ABCB1) which encodes P-glycoprotein (P-gp) has been associated with lipid levels and response to statins. Here, we studied these associations in patients with advanced heart failure who subsequently underwent transplantation. Fasting total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and triglycerides (TG) concentrations in 268 adult heart transplant recipients were analysed retrospectively before and at 1 year after transplantation (n = 176). ABCB1 genotyping and haplotyping for C1236T, G2677T/A and C3435T was performed using polymerase chain reaction. Pre-transplant LDL cholesterol was found to be associated with the C3435T genotype and the G2677T/A-C3435T and C1236T-G2677T/A-C3435T haplotypes. T-allele carriers at all loci (n = 77) had higher LDL levels than non-T-allele carriers (n = 24, 3.5 \u00b1 1.2 vs. 2.8 \u00b1 1.2 mmol/L, respectively, p = 0.025). This association remained after adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, statin use and underlying ischaemic heart disease. ABCB1 genotype was not associated with post-transplant lipid parameters. Hypercholesterolaemia (TC >5.7 mmol/L) was more prevalent post-transplant than pre-transplant (51% vs. 30%, respectively) and was likely related to steroid and calcineurin inhibitor use. Muscle-related statin effects were only seen in patients possessing the T-haplotype. In conclusion, an association between ABCB1 haplotype and plasma fasting LDL cholesterol concentration was found in patients with advanced heart failure. This association was not seen 1 year after cardiac transplantation.", 
    "237": "The relaxant effect of the methyl ester of rosuvastatin was evaluated on aortic rings from male Wistar rats (250-300 g, 6 rats for each experimental group) with and without endothelium precontracted with 1.0 \u00b5M phenylephrine. The methyl ester presented a slightly greater potency than rosuvastatin in relaxing aortic rings, with log IC50 values of -6.88 and -6.07 M, respectively. Unlike rosuvastatin, the effect of its methyl ester was endothelium-independent. Pretreatment with 10 \u00b5M indomethacin did not inhibit, and pretreatment with 1 mM mevalonate only modestly inhibited the relaxant effect of the methyl ester. N\u03c9-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 10 \u00b5M), the selective nitric oxide-2 (NO-2) inhibitor 1400 W (10 \u00b5M), tetraethylammonium (TEA, 10 mM), and cycloheximide (10 \u00b5M) partially inhibited the relaxant effect of the methyl ester on endothelium-denuded aortic rings. However, the combination of TEA plus either L-NAME or cycloheximide completely inhibited the relaxant effect. Inducible NO synthase (NOS-2) was only present in endothelium-denuded aortic rings, as demonstrated by immunoblot with methyl ester-treated rings. In conclusion, whereas rosuvastatin was associated with a relaxant effect dependent on endothelium and hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase in rat aorta, the methyl ester of rosuvastatin exhibited an endothelium-independent and only slightly hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase-dependent relaxant effect. Both NO produced by NOS-2 and K+ channels are involved in the relaxant effect of the methyl ester of rosuvastatin.", 
    "238": "Dyslipidemia is related to the progression of atherosclerosis and is an important risk factor for acute coronary syndromes. Our objective was to determine the effect of rosuvastatin on myocardial necrosis in an experimental model of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Male Wistar rats (8-10 weeks old, 250-350 g) were subjected to definitive occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery to cause AMI. Animals were divided into 6 groups of 8 to 11 rats per group: G1, normocholesterolemic diet; G2, normocholesterolemic diet and rosuvastatin (1 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7day-1) 30 days after AMI; G3, normocholesterolemic diet and rosuvastatin (1 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7day-1) 30 days before and after AMI; G4, hypercholesterolemic diet; G5, hypercholesterolemic diet and rosuvastatin (1 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7day-1) 30 days after AMI; G6, hypercholesterolemic diet and rosuvastatin (1 mg\u00b7kg(-1)\u00b7day-1) 30 days before and after AMI. Left ventricular function was determined by echocardiography and percent infarct area by histology. Fractional shortening of the left ventricle was normal at baseline and decreased significantly after AMI (P < 0.05 in all groups), being lower in G4 and G5 than in the other groups. No significant difference in fractional shortening was observed between G6 and the groups on the normocholesterolemic diet. Percent infarct area was significantly higher in G4 than in G3. No significant differences were observed in infarct area among the other groups. We conclude that a hypercholesterolemic diet resulted in reduced cardiac function after AMI, which was reversed with rosuvastatin when started 30 days before AMI. A normocholesterolemic diet associated with rosuvastatin before and after AMI prevented myocardial necrosis when compared with the hypercholesterolemic condition.", 
    "239": "Wilms tumor gene 1 (wt-1), a key regulator of mesenchymal-epithelial transformation, is downregulated during congenital obstructive nephropathy, leading to apoptosis. There is a functional interaction between WT-1 and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). In this regard, we reported that after neonatal unilateral ureteral obstruction, rosuvastatin prevents apoptosis through an increase in nitric oxide bioavailability, which in turn is linked to higher Hsp70 expression. Hence, the goal of this study was to determine whether a nitric oxide/Hsp70 interaction is involved in changes in WT-1 mRNA expression after ureteral obstruction. Neonatal rats submitted to experimental ureteral obstruction were treated with either vehicle or rosuvastatin for 14 days. Decreased nitric oxide and iNOS/Hsp70 expression associated with WT-1 low expression was shown in obstructed kidneys. Apoptosis was induced and it was associated with an increased Bax/BcL2 ratio. Conversely, iNOS/Hsp70 upregulation and an increased WT-1 mRNA expression, without an apoptotic response, were observed in the cortex of obstructed kidneys of rosuvastatin-treated rats. Nitric oxide also modulated Hsp70 and WT-1 mRNA expression in MDCK cells. Finally, in vivo experiments with nitric oxide modulators support our hypothesis that WT-1 mRNA expression is associated with nitric oxide level. Results suggest that rosuvastatin may modulate WT-1 mRNA expression through renal nitric oxide bioavailability, preventing neonatal obstruction-induced apoptosis associated with Hsp70 interaction.", 
    "240": "Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a crucial co-modulator of cardiovascular, nervous, digestive and excretory systems function. The pleiotropic action of atorvastatin exceeds simple 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibition and involves multiple biological mechanisms. This study assesses the influence of atorvastatin on the H2S tissue concentration in mouse brain, liver, heart and kidney. Twenty-four female CBA strain mice received an intraperitoneal injection. The mice were given one of the following solutions: 0.1 mg atorvastatin (5 mg/kg of body weight (b.w.)/day--group D1, n=8), 0.4 mg atorvastatin (20 mg/kg b.w./day--group D2, n=8) or a saline physiological control (0.2 ml--group C, n=8). A modified Siegel spectrophotometric method was used for the H2S tissue concentration measurements. There was a remarkable rise in the H2S concentration [\u03bcg/g] in the kidney (C: 5.26\u00b10.09, D1: 5.77\u00b10.11, p=0.0003; D2: 7.48\u00b10.09, p<0.0001). There were also slight H2S tissue level changes in the brain (C: 1.61\u00b10.01, D1: 1.75\u00b10.03, p=0.0001; D2: 1.78\u00b10.03, p<0.0001), the heart (C: 4.54\u00b10.08, D1: 4.86\u00b10.10, p=0.0027; D2: 4.56\u00b10.07, p=0.6997) and the liver (C: 3.45\u00b10.03, D1: 3.27\u00b10.02, p=0.0001; D2: 3.31\u00b10.02, p=0.0003). Our study supports the influence of atorvastatin on H2S tissue concentration in kidneys and other mouse organs."
