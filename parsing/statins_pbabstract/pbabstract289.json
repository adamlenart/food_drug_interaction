    "1": "Aortic atherosclerosis was established over 17 weeks in 46 rabbits by balloon denudation and cholesterol feeding. During the past 5 days of the cholesterol-feeding period, animals received: (1) no treatment; (2) oral atorvastatin 5 mg/kg on each of the 5 days; or (3) infusions of HDL (8 mg/kg apolipoprotein A-I) on days 1 and 3 of the treatment phase. After euthanization, lesion size and composition were assessed by histological and immunohistochemical analysis. HDL (but not atorvastatin) reduced lesion size by 36% (P<0.05). The ratio of smooth muscle cells to macrophages in the lesions increased 2.6-fold in animals infused with HDL (P<0.05) and 4-fold in those receiving atorvastatin (P<0.01). HDL and atorvastatin reduced matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 expression by 42% (P<0.05) and 45% (P<0.03), respectively. HDL increased thrombomodulin expression 2-fold (P<0.03). The beneficial effects on lesion area and plaque cellular composition were influenced by HDL phospholipid and apolipoprotein composition.",

    "4": "A total of 54 postmenarchal girls, aged 10 to 17 years, were enrolled in a 24-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. After a 4-week diet/placebo run-in period, patients were randomized to 1 of 2 groups: (1) treatment with diet plus lovastatin 20 mg/day for 4 weeks, followed by diet plus lovastatin 40 mg/day for 20 weeks, or (2) diet plus placebo for 24 weeks.", 
    "5": "Baseline values of lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins (apo) were comparable between treatment groups. Lovastatin treatment was efficacious at reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by 23% to 27%, total cholesterol by 17% to 22%, and apo B by 20% to 23% at weeks 4 and 24, respectively. Between-treatment group differences were not statistically significant for triglycerides, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or apo A-I. Lovastatin was generally safe and well tolerated. There were no clinically significant alterations in vital signs (blood pressure and pulse rate), anthropomorphic measurements (height, weight, and BMI), hormone levels (luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, estradiol, and cortisol), menstrual cycle length, or tests of liver and muscle function.",

    "7": "Although abnormalities in cardiac fatty acid metabolism are involved in the development of several cardiac pathologies, the mechanisms underlying these changes are not well understood. Given the prominent role played by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor beta/delta (PPARbeta/delta in cardiac fatty acid metabolism, the aim of this study was to examine the effects of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activation on the activity of this nuclear receptor. Embryonic rat heart-derived H9c2 cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) showed a reduction (38%, P<0.05) in the mRNA levels of the PPARbeta/delta-target gene pyruvatedehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) that was prevented in the presence of the NF-kappaB inhibitors parthenolide (10 microM) and atorvastatin (10 microM). Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that both parthenolide and atorvastatin significantly decreased LPS-stimulated NF-kappaB binding activity in H9c2 cardiac cells. LPS-stimulation of H9c2 cardiac cells also led to a 30% reduction (P<0.05) in the mRNA levels of PPARgamma Coactivator 1 (PGC-1) that was consistent with the reduction in the protein levels of this coactivator. In the presence of either atorvastatin or parthenolide, the reduction in PGC-1 expression was prevented. Co-immunoprecipitation studies showed that LPS-stimulation led to a reduction in the physical interaction between PGC-1 and PPARbeta/delta and that this reduction was prevented in the presence of atorvastatin. Finally, electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that parthenolide and atorvastatin prevented LPS-mediated reduction in PPARbeta/delta binding activity in H9c2 cardiac cells. These results suggest that LPS-mediated NF-kappaB activation inhibits the expression of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism by a mechanism involving reduced expression of PGC-1, which in turn affects the PPARbeta/delta transactivation of target genes involved in cardiac fatty acid oxidation.", 
    "8": "Research into the management of dyslipidaemia has increasingly focussed on the importance of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. It is well known that low levels of HDL are associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular events. Recent data have highlighted the anti-atherogenic actions of HDL such as anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative activities, and of course, reverse cholesterol transport. This latter observation may explain certain effects on atherosclerotic plaques, in particular the observation that plaque regression can occur when treatments augment HDL-C levels. This review will outline the beneficial effects of HDL, along with the detrimental effects of other lipoproteins involved in atherosclerotic processes. This manuscript will also describe the therapeutic effects of nicotinic acid, a treatment that raises HDL-C levels. Studies show that using nicotinic acid as a monotherapy or in combination with other agents halts plaque progression and translates as a significant reduction in cardiovascular events.", 
    "9": "Statins have become a cornerstone of treatment for dyslipidaemia primarily due to their marked lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Studies show that statin treatment typically reduces relative risk of cardiovascular disease by 24-37%, regardless of age, sex, prior history of coronary heart disease (CHD), or other co-morbid conditions. There is also a growing body of evidence that statins can be effective in people whose LDL-C is not considered elevated under current guidelines. In both the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial (ASCOT) and the Collaborative Atorvastatin Diabetes Study (CARDS), participants randomised to atorvastatin (10 mg/day) experienced at least a one-third reduction in major cardiovascular events, even though at baseline, their LDL-C was within the normal range. Other studies have also provided evidence that more intensive lipid-lowering regimens could provide additional clinical benefits. In the Reversal of Atherosclerosis with Aggressive Lipid Lowering (REVERSAL) trial, the first active-control clinical trial of CHD progression, an intensive lipid-lowering regimen using atorvastatin (80 mg/day) decreased atherogenic lipoproteins and atheroma volume in patients with established CHD, compared with a moderate regimen using pravastatin (40 mg/day). Furthermore, relative to baseline, there was no measurable atheroma progression in the atorvastatin group. While statin therapy does offer significant clinical benefit, 60-70% of major cardiovascular events are still not prevented, which underscores the need for alternative interventions. Targeting inflammatory mediators of atherosclerosis such as C-reactive protein (CRP), as well as combination therapy to simultaneously raise high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and lower LDL-C, are among the promising new strategies for primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic disease. This article will summarise data concerning use of statins in patients without markedly elevated LDL-C. The issue of the ideal LDL-C target will also be considered before addressing future treatment options for dyslipidaemia.", 
    "10": "Many current treatment guidelines aimed at the prevention of cardiovascular events focus on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) targets when addressing dyslipidaemia, and hence, indirectly at least, encourage the use of statin therapy. While this strategy shows marked clinical benefit, reducing cardiovascular risk by approximately 30%, there remains scope for greater treatment success. Recent analyses of data from epidemiological studies such as the Prospective Cardiovascular M\u00fcnster (PROCAM) highlighted the importance of other lipid parameters of risk, such as a deficit of plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) or an excess of lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)]. HDL has been shown to be operative in a wide range of atheroprotective mechanisms beyond its well known role in reverse cholesterol transport, while Lp(a) is known to increase atherothrombotic responses. Both HDL and Lp(a) levels interact with other parameters of risk, including LDL-C, such as to greatly influence an individual's global risk. As a consequence, the International Task Force for Prevention of Coronary Heart Disease has recently produced guidelines that consider an individual's risk to result from both classical and emerging risk factors. HDL-C raising is advocated as a treatment strategy for at-risk patients with fasting triglyceride levels > or = 200 mg/dL (> or = 2.3 mmol/L) and HDL-C levels < 35 mg/dL (< 0.9 mmol/L). This strategy is supported by prospective epidemiological evidence. Lp(a) has not been specifically tested as a target for intervention, but it is included in the new guidelines where it is regarded as an important modifier of global risk.",

    "12": "In this open-label, active-controlled randomized 2-center study, patients with primary hypercholesterolemia were randomized to treatment with immediate-release fluvastatin 40 mg/day (n = 30) or slow-release fluvastatin 80 mg/day (n = 31) for 12 weeks. The primary efficacy variable was percent change in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level from baseline. Secondary efficacy variables were percent changes in total cholesterol, triglyceride, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels, and the percent of patients achieving LDL cholesterol goals of the US National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) II.",

    "15": "The MDR1 gene encodes the P-glycoprotein, an efflux transporter with broad substrate specificity. P-glycoprotein has raised great interest in pharmacogenetics because it transports a variety of structurally divergent drugs, including lipid-lowering drugs. The synonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism C3435T and the nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphism G2677T/A in MDR1 have been indicated as potential determinants of variability in drug disposition and efficacy. In order to evaluate the effect of G2677T/A and C3435T MDR1 polymorphisms on serum levels of lipids before and after atorvastatin administration, 69 unrelated hypercholesterolemic individuals from S\u00e3o Paulo city, Brazil, were selected and treated with 10 mg atorvastatin orally once daily for four weeks. MDR1 polymorphisms were analyzed by PCR-RFLP. C3435T and G2677T polymorphisms were found to be linked. The allelic frequencies for C3435T polymorphism were 0.536 and 0.464 for the 3435C and 3435T alleles, respectively, while for G2677T/A polymorphism allele frequencies were 0.580 for the 2677G allele, 0.384 for the 2677T allele and 0.036 for the 2677A allele. There was no significant relation between atorvastatin response and MDR1 polymorphisms (repeated measures ANOVA; P > 0.05). However, haplotype analysis revealed an association between T/T carriers and higher basal serum total (TC) and LDL cholesterol levels (TC: 303 +/- 56, LDL-C: 216 +/- 57 mg/dl, respectively) compared with non-T/T carriers (TC: 278 +/- 28, LDL-C: 189 +/- 24 mg/dl; repeated measures ANOVA/Tukey test; P < 0.05). These data indicate that MDR1 polymorphism may have an important contribution to the control of basal serum cholesterol levels in Brazilian hypercholesterolemic individuals of European descent.",

    "20": "Several large clinical trials have demonstrated the ability of statins to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. An unresolved issue, however, has been the appropriate dose of statin therapy. High-dose statins lower LDL-cholesterol more efficiently, but it remains questionable whether they reduce morbidity and mortality more than lower doses. Recently, two large clinical trials have been published that address these issues. The 'Treat to new targets' trial appears most relevant for clinical practice. In this trial, high-dose atorvastatin (80 mg per day) was more effective in reducing cardiovascular events than low-dose atorvastatin (10 mg per day) in patients whose LDL-cholesterol level was previously lowered to 3.4 mmol/l or less with the 10-mg dose. However, overall mortality did not differ due to increased mortality from noncardiac causes in the high-dose group. These findings raise important questions regarding safety and the indications for high-dose statins. Further studies are needed to resolve these issues. In the mean time, it seems reasonable to reserve high-dose statin therapy for patients who are at a very high cardiovascular risk, for example those with a history of recurrent cardiovascular events.",

    "26": "Current pharmacological strategies for acute ischemic stroke largely mirror those employed in acute coronary syndromes. However, important differences in the effectiveness and versatility of the principal agents have emerged between these 2 clinical settings. In general, the level of success achieved with drugs in acute coronary syndromes has not carried over to the same extent when the same drug types are used in stroke. The principal reason is that reperfusion or anticoagulant therapies in the setting of brain infarction run a significant risk of hemorrhagic transformation that has no direct equivalent in myocardial infarction. Consequently, a significant challenge in acute stroke therapeutics is the ability to select patients for drugs where only a narrow therapeutic margin exists and to identify methods that can minimize hemorrhage risk. Other brain-specific vascular factors also pertain in explaining differences in outcome of drugs generally regarded as having a broad cardiovascular remit. The relatively limited efficacy of antiplatelets in stroke might relate to the composition and heterogeneity of the cerebrovascular lesion, while the poor outcome associated with acute anti-hypertensive use is partly due to loss of cerebrovascular autoregulation. Finally, downstream consequences of arterial occlusion within the brain such as excitotoxicity and plasticity are organ specific and, as such, deserve their own pharmacological approaches. In this review, we describe the general mechanism of each drug class used in ischemic stroke and then report on the clinical experience and application for each.", 
    "27": "The aim was to investigate the role that municipalities and out-patient health care centres (HCCs) have in understanding adherence to official guidelines on statin prescribing. Our hypothesis was that after guideline publication, adherence to recommended statin prescription would increase and variance among HCCs and municipalities would decrease. Since multi-level regression analysis (MLRA) is a relatively new methodology in pharmacoepidemiology, we also aimed to explore the application of MLRA in our investigation.",

We applied multi-level analysis on 34,514 individual prescriptions (level 1) nested within 226 HCCs (level 2), which in turn were nested within 33 municipalities (level 3). Temporal trends and gender differences were investigated by means of random slope analysis. Variance was expressed using median odds ratio (MOR) and interval odds ratio.",

After publication of the guidelines, prescription of recommended statins increased, and variance among HCCs decreased but only during the first 4 months of the observation period.", 
    "30": "The publication of official guidelines in the county of Scania exerted a positive influence on statin prescription but, at the end of the observation period, adherence was still low and practice variation high.

The goal of the current study is to determine whether lovastatin bioactivity levels, in a range equivalent to those used in in vitro and preclinical studies, can be safely achieved in human subjects. Here we present the findings from a dose-escalating trial of lovastatin in subjects with advanced malignancies. Lovastatin was administered every 6 h for 96 h in 4-week cycles in doses ranging from 10 mg/m2 to 415 mg/m2. Peak plasma lovastatin bioactivity levels of 0.06-12.3 microM were achieved in a dose-independent manner. Cholesterol levels decreased during treatment and normalized during the rest period. A dose-limiting toxicity was not reached and there were no clinically significant increases in creatine phosphokinase or serum hepatic aminotransferases levels. No antitumor responses were observed. These results demonstrate that high doses of lovastatin, given every 4 h for 96 h, are well-tolerated and in select cases, bioactivity levels in the range necessary for antiproliferative activity were achieved.",

Close correlations between average per capita fat intake and prostate cancer mortality internationally generated interest in underlying mechanisms for this link, such as through serum levels of androgens, free radicals, proinflammatory fatty acid metabolites, or insulin-like growth factor. Much interest currently lies in the potential of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) to play a chemopreventative role in prostate cancer. Lycopene, a potent antioxidant found in tomatoes, may exert a protective effect in the prostate. Selenium and vitamin E have also been shown to decrease the risk of prostate cancer in some men. Calcium may support vitamin D-related antiproliferative effects in prostate cancer. Certain soy proteins, common in the Asian diet, have been shown to inhibit prostate cancer cell growth.

Insulin sensitivity was determined with euglycaemic-hyperinsulinaemic clamp after 12 weeks of both treatment periods.", 
    "63": "Serum lipids and lipoproteins improved significantly. Mean total cholesterol after the rosuvastatin treatment period was 44% lower compared to the placebo treatment period (triglycerides -28%; LDL-c -50%; VLDL-c -56%, VLDL-TG -39%) and both parameters of low-grade inflammation (as measured by hsCRP, -16%) and oxidative stress (as measured by plasma-oxLDL, -55%) decreased markedly after rosuvastatin therapy as compared to placebo. However, the insulin sensitivity index was unchanged (41.7 +/- 17.4 vs. 40.6 +/- 11.1 L kg(-1) min(-1), placebo vs. rosuvastatin, P = 0.71).",

    "65": "The statins are powerful inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), the key enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, and are among the most widely prescribed drugs in the world. Despite their clinical importance, little is known about the binding thermodynamics of statins to HMG-CoA reductase. In this paper, we report the results of inhibition kinetics and microcalorimetric analysis of a representative type I statin (pravastatin) and four type II statins (fluvastatin, cerivastatin, atorvastatin, and rosuvastatin). Inhibition constants (K(i)) range from 2 to 250 nM for the different statins. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments yield binding enthalpies (DeltaH(binding)) ranging between zero and -9.3 kcal/mol at 25 degrees C. There is a clear correlation between binding affinity and binding enthalpy: the most powerful statins bind with the strongest enthalpies. The proportion by which the binding enthalpy contributes to the binding affinity is not the same for all statins, indicating that the balance among hydrogen bonding, van der Waals, and hydrophobic interactions is not the same for all of them. At 25 degrees C, the dominant contribution to the binding affinity of fluvastatin, pravastatin, cerivastatin, and atorvastatin is the entropy change. Only for rosuvastatin does the enthalpy change contribute more than 50% of the total binding energy (76%). Since the enthalpic and entropic contributions to binding originate from different types of interactions, the thermodynamic dissection presented here provides a way to identify interactions that are critical for affinity and specificity.",

In clinical trials, rosuvastatin was well tolerated, with a low incidence of adverse events and a safety profile similar to that of the other marketed statins. At present, no large-scale primary or secondary prevention clinical trials document either long-term safety of rosuvastatin or its effectiveness in preventing coronary events.",

To begin to examine the underlying molecular mechanisms, measurements of transcription by nuclear run-on assays and an investigation of occupancy of the promoter were performed. The rate of transcription was substantially reduced in the diabetic rats and fully restored within 2 h after insulin treatment. In vivo footprinting revealed several areas of protein binding as shown by dimethyl sulfate protection or enhancement. The cAMP-response element was heavily protected in all conditions, including diabetes, feeding of dietary cholesterol, or statin treatment. Striking enhancements in footprints from diabetic animals were visible at -142 and at -161 (in the sterol-response element). Protections at a newly identified NF-Y site at -70/-71 were observed in normal animals and not in diabetics. This NF-Y site was found to be required for efficient HMGR transcription in luciferase assays. CREB-1 was able to bind the HMGR cAMP-response element in vitro and the promoter in vivo. This evidence supports an essential role for cAMP-response element-binding protein in transcription of hepatic HMGR and identifies at least two sites where in vivo occupancy is regulated by insulin.",

    "87": "Impaired remyelination due to degeneration of both postmitotic oligodendrocytes and oligodendrocyte progenitors (OPs) is the major hallmark of inflammatory demyelination in multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Here, we have demonstrated the potential of lovastatin, a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, for the restoration of impaired remyelination mediated through enhanced survival and differentiation of OPs in the spinal cord of treated EAE animals. Lovastatin treatment significantly increased the level of myelin lipids in the spinal cord of treated EAE animals, coinciding with the attenuation of disease severity and inflammatory demyelination as compared with untreated EAE animals. The increased expression of myelin proteins and transcription factors associated with differentiating oligodendrocytes along with the increase in number of NG2+/BrdU- and NG2+/BrdU+ cells, and the expression of proliferating OP-specific proteins, demonstrated the restoration of remyelination in the spinal cord of lovastatin-treated EAE animals. Corresponding to this, in vitro studies further corroborated the increased survival and differentiation of OPs in lovastatin-treated activated mixed glial cells suggesting that lovastatin protects against the degeneration of OPs and enhances their differentiation through induction of a pro-remyelinating environment in the spinal cord of treated EAE animals. Together, these data demonstrate that lovastatin has the potential to augment remyelination in MS lesions and other neuroinflammatory diseases.", 
    "88": "This article reviews the safety of statins, with emphasis on high-dose atorvastatin (80 mg), the agent with the most efficacy data for clinical outcomes. Although elevated levels of hepatic enzymes were of concern when statins were first introduced, a review of data from large clinical trials shows that elevations in hepatic enzymes are rare and do not lead to clinically significant liver disease. Despite the withdrawal of cerivastatin because of fatal rhabdomyolysis, the risk of this complication with other statins is extremely low. Mild and often transient myalgia is more commonly reported. The safety of high-dose atorvastatin has been evaluated in >11,000 patients, and rates of clinically significant myopathy and elevated hepatic enzymes were extremely low. Simvastatin at doses up to 40 mg is also associated with low rates of elevated hepatic enzymes and myopathy. However, the 80-mg dose of simvastatin carries a risk of myopathy (muscle symptoms and creatine kinase levels >10,000 U/L) of approximately 1 in 250. The clinical benefits of preventing vascular events, myocardial infarction, stroke, and need for revascularization outweigh the low rates of adverse events associated with high-dose statin therapy in high- and intermediate-risk patients.", 
    "89": "Statins reduce both atherogenic lipoproteins and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). The optimal strategy for administration of lipid-lowering agents has evolved considerably during the past 2 years. Several studies have compared the effects of intensive versus moderate lipid lowering in secondary prevention of coronary events. The Reversal of Atherosclerosis with Aggressive Lipid Lowering (REVERSAL) study was a double-blind, randomized trial comparing the effect that 2 different statins, administered for 18 months, had on atherosclerotic burden measured by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). At 34 centers in the United States, 654 patients were randomized to moderate lipid lowering using pravastatin 40 mg or intensive treatment with atorvastatin 80 mg. IVUS was performed during baseline catheterization and repeated after 18 months of treatment. Efficacy parameters included changes in atheroma burden determined by IVUS, lipoprotein levels, and CRP levels. Baseline low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (mean, 3.9 mmol/L [150.2 mg/dL]) levels were reduced to 2.8 mmol/L (110 mg/dL) in the pravastatin 40-mg group compared with 2.0 mmol/L (79 mg/dL) in the atorvastatin 80-mg arm (p <0.0001). CRP decreased 5.2% with pravastatin and 36.4% with atorvastatin (p <0.0001). Changes in atheroma burden showed a significantly lower progression rate in the intensive arm for all 3 prespecified IVUS efficacy measures. For all IVUS end points, progression occurred in the moderate-treatment cohort. However, plaque volume was unchanged in the intensive arm, indicating absence of progression. Post hoc analyses demonstrated that greater reductions in both lipid levels and hsCRP were associated with slower disease progression. The slowest progression occurred in patients with above-median reductions in both LDL cholesterol and CRP. For patients with coronary artery disease, intensive treatment with atorvastatin 80 mg reduced progression of coronary atherosclerosis compared with a more moderate regimen consisting of pravastatin 40 mg. Compared with baseline, intensively treated patients had no change in atheroma burden, whereas moderately treated patients showed progression. These differences are related to the greater reduction in atherogenic lipoproteins and CRP in intensively treated patients.", 
    "90": "Acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is associated with a number of abnormalities in inflammation, endothelial function, and coagulation, all of which appear to be modulated by statins. We examined the time to benefit of different statin regimens in the Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 22 (PROVE IT-TIMI 22) trial and other ACS trials that compared statin therapies in patients with ACS. In PROVE IT-TIMI 22, apparent clinical benefit was observed as early as 30 days, with significant reduction in all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, unstable angina requiring rehospitalization, revascularization performed 30 days postrandomization, or stroke observed as early as 4 months. In PROVE IT-TIMI 22, atorvastatin 80 mg lowered both low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and C-reactive protein (CRP) at 30 days and 4 months to a greater extent than pravastatin 40 mg. Those who achieved the lowest LDL and the lowest CRP levels at 30 days after ACS had the lowest risk of acute cardiac events. The very early benefits of statin therapy appeared to be correlated with CRP reductions, which may relate to the intensity of the pleiotropic effects of statins.", 
    "91": "Acute coronary syndromes (ACS) consist of unstable angina or acute myocardial infarction and are associated with a high risk of early recurrent ischemic events. Revascularization procedures do not modify underlying pathophysiology and only modestly reduce early ischemic events after an index episode of ACS. Although statins improve dyslipidemia and cardiovascular risk over the long term, efforts to identify new ACS treatments are focusing on the ability of statins to modify the arterial wall-blood interface and reduce the risk of early recurrent ischemic events. Statins have been shown to reduce circulating markers of inflammation within days of an acute ischemic event. Short-term statin therapy also has been associated with improved coronary endothelial function, reversal of prothrombotic states, and reduction in atherosclerotic plaque volume. Findings from 6 randomized, controlled intervention trials were evaluated to determine if risk reduction is associated with the intensity of statin therapy. In addition, the predictive ability of baseline lipid levels and inflammatory markers were examined. High-intensity statin therapy (atorvastatin 80 mg) reduced early recurrent ischemic events after ACS compared with moderate-intensity treatment (eg, pravastatin 40 mg) or placebo. Moderate-intensity regimens (simvastatin 40 mg, pravastatin 20 to 40 mg, fluvastatin 80 mg, cerivastatin 0.4 mg) provided minimal benefit compared with placebo. Although there was no apparent relation between low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels before or during randomized treatment and short-term (4-month) risk of recurrent events, the degree of LDL cholesterol reduction with statin treatment after ACS may be related to longer-term event reduction. Moreover, evidence suggests that anti-inflammatory effects of high-intensity statin treatment are associated with clinical benefit.", 
    "92": "The lipid-lowering properties of statins reduce rates of coronary artery disease (CAD) events and strokes. Findings of recently conducted, longitudinal intervention studies suggest that these benefits occur early and may be, in part, independent of the lipid-lowering properties of statin therapy. We analyzed data from the Anglo-Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial-Lipid-Lowering Arm (ASCOT-LLA) to determine the timing of cardiovascular risk reduction. Relative risk reductions in CAD events were large compared with placebo, becoming apparent at 30 days and significant within 3 months, but they tended to decrease with time. Risk reductions in stroke were also apparent at 30 days but remained constant throughout the trial. Significant differences in hazard ratio between atorvastatin and placebo occurred at 2-year follow-up. Such apparently differential effects on CAD and stroke events suggest that mechanisms of action for CAD and stroke prevention may be different. These observations support the hypothesis that non-lipid-lowering actions of atorvastatin may have contributed to early protection against CAD in ASCOT-LLA.", 
    "93": "There are overwhelming data in favor of cholesterol as a modifiable risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD). Lifestyle modifications are considered first-line treatments for lowering cholesterol, but drug therapies are recommended in at-risk groups. Trials published before the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III reports have helped statins emerge at the forefront of lipid therapies, and more recent trials have shed light on high-risk prevention. Although 6 statins are currently available, large clinical trials reported thus far have mainly evaluated atorvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, and simvastatin in the prevention of CAD and other cardiovascular events. A few small end point trials have evaluated fluvastatin, whereas rosuvastatin trials are only in their early days.", 
    "94": "Statins are potent inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis and exert beneficial effects in the primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease. However, the overall benefits observed with statins appear to occur much earlier and to be greater than what might be expected from changes in lipid levels alone, suggesting effects beyond cholesterol lowering. Indeed, recent studies indicate that some of the cholesterol-independent or \"pleiotropic\" effects of statins involve improving endothelial function, enhancing the stability of atherosclerotic plaques, decreasing oxidative stress and inflammation, and inhibiting the thrombogenic response. Many of these pleiotropic effects are mediated by inhibition of isoprenoids, which serve as lipid attachments for intracellular signaling molecules. In particular, inhibition of the small guanosine triphosphate-binding proteins Rho, Ras, and Rac, whose proper membrane localization and function are dependent on isoprenylation, may play an important role in mediating the pleiotropic effects of statins.", 
    "95": "Statin drugs inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase and share the common mechanism of lowering circulating levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, a powerful indicator of risk for cardiovascular disease. Large clinical trials have documented the benefit of hypolipidemic therapy for both primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease and stroke. Recent clinical findings, including direct comparator studies, now indicate that certain statins may slow progression of disease at a rate and to an extent that cannot be solely attributed to LDL reduction. The proposed mechanisms for such pleiotropic actions include enhancement of endothelial-dependent nitric oxide bioavailability, anti-inflammatory activity, and inhibition of oxidative stress. To understand the biochemical basis for such differences among statins, this article reviews their physicochemical properties and pharmacology at the molecular level.", 
    "96": "How rapidly benefits accrue from nonstatin, lipid-lowering therapies is a 21st-century question posed to data collected in the 20th century. The 3 early dietary trials conducted in institutional settings where diet was strictly controlled demonstrate that, compared with a control diet, cholesterol-lowering diets reduce coronary event rates over several years. These data do not reveal whether a more homogeneous high-risk population would demonstrate an earlier time to benefit. Dietary counseling trials of men with coronary disease conducted in the 1950s and 1960s failed to demonstrate a consistent benefit from dietary therapy, in part because of confounding factors from methodologic flaws in trial design. By the 1980s and 1990s, improvements in trial design, such as larger numbers of subjects, control of confounding risk factors, and limiting trial end points to those directly attributable to atherosclerotic events, were in place. Subsequently, 5 randomized clinical trials showed a consistent benefit of dietary therapy, with significant reductions by 1 to 2 years in fatal events, nonfatal events, and total mortality; 2 of these studies, each including omega-3 fatty acids as part of the dietary intervention, reported a rapid and significant time to benefit (within 3 to 6 months). Additional lifestyle benefits of cardiac rehabilitation (a surrogate for physical activity) and smoking cessation clearly show long-term benefit at 1 and 5 years, respectively. Nonstatin drug and surgical therapies either have shown no significant benefit (estrogen, dextrothyroxine) or benefit after 1 to 5 years of therapy (intestinal bypass surgery, cholestyramine, clofibrate, niacin, and a combination of niacin and clofibrate). In conclusion, rapid time to benefit has been observed in older lifestyle and nonstatin trials that have included omega-3 fatty acids as a component of dietary therapy. Lifestyle changes in diet, physical activity, weight loss, and smoking cessation remain important and effective therapies with which significant long-term benefits can be expected.", 
    "97": "The effect of low-dose atorvastatin on various biomarkers was investigated in patients with type 2 diabetes complicated by hyperlipidemia. At 0 and 12 weeks in both the atorvastatin group (10 mg/d; n=17) and the no-drug group (n=10), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1, and fibrinogen were measured. At baseline, the entire group of diabetic patients (n=27) had significantly higher values of hsCRP and fibrinogen compared with those in age-matched healthy subjects (n=29): 0.801 (0.306, 1.760) vs 0.282 (0.143, 0.6505) mg/L, P=.0042; 329.1+/-55.0 vs 212.4+/-35.9 mg/dL, P<.0001, respectively. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein decreased significantly with atorvastatin treatment, from 0.801 (0.243, 1.865) to 0.308 (0.200, 0.804) mg/L (P=.0191). Although MCP-1, PAI-1, and fibrinogen did not decrease in the atorvastatin patients overall, the decrease of MCP-1 was significant in women (n=10; from 241.9+/-45.8 to 215.4+/-49.5 pg/mL, P=.0332). No correlation was found between changes in the serum lipid concentrations and changes in hsCRP, MCP-1, PAI-1, or fibrinogen in either the atorvastatin or the no-drug group. In conclusion, low-dose atorvastatin (10 mg/d) significantly decreased hsCRP in patients overall, and MCP-1 was also decreased in women. These findings suggest the possibility that atorvastatin provides an anti-inflammatory effect even at a low dose.", 
    "98": "The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor fluvastatin (Flu) on angiotensin II (AII)-stimulated neutrophils of patients with hypercholesterolemia. Results suggest that a 6-week-long Flu administration completely counteracted the AII-induced increase in superoxide anion and leukotriene C4 production of the neutrophils of patients with hypercholesterolemia. However, the failure of signal processing through pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein, the increase in [Ca2+]i in membrane-bound protein kinase C activity, and the increase in neutrophil-bound cholesterol content were only partially restored by Flu. In addition, Flu had no effect on the increased membrane rigidity of the neutrophils of patients with hypercholesterolemia. To sum it up, Flu administration had a beneficial effect on AII-triggered reactive oxygen species generation; it resulted in partial restoration of signaling processes and of membrane composition, but membrane fluidity remained unchanged.", 
    "99": "We evaluated the interaction between inflammation and survival benefit from statin therapy in patients who had acute myocardial infarction. Although 1-year mortality did not differ between patients who used statin therapy and those who did not, among patients who had C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations in the lower 2 tertiles (<2.9 mg/L), 1-year mortality was higher in patients who used statin therapy than in those who did not within the highest CRP-defined tertile (> or =2.9 mg/L). Statin therapy significantly decreased the hazard ratio for 1-year mortality in patients who had high CRP levels to approximately the hazard present for patients who had low CRP levels and did not receive statin therapy.", 
    "100": "We determined the effects of early statin treatment in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) on in-hospital morbidity and mortality. Experimental models of ischemia and reperfusion have shown that statins have early cardioprotective effects. However, the effect of statin use within the first 24 hours of admission on early morbidity and mortality in AMI has not been well studied. Data were collected on 300,823 patients who had AMI in the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction 4. In-hospital events were compared between patients who continued statin therapy received before the index AMI hospitalization (n = 17,118) or newly started statin therapy within the first 24 hours of hospitalization (n = 21,978) and patients who did not receive early statin treatment (n = 126,128) or whose statin therapy was discontinued (n = 9,411). New or continued treatment with a statin in the first 24 hours was associated with a decreased risk of mortality compared with no statin use (4.0% and 5.3% compared with 15.4% no statin). Discontinuation of statin treatment was associated with a slightly increased risk of mortality (16.5%). Early statin use was also associated with a lower incidence of cardiogenic shock, arrhythmias, cardiac arrest, rupture, but not recurrent myocardial infarction. Propensity analysis yielded mortality odds ratios of 0.46 for continued therapy, 0.42 for newly started therapy, and 1.25 for discontinued therapy for matched pairs versus no statin therapy (all p values <0.0001). In conclusion, the use of statin therapy within the first 24 hours of hospitalization for AMI is associated with a significantly lower rate of early complications and in-hospital mortality.",

Eight out of the sixteen strains of the genus Microbacterium are able to synthesize neurosporene, a precursor of lycopene and beta-carotene. The biosynthesis of carotenoids in some representatives of the genera Agromyces, Leifsonia, and Microbacterium is induced by light. Inhibition of the biosynthesis of isoprenoid pigments by fosmidomycin suggests that they are synthesized via the nonmevalonate pathway. Twelve strains are found to exhibit both the nonmevalonate and mevalonate pathways of isoprenoid synthesis.

All LDL mass-spectra can be subdivided into four subfractions (from 12 to 32 S at solvent density of 1.170 g/ml and a step of 5 S). Taking into consideration previous data on total electronegative charge of LDL subfractions flotation mass-spectra indicate that lovastatin caused reduction of total negative surface charge of LDL by 1.8-fold mainly due to reduction of (17-22) and (22-27) S. However, in patients with high level of triglycerols reduction of LDL electronegative charge was due to decrease of cholesterol in (12-17) S subfraction. The latter consists of the smallest particles of the highest density. Combined analysis of similarity in lipid parameters and flotation mass-spectra of LDL allows recognizing rather homogenous groups of patients demonstrating similar responsiveness to lovastatin therapy.", 
    "109": "High serum cholesterol level has been shown as one of the risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD), and epidemiological studies indicate that treatment with cholesterol-lowering substances, statins, may provide protection against AD. An acute-phase reaction and inflammation, with increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines, are well known in the AD brain. Notably, there is evidence for antiinflammatory activities of statins, such as reduction in proinflammatory cytokines. Consequently, it is of interest to analyze the effects of statins on microglia, the main source of inflammatory factors in the brain, such as in AD. The aims of this study were to determine the effects of statins (atorvastatin and simvastatin) on microglial cells with regard to the secretion of the inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) and cell viability after activation of the cells with bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS) or beta-amyloid1-40 (Abeta1-40) and in unstimulated cells. Cells of the human microglial cell line CHME-3 and primary cultures of rat neonatal cortical microglia were used. Incubation with LPS or Abeta1-40 induced secretion of IL-6, and Abeta1-40, but not LPS, reduced cell viability. Both atorvastatin and simvastatin reduced the basal secretion of IL-6 and the cell viability of the microglia, but only atorvastatin reduced LPS- and Abeta1-40-induced IL-6 secretion. Both statins potentiated the Abeta1-40-induced reduction in cell viability. The data indicate the importance of also considering the microglial responses to statins in evaluation of their effects in AD and other neurodegenerative disorders with an inflammatory component.",

The benefits of hypolipemic therapy in cardiovascular diseases cannot be explained only by the lipid-lowering potential of these agents. The aim of this study was to clarify the effect of hypolipemic agents on proinflammatory cytokine release from human monocytes in relationship with their action on plasma levels of sensitive systemic marker of low-grade vascular inflammation. Plasma lipid and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels, and the release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) and interleukin-1beta from monocytes were assessed at baseline and 30 and 90 days following randomization of IIa dyslipidemic patients into fluvastatin or simvastatin groups and randomization of type IIb dyslipidemic patients to the micronized form of either ciprofibrate or fenofibrate. Lipopolysaccharide-stimulated monocytes from dyslipidemic patients released significantly more TNFalpha (types IIa and IIb dyslipidemias) and interleukin-1beta (type IIa dyslipidemia) in comparison with monocytes in 59 age-, sex-, and weight-matched control subjects. Their baseline hsCRP levels were also higher. Both statins and fibrates reduced the release of TNFalpha and interleukin-1beta, and lowered plasma hsCRP levels. The effects of hypolipemic agents on cytokine release and plasma hsCRP were unrelated to their lipid-lowering action. Our results have demonstrated that type IIa and IIb dyslipidemic patients exhibit the abnormal pattern of TNFalpha and interleukin-1beta production by activated monocytes. Both HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and PPARalpha activators normalize monocytic secretion of these cytokines, and this action may partially contribute to the systemic antiinflammatory effect of hypolipemic agents. The statin- and fibrate-induced suppression of proinflammatory cytokine release from monocytes seems to play a role in their beneficial effect on the incidence of cardiovascular events.",

This may relate to methodological limitations (blood pressure measuring techniques) or to putative different effects of statins in different biologic conditions (cholesterol or blood pressure levels, age, etc). Patients with cholesterol>200 mg/dL and no previous statin treatment underwent 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) monitoring and were classified as normotensives or hypertensives according to their ABP. They were randomized to statin (n=51, simvastatin or pravastatin, 10-20 mg/d; atorvastatin, 5-10 mg/d) or control treatment (n=23, soy lecithin, 20 g/d) for 2 months, after which ABP assessment was repeated. No consistent treatment-related reduction in ABP was observed in lecithin-treated patients (either hypertensives or normotensives) or in statin-treated normotensive patients (-0.7+/-5.1/-1.0+/-4.6 mm Hg, both P=ns). In contrast, statin-treated hypertensive patients showed lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure (-5.7+/-5.8/-3.5+/-3.9 mm Hg, both P<0.001), the effect was entirely accounted for by reduced daytime values with no change in nighttime values, and it was unrelated to the concomitant statin-induced cholesterol reduction. Statins moderately but significantly lower blood pressure in patients with high (but not with normal) ABP; the effect is confined to the daytime period and is unrelated to the extent of the cholesterol lowering.",

The following month, the Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy-Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction 22 (PROVE IT-TIMI 22) study demonstrated the superiority of intensive (atorvastatin 80 mg/d) versus moderate (pravastatin 40 mg/d) lipid-lowering therapy for reducing death or cardiovascular events in patients suffering from an acute coronary syndrome.

Similarly, it resulted in a temporal increase in the relative market share of atorvastatin at a dose of 80 mg versus that of atorvastatin at a dose of 40 mg. However, the proportion of simvastatin prescriptions for 80 mg relative to 40 mg did not change over time, implying a drug-specific effect rather than a class effect in prescribing practice.",

We examined the association between Lp-PLA2 plasma concentrations and risk of stable coronary artery disease (CAD) in a large case-control study and further assessed the relationship between Lp-PLA2 and various lipid, inflammatory and hemostatic parameters. Lp-PLA2 concentrations were measured in 312 patients with CAD and in 479 age- and gender-matched blood donors. Various sensitive inflammatory and hemostatic markers and a complete lipoprotein profile were obtained. Lp-PLA2 concentrations were significantly higher in cases than in controls (296.1 ng/mL versus 266.0 ng/mL, p<0.0001). In multivariable logistic regression, the age- and gender-adjusted OR for the presence of CAD was 1.61 (95% CI, 1.07-2.44) if the top quartile of the Lp-PLA2 distribution was compared to the bottom quartile. Adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors and statin use resulted in an OR of 2.04 (95% CI, 1.19-3.48). After additional controlling for vWF, the OR was slightly attenuated but still remained statistically significant (OR 1.91; 95% CI, 1.12-3.28). Thus, elevated Lp-PLA2 concentrations were associated with the presence of stable CAD, independent of various biochemical markers. Our results support the hypothesis that Lp-PLA2 may be a novel, independent risk marker for CAD.",

However, the effect of this polymorphism on the response to hypolipaemic treatment has not been addressed. We evaluated the effect of this polymorphism on baseline lipids and lipoproteins and their response to treatment comprising 20mg/day pravastatin for 3 months. The study was multi-centred, prospective and interventional in 236 hypercholesterolaemic subjects (mean age 57.3 years; 45% males) from 21 Primary Health-care Centres. The lipid and genotype measurements were conducted centrally. The genotype distribution was 60.2% homozygous for the C allele and 36.0% heterozygous. No significant differences in baseline lipid concentrations between the genotypes were observed, except that carriers of the T allele had higher concentrations of triglycerides (p=0.021). Post-pravastatin, concentrations of HDL-C increased by 6.9% (95% CI: 2.9-10.8%) in those carrying the T allele with almost no change (0.8%) in the CC genotypes (95% CI: -2.3-4.0%) (p=0.019). The significance remained (p=0.014) following adjustment for other confounding factors (age, basal HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides). We conclude that the -514C/T polymorphism modulates significantly the HDL-C response to pravastatin, irrespective of the baseline lipoprotein concentrations.", 
    "132": "Therapeutic strategies to prevent atherosclerotic plaque progression and achieve plaque stabilization involve 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA)-reductase inhibitors (statins) and renin-angiotensin system (RAS)-blockade, but studies investigating the potentially additive effects of a combined treatment strategy are rare. We hypothesised that the adjunction of atorvastatin with telmisartan or ramipril might achieve additional effects on experimental atherosclerosis though statin-induced lipid-lowering is lacking. ApoE-/- mice were fed a high-fat diet for 12 weeks and randomized to either placebo (CON), atorvastatin (ATO), ramipril (RAM), telmisartan (TEL) or RAM+ATO and TEL+ATO (N=23 per group). RAS-blockade, but not ATO, reduced systolic blood pressure. None of the treatment regimens lowered systemic cholesterol levels or lipoprotein fractions. RAM, TEL and the combined therapy, but not ATO, significantly reduced aortic lipid deposition. All substances significantly reduced monocyte chemoattracting protein (MCP)-1 concentrations, macrophages and matrixmetalloproteinase (MMP)-9 content and enhanced plaque's content of tissue inhibitor of MMP (TIMP)-1, collagen and fibrous cap thickness, resulting in an overall decrease of advanced plaques (classified as types IV-VI). Additive effects of the adjunction were observed on MMP-9 gelatinolytic activity, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 plasma levels. These results indicate that a combined treatment with RAS-blockade and statins may have additive effects on systemic cardiovascular risk markers even in the absence of lipid-reduction, although additional effects on atherosclerotic plaque progression and stability were not observed in this model.", 
    "133": "Several studies in humans have demonstrated the hypocholesterolemic effect of plant sterol consumption. It is unclear whether plant sterols regulate lipoprotein metabolism in the liver and intestines, thereby decreasing the levels of circulating atherogenic lipoproteins. We investigated the effect of the three main phytosterols: stigmasterol, campesterol, and beta-sitosterol on lipoprotein production in HepG2 human liver cells and Caco2 human intestinal cells and the mechanisms involved. Cells were incubated for 24h with 50 micromol/L of the different phytosterols or 10 micromol/L of atorvastatin. Very low-density lipoprotein levels (measured by apolipoprotein (apo) B100) in HepG2 cells and chylomicron levels (measured by apoB48) in Caco2 cells were measured using western blotting. Intracellular cholesterol levels were measured using gas chromatography. Analysis was carried out using Student's t-test and ANOVA. Secretion levels of apoB100 significantly decreased by approximately 30% after incubation with all phytosterols compared to control. In addition, cholesterol ester (CE) concentrations significantly decreased when HepG2 cells were incubated with the phytosterols compared to control cells. Secretion of apoB48 from intestinal cells significantly decreased by 15% with stigmasterol, 16% with campesterol and 19% beta-sitosterol compared to control. Collectively the data suggests that plant sterols limit lipid (CE) availability in cells. Decreases in circulating levels of LDL and chylomicron remnants seen in humans with the consumption of margarine phytosterols are possibly due to their effect on lipid production in cells and would therefore reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular disease.",

In addition to treating the culprit lesion mechanically, admission for percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) for coronary artery disease (CAD) gives an opportunity for the interventional cardiologist to optimize medical therapy. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the current medical literature pertaining to cardiovascular (CV) risk reduction and vascular event prevention in the setting of PCI, with emphasis on antiplatelet therapies, beta-blockers, HMG-Co A reductase inhibitors (statins) and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, with regard to therapy optimization during PCI and for chronic CAD.

We evaluated how CYP3A4 metabolized statins and non-CYP3A4 metabolized statins influence platelet aggregation when given concomitantly with clopidogrel. Sixty-six stable patients with ischemic heart disease were included in this parallel group study. All patients were on clopidogrel and aspirin. Thirty-three patients received a CYP3A4 metabolized statin (simvastatin or atorvastatin), and 33 were treated with a non-CYP3A4 metabolized statin (pravastatin). The antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel was assessed at inclusion and 21 days after statin discontinuation. Platelet function was evaluated by two methods 1) optical platelet aggregometry after stimulation with 20 and 30 microM ADP, and 2 and 4 mg/l collagen, respectively, 2) a Platelet FunctionAnalyzer-100. The primary effect measure was final platelet aggregation after stimulation with 20 microM ADP. No difference was observed between patients treated with a CYP3A4 metabolized statin and patients receiving a non-CYP3A4 metabolized statin (30% point (7-42) versus 20% point (9-32), p = 0.83). Platelet aggregation was not improved by discontinuation of statins for 21 days. Indeed, we found that statin treatment given concomitantly with clopidogrel resulted in an improved platelet inhibition when compared to clopidogrel given alone. The antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel is not attenuated by concomitant treatment with a CYP3A4 metabolized statin in patients with clinical stable ischemic heart disease.", 
    "138": "The aim of the study was to determine whether a short-term treatment with simvastatin or fenofibrate may result in beneficial anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic effects in patients with high risk of coronary artery disease. In a randomized, double-blind study, we compared markers of inflammation, thrombin formation and platelet activation in patients with LDL cholesterol >130 mg/dl assigned to receive simvastatin (40 mg/d; n=20) or micronised fenofibrate (160 mg/d; n=22) for 28 days. Simvastatin, but not fenofibrate, lowered C-reactive protein (CRP) by 32% on day 3 (p<0.001), while both drugs reduced CRP significantly on day 28. Interleukin-6, soluble CD40 ligand, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 levels decreased significantly (by 20 to 50%) in both treatment groups on days 3 and 28. Soluble cell adhesion molecules remained unchanged in both groups. Simvastatin and fenofibrate significantly lowered plasma concentrations of thrombin-antithrombin complexes on days 3 and 28, but not platelet beta-thromboglobulin (betaTG) levels. Soluble P-selectin was lowered only in the simvastatin group. The total amount of thrombin generated at the site of microvascular injury also declined (by about 30%) as early as after 3 days of fenofibrate or simvastatin therapy, whereas beta TG release was reduced only in the simvastatin group on days 3 and 28. All the effects were independent of the changes in lipid profiles. Our results suggest that statins and fibrates can exert antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory effects as early as after 3 days of therapy. However, in contrast to statins, fibrates have no influence on platelet function within one month of therapy.",

Smoking-induced inflammation and other risk factors like dyslipidemia cause vascular endothelial damage via oxidative stress, and a vicious cycle with the characteristics of atherosclerosis ensues. Inflammatory cytokines stimulate hepatic acute-phase protein production, and C-reactive protein is now used widely to assess inflammation in the arterial wall. Smoking is associated with many alterations in lipids and lipoproteins, and is also prothrombotic. Global risk assessment, which determines the absolute risk for developing CHD in 10 years, is used widely to determine who should receive lipid-lowering therapy. Major CHD risk factors include age, sex, smoking, blood pressure, lipoproteins, and cholesterol, but COPD is not among them. Future studies should determine the absolute risk for developing CHD in patients with COPD. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A reductase inhibitors (statins) are used widely to treat and prevent cardiovascular disease. The statins may also produce other beneficial pleiotropic effects, including increased nitric oxide and prostacyclin, antithrombosis, and decreased inflammation, perhaps indicating utility in the therapy for COPD. Efforts are currently underway to determine if such antiinflammatory effects are independent of or in addition to simply lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.",

The aim of the present study was to examine the effects of different statins on hypoxia-induced endothelial cell signalling. Human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were treated with NaCN (CN, 2.5 mmol/l) to simulate a transient hypoxia. The CN-induced increase of endothelial cell numbers was significantly (n = 10, p < 0.01) reduced by the Ca(2+) chelator BAPTA (10 micromol/l), or the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger N-acetylcysteine (ACC, 1 mmol/l), or the NAD(P)H-oxidase inhibitor diphenyleneiodonium (DPI, 5 micromol/l). In detail, cell numbers were (in percentage of control): 163.24 (CN), 90.06 (CN+ACC), 92.06 (CN+DPI). Intracellular-Ca(2+) and -ROS, analysed by fluorescence imaging, were significantly increased by CN. Interestingly, the CN-induced increase of ROS was in part Ca(2+)-dependent, whereas the Ca(2+) increase was not ROS-dependent. Simvastatin (5 micromol/l), fluvastatin (2.5 micromol/l), and cerivastatin (0.1 micromol/l) all reduced CN-induced proliferation, ROS generation and Ca(2+) increase. Cell viability was not reduced by the statins and the antiproliferative effect was completely reversed by mevalonate (500 micromol/l). In conclusion our study demonstrates that statins block hypoxia-associated endothelial proliferation by preventing the increase of Ca(2+) and ROS.",

The symptoms appeared one day after start of the treatment with fluvastatin (40 mg) administered in order to diminish the endothelial activation induced by antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL). The patient suffered from severe manifestations of the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) including Catastrophic Antiphospholipid Syndrome (CAPS, Asherson's syndrome). In this case a single 40 mg dose of oral fluvastatin was linked to seizures.

Cerivastatin displayed a differential effect on CASMC as compared to CAEC with regard to proliferation and migration; both were more profoundly inhibited in CASMC. Appreciable cytotoxicity and pro-apoptotic effects were low in both cell lines at therapeutic concentrations. Cerivastatin-elution led to significant inhibition of neointima formation in the rat carotid stent model, endothelial coverage of in-stent vascular tissue was similar with control and cerivastatin-eluting stents.",

Lovastatin significantly decreases the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K) activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Expression of p85 subunit and its association with phosphotyrosine-containing proteins are unaffected by lovastatin. Lovastatin decreases protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt phosphorylation, and its downstream effectors, p70S6K and the eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) regulatory protein 1, 4E-BP1, in a concentration-dependent manner, and reduces p70S6K expression. Lovastatin effects are fully prevented with mevalonate. Only the highest dose of PI3-K inhibitors that significantly reduce PI3-K kinase activity induces apoptosis in neuroblasts but to a lower degree than lovastatin. In summary, this work shows that treatment of brain neuroblasts with lovastatin leads to an inhibition of the main pathway that controls cell growth and survival, PI3-K/PKB and the subsequent blockade of downstream proteins implicated in the regulation of protein synthesis. This work suggests that inactivation of the antiapoptotic PI3-K appears insufficient to induce the degree of neuroblasts apoptosis provoked by lovastatin, which must necessarily involve other intracellular pathways. These findings might contribute to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of some statins effects in the central nervous system.", 
    "154": "Recent research demonstrates the complexity and variety of pathophysiologic processes underlying cerebral ischemia. This review will focus on the multimodal effects of the various drugs currently used for stroke prevention. The most recent clinical studies of each will also be reviewed, and the implications for clinical use and future research discussed. An evolving approach for stroke prevention will include a combination of antiplatelets, increased use of statins, ACE inhibitors and possibly vitamin therapy.", 
    "155": "Ubiquinone (Ub) is the only known endogenously synthesized lipid soluble antioxidant. It is synthesized from intermediates in the cholesterol metabolic pathway. Our goal was to identify the Ubs and determine the concentration and distribution of Ubs in the rat lens and the effect of treatment with simvastatin, a cholesterol synthesis inhibitor, on lens levels.", 
    "156": "Intact lenses and separated lens fractions from young rats were homogenized in organic solvents, the Ubs recovered, and identified by HPLC analysis. Rats were fed Ub-10 to determine effects of supplementation on tissue levels. Sprague-Dawley (SD) and Chbb:Thom (CT) rats were treated with simvastatin, an inducer of cataracts in CT rats, to determine its effects on lens Ubs.", 
    "157": "Ubiquinone-9 (9 isoprenes in its hydrocarbon tail) was the main Ub in the rat lens. The intact lens contained about 3.0 microg Ub/g lens wet weight of which 80-90% was Ub-9 and the remainder Ub-10. No reduced Ubs were detected. Although the epithelial fraction contained the highest Ub concentration (about 8 microg/g), the cortex and nucleus combined accounted for about 90% of the lens' total content. Dietary supplementation with Ub-10 markedly increased the Ub-10 concentration in liver but not lens. Treatment with simvastatin decreased lens Ubs of both SD and CT rats by about 20%.", 
    "158": "The abundance of mitochondria in lens epithelium likely accounted for its high level of Ubs; but, finding most of the lens' total Ub in the cortex plus nucleus also suggests roles in maintaining the fiber cell membrane. The decrease in lens Ubs caused by simvastatin is interpreted to reflect a response to drug induced cellular stress rather than to inhibition of the cholesterol synthesis pathway.", 
    "159": "Activated Spisula oocytes proceed through meiotic stages rapidly and in near synchrony, providing an excellent system for analyzing polar body formation. Our previous studies suggested that cortical spreading of the metaphase peripheral aster determines spatial features of the cortical F-actin ring that is generated prior to extrusion of the polar body. We tested this hypothesis by experimentally altering the number and cortical contact patterns of peripheral asters. Such alteration was achieved by (a) lovastatin-induced arrest at metaphase I, with and without hexylene glycol modification, followed by washout; and (b) cytochalasin-D inhibition of extrusion of the first polar body, with washout before extrusion of the second polar body. Both methods induced simultaneous formation of two or more cortically spreading asters, correlated with subsequent formation of double, or even triple, overlapping F-actin rings during anaphase. Regardless of pattern, ring F-actin was deposited near regions of greatest astral microtubule density, indicating that microtubules provided a positive stimulus to which the cortex responded indiscriminately. These results strongly support the proposed causal relationship between peripheral aster spreading and biogenesis of the F-actin ring involved in polar body formation.", 
    "160": "The aim of this study was to characterize the role of the efflux transporter Mrp2 (Abcc2) in the pharmacokinetics of orally and intravenously administered pravastatin in rats. Eight Mrp2-deficient TR- rats and eight wild-type rats were given an oral dose of 20 mg/kg pravastatin. Four TR- animals and four wild-type animals were studied after intravenous administration of pravastatin (5 mg/kg). The TR(-) rats showed a 6.1-fold higher mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of pravastatin (p < 0.001) after oral administration and a 4.7-fold higher AUC (p < 0.01) after intravenous administration of pravastatin as compared with the wild-type animals. The mean systemic (total) clearance of pravastatin was 4.6-fold higher (39.2 versus 8.50 l/h/kg, p < 0.001) and the mean V 4.3-fold higher (14.1 versus 3.29 l/kg, p < 0.01) in the wild-type rats. The mean renal clearance of pravastatin in the TR(-) rats was 16.5-fold increased as compared with the wild-type animals (0.695 versus 0.042 l/h/kg, p < 0.05). The increased systemic exposure to oral pravastatin in the TR- rats was associated with a greater inhibitory effect on 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase, as shown by smaller lathosterol to cholesterol concentration ratios. These results suggest that the reduced biliary pravastatin excretion in the Mrp2-deficient TR- rats is partly compensated for by increased urinary excretion of pravastatin. Furthermore, intestinal Mrp2 does not appear to play a major role in the oral absorption of pravastatin in normal rats.", 
    "161": "Growing evidence from epidemiological studies suggests that osteoarthritis (OA) is linked to atheromatous vascular disease. This hypothesis article proposes that OA, or at least OA structural progression, may be an atheromatous vascular disease of subchondral bone. Further epidemiological studies, imaging investigations of relevant blood vessels, and trials of the effects of statins on the prevention and treatment of OA are needed to examine this hypothesis.", 
    "162": "To investigate whether population based primary prevention (risk factor reduction in apparently healthy people) might be more powerful than current government initiatives favouring risk factor reduction in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) (secondary prevention).", 
    "163": "The IMPACT model was used to synthesise data for England and Wales describing CHD patient numbers, uptake of specific treatments, trends in major cardiovascular risk factors, and the mortality benefits of these specific risk factor changes in healthy people and in CHD patients.", 
    "164": "Between 1981 and 2000, CHD mortality rates fell by 54%, resulting in 68,230 fewer deaths in 2000. Overall smoking prevalence declined by 35% between 1981 and 2000, resulting in approximately 29,715 (minimum estimate 20 035, maximum estimate 44,675) fewer deaths attributable to smoking cessation: approximately 5035 in known CHD patients and approximately 24,680 in healthy people. Population total cholesterol concentrations fell by 4.2%, resulting in approximately 5770 fewer deaths attributable to dietary changes (1205 in CHD patients and 4565 in healthy people) plus 2135 fewer deaths attributable to statin treatment (1990 in CHD patients, 145 in people without CHD). Mean population blood pressure fell by 7.7%, resulting in approximately 5870 fewer deaths attributable to secular falls in blood pressure (520 in CHD patients and 5345 in healthy people) plus approximately 1890 fewer deaths attributable to antihypertensive treatments in people without CHD. Approximately 45,370 fewer deaths were thus attributable to reductions in the three major risk factors in the population: some 36 625 (81%) in people without recognised CHD and 8745 (19%) in CHD patients.", 
    "165": "Compared with secondary prevention, primary prevention achieved a fourfold larger reduction in deaths. Future CHD policies should prioritise population-wide tobacco control and healthier diets.", 
    "166": "Statin treatment has been demonstrated to diminish the risk for stroke in patients with coronary heart disease, hypercholesterolemia, normocholesterolemia, in the elderly, and among hypertensive and diabetic patients. Stroke incidence in patients on statin treatment has been reduced in all these clinical settings involving both primary and secondary prevention but not in patients with previous stroke. Two recent meta-analyses confirm this conclusion. The mechanism by which statins provide benefit against stroke is likely multifactorial, involving both the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol-lowering effect with stabilization of vulnerable plaques, and pleiotropic effects such as improvement of endothelial function, increased nitric oxide bioavailability, antioxidant properties, inhibition of inflammatory responses, immunomodulatory actions, and regulation of progenitor cells."
