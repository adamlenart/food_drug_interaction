Despite the protective effects of statin therapy, the epidemiological association between lipid components and cerebrovascular events is less clear. We therefore assessed the strength of association between in-trial lipoprotein components and cerebrovascular disease in patients receiving intensive lipid-lowering therapy.", 
    "1": "In 9247 patients (mean age 61\u00b70 years, 81\u00b72% males), the association between lipoprotein components and the risk of cerebrovascular events after the first year into the TNT trial was assessed after stratification of lipoprotein components into approximate quartiles. Cox proportional hazards models were used to explore the association between lipoprotein components and time to first cerebrovascular event after adjustment for potential confounding variables.", 
    "2": "All lipoprotein components, except LDL-C, showed a significant gradient for incidence of cerebrovascular events with increasing quartiles of the lipoprotein component. If the lipoprotein components were treated as continuous variables, the adjusted hazard ratios (95% CI) for cerebrovascular events for 1 SD difference in 1-year lipoprotein components were 1\u00b713 (1\u00b702-1\u00b725) for LDL-C, 0\u00b786 (0\u00b776-0\u00b797) for HDL-C, 1\u00b717 (1\u00b704-1\u00b728) for apoB, 0\u00b783 (0\u00b774-0\u00b794) for apoA-1, 1\u00b722 (1\u00b710-1\u00b734) for TC/HDL-C and 1\u00b724 (1\u00b712-1\u00b737) for apoB/apoA-1.",

    "4": "Statins are one of the most important medications in cardio-vascular diseases since they block cholesterol synthesis by inhibiting the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and thus reduce low density lipoprotein concentrations. In the last years, numerous pleiotropic properties of statins have been described, beyond their well-known lipid lowering function. In particular, they are able to modulate inflammation, which plays a pivotal role in the atherosclerotic process. Several trials have shown a direct correlation between statin therapy and lower C-reactive protein concentrations. Moreover, a large body of pathophysiological studies has demonstrated that statins lower cytokine concentrations and inhibit recruitment, migration and cell adhesion to endothelium by attenuating chemokine production. They also inhibit inflammatory pathways regulated by proteins as Ras and Rho, and increase nitric oxide production which exerts a protective effect on endothelium. In addition to reducing inflammation in coronary atherosclerosis, statins also have beneficial effects in chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, such as psoriasis, and they could induce clinical improvement. Statins seem to exert benefits even in settings of infection. These results suggest that initiating and monitoring statin therapy on the basis of inflammatory markers, in particular C-reactive protein, may improve cardiovascular prevention and treatment.", 
    "5": "Renovascular disease remains among the most prevalent and important causes of secondary hypertension and renal dysfunction. Many lesions reduce perfusion pressure including fibromuscular diseases and renal infarction, but most are caused by atherosclerotic disease. Epidemiologic studies establish a strong association between atherosclerotic renal-artery stenosis (ARAS) and cardiovascular risk. Hypertension develops in patients with renovascular disease from a complex set of pressor signals, including activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), recruitment of oxidative stress pathways, and sympathoadrenergic activation. Although the kidney maintains function over a broad range of autoregulation, sustained reduction in renal perfusion leads to disturbed microvascular function, vascular rarefaction, and ultimately development of interstitial fibrosis. Advances in antihypertensive drug therapy and intensive risk factor management including smoking cessation and statin therapy can provide excellent blood pressure control for many individuals. Despite extensive observational experience with renal revascularization in patients with renovascular hypertension, recent prospective randomized trials fail to establish compelling benefits either with endovascular stents or with surgery when added to effective medical therapy. These trials are limited and exclude many patients most likely to benefit from revascularization. Meaningful recovery of kidney function after revascularization is limited once fibrosis is established. Recent experimental studies indicate that mechanisms allowing repair and regeneration of parenchymal kidney tissue may lead to improved outcomes in the future. Until additional staging tools become available, clinicians will be forced to individualize therapy carefully to optimize the potential benefits regarding both blood pressure and renal function for such patients.",

Fluvastatin significantly increased the transcriptional activity of the ARE. Electromobility shift assays using an ARE probe detected a complex that was significantly increased in intensity by fluvastatin. Western blotting and luciferase assay revealed fluvastatin activated Nrf2 via the PI3K/Akt pathway. Statins upregulated the Nrf2-related antioxidant genes heme oxygenase-1, NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase-1, and glutamate-cysteine ligase modifier subunits. Inhibition of Nrf2 by siRNA reduced statin-induced upregulation of these antioxidant genes. Moreover, Nrf2 siRNA markedly reduced the cytoprotective effects of fluvastatin against H(2)O(2) administration in hCASMCs.",

    "19": "In addition to lowering cholesterol, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, or statins, have been shown to modulate gene expression in endothelial cells. The effect of statins on cell adhesion molecule expression is unclear and largely unexplored in endothelial cells exposed to shear stress, an important regulator of endothelial cell function. In this study, the effect of simvastatin on vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expression was evaluated in human abdominal aortic endothelial cells (HAAEC) conditioned with various levels of laminar wall shear stress with or without tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1). As expected, TNF\u03b1 alone greatly enhanced both VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 mRNA and protein. In static culture, simvastatin potentiated the TNF\u03b1-induced increase in VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 mRNA but not total protein at 24 h. Mevalonate, a precursor to cholesterol biosynthesis, eliminated the effect of simvastatin. Exposure of endothelial cells to elevated levels of laminar shear stress during simvastatin treatment prevented the potentiating effect of simvastatin on cell adhesion molecule mRNA. A shear stress of 12.5 dyn/cm\u00b2 eliminated the increase in VCAM-1 by simvastatin, while 25 dyn/cm\u00b2 was needed for ICAM-1. We conclude that simvastatin enhances VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 gene expression in TNF\u03b1-activated endothelial cells through inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase. High levels of laminar shear stress prevented the upregulation of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 by simvastatin suggesting that an induction of cell adhesion molecules by statins may not occur in endothelial cells exposed to shear stress from blood flow.", 
    "20": "Aortic stenosis is the most common valvular heart disease among adult subjects in western countries The current treatment for aortic stenosis is aortic valve replacement. The possibility of a medical treatment that can slow the progression of aortic stenosis is very fascinating and statins have been tested to reduce the progression of degenerative aortic stenosis (DAS). The rationale for statin treatment in DAS has a deep pathophysiological substrate, in fact inflammation and lipid infiltration constitute the same histopathological pattern of both aortic stenosis and atherosclerosis and these two conditions have the same risk factors. Whether retrospective studies have shown some efficacy of statins in halting the progression of DAS, prospective trials have shown controversial results. A recently published large and randomized controlled trial SEAS found that statins have no significant effect on the progression of aortic stenosis, the ASTRONOMER, recently confirmed this data. The most plausible hypothesis is that coronary artery disease and DAS, have a common pathogenetic background and a distinct evolution due to different factors (mechanical stress, genetic factors, interaction between inflammatory cells and calcification mediators). Thus, treatment with statins is not recommended in patients with valvular aortic stenosis and without conventional indications to lipid-lowering treatment.",

At the end of a 4-week period, 1 h peritoneal equilibration test was performed. Serum lipids and certain cytokines, mediators, markers, and antioxidant enzyme activities in serum and dialysate were studied. Peritoneal thickness was measured and peritoneal inflammation, fibrosis, and vascular proliferation were scored in histological sections.", 
    "23": "In histological examinations, inflammation, fibrosis, and vascular proliferation were significantly more frequent in PD group than Sham group and it seemed to decrease significantly when atorvastatin was used in conjunction with PD. Additionally, peritoneum was significantly thicker in PD group when compared to that of Sham and TX groups. Serum parameters did not significantly differ between groups. On the other hand, dialysate glutathione reductase (GR) activity and TGF-\u03b2 were significantly lower in TX group than that of the PD group, whereas dialysate IL-6 level was higher in TX group.",

    "25": "Cardiovascular diseases are the most common causes of death in Germany and the prevalence is increased in patients with inflammatory rheumatic diseases. Statins are often employed for primary and secondary prophylaxis of cardiovascular events but can potentially induce myopathy as a side-effect. In addition to an asymptomatic elevation of muscle enzymes, myalgia and myositis as well as rhabdomyolysis, the most severe side-effect, have been observed, which are mostly manifested within 6 months after initiation of therapy. Statin-induced myopathy is rare but if risk factors are present, the individual risk can be much higher. Such factors are in particular interaction with other medications, statin dosage, the characteristics of the statin preparation used, comorbidities, age and sex of the patient. Regular testing of muscle enzymes after induction of statin therapy is not generally recommended for asymptomatic patients, but is indispensable when muscle symptoms appear. Statin therapy must be immediately terminated and a diagnostic evaluation must be carried out at the latest when creatine kinase values show a more than 10-fold increase.",

Among older US adults with dyslipidemia, 51.2% have \u2265 1 of the cardiovascular conditions studied. Among those who are receiving lipid-lowering medication, 55.3% report having comorbidities that put them at high risk for new or recurring cardiovascular events. Even more noteworthy is that 47.5% of dyslipidemic older adults who are not taking statins also have significant comorbidities. This highlights a critical unmet medical need for this growing population, which, solely based on age, is more likely to be at risk for cardiovascular events.",

Mechanisms, indications, clinical forms, doses, and side effects of the traditional antianginal agents - nitrates, \u03b2-blockers, and calcium channel blockers - are reviewed. A number of patients have contraindications or remain unrelieved from anginal discomfort with these drugs. Among newer alternatives, ranolazine, recently approved in the United States, indirectly prevents the intracellular calcium overload involved in cardiac ischemia and is a welcome addition to available treatments. None, however, are disease-modifying agents. Two options for refractory angina, enhanced external counterpulsation and spinal cord stimulation (SCS), are presented in detail. They are both well-studied and are effective means of treating at least some patients with this perplexing form of angina. Traditional modifiable risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) - smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, and obesity - account for most of the population-attributable risk. Individual therapy of high-risk patients differs from population-wide efforts to prevent risk factors from appearing or reducing their severity, in order to lower the national burden of disease. Current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines to lower risk in patients with chronic angina are reviewed. The Clinical Outcomes Utilizing Revascularization and Aggressive Drug Evaluation (COURAGE) trial showed that in patients with stable angina, optimal medical therapy alone and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) with medical therapy were equal in preventing myocardial infarction and death. The integration of COURAGE results into current practice is discussed. For patients who are unstable, with very high risk, with left main coronary artery lesions, in whom medical therapy fails, and in those with acute coronary syndromes, PCI is indicated. Asymptomatic patients with CAD and those with stable angina may defer intervention without additional risk to see if they will improve on optimum medical therapy. For many patients, coronary artery bypass surgery offers the best opportunity for relieving angina, reducing the need for additional revascularization procedures and improving survival. Optimal medical therapy, percutaneous coronary intervention, and surgery are not competing therapies, but are complementary and form a continuum, each filling an important evidence-based need in modern comprehensive management.", 
    "45": "Statins have been shown to downregulate the systemic inflammatory response after cardiopulmonary bypass. However, the role of statins as anti-inflammatory agents in heart tissue remains unknown. The aim of this study was to test whether statin pretreatment attenuates local inflammatory cytokines production in heart and to explore whether the underlying mechanism involves peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) \u03b3. A rat model of cardiopulmonary bypass was established. The animals were pretreated with simvastatin 5 mg/kg/day or 10 mg/kg/day for 7 days before operation. The serum concentration and myocardial level of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 was evaluated by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The polymorphonuclear neutrophils accumulation in heart tissue was determined by myeloperoxidase activity assay. The activity of nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB and PPAR\u03b3 in the heart was determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The myocardial PPAR\u03b3 expression was also examined by immunohistochemistry. The systemic and local TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and MCP-1 were all significantly elevated after cardiopulmonary bypass. In contrast, simvastatin pretreatment significantly decreases the serum and myocardial expression level of above cytokines, myocardial myeloperoxidase activity and myocardial NF-\u03baB activity. However, there was an evident increase in the activity and expression of PPAR\u03b3. In conclusion, simvastatin pretreatment not only attenuates acute systemic and local inflammatory response induced by cardiopulmonary bypass.

    "51": "Statins have attracted interest as a treatment option for multiple sclerosis (MS) because of their pleiotropic antiinflammatory and immunomodulatory effects. However, contradictory results have been described when they are applied to oligodendrocytes (OLGs), the cell type predominantly affected in MS. In this study we focus on the in vitro effect of statins on process outgrowth in OLN-93 cells, a well-characterized OLG-derived cell line, and primary cultures of neonatal rat OLGs. Application of the lipophilic simvastatin, as low as 0.1-1 \u03bcM, disturbs process formation of both cell types, leading to less ramified cells. We show that both protein isoprenylation and cholesterol synthesis are required for the normal differentiation of OLGs. It is further demonstrated that the expression of 2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide-3' phosphodiesterase (CNP) and tubulin is lowered, concomitant with a reduction of membrane-bound CNP as well as tubulin. Therefore, we propose that lack of isoprenylation of CNP could help to explain the altered morphological and biochemical differentiation state of treated OLGs. Moreover, expression of specific myelin markers, such as myelin basic protein, myelin-associated glycoprotein, and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein, was compromised after treatment. We conclude that simvastatin treatment has detrimental effects on OLG process outgrowth, the prior step in (re)myelination, thereby mortgaging long-term healing of MS lesions.",

    "67": "Pravastatin has neuroprotective effects against aging but its role in brain injury remains unclear. This study evaluated the effects of pravastatin on the ultrastructural changes and hemorheological parameters in rats after traumatic brain injury (TBI) of right parietal cortical contusion by a controlled weight-dropping method. There were three groups: (I) Sham operated group; (II) TBI + vehicle (saline) group; and (III) TBI + pravastatin group. Right parietal craniectomy was performed in all groups. In TBI + pravastatin group, pravastatin was administered orally at a dose of 1 mg/kg every day for 7 days starting at 24 hours after the injury. Plasma viscosity, erythrocyte deformability and erythrocyte aggregation were measured from blood samples of all rats on 2nd, 7th and 15th days. At the same time electron microscopic study was done on designated days for groups II and III. Treatment with pravastatin markedly increased aggregation amplitude and \u03b3Isc max values and significantly decreased erythrocyte deformability but did not change plasma viscosity in 2 weeks time. Ultrastructural parameters such as perinuclear edema, mitochondrial swelling and intraneuronal vacuoles were detected in lower degree in the statin group when compared to the saline group, especially decreased demyelinization and endothelial detachment was prominent. As a result, the hyperviscosity state with increased erythrocyte aggregation and decreased erythrocyte deformability induced by pravastatin in this study was accompanied by an improvement of the ultrastructural findings in TBI. This hyperviscosity state may be a compensatory mechanism to increase the oxygenation of the injured tissue by inducing the release of antiaggregant and vasodilatory substances by increasing shear stress. Therefore, we suggest that prolonged pravastatin usage may exert affirmative effects on traumatic brain injury conditions by increasing blood viscosity.", 
    "68": "Several charts or tables are used to guide treatment in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). These usually relate to patients up to 75 years of age, leaving older patients without guidance. Most also present this information as risk, leaving patients to estimate the benefit of treatment and decide whether it is worthwhile. We present tables to display both CVD risk and benefit from treatment in the elderly. A systematic review identified CVD risk functions for the elderly. The Dubbo study of older patients' 5-year CVD risk equation was deemed most appropriate, due to the population studied, endpoints observed and risk factors recorded. By dichotomizing most risk factors, we produced a new risk table in the form of the original 'Sheffield table'. Risk is calculated by selecting the appropriate table for gender and the appropriate cell from the rows and columns, representing age and risk factor contributors, respectively. Total cholesterol above a cell value corresponds to a 20 or 40% 10-year CVD risk. A simple risk scoring system was then derived from the Dubbo equation. Calculation of risk score requires knowledge of a patient's simple demographics, systolic blood pressure and total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Positive integers corresponding to level of risk for each contributing factor are then added together to give a final risk score. A Markov chain model was produced based on the Dubbo derived risk and relative risk reductions from published meta-analyses of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and anti-hypertensive treatment. Using this model, individual scores were mapped to likely benefit from treatment in terms of disease free years. Our risk table provides a simple means for calculating risk in the elderly, to two major thresholds, while the benefit table explores the concept of presenting benefit of taking CVD-preventing medication.", 
    "69": "The aim of this study was to determine the therapeutic efficacy of simvastatin treatment starting 1 day after spinal cord injury (SCI) in rat and to investigate the underlying mechanism. Spinal cord injury was induced in adult female Sprague-Dawley rats after laminectomy at T9-T10. Then additionally with sham group (laminectomy only) the SCI animals were randomly divided into 3 groups: vehicle-treated group; 5-mg/kg simvastatin-treated group; and 10-mg/kg simvastatin-treated group. Simvastatin or vehicle was administered orally at 1 day after SCI and then daily for 5 weeks. Locomotor functional recovery was assessed during 8 weeks postoperation by performing open-field locomotor test and inclined-plane test. At the end of study, motor evoked potentials (MEPs) and somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were assessed to evaluate the integrity of spinal cord pathways. Then, the animals were killed, and 1-cm segments of spinal cord encompassing the injury site were removed for histopathological analysis. Immunohistochemistry was performed to observe the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in the spinal cord. Results show that the simvastatin-treated animals showed significantly better locomotor function recovery, better electrophysiological outcome, less myelin loss, and higher expression of BDNF and GDNF. These findings suggest that simvastatin treatment starting 1 day after SCI can significantly improve locomotor recovery, and this neuroprotective effect may be related to the upregulation of BDNF and GDNF. Therefore, simvastatin may be useful as a promising therapeutic agent for SCI.",

However, precise mechanisms of the EPO-induced proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells are not certain. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are primarily used to reduce cholesterol levels, but also exert other effects, including reno-protective effects. We evaluated the effect of several statins with various hydrophilicities on the EPO-induced proliferation of primary cultured rat vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in vitro. EPO significantly and concentration-dependently increased DNA synthesis as assessed by [\u00b3H]thymidine incorporation, cell proliferation as assessed by WST-1 assay, and activation of the p44/42MAPK pathway. Therapeutic doses of statins (pravastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin and fluvastatin) in patients with hypercholesterolemia almost completely suppressed all of the EPO-induced effects in a concentration-dependent manner. Co-addition of mevalonic acid almost completely reversed the effects of statins. Statin alone did not affect the basal proliferation capacity of the cells. The effects were almost similar among the statins. We concluded that statins inhibited EPO-induced proliferation in rat VSMCs at least partly through their inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase activity. In the future, statins might prove useful for the treatment of EPO-induced hyperplasia of vascular access. Because the statins all showed comparable effects irrespective of their hydrophilicities, these effects might be a class effect.",

In this study, catalytic activities of the two alleles found in East Asians, CYP3A4*16 (T185S) and CYP3A4*18 (L293P), were assessed using the following seven substrates: midazolam, carbamazepine, atorvastatin, paclitaxel, docetaxel, irinotecan, and terfenadine. The holoprotein levels of CYP3A4.16 and CYP3A4.18 were significantly higher and lower, respectively, than that of CYP3A4.1 when expressed in Sf21 insect cell microsomes together with human NADPH-P450 reductase. CYP3A4.16 exhibited intrinsic clearances (V(max)/K(m)) that were lowered considerably (by 84-60%) for metabolism of midazolam, carbamazepine, atorvastatin, paclitaxel, and irinotecan compared with CYP3A4.1 due to increased K(m) with or without decreased V(max) values, whereas no apparent decrease in intrinsic clearance was observed for docetaxel. On the other hand, K(m) values for CYP3A4.18 were comparable to those for CYP3A4.1 for all substrates except terfenadine; but V(max) values were lower for midazolam, paclitaxel, docetaxel, and irinotecan, resulting in partially reduced intrinsic clearance values (by 34-52%). These results demonstrated that the impacts of both alleles on CYP3A4 catalytic activities depend on the substrates used. Thus, to evaluate the influences of both alleles on the pharmacokinetics of CYP3A4-metabolized drugs and their drug-drug interactions, substrate drug-dependent characteristics should be considered for each drug.", 
    "98": "In patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), a J-curve relationship has been reported between blood pressure (BP) and future cardiovascular events. However, this is controversial. The purpose of the study was to determine the relationship between on-treatment BP and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with CAD.", 
    "99": "We evaluated 10 001 patients with CAD and a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level <130 mg/dL, randomized to atorvastatin 80 vs. 10 mg, enrolled in the TNT trial. The post-baseline, time-dependent BPs [systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP)] were categorized into 10 mmHg increments. The primary outcome was a composite of death from coronary disease, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), resuscitated cardiac arrest, and fatal or non-fatal stroke. Among the 10 001 patients, 982 (9.82%) experienced a primary outcome at 4.9 years (median) of follow-up. The relationship between SBP or DBP and primary outcome followed a J-curve with increased event rates above and below the reference BP range, both unadjusted and adjusted (for baseline covariates, treatment effect, and LDL levels). A time-dependent, non-linear, multivariate Cox proportional hazard model identified a nadir of 146.3/81.4 mmHg where the event rate was lowest. A similar non-linear relationship with a higher risk of events at lower pressures was found for most of the secondary outcomes of all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal MI, or angina. However, for the outcome of stroke, lower was better for SBP.",

Animals were grouped (n = 10) to receive local injection of saline without cells (control and simvastatin groups) or with 5 \u00d7 106 MSCs (MSCs group). Animals received either simvastatin (20 mg/kg/d, simvastatin and combination groups) or saline(control and MSCs group) gavages for continual 21 days. The blood flow was assessed by laser Doppler imaging at day 0,10 and 21 after surgery, respectively. Ischemic muscle was harvested for immunohistological assessments and for VEGF protein detection using western blot assay at 21 days post-surgery. In vitro, MSCs viability was measured by MTT and flow cytometry following culture in serum-free medium for 24 h with or without simvastatin. Release of VEGF by MSCs incubated with different doses of simvastatin was assayed using ELISA.", 
    "103": "Combined treatment with simvastatin and MSCs induced a significant improvement in blood reperfusion, a notable increase in capillary density, a highest level of VEGF protein and a significant decrease in muscle cell apoptosis compared with other groups. In vitro, simvastatin inhibited MSCs apoptosis and increased VEGF release by MSCs.",

    "105": "There are accepted the lipid levels goals in all world, which are needed to achievement in primary and secondary prevention. Despite efficacy of current standards of care (including achievement of LDL-C, blood pressure and blood sugar goals), patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia (DLP) (high TG levels, low HDL-C, high apolipoprotein B and small dense LDL-particles), which is common in patients with diabetes melitus (DM), metabolic syndrome or cardiovascular diseases (KVD), remain exposed to a high residual risk of major cardiovascular events and microvascular complications. Statin therapy does not adequately address vascular risk asociated with elevated triglycerides (TG) and low HDL-C levels. As ACCORD lipid trial last time shows, the addition of lipid-modifying activity of fenofibrate to statin therapy benefited only certain subgroups of patients at increased cardiometabolic risk.", 
    "106": "In an observational study, we examined the effect of statins on low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) subfractions.Using density-gradient ultracentrifugation, we measured small, dense LDL density in 612 patients (mean age, 61.7 \u00b1 12.6 yr), some with and some without coronary artery disease, who were placed in a statin-treated group (n=172) or a control group (n=440) and subdivided on the basis of coronary artery disease status.Total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, and the LDL cholesterol/apolipoprotein B ratio were significantly lower in the statin group. However, the proportion of small, dense LDL was higher in the statin group (42.9% \u00b1 9.5% vs 41.3% \u00b1 8.5%; P=0.046) and the proportion of large, buoyant LDL was lower (23.6% \u00b1 7.5% vs 25.4% \u00b1 7.9%; P=0.011). In the statin group, persons without coronary artery disease had higher proportions of small, dense LDL, and persons with coronary artery disease tended to have higher proportions of small, dense LDL.Our study suggests that statin therapy--whether or not recipients have coronary artery disease--does not decrease the proportion of small, dense LDL among total LDL particles, but in fact increases it, while predictably reducing total LDL cholesterol, absolute amounts of small, dense LDL, and absolute amounts of large, buoyant LDL. If and when our observation proves to be reproducible in subsequent large-scale studies, it should provide new insights into small, dense LDL and its actual role in atherogenesis or the progression of atherosclerosis.", 
    "107": "Stroke is a major public health problem. It is the third leading cause of death worldwide and results in hospital admissions, morbidity, and long-term disability. Despite the inconsistent or weak association between cholesterol and stroke, statins can reduce the incidence of stroke in high-risk populations and in patients with a stroke or transient ischaemic attack.", 
    "108": "The aim of our study was to review the efficacy of statin therapy in both primary and secondary stroke prevention. We also reviewed the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness among different statins and we also reviewed the possible effect of treatment added to statin monotherapy.", 
    "109": "There is evidence that statin therapy in both primary and secondary prevention significantly reduces subsequent major coronary events but only marginally reduces the risk of stroke recurrence. There is no clear evidence of beneficial effect from statins in those with previous haemorrhagic stroke and it is unclear whether statins should be started immediately post stroke or later. There is a pressing need for direct evidence, from head-to-head trials, to determine whether individual statins provide differing protection from clinically important events in stroke prevention. It is possible that combinations of lipid-lowering agents did not improve clinical outcomes more than high-dose statin monotherapy, although clinical trials are still ongoing.", 
    "110": "Coronary artery stenoses have been shown in various trials to be moderated by treatment with statins. A similar effect on coronary artery calcification has not been demonstrated. We therefore undertook meta-analyses of trials examining the effect of statin treatment on coronary artery stenoses and coronary artery calcification.", 
    "111": "Literature searches identified five controlled trials suitable for inclusion in the analysis of the effect of statins (high dose versus either low dose or placebo) on coronary artery calcification and six trials suitable for inclusion in the analysis of the effect of statins on coronary artery stenoses.", 
    "112": "All trials reported substantial and significant reductions in LDL-C with statin treatment which results in net reductions of LDL-C in the CAC and coronary stenoses trials of 1.0 mmol/L and 0.9 mmol/L, respectively. Analysis of the CAC trials did not demonstrate any effect of statins on the progression of calcification. In contrast, in the coronary stenoses trials there was a consistent moderation of stenosis severity progression with statins (p<0.0001).", 
    "113": "Meta-analyses of the available trials have demonstrated a significant moderation of coronary stenoses associated with the statin-induced reduction in LDL-C. In contrast, there was no effect on coronary calcification despite a similar reduction in LDL-C levels. This suggests that the pathogenesis of the two conditions may be different, if not in aetiology, then certainly in their development. It further suggests that statin use to moderate arterial calcification is not effective.", 
    "114": "Melanomas are highly malignant and have high metastatic potential; hence, there is a need for new therapeutic strategies to prevent cell metastasis. In the present study, we investigated whether statins inhibit tumor cell migration, invasion, adhesion, and metastasis in the B16BL6 mouse melanoma cell line.", 
    "115": "The cytotoxicity of statins toward the B16BL6 cells were evaluated using a cell viability assay. As an experimental model, B16BL6 cells were intravenously injected into C57BL/6 mice. Cell migration and invasion were assessed using Boyden chamber assays. Cell adhesion analysis was performed using type I collagen-, type IV collagen-, fibronectin-, and laminin-coated plates. The mRNA levels, enzyme activities and protein levels of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) were determined using RT-PCR, activity assay kits, and Western blot analysis, respectively; the mRNA and protein levels of vary late antigens (VLAs) were also determined. The effects of statins on signal transduction molecules were determined by western blot analyses.", 
    "116": "We found that statins significantly inhibited lung metastasis, cell migration, invasion, and adhesion at concentrations that did not have cytotoxic effects on B16BL6 cells. Statins also inhibited the mRNA expressions and enzymatic activities of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Moreover, they suppressed the mRNA and protein expressions of integrin \u03b12, integrin \u03b14, and integrin \u03b15 and decreased the membrane localization of Rho, and phosphorylated LIM kinase (LIMK) and myosin light chain (MLC).", 
    "117": "The results indicated that statins suppressed the Rho/Rho-associated coiled-coil-containing protein kinase (ROCK) pathways, thereby inhibiting B16BL6 cell migration, invasion, adhesion, and metastasis. Furthermore, they markedly inhibited clinically evident metastasis. Thus, these findings suggest that statins have potential clinical applications for the treatment of tumor cell metastasis.", 
    "118": "Ezetimibe, an inhibitor of cholesterol intestinal absorption, is a lipid lowering agent with potential pleiotropic actions. Ezetimibe in combination with a statin is effective in decreasing low density lipoprotein cholesterol(LDL-C), lowering triglyceride and raising high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Ezetimibe plus statin achieve LDL-C targets in a greater proportion of patients than statin monotherapy. Ezetimibe also seems to improve renal function, insulin resistance and inflammatory markers. These actions are useful in patients with diabetes. Ezetimibe is a well-tolerated and effective (in terms of achieving LDL-C targets) option inpatients with hyperlipidemia with or without diabetes. This editorial will discuss several properties of ezetimibe, with special reference to diabetes.", 
    "119": "Density functional theory was applied to study the binding mode of new flavonoids as possible inhibitors of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR), an enzyme that catalyzes the four-electron reduction of HMGCoA to mevalonate, the committed step in the biosynthesis of sterols. The investigated flavonoid conjugates brutieridin and melitidin were recently quantified in the bergamot fruit extracts and identified to be structural analogues of statins, lipids concentration lowering drugs that inhibit HMGR. Computations allowed us to perform a detailed analysis of the geometrical and electronic features affecting the binding of these compounds, as well as that of the excellent simvastatin drug, to the active site of the enzyme and to give better insight into the inhibition process.", 
    "120": "At present, literally no one disputes hyperlipoproteinaemia and dyslipidemia (HLP and DLP) treatment as a rational therapeutic approach in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). This approach is in line with the current principles of evidence-based medicine (EBM) and is sufficiently evidenced particularly by the results of large intervention studies. Nevertheless! When the results of the recent studies are critically appraised, these by no means are (mostly, there, obviously, are exceptions) as conclusive as the studies conducted in 1980s and 1990s. Consequently, positive results are being sought in subanalyses, subgroup evaluations and multiple-study metaanalyses. This paper is not intended as a critique of new drugs. These certainly are developed to be safe, effective and well-tolerated. However, the newer studies suffer from a range of issues: the populations studied are already very well managed, it is not possible to compare against placebo and sometimes, let us be honest, the trial design itself is problematic (often it is an uncritical effort to treat as wide as possible range of patients as well as new groups of patients who might not be suitable for the given treatment). Certainly, we should not start disputing the well-evidenced hypotheses and seek alternatives to the long-established arguments and approaches as a consequence to some less convincing studies. We must not overlook the most robust results of statin studies as well as 'positive' studies with other hypolipidemics. There is no doubt that the effect ofstatins on LDL-cholesterol represents a significant move towards cardiovascular disease prevention. Despite this, we currently recognise with increased intensity that this very effective and well-evidenced treatment has its limits and that a high proportion of patients dies or are faced with cardiovascular diseases even though they are treated with a correct dose ofa statin and a target LDL-C level is achieved. This remaining risk (represents more than 50% ofevents) has been termed 'RESIDUAL RISK'. The issue of residual risk is crucial in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2T) or in all patients with HDL-C-low DLP. As was repeatedly emphasised, a statin will be a cornerstone of pharmacological treatment of a DLP. However, a question arises what to combine it with. The most convincing data exist for niacin (combination of niacin with laropiprant minimising the incidence of unwanted flushes). We surely should not marginalize other hypolipidemics used mainly in combinations: resin and ezetimibe to treat LDL-C, niacin, fibrates and possibly omega-3-fatty acids to manage the residual risk (HDL and TG). Last but not least we should not forget non-pharmacological treatment as the pivotal treatment approach in all patients.", 
    "121": "The treatment of lipid abnormalities generally has focused on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction based on extensive clinical trials and the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III guidelines. Unfortunately, it has become increasingly clear that a significant percentage of patients continue to have cardiovascular events despite being on LDL-C-lowering medications and having LDL-C levels below 100\u00a0mg/dL. Numerous epidemiologic studies have associated low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Furthermore, recent data show that up to 55% of patients hospitalized for CVD have low HDL-C levels (<40\u00a0mg/dL) on admission, suggesting a possible target for further reducing CVD. Low HDL-C also is part of the atherogenic phenotype associated with obesity, glucose intolerance, and hypertension, termed the metabolic syndrome, and often is seen in patients with insulin resistance states. In general, the first line of therapy for increasing HDL-C in patients with levels below 40\u00a0mg/dL is lifestyle modification with smoking cessation, exercise, weight loss, and diet modifications. The pharmacologic treatment of isolated low HDL-C in patients without coronary disease is controversial but should be considered in those with a strong family history of CVD. In patients with coronary artery disease and isolated low HDL-C, statins remain the first-line therapy and should be instituted after lifestyle modifications, with the goal of increasing HDL-C above 40\u00a0mg/dL. If concomitant hypertriglyceridemia is present, a fibrate or niacin should be considered. Although statins do offer some HDL-C-raising properties, they tend to have modest effects. If treatment goals have not been achieved with either lifestyle changes or statin therapy, then the next agent of choice is niacin. Among the various HDL-C-raising therapies, niacin continues to be the most potent therapeutic option available. There are several novel HDL-C therapies in the research pipeline; however, only one class of medications is relatively close to clinical use, the cholesteryl ester transferase protein (CETP) inhibitors. Although one of the CETP inhibitors, torcetrapib, has received much negative attention from a large randomized trial showing increased mortality associated with its use, the overall class of therapeutic agents may still hold some benefit. Currently, two new CETP inhibitors without the off-target effects of torcetrapib are undergoing clinical research. Overall, the use of HDL-C-modifying agents likely will increase over the next decade.",

It is estimated that up to 15% of those affected will go on to have progressive liver disease. Currently, there is no proven therapy for NAFLD. In this study, we aim to determine whether statin therapy may be an effective treatment for NAFLD and identify independent predictors of NAFLD.",

Liver to spleen (LS) ratios were calculated on 455 subjects with available computed tomography scans performed at baseline and follow-up to determine NAFLD prevalence. Baseline and final LS ratios were compared within treatment groups, and results were compared between the treatment and placebo groups using univariate and multivariate analyses. Mean duration of follow-up was 3.6 years.",

We identified baseline triglyceride levels (odds ratio (OR)=1.003, P<0.001) and body mass index (OR=0.10, P<0.001) as independent correlates of NAFLD. Treatment with atorvastatin combined with vitamins E and C significantly reduced the odds of NAFLD at the end of follow-up, 70 vs. 34% (OR=0.29, P<0.001).",

    "127": "1604 and 1345 eligible participants from the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) were followed after age 50 for a median time of around 25 years, to examine the incidence of dementia (n=259) and MCI (n=138), respectively. Statin use (ever-use and time-dependent use), total cholesterol levels (TC; first visit and time-dependent), TC change trajectory from first visit and high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C):TC ratio (first visit and time-dependent) were the main exposures of interest. Cox proportional hazards models were used.", 
    "128": "Participants with incident dementia had a higher first-visit TC compared with participants who remained free of dementia and MCI, while first-visit TC was higher among statin ever-users compared with never-users (age-unadjusted associations). Statin users had a two- to threefold lower risk of developing dementia (HR=0.41; 95% CI 0.18 to 0.92), but not MCI, when considering time-dependent 'statin use' with propensity score model adjustment. This association remained significant independently of serum cholesterol exposures. An elevated first-visit TC was associated with reduced MCI risk (upper quartile (Q(4)) vs Q(1): HR=0.51; 95% CI 0.29 to 0.90). Compared with the lowest quartile (Q(1): 0.00-0.19), HDL-C:TC (time-dependent) in (Q(2): 0.19-0.24) was associated with reduced MCI risk (HR=0.58; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.98).

(i) rats fed a standard diet (control group); (ii) rats fed a HFD (33.5% fat) for 7 weeks; and (iii) rats fed a HFD and treated with rosuvastatin (15 mg\u00b7kg(-1) \u00b7day(-1) ) for 7 weeks. Segments of isolated mesenteric arteries were exposed to electric field stimulation (EFS) with or without tetrodotoxin, phentolamine, 7-nitroindazole (7NI) or N(\u03c9) nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). Noradrenaline, ATP and NO release, and nNOS expression were also measured.", 
    "132": "EFS induced a greater frequency-dependent contraction in obese than in control rats. In HFD rats, phentolamine reduced contractions elicited by EFS, but noradrenaline release was greater and ATP release decreased. L-NAME and 7NI increased contractions to EFS in segments from control rats, but not in those from HFD rats. NO release and nNOS expression were lower in arterial segments from HFD rats than in control rats. All these changes in HFD rats were reversed by treatment with rosuvastatin.",

    "139": "The computerized medical databases of a large health organization in Israel were used to identify diagnosed RA cases among adults who began statin therapy between 1998 and 2007. Persistence with statins was assessed by calculating the mean proportion of follow-up days covered (PDC) with statins for every study participant. To assess the possible effects of healthy user bias, we also examined the risk of osteoarthritis (OA), a common degenerative joint disease that is unlikely to be affected by use of statins. A total of 211,627 and 193,770 individuals were eligible for the RA and OA cohort analyses, respectively. During the study follow-up period, there were 2,578 incident RA cases (3.07 per 1,000 person-years) and 17,878 incident OA cases (24.34 per 1,000 person-years). The crude incidence density rate of RA among nonpersistent patients (PDC level of <20%) was 51% higher (3.89 per 1,000 person-years) compared to highly persistent patients who were covered with statins for at least 80% of the follow-up period. After adjustment for potential confounders, highly persistent patients had a hazard ratio of 0.58 (95% confidence interval 0.52-0.65) for RA compared with nonpersistent patients. Larger differences were observed in younger patients and in patients initiating treatment with high efficacy statins. In the OA cohort analysis, high persistence with statins was associated only with a modest decrement in risk ratio (hazard ratio\u200a=\u200a0.85; 0.81-0.88) compared to nonadherent patients.",

Lovastatin attenuated ligand-induced receptor activation and downstream signaling through the PI3K/AKT pathway. Combining lovastatin with gefitinib, a potent EGFR inhibitor, induced synergistic cytotoxicity in a variety of tumor derived cell lines. The vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and EGFR share similar activation, internalization and downstream signaling characteristics.", 
    "142": "The VEGFRs, particularly VEGFR-2 (KDR, Flt-1), play important roles in regulating tumor angiogenesis by promoting endothelial cell proliferation, survival and migration. Certain tumors, such as malignant mesothelioma (MM), also express both the VEGF ligand and VEGFRs that act in an autocrine loop to directly stimulate tumor cell growth and survival. In this study, we have shown that lovastatin inhibits ligand-induced VEGFR-2 activation through inhibition of receptor internalization and also inhibits VEGF activation of AKT in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and H28 MM cells employing immunofluorescence and Western blotting. Combinations of lovastatin and a VEGFR-2 inhibitor showed more robust AKT inhibition than either agent alone in the H28 MM cell line. Furthermore, combining 5 \u00b5M lovastatin treatment, a therapeutically relevant dose, with two different VEGFR-2 inhibitors in HUVEC and the H28 and H2052 mesothelioma derived cell lines demonstrated synergistic cytotoxicity as demonstrated by MTT cell viability and flow cytometric analyses.",

We assessed the relationship between cardiovascular (CV) risk and atorvastatin adherence in primary- and secondary-prevention patients, adjusting for healthy-adherer bias by incorporating preventive service use into the model. Medical and pharmacy claims from employee-based plans from 2002 to 2008 were analyzed for patients who initiated atorvastatin in 2003-2004. Adherent patients were defined as having \u226560% of days covered in the year after atorvastatin initiation and were required to have pill coverage in months 10-12. CV events were identified as hospitalizations with a primary CV diagnosis and assessed from month 13 after atorvastatin initiation until the end of follow-up (\u226436 months). Cox proportional hazards models were used to examine the association between atorvastatin adherence and CV event risk, adjusting for covariates including preventive service use. The study included 94,287 atorvastatin users (79,010 primary- and 15,277 secondary-prevention patients). In both populations, nearly one-half of the patients discontinued atorvastatin after 1 year. During follow-up, ~2% of primary-prevention and ~9% of secondary-prevention patients experienced CV events. After adjusting for covariates, adherent patients in the primary-prevention population had a significantly lower risk of CV events compared with nonadherent patients (hazard ratio, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.74-0.91). In the secondary-prevention population, adherence to atorvastatin was also associated with lower CV risk (hazard ratio, 0.74; 95% confidence interval, 0.66-0.82). Atorvastatin discontinuation rates were high 1 year after treatment initiation. Patients who adhered to atorvastatin treatment were at lower CV risk.

Statins act on the rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis (the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate) and are effective in treating dyslipidemia. However, statins decrease other downstream products of the mevalonate pathway, and it is via these pathways that statins may affect inflammation, nitric oxide synthesis, the coagulation cascade, and other processes. Through these pleiotropic effects, statins may have an effect on neurologic diseases, including ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, and multiple sclerosis. This article reviews the basic biochemistry of statins as it relates to these pleiotropic effects, the potential role of statins in several neurologic disorders, and the results of clinical trials performed for several of these conditions.",

Beneficial effects of rhEpo and statin monotherapies have been well studied. However, there are no reports showing combined use of rhEpo and statins after TBI. This investigation examined if combined efficacy of cell proliferative ability of rhEpo along with the neuroregenerative ability of simvastatin will render maximum recovery in a controlled cortical impact (CCI) mouse model of TBI. Results showed that compared to baseline TBI, rhEpo was more effective than simvastatin in promoting cell proliferation while simvastatin was more effective than rhEpo in restoring axonal damage following TBI. Combined treatment with simvastatin and rhEpo maximally restored axonal integrity while simultaneously inducing greater proliferation of newly formed cells resulting in better functional recovery after TBI than either alone.

Lovastatin inhibits HMG-CoA reductase, resulting in a decrease in the levels of cholesterol and prenylated proteins. An inhibitor of the former pathway showed pH-independent cytotoxic activity, whereas an inhibitor of the latter pathway had stronger activity at acidic pH. The inhibitory efficacy of cantharidin also increased at acidic pH.

From the social perspective, the true cost of a medical intervention is the marginal cost of delivering another unit of a treatment, plus the social cost (deadweight loss) of raising the revenue to fund the treatment. We focus on pharmaceutical prices, which have high markups over marginal cost due to the monopoly power granted to pharmaceutical companies when drugs are under patent. We find that the social cost of a branded drug is approximately one-half the market price when the treatment is paid for by a public insurance plan and one-third the market price for mandated coverage by private insurance. We illustrate the importance of correctly accounting for social costs using two examples: coverage for statin drugs and approval for a drug to treat kidney cancer (sorafenib).

At the background of pronounced lipid lowering effect of atorvastatin we noted obvious improvement of microrheological properties of erythrocytes appearing as significant decrease of rigidity index of erythrocytes and of their aggregation.

The extract was diluted with water and injected into the chromatographic system. This system consisted of a polar embedded octadecyl silica column using isocratic elution with formic acid in a water-acetonitrile mixture. The eluate was transferred to an electrospray interface using negative ionization and the analytes were detected and quantified with the selected reaction monitoring mode of a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The assay was successfully validated in a 3.4-7100ng/ml concentration range for pravastatin, 1.3-2200ng/ml for 3'\u03b1-isopravastatin and 0.5-215ng/ml for 6'-epipravastatin using only plasma for calibration. For plasma samples, subjected to full validation, within and between day precisions were 1-7% (9-18% at the LLQ level) and accuracies were between 91% and 103%. For tissue homogenates, subjected to partial validation, within and between day precisions were 2-12% (6-19% at the LLQ level) and accuracies were between 87% and 113% (81 and 113% at the LLQ level). Drug and metabolites were shown to be chemically stable under most relevant analytical conditions. Finally, the assay was successfully applied for a pilot study in mice.

These studies demonstrate that agents that inhibit Rab geranylgeranylation disrupt light chain trafficking, lead to accumulation of light chain in the endoplasmic reticulum, activate the unfolded protein response pathway and induce apoptosis. These studies provide a novel mechanism of action for IBP inhibitors and suggest that further exploration of Rab-targeted agents in myeloma is warranted.",

The recent Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) study found that statin therapy reduced cardiovascular events in those with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels below current treatment thresholds (\u2264130 mg/dL, 3.4 = mmol/L), but with elevated hs-CRP levels (\u22652.0 mg/L). This study examines the cost-effectiveness of statin treatment for individuals with elevated hs-CRP but normal LDL cholesterol.", 
    "213": "A Markov decision-analytic model was conducted from the U.S. societal perspective. Data from JUPITER were used to estimate rates of myocardial infarction, angina and stroke. Statin costs were based on generic simvastatin 80 mg, equipotent to the rosuvastatin 20 mg dose used in JUPITER. Primary prevention was the focus and secondary prevention was not modeled explicitly. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were calculated using nationally representative preference-based utility weights. One-way sensitivity analyses and multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analysis were used to explore uncertainty in model parameters as well as estimate the likelihood of cost-effectiveness when all event rates, costs and utilities were drawn randomly from distributions reflecting uncertainty.", 
    "214": "Statin therapy cost $10,889/QALY for vascular event prevention in this population. Results were sensitive to the cost of statin treatment. Based on 10,000 simulations, statin therapy was cost-effective in 99.5% of simulations, using a willingness-to-pay threshold of $20,000/QALY, and 100% of simulations using a threshold of $50,000/QALY.", 
    "215": "Treatment with statins in patients with elevated hs-CRP but normal cholesterol appears to be cost-effective. Limitations of this study include the assumption that an equipotent dose of simvastatin resulted in the same risk reduction as rosuvastatin. Further, post-event states simulated the average experience of a patient. Continued statin use, subsequent events and/or heart failure were not explicitly modeled.", 
    "216": "The 1980s witnessed the inception of both stents and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). While they evolved separately, it was soon realized that they each offered a unique and powerful mechanism for targeting the major offender in cardiovascular disease, namely atherosclerosis. Coincidentally, the first statin was approved by the US FDA in 1987, the same year that the coronary stent was conceived. Since that time, stents and statins have revolutionized the field of cardiovascular medicine and their paths have been intertwined. Several pivotal randomized clinical trials have established statins as an effective therapy for improving clinical outcomes after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) among patients presenting with stable coronary artery disease and acute coronary syndromes. In addition, chronic statin therapy and acute loading of statins prior to PCI has consistently been shown to limit periprocedural myocardial necrosis. The mechanism for improved clinical outcomes with statins has clearly been associated with statin-induced reductions in LDL. In addition, statins may also exert 'pleiotropic' effects, independent of LDL lowering, that might counteract the inflammatory and prothrombotic mileu created with PCI. This article provides a brief historical perspective of the evolution of the use of statins and stents in patients with coronary artery disease, an evaluation of the available clinical data supporting the use of statins in patients undergoing PCI across a wide spectrum of clinical scenarios, and a discussion of the potential mechanisms of the benefit of statins in these patients.", 
    "217": "Statins have an established role in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and the prophylactic treatment of patients with atherosclerotic disease, and have been found to prevent secondary cardiovascular events and thereby reduce morbidity and mortality. Nevertheless, the pathophysiologic effect of statins on inflammatory responses and local atherosclerotic plaque morphology in humans remains a matter of debate. In particular the question is unanswered whether statin-induced alterations in plaque composition can be ascribed to LDL lowering or an anti-inflammatory pleiotropic effect. We will discuss the results of a recent study by Puato et al. concerning the effect of two different atorvastatin dosages and a nonstatin lipid-lowering drug on atherosclerotic plaque morphology.", 
    "218": "Among hypertensive patients, cardiovascular disease morbidity is common, even in those who are adequately treated. New pharmacological strategies to mitigate the burden of arterial hypertension are needed. This 12-month, randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study investigated the effect of statin (fluvastatin) treatment on ambulatory blood pressure (ABP), exercise blood pressure (EBP), myocardial structure, endothelial function and insulin resistance in 50 hypertensive patients. At baseline, the groups were comparable in terms of demographic characteristics, ABP, EBP, endothelial function and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). At the end of the study, there was no difference between groups in terms of resting systolic blood pressure. However, maximum systolic EBP was lower in the treatment group than in the placebo group (175 \u00b1 18 vs 192 \u00b1 23\u2009mm\u2009Hg, P<0.05), as was left ventricular mass index (LVMI; 82 \u00b1 15 vs 100 \u00b1 23, P<0.05), and HOMA-IR index was lower after fluvastatin treatment (2.77 \u00b1 1.46 vs 3.33 \u00b1 1.73, P<0.05). Changes in lipid profile were not correlated with blood pressure, endothelial function, LVMI or HOMA-IR data. In hypertensive patients, fluvastatin can improve maximum systolic EBP, myocardial remodelling and insulin resistance, independently of lipid profile variations and endothelial function.", 
    "219": "Statins are commonly prescribed lipid-lowering medications that significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. However, they can have myotoxic effects ranging in severity from myalgias to rhabdomyolysis. This review focuses on recent progress in defining the clinical features and mechanism(s) of statin-induced myopathy.", 
    "220": "Although severe myotoxicity is a very rare event, most recent studies suggest that myalgias and relatively low-level muscle damage may occur in a substantial number of patients treated with statins. Those taking medications that increase serum statin concentrations are at greater risk for severe muscle side-effects, as are those with a polymorphism in the gene encoding a hepatic statin transporter. Although the mechanism of muscle damage remains to be fully elucidated, a number of in-vitro studies suggest that inhibition of protein prenylation may underlie the myotoxic effects of statins, possibly through the induction of pro-apoptotic pathways. In addition, recent reports have indicated that statins may trigger an immune-mediated necrotizing myopathy with many features of polymyositis.", 
    "221": "Severe myopathy is a rare and generally self-limited side-effect of statin medications. However, myalgias are much more common and limit their use in many patients. Recent evidence also suggests that statins are associated with the development of a unique form of immune-mediated myopathy. Awareness of this newly described entity is important, as these patients may require immunosuppressive therapy.", 
    "222": "To provide an update on high-density lipoprotein (HDL) biology and emerging new HDL-based therapies for athero-thrombosis.", 
    "223": "Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease remains a major public health threat despite a significant decline over the past three decades. Although current medical therapies, specifically low-density lipoprotein lowering with statins, reduce cardiovascular events by about 25-35%, a substantial residual risk remains, leading to a search for additional therapeutic interventions. In this regard, HDL has emerged as one important target because of epidemiologic evidence linking HDL levels inversely to cardiovascular events, known vascular protective actions of HDL and experimental and clinical research supporting athero-protective actions of HDL. However, complexities of HDL composition, particle size, and metabolism have suggested that HDL functionality, and how HDL is increased, may be important determinants of its protective effects.", 
    "224": "Thus the possibility that HDL modification could address the residual risk has brought renewed focus on an old HDL-raising drug, niacin, and a number of newer strategies to exploit the vascular benefits of HDL."
