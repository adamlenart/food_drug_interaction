Statins may exert beneficial effects on the progression of AAA. However, the underlying mechanism is still not known. The purpose of the present study is to investigate whether statin could inhibit AAA formation by inhibiting the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress signal pathway.", 
    "1": "A clinically relevant AAA model was induced in Apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE-/-) mice, which were infused with angiotensin II (Ang II) for 28 days. These mice were randomly divided into following 4 groups: saline infusion alone; Ang II infusion alone; Ang II infusion plus Atorvastatin (20mg/kg/d); and Ang II infusion plus Atorvastatin (30mg/kg/d). Besides, another AAA model was induced in C57 mice with extraluminal CaCl2, which were divided into 3 groups: sham group, CaCl2-induced AAA group, and CaCl2-induced AAA plus atorvastatin (20mg/kg/d) group. Then, aortic tissue was excised for further examinations, respectively. In vitro studies, Ang II with or without simvastatin treatment were applied to the vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCS) and Raw 264.7 cells. The ER stress signal pathway, apoptosis and inflammatory response were evaluated by in vivo and in vitro assays.", 
    "2": "We found that higher dose of atorvastatin can effectively suppress the development and progression of AAA induced by Ang II or CaCl2. Mechanistically, the activation of ER stress and inflammatory response were found involved in Ang II-induced AAA formation. The atorvastatin infusion significantly reduced ER stress signaling proteins, the number of apoptotic cells, and the activation of Caspase12 and Bax in the Ang II-induced ApoE-/- mice, compared with mice treated by Ang II alone. Furthermore, proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, IL-1\u03b2 were all remarkably inhibited after atorvastatin treatment. In vitro, the inhibitory effect of simvastatin on the ER stress signal pathway could be observed in both vascular smooth muscle cells and macrophages, and these inhibitory effects of statin were in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, apoptosis was induced with Ang II treatment. The maximal inhibitory effect of simvastatin on apoptosis was observed at 10 \u03bcmol/l.",

A 1-year analysis was performed on patients enrolled from the YUKAWA studies into OSLER. At parent-study baseline (YUKAWA-1 or YUKAWA-2 patients continuing into OSLER), mean (SD) age was 61 (10) years; 39% were female; mean (SD) baseline LDL-C (on statin) was 119.7 (33.0) mg/dL. Overall rates of adverse events were comparable between evolocumab+SOC and SOC alone. In YUKAWA patients receiving evolocumab+SOC, mean (SE) reductions in LDL-C from parent-study baseline to OLE 1 year were 69.1% (1.2%; OSLER-1) and 65.1% (2.2%; OSLER-2).",

As a result, HIV is now often considered a chronic condition. However, as a result of the increase in longevity or the HIV treatment modalities themselves, individuals with HIV are at high risk for the development of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Therefore, these patients should be optimized with pharmacologic therapy to lower their cardiovascular risk through the addition of statin therapy to their regimen. Unfortunately, many medications utilized to treat HIV interact with this class of agents, making prescribing of statin therapy in these patients challenging. While several classes of ARTs do not pose an increased risk of drug-drug interactions with statins, HIV treatment often requires several combinations of medications, enhancing the complexity and drug-drug interaction risk. Clinicians should be aware of interactions with statins and ART and carefully review the degree and clinical significance of each particular medication. With this understanding, the appropriate statin as well as statin dose can be selected in order to optimize the treatment of this patient population, while minimizing the potential risk of adverse effects.",

Inhibition of PCSK9 using monoclonal antibodies can efficiently lower plasma LDL-C, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and lipoprotein (a). PCSK9 inhibition is also an effective adjunct to statin therapy; however, the cost-effectiveness of currently available PCSK9 inhibitors is under question. Nutraceuticals offer a safe and cost-effective option for PCSK9 inhibition. Several nutraceuticals have been reported to modulate PCSK9 levels and exert LDL-lowering activity. Mechanistically, those nutraceuticals that inhibit PCSK9 through a SREBP (sterol-responsive element binding protein)-independent pathway can be more effective in lowering plasma LDL-C levels compared with those inhibiting PCSK9 through the SREBP pathway.

We hypothesize that these agents synergistically impact cell growth based on their complementary mechanisms of action with HMG CoA reductase. d-\u03b4-tocotrienol (0-40\u00a0\u00b5mol/L; half maximal inhibitory concentration [IC50] = 15\u00a0\u00b5mol/L) and geranylgeraniol (0-100\u00a0\u00b5mol/L; IC50 = 60\u00a0\u00b5mol/L) each induced concentration-dependent suppression of the growth of human DU145 prostate carcinoma cells. Blends of the two agents synergistically suppressed the growth of DU145 cells, with combination index values ranging 0.67-0.75. While 7.5\u00a0\u00b5mol/L d-\u03b4-tocotrienol and 30\u00a0\u00b5mol/L geranylgeraniol individually had no impact on cell cycle distribution in DU145 cells, a blend of the agents induced cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase.

Our finding supports the cancer chemopreventive action of plant-based diets and their isoprenoid constituents. Properly formulated isoprenoids and derivatives may provide novel approaches in prostate cancer prevention and therapy.", 
    "27": "Hypercholesterolemia remains one of the leading risk factors for the development of cardiovascular disease. Many large double-blind studies have demonstrated that lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol using a statin can reduce the risk of having a cardiovascular event by approximately 30%. However, despite the success of statins, some patient populations are unable to lower their LDL cholesterol to meet the targeted lipid levels, due to compliance or potency issues. This is especially true for patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia who may require additional upregulation of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) to reduce LDL cholesterol levels below those achievable with maximal dosing of statins. Here we identify a series of small molecules from a genomic DNA reporter screen that upregulate the LDLR in mouse and human liver cell lines at nanomolar potencies (EC50 = 39 nM). Structure-activity relationship studies carried out on the lead compound, OX03771 [(E)-N,N-dimethyl-3-(4-styrylphenoxy)propan-1-amine], led to the identification of compound OX03050 [(E)-3-(4-styrylphenoxy)propan-1-ol], which had similar potency (EC50 = 26 nM) but a much-improved pharmacokinetic profile and showed in vivo efficacy. Compounds OX03050 and OX03771 were found to inhibit squalene synthase, the first committed step in cholesterol biosynthesis. These squalene synthase inhibitors were shown to act cooperatively with statins to increase LDLR expression in vitro. Overall, we demonstrated here a novel series of small molecules with the potential to be further developed to treat patients either alone or in combination with statins.",

    "54": "Bone fracture healing is achieved through the proliferation and differentiation of stem cells, while bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) contribute to endochondral ossification. During fracture healing, mesenchymal progenitor cells first form a cartilaginous blastema that becomes vascularized to recruit precursor cells of osteoblasts through the bone morphogenetic protein 2 (Bmp2)/Smad-dependent Runx2 pathway. Statins deplete geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP), which participates in the regulation of BMSCs differentiation, through the inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase, leading to impaired protein geranylgeranylation, which strongly impacts the bone synthesis induced by Bmp2. Accordingly, we would like to investigate the role of geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase 1 (Ggps1) in bone fracture via endochondral ossification in mice. We used a Cre-loxP system, namely the tamoxifen-inducible Collagen 2-CreER(T2) Ggps1\u00a0(fl/fl), to eliminate specifically the Ggps1 activity in chondrocytes of 8-10-week-old mice. We found that the endochondral bone formation, calcification and vasculogenesis of the bony callus were accelerated in fractures in Ggps1(-/-)mice. Together, the results of this study confirm that the specific deletion of Ggps1, using the Collagen 2-CreER(T2) mice, will accelerate the fracture healing process by activating the Bmp2/Smad-dependent Runx2 pathway. In addition, we managed to improve the fracture healing process by inhibiting the Ggps1 activity and its related products with statin drugs.",

Totally, 492 patients with acute ischemic stroke and Glasgow Coma Scale \u2264 8 were enrolled in this study. Subjects were assigned to prior atorvastatin treatment group (n = 268, PG) and no prior treatment group (n = 224, NG). All the patients were given 20\u2009mg atorvastatin every night during their hospital stay. HAP frequency and 28-day mortality were measured. Levels of inflammatory biomarkers [white blood cell (WBC), procalcitonin (PCT), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), and interleukin-6 (IL-6)] were tested. Results. There was no significant difference in the incidence of HAP between PG and NG (25.74% versus. 24.55%, p > 0.05) and 28-day mortality (50.72% versus 58.18%, p > 0.05). However, prior statin treatment did modify the mortality of ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) (36.54% versus 58.14%, p = 0.041) and proved to be a protective factor (HR, 0.564; 95% CI, 0.310~0.825, p = 0.038). Concentrations of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in PG VAP cases were lower than those in NG VAP cases (p < 0.01). Conclusions. Prior atorvastatin treatment in patients with ischemic stroke was associated with a lower concentration of IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 and improved the outcome of VAP.

    "56": "Human hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs), which arise on a background of chronic liver damage and inflammation, express c-Fos, a component of the AP-1 transcription factor. Using mouse models, we show that hepatocyte-specific deletion of c-Fos protects against diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced HCCs, whereas liver-specific c-Fos expression leads to reversible premalignant hepatocyte transformation and enhanced DEN-carcinogenesis. c-Fos-expressing livers display necrotic foci, immune cell infiltration, and altered hepatocyte morphology. Furthermore, increased proliferation, dedifferentiation, activation of the DNA damage response, and gene signatures of aggressive HCCs are observed. Mechanistically, c-Fos decreases expression and activity of the nuclear receptor LXR\u03b1, leading to increased hepatic cholesterol and accumulation of toxic oxysterols and bile acids. The phenotypic consequences of c-Fos expression are partially ameliorated by the anti-inflammatory drug sulindac and largely prevented by statin treatment. An inverse correlation between c-FOS and the LXR\u03b1 pathway was also observed in human HCC cell lines and datasets. These findings provide a novel link between chronic inflammation and metabolic pathways important in liver cancer.",

This study monitored volatile organic compounds emitted from living flowers of Jasminum sambac (L.) Ait. 'Bifoliatum' at five developmental stages and also from excised flowers. Among the compounds identified, \u03b1-farnesene, linalool, and benzyl acetate were most abundant. Since \u03b1-farnesene is synthesized through the Mevalonate pathway, four genes encoding 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A synthase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR), farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, and terpene synthase were isolated. Their expression patterns in living flowers at the five stages and in excised flowers coincided with the emission patterns of \u03b1-farnesene. Application of lovastatin, a HMGR inhibitor, significantly reduced the expression of the genes and greatly decreased the emission of \u03b1-farnesene. The sweet scent was diminished from lovastatin-treated flowers as well. These results indicate that \u03b1-farnesene is an important compound emitted from jasmine flowers, and its emission patterns suggest that flowers at the opening stage or flower buds 8 h after excision should be used for the infusion of tea leaves.",

Methods Patients (young adults with a family history of hypercholesterolaemia or premature cardiovascular disease) with LDL cholesterol concentration \u22654.9\u2009mmol/l, after excluding Familial Combined Hyperlipidaemia, were evaluated for causative mutations, Dutch Lipid Clinic Network score calculation and non-invasive ultrasound examination of carotid arteries. Results Of the 263 patients, 210 were heterozygotes for LDL receptor ( LDLR) mutations, four had APOB gene mutations, one PCSK9 gene mutation, while 48 had no evidence of mutations. Among 194 unrelated index cases 149 had mutations (77%). Among patients with LDLR mutations ( n\u2009=\u2009145), there were five compound heterozygotes, 75 patients with null mutations and 65 with missense mutations. As many as 178 patients underwent a follow-up and treatment (statin\u2009\u00b1\u2009ezetimibe), achieving a mean reduction of 49% in LDL cholesterol, with 21% of patients reaching the LDL goal of 2.6\u2009mmol/l. In a multivariate analysis, carotid plaques, at ultrasound examination, were associated with the presence of genetic mutation ( p\u2009=\u20090.001), LDL cholesterol ( p\u2009<\u20090.001), Dutch Lipid Clinic Network score ( p\u2009<\u20090.001), independently of age, gender, smoking habits and systolic blood pressure.

Conclusions We identified patients with causative mutations in 82% of the cases under study. In addition to LDL cholesterol and Dutch Lipid Clinic Network score, carotid plaques in ultrasound evaluation provide direct evidence of premature vascular disease and are associated with high risk for cardiovascular events.",

In CVD, hypertension and dyslipidemia commonly coexist and are managed through coadministration of amlodipine and atorvastatin, respectively. The case for fixed-dose combination (FDC) oral dosage forms and orally disintegrating tablet (ODT) technology to enhance outcomes and compliance is strong. This work follows the development and characterization of single and FDC ODTs containing amlodipine and atorvastatin, followed by bioequivalence comparison between these single and FDC formulations, using in vitro dissolution and Caco-2 apparent permeability (Papp) and in silico physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling approaches. ODTs containing amlodipine (5 mg) and atorvastatin (10 mg) either alone or in combination rapidly disintegrated (<30 s) while displaying a radial crushing strength in excess of 100 N and friability \u22641%. In vitro dissolution test was performed in fasted and fed-state simulated intestinal fluid (FeSSIF) and analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography. Dissolution profiles for single and FDC ODTs were compared using US FDA recommended difference (f1) and similarity (f2) factor testing for bioequivalence. In all cases, there was no difference in active pharmaceutical ingredient dissolution between single or FDC ODTs, with the exception of amlodipine in FeSSIF. Pharmacokinetic clinical trial simulations were conducted using Simcyp (Version 14), incorporating Papp and dissolution data. Simulated clinical trials in healthy volunteers showed no difference in bioavailability based on pharmacokinetic parameters between single and combination doses with either active pharmaceutical ingredient. An increase in Cmax and AUC for atorvastatin in fed subjects was attributed to extended transit along the gut lumen and reduced atorvastatin metabolism due to lower CYP3A4 expression at more distal small intestine absorption sites. The results demonstrated bioequivalence of an FDC ODT for amlodipine and atorvastatin, while highlighting several limitations of f1 and f2 bioequivalence testing and strengths of mechanistic pharmacokinetic modeling for oral drug absorption.",

The use of stem cell transplantation has become one of the most popular treatments. With gradually understanding of the endogenous mechanism of stem cells migration and movement in vivo, endogenous IVD stem cells can be activated to repair and reconstruct the degenerated IVD. Nucleus pulposus mensenchymal stem cells exhibit more potent biological activity in the hypoxic environment of the IVD. Hypoxia inducible factor can regulate the energy metabolism of IVD cells by activating Glucose transporter 1 pathway. The simvastatin can enhance the theraprutic effect of many kinds of stem cells by increasing number and function of the stem cell. Herein we postulate that simvastatin can regulate the differentiation of nucleus pulposus mensenchymal stem cells into nucleus pulposus cell by promoting expression of hypoxia inducible factor to repair and reconstruct degenerated IVD.",

Statins have been shown to elevate circulating PCSK9 levels by stimulating PCSK9 gene transcription, which reduces the clinical efficacy of statin in LDL\u2011cholesterol reduction. The transcription of PCSK9 is partially controlled by the hepatocyte nuclear factor\u00a01\u00a0(HNF1) binding site embedded in the proximal region of its promoter. In this study, we utilized adenoviral shRNA delivery vectors to generate liver-specific knockdown of HNF1\u03b1 (Ad\u2011shHNF1\u03b1) or HNF1\u03b2\u00a0(Ad\u2011shHNF1\u03b2) in hamsters to examine the impact of reduced hepatic expression of HNF1 transcription factors on statin\u2011induced elevation of PCSK9 expression and serum cholesterol levels. We showed that the administration of rosuvastatin\u00a0(RSV) to normolipidemic hamsters significantly augmented hepatic PCSK9 expression and serum PCSK9 levels. In addition, RSV treatment increased hepatic HNF1\u03b1 protein levels without a clear effect on HNF1\u03b1 mRNA expression. Injection of Ad-shHNF1\u03b1 or Ad\u2011shHNF1\u03b2 into hamsters both blunted RSV\u2011induced elevation of PCSK9 serum concentration and hepatic mRNA and protein levels, which led to significant increases in liver LDLR protein abundance. Furthermore, hepatic depletion of HNF1 factors lowered circulating total cholesterol and non\u2011high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in RSV\u2011treated hamsters. Our study demonstrates that both HNF1\u03b1 and HNF1\u03b2 are positive regulators of hepatic PCSK9 transcription in hamster species and that transient, liver-specific knockdown of either HNF1\u03b1 or HNF1\u03b2 could antagonize the RSV\u2011induced elevation of serum PCSK9 and reduce circulating cholesterol levels.",

    "149": "The development of coronary revascularization has dramatically improved early cardiovascular outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). However, patients who have experienced myocardial infarction (MI) are at high risk of recurrence of cardiovascular events compared with those who are healthy or have stable coronary artery disease. Acute coronary events induce further inflammatory responses and plaque vulnerability in either a coronary culprit or whole vessels. The majority of data have supported the importance of coronary risk management to prevent secondary events. Dyslipidemia is common and one of the therapeutic targets in patients with ACS. Statins can reduce coronary plaque burden and lower the risk of cardiovascular death, recurrent MI, stroke, and coronary revascularization in patients with ACS. Growing evidence from clinical trials and meta-analyses supports early, intensive, and continuous therapy with statins in patients with ACS. Statins are accepted worldwide as the first-line lipid-lowering therapy as guidelines recommend. However, some patients do not reach the target level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol by statins alone or are contra-indicated for statins. Recently, several clinical trials showed the further benefit of ezetimibe combined with statins on cardiovascular outcomes and coronary plaque regression in patients with ACS. In addition, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, novel and powerful lipid-lowering agents, have been developed and used in clinical settings. In this review, we summarize the present statin therapy, and refer to ezetimibe and PCSK9 as novel or additional non-statin strategies in the management of ACS.",

    "151": "Categorized as a Biopharmaceutics Classification System (BCS) Class II drugs, statin exhibit low aqueous solubility and bioavailability thus presenting an obstacle and great challenge to formulation researchers. This paper describes a de novo approach to enhance the aqueous solubility of one of the most commonly prescribed statins i.e. simvastatin (SMV) by forming a complex (SMV-ARG) with cosolute arginine (ARG). The complex has been characterized for its apparent solubility and in vitro dissolution. The solid state characterization has been carried out using Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) Spectroscopy, Elemental Analysis, X-Ray Powder Diffraction (XRD), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) analysis, Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (TGA) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Simvastatin-Arginine (SMV-ARG) complex exhibited massive solubility enhancement by 12,000 fold and significant improvement in both acidic and alkaline dissolution media. A conversion of coherent crystalline to non-coherent pattern, and certain extent of amorphization in SMV-ARG complex, fully justifies the enhanced solubility, and hence the dissolution profile.", 
    "152": "The cholesterol balance procedure allows the calculation of cholesterol synthesis based on the assumption that loss of endogenous cholesterol via fecal excretion and bile acid synthesis is compensated by de novo synthesis. Under ezetimibe therapy hepatic cholesterol is diminished which can be compensated by hepatic de novo synthesis and hepatic extraction of plasma cholesterol. The plasma lathosterol concentration corrected for total cholesterol concentration (R_Lath) as a marker of de novo cholesterol synthesis is increased during ezetimibe treatment but unchanged under treatment with ezetimibe and simvastatin. Cholesterol balance derived synthesis data increase during both therapies. We hypothesize the following. (1) The cholesterol balance data must be applied to the hepatobiliary cholesterol pool. (2) The calculated cholesterol synthesis value is the sum of hepatic de novo synthesis and the net plasma-liver cholesterol exchange rate. (3) The reduced rate of biliary cholesterol absorption is the major trigger for the regulation of hepatic cholesterol metabolism under ezetimibe treatment. Supportive experimental and literature data are presented that describe changes of cholesterol fluxes under ezetimibe, statin, and combined treatments in omnivores and vegans, link plasma R_Lath to liver function, and define hepatic de novo synthesis as target for regulation of synthesis. An ezetimibe dependent direct hepatic drug effect cannot be excluded.", 
    "153": "Objective Hypercholesterolemia, a risk factor in cognitive impairment, can be treated with statins. However, cognitive decline associated with \"statins\" (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) is a clinical concern. This pilot study investigated the effects of combining statins and regular exercise on cognitive function in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients with prior mild cognitive decline. Methods We recruited 43 consecutive CAD patients with mild cognitive decline. These patients were treated with a statin and weekly in-hospital aerobic exercise for 5 months. We measured serum lipids, exercise capacity, and cognitive function using the mini mental state examination (MMSE). Results Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were significantly decreased, and maximum exercise capacity (workload) was significantly increased in patients with CAD and mild cognitive decline after treatment compared with before. Combined statin-exercise therapy significantly increased the median (range) MMSE score from 24 (22-25) to 25 (23-27) across the cohort (p<0.01). Changes in body mass index (BMI) were significantly and negatively correlated with changes in the MMSE. After treatment, MMSE scores in the subgroup of patients that showed a decrease in BMI were significantly improved, but not in the BMI-increased subgroup. Furthermore, the patients already on a statin at the beginning of the trial displayed a more significant improvement in MMSE score than statin-na\u00efve patients, implying that exercise might be the beneficial aspect of this intervention as regards cognition. In a multivariate logistic regression analysis adjusted for age >65 years, sex, and presence of diabetes mellitus, a decrease in BMI during statin-exercise therapy was significantly correlated with an increase in the MMSE score (odds ratio: 4.57, 95% confidence interval: 1.05-20.0; p<0.05). Conclusion Statin-exercise therapy may help improve cognitive dysfunction in patients with CAD and pre-existing mild cognitive decline.",

    "157": "The aim of the study was to characterize the role of Rac1 GTPase for the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR)-mediated pro-fibrotic remodeling. Transgenic mice with cardiac overexpression of constitutively active Rac1 (RacET) develop an age-dependent phenotype with atrial dilatation, fibrosis, and atrial fibrillation. Expression of MR was similar in RacET and WT mice. The expression of 11\u03b2 hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11\u03b2-HSD2) was age-dependently up-regulated in the atria and the left ventricles of RacET mice on mRNA and protein levels. Statin treatment inhibiting Rac1 geranylgeranylation reduced 11\u03b2-HSD2 up-regulation. Samples of human left atrial myocardium showed a positive correlation between Rac1 activity and 11\u03b2-HSD2 expression (r = 0.7169). Immunoprecipitation showed enhanced Rac1-bound 11\u03b2-HSD2 relative to Rac1 expression in RacET mice that was diminished with statin treatment. Both basal and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced NADPH oxidase activity were increased in RacET and correlated positively with 11\u03b2-HSD2 expression (r = 0.788 and r = 0.843, respectively). In cultured H9c2 cardiomyocytes, Rac1 activation with l-buthionine sulfoximine increased; Rac1 inhibition with NSC23766 decreased 11\u03b2-HSD2 mRNA and protein expression. Connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) up-regulation induced by aldosterone was prevented with NSC23766. Cardiomyocyte transfection with 11\u03b2-HSD2 siRNA abolished the aldosterone-induced CTGF up-regulation. Aldosterone-stimulated MR nuclear translocation was blocked by the 11\u03b2-HSD2 inhibitor carbenoxolone. In cardiac fibroblasts, nuclear MR translocation induced by aldosterone was inhibited with NSC23766 and spironolactone. NSC23766 prevented the aldosterone-induced proliferation and migration of cardiac fibroblasts and the up-regulation of CTGF and fibronectin. In conclusion, Rac1 GTPase regulates 11\u03b2-HSD2 expression, MR activation, and MR-mediated pro-fibrotic signaling.",

Clinical guidelines are intended to help the clinician manage these patients, but guidelines are often discordant among professional organizations and not always evidence based. Clinicians must rely upon the best available evidence, and therefore we critically reviewed the evidence behind the American Diabetes Association (ADA) 2016 guidelines on the prevention of CV disease in diabetes. We believe the most robust evidence comes from randomized controlled trials specifically designed for diabetes with hard clinical endpoints such as mortality and CV events. Our analysis supports the ADA recommendations regarding a Mediterranean diet, glycemic control, and BP control, but we believe the evidence to support aspirin and statin therapy in diabetes is inconclusive. This discordance may be multi-factorial including the exclusion of some relevant studies and an over-reliance upon subgroup and meta-analysis. Given the lack of mortality benefit and inconsistent clinical benefits of aspirin and statins, it is essential that clinicians individualize treatment decisions while carefully weighing the risks and harms of any intervention.",

Whether this beneficial effect can be extended to cirrhosis in the general population or cirrhosis due to other causes, such as hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection or alcohol, remains unknown. Statin use also decreases the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic HBV and HCV infection. It is unclear whether the effect can be observed in patients with pre-existing cirrhosis. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of statin use on rates of decompensation, mortality, and HCC in HBV-, HCV-, and alcohol-related cirrhosis. Patients with cirrhosis were identified from a representative cohort of Taiwan National Health Insurance beneficiaries from 2000 to 2013. Statin users, defined as having a cumulative defined daily dose (cDDD) \u226528, were selected and served as the case cohort. Statin nonusers (<28 cDDD) were matched through propensity scores.

Nutraceutical combination together with a cholesterol-lowering action, when associated with suitable lifestyle, should furnish an alternative to pharmacotherapy in patients reporting statin-intolerance and in subjects at low cardiovascular risk. The present review is focused on nutraceuticals and their synergetic combinations demonstrating a beneficial effect in the management of dyslipidaemia. Several nutraceuticals have been shown to positively modulate lipid metabolism having different functions. Plant sterols and soluble fibres can, for example, decrease the intestinal assimilation of lipids and increase their elimination. Furthermore, berberine and soybean proteins improve the cholesterol uptake in the liver. Policosanols, monacolins and bergamot inhibit hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCoA reductase) enzyme action determining the cholesterol hepatic synthesis. Moreover, pomegranate can decrease LDL oxidation and positively affect subclinical atherosclerosis; red yeast rice and berberine play, instead, an important role on endothelial dysfunction and psyllium, plant sterols and bergamot have positive effects on LDL subclasses. To the best of our knowledge, there are no long-term large-scale studies on the anti-atherogenic effect of the nutraceuticals that are available on the market. Thus, further clinical studies should investigate in order to achieve long term tolerability and safety and to provide a better nutraceutical combination tailored to the patient needs.",

To the best of our knowledge, the following is the very first case of pediatric FH being treated by LDL-apheresis to be reported from India. A severely malnourished female child presented with yellowish skin lesions over different parts of the body, viz., bilateral Achilles tendon, both knees, elbows, both pinnae, and outer canthus of both eyes. She had a strong family history of borderline hypercholesterolemia and was diagnosed as a case of FH. She was maintained on diet modification. LDL-apheresis was planned as the cholesterol levels were not controlled with the diet modificationt. However, unavailability of an appropriate kit in India for LDL-apheresis led to the use of the modified PL1 kit meant for therapeutic plasma exchange procedures. We conducted two sessions of LDL-apheresis. After the first session, the LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) level fell by 75.9% and the total cholesterol fell by 73.5%. A second procedure led to a decline in total cholesterol level by 18.6% and LDL-C by 19.46%.

Despite an increased VLDL-TG FCR following anacetrapib monotherapy (41%; P = 0.11), the VLDL-TG pool was unchanged due to an increase in the VLDL-TG PR (39%; P = 0.014). apoC-II, apoC-III, and apoE pool sizes increased following anacetrapib; however, the mechanisms responsible for these changes differed by treatment group. Anacetrapib increased the VLDL-TG FCR by enhancing the lipolytic potential of VLDL, which lowered the VLDL-TG pool on atorvastatin background.

We assessed clinically used statins and selected fluvastatin for further experimentation, as it showed potent anabolic and anti-catabolic effects on human OA chondrocytes. To achieve controlled intra-articular administration of statin, we developed an intra-articular injectable statin using poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) as a drug delivery system (DDS). The release profile of the statin was evaluated in vitro. Finally, therapeutic effects of fluvastatin-loaded PLGA microspheres (FLU-PLGA) were tested in a rabbit OA model.

However, statins also have a wide range of anti-inflammatory effects independent of their lipid-lowering mechanisms. In depression, low-grade inflammation is a replicated finding, and several studies have shown antidepressant properties of diverse anti-inflammatory drugs. Large observational studies have suggested reduced risks of depression amongst those taking statins, an effect that is thought to be explained by the anti-inflammatory properties of this class of drugs. Also, preliminary randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have indicated that statins may have adjunctive antidepressant effects when used as add-on treatment to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). However, the RCTs were small and limited by low generalizability, and some early observational studies have pointed towards potential neuropsychiatric adverse effects of statin treatment. Nevertheless, based on the good tolerability and general safety of the statins, researchers are currently investigating the potential antidepressant properties of these agents.

The present work demonstrates that 'old' lipid-lowering drugs statins are novel weapons against RB-deficient tumors due to their effects on suppressing MCM7 protein levels.", 
    "230": "Coronary artery calcification as assessed by computed tomography (CT) is a validated predictor of cardiovascular risk, whether identified on a dedicated cardiac study or on a routine non-gated chest CT. The prevalence of incidentally detected coronary artery calcification on non-gated chest CT imaging and consistency of reporting have not been well characterized.",

    "232": "Non-gated chest CT images dated 1/1/2012 to 1/1/2013 were retrospectively reviewed. Demographics and medical history were obtained from charts. Patients with known history of coronary revascularization and/or pacemaker/defibrillator were excluded. Two independent readers with cardiac CT expertise evaluated images for the presence and anatomical distribution of any coronary calcification, blinded to all clinical information including CT reports. Original clinical CT reports were subsequently reviewed.", 
    "233": "Coronary calcification was identified in 204/304 (68%) chest CTs. Patients with calcification were older and had more hyperlipidemia, smoking history, and known coronary artery disease. Of patients with calcification, 43% were on aspirin and 62% were on statin medication at the time of CT. Coronary calcification was identified in 69% of reports when present.", 
    "234": "A high prevalence of coronary calcification was found in non-gated chest CT scans performed for non-cardiac indications. In one-third, coronary calcification was not mentioned in the clinical report when actually present. In this population of patients with cardiac risk factors, standard reporting of the presence of coronary calcification may provide an opportunity for risk factor modification.",

    "237": "We analyzed data from 87 units of internal medicine or geriatric medicine in the REPOSI (Registro Politerapie della Societ\u00e0 Italiana di Medicina Interna) study, with reference to the 2010 and 2012 patient cohorts. Lipid-lowering drug use was closely correlated with the clinical profiles, including multimorbidity markers and polypharmacy.", 
    "238": "2171 patients aged >65\u00a0years were enrolled (1057 males, 1114 females, mean age 78.6\u00a0years). The patients treated with lipid-lowering drugs amounted to 508 subjects (23.4%), with no gender difference. Atorvastatin (39.3%) and simvastatin (34.0%) were the most widely used statin drugs. Likelihood of treatment was associated with polypharmacy (\u22655\u00a0drugs) and with higher Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS) score. At logistic regression analysis, the presence of coronary heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, and hypertension were significantly correlated with lipid-lowering drug use, whereas age showed an inverse correlation. Diabetes was not associated with drug treatment.", 
    "239": "In this in-hospital cohort, the use of lipid-lowering agents was mainly driven by patients' clinical history, most notably the presence of clinically overt manifestations of atherosclerosis. Increasing age seems to be associated with lower prescription rates. This might be indicative of cautious behavior towards a potentially toxic treatment regimen.", 
    "240": "Cardiovascular diseases are nowadays preferential targets of preventive medicine through a straightforward therapy on lipid profile. However, statins, the first-line lipid-lowering drug therapy, specifically act on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), having a modest effect on plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations. Today, a number of novel HDL-targeted therapies are emerging, along with unexpected side effects. Thus, novel and possibly safe substances, able to correct impaired lipid profile in humans, are still in great demand. Herein, based on encouraging clinical data, we formulated a nutraceutical product (AppleMetS(\u00ae), AMS), based on a polyphenolic extract from Annurca apple, and demonstrated that two capsules a day of AMS, after one month, have a LDL-C lowering outcome equivalent to 40\u2009mg of simvastatin or 10\u2009mg of atorvastatin. Nevertheless, different from statin-based therapy, AMS exerted a notable effect on HDL (+49.2%). Based on the trial results, we can assert that AMS formulation could effectively integrate the current therapeutic arsenal to correct impaired lipid profile in humans. Specifically, AMS may be considered a complementary and/or alternative safe substance suitable for the treatment of mildly hypercholesterolemic subjects who do not present occurrence of atheromatous plaques yet.", 
    "241": "Rosuvastatin is a frequently used probe in transporter-mediated drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies. This report describes the development of a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of rosuvastatin for prediction of pharmacokinetic (PK) DDIs. The rosuvastatin model predicted the observed single (i.v. and oral) and multiple dose PK profiles, as well as the impact of coadministration with transporter inhibitors. The predicted effects of rifampin and cyclosporine (6.58-fold and 5.07-fold increase in rosuvastatin area under the curve (AUC), respectively) were mediated primarily via inhibition of hepatic organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1 (Inhibition constant (Ki ) \u223c1.1 and 0.014 \u00b5M, respectively) and OATP1B3 (Ki \u223c0.3 and 0.007 \u00b5M, respectively), with cyclosporine also inhibiting intestinal breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP; Ki \u223c0.07 \u00b5M). The predicted effects of gemfibrozil and its metabolite were moderate (1.88-fold increase in rosuvastatin AUC) and mediated primarily via inhibition of hepatic OATP1B1 and renal organic cation transporter 3. This model of rosuvastatin will be useful in prospectively predicting transporter-mediated DDIs with novel pharmaceutical agents in development.", 
    "242": "There is increasing interest in periprostatic fat and its influence on prostate cancer aggressiveness. In vitro data suggest that adipose stromal/stem cells (ASCs) can increase production of cytokines and growth factors resulting in invasive growth and metastasis in prostate cancer. The objective of the study was to determine the interaction between 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitors (5ARIs) and periprostatic adipose tissue (PPAT) and factors of prostate cancer aggressiveness. In this retrospective study, we identified 61 patients treated with 5ARIs for a period of \u226512\u00a0months before undergoing radiation therapy (brachytherapy or external beam radiotherapy). The control group consisted of 117 patients without any exposure to 5ARIs. Prior to being treated, all patients underwent abdominal computed tomography (CT). To measure PPAT, we defined the fat pad anteriorly to the prostate, as well as the intra-abdominal visceral adipose tissue (VAT) and subcutaneous tissue (SAT) at the level of L4/L5. All contours were performed manually. These adipose tissue measurements were correlated with the Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) score using Pearson correlation coefficient. Differences in fat contents were evaluated using Student's t-test. Median time on 5ARIs for the 61 patients was 12\u00a0months (range 12-96). Patient on 5ARIs had a significantly (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) smaller PPAT (0.4, SD 0.5) than patients without a 5ARI (0.6\u00a0cc, SD 0.4). There was no significant correlation between the CAPRA score and fat measurements when adjusted for 5ARI use (p\u00a0=\u00a00.18). In non-5ARI users, BMI was not correlated with PPAT but was correlated with SAT and VAT volume and its density. There were no significant differences in diabetics (p\u00a0=\u00a00.3), metformin users (p\u00a0=\u00a00.4) or statin users (p\u00a0=\u00a00.09) between both groups. 5ARIs taken for at least 12\u00a0months induce changes in PPAT volume. Whether these changes or the extent of changes will have an influence on outcome remains unknown.",

Reductions in mean fasting glucose -5.70 mg/dL (95%CI: -7.44 to -3.97 mg/dL, P<0.001), HbA1c -0.11% (95%CI: -0.210 to -0.002%, P=0.046) and glycated serum protein -81.8 \u03bcg/mL (95%CI: -93.7 to -69.9 \u03bcg/mL, P<0.001) were demonstrated in salsalate compared to placebo-assigned groups over 30 months. Reductions in fasting glucose and glycated serum protein were greater with salsalate compared to placebo in participants with prediabetes compared to a normoglycemic sub-group (Pinteraction =0.018). Salsalate lowered total white blood cell counts (mean difference -0.7x10(3) /\u03bcL, 95%CI: -1.0 to -0.4 x10(3) /\u03bcL, P<0.001) and increased adiponectin (mean difference 1.8 \u03bcg/mL, 95%CI: 0.9 to 2.6 \u03bcg/mL, P<0.001) and albuminurea (16.7 \u03bcg/mg, 95%CI: 6.4 to 27.1 \u03bcg/mg, P<0.001) compared to placebo, consistent with previous results for patients with type 2 diabetes taking salsalate for shorter times.", 
    "246": "Salsalate improves glycemia in obese persons at increased risk for diabetes, and hence may decrease risk of incident type 2 diabetes. Salsalate may inform new therapeutic approaches for diabetes prevention, but renal safety may limit clinical utility.", 
    "247": "Following the continuous accumulation of evidence supporting the beneficial role of reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in the treatment and prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and its complications, therapeutic possibilities now exist to lower LDL-C to very low levels, similar to or even lower than those seen in newborns and nonhuman species. In addition to the important task of evaluating potential side effects of such treatments, the question arises whether extremely low LDL-C levels per se may provoke adverse effects in humans. In this review, we summarize information from studies of human cellular and organ physiology, phenotypic characterization of rare genetic diseases of lipid metabolism, and experience from clinical trials. Specifically, we emphasize the importance of the robustness of the regulatory systems that maintain balanced fluxes and levels of cholesterol at both cellular and organismal levels. Even at extremely low LDL-C levels, critical capacities of steroid hormone and bile acid production are preserved, and the presence of a cholesterol blood-brain barrier protects cells in the central nervous system. Apparent relationships sometimes reported between less pronounced low LDL-C levels and disease states such as cancer, depression, infectious disease and others can generally be explained as secondary phenomena. Drug-related side effects including an increased propensity for development of type 2 diabetes occur during statin treatment, whilst further evaluation of more potent LDL-lowering treatments such as PCSK9 inhibitors is needed. Experience from the recently reported and ongoing large event-driven trials are of great interest, and further evaluation including careful analysis of cognitive functions will be important.",

    "252": "Residual cardiovascular risk persists despite statins, yet outcome studies of lipid-targeted therapies beyond low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) have not demonstrated added benefit. Triglyceride elevation is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular events. High-dose eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) reduces triglyceride-rich lipoproteins without raising LDL-C. Omega-3s have postulated pleiotropic cardioprotective benefits beyond triglyceride-lowering. To date, no large, multinational, randomized clinical trial has proved that lowering triglycerides on top of statin therapy improves cardiovascular outcomes. The Reduction of Cardiovascular Events with Icosapent Ethyl-Intervention Trial (REDUCE-IT; NCT01492361) is a phase 3b randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of icosapent ethyl, a highly purified ethyl ester of EPA, vs placebo. The main objective is to evaluate whether treatment with icosapent ethyl reduces ischemic events in statin-treated patients with high triglycerides at elevated cardiovascular risk. REDUCE-IT enrolled men or women age \u226545\u2009years with established cardiovascular disease or age \u226550\u2009years with diabetes mellitus and 1 additional risk factor. Randomization required fasting triglycerides \u2265150\u2009mg/dL and <500\u2009mg/dL and LDL-C >40\u2009mg/dL and \u2264100\u2009mg/dL with stable statin (\u00b1 ezetimibe) \u22654\u2009weeks prior to qualifying measurements. The primary endpoint is a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, coronary revascularization, or unstable angina. The key secondary endpoint is the composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or nonfatal stroke. Several secondary, tertiary, and exploratory endpoints will be assessed. Approximately 8000 patients have been randomized at approximately 470 centers worldwide. Follow-up will continue in this event-driven trial until approximately 1612 adjudicated primary-efficacy endpoint events have occurred.",

Based on our findings, the role of statins in improving neurological outcome was limited. However, the risk of DINDs and mortality decreased with higher statin doses in a dose-dependent manner. Hence, further well-designed RCTs with modified protocols in specific patients are required."
