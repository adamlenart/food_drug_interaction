Drawing on such conceptualisations of decision-making, and based on semi-structured interviews with 24 General Practitioners (GPs) in the United Kingdom about the prescription of statins for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, this paper explores the preemptive work that GPs perform when attempting to achieve patient involvement in healthcare decisions. The paper identifies a set of repertoires through which they evaluate and coordinate often contradictory forms of knowledge, transforming them into information that they think is relevant to patients, and which will potentially facilitate meaningful involvement in healthcare decisions. The study concludes by suggesting that such fluid and context sensitive practices are a necessary strategy for navigating complex health environments, which can be justified and underpinned by a relational model of autonomy. However, work needs to be done to explore how such judgments can be calibrated to mesh with the decision-making preferences of patients and what new approaches and standards for practice this would require.",

The purpose of this study was to explore the efficacy of combined therapy with alprostadil and statins in protecting renal function and preventing contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) in patients undergoing coronary angiography.", 
    "2": "A total of 156 consecutive patients with mild to moderate renal failure who underwent coronary angiography were enrolled in our study, and randomly categorized into two groups. In the statins group, 80 patients were treated with statins before and after coronary angiography. In the alprostadil plus statins group, 76 patients were treated with statins and alprostadil before and after coronary angiography. Serum creatinine (SCr), serum cystatin (CysC) and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) were detected after administration of contrast media, and adverse events were evaluated within six months.", 
    "3": "In both groups, the SCr, CysC and NGAL significantly increased after coronary angiography and peaked at 48, 24 and 6 hours, respectively. SCr, CysC and NGAL were significantly lower in the alprostadil plus statins group than in the statins group (P < 0.05). The incidence of CIN in the alprostadil plus statins group was slightly lower than in the statins group. The incidence of adverse events within six months in the alprostadil plus statins group was significantly lower than in the statins group (P = 0.034).",

    "5": "The main problem in Monacolin K (MK) production by submerged fermentation of Monascus purpureus is low productivity. In this study, on one hand, addition of precursors was used to activate the biosynthesis of MK. When 4.0 g/L of sodium citrate was supplemented at the 48th H of the fermentation, the final MK production reached to 1,658.9 \u00b1 28.5 mg/L after 20 day of fermentation, which was improved by 52.6% compared with that of the control. On the other hand, addition of surfactants could increase the permeability of cell membrane, thus driving more intracellular metabolites secreted into the fermentation broth and alleviating the product inhibition. When 40.0 g/L of Triton X-100 was added at the beginning of the fermentation, the final MK production reached to 2,026.0 \u00b1 30.4 mg/L after 20 day of fermentation, which was improved by 84.9% compared with that of the control. These results are helpful to provide some new insights into the biosynthetic regulation on MK production; the approach can be applied to other fungal fermentation processes for enhancing production of useful metabolites.",

    "20": "Statins are widely prescribed cholesterol-lowering drugs that are a first-line treatment of coronary artery disease and atherosclerosis, reducing the incidence of thrombotic events such as myocardial infarction and stroke. Statins have been shown to reduce platelet activation, although the mechanism(s) through which this occurs is unclear. Because several of the characteristic effects of statins on platelets are shared with those elicited by the inhibitory platelet adhesion receptor PECAM-1 (platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1), we investigated a potential connection between the influence of statins on platelet function and PECAM-1 signaling. Statins were found to inhibit a range of platelet functional responses and thrombus formation in vitro and in vivo. Notably, these effects of statins on platelet function in vitro and in vivo were diminished in PECAM-1(-/-) platelets. Activation of PECAM-1 signaling results in its tyrosine phosphorylation, the recruitment and activation of tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, the subsequent binding of phosphoinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), and diminished PI3K signaling. Statins resulted in the stimulation of these events, leading to the inhibition of Akt activation. Together, these data provide evidence for a fundamental role of PECAM-1 in the inhibitory effects of statins on platelet activation, which may explain some of the pleiotropic actions of these drugs.",

But lipid lowering therapy (LLT) was suboptimal in stroke patients and clinically, observation of reducing the dosage of statins is common when target low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level achieved. We aim to explore the changes in lipid profile after reducing statin's dosage when target LDL-C level achieved.",

    "38": "The main objective of this study was to fabricate a controlled drug delivery which is simultaneously effective for bone regeneration. We have encapsulated simvastatin, which enhances osteoblastic activity, in the poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) microspheres. Loading of these microspheres inside the spongy scaffold of biphasic calcium phosphate with the help of Gelatin (Gel) hydrogel controls the delivery of the drug, and ensures a more favorable drug release profile. As a result, some significant benefits have been achieved, such as higher mechanical strength, excellent biocompatibility in in vitro experiments. For determining the characteristics of the composite scaffold, several analysis, such as scanning electron microscope, EDX, X-ray diffraction, FT-IR, and porosity were carried out. The in vitro drug release profile clearly indicates that simvastatin release from the microsphere was more controlled and prolonged after loading in the scaffold. Biocompatibility was certainly higher for the final composite scaffold compared to drug unloaded scaffold, as assessed through MTT assay and Confocal imaging with MC3T3-E1 pre-osteoblast cells. Cell attachment and proliferation were certainly higher in the presence of drug loaded microspheres. Bone remodeling gene and protein expression were observed by real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot respectively. Simvastatin loaded scaffold exhibited the best results in every determination which was carried out.", 
    "39": "The statins are now recognized to have pleiotropic properties, including augmentation of endothelial barrier function. To explore the mechanisms involved, we investigated the effect of simvastatin on endothelial cell (EC) tight junctions. Western blotting of human pulmonary artery ECs treated with simvastatin (5 \u03bcM) confirmed a significant time-dependent increase (16-48 h) in claudin-5 protein expression compared with controls, without detectable alterations in zonula occludens-1 or occludin. These effects were associated with membrane translocation of VE-cadherin, whereas translocation of vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin; silencing RNA) inhibited simvastatin-induced claudin-5 up-regulation. Moreover, simvastatin treatment of ECs induced increased phosphorylation of both FoxO1 and \u03b2-catenin, transcriptional regulators of claudin-5 expression mediated by VE-cadherin. Subsequently, we found no effect of claudin-5 silencing on EC barrier protection by simvastatin in response to thrombin stimulation, as measured by either transendothelial electrical resistance or by EC monolayer flux of FITC-dextran (2,000 kD). However, silencing of claudin-5 did significantly attenuate simvastatin-mediated EC barrier protection in response to thrombin, as measured by monolayer flux of sodium fluorescein (376 Da). Finally, employing a murine model of LPS-induced acute lung injury, there was no effect of claudin-5 silencing in vivo (intratracheal injection) on bronchoalveolar lavage fluid protein or cell counts, but LPS-induced lung tissue extravasation of the small molecular weight markers, sodium fluorescein and Hochst stain (562 Da), were significantly increased in claudin-5-silenced animals compared with simvastatin-treated control animals. These findings implicate a distinct mechanism underlying size-selective endothelial barrier-protective properties of statins, and may ultimately lead to new novel therapeutic targets for patients with acute lung injury.", 
    "40": "Trafficking of autoreactive leukocytes across the blood-nerve barrier and into peripheral nerves is an early pathological hallmark of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS). Tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), a proinflammatory cytokine, promotes transendothelial migration by upregulating endothelial expression of inflammatory mediators, including CCL2, a chemokine implicated in GBS. We sought to determine the mechanism by which TNF-\u03b1 induces expression and secretion of CCL2 from peripheral nerve microvascular endoneurial endothelial cells (PNMECs). Expression of CCL2 mRNA and protein in quiescent PNMEC cultures was minimal. In contrast, cultures treated with TNF-\u03b1 exhibited increased CCL2 mRNA and protein content, as well as protein secretion. Simvastatin significantly attenuated TNF-\u03b1-induced CCL2 secretion without affecting CCL2 mRNA or protein expression. Co-incubation with geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, but not farnesyl pyrophosphate, prevented the effect of simvastatin. By comparison, inhibiting protein isoprenylation with GGTI-298, but not FTI-277, mimicked the effect of simvastatin and significantly attenuated transendothelial migration in vitro. Inhibition of the monomeric GTPase Cdc42, but not Rac1 or RhoA-C, attenuated TNF-\u03b1-mediated CCL2 secretion. TNF-\u03b1-mediated trafficking of autoreactive leukocytes into peripheral nerves during GBS may proceed by a mechanism that involves Cdc42-facilitated secretion of CCL2.",

Since this can affect all arteries of the body, PAOD is considered an important indicator of cardiovascular events such as heart attack or stroke, and thus of the leading cause of death in the Western world. With the measurement of the ankle/brachial pressure index (ABI), a practicable method is available to diagnose the disease in routine practice. Besides lifestyle modifications, the mainstay of treatment of atherosclerosis includes also drug treatment of known risk factors. In case of a severe circulatory disorder with critical ischemia, a revascularization by angioplasty or surgical methods is imperative. If the walking distance is limited due to PAOD, we speak of intermittent claudication. Here, in addition to the interventional treatment (percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) / surgery), a conservative walking exercise can be performed.

The changes were independent of changes in LDL-cholesterol and were not correlated with changes in creatine kinase levels. In HSKMCs, simvastatin significantly increased irisin secretion as well as mRNA expression of its parent peptide hormone FNDC5. Simvastatin significantly induced cellular reactive oxygen species levels along with expression of pro- and anti-oxidative genes such as Nox2, and MnSOD and catalase, respectively. Markers of cellular stress such as atrogin-1 mRNA and Bax protein expression were also induced by simvastatin.

A novel uptake and efflux protocol was developed in sandwich-cultured hepatocytes (SCH) to achieve desired tight junction modulation while maintaining cell viability. Subsequently, studies were conducted to determine the role of CLBL in the hepatic disposition of RSV using SCH from wild-type (WT) and multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (Mrp2)-deficient (TR(-)) rats in the absence and presence of the P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein (Bcrp) inhibitor elacridar (GF120918). RSV CLBile was nearly ablated by GF120918 in TR(-) SCH, confirming that Mrp2 and Bcrp are responsible for the majority of RSV CLBile. Pharmacokinetic modeling revealed that CLBL and CLBile represent alternative elimination routes with quantitatively similar contributions to the overall hepatocellular excretion of RSV in rat SCH under baseline conditions (WT SCH in the absence of GF120918) and also in human SCH. Membrane vesicle experiments revealed that RSV is a substrate of MRP4 (Km = 21 \u00b1 7 \u00b5M, Vmax = 1140 \u00b1 210 pmol/min per milligram of protein). Alterations in MRP4-mediated RSV CLBL due to drug-drug interactions, genetic polymorphisms, or disease states may lead to changes in hepatic and systemic exposure of RSV, with implications for the safety and efficacy of this commonly used medication.", 
    "66": "Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-tumor necrosis factor receptor 6 (TRAF6) signaling is activated in atherosclerosis (AS), inducing inflammatory mediators. Because miR-146a, a TLR4 microRNA (miRNA), can regulate TLR4 signaling during inflammatory responses, this study investigated the effects of aerobic exercise on TLR4-targeted miRNAs in AS. Apolipoprotein E-null mice fed a high-fat diet for 12 weeks were separated into 3 groups: (i) no treatment (AS), (ii) statin treatment (AD), or (iii) aerobic exercise (AE). Plaques and foam cells were observed in the untreated control and statin groups, respectively, but not in the AE group. Reduced angiotensin II (Ang II) and endothelin 1 (ET1) levels were observed in the AE group. Both treatment groups significantly altered the expression of inflammatory cytokine expression and reduced vascular TLR4 levels. Increased miR-146a and miR-126 and reduced miR-155 levels were observed in both treatment groups (all, P<0.001). miR-146a interacted with the 3' untranslated region of the TRAF6 gene, reducing its expression. Thus, aerobic exercise and statins may induce miR-146a expression, thereby reducing vascular TRAF and TLR4 signaling and vascular inflammatory injury in AS. Further analysis of this pathway may provide insight into the protective effects of aerobic exercise on vascular disease as well as new therapeutic targets.",

Still, renal patients with cardiac disease have largely been excluded from the clinical trials that have been the basis of modern cardiologic treatment. In this review, the current understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the cardiorenal syndrome and potential therapeutic implications will be summarized from a nephrologist's point of view. Probably, fragile cardiorenal patients will benefit from an enhanced collaboration between cardiologists and nephrologists to secure the best treatment given under safe conditions.", 
    "75": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors or statins beyond their lipid lowering properties and mevalonate inhibition exert also their actions through a multiplicity of mechanisms. In heart failure (HF) the inhibition of isoprenoid intermediates and small GTPases, which control cellular function such as cell shape, secretion and proliferation, is of clinical significance. Statins share also the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor pathway and inactivate extracellular-signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation suppressing inflammatory cascade. By down-regulating Rho/Rho kinase signaling pathways, statins increase the stability of eNOS mRNA and induce activation of eNOS through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/eNOS pathway restoring endothelial function. Statins change also myocardial action potential plateau by modulation of Kv1.5 and Kv4.3 channel activity and inhibit sympathetic nerve activity suppressing arrhythmogenesis. Less documented evidence proposes also that statins have anti-hypertrophic effects - through p21ras/mitogen activated protein kinase pathway - which modulate synthesis of matrix metalloproteinases and procollagen 1 expression affecting interstitial fibrosis and diastolic dysfunction. Clinical studies have partly confirmed the experimental findings and despite current guidelines new evidence supports the notion that statins can be beneficial in some cases of HF. In subjects with diastolic HF, moderately impaired systolic function, low b-type natriuretic peptide levels, exacerbated inflammatory response and mild interstitial fibrosis evidence supports that statins can favorably affect the outcome. Under the lights of this evidence in this review article we discuss the current knowledge on the mechanisms of statins' actions and we link current experimental and clinical data to further understand the possible impact of statins' treatment on HF syndrome.",

Statins administered at the time of PCI, particularly before the procedure, have been shown to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction during PCI, but the applicability of this treatment may be limited because of the widespread use of statins in patients with existing coronary artery disease, or in those at risk of developing the disease. The results of a study are reported in this issue of the journal in which a single dose of atorvastatin is given prior to PCI to patients already taking a statin, and shows a significant reduction in the risk of peri-procedural myocardial infarction.

The purpose of this study was to test the effect of local simvastatin implant on bone defect healing; to evaluate the mobilization, migration, and homing of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) induced by simvastatin. We found that local simvastatin implant increased bone formation by 51.8% (week 6) and 64.8% (week 12) compared with polyglycolic acid controls (P < 0.01), as verified by X-ray, CT, and histology. Simvastatin increased migration capacity of BMSCs and EPCs in vitro (P < 0.05). Local simvastatin implant increased mobilization of EPCs to the peripheral blood by 127% revealed by FACS analysis (P < 0.01), and increased osteogenic BMSCs to the peripheral blood dramatically revealed by Alizarin Red-S staining for mineralized nodules formation. Pre-transplanted GFP-transfected BMSCs as a tracing cell and bioluminescence imaging revealed that local simvastatin implant recruited GFP-labeled BMSC. Also, local simvastatin implant induced the HIF-1\u03b1 and BMP-2 expression. In conclusion, local simvastatin implantation promotes bone defect healing, where the underlying mechanism appears to involve the higher expression of HIF-1\u03b1 and BMP-2, thus recruit autogenous osteogenic and angiogenetic stem cells to the bone defect area implanted with simvastatin.",

Because there is no evidence that screening leads to fewer cardiovascular events or lower all-cause mortality, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends against screening for PAD. Management of claudication includes exercise, smoking cessation, statin therapy, and antiplatelet therapy with aspirin or clopidogrel, and possibly cilostazol in patients with no history of heart failure.

Cognitive dysfunction is a subtler and more common form of neurologic injury than stroke. We aimed to determine whether reduced middle cerebral artery (MCA) mean velocity (MV) predicts cognitive dysfunction and if so, whether a threshold of increased risk of cognitive dysfunction can be identified. One hundred twenty-four CEA patients were included in this observational study and neuropsychometrically evaluated preoperatively and 24 hours postoperatively. MCA-MV was measured by TCD and percentage of baseline during cross-clamp was calculated (MV(cross-clamp)/MV(baseline)). Patients with cognitive dysfunction had significantly lower MV during cross-clamp than those without cognitive dysfunction (33.1 \u00b1 13.7 cm/s versus 39.6 \u00b1 16.0 cm/s, p=0.02). In the final multivariate model, each percent reduction in MV was significantly associated with greater risk of cognitive dysfunction (odds ratio [OR]: 0.05 [95% confidence interval {CI} 0.01-0.23], p < 0.001) while statin use was associated with lower risk (OR: 0.33 [95% CI 0.12-0.92], p = 0.03). Using receiver operator characteristic curve analysis, the Youden index identified 72% of baseline MV during cross-clamp as the cutoff of maximum discrimination. Significantly more patients with MV < 72% of baseline during cross-clamp exhibited cognitive dysfunction than patients with MV \u2265 72% of baseline (74.1% versus 27.1%, p < 0.001). Reduced MCA-MV during cross-clamp is a predictor of cognitive dysfunction exhibited 24 hours after CEA. MCA-MV reduced to <72% of baseline, or a \u226528% reduction from baseline, is the threshold most strongly associated with increased risk of cognitive dysfunction.

Basically, statins were effective in inhibiting all dermatophyte studied, but were particularly active against M. canis and T. mentagrophytes. Fluvastatin and simvastatin were active against all of the tested fungi causing a complete inhibition of their growth at very low concentrations (6.25-12.5 \u03bcg/ml). Lovastatin and rosuvastatin had inhibitory effects at higher concentrations (25-128 \u03bcg/ml), while atorvastatin and pravastatin proved the less effective. The in vitro interactions between statins and different antifungals (ketoconazole, itraconazole, fluconazole, amphotericin B, nystatin, griseofulvin, terbinafine and primycin) were also investigated using a standard chequerboard broth microdilution method. Synergetic interactions were observed in several cases, most of them were noticed when statins were combined with terbinafine and the different azoles. Some combinations were particularly active (ketoconazole-simvastatin or terbinafine-simvastatin), as they were found to exert synergistic effect against all of the investigated isolates. The other antifungals showed synergistic interactions with statins in only certain cases. These results suggest that statins exert substantial antifungal effects against dermatophyte fungi and they should be promising components in a combination therapy as they can act synergistically with a number of clinically used antifungal agents.",

One large randomized controlled study from China found that red yeast rice significantly improved risk of major adverse cardiovascular events and overall survival in patients following myocardial infarction.

Given the physiological importance of this transcript, our goal was to identify molecules that regulate HMGCR alternative splicing. We recently reported gene expression changes in 480 lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) after in vitro simvastatin treatment, and identified a number of statin-responsive genes involved in mRNA splicing. Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 (HNRNPA1) was chosen for follow-up since rs3846662, an HMGCR SNP that regulates exon 13 skipping, was predicted to alter an HNRNPA1 binding motif. Here, we not only demonstrate that rs3846662 modulates HNRNPA1 binding, but also that sterol depletion of human hepatoma cell lines reduced HNRNPA1 mRNA levels, an effect that was reversed with sterol add-back. Overexpression of HNRNPA1 increased the ratio of HMGCR13(-) to total HMGCR transcripts by both directly increasing exon 13 skipping in an allele-related manner and specifically stabilizing the HMGCR13(-) transcript. Importantly, HNRNPA1 overexpression also diminished HMGCR enzyme activity, enhanced LDL-C uptake and increased cellular apolipoprotein B (APOB). rs1920045, an SNP associated with HNRNPA1 exon 8 alternative splicing, was also associated with smaller statin-induced reduction in total cholesterol from two independent clinical trials.

Muscle biopsy is required for diagnosis, revealing active necrosis of the muscle fibers without inflammatory invasion by CDA+ or CD8+ T-cells. Deposition of a microvascular membrane attack complex (C5b9) is often noted, whereas the upregulation of MHC class 1 is rarely detected. Signs of endomysial microangiopathy are frequently reported. Necrotizing autoimmune myopathies can be associated with antisignal recognition particle (SRP) antibodies or more rarely with the usual inflammatory myopathy antibodies. Paraneoplasic forms are described but remain exceptional. Lastly, necrotizing autoimmune myopathies, sometimes associated with statin therapy, have been recently described.

The ability to predict uptake clearance and to determine the contribution of individual transporters to overall hepatic uptake is therefore critical in assessing the potential pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic variability associated with drug-drug interactions and pharmacogenetics. The present study revisited the interaction of statin drugs, including pitavastatin, fluvastatin and rosuvastatin, with the sodium-dependent taurocholate co-transporting polypeptide (NTCP) using gene transfected cell models. In addition, the uptake clearance and the contribution of NTCP to the overall hepatic uptake were assessed using in vitro hepatocyte models. Then NTCP protein expression was measured by a targeted proteomics transporter quantification method to confirm the presence and stability of NTCP expression in suspended and cultured hepatocyte models. It was concluded that NTCP-mediated uptake contributed significantly to active hepatic uptake in hepatocyte models for all three statins. However, the contribution of NTCP-mediated uptake to the overall active hepatic uptake was compound-dependent and varied from about 24% to 45%. Understanding the contribution of individual transporter proteins to the overall hepatic uptake and its functional variability when other active hepatic uptake pathways are interrupted could improve the current prediction practice used to assess the pharmacokinetic variability due to drug-drug interactions, pharmacogenetics and physiopathological conditions in humans.", 
    "202": "A high-lipid diet is one of the main risk factors in atherosclerosis and can induce changes in the composition of plasma membrane microdomains. In response, important functions such as vesicle trafficking, protein docking, signaling and receptor recognition are significantly altered. In particular, interactions of heat-shock proteins (Hsps), acting as danger signals, with components of the membrane microdomains can influence signaling pathways and the inflammatory response of cells. Our study focuses on the composition of detergent-resistant membrane (DRM) isolated from ApoE-/- mice fed a standard or high-fat diet with and without fluvastatin treatment versus appropriate controls. Biochemical studies, immunoblotting and liquid chromatography mass spectrometric analysis were performed to investigate whether the structural components (such as caveolin and cavin) of the detergent-resistant microdomains were correlated with the expression and secretion of stress-inducible Hsps (Hsp70 and Hsp90) and AKT phosphorylation in experimental atherosclerosis. ApoE-/- mice challenged with a high-fat diet developed extensive atherosclerotic plaques in lesion-prone areas. DRM harvested from hyperlipidemic animals showed a modified biochemical composition with cholesterol, glycerolipids, caveolin-1 and phospho-AKT being up-regulated, whereas cavin-1 and dynamin were down-regulated. The data also demonstrated the co-fractionation of Hsps with caveolin-1 in isolated DRM, expression being positively correlated with their secretion into blood serum. Statin therapy significantly attenuated the processes induced by the development of atherosclerosis in ApoE-/- mice under a high-fat diet. Thus, high-lipid stress induces profound changes in DRM biochemistry and modifies the cellular response, supporting the systemic inflammatory onset of atherosclerosis.",

In this study, the B. trispora (-) strain, a major mating type for lycopene production, was treated with N(+) ion implantation and N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (NTG), and further isolated on the screening plates supplemented with lovastatin and crude extracts of trisporic acid (CTA). After several rounds of screening, four mutants with higher yield of lycopene and biomass were isolated. Among these mutants, I5 obtained with N(+) ion implantation showed a maximum lycopene yield (28.8 mg/g), which was 64 % higher than the parent strain (17.5 mg/g) in the production of lycopene. The results indicated that N(+) ion implantation is more suitable for B. trispora (-) than NTG treatment, and the addition of lovastatin promoted the generation of positive mutant and CTA amplified the color differences between colonies.", 
    "204": "Statins are prescribed widely to lower plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) concentrations and cardiovascular disease risk and have been shown to have beneficial effects in a broad range of patients. However, statins are associated with an increased risk, albeit small, of clinical myopathy and type 2 diabetes. Despite evidence for substantial genetic influence on LDL concentrations, pharmacogenomic trials have failed to identify genetic variations with large effects on either statin efficacy or toxicity, and have produced little information regarding mechanisms that modulate statin response. Here we identify a downstream target of statin treatment by screening for the effects of in vitro statin exposure on genetic associations with gene expression levels in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from 480 participants of a clinical trial of simvastatin treatment. This analysis identified six expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) that interacted with simvastatin exposure, including rs9806699, a cis-eQTL for the gene glycine amidinotransferase (GATM) that encodes the rate-limiting enzyme in creatine synthesis. We found this locus to be associated with incidence of statin-induced myotoxicity in two separate populations (meta-analysis odds ratio = 0.60). Furthermore, we found that GATM knockdown in hepatocyte-derived cell lines attenuated transcriptional response to sterol depletion, demonstrating that GATM may act as a functional link between statin-mediated lowering of cholesterol and susceptibility to statin-induced myopathy.",
