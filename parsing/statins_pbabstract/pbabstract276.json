We hypothesized that early use of statins would decrease cardiovascular events, including heart failure in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI). To examine the effect of statins in Japanese patients with AMI, a prospective, randomized, open-label trial was conducted in 486 patients with normal total cholesterol levels. Patients were randomly assigned to receive any available statin (n = 241) within 96 hours of AMI onset or no statin (n = 245) and were followed for up to 24 months. The primary end point was a composite of cardiovascular death, nonfatal AMI, recurrent symptomatic myocardial ischemia, congestive heart failure, and stroke. Event rate for the primary end point was lower in the statin group than in the nonstatin group (6.1% vs 11.4%, p = 0.0433). The statin group had a lower risk of congestive heart failure and symptomatic myocardial ischemia (p = 0.0154 and 0.0264, respectively). In conclusion, early lipid-lowering therapy with statins decreases recurrent cardiovascular events, in particular, congestive heart failure.", 
    "1": "Several landmark clinical trials suggest that 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) have additional cardiovascular protective activity that may function independently of their ability to lower serum cholesterol. The cardiovascular protective effects of statins are partly caused by the activation of postnatal neovascularization. At therapeutic doses, statins promote proliferation, migration and survival of endothelial cells, induce mobilization and differentiation of bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells by stimulating the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt (also known as protein kinase B) and nitric oxide (NO) signal pathway. However, at excessive doses, statins may decrease protein isoprenylation as well as inhibit endothelial cell growth and migration. NO is an important signaling molecule that regulates a wide range of physiological and pathological processes in different tissues. There is substantial evidence that effective neovascularization requires endothelium-derived NO. Statins have pleiotropic effects on the expression and activity of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and lead to improved NO bioavailability. NO plays an important role in the effects of statins on neovascularization. In this review, we focus on the effects of statins on neovascularization and highlight specific novel targets, such as endothelial progenitor cells and NO.",

    "3": "The present study involved a detailed post hoc comparison of the efficacy and safety of lipid-lowering therapy in elderly hypercholesterolemic patients from the Fukuoka Atherosclerosis Trial (FAST). The FAST cohort of 246 hypercholesterolemic patients included 76 patients who were (75 years old. Patients were randomized to receive probucol (500 mg/day) or pravastatin (10 mg/day) therapy, or to a control group (diet alone), and then were followed for 2 years. In patients > or = 75 years old, either probucol or pravastatin achieved a significant reduction of carotid intima-media thickness (IMT). In patients <75 years old, lipid-lowering therapy also achieved a significant reduction of IMT. In patients > or = 75 years old receiving probucol, the relative risk (95% confidence interval) of all-cause mortality was 0.15 (0.02 to 1.28) and that for major coronary events was 0.12 (0.02 to 1.04). In conclusion, probucol reduced the incidence of cardiovascular disease in elderly hypercholesterolemic patients as well as younger patients.", 
    "4": "Coronary atherosclerosis begins in early life and progresses through adulthood, exacerbated by various risk factors. The past decade has witnessed an increasing recognition that endothelial dysfunction and inflammatory mechanisms play a central role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Advances in the management of patients with ACS have evolved dramatically. Recently the concept of interventional cardiology expand beyond mechanical revascularization to embrace preventive interventions that forestall future cardiac and vascular events. The pleiotropic effect of preventive agents contributes to early and significant risk reduction in high-risk patients and also after being suffered from ACS.", 
    "5": "In PROVE IT trial, intensive lipid-lowering therapy with statin (80 mg of atorvastatin daily) provides greater protection against cardiovascular events than does a standard regimen (40 mg of pravastatin daily) in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), indicating that such patients benefit from early and continued lowering of LDL cholesterol to levels substantially below current target levels. However, differences between Japanese and Westerns as far as atherogenesis and response to statins are concerned, remain an unsolved problem that requires additional investigation. New guideline for the management of patients with ACS is needed for Japanese patients.", 
    "6": "ATP Binding Cassette (ABC) transporter, ABCA1, plays a pivotal role in reverse cholesterol transport by mediating the cellular efflux of phospholipid and cholesterol. Studies using intact cells strongly suggest that ABCA1 acts as a phospholipid floppase, but there has been no direct demonstration that the protein is a primary active sterol transporter. Using membrane vesicles from insect Sf21 cells, we found that ABCA1 mediated ATP-dependent uptake of [(3)H]25-hydroxycholesterol with an apparent K(m) of 0.7 muM. Consistent with this high apparent affinity, expression of ABCA1 in human embryonic kidney cells both increased rapid efflux of 25-hydroxcholesterol and prevented oxysterol-mediated repression of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase mRNAs. Comparison of wild-type and ABCA1(-/-) murine fibroblasts indicates that 25-hydroxycholesterol is effluxed approximately 5-fold more rapidly by wild-type cells. In addition, the rate of efflux from the wild-type but not the ABCA1(-/-) fibroblasts is increased a further twofold by inducers of ABCA1 expression. Thus under the experimental conditions employed, endogenous ABCA1 is a major contributor to 25-hydroxycholesterol efflux from wild-type fibroblasts. Evidence from in vitro studies indicates that oxysterols are potent inducers of genes involved in cellular cholesterol efflux and metabolism, including the ABCA1 gene, and repressors of genes involved in cholesterol synthesis or uptake. Our observations raise the possibility that efflux of oxysterols by ABCA1 could contribute to a homeostatic mechanism, which both attenuates oxysterol-induced expression of its cognate gene and alleviates repression of genes encoding proteins, such as HMG-CoA reductase and LDL receptor.", 
    "7": "The amyloidogenesis occurring in Alzheimer's disease represents a fundamental membrane-related pathology involving a membrane-bound substrate metabolized by integral membrane proteases (secretases). Thus, the amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta), which accumulates extracellularly as plaques in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients, is derived by sequential proteolytic cleavage of the integral transmembrane amyloid precursor protein (APP). Beta-Secretase or BACE-1 (beta-site APP cleaving enzyme) is a transmembrane aspartic protease responsible for the first of these cleavage events, generating the soluble APP ectodomain sAPPbeta, and a C-terminal fragment CTFbeta. CTFbeta is subsequently cleaved by the ?gamma-secretase complex, of which presenilin is the catalytic core, to produce Ass. A variety of studies indicate that cholesterol is an important factor in the regulation of Ass production, with high cholesterol levels being linked to increased Ass generation and deposition. However, the mechanism(s) underlying this effect are unclear at present. Recent evidence suggests that amyloidogenic APP processing may preferentially occur in the cholesterol-rich regions of membranes known as lipid rafts, and that changes in cholesterol levels could exert their effects by altering the distribution of APP-cleaving enzymes within the membrane. Rafts may be involved in the aggregation of Ass and also in its clearance by amyloid-degrading enzymes such as plasmin or possibly neprilysin (NEP).", 
    "8": "Statins inhibit 3-hydroxy-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, a rate-limiting enzyme for cholesterol synthesis, and share the common mechanism of lowering circulating levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Among various statins, atorvastatin is the most widely used statin for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Recent clinical trials show that atorvastatin reduces the risk of cardiovascular events and slows the progression of atherosclerosis in patients with coronary artery diseases. Further, intensive therapy with atorvastatin is also associated with an early clinical benefit in patients with acute coronary syndrome. These observations support the concept that beyond lipid-lowering effects of atorvastatin, that is, pleiotropic effects, could contribute at least in part to cardiovascular event reduction. Diabetic vascular complication is a leading cause of end-stage renal failure, acquired blindness, a variety of neuropathies and accelerated atherosclerosis, which could account for disabilities and high mortality rates in patients with diabetes. However, whether atorvastatin therapy decreases the risk for the development and progression of diabetic vascular complications and the way that it might achieve these effects are not fully elucidated. In this paper, we focus on diabetic vascular complications and review the efficacy and safety of atorvastatin in the treatment of these devastating disorders. We further discuss here the possible vasculoprotective properties of atorvastatin in patients with diabetes.", 
    "9": "Clopidogrel and statins are frequently administered in patients with ischemic heart disease or other atherothrombotic manifestations and are effective in the prevention of cardiovascular disease. The thienopyridine clopidogrel is a pro-drug metabolised in the liver via the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 system to the active compound which inhibits the P2Y(12) ADP platelet receptor. The assumption exists that the effect of clopidogrel in inhibiting platelet aggregation is attenuated by co-administration of lipophilic statins such as atorvastatin or simvastatin which are metabolised by the CYP3A4 system to inactive substrates. Assessing a possible drug-drug interaction ex-vivo, inconclusive studies have been published: In an aggregometer study, a strong and dose-dependent interference between atorvastatin and the inhibitory effect of clopidogrel on platelet function was observed. Another study, measuring the effect of clopidogrel by flow cytometry, found a significant attenuation of the clopidogrel effect by lipophilic statins, predominantly in the loading phase. In contrast a recent study, which used 600 mg clopidogrel for loading, found no significant interference between various statins and clopidogrel on ADP-induced platelet aggregation and in addition another study revealed no attenuation of the clopidogrel effect despite statin co-medication after 5 weeks. Additionally, retrospective analysis of clinical studies (CREDO-study) or registries (MITRA-PLUS) revealed no significant influence of different statins on the clinical outcome in patients treated with clopidogrel. However, these clinical studies showed a trend towards a diminishing effect of clopidogrel on those treated with cytochrome CYP3A4 metabolised statins. Even more important seems to be the considerable variability in the response of the antiplatelet effect of clopidogrel. A certain percentage of patients apparently do not respond adequately to clopidogrel treatment. This effect of clopidogrel resistance seems to be more important as the potential interference between CYP3A4 metabolized statins and clopidogrel. Finally, up until now sufficient evidence has not been gained to prefer hydrophil statins on patients receiving clopidogrel co-medication or when to discontinue the use of statins in clopidogrel treatment. Prospective studies are necessary in order to evaluate the magnitude of clopidogrel resistance and the impact of clopidogrel co-medication as well as to redefine antithrombotic therapy for this subgroup.", 
    "10": "The enterohepatic circulation of bile acids is a major regulator of serum cholesterol homeostasis. After biosynthesis from cholesterol in the liver, bile acids are secreted with bile into the lumen of the small intestine to aid in the digestion and absorption of fat and fat-soluble vitamins. The bile acids are nearly quantitatively reabsorbed in the terminal ileum by a Na+-dependent transport system (IBAT) and are transported with portal blood to the liver and taken up by a second Na+-/bile acid cotransporter (LBAT) to be resecreted into bile. In the liver bile acids inhibit the rate-limiting enzyme for the conversion of cholesterol into bile acid: cholesterol-7alpha-hydroxylase; interruption of the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids withdraws this feedback inhibition and leads to an upregulation of hepatic LDL-receptors with a concomitant decrease of serum LDL-levels. Specific inhibitors of the ileal bile acid transporter belonging to different chemotypes have been developed in recent years for this purpose, some now entering clinical stage. To exert a profound systemic effect these compounds do not need to be available systemically but can act from the luminal side of the small intestine, which offers the advantage to avoid the well-known adverse side effects of other hypolipidemic drugs like statins due to metabolism and drug-drug interactions in the liver. This implies several aspects in compound optimization and drug development quite different from standard procedures, for example the concept of low absorption drugs was established to avoid systemic side effects. The review article covers the mechanistic and therapeutic principles of the approach and presents an overview on the molecular target, the discovery of specific inhibitors and respective optimization strategies.",

Admission criteria in the study were: age > or = 65 years old and high serum levels of cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL-C/HDL-C ratio. The patient population was divided into two groups: Group I of 40 patients treated for dyslipidemia only with diet and Group II with 44 patients in which was associated treatment with hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, 10 mg/day. The patients were controlled when admitted in the study and then at 3 and 6 weeks afterwards.", 
    "14": "Serum cholesterol and triglycerides concentration lowering was modest in Group I at 3 and 6 weeks, maybe because we registered a progressively lowered compliance of patients to hypocholesterolemic diet. In Group II the results were much better as we obtained significant serum cholesterol and triglycerides levels lowering after 3 weeks of treatment, and in 32 cases (72%) we had a normal lipid profile after 6 weeks of treatment. The other 12 patients (28%) abandoned treatment after 4 weeks of therapy because of financial reasons. There were no side effects during the treatment with hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors.", 
    "15": "The therapy with hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors associated to hypocholesterolemic diet controlled efficiently dyslipidemia in elderly patients. Diet alone could not control cholesterol and triglycerides levels, mainly because of lack of adherence of the patients to the diet. Based on the fact that dyslipidemia is a major, independent cardiovascular risk factor, we consider that therapy with hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme-A-reductase inhibitors is beneficial in elderly patients because of their efficacity, minimal side effects and protection against sudden death, myocardial infarction and stroke.",

Rosuvastatin dissolved in physiological saline was administered intraperitoneally 60 min before ischemia. The severity of the intestinal mucosal injury and inflammation were evaluated by several biochemical markers, as well as by histological findings. The protein levels of eNOS were determined by Western blot.", 
    "18": "The levels of both intraluminal hemoglobin and protein, as indices of mucosal damage, were significantly increased in the I-R group compared with those in the sham-operated group. These increases, however, were significantly inhibited by treatment with rosuvastatin in a dose-dependent manner. The protective effects of rosuvastatin were also confirmed by histological findings. Exposure of the small intestine to I-R resulted in mucosal inflammation characterized by significant increases in thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances, tissue-associated myeloperoxidase activity, and the mucosal contents of rat cytokine-induced neutrophil chemoattractant-1 (CINC-1) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). These increases in inflammatory parameters after I-R were significantly inhibited by pretreatment with rosuvastatin at a dose of 10 mg/kg. Furthermore, mRNA expression of CINC-1 and TNF-alpha was increased after I-R, and this increase was also inhibited by rosuvastatin. The mucosal protein levels of eNOS decreased during I-R, but were preserved in rats treated with rosuvastatin.",

    "26": "Endothelial function is known to predict cardiovascular disease. The aim of the present study was to examine whether endothelial function in smokers with normal cholesterol levels could be normalized by treatment with 80 mg of atorvastatin in comparison with a control group. Healthy smokers (n=20) and non-smokers (n=20) were randomized to receive 80 mg of atorvastatin or placebo in an open randomized cross-over study, followed by measurement of endothelial functional [FMD (flow-mediated dilation)]. At baseline, smokers had a lower FMD compared with the non-smoking group (2.2+/-0.5 and 4.5+/-0.8% respectively; P<0.05). In the smoking group, FMD increased significantly (P<0.05) to 4.0+/-0.8% during treatment with atorvastatin and returned to basal levels during placebo (2.3+/-0.6%). In the non-smoking group, FMD was unaffected by both atorvastatin and placebo. The net change of total cholesterol or LDL (low-density lipoprotein)-cholesterol was not associated with the net change in FMD when the study group was considered as a whole or the smoking group was considered separately. In conclusion, improved endothelial function was observed in a group of smokers when they were received 80 mg of atorvastatin, whereas atorvastatin had no effect on endothelial function in the non-smoking group. The improved FMD among smokers was independent of the decrease in LDL-cholesterol during atorvastatin treatment. The results show that poor endothelial function in smokers with normal lipid levels can be improved by a statin treatment.",

A parametric method was used to estimate the distribution of valve explants; a multivariable risk factor model was then developed to include patient demographics, cardiac and non-cardiac comorbidities, valve type and interactions.

This is related to the frequent presence of underlying coronary artery disease. The aim of the preoperative cardiac risk assessment is to evaluate the presence and degree of coronary artery disease along with other risk factors such as cerebrovascular disease, renal insufficiency, and diabetes mellitus that may influence the perioperative risk of these patients. Based on the presence and number of cardiac risk factors the individual risk profile can be determined, which may facilitate medical decision making about the perioperative and long-term management of these patients. In the present review based on data from current literature we summarized the pathology of perioperative cardiac complications, and the role of cardiac risk assessment and risk reduction strategies in patients undergoing major vascular surgery. In this review the authors summarized data from current literature and found that a limited set of risk factors and a result of a noninvasive test used for detection of coronary artery disease may help to stratify patients into low-, intermediate- and high risk for perioperative cardiac complications. If patients with intermediate- to high-risk prescribed beta-blockers the risk of cardiac complications can be reduced. Along with beta-blockers it was also found that perioperative use of statins may also help to reduce the risk of cardiac complications. In patients identified to be at very high-risk further perioperative evaluation and management should include coronary angiography with subsequent coronary revascularization if there is a clearly defined need, independent of the need for vascular surgery.",

Sprague-Dawley rats received oral ATV (10 mg.kg-1.day-1), Pio (10 mg.kg-1.day-1), their combination (Pio+ATV), or water alone for 3 days. Additional rats received Pio (10 mg.kg-1.day-1) for 3 days and intravenous SC-58125 [a cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor] or SC-560 (a COX-1 inhibitor) 15 min before ischemia. Rats underwent 30 min of myocardial ischemia and 4 h of reperfusion, or hearts were harvested for analysis. IS in the Pio and in the ATV groups was significantly smaller than in the sham-treated group. IS in the Pio+ATV group was smaller than in all other groups (P<0.001 vs. each group). The protective effect of Pio was abrogated by SC-58125 but not by SC-560. Pio, ATV, and Pio + ATV increased the expression and activity of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) and COX-2. ATV increased phosphorylated-Akt, phosphorylated-endothelial NOS (P-eNOS), inducible NOS, and COX-2 levels. In contrast, Pio caused an insignificant increase in myocardial levels of phosphorylated-Akt but did not change P-eNOS and iNOS expression. In conclusion, the IS-limiting effects of Pio and ATV involve COX-2. However, the upstream steps differ. ATV induced eNOS phosphorylation and iNOS, cPLA2, and COX-2 expression, whereas Pio induced mainly the expression and activity of cPLA2. The effects of Pio and ATV were additive.", 
    "49": "Guidelines for the management of cardiovascular disease (CVD) stress the importance of treating global risk, rather than individual risk, factors. Patients at high cardiovascular (CV) risk, for example, benefit from a combination of aspirin, antihypertensive agents, lipid-lowering drugs, and possibly folic acid. As the number of medications that a patient requires increases, adherence and compliance to therapy are likely to decrease. The use of affordable, multiple-target, fixed-combination 'polypills', which concomitantly reduce multiple risk factors without increasing the pill burden or the risk of adverse effects, has the potential to improve CV risk factor management, thereby reducing the incidence of CVD. This review discusses the benefits of the polypill and the challenges and requirements for its success and registerability. Discussions with regulatory bodies are required in order to obtain some 'balance' between an overcautious registration approach and the potentially large public health benefits that are likely to arise from the use of polypills.", 
    "50": "Flow cytometric T-cell analysis is capable of adding valuable information for balancing immunosuppression in transplant recipients as it can take into account individual effects of immunosuppressive drugs on each patient as well as effects of other drugs which may modify the overall immunosuppression. Studies suggest that HMG-CoA-reductase-inhibitors (statins) reduce the frequency of organ rejection, although the precise mechanism of this effect is unknown. We therefore evaluated the effect of fluvastatin on size and activation of T-cell subpopulations and NK-cell activity in renal transplant recipients. At baseline, the population size of activated (HLA-DR+) T-cells was negatively correlated to serum HDL cholesterol suggesting an increased T-cell activation at low HDL levels. Fluvastatin treatment of a hypercholesterolemic group of patients for two months significantly decreased the LDL cholesterol. A longitudinal analysis revealed a relative increase in non-MHC restricted cytotoxic T-cells (CD3+/CD16+ or CD56+) over time which was significantly attenuated in fluvastatin treated patients but not in normocholesterolemic controls. Moreover, a relative decrease of activated MHC class I-restricted cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells was only observed upon fluvastatin treatment. NK-cell number and activity did not differ between groups. In summary, fluvastatin treatment of hypercholesterolemic renal transplant recipients is associated with a specific modulation of T-cells exerting cytotoxic effector functions.", 
    "51": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaric aciduria is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder that affects ketogenesis and leucine metabolism. The disease is caused by mutations in the gene coding for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A lyase (HL). To date 26 different mutations have been described. A (betaalpha)(8) TIM barrel structure has been proposed for the protein, and almost all missense mutations identified so far localize in the beta sheets that define the inside cavity. We report an Italian patient who bears homozygously a novel HL mutation, c.608G > A (p. G203E) in beta sheet six. A structural model of the mutated protein suggests that glutamic acid 203 impedes catalysis by blocking the entrance to the inner cavity of the enzyme. Loss of functionality has been confirmed in expression studies in E. coli, which demonstrate that the G203E mutation completely abolishes enzyme activity. Beta sheet six and beta sheet two are the two protein regions that accumulate most missense mutations, indicating their importance in enzyme functionality. A model for the mechanism of enzyme function is proposed.",

The development of arteriovenous fistula thrombosis is associated with vascular intimal hyperplasia. Some studies suggested that serum C-reactive protein (CRP) predicts the development of vascular intima hyperplasia that conduces vascular access stenosis and thrombosis. This study aimed to access the clinical usefulness of CRP in predicting VAT in hemodialysis patients.", 
    "53": "We retrospectively reviewed all prevalent hemodialysis patients with native arteriovenous fistula (nAVF) between November 2001 and November 2004. The CRP levels and relation to the development of VAT was analyzed with Kaplan-Meier analysis in four groups of patients divided according to their serum CRP levels. Besides serum CRP levels, other factors possibly influencing vascular access thrombosis were also considered: gender, age, diabetes, aspirin, smoking, statin, serum albumin, hematocrit, cholesterol > 200 mg/dl, Calcium-phosphate product, and intact parathyroid hormone > 200 pg/ml.", 
    "54": "We retrospectively reviewed 223 chronic hemodialysis patients. 198 patients with forearm nAVF and 25 with upper arm nAVF were included. Of the above 223 patients, 51 experienced one or more VAT episodes. In Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, patients with serum CRP levels > 0.8 mg/dl were prone to develop VAT (log-rank, p < 0.001). In a multivariate Cox regression model, serum CRP greater than 0.8 mg/dl was confirmed to be an independent predictor of VAT with a relative risk of 16.6 times (95% CI, 7.85-35.1). The area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve of CRP > 0.8 mg/dl in predicting VAT events is 0.785 (95% CI, 0.712-0.858; p < 0.001). Sensitivity and specificity of CRP (> 0.8 mg/dl) in predicting VAT were 80.4 and 72.7%.",

    "56": "Gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumours (NET) represent a heterogeneous tumour entity. The anti-neoplastic therapy of advanced NET disease is still unsatisfactory and innovative therapeutic approaches are needed. As NET frequently express insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) and their receptors (IGFR), known to promote survival, oncogenic transformation, tumour growth and spreading, the inhibition of the IGF/IGF-receptor system may offer possibilities for novel targeted treatment strategies of NET. Here, we studied the anti-neoplastic effects of an inhibition of the IGF-I receptor (IGF-1R) signalling in NET cells by the novel IGF-1R tyrosine kinase (TK) inhibitor NVP-AEW541, whose anti-neoplastic potency has not yet been tested in NET disease. Using two human NET cell lines with different growth characteristics, we demonstrated that NVP-AEW541 dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation of NET cells by inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Anti-neoplastic effects of NVP-AEW541 were also detected in primary cultures of human neuroendocrine gastrointestinal tumours. Apoptosis was characterized by activation of the apoptotic key enzyme, caspase-3, as well as by detection of changes in the expression of the pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins, BAX and Bcl-2, after NVP-AEW541 treatment. Cell cycle was arrested at the G1/S checkpoint. The anti-neoplastic effects of NVP-AEW541 involved the inactivation of ERK1/2. Induction of immediate cytotoxicity did not account for the anti-neoplastic effects of NVP-AEW541, as shown by measurement of lactate dehydrogenase release. Moreover, additive anti-neoplastic effects were observed when NVP-AEW541 was combined with cytostatics such as doxorubicin or the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, fluvastatin. This is the first report on the induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest by the IGF-1R-TK inhibitor, NVP-AEW541, in NET cells. The inhibition of the IGF/IGFR system appears to be a promising novel approach for future treatment strategies of NET disease.", 
    "57": "A comparison of different fractions of the fruit of Hyphaene thebaica (Doum) was performed in order to investigate their effects on serum cholesterol, triglycerides and lipoproteins: HDL (high density lipoprotein) cholesterol and Non-HDL cholesterol in normal rats. Female Sprague-Dawely rats were treated orally with different fractions of the Doum plant. We used atorvastatin and a natural extract of Monascus purpureus as references. The total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, Non-HDL cholesterol and triglycerides were estimated. Three fractions of the Doum plant exhibited a highly significant decrease in serum cholesterol and Non-HDL cholesterol. One fraction exhibited a highly significant decrease in cholesterol level but with only a moderately significant effect in decreasing the Non-HDL level. Decreasing Non-HDL, especially LDL, cholesterol, can reduce the risk of atherosclerosis and subsequent cardiovascular diseases. The natural, safe and non-toxic Doum plant could be of great merit for use as a hypocholesterolemic drug.", 
    "58": "The logistic transformation, originally suggested by Johnson (1949), is applied to analyze responses that are restricted to a finite interval (e.g. (0,1)), so-called bounded outcome scores. Bounded outcome scores often have a non-standard distribution, e.g. J- or U-shaped, precluding classical parametric statistical approaches for analysis. Applying the logistic transformation on a normally distributed random variable, gives rise to a logit-normal (LN) distribution. This distribution can take a variety of shapes on (0,1). Further, the model can be extended to correct for (baseline) covariates. Therefore, the method could be useful for comparative clinical trials. Bounded outcomes can be found in many research areas, e.g. drug compliance research, quality-of-life studies, and pain (and pain relief) studies using visual analog scores, but all these scores can attain the boundary values 0 or 1. A natural extension of the above approach is therefore to assume a latent score on 0,1) having a LN distribution. Two cases are considered: (a) the bounded outcome score is a proportion where the true probabilities have a LN distribution on (0,1) and (b) the bounded outcome score on [0,1] is a coarsened version of a latent score with a LN distribution on (0,1). We also allow the variance (on the transformed scale) to depend on treatment. The usefulness of our approach for comparative clinical trials will be assessed in this paper. It turns out to be important to distinguish the case of equal and unequal variances. For a bounded outcome score of the second type and with equal variances, our approach comes close to ordinal probit (OP) regression. However, ignoring the inequality of variances can lead to highly biased parameter estimates. A simulation study compares the performance of our approach with the two-sample Wilcoxon test and with OP regression. Finally, the different methods are illustrated on two data sets.", 
    "59": "Patients at high risk for coronary heart disease usually have a number of atherosclerotic plaques in their coronary arteries. Some plaques grow inward and, once they have caused a critical degree of luminal stenosis, lead to chronic anginal symptoms. Other plaques grow outward and remain silent unless they disrupt and trigger an acute coronary event. Either type of plaque may become vulnerable to rupture or erosion once they have reached an advanced stage. Typically, a highly stenotic fibrotic plaque is prone to erosion, whereas an advanced lipid-rich thin-cap fibroatheroma is prone to rupture. Because of the multitude and complex nature of the coronary lesions and our inability to detect silent rupture-prone plaques, the best practical approach to prevent acute coronary events is to treat the vulnerable patient, i.e., to eliminate the risk factors of coronary disease. Despite such preventive measures, a sizable number of patients still experience acute coronary events due to plaque erosion or rupture. Thus, there is room for new avenues to pharmacologically stabilize vulnerable plaques. The development of new noninvasive tools to detect the progression and regression of individual non-stenotic rupture-prone plaques will allow testing of such novel pharmacotherapies. Because no specific plaque-targeted therapies are available at present, we give an overview of the current pharmacotherapy to treat the vulnerable patient and also discuss potential novel therapies to prevent acute coronary events.", 
    "60": "Contrary to popular opinion, atherosclerosis is not a disease unique to modern civilization. In fact, atherosclerotic lesions have been found in the arteries of mummies dating back to 1,500 B.C., and yet our understanding of this complex process is still evolving. A fusion of basic science advances and clinical research findings has radically altered our traditional concepts about the pathogenesis and treatment of the clinical complications of atherosclerosis. Most physicians previously regarded the artery as a being merely a blood conduit that became encrusted with lipid detritus as part of the aging process. Modern-day treatment of atherosclerosis has arisen primarily from an understanding of the epidemiology of the disease rather than its pathophysiology, in that risk factors have traditionally been targeted. Our concepts of atherogenesis have evolved from vague ideas of inevitable degeneration to a much better defined scenario of molecular and cellular events. As we enhance our understanding of its fundamental mechanism, we can begin to approach atherogenesis as a modifiable rather than ineluctable process. Indeed, as we recognize now that inflammation plays a pivotal role in the process of atherosclerosis, it is noteworthy to evaluate the effect of modern therapies on this facet of the disease.", 
    "61": "Several drugs or pharmacologically active molecules such as statins, calcium antagonists, and PPAR agonists have been shown to affect macrophage functions that contribute to atherosclerosis and modulate plaque stability. For example, the modulation of matrix metalloproteinase secretion and cholesterol metabolism in macrophages may help to prevent cardiovascular disease independently of the correction of risk factors.", 
    "62": "The vascular endothelium synthesizes and releases a spectrum of vasoactive substances and therefore plays a fundamental role in the basal and dynamic regulation of the circulation. Nitric oxide (NO)--originally described as endothelium-derived relaxing factor--is released from endothelial cells in response to shear stress produced by blood flow, and in response to activation of a variety of receptors. After diffusion from endothelial to vascular smooth muscle cells, NO increases intracellular cyclic guanosine-monophosphat concentrations by activation of the enzyme guanylate cyclase leading to relaxation of the smooth muscle cells. NO has also antithrombogenic, antiproliferative, leukocyte-adhesion inhibiting effects, and influences myocardial contractility. Endothelium-derived NO-mediated vascular relaxation is impaired in spontaneously hypertensive animals. NO decomposition by free oxygen radicals is a major mechanism of impaired NO bioavailability. The resulting imbalance of endothelium-derived relaxing and contracting substances disturbs the nor- mal function of the vascular endothelium. Endothelin acts as the natural counterpart to endothelium-derived NO. In man, besides its effect of increasing arterial blood pressure, ET-1 induces vascular and myocardial hypertrophy, which are independent risk factors for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Current therapeutic strategies concentrate mainly on lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and an impressive reduction in the risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has been achieved. Inflammatory mechanisms play an important role in vascular disease and inflammatory plasma markers correlate with prognosis. Novel therapeutic strategies specifically targeting inflammation thus bear great potential for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic vascular disease.", 
    "63": "Low high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (C) is an important risk factor for coronary heart disease. In vitro, HDL exerts several potentially anti-atherogenic effects including reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) from peripheral cells to the liver. Hence, raising HDL-C has become an interesting target for anti-atherosclerotic drug therapy. Levels of HDL-C and the composition of HDL subclasses in plasma are regulated by apolipoproteins, lipolytic enzymes, lipid transfer proteins, receptors, and cellular transporters. The interplay of these factors leads to RCT and determines the composition and thereby the anti-atherogenic properties of HDL. Recent findings suggest that the mechanism of HDL modification rather than a sole increase in HDL-C determines the efficacy of anti-atherosclerotic drug therapy. In several controlled and prospective intervention studies, patients with low HDL-C and additional risk factors benefited from treatment with fibrates or statins. However, in only some of the fibrate trials was prevention of coronary events in patients with low HDL-C and hypertriglyceridaemia related to an increase in HDL-C. This may be because currently available drugs increase HDL-C levels only moderately and because HDL levels per se do not necessarily correlate with the functionality of HDL. However, several novel targets to modify RCT have emerged from the recent understanding of HDL synthesis, maturation and catabolism. The four major targets for an anti-atherogenic strategy in HDL metabolism include stimulation of apoA-I synthesis and secretion, the stimulation of ABCA1 expression, the inhibition of cholesterol ester transfer protein, and the up-regulation of scavenger receptor BI. These and other modulations of HDL metabolism are thought to result in improved RCT making them attractive targets for the development of new regimens of anti-atherogenic drug therapy.", 
    "64": "Long- and short-term trials with the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) have demonstrated significant reductions in cardiovascular events in patients with and without history of coronary heart disease. Statins are well-established low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-lowering agents, but their clinical benefit is believed to result from a number of lipid and non-lipid effects beyond LDL lowering, including a rise in plasma high-density lipoprotein levels. Beyond improving the lipid profile, statins have additional non-lipid effects including benefit on endothelial function, inflammatory mediators, intima-media thickening, prothombotic factors that ultimately result in plaque stabilization. These effects arise through the inhibition of several mevalonate-derived metabolites other than cholesterol itself, which are involved in the control of different cellular functions. Although statins represent the gold standard in the prevention and treatment of coronary heart disease, combination therapy with other lipid-lowering drugs, as well as novel therapeutic indications, may increase their therapeutic potential.", 
    "65": "The expanding market of 'functional foods' containing plant sterols and stanols has focused interest on their cholesterol-lowering effects as well on possible adverse effects. Trials of cholesterol lowering demonstrate that intake of 2 g/day of plant sterols and stanols reduces serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations by approximately 10%. Safety concerns regarding elevations in serum plant sterol levels, or effects on fat-soluble vitamin absorption or hypothetical effects on serum sex hormone balance have received attention and been addressed in studies. Plant sterol (but not stanol) supplementation increased serum plant sterol concentrations but these levels remained much lower than those observed in homozygous sitosterolemia making an adverse health effect unlikely. Prolonged statin therapy also causes elevations in all cholesterol-adjusted plant sterol levels as well as small but significant elevations in serum unadjusted campesterol levels from baseline. This is probably caused by a statin-induced reduction in biliary cholesterol efflux resulting in a diminished intestinal cholesterol pool. The diminished competition with cholesterol molecules allows more plant sterol molecules to become incorporated in mixed micelles facilitating their uptake in enterocytes. With the exception of beta-carotene, reductions in serum concentrations of fat-soluble (pro)vitamins are usually abolished by adjustment for cholesterol suggesting that they reflect reductions in carrier lipoproteins, mainly LDL. The small reductions in serum beta-carotene are not regarded as a major concern, nor have any adverse effects on sex hormone metabolism been demonstrated apart from parenteral administration of large doses in experimental animals. However, as increasing consumer populations become exposed to a large variety of food products enriched with plant sterols and stanols the likelihood of rare adverse effects increases and surveillance is necessary.", 
    "66": "As nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) is essential for promoting inflammation-associated cancer, it is a potential target for cancer prevention in chronic inflammatory diseases. Here we examined the anti-inflammatory effect of pitavastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, on NF-kappaB activated by TNF-alpha in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Western blot revealed that the treatment of Huh 7 cells with pitavastatin at 0.1 microM inhibited the nuclear expression of NF-kappaB p65 induced by TNF-alpha. Furthermore, electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that after the cells were incubated with pitavastatin alone or with pitavastatin and TNF-alpha for 24 h, pitavastatin significantly decreased the DNA binding activity of NF-kappaB induced by TNF-alpha. Subsequently, luciferase assay revealed that pitavastatin suppressed the transcriptional activity of the NF-kappaB promoter, which was clearly related to the HMG-CoA reductase activity because the addition of mevalonic acid (MEV) elevated the TNF-alpha activity. Moreover, the Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632 had no major effect on the NF-kappaB inhibitory activity of pitavastatin. The inhibitory effect of pitavastatin is possibly independent of the Rho kinase pathway in inflammation-associated HCC cells is. Finally, the addition of TNF-alpha significantly increased IL-6 protein production, which was suppressed by the addition of pitavastatin. These results suggest that pitavastatin at a low dose (0.1 microM) inhibits NF-kappaB activation and decreases IL-6 production induced by TNF-alpha, and is therefore expected to be a new strategy for treating HCC.", 
    "67": "It has already been demonstrated that pitavastatin, a novel potent HMG-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, is taken up into human hepatocytes mainly by organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1. Because OATP2B1 is also localized in the basolateral membrane of human liver, we took two approaches to further confirm the minor contribution of OATP2B1 to the hepatic uptake of pitavastatin. Western blot analysis revealed that the ratio of the band density of OATP2B1 in human hepatocytes to that in our expression system is at least 6-fold lower compared with OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. The uptake of pitavastatin in human hepatocytes could be inhibited by both estrone-3-sulfate (OATP1B1/OATP2B1 inhibitor) and estradiol-17beta-D-glucuronide (OATP1B1/OATP1B3 inhibitor). These results further supported the idea that OATP1B1 is a predominant transporter for the hepatic uptake of pitavastatin. Then, to explore the possibility of OATP1B1-mediated drug-drug interaction, we checked the inhibitory effects of various drugs on the pitavastatin uptake in OATP1B1-expressing cells and evaluated whether the in vitro inhibition was clinically significant or not. As we previously reported, we used the methodology for estimating the maximum unbound concentration of inhibitors at the inlet to the liver (I(u,in,max)). Judging from I(u,in,max) and inhibition constant (K(i)) for OATP1B1, several drugs (especially cyclosporin A, rifampicin, rifamycin SV, clarithromycin, and indinavir) have potentials for interacting with OATP1B1-mediated uptake of pitavastatin. The in vitro experiments could support the clinically observed drug-drug interaction between pitavastatin and cyclosporin A. These results suggest that we should pay attention to the concomitant use of some drugs with pitavastatin.",

Regression of coronary stenosis was dependent on the effect of therapy (P < 0.001), genetic form of dyslipidaemia (P = 0.004) and the interaction between the two variables (P = 0.02). Significant regression of coronary stenosis occurred only in FCHL and Lp(a) (P = 0.03, vs. control groups); CAD progression was only slowed in FH.",

At that point, for the first time, decreasing blood cholesterol levels became an official national public health goal. Still, only a small fraction of patients at high risk were getting appropriate cholesterol-lowering treatment, and a number of important clinical questions remained unanswered.

    "72": "Total joint arthroplasty is very effective for improving the quality of life of patients with end-stage arthritis. Despite advances in materials, surgical technique, and rehabilitation regimens, joint replacements are still fraught with complications leading to their premature failure. Aseptic loosening and osteolysis are the primary causes of implant failure. Other reasons include early migration of components leading to instability, lack of ingrowth into implant porosities, and bone loss caused by stress shielding. Pharmaceutical agents used for preventing and managing postmenopausal osteoporosis (eg, bisphosphonates) may in the future play an important role in improving the long-term duration of joint arthroplasties. Early findings indicate that bisphosphonates upregulate bone morphogenetic protein-2 production and stimulate new bone formation. Because of their anabolic effect on osteoblasts, bisphosphonates have the potential to enhance bone ingrowth into implant porosities, prevent bone resorption under adverse conditions, and dramatically extend the long-term durability of joint arthroplasties. The long-term effects of bisphosphonate use on the mechanical properties of bone have not been adequately investigated. Along with improvements in implant design and material properties, bisphosphonates and other pharmaceutical agents may, in the near future, be part of the growing armamentarium that provides more durable joint arthroplasties.",

Twenty-eight patients with non-stenotic ruptured plaques underwent baseline and 12-month follow-up IVUS studies; half were treated with statins. Standard IVUS analyses were performed. Complete healing of ruptured plaques was observed in four (29%) statin-treated patients and no non-statin-treated patients (p=0.049). Statin-treated patients had an increase in lumen area of 0.4+/-0.8 mm2 (versus a decrease in lumen area of -0.6+/-1.0 mm2 in non-statin-treated patients, p=0.007) and no change in plaque area (versus an increase in plaque area of 0.6+/-0.9 mm2, p=0.051). During 1-year follow-up, target lesion revascularization was performed in three non-statin-treated patients (21%) and no statin-treated patient (p=0.11). Compared to lesions that did not require revascularization, lesions requiring revascularization had a decrease in lumen area (-1.7+/-1.4 mm2 versus 0.1+/-0.8 mm2, p=0.001) as well as an increase in plaque area (1.6+/-1.0 mm2 versus 0.1+/-0.7 mm2, p=0.002). In conclusion, the current observational follow-up IVUS study showed beneficial effects of statin treatment on reduction of revascularization rates and stabilization of non-culprit/non-target lesion plaque ruptures without significant stenosis. Conversely, healing of non-statin-treated non-culprit/non-target lesion plaque ruptures can be responsible for lesion progression requiring revascularization.", 
    "79": "The Statin Safety Assessment Conference of the National Lipid Association (NLA), reported in this supplement to The American Journal of Cardiology, provides a comprehensive evaluation of old and new experience on adverse events associated with the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, or statins. To place these in context, one can express both the risk of side effects and the benefits for cardiovascular disease in terms of events per person-year of statin treatment. The mortality risk from fatal rhabdomyolysis is approximately 0.3 per 100,000 person-years, and the risks of nonfatal rhabdomyolysis and of putative statin-attributable peripheral neuropathy are approximately 3 and 12 events, respectively, per 100,000 person-years. Reports of acute liver failure and acute or chronic kidney disease give lower rate estimates that, even when corrected for underreporting, are approximately equal to the background rates of these conditions in the general population, lending scant support for statin-attributable etiology. In contrast, the benefit of statin use is to avert several hundred deaths and several hundred cases each of heart and brain infarction per 100,000 person-years in appropriately treated high-risk patients. Although population estimates such as these are useful, they must be translated repeatedly to individual patient-provider encounters, where clinical skill and art must combine with scientific evidence. The continued publication of individual case reports and small randomized trials among groups of patients with potential side effects should be encouraged. Statins should not be used in situations where minimal benefit is expected, as safety data and risk-benefit analysis must be meshed with guidelines that help the clinician decide whom to treat and how aggressively to treat.", 
    "80": "This article summarizes the final conclusions of the National Lipid Association (NLA) Statin Safety Task Force, based on a review and independent research of New Drug Application (NDA) information, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) data, cohort and clinical trial results, and analysis of administrative claims database information and the assessment of its 4 Expert Panels, which focused on issues of statin safety with regard to liver, muscle, renal, and neurologic systems. Practical guidance in the form of recommendations to health professionals who manage the coronary artery disease risk of patients with statin therapy is provided.", 
    "81": "The National Lipid Association's (NLA) Statin Safety Task Force charged the Neurology Expert Panel with the task of reviewing the scientific evidence related to adverse effects with statins and providing assessments and advice regarding the safety of statins. The evidence included key adverse reaction statin literature identified via a Medline search by the Task Force and Panel members and the commissioned reviews and research presented in this supplement. Panel members were asked to use this evidence to independently form explicit answers to a series of questions posed by the Task Force. Panelists were asked to grade the type of literature and the confidence they had in it in forming their answers using prescribed scales. Panelists were encouraged to seek the highest level of evidence available to answer their questions and to concentrate on literature involving humans. In addition, the Neurology Expert Panel was asked to propose recommendations to regulatory authorities, health professionals, patients, researchers, and the pharmaceutical industry to address statin safety issues.", 
    "82": "Recently, concerns regarding potential adverse effects of the statins on the kidney have been raised. The Kidney Expert Panel of the National Lipid Association's (NLA) Safety Task Force, made up of 3 nephrologists, was convened to review all of the currently available evidence pertinent to determining whether statins cause kidney injury, independent of the known, rare mechanisms of rhabdomyolysis and allergic, drug-induced, interstitial nephritis. The Panel reviewed published and unpublished evidence and found none that suggested that statins, when used in doses currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), cause kidney injury.", 
    "83": "The purpose of the Liver Expert Panel was to provide advice to the National Lipid Association's (NLA) Safety Task Force in response to specific questions concerning liver-associated risks of statin therapy. The panel was composed of academic hepatologists with clinical and research interests in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, lipid metabolic disorders, and drug hepatotoxicity.", 
    "84": "The National Lipid Association's (NLA) Muscle Safety Expert Panel was charged with the duty of examining the definitions, causative factors, and management of statin myopathy. The Panel was asked to use its evidence-based findings to form recommendations in response to a series of specific questions posed by the Task Force. The panel was composed of a clinical cardiologist, an exercise physiologist and skeletal muscle expert, and an expert in preventive cardiology who also examined skeletal muscle complications of statin use.", 
    "85": "The large administrative databases of health plans contain information on drug-related medical adverse events (AE) and constitute an increasingly powerful tool for the assessment of drug safety. We conducted a retrospective observational study using an administrative managed care claims database covering 9 million members from diverse regions of the United States. Patients aged >or=18 years who received >or=2 prescriptions for lipid-lowering drugs between July 1, 2000 and December 1, 2004 were included in the study. Hospitalizations with diagnosis codes (International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification [ICD-9]) related to muscle, kidney, and liver were determined for patients exposed to 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins), fibrates, extended-release niacin, cholesterol absorption inhibitors, or statin combination therapy. A total of 473,343 patients contributed 490,988 person-years of monotherapy and 11,624 person-years of combination dyslipidemia therapy. Rates of hospitalization due to AEs in patients on monotherapy with currently available statins were similar, whereas the incidence of hospitalization for muscle disorders increased 6.7-fold with cerivastatin therapy. Patients who received a lipid-lowering medication with a concomitant cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitor had a 6-fold increased rate of muscle disorders, including rhabdomyolysis. Hypertension was associated with a 5-fold increase in both muscle and renal events, whereas patients with diabetes mellitus had a 2.5-fold increased risk of renal events. No hospitalized cases of the index AEs were observed in study subjects during the 6-month period before initiation of the lipid-lowering drug. Statin monotherapy as currently prescribed is generally well tolerated and safe.", 
    "86": "The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, or statin drugs, have been studied in numerous controlled human research trials involving hundreds of thousands of study participants. Statins have been prescribed for millions of patients. Based on this vast research and clinical experience, statins have been shown to improve lipid blood levels and reduce atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD) risk, resulting in reduced CAD morbidity and mortality, and in several studies, reduced overall (\"all-cause\") mortality. From a safety perspective, both research trial evidence and clinical practice experience have demonstrated that statins are generally well tolerated. However, as with all pharmaceuticals, safety considerations exist with both monotherapy and combination statin therapy, mainly involving potential adverse effects on muscle, liver, kidney, and the nervous system. The evidence supporting statin-related potential adverse experiences on these organ systems is sometimes strong and based on clear clinical trial evidence (such as the increased risk of muscle enzyme elevation with higher statin doses). The evidence is at other times more speculative, being based on case reports and inconclusive clinical trial data (such as possible favorable or unfavorable effects of statins on cognition). Because the use of statins is so widespread, it is useful for the clinician to understand statin safety issues and the level of available evidence supporting the contention that various adverse effects are caused by statins. This review presents an assessment of statin safety based on an overview of the current statin safety data and their clinical implications.", 
    "87": "A systematic review of cohort studies, randomized trials, voluntary notifications to national regulatory authorities, and published case reports was undertaken to assess the incidence and characteristics of adverse effects in patients treated with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, or statins. For statins other than cerivastatin, the incidence of rhabdomyolysis in 2 cohort studies was 3.4 (1.6 to 6.5) per 100,000 person-years, an estimate supported by data from 20 randomized controlled trials. Case fatality was 10%. Incidence was about 10 times greater when gemfibrozil was used in combination with statins. Incidence was higher (4.2 per 100,000 person-years) with lovastatin, simvastatin, or atorvastatin (which are oxidized by cytochrome P450 3A4 [CYP3A4], which is inhibited by many drugs) than pravastatin or fluvastatin (which are not oxidized by CYP3A4). In persons taking simvastatin, lovastatin, or atorvastatin, 60% of cases involved drugs known to inhibit CYP3A4 (especially erythromycin and azole antifungals), and 19% involved fibrates, principally gemfibrozil. The incidence of myopathy in patients treated with statins, estimated from cohort studies supported by randomized trials, was 11 per 100,000 person-years. For liver disease, randomized trials reported fewer hepatobiliary disorders in patients allocated statins than in those allocated placebo. The notification rate of liver failure to regulatory authorities was about 1 per million person-years of statin use. Randomized trials show no excess of renal disease or proteinuria in statin-allocated participants, and the decline in glomerular filtration rate was smaller with statins than with placebo. Evidence from 4 cohort studies and case reports suggests that statins cause peripheral neuropathy, but the attributable risk is small (12 per 100,000 person-years). No change in cognitive function was found in randomized trials of statins in elderly patients.", 
    "88": "Safety has become a central issue in the management of dyslipidemia with statins. A review of New Drug Applications (NDAs) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Web site was conducted for all 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, or statins, with a major focus on cerivastatin and rosuvastatin. The findings provide insight into the incidence of adverse events for this class of drugs and support the significant benefits of statins relative to associated risks. These data delineate the nature of statin associated liver, muscle, and renal adverse events. Although transaminase levels increase in a dose-related fashion with statins, a definitive correlation between statin therapy and hepatotoxicity is not supported by statin NDA data. Statin-induced myopathy is a relatively rare event (1 in 1,000) and rhabdomyolysis is even rarer (1 in 10,000). The cerivastatin NDA, along with its supplementary NDA, was the first to demonstrate a clear statin dose-response relation with myopathy and a threshold effect above which myotoxicity increases significantly. Proteinuria was identified as a consequence of statin therapy with data from the rosuvastatin NDA, and subsequent analysis suggests a class effect that is dose related but transient. Studies in cell culture suggest the mechanism is a pharmacologic effect on the proximal renal tubule. The available evidence suggests no clear renal toxicity with currently approved statins, because no declines in renal function or glomerular filtration rate have been documented over time. Overall, currently marketed statins have a very favorable benefit-to-risk relation with respect to liver, muscle, and renal issues.", 
    "89": "The adverse event (AE) profiles of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor (statin) agents are of great interest, in particular the most recently approved statin, rosuvastatin. The forwarding of reports of AEs has been shown to be influenced by several reporting biases, including secular trend, the new drug reporting effect, product withdrawals, and publicity. Comparative assessments that use AE reporting rates are difficult to interpret under these circumstances, because such effects can themselves lead to marked increases in AE reporting. Consequently, many comparative reporting rate analyses are best carried out in conjunction with other metrics that put reporting burden into context, such as report proportion. All-AE reporting rates showed a temporal profile that resembled those of other statins when marketing cycle and secular trend were taken into account. A before-and-after cerivastatin withdrawal comparison showed a substantial increase in the reporting of AEs of interest for the statin class overall. Report proportion analyses indicated that the burden of rosuvastatin-associated AEs was similar to that for other statin agents. Analyses of monthly reporting rates showed that the reporting of rosuvastatin-associated rhabdomyolysis and renal failure have increased following AE-specific mass media publicity. Postrosuvastatin AE reporting patterns were comparable to those seen with other statins and did not resemble cerivastatin.", 
    "90": "Available for almost 2 decades, the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, or statins, have emerged at the forefront of preventive drugs for cardiovascular disease because of a substantial clinical trial database demonstrating that statins reduce the risk for coronary artery disease morbidity and death across a broad range of at-risk patient cohorts. Although generally well tolerated, statins may be associated with infrequent adverse events that warrant serious and frank discussion, including myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. In 2005, the National Lipid Association (NLA), a multidisciplinary, nonprofit association of healthcare providers and researchers in the lipid field, convened a Safety Task Force to undertake an intensive, fair-minded evaluation of available data on the effects of statins on muscle, liver, kidneys, and the brain. In the end, physicians and patients must weigh the potential clinical benefits of statin treatment against the potential risks when deciding whether to initiate treatment.", 
    "91": "The risks of muscle adverse events related to use of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, or statins, increase significantly with the addition of interacting drugs to a patient's therapy. The mechanism for most statin drug interactions involves the cytochrome P-450 system, which provides an indication of which drugs may interact. However, it is difficult to predict the probability of a drug interaction in a given patient because there are individual differences in sensitivity to increased statin drug levels. Drug metabolism studies show simvastatin and lovastatin to be especially sensitive to the inhibiting effects of other drugs on the cytochrome P-450 3A4 (CYP3A4) isoenzyme. Atorvastatin metabolism is less affected by inhibitors of this isoenzyme. Case reports, postmarketing surveillance, and clinical trial data demonstrate the clinical effect of CYP3A4 inhibitors on statins. Also, through possible inhibition of statin biliary excretion and glucuronidation, gemfibrozil given concomitantly with rosuvastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin significantly increases the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, a potentially life-threatening consequence of statin drug interactions.", 
    "92": "Acute renal failure (ARF) is a common cause of mortality and morbidity in hospitalized patients. Ischemia is an important cause of ARF, and ARF caused by ischemic injury is referred to as ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN). There is growing evidence from models that ischemic ATN is associated with intrarenal inflammation. Consequently, intrarenal inflammation is an attractive target for the development of novel drug therapies for ARF. This review outlines ischemic ATN models, the pathophysiological roles of inflammatory cells such as T and B cells in ischemic ATN models, and effective T and B cell therapeutic reagents.", 
    "93": "Our objective was to compare simvastatin with the validated probe midazolam in the assessment of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A activity.", 
    "94": "This study used an open-label, fixed-sequential, 3-way crossover study design. Nineteen subjects received oral doses of 0.075 mg/kg midazolam and 40 mg simvastatin during 3 phases (baseline, after inhibition with 400 mg ketoconazole for 10 days, and after induction with 600 mg rifampin [INN, rifampicin] for 9 days). Serial plasma concentrations of midazolam and simvastatin were obtained. Oral clearances of midazolam and simvastatin were compared.", 
    "95": "Oral midazolam clearance decreased after pretreatment with ketoconazole (from a geometric mean of 25 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1) [range, 12-57 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1)] to 2.7 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1) [range, 1.2-8.5 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1)], P < .001) and increased after pretreatment with rifampin (to a geometric mean of 203 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1) [range, 125-371 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1)], P < .001). Oral simvastatin clearance decreased after ketoconazole (from a geometric mean of 312 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1) [range, 151-1478 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1)] to 25 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1) [range, 8.0-147 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1)], P < .001) and increased after rifampin (to a geometric mean of 3536 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1) [range, 413-10,329 mL x min(-1) x kg(-1)], P < .001). The change in simvastatin clearance was highly variable from baseline to inhibition (6- to 33-fold decrease) and from baseline to induction (2- to 39-fold increase) compared with midazolam (7- to 18-fold decrease during inhibition and 4- to 12-fold increase during induction). Midazolam and simvastatin oral clearances were correlated for all study phases (r = 0.5 and P = .03 for baseline and r = 0.53 and P = .02 for inhibition) but were weakest for induction (r = -0.031, P = .22). The area under the concentration-time curve inhibitory ratio for midazolam was 9.4 versus 12.4 for simvastatin (r = 0.3, P = .03).",

In this paper, a number of potential targets for modifying mast cell activation in asthma are reviewed. Some are already under study, including clinical trials (eg, tryptase inhibitors); others are more speculative (eg, inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity).

    "107": "Cultured dermal fibroblasts from 3 patients with diffuse systemic sclerosis of recent onset were treated with 5 microM and 10 microM of simvastatin for 3 or 4 days. Morphologic features, cytotoxicity, and type I collagen production and messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in the fibroblasts were examined. The effects of mevalonate, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), and farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), which are lipids downstream from the hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A block, were also examined. Transient transfections with COL1A1 promoter-reporter constructs and electrophoretic gel mobility shift assays were utilized to examine COL1A1 transcription and Sp1 and CCAAT-box binding factor (CBF) binding.", 
    "108": "Simvastatin did not cause morphologic changes or cytotoxicity in the fibroblasts, even after 4 days of treatment. Type I collagen production and mRNA levels showed a potent and dose-related inhibition following 3 and 4 days of treatment. The inhibition of collagen gene expression by simvastatin was completely reversed by mevalonate and GGPP, but not by FPP. The statin effects occurred at the transcriptional level and involved the proximal COL1A1 promoter region encompassing -174 bp. A significant reduction in Sp1 and CBF binding activity was also found in simvastatin-treated cells.", 
    "109": "Simvastatin is a powerful inhibitor of type I collagen gene expression in normal and systemic sclerosis fibroblasts. The pleiotropic protective effects of statins on various endothelial and immune cell functions in conjunction with their potent inhibitory effects on type I collagen gene expression suggest that statins may be effective therapeutic agents in systemic sclerosis.", 
    "110": "The possible role of statins in cancer is controversial. Indeed, among the multiplicity of biological effects ascribed to these widely used cholesterol lowering agents some could, at least in theory, inhibit tumor growth (e.g. by inhibiting Ras oncoproteins), while other actions are inert, or may even stimulate cancer aggressiveness (e.g. through promoting neovascularization). In order to address some of these controversies, we set out to compare the effects of statins on growth of cancer and endothelial cells in vitro, to the impact of these drugs on angiogenesis-dependent expansion of the corresponding tumors in vivo. Water-soluble fluvastatin was used at concentrations (0-800 ng/ml) against human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), and several well-characterized cancer cell lines in culture, including: carcinoma (LLC), melanoma (B16F1) and fibrosarcoma driven by mutant H-ras (528ras1). Endpoints were based on 3H-thymidine incorporation assay, cell morphology and tumorigenicity in mice. The growth inhibitory effects of fluvastatin varied among cancer cell lines (LLC>B16F1>528ras1), irrespectively of their mutant H-ras status. Fluvastatin also blocked the action of angiogenic factors on cultured endothelial cells, but was relatively ineffective against highly angiogenic and aggressive tumors both in young mice (6-8 weeks), and in less aggressively growing tumors in aged (80-90 weeks) mice. Thus, antitumor and antiangiogenic activity of fluvastatin in vitro is not recapitulated in vivo. Tumors may display a form of resistance to statins through a mechanism operative only in vivo.", 
    "111": "Immortalized cell lines offer significant logistical advantages over primary cells when used for in-vitro studies. Immortalized cells may, however, exhibit important differences relative to their primary cell counterparts. In this study, microarrays were used to make a genome-wide comparison between primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and EA.hy926, an immortalized HUVEC cell line, in their baseline properties and in their response to inhibition of the mevalonate pathway with an inhibitor of hydroxy methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (statin). HUVECs and EA.hy926 were incubated with control medium, atorvastatin, mevalonate, or a combination of atorvastatin and mevalonate for 24 h. Gene expression profiles were obtained in duplicates using Affymetrix Human Genome U133A 2.0 arrays (Santa Clara, California, USA). Probe-sets were selected according to the following criteria: a twofold or greater increase/decrease in atorvastatin-treated cells compared with untreated cells; a twofold or greater reversal of the effect of atorvastatin by combined treatment with atorvastatin and mevalonate; no significant change in gene expression in cells treated with mevalonate alone compared with untreated cells. Most genes that were expressed by untreated HUVECs, were also expressed by untreated EA.hy926 cells. EA.hy926 cells, however, constitutively expressed a large number of additional genes, many of which were related to cell cycle control and apoptosis. Atorvastatin induced differential expression (> or = twofold) of 103 genes in HUVECs (10 up, 93 down) and 466 genes in EA.hy926 cells (198 up, 268 down). Applying the above selection criteria, thrombomodulin and tissue plasminogen activator were up-regulated in both cell types, whereas, connective tissue growth factor, thrombospondin-1, and cysteine-rich angiogenic inducer 61 were down-regulated. In conclusion, EA.hy926 cells retain most of the characteristics of endothelial cells under baseline conditions as well as after treatment with atorvastatin. It is necessary, however, to carefully select and validate changes in genes that are the focus of studies when using EA.hy926 cells. While this cell line is highly useful in studies on some genes, including genes encoding molecules involved in regulating thrombohemorrhagic homeostasis, they appear to be less suited for studies focused on other genes, particularly those involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and apoptosis.", 
    "112": "Rho family GTPases are key signal transducers that regulate cell adhesion and migration and a variety of other cellular responses, including changes in gene expression. In this review, we discuss how Rho GTPases regulate signaling by endothelial cell receptors involved in leukocyte extravasation. First, Rho GTPases affect the expression of some leukocyte adhesion molecules on endothelial cells, such as intracellular adhesion molecule-1 and E-selectin, that can be induced by proinflammatory mediators, hypoxia, or shear stress. Second, Rho GTPases are activated by engagement of several leukocyte adhesion receptors and contribute to both early morphological changes and subsequent alterations in gene expression. Rho GTPases are therefore candidate targets for inhibiting leukocyte transendothelial migration in heart disease and chronic inflammatory disorders.", 
    "113": "Over the last decade, the Rho family GTPases have gained considerable recognition as powerful regulators of actin cytoskeletal organization. As with many high profile signal transducers, these molecules soon attracted the attention of the cardiovascular research community. Shortly thereafter, two prominent members known as RhoA and Rac1 were linked to agonist-induced gene expression and myofilament organization using the isolated cardiomyocyte cell model. Subsequent creation of transgenic mouse lines provided evidence for more complex roles of RhoA and Rac1 signaling. Clues from in vitro and in vivo studies suggest the involvement of numerous downstream targets of RhoA and Rac1 signaling including serum response factor, NF-kappaB, and other transcription factors, myofilament proteins, ion channels, and reactive oxygen species generation. Which of these contribute to the observed phenotypic effects of enhanced RhoA and Rac activation in vivo remain to be determined. Current research efforts with a more translational focus have used statins or Rho kinase blockers to assess RhoA and Rac1 as targets for interventional approaches to blunt hypertrophy or heart failure. Generally, salutary effects on remodeling and ischemic damage are observed, but the broad specificity and multiple cellular targets for these drugs within the myocardium demands caution in interpretation. In this review, we assess the evolution of knowledge related to Rac1 and RhoA in the context of hypertrophy and heart failure and highlight the direction that future exploration will lead.", 
    "114": "Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibition with torcetrapib not only increases high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels but also significantly reduces plasma triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B (apoB) levels. The goal of the present study was to define the kinetic mechanism(s) by which CETP inhibition reduces levels of apoB-containing lipoproteins.", 
    "115": "Nineteen subjects, 9 of whom were pretreated with 20 mg atorvastatin, received placebo for 4 weeks, followed by 120 mg torcetrapib once daily for 4 weeks. Six subjects in the nonatorvastatin group received 120 mg torcetrapib twice daily for an additional 4 weeks. After each phase, subjects underwent a primed-constant infusion of deuterated leucine to endogenously label newly synthesized apoB to determine very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) and LDL apoB100 production, and fractional catabolic rates (FCRs). Once-daily 120 mg torcetrapib significantly reduced VLDL, IDL, and LDL apoB100 pool sizes by enhancing the FCR of apoB100 within each fraction. On a background of atorvastatin, 120 mg torcetrapib significantly reduced VLDL, IDL, and LDL apoB100 pool sizes. The reduction in VLDL apoB100 was associated with an enhanced apoB100 FCR, whereas the decreases in IDL and LDL apoB100 were associated with reduced apoB100 production.", 
    "116": "These data indicate that when used alone, torcetrapib reduces VLDL, IDL, and LDL apoB100 levels primarily by increasing the rate of apoB100 clearance.

MACE risk was doubled if serum creatinine was elevated by 141 micromol/l, age was increased by 23 years, or LDL-cholesterol by 2 mmol/l. Diabetes increased the incidences of cardiac death, all-cause mortality, MACE, stroke and non-fatal MI. A serum creatinine increase of approximately 130 micromol/l, or approximately 20 years increase in age was calculated as similar in risk for cardiac death, all-cause mortality and MACE, and comparable to risk of diabetes in RTR.",

    "121": "Innovative pharmacological approaches to raise anti-atherogenic high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) are currently of considerable interest, particularly in atherogenic dyslipidemias characterized by low levels of HDL-C, such as type 2 diabetes, the metabolic syndrome, and mixed dyslipidemia, but equally among individuals with or at elevated risk for premature cardiovascular disease (CVD). Epidemiological and observational studies first demonstrated that HDL-C was a strong, independent predictor of coronary heart disease (CHD) risk, and suggested that raising HDL-C levels might afford clinical benefit. Accumulating data from clinical trials of pharmacological agents that raise HDL-C levels have supported this concept. In addition to the pivotal role that HDL-C plays in reverse cholesterol transport and cellular cholesterol efflux, HDL particles possess a spectrum of anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, anti-apoptotic, anti-thrombotic, vasodilatory and anti-infectious properties, all of which potentially contribute to their atheroprotective nature. Significantly, anti-atherogenic properties of HDL particles are attenuated in common metabolic diseases that are characterized by subnormal HDL-C levels, such as type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Inhibition of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), a key player in cholesterol metabolism and transport, constitutes an innovative target for HDL-C raising. In lipid efficacy trials, 2 CETP inhibitors-JTT-705 and torcetrapib-induced marked elevation in HDL-C levels, with torcetrapib displaying greater efficacy. Moreover, both agents attenuate aortic atherosclerosis in cholesterol-fed rabbits. Clinical trial data demonstrating the clinical benefits of these drugs on atherosclerosis and CHD are eagerly awaited.", 
    "122": "Lowering serum cholesterol levels reduces the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD)-related events. Statins are commonly prescribed as first-line treatment but many patients at high-risk for CHD still fail to reach their cholesterol or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goals with statin monotherapy. National and international guidelines for the prevention of CHD recommend the modification of lipid profiles and particularly LDL-C [e.g. the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III; 2001) and Third Joint Task Force of European and other Societies on Cardiovascular Disease Prevention in Clinical Practice (2003) Guidelines]. Several recent clinical trials indicated an added benefit from aggressive lowering of LDL-C levels. Based on these findings, the NCEP ATP III revised the LDL-C target from < 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L) to < 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) (optional target) for very high-risk patients and < 130 mg/dL (3.4 mmol/L) to < 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L) for moderately high-risk patients. For patients who fail to achieve their LDL-C target, inhibiting the two main sources of cholesterol - synthesis and uptake - can produce more effective lipid lowering, allowing more patients to reach their LDL-C goal. Ezetimibe is a highly-selective inhibitor of cholesterol absorption and simvastatin is an evidence-based inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis. The LDL-C-lowering efficacy of targeting both major sources of cholesterol with ezetimibe plus simvastatin was demonstrated in several multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials in patients with hypercholesterolaemia. For patients who do not reach their cholesterol goal with a statin, adding ezetimibe 10 mg significantly reduces LDL-C compared with statin monotherapy. Thus, this treatment option may help patients reach the new 'stricter' cholesterol goals. This review, based on a Medline database search from January 2000 to August 2005, considers the LDL-C-lowering efficacy of ezetimibe and discusses the role of this agent for patients who fail to achieve guideline cholesterol goals with statin monotherapy.", 
    "123": "Epidemiological studies demonstrate a relationship between statin [3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor] usage and reduced risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. To determine whether statins affect neuronal development, we treated cultured rat hippocampal neurons with pravastatin. After 4-48 h of treatment, pravastatin significantly increased the number of neurites produced by each cell and caused a corresponding increase in levels of the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylcholine. Pravastatin treatment also significantly increased neurite length and branching but did not affect cellular cholesterol levels. Co-incubation with mevalonate, but not cholesterol, abolished the stimulatory effect of pravastatin on neurite outgrowth. Treatment of neurons with isoprenoids also abolished the effect of pravastatin on neurite growth, suggesting that pravastatin may stimulate neuritogenesis by preventing isoprenylation of signaling molecules such as the Rho family of small GTPases. A specific inhibitor of geranylgeranylation, but not farnesylation, mimicked the stimulatory effect of pravastatin on neuritogenesis. Pravastatin treatment significantly decreased levels of membrane-associated RhoA. These data suggest that pravastatin treatment increases neurite outgrowth and may do so via inhibiting the activity of geranylgeranylated proteins such as RhoA.", 
    "124": "Current theories of atherosclerotic plaque formation suggest that inflammation plays a key role in coronary heart disease. In an effort to augment current tools for cardiac risk assessment, researchers have found that levels of the inflammatory marker C-reactive protein (CRP) may play an important role in gauging an individual's risk for a cardiac event. While not currently recommended for mass population screening, measurement of CRP may play an increasing part in identifying at-risk patients and guiding pharmacologic intervention.", 
    "125": "An open-label, randomised, crossover single-dose study, using two periods, two sequences, with a minimum washout period of 7 days, was conducted in order to assess the comparative bioavailability of a pravastatin (CAS 81131-70-6) 40 mg formulation and that of a reference formulation. Blood samples were collected up to +14 h post dosing, the plasma was separated and pravastatin concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatographic method with tandem mass spectrometry detection (HPLC-MS/MS), with a lower limit of quantification of 0.40 ng/mL. Bioequivalence analyses were conducted using two models. The main analysis was done according to a general linear model (model I) using formulation, period and sequence as fixed model effects, and subject(sequence) and residual as random effects; gender-related differences were investigated using ANOVA (model II), including formulation, period, sequence, gender, sequence-by-gender interaction and gender-by-formulation interaction as fixed model effects and subject within sequence-by-gender interaction and residual as random effect. Mean values of the individual Cmax were 126.73 +/- 61.99 ng/mL and 123.52 +/- 52.78 ng/mL for the test and reference, spectively. Mean +/- SD total area under the curve up to the last measurable concentration (AUClast) was 224.26 +/- 104.74 ng x h/mL for the test formulation and 216.55 +/- 80.30 ng x h/mL for the reference formulation. Mean +/- SD total area under the curve (AUCinf) was 226.72 +/- 104.69 ng x h/mL for the test formulation and 218.81 +/- 79.95 ng x h/mL for the reference. Terminal elimination half-life was 2.15 +/- 0.85 h for test and 1.97 +/- 0.54 h for the reference. Ninety percent confidence intervals were comprised within the bioequivalence acceptance criteria (80-125 %) for all of the parameters analysed, both using model I and model II. Model II returned a statistically significant gender effect (p < 0.05) for Cmax, AUClast and AUCinf but the effect became non-significant (p > 0.05) when the dose was adjusted per body weight for all three parameters. The comparison between male and female mean body weight showed a significant difference: p = 0.03, 95 % confidence intervals 68.27-76.93 kg (men), 56.84-60.61 kg (women). These results suggest that the effect of gender in the bioequivalence analysis in model I could be due to a difference in body weight between males and females. Both formulations were shown to be bioequivalent in terms of rate and extent of absorption, irrespectively of the model used.", 
    "126": "The aim of this study was to examine the association between statin use before the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) symptoms and risk of having AD, and to explore the potential impact of APOE genotype and race on this association.", 
    "127": "Data were collected through standardized, validated questionnaires from 895 subjects with probable or definite AD by research criteria, and 1,483 of their nondemented relatives in this family-based, case-control study of AD patients and their relatives enrolled at 15 research centers from 1996 through 2002. To minimize temporal and prescription biases, exposure to statin use within each family was ignored in the one year before the first appearance of AD symptoms in that family's affected member. Associations were estimated using generalized estimating equations for a logistic model, adjusting for age, sex, race, education, history of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, smoking and APOE genotype.", 
    "128": "Statin use was associated with lowered odds of having AD (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 0.61; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.38 to 0.98). Nonstatin cholesterol-lowering medications were not associated significantly with lowered odds of having had AD (adjusted OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 0.61 to 5.0).", 
    "129": "Statin medications were associated with lowered risk of AD in this population. Neither African-American race, nor the presence of the APOE 4 allele modified the statin-AD association.", 
    "130": "According to the concept of apolipoprotein (apo)-defined lipoproteins, apoA-I-containing lipoproteins consist of two subclasses referred to as lipoprotein A-I (LpA-I) and lipoprotein A-I:A-II (LpA-I:A-II), and apoB-containing lipoproteins of five subclasses, namely lipoprotein B (LpB), lipoprotein B:C (LpB:C), lipoprotein B:E (LpB:E), lipoprotein B:C:E (LpB:C:E), and lipoprotein A-II:B:C:D:E (LpA-II:B:C:D:E). The purpose of this study was to determine the levels of apoA-I- and apoB-containing lipoprotein subclasses before and after fluvastatin treatment of patients with chronic renal insufficiency. ApoA-I- and apoB-containing lipoprotein subclasses were measured in 15 patients with chronic renal failure and 15 asymptomatic subjects. The effect of fluvastatin on lipoprotein subclasses was determined in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-way, treatment period crossover study. Patients were administered fluvastatin 40 mg/day or placebo during 8 weeks in a randomized order. Patients were characterized by significantly higher levels of LpB (P < 0.001), LpB:C (P < 0.001), and LpB:E (P < 0.05), and slightly higher levels of LpB:C:E and LpA-II:B:C:D:E than controls. The levels of LpA-I:A-II were significantly lower (P < 0.01) in patients than controls. Fluvastatin treatment reduced all apoB-containing subclasses, but only the reduced level of LpB subclass was statistically significant (P < 0.02). The levels of LpA-I and LpA-I:A-II were not affected. Fluvastatin treatment reduced and normalized LpB and LpB:E subclasses. Although slightly reduced, the levels of markedly atherogenic LpB:C subclass were not normalized. The potential role of LpB:C on the progression of coronary artery disease in chronic renal insufficiency remains to be determined in future studies.", 
    "131": "Endometriosis is characterized by ectopic growth of endometrial tissues. Statins, inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), have been shown to decrease proliferation of several mesenchymal tissues. Actions of statins may be related to decreased availability of cholesterol as well as intermediate metabolites of the mevalonate pathway downstream of HMGCR. This study was designed to evaluate effects of statins on growth of endometrial stromal cells and to investigate mechanisms of these effects. Human endometrial stromal cells were cultured in the absence and in the presence of serum and with or without mevastatin and simvastatin. DNA synthesis and viable cell numbers were determined. Effects of statins were also evaluated in the presence of mevalonate and squalene. Furthermore, effects on phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase 3/1 (MAPK3/1) (also known as extracellular signal-regulated kinase [ERK1/2]) were determined. Mevastatin and simvastatin induced a concentration-dependent inhibition of DNA synthesis and viable cell count in chemically defined media and in the presence of serum. Mevalonate, but not squalene, abrogated inhibitory effects of statins on cell proliferation. Statins inhibited MAPK3/1 phosphorylation. This is the first study demonstrating that statins inhibit growth of endometrial stromal cells. This effect is also demonstrable in the presence of a supply of cholesterol and may be related to decreased activation of MAPK3/1. The present observations may be relevant to potential therapeutic use of statins in conditions such as endometriosis.", 
    "132": "Akt is a critical regulator of cell growth, proliferation, and survival that is activated by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). We investigated the effect of PI3K inhibition on activation of sterol regulatory element binding protein-2 (SREBP-2), a master regulator of cholesterol homeostasis. SREBP-2 processing increased in response to various cholesterol depletion approaches (including statin treatment) and this increase was blunted by treatment with a potent and specific inhibitor of PI3K, LY294002, or when a plasmid encoding a dominant-negative form of Akt (DN-Akt) was expressed. LY294002 also suppressed SREBP-2 processing induced by insulin-like growth factor-1. Furthermore, LY294002 treatment down-regulated SREBP-2 or -1c gene targets and decreased cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis. Fluorescence microscopy studies indicated that LY294002 disrupts transport of the SREBP escort protein, SCAP, from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi. This disruption was also shown by immunofluorescence staining when DN-Akt was expressed. Taken together, our studies indicate that the PI3K/Akt pathway is involved in SREBP-2 transport to the Golgi, contributing to the control of SREBP-2 activation. Our results provide a crucial mechanistic link between the SREBP and PI3K/Akt pathways that may be reconciled teleologically because synthesis of new membrane is an absolute requirement for cell growth and proliferation.", 
    "133": "To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Taizhi'an (TZA) capsule combined with Simvastatin (Sim) in treating hyperlipidemia in diabetes mellitus (DM) patients.", 
    "134": "Eighty cases of type 2 DM patients with hyperlipidemia were randomized into two groups, 40 in each group. The patients in the treated group took orally TZA capsules at the dose of 0.9 g 3 times a day and Sim 10 mg at bedtime. And the patients in the control group were treated with Sim 20 mg alone at bedtime. Both regimens lasted for 12 weeks. Before and after the study the changes of blood lipid levels and adverse reaction were investigated.", 
    "135": "The serum levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG) and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) were decreased respectively by 28.8%, 18.2% and 26.3% in the treated group; and by 29.4%, 19.4% and 24.6% in the control group. On the contrary, high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) was increased by 23.5% in the treated group and by 29.4% in the control group. All these changes were statistically significant before and after treatment (all P < 0.05), but they did not differ statistically between the two groups (P > 0.05). There was no significant changes in hemoglobin A(1)c (HbA(1)c). Patients in the treated group did not develop any adverse reactions. However, ALT was found to be higher above the normal range in 5% of the patients in the control group.", 
    "136": "In treating hyperlipidemia in DM patients, combination of TZA with Sim 10 mg taken daily achieved satisfactory efficacy which was similar to Sim 20 mg daily alone. But the combination therapy conducted in the treated group proved to be better in safety, and could overcome adverse reactions resulting from Sim that was seen in the control group.", 
    "137": "Vascular endothelial cells of man and pig, but not rodents, strongly express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens in vivo, probably via the inducible promoter IV of the class II transactivator. There is abundant in vitro evidence that MHC class II positive vascular endothelial cells can activate T cells. Peripheral antigen presentation by endothelial cells is potentially important for organ-specific immunity, for allograft rejection, and possibly for immune responsiveness in general. Given the reported effects of statins on promoter IV of the class II transactivator, we evaluated in vivo expression of MHC class II antigens in pigs treated with atorvastatin calcium.", 
    "138": "Pigs were given 3 mg/kg/day of atorvastatin orally daily for 16 days, and then killed 24 hr after the last dose. Heart, kidney, and liver were removed for immunohistological and quantitative absorption analysis.", 
    "139": "Double-labeling studies using immunofluorescence on frozen section for Factor VIII and MHC class II showed a marked suppression of MHC class II on vascular endothelial cells in all 4 treated pigs, in comparison with untreated pigs. This was confirmed using immunoperoxidase techniques on frozen sections. Quantitative absorption analysis showed up to 25-fold reduction in MHC class II expression.", 
    "140": "Statins substantially suppress endothelial cell MHC class II expression in vivo. This is likely to inhibit organ-specific immune responses, and possibly also general immune responsiveness. In a transplantation setting, in addition to other regulatory effects on the recipients immune system, statins might reduce the long-term capacity of the donor organ to activate rejection mechanisms.", 
    "141": "Monacolin K, an inhibitor for cholesterol synthesis, is the secondary metabolite of Monascus species. The formation of the secondary metabolites of the Monascus species is affected by cultivation environment and method. This research uses sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), potato (Solanum tuberosum), casava (Manihot esculenta), and dioscorea (Dioscorea batatas) as the substrates and discusses the best substrate to produce monacolin K. The results show that Monascus purpureus NTU 301, with dioscorea as the substrate, can produce monacolin K at 2,584 mg kg(-1), which is 5.37 times to that resulted when rice is used as the substrate. In addition, more amount of yellow pigment can be found in Monascus-fermented dioscorea than in Monascus-fermented rice. The certain composition of yellow pigment is identified as monascin, which has been shown as an antiinflammation agent exhibiting potent inhibitory effects on 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA)-induced inflammation in mice in previous studies. Therefore, dioscorea is concluded to be the best substrate for Monascus species to produce the cholesterol-lowering agent-monacolin K and antiinflammation agent-monascin.", 
    "142": "We previously showed that variant SLCO1B1 haplotype *1b (A388G) accelerates and that *5 (T521C) delays hepatocellular uptake of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor pravastatin [Mwinyi et al. (2004): Clin Pharmacol Ther 75:415-421]. In the present study we checked for differential effects of variant SLCO1B1 haplotypes on hepatocellular cholesterol synthesis. We analyzed the serum levels of cholesterol, lathosterol, and campesterol in healthy white males which had been grouped on the basis of their SLCO1B1 haplotype: *1a (n=10), *1b (n=10), and *5 (n=8). The subjects received a single oral dose of 40 mg pravastatin. Cholesterol and lathosterol levels were lower in all subjects following pravastatin intake for up to 24. Median levels 6 h post-dosing of lathosterol decreased in each SLCO1B1 haplotype group in the rank order of *1b (-0.11 mg dl(-1); min-max: -0.20 to -0.04; p=0.005) > *1a (-0.09 mg dl(-1); min-max: -0.22 to -0.05; p=0.005) > *5 (-0.07 mg dl(-1); min-max: -0.17 to -0.05; p=0.012). Lathosterol median-change values were significantly greater in haplotype *1b than in haplotype *5 individuals (p=0.041, non-adjusted), which was congruent with the extent of mean changes in lathosterol-to-cholesterol ratios, although the latter did not reach statistical significance. Post-treatment serum levels of campesterol were not affected by SLCO1B1 haplotype. Interestingly, sterol basal serum levels tended to be highest in *1b carriers, followed by those in *1a and *5 individuals, with significant differences in lathosterol concentrations between the *1b and *5 (p=0.041, non-adjusted) haplotype group. Our findings suggest an association of SLCO1B1*1b and *5 haplotypes to pravastatin's inhibition of the hepatocellular HMG-CoA reductase. Furthermore, SLCO1B1 haplotypes seem to play a role in basal cholesterol homeostasis.", 
    "143": "Although a change in life-style is often the method of first choice for lipid lowering, lipid-lowering drugs, in general, help to control elevated levels of different forms of lipids in patients with hyperlipidemia. While one group of drugs, statins, lowers cholesterol, the other group, fibrates, is known to take care of fatty acids and triglycerides. In addition, other drugs, such as ezetimibe, colesevelam, torcetrapib, avasimibe, implitapide, and niacin are also being considered to manage hyperlipidemia. As lipids are very critical for cardiovascular diseases, these drugs reduce fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular abnormalities in the general population. However, a number of recent studies indicate that apart from their lipid-lowering activities, statins and fibrates exhibit multiple functions to modulate intracellular signaling pathways, inhibit inflammation, suppress the production of reactive oxygen species, and modulate T cell activity. Therefore, nowadays, these drugs are being considered as possible therapeutics for several forms of human disorders including cancer, autoimmunity, inflammation, and neurodegeneration. Here I discuss these applications in the light of newly discovered modes of action of these drugs."
