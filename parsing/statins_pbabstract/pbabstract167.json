It is likely to be higher than this in everyday clinical practice when statins are knowingly or inadvertently co-prescribed with drugs that interfere with their metabolism. We report a case of rhabdomyolysis causing muscle weakness and prolonging an episode of dialysis-dependent acute kidney injury, which occurred when fusidic acid was co-prescribed with atorvastatin. Renal function and muscle power recovered when both drugs were withdrawn. We found four other cases of rhabdomyolysis with fusidic acid and atorvastatin and three with fusidic acid and simvastatin in the literature, a review of which suggests that the risks of rhabdomyolysis vary with the extent to which an individual statin is dependent for its metabolism on the cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme and the degree to which this isoenzyme's activity is inhibited by a particular antimicrobial. Of note, the interaction between statins and fusidic acid did not feature in seven of eight recent reviews of statin toxicity. Our case report highlights the importance of close monitoring of patients on statins, especially when new drugs are started or if patients become unwell, by checking creatine kinase and liver function tests and by examining for new muscle weakness. Our review of statin-antimicrobial drug interactions suggests that fusidic acid is another CYP450 3A4 enzyme inhibitor with the potential to cause rhabdomyolysis when co-prescribed with simvastatin and atorvastatin.", 
    "1": "Pronounced variability in blood pressure (BP) is an aggravating factor of hypertensive end-organ damage. However, its pathogenesis remains unknown. Statins have various protective effects on the cardiovascular system. Thus, we determined whether simvastatin would attenuate the aggravation of hypertensive cardiac remodeling in a rat model of hypertension with large BP variability, and also investigated the signaling mechanism involved in its effect. A model of hypertension with large BP variability was created by performing bilateral sinoaortic denervation (SAD) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). A SAD or sham operation was performed in 12-week-old rats. Thereafter, simvastatin (0.2 mgkg(-1) per day) or vehicle was intraperitoneally administered every day. After 6 weeks , telemetric recordings revealed that SAD enhanced BP variability without changing the mean BP. SAD increased myocyte hypertrophy, myocardial fibrosis and macrophage infiltration associated with the upregulation of brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), type I procollagen, transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 and monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, and activation of RhoA, Ras and ERK1/2. Simvastatin did not change the mean BP or BP variability in SAD-operated SHRs. In SAD-operated SHRs, simvastatin attenuated myocyte hypertrophy and BNP expression, as well as RhoA, Ras and ERK1/2 activities. In contrast, simvastatin did not change myocardial fibrosis, macrophage infiltration, or the expression of procollagen and TGF-\u03b2 or MCP-1 in SAD-operated SHRs. Simvastatin did not affect serum lipid levels. In conclusion, simvastatin attenuated the large BP variability-induced aggravation of cardiac hypertrophy, but not myocardial fibrosis, in SHRs. The activation of RhoA/Ras-ERK pathways may contribute to the aggravation of cardiac hypertrophy by a combination of hypertension and large BP variability.", 
    "2": "This study was a prospective, randomized, open, blinded endpoint study to assess the effects of angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker, losartan, compared with calcium channel blocker, amlodipine, on left ventricular (LV) diastolic function and atherosclerosis of the carotid artery in Japanese patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, LV hypertrophy, diastolic dysfunction and preserved systolic function. Fifty-seven patients were randomly assigned to losartan- or amlodipine-based treatment groups and were followed up for 18 months. Blood pressure was similarly reduced by both regimens. Losartan shortened the transmitral E-wave deceleration time, and amlodipine reduced LV mass index; however, there was no significant difference in the percent changes of these indices between the two groups. Mean carotid intima-media thickness (mean IMT) as well as plaque score significantly increased in the amlodipine-based regimen (pre: 1.05\u00b10.26 mm, follow-up: 1.23\u00b10.33 mm, P=0.0015), but not in the losartan-based regimen (pre: 1.08\u00b10.35 mm, follow-up: 1.16\u00b10.52 mm, P=non-significant). The percent increase in mean IMT in the amlodipine-based regimen tended to be large compared with the losartan-based regimen (amlodipine: 19.8\u00b123.7%, losartan: 6.9\u00b123.3%, P=0.06). Under similar reduction of blood pressure, losartan is likely effective in protecting the progression of atherosclerosis of the carotid artery compared with amlodipine. Losartan may improve LV diastolic function, and amlodipine may attenuate LV hypertrophy; however, this study cannot make consecutive remarks about the superiority of either treatment regimen in the effects on cardiac function and geometry.

Statins has been demonstrated to facilitate p53 degradation by activating its specific ubiquitin ligase, MDM2. The aim of this study was to determine whether atorvastatin (ATR) improves the outcome of diabetic PAD through MDM2-mediated reduction of p53.", 
    "4": "Male KK/Ay mice (9 weeks old) were treated with ATR (2 mg/kg/day p.o.) or vehicle for 2 weeks and subjected to ischemic hindlimb operation to generate a diabetic PAD model. Incidences of amputation and changes of p53/MDM2 signaling in each ischemic limb were assessed 2 weeks after the operation (at 13 weeks of age). Effects of ATR on the insulin resistance of age-matched (13-week-old) and unoperated KK/Ay mice were assessed by the glucose tolerance test, circulating adiponectin concentration, and changes in insulin signaling (IRS-1/Akt phosphorylation).", 
    "5": "In intact KK/Ay, ATR treatment mitigated insulin resistance without affecting cholesterol levels. All diabetic PAD models exhibited autoamputation (100%); however, ATR treatment partially restored the limb loss (41.7%). The p53 expression level in the ischemic limb of ATR-treated KK/Ay was significantly decreased and MDM2 phosphorylation level was markedly increased in tandem with the activation of Akt. Hypoxia mimetic iron chelator deferroxamine promoted p53 accumulation in H9c2 myoblast cells by suppressing the Akt/MDM2 pathway, which was restored by ATR.",

    "7": "Inhibition of cholesterol synthesis by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMG-CoAR) inhibitors has been associated with an increase in intestinal cholesterol absorption. This study examined how HMG-CoAR inhibition by atorvastatin modulates expression of key genes involved in intestinal cholesterol metabolism. A crossover study was conducted in which 22 hyperlipidemic men received atorvastatin, 40 mg/day, or placebo, each for 12 weeks. Gene expression was assessed by real-time PCR using duodenal biopsy samples obtained at the end of each phase of treatment. Treatment with atorvastatin was associated with a 76% reduction in lathosterol and significant increases in sitosterol (70%). Atorvastatin significantly increased intestinal mRNA levels of HMG-CoAR (59%), LDL receptor (LDLR) (52%), PCSK9 (187%), SREBP-2 (44%), and HNF-4\u03b1 (13%). Furthermore, atorvastatin significantly increased intestinal mRNA levels of NPC1L1 by 19% and decreased mRNA levels of both ABCG5 and ABCG8 by 14%. Positive correlations were observed between changes in SREBP-2 and HNF-4\u03b1 expression and concurrent changes in the intestinal mRNA levels of HMG-CoAR, LDLR, and NPC1L1. These results indicate that HMG-CoAR inhibition with atorvastatin stimulates the intestinal expression of NPC1L1, LDLR, and PCSK9; increases cholesterol absorption; and reduces expression of ABCG5/8; these effects are most likely mediated by upregulation of the transcription factors SREBP-2 and HNF-4\u03b1.",

Whether increased concentrations of plant sterols truly affect vascular function and whether these effects are exclusive to the larger vessels remains unknown. We compared the effects of long-term plant sterol and -stanol consumption on changes in retinal vessels diameter which reflex alterations in the microcirculation. Three randomized groups were studied at baseline and after 85-weeks. Group one (N=11) consumed plant sterol enriched margarine (2.5g/day), the second (N=8) plant stanol enriched margarine (2.5g/day), and the control group (N=11) non-enriched margarine (2.5g/day). Serum cholesterol-standardized campesterol and sitosterol concentrations increased by 354.84\u00b1168.22\u00b7102\u03bcmol/mmol and 84.36\u00b148.26\u00b7102\u03bcmol/mmol (p<0.001), respectively in the sterol group, while decreasing non-significantly in the plant stanol group. Serum LDL-cholesterol concentrations decreased significantly in both the plant sterol (-0.33\u00b10.33mmol/L, p=0.016) and -stanol groups (-0.38\u00b10.34mmol/L, p=0.018) compared to the increase in the controls (0.29\u00b10.34mmol/L). The mean change in venular diameters for the plant sterol group (2.3\u00b13.1\u03bcm), plant stanol groups (-0.8\u00b13.4\u03bcm) and control group (-0.8\u00b15.1\u03bcm) did not reach significance but the change in cholesterol-standardized campesterol concentrations correlated positively with the change in venular diameter independent of changes in serum LDL-cholesterol concentrations (r=0.39, N=30, p=0.033). Increased serum campesterol concentration correlated positively with increased retinal venular diameter, independent from changes in serum LDL-cholesterol concentrations. This may constitute an explanation for the suggested effects of plant sterols on vascular function. However, this novel finding needs confirmation and further study.",

Although the only effective treatment for NAFLD is caloric restriction and weight loss, existing data show that atorvastatin, a hydroxymethyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor, can be used safely in patients with NAFLD and improves hepatic histology. To gain further insight into the molecular mechanisms of atorvastatin's therapeutic effect on NAFLD, we used an experimental model that mimics human consumption of fructose-sweetened beverages. Control, fructose (10% w/v solution) and fructose+atorvastatin (30 mg/kg/day) Sprague-Dawley rats were sacrificed after 14 days. Plasma and liver tissue samples were obtained to determine plasma analytes, liver histology, and the expression of liver proteins that are related to fatty acid synthesis and catabolism, and inflammatory processes. Fructose supplementation induced hypertriglyceridemia and hyperleptinemia, hepatic steatosis and necroinflammation, increased the expression of genes related to fatty acid synthesis and decreased fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation activity. Atorvastatin treatment completely abolished histological signs of necroinflammation, reducing the hepatic expression of metallothionein-1 and nuclear factor kappa B binding. Furthermore, atorvastatin reduced plasma (x 0.74) and liver triglyceride (x 0.62) concentrations, decreased the liver expression of carbohydrate response element binding protein transcription factor (x 0.45) and its target genes, and increased the hepatic activity of the fatty acid \u03b2-oxidation system (x 1.15). These effects may be related to the fact that atorvastatin decreased the expression of fructokinase (x 0.6) in livers of fructose-supplemented rats, reducing the metabolic burden on the liver that is imposed by continuous fructose ingestion.",

As the epidemic of obesity, diabetes, and hypertension continues to grow among young adults, the population at risk for atherosclerotic CHD is ever increasing. More than a century of laboratory and human findings link cholesterol levels with a propensity to develop atherosclerosis. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is the major atherogenic lipoprotein, and numerous clinical trials have shown the efficacy of lowering LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) for reducing CHD risk. New trial data have resulted in LDL-C goals being lowered over time and expansion of the population of patients that are candidates for LDL-lowering therapy to decrease their lifetime risk of CHD. Although statins are relatively safe and well tolerated, there are still significant numbers of patients who cannot tolerate them and many others who only require mild LDL-C reduction and prefer nonprescription alternatives to statin therapy. A number of dietary supplements and functional foods have been suggested to reduce LDL-C levels, but only a few have withstood the rigors of randomized controlled trials. Here we review the evidence in support of dietary supplements and their LDL-C-lowering effects. We also review supplements that, after initial excitement about their purported effect, were not found to lower LDL-C significantly.",

    "62": "The response to arterial wall injury is an inflammatory process, which over time becomes integral to the development of atherosclerosis and subsequent plaque instability. However, the underlying injurious agent, critical to this process, has not received much attention. In this review, a model of plaque rupture is hypothesized with two stages of inflammatory activity. In stage I (cholesterol crystal-induced cell injury and apoptosis), intracellular cholesterol crystals induce foam cell apoptosis, setting up a vicious cycle by signaling more macrophages, resulting in accumulation of extra cellular lipids. This local inflammation eventually leads to the formation of a semi-liquid, lipid-rich necrotic core of a vulnerable plaque. In stage II (cholesterol crystal-induced arterial wall injury), the saturated lipid core is now primed for crystallization, which can manifest as a clinical syndrome with a systemic inflammation response. Cholesterol crystallization is the trigger that causes core expansion, leading to intimal injury. We recently demonstrated that when cholesterol crystallizes from a liquid to a solid state, it undergoes volume expansion, which can tear the plaque cap. This observation of cholesterol crystals perforating the cap and intimal surface was made in the plaques of patients who died with acute coronary syndrome. We have also demonstrated that several agents (ie, statins, aspirin, and ethanol) can dissolve cholesterol crystals and may be exerting their immediate benefits by this direct mechanism. Also, because recent studies have demonstrated that high-sensitivity C-reactive protein may be a reliable marker in selecting patients for statin therapy, it could reflect the presence of intimal injury by cholesterol crystals. This was demonstrated in an atherosclerotic rabbit model. Therefore, we propose that cholesterol crystallization could help explain in part both local and systemic inflammation associated with atherosclerosis.",

NO evokes, because of its free radical properties and affinity to heme, ferrous iron and cysteine, a wide spectrum of physiological and pathophysiological effects. For many years, different exogenous NOS inhibitors were used to elucidate the role of NOS and NO in health and disease. Later, endogenous NOS inhibitors, as asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) were discovered. Endogenous inhibitors as ADMA are produced by post-translational methylation of L-arginine which is catalyzed by a family of protein N-methyltransferases (PRMT), using S-adenosylmethionine as a methyl group donor. ADMA is eliminated by dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolases (DDAH I or II). ADMA hydrolysis increases NOS activity and NO production. Furthermore, L-citrulline, a by-product of ADMA hydrolysis as well as of NO production by NOS, can in turn inhibit DDAH. Therefore, endogenous inhibition of NOS can be modified via different ways (1) changing the availability of L-arginine and/or of L-citrulline; (2) stimulating or inhibiting DDAH activity; (3) modifying methylation via regulating availability of adenosylmethionine; or (4) modifying PRMT activity.

Fifteen days after injection of ISO (85 mg/kg twice at an interval of 24 h, s.c), rats showed decline in maximal rate of rise and fall of left ventricular pressure (LV (dP/dt)(max) and LV (dP/dt)(min)), cardiac contractility index (LV (dP/dt)(max)/LVP), cardiac output and rise in LV end-diastolic pressure. CHF rats showed a significant increase in serum creatine kinase isoenzyme-MB (CK-MB) and malondialdehyde levels, as well as fall in the activities of superoxide dismutase, reduced glutathione. Altered lipid profile and increased level of cytokine tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) along with histological changes in heart were also observed in CHF rats. T. arjuna bark extract (500 mg/kg, p.o) treatment prior and 15 days after ISO injection significantly attenuated cardiac dysfunction and myocardial injury in CHF rats. Cardioprotective action of T. arjuna was comparable to fluvastatin, a synthetic drug. The results suggest that T. arjuna bark extract has a significant prophylactic and therapeutic beneficial effect on protection of heart against ISO-induced CHF possibly through maintaining endogenous antioxidant enzyme activities, inhibiting lipid peroxidation and cytokine levels.", 
    "112": "Statins are agents widely used to lower LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) in primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. The five statins available in the UK (simvastatin, pravastatin, fluvastatin, atorvastatin and rosuvastatin) differ in many of their pharmacologic properties. In addition to lowering LDL-C, statins also increase HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) moderately. There have been rare reports of significant HDL-C decreases in patients commenced on fibrates and when thiazolidinediones are added to fibrates. This is known as a 'paradoxical HDL-C decrease' as both groups of agents usually increase HDL-C. This phenomenon has never been clearly documented following statin therapy. We now describe a patient with type 2 diabetes who showed this paradoxical fall in HDL-C (baseline HDL-C: 1.8 mmol/L; on simvastatin 40 mg HDL-C 0.6 mmol/L; on atorvastatin 20 mg HDL-C 0.9 mmol/L) with a similar decrease in apolipoprotein A1. No similar decrease was observed with pravastatin and rosuvastatin therapy. This phenomenon appeared to be associated with statin treatment and not a statin/fibrate combination. Our patient clearly demonstrated a paradoxical HDL-C fall with simvastatin and atorvastatin, but not pravastatin or rosuvastatin. Simvastatin and atorvastatin share many pharmacokinetic properties such as lipophilicity while pravastatin and rosuvastatin are relatively hydrophilic and are not metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4. However, these characteristics do not explain the dramatic reductions in HDL-C observed.", 
    "113": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is an age-related degenerative disease comprising the main reason of handicap in the Western world. Interestingly, to date, there are neither available biomarkers for early diagnosis of the disease nor any effective therapy other than symptomatic treatment and joint replacement surgery. OA has long been associated with obesity, mainly due to mechanical overload exerted on the joints. Recent studies however, point to the direction that OA is a metabolic disease, as it also involves non-weight bearing joints. In fact, altered lipid metabolism may be the underlying cause. First, adipokines have been shown to be key regulators of OA pathogenesis. Second, epidemiological studies have shown serum cholesterol to be a risk factor for OA development. Third, lipid deposition in the joint is observed at the early stages of OA before the occurrence of histological changes. Fourth, proteomic analyses have shown an important connection between OA and lipid metabolism. Finally, recent gene expression studies reveal a deregulation of cholesterol influx and efflux and in the expression of lipid metabolism-related genes. Interestingly, lipids and lipid metabolism are known to be implicated in the development and progression of another age-related degenerative disease, atherosclerosis (ATH). Thus, although it is tempting to speculate that the osteoarthritic chondrocyte has been transformed to foam cell, it has not been proven yet. However, this may be an intriguing theory linking ATH and OA, which may open new avenues to novel therapeutic interventions for OA taking advantage of previous knowledge from ATH.", 
    "114": "Statins have pleiotropic vascular protective effects that are independent of their cholesterol-lowering effects. The aim of the present study was to determine if statins have anti-flushing actions in an animal model of forced exercise-induced temperature dysregulation in menopausal hot flushes, and to clarify the critical role of statins in regulating vascular reactivity in the tail arteries of ovariectomized rats. Administration of fluvastatin or pravastatin (3mg/kg/day for 7days, p.o.) significantly ameliorated the flushing of tail skin in ovariectomized mice, and the effect of each statin was comparable with that of estrogen replacement (1mg/kg/week for 3weeks, i.m.). In phenylephrine-pre-contracted rat-tail arteries, ovariectomy inhibited acetylcholine-induced relaxation, but augmented sodium nitroprusside-induced relaxation. These ovariectomy-altered vasodilator responses were restored by fluvastatin treatment as well as by estrogen replacement. Nitrite/nitrate levels in the plasma of ovariectomized animals showed significantly lower values than those in sham-operated animals; this ovariectomy-reduced production of nitric oxide was improved by fluvastatin treatment. These data provide the first experimental evidence that statins such as fluvastatin and pravastatin exert anti-flushing effects by improving vasomotor dysfunction through nitric oxide-mediated mechanisms in ovariectomized animals. Thus, therapeutic methods that target improvement of vasomotor dysfunction could be novel strategies for reducing menopausal hot flushes.",

However, such a pleiotrophic effect has not been fully studied in a new statin (pitavastatin). We examined and compared the effects of two strong statins (atorvastatin, 30 mg/kg/day, p.o.; pitavastatin, 3mg/kg/day, p.o.) on the serum level of lipids, cognitive dysfunction, senile plaque (SP) and phosphorylated tau-positive dystrophic neuritis (p\u03c4DN) in amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic (Tg) mice from 5 months (M) of age to 20 M. These two statins improved behavioral memory and reduced the numbers of SP and p\u03c4DN at 15 and 20 M without affecting serum lipid levels, but preserved mice brain weight in pitavastatin group at 20 M. These protective effects of statins took 10 M from the beginning of treatment to show an improvement in the present model mice, and sensitivity to the statin treatment was linked to behavioral memory, SP and p\u03c4DN in this order.

    "135": "AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is proposed to be a key regulator of cellular and organismal metabolism and has reported vasculoprotective effects. In addition, many therapeutic agents used in the treatment of diabetes and atherosclerosis such as metformin, thiazolidinediones and statins may exert their vasculoprotective effects through activation of AMPK. Activation of AMPK has a number of potentially beneficial anti-atherosclerotic effects including reducing adhesion of inflammatory cells to the blood vessel endothelium, reducing lipid accumulation and the proliferation of inflammatory cells caused by oxidised lipids, stimulation of gene expression responsible for cellular antioxidant defenses and stimulation of enzymes responsible for nitric oxide formation. In humans and animals the AMPK cascade triggers vascular protective mechanisms that have been shown to reduce myocardial ischaemic injury and mutations in AMPK can cause familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Taken together, these data suggest that activation and function of AMPK contributes to cardiovascular health. In this review we propose to focus on the vasculoprotective effects of AMPK, the evidence for AMPK activation with currently used therapeutic agents and the potential for agents which specifically activate AMPK as a treatment for vascular disease.",

Statins, a family of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitors, are currently being investigated for the treatment and prevention of cancer. In this study, we investigated the effects of simvastatin on ovarian clear cell carcinoma (OCCC) cells in vitro and in vivo and elucidated the mechanism of drug action. Changes in OPN gene expression were determined by real-time RT-PCR, and an MTT assay was performed to determine effects on cell proliferation. Finally, a xenograft tumor model was constructed to evaluate the effects of simvastatin on cell proliferation and apoptosis in vivo. According to our experimental results, OPN is an important protein in OCCC. Simvastatin inhibited OCCC cell proliferation, and the inhibition rate was approximately 40% to 50% after treatment with 10 \u00b5M simvastatin for 48 h. In the xenograft studies, simvastatin treatment resulted in a significant growth inhibition. Furthermore, the mice treated with simvastatin survived significantly longer compared to the control groups. In conclusion, simvastatin has anticancer effects in vitro and in vivo.

Phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes of impaired fasting glucose (n = 32) and hypercholesterolemic (n = 30) subjects produced more interleukin-2, interferon-g, and tumor necrosis factor-a than lymphocytes of 31 matched subjects with normal plasma lipids and glucose tolerance. Apart from lowering plasma lipids, in both treatment groups, simvastatin (40 mg daily) reduced lymphocyte cytokine release to the level observed in control subjects, which was accompanied by a decrease in plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 levels. Our study shows that already at the early stages of glucose metabolism abnormalities, lymphocyte secretory function is disturbed to a similar degree as in hypercholesterolemia. Simvastatin is an effective lymphocyte-suppressing and anti-inflammatory agent irrespective of plasma lipid levels. The treatment-induced reduction in lymphocyte cytokine release and systemic inflammation may contribute to the clinical effectiveness of statins in the prevention and therapy of atherosclerosis in subjects with early glucose metabolism abnormalities and dyslipidemia.",

Chronic angina remains a major public health burden despite state-of-the-art therapies, and improvement in survival from myocardial infarction and CHD has only increased its prevalence. There is growing experimental and clinical evidence pointing to the anti-ischemic and anti-anginal properties of statins. Some data suggest that the degree of anti-ischemic efficacy of statins may be comparable to the current standard pharmacologic and mechanical strategies. The pleiotropic effects of statins are postulated to be primarily responsible for their anti-ischemic and anti-anginal properties. These include improvement of endothelial function, enhancement of the ischemic vasodilatory response, modulation of inflammation, and protection from ischemia-reperfusion injury. The anti-ischemic effects of statins further strengthen their role as a crucial component of the optimal medical therapy for CHD.", 
    "162": "The latest recommended goals for blood lipid levels may require multiple lipid drugs. Lower doses in combination may render more efficacy and safety than highest doses of single agents. Except for isolated hypoalphalipoproteinemia (a low level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol), therapies will start with a statin. All marketed statins are acceptable. The choice may be based on dose- efficacy and patient's tolerability. High-potency statins (eg, atorvastatin, simvastatin, or rosuvastatin) are often chosen. Currently, generic statins, such as simvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, and fluvastatin, offer cost benefits. The choice of added agent depends on the \"residual lipoprotein abnormalities\" after statin therapy, efficacy, compliance issues, and cost. Approved \"combined\" preparations improve cost and compliance. To further lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, ezetimibe is a safe, efficacious choice, pending resolution of a controversial trial's results. Colesevelam is moderately effective and the best tolerated bile acids sequestrant. In combined dyslipidemias, extended-release niacin is the best tolerated niacin preparation; other quality-controlled immediate-release preparations have similar safety and efficacy but produce more flushing of the skin.

    "168": "Multidrug resistance-associated protein (Mrp) 2-deficient (TR(-)) Wistar rats have been used to elucidate the role of Mrp2 in drug disposition. Decreased breast cancer resistance protein (Bcrp) levels were reported in sandwich-cultured hepatocytes (SCH) from TR(-) rats compared with those from wild-type (WT) rats. This study was designed to characterize hepatic Bcrp expression and function in TR(-) rats, using nitrofurantoin and pitavastatin as substrates. Bcrp was knocked down by RNA interference in rat SCH. Antibody BXP53, but not BXP21, specifically detected Bcrp knockdown in SCH. Bcrp protein levels were decreased markedly in TR(-) but not Mrp2-deficient Sprague-Dawley [Eisai hyperbilirubinemic rats (EHBR)] rats. Bcrp mRNA levels were decreased significantly in TR(-) livers as determined by TaqMan real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Biliary excretion of nitrofurantoin, a specific Bcrp substrate, was decreased significantly in SCH and isolated perfused livers from TR(-) rats compared with those from WT controls, indicating that hepatic Bcrp function is decreased in TR(-) rats. In Bcrp knockdown SCH, the biliary excretion index and in vitro biliary clearance of pitavastatin were decreased significantly to \u223c 58 and \u223c 52% of control, respectively, indicating that Bcrp plays a role in pitavastatin biliary excretion. Pitavastatin biliary excretion was decreased significantly in perfused livers from TR(-) compared with those from WT rats. In conclusion, expression and function of hepatic Bcrp are decreased significantly in TR(-) rats. The potential role of both Bcrp and Mrp2 should be considered when data generated in TR(-) rats are interpreted. TR(-) and EHBR rats in combination may be useful in differentiating the role of Mrp2 and Bcrp in drug/metabolite disposition.", 
    "169": "In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, intense control of blood pressure, lipids and glucose, aiming at theoretically ideal values, is bought at a cost. Intense blood pressure control has renal complications. Intense lipid control, thus far, has worked for reduction of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, paradoxically at the cost of a small increase in new diabetes. Intense control of glycaemia generally requires insulin added to oral agents, which is consistently accompanied by weight gain, while increased hypoglycaemia has a long-term risk of cerebral damage. Intense glycaemic control has not consistently reduced mortality, whereas a strategy based on tight control of lipids and blood pressure with modestly tight glucose control has succeeded. Looking to the future, incretin mimetics may come to the fore as prime agents because they can reduce weight and glycaemia with little significant hypoglycaemia, thereby making tight glucose control easier to achieve.",

There is common agreement on the use of thienopyridine (mainly second-generation) during CAS, but some patients are unsuitable for clopidogrel treatment and data on the benefit of its use in large CAS populations are lacking. The aim of this study was to investigate whether clopidogrel was associated with reduced perioperative morbidity in patients undergoing CAS.",

Clopidogrel use was associated with a non-significant reduction of perioperative stroke/death (4.3% vs. 2.4%; p = 0.13) and disabling stroke (1.2% vs. 1.0%; p = 1) rates. The non-significant stroke/death difference was similar in symptomatic (5.8% vs. 4.0%, p = 0.37) and asymptomatic (3.7% vs. 1.9%; p = 0.17) patients. After adjusting for demographics, co-morbidities and other therapies with multivariable analysis, clopidogrel use failed to show any significant independent association in decreasing operative risks. The only independent protective factor was use of statins (p = 0.010). The additional use of dual anti-platelet therapy did not add any advantage to the use of clopidogrel alone.", 
    "173": "The suggested benefit of clopidogrel in decreasing the incidence of complications in patients undergoing CAS may be overestimated due to the overlapping effect of other more relevant factors (e.g., pleiotropy and plaque stabilisation from statins). More data and level I evidence are needed to understand which is the best medical management of CAS that will help improve outcomes of the procedure.", 
    "174": "Targeting elevations in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) remains the cornerstone of cardiovascular prevention. However, this fraction does not adequately capture elevated triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRLs; e.g. intermediate-density lipoprotein, very low density lipoprotein) in certain patients with metabolic syndrome or diabetic dyslipidaemia. Many such individuals have residual cardiovascular risk that might be lipid/lipoprotein related despite therapy with first-line agents (statins). Epidemiological evidence encompassing > 100,000 persons supports the contention that non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) is a superior risk factor vs. LDL-C for incident coronary heart disease (CHD) in certain patient populations. In studies with clinical end-points evaluated in the current article, a 1:1 to 1:3 relationship was observed between reductions in non-HDL-C and in the relative risk of CHD after long-term treatment with statins, niacin (nicotinic acid) and fibric-acid derivatives (fibrates); this relationship increased to 1:5 to 1:10 in smaller subgroups of patients with elevated triglycerides and low HDL-C levels. Treatment with statin-, niacin-, fibrate-, ezetimibe-, and omega 3 fatty acid-containing regimens reduced non-HDL-C by approximately 9-65%. In a range of clinical trials, long-term treatment with these agents also significantly decreased the incidence of clinical/angiographic/imaging efficacy outcome variables. For patients with dyslipidaemia, consensus guidelines have established non-HDL-C treatment targets 30 mg/dl higher than LDL-C goals. Ongoing prospective randomised controlled trials should help to resolve controversies concerning (i) the clinical utility of targeting non-HDL-C in patients with dyslipidaemia; (ii) the most efficacious and well-tolerated therapies to reduce non-HDL-C (e.g. combination regimens); and (iii) associations between such reductions and clinical, angiographic, and/or imaging end-points.",

In this review we present results of studies assessing effect of various allele variants of CYP3A4 and CYP3A5 on efficacy and tolerability of atorvastatin, lovastatin,, and simvastatin in different populations of patients.

The Justification for the Use of Statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) in subjects with elevated C-reactive protein, without vascular disease and below average low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) showed a 50% reduction in LDL-C with 20 mg/d of rosuvastatin and a reduction in cardiovascular events (hazard ratio 0.56 [95% CI, 0.46-0.69]; P\u2009<\u20090.00001), and a reduction in total mortality (20%; P\u2009<\u20090.02). Recent commentary has criticized perceived JUPITER design flaws and inappropriate influence. However, the Canadian 2009 guidelines cite JUPITER as class I evidence for statin benefit. Although the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' (CTT) Collaborators showed that, regardless of pre-treatment levels, statins can significantly reduce CHD, major vascular events, and overall mortality, a recent primary prevention meta-analysis showed no decrease in all-cause mortality. Preconceived notions on statin benefit or harm do not enhance patient care and clinicians should individualize long-term statin therapy.", 
    "182": "Studies in vascular cells in culture and in laboratory animals revealed that statin discontinuation triggers a rebound deterioration of vascular function. Retrospective studies of patients admitted with an acute coronary syndrome revealed that stopping statins during the first days of admission was associated with worse outcomes. In a prospective, randomized controlled trial in patients with a hemispheric ischemic stroke, stopping statins for 3\u00a0days was associated with a 4.7-fold increase in the risk of death or dependency, greater neurological deterioration, and a larger infarct volume. Discontinuing statins during the post-operative period following major vascular surgery was associated with a higher incidence of myocardial ischemia, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular death. However, no increase in adverse outcomes was observed in patients with stable chronic coronary artery disease following statin treatment discontinuation. Despite some study limitations, the bulk of the evidence suggests that under conditions of severe acute vascular stress, removal of statins must be contraindicated.",

In particular, ACCORD-Lipid trial, in our view, supports the addition of fenofibrate to statin therapy in patients with T2DM and optimal low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels but persistent, significant hypertriglyceridemia (>200 mg/dl) and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (<35-40 mg/dl).", 
    "186": "There is growing evidence to support the hypothesis that statins may act as neuroprotectants in several neuropathological conditions, including Alzheimer's disease. The mechanisms for neuroprotection are only partially understood, however, and pleiotropic phenomena could be involved. We have made a comparative study of 9 statins (lovastatin, mevastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin, cerivastatin, atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pitavastatin, and rosuvastatin), analyzing several parameters that could be related to neuroprotection, such as chemical structure, lipophilicity, potential blood-brain-barrier penetration (BBB), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl co-enzyme A reductase inhibition, cholesterol modulation in neurons, glia, and human hepatocyte cell lines, and protection against neurodegeneration caused by tau hyperphosphorylation induced by okadaic acid. Our results indicate that monacolin J derivatives (natural and semi-synthetic statins) are the best candidates for the prevention of neurodegenerative conditions due to their higher potential BBB penetration capacity, cholesterol lowering effect on neurons with a satisfactory safety profile, and in vitro protection against cell death caused by okadaic acid in culture. Among the nine statins studied, simvastatin presented the best characteristics for preventing neurodegenerative conditions.", 
    "187": "Recent reports have shown that statin (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) may have the potential to inhibit inflammatory arthritis. More recently, the idea that chondrocyte aging is closely associated with the progression of cartilage degeneration has been promulgated. Here, we demonstrate the potential of statin as protective agents against chondrocyte aging and degeneration of articular cartilage during the progression of osteoarthritis (OA), both in vitro and in vivo. The OA-related catabolic factor, IL-1\u03b2 induced marked downregulation of cellular activity, expression of a senescent biomarker, specific senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase activity and shortening of the cellular lifespan in chondrocytes. In contrast, treatment with statin inhibited the IL-1\u03b2-induced production of cartilage matrix degrading .enzymes (metalloprotease-1 and -13) and cellular senescence in of chondrocytes in vitro. In addition, this statin accelerated the production of cartilage matrix proteoglycan in chondrocytes. The in vivo study was performed on the STR/OrtCrlj mouse, an experimental model which spontaneously develops an osteoarthritic process. In this mouse model, treatment with statin significantly reduced the degeneration of articular cartilage, while the control knee joints showed progressive cartilage degeneration over time. These findings suggest that statin may have the potential to prevent the catabolic stress-induced chondrocyte disability and aging observed in articular cartilage. Our results indicate that statin are potential therapeutic agents for protection of articular cartilage against the progression of OA.", 
    "188": "We sought to determine if atorvastatin lowers blood pressure in patients with previously diagnosed and well-controlled essential arterial hypertension and if this effect could be related to anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative effects. Among 92 patients with essential arterial hypertension, we studied 56 non-smoking and normolipemic: 39 were randomized to receive 80 mg atorvastatin daily for 3 months (statin-treated patients, ST), and the rest continued a previous hypotensive therapy (statin-free patients, SF). Blood pressure was measured using a 24-h ambulatory blood pressure measurement device. Serum levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), total antioxidant status (TAS) and plasma peroxides (assessed by Oxystat) were measured in both groups. The mean change in systolic BP (SBP) for atorvastatin was -5.7 mmHg (95% confidence interval CI, -4.1 to -7.2 mmHg), and the mean change in diastolic BP (DBP) was -3.9 mmHg (95% CI, -2.7 to -5.0 mmHg). No change in BP in SF patients was observed. In the ST group, hs-CRP and peroxides did not significantly decrease. In the SF group, concentrations of hs-CRP proceeded to decrease while peroxides increased. In the ST group, changes in hs-CRP correlated with changes in total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (r = 0.41, p = 0.013 and r = 0.35, p = 0.04, respectively) but did not correlate with changes in BP. The hypotensive statin effect was independent of the hypolipemic effect. During three months of observation, TAS concentrations in both groups remained stable. In this randomized study, additionally administered atorvastatin to non-smoking and normolipemic patients with well-controlled essential arterial hypertension resulted in reduction of BP. This effect was not followed by significant changes in hs-CRP, TAS or Oxystat concentrations. The hypotensive effect of atorvastatin did not depend on anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative or hypolipemic actions.", 
    "189": "The study was aimed at investigating the effects of pitavastatin, simvastatin (lipophilic statins) and fluvastatin (hydrophilic statin) on memory deficits associated with Alzheimer's type dementia in mice. Dementia was induced with chronic administration of a high fat diet (HFD) or intracebroventricular streptozotocin (icv STZ, two doses of 3 mg/kg) in separate groups of animals. Memory of the animals was assessed by the Morris water maze (MWM) test. Brain thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels were measured to assess total oxidative stress. Brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and total serum cholesterol levels were also measured. Icv STZ or HFD produced a significant impairment of learning and memory. Higher levels of brain AChE activity and TBARS and lower levels of GSH were observed in icv STZ- as well as HFD-treated animals. HFD-treated mice also showed a significant increase in total serum cholesterol levels. Pitavastatin and simvastatin each significantly attenuated STZ-induced memory deficits and biochemical changes; however, fluvastatin produced no significant effect on icv STZ-induced dementia or biochemical levels. Administration of any one of the three statins not only lowered HFD-induced rise in total serum cholesterol level but also attenuated HFD-induced memory deficits. Further pitavastatin and simvastatin administration also reversed HFD-induced changes in biochemicals level, while fluvastatin failed to produce any significant effect. This study demonstrates the potential of statins in memory dysfunctions associated with experimental dementia and provides evidence of their cholesterol-dependent and -independent actions.",
