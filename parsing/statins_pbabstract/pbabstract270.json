    "0": "Statins, inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis for treating dyslipidemia and preventing cardiovascular complications, have been shown to alter central nervous system functions. Our aim was to investigate the effects of the fluvastatin, a member of statin family, on psychomotor performance, daily activity and spatial memory. Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with fluvastatin (n = 8) or placebo as a control (n = 11) regardless of sex. Fluvastatin (7.5 mg/kg) was administered orally once a day for four weeks, while the control group was administered only placebo. Psychomotor performance was measured by rotarod tests. No significant difference was observed in the fluvastatin group over the course of weeks, but the control group preferred to stay on the device shorter times (p < 0.05). For the first three weeks of the drug administration there was a statistical difference between the groups, however no difference was found after the 4th week. There was no difference in the Barnes maze spatial memory test between the groups and also within the groups over the course of time. Daily activity tests revealed that stereotypical and vertical movements of the fluvastatin group were significantly less than the control group in all four weeks. Ambulatory movements and the distances taken by the fluvastatin group were decreased significantly over the course of time (p < 0.005 and p < 0.001, respectively), but the control group did not reveal any significant change. Our results suggest that fluvastatin altered psychomotor performance and daily activity in rats, but it did not affect the spatial memory. These behavioral changes might be associated with alterations in the composition of the brain lipids caused by fluvastatin.", 
    "1": "It is well recognized that statins affect muscular tissue adversely and that their use is associated with clinically important myositis, rhabdomyolysis, mild elevation of serum creatine kinase (CK) levels, myalgias, muscle weakness, muscle cramps, and persistent myalgias or serum CK level elevations after statin treatment is discontinued. The association between statins and the disclosure of presymptomatic metabolic myopathy is another underrated phenomenon related to statin therapy that was recently recognized in rare cases. The purpose of this report is to provide additional support for this association and to report other neuromuscular disorders that have also been seen following statin intake. The present case series illustrates that statins may act as unmasking agents in asymptomatic patients with a latent neuromuscular disorder. Thus, it may be postulated that statin intake may be a sufficient insult to precipitate neuromuscular symptoms and substantially increase muscle enzymes in presymptomatic patients with an abnormal neuromuscular substrate. In conclusion, muscular symptoms or increased serum CK levels persisting after statin treatment discontinuation should alert the clinician to pursue further diagnostic evaluations for the detection of potential underlying neuromuscular diseases.", 
    "2": "Memory loss and cognitive impairment have been reported in the literature in association with several 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), but we found no published case reports associated with rosuvastatin. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of rosuvastatin-related short-term memory loss. A 53-year-old Caucasian man with hypercholesterolemia experienced memory loss after being treated with rosuvastatin 10 mg/day. He had no other concomitant conditions or drug therapies. After discontinuation of rosuvastatin, the neuropsychiatric adverse reaction resolved gradually, suggesting a probable drug association. During the following year, the patient remained free from neuropsychiatric disturbances. Clinicians should be aware of possible adverse cognitive reactions during statin therapy, including rosuvastatin.", 
    "3": "Gynecomastia can have a significant emotional and social impact on men. Although numerous drug therapies may cause this condition, we found no documented cases of gynecomastia associated with atorvastatin. We describe the development of breast enlargement and tenderness in a 52-year-old Caucasian man 6 months after his simvastatin therapy had been switched to atorvastatin. His symptoms ultimately interfered with his ability to play golf and participate in other activities. These problems resolved after atorvastatin discontinuation and did not recur despite resumption of simvastatin therapy. The gynecomastia in this patient represented a possible adverse effect of atorvastatin according to the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale. The mechanism may be atorvastatin's theoretical suppression of adrenal or gonadal steroid production through effects on cholesterol synthesis. Based on this and other case reports, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) should be considered as a potential cause when evaluating otherwise unexplainable cases of gynecomastia in patients taking these drugs.", 
    "4": "Coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality rates have been decreasing in many industrialized countries since the 1980s. Up to half this decrease can be attributed to evidence-based medical and surgical cardiology interventions. However, recent studies suggest that modern cardiology treatment uptake levels remain disappointingly low in many patient categories.", 
    "5": "To determine the potential for further reductions in CHD mortality in Ireland from increasing the number of eligible patients receiving cardiology treatments.", 
    "6": "A previously validated, cell-based IMPACT CHD mortality model was used to integrate large amounts of data describing CHD patient numbers, and the effectiveness and uptake levels of specific medical and surgical treatments. The CHD mortality reductions potentially achievable through the increased use of specific treatments were then calculated, stratified by age and gender and tested using sensitivity analyses.", 
    "7": "In 2000, medical and surgical coronary disease treatments together prevented or postponed approximately 1950 CHD deaths in the adult population aged 25-84. However, increasing treatment levels to reach 80% of eligible patients might have prevented or postponed a further 2280 CHD deaths in 2000 (minimum estimate 860, maximum estimate 4000). The biggest gain was from maximizing the treatment uptake of eligible heart failure patients, followed by those receiving statins and secondary prevention therapies.", 
    "8": "Many eligible patients are currently not receiving appropriate evidence-based treatments that would reduce CHD mortality and morbidity. Our results suggest that increasing cardiology treatment uptake in Ireland could at least double the current therapeutic reduction in CHD mortality.", 
    "9": "A simple, specific, and sufficiently sensitive liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (negative-ion electrospray ionization) methodology to determine mevalonic acid (MVA) in human plasma is described, and its application to the analysis of rat plasma MVA levels after rosuvastatin administration is demonstrated. The method was validated over the linearity range of 0.5-50.0 ng/ml (r(2) > 0.99) using deuterated MVA as an internal standard. The lower limit of quantification was 0.5 ng/ml. The assay procedure involved the isolation of MVA from plasma samples using solid-phase extraction. Chromatographic separation was achieved on a HyPurity Advance column with a mobile phase consisting of ammonium formate buffer (10 mM, pH 8.0) and acetonitrile (70:30, v/v). Excellent precision and accuracy were observed. MVA and deuterated mevalonolactone were stable in water and plasma under different storage and processing conditions. The recovery observed was low, which was attributable to a significant matrix effect. A significant decrease (30-40%; P < 0.05) was observed in rat plasma MVA levels after rosuvastatin administration.", 
    "10": "Gamma tocopherol (gamma-T) is a recognized peroxynitrite scavenger, reputedly metabolized via the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). In this study, we assessed whether equipotent LDL-lowering doses of statins with or without inhibitory activity on CYP3A4 differently affect gamma-T metabolism. Patients with ATP III criteria for statin use (n=35) were randomly allocated to treatment with simvastatin 20mg/day or pravastatin 40 mg/day. Plasma lipids, alpha-tocopherol (alpha-T), gamma-T as well as the urinary excretion of the gamma-T metabolite 2,7,8-trimethyl-2-(2'carboxyethyl)-6-hydroxychroman (gamma-CEHC), were determined at baseline and after 6 weeks of treatment. Pravastatin and simvastatin equally reduced LDL-C (-42.8+/-2.9 and -42.1+/-3.0%) and alpha-T levels (-17.5+/-4.2 and -12.2+/-4.1%), and increased the alpha-T/LDL-C ratios (51.4+/-14.6 and 60.4+/-15%). Conversely, pravastatin did not affect whereas simvastatin significantly augmented plasma gamma-T levels (22+/-7.9%, p=0.009, between groups p=0.0045). Moreover, the gamma-T/LDL-C ratio increased significantly more with simvastatin than with pravastatin (124+/-23 versus 61.3+/-22.1%, p=0.05 between groups). In addition, pravastatin but not simvastatin increased the urinary excretion of gamma-CEHC (34.3+/-17.3%, p=0.056; between groups p=0.046). In conclusion, simvastatin and pravastatin produced distinct effects on gamma-T metabolism, presumably as a result of different statin-CYP interactions.", 
    "11": "The use of statins has shown several anti-inflammatory actions, including modulatory effects on T cells in vitro. Since the effects on human T cells in vivo are less clarified, our aim was to investigate the effects of simvastatin on human T cells in vivo and ex vivo.", 
    "12": "A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study design was applied. Eighty volunteers with mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia received either simvastatin 40 mg or placebo for 6 weeks. The serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) were significantly reduced by simvastatin. The proportions of CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets expressing early (CD25) or late (HLA-DR) activation markers, as assessed by flow cytometry, were not changed by simvastatin. However, simvastatin tended to increase the density of HLA-DR and L-selectin per CD8+ T cell. The T helper(h)1/Th2 response was evaluated by stimulatory assays followed by intra-cellular staining of interferon-gamma and interleukin-4. Simvastatin treatment did not affect the Th1 response but the results indicated a potential to suppress Th2.", 
    "13": "Simvastatin treatment resulted in a few discrete changes as regards peripheral T cells. However, the findings do not provide evidence that simvastatin-induced anti-inflammatory actions are related to any significant modulatory effects on human T cells in clinically healthy men with hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "14": "MHC class II molecules play central roles in immune recognition and rejection. As statins have been shown to inhibit the production of these molecules, we analyzed the possible immunosuppressive effect of pravastatin, using our rat model of orthotopic lung transplantation.", 
    "15": "Single orthotopic lung transplantation was performed in a Fischer 344-to-Wistar Kyoto strain combination. One group received pravastatin i.p. after transplantation, controls NaCl. Statin serum levels were analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Animals were sacrificed on postoperative day (POD) 14 and 21. At sacrifice, samples were obtained for histology, immunhistochemistry, flow cytometry and real-time RT-PCR analysis of CD25, TNF-alpha, and MHC class II expression. Rejection was graded via histochemistry, using a system based on the working formulation of The International Society of Heart and Lung Transplantation. Immunohistochemistry was performed for expression of MHC class II, T-cell receptor, CD25, CD4/8 cell, NK cells, granulocytes and monocytes in na\u00efve lungs and grafts from donor and recipient animals. Flow cytometric analysis of recipient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was used to analyze expression of CD3, CD4, CD8, and RT1B in both groups. In vitro analyses of MHC class II expression were performed in parallel.", 
    "16": "HPLC confirmed effective delivery of pravastatin. Recipients treated with pravastatin showed significantly less rejection on POD 14 and on POD 21, when compared to controls. Immunohistochemistry showed specific differences, suggesting a delay in rejection in the pravastatin group. Flow cytometric analyses showed a higher expression of CD4 in the control group on POD 21. Results of real-time RT-PCR analyses for MHC class II expression showed a significant decrease in expression in the statin-treated group. Flow cytometric analysis of gamma-IFN stimulated rat PBMC showed an inhibition of upregulation of MHC class II expression by pravastatin in vitro.", 
    "17": "Pravastatin prolongs graft survival in our allogeneic rat model of orthotopic lung transplantation. We assume that the underlying mechanism for this effect is the inhibition of upregulation of MHC class II molecule synthesis, thus blocking downstream effector mechanisms of the immune system.", 
    "18": "Statins, inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, are widely prescribed for their cholesterol-lowering properties to reduce atherogenesis and cardiovascular morbidity. Over recent years, statins have also been shown to exert pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects that might be of therapeutic benefit in autoimmune disorders. The primary mechanism by which statins alter immune function appears to be mediated through the inhibition of post-translational protein prenylation of small GTP-binding proteins and is largely independent of lipid-lowering. In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), the mouse model for multiple sclerosis (MS), statins prevent or reverse paralysis and were recently shown to exert synergistic benefit when combined with agents approved for MS therapy. Based primarily upon the beneficial effects in EAE, statins are now being tested in patients in MS clinical trials.", 
    "19": "Increases in bone formation have been demonstrated in mice and rats treated with statins, a group of molecules that increase the production of bone morphogenetic proteins-2 (BMP2) by stimulating its promoter. However, clinical use of statins (e.g., fluvastatin) is limited by the lack of a suitable delivery system to localize and sustain release. To harness the therapeutic effect of statins in orthopedic applications, a fluvastatin-releasing macromer was synthesized. When copolymerized with a dimethacrylated poly(ethylene glycol) solution, this fluvastatin-containing molecule was covalently incorporated into hydrogel networks, and hydrolysis of lactic acid ester bonds resulted in the release of the pendantly tethered fluvastatin from the hydrogel into the surrounding solution. The rate of fluvastatin release was controlled by the length of lactic acid spacer (2-6 repeats), and the dose was controlled by the initial comonomer composition (5-500 microg fluvastatin/gel). Released fluvastatin increased human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) gene expression of CBFA1, ALP, and COL I by 34-fold, 2.6-fold, and 1.8-fold, respectively, after 14 days of in vitro culture. In addition, treating hMSCs with the released fluvastatin resulted in an average of 2.0- and 1.5-fold greater BMP2 production whereas mineralization increased an average of 3.0-fold and 2.5-fold for 0.01 and 0.1 microM fluvastatin, respectively, over the 2 week culture period. Therefore, fluvastatin-releasing hydrogels may be useful in bone tissue engineering applications, not only for triggering osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs, but also by modulating their function.",

    "21": "Migration experiments were performed using the Dunn chemotaxis chamber. The prooxidant [NAD(P)H oxidase] and antioxidant [NOS, superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase] enzyme activities were determined by specific assays.", 
    "22": "Chemotaxis experiments revealed that while both sets of VSMC migrated towards platelet-derived growth factor-BB (1-50 ng/ml) and angiotensin II (1-50 nM), neither oxidized-LDL (ox-LDL, 25-100 microg/ml) nor native LDL (100 microg/ml) affected chemotaxis in IMA VSMC. However, high dose ox-LDL produced significant chemotaxis in CA VSMC that was inhibited by pravastatin (100 nM), mevastatin (10 nM), losartan (10 nM), enalapril (1 microM), and MnTBAP (a free radical scavenger, 50 microM). Microinjection experiments with isoprenoids i.e. geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP) and farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP) showed distinct involvement of small GTPases in atherogen-induced VSMC migration. Significant increases in antioxidant enzyme activities and nitrite production along with marked decreases in NAD(P)H oxidase activity and O2- levels were determined in IMA versus CA VSMC.", 
    "23": "Enhanced intrinsic antioxidant capacity may confer on IMA VSMC resistance to migration against atherogenic agents. Drugs that regulate ox-LDL or angiotensin II levels also exert antimigratory effects.",

The rates of discontinuation due to treatment-associated AEs appeared comparable between all doses of atorvastatin and placebo (2.1% vs 1.7%). Serious AEs were rare (< or =1.0%) and seldom led to withdrawal. The prevalence of treatment-associated myalgia was low in all treatment groups (< or =1.8%). None of the patients experienced persistent creatine kinase elevations >10-fold the upper limit of normal (x ULN), and no cases of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis were reported.

In-hospital complications and long-term outcomes of patients with hyperlipidemia (cholesterol level > or = 240 mg/dl) undergoing percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) on statins (group Ia, n = 2,052) and not on statins (group Ib, n = 1,650) were compared with 726 patients with lower cholesterol levels (group II). Despite a higher prevalence of co-morbidities and worse angiographic characteristics in patients with hyperlipidemia, patients in group Ia had significantly lower in-hospital mortality (0% vs 2% in the other 2 groups, p < 0.001), a lower increase in the postprocedure creatine kinase-MB fraction (14% vs 27% in group Ib and 28% in group II, p < 0.001), and fewer PCI complications (15% vs 30% in groups Ib and II, p < 0.001). After adjustment, patients in group Ia had a significant decrease in complications (odds ratio 0.72, 95% confidence interval 0.65 to 0.92, p = 0.009). In contrast, those in group Ib had outcomes similar to those of patients with lower cholesterol. After application of propensity analysis to adjust for the likelihood of receiving statins based on clinical, angiographic, and procedural characteristics, group Ia had fewer in-hospital complications (odds ratio 0.75, 95% confidence interval 0.62 to 0.90, p = 0.002) and lower in-hospital mortality (odds ratio 0.32, 95% confidence interval 0.12 to 0.84, p = 0.021). After successful PCI, overall survival after dismissal and survival free of myocardial infarction and target vessel revascularization were similar. In conclusion, hyperlipidemia per se is not associated with lower in-hospital complications after PCI. The benefit is largely limited to patients on statin treatment.",

The present 'viewpoint' article will discuss how the prothrombotic state in HF may be perpetuated by a chronic inflammatory state that is maladaptive. Indeed, there is considerable evidence that thrombogenesis and endothelial (dys)function can be intimately linked to inflammation in HF.", 
    "40": "Hypoxia, which leads to dysfunctional cell metabolism, and complement activation both play central roles in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Recent studies have reported that mice deficient for the complement-inhibitory protein CD59 show enhanced susceptibility to antigen-induced arthritis and reported that statins have anti-inflammatory effects in RA. We hypothesized that the anti-inflammatory effect of statins in RA relates in part to their ability to increase CD59 expression in hypoxic conditions and therefore to reduce complement activation. Flow-cytometric analysis showed that CD59 expression on endothelial cells (EC) was unaffected by atorvastatin in normoxia (21% O2), whereas in hypoxic conditions (1% O2) an up to threefold dose-dependent increase in CD59 expression was seen. This effect of hypoxia was confirmed by treatment of EC with chemical mimetics of hypoxia. The upregulation of CD59 protein expression in hypoxia was associated with an increase in steady-state mRNA. L-Mevalonate and geranylgeraniol reversed the response, confirming a role for inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and geranylgeranylation. Likewise, inhibition by NG-monomethyl-L-arginine and NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester confirmed that CD59 upregulation in hypoxia was nitric oxide dependent. The expression of another complement-inhibitory protein, decay-accelerating factor (DAF), is known to be increased by atorvastatin in normoxia; this response was also significantly enhanced under hypoxic conditions. The upregulation of CD59 and DAF by atorvastatin in hypoxia prevented the deposition of C3, C9 and cell lysis that follows exposure of reoxygenated EC to serum. This cytoprotective effect was abrogated by inhibitory anti-CD59 and anti-DAF mAbs. The modulation of EC CD59 and DAF by statins under hypoxic conditions therefore inhibits both early and late complement activation and may contribute to the anti-inflammatory effects of statins in RA.", 
    "41": "Toll-like receptors (TLRs) form a family of pattern recognition receptors that have emerged as key mediators of innate immunity. These receptors sense invading microbes and initiate the immune response. TLR-mediated inflammation is an important pathogenic link between innate immunity and a diverse panel of clinical disorders. Among the processes in which TLRs play a role are cardiovascular disorders such as cardiac ischaemia, coronary artery disease, ventricular remodelling, cancer angiogenesis or transplant rejection. From these, many important opportunities for disease modification through TLR signalling manipulation can be imagined. Their role as potential targets for therapeutic intervention is just beginning to be appreciated and this article reviews the current status of these treatment strategies for cardiovascular disease.", 
    "42": "Clinical trials have shown that ezetimibe significantly improves lipid profiles when used as monotherapy or in combination with a statin or fibrate. To assess its effect in clinical practice, a retrospective audit of changes in total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) was conducted in 180 hospital outpatients (mean age 57 years, 58% male) who received ezetimibe for at least 4 weeks. When added to existing therapy, (n = 164) mean reductions in TC and LDLC were 19 and 26%, respectively, larger falls occurring in those already on a statin than when on a fibrate or when used as monotherapy. Bigger mean reductions in TC and LDLC (25 and 36%, respectively) were seen in patients already on a statin and fibrate where ezetimibe replaced the fibrate (n = 16). There were a large range of TC and LDLC responses in each treatment group which are likely to relate, at least in part, to individual variability in cholesterol absorption. As expected from the improvement in TC and LDLC, more patients achieved recognised cholesterol targets after ezetimibe use. The response to ezetimibe in routine practice appears to be consistent with that seen in clinical trials.",

Questioning, physical examination, registration of ECG, measurement of levels of total, low density lipoprotein (LDL), high density lipoprotein (HDL) CH, and triglycerides (TG), assessment of endothelium-dependent brachial artery dilation were carried out at baseline and in 3 months. It was noted that 3 months therapy with rosuvastatin exerted positive effect on blood lipid spectrum: lowering of concentration of total CH (-31%, baseline 6.52+/-0.92, after therapy 4.47+/-0.96 mmol/l, p<0.0001), TG (-39%, baseline 2.73+/-1.56, after therapy 1.67+/-0.71 mmol/l, p<0.001), LDLCH (-44%, baseline 4.11+/-0.85, after therapy 2.40+/-0.90 mmol/l, p<0.0001), elevation of HDLCH (+6%, baseline 1.15+/-0.27, after therapy 1.22+/-0.34 mmol/l, p=0.08). Target LDL CH level (<2.6 mmol/l) was achieved in 23 patients (77%). Significant lowering of concentration of C-reactive protein (CRP) (-56%) and interleukin 6 (-25%) was also established. Before beginning of therapy mean flow dependent dilation was 6.1+/-1.64%, after therapy -- 10.4+/-5.0% (p<0.05).

    "48": "Enhanced proliferation of smooth muscle cells contributes to airway remodeling of bronchial asthma. Recently, statins, inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, have been shown to inhibit proliferation of both vascular and airway smooth muscle cells independently of lowering cholesterol. However, the mechanisms remain to be elucidated. The purpose of this study was to determine molecular processes by which statins inhibit proliferation of human bronchial smooth muscle cells. Simvastatin (0.1-1.0 muM) significantly inhibited cell proliferation and DNA synthesis induced by FBS in a concentration-dependent manner. The inhibitory effects of simvastatin were antagonized by mevalonate and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate, whereas the effects were not affected by squalene and farnesylpyrophosphate. The antiproliferative effects of simvastatin were mimicked by GGTI-286, a geranylgeranyltransferase-I inhibitor, C3 exoenzyme, an inhibitor of Rho, and Y-27632, an inhibitor of Rho-kinase, a target protein of RhoA. Western blot analysis showed that the level of membrane localization of RhoA (active Rho) was markedly increased by FBS, and that the level of active RhoA increased by FBS was reduced by simvastatin. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of simvastatin on FBS-induced RhoA activation was also antagonized by geranylgeranylpyrophosphate, but not by farnesylpyrophosphate. Because these isoprenoids are required for prenylation of small G proteins RhoA and Ras, respectively, the present results demonstrate that an inhibition in airway smooth muscle cell proliferation by simvastatin is due to prevention of geranylgeranylation of RhoA, not farnesylation of Ras. Therefore, statins may have therapeutic potential for prohibiting airway remodeling in bronchial asthma.", 
    "49": "The early morphogenetic mechanisms involved in heart formation are evolutionarily conserved. A screen for genes that control Drosophila heart development revealed a cardiac defect in which pericardial and cardial cells dissociate, which causes loss of cardiac function and embryonic lethality. This phenotype resulted from mutations in the genes encoding HMG-CoA reductase, downstream enzymes in the mevalonate pathway, and G protein Ggamma1, which is geranylgeranylated, thus representing an end point of isoprenoid biosynthesis. Our findings reveal a cardial cell-autonomous requirement of Ggamma1 geranylgeranylation for heart formation and suggest the involvement of the mevalonate pathway in congenital heart disease.", 
    "50": "Black rice and its pigment fraction may have antiatherogenic activity, but the exact component contributing to the beneficial effect remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of the anthocyanin-rich extract from black rice on the vulnerability of advanced plaques in apolipoprotein (apo) E-deficient mice. Using LC-MS, the anthocyanin-rich extract from black rice was identified as containing cyanidin-3-glucoside and peonidin-3-glucoside. ApoE-deficient mice (n = 30; 30 wk old) were randomly divided into 3 groups: a control group (fed the AIN-93G diet), the simvastin group [simva; fed the AIN-93G diet containing simvastatin, 50 mg/(kg.d)], or the anthocyanin-rich extract group [antho; fed the AIN-93G diet supplemented with anthocyanin-rich extract from black rice, 300 mg/(kg.d)]. After 20 wk of intervention, the plaque area that developed in the brachiocephalic artery of mice in the antho group was smaller than that of the control mice. Both the antho and simva groups had lower frequencies of the large necrotic core and thin fibrous cap in plaques than the control group. Collagen I was increased and matrix metalloproteinase-1 contents were reduced in the brachiocephalic lesion of both the antho and simva groups compared with the control group. Furthermore, mRNA levels of tissue factor and inducible nitric oxide synthase in aortae were decreased in the antho and simva groups. Supplementation of anthocyanin-rich extract improved the lipid profile by decreasing serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, and non-HDL cholesterol. These results suggest that chronic diet intake of anthocyanin-rich extract from black rice may enhance plaque stabilization in old apoE-deficient mice. The underlying mechanism is related mainly to inhibiting proinflammatory factors and improving the serum lipid profile.", 
    "51": "Mevalonate metabolites play an essential role in transducing epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR)-mediated signaling, as several of these metabolites are required for the function of this receptor and the components of its signaling cascades. Thus, the depletion of mevalonate metabolites may have a significant effect on EGFR function. Lovastatin is a specific and potent inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway. Targeting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase using lovastatin induces a potent tumor-specific apoptotic response in a variety of tumor types at therapeutically achievable levels of this drug. The effects of lovastatin on EGFR function and the potential combination effects with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as gefitinib, were evaluated. Lovastatin treatment inhibited EGF-induced EGFR autophosphorylation and its downstream signaling cascades by 24 hours. Combining lovastatin and gefitinib showed enhanced inhibition and cooperative cytotoxicity in a variety of cell lines that included all eight squamous cell carcinomas, four non-small cell lung carcinoma, and four colon carcinoma cell lines tested. Isobologram analyses confirmed that this combination was synergistic, inducing a potent apoptotic response. A phase I study has shown the safety and potential clinical benefit of high-dose lovastatin in patients with recurrent squamous cell carcinoma. The use of lovastatin, which is metabolized by CYP3A4, is contraindicated with drugs, such as gefitinib and erlotinib, which are also metabolized by CYP3A4 due to greatly enhanced toxicity. Rosuvastatin, a relatively novel potent mevalonate pathway inhibitor that is not metabolized significantly by CYP3A4, is a more appropriate statin to combine with either erlotinib or gefitinib. The combination of erlotinib and rosuvastatin has been proposed for a phase I/II study in advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma.",

However, sub-group analysis on the basis of statin use showed that the highest rise was in the group of patients with RIPC not taking statins and was significantly greater than in patients with RIPC taking statins (23.8 (3.71) v 11.4 (3.0) mg/l, respectively, p<0.01).

Thirty-six New Zealand male rabbits were randomly divided into low-cholesterol group (LC), high-cholesterol group (HC), high-cholesterol+simvastatin group (HC+S) and then were fed for 12 weeks. At the end of the experiment, standard enzymatic assays, electrophoretic mobility shiftassay (EMSA), immunohistochemical staining, and morphometry were performed to observe serum lipids, NF-kappaB-DNA binding activity, MCP-1 protein expression, intima thickness and plaque area of aorta respectively in all three groups. Our results showed that the serum lipids, NF-kappaB-DNA binding activity, expression of MCP-1 protein, intima thickness, and plaque area of aorta in the LC and HC+S groups were significantly lower than those in the HC group (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in the serum lipids between the LC and HC+S groups (P>0.05), but the NF-kappaB-DNA binding activity, the expression of MCP-1 protein and the intima thickness and plaque area of aorta in the HC+S group were significantly decreased as compared to the LC group (P<0.05). This study demonstrated that simvastatin could decrease atherosclerosis by inhibiting the NF-kappaB-DNA binding activity and by reducing the expression of MCP-1 protein.", 
    "57": "Statins are effective drugs for lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and their use has been associated with a significant decrease in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, statins are ineffective in lowering plasma triglycerides and lipoprotein(a), or increasing low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) plasma levels, which are independent risk factors for coronary heart disease. Niacin, on the other hand, is the most potent drug available for lowering plasma levels of triglycerides and lipoprotein(a) and raising HDL-C levels. It follows, then, that a combination of niacin with a statin might be an effective combination in improving all components of the lipid profile. Previous studies have shown that the use of long-acting niacin with a statin, in dose combinations of niacin-ER/lovastatin 1,000/20 mg or 2,000/40 mg once daily, has been effective in favorably modifying low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, lipoprotein(a), and HDL-C plasma levels. Dyslipidemias often predate the onset of hypertension, and HDL-C has been found to be inversely related to the incidence of hypertension. Normalization of lipid components, including the total cholesterol/HDL-C ratio, is important in the management of hypertensive individuals and patients with the metabolic syndrome or diabetes. Thus, the long-term treatment of dyslipidemias with these two agents may help to modify risk and reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in these patients over and above benefits achieved by lowering blood pressure.",

This article uses three typical case history presentations to review the most recent clinical trial data and guidelines on statin therapy to provide practical guidance on clinical decision making for lipid-lowering therapy in the geriatric population.", 
    "59": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitors decrease cardiovascular morbidity in diabetic patients, but the mechanism is unclear. We studied the actions of simvastatin (SIM) in enhancing NO bioavailability and reducing oxidative stress in coronary vessels from diabetic rats and in rat coronary artery endothelial cells (RCAEC) exposed to high glucose. Coronary arteries isolated from diabetic rats showed decreases in acetylcholine (ACh)-mediated maximal relaxation from 81.0 +/- 4.5% in controls to 43.5 +/- 7.6% at 4 weeks and 22.3 +/- 0.6% at 10 weeks of diabetes. This effect was associated with oxidative stress in coronary vessels as shown by dichlorofluorescein (DCF) imaging and nitrotyrosine labeling. Diabetes also reduced trans-coronary uptake of [(3)H]l-arginine. Supplemental l-arginine (50 mg/kg/day p.o.) did not improve coronary vasorelaxation to ACh. However, SIM treatment (5 mg/kg/day subcutaneously) improved maximal ACh relaxation to 65.8 +/- 5.1% at 4 weeks and 47.1 +/- 3.9% at 10 weeks. Coronary arteries from rats treated with both SIM and l-arginine demonstrated the same maximal relaxation to ACh (66.1 +/- 3%) as SIM alone. Mevalonate and l-NAME (N(omega)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride) inhibited the response to ACh in SIM-treated diabetic rats. Coronary arteries from all groups relaxed similarly to sodium nitroprusside. SIM increased endothelial NO synthase protein levels and blocked diabetes-induced increases in DCF and nitrotyrosine labeling in diabetic coronary vessels. SIM treatment restored normal NO levels in media from high-glucose-treated RCAEC and plasma of diabetic rat. Treatment with SIM or the NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin also blocked high-glucose-induced increases in reactive oxygen species and superoxide formation in RCAEC. Taken together, these data suggest that SIM improves diabetes-induced coronary dysfunction by reducing oxidative stress and increasing NO bioavailability.",

Chronic use of high doses of COX-2 inhibitors may induce side effects, and combining the low doses of agents may be an effective way to increase their efficacy and minimize the side effects. We assessed the chemopreventive efficacy of atorvastatin (Lipitor) and celecoxib individually or in combination in an animal model of familial adenomatous polyposis. Six-week-old male C57BL/6J-APCmin/+ mice were either fed diets containing 0 or 100 ppm atorvastatin or 300 ppm celecoxib, or a combination of both for approximately 80 days. Mice were sacrificed, and their intestines were scored for tumors. Normal-seeming mucosa and intestinal tumors were harvested and assayed for apoptosis (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick-end labeling) and HMGR and COX-2 protein expression and activity. We observed that 100 ppm atorvastatin significantly (P < 0.002) suppressed intestinal polyp formation. As anticipated, 300 ppm celecoxib decreased the rate of formation of intestinal polyps by approximately 70% (P < 0.0001). Importantly, the combination of 100 ppm atorvastatin and 300 ppm celecoxib in the diet suppressed the colon polyps completely and small intestinal polyps by >86% (P < 0.0001) compared with the control group. The inhibition of tumor formation by the atorvastatin and celecoxib combination was significant (P < 0.005) when compared with tumor inhibition by celecoxib alone. In addition, increased rates of apoptosis in intestinal tumors (P < 0.01-0.0001) were observed in animals fed with atorvastatin and celecoxib and more so with the combinations. Tumors of animals fed atorvastatin showed a significant decrease in HMGR-R activity. Similarly, tumors of mice exposed to celecoxib showed significantly lower levels of COX-2 activity. These observations show that atorvastatin inhibits intestinal tumorigenesis and that, importantly, when given together with low doses of celecoxib, it significantly increases the chemopreventive efficacy in an APC(min) mice.",

Baseline characteristics between the two groups were compared by chi-square and Wilcoxon rank sum tests for discrete and continuous variables. The effects of statin use on outcomes after EVAR were analyzed by multivariate regression models. Of the 5,892 patients enrolled in the EUROSTAR registry, 731 (12.4%) patients used statins for hyperlipidemia. Statin users were younger, were more obese, and had a higher prevalence of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension. After 5 years of follow-up, the cumulative survival rate was 77% for nonusers of statin versus 81% for statin users (p = .005). After adjustment for age and other risk factors, statin use was still an independent predictor of improved survival (p = .03).

The meta-analysis showed that significantly more patients receiving rosuvastatin 10 mg achieved the 2003 European LDL-C goals compared with those who received atorvastatin 10 mg or simvastatin 20 mg (p < 0.001 for both comparisons). A significantly greater proportion of patients receiving rosuvastatin 10 mg also achieved the 2003 European total cholesterol goal compared with those on atorvastatin 10 mg (p < 0.001).", 
    "90": "The meta-analysis showed that rosuvastatin was more effective than comparator statins at lowering LDL-C levels and enabling patients to achieve lipid goals at recommended start doses. In addition, all statins studied were well tolerated and confirmed that rosuvastatin had a similar safety profile to other statins.", 
    "91": "In a 24-week, open-label, randomized, parallel-group study, we compared the efficacy and metabolic effects, beyond low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)-lowering, of atorvastatin (ATV) and rosuvastatin (RSV) in cardiovascular disease-free subjects with primary hyperlipidaemia, treated to an LDL-C target (130 mg/dL).", 
    "92": "After a 6-week dietary lead-in period, patients were randomized to RSV 10 mg/day (n = 60) or ATV 20 mg/day (n = 60). After 6 weeks on treatment the dose of the statin was increased (to RSV 20 mg/day or ATV 40 mg/day) if the treatment goal was not achieved. A control group of healthy volunteers (n = 60) was also included for the validation of baseline serum and urinary laboratory parameters. The primary outcome was the percentage of patients reaching the LDL-C goal; secondary outcomes were changes in lipid and non-lipid metabolic parameters.", 
    "93": "A total of 45 patients (75.0%) in the RSV-treated group and 43 (71.7%) in the ATV-treated group achieved the treatment target at the initial dose. Both regimens were generally well tolerated and there were no withdrawals due to treatment-related serious adverse events. Similar significant reductions in total cholesterol, LDL-C, apolipoprotein (apo) B, triglycerides, apoB/apoA1 ratio, fibrinogen and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels were seen. RSV had a significant high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C)-raising effect and showed a trend towards increasing apoA1 levels.

    "100": "In the last decade, statins became widely used drugs in hypercholesterolemia treatment. Several studies have demonstrated that statins may also be successfully administered in the treatment of osteoporosis. There are, however, no reports regarding the effect of statins on heterotopic ossification (HO). In this paper, we examined the influence of fluvastatin on heterotopically induced bone formation in mice. HO was induced by implantation of rat-derived demineralized bone matrix (DBM) into intramuscular pockets in CFW mice. Mice in the experimental groups received fluvastatin at 3.6 mg/kg per day for 25 consecutive days whilst mice in the control group received placebo. Twenty five days after DBM implantation blood samples were collected to measure total serum cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity. Mass of mineral deposited in the induced ossicle was established after hydrolysis of soft tissues surrounding the induced ossicles. In fluvastatin-treated mice, the mass of mineral deposited in heterotopically induced ossicles and AP serum concentration were significantly increased while TG and TC concentrations were decreased, when compared to mice receiving placebo. These results show that administration of statins, in some instances, may affect heterotopic ossification and that during hypocholesterolemic treatment of patients with predisposition to HO, following hip arthroplasty, such treatment may increase risk of HO.", 
    "101": "The aim of this study was to assess how cerivastatin influences contractility and degree of myocardial damage in papillary muscle subjected to hypoxia-reoxygenation in hypercholesterolemic guinea pigs. Study group consisted of guinea pigs, fed standard, hypercholesterolemic or hypercholesterolemic diets with low dose of cerivastatin. During experimental hypoxia-reoxygenation, the contractility was measured. Apoptosis of cardiomioctes was assessed with the use of TUNEL technique. Total cholesterol in standard, hypercholesterolemic and cerivastatin-treated group was 35 +/- 8 mg/dl, 131.6 +/- 30.4 mg/dl and 121.2 +/- 26.2 mg/dl, respectively, and was significantly higher in rats fed hypercholesterolemic and hypercholesterolemic + cerivastatin diets than in control group (p < 0.01). There were no significant differences between all analyzed groups in the post-ischemic cardiac function. Percentage of apoptotic cells after hypoxia-reoxygenation injury in groups fed standard, hypercholesterolemic and hypercholesterolemic + cerivastatin diets was 30 +/- 8%, 20 +/- 4% and 5 +/- 7%, respectively, and was significantly lower in groups that received hypercholesterolmic (p < 0.01) and hypercholesterolemic + cerivastatin (p < 0.001) diets in comparison with standard diet-fed group. In the group treated with cerivastatin, the percentage of apoptotic cells was additionally lower in comparison with hypercholesterolemic group (p < 0.01). Negative correlation between percentage of apoptotic cells and HDL level was found when all groups were considered jointly (r = -0.41, p < 0.05). Our study clearly shows that cerivastatin in hypercholesterolemic animals and hypercholesterolemia itself limit cardiomiocyte damage after hypoxia-reoxygenation.",

    "103": "3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors increase endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity by multiple mechanisms. We previously reported that genetic overexpression of eNOS improves survival and cardiac function in congestive heart failure (CHF). In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that low-dose treatment with an 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor exerts beneficial effects on survival and/or cardiac function in a murine model of CHF. Mice were subjected to permanent ligation of the left coronary artery and randomized to receive either saline vehicle or simvastatin (0.25 mg/kg) 2 h after myocardial infarction and daily (0.25 mg/kg) for 7 days, followed by 21 days of administration every other day for a total duration of 28 days. Myocardial infarct size was not reduced by simvastatin therapy (P = not significant between groups). Simvastatin treatment did significantly (P < 0.05) improve survival (45%) compared with vehicle treatment (25%). In addition, simvastatin treatment significantly improved (P < 0.01) left ventricular function and significantly (P < 0.01) abrogated cardiac hypertrophy and pulmonary edema compared with vehicle treatment. The protective effects of simvastatin were abrogated by delayed initiation of treatment or genetic ablation of eNOS. In conclusion, low-dose simvastatin therapy significantly improves survival and cardiac function and reduces both cardiac hypertrophy and pulmonary edema via an eNOS-dependent mechanism in a murine model of CHF.", 
    "104": "Reactive oxygen species-scavenging enzyme Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) regulated by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) plays an important role in vascular responsiveness. However, it remains unknown whether statin restores vascular dysfunction through the activation of reactive oxygen species-scavenging enzymes in vivo. We hypothesized that pitavastatin restores vascular function by modulating oxidative stress through the activation of Cu/ZnSOD and PPAR-gamma in hypercholesterolemia. New Zealand White male rabbits were fed either normal chow or a 1% cholesterol (CHO) diet for 14 wk. After the first 7 wk, the CHO-fed rabbits were further divided into three groups: those fed with CHO feed only (HC), those additionally given pitavastatin, and those additionally given an antioxidant, probucol. The extent of atherosclerosis was assessed by examining aortic stiffness. When compared with the HC group, both the pitavastatin and probucol groups showed improved aortic stiffness by reducing aortic levels of reactive oxidative stress, nitrotyrosine, and collagen, without affecting serum cholesterol or blood pressure levels. Pitavastatin restored both Cu/ZnSOD activity (P < 0.005) and PPAR-gamma expression and activity (P < 0.01) and inhibited NAD(P)H oxidase activity (P < 0.0001) in the aorta, whereas probucol inhibited NAD(P)H oxidase activity more than did pitavastatin (P < 0.0005) without affecting Cu/ZnSOD activity or PPAR-gamma expression and activity. Importantly, Cu/ZnSOD activity was positively correlated with the PPAR-gamma activity in the aorta (P < 0.005), both of which were negatively correlated with aortic stiffness (P < 0.05). Vascular Cu/ZnSOD and PPAR-gamma may play a crucial role in the antiatherogenic effects of pitavastatin in hypercholesterolemia in vivo.", 
    "105": "Increased concentrations of particles in air have been related to changes in inflammatory markers that in turn are hypothesized in mediating the particle effects on cardiovascular disease. The present work examined this association in an elderly cohort in the Greater Boston area and addresses the relative role of particles from different sources.",

    "107": "Positive associations were found between traffic-related particles (PN and BC) and inflammatory markers, but only suggestive associations were found with exposures to PM(2.5) and sulphates. The particle effect on the inflammatory markers was greater among subjects older than 78 years and among obese. A suggestion for a greater effect of particles on inflammatory markers among GSTM1-null subjects and non-users of statin drugs was also seen.",

    "109": "Metastasis to the skeleton frequently occurs in breast carcinoma patients resulting in different skeletal-related events including pain, hypercalcemia, pathological fracture, and spinal cord or nerve root compression. Bisphosphonates are class of agents most frequently used to reduce skeletal-related events in patients with bone metastases by inhibiting osteoclast activity through inhibition of mevolanate pathway which is also important in cholesterol synthesis. Statins are cholesterol lowering agents and inhibit the same pathway. Therefore statins may also reduce skeletal-related events in breast cancer patients with bone metastases by inhibiting osteoclastic activity.", 
    "110": "Insulin can generate oxygen free radicals. Statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, exert a powerful antioxidant effect. The present study aimed to clarify the mechanisms through which insulin generates free radicals and to assess whether pravastatin modulates such effects. In cultured skin fibroblasts from human volunteers exposed to high insulin concentration, either in the presence or in the absence of pravastatin, insulin induced translocation of the p47(phox) subunit of NAD(P)H oxidase from the cytosol to the membrane and generation of radical oxygen species through a PKC delta-dependent mechanism. The insulin-induced translocation of p47(phox) was PKC delta dependent and attenuated by pravastatin, but independent of the activation of Akt and Rac1. Insulin-induced Akt phosphorylation was increased by pravastatin and ERK1/2 phosphorylation attenuated. The present study demonstrates a novel mechanism by which insulin stimulates the generation of free radicals in human fibroblasts, ex vivo. It involves phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, PKC delta, and p47(phox) translocation and promotes ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Pravastatin inhibited radical oxygen species production by inhibiting PKC delta. These observations offer a robust explanation for the positive effects of pravastatin treatment in patients with insulin resistance syndrome.",

In this study, we demonstrated that angiotensin II preferentially increased the expression of alpha1G, a T-type Ca2+ channel subunit, via AT1 receptors in endothelial cells. Angiotensin II-induced expression of alpha1G was inhibited by pretreatment with atorvastatin and the MEK1/2 inhibitor, PD98059. The effect of atorvastatin was reversed by mevalonate and farnesyl pyrophosphate which implicates the activation of the small GTP-binding protein, Ras. Our data indicate that angiotensin II induces alpha1G expression in endothelial cells via AT1 receptors, Ras and MEK. Angiotensin II-induced migration of endothelial cells in a wound healing model was inhibited by incubation with mibefradil, a T-type Ca2+ channel blocker. Our data indicate that angiotensin II induces T-type Ca2+ channels in endothelial cells, which may play a role in the development of vascular disorders.",

However, the effects of hyperlipidemia on hepatic proteins have barely been studied. Antithrombin is a hepatic serpin with anticoagulant and anti-inflammatory roles. The conformational flexibility of antithrombin renders it susceptible to both, genetic and posttranslational modifications. Thus, mutations and environmental factors have been shown to alter this molecule.",

Accordingly, a decrease in circulating antithrombin activity (48.71 +/- 6.35%) was observed. Other hepatic proteins, including heparin cofactor II, another anticoagulant serpin, also accumulated intracellularly. Atorvastatin and reversion to a normal diet after 3 months partially protected livers from these deleterious effects.",

Overall vascular function is dependent upon a fine balance between oxidant and antioxidant mechanisms which is required, at least in part, for proper functioning of the endothelium. Considerable experimental and clinical data indicate that the intracellular oxidant milieu is also involved in several redox-sensitive cellular signaling pathways, such as ion transport systems, protein phosphorylation, and gene expression and thus also plays important roles as modulator of vascular cell function, such as cell growth, apoptosis, migration, angiogenesis and cell adhesion. Overproduction of ROS under pathophysiologic conditions is integral in the development of vascular disease. This fact stimulated an intensive search of new pharmacological approaches to improve vascular hemeostasis and, particularly those intended to decrease oxidative stress or augment the antioxidant defense mechanisms.",

People with pre-existent vascular disease are those at highest risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes and require aggressive secondary preventive therapies. Large strides have been made in the development of pharmacologic agents that intervene on various pathways implicated in atherogenesis, thus offering the ability to greatly impact on disease progression and to prevent events. Compelling data derived primarily from randomized controlled trials have shown the benefits of aspirin (or antiplatelet agents) and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (A), beta-blockers and blood pressure (B) and cholesterol-lowering drugs (C), particularly statins, in preventing recurrent events and improving survival. Taken together these data are the foundation for the simple, but important advice for secondary prevention - the ABCs. In addition, the evidence for the central role of lifestyle factors as determinants of risk has lead to increased efforts towards developing interventions aimed at modifying lifestyle patterns. Today, the biggest challenge remains in the implementation of proven effective therapies. Our focus should turn to educating physicians and patients alike regarding available therapies and their indications. In addition systematic, sustainable and globally applicable approaches to the secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases need to be developed to truly realize the vast potential benefits of existing therapies.", 
    "127": "The prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM), particularly Type 2 DM, has rapidly increased in industrialized and many developing countries. The predominant cause of death in diabetic patients is vascular complications. Dyslipidemia and hypercholesterolemia are common in diabetic patients. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) were designed for lowering cholesterol synthesis. Landmark clinical trials indicated that statins effectively reduced cardiac death and events in patients with coronary artery disease or DM. The benefits of statins on the prevention of vascular events were independent from age, sex or baseline lipid levels in diabetic patients. Statins not only prevent atherosclerotic macrovascular complications, but also postpone the development of microvascular complications of DM, such as nephropathy and retinopathy. The non-cholesterol lowering or pleiotropic effects of statins have attracted vast attention. Results from experimental and clinical studies suggest that statins may attenuate inflammation, oxidative stress, coagulation, platelet aggregation, and improve insulin resistance, fibrinolysis and endothelial functions and help to prevent thrombosis, restenosis or organ transplantation rejection. Statins may affect the intracellular prenylation of proteins, which modulate the activity of small-GTP binding proteins. This may be an underlying mechanism for some pleiotropic effects of statins. Statins have an excellent safety profile and seldom cause adverse effects. Increasing evidence suggests that statins are the current treatment of choice to prevent vascular complications in diabetic patients with hypercholesterolemia.",

This was based on an unusual solvent combination of water/methanol vs. methanol/acetone/n-hexane applied on a Purospher Star RP-18e (125 x 2 mm, 3 microm) column, which proved excellent for the separation, identification and quantification of plasma sterols. Simple solid-phase extraction preparation of plasma samples was performed, followed by the developed fast and robust HPLC separation. Results on four groups of people were compared, those with low, normal and high plasma cholesterol levels and those with high cholesterol levels on statin therapy, and the results were evaluated using linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Variable selection for LDA was achieved using backward removal selection. Highly discriminatory variables were the ratios of desmosterol to sitosterol and of lathosterol to total plasma cholesterol. The latter ratio was also excellent for distinguishing subjects on statin therapy. The success rate of classification was 100%. The present pilot study shows the potential of HPLC/MS analysis and chemometrics for studying cholesterol-related disorders and warrants future full-scale medical study.",

The organic layer was separated and evaporated under a gentle stream of nitrogen at 40 degrees C. The chromatographic separation was performed on an Atlantis C18 column (2.1 mm x 150 mm, 5.0 microm) with a mobile phase consisting of 0.2% formic acid/methanol (30:70, v/v) at a flow rate of 0.20 mL/min. The analyses were carried out by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) using the precursor-to-product combinations of m/z 482 --> 258 and m/z 370 --> 288. The areas of peaks from the analyte and the IS were used for quantification of rosuvastatin. The method was validated according to the FDA guidelines on bioanalytical method validation. Validation results indicated that the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was 0.2 ng/mL and the assay exhibited a linear range of 0.2-50.0 ng/mL and gave a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.9991 or better. Quality control samples (0.4, 8, 25 and 40 ng/mL) in six replicates from three different runs of analysis demonstrated an intra-assay precision (RSD) 7.97-15.94%, an inter-assay precision 3.19-15.27%, and an overall accuracy (relative error) of < 3.7%.

This review considers the mechanism of action of statins in PAD. Statins have been shown to reduce the incidence of new coronary events in patients with PAD. However, surveys suggest that many such patients remain undertreated. Statins can also increase walking distance in patients with PAD. There is also evidence that statins can improve renal function in these patients. Several other actions of statins are considered in this review. PAD patients have an increased morbidity and mortality, largely due to myocardial infarction and stroke.

The choice concerns the transparency of the decision-making process (evidence based medicine), and mistrust of the methods used in cost-effectiveness analysis. Medicare's policy of paying for any medical advance that has positive benefits, regardless of its costs, is un-sustainable. Cost-effectiveness information may assume a more important role in future coverage decisions with regard to outpatient prescription drugs, but at the private level, rather than at the national one. Functional equivalence of drugs reflects a reference-pricing technique applied to a therapeutic category--reimbursement for compounds of similar efficacy within a therapeutic class set to the lowest-priced product in the class. Essentially, a standard of functional equivalence applies a cost-effectiveness principle: assuming that alternative interventions are equivalent, one should not pay more for one of them.",

The chromatographic run time was less than 20 min using flow gradient (0.0-1.60 mL/min) with a mobile phase consisting of 0.01 M ammonium acetate:acetonitrile:methanol (50:40:10, v/v/v) and UV detection at 275 nm. Nominal retention times of RST, GFZ and IS were 6.7, 13.9 and 16.4 min, respectively. Absolute recovery of both analytes and IS was greater than 90%. The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of RST and GFZ was 0.03 and 0.30 microg/mL, respectively. Linearity was excellent (r(2) = 0.999) in the 0.03-10 microg/mL and 0.3-100 microg/mL ranges for RST and GFZ, respectively. The inter- and intra-day precisions in the measurement of RST quality control (QC) samples 0.03, 0.09, 2.50 and 8.00 microg/mL were in the range 2.37-9.78% relative standard deviation (RSD) and 0.92-10.08% RSD, respectively. Similarly, the inter- and intra-day precisions in the measurement of GFZ quality control (QC) samples 0.30, 0.90, 25.0 and 80.0 microg/mL were in the ranges 2.79-6.27 and 0.96-9.69% RSD, respectively. Accuracies in the measurement of QC samples for RST and GFZ were in the range 85.43-107.23 and 84.98-102.35% respectively, of the nominal values. RST and GFZ were stable in the array of stability studies viz., bench-top, auto-sampler and freeze-thaw cycles. Stability of RST and GFZ was established for 1 month at -80C. The application of the assay in an oral pharmacokinetic study in rats co-administered with RST and GFZ is described.", 
    "139": "To examine whether heart failure patients' awareness of the purpose and side effects of their medicines equips them to participate in informed discussions about treatments.", 
    "140": "Qualitative interviews using a maximum variation sample were collected. Interviews were analysed using constant comparison.", 
    "141": "Patients were interviewed throughout the UK, in 2003. Participants. Thirty-seven men and women with heart failure aged between 35 and 85 years.", 
    "142": "All groups understood that medication was important and had developed methods (dosette boxes, alarm clocks) to cope. Three levels of awareness were identified. People at Level 1 did not know the purpose or possible side effects of their medication; those at Level 2 knew the names and main side effects and relied on doctors to provide detailed information. People at Level 3 understood their diagnosis and were committed to finding out about their illness.", 
    "143": "Knowledge is not the only barrier to informed discussions of heart failure. Although everyone we interviewed knew that they should adhere to their medication regimes, only patients at Level 3 were equipped to discuss their treatment in detail. Patients need to be familiar with symptoms of heart failure, the purpose and side effects of their drugs. Medication reviews and specialist heart failure nurses offer opportunities to improve patients' understanding.", 
    "144": "While statin treatment may transiently mobilize endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), the dose-dependent effects of a continuous statin therapy on EPCs in patients with chronic coronary artery disease (CAD) have not been analyzed. In 209 patients with angiographically documented CAD, 144 of which received 10-40 mg/day of statins for >8 weeks, the EPC number was determined by flow cytometry directly (CD34(+)/KDR(+), n=58) and after in vitro-culture (1,1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethylindocarbocyanine-labeled Ac-LDL (DiI-Ac-LDL(+))/lectin(+), n=209). EPC function was assessed by the formation of colony forming units (CFUs). Univariate analysis revealed that the dose of continuous statin therapy inversely correlated with the EPC number. Treatment with 40 mg/day significantly reduced EPC counts. Multivariate analysis unveiled the statin dose and extent of CAD as independent predictors of reduced EPC numbers. Conversely, obesity predicted increased counts, while CFU development was not detectable in all patients and augmented in females and smokers but not in statin-treated patients. Compared with matched controls, statin-treated patients showed significantly reduced absolute and relative EPC counts. In a prospective analysis, initiation of statin therapy significantly diminished the number of circulating and isolated EPCs after 3 but not after 1 month(s). Thus, the statin dose during chronic and continuous treatment independently predicts reduced numbers of circulating as well as isolated EPCs in patients with CAD.", 
    "145": "Transient ischemia has been shown to damage the basal lamina of the cerebral microvasculature. Other studies proved statins to be beneficial to non-cerebral microvessels. The aim of this study was to determine whether pravastatin pretreatment ameliorates microvascular basal lamina damage following transient ischemia. Using the suture model, we subjected 15 rats to focal ischemia (3 h) and reperfusion (24 h). Rats received pravastatin (20 mg/kg/day) or saline for 4 weeks prior to the experiment. The outcome was determined by a behavior test and the infarct size. Collagen type IV, a marker for an intact basal lamina, and hemoglobin extravasation were measured by Western blot analysis. A ratio (in percentage) between ischemic and contralateral hemispheres was calculated. Pravastatin pretreatment resulted in a significantly better neurological outcome and reduced infarct size (15 +/- 0.5 and 59 +/- 10 mm(3), respectively) compared with controls (12.25 +/- 0.4 and 167 +/- 13 mm(3), respectively, P < 0.01 for both). In controls, loss of collagen type IV was seen in the basal ganglia and in the cortex (43 +/- 4 and 64 +/- 5%, respectively). Pravastatin prevented significant collagen loss (basal ganglia: 106 +/- 17%; cortex: 112 +/- 14%, P < 0.01 for both) and significantly reduced the hemoglobin extravasation compared with controls in the basal ganglia (198 +/- 49 vs. 553 +/- 47%, P < 0.01). Pravastatin pretreatment resulted in a reduction of microvascular basal lamina damage and hemoglobin extravasation following transient ischemia. Pravastatin seems to protect the cerebral microvascular system.", 
    "146": "While fatty liver disease is a well-characterized entity, it is currently getting a completely new image. Its treatment is clearly an interdisciplinary challenge. The number of patients with fatty liver disease will be by no means negligible. The issue of fatty liver disease is not infrequently referred to in association with statin therapy instituted in an effort to treat metabolic syndrome and to reduce cardiovascular risks as part of preventive therapy. The attention focused on the increase in alanin aminotransferase levels during statin therapy is absolutely inadequate. The study includes an overview of the topic showing the induced rise in alanin aminotransferase is merely an accompanying phenomenon, mostly of no clinical relevance. An acceptable increase in alanin aminotransferase should not provide a reason for statin withdrawal in the usual spectrum of patients with metabolic syndrome and fatty liver disease. A distinct advantage is cooperation among a hepatologist, a cardiologist, and a diabetes expert.", 
    "147": "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of mortality in patients with renal failure, accounting for more than 50% of deaths in end-stage renal disease. Risk factor modification with the use of cardioprotective medications such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs), beta-adrenergic antagonists (beta-blockers), acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) has been shown to reduce mortality in the general population.", 
    "148": "To determine the extent of use of these medications in a hemodialysis population.", 
    "149": "This was a cross-sectional study of a cohort of 185 prevalent hemodialysis patients. The inclusion criterion was dialysis dependence and there were no exclusion criteria. Data collection was by chart review. Contraindications to individual medication classes were not obtained.", 
    "150": "There were 185 patients enrolled, the mean age was 63.42+/-15.1 years and 126 (68.1%) were male. Sixty-six (35.7%) patients had diabetes and 89 (48.1%) patients had established coronary artery disease (CAD). Forty-six (24.9%) patients were on ACEIs or angiotensin II receptor blockers, 59 (31.9%) were on beta-blockers, 70 (37.8%) were on ASA and 84 (45.4%) were on statins. Although these medications were used in fewer than 60% of patients, those with CAD were more likely to be prescribed an ACEI or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (P=0.026), a beta-blocker (P<0.001), ASA (P<0.001) or a statin (P=0.001) than those without CAD. There were no differences in the use of these medications between diabetic and nondiabetic patients.", 
    "151": "Many hemodialysis patients are not prescribed cardioprotective medications. Given the high cardiovascular mortality in this high-risk population, more attention to reducing cardiovascular risk is warranted.", 
    "152": "Large-scale clinical trials have established that statin use for lowering blood cholesterol is beneficial in reducing atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases in different populations. However, the general reputation of statins seems to be clouded by a potential adverse effect of a class of statins on glucose metabolism. This paper reviewed clinical data of statins regarding the effects on diabetes mellitus and glucose metabolism. At least five randomized controlled studies, primarily investigating the protective effect of statins on the risk of cardiovascular diseases, have addressed the effect of statins on glucose metabolism in Western countries. One study showed that pravastatin (40 mg/day) was protective against the development of diabetes mellitus. Two studies of atorvastatin (10 mg/day) and one study of simvastatin (40 mg/day) showed no measurable effect of these regimens on the risk of diabetes mellitus or the clinical course of diabetes mellitus. One study of atorvastatin (80 mg/day) versus pravastatin (40 mg/day) suggested a deterioration of glucose metabolism associated with a high dose of atorvastatin. In Japan, a few case reports have noted a potential adverse effect of atorvastatin on glycemic control in patients with diabetes mellitus; however, seven clinical trials have showed no such effect of atorvastatin although these studies were relatively small in size and short in follow-up. Only one of the two observational studies suggested a possible adverse effect of atorvastatin on glycemic control. Evidence is extremely limited regarding atorvastatin use and deterioration in glycemic control, and further studies are needed to draw a conclusion on this issue.", 
    "153": "Randomized trials with statins have shown a modest but significant absolute reduction in the incidence of stroke in patients with a previous myocardial infarction. The reasons for the positive statin effect on stroke endpoint are unclear, because a link between serum cholesterol level and stroke never has been established. However, positive results of statin trials were mainly obtained in patients with an average or a low serum cholesterol level. Statins have a good overall safety profile. Statins reduced stroke incidence in high-risk (mainly coronary heart disease, diabetics, and hypertensives) population even with a normal baseline blood cholesterol level. In patients with prior strokes, statins reduce the incidence of coronary events, but it is not yet proven if drugs of this class actually reduce the incidence of recurrent strokes in terms of secondary prevention."
