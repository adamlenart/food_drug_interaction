Patients were sampled with replacement (bootstrapping) to match the US epidemiologic distribution and entered into a Monte Carlo simulation (simulation cohort) that applied stepwise treatment intensification algorithms in those with LDL-C levels of at least 70 mg/dL. All patients not initially receiving a statin were given atorvastatin, 20 mg, and the following LLT intensification steps were applied: uptitration to atorvastatin, 80 mg; add-on ezetimibe therapy; add-on alirocumab therapy, 75 mg (a PCSK9 inhibitor); and uptitration to alirocumab, 150 mg. Sensitivity analyses included evolocumab as a PCSK9 inhibitor. Efficacy was estimated from published studies and incorporated patient-level variation.

    "11": "Hypercholesterolemia and hypertension are among the most important risk factors for cardiovascular (CV) disease. They are also important contributors to metabolic diseases including diabetes that further increase CV risk. Updated guidelines emphasize targeted reduction of overall CV risks but do not explicitly incorporate potential adverse metabolic outcomes that also influence CV health. Hypercholesterolemia and hypertension have synergistic deleterious effects on interrelated insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction. Dysregulation of the renin-angiotensin system is an important pathophysiological mechanism linking insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction to atherogenesis. Statins are the reference standard treatment to prevent CV disease in patients with hypercholesterolemia. Statins work best for secondary CV prevention. Unfortunately, most statin therapies dose-dependently cause insulin resistance, increase new onset diabetes risk and exacerbate existing type 2 diabetes mellitus. Pravastatin is often too weak to achieve target low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels despite having beneficial metabolic actions. Renin-angiotensin system inhibitors improve both endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance in addition to controlling blood pressure. In this regard, combined statin-based and renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitor therapies demonstrate additive/synergistic beneficial effects on endothelial dysfunction, insulin resistance, and other metabolic parameters in addition to lowering both cholesterol levels and blood pressure. This combined therapy simultaneously reduces CV events when compared to either drug type used as monotherapy. This is mediated by both separate and interrelated mechanisms. Therefore, statin-based therapy combined with RAS inhibitors is important for developing optimal management strategies in patients with hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, or obesity. This combined therapy can help prevent or treat CV disease while minimizing adverse metabolic consequences.",

This is a retrospective post-hoc analysis of the YELLOW II trial, comparing patients with and without DM (non-DM) who received rosuvastatin 40\u2009mg for 8-12 weeks and underwent intracoronary multimodality imaging of an obstructive nonculprit lesion, before and after therapy. In addition, blood samples were drawn to assess cholesterol efflux capacity (CEC) and changes in gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). There was a significant reduction in low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), an increase in CEC and beneficial changes in plaque morphology including increase in fibrous cap thickness and decrease in the prevalence of thin cap fibro-atheroma by optical coherence tomography in DM and non-DM patients. While differential gene expression analysis did not demonstrate differences in PBMC transcriptome between the two groups on the single-gene level, weighted gene coexpression network analysis revealed two modules of coexpressed genes associated with DM, Collagen Module and Platelet Module, related to collagen catabolism and platelet function respectively. Bayesian network analysis revealed key driver genes within these modules.

Methods: All enrolled patients were from the Out-Patient Clinic of the Department of TCM at the 3(rd) Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. Using randomised picking method, all patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups, NK and Statin (ST) group. NK Group-patients were given NK at a daily dose of 6 000 FU and ST Group-patients were treated with statin (simvastatin 20 mg) daily. The treatment course was 26 weeks. CCA-IMT, carotid plaque size and blood lipid profile of the patients were measured before and after treatment. Results: A total of 82 patients were enrolled in the study and 76 patients (NK 39, ST 37) completed the study. Following the treatments for 26 weeks, there was a significant reduction in CCA-IMT and carotid plaque size in both groups compared with the baseline before treatment. The carotid plaque size and CCA-IMT reduced from(0.25\u00b10.12)cm(2) to (0.16\u00b10.10)cm(2) and from (1.13\u00b10.12)mm to (1.01\u00b10.11)mm, repectively. The reduction in the NK group was significantly profound (P<0.01, 36.6% reduction in plaque size in NK group versus 11.5% change in ST group). Both treatments reduced total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglyceride (TG). While the reduction in both groups was shown to be statistically significant (P<0.01), the reduction of TC, LDL-C and TG in ST group was significantly greater (P<0.05). In addition, NK significantly increased the level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (P<0.05), in contrast, HDL-C in the ST group did not change. The lipid lowering effect observed in the NK group was not correlated to the reduction of CCA-IMT and carotid artery plaque size (r=0.35, P=0.09). Conclusions: Our findings from this pioneer clinical study suggests that daily NK supplementation is an effective way to manage the progression of atherosclerosis and potentially may be a better alternative to statins which are commonly used to reduce atherosclerosis and further to prevent cardiovascular attack and stroke in patients. The mechanism underlying the reduction of carotid atherosclerosis by NK may be independent from its lipid-lowering effect, which is different from that of statins.",

Many studies using statins have been performed but failed to show remarkable effects. We hypothesized that a long-acting statin would be more effective, due to a longer half-life and stronger pleiotropic effects. Patients with aSAH were randomly assigned to a pitavastatin group (4\u2009mg daily; n\u2009=\u200954) and a placebo group ( n\u2009=\u200954) after repair of a ruptured aneurysm. The primary efficacy end point was vasospasm-related delayed ischemic neurological deficits (DIND), and the secondary end points were cerebral vasospasm evaluated by digital subtraction angiography (DSA), vasospasm-related new cerebral infarctions, and outcome at three months. Severe cerebral vasospasms on DSA were statistically fewer in the pitavastatin group than in the placebo group (14.8% vs. 33.3%; odds ratio, 0.32; 95% confidence interval, 0.11-0.87, p\u2009=\u20090.042); however, the occurrence of DIND and new infarctions and outcome showed no statistically significant differences between the groups.

There is presently no cure for ALS, and only two drugs are available, neither of which provide significant extension of life. The wide variation in onset and progression of the disease, both in sporadic and even in strongly penetrant monogenic familial forms of ALS, indicate that in addition to background genetic variation impacting the disease process, environmental exposures are likely contributors. Epidemiological evidence worldwide implicates exposures to bacterial toxins, heavy metals, pesticides, and trauma as probable environmental factors. Here, we review current advances in gene-environment interactions in ALS animal models. We report our recent discoveries in a zebrafish model of ALS in relation to exposure to the cyanobacterial toxin BMAA, and discuss several results from mouse models that show interactions with exposure to mercury and statin drugs, both leading to acceleration of the disease process. The increasing research into this combinatorial gene-environment process is just starting, but shows early promise to uncover the underlying biochemical pathways that instigate the initial motor neuron defects and lead to their rapidly progressive dysfunction.",

In such conditions, the ability to decrease neuroinflammation by drug therapy may influence disease progression. Statins have been used to treat hyperlipidemia as well as reduce neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in various tissues. In previous studies, treatment of scrapie-infected mice with the type 1 statins, simvastatin or pravastatin, showed a small beneficial effect on survival time. In the current study, to increase the effectiveness of statin therapy, we treated infected mice with atorvastatin, a type 2 statin that has improved pharmacokinetics over many type 1 statins. Treatments with either simvastatin or pravastatin were tested for comparison. We evaluated scrapie-infected mice for protease-resistant PrP (PrPres) accumulation, gliosis, neuroinflammation and time until advanced clinical disease requiring euthanasia. All three statin treatments reduced total serum cholesterol \u226540\u200a% in mice. However, gliosis and PrPres deposition were similar in statin-treated and untreated infected mice. Time to euthanasia due to advanced clinical signs was not changed in statin-treated mice relative to untreated mice, a finding at odds with previous reports. Expression of 84 inflammatory genes involved in neuroinflammation was also quantitated. Seven genes were reduced by pravastatin, and one gene was reduced by atorvastatin. In contrast, simvastatin therapy did not reduce any of the tested genes, but did slightly increase the expression of Ccl2 and Cxcl13. Our studies indicate that none of the three statins tested were effective in reducing scrapie-induced neuroinflammation or neuropathogenesis.", 
    "59": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) accounts for >17 million deaths globally every year, and this figure is predicted to rise to >23 million by 2030. Numerous studies have explored the relationship between cholesterol and CVD and there is now consensus that dyslipidaemia is a causal factor in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Statins have become the cornerstone of the management of dyslipidaemia. Statins have proved to have a very good safety profile. The risk of adverse events is small compared to the benefits. Nevertheless, the potential risk of an adverse event occurring must be considered when prescribing and monitoring statin therapy to individual patients. Statin-associated muscle disease (SAMS) is by far the most studied and the most common reason for discontinuation of therapy. The reported incidence varies greatly, ranging between 5% and 29%. Milder disease is common and the more serious form, rhabdomyolysis is far rarer with an incidence of approximately 1 in 10,000. The pathophysiology of, and mechanisms leading to SAMS, are yet to be fully understood. Literature points towards statin-induced mitochondrial dysfunction as the most likely cause of SAMS. However, the exact processes leading to mitochondrial dysfunction are not yet fully understood. This paper details some of the different aetiological hypotheses put forward, focussing particularly on those related to mitochondrial dysfunction.",

Studies show risk stratification for CAD, based on the GRS, is more discriminatory than conventional risk factors and predicts the response to statin therapy. A prospective trial showed individuals with high GRS had 91% greater risk of cardiac events, and individuals with a healthy lifestyle had 46% fewer cardiac events than an unfavorable lifestyle.

With the focus on 'what regulates cell size', the question 'why cell size needs to be maintained' has been largely overlooked. Recent evidence indicates that animal cells exhibit nonlinear cell size dependent growth rates and mitochondrial metabolism, which are maximal in intermediate sized cells within each cell population. Increases in intracellular distances and changes in the relative cell surface area impose biophysical limitations on cells, which can explain why growth and metabolic rates are maximal in a specific cell size range. Consistently, aberrant increases in cell size, for example through polyploidy, are typically disadvantageous to cellular metabolism, fitness and functionality. Accordingly, cellular hypertrophy can potentially predispose to or worsen metabolic diseases. We propose that cell size control may have emerged as a guardian of cellular fitness and metabolic activity.",

In this work we investigated whether \u03b4(13)C and \u03b4(2)H can distinguish monacolin K from lovastatin and can detect the presence of lovastatin in RYR. 18 samples of red yeast rice powder and 18 samples of lovastatin were collected. Monacolin K was isolated from RYR using preparative HPLC and together with lovastatin, was subjected to analysis of \u03b4(13)C and \u03b4(2)H using Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry. Thanks to the different photosynthetic cycles of the matrices used for their synthesis, monacolin K and lovastatin have different \u03b4(13)C values (-29.6\u2030 \u00b1 0.6 and -16.7\u2030 \u00b1 2.6 respectively). \u03b4(2)H is significantly (p < 0.001) lower in monacolin K but the ranges of values partially overlap with those of lovastatin. By defining a \u03b4(13)C threshold value of -28.3\u2030 for monacolin K, addition of lovastatin from a minimum of 10% can be identified. \u03b4(13)C analysis can be therefore proposed as a suitable tool for detecting the authenticity of RYR on the market.",

Patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia are the most obvious candidates for these drugs, but other patients with elevated cardiovascular risk, statin intolerance or hyperlipoproteinaemia(a) may also benefit. PCSK9 mAbs, administered once or twice monthly, reduce LDL-cholesterol levels by 50 - 70%, and appear to be safe and acceptable to patients over at least two years of treatment.

The GLAGOV study is a multicentric, double-blinded and placebo-controlled study which during a 76-week period followed an impact of the treatment with evolocumab (PCSK9i) together with statin on the status of coronary atherosclerosis in patients with ischemic heart disease, and in comparison with the statin treatment. 968 patients at an average age of 60 have reached a significant decline in the levels of serum LDL-cholesterol (from 2.39 to 0.95 mmol/l) in the branch of the combined therapy, which led to a considerable reduction of percent atheroma volume in the coronary artery by 0.95% (in the branch of the statin-only therapy, the percent atheroma volume increased by 0.05%). The therapy was safe. As shown by the results, evolocumab can through additional reduction of blood levels of LDL-C favorably influence (reduce) coronary atherosclerosis.Key words: evolocumab - regression of coronary atherosclerosis - LDL-C blood levels.",

    "190": "Since the first position statement on diabetes and cardiovascular prevention published in 2014 by the Brazilian Diabetes Society, the current view on primary and secondary prevention in diabetes has evolved as a result of new approaches on cardiovascular risk stratification, new cholesterol lowering drugs, and new anti-hyperglycemic drugs. Importantly, a pattern of risk heterogeneity has emerged, showing that not all diabetic patients are at high or very high risk. In fact, most younger patients who have no overt cardiovascular risk factors may be more adequately classified as being at intermediate or even low cardiovascular risk. Thus, there is a need for cardiovascular risk stratification in patients with diabetes. The present panel reviews the best current evidence and proposes a practical risk-based approach on treatment for patients with diabetes.",

The guideline includes 59 recommendations covering: (1) the impact of new anti-hyperglycemic drugs and new lipid lowering drugs on cardiovascular risk; (2) a guide to statin use, including new definitions of LDL-cholesterol and in non-HDL-cholesterol targets; (3) evaluation of silent myocardial ischemia and subclinical atherosclerosis in patients with diabetes; (4) hypertension treatment; and (5) the use of antiplatelet therapy.", 
    "192": "Diabetes is a heterogeneous disease. Although cardiovascular risk is increased in most patients, those without risk factors or evidence of sub-clinical atherosclerosis are at a lower risk. Optimal management must rely on an approach that will cover both cardiovascular disease prevention in individuals in the highest risk as well as protection from overtreatment in those at lower risk. Thus, cardiovascular prevention strategies should be individualized according to cardiovascular risk while intensification of treatment should focus on those at higher risk.", 
    "193": "Drug discovery and development efforts are largely based around a common expectation, namely, direct or indirect action on a cellular process (e.g. statin-mediated enzyme inhibition or insulin-stimulated receptor activation) will have a beneficial impact on physiological homeostasis. To expand on this, one could argue that virtually all pharmacological interventions attempt to influence the flow of traffic in a biochemical network, irrespective of disease or modality. Since stable isotope tracer kinetic methods provide a measure of traffic flow (i.e. metabolic flux), their inclusion in study designs can yield novel information regarding pathway biology; the application of such methods requires the integration of knowledge in physiology, analytical chemistry and mathematical modeling. Herein, we review the fundamental concepts that surround the use of tracer kinetics, we define basic terms and outline guiding principles via theoretical and experimental problems. Specifically, one needs to (i) recognize the types of biochemical events that change isotopic enrichments, (ii) appreciate the distinction between fractional turnover and flux rate and (iii) be aware of the subtle differences between tracer kinetics and pharmacokinetics. Hopefully investigators can use the framework that is presented here to develop applications which address their specific questions surrounding biochemical flux and therein gain insight into the pathophysiology of disease states and examine pharmacodynamic mechanisms.",

Though anticoagulants are effective in preventing VTE, they are associated with major bleeding risk. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (known as statins), are well established for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease via their lipid-lowering properties. Emerging evidence suggests that statins may play a role in the prevention of VTE, but the evidence has been uncertain. Areas covered: This review summarizes the available epidemiological and interventional evidence on the role of statins in VTE prevention; the postulated biologic mechanisms involved; outlines areas of outstanding uncertainty; and the implications for clinical practice. Expert commentary: The body of evidence indicates statins may also play a potential role in the primary and secondary prevention of VTE. Further evidence is however warranted. There is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of statins to replace anticoagulants in VTE prevention. However, guideline bodies should review the overall evidence and consider including statin therapy as an adjunct to anticoagulant therapy in VTE prevention in specific patient populations. Statin therapy instead of anticoagulants may be considered in patients who are not candidates for anticoagulant therapy and in some low VTE risk patients.",

Despite the established inverse correlation between HDL-C levels and cardiovascular risk, several clinical trials with HDL-C-increasing drugs (such as niacin, CETP inhibitors or fibrate) failed to demonstrate that a significant rise in HDL-C levels translate into a cardiovascular benefit. Statins, that are the most used lipid-lowering drugs, can also increase HDL-C levels, although this effect is highly variable among studies and statins; the most recent developed statin, pitavastatin, beside its role as LDL-C-lowering agent, increases HDL-C levels at a significantly higher extent and progressively upon treatment; such increase was observed also when patients where shifted from another statin to pitavastatin. The stratification by baseline HDL-C levels revealed that only pitavastatin significantly increased HDL-C levels in patients with baseline HDL-C \u226445\u00a0mg/dl, while no changes were observed in patients with higher baseline HDL-C levels. In the last years the hypothesis that functional properties of HDL may be more relevant than HDL-C levels has risen from several observations. The treatment with pitavastatin not only increased HDL-C levels, but also increased the phospholipid content of HDL, increased the HDL efflux capacity and their anti-oxidant properties. These observations suggest that, besides its high LDL-C-lowering effect, pitavastatin also exhibits a significantly higher ability to increase HDL-C levels and may also positively affect the quality and functionality of HDL particles.",

Among 909 patients, 629 (69%) were prescribed statins, and 124 (13.6%) were treated with HI statin therapy. Mean low-density lipoprotein level was similar in patients on LMI versus HI (80\u00b130 versus 87\u00b144\u00a0mg/dL, P=0.14).

Each group generated a list of responses in round-robin fashion. Then, each PCP independently ranked their top three responses to each question. For each PCP, the most important reason was given a weight of 3 votes, and the second and third most important reasons were given weights of 2 and 1, respectively.

    "239": "The anticancer efficacy of anthracyclines is limited by congestive heart failure. Clinically established markers of early onset of cardiotoxicity following anthracycline treatment and preventive measures are missing. Although statins are reported to alleviate anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity in vivo, the molecular mechanisms involved remain elusive. In vitro data point to Rac1 as major target of the cytoprotective statin effects. Here we investigated whether specific inhibition of Rac1 by NSC23766 is as effective as lovastatin in preventing subacute cardiotoxicity following doxorubicin treatment. C57BL/6 mice were treated over 3\u00a0weeks with multiple low doses of doxorubicin (6\u00a0\u00d7\u00a03\u00a0mg/kg\u00a0BW, i.p.) and the level of DNA damage, apoptosis and regenerative proliferation as well as pro-inflammatory, pro-fibrotic and oxidative stress responses were investigated. Moreover, heart function was monitored by echocardiography. Doxorubicin induced subacute cardiotoxicity which was reflected on the level of residual DNA damage, frequency of apoptotic and mitotic cells as well as elevated mRNA expression of markers of heart failure, remodeling and mitochondrial biogenesis. These molecular markers of cardiotoxicity were mitigated to a similar extent by co-treatment with either lovastatin (10\u00a0mg/kg\u00a0BW, p.o.) or NSC23766 (5\u00a0mg/kg\u00a0BW, i.p.) three times a week. Moreover, doxorubicin caused diastolic dysfunction as reflected by increased E-wave acceleration time (EAT), which again was prevented by pharmacological inhibition of Rac1. Inhibition of Rac1 signaling is of major relevance for the cardioprotective effects of lovastatin in the context of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. Moreover, EAT is a useful marker of subacute cardiotoxicity caused by persisting harmful effects of doxorubicin.", 
    "240": "Pre-clinical and retrospective studies of patients using statins to reduce plasma cholesterol have suggested that statins may be useful to treat cancer. However, prospective clinical trials have yet to demonstrate significant efficacy. We have previously shown that this is in part because a hydrophobic statin with a long half-life is necessary. Pitavastatin, the only statin with this profile, has not undergone clinical evaluation in oncology. The target of pitavastatin, hydroxymethylglutarate coenzyme-A reductase (HMGCR), was found to be over-expressed in all ovarian cancer cell lines examined and upregulated by mutated TP53, a gene commonly altered in ovarian cancer. Pitavastatin-induced apoptosis was blocked by geranylgeraniol and mevalonate, products of the HMGCR pathway, confirming that pitavastatin causes cell death through inhibition of HMGCR. Solvent extracts of human and mouse food were also able to block pitavastatin-induced apoptosis, suggesting diet might influence the outcome of clinical trials. When nude mice were maintained on a diet lacking geranylgeraniol, oral pitavastatin caused regression of Ovcar-4 tumour xenografts. However, when the animal diet was supplemented with geranylgeraniol, pitavastatin failed to prevent tumour growth. This suggests that a diet containing geranylgeraniol can limit the anti-tumour activity of pitavastatin and diet should be controlled in clinical trials of statins.",

These plaque features are: Thin-cap fibroatheroma (TCFA), plaque burden PB\u226570%, or minimal luminal area MLA\u22644mm\u00b2. Identification of arterial locations likely to later develop such high-risk plaques may help prevent MACE. We report a machine learning method for prediction of future high-risk coronary plaque locations and types in patients under statin therapy. Sixty-one patients with stable angina on statin therapy underwent baseline and one-year follow-up VH-IVUS non-culprit vessel examinations followed by quantitative image analysis. For each segmented and registered VH-IVUS frame pair (n=6341), location-specific (\u22480.5mm) vascular features and demographic information at baseline were identified. Seven independent support vector machine (SVM) classifiers with seven different feature subsets were trained to predict high-risk plaque types one year later. A leave-one-patient-out cross-validation was used to evaluate the prediction power of different feature subsets. The experimental results showed that our machine learning method predicted future TCFA with correctness of 85.9%, 81.7%, and 77.0% (G-mean) for baseline plaque phenotypes of TCFA, thick-cap fibroatheroma, and non-fibroatheroma, respectively. For predicting PB\u226570%, correctness was 80.8% for baseline PB\u226570% and 85.6% for 50%\u2264PB<70%. Accuracy of predicted MLA\u22644mm\u00b2 was 81.6% for baseline MLA\u22644mm\u00b2 and 80.2% for 4mm\u00b2<MLA\u22646mm\u00b2. Location-specific prediction of future high-risk coronary artery plaques is feasible through machine learning using focal vascular features and demographic variables.

Although medical therapies including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors show inhibitory effects on post-infarct LV remodeling, the prognosis of patients with post-infarct heart failure is still poor. Accumulating evidence suggests that an inflammatory response is implicated in the process of post-infarct LV remodeling. Therefore, we hypothesized that anti-inflammatory therapy by nanoparticle-mediated monocyte/macrophage-targeting delivery of pitavastatin may protect the heart from post-infarct LV remodeling.Male C57BL/6 mice were subjected to permanent coronary ligation and pitavastatin-incorporating nanoparticles (Pitavastatin-NPs) were intravenously injected for 3 to 5 consecutive days. Pitavastatin-NPs were delivered to CD11b(+) monocytes/macrophages, but not to cardiomyocytes. Treatment with Pitavastatin-NPs after establishment of MI attenuated post-infarct LV remodeling accompanied by a reduction of monocytes/macrophages in the heart, whereas pitavastatin solution treatment did not. Pitavastatin-NPs inhibited mobilization of monocytes from the spleen after MI. In mice after splenectomy, Pitavastatin-NPs still decreased the number of monocytes/macrophages in the infarcted heart and inhibited post-infarct LV remodeling.Nanoparticle-mediated delivery of pitavastatin to monocytes/macrophages may be a novel therapeutic strategy to protect the heart from post-infarct LV remodeling. Inhibition of monocyte mobilization from the bone marrow is one of the major mechanisms by which Pitavastatin-NPs attenuated post-infarct LV remodeling.",

We sought to determine the accuracy of the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association statin eligibility criteria to identify individuals at a higher risk of developing cancer or of dying as a result of cancer or other noncardiovascular causes. Methods We included 2,196 participants (50.5 \u00b1 8.1 years of age; 55% female) who were statin na\u00efve and free of cancer at baseline from the offspring and third-generation cohorts of the community-based longitudinal Framingham Heart Study. Statin eligibility was determined per American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, and subclinical coronary atherosclerosis was assessed by computed tomography. The primary outcome was incident cancer at a median of 10.0 years (interquartile range, 9.1-10.6 years) of follow-up, and secondary outcomes were cancer mortality and noncardiovascular mortality. Results The incident cancer rate was 11.2% (247 of 2,196), with 58 noncardiovascular deaths, including 39 cancer deaths (1.8%). Overall, 37% (812 of 2,196) were statin eligible. Incident cancer occurred in 125 (15%) of the 812 statin-eligible participants versus 122 (8.8%) of the 1,384 of noneligible participants (subdistribution hazard ratio [SDHR], 1.8 [1.4 to 2.3]; P < .001). Cancer mortality occurred in 34 (4.2%) of the 812 statin-eligible participants versus five (0.4%) of the 1,384 noneligible participants (SDHR, 12.1 [4.7 to 31]; P < .001). Noncardiovascular mortality occurred in 49 (6.0%) of the 812 statin-eligible participants versus nine (0.7%) of the 1,384 noneligible participants (SDHR, 10.1 [5.0 to 21]; P < .001). In stratified analyses, these findings were independent of any individual causative risk factor such as body mass index, age, or smoking status. Conclusion In this community-based primary prevention cohort, guideline-based statin eligibility accurately identified patients at a higher risk of developing cancer and cancer-related mortality. Shared risk profiles and potential benefits of statins between cancer and cardiovascular outcomes may provide a unique opportunity to improve population health.",
