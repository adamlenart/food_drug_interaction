    "4": "Elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels are associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Statins have been the cornerstone of lipid therapy to lower LDL-C for the past two decades, but despite significant clinical efficacy in a majority of patients, a large residual risk remains for the development of initial or recurrent atherosclerotic CVD. In addition, owing to the side-effects, a significant percentage of patients cannot tolerate any statin dose or a high enough statin dose. Thus, novel therapeutic agents are currently being developed to lower LDL-C levels further. This review will highlight these novel therapeutic agents including antisense oligonucleotides focused on apolipoprotein B, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors, and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein inhibitors. For each therapeutic class, an overview of mechanism of action, pharmacokinetic data, and efficacy/safety evidence will be discussed.",

The results of KAMIR could help clinicians to predict the prognosis of their patients and identify better diagnostic and treatment tools to improve the quality of care. The KAMIR score was proposed to be a predictor of the prognosis of AMI patients. Triple antiplatelet therapy, consisting of aspirin, clopidogrel and cilostazol, was effective at preventing major adverse clinical outcomes. Drug-eluting stents were effective and safe in AMI patients with no increased risk of stent thrombosis.

Many more secondary prevention trials followed to establish unequivocally the benefit of cholesterol reduction. Strategies that aim to improve primary prevention are important for managing the overall burden of disease. Recently therefore, the role of statin in primary prevention is being debated. The JUPITER trial and more recently the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists collaborators, proved that incidences of first major cardiovascular events in apparently healthy individuals were reduced by statins. Statins have also been discussed to be having certain pleiotropic effects on other diseases like diabetes, cancer and osteoporosis. However, issues of cost effectiveness and adverse effects like myositis, and transaminitis still loom large. The medical community needs to debate and evolve a possible consensus on the path breaking subject.", 
    "11": "Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal-dominant disorder mostly caused by mutations in the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene leading to increased risk for premature cardiovascular diseases. According to functional studies, LDLR mutations may be classified into five classes. The main objective of this study was to characterize seven LDLR variants previously detected in FH patients. Analysis by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy of LDLR activity demonstrate that all the studied variants are pathogenic. Among the mutations located in \u03b2-propeller, p.Trp577Gly and p.Ile624del were classified as class 2, whereas p.Arg416Trp and p.Thr454Asn as class 5. p.Phe800Glyfs*129 (located in the cytoplasmic domain), p.Cys155Tyr (located in the binding domain), and p.Asn825Lys (inside FxNPxY motif) were classified as class 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The results also show that LDLR activity of these class 4 and 5 variants is not completely abolished, showing a milder phenotype. We have also determined that statin response is more efficient lowering total cholesterol in heterozygous patients carrying p.Ile624del (class 2) compared with p.Arg416Trp and p.Thr454Asn (class 5) variants. In conclusion, these findings emphasize the importance of characterizing LDLR pathogenic variants to provide an indisputable FH diagnosis and to gain insight into the statin response depending on the LDLR class mutation.", 
    "12": "Statins are the preferred treatment for hypercholesterolemia and several studies have demonstrated their long-term safety and efficacy in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, in some cases of severe hypercholesterolemia such as homozygous and heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia or statin intolerant patients, statins can be less efficient. In recent years, new lipid-lowering agents with novel mechanisms of action have been developed to reduce LDL-cholesterol in patients with severe hypercholesterolemia, associated or not to conventional lipid-lowering therapy. These therapies include microsomal transfer protein inhibitor (Lomitapide), antisense oligonucleotide to Apo B100 (Mipomersen) and monoclonal antibodies against Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). Different studies have shown the great effectiveness of these new therapies. Short-term studies confirmed their adequate security profile, especially in patients with homozygous familiar hypercholesterolemia or severe hypercholesterolemia. Some of these agents have been also tested in statin-intolerant patients. However, long-term studies are needed to evaluate their safety, effectiveness and impact on cardiovascular risk reduction.",

To overcome this problem, various surface coating protocols have been developed. However, a comparative and precise real-time measurement of their impact on cell behavior has not been conducted. The prostate cancer cell line LNCaP, derived from a patient lymph node metastasis, is a commonly used model system in prostate cancer research. However, the cells' characteristically weak attachment to the surface of tissue culture vessels and cover slips has impeded their manipulation and analysis and use in high throughput screening. To improve the adherence of LNCaP cells to the culture surface, we compared different coating reagents (poly-L-lysine, poly-L-ornithine, collagen type IV, fibronectin, and laminin) and culturing conditions and analyzed their impact on cell proliferation, adhesion, morphology, mobility and gene expression using real-time technologies. The results showed that fibronectin, poly-L-lysine and poly-L-ornithine improved LNCaP cells adherence and provoked cell morphology alterations, such as increase of nuclear and cellular area. These coating reagents also induced a higher expression of F-actin and reduced cell mobility. In contrast, laminin and collagen type IV did not improve adherence but promoted cell aggregation and affected cell morphology. Cells cultured in the presence of laminin displayed higher mobility than control cells. All the coating conditions significantly affected cell viability; however, they did not affect the expression of androgen receptor-regulated genes. Our comparative findings provide important insight for the selection of the ideal coating reagent and culture conditions for the cancer cell lines with respect to their effect on proliferation rate, attachment, morphology, migration, transcriptional response and cellular cytoskeleton arrangement.",

Treatment data were obtained from patients who were treated with capecitabine, oxaliplatin bevacizumab \u00b1 cetuximab in the phase III CAIRO2 study. A total of 529 patients were included in this study, of whom 78 patients were on statin therapy.

The hazard ratio (HR) for PFS for statin users was 1.12 (95% confidence interval 0.78-1.61) and was not influenced by treatment arm, KRAS mutation status or the KRAS*statin interaction. Statin use adjusted for covariates was not associated with increased PFS (HR = 1.01, 95% confidence interval 0.71-1.54). In patients with a KRAS wild type tumor the median OS for non-users compared to statin users was 22.4 vs. 19.8 months and in the KRAS mutant tumor group the OS was 18.1 vs. 14.5 months.

In the present study, the effect of simvastatin on inflammation and oxidative stress induced by angiotensin II (Ang II) in human mesangial cells (HMCs) and its corresponding mechanism was examined. In the in vitro experiment, HMCs were pretreated either without additives (control group) or with simvastatin at different concentrations (0, 0.1, 1 or 10 \u00b5M) for 1 h and were then stimulated by Ang II (1 \u00b5M) for 24 h. Following stimulation, the cells were collected for analysis using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and dihydroethidium staining.

Over approximately the same period there has been an increase in the prevalence of obesity. Multiple epidemiological studies and meta-analyses have confirmed that obesity, especially abdominal, visceral obesity, is a risk factor for gastro-oesophageal reflux, Barrett's oesophagus and oesophageal adenocarcinoma. Although visceral obesity enhances gastro-oesophageal reflux, the available data also show that visceral obesity increases the risk of Barrett's oesophagus and adenocarcinoma via reflux-independent mechanisms. Several possible mechanisms could link obesity with the risk of oesophageal adenocarcinoma in addition to mechanical effects increasing reflux. These include reduced gastric Helicobacter pylori infection, altered intestinal microbiome, factors related to lifestyle, the metabolic syndrome and associated low-grade inflammation induced by obesity and the secretion of mediators by adipocytes which may directly influence the oesophageal epithelium. Of these adipocyte-derived mediators, increased leptin levels have been independently associated with progression to oesophageal adenocarcinoma and in laboratory studies leptin enhances malignant behaviours in cell lines. Adiponectin is also secreted by adipocytes and levels decline with obesity: decreased serum adiponectin levels are associated with malignant progression in Barrett's oesophagus and experimentally adiponectin exerts anticancer effects in Barrett's cell lines and inhibits growth factor signalling. At present there are no proven chemopreventative interventions that may reduce the incidence of obesity-associated oesophageal cancer: observational studies suggest that the combined use of a statin and aspirin or another cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor is associated with a significantly reduced cancer incidence in patients with Barrett's oesophagus.",

It has been generally accepted that cerebrovascular remodeling during hypertension is one of the major contributors to the increased risk of stroke. Volume-regulated Cl(-) channel (VRCC) and calcium-activated Cl- channel (CaCC) are the two predominant types of Cl(-) channels in cerebral vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). Recent studies have demonstrated that ClC-3, a member of the voltage-gated ClC Cl(-) channel family, is the molecular candidate for VRCC in VSMC. And TMEM16A, a member of anoctamin family, is responsible for the native CaCC of VSMC in brain vessels. It has been shown that VRCC activity is enhanced but CaCC activity is decreased in cerebral VSMC, paralleling the severity of cerebrovascular remodeling induced by hypertension. In the present review, we will highlight the recent findings regarding the important roles of these two channels in VSMC proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle regulation, vascular inflammation, reactive oxygen species production and cerebrovascular remodeling during the development of hypertension. In addition, the relationship between VRCC and clinical used agents for stroke prevention, such as statins, will be discussed.

Statins are cholesterol-lowering drugs that are vasoprotective in diabetes through unknown mechanisms. We tested the hypothesis that atorvastatin decreases NADPH oxidase (Nox)-derived ROS generation and associated vascular injury in diabetes. Lepr(db)/Lepr(db) (db/db) mice, a model of Type 2 diabetes and control Lepr(db)/Lepr(+) (db/+) mice were administered atorvastatin (10 mg/kg per day, 2 weeks). Atorvastatin improved glucose tolerance in db/db mice. Systemic and vascular oxidative stress in db/db mice, characterized by increased plasma TBARS (thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances) levels and exaggerated vascular Nox-derived ROS generation respectively, were inhibited by atorvastatin. Cytosol-to-membrane translocation of the Nox regulatory subunit p47(phox) and the small GTPase Rac1/2 was increased in vessels from db/db mice compared with db/+ mice, an effect blunted by atorvastatin. The increase in vascular Nox1/2/4 expression and increased phosphorylation of redox-sensitive mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) was abrogated by atorvastatin in db/db mice. Pro-inflammatory signalling (decreased I\u03baB-\u03b1 and increased NF-\u03baB p50 expression, increased NF-\u03baB p65 phosphorylation) and associated vascular inflammation [vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) expression and vascular monocyte adhesion], which were increased in aortas of db/db mice, were blunted by atorvastatin. Impaired acetylcholine (Ach)- and insulin (INS)-induced vasorelaxation in db/db mice was normalized by atorvastatin. Our results demonstrate that, in diabetic mice, atorvastatin decreases vascular oxidative stress and inflammation and ameliorates vascular injury through processes involving decreased activation of Rac1/2 and Nox.

A Quantitative Systems Pharmacology model of the mechanisms of action of statin and anti-PCSK9 therapies was developed to predict low density lipoprotein (LDL) changes in response to anti-PCSK9 mAb for different treatment protocols and patient subpopulations. Mechanistic interactions and cross-regulation of LDL, LDL receptor, and PCSK9 were modeled, and numerous virtual subjects were developed and validated against clinical data. Simulations predict a slightly greater maximum percent reduction in LDL cholesterol (LDLc) when anti-PCSK9 is administered on statin background therapy compared to as a monotherapy. The difference results primarily from higher PCSK9 levels in patients on statin background. However, higher PCSK9 levels are also predicted to increase clearance of anti-PCSK9, resulting in a faster rebound of LDLc.

Ambulatory processes of care of interest were diagnostic testing, medication usage, and access to general/speciality physicians over a 1-year time-horizon. Primary outcome was 1-year mortality. Secondary outcomes included 1-year myocardial infarction, repeat cardiac/all-cause hospitalization, and emergency department visits. The cohort consisted of 38 804 patients, of whom 34 949 (90%) were urban and 3855 (10%) were rural patients. After risk-adjustment, rural patients had lower rates of cholesterol assessment (odds ratios 0.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.38-0.44; P<0.001), hemoglobin A1C assessment (odds ratios 0.41; 95% CI, 0.38-0.44; P<0.001), and statin use (odds ratios 0.67; 95% CI, 0.57-0.79; P<0.001) compared with urban patients. Rural patients had fewer total ambulatory physician visits (rate ratio 0.76; 95% CI, 0.75-0.78; P<0.001)), primary care (0.76; 95% CI, 0.74-0.78; P<0.001), and cardiology visits (0.71; 95% CI, 0.68-0.74; P<0.001) over 1 year. Emergency department utilization was higher among rural patients (odds ratios 1.82; 95% CI, 1.70-1.96; P<0.001), but myocardial infarction, hospitalization, and mortality rates were similar.",

    "118": "There is growing evidence for the importance of cardiovascular risk factors in dementia development, including Alzheimer's disease. As cardiovascular risk profiles vary greatly by gender, with men suffering a greater burden of cardiovascular risk in midlife, this could lead to differences in dementia risk. To explore current evidence on the association between components of the cardiovascular risk profile and dementia risk in women and men, we reviewed all studies reporting the risk of dementia associated with cardiovascular risk factors stratified by gender and found 53 eligible articles out of over 4,000 published since the year 2000. Consistent results were found: 1) for exposures acting specifically in women: Overweight/obesity (harmful) and physical activity (protective), and 2) for exposures acting similarly in women and men: Moderate alcohol (protective) and hypertension, diabetes, and depression (harmful). A modified effect of tobacco or high cholesterol/statin use remained controversial. Available data do not allow us to assess whether selection of men with healthier cardiovascular profile (due to cardiovascular death in midlife) could lead in late life either to a difference in the distribution of risk factors or to a differential effect of these risk factors by gender. We recommend that results on dementia risk factors, especially cardiovascular ones, be reported systematically by gender in all future studies. More generally, as cardiovascular risk profiles evolve over time, more attention needs to be paid to the detection and correction of cardiovascular risk factors, as early as possible in the life course, and as actively in women as in men.",

Here we perform a pharmacogenetic meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in studies addressing the LDL cholesterol response to statins, including up to 18,596 statin-treated subjects. We validate the most promising signals in a further 22,318 statin recipients and identify two loci, SORT1/CELSR2/PSRC1 and SLCO1B1, not previously identified in GWAS. Moreover, we confirm the previously described associations with APOE and LPA. Our findings advance the understanding of the pharmacogenetic architecture of statin response.", 
    "120": "Statins decreased serum androgen levels in hyperandrogenemic women with polycystic ovary syndrome. No previous study has investigated whether this effect is dose-dependent and observed in patients simultaneously treated with other hypolipidemic agents. The study included 23 premenopausal women with elevated total testosterone levels coexisting with hypercholesterolemia, unsuccessfully treated for at least 6 months with atorvastatin (20\u2009mg daily). These patients were then treated with either an increased dose of atorvastatin (40\u2009mg daily, n=11) or atorvastatin (20\u2009mg daily) plus ezetimibe (10\u2009mg daily) (n=12). Plasma lipids, glucose homeostasis markers and serum levels of androgens, sex hormone-binding globulin and gonadotropins were assessed at baseline and after 3 months of treatment. Although both treatments decreased plasma levels of total and LDL-cholesterol levels, only high-dose atorvastatin reduced serum levels of total testosterone, free testosterone and androstendione. The effect of high-dose atorvastatin on serum androgen levels did not differ between insulin-resistant and insulin-sensitive subjects. The obtained results suggest that atorvastatin reduces serum androgen levels in a dose-dependent manner and that its administration in a higher dose is associated with a more pronounced effect on serum androgens than combination therapy with low-dose atorvastatin and ezetimibe.",

During 3\u2005years of follow-up we recorded exacerbations with hospital admissions or oral corticosteroid treatment. In a nested case-control design, matching on age, gender, smoking, COPD severity and comorbidity, we estimated the association between statin use and exacerbations.

However, in the subgroup with the most severe COPD and without cardiovascular comorbidity, we observed a null association between statin use and exacerbations, OR=1.1 (0.5 to 2.1, p=0.83). Furthermore, statin use was associated with reduced odds of a high CRP, OR=0.69 (0.56 to 0.85, p<0.001), and a high CRP was associated with an increased risk of exacerbations, HR=1.62 (1.35 to 1.94, p<0.001).

    "131": "We recently showed that lovastatin attenuates cyclosporin A (CsA)-induced damage of cortical collecting duct (CCD) principal cells by reducing intracellular cholesterol. Previous studies showed that, in cell expression models or artificial membranes, exogenous cholesterol directly inhibits inward rectifier potassium channels, including Kir1.1 (Kcnj1; the gene locus for renal outer medullary K(+) [ROMK1] channels). Therefore, we hypothesized that lovastatin might stimulate ROMK1 by reducing cholesterol in CCD cells. Western blots showed that mpkCCDc14 cells express ROMK1 channels with molecular masses that approximate the molecular masses of ROMK1 in renal tubules detected before and after treatment with DTT. Confocal microscopy showed that ROMK1 channels were not in the microvilli, where cholesterol-rich lipid rafts are located, but rather, the planar regions of the apical membrane of mpkCCDc14 cells. Furthermore, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P2], an activator of ROMK channels, was detected mainly in the microvilli under resting conditions along with the kinase responsible for PI(4,5)P2 synthesis, phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate 5-kinase, type I \u03b3 [PI(4)P5K I \u03b3], which may explain the low basal open probability and increased sensitivity to tetraethylammonium observed here for this channel. Notably, lovastatin induced PI(4)P5K I \u03b3 diffusion into planar regions and elevated PI(4,5)P2 and ROMK1 open probability in these regions through a cholesterol-associated mechanism. However, exogenous cholesterol alone did not induce these effects. These results suggest that lovastatin stimulates ROMK1 channels, at least in part, by inducing PI(4,5)P2 synthesis in planar regions of the renal CCD cell apical membrane, suggesting that lovastatin could reduce cyclosporin-induced nephropathy and associated hyperkalemia.",

Although the effects of FLU treatment on several cancer types through many mechanisms have been identified, its relationship with unfolded protein response and apoptosis has not been clearly understood. In this recent study, we aimed to investigate the cytotoxic effect of Fluvastatin on MCF-7 cells and define the transcriptional regulation of specific genes during the occurrence of this cytotoxic effect. We administered 0.62, 2.5, 5, and 40\u2009\u03bcM FLU on MCF-7 cells singly and in combination with 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG), and we monitored cell viability and proliferation for 48 hours using real-time cell analyzer system (xCELLigence). At the same time, we measured the mRNA expression levels of glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein, homologous protein (CHOP), caveolin-1 (CAV1), NDRG1 Variant 1 and Variant 2, HMOX1, SGK1, and prostate apoptosis response-4 (PAR4) genes using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (LightCycler 480 II). We accepted GAPDH gene and control groups as the reference gene and calibrator, respectively. We performed relative gene expression analyses of the study groups using the QIAGEN 2009 Relative Expression Software Tool (REST). FLU revealed an antiproliferative and cytotoxic effect on MCF-7 cells, while causing the transcriptional regulation of many genes. Of these genes, the mRNA expressions of CHOP, heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1), N-myc downstream-regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) V1, and NDRG1 V2 increased. On the other hand, the mRNA expression levels of SGK1 and CAV1 decreased. The antiproliferative effects of FLU may be related to the decreased expression levels of SGK1 and CAV1.",

In addition, diet and genetics have a profound effect on cellular metabolism with respect to both health and disease. In the present study, we assembled a comprehensive, literature-based drug metabolic reconstruction of the 18 most highly prescribed drug groups, including statins, anti-hypertensives, immunosuppressants and analgesics. This reconstruction captures in detail our current understanding of their absorption, intracellular distribution, metabolism and elimination. We combined this drug module with the most comprehensive reconstruction of human metabolism, Recon 2, yielding Recon2_DM1796, which accounts for 2803 metabolites and 8161 reactions. By defining 50 specific drug objectives that captured the overall drug metabolism of these compounds, we investigated the effects of dietary composition and inherited metabolic disorders on drug metabolism and drug-drug interactions. Our main findings include: (a) a shift in dietary patterns significantly affects statins and acetaminophen metabolism; (b) disturbed statin metabolism contributes to the clinical phenotype of mitochondrial energy disorders; and (c) the interaction between statins and cyclosporine can be explained by several common metabolic and transport pathways other than the previously established CYP3A4 connection. This work holds the potential for studying adverse drug reactions and designing patient-specific therapies.", 
    "139": "Sphingomyelin metabolism has been linked to several diseases and to longevity. However, few epidemiological studies have quantified individual plasma sphingomyelin species (identified by acyl-chain length and saturation) or their relationship between demographic factors and disease processes. In this study, we determined plasma concentrations of distinct sphingomyelin species in 992 individuals, aged 55 and older, enrolled in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Participants were followed, with serial measures, up to 6 visits and 38\u00a0years (3972 total samples). Quantitative analyses were performed on a high-performance liquid chromatography-coupled electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometer. Linear mixed models were used to assess variation in specific sphingomyelin species and associations with demographics, diseases, medications or lifestyle factors, and plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels. We found that most sphingomyelin species increased with age. Women had higher plasma levels of all sphingomyelin species and showed steeper trajectories of age-related increases compared to men. African Americans also showed higher circulating sphingomyelin concentrations compared to Caucasians. Diabetes, smoking, and plasma triglycerides were associated with lower levels of many sphingomyelins and dihydrosphingomyelins. Notably, these associations showed specificity to sphingomyelin acyl-chain length and saturation. These results demonstrate that longitudinal changes in circulating sphingomyelin levels are influenced by age, sex, race, lifestyle factors, and diseases. It will be important to further establish the intra-individual age- and sex-specific changes in each sphingomyelin species in relation to disease onset and progression.", 
    "140": "Growing evidence indicates that overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) plays a prominent role in the development of cardio- and cerebro-vascular diseases. Among the mechanisms identified to produce oxidative stress in the vascular wall, those mediated by membrane-bound NAD(P)H oxidases represent a major one. NAD(P)H oxidases are a family of enzymes that generate ROS both in phagocytic and non-phagocytic cell types. Vascular NAD(P)H oxidase contains the membrane-bound subunits Nox1, Nox2 (gp91phox), Nox4 and p22phox, the catalytic site of the oxidase, and the cytosolic components p47phox and p67phox. Rac1 (Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate1) is a small GTPase essential for the assembly and activation of NADPH oxidase. Several molecular and cellular studies have reported the involvement of Rac1 in different cardiovascular pathologies, such as vascular smooth muscle proliferation, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, endothelial cell shape change, atherosclerosis and endothelial dysfunction in hypertension. In addition, increased activation of NADPH oxidase by Rac1 has been reported in animals and humans after myocardial infarction and heart failure. The Rac1/NADPH pathway has also been found involved in different pathologies of the cerebral district, such as ischemic stroke, cognitive impairment, subaracnoid hemorrhage and neuronal oxidative damage typical of several neurodegenerative disorders. In addition, thrombotic events are an important step in the onset of cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases. Rac1 has been found involved also in platelet activation, inducing actin polymerization and lamellipodia formation, which are necessary steps for platelet aggregation. Taken together, the evidence candidates Rac1 as a new pharmacological target of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Although the involvement of Rac1 in the beneficial pleiotropic effects of drugs such as statins is well known, and the onset of numerous side effects has raised concern for the management of some patient groups. Interestingly, a novel selective Rac1 inhibitor, NSC23766, has recently been introduced; its use has been reported mainly in the oncology field. Future studies are needed to extend its application to cardio- and cerebro-vascular diseases, and translate its use to humans.",

The risk of kidney damage has multiple determinants and is often related to or exacerbated by intravenous or intra-arterial iodinated contrast. Contrast-induced AKI (CI-AKI) has been associated with an increased risk of subsequent myocardial infarction, stroke, the development of heart failure, rehospitalization, progression of chronic kidney disease, end-stage renal disease, and death. Statins have been studied extensively in the setting of chronic kidney disease and they have been shown to reduce albuminuria, but they have had no effect on the progressive reduction of glomerular filtration or the need for renal replacement therapy. Several meta-analyses have shown a protective effect of short-term statin administration on CI-AKI and led to two large randomized controlled trials evaluating the role of rosuvastatin in the prevention of CI-AKI in high-risk patients with acute coronary syndrome and diabetes mellitus. Both trials showed a benefit of rosuvastatin prior to contrast administration in a statin-naive patient population. In aggregate, these studies support the short-term use of statins specifically for the prevention of CI-AKI in patients undergoing coronary angiography with or without percutaneous coronary intervention.",

However, these effects have not been confirmed in vivo. To assess in vivo anti-CSC effects of simvastatin, female Sprague-Dawley rats with 7,12-dimethyl-benz(a)anthracene (DMBA)-induced mammary cancer and control animals were treated for 14 days with either simvastatin (20 or 40 mg/kg/day) or soybean oil (N = 60). Tumors and normal breast tissues were removed for pathologic examination and immunodetection of CSC markers. At 40 mg/kg/day, simvastatin significantly reduced tumor growth and the expression of most CSC markers. The reduction in tumor growth (80%) could not be explained solely by the decrease in CSCs, since the latter accounted for less than 10% of the neoplasia (differentiated cancer cells were also affected). Stem cells in normal, nonneoplastic breast tissues were not affected by simvastatin. Simvastatin was also associated with a significant decrease in proliferative activity but no increase in cell death. In conclusion, this is the first study to confirm simvastatin anti-CSC actions in vivo, further demonstrating that this effect is specific for neoplastic cells, but not restricted to CSCs, and most likely due to inhibition of cell proliferation.",

However, little is know regarding its effect on cholesterol synthesis. The present study therefore aimed to investigate the effect of RBF on cholesterol synthesis. It was determined that RBF decreased serum total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol in rats by 25.9 and 50.8%, respectively (P<0.001). These results strengthen evidence for the hypothesis that RBF exerts anti-atherogenic effects in vivo. Furthermore, RBF decreased cholesterol synthesis by 72%, when measured using a 3 h period of radiolabeled acetate incorporation into cholesterol, but not when using radiolabelled mevalonate, suggesting that RBF-mediated inhibition occurred largely at or above the level of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzymeA (HMG-CoA) reductase. The mechanism by which RBF inactivates HMG-CoA reductase may be attributed to the induction of phosphorylation of adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-kinase, since these results showed that RBF increased phosphorylation of AMP-kinase and HMG-CoA reductase by 2.1- and 3.2-fold, respectively, within 30 min of addition.

Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are at much higher risk of mortality due to CVD. Traditional CVD risk factors viz., hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes do not account for the high cardiovascular risk in CKD patients and also standard clinical interventions for managing CVD that are successful in the general population, are ineffective to lower the death rate in CKD patients. Nontraditional factors, related to disturbed mineral and vitamin D metabolism were able to provide some explanation in terms of vascular calcification, for the increased risk of CVD in CKD. Fibroblast Growth Factor 23, a bone-derived hormone that regulates vitamin D synthesis in renal proximal tubules and renal phosphate reabsorption, has been suggested to be the missing link between CKD and CVD. Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is strongly related to the progress of CVD and its early diagnosis and treatment has significant positive effect on the outcomes of CVD in the affected patients. Besides this, non-dialysable protein-bound uraemic toxins such as indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl sulfate, produced by colonic microbes from dietary amino acids, appear to cause renal dysfunction. Thus, therapeutic approaches targeting colonic microbiota, have led to new prospects in early intervention for CKD patients. Intervention targets for preventing CVD events in CKD patients ideally should include control of blood pressure and dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, lowering proteinuria, correction of anemia, management of mineral metabolism abnormalities and life style changes including smoking cessation, decreased consumption of salt, and achievement of normal body mass index. Use of \u03b2-blockers, renin-angiotensin blockers, diuretics, statins, and aspirin are helpful in the early stages of CKD. In this review, we will address the biological, pathological and clinical relationship between CVD and CKD and their therapeutic management.",

    "170": "The purpose of this study was to characterize the hepatobiliary disposition of timosaponin B2 (TB-2), a natural saponin. Although TB-2 has multiple pharmacologic activities, the mechanism of its hepatobiliary disposition has not been explored. Because the metabolism of TB-2 is limited and the accumulation of TB-2 in primary hepatocytes is highly temperature dependent (93% of its accumulation is due to active uptake), the contribution of hepatic transporters was investigated. Organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1- and OATP1B3-transfected human embryonic kidney 293 cells were employed. TB-2 serves as a substrate for OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, with the former playing a predominant role in the hepatic uptake of TB-2. An inhibition study in sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes suggested that TB-2 is a substrate for both breast cancer resistance protein (Bcrp) and multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (Mrp2), consistent with its high biliary excretion index (43.1-44.9%). This hypothesis was further verified in BCRP and MRP2 membrane vesicles. The cooperation of uptake and efflux transporters in TB-2 hepatic disposition could partially explain the double-peak phenomenon observed in rat plasma and liver and biliary clearance, which accounted for 70% of the total TB-2 clearance. Moreover, TB-2 significantly increased the rosuvastatin concentration in rat plasma in a concentration-dependent manner and decreased its biliary excretion, which corresponded to reductions in rosuvastatin accumulation in hepatocytes and the biliary excretion index in sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes, representing a perfect example of a potential saponin-statin drug-drug interaction. These studies demonstrate that transporters (Oatp, Bcrp/Mrp2), but not metabolism, contribute significantly to rat TB-2 hepatobiliary disposition.", 
    "171": "Individuals age >65 years represent the fastest-growing subpopulation in the United States. Although these individuals with the highest cardiovascular risk profile would be anticipated to be the most aggressively treated, paradoxically, treatment and baseline risk are inversely related. Presumably, the elderly population would benefit from high-intensity statin therapy; however, as per the 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, given the scarcity of evidence in patients age >75, there are only sufficient data from randomized controlled trials to support use of moderate-intensity statin therapy for secondary prevention. Despite evidence demonstrating statins are beneficial in the elderly, the decision to initiate and sustain treatment should be a well-informed and collaborative decision. One must balance the benefits (secondary atherosclerotic cardiovascular prevention, stroke reduction, decreased morbidity and mortality) with the potential risks to the elderly (altered metabolism, comorbidities, polypharmacy and drug-drug interactions, side effects, cognitive limitations, and cost).",

Here, we discuss the clinical relevance of the findings. Given the overwhelming benefit of statins on cardiovascular outcomes in diabetes, current guidelines recommending statins for primary prevention in type 2 diabetes should not change, and any effect on microvascular risk is likely to be minimal. Of course, all patients recommended for statin treatment, whether they have diabetes or not, should now be warned of a slight potential for dysglycaemia on starting statins, but at the same time they should be told that very modest lifestyle improvement will help offset this dysglycaemia risk. Finally, we remind colleagues that nearly all drugs have side effects and we should not be surprised by this statin-dysglycaemia effect, which can be easily managed.",

Recent clinical trial studies have demonstrated conflicting results on anti-arrhythmia between lipophilic and hydrophilic statins. However, the underlying mechanisms responsible for anti-arrhythmogenic effects of statins are largely unexplored. In this study, we evaluated the different roles of lipophilic and hydrophilic statins (simvastatin and pravastatin, respectively) in acetylcholine (100 \u00b5M)-activated K+ current (IKACh, recorded by nystatin-perforated whole cell patch clamp technique) which are important for AF initiation and maintenance in mouse atrial cardiomyocytes. Our results showed that simvastatin (1-10 \u00b5M) inhibited both peak and quasi-steady-state IKACh in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, pravastatin (10 \u00b5M) had no effect on IKACh. Supplementation of substrates for the synthesis of cholesterol (mevalonate, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate or farnesyl pyrophosphate) did not reverse the effect of simvastatin on IKACh, suggesting a cholesterol-independent effect on IKACh. Furthermore, supplementation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, extracellular perfusion of phospholipase C inhibitor or a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor had no effect on the inhibitory activity of simvastatin on IKACh. Simvastatin also inhibits adenosine activated IKACh, however, simvastatin does not inhibit IKACh after activated by intracellular loading of GTP gamma S. Importantly, shortening of the action potential duration by acetylcholine was restored by simvastatin but not by pravastatin. Together, these findings demonstrate that lipophilic statins but not hydrophilic statins attenuate IKACh in atrial cardiomyocytes via a mechanism that is independent of cholesterol synthesis or PKC pathway, but may be via the blockade of acetylcholine binding site. Our results may provide important background information for the use of statins in patients with AF.",

We evaluated risk of breast cancer death among statin users in a population-based cohort of breast cancer patients. The study cohort included all newly diagnosed breast cancer patients in Finland during 1995-2003 (31,236 cases), identified from the Finnish Cancer Registry. Information on statin use before and after the diagnosis was obtained from a national prescription database. We used the Cox proportional hazards regression method to estimate mortality among statin users with statin use as time-dependent variable. A total of 4,151 participants had used statins. During the median follow-up of 3.25 years after the diagnosis (range 0.08-9.0 years) 6,011 participants died, of which 3,619 (60.2%) was due to breast cancer. After adjustment for age, tumor characteristics, and treatment selection, both post-diagnostic and pre-diagnostic statin use were associated with lowered risk of breast cancer death (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.38-0.55 and HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.44-0.67, respectively). The risk decrease by post-diagnostic statin use was likely affected by healthy adherer bias; that is, the greater likelihood of dying cancer patients to discontinue statin use as the association was not clearly dose-dependent and observed already at low-dose/short-term use. The dose- and time-dependence of the survival benefit among pre-diagnostic statin users suggests a possible causal effect that should be evaluated further in a clinical trial testing statins' effect on survival in breast cancer patients.",

The study included available data from electronic medical records for a total of 286,791 patients. After controlling for sex, age, diabetes duration, and treatment received, both men and women with prior CVD had worse cardiometabolic control than patients without previous CVD; women with prior CVD had worse overall control of CVRFs than men except for smoking; and women without prior CVD were only better than men at controlling smoking and BP, with no significant differences in glycemic control. Finally, although the proportion of women treated with lipid-lowering medications was similar to (with prior CVD) or even higher (without CVD) than men, LDL-cholesterol levels were remarkably uncontrolled in both women with and women without CVD. The results stress the need to implement measures to better prevent and treat CVRF in the subgroup of diabetic women, specifically with more intensive statin treatment in those with CVD.",
