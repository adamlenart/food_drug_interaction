    "22": "Whole brain irradiation (WBI) is commonly administered therapeutically and is routinely associated with late delayed radiation injuries, manifesting as severe and irreversible cognitive impairment. Neural progenitors within the subgranular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus are among the most radiosensitive cell types in the adult brain and are known to participate in hippocampal plasticity and normal cognitive function. These progenitors and the specialized SGZ microenvironment required for neuronal differentiation are the source of neurogenic potential in the adult dentate gyrus, and provide a continuous supply of immature neurons which may then migrate into the adjacent granule cell layer to become mature granule cell neurons. The extreme radiosensitivity of these progenitors and the SGZ microenvironment implicate them as potentially significant contributors to radiation-induced cognitive impairment. Previous reports suggest that statin drugs may be neuroprotective and may promote neurogenesis within the SGZ following both traumatic and ischemic brain injury. Here we investigate whether atorvastatin might similarly protect progenitors and/or preserve neurogenic potential within the SGZ when administered following radiation injury. We also investigate whether such mitigating effects might be enhanced by administering atorvastatin in combination with the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, ramipril, which has previously been shown to produce subtle mitigating effects in this context. Atorvastatin was administered to adult male Fisher 344 rats beginning 24 h post-WBI at doses of 10 and 15 Gy, and maintained daily until sacrifice at 12 weeks post-WBI. Combined atorvastatin and ramipril (atorvastatin + ramipril) were administered according to the same protocol following WBI doses of 10 Gy. Progenitor proliferation, neuronal differentiation, and microglial activation were assayed immunohistochemically. Our results indicate that chronic administration of atorvastatin is relatively ineffective as a mitigator of radiation injury in this context, whereas atorvastatin + ramipril appear to interact synergistically to potently and selectively mitigate radiation-induced disruption of neurogenic signaling within SGZ microenvironment.",

In the general population (without CKD), there are strong associations between cholesterol fractions and the risk of coronary disease and weaker associations with stroke. Randomised trials in the general population demonstrate that lowering blood cholesterol (chiefly with a statin) reduces the risk of vascular events. Patients with CKD differ significantly from the general population. They have markedly disturbed lipid metabolism manifesting as elevated triglyceride concentrations, reduced HDL cholesterol concentrations and a preponderance of small, dense LDL particles that are potentially more atherogenic; the observed association between lipids and vascular disease is bizarre, and is confounded by co-morbidity; the nature of the vascular disease appears less strongly associated with classical atherosclerosis. Randomised trials are required to determine the relevance of blood lipids to the development of vascular disease in CKD patients, but the results of such studies have been inconclusive to date. CKD patients are at risk of end-stage renal disease. Lipids may be involved in the progression of renal disease. Modifying them may delay the progression of CKD.

Coronary stenosis has been detected in men with familial hypercholesterolemia as young as 17 years old and in women with familial hypercholesterolemia at 25 years old. Atherosclerosis and its clinical complications occur prematurely, especially in men, thus lifelong hypolipidemic measures, started in childhood, are needed to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases. In children with familial hypercholesterolemia children, so far diet has been the main mode of treatment. Anion exchange resins, such as cholestyramine and colestipol, have also been found to be effective but are generally considered unpalatable and therefore poorly tolerated.

A growing body of evidence indicates that neurodegeneration involves the cell-cycle activation in postmitotic neurons. Failure of cell-cycle control is not restricted to neurons in AD patients, but occurs in peripheral cells as well. For these reasons, we studied the role of simvastatin (SIM) on cell survival/death in lymphoblasts from AD patients. We report here that SIM induces apoptosis in AD lymphoblasts deprived of serum. SIM interacts with PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 signaling pathways thereby decreasing the serum withdrawal-enhanced levels of the CDK inhibitor p21(Cip1) (p21) and restoring the vulnerability of AD cells to trophic factor deprivation.",

Because pravastatin is a water-soluble organic anion, it cannot easily penetrate the lipid bilayer of the cell membrane. As the precise mechanisms of the effect of pravastatin on glucose metabolism and diabetes have not been clarified, we examined the roles of the organic anion transporter family on pravastatin-treated islet and adipocyte functions. Rat oatp1/slco1a1, oatp2/slco1a4 and oatp3/slco1a5 were expressed in the pancreas, and rat oatp3/slco1a5 was also detected in rat insulinoma cell line INS-1e. Pravastatin was transported not only by oatp1/slco1a1 and oatp2/slco1a4, but also by rat oatp3/slco1a5. Pravastatin uptake into INS-1e cells was detected and this transport was inhibited by sulfobromophthalein and rifampicin, both of which are known to inhibit oatp family-mediated uptake. In addition, pravastatin enhanced the glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from INS-1e cells. When fat-loaded db/db mice were treated with pravastatin, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance were prevented. In addition, insulin secretion from isolated islets was enhanced by pravastatin. These data suggest that pravastatin has pleiotropic effects on islets through membrane transport under high fat/glucose conditions.",

Despite adequate erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) supplementation, some ESRD patients still have suboptimal hemoglobin levels, and iron deficiency and inflammation are recognized as the two most common causes. Hepcidin, a newly discovered key regulator of iron homeostasis, is found to be accumulated in ESRD. As it controls iron uptake and release, better reflecting real-time iron demand and availability, hepcidin might become a target in the management of iron deficiency and ESA resistance in dialysis patients. For their pleiotropic functions apart from lipid-modulation, statins are also used as anti-inflammatory or immune-modulating agents. In this study, we applied simvastatin for the purpose of influencing serum prohepcidin level in a group of maintenance hemodialysis patients. Thirty-three ESRD patients undergoing hemodialysis were enrolled and assigned to experimental and hemodialysis control groups according to their lipid profile. Nineteen healthy adults were chosen as a normal control group. The subjects in the experimental group took 20 mg simvastatin orally per night for eight weeks, and those in the hemodialysis control group took no statins or any other lipid-modulating drugs. Before and after the experiment, the serum prohepcidin concentrations, plasma IL-6, and serum C-reactive protein (CRP), ferritin, hemoglobin, albumin, total cholesterol, glycerinate, and LDL and HDL cholesterol levels were determined. Of the 33 hemodialysis patients, the serum prohepcidin concentration was (175.8 +/- 52.9) ng/mL, significantly higher than that in the normal control group (149.5 +/- 24.2) ng/mL (P = 0.048).

This study aimed to investigate the impact of statin use before AIS onset on in-hospital mortality and identify the factors related to in-hospital mortality among patients with and without previous statin use. A retrospective cohort study of all patients with AIS attending hospital from June 1, 2008 to December 31, 2008. Data were collected from medical records including demographic information, diagnostic information, risk factors, previous statin use, and vital discharge status. Chi-square, Fisher's exact tests, student's t-test, and Mann-Whitney U test, whatever appropriate, were used to test the significance between the variables, and multiple logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with in-hospital mortality. Altogether, 386 patients with AIS were studied, of which 113 (29.3%) had a documented previous statin use. A total of 62 (16.1%) patients with AIS died in hospital. In-hospital mortality was significantly lower among previous statin users (P = 0.013). The presence of atrial fibrillation (AF) increased in-hospital mortality among patients with or without previous statin use. The independent predictors for in-hospital mortality among AIS patients without previous statin use were the presence of diabetes mellitus (P = 0.047), AF (P = 0.045), and renal impairment (P < 0.001).

At baseline, the plasma adiponectin level was low in patients with CAD compared with that of patients with VHD. At surgery, adiponectin level in PRAVA was increased to the level in VHD, whereas those in ROSUVA and Non-statin were unchanged. VIS contents and gene expressions of adiponectin in PRAVA and VHD were similar to each other and were both higher than those in Non-statin and ROSUVA. SC content and gene expression of adiponectin were similar among 4 groups. Protein carbonyl (PC) level, an indicator of oxidative stress, in VIS was lower in PRAVA and VHD than in ROSUVA and Non-statin.

These policies differ in the extent to which pharmacists or patients can influence which medications they choose. Using national Medicaid data, we evaluated the relationship between different generic substitution policies and the use of generic simvastatin, a cholesterol-lowering drug, after the patent for the brand-name equivalent, Zocor, expired. States that implemented policies requiring patients' consent prior to generic substitution experienced rates of substitution that were 25 percent lower than those of states that did not require patient consent. By eliminating patient consent requirements, state Medicaid programs could expect to save more than $100 million in coverage for three top-selling medications that are nearing patent expiration. Although these consent requirements are probably intended to increase patient autonomy, policy makers should consider the sizable opportunity costs.", 
    "80": "Akt is an important oncoprotein, and data suggest a critical role for nuclear Akt in cancer development. We have previously described a rapid (3-5 min) and P2X7-dependent depletion of nuclear phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) and effects on downstream targets, and here we studied mechanisms behind the pAkt depletion. We show that cholesterol-lowering drugs, statins, or extracellular ATP, induced a complex and coordinated response in insulin-stimulated A549 cells leading to depletion of nuclear pAkt. It involved protein/lipid phosphatases PTEN, pleckstrin homology domain leucine-rich repeat phosphatase (PHLPP1 and -2), protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), and calcineurin. We employed immunocytology, immunoprecipitation, and proximity ligation assay techniques and show that PHLPP and calcineurin translocated to the nucleus and formed complexes with Akt within 3 min. Also PTEN translocated to the nucleus and then co-localized with pAkt close to the nuclear membrane. An inhibitor of the scaffolding immunophilin FK506-binding protein 51 (FKBP51) and calcineurin, FK506, prevented depletion of nuclear pAkt. Furthermore, okadaic acid, an inhibitor of PP2A, prevented the nuclear pAkt depletion. Chemical inhibition and siRNA indicated that PHLPP, PP2A, and PTEN were required for a robust depletion of nuclear pAkt, and in prostate cancer cells lacking PTEN, transfection of PTEN restored the statin-induced pAkt depletion. The activation of protein and lipid phosphatases was paralleled by a rapid proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) translocation to the nucleus, a PCNA-p21(cip1) complex formation, and cyclin D1 degradation. We conclude that these effects reflect a signaling pathway for rapid depletion of pAkt that may stop the cell cycle.",

Subsequently, the antiangiogenic mechanism of an identified lead compound, rosuvastatin, was studied by conducting endothelial cell function assays and examining antitumor efficacy in a PCa xenograft mouse model. MEASUREMENTS, RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Seven lead compounds, including isorotenone, dihydromunduletone, aristolochic acid, simvastatin, mevastatin, lovastatin, and rosuvastatin, were identified to inhibit the growth of the zebrafish intersegmental vessels. Of these seven leads, rosuvastatin was further evaluated for its antiangiogenic mechanism and anticancer efficacy. Rosuvastatin decreased the viability of the human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs) (one-half inhibitory concentration: 5.87 microM) by inducing G(1) phase arrest and promoting apoptosis. Moreover, rosuvastatin remarkably inhibited the migration of HUVECs and dose-dependently inhibited the HUVEC capillary-like tube formation in vitro.

There were no statistically significant differences (P > 0.05) between patients with or without oral manifestations when age, gender, cardiovascular risk factor, cardiac disease, type of cardiac drug used or the number of medications were assessed. There was a trend for xerostomia to be less frequent in patients receiving therapy with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and a slight trend of xerostomia to be more likely with increased number of non-cardiac and total number of agents per subject. The number of non-cardiac and total medications taken by patients with potential oral manifestations tended to be greater than that of patients without oral manifestations.",

Statin intolerance was defined as not being able to tolerate a registered dose statin due to myalgia-myopathy, myositis, or elevation of serum liver enzyme levels. These statin-intolerant patients were treated with simvastatin with an initial dose of 2.5mg every other day. The dose was titrated upwards if possible.

We discovered significant associations with LDLC levels for the rs34274 SNP (p < 0.0002) and for rs2241220 (p < 0.008) in the acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase beta (ACACB) gene. When corrected for multiple testing, the false-discovery rate associated with rs34274 was 0.076 (significance threshold: 0.10) and for rs2241220 the false-discovery rate was 0.93 (not significant). The acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase beta enzyme synthesizes malonyl coenzyme A, an essential substrate for hepatic fatty acid synthesis and an inhibitor of fatty acid oxidation.", 
    "99": "The SNPs were in weak linkage disequilibrium (D = 0.302). Minor alleles at these sites demonstrate opposing influences on LDLC; the C>T substitution at rs34724 is a risk marker and the C>T substitution at rs2241220 a protective marker for LDLC levels. These SNPs hypothetically influence enzymatic activity through different mechanisms, rs34274 through the PII promoter and rs2241220 via alteration of the protein's responsiveness to allosteric influence.",

The findings complement previously discovered novel SNP relationships to myalgia (pain) and myositis (serum creatine kinase activity). By genotyping for myositis, myalgia and LDLC levels, a physiogenomic model may be developed to help clinicians maximize effectiveness and minimize side effects in prescribing statins.", 
    "101": "Cardiac arrhythmias are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the Western world. Ventricular arrhythmias are reportedly responsible for the majority of sudden cardiac deaths and atrial fibrillation is responsible for 15% of all strokes in the USA. Recent evidence suggests a role for cholesterol in the development of these arrhythmias. In addition to its association with atherosclerotic plaques, high cholesterol has been shown to cause changes in membrane properties, including the function of hormone receptors, ion channels and pumps. These effects are mediated through direct interactions between cholesterol and the membrane proteins, through changes in membrane fluidity and/or an association with lipid rafts. Cholesterol-lowering therapy, therefore, may prove an effective method for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias. Statins, a class of cholesterol-lowering drugs, have been frequently shown to protect against ventricular arrhythmias and atrial fibrillation. Some of this protection may stem from their cholesterol-lowering activities.", 
    "102": "Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] has enhanced atherothrombotic properties. The ability of Lp(a) levels to predict adverse cardiovascular outcomes in patients undergoing coronary angiography has not been examined. The relationship between serum Lp(a) levels and both the extent of angiographic disease and 3-year incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE: death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and coronary revascularization) was investigated in 2,769 patients who underwent coronary angiography [median Lp(a) 16.4 mg/dl, elevated levels (\u226530 mg/dl) in 38%]. An elevated Lp(a) was associated with a 2.3-fold [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.7-3.2, P < 0.001] greater likelihood of having a significant angiographic stenosis and 1.5-fold (95 CI, 1.3-1.7, P < 0.001) greater chance of three-vessel disease. Lp(a)\u226530 mg/dl was associated with a greater rate of MACE (41.8 vs. 35.8%, P = 0.005), primarily due to a greater need for coronary revascularization (30.9 vs. 26.0%, P = 0.02). A relationship between Lp(a) levels and cardiovascular outcome was observed in patients with an LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) \u226570-100 mg/dl (P = 0.049) and >100 mg/dl (P = 0.02), but not <70 mg/dl (P = 0.77). Polymorphisms of Lp(a) were also associated with both plasma Lp(a) levels and coronary stenosis, but not a greater rate of MACE. Lp(a) levels correlate with the extent of obstructive disease and predict the need for coronary revascularization in subjects with suboptimal LDL-C control. This supports the need to intensify lipid management in patients with elevated Lp(a) levels.",

Statins, the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzymeA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, have been shown to inhibit the migration and proliferation of smooth muscle cells (SMCs) leading to an antiproliferative effect. Recent studies have shown that statins can reduce gap junction protein connexin43 (Cx43) expression both in vivo and in vitro. However, little work has been done on the effects of statins on gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC). We hypothesized in this study that lovastatin inhibits vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) migration through the inhibition of the GJIC.", 
    "105": "Rat aortic SMCs (RASMCs) were exposed to lovastatin. Vascular smooth muscle cells migration was then assessed with a Transwell migration assay. Gap junctional intercellular communication was determined by using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) analysis, which was performed with a laser-scanning confocal microscope.", 
    "106": "The migration of the cultured RASMCs were detected by Transwell system. Cell migration was dose-dependently inhibited with lovastatin. Compared with that in the control (110 \u00b1 26), the number of migrated SMCs was significantly reduced to 72 \u00b1 24 (P < .05), 62 \u00b1 18 (P < .01), and 58 \u00b1 19 (P < .01) at the concentration of 0.4, 2, and 10 umol/L, per field. The rate of fluorescence recovery (R) at 5 minutes after photobleaching was adopted as the functional index of GJIC. The R- value of cells exposed to lovastatin 10 umol/L for 48 hours was 24.38% \u00b1 4.84%, whereas the cells in the control group had an R- value of 36.11% \u00b1 10.53%, demonstrating that the GJIC of RASMCs was significantly inhibited by lovastatin (P < .01). Smaller concentrations of lovastatin 0.08 umol/L did not change gap junction coupling (P > .05).",

    "108": "Although statins may provide potential therapeutic pathways for patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), no studies have evaluated statins in combination with standard HF therapy, which would reflect clinical practice more closely. To address this question, we evaluated whether rosuvastatin added to a standard HF therapy provides additional improvement in cardiac structure and function in rats with hypertensive heart failure (SHHF).", 
    "109": "Two-month-old SHHF rats were randomly assigned to four groups: (i) non-treated SHHF rats; (ii) rosuvastatin-treated SHHF rats; (iii) SHHF rats treated with quinapril plus torasemide plus carvedilol (considered as standard HF therapy); and (iv) SHHF rats treated with the combination of standard HF therapy and rosuvastatin. The administration of a standard anti-hypertensive HF therapy to SHHF rats for 17 months attenuated left ventricular (LV) chamber dilatation, cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, and inflammation compared with non-treated SHHF rats. Rosuvastatin alone prevented LV dilatation and cardiac inflammation similar to standard HF therapy-treated SHHF, despite being unable to normalize blood pressure (BP) or influence cardiac hypertrophy. However, and importantly, the addition of rosuvastatin to the standard HF therapy further prevented LV dilatation, preserved cardiac function, and normalized inflammation.", 
    "110": "These data show that the use of rosuvastatin plus a standard HF therapy results in a significant additional improvement in HF and cardiac remodelling in a rat model of HFpEF. These beneficial effects were independent of BP and plasma lipid changes, and seem to be due, at least in part, to decreased myocardial inflammation.", 
    "111": "Statins are cholesterol-lowering pharmaceuticals and commonly prescribed drugs in European countries. Their discharge into the aquatic environment has increased in the last few years and they are present at detectable levels in most sewage effluents. The aim of the present study was to quantify the cytotoxic effects of acid and lactone forms of two statins, atorvastatin and simvastatin, as well as selected metabolites (ortho- and para-hydroxy atorvastatin acid, ortho-hydroxy atorvastatin lactone, simvastatin hydroxyl carboxylic acid, and 3''hydroxy simvastatin lactone) to hepatocytes from rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Hepatocytes were exposed for 24, 48, and 72 h to different concentrations of each test substance (0.4-400 microM). Cytotoxicity was measured as metabolic inhibition and loss of membrane integrity with the fluorescent probes alamar blue (AB) and 5-carboxyfluorescein diacetate, acetoxymethyl ester (CFDA-AM), respectively. Atorvastatin, simvastatin, and ortho-hydroxy atorvastatin lactone had dose-dependent cytotoxic effects on hepatocytes. Simvastatin was more toxic than atorvastatin and the lactone form more toxic than the acid form. Exposure time affected atorvastatin and ortho-hydroxy atorvastatin lactone but not simvastatin toxicity.", 
    "112": "Statins, such as lovastatin, inhibit the cellular cholesterol biosynthesis. Addition of lovastatin to SK cells and subsequent infection with the alphaherpesvirus pseudorabies virus (PRV) did not affect the intracellular production of viral structural proteins but reduced virus titers. Addition of methyl-beta-cyclodextrin to deplete cholesterol from the viral envelope also resulted in reduced virus titers. Addition of exogenous cholesterol restored virus titers in both experimental assays. Further analysis showed that reducing cholesterol levels reduced both the infectivity of newly produced infectious virus and their stability, as assessed by determining virus titers immediately after treatment or upon storage of the virus at room temperature or frozen. This is the first report to demonstrate that cholesterol is involved in the stability of infectious alphaherpesvirus, and that treatment of host cells with statins reduces alphaherpesvirus titers. Hence, cholesterol is important for pseudorabies virus infectivity and stability.", 
    "113": "Minocycline, a commonly prescribed tetracycline antibiotic, has shown promise as a potential therapeutic agent in animal models of numerous neurologic disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, stroke, and spinal cord injury (SCI). Simvastatin is one of many hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme-A reductase inhibitors prescribed to lower cholesterol. These drugs are also known to reduce inflammation and oxidative stress, improve endothelial function, and modulate the immune system in stroke, traumatic brain injury, and SCI. As both drugs have translational potential, we evaluated their neuroprotective properties here in a clinically relevant model of contusive cervical spinal cord injury. Sprague-Dawley rats underwent a unilateral cervical contusion SCI at C5 and were randomized to receive: 1. Minocycline 90 mg/kg x 3 days, 2. Simvastatin 20 mg/kg x 7 days, 3. Simvastatin 20 mg/kg x 7 days then 5mg/kg x 35 days, or 4. Saline (Control). Behavioral recovery was assessed over 6 weeks using the horizontal ladder test, cylinder rearing test, modified Montoya staircase test and grooming test. Forepaw sensitivity was also assessed using the electronic von Frey Aesthesiometer. The corticospinal and rubrospinal tracts were traced and the spinal cords were harvested 7 weeks after injury. The extent of gray matter and white matter sparing and corticospinal and rubrospinal tract sprouting were evaluated in cross sections of the spinal cord. In the end, neither minocycline nor simvastatin treatment was associated with improved performance on the behavioral tests, as compared to saline controls. Performance on the horizontal ladder test, cylinder rearing test, and von Frey sensory test were similar among all groups. Animals treated for 42 days with simvastatin scored significantly higher in the grooming score compared to other groups, but retrieved significantly fewer pellets on the modified Montoya staircase test than control and minocycline treated animals. Histologically, there were no significant differences in white and gray matter sparing and in the extent of corticospinal and rubrospinal sprouting between the four groups. In conclusion, both minocycline and simvastatin failed to improve functional and histological recovery in our model of contusive cervical spinal cord injury.", 
    "114": "Extensive studies over the years have shown that the AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) exhibits negative regulatory effects on the activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling cascade. We examined the potential involvement of AMPK in the regulation of growth and survival of malignant melanoma cells. In studies using the AMPK activators AICAR or metformin, we found potent inhibitory effects of AMPK activity on the growth of SK-MEL-2 and SK-MEL-28 malignant melanoma cells. Induction of AMPK activity was also associated with inhibition of the ability of melanoma cells to form colonies in an anchorage-independent manner in soft agar, suggesting an important role of the pathway in the control of malignant melanoma tumorigenesis. Furthermore, AICAR-treatment resulted in malignant melanoma cell death and such induction of apoptosis was further enhanced by concomitant statin-treatment. Taken together, our results provide evidence for potent inhibitory effects of AMPK on malignant melanoma cell growth and survival and raise the potential of AMPK manipulation as a novel future approach for the treatment of malignant melanoma.",

Logistic regression and propensity score modeling were used to control for AKI risk factors. Sixty-eight of 324 patients (21.0%) developed AKI. AKI patients stayed in the hospital longer (p = 0.03) and were more likely to develop pneumonia (p = 0.002) or die (p = 0.001). A higher body mass index (p = 0.003), higher central venous pressure (p = 0.03), and statin withdrawal (27.4 v 14.7%, p = 0.046) were associated with a higher incidence of AKI, whereas early postoperative statin use was protective (12.5% v 23.8%, p = 0.03). Preoperative statin use did not affect the risk of AKI. In multivariate logistic regression, age (p = 0.03), male sex (p = 0.02), body mass index (p < 0.001), and early postoperative statin use (odds ratio = 0.32; 95% confidence interval, 0.14-0.72; p = 0.006) independently predicted AKI. Propensity score-adjusted risk assessment confirmed the association between early postoperative statin use and reduced AKI (odds ratio = 0.30; 95% confidence interval, 0.13-0.70; p = 0.005).",

    "122": "In the Justification for Use of statins in Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER), random allocation of rosuvastatin compared to placebo among primary prevention patients with a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of <130 mg/dl and a high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) level of > or =2 mg/L resulted in a highly significant 44% reduction in major vascular events. However, the relation of baseline hs-CRP levels to risk within JUPITER has not previously been described and has been an area of controversy for study interpretation. As reported in the present study for the first time, despite enrolling patients with a constrained range of values, increasing baseline hs-CRP levels within JUPITER were nonetheless associated with increasing vascular risk in analyses treating hs-CRP as a continuous variable, as an ordinal variable, and as a threshold variable. As anticipated, the relative risk reduction associated with rosuvastatin was similar in magnitude across the tertile and threshold levels of entry hs-CRP. In conclusion, as the absolute risk increased with increasing hs-CRP, the absolute risk reduction associated with rosuvastatin within JUPITER was also greatest among those with the greatest entry hs-CRP levels.", 
    "123": "Ezetimibe is effective in providing additional low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol lowering when coadministered with statins, but its effect beyond LDL cholesterol lowering is unknown. Oxidized LDL (ox-LDL) is a better predictor of adverse cardiovascular events than standard lipid parameters. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of ezetimibe on ox-LDL. A total of 100 patients with coronary artery disease or coronary artery disease equivalent were randomized to atorvastatin 40 mg/day and ezetimibe 10 mg/day or to atorvastatin 40 mg/day and placebo. LDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol subfractions, and ox-LDL were measured at baseline and after 8 weeks of therapy. The ezetimibe group had a larger reduction in total LDL cholesterol compared to placebo. This was due mainly to a larger reduction in large buoyant LDL (24% vs 10%, p = 0.008). Ox-LDL level did not change in the placebo group (50 +/- 13 vs 51 +/- 13 U/L), while it decreased in the ezetimibe group, from 51 +/- 13 to 46 +/- 10 U/L (p = 0.01 vs baseline and p = 0.02 vs final level in placebo). The change in ox-LDL correlated significantly with those in total LDL and in large buoyant LDL (r = 0.6 and r = 0.5, respectively, p <0.01 for both), but not with that of small dense LDL, high-density lipoprotein, or very low density lipoprotein. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that ezetimibe decreases ox-LDL cholesterol through reductions in total LDL cholesterol and in large buoyant LDL cholesterol.",

There were no differences with respect to other comorbidities including smoking status, presence of diabetes, renal insufficiency, anatomic factors or treatment modality (open vs endovascular). Ninety-seven patients underwent endovascular revascularization.

It is not known if these lipoproteins come from the circulation or local ocular tissue. Emerging, but incomplete evidence suggests that the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) can secrete lipoproteins. The purpose of this investigation was to determine (i) whether human RPE cells synthesize and secrete apoB100, and (ii) whether this secretion is driven by cellular cholesterol, and if so, (iii) whether statins inhibit this response. The established, human derived ARPE-19 cells challenged with 0-0.8 mM oleic acid accumulated cellular cholesterol, but not triglycerides. Oleic acid increased the amount of apoB100 protein recovered from the medium by both western blot analysis and (35) S-radiolabeled immunoprecipitation while negative stain electron microscopy showed lipoprotein-like particles. Of nine statins evaluated, lipophilic statins induced HMG-CoA reductase mRNA expression the most. The lipophilic Cerivastatin (5 \u03bcM) reduced cellular cholesterol by 39% and abrogated apoB100 secretion by 3-fold. In contrast, the hydrophilic statin Pravastatin had minimal effect on apoB100 secretion. These data suggest that ARPE-19 cells synthesize and secrete apoB100 lipoproteins, that this secretion is driven by cellular cholesterol, and that statins can inhibit apoB100 secretion by reducing cellular cholesterol.",

In analyses restricted to untreated patients, the TT genotype was associated with 1.7 times higher CHD risk than the CC genotype (hazard ratio (HR) =1.65, 95% confidence interval (95% CI): 1.08-2.53; P = 0.02). Conversely, in statin-treated FH patients, CHD risk in TT individuals was not increased (HR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.35-1.24; P = 0.2). Formal testing confirmed this interaction (P = 0.03).

To further investigate the statin-specific HO-1 regulation, we examined HO-1 gene expression by simvastatin in cell cultures of human endothelial cells. Simvastatin-dependent HO-1 gene activation was significantly reduced by pharmacological inhibition of the p38 MAPK and phosphotidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathways. Although HO-1 is considered to be primarily regulated at the transcriptional level, simvastatin induced activity of a human HO-1 promoter gene construct only to a minor extent. By contrast, studies with actinomycin D indicated that the half-life of HO-1 mRNA was significantly prolonged in the presence of simvastatin suggesting a post-transcriptional mode of HO-1 regulation. The increased HO-1 mRNA stability by this compound was blocked by inhibition of PI3K/Akt, but not by that of p38 MAPK. In conclusion, statin-dependent up-regulation of endothelial HO-1 is mainly regulated by stabilization of HO-1 mRNA via a PI3K/Akt-dependent signaling pathway.",

The incorporation of 2 g of phytosterols daily into margarine, mayonnaise, orange juice, olive oil, low-fat milk, yogurt, and tablets is associated with significant reductions in low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol from baseline over 1-12 months in adults with normal or high cholesterol, in children, and in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Phytosterol dosages of 1.6-3 g daily have been shown to reduce LDL cholesterol by 4.1-15% versus placebo within the first month of therapy. One meta-analysis found mean reductions of 10-11%, but results vary. Several placebo-controlled trials found that the addition of phytosterols to statin therapy was associated with reductions of 7-20% in LDL cholesterol for up to 1.5 years. Overall, phytosterols are useful for reducing LDL cholesterol in patients who cannot reach their treatment goal by diet alone or who are taking maximum tolerated doses of statins. These products offer an alternative to statins in patients who cannot take statins or whose statin dosage is restricted because of potential drug interactions or concomitant diseases. Commonly reported adverse effects are primarily gastrointestinal in nature.",

Plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were also increased and total antioxidant reactivity (TAR) and paraoxonase activity (PON1) decreased in non-dyslipidemic T2D patients and dyslipidemic T2D non-treated with simvastatin. We also found that DI was inversely correlated with TAR (r = -0.61, p < 0.05) and PON1 (r = -0.67, p < 0.01). In addition, there was a significant positive correlation between DI and CRP (r = 0.80, p < 0.01).

Four weeks later, echocardiography, hemodynamics and Van Gieson staining were applied to evaluate left ventricular remodeling and cardiac function. Myocardial gene expression of TNF-alpha and activity of p38 MAP kinase were analyzed by real time-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot, respectively. The results demonstrated that increased TNF-alpha gene expression in noninfarcted areas was accompanied by activation of p38 MAP kinase pathway.

Treatment of HF diet-fed rats with fluvastatin (8 mg/kg) was lethal, followed by an elevation in levels of plasma aspartate aminotransferase and creatine kinase activities and skeletal muscle toxicity. This study was conducted to determine whether nutritional status affects statin-induced adverse effects in rats. Fluvastatin treatment of rats fed the HF diet led to an increase in systemic exposure, suggesting altered metabolism and elimination. In fact, although hepatic multidrug resistance-associated protein (Mrp) 2 and multidrug resistance (Mdr) 1b protein levels were not significantly changed by fluvastatin treatment for 8 days of rats fed a HF diet, the organic anion-transporting protein (Oatp) 1, Mrp3, CYP1A, CYP2C, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1, and UGT1A5 protein levels were moderately decreased and the Oatp2, CYP3A, and UGT2B1 protein levels were markedly suppressed. No significant difference in the baseline level of Oatp1, Oatp2, Mrp2, Mrp3, Mdr1b, CYP1A, CYP2C, CYP3A, UGT1A1, UGT1A5, or UGT2B1 protein was found between the standard diet- and HF diet-fed groups. In addition, the mRNA levels of Oatp2, CYP2C11, and CYP3A1/2 were markedly decreased in HF diet-fed and fluvastatin-treated rats. There was no significant difference in the glucuronidation activities against fluvastatin among the four groups. In liver cell nuclei, levels of constitutive androstane receptor, pregnane X receptor, and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4\u03b1 proteins were decreased in fluvastatin-treated HF diet-fed rats, which correlated with the decrease in Oatp2, CYP2C, and CYP3A. Taken together, these results indicate that nutritional status may influence adverse effects of fluvastatin by increasing systemic exposure through modulation of hepatic uptake and elimination.",

A dose and time dependent expression of LOX-1mRNA and protein was found in C. pneumoniae infected SMC. After heat and UV light treatment of the chlamydial inoculum the level of LOX-1 was reduced to that of mock-infected cultures. Furthermore, treatment of infected cells with fluvastatin decreased LOX-1 expression to baseline levels. The up-regulation of LOX-1 induced by C. pneumoniae could lead to continued lipid accumulation in atherosclerotic lesions. Together with the widespread expression of LOX-1, this might contribute to the epidemiologic link between C. pneumoniae infection and atherosclerosis. The effect of lowering the LOX-1 expression by fluvastatin may provide a pharmacological option of limiting oxLDL uptake via its scavenger receptor.", 
    "166": "Statins are a class of cholesterol lowering drugs that inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), the enzyme which catalyzes the rate limiting step of cholesterol biosynthesis. Although numerous trials have demonstrated statin efficacy in the reduction of cardiovascular disease risk, there is substantial variation between individuals in the magnitude of plasma LDL-cholesterol reduction. Pharmacogenetic studies have identified HMGCR genetic variation associated with this inter-individual variation. Here we describe how these studies lead to the discovery that HMGCR alternative splicing of exon 13 is not only a marker, but also a determinant of statin efficacy; not only for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, but also as a chemopreventive agent for colorectal cancer.", 
    "167": "Childhood dyslipidemia is on the rise and increasingly being recognized as an important risk factor for adult cardiovascular disease. Due to a heightened awareness surrounding this problem, the American Academy of Pediatrics published a clinical report concerning prevention, screening, diagnosis, and treatment of dyslipidemia in children. Of concern among practitioners is when to initiate pharmacologic therapy and which medications are safe and appropriate in children. The report addresses this concern by suggesting that pharmacologic management begin only in pediatric patients with substantially elevated LDL levels. Since statins are the drugs of choice among adult patients with elevated LDL levels, it would be appropriate to evaluate their outcome in pediatric patients. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of statins for the treatment of pediatric dyslipidemia, a comprehensive search was performed of the MEDLINE database and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts as well as references from additional review articles. The manufacturer was contacted for data regarding a newly approved statin. Fourteen trials were identified, eight of which were randomized, controlled trials involving greater than 50 patients with primary or familial hypercholesterolemia. Overall, the studies showed that statins are effective at lowering LDL levels (reduction from baseline: 17% to 50%) and are fairly well tolerated, with headache, gastrointestinal distress, and myalgia being the most common adverse effects. Statins were found to be an efficacious option for the management of familial hypercholesterolemia of childhood. However, concerns regarding long term safety and efficacy have not been established, and data in patients with secondary lipid disorders is lacking.", 
    "168": "After the advent of Statins in 1960's, they are being extensively used as Antiathrogenic drug for Primary Hyperlipidemia, Angina, Ischemic Heart Disease (Medical or Post Surgical), Atherosclerosis, Diabetes mellitus and Hypertension. Rarely, these drugs have been observed to cause hypocholesterolemia. We present a case of forty years old male who was started on Atorvastatin after his angioplasty following anterior myocardial infarction. Six weeks after the start of antilipid drug patient developed symptoms of phobias, nightmares, insomnia, forgetfulness, body aches, muscle cramps, cognitive, sexual and psychomotor disturbances. On investigation he was found to have hypocholesterolemia. Atorvastatin was stopped and dietary restrictrictions were lifted. Over five month patients symptoms resolved as the serum cholesterol levels became normal. Because of similarities of symptoms of hypocholesterolemia secondary to antilipid therapy and the disease itself, hypocholesterolemia was overlooked initially by physicians. Patients on antilipids must be evaluated for any fall in serum cholerterol if they develop unusual symptoms and patients on long-term antilipids must have regularly lipid profile checked.", 
    "169": "Although controversial, evidence suggests statins may reduce the risk of advanced prostate cancer (PC), and recently statin use was associated with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) reductions among men without PC. The authors sought to examine the association between statin use and PSA recurrence after radical prostatectomy (RP).", 
    "170": "The authors examined 1319 men treated with RP from the Shared Equal Access Regional Cancer Hospital (SEARCH) Database. Time to PSA recurrence was compared between users and nonusers of statin at surgery using Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for multiple clinical and pathological features.", 
    "171": "In total, 236 (18%) men were taking statins at RP. Median follow-up was 24 months for statin users and 38 for nonusers. Statin users were older (P<.001) and underwent RP more recently (P<.001). Statin users were diagnosed at lower clinical stages (P=.009) and with lower PSA levels (P=.04). However, statin users tended to have higher biopsy Gleason scores (P=.002). After adjusting for multiple clinical and pathological factors, statin use was associated with a 30% lower risk of PSA recurrence (hazard ratio \"HR\", 0.70; 95% confidence interval \"CI\", 0.50-0.97; P=.03), which was dose dependent (relative to no statin use; dose equivalent<simvastatin 20 mg: HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.66-1.73; P=.78; dose equivalent=simvastatin 20 mg: HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.32-1.00; P=.05; dose equivalent>simvastatin 20 mg: HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.27-0.93; P=.03).", 
    "172": "In this cohort of men undergoing RP, statin use was associated with a dose-dependent reduction in the risk of biochemical recurrence. If confirmed in other studies, these findings suggest statins may slow PC progression after RP.", 
    "173": "Lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and blood pressure (BP) in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) can significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, to our knowledge, previous studies have not assessed variability in both the benefit and harm from pursuing LDL-C and BP target levels.", 
    "174": "Our sample comprised individuals 30 to 75 years old with DM participating in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III. We used Monte Carlo methods to simulate a treat-to-target strategy, in which patients underwent treatment intensification with the goal of achieving LDL-C and BP target levels of 100 mg/dL and 130/80 mm Hg, respectively. Patients received up to 5 titrations of statin therapy and 8 titrations of antihypertensive therapy. Treatment adverse effects and polypharmacy risks and burdens were incorporated using disutilities. Health outcomes were simulated using a Markov model.", 
    "175": "Treating to targets resulted in gains of 1.50 (for LDL-C) and 1.35 (for BP) quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) of lifetime treatment-related benefit, which declined to 1.42 and 1.16 QALYs after accounting for treatment-related harms. Most of the total benefit was limited to the first few steps of medication intensification or to tight control for a limited group of very high-risk patients. However, because of treatment-related disutility, intensifying beyond the first step (LDL-C) or third step (BP) resulted in either limited benefit or net harm for patients with below-average risk.",

    "177": "Among the recently reported cholesterol-lowering drug trials, the JUPITER (Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention) trial is unique: it reports a substantial decrease in the risk of cardiovascular diseases among patients without coronary heart disease and with normal or low cholesterol levels.", 
    "178": "Careful review of both results and methods used in the trial and comparison with expected data.", 
    "179": "The trial was flawed. It was discontinued (according to prespecified rules) after fewer than 2 years of follow-up, with no differences between the 2 groups on the most objective criteria. Clinical data showed a major discrepancy between significant reduction of nonfatal stroke and myocardial infarction but no effect on mortality from stroke and myocardial infarction. Cardiovascular mortality was surprisingly low compared with total mortality-between 5% and 18%-whereas the expected rate would have been close to 40%. Finally, there was a very low case-fatality rate of myocardial infarction, far from the expected number of close to 50%. The possibility that bias entered the trial is particularly concerning because of the strong commercial interest in the study.", 
    "180": "The results of the trial do not support the use of statin treatment for primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases and raise troubling questions concerning the role of commercial sponsors.", 
    "181": "Statins have been shown to reduce the risk of all-cause mortality among individuals with clinical history of coronary heart disease. However, it remains uncertain whether statins have similar mortality benefit in a high-risk primary prevention setting. Notably, all systematic reviews to date included trials that in part incorporated participants with prior cardiovascular disease (CVD) at baseline. Our objective was to reliably determine if statin therapy reduces all-cause mortality among intermediate to high-risk individuals without a history of CVD.",

Data were available on 65,229 participants followed for approximately 244,000 person-years, during which 2793 deaths occurred. The use of statins in this high-risk primary prevention setting was not associated with a statistically significant reduction (risk ratio, 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.83-1.01) in the risk of all-cause mortality. There was no statistical evidence of heterogeneity among studies (I(2) = 23%; 95% confidence interval, 0%-61% [P = .23]).",

    "187": "The medical options available to prevent or treat radiation-induced injury are scarce and developing effective countermeasures is still an open research field. In addition, more than half of cancer patients are treated with radiation therapy, which displays a high antitumor efficacy but can cause, albeit rarely, disabling long-term toxicities including radiation fibrosis. Progress has been made in the definition of molecular pathways associated with normal tissue toxicity that suggest potentially effective therapeutic targets. Targeting the Rho/ROCK pathway seems a promising anti-fibrotic approach, at least in the gut; the current study was performed to assess whether this target was relevant to the prevention and/or treatment of injury to the main thoracic organs, namely heart and lungs. First, we showed activation of two important fibrogenic pathways (Smad and Rho/ROCK) in response to radiation-exposure to adult cardiomyocytes; we extended these observations in vivo to the heart and lungs of mice, 15 and 30 weeks post-irradiation. We correlated this fibrogenic molecular imprint with alteration of heart physiology and long-term remodelling of pulmonary and cardiac histological structures. Lastly, cardiac and pulmonary radiation injury and bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis were successfully modulated using Rho/ROCK inhibitors (statins and Y-27632) and this was associated with a normalization of fibrogenic markers. In conclusion, the present paper shows for the first time, activation of Rho/ROCK and Smad pathways in pulmonary and cardiac radiation-induced delayed injury. Our findings thereby reveal a safe and efficient therapeutic opportunity for the abrogation of late thoracic radiation injury, potentially usable either before or after radiation exposure; this approach is especially attractive in (1) the radiation oncology setting, as it does not interfere with prior anti-cancer treatment and in (2) radioprotection, as applicable to the treatment of established radiation injury, for example in the case of radiation accidents or acts of terrorism.", 
    "188": "Hepatobiliary transporters efficiently shunt rosuvastatin from the blood stream, into the hepatocyte, followed by transporter-mediated excretion into the bile ducts. This study aimed at investigating the contribution of sinusoidal versus canalicular transport on the pharmacokinetics of an intrajejunal dose of 80 mg rosuvastatin in pigs (control group, n = 2 + 6). The transport inhibitors, rifampicin (20 mg/kg, n = 6) and imatinib (14 mg/kg, n = 6), were administered as 2-h long intravenous infusions. Plasma samples were withdrawn from the portal and hepatic vein simultaneously during 5 h along with bile sample collection. Rifampicin reduced the hepatic extraction of rosuvastatin by 35% and the area under the curve in the hepatic vein compartment increased by a factor of 6.3 (95% confidence intervals (CI): 3.1-32, P value <0.01). The increase in the portal vein compartment was less pronounced than in the hepatic vein, 2.0-fold (95% CI: 1.1-3.8, P value <0.05), suggesting that the inhibition was predominantly located in the liver rather than in the intestine and suggesting inhibition if sinusoidal transport. In contrast, no effect on the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin was observed following concomitant administration with imatinib possibly due to insufficient concentration of the inhibitor inside the hepatocyte. Rifampicin significantly affected the hepatobiliary transport of rosuvastatin, however imatinib did not alter the plasma exposure of rosuvastatin.", 
    "189": "There is some evidence that the beneficial effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) in the elderly are at least comparable to the effects in middle-aged people. However, several studies have shown prescription rates of statins to be significantly lower in the elderly than in younger populations.", 
    "190": "The aim of the present study was to monitor statin prescribing trends in the elderly in the Netherlands over time in terms of prevalence, incidence, type of statin, dose prescribed and adherence to clinical guidelines.", 
    "191": "The database of a community pharmacy in Utrecht, which includes prescription data for approximately 11,000 people, was analysed to investigate trends in statin prescriptions from January 1999 to December 2008. The 1-year prevalence and incidence of statin use stratified by age were determined for each calendar year. Rate ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated with 1999 as the reference year. Furthermore, the following trends of interest were calculated for each calendar year: the percentage of statin users prescribed simvastatin or atorvastatin, the median dose of simvastatin and atorvastatin prescribed, and the percentage of simvastatin users prescribed a dosage of 40 mg/day (which is recommended by the Dutch multidisciplinary guideline).", 
    "192": "The 1-year prevalence of statin use in medication users aged >or=50 years increased from 13.9% in 1999 to 22.8% in 2008 (RR 1.6; 95% CI 1.4, 1.9; p < 0.001). Overall, the lowest prevalence (5.1% in 1999 and 15.2% in 2008) and incidence rates (3.2% in 2000 and 4.2% in 2008) were found in patients aged >or=80 years. Before 2006, simvastatin was the most commonly prescribed statin, but the number of users declined as the percentage of patients with new simvastatin prescriptions decreased (from 43.4% in 2000 to 36.5% in 2005) and the percentage of patients treated with new atorvastatin prescriptions increased (from 37.7% in 2000 to 47.3% in 2005). As from 2006, when the Dutch multidisciplinary guideline for Cardiovascular Risk Management was introduced, recommending treatment with a daily simvastatin dose of 40 mg, the number of simvastatin users increased again and most treatment-naive patients were started on simvastatin (62.3% in 2006, increasing to 66.7% in 2008). The median simvastatin dose increased from 10 mg in 1999 to 20 mg in 2001, remaining at the same dose until 2008, and appeared to be related to the patient's age. From 2006, patients aged >or=80 years were the least likely group to receive the recommended dose of 40 mg simvastatin daily (10.0-20.0% of simvastatin users aged >or=80 years compared with 32.5-36.9% of simvastatin users aged 60-69 years).", 
    "193": "Despite the benefits of statin treatment previously reported in older patients, the prevalence and incidence of statin use were lower in elderly patients compared with younger patients. In addition, lower dosages of statins were prescribed. These findings suggest the beneficial effects of statins in the elderly observed in clinical trials may not be achieved in everyday practice.",

However, there is still a need for further prospective studies with more clearly defined diagnostic criteria for statin myopathy and comparative studies of patient cohorts treated with different statins to determine the true incidence of myopathy as an adverse effect. Other important advances include recognition that genetic variants and mutations in the SLCO1B1, CYP and COQ2 genes may determine individual susceptibility to statin myopathy, and that statins may also initiate immune-mediated forms of necrotizing and inflammatory myopathy and unmask or aggravate various metabolic myopathies and other neuromuscular disorders.",
