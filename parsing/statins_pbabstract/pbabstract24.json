The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of statins on clinical periodontal parameters and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-10, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) in inflammatory periodontal diseases. Seventy-nine subjects with hyperlipidemia and 48 systemically healthy controls (C) were included. Hyperlipidemic patients were either given a diet (HD) or prescribed statin (HS). Patients were classified into three subgroups as those who were periodontally healthy (h), who had gingivitis (g), or who had chronic periodontitis (p). Blood samples were collected for the measurement of lipid profiles. Plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), probing pocket depth (PD), clinical attachment level (CAL), and percentage of bleeding on probing (BOP) were recorded. Gingival crevicular fluid levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-10, and MPO were measured in order to determine the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of statins. Probing depth values of the HSp group were significantly lower than those of the Cp group. Percentage of BOP of the HSg group was significantly lower than those of the HDg and Cg groups. While the IL-1\u03b2 level of the HSp group was significantly lower than that of the HDp group, IL-10 levels of the HSg group were significantly higher than those of the HDg group. MPO levels were significantly lower in the HSg group when compared to those in the HDg and Cg groups. Statin use decreased the IL-1\u03b2 and MPO levels and enhanced IL-10 in GCF. It can be suggested that statins may attenuate periodontal inflammation and progression of periodontal inflammation.", 
    "30": "Laboratory testing is important for the safety of older adults initiating statins, but there has been little examination of laboratory testing disparities by race/ethnicity, age, gender, Medicaid eligibility, and multimorbidity. The study's purpose was to examine disparities in guideline-concordant baseline laboratory testing and abnormal laboratory values among a retrospective cohort of 76,868 Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries from 10 states in the eastern United States who had dyslipidemia and initiated a statin from July 1 to November 30, 2011. Guideline-concordant assessment of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was defined as evidence of an outpatient claim for either test within 180\u00a0days before or 14\u00a0days after the date of the index statin fill. In 2011, baseline laboratory testing rates were 89.3% for ALT and 88.8% for AST. Older adults were somewhat more likely to have ALT and AST testing if they were dually enrolled in Medicaid (relative risk 1.01, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.00 to 1.02) or had multiple chronic conditions (relative risk 1.03, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.06 for 2 to 3 conditions; odds ratio [OR] 1.08, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.11 for 4 to 5 conditions; OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.17 for 6+ conditions), compared with 0 to 1 conditions. Non-Hispanic blacks were less likely to receive baseline testing (OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.96 to 0.98) than non-Hispanic Whites, and male beneficiaries were somewhat less likely to receive testing than female beneficiaries (OR 0.99, 95% CI 0.98 to 0.99). Abnormal values were rare. In conclusion, ALT and AST assessment after statin initiation was commonly done as recommended, and there were negligible disparities in testing rates for beneficiaries.", 
    "31": "Cation trapping in acidic cell compartments determines an antiproliferative effect that has a potential interest in oncology, as shown by clinical data and trials involving chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine. To further characterize the mechanism of this effect, we studied a series of 6 substituted triethylamine (s-Et3N) drugs that encompasses a wide range of liposolubility (amiodarone, quinacrine, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, lidocaine, and procainamide). Three tumor cell lines and primary human endothelial cells were exploited in proliferation assays (48h, cell counts). Accumulation of the autophagic effector LC3 II and the apoptotic marker cleaved PARP1 (immunoblots), cytotoxicity, cell cycle analysis and endocytic function were further tested in the p53-null histiocytic lymphoma U937 line. A profound and desynchronized antiproliferative effect was observed in response to all s-Et3Ns with essentially no cell type specificity. Predictors of s-Et3N potency were liposolubility and the acute accumulation of the autophagic effector LC3 II (6h-treatments). For each s-Et3N, there was an antiproliferative concentration range where cytotoxicity and apoptosis were not triggered in U937 cells (24-48h-treatments). Quinacrine was the most potent cytostatic drug (1-5\u03bcM). Co-treatment of cells with inhibitors of cholesterol, \u03b2-cyclodextrin or lovastatin, partially reversed the antiproliferative effect of each s-Et3N. The cytopathology induced by cationic drug accumulation includes a cytostatic effect. Its intensity is cell type- and p53-independent, but predicted by the inhibition of autophagic flux and by the liposolubility of individual drugs and alleviated by cholesterol ablation. The superiority of quinacrine, biomarker value of LC3 II and antagonism by a statin may be clinically relevant.", 
    "32": "Rett syndrome (RTT; OMIM 312750), a progressive neurological disorder, is caused by mutations in methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2; OMIM 300005), a ubiquitously expressed factor. A genetic suppressor screen designed to identify therapeutic targets surprisingly revealed that downregulation of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway improves neurological phenotypes in Mecp2 mutant mice. Here, we show that MeCP2 plays a direct role in regulating lipid metabolism. Mecp2 deletion in mice results in a host of severe metabolic defects caused by lipid accumulation, including insulin resistance, fatty liver, perturbed energy utilization, and adipose inflammation by macrophage infiltration. We show that MeCP2 regulates lipid homeostasis by anchoring the repressor complex containing NCoR1 and HDAC3 to its lipogenesis targets in hepatocytes. Consistently, we find that liver targeted deletion of Mecp2 causes fatty liver disease and dyslipidemia similar to HDAC3 liver-specific deletion. These findings position MeCP2 as a novel component in metabolic homeostasis. Rett syndrome patients also show signs of peripheral dyslipidemia; thus, together these data suggest that RTT should be classified as a neurological disorder with systemic metabolic components. We previously showed that treatment of Mecp2 mice with statin drugs alleviated motor symptoms and improved health and longevity. Lipid metabolism is a highly treatable target; therefore, our results shed light on new metabolic pathways for treatment of Rett syndrome.", 
    "33": "Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), tamoxifen, and raloxifene that reduce the risk of breast cancer are limited to only estrogen receptor-positive (ER(+)) breast cancer. In addition, patient acceptance of SERMs is low due to toxicity and intolerability. New agents with improved toxicity profile that reduce risk of ER-negative breast cancer are urgently needed. Observational studies show that statins can reduce breast cancer incidence and recurrence. The objective of this prospective short-term prevention study was to evaluate the effect of a lipophilic statin, atorvastatin, on biomarkers in breast tissue and serum of women at increased risk. Eligible participants included women with previous history of carcinoma in situ, or atypical hyperplasia, or 5\u00a0year breast cancer projected Gail risk >1.67\u00a0%, or lifetime breast cancer risk >20\u00a0% calculated by models including Claus, Tyrer-Cuzick, Boadicea, or BRCAPRO. Patients underwent baseline fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the breast, blood collection for biomarker analysis, and were randomized to either no treatment or atorvastatin at 10, 20, or 40\u00a0mg/day dose for 3\u00a0months. At 3\u00a0months, blood collection and breast FNA were repeated. Biomarkers included C-reactive protein (CRP), lipid profile, atorvastatin, and its metabolites, Ki-67, bcl-2, EGFR, and pEGFR. Baseline genotype for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoAR) was also measured. Among 60 patients evaluated, a significant reduction in serum CRP, cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and increase in atorvastatin metabolites in serum and breast FNAs was demonstrated. No changes were observed in other tissue biomarkers. This study shows that atorvastatin and its metabolites are detectable in breast samples and may lower serum CRP among women without hyperlipidemia.",

Maximal mean LDL-C reductions from day -1 baseline (prealirocumab) occurred on day 71 in all groups: alirocumab plus placebo, 47.4%; alirocumab plus ezetimibe, 56.6%; and alirocumab plus fenofibrate, 54.3%. LDL-C reductions were sustained through day 85 with alirocumab plus placebo (47.0%); the duration of effect was slightly diminished at day 85 versus day 71 with ezetimibe (49.6%) or fenofibrate combinations (43.2%). Free PCSK9 concentrations were lowest at day 71 in all groups, then increased over time; by day 85, free PCSK9 concentrations were higher, and alirocumab levels lower, with alirocumab plus fenofibrate, and to a lesser extent alirocumab plus ezetimibe, versus alirocumab plus placebo.",

The oral lipid-lowering therapies appear to increase PCSK9 levels, leading to increased alirocumab clearance. Although the duration of effect was modestly diminished with alirocumab plus ezetimibe/fenofibrate versus placebo, the effect was less than observed in trials with background statins, and it would not preclude the use of alirocumab every 4 weeks in patients taking these nonstatin lipid-lowering therapies concomitantly.",

Annexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis assay and Caspase 3 assay were performed to determine the protective role of HCE on simvastatin-induced cell death, and to evaluate if HCE exerted its protective effect through the caspase pathway. ATP production was measured to investigate if HCE could prevent simvastatin-induced reduction in ATP production in vitro.",

Of the clinicopathological characteristics investigated, statin use and lymphovascular invasion (LVI) status were associated with lower TC level (P=0.003 and P=0.014, respectively). In the univariate analysis, a higher serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level at diagnosis, extracapsular extension, positive surgical margin, seminal vesicle invasion, LVI, perineural invasion, higher Gleason score (GS \u22658) based on the RP specimen, increased body mass index, and low preoperative TC level, were significantly associated with BCR. In the multivariate analysis, the TC level was an independent predictor of BCR (hazard ratio = 0.925 per 10 mg/dl; 95% confidence interval: 0.879-0.973; P=0.003), as was the serum PSA level, extracapsular extension, positive surgical margin and the GS.

Statin use was assessed from an interviewer, engagement in MSA (e.g. resistance training) was assessed via survey and lower extremity isokinetic knee extension strength (IKES) was assessed objectively using the Kin Com MP dynamometer. Weighted multivariable linear regression analysis showed no direct association between statin use and IKES (\u03b2adjusted \u00a0=\u00a07\u00b70 newton \u2206, P\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b723). Statin use, however, was associated with a 35% reduced odds of engaging in MSA (ORadjusted \u00a0=\u00a00\u00b765, P\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b704), and engaging in MSA was positively associated with IKES (\u03b2adjusted \u00a0=\u00a019\u00b79 newton \u2206, P\u00a0=\u00a00\u00b7001). The bootstrap Barron and Kenny mediational analysis indeed demonstrated that statin use was indirectly associated with IKES via MSA (indirect effect coefficient: -0\u00b7005; 95% CI: -0\u00b701 to -0\u00b7001; P<0\u00b705). Statin use was not directly associated with IKES, but was indirectly associated with IKES via MSA. In conclusion, statin use may decrease muscle force by influencing engagement in MSA. We wish to suggest that a decrease in MSA may be related to an increase in muscle pain associated with statin therapy.",

CAC progression has been associated with a higher rate of events. In parallel, several randomized studies and meta-analysis have shown the effectiveness of statins to slow progression and even promote plaque regression. However, evidence regarding the effect of routine medical therapy on CAC has yielded conflicting results, with initial studies showing significant CAC regression, and contemporaneous data showing rather the opposite. Accordingly, there is currently a great controversy on whether progression of CAC is a sign of progression or stabilization of coronary artery disease (CAD). The finding of inexorable CAC progression despite the implementation of intensive contemporaneous medical therapy suggests that further understanding of this phenomenon should be undertaken before the implementation of CAC as a surrogate endpoint for longitudinal studies, or for prospective follow-up of patients under routine medical treatment.",

Despite their efficacy, many persons are unable to tolerate statins due to adverse events such as hepatotoxicity and myalgia/myopathy. In the case of most patients, it seems that mild-to-moderate abnormalities in liver and muscle enzymes are not serious adverse effects and do not outweigh the benefits of coronary heart disease risk reduction. The risk for mortality or permanent organ damage ascribed to statin use is very small and limited to cases of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis. Statin-induced muscle-related adverse events comprise a highly heterogeneous clinical disorder with numerous, complex etiologies and a variety of genetic backgrounds. Every patient who presents with statin-related side effects cannot undergo the type of exhaustive molecular characterization that would include all of these mechanisms. Frequently the only solution is to either discontinue statin therapy/reduce the dose or attempt intermittent dosing strategies at a low dose.",

Limited evidence describes the toxic mechanisms elicited by 3MGA in the brain. Herein, we explored the effects of 3MGA on different toxic endpoints in synaptosomal and mitochondrial-enriched fractions of adult rat brains to provide novel information on early mechanisms evoked by this metabolite. At 1 and 5\u00a0mM concentration, 3MGA increased lipid peroxidation, but decreased mitochondrial function only at 5\u00a0mM concentration. Despite less intense effects were obtained at 1\u00a0mM concentration, its co-administration with the kynurenine pathway (KP) metabolite and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAr) agonist, quinolinic acid (QUIN, 50 and 100\u00a0\u00b5M), produced toxic synergism on markers of oxidative stress and mitochondrial function. The toxicity of 3MGA per se (5\u00a0mM) was prevented by the cannabinoid receptor agonist WIN55,212-2 and the NMDAr antagonist kynurenic acid (KYNA), suggesting cannabinoid and glutamatergic components in the 3MGA pattern of toxicity. The synergic model (3MGA\u2009+\u2009QUIN) was also sensitive to KYNA and the antioxidant S-allylcysteine, but not to the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor L-nitroarginine methyl ester. These findings suggest various underlying mechanisms involved in the neurotoxicity of 3MGA that may possibly contribute to the neurodegeneration observed in acidemias.",

As expected, the use of lovastatin and orlistat significantly reduced HMGCoAR and FAS enzymatic activities and gene expression in colonic tissues, but did not affect the number of intestinal polyps, while there was a statistically significant reduction in polyp volume only in the mouse group treated with lovastatin. In the mice receiving orlistat, we observed a significant increase in cell proliferation in the polyp tissue, as well as enhanced expression of ER\u03b1.

Eosinophils were derived by treating HL-60 clone 15 (HC15) cells with butyric acid (BA) in an alkaline condition or through direct isolation from human peripheral blood. The expressions of CC chemokine receptor 3 (CCR3) and interleukin (IL)-5 receptors (IL5R\u03b1 and \u03b2) were analyzed using RT/real-time PCR. The granular proteins were stained using fast green. Eotaxin-induced chemotaxis was measured using a transwell migration assay. CCR3 protein expression was revealed by immunocytochemistry. An animal model of allergic rhinitis was established by challenging Sprague-Dawley\u00ae rats repeatedly with ovalbumin. Butyric acid significantly increased the expression of IL5R\u03b1 and IL5R\u03b2, CCR3 and granular proteins in HC15 cells, indicating the maturation of eosinophils (BA-E cells). IL-5 further enhanced the CCR3 expression at both the mRNA and protein levels and the eotaxin-induced chemotaxis of BA-E cells. Simvastatin inhibited the effects of IL-5 on BA-E cells, but not in the presence of mevalonate. Similar results were also exhibited in human primary eosinophils. In vivo animal studies further confirmed that oral simvastatin could significantly suppress the infiltration of eosinophils into turbinate tissues of allergic rats. Therefore, simvastatin was demonstrated to inhibit IL-5-induced CCR3 expression and chemotaxis of eosinophils mediated via the mevalonate pathway.

Early identification of patients with FH is of great public health importance because preventive strategies can lower the absolute lifetime cardiovascular risk and screening can detect affected relatives.

As a cocktail, relative bioavailabilities of digoxin and metformin and furosemide AUC0-tz were similar to separate dosing. However, when administered as a cocktail the Cmax of furosemide was 19.1% lower and the Cmax and AUC0-tz of rosuvastatin were 38.6% and 43.4% higher, respectively.

The goal of this paper is to review the rationale and evidence for combining these three drug classes in hypertensive patients with hypercholesterolemia or CAD. Data sources include a literature search for publications on the use of a statin combined with various antihypertensive drugs in patients with hypertension and hypercholesterolemia or stable CAD. Hypercholesterolemia and hypertension constitute major physiological risk factors of ischemic heart disease. Current guidelines recommend a global approach to risk management, using agents that address as many risk factors as possible. Dual combination therapies are an important component of guideline-recommended therapy in hypertension. Our review of the literature indicates that triple therapy with a statin, ACE inhibitor, and CCB is associated with a significant reduction in major cardiovascular events. For example, a post hoc analysis in 1056 patients with stable CAD participating in the EUROPA trial indicated that the addition of perindopril to a CCB and a lipid-lowering agent was associated with a 46\u00a0% reduction in the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and resuscitated cardiac arrest (p\u00a0=\u00a00.023). In addition, single pill formulations are known to result in better adherence to the treatment. Single-pill formulations that combine a statin, an ACE inhibitor, and a CCB appear to offer an effective approach to the management of global cardiovascular risk.",

The dysfunction is located at the level of the coronary microcirculation with vessel diameters <\u2009500\u00a0\u00b5m and structural as well as functional alterations have been described. The underlying mechanisms are diverse, frequently overlap and are still incompletely understood. Among others, conditions such as chronic inflammation, estrogen deficiency and a genetic familial predisposition have been reported. A common and often underdiagnosed clinical manifestation of CMD is found in patients who have symptoms of angina pectoris but no obstructive epicardial coronary artery disease or myocardial disease. The CMD can be diagnosed using non-invasive procedures, such as the combination of coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography and cardiac stress magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or coronary CT and positron emission tomography (PET). In addition, invasive coronary vasomotor assessment is also suitable. Very little evidence is available regarding the effectiveness of pharmacological treatment of CMD. The current European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines on the management of stable coronary artery disease from 2013 recommend using acetylsalicylic acid (ASS) and a statin as well as beta blockers and/or calcium channel blockers. Patients with CMD have an elevated risk for coronary events and death of approximately 1.7\u2009% per year. Moreover, there is an increased morbidity with frequent presentations in practices and emergency admissions. Clinical research efforts should aim at a better characterization of the underlying mechanisms of CMD in order to develop targeted treatment approaches.",

The nocebo effect coupled with the challenges of diagnosing statin myopathy undermines drug adherence that is critical for achieving the benefits of lipid-lowering and cardiovascular risk reduction. A temporal relationship should be made between the initiation of therapy and development of symptoms to aid in diagnosis. The mainstay of treatment is statin cessation or statin dose reduction and evaluation of alternative causes for muscle related symptoms. Most symptoms usually resolve within 2 weeks of discontinuing therapy. The patient can be re-challenged with the same statin at a lower dose or an alternative statin. Non-statin lipid lowering therapies offer an alternative to patients who cannot tolerate statins.",

Most patients will tolerate some degree of statin therapy; thus statin re-challenge is advisable. If alternative dosing regimens are not tolerated, non-statin medications are acceptable alternatives.

    "166": "Many reports suggested that some statins are almost ineffective in reducing triglycerides or enhancing HDL-C plasma levels, although statin treatment was still efficacious in reducing LDL-C. In diabetic dyslipidemic patients, it may therefore be necessary to use a combination therapy with other drugs to achieve either LDL-C- and triglyceride-lowering or HDL-C-enhancing goals. Such ineffectiveness of statins can be attributed to their effect on the liver X receptor (LXR) which regulates the expression of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters ABCA1 and ABCG1. A decrease in the expression of these transporters eventually leads to decreased cholesterol efflux from peripheral tissues leading to low levels of HDL-C. Although manipulating the LXR pathway may complement the effects of statins, LXR synthetic ligands as T091317 have shown significant hypertriglyceridemic action which limits their use. We recently found that the antidiabetic drug vildagliptin stimulates LXR expression leading to increased ABCB1/ABCG1 expression which improves cholesterol efflux from adipocytes. Therefore, a combination of vildagliptin and statin may provide a solution without the hypertriglyceridemic action observed with LXR agonist. We hypothesize that a combination of vildagliptin and pravastatin will improve cholesterol efflux in adipocytes. Statin-treated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with vildagliptin, and the expression of LXR-ABCA1/ABCG1 cascade and the cholesterol efflux were then determined. Our data indicate that a combination of vildagliptin and pravastatin significantly induces the expression of LXR-ABCA1/ABCG1 cascade and improves cholesterol efflux (P > 0.05) in adipocytes. Our data may explain, at least in part, the improvement in HDL-C levels observed in patients receiving both medications. \u00a9 2016 IUBMB Life, 68(7):535-543, 2016.",

These vegetable oils and medicines such as statin and warfarin share, in part, a common mechanism to inhibit vitamin K2-dependent processes, which was interpreted to lead to increased onset of CVD, DM, chronic kidney disease, bone fracture and even mental disorder. Impaired vitamin K2-dependent processes by some types of vegetable oils and medicines, but not plasma high low density lipoprotein cholesterol, were proposed as the cause of CVD, DM and other lifestyle-related diseases.

To achieve target LDL-cholesterol in these two groups of patients will be possible with new drugs - PCSK9 inhibitors, which decrease LDL-cholesterol by an additional 50-60 %. The first two PCSK9 inhibitors (alirocumab and evolocumab) already had been approved for clinical use by European regulatory authorities. The primary indication for combination statin with PCSK9 inhibitor should be undoubtedly patients with a confirmed diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia, who are treated in the Czech Republic primarily in specialized centers of MedPed project.

Multiparameter flow cytometric assay was used to detect changes in the expression of transcription factors characteristic of hES cells. We found that lovastatin treatment delayed NANOG downregulation during ectodermal and endodermal differentiation. Likewise, expression of ectodermal (SOX1 and OTX2) and endodermal (GATA4 and FOXA2) markers was higher in treated cells. Exposure of hES cells to lovastatin led to a minor decrease in the expression of SSEA-3 and a significant reduction in CD133 expression. Treated cells also formed fewer embryoid bodies than control cells. By analyzing hES with and without CD133, we discovered that CD133 expression is required for proper formation of embryoid bodies.

In many cases, observational data can be used to test such hypotheses.This article illustrates how epidemiology can contribute and shows the different ways of using observational data through three approaches: 1) prospective cohort study design; 2) time series analysis; and 3) a nested case-control design in pharmacoepidemiology.In a prospective cohort study design, three cohorts were merged to study lung function decline, testing the importance of different trajectories of lung function decline for developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Using these three well-described cohorts it was documented that maximally attained lung function in early adulthood is as important as excess decline in forced expiratory volume in 1\u2005s for the development of COPD. Time series analysis is used to examine exposures and disease over time. In a recent review of cardiovascular disease some interesting associations, and not least lack of associations, were presented. Assessing effects of drugs in database studies is challenging. In a nested case-control design in a large cohort study, statins were found to reduce the risk of COPD exacerbations. These findings will be discussed.Observational data from large databases, as well as carefully collected data in cohort studies, can be used to test hypotheses that may not be addressed in a traditional experimental setting.",

    "191": "Dietary supplementation of BCAAem was able to prevent the structural and functional alterations of muscle induced by Rvs in young mice. Rvs-increased plasma 3-methylhistidine (a marker of muscular protein degradation) was prevented by BCAAem. This was obtained without changes of Rvs ability to reduce cholesterol and triglyceride levels in blood. Rather, BCAAem promotes de novo protein synthesis and reduces proteolysis in cultured myotubes. Morphological alterations of C2C12 cells induced by statin were counteracted by amino acids, as were the Rvs-increased atrogin-1 mRNA and protein levels. Moreover, BCAAem maintained mitochondrial mass and density and citrate synthase activity in skeletal muscle of Rvs-treated mice beside oxygen consumption and ATP levels in C2C12 cells exposed to statin. Notably, BCAAem assisted Rvs to reduce oxidative stress and to increase the anti-reactive oxygen species (ROS) defense system in skeletal muscle. Innovation and Conclusions: The complex interplay between proteostasis and antioxidant properties may underlie the mechanism by which a specific amino acid formula preserves mitochondrial efficiency and muscle health in Rvs-treated mice. Strategies aimed at promoting protein balance and controlling mitochondrial ROS level may be used as therapeutics for the treatment of muscular diseases involving mitochondrial dysfunction, such as statin myopathy.

Myalgia was determined at 2 and 24 hr after surgery. There were no significant differences in the basic clinical characteristics between the two groups. The onset time of the statin group was significantly shorter than that of the non-statin group (p = 0.02), while the duration 10% T1 and duration 25% T1 of the statin group were significantly longer than those of the non-statin group (p = 0.006; p = 0.045). The myoglobin and CK concentrations increased after rocuronium administration as compared to baseline in both groups. CK concentration in the statin group was significantly higher than in the non-statin group just at 24 hr (p = 0.000003). However, myoglobin showed no significant difference between the two groups.

For this purpose, mice were gavaged with either simvastatin or artesunate at nine weeks post-infection and were euthanized by cervical dislocation at two weeks post-treatment. Adult worms were then collected and examined by conventional light microscopy, morphometry and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Plasma total cholesterol and worm reduction rates were significantly increased in mice fed high-fat chow compared with their respective control groups. Simvastatin and artesunate caused changes in the tegument, tubercles, and reproductive system (testicular lobes, vitelline glands and ovarian cells), particularly when administered to mice fed high-fat chow. In particular, the tegument and tubercles were significantly thinner in artesunate-treated worms in mice fed high-fat chow compared with mice fed standard chow.

Predictors of eGFR and CKD outcomes (\u226530% eGFR loss, ESRD, and death) and cardiovascular disease outcomes (stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and death) controlling for eGFR and albuminuria were also determined.", 
    "264": "eGFR was 59\u00b124 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) (mean\u00b1SD) at baseline. Over 3 years, eGFR change, assessed by generalized estimating equations, was -1.5\u00b17.0 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) per year in the stent group versus -2.3\u00b16.3 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) per year in the medical therapy only group (P=0.18). eGFR predictors (multiple variable generalized estimating equations) were age, albuminuria, systolic BP, and diabetes (inverse associations) as well as men, total cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol (positive associations). CKD outcomes events occurred in 19% (175 of 931), and predictors (Cox proportional hazards models) included albuminuria (positive association), systolic BP (positive association), and HDL cholesterol (inverse association). Cardiovascular disease outcomes events occurred in 22% (207 of 931), and predictors included age, albuminuria, total cholesterol, prior cardiovascular disease, and bilateral atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis (positive associations).", 
    "265": "Stenting did not influence eGFR in participants with atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis receiving renin-angiotensin system inhibition-based therapy. Predictors of clinical events were traditional risk factors for CKD and cardiovascular disease.", 
    "266": "Squalene synthase inhibitors (SSIs), such as squalestatin 1 (SQ1), reduce cholesterol biosynthesis but cause the accumulation of isoprenoids derived from farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), which can modulate the activity of nuclear receptors, including the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), farnesoid X receptor, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). In comparison, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (e.g., pravastatin) inhibit production of both cholesterol and nonsterol isoprenoids. To characterize the effects of isoprenoids on hepatocellular physiology, microarrays were used to compare orthologous gene expression from primary cultured mouse and rat hepatocytes that were treated with either SQ1 or pravastatin. Compared with controls, 47 orthologs were affected by both inhibitors, 90 were affected only by SQ1, and 51 were unique to pravastatin treatment (P < 0.05, \u22651.5-fold change). When the effects of SQ1 and pravastatin were compared directly, 162 orthologs were found to be differentially coregulated between the two treatments. Genes involved in cholesterol and unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis were up-regulated by both inhibitors, consistent with cholesterol depletion; however, the extent of induction was greater in rat than in mouse hepatocytes. SQ1 induced several orthologs associated with microsomal, peroxisomal, and mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and repressed orthologs involved in cell cycle regulation. By comparison, pravastatin repressed the expression of orthologs involved in retinol and xenobiotic metabolism. Several of the metabolic genes altered by isoprenoids were inducible by a PPAR\u03b1 agonist, whereas cytochrome P450 isoform 2B was inducible by activators of CAR. Our findings indicate that SSIs uniquely influence cellular lipid metabolism and cell cycle regulation, probably due to FPP catabolism through the farnesol pathway.", 
    "267": "We investigated the possibility that coadministration of rosuvastatin and compound 21 (C21), a selective angiotensin II type 2 (AT2) receptor agonist, could exert synergistic preventive effects on vascular injury. Vascular injury was induced by polyethylene cuff placement on the femoral artery in 9-week-old male C57BL/6J mice. Mice were treated with rosuvastatin and/or with C21 after cuff placement. Neointima formation was determined 14 days after the operation and cell proliferation, and superoxide anion production and expression of inflammatory cytokines were examined 7 days after cuff placement. Neointima formation was significantly attenuated by the treatment of rosuvastatin (5 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) or C21 (10 \u03bcg kg(-1) day(-1)), associated with the decreases in proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) labeling index, oxidative stress, and the expression of inflammatory markers. Treatment with a noneffective dose of rosuvastatin (0.5 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) plus a low dose of C21 (1 \u03bcg kg(-1) day(-1)) inhibited the PCNA labeling index, superoxide anion production, mRNA expressions of NAD(P)H subunits, and mRNA and protein expressions of inflammatory markers associated with marked inhibition of neointima formation. Angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor mRNA expression did not differ the groups. By contrast, AT2 receptor mRNA expression was increased by administration of C21 at the dose of 10 \u03bcg kg(-1) day(-1) but not by C21 at the dose of 1 \u03bcg kg(-1) day(-1) or rosuvastatin. The combination of rosuvastatin and AT2 receptor agonist exerted synergistic preventive effects on vascular remodeling associated with the decreases in cell proliferation, oxidative stress, and inflammatory reaction. That could be a powerful approach to vascular disease prevention."
