We analysed blood cholesterol, triglyceride, albumin, fibrinogen and gammaglobulin levels, haematocrite, hemoglobin, erythrocyte, leukocyte and platelet counts, blood and plasma viscosity and erythrocyte rigidity in 12 rabbits fed on a normal diet (chow) which were given 1 mg/kg/day atorvastatin for 4 weeks. Compared to the baseline levels, erythrocyte rigidity (k=0.12+/-0.05 vs. k=0.7+/-0.02) and gammaglobulin levels (1.03+/-0.23 g/dl vs. 0.78+/-0.27 g/dl) decreased significantly (p=0.008 and p=0.025, respectively). Blood lipids, hematological variables, blood and plasma viscosity did not change statistically. Our findings imply that in a normolipemic state, statins given in low doses may improve erythrocyte rigidity without altering blood lipids in short term. Decreased plasma gammaglobulin levels may be reflecting their immunomodulatory effects.", 
    "1": "Atherosclerosis is characterized by macrophage foam cells formation, which originate from differentiating blood monocytes that have taken up oxidized LDL (Ox-LDL) at enhanced rate. Statin therapy exhibit pleiotropic effects on many components of atherosclerosis. We have studied the effect of atorvastatin therapy in hypercholesterolemic patients, on the cellular uptake of Ox-LDL by their monocytes during differentiation into macrophages. Eleven hypercholesterolemic men were treated with 20 mg/day of atorvastatin for a period of 1 month. Peripheral blood monocytes harvested from control subjects and from patients before and after atorvastatin therapy were allowed to differentiate in culture for up to 9 days in the presence of 20% autologous serum. In control monocytes/macrophages the cellular uptake of Ox-LDL and the scavenger receptors CD36, SRA-I and SRA-II mRNA expression were upregulated during differentiation, and this upregulation was significantly enhanced in cells from hypercholesterolemic patients. Atorvastatin therapy suppressed the upregulation in Ox-LDL degradation and scavenger receptors expression in differentiating monocytes. These effects could be related at least in part to antioxidant characteristics of atorvastatin. Reduced susceptibility of plasma to free radical-induced lipid peroxidation (by 35%), increased plasma total antioxidant status (TAS; by 30%), and increased serum paraoxonase activity (by 53%), were noted following drug therapy. We conclude that atorvastatin therapy in hypercholesterolemic patients reduces the enhanced cellular uptake of Ox-LDL during ex-vivo differentiation of monocytes into macrophages, and decreases cellular scavenger receptors gene expression. These effects may account for the attenuation of atherogenesis in hypercholesterolemic patients following atorvastatin treatment.", 
    "2": "We measured serum cholesterol concentrations and synthesis markers (e.g. serum lathosterol to cholesterol ratio), and absorption markers (e.g. serum campesterol to cholesterol ratio) of cholesterol in 319 good responders (GR; dose 20 mg up to 1 year) and in 115 poor responders (PR; dose increased at 6 weeks to 40 mg) among Finnish participants in the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study at baseline, 6 weeks and 1 year of the simvastatin treatment. The baseline cholesterol level and the ratios of the absorption markers were higher and those of the synthesis markers lower in PR than GR. The ratios of the precursor sterols were negatively related to the baseline cholesterol in GR only (P=0.003). The cholesterol levels, and the ratios of the precursor sterols were decreased and those of the absorption marker sterols increased less consistently in PR than GR by 20 mg, the group differences being only slightly lessened by the dose addition to 40 mg. One-year differences were still frequently significant. The baseline cholesterol concentrations were negatively related to the reduction of the precursor sterol ratios in GR, the change of cholesterol being positively related to those of the synthesis markers and negatively to those of the absorption markers only in PR. Thus, patients needing large statin dose for cholesterol normalization have high absorption and low synthesis of cholesterol, yet baseline synthesis is inversely related to cholesterol level only in GR. The synthesis rate is less markedly reduced by the large than by the small statin dose in the PR, and the reduction is related, in contrast to that in the GR, to lowering of cholesterol.", 
    "3": "Subjects with moderate combined hyperlipidemia (n=11) were assessed in an investigation of the effects of atorvastatin and simvastatin (both 40 mg per day) on apolipoprotein B (apoB) metabolism. The objective of the study was to examine the mechanism by which statins lower plasma triglyceride levels. Patients were studied on three occasions, in the basal state, after 8 weeks on atorvastatin or simvastatin and then again on the alternate treatment. Atorvastatin produced significantly greater reductions than simvastatin in low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (49.7 vs. 44.1% decrease on simvastatin) and plasma triglyceride (46.4 vs. 39.4% decrease on simvastatin). ApoB metabolism was followed using a tracer of deuterated leucine. Both drugs stimulated direct catabolism of large very low density lipoprotein (VLDL(1)) apoB (4.52+/-3.06 pools per day on atorvastatin; 5.48+/-4.76 pools per day on simvastatin versus 2.26+/-1.65 pools per day at baseline (both P<0.05)) and this was the basis of the 50% reduction in plasma VLDL(1) concentration; apoB production in this fraction was not significantly altered. On atorvastatin and simvastatin the fractional transfer rates (FTR) of VLDL(1) to VLDL(2) and of VLDL(2) to intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL) were increased significantly, in the latter instance nearly twofold. IDL apoB direct catabolism rose from 0.54+/-0.30 pools per day at baseline to 1.17+/-0.87 pools per day on atorvastatin and to 0.95+/-0.43 pools per day on simvastatin (both P<0.05). Similarly the fractional transfer rate for IDL to LDL conversion was enhanced 58-84% by statin treatment (P<0.01) LDL apoB fractional catabolic rate (FCR) which was low at baseline in these subjects (0.22+/-0.04 pools per day) increased to 0.44+/-0.11 pools per day on atorvastatin and 0.38+/-0.11 pools per day on simvastatin (both P<0.01). ApoB-containing lipoproteins were more triglyceride-rich and contained less free cholesterol and cholesteryl ester on statin therapy. Further, patients on both treatments showed marked decreases in all LDL subfractions. In particular the concentration of small dense LDL (LDL-III) fell 64% on atorvastatin and 45% on simvastatin. We conclude that in patients with moderate combined hyperlipidemia who initially have a low FCR for VLDL and LDL apoB, the principal action of atorvastatin and simvastatin is to stimulate receptor-mediated catabolism across the spectrum of apoB-containing lipoproteins. This leads to a substantial, and approximately equivalent, percentage reduction in plasma triglyceride and LDL cholesterol.", 
    "4": "Raman spectroscopy allows quantitative, non-destructive evaluation of entire, intact atherosclerotic plaques. We quantified the anti-atherosclerotic effects of atorvastatin and amlodipine on progression of atherosclerosis using post-mortem Raman spectroscopic plaque imaging in 28 APOE*3 Leiden transgenic mice who were fed a high fat/high cholesterol diet for 28 weeks. Mice were assigned to a control group receiving the diet alone or to groups that received the diet with either 0.01% w/w atorvastatin, 0.002% w/w amlodipine, or the combination. The entire excised aortic arch was scanned with Raman microspectroscopy for quantitation of the distribution of cholesterol and calcification content. When mice had been treated with atorvastatin, cholesterol accumulation and calcification in the aortic arch was reduced by 91 and 98%, respectively, (both P<0.001). Amlodipine did not reduce the cholesterol content but reduced calcification of the aorta by 69% (P<0.05). The combination of amlodipine and atorvastatin was as effective as atorvastatin alone. This study demonstrates the strong atheroprotective potential of atorvastatin. In addition it is demonstrated that amlodipine reduces mineralization of atherosclerotic plaque. No synergistic effect of the combination of amlodipine and atorvastatin on plaque development is demonstrated. This study encourages Raman spectroscopic evaluations of anti-atherosclerotic drugs in larger animals and humans in vivo.", 
    "5": "Inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase (statins) reveal important pharmacological effects in addition to reducing the plasma LDL cholesterol level. In the pathogenesis of arteriosclerosis, transendothelial migration of various leukocytes including monocytes is a crucial step. We, therefore, investigated the expression of E-selectin, intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in vascular endothelial cells as influenced by lovastatin. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) express significant amounts of selectins and cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) within a few hours after stimulation with TNF-alpha. This effect is potentiated by 100-200% when the cells are pretreated with 0.1-2.5 microM lovastatin. The lovastatin-mediated increase in the cytoplasm and at the cell surface is dose-dependent and significant at lovastatin concentrations comparable to plasma levels in patients under lovastatin treatment. The lovastatin-potentiated increase of E-selectin and CAMs is correlated with a corresponding increase of selectin- and CAM-specific mRNA. We conclude that, in vivo, statin treatment could trigger an enhanced recruitment of macrophages that might support the cholesteryl ester efflux from the arteriosclerotic plaque.", 
    "6": "Patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) often have abnormalities of lipid metabolism or coagulation and fibrinolysis, these patients may thus be more susceptible to atherosclerosis than those on hemodialysis. It has been reported that hypercoagulability and hyperfibrinolysis are correlated with abnormalities of lipid metabolism. Therefore, we investigated the effect of a decrease in lipids on the coagulation and fibrinolysis system in CAPD patients with hyperlipidemia who received lipid-lowering therapy. The patients included 5 men and 13 women, with a mean age of 52.5 years. Pravastatin sodium (10 mg/day) and ethyl icosapentate (1800 mg/day) were administered concomitantly for 8 weeks. Lipid levels and coagulation/fibrinolysis parameters were measured before and after therapy. The patients were divided into two groups depending on their response to therapy: responders showed a decrease in total cholesterol or triglycerides by at least 20% and non-responders showed less improvement. In the responders, the levels of protein C, tissue plasminogen activator/plasminogen activator inhibitor-I complex, factor XIII, alpha2-plasmin inhibitor, and D-dimer were significantly lower after therapy than before therapy. Protein C, factor XIII, and alpha2-plasmin inhibitor were also significantly decreased after therapy in non-responders, but the extent of the decrease was smaller. The plasminogen level was significantly increased after therapy in non-responders. These findings suggest that a decrease in lipid levels and/or some other action by lipid-lowering agents may correct abnormalities of coagulation and fibrinolysis in CAPD patients.", 
    "7": "Two hundred and twenty two hyperlipidemic patients were recruited for a 12-week prospective, multicenter, open-label, titrate-to-goal study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 20 to 40 mg per day of simvastatin in a Thai population. The efficacy on lipid lowering was evaluated at 4 weeks and 8 weeks after medication. Based on NCEP ATP II guideline and ADA position statement, subjects were categorized into three groups according to LDL-C goals; group I: patients without CHD and with < 2 CHD risk factors, group II: patients without CHD and with > or = 2 CHD risk factors and group III: CHD patients or diabetic patients with > or = 1 risk factors. Significant changes of all lipid parameters from baselines were noted at 4 weeks after medication except for HDL-C levels. Reduction of serum LDL-C, TC and TG by 40 per cent, 29 per cent and 16 per cent respectively and increase of serum HDL-C by 5 per cent were observed at 8 weeks of therapy (p<0.05). At 4 weeks after taking simvastatin 20 mg/day, 78.9 per cent of patients in group I, 67.4 per cent in group II and 40.9 per cent in group III achieved LDL-C goals. Seventeen per cent of the patients who were evaluated at 8 weeks increased the simvastatin dosage to 40 mg per day in the second month of treatment. At 8 weeks of therapy with simvastatin 20-40 mg/day, 90.1 per cent of patients in group I, 77.4 per cent in group II and 66.7 per cent in group III achieved LDL-C goals. Adverse symptoms during therapy, mostly mild, developed in 6.3 per cent of the 222 patients.",

Using multivariate logistic regression, coronary angioplasty was an independent predictor of treatment with aspirin (odds ratio 3.55), statins (1.92), and beta blockers (1.41). Compared with treatment at discharge, only statin use differed at six months, with a significant increase both in patients treated medically and in those who had undergone angioplasty. Increased use of statins, aspirin, and beta blockers was significantly correlated with coronary angioplasty during the initial hospital stay.",

    "16": "In this study, we asked whether simvastatin can influence in vitro and in vivo production of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. A total of 107 hypercholesterolemic patients were treated with simvastatin. As measured by ELISA, serum levels of cytokines significantly decreased after 6 weeks of treatment (P<0.05). Furthermore, simvastatin decreased the expression of IL-6, IL-8, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 mRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Similar results were obtained in vitro by using cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy normolipemic donors. Exposure to simvastatin, atorvastatin, or cerivastatin caused downregulation of the expression of cytokine mRNA in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, all statins tested were able to reduce the concentrations of cytokines in cellular and extracellular fractions of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (P<0.05).",

Autologous 131I-labeled LDL was reinjected intravenously in addition to 125I-labeled albumin, and the 1-hour fractional escape rates were taken as indices of transvascular transport. Both parameters were normally distributed, and they were tightly correlated (R2=0.69, P<0.0001). Transvascular LDL transport was 5.4+/-2.9%/h and 4.1+/-1.5%/h in patients with diabetes and control subjects, respectively (P<0.05); equivalent values for albumin were 6.5+/-2.5%/h and 5.3+/-1.6%/h (P<0.05).

Whereas conventional ultrasonography is limited to thin 2-dimensional image planes, 3-dimensional (3D) ultrasonography provides quantitative measurement of the entire carotid artery plaque volume. This study aims to assess the feasibility of 3D ultrasonography to monitor plaque progression in hypercholesterolemic patients.",

All patients were maintained on a lipid-lowering diet. Sixteen patients were additionally treated with statins.

    "29": "Lipid lowering treatment with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statins) may reduce morbidity and mortality in patients with stable ischaemic heart disease. In trials where a statin was used as secondary prevention after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), the treatment was initiated 3-6 months after the event. A high rate of serious complications occurs in the unstable clinical state after an ACS, including myocardial infarction and death. The incidence rate of serious complications declines after 1 month and then gradually diminishes. It has not been determined whether initiation of treatment with a statin soon after an ACS reduces the occurrence of early coronary events. Statins have effects on the vessel wall other than the lipid lowering effect, and these may partly account for the benefit of statin therapy. Whether these mechanisms are associated with a prognostic effect soon after an ACS has not been clarified.", 
    "30": "Lovastatin, a drug successfully used in the clinic to prevent and to treat coronary heart disease, has recently been reported to decrease the incidence of melanoma in lovastatin-treated patients. Lovastatin has also been proved to potentiate antitumor effects of both cisplatin and TNF-alpha in murine melanoma models. Recently, an augmented therapeutic effect of lovastatin and doxorubicin has been reported in 3 tumor models in mice. In our preliminary study lovastatin caused retardation of melanoma growth in mice treated with doxorubicin (Feleszko et al. J Natl Cancer Inst 1998;90:247-8). In the present report, we supplement our preliminary observations and demonstrate in 2 murine and 2 human melanoma cell lines that lovastatin effectively potentiates the cytostatic/cytotoxic activity of doxorubicin in vitro via an augmentation of apoptosis (estimated with PARP-cleavage assay, annexin V assay and TUNEL). The combined antiproliferative activity of lovastatin and doxorubicin was evaluated using the combination index (CI) method of Chou and Talalay, revealing synergistic interactions in melanoma cells exposed to lovastatin and doxorubicin. In B16F10 murine melanoma model in vivo, we have demonstrated significantly increased sensitivity to the combined treatment with both lovastatin (5 mg/kg for 14 days) and doxorubicin (4 x 1 mg/kg) as compared with either agent acting alone. Lovastatin treatment resulted also in significant reduction of the number of experimental metastasis in doxorubicin-treated mice. The results of our studies suggest that lovastatin may enhance the effectiveness of chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of malignant melanomas.",

Analyses are of the first occurrence of particular events, and compare all simvastatin-allocated versus all placebo-allocated participants. These \"intention-to-treat\" comparisons assess the effects of about two-thirds (85% minus 17%) taking a statin during the scheduled 5-year treatment period, which yielded an average difference in LDL cholesterol of 1.0 mmol/L (about two-thirds of the effect of actual use of 40 mg simvastatin daily). Primary outcomes were mortality (for overall analyses) and fatal or non-fatal vascular events (for subcategory analyses), with subsidiary assessments of cancer and of other major morbidity.", 
    "33": "All-cause mortality was significantly reduced (1328 [12.9%] deaths among 10,269 allocated simvastatin versus 1507 [14.7%] among 10,267 allocated placebo; p=0.0003), due to a highly significant 18% (SE 5) proportional reduction in the coronary death rate (587 [5.7%] vs 707 [6.9%]; p=0.0005), a marginally significant reduction in other vascular deaths (194 [1.9%] vs 230 [2.2%]; p=0.07), and a non-significant reduction in non-vascular deaths (547 [5.3%] vs 570 [5.6%]; p=0.4). There were highly significant reductions of about one-quarter in the first event rate for non-fatal myocardial infarction or coronary death (898 [8.7%] vs 1212 [11.8%]; p<0.0001), for non-fatal or fatal stroke (444 [4.3%] vs 585 [5.7%]; p<0.0001), and for coronary or non-coronary revascularisation (939 [9.1%] vs 1205 [11.7%]; p<0.0001). For the first occurrence of any of these major vascular events, there was a definite 24% (SE 3; 95% CI 19-28) reduction in the event rate (2033 [19.8%] vs 2585 [25.2%] affected individuals; p<0.0001). During the first year the reduction in major vascular events was not significant, but subsequently it was highly significant during each separate year. The proportional reduction in the event rate was similar (and significant) in each subcategory of participant studied, including: those without diagnosed coronary disease who had cerebrovascular disease, or had peripheral artery disease, or had diabetes; men and, separately, women; those aged either under or over 70 years at entry; and--most notably--even those who presented with LDL cholesterol below 3.0 mmol/L (116 mg/dL), or total cholesterol below 5.0 mmol/L (193 mg/dL). The benefits of simvastatin were additional to those of other cardioprotective treatments. The annual excess risk of myopathy with this regimen was about 0.01%. There were no significant adverse effects on cancer incidence or on hospitalisation for any other non-vascular cause.", 
    "34": "Adding simvastatin to existing treatments safely produces substantial additional benefits for a wide range of high-risk patients, irrespective of their initial cholesterol concentrations. Allocation to 40 mg simvastatin daily reduced the rates of myocardial infarction, of stroke, and of revascularisation by about one-quarter. After making allowance for non-compliance, actual use of this regimen would probably reduce these rates by about one-third. Hence, among the many types of high-risk individual studied, 5 years of simvastatin would prevent about 70-100 people per 1000 from suffering at least one of these major vascular events (and longer treatment should produce further benefit). The size of the 5-year benefit depends chiefly on such individuals' overall risk of major vascular events, rather than on their blood lipid concentrations alone.",

    "40": "Statins with a closed-ring structure (mevastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin) and with an open-ring structure (pravastatin and fluvastatin) are widely used in the human population to manage hypercholesterolemia. These statins may have neuroprotective or neurotoxic effects, but these effects remain controversial. We have utilized adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate-induced terminally differentiated murine neuroblastoma (NB) cells in culture as an experimental model to study the effect of statins. Results showed that mevastatin induced degenerative changes and reduced the viability of differentiated NB cells by inhibiting proteasome activity. Lactacystin, an established inhibitor of proteasome, also produced similar degenerative changes in these cells. In contrast, pravastatin neither affected the degeneration and viability of differentiated NB cells nor the proteasome activity. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of the extract obtained from mevastatin-treated growth medium and differentiated cells revealed that about 50% of mevastatin is converted to an open-ring structure in the growth medium; however, differentiated cells did not convert any portion of mevastatin into an open-ring structure and accumulated only mevastatin with a closed-ring structure. Mevalonic acid lactone by itself did not affect the viability of differentiated NB cells or the proteasome activity, but it completely prevented mevastatin-induced degeneration and decreased viability by reducing the uptake of mevastatin and by blocking its action on proteasome activity. Mevalonic acid failed to prevent lactacystin-induced degeneration and inhibition of proteasome activity. Our results suggest that mevastatin could act as a neurotoxic agent or neuroprotective agent, depending upon the extent of its hydrolysis to an open-ring structure and the level of mevalonic acid.", 
    "41": "Recent experimental and epidemiologic studies have suggested that the lipid-lowering drugs, statins, may have bone-protective effects. We studied the effects of statin use on the change in bone mineral density (BMD) in a prospective 4.5-year cohort study based on subjects from the Kuopio Osteoporosis Risk Factor and Prevention (OSTPRE) Study, Finland. Six hundred and twenty women aged 53-64 years were divided into four groups: 55 women reported continuous and 63 women occasional statin use during the follow-up; 142 non-users of statins reported hypercholesterolemia whereas 360 non-users did not. Spinal and femoral BMDs were measured by dual-energy X-ray densitometry in 1995-1996 and 1999-2000 and the BMD changes of the four groups were compared. Characteristics of the study population were obtained with postal inquiries. The mean annual spinal and femoral BMD changes of the study groups were 0.29% and -0.50% for the continuous statin users, 0.19% and -0.57% for the occasional statin users, 0.52% and -0.29% for the hypercholesterolemic non-users of statins, and 0.39% and -0.33% for the non-users of statins without hypercholesterolemia, ( p = 0.398 and p = 0.404) respectively. The corresponding BMD changes adjusted for age, years since menopause, body mass index, BMD at baseline, calcium intake, estrogen and cortisone therapy, duration of follow-up and statin use before the baseline were -0.20% and -0.47%, 0.19% and -0.54%, 0.54% and -0.32%, 0.47% and -0.33% ( p = 0.134 and p = 0.628), respectively. Our results suggest that statins do not protect from early postmenopausal bone loss. Randomized trials are needed to confirm these results.", 
    "42": "Recent studies have suggested that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl - coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) can increase the bone mineral density (BMD). Our objective was to determine if patients on statin drugs were more likely to have a greater bone mineral density and lower risk of osteoporosis than patients not taking these drugs. A computerized pharmacy system provided complete medication dispensing records for the 983 patients (697 men and 286 women) referred for bone mineral density testing at a single Veterans Affairs Medical Center. In an analysis of covariance model that adjusted for age, body mass index, race, and vitamin use, men using statin drugs were more likely to have a greater BMD of the spine (p < 0.005). The mean difference (effect size) was 0.05 g/cm2 (95% confidence interval of [CL] 0.02-0.09), about 5.3% greater BMD. In women, the association was not significant. The risk of osteoporosis (defined as a T-score < or = -2.5) was determined using logistic regression analysis after adjustment for potential confounding variables. Although not statistically significant, men who received statin drugs for more than 2 yr were approximately half as likely to develop osteoporosis (odds ratio [OR] =.55, 95% CI = 0.28-1.08). A similar effect was observed in women taking statins for any length of time (OR = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.12-1.07). This study suggests that statin drugs may decrease osteoporosis risk, warranting a randomized controlled trial.", 
    "43": "Both men and women lose bone at a late age (aging bone loss). The aim of this study was to determine whether cerivastatin and parathyroid hormone (PTH) can prevent aging bone loss in men. Bone loss in aged male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats was used as a model for age-related bone loss in men. Nine-month-old male SD rats were divided into six groups: (1) baseline controls (killed at the beginning of the study); (2) age-matched controls; (3) parathyroid hormone (PTH; 80 microg/kg body weight per day for 5 days/week) treated; (4) low-dose cerivastatin (0.2 mg/kg body weight per day) treated; and (5) medium-dose cerivastatin (0.4 mg/kg body weight per day) treated; and (6) high-dose cerivastatin (0.8 mg/kg body weight per day) treated. Groups 2-6 were treated for 23 weeks between the ages of 9 and 15 months and killed at the end of 23 weeks. The fourth lumbar vertebra was analyzed using peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT). It is shown that age-matched controls had decreased cancellous bone mineral content (Cn. BMC) by 19% (p < 0.05) and cancellous bone mineral density Cn. BMD) by 22% (p < 0.01) when compared with baseline controls. All three doses of cerivastatin resulted in lower Cn. BMC and Cn. BMD when compared with age-matched controls, but this decrease was not statistically significant. In the PTH-treated group, Cn. BMC increased by 5% (p < 0.0001) and Cn. BMD increased by 37% (p < 0.0001) when compared with age-matched controls. In age-matched controls, cortical bone mineral content (Ct. BMC) and cortical bone mineral density (Ct. BMD) decreased slightly, but not significantly, when compared with baseline controls. Ct. BMD did not change significantly at any of the three doses in the cerivastatin-treated groups. In the PTH-treated group, Ct. BMC increased by 23% (p < 0.0001) when compared with age-matched controls. We confirmed that male SD rats lose bone with aging in the lumbar vertebra, and it is concluded that cerivastatin, at all doses administered, did not prevent this age-related bone loss. In contrast, PTH prevented age-related bone loss in the vertebra of male SD rats.",

There was a trend to an increase in serum albumin (31.0 +/- 1.3 g/L vs. 33.8 +/- 1.5 g/L; P = 0.078) and FMD improved significantly following treatment (3.7 +/- 1.1% vs. 7.0 +/- 0.8%, P < 0.01). After washout, FMD deteriorated significantly to 3.5 +/- 1.4% (P < 0.05) versus week 12 FMD. GTNMD was unchanged. In multivariate regression, reduction in non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol (beta - 0.736, P = 0.027) and increase in serum albumin (beta 0.723, P = 0.028), but not the on-treatment level of non-HDL-cholesterol, were significant independent predictors of improvement in FMD after adjusting for change in resting brachial artery diameter. Changes in serum lipoprotein and albumin concentrations off treatment were not associated with deterioration in FMD.",

Forty subjects (26 males and 14 females, mean age+/-SD 50.3+/-3.7 yr) with isolated hypercholesterolemia (> or =240 mg/dl) were selected from a population of 250 patients who attended the outpatient department of our institution for symptomatic extrasystolic activity (ventricular premature complexes >3,000/24 h). Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either simvastatin 40 mg/d or placebo for 3 consecutive months. After treatment, subjects in the simvastatin group presented a significant decrease of total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol (p<0.001) and an increase of HDL-cholesterol levels (p<0.01), associated with a reduction of both QTc dispersion (p<0.001) and ventricular premature complexes (p<0.001). None of these changes were observed in the placebo group. At baseline, there was a relationship between cholesterol levels, ventricular premature complexes (VPC) (r=0.33, p<0.05) and QTc dispersion (r=0.41, p<0.01). After treatment, reductions in serum cholesterol levels correlated with decreases of both VPCs (r=0.37, p<0.01) and QTc dispersion (r=0.49, p<0.01). In subjects with isolated hypercholesterolemia simvastatin may reduce the cardiovascular risk associated with ventricular electrical instability.", 
    "49": "In this double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study, normally cycling women (n = 86) with elevated low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels were studied over six menstrual cycles. At the end of the screening phase, participants received placebo for the second menstrual cycle and subsequently were randomized to receive either placebo or simvastatin (40 mg/d) for the next four cycles. The second and sixth menstrual cycles were considered baseline and treatment cycles, respectively. Participants kept a menstrual diary throughout the study and provided daily first-void urine samples during cycles 2 and 6. Urine samples were assayed for LH and pregnanediol glucuronide (PdG). The primary end point was change in luteal phase duration as defined by the day of the urinary LH peak to the day preceding the onset of menstruation. Treatment with simvastatin (40 mg/d) effectively lowered LDL-C by 34.3% (P < 0.001). Simvastatin was generally well tolerated, and no meaningful difference in adverse event profile was observed between treatment groups. Compared with the placebo group, simvastatin did not have clinically relevant effects on luteal phase duration, peak PdG concentration, or integrated luteal phase PdG concentration. The results of this study demonstrate that treatment of healthy premenopausal women for approximately 4 months with simvastatin (40 mg/d) lowers LDL-C without adversely affecting reproductive gonadal function. Simvastatin should not be used during pregnancy or by nursing mothers.", 
    "50": "Biosynthesis of the isoprenoid precursor isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) proceeds via two distinct pathways. Sequence comparisons and microbiological data suggest that multidrug-resistant strains of gram-positive cocci employ exclusively the mevalonate pathway for IPP biosynthesis. Bacterial mevalonate pathway enzymes therefore offer potential targets for development of active site-directed inhibitors for use as antibiotics. We used the PCR and Enterococcus faecalis genomic DNA to isolate the mvaS gene that encodes 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) synthase, the second enzyme of the mevalonate pathway. mvaS was expressed in Escherichia coli from a pET28 vector with an attached N-terminal histidine tag. The expressed enzyme was purified by affinity chromatography on Ni(2+)-agarose to apparent homogeneity and a specific activity of 10 micromol/min/mg. Analytical ultracentrifugation showed that the enzyme is a dimer (mass, 83.9 kDa; s(20,w), 5.3). Optimal activity occurred in 2.0 mM MgCl(2) at 37(o)C. The DeltaH(a) was 6,000 cal. The pH activity profile, optimum activity at pH 9.8, yielded a pK(a) of 8.8 for a dissociating group, presumably Glu78. The stoichiometry per monomer of acetyl-CoA binding was 1.2 +/- 0.2 and that of covalent acetylation was 0.60 +/- 0.02. The K(m) for the hydrolysis of acetyl-CoA was 10 microM. Coupled conversion of acetyl-CoA to mevalonate was demonstrated by using HMG-CoA synthase and acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase/HMG-CoA reductase from E. faecalis.", 
    "51": "Lipoprotein subclass measurements may enhance the prediction of coronary artery disease (CAD) risk, but clinical application of such information has been hindered by the relatively laborious and time-consuming nature of laboratory measurement methods. In this study, lipoprotein subclass analyses were performed on frozen plasma samples from 241 participants in the Pravastatin Limitation of Atherosclerosis in the Coronary arteries Trial using an automated nuclear magnetic resonance technique. The objective was to determine if levels of these subclasses provided additional information on the progression of CAD, based on the change in the minimum lumen diameter, over a 3-year period. After adjustment for race, sex, age, treatment group, baseline lumen diameter, and chemically measured levels of triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, on-trial predictors (p <0.05) of progression included an elevated LDL particle number, and levels of small LDL and small HDL. Within treatment groups, CAD progression was most strongly related to the LDL particle number (placebo) and levels of small HDL (pravastatin). In logistic regression models that adjusted for chemically determined lipid levels and other covariates, a small LDL level > or = 30 mg/dl (median) was associated with a ninefold increased risk of CAD progression (p <0.01) in the placebo group. These results indicate that levels of various lipoprotein subclasses may provide useful information on CAD risk even if levels of traditional risk factors are known.", 
    "52": "Agents that either increase (cholestyramine, CS) or decrease (lovastatin, Lov) de novo peripheral cholesterol synthesis may increase (CS) or decrease (Lov) ras protein membrane localization by altering protein prenylation, and potentially have pro- or anti-carcinogenic effects. Male A/J, Swiss, and C57/BL6 mice were treated with 2 or 4% CS, 1% dietary niacin, or 25mg/kg of Lov three times per week (Lov-3X) or five times per week (Lov-5X). After 3 weeks, serum cholesterol and triglycerides were determined enzymatically. Membrane and cytoplasmic K-ras proteins in lung were determined by immunoprecipitation followed by western blotting with a K-ras specific antibody. Results confirmed the hypothesis only in isolated instances. A/J mice had a significant 30% increase in cytoplasmic K-ras and a 40% decrease in membrane K-ras from Lov treatment, as predicted. C57/BL6 mice had a significant 77% increase in membrane K-ras, as expected from CS feeding. At variance with the hypothesis, Swiss mice had increased levels (3-28%) of membrane K-ras with all treatments (including Lov), and C57/BL6 mice treated with Lov had a 58-78% increase in cytoplasmic K-ras without any reduction in the levels of membrane K-ras. Niacin, predicted to have no effect on ras membrane localization, decreased cytoplasmic K-ras in A/J mice, increased both membrane and cytoplasmic K-ras in Swiss mice, and had no effect in C57/BL6 mice. Results may have differed from those predicted because of strain-dependent differences in response to the cholesterol-lowering agents. A difference in response among the mouse strains suggests that individual genetic differences may alter the effect of hypocholesterolemic agents on K-ras membrane localization, and potentially the risk of ras-dependent cancer.",

In bone cells, these inhibitors increase the gene expression of bone morphogenetic protein-2, which is an autocrine-paracrine factor for osteoblast differentiation. The findings that statins increase bone formation and bone mass in rodents suggest a potential new action for these compounds, which may be beneficial in patients with established osteoporosis where marked bone loss has occurred. Recent clinical data suggest that they may reduce the risk of fracture in patients taking these drugs.", 
    "54": "Proteinuria is an important risk factor for cardiovascular and renal morbidity and mortality. The effects of 3-hydroxy-3-methyglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin) therapy on proteinuria in normolipidemic patients with well-controlled hypertension have not been studied. A total of 63 normolipidemic (total cholesterol <240 mg/dL) and proteinuric (300 to 3000 mg/d) patients with well-controlled blood pressure (<140/90 mm Hg) were randomized to receive either placebo (n=32) or pravastatin (10 mg/d; n=31) after a 3-month placebo period. Pravastatin lowered proteinuria after 6 months by 54% (P<0.0001). Creatinine clearance was stable throughout the study in the 2 groups. Despite unchanged plasma endothelin-1 levels throughout the study, urinary excretion of the peptide was decreased and significantly correlated with improvement in urinary protein excretion in pravastatin-treated patients (r=0.64, P=0.001). The urinary excretion of retinol-binding protein decreased after pravastatin administration, probably reflecting an improvement in tubular function. In contrast, the urinary excretion of IgG did not change significantly throughout the study in either group. Multivariate analysis revealed that proteinuria was only significantly correlated with statin use (P<0.0001, R2= 0.66). Linear regression analysis in the statin-treated group did not show any correlation between changes in lipid profiles and proteinuria regression. Thus, in addition to their primary function of antilipidemia, the addition of pravastatin to treatment for well-controlled hypertension may have an additive effect on reducing proteinuria independent of hemodynamics and lipid-lowering effects, possibly through inhibiting renal endothelin-1 synthesis and improving tubular function.", 
    "55": "Epidemiological evidence and clinical trials with fibrate therapy show a clear relationship between low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and cardiovascular risk. In addition to lowering plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides (TG), the hydroxy-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins), also raise the levels of HDL-C. This review summarizes the results of five randomized, multicenter studies in hypercholesterolaemic patients in which multiple doses of atorvastatin and simvastatin were compared for their effects on lipids and lipoproteins including HDL-C. Both statins reduced LDL cholesterol and achieved parallel decreases in TG, with atorvastatin showing a slight overall superiority in these studies. Both HDL-C and apolipoprotein (Apo) A-I, its associated apoprotein, were significantly and consistently increased by all doses of simvastatin. However, atorvastatin had a different dose-response effect from simvastatin on both lipid parameters. Whereas HDL-C and Apo A-I were elevated by low doses of atorvastatin, the effect diminished markedly with increasing dose suggesting a possible negative dose-response effect. At higher doses, simvastatin increased HDL-C and Apo A-I significantly more than atorvastatin. These data indicate that statins may not be identical in all their clinical properties relevant to reducing the risks of atherosclerosis.",

However, recent work suggests that statins may exert immunosuppressive effects in isolated lymphocytes and in solid organ transplant recipients. Fluvastatin does not interfere with the metabolism of commonly used immunosuppressive agents and, therefore, may have benefits in transplant recipients. 2. The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential immunomodulatory effects of fluvastatin in vitro in human lymphocytes and the underlying effects on signal transduction. 3. In vitro, fluvastatin (10 micromol/L) caused a time-dependent inhibition of T cell proliferation in response to cross-linking of CD3. 4. Thymidine incorporation was reduced by 22, 81 and 92% at days 1, 3 and 5, respectively. 5. Mevalonate (1 micromol/L) treatment for 4 or 24 h significantly reduced the inhibitory effects of fluvastatin; the reversal was abrogated by simultaneous exposure to mevalonate and a farnesyl transferase inhibitor. 6. At a subcellular level, fluvastatin treatment was associated with reduced functional activity of Ras-dependent extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathways and of Rho-dependent p38 activation. 7. These data suggest that the potential immunosuppressive actions of statins involve inhibition of subcellular pathways dependent on isoprenylation of signal peptides, including Ras, Rho and related G-proteins.", 
    "62": "The microsomal enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase and the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor pathway carry out a key role on cholesterol homeostasis in eucaryotic cells. The HMG-CoA reductase is sensitive to oxidative inactivation and to phosphorylation by many kinases that are able to inactivate the protein and increase its susceptibility to proteolysis. We previously demonstrated that a calf thymus Cu,Zn SOD affects cholesterol metabolism. This protein binds with rat hepatocyte cell membrane by a specific surface membrane receptor. The involvement of Cu,Zn SOD in cholesterol metabolism is confirmed further by the presence of this antioxidant enzyme in circulating serum lipoproteins. We studied the effect of native human Cu,Zn SOD, metal-free SOD (apo SOD), and SOD-inactivated with hydrogen peroxide on cholesterol metabolism in human hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells. Results showed that all forms of SODs used, at the concentration of 150 ng/ml, are able to affect cholesterol metabolism decreasing both HMG-CoA reductase activity and its protein levels; this inhibitory effect is accompanied by reduced cholesterol synthesis measured as [14C]acetate incorporation into [14C]cholesterol and by an increased [125I]LDL binding to HepG2 cells. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of Cu,Zn SOD on cholesterol synthesis was completely abolished when the cells were incubated with Cu,Zn SOD in the presence of bisindoilmaleimide (BDM), an inhibitor of protein kinase C (PKC); moreover, we demonstrated that Cu,Zn SOD as well as apo SOD was able to increase PKC activity. Overall, data demonstrate that Cu,Zn SOD affects cholesterol metabolism independently from its dismutase activity and its metal content and that the inhibitory action on cholesterol synthesis is mediated by an activation of protein kinase C.", 
    "63": "Atorvastatin is increasingly used as a cholesterol-lowering agent in solid organ transplant recipients receiving cyclosporine A (CsA). However, the potential bilateral pharmacokinetic interaction between atorvastatin and CsA in renal transplant recipients has not previously been examined. Baseline 12-h CsA pharmacokinetic investigation was performed in 21 renal transplant recipients and repeated after 4 weeks of atorvastatin treatment (10 mg/ d). At week 4, 24-h pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin was also performed. All patients received basiliximab induction followed by CsA and prednisolone immunosuppression. Compared with historic controls, CsA-treated patients showed, on average, sixfold higher plasma HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity after 4 weeks of atorvastatin treatment (p < 0.05). Atorvastatin had a moderate effect on the pharmacokinetics of CsA and reduced the AUC0-12 (area under curve, 0-12h) by 9.5 +/- 18% (p = 0.013) and Cmax (maximal concentration) by 13.5 +/- 24% (p =0.009), while C12 (trough level) was unchanged (p =0.42). Total and LDL cholesterol decreased by 26.8 +/- 8.4% (p < 0.0001) and 41.5 +/- 11.0% (p < 0.0001), respectively. Bilateral pharmacokinetic interaction between atorvastatin and CsA resulted in sixfold higher plasma HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity, but only a moderate decrease in systemic exposure of CsA.", 
    "64": "Statins block de novo synthesis of cholesterol by inhibiting the enzyme, HMG CoA reductase. The product of this reaction, mevalonic acid, is also a precursor of isoprenoids, molecules required for the activation of signalling G-proteins, such as Ras. Signal transduction pathways involving Ras are important for cell survival and this may be why statins induce apoptotic death of several cell types. Given that statins are used to treat vascular disease, it is surprising that no studies have been conducted on vascular endothelial cells. For this reason, we have tested the effect of fluvastatin (FS) on the endothelial cell line EA.hy 926. Here we show that FS, at concentrations from 1 to 2 microM, blocks growth and induces apoptosis of the endothelial cell line, EA.hy 926. As considerable redundancy exists in cell signalling pathways for cell survival, toxicity of FS under more physiological conditions might be prevented by pathways that do not require Ras, such as those activated by adrenal or sex steroids. To test this hypothesis, first RT-PCR analysis was performed for nuclear receptor mRNA expression. This revealed the presence of mRNA for the androgen receptor (AR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR). The effect of the AR agonist, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and the GR agonist, dexamethasone (Dex), was then tested. Whilst DHT (100 nM) had no effect on FS-induced cell death, Dex (1 microM) blocked FS-induced apoptosis. Cell cycle analysis revealed that 24 h exposure to FS prevented cells from leaving G(1) and 24-48 h later a marked sub-G(1) peak was observed. Dex was able to reduce the sub-G(1) peak, but it failed to reduce accumulation of cells in G(1). Further studies revealed that, in addition to blocking FS-induced apoptosis, Dex was able to block apoptosis of EA.hy 926 cells induced by serum deprivation, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, oxidants, DNA damage and mitochondrial disruption. This study strongly suggests that glucocorticoids have a role to play in preventing vascular injury and they may provide a reason why statins are apparently not toxic to vascular endothelial cells in vivo.", 
    "65": "Atorvastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, alters bulk myoplasmic Ca2+ regulation and inhibits phenotypic modulation and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle in culture. Nuclear Ca2+ (Ca(n)) signaling is tightly coupled to transcriptional events and cell growth. Therefore, we hypothesized that in vivo treatment with atorvastatin would attenuate alterations in mitogen-induced Ca(n) signaling associated with coronary atherosclerosis. Three groups of male Yucatan pigs were treated for 20 weeks: controls, alloxan-induced diabetics fed an atherogenic diet and diabetics fed an atherogenic diet plus atorvastatin (80 mg/day). Right coronary artery single-cell cytosolic Ca2+ (Ca(c)) and Ca(n) responses to the mitogen endothelin-1 (5 x 10(-8) M) were measured by laser confocal microscopy using the calcium indicator Fluo-4. We observed a 39% increase in Ca(c) and a 52% increase in Ca(n) responses to endothelin-1 in cells from diabetic dyslipidemic arteries compared to control. These alterations were prevented in animals treated with atorvastatin. We show that during proliferation, the nucleus of a smooth muscle cell becomes rounded and loses the characteristic multilobular shape, clefts and invaginations. Consistent with this, a redistribution of Ca2+ stores from a transnuclear morphology in controls to a more perinuclear morphology occurred in cells from diabetic dyslipidemic arteries and was prevented by atorvastatin. In addition, the peak Ca(n) responses to endothelin-1 were inversely correlated (r = 0.712) with the extent of the transnuclear distribution of Ca2+ stores and directly correlated (r = 0.874) with the extent of atherosclerosis, as assessed in vivo by intravascular ultrasound. These findings indicate that chronic treatment with atorvastatin directly decreases mitogen-induced Ca(n) mobilization, which we suggest is related to the spatial localization of Ca(n) stores.", 
    "66": "BACKGROUND: PROSPER was designed to investigate the benefits of treatment with pravastatin in elderly patients for whom a typical doctor might consider the prescription of statin therapy to be a realistic option. METHODS: The PROspective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk (PROSPER) is a randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled trial to test the hypothesis that treatment with pravastatin (40 mg/day) will reduce the risk of coronary heart disease death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, and fatal or non-fatal stroke in elderly men and women with pre-existing vascular disease or with significant risk of developing this condition. RESULTS: In Scotland, Ireland, and the Netherlands, 23,770 individuals were screened, and 5,804 subjects (2,804 men and 3,000 women), aged 70 to 82 years (average 75 years) and with baseline cholesterol 4.0-9.0 mmol/l, were randomised. Randomised subjects had similar distributions with respect to age, blood pressure, and body mass index when compared to the entire group of screenees, but had a higher prevalence of smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and a history of vascular disease. The average total cholesterol level at baseline was 5.4 mmol/l (men) and 6.0 mmol/l (women). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with previous prevention trials of cholesterol-lowering drugs, the PROSPER cohort is significantly older and for the first time includes a majority of women. The study, having achieved its initial goal of recruiting more than 5,500 elderly high-risk men and women, aims to complete all final subject follow-up visits in the first half of 2002 with the main results being available in the fourth quarter of 2002.",

We therefore examined the effects of simvastatin, a commonly prescribed statin, on the proliferation and migration of cultured human SV SMC and on neointima formation and MMP activity in human SV organ cultures. To clarify its mode of action, we studied in parallel the effects of a specific MMP inhibitor, marimastat.", 
    "72": "Human SV specimens were obtained from patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting, and were cultured for 14 days in the presence of three concentrations of simvastatin and subsequently processed for measurement of MMP activity and neointimal thickness measurements. Cultured SV SMCs were used to construct growth curves in the presence of 10% fetal calf serum or 10% fetal calf serum supplemented with simvastatin or marimastat. Migration through a Matrigel basement-membrane matrix (invasion) was quantified with modified Boyden chambers.", 
    "73": "Simvastatin dose dependently reduced neointima formation (P =.004) in association with reduced MMP-9 activity (P =.03). SMC proliferation and invasion also were inhibited with simvastatin (P <.007 and P <.009, respectively). Marimastat dose dependently inhibited SMC invasion (P <.001) but importantly had no effect on SMC proliferation (P >.36).", 
    "74": "For effective control of neointimal development in vivo, a pharmacologic strategy should inhibit both SMC migration and proliferation. The ancillary properties of 3-Hydroxy-3 methylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitors typified by simvastatin may be important in this regard.", 
    "75": "Ubiquinone, coenzyme Q, plays a pivotal role in electron transport and is a target for chemotherapy against a number of eukaryotic infectious agents, including Pneumocystis carinii. Coenzyme Q10 was previously identified as the major ubiquinone homolog in P. carinii isolated and purified from rat lungs; CoQ9 was also present. In contrast, CoQ9 and CoQ8 (but not CoQ10) were detected in the lungs of uninfected rat controls. These observations suggested that the pathogen synthesizes CoQ10, and perhaps CoQ9 as well. In the present study, CoQ biosynthesis in P. carinii was examined in greater detail. Radiolabeled mevalonate, a precursor of the CoQ polyprenyl chain, was incorporated in vitro into P. carinii ubiquinones. Incorporation of radiolabeled mevalonate into P. carinii CoQ was not enhanced by treating cells with lovastatin, suggesting that the cells did not transport the drug, or that a lovastatin-insensitive pathway for de novo synthesis of isoprenoids may also function in this organism. Radiolabeled precursors of the ring moiety, including shikimic acid, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, and tyrosine were also incorporated into P. carinii CoQ. Unexpectedly, it was found that not only CoQ9 and CoQ10, but also CoQ7, and CoQ8, were metabolically radiolabeled by all the precursors tested, indicating that the organism synthesizes CoQ7, CoQ8, CoQ9, and CoQ10. Metabolic radiolabeling of ubiquinones in rat lung controls was not detected in experiments using either radioactive mevalonate or p-hydroxybenzoate. Thus the incorporations measured using purified P. carinii preparations were due to the enzymes of the organism.", 
    "76": "There are conflicting data with regard to the effect of statins, including fluvastatin, on plasma fibrinogen levels. We undertook the present study to examine the influence of fluvastatin (40 mg/day) on plasma fibrinogen levels in hypercholesterolemic non-smoker patients with normal triglyceride levels (< 2.25 mmol/l) (n = 65). Fluvastatin administration was followed by a significant decrease of plasma fibrinogen levels by 8% (from 3.6 g/l to 3.33 g/l median value, p < 0.02). No correlation was found between the change in lipids and that in fibrinogen levels. Furthermore, there was no correlation between plasma fibrinogen levels and the change in fibrinogen concentration after fluvastatin administration. These results are in contrast with previously published data. However, the majority of the previous studies included patients with ischemic heart disease, unlike our study population. Furthermore, in some of these studies, which Included relatively small numbers of patients, there was a trend towards a decrease in plasma fibrinogen concentration after fluvastatin administration. We conclude that fluvastatin can significantly decrease plasma fibrinogen levels. However, more studies using fluvastatin and other drugs of this class are necessary to clarify this issue.", 
    "77": "Combined statin and fibrate therapy is often imperative for the improvement of the serum lipid profile in patients with mixed hyperlipidemia. However, the potential risk of myopathy has limited the widespread use of such therapy. Preferably this treatment should involve low optimally tolerable doses of hypolipidemic drugs. Thus, we undertook a study to determine the safety and efficacy of combination therapy with fibrates and small doses of atorvastatin. Twenty-two patients with mixed hyperlipidemia were started on a fibrate regimen (micronised fenofibrate 200mg/day or ciprofibrate 100 mg/day). Because after 12 weeks of therapy the fibrate failed to normalise the serum lipid profile, small doses of atorvastatin (5 mg/day) were added for a further 12 weeks. The administration of the fibrates resulted in a significant decrease in total and LDL-cholesterol levels, as well as in triglycerides, and an increase in HDL-cholesterol levels. The addition of atorvastatin (5 mg/day) resulted in a further decrease in total and LDL-cholesterol levels. Consequently, the hypolipidemic therapy target was achieved in most of the patents. Combination therapy was well tolerated and no significant increases in serum liver and muscle enzymes were noticed. We conclude that the careful administration of small doses of atorvastatin in patients with mixed dyslipidemia receiving fibrates is associated with a significant amelioration of lipid abnormalities.", 
    "78": "Lovastatin is an irreversible inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase and blocks the production of mevalonate, a critical compound in the production of cholesterol and isoprenoids. Isoprenylation of target proteins, like the GTP-binding protein Ras, is essential for their membrane localization and subsequent participation in intracellular signaling cascades. Lovastatin effectively decreased the viability of plasma cells from cell lines (n = 10) and myeloma patients' samples (n = 8) in a dose- and time-dependent way. Importantly, co-incubation of lovastatin with dexamethasone had a synergistic effect in inducing plasma cell cytotoxity. This effect was not the consequence of a change in the protein expression levels of Bcl-2 or Bax induced by lovastatin. The decrease in plasma cell viability was the result of induction of apoptosis and inhibition of proliferation. Mevalonate effectively reversed the cytotoxic and cytostatic effects of lovastatin in plasma cells. The cytotoxic activity of lovastatin was higher in Pgp expressing cell lines, but did not correlate with the multidrug resistance (MDR)-related proteins LRP, Bcl-2 and Bax. Lovastatin treatment resulted in a shift of Ras localization from the membrane to the cytosol that was reversed by mevalonate. The data presented in this paper warrant study of lovastatin alone or in combination with therapeutic drugs, in the treatment of myeloma patients.", 
    "79": "Statins exert antiinflammatory and antiproliferative actions independent of cholesterol lowering. To determine whether these actions might affect neointimal formation, we investigated the effect of simvastatin on the response to experimental angioplasty in LDL receptor-deficient (LDLR-/-) mice, a model of hypercholesterolemia in which changes in plasma lipids are not observed in response to simvastatin.",

After 7 and 28 days, intimal and medial sizes were measured and the intima to media area ratio (I:M) was calculated. Total plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels were similar in simvastatin- and vehicle-treated mice. Intimal thickening and I:M were reduced significantly by low- and high-dose simvastatin compared with vehicle alone. Simvastatin treatment was associated with reduced cellular proliferation (BrdU), leukocyte accumulation (CD45), and platelet-derived growth factor-induced phosphorylation of the survival factor Akt and increased apoptosis after injury.",

    "82": "A micellar electrokinetic chromatographic (MEKC) method was developed for the quantification of lovastatin and simvastatin, cholesterol lowering agents in pharmaceutical dosage forms. Lovastatin and simvastatin were separated using an electrolyte system consisting of 12% acetonitrile (v/v) in 25 mM sodium borate buffer pH 9.3 containing 25 mM sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) with an extended light path capillary (48.5 cm x 50 microm i.d, 40 cm to detector). The method has been validated and proven to be rugged. Calibration curves were linear over the studied ranges with correlation coefficients greater than 0.996. A limit of detection of 3.2 microg/ml and a limit of quantitation of 10.6 microg/ml were estimated for both the drugs. The proposed method was found to be suitable and accurate for the determination of these drugs in commercial formulations.",

NIDDM, especially obese one, linked by insulinoresistance and hyperinsulinemia, has different and complex anomalies by quality and quantity. There is a specific shape for this anomalies named \"B phenotype\" with high cardiovascular risk: rise LDL-chol charged with TG and low level of HDL-chol. We searched lipoproteins levels and the effects of simvastatin on aged persons (after 60 years). We randomised 158 cases with obese type II diabetes on a case control study. We concluded that only 28% had high TG levels and 71.8% had low levels of HDL-chol. For HDL-chol this percent is higher over 60 years old group (88.75%) (p < 0.001). Cholesterol has no significant high levels (28.55%) (p < 0.5), and aged group has almost normal levels of cholesterol and triglycerides (p < 0.0001). We administered simvastatin (Zocor) on 86% cases, therapeutically doses, during a period of 6 months to one year. Making lipidograms initially, after 6 months and a year, we proved good effects of Zocor, on lipoproteins levels: rise levels of HDL-chol (p < 0.005), moderate effect on LDL-chol (p < 0.01). At the same time the treatment improving the glucose tolerability to both groups (p < 0.002).",

A 22-year-old woman with FHH has been treated with a combination of H.E.L.P. apheresis (heparin-mediated extracorporeal LDL precipitation) and statins for 15 years. The combined treatment maintained a plasma LDL-cholesterol reduction from baseline of 840 to 122 mg/dL (85% reduction). In addition, H.E.L.P. apheresis reduced the elevated lipoprotein(a) and fibrinogen levels by 60% to 70%. All xanthomata disappeared. There is no evidence of premature atherosclerosis studied by means of electron beam computed tomography and (13)N-ammonia positron emission tomography: The entire coronary vasculature is free of calcifications. Her myocardial blood flow at rest (87 mL/100 g/min) and during stress (308 mL/100 g/min) and the coronary flow reserve (3.5) are normal after H.E.L.P. treatment. This case demonstrates the efficacy and safety of the combined treatment of H.E.L.P. apheresis and statins even in serious cases of FHH.", 
    "85": "Older men and women with coronary artery disease, prior stroke, peripheral arterial disease, and extracranial carotid arterial disease with a serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol > 125 mg/dL despite diet should be treated with lipid-lowering drug therapy, preferably with statins, to reduce the serum LDL cholesterol to < 100 mg/dL. If statin drug therapy does not lower the serum LDL cholesterol to < 100 mg/dL in older persons with coronary artery disease, a bile acid binding resin, such as cholestyramine, should be added, since this drug does not increase the incidence of myositis in persons taking statins. The physician should use statins to treat older persons without atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease with a serum LDL cholesterol > or = 160 mg/dL plus one major risk factor, or a serum LDL cholesterol greater than or equal to 130 mg/dL plus a serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol < 50 mg/dL. Gemfibrozil may be useful in reducing the incidence of coronary events in persons with coronary artery disease whose primary lipid abnormality is a low serum HDL cholesterol level. There are no good data supporting treatment of hypertriglyceridemia unassociated with increased LDL cholesterol or decreased HDL cholesterol for prevention of cardiovascular disease.", 
    "86": "There is an obvious need to measure low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in all patients with acute myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease. The recent guidelines of the National Cholesterol Education Program have established the desired level for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol for such patients at <100 mg/dL. However, several studies have demonstrated a lack of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol measurement and lipid-lowering therapy with statins in patients with acute myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease. These findings point to a need for quality of care improvement efforts to foster both lipid measurement and statin use in such patients. Many studies have demonstrated the numerous beneficial effects of statin use. In addition to lipid lowering, these include plaque stability and ant platelet, ant macrophage, and antiatherothrombotic activities as well as enhanced endothelial activity. As a class of drugs, the statins have been shown to offer significant benefits with little in the way of associated risks.", 
    "87": "Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a key molecule in chronic inflammation and has been implicated in the progression of atherosclerosis. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) may reduce the cardiovascular risk and vulnerability of atherosclerotic plaque through nonlipid as well as lipid-lowering mechanisms, but their anti-inflammatory effects on the vascular tissue have not been fully elucidated. We investigated the effects of fluvastatin on IL-6 synthesis in human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). Addition of fluvastatin decreased IL-6 synthesis in VSMCs in a time (0-24 hours)- and dose (10(-8)-10(-5) mol/L)-dependent manner. Fluvastatin also decreased IL-6 mRNA expression in VSMCs. The effects of fluvastatin on IL-6 expression were completely reversed in the presence of mevalonate or geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate, but not squalene. Inhibition of Rho by C3 exoenzyme or Rho kinase by Y-27632 significantly decreased IL-6 expression in VSMCs. In conclusion, fluvastatin decreases IL-6 synthesis in human VSMCs through inhibition of Rho pathway. These findings suggested that reduction of IL-6 expression by statins may partially explain their therapeutic effects in patients with coronary artery disease.",

The risks of the procedure and long-term outcomes are still not fully known. We have performed 54 islet transplantation procedures on 30 subjects and have detailed follow-up in 17 consecutive Edmonton protocol-treated subjects who attained insulin independence after transplantation of adequate numbers of islets. Subjects were assessed pretransplant and followed prospectively posttransplant for immediate and long-term complications related to the procedure or immunosuppressive therapy. The 17 patients all became insulin independent after a minimum of 9,000 islets/kg were transplanted. Of 15 consecutive patients with at least 1 year of follow-up after the initial transplant, 12 (80%) were insulin independent at 1 year. In 14 subjects who have maintained demonstrable C-peptide secretion, glucose control has been stable and glycemic lability and problems with hypoglycemic reactions have been corrected. After 2 of the 54 procedures, some thrombosis was detected in the portal vein circulation. Five subjects had bleeding related to the percutaneous portal vein access procedures: three required transfusion alone, and in one subject, who had a partial thrombosis of the portal vein, an expanding intrahepatic and subscapular hemorrhage occurred while on anticoagulation, requiring transfusion and surgery. Elevated liver function test results were found in 46% of subjects but resolved in all. Complications related to the therapy have been hypercholesterolemia requiring statin therapy in 65%; a rise in creatinine in two patients, both of whom had preexisting renal disease; a rise in protein in four, all of whom had preexisting proteinuria; and antihypertensive therapy increased or started in 53%. Three of the 17 patients have required retinal laser photocoagulation. There have been no cases of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder or cytomegalovirus infection, and no deaths. The acute insulin response to arginine correlated better with transplanted islet mass than acute insulin response to glucose (AIR(g)) and area under the curve for insulin (AUC(i)), but the AIR(g) and AUC(i) were more closely related to glycemic control. The AUC(i) directly posttransplant was lower in those who eventually became C-peptide deficient. Our results, with a maximum follow-up of 34 months, indicate that prolonged insulin independence can be achieved after islet transplantation. There are some risks associated acutely with the procedure, and hypercholesterolemia and hypertension are treatable concerns on longer-term follow-up. All patients with persisting C-peptide secretion have had a resolution of both glycemic lability and problems with hypoglycemic reactions. Apart from the rise in serum creatinine in two subjects, no serious consequences of immunosuppressive therapy have been encountered. Islet transplantation is a reasonable option in those with severe problems with glycemic lability or hypoglycemia.",

Notwithstanding the proven benefits of statin drugs on both primary and secondary prevention of heart disease, the high cost of statin treatment, in addition to possible side effects such as liver function abnormalities, may limit their widespread use. We conducted a study on a natural product as an alternative to statin treatment. Cholestin, a dietary supplement, is prepared from rice fermented with red yeast (Monascus purpureus), which has been shown to significantly decrease total cholesterol levels in hyperlipidemic subjects. Our objective was to determine the cellular effect of Cholestin on cholesterol synthesis in human hepatic cells (HepG2) and the mechanism by which it caused a change in lipid metabolism. Cholestin had a direct inhibitory effect on HMG-CoA reductase activity (78-69% of control). Cholesterol levels in HepG2 cells treated with Cholestin (25-100 microg/mL) were significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner (81-45% of control, respectively). This reduction was associated with decreased synthesis and secretion of both unesterified cholesterol (54-31 and 33-14% of control, respectively) and cholesteryl ester (18-6 and 37-19% of control, respectively). These results indicate that one of the anti-hyperlipidemic actions of Cholestin is a consequence of an inhibitory effect on cholesterol biosynthesis in hepatic cells and provide the first documentation of a biomolecular action of red yeast rice.",

The products of this complex biochemical pathway, including de novo cholesterol, are vital for a variety of key cellular functions affecting membrane integrity, cell signaling, protein synthesis, and cell cycle progression. Lovastatin, a specific inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, induces a pronounced apoptotic response in a specific subset of tumor types, including HNSCC and CC. The mediators of this response are not well established. Identification of differentially expressed genes represents a feasible approach to delineate these mediators as lovastatin has the potential to modulate transcription indirectly by perturbing levels of sterols and other mevalonate metabolites. Expression analysis following treatment of the HNSCC cell lines SCC9 or SCC25 with 10 microM lovastatin for 1 day showed that less than 2% (9 cDNAs) of the 588 cDNAs on this microarray were affected in both cell lines. These included diazepam-binding inhibitor/acyl-CoA-binding protein, the activated transcription factor 4 and rhoA. Because the biosynthesis of mevalonate leads to its incorporation into more than a dozen classes of end products, their role in lovastatin-induced apoptosis was also evaluated. Addition of the metabolites of all the major branches of the mevalonate pathway indicated that only the nonsterol moiety, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), significantly inhibited the apoptotic effects of lovastatin in HNSCC and CC cells. Because rhoA requires GGPP for its function, this links the microarray and biochemical data and identifies rhoA as a potential mediator of the anticancer properties of lovastatin. Our data suggest that the depletion of nonsterol mevalonate metabolites, particularly GGPP, can be potential mediators of lovastatin-induced apoptosis of HNSCC and CC cells.",

    "118": "Simvastatin treatment in 34 male Sprague-Dawley rats accelerated reendothelialization of the balloon-injured arterial segments (reendothelialized area at 2 weeks, 12.3+/-1.8 versus 5.4+/-1.1 mm2, P< 0.01) and resulted in a dose-dependent (0.2 or 1 mg/kg IP) significant reduction in neointimal thickening at 2, 3, and 4 weeks compared with saline-injected controls (n=18). To elucidate the mechanism, we investigated the contribution of bone marrow-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) by bone marrow transplantation from Tie2/lacZ mice to background mice or nude rats. X-gal staining of mouse carotid artery specimens revealed a 2.9-fold increase in the number of beta-gal-positive cells per square millimeter appearing on the carotid artery luminal surface at 2 weeks, and double-fluorescence immunohistochemistry disclosed a significant 5-fold increase in the number of double-positive cells (beta-gal, isolectin B4) on the luminal surface in carotid arteries of statin-treated nude rats (20+/-3 versus 4+/-1 cells/mm surface length, P<0.005). Statins increased circulating rat EPCs (2.4-fold at 2 weeks and 2.5-fold at 4 weeks, P<0.001) and induced adhesiveness of cultured human EPCs by upregulation of the integrin subunits alpha5, beta1, alpha(v), and beta5 of human EPCs as shown by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and fluorescence-activated cell sorting.", 
    "119": "These findings establish additional mechanisms by which statins may specifically preempt disordered vascular wall pathology and constitute physiological evidence that EPC mobilization represents a functionally relevant consequence of statin therapy.", 
    "120": "Although effects of statins on cardiovascular outcomes are well established in men, fewer data exist for women. Furthermore, the effects of statins plus hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on cardiovascular outcomes are uncertain.", 
    "121": "We examined statin use, cardiovascular events, and total mortality in the Heart and Estrogen/progestin Replacement Study (HERS), a randomized clinical trial of estrogen plus progestin versus placebo in postmenopausal women with heart disease (n=2763). A nonrandomized comparison of statin users and nonusers revealed lower rates of the primary outcome, nonfatal myocardial infarction or coronary heart disease death (relative hazard [RH]=0.79, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.63 to 0.99, P=0.04), and total mortality (RH=0.67, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.87, P=0.003). Rates of venous thromboembolic events were also lower among statin users (RH=0.45, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.88, P=0.02). HRT resulted in a significant increase in early risk for primary events in women who did not use statins (RH=1.75, 95% CI 1.02 to 3.03, P=0.04) but not in statin users (RH=1.34, 95% CI 0.63 to 2.86, P=0.45). Adjustment for postrandomization statin use showed no effect of HRT on risk for the primary outcome (RH=0.96, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.29; P=0.72).",

    "123": "The objective of this study was to determine whether improvements in the lipid profile observed in controlled clinical trials with pioglitazone are seen in the clinical practice setting, and to ascertain the influence of concurrent statin treatment. Charts of 100 consecutive patients with type 2 diabetes (mean age 56.8 years) treated with pioglitazone (45 mg/day) for 2-4 months were retrospectively analyzed for changes in serum lipids, glycemic parameters, and body weight. Subanalyses were performed on the relationship of lipid changes to baseline lipid values and to concurrent statin therapy. Pioglitazone was associated with statistically significant (p < 0.001) changes from baseline in HbA(1C) (mean decrease 1.09%), body weight (mean increase 1.76 kg), HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) levels (mean increase 15.6%), and triglycerides (mean decrease 9.9%). There was an increase (+ 1.09%) in mean individual LDL-C levels from baseline values, but this change was not statistically significant. The greatest absolute and percentage improvements in HDL-C and triglycerides were observed in patients who had the greatest lipid abnormalities at baseline: in patients with baseline HDL-C < 35 mg/dL, mean individual HDL-C values increased by 31% (p < 0.001); in those with baseline triglycerides >399 mg/dL, triglyceride levels decreased by 46% (p < 0.001); and in patients with baseline LDL-C > 129 mg/dL, mean individual LDL-C values decreased by 10.6% (p < 0.001). Subgroup analysis showed similar beneficial changes in HDL-C and triglycerides in patients who were not receiving concurrent statin therapy (n = 48) as in those who were receiving statins (n = 49). This observational study demonstrated that significant improvements in HDL-C and triglyceride levels can be achieved with pioglitazone in the clinical practice setting. The greatest improvements occurred in patients with the worst baseline lipid levels, and benefits were seen regardless of whether patients were receiving concurrent statin therapy.",

    "125": "Specimens of radial artery and left internal thoracic artery were obtained during coronary artery bypass grafting. The specimens were divided into vascular rings, which were incubated in the absence or presence of cerivastatin (10(-6) mol/L) for either 2 or 24 hours. Using an organ bath technique, endothelial function was examined using acetylcholine (10(-9) to 10(-5) mol/L) after contraction by 3x10(-8) mol/L of endothelin-1.", 
    "126": "Time-related endothelial dysfunction was shown in the control group of radial artery but not in the cerivastatin group: maximal endothelium-dependent vasodilation in the control and cerivastatin groups were 56.8% +/- 10.2% and 65.9% +/- 10.1% at 2 hours and 39.4% +/- 4.7% and 68.4% +/- 5.0% (p < 0.01, vs control) at 24 hours, respectively. On the other hand, in the left internal thoracic artery, those in the control and cerivastatin groups were 38.3% +/- 8.2% and 45.0% +/- 5.5% at 2 hours and 38.1% +/- 8.2% and 56.5% +/- 8.8% at 24 hours, respectively (NS).", 
    "127": "In radial artery, cerivastatin significantly preserved endothelium-dependent vasodilation, which diminished with time in the control group. This could have very important implications in the clinical practice of coronary artery bypass grafting.", 
    "128": "Most of the currently available statins and fibric acid derivatives have been implicated in causing complications either in monotherapy or in combination therapy. Adverse events occur more often with the statins that are metabolized via the CYP enzyme system and its 3A4, 2C9 or 2C19 paths. All compounds interfering with the same cytochrome system may either impair or enhance the elimination of statins. Other factors predisposing to adverse effects are age, female sex, renal insufficiency, electrolyte disturbances, infections and trauma. Complications chiefly concern the hepatic function, skeletal muscles and peripheral nerves. The major adverse effect is myopathy, up to rhabdomyolysis with ensuing acute renal insufficiency. Fibrates bind to peroxisome proliferator-activated nuclear receptors alpha, with subsequent stimulation of fatty acid oxidation and reduction in the rate of hepatic lipid generation. Fibrates are associated with a number of adverse effects, including liver enzyme elevations, gastrointestinal side effects and rhabdomyolysis. The combination of statins with fibrates may cause serious complications and should be avoided when possible. In order to prevent or minimize adverse clinical outcomes, patients should be closely monitored and informed of the most common symptoms.",

Study participants were 65 years and older and free of cardiovascular disease at baseline. They received drug therapy to lower cholesterol levels at baseline or no treatment with a recommendation for therapy according to the National Cholesterol Education Program guidelines. Use of these drugs was assessed annually. We used proportional-hazards models to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for confounding variables.",

Compared with no use of drugs to lower cholesterol levels, statin use was associated with decreased risk of cardiovascular events (multivariate HR, 0.44; 95% CI, 0.27-0.71) and all-cause mortality (HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.36-0.88). Similar associations were observed among participants 74 years or older at baseline.",

MACE-free survival time was significantly longer in the fluvastatin group (P =.01). One hundred eighty-one (21.4%) of 844 patients in the fluvastatin group and 222 (26.7%) of 833 patients in the placebo group had at least 1 MACE (relative risk [RR], 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64-0.95; P =.01). This result was independent of baseline total cholesterol levels (above [RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.56-1.04] vs below [RR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.57-1.02] the median). In subgroup analysis, the risk of MACE was reduced in patients with diabetes (n = 202; RR, 0.53; 95% CI, 0.29-0.97; P =.04) and in those with multivessel disease (n = 614; RR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.48-0.91; P =.01) who received fluvastatin compared with those who received placebo.

    "141": "The current and future roles of statins as antilipemic agents for the prevention and management of coronary artery disease (CAD) are reviewed. Therapy with hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) substantially reduces total cholesterol and low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations. Large clinical trials have documented the efficacy of statin therapy for both primary and secondary prevention of CAD. Nevertheless, many eligible patients are either untreated or inadequately treated with these agents. In one study, 61% of patients with documented CAD were not treated with a lipid-lowering agent. Large percentages of high-risk patients receiving such agents are not meeting cholesterol goals set by the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP). Populations at increased risk for coronary events include patients with diabetes, women, the elderly, and patients with established CAD. Comparative studies have not shown any one agent as clearly superior to the others. Future possibilities for statin use include early treatment of hypercholesterolemia and acute coronary syndromes consistent with guidelines established by NCEP. Many clinicians now believe that an aggressive approach to lowering LDL cholesterol may yield even greater reductions in coronary events. Treatment may reduce the risk of recurrent ischemic events when initiated within 96 hours of hospitalization for acute myocardial infarction or unstable angina and continued for up to four months. Another use may be the management of atherosclerotic cerebrovascular disease. Closer attention to potential adverse effects will be necessary before any expansion in statin use. Statins are highly effective for improving cardiovascular outcomes in high-risk patients but are frequently underused. Pharmacists can help extend the benefits of statins to more patients.", 
    "142": "Fluvastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, was administered at a dosage of 20 mg/day for 24 weeks to 11 hemodialysis patients with a high plasma total cholesterol (TC) level (> or = 220 mg/dl). Serum lipids, apolipoprotein, and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured every 12 weeks. After 24 weeks of fluvastatin administration, the TC level had decreased by 10.5% (238 +/- 15 mg/dl-->203 +/- 25 mg/dl), the low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level had decreased by 16.2% (142 +/- 32 mg/dl-->119 +/- 26 mg/dl), and the HDL-C level had increased by 23.4% (47 +/- 15 mg/dl-->58 +/- 19 mg/dl). These changes were statistically significant and resulted in a reduction of the atherogenic index (AI: TC-HDL-C/HDL-C). The triglyceride (TG) level did not change significantly. The apolipoprotein A1 level increased by 9.1% (121 +/- 22 mg/dl-->132 +/- 20 mg/dl) and the apolipoprotein B level decreased by 20.2% (114 +/- 25 mg/dl-->91 +/- 20 mg/dl). The MDA level also decreased significantly (1.16 +/- 0.92 nmol/ml-->0.58 +/- 0.38 nmol/ml). No particular side effects were observed during the 24 weeks of fluvastatin administration. In conclusion, fluvastatin may play an important role in preventing significant oxidative stress and was shown to be safe and effective in reducing the TC, LDL-C, MDA and AI levels in dialysis patients with hypercholesterolemia. The possibility that this improvement in the plasma lipid profile of dialysis patients may decrease atherogenic complications requires further investigation, including long-term clinical observations."
