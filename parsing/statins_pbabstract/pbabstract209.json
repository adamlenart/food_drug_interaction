Because statins protect the myocardium against ischemia-reperfusion injury via a mechanism unrelated to cholesterol lowering, we hypothesized that the protective effect of statins was related to the expression of TNF-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) mRNA. Seventy-two rats were randomly divided into three groups as follows: sham, I/R and I/R+atorvastatin. Atorvastatin (20 mg kg(-1)day(-1)) treatment was administered daily via oral gavage to rats for 2, 7 or 14 days. Ischemia was induced via a 30-min coronary occlusion. Reperfusion was allowed until 2, 7 or 14 days while atorvastatin treatment continued. We measured infarct size, hemodynamics and the plasma levels and the mRNA expression of TNF-alpha and IL-10 in the three groups. We demonstrated that the up-regulation of expression of both TNF-alpha mRNA and IL-10 mRNA was associated the increased plasma levels of TNF-alpha and IL-10 in the ischemic and reperfused myocardium compared with that in the sham group (P<0.01). Atorvastatin treatment prevented ischemia-reperfusion-induced up-regulation of both TNF-alpha and IL-10 mRNA, and improved left ventricular function (P<0.01). Our findings suggested that atorvastatin may attenuate MI/R and better recovery of left ventricle function following ischemia and reperfusion and IL-10 was not directly likely involved in this protective mechanism.", 
    "1": "AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) is a heterotrimetric enzyme that is expressed in many tissues, including the heart and vasculature, and plays a central role in the regulation of energy homoeostasis. It is activated in response to stresses that lead to an increase in the cellular AMP/ATP ratio caused either by inhibition of ATP production (i.e. anoxia or ischaemia) or by accelerating ATP consumption (i.e. muscle contraction or fasting). In the heart, AMPK activity increases during ischaemia and functions to sustain ATP, cardiac function and myocardial viability. There is increasing evidence that AMPK is implicated in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases. A principle mode of AMPK activation is phosphorylation by upstream kinases [e.g. LKB1 and CaMK (Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase], which leads to direct effects on tissues and phosphorylation of various downstream kinases [e.g. eEF2 (eukaryotic elongation factor 2) kinase and p70 S6 kinase]. These upstream and downstream kinases of AMPK have fundamental roles in glucose metabolism, fatty acid oxidation, protein synthesis and tumour suppression; consequently, they have been implicated in cardiac ischaemia, arrhythmias and hypertrophy. Recent mechanistic studies have shown that AMPK has an important role in the mechanism of action of MF (metformin), TDZs (thiazolinediones) and statins. Increased understanding of the beneficial effects of AMPK activation provides the rationale for targeting AMPK in the development of new therapeutic strategies for cardiometabolic disease.",

Putative associations were examined by running univariate analyses with a general linear model, using age, sex, smoking and hypertension as covariates. While no statistically significant associations were detected between the CAT -262C>T polymorphism and either baseline values or their modulation by atorvastatin in the patient group, HOMA-IR values were significantly (p=0.028) lower among CAT -262CC controls compared to their T allele carrier counterparts. A trend towards higher plasma triglyceride values among CAT -262CC genotypes was also detected, in both dyslipidaemic patients and normolipidaemic controls.", 
    "3": "Cell based therapy has become a new and attractive option for the treatment of cardiac disease and heart failure. Although it has been demonstrated in vitro and in vivo that differentiation of non-differentiated cells (progenitor cells) into cardiomyocytes is able even in adult hearts the potential use of such transdifferentiation processes is limited by the small number of cells that home and engraft in the myocardium and complete the transdifferentiation process. Therefore, cell recruitment to the damaged heart is a major challenge to improve any cell based therapy. This process requires homing and engraftment of stem or progenitor cells. Major strategies to improve stem or progenitor cell homing are based on an improvement of stem or progenitor cell mobilization from the bone marrow. Strategies that have been shown to be successful are those that use granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF). But although cell mobilization was indeed successful no major impact on hemodynamics was found. Alternatives are therefore needed and experimental studies use parathyroid hormone, statins, erythropoietin, and others in addition to or as an alternative to G-CSF. Although each of these procedures does have an impact on cell mobilization and homing none of these studies has provided a direct evidence that a major improvement on top of standard pharmacological therapy can be expected from such strategies. In conclusion, improvement of stem cell homing is a major challenge in the development of successful cell based therapies but not yet improved to a clinical relevant status. The underlying concepts of different strategies will be discussed here.",

This detection approach was applied in a new HPLC method for the determination of three of the major statins used in clinical treatment-simvastatin, lovastatin and atorvastatin. The method was optimized and the influence of individual parameters on CAD response and sensitivity was carefully studied. Chromatography was performed on a Zorbax Eclipse XDB C18 (4.6 mm x 75 mm, 3.5 microm), using acetonitrile and formic acid 0.1% as mobile phase. The detection was performed using both CAD (20 pA range) and DAD (diode array detector-238 nm) simultaneously connected in series. In terms of linearity, precision and accuracy, the method was validated using tablets containing atorvastatin and simvastatin. The CAD is designated to be a non-linear detector in a wide dynamic range, however, in this application and in the tested concentration range its response was found to be perfectly linear.

By this method, microemulsions containing a volatile solvent as an oil phase are converted into nanoparticles in the form of dry non-oily flakes by freeze-drying. The presence of simvastatin in nanoparticles was determined by dispersing the flakes in water and subsequent filtering through a 0.1-microm filter, followed by measuring the simvastatin concentration in the filtrate. It was found that after freeze-drying more than 95% of the drug was present in amorphous particles, smaller than 100 nm. It was found that tablets containing the flakes of simvastatin nanoparticles showed tremendous enhancement in dissolution profile compared with conventional tablets. X-ray diffraction revealed that in the resulting flakes simvastatin nanoparticles were initially amorphous, but a slow crystallization process took place when the product was stored at room temperature.",

Unmeasured confounders, including high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol or subclinical atherosclerosis, may have influenced prior study outcomes. In older adults participating in a population-based cohort study (n=1711, aged 65 to 97 y), we investigated the relationships of total and HDL cholesterol levels, statin use, and carotid intima-media thickness with the prevalence of cognitive impairment. In adjusted models, participants in the highest quartile of non-HDL (total-HDL) cholesterol had an increased odds of cognitive impairment compared with those in the lowest quartile [odds ratio (OR): 2.06, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.07-3.98]. Statin use was associated with lower odds of cognitive impairment in unadjusted models (OR: 0.57, 95% CI: 0.36-0.89), but this relationship was not significant after adjusting for vascular and lifestyle factors (OR: 0.84, 95% CI: 0.47-1.49). In this analysis of older adults, increased atherogenic lipoproteins were associated with impaired cognition. Statin use was related to many factors that both negatively and positively affect cognition, but was not associated with better cognitive function. These results suggest that confounding by indication may explain the contradictory findings in studies assessing the association of statins with cognition. Randomized-controlled clinical trials and longitudinal studies are necessary to determine if statins protect against cognitive decline.", 
    "25": "All of the binding sequences for MlcR, a transcriptional activator of ML-236B (compactin) biosynthetic genes in Penicillium citrinum, were identified by an in vitro gel-shift assay. All the identified sequences contain an asymmetric direct repeat comprised of conserved tetrad bases (A/T)CGG with a spacer sequence of high similarity; in particular, G at position 2 and T at position 3 in the spacer are well conserved. The first (A/T)CGG repeat was essential for MlcR-binding and MlcR could bind to this monomeric site, probably as a monomer. This binding feature might enable MlcR to tolerate the variation of the spacer length and compositions in vitro. From these data, we propose that the consensus binding motif for MlcR is an asymmetric direct repeat, 5'-(A/T)CGG-NGTN(3-6)-TCGG-3'.",

The aim of the study was to identify genetic polymorphisms of the NPC1L1 gene as well as their functional significance. The method involved screening of promoter and coding regions of the NPC1L1 gene for genetic polymorphisms by direct DNA sequencing of genomic DNA from 50 individuals. Functional studies on promoter polymorphisms were performed using luciferase assay. Association between the polymorphisms and serum cholesterol levels were investigated in 224 individuals. The results showed that in total, 11 single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified. Among them, a promoter polymorphism, g.-762T>C, and a synonymous polymorphism, g.1679C>G, were common (34 and 36%, respectively). These two polymorphisms were highly linked (D' value=0.7459, P-value <0.00001). For the g.-762T>C promoter polymorphism, luciferase assay in HepG2 cell line demonstrated that the -762C allele had a significantly higher promoter activity than the -762T allele (1.30+/-0.22 vs 0.37+/-0.06, 3.5-fold, P<0.05). We also showed that the NPC1L1 promoter activity was downregulated by cholesterol content in both genotypes. When association studies were performed, we found that -762C allele was associated with significantly higher serum total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol content levels in a recessive model (LDL-cholesterol value=131.2+/-8.1 vs 116.4+/-2.2 mg dl(-1); total cholesterol value=214.7+/-9.0 mg dl(-1) vs 196.9+/-2.6, P-value <0.05, n=224).

The SREBP (sterol regulatory element-binding protein) pathway is crucial for the maintenance of cholesterol homoeostasis. This pathway is controlled by cholesterol and cholesterol-derived oxysterols. J774 cells cannot convert desmosterol into cholesterol, a defect resulting from the absence of mRNA for sterol-Delta24-reductase. Using J774 cells, we addressed the capacity of desmosterol to replace cholesterol in sustaining cell proliferation and regulating the SREBP pathway. J774 cells were able to grow indefinitely after the virtually total replacement of cholesterol by desmosterol (J774-D cells). Inhibition of sterol biosynthesis with lovastatin suppressed J774-D cell proliferation. Desmosterol prevented this effect, but its analogue, cholest-5,22-trans-dien-3beta-ol, did not. Addition of desmosterol inhibited processing of SREBP-1 and -2 and also reduced the expression of SREBP-targeted genes. As occurs in cholesterol-containing cells, 25-hydroxycholesterol was more potent than desmosterol or cholesterol in suppressing these processes. Moreover, desmosterol addition enhanced the expression of Abca1 and Srebf1c, two LXR (liver X receptor)-targeted genes. To test the ability of endogenously produced desmosterol to regulate gene expression, J774-D cells were pretreated with lovastatin to inhibit sterol biosynthesis. After removal of the inhibitor the expression of SREBP-targeted genes decreased and that of an LXR-targeted gene increased, reaching control levels. Our results demonstrate that the virtually complete replacement of cholesterol by desmosterol is compatible with cell growth and the functioning of the SREBP pathway. In these cells, desmosterol suppresses SREBP processing and targeted gene expression, and it is especially effective activating LXR-targeted genes.",

Also, we planned to investigate the correlation between inflammatory markers and metabolic parameters. Fifty type 2 diabetic patients (30 women, 20 men; mean age: 49.9 +/- 8.5 years) were enrolled into the study. Twenty healthy subjects, matched on body mass index and age, were also included in the study as a control group. Diabetic patients were divided into two groups and received simvastatin or atorvastatin (Group S and A, respectively).

Coronary artery disease is highly prevalent and is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients. Patients with CAD and prediabetic states should undergo lifestyle modifications aimed at preventing DM. In patients with CAD and DM, routine use of aspirin and an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I)-unless contraindicated or not tolerated-and strict glycemic, blood pressure, and lipid control are strongly recommended. Intense insulin therapy might be needed for glycemic control, and high-dose statin therapy might be needed for lipid control. For blood pressure control, ACE-Is and angiotensin receptor blockers are considered as first-line therapy. The outcomes after revascularization in diabetic patients are usually worse compared with non-diabetic patients. Advances in PCI include the use of drug-eluting stents and adjunctive drug therapies, such as abciximab. Glycemic control is an important determinant of outcome after revascularization in diabetic patients. Improvements in PCI and coronary artery bypass graft surgery are leading to better results in diabetic patients, and clinical trials are presently comparing contemporary PCI with surgery.",

Given the fact that the vascular system is uniform and consubstantial both physiologically, pathophysiologically and in terms of therapy, and that it plays a key role in age-related macular degeneration (AMD)--a disease leading to tragic loss of vision with its etiology and therapy being unknown--endothelial dysfunction should be treated. The pleiotropic effects of ACE-inhibitors, AR-blockers and statins and third generation beta blockers help to restitute the balance between vasodilators and vasoconstrictors in endothelial dysfunction caused by oxidative stress, the balance of growth factors and their inhibitors, pro- and anti-inflammatory substances and prothrombotic and fibrinolytic factors, inhibit the formation of oxidative stress and its harmful effects; while aspirin with its pleiotropic effects acting as an antiaggregation substance on platelets helps to set the endothelial layer back to its normal balance regarding its vasodilating, antithrombotic, antiadhesive and anti-inflammatory functions; trimetazidine as an adjuvant agent helps to normalize, to restore the disturbed metabolism of the retinal tissue functioning insufficiently, in the end. The angiotensin II receptor blocker telmisartan with its peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) agonist effect inhibits the development of choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) and improves it clinically favourably. The third generation beta adrenergic receptor blocker carvedilol and nebivolol as well as the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma agonist pioglitazone elicit their antioxidant vascular protective effects mitochondrially. For the above reasons it is suggested that, as a part of long term primary and/or secondary prevention, the following groups of patients with AMD receive--taking into consideration all possible side effects--ACE-inhibitor and/or AR blocker and statin and aspirin treatment, and trimetazidine as adjuvant medicine, and third generation beta adrenergic receptor blockers: 1. those without macular degeneration but being above the age of 50 and having risk factors inducing endothelial dysfunction; 2. those, who already developed AMD in one eye as a prevention in the second, unaffected eye; and 3. those patients who developed AMD in both eyes in order to ameliorate or merely slow the progression of the disease. Besides, it is advisory and important to eliminate AMD risk factors (cardiovascular risk factors also) inducing oxidative stress with consecutive endothelial dysfunction.",

Management of HIV-positive patients is likely to become more complex as people age, developing multiple medical conditions and thus requiring polypharmacy. We undertook a casenote review and interview of patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) to audit the safety of devolving statin prescribing to general practitioners (GPs). Of 26 patients only 50% had their statin prescribing successfully been devolved to GPs. Many experienced significant difficulties and two of 26 (8%) were switched to simvastatin while receiving a protease inhibitor. We demonstrate that prescribing ART and non-ART medication by different practitioners on different sites can potentially expose patients to serious life-threatening adverse events.

    "92": "Simvastatin inhibits 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, which catalyses conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, a rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis. We demonstrated that simvastatin at 1 microM markedly inhibited adipocyte differentiation measured by Oil Red O staining in preadipocyte cells (3T3-L1), while expression of leptin, a marker of adipocyte differentiation, was suppressed by 1 muM simvastatin for up to 12 days of culture. Next, to elucidate mechanisms underlying the reduction of leptin expression induced by simvastatin, differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes were treated with various inhibitors with mevalonate or its metabolite in the presence or absence of simvastatin. Simvastatin time- and dose-dependently suppressed leptin mRNA expression. Heterogeneous nuclear RNA related to leptin mRNA was inhibited by 10 muM simvastatin, while stability of the mRNA was not changed by treatment with simvastatin in transcription-arrested 3T3-L1 cells. Simvastatin inhibition of leptin gene transcription was not abrogated by pre-treatment with cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis. Addition of mevalonate or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), a mevalonate metabolite, abolished simvastatin-induced inhibition of leptin expression in 3T3-L1 cells. Suppression of expression was observed upon addition of GGTI-298, a geranylgeranyl transferase I inhibitor, but not FTI-277, a farnesyl transferase inhibitor. Expression was suppressed by treatment with hydroxyfasudil, a protein prenylation inhibitor. Treatment with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors, LY294002 and wortmannin, reduced leptin expression in 3T3-L1 cells. Simvastatin dose-dependently increased intra-cellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) concentrations in 3T3-L1 cells, with maximal stimulation obtained at 10 muM. Addition of GGPP abolished simvastatin-induced stimulation of cAMP accumulation and protein kinase A (PKA) activity. H89, an inhibitor of PKA, completely abolished simvastatin-induced suppression of leptin expression. These results suggested that simvastatin reduced geranylgeranylprotein prenylation followed by deactivation of PI3K, leading to cAMP accumulation and subsequent activation of PKA in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Finally, PKA inhibited leptin gene transcription without new protein synthesis.", 
    "93": "After sudden cardiac arrest, successful resuscitation and return of spontaneous circulation, a multi-faceted ischaemia/reperfusion related disorder develops. This condition now known as post resuscitation syndrome is characterised by marked increases in the inflammatory response and changes in coagulation profile and vascular reactivity. Additionally, the production of reactive oxygen species and activation of cytotoxic cascades of metabolism add to these injury mechanisms resulting in multiorgan perfusion deficits and dysfunction. Especially in the cerebrum these injuries may be the cause of significant morbidity and mortality. Recent evidence has shown that statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) exert numerous beneficial effects in cardiovascular diseases irrespective of the lipid status. Remarkably, these pleiotropic effects seem to extended beyond cardiovascular diseases such as immunomodulative and antioxidative properties. We hypothesised that administration of statins early in the post resuscitation phase would prove beneficial in the resuscitated patient via several pleiotropic effects. These include inhibition of excessive coagulation and inflammatory response, suppression of oxygen radical production and improved vascular reactivity. The discussed effects are mediated via multiple pathways activated in the cardiac arrest victim, to which statins have been shown to have a beneficial modulating effect in experimental settings and non-cardiac arrest patients. To test this hypothesis in clinical practice, a randomized, controlled trial with sufficient power and standardised post resuscitation treatment would be necessary. The generally good tolerance of statin therapy with minimal adverse effects would support this experiment, although a parenteral form of the drug to ensure adequate dosage might be a prerequisite.",

Recent emerging evidence suggests that statins protect cardiovascular function via lipid-independent mechanisms. However, the potential role of statins in diabetic retinopathy in type 2 diabetes is largely unclear. In the present study we have investigated the effect of lovastatin on blood-retinal barrier and inflammatory status in the retina of db/db mice and in cultured retinal cells. Male C57BL/KsJ db/db mice were randomly chosen to receive gastric gavage of lovastatin (10mg/kg/day) or vehicle control for 6 weeks. Retinal vascular permeability, the tight junction and inflammation were determined. The results showed that db/db mice at the age of 19 weeks exhibited significantly increased retinal vascular leakage and decreased tight junction protein level in the retina. Moreover, the expression of pro-inflammatory factors, e.g. ICAM-1 and TNF-alpha, was drastically up-regulated in diabetic retina. Lovastatin treatment normalized all of these changes. In cultured bovine retinal capillary endothelial cells (RCECs) and human ARPE-19 cells, lovastatin attenuated the decrease of tight junction protein (occludin) and adherens junction protein (VE-cadherin) expression-induced by TNF-alpha, a major pro-inflammatory cytokine in diabetic retinopathy. Lovastatin also attenuated TNF-alpha expression in RCEC. Towards the mechanism, we showed that lovastatin ameliorated ICAM-1 expression-induced by hypoxia and TNF-alpha in both RCECs and ARPE-19 cells, in part through inhibition of NF-kappaB activation. Taken together, these findings indicate that lovastatin protects blood-retinal barrier in diabetic retinopathy, which is likely via its anti-inflammatory effects.",

We investigated the effects of statins on WML progression by performing a post hoc analysis on the ROCAS (Regression of Cerebral Artery Stenosis) study, which is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluating the effects of statins upon asymptomatic middle cerebral artery stenosis progression among stroke-free individuals. Two hundreds and eight randomized subjects were assigned to either placebo (n = 102) or simvastatin 20 mg daily (n = 106) for 2 years. Baseline severity of WML was graded visually into none, mild, and severe. Volume (cm3) of WML was determined quantitatively at baseline and at end of study using a semi-automated method based on MRI. Primary outcome was the change in WML volume over 2 years. After 2 years of follow-up, there was no significant change in WML volume between the active and the placebo group as a whole. However, stratified analysis showed that for those with severe WML at baseline, the median volume increase in the active group (1.9 cm3) was less compared with that in the placebo group (3.0 cm3; P = 0.047). Linear multivariate regression analysis identified that baseline WML volume (beta = 0.63, P < 0.001) and simvastatin treatment (beta = -0.214, P = 0.043) independently predicted change in WML volume. Our findings suggest that statins may delay the progression of cerebral WML only among those who already have severe WML at baseline.",

Sex differences in the prognostic value of the lipid profile have not yet been studied. We have evaluated the impact of TC, high- and low-density lipoprotein (HDL and LDL, respectively), and triglyceride (TG) levels on the 3-month outcome after a first ischemic stroke (IS) according to sex and previous statin use. The study group consisted of a hospital-based cohort of consecutive patients with a diagnosis of first IS. Poor outcome was defined as a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score >or=3 at 90 days. The odds ration (OR) for poor prognosis was analyzed for each sex using logistic regression models adjusted for vascular risk factors and statin pretreatment. A total of 591 patients were included in the analysis (318 men). The predictors of a 90-day poor outcome were age and initial NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score in women, and age, initial NIHSS, smoking, atrial fibrillation, and thrombolytic treatment in men. In women, none of the lipids studied affected the 90-day prognosis. Men falling in the last quintile of TC [OR: 0.68 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.52-0.88; p = 0.004] and LDL (OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.56-0.98; p = 0.04) have better outcome than men in the first quintile. Adjusting for statin pretreatment did not change the results. The results indicated that an association between poststroke lipids and prognosis may vary by sex. In women, lipids were not associated with the outcome; in men, lower TC and LDL were associated with worse prognosis. These differences can not be explained by statin use and require further research.", 
    "125": "Transporters govern drug movement into and out of tissues, thereby playing an important role in drug disposition in plasma and to the site of action. The molecular cloning of such transporters has clarified the importance of members of the solute carrier family, such as OATP/SLCO, OCT/SLC22, OAT/SLC22, and MATE/SLC47, and the ATP-binding cassette transporters, such as P-glycoprotein/ABCB1, MRPs/ABCC, and BCRP/ABCG2. Elucidation of molecular characteristics of transporters has allowed the identification of transporters as mechanisms for drug-drug interactions, and of interindividual differences in drug dispositions and responses. Cumulative studies have highlighted the cooperative roles of uptake transporters and metabolic enzymes/efflux transporters. In this way, the concept of a rate-limiting process in hepatic/renal elimination across epithelial cells has developed. This review illustrates the concept of the rate-limiting step in the hepatic elimination mediated by transporters, and describes the prediction of the in vivo pharmacokinetics of drugs whose disposition is determined by transporters, based on in vitro experiments using pravastatin as an example. This review also illustrates the transporters regulating the peripheral drug concentrations.", 
    "126": "Cell therapy with endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) is an emerging therapeutic option to promote angiogenesis or endothelial repair. Although the release of angiogenic paracrine factors is known to contribute to their therapeutic effect, little is known about their release of proinflammatory factors and expression of proinflammatory adhesion molecules. \"Early\" EPCs and \"late\" EPCs were isolated from human peripheral blood and their release of chemokines and thromboinflammatory mediators as well as their expression of the proinflammatory adhesion molecules was assessed at baseline and with stimulation. The effect of simvastatin on monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) secretion by late EPCs from patients with vascular disease was also evaluated. All groups of EPCs released chemokines and thromboinflammatory mediators. Early EPCs primarily released thromboinflammatory mediators such as tissue factor (0.5 +/- 0.1 ng/million cells, P < 0.05), whereas adult late EPCs primarily released chemokines such as MCP-1 (287 +/- 98 ng/million cells, P < 0.05). Stimulation with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha augmented the expression of proinflammatory adhesion molecules and paracrine factors by all EPC subtypes. The release of MCP-1 by late EPCs was markedly reduced by simvastatin treatment of the cells. All EPC subtypes expressed proinflammatory paracrine factors and adhesion molecules involved in atherosclerosis. Future clinical studies should therefore not only assess the efficacy of EPCs but also monitor inflammatory activation following EPC transplantation in patients. Pharmacological modulation of EPCs before and after transplantation may represent a novel approach to improve their safety.",

A link between osteoporosis and atherosclerosis was proposed by epidemiologic and laboratory data. In the present study, we investigated skeletal status in postmenopausal women with hypercholesterolemia using quantitative ultrasonometry (QUS). Six hundred healthy postmenopausal subjects were enrolled within a 2-mo period by primary care physicians. Information on lifestyle and calcium intake was collected for each enrolled subject. Subjects (n = 256) were divided into two groups according to lipid profile: normal (n = 180) with serum cholesterol <200 mg/dL and hypercholesterolemic (n = 76) with serum cholesterol >or=200 mg/dL. Hypercholesterolemic subjects were further stratified into two groups, one receiving dietary treatment (n = 34) and the other receiving statin treatment (n = 42). We found a statistically significant reduction in amplitude dependent speed of sound (AD-SoS) in hypercholesterolemic subjects compared with subjects with normal cholesterol (p = 0.006). Calcium intake behaved similarly to AD-SoS (p = 0.0001). No statistical significant difference in AD-SoS were observed between the group on diet treatment versus the group on statin (p = 0.52). Calcium intake was lower in patients on statins treatment compared with subjects on diet treatment only (p < 0.0001). Our data suggest that hypercholesterolemia per se is a risk factor for impaired skeletal status. Our data also call attention to the risk of a poor calcium intake in patient receiving diet to lower plasma cholesterol. Moreover, our data suggest that statins per se may exert a protective effect on bone independently from calcium intake.",

On admission, her drug therapy included lovastatin 40 mg/day, controlled-release diltiazem 240 mg/day, and glimepiride 1 mg/day. Nineteen days earlier, sitagliptin 100 mg/day had been started; it was discontinued 2 weeks later, and glimepiride was begun. A cardiology consultation performed on the day of admission determined that a markedly elevated creatine kinase-myocardial band isoenzyme level and borderline-high troponin I level were diagnostic of rhabdomyolysis secondary to statin use. Because the patient had been taking lovastatin for the past 12 years, the possibility that the rhabdomyolysis may have been caused by a drug interaction between lovastatin and a concomitant drug was evaluated. As it had been 10 months since her last dosage adjustment of diltiazem, it was unlikely that the statin-induced rhabdomyolysis was precipitated by diltiazem. Use of the Drug Interaction Probability Scale to determine the strength of a lovastatin-sitagliptin interaction indicated a possible association (score of 4). Multiple drug interactions have been reported with lovastatin. To our knowledge, however, this is the first case report of a possible sitagliptin-lovastatin interaction that may have caused rhabdomyolysis. Studies must be performed to further evaluate the in vivo effect of sitagliptin on the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system and to elucidate other mechanisms that may potentiate such a drug-drug interaction. In the meantime, however, clinicians should be aware of this possible drug interaction.",

This study used a cell proliferation assay, cell cycle analysis, quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and in vivo transplantation to examine the effects of simvastatin on human dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) in vitro and in vivo. Simvastatin at 1 mumol/L was able to significantly suppress the proliferation of DPSCs without inducing apoptosis. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed both osteocalcin and dentin sialophosphoprotein to be significantly up-regulated when DPSCs were cultured with simvastatin in comparison to bone morphogenetic protein-2 treatment. The in vivo transplantation data showed that simvastatin treatment promoted mineralized tissue formation. Taken together, these results suggest that statin might be an ideal active ingredient to accelerate the differentiation of DPSCs.",

We therefore tested the efficiency of statin treatment in 209 patients with coronary heart disease and allocated them according to the time of the last CA in 2 groups (<or= />12 months). Median low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) of the study population was 117 mg/dL. Whereas 81% of the patients with CA <or= 12 months received statins, application rate dropped to 67% in patients with angiograms >12 months (P<0.05). Comparison of the median ratio of the applied statin dose to its equivalent dose demonstrated a higher therapy intensity in patients with recent CA (1.0 vs. 0.5; P < 0.05). Therefore, patients with CA <or= 12 months had lower median LDL-C levels (102 vs. 121 mg/dL; P<0.001) and were more likely to have LDL-C levels <100 mg/dL (40% vs. 19%; P<0.01).

Herein, the authors review data from human and animal models of renal disease as well as from studies in cultured renal cells with regard to extralipid renoprotective properties of statins. Statins may exert lipid-independent benefits against renal injury in experimental states of chronic or acute renal function impairment. These include diabetic and hypertensive glomerulosclerosis, autoimmune glomerulonephritis, ischemia/reperfusion-induced renal damage, and unilateral ureteral obstructive nephropathy. Also, statins, by reducing the synthesis of mevalonate products, inhibit the activation of Rho and Ras guanosine triphosphatases that may influence various signaling pathways involving renal inflammatory, fibrogenic, proliferative, and cell-death responses. Therefore, statins exert anti-inflammatory actions in renal tissue, prevent renal scarring, and diminish mesangial or other kidney cell-type proliferation while promoting mesangial cell apoptosis. Renal antioxidant effects with consequent endothelial function regulation of renal vasculature following statin treatment may also account for pleiotropic protection against renal injury.",

Data were collected from the electronic medical records of patients with stable angina pectoris who underwent PCI guided by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). Patients were stratified into 2 groups: those who received long-term statin treatment for > or =6 months before PCI (statin group) and those who did not (nonstatin group). The tissue characteristics of the coronary plaque at each target stenotic site were analyzed using 3-dimensional integrated backscatter IVUS immediately before PCI.",

The clinical characteristics of the 2 groups were not significantly different, with the exception of the prevalence of hyperlipidemia (statin vs nonstatin, 100% vs 51.8%; P < 0.001). There were no significant between-group differences in serum lipid profiles. The statin group had a significantly greater mean (SD) percentage decrease in lipid volume (28.7% [10.0%] vs 34.7% [9.8%]; P = 0.003) and a significantly greater increase in fibrous volume (66.5% [8.5%] vs 60.9% [8.6%]; P = 0.001) compared with the nonstatin group.",

After 2 years of treatment, regression of thoracic plaques was found in the 20-mg group (-15% vessel wall area reduction), but not in the 5-mg group (+7%). Although the 20-mg dose induced plaque regression (-14%) from baseline to 1 year, no further regression was seen from 1 to 2 years of treatment (-1%). Regarding abdominal plaques, progression was found in the 5-mg group (+10%), but not in the 20-mg group (+2%). Plaque progression in the 5-mg group was found from baseline to 1 year (+8%), but not from 1 to 2 years (+2%). The degree of thoracic plaque regression correlated with LDL-cholesterol reduction (r = 0.61), whereas thoracic plaque change from 1 to 2 years correlated with on-treatment LDL-cholesterol levels (r = 0.64).",

The patients were randomized into two groups (1:1): one treated with fluvastatin (80 mg/day, fluvastatin group, n = 23), and the other one treated with placebo (placebo group, n = 23) for three weeks before surgery. All patients underwent CABG using CPB. Blood samples were collected at baseline (the day before surgery), before and after aortic cross-clamping (ACC), at postoperative 0 h (the end of surgical intervention), and at 4, 12, and 24 hours postoperatively. Concentrations of soluble P-selectin (sP-selectin) were analyzed.",

These patients were already on atorvastatin therapy targeted to lower low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), for a minimum period of 6 months. Group 1, n = 104 (mean age 52.7 years) received ER niacin in addition to atorvastatin and group 2 (n = 106) continued on atorvastatin (mean age 52.3 years). ER niacin dose was built up to a maximum of 1.5 g and atorvastatin dose titrated according to LDL levels in both the groups. The lipoprotein levels at baseline were similar (p = NS).", 
    "181": "At 9 +/- 1.8 months of follow-up, the mean dose of ER niacin was 1.3 g and atorvastatin 13.2 mg in group 1. In comparison, group 2 patients had mean atorvastatin dose of 15.9 mg. Patients in group 1 had significant elevation in HDL-C cholesterol (39.5 +/- 5.5 vs 35.7 +/- 4.5 mg/dL), reduction in total cholesterol (156.4 +/- 31 vs 164.5 +/- 39.3 mg/dL) and also LDL-C (88.9 +/- 28.3 vs 99.8 +/- 35.4 mg/dL) compared to group 2 (all p < 0.05). The magnitude of reduction in triglyceride levels was not significant between the groups (140.1 +/- 40.4 vs 145.2 +/- 46.5 mg/dL) (p = NS). No major adverse events or clinical myopathy occurred in either groups. Four patients (4%) discontinued ER niacin (2 due to gastro-intestinal symptoms and 2 due to worsening of diabetes). Flushing occurred in 3% patients, but none felt it to be troublesome.",

    "183": "There is emerging evidence that, beyond their cholesterol-lowering properties, statins exhibit important antileukemic effects in vitro and in vivo, but the precise mechanisms by which they generate such responses remain to be determined. We have previously shown that statins promote differentiation of acute promyelocytic leukemia cells and enhance generation of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA)-dependent antileukemic responses. We now provide evidence that statin-dependent leukemic cell differentiation requires engagement and activation of the c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase kinase pathway. In addition, in experiments, to define the molecular targets and mediators of statin-induced differentiation, we found a remarkable effect of statins on ATRA-dependent gene transcription, evidenced by the selective induction of over 400 genes by the combination of atorvastatin and ATRA. Altogether, our studies identify novel statin molecular targets linked to differentiation, establish that statins modulate ATRA-dependent transcription, and suggest that combined use of statins with retinoids may provide a novel approach to enhance antileukemic responses in acute promyelocytic leukemia and possibly other leukemias.", 
    "184": "In a randomized crossover study, 24 SLCO181-genotyped healthy volunteers were given daily doses of 1,200 mg gemfibrozil, 40 mg atorvastatin, or placebo, followed by 0.25 mg of repaglinide on day 3. The mean increase in the repaglinide area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 h to infinity (AUC(0-infinity)) produced by gemfibrozil was larger in individuals with the SLCO1B1 c.521CC genotype (n = 6) than in those with the c.521TC (n = 6) and c.521TT (n = 12) genotypes, by factors of 1.56 (P = 0.004) and 1.54 (P = 0.002), respectively. Gemfibrozil prolonged the repaglinide elimination half-life 1.43 times more in the c.521 CC group than in the c.521TT group (P = 0.047), but no differences were seen in the effects on peak plasma concentration (C(max)). While on gemfibrozil, the minimum blood glucose concentration after repaglinide intake was 19% lower in the c.521CC participants than in the c.521TT participants (P = 0.009). In the c.521TT group, atorvastatin intake had the effect of increasing repaglinide Cmax and AUC(0-infinity) by41% (P = 0.001) and 18% (P = 0.033), respectively. In conclusion, the extent of gemfibrozil-repaglinide interaction depends on SLCO1B1 genotype. Atorvastatin raises plasma repaglinide concentrations, probably by inhibiting organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1).",

The simvastatin acid AUC(0-12h) was 60% larger, the atorvastatin AUC(0-infinity) 55% larger, and the atorvastatin half-life 24% longer in subjects with the ABCB1 TTT/TTT genotype (n = 12) than in those with the CGC/CGC genotype (n = 12) (P < 0.05), but there were no differences between the two genotypes with respect to the pharmacokinetics of the lactones of these drugs.", 
    "186": "Children with hyperlipidemia secondary to renal disease develop premature atherosclerosis and glomerulosclerosis. The aims of this pilot study were to find the dosage and short-term efficacy of simvastatin and potential adverse events in children with chronic kidney diseases. This was a random, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over clinical trial performed on children with hyperlipidemia secondary to kidney disorders. After being placed on a diet for 3 months, patients were randomly placed in one of two balanced group blocks and treated with diet plus placebo or simvastatin at doses of 5 mg for children weighing 30 kg or less and 10 mg for children weighing over 30 kg, for 1 month, and then doubled for two more months. After this treatment, patients were placed on a diet for a 3-month washout period. During the last trial phase, patients previously treated with simvastatin were administered a placebo, and vice versa. A total of 25 patients with ages ranging from 4 years to 17 years were included in the study. A significant decrease in the levels of serum cholesterol (26.4%), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (35.4%) and triglycerides (23.1%) was noted during the study, primarily during the simvastatin treatments, in which case cholesterol, LDL and triglycerides decreased by 23.3%, 33.7% and 21%, respectively. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels increased moderately (10.7%) during the study but without differences during simvastatin treatment. No differences were found across groups with respect to adverse events. In the short-term the combination of diet and simvastatin was effective in lowering hyperlipidemia in children with renal disorders.", 
    "187": "In the present study, we analyzed the function of a novel mutation (c.1628T>G, p.Leu543Trp) in the solute carrier organic anion transporter (SLCO) 1B1 gene, encoding organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1, which was identified in a patient with pravastatin-induced myopathy. OATP1B1 variants carrying the mutation (OATP1B1*1a+c.1628T>G or *1b+c.1628T>G) showed a reduced transporting activity toward typical substrates and pravastatin compared with the activity of the references (OATP1B1*1a or *1b). This was due to reduction in V(max) values of the variants, not due to change in their K(m) values. OATP1B1*1b+c.1628T>G was normally expressed on the plasma membrane of HEK293 cells at the same level as that of OATP1B1*1b. Taken together, our results suggest that the mutation c.1628T>G (p.Leu543Trp) reduced the function of OATP1B1 probably due to decrease in turnover rate of one OATP1B1 molecule rather than impairment of protein sorting to the plasma membrane.",

    "193": "The prevalence of any type of PAD was 18.0% (range 16-20), of asymptomatic peripheral arterial disease (APAD) was 11.1% (range 9-13), intermittent claudication was 6.8% (range 6.5-7.1), and of critical limb ischemia (CLI) was 1.2% (range 1.0-1.5). APAD and CLI were more common in women. Statins were used by 17.5% (range 16.9-18.2), 29.4% (range 29.0-30.1), and 30.3% (range 29.9-30.8) of the patients with APAD, intermittent claudication, and CLI, respectively, and antiplatelet therapy was reported by 34.1% (range 33.7-34.3), 47.6% (range 47.3-47.9), and 60.2% (range 59.1-60.7). The odds ratio for having APAD was 1.7 (range 1.2-2.4) for women with a smoking history of 10 years in relation to nonsmokers. This association was observed only in men who had smoked for at least 30 years or more. Preventive drug use was more common in men with PAD. Compared with women they had an odds ratio of 1.3 (range 1.1-1.5) for lipid-lowering therapy, 1.3 (range 1.0-1.7) for [beta]-blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and 1.5 (range 1.2-1.9) for antiplatelet therapy.", 
    "194": "The patients' risk factor profiles differed among the PAD stages. Smoking duration already seemed to be a risk factor for women with PAD after 10 years of smoking, as compared with 30 years for men, and fewer women reported use of preventive medication. These observations may partly explain the sex differences in prevalence that were observed."
