We reported that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF\u03b1) enhanced the expression of group V PLA2 (sPLA2-V) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and the LPC content in LDL and the monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) expression were augmented when TNF\u03b1-stimulated HUVECs were incubated with LDL. Here, we observed that an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, pitavastatin, at the concentration of >1 \u03bcM administered 12 hours before TNF\u03b1 stimulation suppressed the enhancement of sPLA2-V mRNA and protein. Pitavastatin also prevented the enhancement of the LPC content in LDL and the expression of MCP-1 mRNA when TNF\u03b1-stimulated HUVECs were incubated with LDL. The administration of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate restored the expression of sPLA2-V mRNA and protein. The administration of the Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 and the transfection of small interfering RNA (siRNA) against sPLA2-V before TNF\u03b1 stimulation both diminished the TNF\u03b1-induced sPLA2-V mRNA expression. Therefore, Y-27632 and siRNA against sPLA2-V also prevented the enhancement of MCP-1 mRNA expression when TNF\u03b1-stimulated HUVECs were incubated with LDL. Pitavastatin's inhibitory effect on the expression of sPLA2-V induced by TNF\u03b1 may be useful to prevent the proatherogenic modification of LDL.",

    "15": "New drug formulations are sought for poorly water-soluble substances because there is a risk of compromised bioavailability if such substances are administered orally. Such active pharmaceutical ingredients can be reformulated as solid dispersions with suitable water-soluble polymers. In this contribution, formulation of a novel and physically stable dispersion of Simvastatin in poly(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide (pHPMA) is demonstrated. Due to the limited water sorption of pHPMA and a high Tg, the prepared dispersion is more suited for oral administration and storage compared with neat amorphous Simvastatin. Surprisingly, the rate of global reorientation and the internal motion of Simvastatin molecules were enhanced and exhibited dynamical heterogeneities when incorporated into the pHPMA matrix. As revealed by solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance combined with Raman spectroscopy exploiting the fluorescence phenomenon the mobility of the ester and lactone components increased considerably, whereas the naphthalene ring remained rigid. Furthermore, the solid dispersion was found to be nano-heterogeneous with nanometer-sized Simvastatin domains. The presence of these clusters had no impact on the dynamics of the rigid pHPMA chains. Thus, the diffusion of Simvastatin molecules through the glassy pHPMA walls and the subsequent transformation of the clusters into larger crystallites were prevented. No crystallization was detected for more than two years.",

However, there are no studies of statin efficacy among T1DM patients. T1DM patients have higher gut cholesterol absorption than synthesis; hence cholesterol absorption inhibitors such as ezetimibe may also be effective in T1DM.

However, for sportspeople the epidemiological data linking weight or adiposity on one hand, and risk of tendon pathology on the other, are less consistent. Indeed, the mechanistic links between diet, adiposity and tendon pathology remain largely unexamined. Recent studies have begun to examine the effects of dietary interventions on outcomes such as tendon biomechanics or pain. Oxidised low-density lipoprotein has been shown to (A) accumulate in the tendon tissues of mice that eat a fatty diet and (B) induce a pathological phenotype in human tendon cells. This paper addresses the current debate: is excessive body mass index (causing increased load and strain on tendon tissue) per se the underlying mechanism? Or do local or systemic influences of fat on tendons predispose to tendon pathology? This narrative review argues that excessive blood lipids may be an important avenue for clinical investigations.",

Calcium chloride act as a cross linking agent, when react with sodium alginate form a calcium alginate, since develope a gel like microbeads (microspheres). The half life of simvastatin is 2h for simvastatin acid. Simvastatin microspheres were prepared by using sodium alginate in combination with Abelmoschus esculentus (Okra), as drug release modifiers in various proportions to overcome the drug related adverse effects. The drug entrapment efficiency increased progressively with increasing concentration of both sodium alginate and okra mucilage resulting in the formation of larger microspheres entrapping greater amounts of the drug. The prepared microspheres were subjected to various evaluation and in vitro release studies. The particle sizes of the prepared microspheres were determined by optical microscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) analysis. The prepared microspheres had good spherical geometry with smooth surface as evidence by SEM.

    "22": "Cataract is the leading cause of visual impairment, other than uncorrected refractive errors, and the number one cause of preventable blindness worldwide. Common adverse events of statins include statin-related muscle toxicity, elevation of transaminases, diabetes, and possible association with cancer. Publications on the relationship of cataract to statins have reported inconsistent findings. A meta-analysis indicated a 19\u00a0% decrease in cataract among statin users. The pleiotropic effects of statins including effects on inflammation and oxidation may mediate a decrease in the rate of cataract formation. On the other hand, bidirectional effects of statins on oxidation and inhibition of appropriate lens epithelial cell development may promote cataractogenesis. Younger age and longer duration of statin therapy was associated with greater benefit while a benefit was not observed among older persons. A definitive way to settle the issue of the relationship of statins to cataract is to perform a randomized clinical trial or include cataract as an end point in epidemiologic studies. An increased risk of cataract may be balanced by the marked benefits of statins for those at high risk for cardiovascular events, while a decreased risk may help increase adherence to statin therapy.",

Micellar extraction (ME) combined with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC-UV) has been successfully applied for this purpose. It was found that the analyte created micelle with anionic sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) and/or with the binary mixture of surfactants nonionic triton X114 (TX114) and cationic tetra-n-butyloammonium bromide (TBAB). The optimal analytical conditions for the proposed extraction procedures (solution pH, concentration of surfactants, centrifugation time and electrolyte type) were ascertained. The calibration curves were recorded. The linearity ranges for FLU, isolated by SDS and the mixture of TX114/TBAB, were 0.21-28.79 \u03bcg mL(-1) and 0.21-16.45 \u03bcg mL(-1) with limit of detection (LOD) 0.19 \u03bcg mL(-1) and 0.14 \u03bcg mL(-1), respectively.

However, its low water solubility and the toxicity associated with administration of high doses recommend it for encapsulation in carriers able to deliver the therapeutic dose in the tumor. In this work, liposomes with long-circulating properties were proposed as delivery systems for SIM. The objective of this study was to optimize the formulation of SIM-loaded long-circulating liposomes (LCL-SIM) by using D-optimal experimental design. The influence of phospholipids concentration, phospholipids to cholesterol molar ratio and SIM concentration was studied on SIM liposomal concentration, encapsulation efficiency and liposomal size. The optimized formulation had liposomal SIM concentration 6238 \u00b5g/ml, EE % of 83.4% and vesicle size of 190.5 nm. Additionally we evaluated the in vitro cytotoxicity of the optimized liposomal SIM (LCL-SIM-OPT) on C26 murine colon carcinoma cells cultivated in monoculture as well as in co-culture with murine peritoneal macrophages at a cell density ratio that provides an approximation of physiological conditions of colon carcinoma development in vivo. Our preliminary studies suggested that LCL-SIM-OPT exerted cytotoxicity on C26 cells probably via enhancement of oxidative stress in co-culture environment.",

    "33": "The role of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis is well recognized, and the use of LDL-C lowering medications has led to a significant reduction of cardiovascular risk in both primary and secondary prevention. Statins are the standard of care and their use is supported by extensive evidence demonstrating their effectiveness in lowering LDL-C and in reducing the risk for cardiovascular disease. However, many individuals at risk for cardiovascular disease fail to achieve LDL-C goals. In addition, several patients are intolerant to statins due to side effects, mostly myalgia and weakness, especially at high statin doses. However, until recently, the efficacy of other non-statin LDL-C-lowering drugs was modest, not exceeding a LDL-C reduction of 20%. In view of the above, extensive research is being carried out to identify new LDL-C-lowering agents with an acceptable side effect profile, which, used alone or in combination with statins, would improve our ability to achieve LDL-C goals and reduce cardiovascular risk. This review aims to provide the current evidence regarding the newly approved LDL-C-lowering agents, as well as the clinical and scientific data pertaining to promising new and emerging LDL-C-lowering drugs on the horizon.",

We previously found that Mig-6 plays a critical role in the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis and in bile acid synthesis. In this study, we investigated the effects of EGFR inhibition to identify a potential new treatment target for hypercholesterolemia. We used a mouse model with conditional ablation of the Mig-6 gene in the liver (Albcre/+Mig-6f/f; Mig-6d/d) to effectively investigate the role of Mig-6 in the regulation of liver function. Mig-6d/d mice were treated with either the EGFR inhibitor gefitinib or statin for 6 weeks after administration of a high-fat or standard diet. We then compared lipid profiles and other parameters among each group of mice. After a high-fat diet, Mig-6d/d mice showed elevated serum levels of total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides and glucose, characteristics resembling hypercholesterolemia in diabetic patients. We observed decreases in serum levels of lipids and glucose in high-fat-diet-fed Mig-6d/d mice after 6 weeks of treatment with gefitinib or statin. Furthermore gefitinib-treated mice showed significantly greater decreases in serum levels of total, HDL and LDL cholesterol compared with statin-treated mice. Taken together, these results suggest that EGFR inhibition is effective for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia in high-fat-diet-fed Mig-6d/d mice, and our findings provide new insights into the development of possible treatment targets for hypercholesterolemia via modulation of EGFR inhibition.",

The proportion of patients with at least 1 SIRS criterion, mean CRP, and mean WBC all decreased over time. Multivariable regression models identified days since hospital admission as the only variable associated with daily presence of SIRS criteria, WCC, or CRP (adjusted OR <1 and p < 0.0001 in all analyses).

While statins are known to increase EPCs, the effects of statin withdrawal on EPCs are unknown. Herein, we evaluated the effects of statin discontinuation on EPCs, inflammation and in vivo angiogenesis. Thirty-four T2D patients were randomized to 5-day discontinuation or continuation of statin treatment. At baseline and at day 5, we determined lipid profile, EPC levels, monocyte-macrophage polarization, and concentrations of hsCRP, VEGF, SDF-1\u03b1, and G-CSF. Angiogenesis by human circulating cells was assessed in vivo. At day 5, patients who stopped statins showed raised total and LDL cholesterol and EPCs compared to baseline, while no changes were observed in patients who continued statins. No changes were observed in hsCRP, VEGF, SDF-1\u03b1, G-CSF, M1 and M2 macrophages and classical, intermediate and nonclassical monocytes in both groups. In vivo angiogenesis by circulating cells was increased in patients who stopped statin treatment. In vitro, cholesterol supplementation stimulated mobilizing signals in human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells. In conclusion, a brief statin withdrawal increases circulating EPCs and functional proangiogenic cells in T2D. These findings identify statin-sensitive pathways as reverse target mechanisms to stimulate vascular repair in diabetes.",

Cox proportional hazards regressions revealed that the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for DD during the 1-year follow-up period was 1.59 for stroke patients who were statin users compared to those who were non-statin users. We further found that the adjusted HR for DD for stroke patients who were regular statin users was 1.65 compared to stroke patients who had never been prescribed statin. However, there was no increased hazard of DD for stroke patients who were irregular statin users compared to stroke patients who had never been prescribed statin (HR: 1.22, 95% CI: 0.70-2.11).",

However, data on how atherosclerosis affects ACE2 expression in heart and kidney remains unknown. Atherosclerosis was induced by feeding New Zealand White rabbits with high cholesterol diet (HCD - 2%) for 12 weeks and atorvastatin was administered (5mg/kg/day p.o) in last 3 weeks. ACE2 mRNA and protein expression was assessed by Western blotting and real time PCR. HCD fed rabbits developed atherosclerosis as confirmed by increase in plasma total cholesterol, LDL and triglycerides as well as formation atherosclerotic plaques in arch of aorta. The ACE2 protein but not mRNA expression was reduced in heart and kidney of HCD rabbits. Interestingly, atorvastatin increased the ACE2 protein expression in heart and kidney of HCD rabbits. However, atorvastatin increased ACE2 mRNA in heart but not in kidney of HCD rabbits. Atorvastatin increased the occupancy of histone H3 acetylation (H3-Ac) mark on ACE2 promoter region in heart of HCD rabbits indicating direct or indirect epigenetic up-regulation of ACE2 by atorvastatin. Further, atorvastatin suppressed Ang II-induced contractile responses and enhanced AT2 receptor mediated relaxant responses in atherosclerotic aorta. We propose that atherosclerosis is associated with reduced ACE2 expression in heart and kidney. We also show an unexplored potential of atorvastatin to up-regulate ACE2 via epigenetic histone modifications. Our data suggest a novel way of replenishing ACE2 expression for preventing not only atherosclerosis but also other cardiovascular disorders.",

Histological study of liver and kidney was done in groups 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7. The total phenolic and flavonoid content in HCS and its antioxidant activity were evaluated by the DPPH assay. Both doses of HCS decreased serum lipid profile and atherogenic indices (P < 0.05). HCS has lipid lowering, immunosuppressive and antioxidant properties, and mays have value in atherosclerosis prevention. The higher dose of HCS also reduced serum AST, ALP, and LDH levels and rosuvastatin increased AST and ALP levels (P < 0.05). Histology of the liver showed decreased lipid accumulation and improvement in hepatocytes in HCS-treated animals. The antioxidant activity of HCS may be responsible for its lipid lowering and cytoprotective action. HCS had significant lipid lowering and antioxidant activity, which; may be due to the phenolic compounds.

    "67": "Rac1 is an important regulator of axon extension, cell migration and actin reorganization. Like all Rho guanine triphosphatases (GTPases), Rac1 is targeted to the membrane by the addition of a geranylgeranyl moiety, an action thought to result in Rac1 guanosine triphosphate (GTP) binding. However, the role that Rac1 localization plays in its activation (GTP loading) and subsequent activation of effectors is not completely clear. To address this, we developed a non-prenylatable emerald green fluorescent protein (EmGFP)-Rac1 fusion protein (EmGFP-Rac1(C189A)) and assessed how expressing this construct affected neurite outgrowth, Rac1 localization and activation in neuroblastoma cells. Expression of EmGFP-Rac1(C189A) increased localization to the cytosol and induced cell clustering while increasing neurite initiation. EmGFP-Rac1(C189A) expression also increased Rac1 activation in the cytosol, compared to cells expressing wild-type Rac1 (EmGFP-Rac1). These results suggest that activation of Rac1 may not require plasma membrane localization, potentially leading to differential activation of cytosolic signaling pathways that alter cell morphology. Understanding the consequences of differential localization and activation of Rho GTPases, including Rac1, could lead to new therapeutic targets for treating neurological disorders.", 
    "68": "Cardiovascular diseases, which are the leading cause of mortality in the Western World, are closely associated with atherosclerosis development. Atherosclerosis is a chronic multifactorial disease of the arterial wall characterized by endothelial dysfunction, inflammation and oxidative stress. Oxidative stress is an alteration of the balance between pro-oxidant and antioxidant mechanisms which promotes vascular complications and represents a valid therapeutic target to prevent or treat cardiovascular diseases. Statins are enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors that have been included in the therapeutic regimen of cardiovascular diseases due to their lipid-lowering activity. Experimental and clinical data demonstrated that the antiatherogenic effects of these drugs are also related to other pleiotropic activities, particularly to their anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic and antioxidant effects. This review summarizes experimental and clinical studies demonstrating the impact of statins on atherosclerotic disease with a focus on the antioxidant activity of atorvastatin. Atorvastatin is a synthetic statin characterized by a high efficacy, in part due to its longer half-life compared to other molecules of the same group. It also exerts high antioxidant effects, independent from its hypolipidemic activity, beneficial for the prevention and therapy of atherosclerosis.",

The effect of policosanol combined with statin on PCSK9 is unknown. Methods. Protocol I: 26 patients with atherosclerosis were randomly assigned to receive either atorvastatin 20\u2009mg/d or policosanol 20\u2009mg/d + atorvastatin 20\u2009mg/d for 8 weeks. Protocol II: 15 healthy volunteers were randomly assigned to either policosanol 20\u2009mg/d or a control group for 12 weeks. Serum levels of PCSK9 were determined at day 0 and the end of each protocol. Results. Protocol I: atorvastatin 20\u2009mg/d significantly increased serum PCSK9 level by 39.4% (256 \u00b1 84\u2009ng/mL versus 357 \u00b1 101\u2009ng/mL, P = 0.002).

Prevention and treatment of cerebral vasospasm is vital to avert neurological damage and reduced functional outcomes. A variety of pharmacotherapy interventions for the prevention and treatment of cerebral vasospasm have been evaluated. Unfortunately, very few large randomized trials exist to date, making it difficult to make clear recommendations regarding the efficacy and safety of most pharmacologic interventions. Considerable debate exists regarding the efficacy and safety of hypervolemia, hemodilution, and hypertension (triple-H therapy), and the implementation of each component varies substantially amongst institutions. There is a new focus on euvolemic-induced hypertension as a potentially preferred mechanism of hemodynamic augmentation. Nimodipine is the one pharmacologic intervention that has demonstrated favorable effects on patient outcomes and should be routinely administered unless contraindications are present. Intravenous nicardipine may offer an alternative to oral nimodipine. The addition of high-dose magnesium or statin therapy has shown promise, but results of ongoing large prospective studies are needed before they can be routinely recommended. Tirilazad and clazosentan offer new pharmacologic mechanisms, but clinical outcome results from prospective randomized studies have largely been unfavorable. Locally administered pharmacotherapy provides a targeted approach to the treatment of cerebral vasospasm. However, the paucity of data makes it challenging to determine the most appropriate therapy and implementation strategy. Further studies are needed for most pharmacologic therapies to determine whether meaningful efficacy exists.",

The question addressed was: does preoperative statin therapy prevent postoperative atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients undergoing cardiac surgery? There were 445 papers found using the reported search. From these, 12 represented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. The authors, journal, date and country of publication, patient group studied, study type, relevant outcomes and results of these papers are tabulated. This paper includes three systematic reviews with meta-analysis, five randomized controlled trials and four retrospective studies. All the papers compared either all or some of the following postoperative complications: mortality, morbidity, AF, length of hospital stay (intensive care unit and hospital) and inflammatory markers. The largest study in this paper includes a systematic review of 91 491 patients that showed a reduction in postoperative AF with preoperative statin therapy (OR = 0.71, 95% CI 0.61-0.82, P <0.0001). However, the durations (3 days to 2 months preoperatively), doses and types of preoperative statin differed between these papers. Although the majority of studies (10 of 12) support the use of statins preoperatively, 2 studies found no association between preoperative statin therapy and the reduction of postoperative AF. In conclusion, the available evidence suggests that preoperative statin therapy in patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery is associated with the following: (1) a lower incidence and risk of developing postoperative AF, (2) reduced stroke, (3) a shorter hospital stay and (4) reduced levels of inflammatory markers postoperatively. However, while the evidence supports the use of statins preoperatively, the optimal duration, dose and type of statin cannot be concluded from this review.", 
    "84": "Clinical studies demonstrated favorable effects of statins in stroke beyond lipid-lowering effects. In acute stroke, the disruption of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is mediated by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). A modified MMP metabolism may account for the beneficial effects of statins. Cultured human brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) were pretreated with simvastatin and subjected to oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD). Gene expression and protein secretion of MMP-2 and MMP-9 and the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 and TIMP-2 were measured by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Simvastatin significantly dampened the expression but not secretion of MMP-2 under OGD. MMP-9 synthesis rate was low and unaffected by simvastatin treatment, while the gene expression and protein secretion of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 were both strongly induced. Our results provide evidence for a positive effect of simvastatin on the MMP metabolism in human BMECs and experimental stroke mainly by means of the increased expression and secretion of TIMP-1 and TIMP-2.",

    "115": "The existence of an independent association between elevated triglyceride (TG) levels, cardiovascular (CV) risk and mortality has been largely controversial. The main difficulty in isolating the effect of hypertriglyceridemia on CV risk is the fact that elevated triglyceride levels are commonly associated with concomitant changes in high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL) and other lipoproteins. As a result of this problem and in disregard of the real biological role of TG, its significance as a plausible therapeutic target was unfoundedly underestimated for many years. However, taking epidemiological data together, both moderate and severe hypertriglyceridaemia are associated with a substantially increased long term total mortality and CV risk. Plasma TG levels partially reflect the concentration of the triglyceride-carrying lipoproteins (TRL): very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), chylomicrons and their remnants. Furthermore, hypertriglyceridemia commonly leads to reduction in HDL and increase in atherogenic small dense LDL levels. TG may also stimulate atherogenesis by mechanisms, such excessive free fatty acids (FFA) release, production of proinflammatory cytokines, fibrinogen, coagulation factors and impairment of fibrinolysis. Genetic studies strongly support hypertriglyceridemia and high concentrations of TRL as causal risk factors for CV disease. The most common forms of hypertriglyceridemia are related to overweight and sedentary life style, which in turn lead to insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome (MS) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Intensive lifestyle therapy is the main initial treatment of hypertriglyceridemia. Statins are a cornerstone of the modern lipids-modifying therapy. If the primary goal is to lower TG levels, fibrates (bezafibrate and fenofibrate for monotherapy, and in combination with statin; gemfibrozil only for monotherapy) could be the preferable drugs. Also ezetimibe has mild positive effects in lowering TG. Initial experience with en ezetimibe/fibrates combination seems promising. The recently released IMPROVE-IT Trial is the first to prove that adding a non-statin drug (ezetimibe) to a statin lowers the risk of future CV events. In conclusion, the classical clinical paradigm of lipids-modifying treatment should be changed and high TG should be recognized as an important target for therapy in their own right. Hypertriglyceridemia should be treated.",

    "120": "The serine protease proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) binds to the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR) and directs it to lysosomes for intracellular degradation. This results in decreased numbers of LDLR available on the hepatic cell surface to bind LDL particles and remove them from the circulation and therefore to a subsequent increase in circulating LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) plasma levels. Since 2003, when the role of PCSK9 in LDL-C metabolism was discovered, there have been major efforts to develop efficient and safe methods to inhibit it. Amongst those, monoclonal antibodies against PCSK9 are the furthest in development, with multiple phase 3 trials already published and with cardiovascular endpoint trials currently underway. Two fully human monoclonal antibodies, evolocumab (AMG 145) and alirocumab (REGN727/SAR236553), have been extensively studied in a wide range of subjects, such as those with statin intolerance, as an add-on to statin therapy, as a monotherapy and in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia. PCSK9 antibodies result in a consistent and robust decrease in LDL-C plasma levels ranging from 40% to 70%, either on top of statins or as a monotherapy. If the safety data from the on-going phase 3 trials remain as reassuring as the data available till now, PCSK9 antibodies will offer a novel, powerful therapeutic option to decrease LDL-C plasma levels and, hopefully, cardiovascular risk.",

Since then, considerable evidence, including randomized controlled trials of statin therapy in adults with CKD, has helped better define medical treatments for dyslipidemia. In light of the new evidence, KDIGO (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes) formed a work group for the management of dyslipidemia in patients with CKD. This work group developed a new guideline that contains substantial changes from the prior KDOQI guideline. KDIGO recommends treatment of dyslipidemia in patients with CKD primarily based on risk for coronary heart disease, which is driven in large part by age. The KDIGO guideline does not recommend using low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level as a guide for identifying individuals with CKD to be treated or as treatment targets. Initiation of statin treatment is no longer recommended in dialysis patients. To assist US practitioners in interpreting and applying the KDIGO guideline, NKF-KDOQI convened a work group to write a commentary on this guideline. For the most part, our work group agreed with the recommendations of the KDIGO guideline, although we describe several areas in which we believe the guideline statements are either too strong or need to be more nuanced, areas of uncertainty and inconsistency, as well as additional research recommendations. The target audience for the KDIGO guideline includes nephrologists, primary care practitioners, and non-nephrology specialists such as cardiologists and endocrinologists.

We evaluated the contractile activity of smooth muscle strips of the bronchi caused by stimulation of the nerves or muscles, and changes in tone of isolated pulmonary artery rings at the application of reagents-vasodilators. The use of sulodexide promoted restoration NO-dependent mechanism of vasodilatation and improved \u03b2-adrenergic regulation of the pulmonary artery tone. The use of rosuvastatin had no effect on the dilator activity of pulmonary arteries. Both drugs improved the functional status of the bronchial smooth muscles and intrabronchial nervous system that controls the contractile activity of smooth muscle structures of the airways. The results of the study suggest that the one-way relaxing effect of sulodexide on pulmonary arterial and bronchial smooth muscles enables the recovery of coordinated regulation of the tone of these structures, which is essential for maintaining the optimal ratio of ventilation and pulmonary blood flow for efficient gas exchange.",

ETC-1002 is a dicarboxylic acid derivative with a novel mechanism of action targeting two hepatic enzymes--adenosine triphosphate-citrate lyase (ACL) and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), inhibiting sterol and fatty acid synthesis and promoting mitochondrial long-chain fatty acid oxidation. This agent is currently in phase II clinical research. Available data report that ETC-1002 significantly decreased LDL-C levels (up to 32%) in both patients with normal and elevated baseline levels of triglycerides. Such beneficial effect is superior to currently approved non-statin lipid lowering agents. The levels of apolipoprotein B (apoB) and non-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) were also reduced with beneficial effect on other cardiometabolic factors such as inflammatory markers, blood pressure and body weight. Although, the safety and tolerability of ETC-1002 needs to be confirmed in ongoing and future, larger studies, this agent has, so far, been generally safe and well tolerated. This novel, oral, once-daily, small molecule may lead to effective LDL-C lowering treatment in hypercholesterolaemic subjects who are statin intolerant or as add-on therapy in those who are unable to reach the LDL-C goals despite being on statin therapy.

Interactions of master transcription factors and signaling cascades are required for adipogenesis. Regulation of excessive adipogenic processes may be an attractive therapeutic for treatment of obesity and obesity-related diseases. In this study, we found that atorvastatin exerts an anti-adipogenic activity in 3T3-L1 pre-adipocytes, and that this activity is elevated in combination with metformin. Expression of the adipogenic master regulators PPAR\u03b3 and C/EBP\u03b1, and their target gene aP2, was suppressed by atorvastatin. Furthermore, atorvastatin treatment resulted in increased activation of the key master regulator of cellular energy homeostasis, AMPK. These biological activities of atorvastatin were elevated in combination with metformin. These anti-adipogenic activities were associated with regulation of the STAT3 and TGF-\u03b2 signaling cascades, resulting in the regulation of the expression of STAT3 target genes, such as KLF5, p53, and cyclin D1, and TGF-\u03b2 signaling inhibitory genes, such as SMAD7.

Mechanisms responsible for anthracycline-induced heart damage are controversially discussed and effective preventive measures are preferable. Here, we analyzed the influence of the lipid lowering drug lovastatin on anthracycline-induced late cardiotoxicity three month after treatment of C57BL/6 mice with five low doses of doxorubicin (5\u00d73mg/kg BW; i.p.). Doxorubicin increased the cardiac mRNA levels of BNP, IL-6 and CTGF, while the expression of ANP remained unchanged. Lovastatin counteracted these persisting cardiac stress responses evoked by the anthracycline. Doxorubicin-induced fibrotic alterations were neither detected by histochemical collagen staining of heart sections nor by analysis of the mRNA expression of collagens. Extensive qRT-PCR-array based analyses revealed a large increase in the mRNA level of heat shock protein Hspa1b in doxorubicin-treated mice, which was mitigated by lovastatin co-treatment. Electron microscopy together with qPCR-based analysis of mitochondrial DNA content indicate that lovastatin attenuates doxorubicin-stimulated hyperproliferation of mitochondria. This was not paralleled by increased expression of oxidative stress responsive genes or senescence-associated proteins. Echocardiographic analyses disclosed that lovastatin protects from the doxorubicin-induced decrease in the left ventricular posterior wall diameter (LVPWD), while constrictions in fractional shortening (FS) and ejection fraction (EF) evoked by doxorubicin were not amended by the statin. Taken together, the data suggest beneficial effects of lovastatin against doxorubicin-induced delayed cardiotoxicity. Clinical studies are preferable to scrutinize the usefulness of statins for the prevention of anthracycline-induced late cardiotoxicity.",

Inhibition of this pathway is the mechanism of statin cholesterol-lowering drugs, as well as the target of drugs to treat osteoporosis, to combat parasites, and to inhibit tumor cell growth. Unlike the human mevalonate pathway, the bacterial pathway appears to be regulated by diphosphomevalonate (DPM). Enzymes in the mevalonate pathway act to produce isopentenyl diphosphate, the product of the DPM decarboxylase reaction, utilize phosphorylated (charged) intermediates, which are poorly bioavailable. It has been shown that fluorinated DPMs (6-fluoro- and 6,6,6-trifluoro-5-diphosphomevalonate) are excellent inhibitors of the bacterial pathway; however, highly charged DPM and analogs are not bioavailable. To increase cellular permeability of mevalonate analogs, we have synthesized various prodrugs of mevalonate and 6-fluoro- and 6,6,6-trifluoromevalonate that can be enzymatically transformed to the corresponding DPM or fluorinated DPM analogs by esterases or amidases. To probe the required stabilities as potentially bioavailable prodrugs, we measured the half-lives of esters, amides, carbonates, acetals, and ketal promoieties of mevalonate and the fluorinated mevalonate analogs in human blood plasma. Stability studies showed that the prodrugs are converted to the mevalonates in human plasma with a wide range of half-lives. These studies provide stability data for a variety of prodrug options having varying stabilities and should be very useful in the design of appropriate prodrugs of mevalonate and fluorinated mevalonates.",

Hence, the objective of the present work was to determine if ROS contributes to the regulation of lovastatin biosynthesis. Exogenous antioxidants were used to reduce ROS accumulation. The addition of N-Acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) decreased ROS accumulation and concurrent lovastatin production. In solid-state fermentation (SSF), the addition of 100 mM of NAC lowered ROS accumulation by 53%, together with a 79% decrease in lovastatin biosynthesis. A similarly, situation was observed in submerged fermentation (SmF). Decreased lovastatin production was due to a lower expression of the regulatory gene lovE, and gene lovF. Moreover, the addition of H2O2 to the culture caused precocious gene expression and lovastatin biosynthesis. These results indicate that ROS accumulation in idiophase contributes to the regulation of the biosynthetic genes. It was considered that Yap1 (Atyap1) could be a transcription factor linking ROS with lovastatin biosynthesis.

The median facility-level rate of statin and high-intensity statin use among female patients (57.3% [interquartile range\u00a0= 8.93%] for statin, 20% [interquartile range\u00a0= 7.7%] for high-intensity statin use) showed significant variation. In conclusion, women with CVD are less likely to receive evidence-based statin and high-intensity statins compared with men, although, their use remains low in both genders. There is a significant facility-level variation in evidence-based statin or high-intensity statin use in female patients with CVD. With the \"statin dose-based approach\" proposed by the recent cholesterol guidelines, these results highlight areas for quality improvement.", 
    "205": "Many patients discontinue statin after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) despite its necessity. However, limited data are available describing the clinical impact of statin withdrawal after AMI. This study enrolled 3,807 patients in the Korean multicenter registry who survived for 1\u00a0year after AMI. All patients were prescribed statin at discharge and were divided into 2 groups on the basis of statin withdrawal history; 603 patients had a history of statin discontinuation and 3,204 patients continued statin therapy. The primary outcome was mortality from any cause. We also analyzed the incidence of cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, any revascularization, and stroke. The duration of follow-up was 4\u00a0years after AMI. Statin withdrawal was associated with higher mortality than continued statin treatment (hazard ratio 3.45, 95% confidence interval 2.81 to 4.24, p <0.001), primarily as the result of increased cardiac mortality (hazard ratio 4.65, 95% confidence interval 3.14 to 6.87, p <0.001). However, the incidences of nonfatal myocardial infarction, any revascularization, and stroke were not different between the groups. Analysis by propensity score matching did not affect the results. In conclusion, many patients experienced statin withdrawal after AMI, which significantly increased long-term mortality in the present study. Careful education and monitoring are needed to reduce adverse cardiac outcomes in patients after AMI.", 
    "206": "Recommended low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels for patients with documented cardiovascular disease (CVD) are <100mg/dL (2.6mmol/l) with further reduction to <70mg/dL (1.8mmol/l) for higher-risk patients. High-intensity statin treatment may halt the progression as well as stabilize and induce regression of coronary atheromatous plaques while lowering CVD event rates. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major negative determinant of coronary artery plaque regression during statin therapy. However, regression of coronary atherosclerosis in DM patients is feasible to the same degree as in those without DM when very low LDL-C values (<70mg/dL; 1.8mmol/l) are achieved with high intensity statin treatment. The recent 2013 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Guidelines on the Treatment of Blood Cholesterol to Reduce Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Risk in Adults suggest to abandon specific LDL-C treatment targets. This strategy may deprive high risk patients, such as those with DM, from very high intensity statin treatment or drug combinations aiming to achieve very low LDL-C levels in order to reduce clinical events."
