Arterial hypertension (AH), arterial stiffness (AS), older age, and female gender are the main determinants of HFpEF, but several cardiac or extra-cardiac pathologies are also possible causes. The combined ventricular-vascular stiffening (abnormal left atrium-left ventricle coupling related to AS) is the main contributor of the increased prevalence of HFpEF in elderly persons, particularly elderly women, and in younger persons with AH. The hospitalization and mortality rates of HFpEF are similar to those of heart failure with reduced EF (HFrEF). However, although the prognosis of HFrEF has been substantially improved during the last 2 decades, the effective treatment of HFpEF remains an unmet need. Regimens effective in HFrEF have no substantial effect on HFpEF, because of different pathophysiologies of the 2 syndromes. Pipeline drugs seem promising, but it will take some years before they are commercially available. Aggressive treatment of noncardiac comorbidities seems to be the only option at hand. Treatment of anaemia, sleep disorders, chronic kidney disease (CKD), non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD), atrial fibrillation, diabetes, and careful use of diuretics to reduce preload are effective to some degree. Statin treatment, despite the presence of dyslipidaemia, deserves special attention because it has been proven, mainly in small studies or post hoc analyses of trials, that it offers a substantial improvement in quality of life and a reduction in mortality rates. We need to urgently utilize these recourses to relieve a considerable part of the general population suffering from HFpEF, a deadly disease.", 
    "1": "PCSK9 is a promising target for the treatment of hyperlipidemia and cardiovascular disease. A Quantitative Systems Pharmacology model of the mechanisms of action of statin and anti-PCSK9 therapies was developed to predict low density lipoprotein (LDL) changes in response to anti-PCSK9 mAb for different treatment protocols and patient subpopulations. Mechanistic interactions and cross-regulation of LDL, LDL receptor, and PCSK9 were modeled, and numerous virtual subjects were developed and validated against clinical data. Simulations predict a slightly greater maximum percent reduction in LDL cholesterol (LDLc) when anti-PCSK9 is administered on statin background therapy compared to as a monotherapy. The difference results primarily from higher PCSK9 levels in patients on statin background. However, higher PCSK9 levels are also predicted to increase clearance of anti-PCSK9, resulting in a faster rebound of LDLc. Simulations of subjects with impaired LDL receptor (LDLR) function predict compromised anti-PCSK9 responses in patients such as homozygous familial hypercholesterolemics, whose functional LDLR is below 10% of normal.", 
    "2": "Neurological disorders (Alzheimer's disease, vascular and mixed dementia) and visual loss (cataract, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy) are among the most common conditions that afflict people of at least 65\u2009years of age. An increasing body of evidence is emerging, which demonstrates that memory and vision impairment are closely, significantly, and positively linked and that statins and aspirin may lessen the risk of developing age-related visual and neurological problems. However, clinical studies have produced contradictory results. Thus, the intent of the present study was to reliably establish whether a relationship exist between various types of dementia and age-related vision disorders, and to establish whether statins and aspirin may or may not have beneficial effects on these two types of disorders. We found that participants with dementia and/or vision problems were more likely to be depressed and displayed worse functional ability in basic and instrumental activities of daily living than controls. Mini mental state examination scores were significantly lower in patients with vision disorders compared to subjects without vision disorders. A closer association with macular degeneration was found in subjects with Alzheimer's disease than in subjects without dementia or with vascular dementia, mixed dementia, or other types of age-related vision disorders. When we considered the associations between different types of dementia and vision disorders and the use of statins and aspirin, we found a significant positive association between Alzheimer's disease and statins on their own or in combination with aspirin, indicating that these two drugs do not appear to reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease or improve its clinical evolution and may, on the contrary, favor its development. No significant association in statin use alone, aspirin use alone, or the combination of these was found in subjects without vision disorders but with dementia, and, similarly, none in subjects with vision disorders but without dementia. Overall, these results confirm the general impression so far; namely, that macular degeneration may contribute to cognitive disorders (Alzheimer's disease in particular). In addition, they also suggest that, while statin and aspirin use may undoubtedly have some protective effects, they do not appear to be magic pills against the development of cognitive impairment or vision disorders in the elderly.", 
    "3": "A major disadvantage that may occur in association with atorvastatin (ATV) therapy is elevation of serum transaminases. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of treatment of rats with various doses of ATV (2, 5, and 10 mg/kg/day) on liver function, oxidative stress, and histology and on the severity of acetaminophen (APAP) hepatotoxicity. ATV administration for 21 days resulted in a dose-dependent significant rise in serum activities of alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase. Only ATV at 10 mg/kg/day decreased reduced glutathione (GSH) levels and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, increased malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, and elicited histopathological changes in the liver. In rats challenged with APAP (500 mg/kg), the livers showed centrilobular necrosis with evident oxidative stress and liver dysfunction after 24 h. Rats challenged with APAP after pretreatment with ATV 2 or 5 mg/kg/day showed significantly lower activities of serum enzymes, higher hepatic GSH levels and SOD activities, lower MDA levels and milder histopathological changes compared with rats challenged with APAP after pretreatment with ATV 10 mg/kg/day or without drug pretreatment. In conclusion, the effect of ATV on the liver is dose dependent. Our results showed that ATV, at the highest dose used, induced hepatic lipid peroxidation and injury, suggesting a role for oxidative stress in ATV-induced hepatotoxicity. However, lower doses of ATV attenuated APAP-induced hepatotoxicity via a mechanism related, at least in part, to a reduction of APAP-induced hepatic oxidative stress. These results are of practical interest as both drugs may be used concurrently in clinical practice.", 
    "4": "Vascular endothelial cell injury is considered to be the major factor inducing vascular complications in metabolic diseases and plays an important role in other organ damage. With diabetic and hyperlipidemic rats and cultured VSMCs, the present study was aimed at investigating whether the early damage of VSMCs during metabolic diseases plays a critical role in vascular dysfunction and the underlying mechanisms and would be a promising treatment target. With diabetic and hyperlipidemic rats and cultured VSMCs, the changes and relationships of vascular relaxation and contractile function to the vital organ damage and the underlying mechanisms were investigated; meanwhile, the protective and preventive effects of lowering blood lipid and glucose and inhibition of diabetes and hyperlipidemia-induced vascular hyperreactivity were observed. Diabetic and hyperlipidemic rats presented hyperreactivity in vascular contractile response in the early stages. Hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia directly affected the contractile function of VSMCs. Early application of fasudil, a specific antagonist of Rho kinase, significantly alleviated diabetes and hyperlipidemia-induced organ damage by inhibiting vascular hyperreactivity. Diabetes and hyperlipidemia-induced inflammatory response could upregulate the expression of connexins and Rho kinase by selective downregulation of the expression of miR-10a, miR-139b, miR-206, and miR-222. These findings suggest that hyperglucose and lipid may directly impair VSMCs and induce vascular hyperreactivity in the early stages. Metabolic inflammation-induced changes in the miRNA-connexin/Rho kinase regulatory pathway are the main mechanism for vascular hyperreactivity and organ damage. Measures inhibiting vascular hyperreactivity are promising for the prevention of organ damage induced by metabolic diseases.",

Increasingly, inappropriate activation of microglia is being reported as a component of inflammation in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. The statin class of cholesterol-lowering drugs have been observed to have anti-inflammatory and protective effects in both neurodegenerative diseases and ischemic stroke, and are suggested to act by attenuating microglial activity.",

Simvastatin treatment altered the release of cytokines and trophic factors from microglia, including interleukin-1-\u03b2, tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1, and brain derived neurotrophic factor in a cholesterol-dependent manner. Conversely, simvastatin inhibited phagocytosis in microglia in a cholesterol-independent manner.",

    "16": "In animals, cholesterol is made from 5-carbon building blocks produced by the mevalonate pathway. Drugs that inhibit the mevalonate pathway such as atorvastatin (lipitor) have led to successful treatments for high cholesterol in humans. Another potential target for the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis is mevalonate diphosphate decarboxylase (MDD), which catalyzes the phosphorylation of (R)-mevalonate diphosphate, followed by decarboxylation to yield isopentenyl pyrophosphate. We recently discovered an MDD homolog, mevalonate-3-kinase (M3K) from Thermoplasma acidophilum, which catalyzes the identical phosphorylation of (R)-mevalonate, but without concomitant decarboxylation. Thus, M3K catalyzes half the reaction of the decarboxylase, allowing us to separate features of the active site that are required for decarboxylation from features required for phosphorylation. Here we determine the crystal structure of M3K in the apo form, and with bound substrates, and compare it to MDD structures. Structural and mutagenic analysis reveals modifications that allow M3K to bind mevalonate rather than mevalonate diphosphate. Comparison to homologous MDD structures show that both enzymes employ analogous Arg or Lys residues to catalyze phosphate transfer. However, an invariant active site Asp/Lys pair of MDD previously thought to play a role in phosphorylation is missing in M3K with no functional replacement. Thus, we suggest that the invariant Asp/Lys pair in MDD may be critical for decarboxylation rather than phosphorylation.",

Furthermore, the properties of pharmaceuticals can be enhanced significantly by the introduction of fluorine groups into their original structures, and significant progress has been made during the last three decades towards the development of practical procedures for the introduction of fluorine. The replacement of the fluorine atoms present in pharmaceuticals with radioactive (18)F atoms is a rational approach for designing novel PET tracers. As a fluorine-containing pharmaceutical agent, pitavastatin has attracted considerable interest from researchers working in the life sciences because it can act as an antihyperlipidemic agent as well as a substrate for hepatic organic anion transporting polypeptides (hOATP). With this in mind, it was envisaged that [(18)F]pitavastatin would be used as an excellent imaging agent for hOATP, which prompted us to investigate the synthesis of this agent. Herein, we report a practical method for the synthesis of [(18)F]pitavastatin by the Suzuki coupling reaction of p-iodofluorobenzene and a quinoline boronate derivative, with the desired product being formed in a radiochemical yield of 12 \u00b1 3% (decay corrected from [(18)F]fluoride ions, n = 3).",

Log dose-response data over doses of 1 to 80 mg, revealed strong linear dose-related effects on blood total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and non-HDL-cholesterol. When compared to atorvastatin, rosuvastatin was about three-fold more potent at reducing LDL-cholesterol. There was no dose-related effect of rosuvastatin on blood HDL-cholesterol, but overall, rosuvastatin increased HDL by 7%. There is a high risk of bias for the trials in this review, which would affect WDAEs, but unlikely to affect the lipid measurements. WDAEs were not statistically different between rosuvastatin and placebo in 10 of 18 of these short-term trials (risk ratio 0.84; 95% confidence interval 0.48 to 1.47).",

Rosuvastatin log dose-response data were linear over the commonly prescribed dose range. Based on an informal comparison with atorvastatin, this represents a three-fold greater potency. This review did not provide a good estimate of the incidence of harms associated with rosuvastatin because of the short duration of the trials and the lack of reporting of adverse effects in 44% of the placebo-controlled trials.",

    "57": "The risk assessment of organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1-mediated drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is an indispensable part of drug development. We previously reported that in vitro inhibitory potencies of several inhibitors on OATP1B1 depend on the substrates when prototypical substrates, estradiol-17\u03b2-glucuronide (E\u2082G), estrone-3-sulfate, and sulfobromophthalein were used as test substrates. The purpose of this study was to comprehensively investigate this substrate-dependent inhibition of OATP1B1 using clinically relevant OATP1B1 inhibitors and substrate drugs. Effects of cyclosporine A (CsA), rifampin, and gemfibrozil on OATP1B1-mediated uptake of 12 substrate drugs were examined in OATP1B1-expressing human embryonic kidney 293 cells. The Ki values (\u03bcM) for CsA varied from 0.0771 to 0.486 (6.3-fold), for rifampin from 0.358 to 1.23 (3.4-fold), and for gemfibrozil from 9.65 to 252 (26-fold). Except for the inhibition of torasemide uptake by CsA and that of nateglinide uptake by gemfibrozil, the Ki values were within 2.8-fold of those obtained using E\u2082G as a substrate. Preincubation potentiated the inhibitory effect of CsA on OATP1B1 with similar magnitude regardless of the substrates. R values calculated based on a static model showed some variation depending on the Ki values determined with various substrates, and such variability could have an impact on the DDI predictions particularly for a weak-to-moderate inhibitor (gemfibrozil). OATP1B1 substrate drugs except for torasemide and nateglinide, or E\u2082G as a surrogate, is recommended as an in vitro probe in the inhibition experiments, which will help mitigate the risk of false-negative DDI predictions potentially caused by substrate-dependent Ki variation.",

Previous studies have suggested that simvastatin may inhibit the cell function and tumor growth of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying simvastatin\u2011induced apoptosis in HCC cells remains to be elucidated. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of simvastatin in the regulation of cell viability, proliferation and apoptosis in HepG2 and Huh7 HCC cells, and to elucidate the specific regulatory mechanisms by which simvastatin proceeds. MTT, trypan blue and flow cytometric analyses were performed in order to detect viability, proliferation and apoptosis in HepG2 and Huh7 cells. The results of the present study demonstrated that simvastatin significantly decreased cell viability and proliferation as well as increased apoptosis in HepG2 and Huh7 cells compared to that in untreated cells. In addition, reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis revealed that simvastatin\u2011treated cells exhibited increased expression levles of Notch1, p53, and Bax, as well as decreased expression levels of B cell lymphoma 2; furthermore, Notch1 upregulation resulted in the inhibition of Akt phosphorylation. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicated that simvastatin significantly promoted apoptosis in HCC cells, the mechanism of which may have proceeded via the upregualtion of the Notch1 gene in the Akt\u2011dependent signaling pathway.", 
    "59": "Castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) cells acquire resistance to chemotherapy and apoptosis, in part, due to enhanced aerobic glycolysis and biomass production, known as the Warburg effect. We previously demonstrated that combination simvastatin (SIM) and metformin (MET) ameliorates critical Warburg effect-related metabolic aberrations of C4-2B cells, synergistically and significantly decreases CRPC cell viability and metastatic properties, with minimal effect on normal prostate epithelial cells, and inhibits primary prostate tumor growth, metastasis, and biochemical failure in an orthotopic model of metastatic CRPC, more effectively than docetaxel chemotherapy. Several modes of cell death activated by individual treatment of SIM or MET have been reported; however, the cell death process induced by combination SIM and MET treatment in metastatic CRPC cells remains unknown. This must be determined prior to advancing combination SIM and MET to clinical trial for metastatic CRPC. Treatment of C4-2B cells with combination 4\u2009\u03bcM SIM and 2\u2009mM MET (SIM+MET) led to significant G1-phase cell cycle arrest and decrease in the percentage of DNA-replicating cells in the S-phase by 24\u2009h; arrest was sustained throughout the 96-h treatment. SIM+MET treatment led to enhanced autophagic flux in C4-2B cells by 72-96\u2009h, ascertained by increased LC3B-II (further enhanced with lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine) and reduced Sequestosome-1 protein expression, significantly increased percentage of acidic vesicular organelle-positive cells, and increased autophagic structure accumulation assessed by transmission electron microscopy. Chloroquine, however, could not rescue CRPC cell viability, eliminating autophagic cell death; rather, autophagy was upregulated by C4-2B cells in attempt to withstand chemotherapy. Instead, SIM+MET treatment led to Ripk1- and Ripk3-dependent necrosis by 48-96\u2009h, determined by propidium iodide-Annexin V flow cytometry, increase in Ripk1 and Ripk3 protein expression, necrosome formation, HMGB-1 extracellular release, and necrotic induction and viability rescue with necrostatin-1 and Ripk3-targeting siRNA. The necrosis-inducing capacity of SIM+MET may make these drugs a highly-effective treatment for apoptosis- and chemotherapy-resistant metastatic CRPC cells.", 
    "60": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) in the context of this review refers to the presence of atherosclerotic disease in the arteries of the lower limbs. PAD is the third main site of atherosclerosis, after coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular disease. Intermittent claudication (IC) is the most known clinical manifestation of PAD, although most patients with leg ischemia are either asymptomatic of have atypical leg symptoms. Different drugs have been used in the past for the treatment of IC with limited results. As hypercholesterolemia is one of the main risk factors for atherosclerosis, cholesterol reduction has been shown to be effective in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Statins are inhibitor of HMG CoA reductase, an enzyme essential in cholesterol synthesis. They effectively reduce total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels and are the most efficient drugs available today in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Several studies have demonstrated that statin administration in patients with PAD results in a decreased progression and even regression in the growth of the atherosclerotic plaque. As patients with atherosclerosis of the lower limbs have frequently concurrent coronary or cerebrovascular disease, treatment of PAD with statins results in a simultaneous decrease in the incidence of coronary events and stroke. Statins have associated pleiotropic effects, including anti-inflammatory properties that contribute to their beneficial effects and to the reduction in cardiovascular death. In addition, several studies during the last years showed that statins improved pain-free walking distance, ankle brachial index and treadmill exercise time. As a result, current guidelines for cholesterol reduction in PAD patients adhere to the same indications as for other cardiovascular diseases and strongly recommend the administration of statins in these patients.", 
    "61": "Cardiovascular disease is prevalent and costly. Interventions and therapies that reduce morbidity and mortality associated with cardiovascular disease could have an enormous impact on clinical and economic outcomes. Statins reduce atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease-related morbidity and mortality; however, adherence to statins is less than optimal. It is important for clinicians as well as health plan managers to be aware of the patient- and insurance plan-specific factors that have been shown to influence adherence. Perceived statin-related side effects may also decrease adherence. Statin-related myalgia may be difficult to distinguish from myalgia caused by other conditions, and statin therapy may be discontinued unnecessarily in patients who would otherwise benefit. It is imperative that clinicians work closely with patients to improve adherence to statin therapy and be knowledgable in managing potential statin-related side effects.", 
    "62": "At present, lipoprotein apheresis, combined with high-dose statin and ezetimibe therapy, is the best available means of treating patients with homozygous and statin-refractory heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH). However, the extent of cholesterol-lowering achieved is often insufficient to meet the targets set by current guidelines. The recent advent of three new classes of lipid-lowering agents provides new hope that the latter objective may now be achievable. These compounds act either by reducing low-density lipoprotein (LDL) production by inhibiting apolipoprotein B synthesis with an antisense oligonucleotide (mipomersen) or by inhibiting microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (lomitapide), or by enhancing LDL catabolism via monoclonal antibody-mediated inhibition of the activity of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9) (evolocumab). Depending on the outcome of current trials, it seems likely that these compounds, used alone or combined with lipoprotein apheresis, will markedly improve the management of refractory FH.",

The patients were classified into two groups according to their homocysteine levels. Carotid artery plaque progression was determined before and after pitavastatin treatment. Plasma levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, platelet molecular markers, and von Willebrand factor were measured. Pitavastatin treatment had beneficial effects on the lipid profiles of these patients and slowed atherosclerosis progression. These effects were observed in both the high and low homocysteine groups. Proactive lipid intervention using pitavastatin may inhibit the progression of atherosclerosis and contribute to secondary prevention of stroke in high-risk patients. We conclude that this statin could inhibit progression at any stage of disease and should therefore be proactively administered to these patient groups, regardless of disease severity.",

Metabolic disturbances associated with diabetes could contribute to disrupting the structural and (or) functional integrity of the retina. The effects of atorvastatin on retinal cells in hyperlipidemic T2DM rats have not yet been investigated. We used Goto-Kakizaki (GK) rats fed with an atherogenic diet (AD) for 4 months to investigate whether atorvastatin (administered for 1 month) would slow-down or reverse the progression of lesions in the diabetic retina. Fluorogenic substrates were used to measure the proteasome activities in retinal cells. The production of reactive oxygen species was determined by immunofluorescence in frozen retina sections, using dihydroethydium. Nitrotyrosine levels were assessed using immunohistochemistry. Protein levels of ubiquitin conjugates, free ubiquitin, and ubiquitin activating enzyme E1 were determined with Western blotting. Atorvastatin significantly reduced the levels of oxidative stress that were induced by the AD and restored the proteasome activities in the diabetic GK rats. Atorvastatin therapy significantly improved local oxidative stress levels in GK rats fed with AD. Atorvastatin can, at least in part, restore the ubiquitin proteasome system, and may represent a pharmacological approach to prevent some of the complications associated with diabetic retinopathy.",

Dual users were less likely than nonusers or users of either medication alone to have a biopsy Gleason sum of 8-10 (P=0.033), and tended towards a lower rate of pathological T stage of pT3 or higher (P=0.064). Dual users had the highest 2-year and 5-year BCR-free survival, although this was not statistically significant (P=0.205). On multivariate regression, neither statin nor metformin use alone was significantly associated with BCR-free survival.

Recent evidence suggests that the association of statin therapy with the development of diabetes may be partly mediated by a statin-induced decrease in circulating adiponectin and coenzyme Q10. The available evidence suggests the benefit of statins in reducing cardiovascular events outweigh the risk of developing diabetes. Moreover, statin therapy does not impair glycemic control in diabetic patients. Expert recommendations for the use of statins in people at risk of developing diabetes have recently been published.

Lujo virus is only the second pathogenic arenavirus, after Lassa virus, to be recognized in Africa and the first in over 40 years. Because of the remote, resource-poor, and often politically unstable regions where Lassa fever and other viral hemorrhagic fevers typically occur, there have been few opportunities to undertake in-depth study of their clinical manifestations, transmission dynamics, pathogenesis, or response to treatment options typically available in industrialized countries.", 
    "177": "We describe the clinical features of five cases of Lujo hemorrhagic fever and summarize their clinical management, as well as providing additional epidemiologic detail regarding the 2008 outbreak. Illness typically began with the abrupt onset of fever, malaise, headache, and myalgias followed successively by sore throat, chest pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, rash, minor hemorrhage, subconjunctival injection, and neck and facial swelling over the first week of illness. No major hemorrhage was noted. Neurological signs were sometimes seen in the late stages. Shock and multi-organ system failure, often with evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy, ensued in the second week, with death in four of the five cases. Distinctive treatment components of the one surviving patient included rapid commencement of the antiviral drug ribavirin and administration of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), N-acetylcysteine, and recombinant factor VIIa.",

Considering the high case-fatality and significant logistical impediments to controlled treatment efficacy trials for viral hemorrhagic fever, it is both logical and ethical to explore the use of the various compounds used in the treatment of the surviving case reported here in future outbreaks. Clinical observations should be systematically recorded to facilitate objective evaluation of treatment efficacy. Due to the risk of secondary transmission, viral hemorrhagic fever precautions should be implemented for all cases of Lujo virus infection, with specialized precautions to protect against aerosols when performing enhanced-risk procedures such as endotracheal intubation.",

In this study, we developed a genetic manipulation system for P. yayanosii after first isolating a facultatively piezophilic derivative strain, designated P. yayanosii A1. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase gene was overexpressed in strain P. yayanosii A1 and was demonstrated to confer host cell resistance against simvastatin. Furthermore, using simvastatin as a selection marker, the endogenous pyrF of P. yayanosii A1 was disrupted through homologous recombination, thus generating the additional host strain P. yayanosii A2 (\u0394pyrF). A markerless gene disruption vector was constructed by incorporating a pyrF-sim (R) cassette that enables the combined use of simvastatin resistance for positive selection and 5-FOA for counter selection. The utility of this versatile disruption system was demonstrated by deleting the carbon-nitrogen hydrolase of P. yayanosii strain A1. These results demonstrate that a variety of genetic tools are now in place to study unknown gene function and the molecular mechanisms of piezophilic adaptation in P. yayanosii.", 
    "187": "Recently, a number of aggregation disease polypeptides have been shown to spread from cell to cell, thereby displaying prionoid behavior. Studying aggregate internalization, however, is often hampered by the complex kinetics of the aggregation process, resulting in the concomitant uptake of aggregates of different sizes by competing mechanisms, which makes it difficult to isolate pathway-specific responses to aggregates. We designed synthetic aggregating peptides bearing different aggregation propensities with the aim of producing modes of uptake that are sufficiently distinct to differentially analyze the cellular response to internalization. We found that small acidic aggregates (\u2264500 nm in diameter) were taken up by nonspecific endocytosis as part of the fluid phase and traveled through the endosomal compartment to lysosomes. By contrast, bigger basic aggregates (>1 \u03bcm) were taken up through a mechanism dependent on cytoskeletal reorganization and membrane remodeling with the morphological hallmarks of phagocytosis. Importantly, the properties of these aggregates determined not only the mechanism of internalization but also the involvement of the proteostatic machinery (the assembly of interconnected networks that control the biogenesis, folding, trafficking, and degradation of proteins) in the process; whereas the internalization of small acidic aggregates is HSF1-independent, the uptake of larger basic aggregates was HSF1-dependent, requiring Hsp70. Our results show that the biophysical properties of aggregates determine both their mechanism of internalization and proteostatic response. It remains to be seen whether these differences in cellular response contribute to the particular role of specific aggregated proteins in disease.", 
    "188": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, commonly referred to as statins, are widely used in the treatment of dyslipidaemia, in addition to providing primary and secondary prevention against cardiovascular disease and stroke. Statins' effects on the central nervous system (CNS), particularly on cognition and neurological disorders such as stroke and multiple sclerosis, have received increasing attention in recent years, both within the scientific community and in the media. Current understanding of statins' effects is limited by a lack of mechanism-based studies, as well as the assumption that all statins have the same pharmacological effect in the central nervous system. This review aims to provide an updated discussion on the molecular mechanisms contributing to statins' possible effects on cognitive function, neurodegenerative disease, and various neurological disorders such as stroke, epilepsy, depression and CNS cancers. Additionally, the pharmacokinetic differences between statins and how these may result in statin-specific neurological effects are also discussed.", 
    "189": "While the evidence base for management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is extensive, some subgroups have been underrepresented or excluded from relevant clinical trials. These subgroups - such as women, older people, diabetic patients and Indigenous Australians - present clinical challenges for which there is limited evidence to guide optimal therapy. Women may have a different pattern of presentation, with potential for delays in diagnosis and worse outcomes in ST-elevation myocardial infarction, but there is no evidence that treatments affect them differently from men. Older people suffer from a high-risk, low-treatment paradox. This may be due to under-appreciation of the benefits of treatments for older people, or to good clinical judgement in avoiding harm from worsening age-related comorbidities. Patients with diabetes have a high risk of ACS and suffer worse outcomes. Moderate glycaemic control with close monitoring and avoidance of hypoglycaemia are recommended. Coronary artery bypass grafting is preferred to percutaneous coronary intervention for patients with diabetes and multivessel disease, although the latter is reasonable in single-vessel disease. Indigenous patients have a high prevalence of coronary disease, with more frequent coronary events at a young age, a heavy load of risk factors and poor outcomes after ACS. The complex sociocultural barriers to treatment are yet to be addressed adequately.", 
    "190": "The general practitioner is essential in the management of the patient who has recently been discharged from hospital following an acute coronary syndrome (ACS), particularly as duration of hospital stay is shorter than in previous decades. GPs caring for patients after an ACS face numerous challenges. Often, the first of these is insufficient or delayed documentation from the discharging hospital, although electronic discharge summaries are alleviating this problem. Post-ACS patients often have comorbidities, and GPs play a key role in managing these. Patients taking dual antiplatelet therapy who need surgery, and post-ACS patients with atrial fibrillation, require particular care from GPs. Patients will often approach their GP for advice on the safety of other drugs, such as smoking cessation medication, and phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors for erectile dysfunction. For patients complaining of persistent lethargy after an ACS, GPs must consider several differential diagnoses, including depression, hypotension, hypovolaemia, and side effects of \u03b2-blockers. GPs play an important ongoing role in ensuring that target cholesterol levels are reached with statin therapy; this includes ensuring long-term adherence. They may also need to advise patients who want to stop statin therapy, usually due to perceived side effects. Many of these challenges can be met with improved and respectful communication between the hospital, the treating cardiologist and the GP. The patient needs to be closely involved in the decision-making process, particularly when balancing the risks of bleeding versus thrombosis.", 
    "191": "About half of all patients who experience an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in Australia have their conditions managed non-invasively - that is, they do not undergo coronary angiography and revascularisation in hospital. ACS patients whose conditions are managed non-invasively may not receive the same level of evidence-based care as those who receive coronary revascularisation. This article reviews the optimal pharmacological management of ACS managed non-invasively. There is strong evidence to support the prescription of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT; aspirin with a P2Y12 inhibitor). DAPT should continue for 12 months after an ACS, then aspirin should be continued indefinitely. Anticoagulation with warfarin or a novel oral anticoagulant may be needed if atrial fibrillation occurs; the combination with DAPT increases the risk of bleeding. Unless contraindicated, high-intensity statin therapy should be prescribed for all post-ACS patients irrespective of their cholesterol level. Non-statin lipid therapy has not been shown to improve outcomes. Use of \u03b2-adrenergic blockers is recommended in most guidelines, but the clinical trials to support this recommendation were performed more than 30 years ago, and routine long-term use may not be relevant to modern treatment, except when there is cardiac failure or left ventricular dysfunction. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers are also widely recommended, but the evidence for benefit is stronger when there is left ventricular dysfunction. Calcium-channel blockers, nitrates, antiarrhythmic drugs, digoxin and diuretics do not improve outcomes in post-ACS patients.", 
    "192": "We have investigated the influence of dopaminergic agents on the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene in relation with lipid levels in chronic mild stress (CMS). Mice subjected to CMS were treated with simvastatin (10 mg/kg, per os (orally)) along with bromocriptine (2 mg/kg, intraperitoneally (ip)), levodopa (200 mg/kg, ip), or haloperidol (0.1 mg/kg, ip) for 14 days. CMS produced a decrease in sucrose intake and an increase in serum cholesterol and triglycerides levels with a decrease in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, which were prevented by simvastatin. This was greater when it was combined with bromocriptine or levodopa. Haloperidol significantly prevented the simvastatin-induced increase in sucrose intake but not the alterations in lipids. There was an upregulation in the expression of BDNF exon-IIA and -IIB transcripts by CMS but not the exon-IIC transcripts. Simvastatin could increase expression of exon-IIC transcripts in stressed mice. This was partially increased by bromocriptine. Haloperidol significantly prevented simvastatin-induced increase in expression of BDNF exon-IIC transcripts. The results showed a positive correlation between expression of BDNF exon-IIC transcripts and sucrose intake. In conclusion, our data suggest the involvement of lipid levels and BDNF exon-IIC transcripts in CMS-induced behaviour in mice, possibly through the dopaminergic system.",

Forced Erk5 activation induces a protective phenotype in endothelial cell (EC) that is associated with a dramatically decreased migration capacity of those cells. Transcriptional profiling identified the Kr\u00fcppel-like transcription factors KLF2 and KLF4 as central mediators of Erk5-dependent gene expression. However, their downstream role regarding migration is unclear and relevant secondary effectors remain elusive. Here, we further investigated the mechanism underlying Erk5-dependent migration arrest in ECs.",

We show that endothelial Erk5 activation by expression of a constitutively active MEK5 mutant, by statin treatment, or by application of laminar shear stress strongly decreased PAK1 mRNA and protein expression. Knockdown of KLF2 but not of KLF4 prevented Erk5-mediated PAK1 mRNA inhibition, revealing KLF2 as a novel PAK1 repressor in ECs. Importantly, both PAK1 re-expression and KLF2 knockdown restored the migration capacity of Erk5-activated ECs underscoring their functional relevance downstream of Erk5.",

Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors have been emerged recently as promising hypocholesterolemic agents to confer protection against lipid-mediated atherosclerosis. Therefore, 10-dehydrogingerdione (DHGD), a novel CETP inhibitor isolated from ginger rhizomes, was selected as a natural product in the present study to illustrate its effect on haemostatic impairment associated with hyperlipidemia as compared to a currently used hypocholesterolemic agent, atorvastatin (ATOR). Rabbits were fed a high cholesterol diet (HCD) and divided into three groups. One group served as control group while the other groups received DHGD or ATOR. Dyslipidemic rabbits showed a significant increase in serum endothelin-1, ischemia modified albumin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, prothrombin fragments (1+2) and plasma fibrinogen along with a decrease of nitric oxide level in serum. Daily administration of ATOR or DHGD significantly decreased the aforementioned coagulation and ischemia biomarkers and increased serum nitric oxide.

After subcutaneous administration, albiglutide is likely primarily absorbed via the lymphatic circulation, with maximum concentrations being reached in 3 to 5 days; steady-state exposures are achieved following approximately 4 to 5 weeks of once-weekly administration. The elimination half-life of albiglutide is approximately 5 days. Clearance of albiglutide is 67 mL/h with between-subject variability of 34.9%; no covariates have been identified that would require dose adjustment of albiglutide. Albiglutide lowers the fasting plasma glucose and reduces postprandial glucose excursions. In addition, \u03b2-cell secretion is enhanced by albiglutide during hyperglycemia, whereas secretion is suppressed during hypoglycemia; \u03b1-cell response to hypoglycemia is not impaired by albiglutide. Albiglutide does not prolong the corrected QT interval but has a modest effect on heart rate in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Dose adjustment is not suggested in patients with renal impairment, but experience in patients with severe renal impairment is very limited, and it is recommended that albiglutide be used with care in such patients due to an increased frequency of diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.

Commonly used low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) target goals have been abrogated in favor of intensity of statin therapy, more in line with data from randomized clinical trials. Four groups of adult patients have been identified from these studies who will most benefit from statins: patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD); patients with primary elevations of LDL-C \u2265 190 mg/dL; diabetic patients between age 40 and 75 years without ASCVD whose LDL-C is between 70 and 189 mg/dL; and patients between age 40 and 75 years without ASCVD or diabetes with LDL-C between 70 and 189 mg/dL and an estimated 10-year ASCVD risk of 7.5% or higher. This last primary prevention group has engendered the most controversy because the newly recommended risk calculator may overestimate risk or the 7.5% threshold may be too low, thereby subjecting too many patients to statins unnecessarily.

Omega-3 fatty acids (OM3FAs), particularly the long-chain fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), effectively reduce TG and thus may impact CV outcomes; however, clinical data have been inconsistent. This review discusses the efficacy, safety, and key considerations of currently approved prescription OM3FA products in patients with elevated TG with or without concomitant elevations in other atherogenic parameters. Currently, 6 prescription OM3FA formulations are approved in the United States: omega-3-acid ethyl esters (Lovaza, Omtryg, and 2 generic formulations), omega-3-carboxylic acids (Epanova), which contain both EPA and DHA, and icosapent ethyl (Vascepa), which is an EPA-only formulation. All prescription OM3FA products effectively lower TG, with the magnitude of TG reduction affected by baseline TG level. Products that contain DHA can raise levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, which is of particular concern in patients with atherosclerosis; Vascepa, however, does not raise these levels and therefore provides these patients with another option. Long-term outcomes trials for Vascepa (ongoing) and Epanova (planned) will help clarify the potential CV benefits in patients with persistent hypertriglyceridemia despite statin therapy.",

To improve dosing accuracy and facilitate the determination of dosing regimens in function of the body weight, the proposed study aims at preparing transdermal niosomal gels of simvastatin as possible transdermal drug delivery system for pediatric applications. Twelve formulations were prepared to screen the influence of formulation and processing variables on critical niosomal characteristics. Nano-sized niosomes with 0.31\u2009\u03bcm number-weighted size displayed highest simvastatin release rate with 8.5% entrapment capacity. The niosomal surface coverage by negative charges was calculated according to Langmuir isotherm with n\u2009=\u20090.42 to suggest that the surface association was site-independent, probably producing surface rearrangements. Hypolipidemic activities after transdermal administration of niosomal gels to rats showed significant reduction in cholesterol and triglyceride levels while increasing plasma high-density lipoproteins concentration. Bioavailability estimation in rats revealed an augmentation in simvastatin bioavailability by 3.35 and 2.9 folds from formulation F3 and F10, respectively, compared with oral drug suspension. Hence, this transdermal simvastatin niosomes not only exhibited remarkable potential to enhance its bioavailability and hypolipidemic activity but also considered a promising pediatric antihyperlipidemic formulation.",

This study examines the effect of apheresis on the lipid panel and cardiac event rates before and after apheresis. An electronic health record screen of ambulatory patients identified 11 active patients undergoing lipid apheresis with 10/11 carrying a diagnosis of FH. Baseline demographics, pre- and postapheresis lipid levels, highest recorded LDL-C, cardiac events, current medications, and first apheresis treatment were recorded. Patients completed a questionnaire and self-reported risk factors and interest in alternative treatment. There were significant reductions in mean total cholesterol (-58.4%), LDL-C (-71.9%), triglycerides (-51%), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (-9.3%), and non-HDL (-68.2%) values. Thirty-four cardiac events were documented in 8 patients before apheresis, compared with 9 events in 5 patients after apheresis. Our survey showed a high prevalence of statin intolerance (64%), with the majority (90%) of participants indicating an interest in alternative treatment options. Our results have shown that lipid apheresis primary effect is a marked reduction in LDL-C cholesterol levels and may reduce the recurrence of cardiac events. Apheresis should be compared to the newer alternative treatment modalities in a randomized fashion due to patient interest in alternative options.", 
    "221": "Increasing evidence suggests vascular risk factors (VRF) play a role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Epidemiological studies have found associations between VRF and risk of AD. Treating VRF in patients with AD offers a potential treatment option but ineffective treatments should be avoided in this group who are frequently on multiple medications and in whom compliance may be challenging.",

Of these, 11 were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and 14 observational studies. Observational studies suggested that a VRF package and treatment of hypertension and statin therapy may be associated with improved outcome but these studies suffered from potential bias. The few RCTs performed were mostly small with short duration follow-up, and do not provide clear evidence either way.", 
    "224": "Observational data raises the possibility that treating VRF could alter the rate of decline in AD. However RCT data are not yet available to support this hypothesis and to alter clinical practice. RCTs in larger numbers of individuals with longer follow-up, ideally in the early stages of AD, are required to address this potentially important treatment question.", 
    "225": "The extracellular miRNAs circulate in the bloodstream and may serve as novel diagnostic and therapeutic biomarkers. The aim of the present study was to investigate circulating Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-responsive miRNA expression in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and to examine the effects of renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade and statins on miRNA levels. This study included 41 patients with CAD and 20 subjects without CAD (non-CAD). Plasma TLR4-responsive miRNA samples were analysed using a microarray assay for 1700 human miRNA. The candidate miRNAs were verified with real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. Patients with CAD were randomized to 12 months of combined treatment with either telmisartan and atorvastatin [angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB)] or enalapril and atorvastatin [angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI)]. Plasma samples were obtained from peripheral blood at baseline and after 12 months. The microarray assay showed significant differences in seven TLR4-responsive miRNAs between the CAD and non-CAD groups (P<0.05). Real-time PCR verified that miR-31, miR-181a, miR-16 and miR-145 were significantly lower in the CAD group than in the non-CAD group (P<0.01). Levels of TLR4 protein were higher in the CAD group than in the non-CAD group (P<0.01) and were negatively correlated with levels of TLR4-responsive miRNAs. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed that a panel of these four miRNAs was sensitive and specific enough to distinguish CAD from non-CAD [area under the curve (AUC)=0.93, 95% CI (confidence interval)=0.99-0.87]. Both ARB and ACEI groups showed increased TLR4-responsive miRNAs and diminished levels of TLR4 protein (P<0.05). Changes in miRNAs and TLR4 levels were greater in the ARB group than in the ACEI group (P<0.05). Circulating TLR4-responsive miRNAs including miR-31, miR-181a, miR-16 and miR-145 were significantly lower in patients with CAD compared with controls and these miRNAs may be involved in the pathogenesis of CAD.",

    "230": "In Noonan syndrome (NS) 30-50% of subjects show cognitive deficits of unknown etiology and with no known treatment. Here, we report that knock-in mice expressing either of two NS-associated mutations in Ptpn11, which encodes the nonreceptor protein tyrosine phosphatase Shp2, show hippocampal-dependent impairments in spatial learning and deficits in hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP). In addition, viral overexpression of an NS-associated allele PTPN11(D61G) in adult mouse hippocampus results in increased baseline excitatory synaptic function and deficits in LTP and spatial learning, which can be reversed by a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor. Furthermore, brief treatment with lovastatin reduces activation of the GTPase Ras-extracellular signal-related kinase (Erk) pathway in the brain and normalizes deficits in LTP and learning in adult Ptpn11(D61G/+) mice. Our results demonstrate that increased basal Erk activity and corresponding baseline increases in excitatory synaptic function are responsible for the LTP impairments and, consequently, the learning deficits in mouse models of NS. These data also suggest that lovastatin or MEK inhibitors may be useful for treating the cognitive deficits in NS.",

The chromatographic separation of atorvastatin was carried out using methanol as the mobile phase organic modifier. Various parameters affecting the extraction efficiency were optimized, such as the kind and volume of extraction solvent (1-undecanol) and disperser solvent (acetonitrile), pH, and the extraction time. The calibration curve was linear in the range of 0.2-6000 \u03bcg/L of atorvastatin (r(2) = 0.995) with a limit of detection of 0.07 \u03bcg/L. The relative standard deviation for 100 \u03bcg/L of atorvastatin in human plasma was 8.4% (n = 4). The recoveries of plasma samples spiked with atorvastatin were in the range of 98.8-113.8%.
