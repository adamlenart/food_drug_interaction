    "0": "Cardiovascular mortality, mainly due to the rupture of unstable atherosclerotic plaques, is reduced by 3-hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors. Inflammatory cells, attracted to the vascular lesion by chemokines, have been implicated in the process of the plaque rupture. In cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) and U937 mononuclear cells we have studied the effect of Atorvastatin (Atv) on nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) activity, an inducer of the mRNA expression of chemokines such as interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1). Angiotensin II (Ang II) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) increased NF-kappaB activity in VSMC (2 and 5-fold, respectively). Preincubation of cells with 10(-7) mol/l Atv diminished this activation (44 and 53%). The inhibition was reversed by mevalonate, farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP), but not by other isoprenoids. Coinciding with the NF-kappaB activation in VSMC, there was a diminution of cytoplasmic IkappaB levels that was recovered by pretreatment with Atv. Ang II and TNF-alpha induced the expression of IP-10 (1.5 and 3.4-fold) and MCP-1 (2.4 and 4-fold) in VSMC. Atv reduced this overexpression around 38 and 35% (IP-10), and 54 and 39% (MCP-1), respectively. Our results strongly suggest that Atv, through the inhibition of NF-kappaB activity and chemokine gene expression, could reduce the inflammation within the atherosclerotic lesion and play a role in the stabilization of the lesion.", 
    "1": "Inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase (statins) may enhance vascular endothelial function independent of their cholesterol lowering effect. To test this hypothesis, we surveyed two groups of patients (age 55+/-7, mean+/-SD) with coronary artery disease that were matched for age, blood pressure and serum lipid levels. Group 1 comprised 23 men without lipid-lowering medication and Group 2 included 22 patients with ongoing HMG CoA reductase inhibitor medication. Flow-mediated (endothelium-dependent) arterial dilatation (FMD) and nitrate-mediated (smooth muscle dependent) dilatation (NMD) were measured in the brachial artery using high resolution ultrasound. FMD was considerably higher in group 2 (4.3+/-2.6 vs. 2.6+/-2.8%; P<0.05). In multivariate regression model, statin use was the only significant (P<0.05) predictor of FMD. In all subjects, FMD correlated with statin dose (P<0.05 for trend). NMD was non-significantly higher in group 2 (11.4+/-5.0 vs. 9.0+/-4.2%, P=0. 08). We conclude that patients with established coronary artery disease on HMG CoA reductase inhibitor therapy have better vascular endothelial function than similar patients without the medication. These data provide further support for the idea that HMG CoA reductase inhibitors enhance endothelial function independent of their lipid-lowering effects. This may suggest that these drugs could be beneficial in secondary prevention of coronary artery disease regardless of the serum cholesterol concentration.", 
    "2": "Integrin-dependent leukocyte adhesion is modulated by alterations in receptor affinity or by post-receptor events. Pretreatment of Jurkat T-cells with the 3-hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, lovastatin, markedly reduced (IC(50) approximately 1-2 microM) alpha(4)beta(1)-dependent adhesion to fibronectin (FN) stimulated by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) which modulates post-receptor events. In contrast, lovastatin did not inhibit Jurkat cell adhesion to FN induced by the beta(1) integrin-activating monoclonal antibody (mAb) 8A2, which directly modulates beta(1) integrin affinity. Similarly, pretreatment of U937 cells with lovastatin inhibited PMA-stimulated, but not mAb 8A2-stimulated, alpha(6)beta(1)-dependent leukocyte adhesion to laminin. The inhibition of lovastatin on PMA-stimulated leukocyte adhesion was not mediated by mitogen-activated protein kinase or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway. The inhibitory effect of lovastatin on PMA-stimulated leukocyte adhesion was reversed by co-incubation with geranylgeraniol, but not with farnesol, with concurrent reversal of the inhibition of protein prenylation as shown by protein RhoA geranylgeranylation. The selective inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation by the specific protein geranylgeranyltransferase-I inhibitor, GGTI-298, blocked PMA-stimulated leukocyte adhesion but not mAb 8A2-induced leukocyte adhesion. The protein farnesyltransferase inhibitor, FTI-277, had no effect on leukocyte adhesion induced by either stimulus. These results demonstrate that protein geranylgeranylation, but not farnesylation, is required for integrin-dependent post-receptor events in leukocyte adhesion.", 
    "3": "All cells depend on sterols and isoprenoids derived from mevalonate (MVA) for growth, differentiation, and maintenance of homeostatic functions. In plants, environmental insults like heat and sunlight trigger the synthesis of isoprene, also derived from MVA, and this phenomenon has been associated with enhanced tolerance to heat. Here, we show that in human prostate adenocarcinoma PC-3M cells heat shock leads to activation of the MVA pathway. This is characterized by a dose- and time-dependent elevation in 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) activity, enhanced sterol and isoprenoid synthesis, and increased protein prenylation. Furthermore, prenylation and subsequent membrane localization of Ras, a central player in cell signaling, was rapidly induced following heat stress. These effects were dose-dependent, augmented with repeated insults, and were prevented by culturing cells in the presence of lovastatin, a competitive inhibitor of HMGR. Enhanced Ras maturation by heat stress was also associated with a heightened activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), a key mediator of both mitogenic and stress signaling pathways, in response to subsequent growth factor stimulation. Thus, activation of the MVA pathway may constitute an important adaptive host response to stress, and have significant implications to carcinogenesis.", 
    "4": "Cardiovascular disease extracts a heavy burden on society. Until recently, the role of cholesterol lowering in coronary heart disease (CHD) patients has been debated, largely because there was no clear evidence that mortality could be reduced, particularly in patients with relatively normal cholesterol levels. Large-scale, placebo-controlled trials of pravastatin have now demonstrated however, a clear benefit and the safety of this HMG CoA reductase inhibitor. In typical patients with coronary heart disease and average cholesterol levels, pravastatin reduces cardiovascular events, coronary heart disease-related deaths and total mortality when compared to placebo (secondary prevention). Myocardial infarction and mortality from coronary heart disease is also reduced in patients with elevated cholesterol levels without preexisting coronary heart disease (primary prevention). The magnitude of this benefit depends on the particular cohort and absolute risk, which has implications for health strategy. Potential mechanisms of action of pravastatin in addition to lipid lowering are also discussed.", 
    "5": "In this paper the results of recently published primary and secondary prevention trials of coronary heart disease using statins are presented. Statins are effective in patients with high and mean serum cholesterol levels, in elderly patients in men and in women. The IAS Expert Group recommendations concerning hyperlipidemia treatment in coronary heart disease prevention are presented. Lowering LDL-cholesterol, the most atherogenic lipoprotein fraction is a goal of the treatment and LDL-cholesterol level is recommended for monitoring of efficacy of the treatment. Hypertriglyceridemia (1.7-4.5 mmol/l) is a coronary heart disease risk factor, however the role of triglyceride lowering in coronary heart disease prevention remains to be established by clinical trials. Assessment and treatment of all coronary risk factors is essential for prevention.",

The effect of the same grapefruit juice and water regimen on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam (2 mg oral dose given 1 hour after the third day of grapefruit juice and water) was used as a positive control in the same subjects. Plasma concentrations of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors were determined by an enzyme inhibition assay, and concentrations of lovastatin, lovastatin acid, and midazolam were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.",

Similar effects on AUC and Cmax (approximately 40% increase for each) were noted after analysis of samples of hydrolyzed plasma (which converts inactive lactones to active hydroxy acid species). The AUC and Cmax values for lovastatin approximately doubled in the presence of grapefruit juice, whereas the same parameters for lovastatin acid increased 1.6-fold. Grapefruit juice caused the AUC for midazolam to increase by a factor of approximately 2.4.",

    "18": "Current models of nuclear organization propose that nuclear functions are modulated in part by reversible tethering of chromatin loops to structural elements of the nucleoplasm and the nuclear envelope. Lamins are the best-characterized proteins of the lamina portion of the nuclear envelope and are involved in binding chromatin to the inner nuclear membrane. However, they are not a universal feature of eukaryotic nuclei and do not account fully for the putative functions of the lamina in all organisms. It is possible that nonlamin components of the lamina may substitute for lamins in organisms from which they are absent and modify the properties of lamins during development and the cell cycle. We review the properties of the relatively small number of such components that have been reported, including the young arrest (fs(1)Ya) protein of Drosophila, statin, circumferin, and the MAN antigens. The experimental evidence indicates they are a diverse group of proteins, and that at least some have the potential to modulate the interactions of chromatin, lamins, and the nuclear membranes.",

    "23": "The effects of dietary supplementation of a citrus bioflavonoid, naringenin, on the cholesterol metabolism were studied. For 42 days male rats were fed a 1% (wt/wt) high-cholesterol diet with or without a naringenin supplementation (0.1%, wt/wt) to study its effect on plasma lipid levels, hepatic lipid contents, activities of hepatic acyl coenzyme A:cholesterol O-acyltransferase (ACAT) and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, and the excretion of fecal neutral sterols. Naringenin did not significantly alter the concentration of plasma triglycerides, but lowered the plasma cholesterol (3.80 vs. 3.12 mmol/l) concentration and the hepatic cholesterol content (70.3 vs. 54.0 mg/g) significantly (p < 0.05) compared to those of the controls. HMG-CoA reductase (1,879.0 vs. 1,715.0 pmol/min/mg) and ACAT activities (806.0 vs. 563.0 pmol/min/mg) were significantly lower in the naringenin-supplemented group than in controls. Naringenin supplementation caused a marked decrease in the excretion of fecal neutral sterols (242.9 mg/day) compared to the controls (521.9 mg/day). These results show that naringenin lowers the plasma and hepatic cholesterol concentrations by suppressing HMG-CoA reductase and ACAT in rats fed a high-cholesterol diet.", 
    "24": "Protein degradation is employed in both regulation and quality control. Regulated degradation of specific proteins is often mediated by discrete regions of primary sequence known as degrons, whereas protein quality control involves recognition of structural features common to damaged or misfolded proteins, rather than specific features of an individual protein. The yeast HMG-CoA reductase isozyme Hmg2p undergoes stringently regulated degradation by machinery that is also required for ER quality control. The 523 residue N-terminal transmembrane domain of Hmg2p is necessary and sufficient for regulated degradation. To understand how Hmg2p undergoes regulated degradation by the ER quality control pathway, we analyzed over 300 mutants of Hmg2p. Regulated degradation of Hmg2p requires information distributed over the entire transmembrane domain. Accordingly, we refer to this determinant as a 'distributed' degron, which has functional aspects consistent with both regulation and quality control. The Hmg2p degron functions in the specific, regulated degradation of Hmg2p and can impart regulated degradation to fusion proteins. However, its recognition is based on dispersed structural features rather than primary sequence motifs. This mode of targeting has important consequences both for the prediction of degradation substrates and as a potential therapeutic strategy for targeted protein degradation using endogenous degradation pathways.", 
    "25": "To test the Kirsten-Ras (Ki-Ras) alternative prenylation hypothesis in malignant transformation, we used a novel farnesyltransferase inhibitor competitive to farnesyl-pyrophosphate, RPR130401, and a CaaX peptidomimetic geranylgeranyltransferase-1 inhibitor GGTI-298. In Ki-Ras-overexpressing transformed adrenocortical cells, RPR130401 at 1-10 microM inhibited very efficiently the [(3)H]farnesyl but not [(3)H]geranylgeranyl transfer to Ras. However, proliferation of these cells was only slightly sensitive to RPR130401 (IC(50)=30 microM). GGTI-298 inhibited the growth of these cells with an IC(50) of 11 microM but cell lysis was observed at 15 microM. The combination of 10 microM RPR130401 and 10 microM GGTI-298 inhibited efficiently (80%) cell proliferation. These combined inhibitors but not each inhibitor alone blocked the cell cycle in G(0)/G(1) and disrupted MAP kinase activation. Thus, combination of two inhibitors, at non-cytotoxic concentrations, acting on the farnesyl-pyrophosphate binding site of the farnesyltransferase and the CaaX binding site of the geranylgeranyltransferase-1 respectively is an efficient strategy for disrupting Ki-Ras tumorigenic cell proliferation.", 
    "26": "Clinical studies have shown that treatment with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors can stabilize atherosclerotic plaques and slow their progression. One determinant of plaque stability and size is the composition of the vascular extracellular matrix. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of different HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on the expression of major components of the vascular extracellular matrix in smooth muscle cells. Cultured human vascular smooth muscle cells were incubated for 24-72 h with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors lovastatin (1-50 micromol/L), simvastatin (0.05-20 micromol/L), and pravastatin (1-100 micromol/L). RNA expression of the extracellular matrix proteins thrombospondin-1, fibronectin, collagen type I, and biglycan as well as expression of the cytokine TGF-beta1 was determined by Northern blotting. Extracellular matrix protein secretion was visualized by immunofluorescence. In addition, cell proliferation and viability were measured using BrDU-ELISAs, MTT-tests, and direct cell counting. Expression of thrombospondin-1 was significantly decreased after 24 h incubations with lovastatin in concentrations as low as 1 micromol/L. Coincubation with the cholesterol precursor mevalonate completely reversed this effect. The downregulation of thrombospondin-1 expression occured in the same concentration range that also inhibited cell proliferation. In contrast, lovastatin did not affect expression of fibronectin, whereas collagen type I and biglycan expression decreased only after long incubations with high, toxic lovastatin concentrations. Simvastatin, but not the very hydrophilic compound pravastatin, had a similar effect on extracellular matrix expression as lovastatin. In summary, lovastatin and simvastatin predominantly decrease the expression of the glycoprotein thrombospondin-1, which is functionally associated with smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation. In contrast, expression of plaque-stabilizing extracellular proteins such as collagen type I and biglycan are much less affected.", 
    "27": "Sterols, carotenoids and gibberellins are synthesized after the reduction of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) to mevalonate in different subcellular compartments of the fungus Gibberella fujikuroi. Lovastatin inhibits growth in many organisms, presumably because of the inhibition of the synthesis of essential terpenoids. However, in G. fujikuroi growth of the mycelia and sterol and carotenoid content were not affected by the presence of lovastatin. Nevertheless, lovastatin did inhibit the accumulation of gibberellins in the culture medium; this inhibition, however, was counteracted by the addition of mevalonate to the medium. The conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate in cell-free extracts was inhibited by 10 nM lovastatin. Since G. fujikuroi apparently possesses a single gene for HMG-CoA reductase, as shown by Southern hybridization and PCR amplification, it was concluded that the biosynthesis of sterols, carotenoids and gibberellins shares a single HMG-CoA reductase, but the respective subcellular compartments are differentially accessible to lovastatin.",

    "34": "It has been postulated that the rate of hepatic very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) apolipoprotein (apo) B secretion is dependent upon the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. To test this hypothesis in vivo, apoB kinetic studies were carried out in miniature pigs before and after 21 days treatment with high-dose (10 mg/kg/day), atorvastatin (A) or simvastatin (S) (n = 5). Pigs were fed a diet containing fat (34% of calories) and cholesterol (400 mg/day; 0.1%). Statin treatment decreased plasma total cholesterol [31 (A) vs. 20% (S)] and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations [42 (A) vs. 24% (S)]. Significant reductions in plasma total triglyceride (46%) and VLDL triglyceride (50%) concentrations were only observed with (A). Autologous [131I]VLDL, [125I]LDL, and [3H]leucine were injected simultaneously, and apoB kinetic parameters were determined by triple-isotope multicompartmental analysis using SAAM II. Statin treatment decreased the VLDL apoB pool size [49 (A) vs. 24% (S)] and the hepatic VLDL apoB secretion rate [50 (A) vs. 33% (S)], with no change in the fractional catabolic rate (FCR). LDL apoB pool size decreased [39 (A) vs. 26% (S)], due to reductions in both the total LDL apoB production rate [30 (A) vs. 21% (S)] and LDL direct synthesis [32 (A) vs. 23% (S)]. A significant increase in the LDL apoB FCR (15%) was only seen with (A). Neither plasma VLDL nor LDL lipoprotein compositions were significantly altered. Hepatic HMG-CoA reductase was inhibited to a greater extent with (A), when compared with (S), as evidenced by 1) a greater induction in hepatic mRNA abundances for HMG-CoA reductase (105%) and the LDL receptor (40%) (both P < 0.05); and 2) a greater decrease in hepatic free (9%) and esterified cholesterol (25%) (both P < 0.05). We conclude that both (A) and (S) decrease hepatic VLDL apoB secretion, in vivo, but that the magnitude is determined by the extent of HMG-CoA reductase inhibition.", 
    "35": "p107 protein, a member of the retinoblastoma family protein, suppresses growth promotion in cancer cells. We have already reported evidence that calpain, a calcium dependent protease is involved in the cleavage of p107 protein. We show here that p107 protein can also be a substrate for ubiquitination. A negative growth regulator, the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin was found to induce loss of p107 protein which was reversible by a specific protease inhibitor lactacystin as well as calpain inhibitor. Following treatment with lovastatin higher molecular weight ubiquitinated forms of p107 were detected by anti-p107 immunoprecipitation and anti-ubiquitin Western blotting. These forms further increased when lactacystin was added to culture medium. These results indicate that ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays a potential role in the degradation as well as calpain. The data presented here suggest a model in which calpain and ubiquitin-proteasome system possibly play a cooperative role in targeting the protein under certain conditions.", 
    "36": "In the United States, coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death in women. The incidence of CHD rises dramatically in women following menopause, which can be partially attributed to a more atherogenic lipoprotein profile. For years, observational and epidemiological data have suggested that estrogen and progesterone therapy reduced CHD end points. However, the first prospective trial that evaluated hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for secondary CHD prevention demonstrated no positive cardiovascular benefit of HRT compared with placebo. In interventional studies, the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA)reductase inhibitors significantly reduced CHD outcomes in postmenopausal women, and these agents have emerged as the drugs of choice for primary and secondary CHD prevention. The selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) may have a role in CHD prevention, but long-term clinical trials evaluating end points are needed. An evidence-based approach is necessary when deciding the appropriate pharmacotherapy of dyslipidemia in postmenopausal women.", 
    "37": "The hypolipidemic effect of NK-104 and its mechanisms of action (effects on hepatic sterol synthesis, low density lipoprotein (LDL)-receptor expression and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion) were studied in guinea pigs using simvastatin as a reference substance. There was a dose-dependent and significant reduction of both plasma total cholesterol (17.4, 24.5 and 45.3% at 0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg, respectively) and triglycerides (21.1 and 32.2% at 1 and 3 mg/kg, respectively) after 14-day administration of NK-104. Simvastatin at 30 mg/kg lowered plasma total cholesterol (25.0%) but not triglyceride levels. NK-104 (3 mg/kg) and simvastatin (30 mg/kg) inhibited hepatic sterol synthesis by approximately 80%, 3 h after dosing, and enhanced LDL receptor binding-capacity of liver membranes 1.5-fold after 14-day dosing. The former group accelerated LDL clearance somewhat more markedly than the latter, and increased fractional catabolic rate 1.8-fold (vs. 1.4-fold). Furthermore, only the NK-104 (3 mg/kg) suppressed VLDL secretion into the liver perfusate (triglyceride. 19.9%; apoB, 24.2%) with extensive reduction of hepatic sterol synthesis caused by prolonged action. These results indicate that NK-104 and simvastatin at 10 times the dosage of the former, similarly enhances hepatic LDL receptor; however, only NK-104 with prolonged action suppresses VLDL secretion to show higher cholesterol-lowering potency and triglyceride-reducing effect.", 
    "38": "Angiotensin II (Ang II) was shown to be an important risk factor for accelerated atherosclerosis. Inhibition of Ang II action on the arterial wall by blocking its production with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or by blocking binding to its receptors on cells with antagonists was shown to attenuate atherogenesis in animal model of atherosclerosis. We questioned whether Ang II atherogenicity is related to a stimulatory effect of Ang II on macrophage cholesterol biosynthesis. Angiotensin II injected intraperitoneally once a day (0.1 ml of 10(-7) M per mouse) for a period of 30 days, to the apolipoprotein E deficient mice increased the atherosclerotic lesion area by 95% (P < 0.01 vs. control), compared to placebo-injected mice, with no significant effect on blood pressure or on plasma cholesterol levels. On using mouse peritoneal macrophages (MPMs) that were harvested after intraperitoneally injection of Ang II, an increased rate of cellular cholesterol biosynthesis (measured as incorporation of [3H]acetate into cholesterol) by up to 90% (P < 0.01 vs. control) was observed. In mice treated with the ACE inhibitor, Fosinopril (25 mg/kg per day) a reduction in their MPM's cholesterol synthesis by up to 70% (P < 0.01 vs. control) was obtained. In vitro studies in human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDM), in MPMs from control BALB/c mice, and in J-774 A.1 macrophage-like cell line demonstrated up to 44, 34 and 30% stimulation of macrophage cholesterol biosynthesis, respectively, following cell incubation with 10(-7) M Ang II for 18 h at 37 degrees C. The stimulatory effect of Ang II on macrophage cholesterol biosynthesis could be related to its interaction with the macrophage AT1 receptor, as Losartan (10(-5) M), an AT1 blocker, but not PD 123319 (10(-5) M), an AT2 blocker, prevented the stimulatory effect on macrophage cholesterol synthesis. Furthermore, in cells that lack the AT1 receptor (RAW macrophages), Ang II did not increase cellular cholesterol synthesis. Ang II increased macrophage 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl CoA (HMG CoA) reductase mRNA levels in a dose dependent manner in J-774 A.1 macrophages and in MPM. Losartan, the AT1 receptor antagonist clearly attenuated this mRNA induction. We thus conclude that Ang II stimulation of macrophage cholesterol biosynthesis is related to its interaction with the AT1 receptor, followed by stimulation of macrophage HMG CoA reductase gene expression, which leads to increased cellular cholesterol biosynthesis, and can possibly result in macrophage cholesterol accumulation and foam cell formation.", 
    "39": "The effects of fluvastatin therapy on parameters of coagulation and fibrinolysis were evaluated in patients with diabetic dyslipidemia in a randomized, placebo-controlled study. Fluvastatin therapy was associated with a small reduction in factor VII coagulant activity, von Willebrand factor, and in plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 and tissue plasminogen activator antigens, but the effects of fluvastatin on hemostatic factors were much less marked than its effects on plasma lipids.", 
    "40": "Sterol synthesis by the mevalonate pathway is modulated, in part, through feedback-regulated degradation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGR). In both mammals and yeast, a non-sterol isoprenoid signal positively regulates the rate of HMGR degradation. To define more precisely the molecule that serves as the source of this signal, we have conducted both pharmacological and genetic manipulations of the mevalonate pathway in yeast. We now demonstrate that farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) is the source of the positive signal for Hmg2p degradation in yeast. This FPP-derived signal does not act by altering the endoplasmic reticulum degradation machinery in general. Rather, the FPP-derived signal specifically modulates Hmg2p stability. In mammalian cells, an FPP-derived molecule also serves as a positive signal for HMGR degradation. Thus, both yeast and mammalian cells employ the same strategy for regulation of HMGR degradation, perhaps by conserved molecular processes.", 
    "41": "For the investigation of the mechanism responsible for the hypotriglyceridemic effect of NK-104, a new synthetic inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme for cholesterol synthesis, isolated rat liver was perfused with or without NK-104 in the presence of exogenous [1-(14)C]oleic acid substrate. Addition of NK-104 tended to increase the ketone body production while it caused a significant decrease in the secretion rate of triglyceride by the perfused liver without affecting uptake of exogenous [1-(14)C]oleic acid. The inhibitor also significantly decreased hepatic triglyceride concentration. The altered triglyceride secretion was accompanied by a concomitant decreased incorporation of exogenous [1-(14)C]oleate into triglyceride. The conversion of exogenous [1-(14)C]oleic acid substrate indicated an inverse relationship between the pathways of oxidation and esterification. No effect of NK-104 on hepatic secretion of cholesterol was observed. These results suggest that NK-104 exerts its hypotriglyceridemic action, primarily by diverting the exogenous free fatty acid to the pathways of oxidation at the expense of esterification.", 
    "42": "We examined the effects of lovastatin, a common anti-atherosclerotic drug and a blocker of the cell cycle, on the process of mitosis. It is known that lovastatin induces an arrest or a retardation of the cell cycle in many cell types not only at the G(1)phase, but also at the G(2)/M transition. After 24-48 h incubation of epithelial PtK(2), T24, HeLa cells and fibroblastic L929 cells in the presence of 1. 0-60.0 microm lovastatin, diverse mitotic perturbations have been observed. The most noteworthy phenomena recorded were prometaphase retardation and chromosome lagging during metaphase and anaphase. After the recovery in lovastatin-free media, the cells continued mitosis without any disturbances. Mevalonic acid prevented the effects of lovastatin. We conclude that the effects were specific for lovastatin-induced inhibition of mevalonic acid synthesis. Immunofluorescence studies with anticentromeric antibodies suggested that one of the possible causes of the lovastatin-induced mitotic disorder could be an interference with the development and function of the centromeres.", 
    "43": "The changes in low density lipoprotein (LDL) composition and oxidizability after LDL-apheresis (LA) using dextran sulfate cellulose columns were evaluated in 12 hypercholesterolemic men (mean+/-S.D. total cholesterol (TC) 9.7+/-1.8 mmol/l). After 10-20 months on biweekly LA combined with simvastatin 40 mg per day immediate pre-apheresis levels of TC, LDL-cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B were decreased to 5.3+/-1.3 mmol/l, 3.3+/-1.2 mmol/l, and 1.6+/-0.4 g/l, respectively, whereas apheresis induced mean acute reductions of 61, 78, and 76%, respectively. Measurements of copper-induced LDL-oxidizability in vitro showed an increased resistance against oxidation after LA until day 3 post-treatment: lag time (min) (day 0 (before LA) versus day 1 (post-LA)) 112+/-27 versus 130+/-26 (P=0.001), maximal rate of diene production (nmol/min per mg LDL) 11.1+/-2.7 versus 9.1+/-2.1 (P=0.001), and time to maximal diene production (min) 186+/-39 versus 209+/-35 (P=0. 001). Analysis of the chemical composition of LDL revealed a 25% (P<0.001) reduced content of cholesteryl esters and a decrease of the cholesterol to protein ratio of 1.20+/-0.25 to 0.70+/-0.22 (P<0. 001) through the 3rd day post-LA. Linoleic acid and arachidonic acid content of LDL decreased 11 and 18%, respectively, at the expense of palmitic acid. Vitamin E levels (mg/l) were significantly lowered due to reduction of the lipoprotein pool by apheresis; however, vitamin E content of LDL did not change in the days after apheresis when expressed per g protein or per micromol linoleic acid. The changes in fatty acid pattern were strongly associated with changes in LDL-oxidizability indices (P</=0.01). Thus, LA effectively decreased LDL pool size, inducing the presence of less buoyant lipoproteins, which were less susceptible to in vitro oxidation. This was not explained by changes in vitamin E levels, but by short-term changes in the fatty acids composition.", 
    "44": "In addition to their primary mode of action, statins and blockers of the renin-angiotensin system possess common additional properties that are under active investigation. The inhibition of cellular proliferation, the restoration of endothelial activity, the inhibition of platelet reactivity, and an antioxidant potential are only a few examples of shared effects that target the arterial wall. These and other properties may eventually become exploited for the improved treatment of cardiovascular diseases and of other diseases apparently unrelated to the cardiovascular field, including inflammation and cancer. This review analyzes the current knowledge on the pleiotropic properties of these classes of drugs. Direct comparison indicates that study of the associations among these drugs may eventually disclose additive or synergistic effects that, perhaps even at lower dosages, may provide improved vascular protection and a strong alliance against several atherogenic mechanisms.", 
    "45": "Inhibition of esterified and non-esterified cholesterol synthesis by lovastatin in primary rat hepatocytes suppressed the net synthesis and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion of apolipoprotein B (apoB)-48 and apoB-100. Lovastatin did not alter the rates of apoB-48 and apoB-100 post-translational degradation. 25-Hydroxycholesterol, which inhibited non-esterified cholesterol synthesis but increased the synthesis of cholesteryl ester, showed differential effects on the metabolism of apoB-48 and apoB-100. Whereas the secretion of apoB-48 VLDL was suppressed there was no effect on the secretion of apoB-100 VLDL. The post-translational degradation of apoB-48, but not of apoB-100, was enhanced by 25-hydroxycholesterol. The net synthesis rates of apoB-48 and apoB-100 were unaffected by 25-hydroxycholesterol. The inhibitory effect of lovastatin alone on the net synthesis of apoB-48 and apoB-100 was reversed by the simultaneous presence of 25-hydroxycholesterol, suggesting a role for newly synthesised cholesteryl ester. Prevention of the reversal effect by the acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) inhibitor YM 17E supported this interpretation. In the presence of lovastatin, restoration of the net synthesis of apoB by 25-hydroxycholesterol was not accompanied by an increased VLDL output of apoB-48 and apoB-100. However, under these conditions there was an increased post-translational degradation of apoB-48 and apoB-100. These results suggest that interference with intracellular cholesterol and cholesteryl ester metabolism interrupts VLDL assembly at sites of both apoB net synthesis and post-translational degradation.", 
    "46": "Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) mediates neutral lipid transport in plasma, resulting in a net transfer of cholesteryl ester from high density lipoprotein to very low density lipoprotein. CETP gene expression is regulated by cholesterol, and plasma CETP level increases in patients with hyperlipidemia and with cholesterol feeding. Simvastatin, unlike cholestyramine, reduces hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity and may decrease a cellular pool of cholesterol, which is regulatory for CETP gene expression. The effects of simvastatin and cholestyramine on plasma lipids and CETP in 24 male and 19 female patients with primary hypercholesterolemia were compared. Following a four-week placebo period, patients were randomly assigned to receive either simvastatin or cholestyramine. Medication was increased in a stepwise fashion (from 10 to 40 mg for simvastatin and from 8 to 24 g for cholestyramine) as required at six-week intervals to maintain a low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level below 3.4 mmol/L. At the end of the 18-week study, the mean dose of simvastatin was 28.6 mg/day and of cholestyramine 19.3 g/day. Simvastatin was more effective than cholestyramine in lowering LDL-C (-36.8% versus -27. 2%; P=0.031) and triglycerides (-8.5% versus +12.5%; P=0.045). Plasma CETP level decreased by 14.8% following treatment with simvastatin (P=0.003) but did not change following cholestyramine treatment. This study demonstrates that, compared with cholestyramine, simvastatin results in more favourable improvements in the plasma lipoprotein profile and also lowers plasma levels of CETP.",

    "48": "The prevalence of 3-methylglutaconic aciduria was evaluated among children with developmental language disorders. A urine specimen was obtained from 40 children referred for developmental language delay to the Tel-Aviv Child Development Center during 12/96-6/97 and from 50 age-matched controls. Urine organic acids were analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Urinary 3-methylglutaconic acid was quantified. A mildly increased excretion of 3-methylglutaconic acid was found in 8 children with developmental language delay. The combined excretion of 3-methylglutaconic and 3-methylglutaric acid was increased in 9 patients. There were no differences in the excretion of other organic acids. The patients with elevated 3-methylglutaconic acid did not differ from the other patients with developmental language disorders in any of the parameters evaluated. Mildly elevated urinary levels of 3-methylglutaconic acid may be a marker of a still undefined metabolic disorder presenting with developmental language delay. A further study in large groups of children with different developmental disorders is mandatory.", 
    "49": "Rhabdomyolysis is described as an adverse event of simvastatin therapy either by itself or in combination with other medications. It is unclear whether this phenomenon is specific to simvastatin or to all cholesterol-lowering agents as single-dose therapy or caused by the association of special coadministered medications. We describe two cases in which rhabdomyolysis developed after coadministration of simvastatin (20 mg/d) and the antifungal ketoconazole. The clinical features, blood examination results, and positive outcome were very similar in both cases. We concluded that ketoconazole, an antifungal sterol synthetic inhibitor of the azol group, may induce rhabdomyolysis in patients undergoing treatment with simvastatin, a lipid lowering agent, and increase the possibility of muscle-damaging adverse events of the agents.",

Treatment with the HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor fluvastatin (40 mg) significantly reduced the serum low density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration by 30% (p<0.01) and total cholesterol by 25% (p<0.01). The platelet membrane activation markers CD62 (PADGEM, P-selectin, GMP140) and 63 (GP53) significantly decreased by 22 and 13% (in terms of the relative fluorescence intensity) under the treatment with fluvastatin (p<0.05), respectively. The cholesterol-lowering effect is accompanied by a significant reduction of the platelet membrane activation markers CD62 and CD63 reflecting a reduced platelet activity that may contribute to the vasoprotective profile of fluvasatin.",

    "55": "The long-term safety profile of simvastatin, established over 10 years of clinical use, is excellent. The principal adverse effect of all inhibitors of hydroxymethylglutarate co-enzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, myopathy, is infrequent. Simvastatin is a substrate for cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4). CYP3A4 inhibitors can elevate the plasma concentration of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity derived from simvastatin. Clinical experience has shown that concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 increase the risk for myopathy. Evaluation of data from clinical trials and postmarketing surveillance allows assessment of whether concomitant use of weaker CYP3A4 inhibitors, as represented by calcium channel blockers, has any effect on the risk of myopathy. Cases of myopathy in long-term clinical megatrials and in analyses of postmarketing adverse event reports have been surveyed. In megatrials with simvastatin, the overall incidence of myopathy was 0.025%. The proportion of patients developing myopathy who were taking a calcium channel blocker with simvastatin (1 of 3) was similar to the proportion of patients taking a calcium channel blocker overall. Among marketed-use adverse event reports, concomitant medication with a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor was more frequent among reports of myopathy than among reports of nonmusculoskeletal adverse events. No excess use of calcium channel blockers among myopathy reports was observed. We conclude that the overall risk of myopathy during treatment with simvastatin is very low. Potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, especially cyclosporine, significantly increase the risk. There is no evidence that weaker CYP3A4 inhibitors such as calcium channel blockers increase the risk.", 
    "56": "Fluvastatin is a synthetic hypolipidemic drug which inhibits 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. We compared in vitro the antioxidative effects of two enantiomers (3R, 5S and 3S, 5R) of fluvastatin, which is clinically used as a racemic mixture, on copper ion-induced oxidation of human low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Although 3R,5S-enantiomer of fluvastatin has 30-fold stronger inhibitory activity on HMG-CoA reductase than its optical counterpart, the antioxidative effects of these enantiomers on copper ion-induced LDL oxidation were similar. The antioxidative effects of the metabolites of fluvastatin (M2, M3, M4 and M7) on the copper ion-induced LDL oxidation were also investigated. All the metabolites tested showed an inhibitory effect on this system. Among them, the effects of M2 and M3, which have a phenolic hydroxyl group in each indole moiety, were strong and their potencies were 30-50 times greater than that of fluvastatin. We conclude that not only 3R,5S-enantiomer of fluvastatin but also its optical counterpart and the metabolites also have a potential to show the anti-atherosclerotic effect through their antioxidative activities on lipid peroxidation.", 
    "57": "The cost-effectiveness of each of the six hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors currently available was studied. For a cohort of patients between the ages of 60 and 85 years with coronary heart disease (CHD) who were taking atorvastatin, cerivastatin, fluvastatin, lovastatin, pravastatin, or simvastatin, the number of survivors, the annual direct cost per survivor, and the annual indirect cost saving per survivor associated with the predicted reduction in the rate of nonfatal myocardial infarction recurrences were projected. Percent reductions in excess mortality due to CHD were derived from the relative risks of cardiac mortality in treatment versus control groups in the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S). Doses necessary to provide a long-term 35.57% reduction in low-density- lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, as seen in 4S, were estimated. One-way sensitivity analyses were performed to assess the importance of the baseline assumptions. The cost per year of life saved ranged from $5,421 with atorvastatin to $15,073 with lovastatin. The patient's age at time of diagnosis of CHD had a major impact on the cost-effectiveness of the drugs; cost-effectiveness per year of life saved was higher for older patients than younger patients. The six currently marketed HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors varied widely in cost and effectiveness in producing reductions in the LDL-cholesterol concentrations that have been shown to prevent recurrent MI; there was an approximately threefold difference in the cost per year of life saved between the most cost-effective and least cost-effective agents.",

Secondary prevention should therefore be borne in mind by every cardiologist. In order to test this concept and/or to promote secondary prevention in our country, the following survey was conducted by our working group for epidemiology and prevention. All interventional centres of the country (7 million inhabitants) were asked to report relevant data of 50 consecutive patients with PTCA in a structured questionnaire. Thirteen centres responded and we report the data of 650 patients. The mean proportion of women was 28%, the mean age 61.1 years and the mean stent rate 49.8%. The indications for PTCA varied widely: stable angina 10-74%, unstable angina 10-86%, primary PTCA 0-22%. The risk factor history was distributed as follows: diabetes 12-46% (mean 22.3%), hypertension 32-68% (mean 54.2%), current smoking 6-56% (mean 21.9%), and total cholesterol (TChol) > 200 mg/dl: 30-78% (mean 60.3%). Current lipid values were available for T chol. in 44-100% (mean 84.5%) and for LDL in 4-100% (mean 67.1%). Dietary counselling by a dietician was done in 4-100% of patients (mean 35.6%) Information concerning the hazards of smoking was given to 25-100% (mean 83.6%) of current smokers. Drug treatment at hospital discharge was as follows: 84-100% (mean 93.1%) received ASA, 24-74% (mean 49.8%) ticlopidine, 6-84% (mean 53.3%) nitrates, 34-82% (mean 60.2%) beta blockers, 10-70% (mean 39.5%) ACE inhibitors, 4-74% (mean 4 7.2%) lipid lowering drugs, 7-48% (mean 17.8%) calcium antagonists, 0-12% (mean 6.1%) digitalis and 0-28% (mean 13.6%) diuretics. Follow-up data were collected in 4 centres at 6 months post discharge and were available for 174 patients. Here we found an increase in the prescription of calcium antagonists, digitalis and statins. The following conclusions were drawn at a conference in which all centres participated: lipid values should be available for each patient at PTCA, dietary counselling should be initiated for every patient during hospitalisation (and continued by the family physician) and the national cardiac society should promote guidelines for the use of drugs in which the variation in use is too wide at present. It should be ensured that these guidelines are implemented not only in patients after AMI but also in those after PTCA.", 
    "67": "The potential mutual interaction between cerivastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, and digoxin was assessed in this nonmasked, nonrandomized, multiple-dose study. The effect of cerivastatin 0.2 mg on mean plasma digoxin levels and the effect of digoxin on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of cerivastatin were assessed in 20 healthy normocholesterolemic men between 18 and 45 years of age weighing 140 to 200 lbs (63.3 to 90.0 kg). Subjects were given a single dose of cerivastatin 0.2 mg. After a 2-day washout period, subjects were given a loading dose of digoxin 0.5 mg for 3 days followed by 0.25 mg daily for 5 additional days (period 1-digoxin alone). Concurrent dosing with cerivastatin 0.2 mg continued for 14 days (period 2-digoxin and cerivastatin), followed by an 8-day course of digoxin-only administration and an optional 6-day extension of digoxin-only treatment for a total of 14 days (period 3). Safety was assessed through physical examination, electrocardiography, laboratory tests, and ophthalmologic examination. Ratio analyses of mean digoxin plasma trough levels, 24-hour urinary digoxin levels, and digoxin clearance with and without concurrent cerivastatin dosing also were carried out. In addition, single-dose pharmacokinetic variables for cerivastatin, including area under the curve (AUC(0-24)), peak concentration (C(max)), time to peak concentration (T(max)), and elimination half-life (t1/2), were examined with and without concurrent digoxin dosing. Eleven of the 20 subjects completed the entire study. Seven subjects discontinued the study because of treatment-emergent adverse events or laboratory abnormalities that were mostly unrelated to cerivastatin, and 2 subjects were discontinued because of protocol violations. Treatment-emergent adverse events developed in 12 subjects receiving cerivastatin; 11 of these subjects were receiving digoxin concurrently. Six adverse events that led to discontinuation of treatment were unrelated to cerivastatin but were related to digoxin or to a preexisting condition. The most commonly reported event was headache, which occurred with equal frequency compared with placebo groups in large cerivastatin clinical trials. Other events were mild or moderate and resolved without intervention. Mild and transient elevations in hepatic transaminase and creatine kinase values (all <2 times the upper limit of normal) were observed in 7 subjects. After 14 days of concurrent dosing of cerivastatin and digoxin, steady-state digoxin plasma levels, urinary digoxin levels, and urinary digoxin clearance were unchanged compared with steady-state digoxin levels when digoxin was given alone. Compared with dosing with digoxin alone, the AUC(0-24), Cmax, and t1/2 for cerivastatin increased 3%, 20%, and 7%, respectively, while the T(max) was reduced by 18% during concurrent treatment with digoxin. These changes are minimal and would not be expected to be clinically relevant. These results demonstrate that when cerivastatin is administered concurrently with digoxin, neither digoxin nor cerivastatin plasma levels are altered. The combination therapy was generally well tolerated.",

Nonaromatic bacterial polyketides are synthesised on modular polyketide synthase (PKS) multienzymes, in which each cycle of chain extension requires a different 'module' of enzymatic activities.

Fusion sites should be chosen either in the surface-accessible linker regions between enzymatic domains, as previously revealed, or just inside the conserved margins of domains. The interaction of an ACP domain with the adjacent KS domain, whether on the same polyketide or not, is of particular importance, both through conservation of appropriate protein-protein interactions, and through optimising molecular recognition of the altered polyketide chain in the key transfer of the acyl chain from the ACP of one module to the KS of the downstream module.", 
    "71": "In a prospective, randomized study of patients with acute manifestation of coronary heart disease and hypercholesterolemia (LDL cholesterol >/= 130 </= 250 mg/dl), we compared the effect of an early-initiated, intensified therapy to usual care antilipidemic therapy with respect to coronary lesions and clinical events. Patients were included immediately following acute myocardial infarction and/or PTCA because of severe/instable angina pectoris. The intensified therapy consisted of pravastatin 20-40 mg with addition of colestyramine and/or nicotinic acid, if necessary, to achieve an LDL cholesterol </= 130 mg/dl. In the control group, antilipidemic therapy was left up to the private physician. The group with intensified therapy consisted of 70 patients (LDL cholesterol 179 +/- 27 mg/dl, age 55 +/- 10 years, 81% males), the control group of 56 patients (LDL cholesterol 177 +/- 28 mg/dl, age 58 +/- 11 years, 79% males). Cholesterol was reduced longterm by 28% under intensified therapy, but it remained constant in the control group. Quantitative coronary angiography revealed a mean of increase minimal lumen diameter of 0.05 mm after 6 months with intensified therapy and of 0.13 mm after 24 months. Under conventional therapy, however, it decreased by 0.08 mm after 6 months, and by 0.18 mm after 24 months (p < 0.01). In addition, within 12 months of therapy, significantly (p < 0.01) less cardiovascular clinical events were observed in patients under intensified therapy. After 2 years 43% (n = 22) of the controls, but only 17% (n = 14) of the patients with intensified therapy experienced a major clinical event (p < 0.03), i. e. death, myocardial infarction, necessary coronary intervention, cerebral infarction or new peripheral vascular disease. This study is the first to show that aggressive early - initiated cholesterol-lowering therapy can induce regression and reduce progression of coronary lesions already after 6 months. These changes are accompanied by a significant reduction in clinical events. The results of our study underline the necessity of immediate cholesterol screening and early intensive antilipemic therapy at the latest when of coronary heart disease becomes manifest.", 
    "72": "L-90 cells were selected to grow in the presence of serum lipoproteins and 90 microM lovastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGR). L-90 cells massively accumulate HMGR, a result of >10-fold amplification of the gene and 40-fold rise in mRNA, and also overexpress other enzymes of the mevalonate pathway. Western blot and promoter-luciferase analyses indicate that transcriptional regulation of sterol-responsive genes by 25-hydroxycholesterol or mevalonate is normal. Yet, none of these genes is regulated by lipoproteins, a result of severe impairment in the low density lipoprotein receptor pathway. Moreover, L-90 cells do not accelerate the degradation of HMGR or transfected HMGal chimera in response to 25-hydroxycholesterol or mevalonate. This aberrant phenotype persists when cells are grown without lovastatin for up to 37 days. The inability to regulate HMGR degradation is not due to its overproduction since in LP-90 cells, which were selected for lovastatin resistance in lipoprotein-deficient serum, HMGR is overexpressed, yet its turnover is regulated normally. Also, the rapid degradation of transfected alpha subunit of T cell receptor is markedly retarded in L-90 cells. These results show that in addition to gene amplification and overexpression of cholesterogenic enzymes, statin resistance can follow loss of regulated HMGR degradation.", 
    "73": "This study examined the action of cerivastatin, a new statin, in subjects with primary hypercholesterolaemia. The effects of two oral doses of cerivastatin (400 micrograms/day or 300 micrograms/day) were compared with placebo in 349 patients using a multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study design. Cerivastatin treatment lasted 8 weeks and produced significant reductions in low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels from baseline compared with placebo. The reduction in LDL-C was significantly greater with 400 micrograms than with 300 micrograms cerivastatin. When responder rates were examined, the higher (400 micrograms/day) cerivastatin dose was found to be more effective in producing larger (> 40%) reductions in LDL-C levels. Cerivastatin treatment was well tolerated. Only two withdrawals due to adverse events during active treatment occurred, neither of which was considered to be due to the study medication. In addition, no clinically relevant increases in the levels of creatine phosphokinase and hepatic transaminases (alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase) compared with placebo were seen in this study. In conclusion, cerivastatin treatment produced a significant lowering of LDL-C levels, with the higher dose providing the greatest benefit.", 
    "74": "The biopharmaceutical properties of cerivastatin were evaluated in a series of worldwide clinico-pharmacological studies. Young healthy males aged 18-45 years were randomized to receive 0.05-0.8 mg cerivastatin orally, given either as single or multiple once-daily doses under fed or fasting conditions in the morning, with evening meal or at bedtime. Following administration, cerivastatin was rapidly and almost completely absorbed into the gastrointestinal tract (> 98%), with maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) reached at 2-3 h post dose. The plasma concentration/time profile of the tablet is similar to an aqueous oral solution (relative bioavailability is 100%). The dose-proportionality of cerivastatin (0.05-0.8 mg) in area under the curve and Cmax showed low intra- and interindividual variability. The effect of food (single-dose studies testing administration of cerivastatin with a high-fat meal and clinical investigations in patients) or time of administration (single- and multiple-dose once-daily/twice-daily studies) had no clinically relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics of cerivastatin. Marketed tablet strengths and drug formulations from different sources were found to be bioequivalent. Cerivastatin is a noncomplicated drug with respect to its biopharmaceutical profile and bioavailability.", 
    "75": "The 4S study was followed by guidelines for statin treatment of patients with manifest coronary heart disease recommending statins for patients with serum cholesterol above 5.5 mmol/l, age below 70 years, and more than three years life expectancy. The purpose of the present study was to investigate how these guidelines were implemented in clinical practice. A retrospective registration was conducted on two cohorts of patients; patients with myocardial infarction in 1994 (before 4S) (n = 101) and 1996 (n = 100). Risk factors for coronary diseases and the use of statins were registered from the patients records. No significant differences in risk factors between the two cohorts were observed. The proportion of patients given statins increased from 4% in 1994 to 40% in 1996, whereas 50% of patients with serum cholesterol above 5.5 mmol/l were given statins in 1996. Statin treatment was usually instituted during hospitalization. Awareness of actual prescription and handling of statin treatment, and adaption of knowledge from clinical studies to clinical practice is probably needed for further improvement of statin treatment.", 
    "76": "We demonstrated that naringenin (NRG), the aglycon form of naringin present in grapefruit juice inhibits in vitro the metabolism of simvastatin (SV), a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor. SV undergoes an important first pass metabolism and this is thought to be partly responsible for its low bioavailability after oral administration. SV is a prodrug that requires metabolic activation through hydrolysis by esterases. In addition, SV is a substrate for cytochrome P450 enzymes. NRG, a potent inhibitor of cytochrome P450 enzymes, interferes with the isoenzymes of cytochrome P450 involved in the hepatic metabolism of SV. NRG inhibits the metabolism of SV in rat hepatocytes (the intrinsic clearance of SV decreases from 26.2 microl/min/10(6) cells in absence of NRG to 4.15 microl/min/10(6) cells in presence of 50 microM NRG). This inhibition is more pronounced in hepatocytes (Ki value approximately 5 microM) than in liver microsomes (Ki approximately 23 microM and approximately 30 microM in human and rat liver microsomes respectively). Therefore, the hepatocytes seem to be the best approach for in vitro interaction study between SV and NRG ; and this should be taken into account in the in vitro/in vivo extrapolation. If this interaction were confirmed in man, the doses of SV should be reduced when co-administered with grapefruit juice because of increased bioavailability of SV.", 
    "77": "In this article, de novo cholesterol synthesis, its inhibition by HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and clinical pharmacology aspects of the statins have been reviewed. Statins are available in both active and pro-drug forms. Their affinity to bind and subsequently to inhibit HMG-CoA reductase activity is approximately 3 orders of magnitude higher than that of natural substrate (HMG-CoA). All members of this group of lipid-lowering agents are, to a varying degree, absorbed from the gut. However, their bioavailability depends on their lipophobicity and their concomitant use with meals. The interaction between HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and other lipid-lowering agents has been reviewed in more detail. One major side-effect of lipid-lowering combination therapy is myopathy with or without rhabdomyolysis. Combination of statins with gemfibrozil seems to increase risk of this adverse event, particularly in patients with renal impairment, more than combination with other lipid-lowering agents. Combination therapy with other agents including anticoagulants, antihypertensive, anti-inflammatory, oral hypoglycemic and antifungal agents as well as beta-blockers, H2 blockers, cyclosporine and digoxin has been also reviewed. The pleiotropic non-lipid lowering properties of statins and their effects on the quality of lipoprotein particles, the activities of cholesteryl ester transfer protein and lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase as well as their possible synergistic effects with n-3 fatty acids, phytosterols, vitamin E and aspirin in reducing cardiovascular events warrant further investigation.",

The study started with 3 months of Step-One diet (phase I) followed by 3 months of diet and hormone replacement therapy (0.625 mg conjugated estrogens daily combined with 5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate at days 13-25 of each cycle) (phase II). In women whose total cholesterol remained above 240 mg/dl or LDL-cholesterol above 160 mg/dl by the end of phase II, simvastatin at 10 mg daily was added (phase III). Plasma cholesterol levels as well as safety measurements were closely monitored.", 
    "80": "Sixteen (21%) of 75 patients who entered the study had satisfactory cholesterol levels by the end of 6 months. Another 25 patients (33%) dropped out of the study for various reasons by that time. In the 34 patients who started simvastatin, plasma total cholesterol levels did not significantly change during phase I and II, however, LDL-cholesterol significantly decreased (204 +/- 31 to 187 +/- 26 mg/dl, p = 0.04) and HDL increased (53 +/- 12 to 62 +/- 16 mg/dl, p = 0.04). A dramatic decrease occurred in both total and LDL-cholesterol levels after one month of phase III (281 +/- 26 to 213 +/- 30 mg/dl 187 +/- 26 to 122 +/- 30 mg/dl respectively, p < 0.0001), with no further changes during the rest of the study period. No significant changes occurred in HDL-cholesterol and triglyceride plasma levels at this phase. Adverse effects were few and minor throughout the study.", 
    "81": "Some of the hypercholesterolemic postmenopausal women will benefit from hormone replacement therapy as a single cholesterol lowering treatment in addition to diet (21% in our series). Nevertheless, combination therapy of estrogens and low dose simvastatin proved to be extremely effective in lowering cholesterol levels with no significant side effects. Such therapeutic regimen may also have a synergistic anti-atherogenic effect.", 
    "82": "In the last decade, the number of patients undergoing heart transplant has steadily increased as a result of expanding indications for this procedure. The limitation on the number of transplants performed has been the number of donor organs available. At UCLA, 900 heart transplant procedures have been performed from 1984-1998. Since 1991, the percent of patients free from rejection and infection in the first year after transplant was 70% and 73%, respectively. Actuarial one-, 3-, and 5-year survival rates are 84%, 76%, and 72%, respectively. Survival of patients aged 60 years and over (n = 105) was comparable to that of patients under age 60. We have been pursuing corticosteroid-free immunosuppression, which has led to a decrease in infection complications. Our work with pravastatin early after transplantation has led to a decrease in clinically severe rejection episodes, which has translated into improved survival. Pravastatin also appears to decrease the development of transplant coronary artery disease and appears to have an adjunct immunosuppressive effect in our heart transplant patients on CsA-based immunosuppression. We have also demonstrated benefit of cardiac rehabilitation early after transplant which should therefore be considered as standard postoperative care. Finally, we have participated and led the multicenter mycophenolate study in demonstrating this drug's effectiveness in improved outcomes in primary heart transplant recipients. Future studies include the use of Rapamycin and interleukin-2 receptor blockers which have been demonstrated in kidney transplantation to significantly reduce rejection. Our program is committed to seek better ways to improve outcome and the quality of life of our heart transplant patients.", 
    "83": "Cyclic AMP (cAMP) elevation affects growth arrest and differentiation in a wide variety of breast cell lines; however, the mechanisms associated with this process are poorly understood. Previous studies linked cAMP-mediated growth arrest in breast tumor cells to increased levels of cyclin kinase inhibitor (CKI), p21. In the present study we examined the role of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) on p21 and p27 induction in the breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-157. The induction of the CKIs by modulators of cAMP such as cholera toxin (CT) + 1-isobutyl-3-methylxanthine (IBMX) and lovastatin fluctuates with biphasic kinetics (although the kinetics of CKI induction with CT + IBMX treatment are different from that of lovastatin) and is depicted by the periodic accumulation of lower molecular weight forms of p21 and p27 which also correlate with fluctuations in CDK2 activity. Using three different approaches we show that the cAMP-mediated induction of CKIs is independent of PKA activity. In the first approach we treated MDA-MB-157 cells with a variety of cAMP modulators such as CT + IBMX, and forskolin in the presence or absence of H-89, a potent PKA inhibitor. This analysis revealed that the cAMP activators were capable of inducing p21 even though PKA activity was completely eliminated. In the second approach PKA dominant negative stable clones of MDA-MB-157 treated with CT + IBMX or forskolin also resulted in p21 induction, in the absence of any PKA activity. Last, treatment of MDA-MB-157 cells with lovastatin, another known cAMP modulator which also causes growth arrest, resulted in the induction of p21 and p27 without any increase in PKA activity. Collectively, the above results suggest that the induction of p21 by cAMP is through a novel pathway, independent of PKA activity.", 
    "84": "Lovastatin is a potent inhibitor of protein prenylation, and it has been reported to have pleiotropic cellular effects. In the present study we have elucidated the effects of lovastatin on cell cycle progression and apoptosis of normal human B-lymphocytes. When added to B-lymphocytes stimulated with anti-immunoglobulin (anti-mu) and SAC, lovastatin (20 microM) inhibited the cells in the late G1 phase of the cell cycle. Thus, no early activation parameters such as Ca(2+) flux or MYC induction were affected by lovastatin, whereas progression of cells into the second cell cycle as well as DNA synthesis was markedly reduced. We therefore examined the effects of lovastatin on components of the cell cycle machinery responsible for regulating the G1/S transition. We demonstrated that pRB phosphorylation, cdk2 activity needed for this phosphorylation, and the levels of cyclin A, D, and E were inhibited after 24 h of lovastatin treatment, while the levels of p27(Kip1) were elevated. There was no effect on p21(Cip1), cyclin D2, cdk4, and cdk6. These data are consistent with the cells being inhibited by lovastatin between 24 and 32 h into G1. Lovastatin added to stimulated B-cells in late G1 still inhibited the DNA synthesis by 60%, but at this point only minor effects were noted on the cell cycle machinery. We therefore looked for induced apoptosis as an explanation for reduced S-phase entry of the cells. However, despite the ability to enhance the apoptosis of unstimulated B-cells from 48 to 61% as judged by the TUNEL method, lovastatin only marginally affected apoptosis when administered to stimulated B-cells. Thus, it appears that accelerated apoptosis cannot account for the effect of lovastatin on cell cycle progression.", 
    "85": "The main effect of statins is the decrease of serum level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, due to the inhibition of intracellular cholesterol biosynthesis which brings about an upregulation of LDL receptors. A minor effect is the decrease of serum triglycerides. The present study was undertaken to verify whether all statins are effective in reducing serum triglycerides and whether their effect on triglycerides is related to the LDL cholesterol lowering activity.", 
    "86": "Of 197 hypercholesterolaemic patients on stable low-fat low-cholesterol diet, 49 were put on atorvastatin 10 mg per day, 48 on fluvastatin 40 mg per day, 50 on pravastatin 20 mg per day and 50 on simvastatin 10 mg per day.", 
    "87": "After 2 months, mean percentage change in serum triglycerides and LDL cholesterol resulted to be significantly different among the four treatment groups, whereas the ratio between the percentage decrease in serum triglycerides and that of LDL cholesterol (Deltatriglyceride/DeltaLDL cholesterol ratio) was not significantly different. Only baseline serum triglycerides resulted to be significantly associated with Deltatriglycerides/DeltaLDL cholesterol ratio. All statins are then effective in decreasing triglyceride levels.", 
    "88": "The lack of a significant difference in Deltatriglycerides/DeltaLDL cholesterol ratio among the treatment groups suggests that the more effective the statin is in decreasing LDL cholesterol, the more it will also be in decreasing serum triglycerides.", 
    "89": "Addition of the beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl-CoA (HmG-CoA) reductase inhibitor lovastatin to human HEK cells transfected with the amyloid precursor protein (APP) reduces intracellular cholesterol/protein ratios by 50%, and markedly inhibits beta-secretase cleavage of newly-synthesized APP. Exogenous water-solubilized cholesterol at 200 microg/ml concentration increases newly synthesized beta-amyloidogenic products four-fold. These intracellular changes are detectable by immunoprecipitation and immunofluorescent labelling. Analyses of the fragments captured from culture medium by an N-terminal anti-beta-amyloid antibody on ProteinChip arrays and detected using surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization (SELDI) mass spectrometry revealed that culture with cholesterol (200 microg/ml) increased secretion of beta-amyloid 1-40 by 1.8-fold, and increased secretion of beta-amyloid 1-42. Changes in APP processing by cholesterol may mediate the way in which the ApoE4 allele increases risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) in western populations.",

The development of rhabdomyolysis is increased when the HMG-CoAs are used concurrently with certain other medications, specifically gemfibrozil and macrolide antibiotics. In this report, we describe a patient with rhabdomyolysis from the combined use of lovastatin, gemfibrozil, and clarithromycin and review the relevant literature.", 
    "95": "Transforming growth factor-beta (TGFbeta) signaling has been shown to play a role in cardiac development as well as in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. Prior studies have suggested a relationship between cholesterol metabolism and TGFbeta signaling. Here we demonstrate that induction of the cholesterol metabolic pathway by growth of embryonic chicken atrial cells in medium supplemented with lipoprotein-depleted serum coordinately decreased the expression of the TGFbeta type II receptor (TGFbetaRII), TGFbeta(1), and TGFbeta signaling as measured by plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) promoter activity. Inhibition of the cholesterol metabolic pathway by the hydrophobic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMGCoA) reductase inhibitors, simvastatin and atorvastatin, reversed the effect of lipoprotein-depleted serum and up-regulated TGFbetaRII expression, whereas the hydrophilic HMGCoA reductase inhibitor, pravastatin, had no effect. Simvastatin stimulated the expression of TGFbetaRII, TGFbeta(1), and PAI-1 at the level of transcription. Experiments using specific inhibitors of different branches of the cholesterol metabolic pathway demonstrated that simvastatin exerted its effect on TGFbeta signaling by inhibition of the geranylgeranylation pathway. C3 exotoxin, which specifically inactivates geranylgeranylated Rho GTPases, mimicked the effect of simvastatin on PAI-1 promoter activity. Cotransfection of cells with a PAI-1 promoter-reporter and a dominant-negative RhoA mutant increased PAI-1 promoter activity, whereas cotransfection with a dominant-active RhoA mutant decreased PAI-1 promoter activity. These data support the conclusion that TGFbeta signaling is regulated by RhoA GTPase and demonstrate a relationship between cholesterol metabolism and TGFbeta signaling. Our data suggest that in patients treated with HMGCoA reductase inhibitors, these agents may exert effects independent of cholesterol lowering on TGFbeta signaling in the heart.",

NSAIDs are associated with reduced colon cancer incidence, predominantly by increasing apoptosis. We showed previously that lovastatin induces apoptosis in colon cancer cells. In the present study we evaluated the potential of combining lovastatin with sulindac for colon cancer chemoprevention.",

    "99": "More than decade ago, several cross-sectional studies have reported differences in LDL particle size, density and composition between coronary heart disease (CHD) patients and healthy controls. Three recent prospective, nested case-control studies have since confirmed that the presence of small, dense LDL particles was associated with more than a three-fold increase in the risk of CHD. The small, dense LDL phenotype rarely occurs as an isolated disorder. It is most frequently accompanied by hypertriglyceridemia, reduced HDL cholesterol levels, abdominal obesity, insulin resistance and by a series of other metabolic alterations predictive of an impaired endothelial function and increased susceptibility to thrombosis. Whether or not the small, dense LDL phenotype should be considered an independent CHD risk factor remains to be clearly established. The cluster of metabolic abnormalities associated with small, dense LDL particles has been referred to as the insulin resistance-dyslipidemic phenotype of abdominal obesity. Results from the Qu\u00e9bec Cardiovascular Study have indicated that individuals displaying three of the numerous features of insulin resistance (elevated plasma insulin and apolipoprotein B concentrations and small, dense LDL particles) showed a remarkable increase in CHD risk. Our data suggest that the increased risk of CHD associated with having small, dense LDL particles may be modulated to a significant extent by the presence/absence of insulin resistance, abdominal obesity and increased LDL particle concentration. We suggest that the complex interactions among the metabolic alterations of the insulin resistance syndrome should be considered when evaluating the risk of CHD associated with the small, dense LDL phenotype. From a therapeutic standpoint, the treatment of this condition should not only aim at reducing plasma triglyceride levels, but also at improving all features of the insulin resistance syndrome, for which body weight loss and mobilization of abdominal fat appear as key elements. Finally, interventions leading to reduction in fasting triglyceride levels will increase LDL particle size and contribute to reduce CHD risk, particularly if plasma apolipoprotein B concentration (as a surrogate of the number of atherogenic particles) is also reduced.", 
    "100": "Most described modifications of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol share an increase in its negative electric charge; in fact, an electronegative form of LDL can be identified and isolated from plasma. Although the exact nature of the chemical modification of electronegative LDL is still controversial, its toxicity on endothelial cells has been demonstrated. Statins have protective effects against cardiovascular disease that are independent of their lipid-lowering action and which could be due, at least in part, to the prevention of LDL modification. We evaluated the effect of 6 months of simvastatin therapy (40 mg/day) on electronegative LDL proportion and LDL susceptibility to in vitro induced oxidation in 21 patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Eleven normolipemic subjects were analyzed as a control group. Total cholesterol as well as LDL and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and apoprotein B decreased 30% after the first month of therapy, with no further decreases thereafter. LDL susceptibility to oxidation was similar in FH patients and controls and did not change throughout the treatment. Electronegative LDL proportion was 35.1 +/- 9.9% in FH patients and 9.1 +/- 2.4% in control subjects (p <0.0001) but, in contrast to total LDL cholesterol and the rest of lipid parameters, it decreased to 28.6 +/- 9.1% in the third month and to 21.2 +/- 7.7% in the sixth month of therapy. The decrease in these cytotoxic particles may be a relevant mechanism by which simvastatin protects against cardiovascular disease.", 
    "101": "Thrombotic risk in hyperlipidemic women and its response to lipid therapy is unknown. We prospectively studied 28 men and 29 women with high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol during 6 months of therapy with pravastatin. Women had significantly higher high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (54.2 +/- 1.7 vs 39.5 +/- 2.2 mg/dl, p <0.01), lower prevalence of coronary artery disease (41% vs 67%, p = 0.04), and otherwise similar baseline characteristics compared with men. Both genders achieved a 33% reduction in LDL at 6 weeks (188 +/- 6 to 133 +/- 5 mg/dl) and maintained similar LDL levels throughout the study. Systemic hemostatic markers and thrombus formation under dynamic flow conditions were evaluated at baseline, and at 3 and 6 months of follow-up. Prothrombin fragment F1.2, a marker of thrombin generation, was higher in women versus men at baseline (2.4 +/- 0.2 vs 1.4 +/- 0.3 nmol/L, p = 0.02). The levels decreased in women to 2.0 +/- 0.3 nmol/L at 3 months and to 1.6 +/- 0.2 nmol/L at 6 months (p <0.045, analysis of variance), whereas it remained unchanged in men. Plasminogen activator inhibitor-I significantly decreased at 3 and 6 months of follow-up: by 12.6% and 18.7%, respectively, in women, and by 18.8% and 23.5%, respectively, in men. Similarly, tissue plasminogen activator decreased significantly by 7.4% in women and 11.8% in men at 6 months compared with baseline. Fibrinogen showed an increase in both genders at follow-up. Thrombus formation was similar at baseline between the 2 genders, and decreased at 3 and 6 months compared with baseline by 12.5% and 29.5% in women, and by 18.6% and 19.4% in men (p <0.04 at 6 months vs baseline in both men and women). Other markers, including C-reactive protein, fibrinopeptide A, D-dimer, and factor VIIa, did not differ between genders and did not change with therapy. Thus, despite higher HDL, and lower incidence of coronary disease, women with high LDL had a comparable thrombotic and/or fibrinolytic profile to men and even evidence of increased thrombin generation at baseline. Blood thrombogenicity was reduced with pravastatin in both genders; in addition, thrombin generation was gradually reduced in women to a level similar to that of men by 6 months of follow-up.", 
    "102": "As we reported previously, both wortmannin and lovastatin inhibit the differentiation in 3T3-L1 cells when these drugs were applied during the insulin-induced cell differentiation. In the present study, 3T3-L1 cells were treated with wortmannin and simvastatin after the completion of the insulin-stimulation, and differentiation was found to be significantly decreased by these drugs. This suggests intracellular signaling pathways play roles in the differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells even after the completion of the insulin-stimulation and also suggests that not only the early phase (day 0 to day 2) but also the late phase (day 2 to day 4) of differentiation is important for the differentiation of the cells.", 
    "103": "Combined hyperlipidaemia, associating hypercholesterolaemia and hypertriglyceridaemia, is a common metabolic disorder with a prevalence of about 1/500. It has a genetic background, but its phenotype is triggered by various predisposing factors such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and alcohol consumption. Combined hyperlipidaemia is undoubtedly associated with an increased cardiovascular risk and thus deserves specific management. After diet failure, the first drug choice remains controversial. Indeed, fibrates are more active on hypertriglyceridaemia while statins are more active on hypercholesterolaemia (LDL subfraction). Both pharmacological classes have their advantages and disadvantages, and there is no prospective study comparing the cardiovascular protective efficacy of these two treatments in patients with such dyslipidemia. Furthermore, monotherapy is generally incapable of normalizing the lipid profile in the presence of severe combined hyperlipidaemia. Ideally, a statin-fibrate combination would be most appropriate in order to act on the two components of such hyperlipidaemia and to benefit of the complementary and additive action of the two pharmacological classes. Such association is still contra-indicated because of the description of some cases of rhabdomyolysis is high risk patients; however, it now deserves much interest and is currently being tested in large prospective studies, especially in the population with type 2 diabetes.", 
    "104": "The statin trials in secondary and primary prevention have shown that lowering LDL cholesterol produces a reduction in coronary event rates of around 35%. The most common dyslipidaemia in MI survivors is mixed hyperlipidaemia rather than hypercholesterolaemia. New evidence from VA-HIT and BIPS suggests that relatively low levels of triglyceride may be associated with a significant increase in coronary risk. In patients with established coronary disease, treatment with a fibrate that lowers triglyceride and raises HDL cholesterol, but which has little effect on LDL cholesterol, slows the rate of progression of coronary lesions. In hypertriglyceridaemic patients who have survived an MI or who have angina pectoris, fibrate treatment reduced the incidence of fatal and non-fatal MI by 40% (p = 0.03) (BIPS). In patients with coronary artery disease, who have low levels of HDL, fibrate treatment reduced the incidence of fatal and non-fatal MI by 22% (p = 0.006) (VA-HIT). These patients represent around 25% of the post-MI population. Work in progress will shortly define the effect of fibrate treatment on coronary event rate in patients with peripheral vascular disease and Type 2 diabetes.", 
    "105": "The lymphocyte function-associated antigen (LFA-1) belongs to the family of beta2-integrins and plays an important role in T-cell activation and leukocyte migration to sites of inflammation. We report here that lovastatin, a drug clinically used for lowering cholesterol levels, inhibits the interaction of human LFA-1 with its counter-receptor intercellular adhesion molecule-1. Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography we show that the inhibitor binds to a highly conserved domain of the LFA-1 alpha-chain called the I-domain. The first three-dimensional structure of an integrin inhibitor bound to its receptor reveals atomic details for a hitherto unknown mode of LFA-1 inhibition. It also sheds light into possible mechanisms of LFA-1 mediated signalling and will support the design of novel anti-adhesive and immunosuppressive drugs.", 
    "106": "The genetically hypercholesterolemic RICO rat: a good model for testing a food substance or a drug specific for a key enzyme involved in cholesterol metabolism? The genetically hypercholesterolemic RICO rat, whose cholesterolemia is situated between 1.3 and 1.5 mg x mL(-1), possibly reaching 2 mg x mL(-1), after the addition of cholesterol to its food, possesses a different lipoprotein spectrum than man, because approximatively 70% of the plasma cholesterol is carried by HDL (28% of which are carried by the light HDL1 subfraction, rich in apolipoproteinE (apoE). The effects of certain substances in food (carbohydrates, cholesterol, allyldisulfide, etc.) or drugs (ethinylestradiol, streptozotocin, statins, inhibitors of ACAT, etc.) on the cholesterolemia of the rat were studied, in relation to certain important parameters of cholesterol metabolism (LDLr, VLDL liver secretion, activities of lipolytic enzymes: LPL, HL, etc.). The increase in a number of LDL receptors (LDLr) in the RICO rat, induced by ethinylestradiol, streptozotocin, etc., provokes an important decrease in the apoE-rich HDL concentration, filtered out by its receptors. This decrease is observed in man for LDL. Simvastatin, which stimulates LDLr in man and not in rat, lowers the level of LDL in man and has no effect on the cholesterolemia of the RICO rat. In rat and man, the concentration of plasma cholesterol is inversely proportional to the rate of cholesterol synthesis in the organism and to its plasma turnover rate. The concentration of cholesterol in the plasma carried by the HDL1 of the rat, is however, proportional to hepatic cholesterogenesis. This fraction is positively correlated to the activity of hepatic lipase (HL) and negatively to the activity of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), released by heparin. These data demonstrate the importance of the liver and lipolytic enzymes in the intraplasmatic hydrolysis of HDL3 (precursors of HDL1), murine particles that can be considered similar to human LDL.", 
    "107": "Nifedipine, a hypertensive calcium channel blocker, is commonly administered to subjects with coronary heart disease who often exhibit hyperlipidemia. In general, the pharmacokinetic consequences of hyperlipidemia include increased total drug concentrations and decreased unbound fraction in plasma. However, the pharmacodynamic consequences of hyperlipidemia are conflicting; unaltered, increased, or decreased pharmacological effects are reported. In this study, the effect of experimental hyperlipidemia on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic consequences of nifedipine was studied. After establishing a dose (0.05-0.3 mg.kg(-1))-effect relationship, single 0.1 mg.kg(-1) i.v. doses of nifedipine were administered to control and poloxamer 407-induced hyperlipidemic (with and without cholesterol-lowering agent atorvastatin) rats. Mean arterial pressure, total as well as unbound nifedipine plasma concentrations, and total cholesterol were monitored. Hyperlipidemia significantly decreased systemic clearance of nifedipine by 40% and increased T(1/2) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve by 85 and 65%, respectively. Compared with the hyperlipidemic group, atorvastatin-treated rats had significantly lower total plasma cholesterol (0-70%), increased systemic clearance (39%), and decreased T(1/2) (27%) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (24%). Hyperlipidemia prolonged pharmacological T(1/2) of nifedipine by 300%. Atorvastatin treatment significantly reduced this prolongation to 46%. There was a significant correlation between mean blood pressure and the total but not unbound nifedipine plasma concentrations. Hyperlipidemia potentiates the hypotensive effect of nifedipine by increasing its total plasma concentrations despite decreased unbound drug concentration.", 
    "108": "We compared the intestinal metabolism of the structurally related 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors lovastatin and pravastatin in vitro. Human small intestinal microsomes metabolized lovastatin to its major metabolites 6'beta-hydroxy (apparent K(m) = 11.2 +/- 3.3 microM) and 6'-exomethylene (apparent K(m) = 22.7 +/- 9.0 microM) lovastatin. The apparent K(m) values were similar for lovastatin metabolism by human liver microsomes. 6'beta-Hydroxylovastatin formation by pig small intestinal microsomes was inhibited with the following inhibition K(i) values: cyclosporine, 3.3 +/- 1.2 microM; ketoconazole, 0.4 +/- 0.1 microM; and troleandomycin, 0.8 +/- 0.9 microM. K(i) values for 6'-exomethylene lovastatin were similar. Incubation of pravastatin with human small intestinal microsomes resulted in the generation of 3'alpha,5'beta, 6'beta-trihydroxypravastatin (apparent K(m) = 4560 +/- 1410 microM) and hydroxypravastatin (apparent K(m) = 5290 +/- 1740 microM). In addition, as in the liver, pravastatin was metabolized in the small intestine by sulfation and subsequent degradation to its main metabolite 3'alpha-iso-pravastatin. It was concluded that lovastatin is metabolized by cytochrome P-450 3A enzymes in the small intestine. Compared with lovastatin, the cytochrome P-450-dependent intestinal intrinsic clearance of pravastatin was >5000-fold lower and cannot be expected to significantly affect its oral bioavailability or to be a significant site of drug interactions.", 
    "109": "IL-2 deprivation triggers apoptosis in the murine T cell line TS1alphabeta, a process that can be blocked by overexpression of Bcl-2. Here we show that Bcl-2 and Ras proteins interact in mitochondria from TS1alphabeta cells in the presence or absence of IL-2, as evidenced by co-immunoprecipitation. All three Ras proteins, K-, N- and H-Ras, interact with Bcl-2; however, their mitochondrial localization is differentially regulated in IL-2-supplemented or -deprived cells. K-Ras is found in mitochondria only in IL-2-supplemented cells, whereas H-Ras is observed in mitochondria only after IL-2 withdrawal. N-Ras is detected in mitochondria under both experimental conditions. Bcl-2 transfection partially restored K- and N-Ras association with mitochondria in IL-2-deprived cells and rendered H-Ras association independent of IL-2 withdrawal. Inhibitors of Ras posttranslational processing did not alter the IL-2-induced differential pattern of mitochondrial localization. The processed forms of K- and N-Ras associated with mitochondria, although unprocessed H-Ras was also detected in mitochondria from mevastatin-treated cells. These results evidence a distinct behavior among the three Ras proteins in TS1alphabeta cells, depending on IL-2 supply, and suggest homologue-specific roles for Ras proteins in IL-2-dependent events.", 
    "110": "Long-term effects of pravastatin and probucol on serum cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) and xanthoma/xanthelasma size were compared. Twenty-three patients with primary hypercholesterolemia and xanthoma/xanthelasma, including 11 patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, were treated with pravastatin (20 mg/day) or probucol (1000 mg/day) for 24 months. Serum CETP levels were measured by sandwich ELISA. In 11 patients (six men and five women, 55 +/- 2 [SE] yr) treated with pravastatin, serum cholesterol levels decreased from 262 +/- 13 to 229 +/- 13 mg/dl during the 24-month treatment period (P = 0.05). Serum HDL cholesterol levels were not changed. Serum CETP levels decreased from 2.5 +/- 0.2 to 2.0 +/- 0.2 microg/ml (-21%, P = 0.002). By contrast, in 12 patients (four men and eight women, 57 +/- 4 year) treated with probucol, serum cholesterol levels did not significantly decrease from 236 +/- 11 to 207 +/- 13 mg/dl. Serum HDL cholesterol levels decreased from 44 +/- 2 to 30 +/- 2 mg/dl (P = 0.009). Serum CETP levels increased from 2.3 +/- 0.1 to 2.8 +/- 0.2 microg/ml (+23%, P = 0.02). Xanthelasma regression was found in two of four patients (50%) each treated with pravastatin and probucol, respectively. In contrast, Achilles' tendon xanthoma regressed in four of five patients (80%) treated with pravastatin, but only in two of five patients (40%) treated with probucol. Patients with xanthoma/xanthelasma regression after 2 years treatment had higher baseline levels of serum CETP than those without regression (2.7 +/- 0.2 microg/ml [n = 9] versus 2.1 +/- 0.2 microg/ml [n = 7], P = 0.05). Serial changes in serum CETP levels during treatment with pravastatin and probucol were discordant, but not related to the degree of xanthoma regression. However, higher level of serum HDL3 cholesterol was an independent factor in the smaller size of Achilles' tendon xanthoma at baseline. In addition, higher levels of serum HDL3 triglyceride on lipid-lowering therapy (6 months) appear to be a common predictor of regression of Achilles' tendon xanthoma in the treatment with either pravastatin or probucol.", 
    "111": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have been shown to be effective in primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. Their mechanism of action is attributed to their cholesterol lowering activity but recent results seem to indicate additional effects related to the modulation of other processes that regulate the presentation of vascular diseases. Our objective has been to study the effects of atorvastatin and simvastatin, two HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, on lesion composition and expression of genes involved in lesion development in a diet-induced atherosclerotic rabbit model. Both HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors were administered at identical doses of 2.5 mg/kg per day with the hyperlipemic diet for 10 weeks. Both statins significantly prevented the diet-induced increase in cholesterol levels. Relative lesion composition in fibrinogen, macrophages and smooth muscle cells was unaltered by the treatment although lesion size was reduced; therefore, both HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors reduced total amounts of fibrinogen, macrophages and smooth muscle cells (simvastatin, P < 0.05). NOS II gene expression was positively and significantly correlated with lesion size and inversely correlated with HDL plasma levels. NOS II expression was markedly downregulated in simvastatin treated animals while MCP-1 was unaltered. Therefore, HMG-CoA reductase inhibition seems to interfere with atherosclerotic lesion development by reducing intimal thickening development and the expression of the cytotoxic NOS II.", 
    "112": "The Cholesterol Lowering Atherosclerosis PTCA Trial (CLAPT) is a prospective, randomized trial with blinded angiographic end-points to assess the effect of 2-year's treatment with lovastatin initiated 4 weeks prior to PTCA, compared to usual care on non-dilated coronary segments and on dilated coronary lesions in male patients with total cholesterol between 200 and 300 mg. dl(-1)who underwent elective PTCA.", 
    "113": "Two hundred and twenty six patients were randomized 4 weeks prior to PTCA to special care (diet plus lovastatin n=112) or usual care (diet; n=114). One hundred and ninety-nine patients underwent PTCA at baseline and were finally included in the study. Quantitative coronary angiographic assessment was performed on blinded cinefilms at baseline (PTCA) and repeated after 4 and 24 months in 91% and 81% of the patients. The primary end-point was a change in the mean segment diameter of non-dilated segments. The mean lovastatin dose was 33 mg. day(-1). Total- and LDL-cholesterol decreased by 21% and 29% in the special care group and by 7% and 11% in the usual care patients. After 2 years, the mean segment diameter of non-dilated segments decreased by 0.03 mm in the usual care group and 0.004 mm in the special care group (P=0.27). The decrease in the mean segment diameter of dilated lesions was 0.17 mm (usual care) and 0.06 mm (special care) (P=0.04) after 4 months; 0.16 mm (usual care) and 0. 002 mm (special care) after 24 months, respectively (P=0.05). In both groups, the mean segment diameter of dilated lesions increased between 4 and 24 months after PTCA compared to a decrease in mean segment diameter of non-dilated segments (P<0.05). Restenosis (>50% diameter stenosis at follow-up) occurred in 28.4% of usual care and 22.2% of special care patients (P=0.17).", 
    "114": "Lovastatin reduced the progression of dilated lesions in men with elective PTCA. Independent of treatment allocation, the dilated lesions regressed and the non-dilated segments progressed during the study follow-up. Four weeks of pre-treatment with lovastatin did not influence the rate of restenosis. Lovastatin had no statistically significant effect on non-dilated segments.", 
    "115": "The effects of atorvastatin (Lipitor) were evaluated in 40 patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Following a 6 week drug-free baseline period 20 male and 20 female patients were treated with atorvastatin 40 mg once daily (QD) for the initial 6 weeks increasing to 80 mg QD during the following 6 weeks. Atorvastatin 40 and 80 mg resulted in a dose related reduction in LDL cholesterol of 44 and 50% (P<0.001), respectively. The reduction of triglycerides (TG) was 35% (P<0.001) with 40 and 80 mg atorvastatin. The lipoprotein lipase and the hepatic lipase activity decreased dose independently by 13% (P<0.05) and 18% (P<0.01), respectively. In males, a dose independent increase in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration was observed of 8%, (P<0.05). In females, the HDL cholesterol concentration did not change. Baseline LDL size in the females was significantly larger than in the males, being 268+/-6 A and 264+/-8 A (P<0.05), respectively. In males LDL size increased significantly from 264+/-8 A at baseline to269+/-6 A at 40 mg (P<0.05) and to 270+/-5 A (P<0.05) at 80 mg atorvastatin. In females LDL size did not change upon treatment with atorvastatin 40 and 80 mg QD. In conclusion, atorvastatin has the ability to decrease cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations as well as the activity of both lipoprotein and hepatic lipase activity. Additionally it has a favorable effect on LDL size and HDL cholesterol concentration in male, but not in female FH patients.", 
    "116": "The chronic toxicity of atorvastatin (AT), an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, was evaluated in beagle dogs. Dogs were treated with 0, 10, 40, or 120 mg/kg of AT daily. Treatment lengths were 52 wk, 52 wk followed by 12 wk without drug, or 104 wk. Decreases in cholesterol levels were dose related and stable throughout the treatment period. Increases in alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase were transient and dose related in severity at > or = 40 mg/kg. Two dogs administered 120 mg/kg of AT daily were sacrificed moribund during the first 9 wk of treatment. Hepatic lesions were reversible with or without continued treatment and dose related in severity and distribution. Hepatic microgranulomas and hepatocellular degeneration were seen at the 120-mg/kg dose in dogs sacrificed before 53 wk. Before 53 wk, hepatocellular lipofuscin deposits were increased in dogs given > or = 40 mg/kg of AT daily but were similar to controls after 12 wk without drug and after 104 wk of continuous treatment. Bile stasis occurred in dogs given > or = 40 mg/kg of AT daily at all time points but was less severe after reversal and at week 104 compared with week 52.", 
    "117": "The results of AFCAPS/TexCAPS provide strong evidence for the benefits of primary prevention through lipid-regulating treatment across the spectrum of clinical coronary events that are often the first manifestations of atherosclerotic disease. These results reinforce current NCEP guidelines and demonstrate the need for the inclusion of HDL-C in clinical evaluations. The clear benefit observed in AFCAPS/TexCAPS reinforces the need to implement treatment in all individuals with average LDL-C and low HDL-C who may be at risk for CHD. According to estimates based on phase-2 NHANES III data (1991-1994), only 1.4 million (6.6%) of 21.1 million American adults eligible for cholesterol-lowering drug therapy by NCEP guidelines were receiving such therapy, including 14% of those eligible in secondary prevention and 4% of those eligible in primary prevention. Of diet- or drug-eligible adults, 65% received no therapy of any kind. Undertreatment of dyslipidemia continues to be a problem today. These statistics suggest that physicians must improve their efforts to reverse the toll of atherosclerotic disease through risk factor management.", 
    "118": "Male Hartley guinea pigs were fed a hypercholesterolemic diet rich in lauric and myristic acids with 0, 10, or 20 mg/kg of simvastatin or atorvastatin for 21 days. Atorvastatin and simvastatin resulted in a lowering of plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in a dose-dependent manner by an average of 48 and 61% with 10 and 20 mg/kg, respectively. Both statins were equally effective in lowering plasma LDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B (apo-B) levels. Atorvastatin and simvastatin treatments yielded LDL particles that differed in composition from the control. Due to the relevance of LDL oxidation and cholesteryl ester transfer in plasma to the progression of atherosclerosis, these parameters were analyzed after statin treatment. Atorvastatin and simvastatin treatment decreased the susceptibility of LDL particles to oxidation by 95% as determined by the formation of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances. An 80% decrease in the transfer of cholesteryl ester between high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and the apo-B-containing lipoproteins was observed after simvastatin and atorvastatin treatment. In addition, statin effects on plasma LDL transport were studied. Simvastatin- and atorvastatin-treated guinea pigs exhibited 125 and 175% faster LDL fractional catabolic rates, respectively, compared with control animals. No change in LDL apo-B flux was induced by either treatment; however, LDL apo-B pool size was reduced after statin treatment. Hepatic microsomal free cholesterol was lower in the atorvastatin and simvastatin groups. However, only atorvastatin treatment resulted in an 80% decrease of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase activity (P < 0.001). In summary, atorvastatin and simvastatin had similar LDL cholesterol lowering properties, but these drugs modified LDL transport and hepatic cholesterol metabolism differently.",

In people with diabetes mellitus, initiate antihypertensive drug therapy if systolic BP is sustained >/=140 mm Hg or diastolic BP is sustained >/=90 mm Hg. In non-diabetic hypertensive people, optimal BP treatment targets are: systolic BP <140 mm Hg and diastolic BP <85 mm Hg. The minimum acceptable level of control (Audit Standard) recommended is <150/<90 mm Hg. Despite best practice, these levels will be difficult to achieve in some hypertensive people. In diabetic hypertensive people, optimal BP targets are; systolic BP <140 mm Hg and diastolic BP <80 mm Hg. The minimum acceptable level of control (Audit Standard) recommended is <140/<90 mm Hg. Despite best practice, these levels will be difficult to achieve in some people with diabetes and hypertension. In the absence of contraindications or compelling indications for other antihypertensive agents, low dose thiazide diuretics or beta-blockers are preferred as first-line therapy for the majority of hypertensive people. In the absence of compelling indications for beta-blockade, diuretics or long acting dihydropyridine calcium antagonists are preferred to beta-blockers in older subjects. Compelling indications and contraindications for all antihypertensive drug classes are specified. For most hypertensives, a combination of antihypertensive drugs will be required to achieve the recommended targets for blood pressure control. Other drugs that reduce cardiovascular risk must also be considered. These include aspirin for secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, and primary prevention in treated hypertensive subjects over the age of 50 years who have a 10-year CHD risk >/=15% and in whom blood pressure is controlled to the audit standard. In accordance with existing British recommendations, statin therapy is recommended for hypertensive people with a total cholesterol >/=5 mmol/L and established vascular disease, or 10-year CHD risk >/=30% estimated from the Joint British Societies CHD risk chart. Glycaemic control should also be optimised in diabetic subjects. Specific advice is given on the management of hypertension in specific patient groups, ie, the elderly, ethnic subgroups, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal disease and in women (pregnancy, oral contraceptive use and hormone replacement therapy).

    "120": "Cerivastatin sodium a synthetic and pure enantiomeric 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaril-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, is considered effective in the treatment of mild-to-moderate primary hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol < or = 220-259 mg/dL) at a daily dose of 0.15 mg. We compared the efficacy and tolerability of a dosage of 0.3 mg/d with those of a dosage of 0.15 mg/d in patients with severe primary hypercholesterolemia (serum total cholesterol > or = 260 mg/dL). After a minimum of 4 week's lead-in with placebo, 73 patients with severe primary hypercholesterolemia were randomly assigned to receive either 0.15 or 0.3 mg of cerivastatin sodium once daily after the evening meal for 12 weeks. In 58 patients, the same drug was continued at a flexible dosage for an additional 36 weeks or longer to assess the long-term efficacy and tolerability of cerivastatin sodium. During the 12-week treatment period, serum total cholesterol levels decreased significantly from baseline in both dosage groups, but the percentage reduction was significantly greater in the 0.3-mg group (range, 24.4% to 25.6%) than in the 0.15-mg group (range, 19.4% to 21.6%). The percentage reduction in levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoprotein B and the percentage increase in levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly greater in the 0.3-mg group than in the 0.15-mg group. When the results for the 0.3- and 0.15-mg groups were combined, the percentage of change in serum lipid levels at 48 weeks remained as stable as at 12 weeks. No serious adverse reactions were observed. We concluded that the higher dose of cerivastatin sodium was more effective than the lower dose, with comparable tolerability, in the treatment of patients with severe primary hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "121": "Atherosclerosis results from a multifactorial process. For that reason, primary prevention of cardiovascular diseases requires several measures that should exhibit antiatherogenic, antithrombotic, antioxidative and antihypertensive properties. Two types of therapeutic strategies can be individualized. Nutritional interventions are the first line measures for population wide primary prevention in subjects at low risk of developing atheroscleric diseases. In high risk individuals who have either one major risk factor (LDL cholesterol above 190 mg/dL) or several additional risk factors, dietary measures must be frequently combined with drug treatments. However, the cost-effectiveness ratio should be weighed prior to any treatment especially with statins. Dietary measures consist to reduce caloric intakes in overweight subjects, or more generally to adopt eating patterns which correspond to the following recommendations: (i) proteins = 15% of total calories; (ii) saturated and polyunsatured fats = 10% each; (iii) carbohydrates plus monounsaturated fats = 65%. Such dietary instructions permit individual dietary changes, just by adjusting the carbohydrates/monounsaturates balance, the sum of both nutrients remaining in all cases equal to two-thirds to total calories. Drug treatments are only indicated after secondary dietary failure. They are generally based on the use of statins since the efficacy of these treatments has been clearly established by such preventive trials as the WOSCOP Study, provided that the therapeutic interventions result in significant reduction of LDL cholesterol levels over several years. Antiplatelet agents (aspirin), antihypertensive therapies, antioxidant supplementations with vitamins E or C are also recommended in some individuals for completing the beneficial effects of the above mentioned measures.", 
    "122": "Growth factor-stimulated DNA synthesis in a variety of cell lines has been shown to be decreased after overnight (or longer) treatment with the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitors, the statins. Although this anti-mitogenic effect had been presumed to be the result of the impairment of Ras lipidation, a stable modification (T1/2 approximately 20 h), this study provides new data demonstrating that brief (approximately 1 h) pretreatment of rat vascular smooth muscle cells with 100 microM pravastatin before platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) stimulation results in attenuation of DNA synthesis through a Ras-independent mechanism. PDGF-BB-stimulated PDGF-beta receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, Ras activity, and mitogen-activated protein/extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity are unaffected by from 10 min to 1 h of pravastatin incubation, while Raf activity is markedly increased after 1 h of pravastatin. Phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase activity and phosphorylation of its downstream effector Akt are decreased after 1 h pravastatin incubation. Rho is stabilized by pravastatin, and ADP-ribosylation of Rho by C3 exoenzyme decreases PDGF-stimulated phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase activity, mimicking the effect of pravastatin on this signaling protein. Levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 are increased when cells were preincubated with pravastatin for 1 h and then exposed to PDGF, and apoptosis is induced by pravastatin incubation times as short as 1 to 4 h. Thus, short-term, high-dose pravastatin inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell growth and induces apoptosis independently of Ras, likely by means of the drug's effect on p27Kip1, mediated by Rho and/or phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase. This work demonstrates for the first time that the statins may be therapeutically useful when applied for short periods of time such that potential toxicity of long-term statin use (such as chronic Ras inhibition) may be avoided, suggesting future therapeutic directions for statin research.",

    "124": "Beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl coA reductase inhibitors (HRIs) inhibit isoprenylation of several members of the Ras superfamily of proteins and therefore have important cellular effects, including the reduction of proliferation and increasing apoptosis. Significant toxicity at high doses has precluded the use of HRIs as a monotherapy for cancers. We therefore studied whether combinations of the HRI lovastatin with standard chemotherapeutic agents would augment apoptosis in colon cancer cells. In the colon cancer cell lines SW480, HCT116, LoVo, and HT29, lovastatin induced apoptosis with differing sensitivity. Pretreatment with lovastatin significantly increased apoptosis induced by 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or cisplatin in all four cell lines. Lovastatin treatment resulted in decreased expression of the antiapoptotic protein bcl-2 and increased the expression of the proapoptotic protein bax. The addition of geranylgeranylpyrophospate (10 microM) prevented lovastatin-induced augmentation of 5-FU and cisplatin-induced apoptosis; mevalonate (100 microM) was partially effective, whereas cotreatment with farnesyl pyrophosphate (100 microM) had no effect. These data imply that lovastatin acts by inhibiting geranylgeranylation and not farnesylation of target protein(s). Our data suggest that lovastatin may potentially be combined with 5-FU or cisplatin as chemotherapy for colon cancers."
