Although the modest increase in the risk of new diabetes mellitus is outweighed by the reduction in cardiovascular events for statins, emerging biochemical and genetic links between lipid metabolism and glycemic control raise the prospect of a broader diabetogenic effect of lipid-lowering therapies. For the novel and powerful PCSK9-inhibitor class available evidence does not support a major glycaemic effect with the results of large scale trials awaited although preliminary genetic data does suggest a link. In contrast, there is clear evidence of a diabetogenic effect for the now outdated but well-studied niacin. For ezetimibe and fibrates, evidence is scarce but currently broadly unconcerning. For now, the glycemic effects of lipid-lowering therapies should have a limited influence on clinical decision-making. Further study in this topical area is needed.",

Statins, the competitive inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, display potent anticancer activity and reversal ability of multidrug resistance in a variety of tumor cells, which is believed to be due to their inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase. Here, we determined the role of the mevalonate pathway in \u03b3-tocotrienol-mediated reversal of multidrug resistance in cancer cells. We found both \u03b3-tocotrienol and atorvastatin effectively reversed multidrug resistance of MCF-7/Adr and markedly inhibited the intracellular levels of FPP and GGPP. Exogenous addition of mevalonate or FPP and GGPP almost completely prevented the reversal ability of atorvastatin but only partly attenuated the reversal effect of \u03b3-tocotrienol on doxorubicin resistance. In addition, \u03b3-tocotrienol actively inhibited the expression of P-gp and increased the accumulation of doxorubicin in cells, which led to the enhanced G2/M arrest and cell apoptosis. Taken together, \u03b3-tocotrienol reversed the multidrug resistance of MCF-7/Adr with a mechanism distinct from that of atorvastatin. Instead of the mevalonate pathway, the inhibition of P-gp expression is a potential mechanism by which \u03b3-tocotrienol reverses multidrug resistance in MCF-7/Adr.",

Knockdown of ANXA10 by siRNA increased the proliferation of PC-3 and LNCaP-LA cells. In a nude mouse xenograft model of PC-3 cells, simvastatin induced both reduction in the tumor size and up-regulation of ANXA10 expression. In human prostate biopsy samples, ANXA10 mRNA expression was significantly lower in the prostate cancer group than in the BPH group. Next, we found that up-regulation of ANXA10 in PC-3 resulted in down-regulation of S100 calcium binding protein A4 (S100A4), which is reportedly correlated with aggressiveness and a worse prognosis for patients with different types of carcinomas.

We describe the PK/PD relationship of evolocumab using a mathematical model that captures evolocumab binding and removal of unbound PCSK9 as well as reduction in circulating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Data were pooled from 2 clinical studies: a single-dose escalation study in healthy subjects (7-420\u00a0mg SC; n = 44) and a multiple-dose escalation study in statin-treated hypercholesterolemic patients (14 mg weekly to 420\u00a0mg monthly [QM] SC; n = 57). A TMDD model described the time course of unbound evolocumab concentrations and removal of unbound PCSK9. The estimated linear clearance and volume of evolocumab were 0.256 L/day and 2.66 L, respectively, consistent with other monoclonal antibodies. The time course of LDL-C reduction was described by an indirect response model with the elimination rate of LDL-C being modulated by unbound PCSK9. The concentration of unbound PCSK9 associated with half-maximal inhibition (IC50 ) of LDL-C elimination was 1.46 nM. Based on simulations, 140 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) and 420\u00a0mg QM were predicted to achieve a similar time-averaged effect of 69% reduction in LDL-C in patients on statin therapy, suggesting that an approximate 3-fold dose increase is required for a 2-fold extension in the dosing interval. Evolocumab dosing regimens of 140 mg Q2W or 420\u00a0mg QM were predicted to result in comparable reductions in LDL-C over a monthly period, consistent with results from recently completed phase 3 studies.", 
    "28": "Acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) is an aggressive antibody- and T-cell-mediated variant of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome (GBS), a prominent and debilitating autoimmune disorder of the peripheral nervous system. Despite advancements in clinical management, treatment of patients with AIDP/GBS and its chronic variant CIDP remains palliative and relies on the use of non-specific immunemodulating therapies. Our laboratory has previously reported that therapeutic administration of statins safely attenuates the clinical severity of experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN), a well-characterized animal model of AIDP/GBS, by restricting the migration of autoreactive leukocytes across peripheral nerve microvascular endoneurial endothelial cells that form the blood-nerve barrier. Despite these advancements, the clinical application of systemically administered statins for the management of inflammatory disorders remains controversial as a result of disappointingly inconclusive phase trials. Here, poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) nanoparticles were evaluated as an alternative strategy by which to locally administer statins for the management of EAN. When tested in\u00a0vitro, lovastatin-encapsulating PLGA nanoparticles elicited a marked increase in RhoB mRNA content in peripheral nerve microvascular endoneurial endothelial cells, similar to cells treated with activated unencapsulated lovastatin. Unilateral peri-neural administration of lovastatin-encapsulating PLGA nanoparticles, but not empty nanoparticles, to na\u00efve Lewis rats similarly enhanced RhoB mRNA content in adjacent nerve and muscle tissue. When administered in this manner, serum levels of lovastatin were below the level of detection. Bilateral peri-neural administration of lovastatin-encapsulating PLGA nanoparticles to EAN-induced Lewis rats significantly attenuated EAN clinical severity while protecting against EAN-induced peripheral nerve morphological and functional deficits. This study provides the first proof-of-concept approach for the application of a nanoparticle-based local drug delivery platform for the management of inflammatory demyelinating diseases, including AIDP/GBS.",

The observed pooled estimates were retained for cancer-specific mortality (HR 0.60, 95% Cl 0.47 to 0.77), progression-free survival (HR 0.67, 95% Cl 0.56 to 0.81), recurrence-free survial (HR 0.74, 95% Cl 0.65 to 0.83) and disease-free survival (HR 0.53, 95% Cl 0.40 to 0.72). These associations almost remained consistent across those outcomes when stratified by publication type, tumour location, study design, sample size, initiation of statins, disease stage, research country, follow-up duration or research hospital involved. Subgroup analyses according to initiation of statins showed postdiagnosis statin users (HR 0.65, 95% Cl 0.54 to 0.79) gained significantly more recurrence-free survival benefit than prediagnosis statin users (HR 0.86, 95% Cl 0.77 to 0.96) (p for interaction\u2009=\u20090.018). Statin therapy has potential survival benefit for patients with malignancy. Further large-scale prospective studies emphasising survival outcomes of individual cancer type are strongly encouraged.",

Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the baseline characteristics of the patients and to compare subjects with and without anti-HMGCR antibodies.Four (1.3%) subjects had anti-HMGCR antibodies. None of the subjects with anti-HMGCR antibodies titers had a history of an inflammatory myositis or overlap with polymyositis/dermatomyositis, compared to 8.6% and 2.0% of those without anti-HMGCR antibodies, respectively. In addition, none of the subjects with anti-HMGCR antibodies had past or current exposure to statins compared to 12% of those with negative titers.Anti-HMGCR antibodies are rare in SSc and are not associated with inflammatory myopathy or statin exposure. Larger studies will be required to confirm these preliminary observations. Nevertheless, we conclude that anti-HMGCR antibodies are unlikely to play a major role in inflammatory myopathy in SSc and anti-HMGCR antibodies can be present in subjects without exposure to statins.",

However, there is a suggestion in the literature that many patients are still initiated on statins based on raised cholesterol rather than a raised CVD risk. It is important, therefore, to investigate the role that lipid levels and CVD risks have in the decision to prescribe. This research will establish how cholesterol levels and CVD risk independently influence the prescribing of statins for the primary prevention of CVD in primary care.",

From this resource, a historical cohort will be created of patients without a diagnosis of CVD, not currently receiving a prescription for statins and who had a lipid profile measured. A post hoc QRISK2 score will be calculated for these patients and they will be followed up for 60\u2005days to establish whether they were subsequently prescribed a statin. Primary analysis will consist of predictive modelling using multivariate logistic regression with potential predictors including cholesterol level, calculated QRISK2 score, sociodemographic characteristic and comorbidities. Descriptive statistics will be used to identify trends in prescribing and further secondary analysis will explore what other factors may have influenced the prescribing of statins and the degree of interprescriber variability.",

    "61": "Preapproval clinical trials examining the safety and efficacy of rosuvastatin demonstrated an increased incidence of proteinuria, hematuria, rhabdomyolysis, and other acute kidney injury of unknown cause at high doses. The latter cases manifested with urine sediment findings and in some cases, renal histology, indicating renal tubular injury in the absence of rhabdomyolysis. Despite these provocative findings, there have been very few reports in the literature regarding non-rhabdomyolysis-mediated acute kidney injury associated with high-dose rosuvastatin since its widespread introduction more than a decade ago, suggesting that it is either a rare entity or systematically underdiagnosed and under-reported. We present a case of renal tubular toxicity attributable to the initiation of rosuvastatin treatment at a dose of 40mg in a patient with no prior evidence of kidney disease. Tubular toxicity should be considered in cases of unexplained kidney injury in the setting of exposure to a potent statin such as rosuvastatin, particularly at high dose. The limited evidence suggests a good kidney prognosis following withdrawal of the agent in these cases.", 
    "62": "Response to drug administration is a primary determinant for treatment success. Sex and gender disparities play a role in determining the efficacy and safety of the most common used medications suggesting the need for a sex-tailored approach in prescription. Statins are a cost-effective strategy for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. While statins are similarly effective in secondary CVD prevention, some concerns raised by conflicting data reported in primary CVD prevention clinical trials. The small representation of women in clinical trials and the fewer rates of events due to the lower female baseline CVD risk may have conditioned contradictory meta-analysis findings. Specifically, benefits outweigh disadvantages of statin therapy in women with a high CVD risk, while several doubts exist for the primary prevention of women at low-intermediate CVD risk. Furthermore, disparities between women and men in medication adherence may influence statin efficacy in CVD prevention. The sex-dependent impact of adverse side effects is one of the reasons advocated for explaining the gender gap, but it's not evidence-proved. The present review summarizes the sex and gender differences in the use of statins, pointing out new perspectives and opening issues in sex-tailored CVD prevention strategy.",

Scenario 3 would result in the greatest reduction in MIs and CHD deaths, with 3400 fewer MIs and 1400 fewer CHD deaths every year, which translates to a 7\u00a0% and 6\u00a0% reduction, respectively.

However, the underlying mechanisms of this protective effect remain unclear. Therefore, our study investigated the role of the glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3\u03b2-protein phosphatase 2A(PP2A)-NF-\u03baB signaling pathway in the anti-apoptotic and cardioprotective effects of ATOR on cardiomyocytes cultured in high glucose (HG) and in DCM. Our results showed that, in HG-cultured cardiomyocytes, phosphorylation of GSK-3\u03b2 was decreased, while that of the PP2A catalytic subunit C (PP2Ac) and IKK/I\u043aB\u03b1 was increased, followed by NF-\u043aB nuclear translocation and apoptosis. IKK/I\u043aB\u03b1 phosphorylation and NF-\u043aB nuclear translocation were also increased by treatment of cells with okadaic acid (OA), a selective PP2A inhibitor, or by silencing PP2Ac expression. The opposite results were obtained by silencing GSK-3\u03b2 expression, which resulted in PP2Ac activation. Furthermore, IKK/I\u043aB\u03b1 phosphorylation and NF-\u043aB nuclear translocation were markedly inhibited and apoptosis attenuated in cells treated with ATOR. These effects occurred through inactivation of GSK-3\u03b2 and subsequent activation of PP2Ac. They were abolished by treatment of cells with OA or PP2Ac siRNA. In mice with type 1 diabetes mellitus, treatment with ATOR, at 10 mg-kg-1-d-1, significantly suppressed GSK-3\u03b2 activation, IKK/I\u043aB\u03b1 phosphorylation, NF-\u043aB nuclear translocation and caspase-3 activation, while also activating PP2Ac. Finally, improvements in histological abnormalities, fibrosis, apoptosis and cardiac dysfunction were observed in diabetic mice treated with ATOR. These findings demonstrated that ATOR protected against HG-induced apoptosis in cardiomyocytes and alleviated experimental DCM by regulating the GSK-3\u03b2-PP2A-NF-\u03baB signaling pathway.",

We judged the risks of selection and performance bias to be low; risks of detection bias, attrition bias, and reporting bias were unclear. Reporting of adverse effects by included trials was very limited; that is why we used discontinuation of therapy due to adverse effects as a proxy for adverse effects. Patients treated with fibrates had a reduced risk for the combined primary outcome of CVD death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke compared to patients on placebo (risk ratio (RR) 0.84, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 0.96; participants = 16,135; studies = 6; moderate-quality of evidence).

The appraisal assessed evolocumab as monotherapy or in combination with a statin (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor) with or without ezetimibe, or in combination with ezetimibe (without statin therapy), in adult patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia (which includes mixed dyslipidaemia), for whom statins do not provide optimal control of their low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels and/or for whom statins are contraindicated or not tolerated. The School of Health and Related Research Technology Appraisal Group at the University of Sheffield was commissioned to act as the independent Evidence Review Group (ERG). The ERG produced a critical review of the evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of the technology, based on the company's submission to NICE. The evidence was derived mainly from four randomised controlled trials comparing evolocumab either with ezetimibe or placebo in adults with primary familial or non-familial hypercholesterolaemia, who were either able to take statins or who were statin-intolerant. The clinical effectiveness review found that evolocumab is efficacious at lowering LDL-C but that there was uncertainty regarding its impact on cardiovascular disease outcomes. In response to the ERG's critique of the submitted health economic model, the company submitted an amended model, which also included a Patient Access Scheme (PAS). Based on this, the deterministic incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for evolocumab against ezetimibe were above \u00a374,000 and \u00a345,000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained within the non-familial primary and secondary prevention population, respectively, whilst the ICERs within the heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia population were approximately \u00a323,000 per QALY gained. The final determination was that evolocumab would be a clinically and cost effective use of UK National Health Service resources in certain patient subgroups.",

In August 2016 the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) issued new joint guidelines for the management of dyslipidaemias. In these new guidelines, the concept of treating patients to a\u00a0risk-based low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol target is reinforced. The task force considers LDL cholesterol as the primary target for dyslipidaemia treatment, whereas high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol is not recommended as a\u00a0treatment target (based on the failure of HDL cholesterol elevation treatment strategies to reduce cardiovascular risk in recent studies). In patients with a\u00a0very high risk for cardiovascular events it is recommended to treat to an\u00a0LDL cholesterol target of less than 70\u00a0mg/dl. Moreover, the new guidelines now additionally recommend a\u00a0> 50% reduction of LDL cholesterol in patients with very high cardiovascular risk patients and baseline levels between 70 and 135\u00a0mg/dl as well as in patients with high cardiovascular risk and baseline LDL cholesterol levels between 100 and 200\u00a0mg/dl. Statins are recommended as first-line medicinal treatment and the LDL cholesterol goals given imply the more frequent use of maximum tolerated statin therapy, in particular for patients with very high cardiovascular risk. Treatment with ezetimibe in patients with substantially elevated LDL cholesterol levels despite maximum tolerated statin therapy has now received a\u00a0stronger recommendation (currently IIa recommendation). The guidelines also now include the potential use of the novel proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors and a\u00a0recent ESC/EAS consensus document provides more detailed information on which patients can be considered for treatment with PCSK9 inhibitors, i.\u2009e. in particular patients with familial hypercholesterolemia and patients at very high cardiovascular risk who have markedly elevated LDL cholesterol levels despite maximum tolerated statin and ezetimibe therapy.",

A successful strategy to improve chemopreventive efficacies is by down-regulating tumor polyamines and enhancing NK cell activities. Colonic carcinogenesis was induced by azoxymethane (AOM) in male F344 rats. Eight weeks after AOM treatment, animals were fed diets containing Rosuvastatin and difluromethylornithine (DFMO) individually and in combination for 40 weeks. Both agents showed significant suppression of adenocarcinoma multiplicity and incidence with no toxicity compared to untreated rats. Low-dose Rosuvastatin plus DFMO suppressed colon adenocarcinoma multiplicity by 76% compared to low-dose Rosuvastatin (29%) and DFMO (46%), suggesting additive efficacy. Furthermore, low-dose combination caused a delay in colonic adenocarcinoma progression. DFMO, Rosuvastatin and/or combinations significantly decreased polyamine content and increased intra-tumoral NK cells expressing perforin plus IFN-\u03b3 compared to untreated colon tumors. Further ex-vivo analysis of splenic NK cells exposed to DFMO, Rosuvastatin or combination resulted in an increase of NKs with perforin expression. This is the first report on Rosuvastatin alone or combination strategy using clinically relevant statin plus DFMO doses which shows a significant suppression of colon adenocarcinomas, and their potential in increasing functional NK cells. This strategy has potential for further testing in high risk individuals for colon cancer.",

With increasing of life expectancy and the chronicity of HIV infection, cardiovascular disease has emerged as an important cause of morbidity and mortality in HIV patients. In developed countries, the most common cardiovascular manifestation of HIV is ischemic heart disease. Currently, it is not uncommon to find HIV patients with acute coronary syndrome and, given the important pharmacokinetic interactions of antiretroviral drugs, it is important to know which cardiovascular treatments are safe in this group of patients. The ideal approach would be to mitigate the cardiovascular risk in HIV patients with specific primary prevention measures.

HoFH may cause very premature atheromatous arterial disease and death, despite treatment with Lp apheresis combined with statin, ezetimibe and bile acid sequestrants. Two new classes of drug, effective in lowering cholesterol in HoFH, are now licensed in the United Kingdom. Lomitapide is restricted to use in HoFH but, may cause fatty liver and is very expensive. PCSK9 inhibitors are quite effective in receptor defective HoFH, are safe and are less expensive. Lower treatment targets for lipid lowering in HoFH, in line with those for the general FH population, have been proposed to improve cardiovascular outcomes. HEART UK presents a strategy combining Lp apheresis with pharmacological treatment to achieve these targets in the United Kingdom (UK). Improved provision of Lp apheresis by use of existing infrastructure for extracorporeal treatments such as renal dialysis is promoted. The clinical management of adults and children with HoFH including advice on pregnancy and contraception are addressed. A premise of the HEART UK strategy is that the risk of early use of drug treatments beyond their licensed age restriction may be balanced against risks of liver transplantation or ineffective treatment in severely affected patients.

Recently, one national regulatory authority has mandated a change to the labeling of one PPI based on reports of possible associated rhabdomyolysis. Thus, in this review we summarize the available evidence linking PPI use with rhabdomyolysis. The level of evidence is insufficient to establish a causal relationship and is largely based on sporadic case reports. In general, patients with suspected PPI-associated rhabdomyolysis have not been re-challenged with a PPI after recovery. The mechanism whereby PPIs might have been associated with rhabdomyolysis is unclear but possibly related to interaction with concomitantly administered drugs such as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). For patients with rhabdomyolysis, a careful search must be made for possible etiological factors. In patients who recover from an episode of possible PPI-related rhabdomyolysis but do not have a genuine requirement for PPI treatment, the PPI should not be re-introduced. For those with a definite indication for ongoing PPI treatment, the PPI can be re-introduced but should preferably not be administered with a statin.",

    "157": "To reach for these aims, 3D model of glioma in fibrin gel was used with different concentrations of atorvastatin (1, 5, 10\u03bcM) to assay apoptotic genes expression by real time PCR and Tunel assay. After 24 and 48h exposing with different concentrations of atorvastatin, cell migration and invasion of tumor cells were investigated.", 
    "158": "The results showed atorvastatin induced apoptosis of glioma spheroids dose- dependently. The most likely mechanisms are the induction of apoptosis by caspase-8- caspase-3 signaling pathway. The invasion and migration of U87 spheroid cells decreased after 48h especially with 10\u03bcM concentration of atorvastatin.", 
    "159": "Finally these results suggest that this biomimetic model with fibrin may provide a vastly applicable 3D culture system to study the effect of anti-cancer drugs such as atrovastatin on tumor malignancy in vitro and in vivo and atorvastatin could be used as anticancer agent for glioblastoma treatment.", 
    "160": "The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effects of berberine (BBR) on olanzapine (OLZ)-induced adipogenesis in a well-replicated 3T3-L1 cell model. Oil-Red-O (ORO) staining showed that BBR significantly decreased OLZ-induced adipogenesis. Co-treatment with OLZ and BBR decreased the accumulation of triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) by 55.58% \u00b1 3.65% and 49.84% \u00b1 8.31%, respectively, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes accompanied by reduced expression of Sterol regulatory element binding proteins 1 (SREBP1), fatty acid synthase (FAS), peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR\u03b3), SREBP2, low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), and hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) genes compared with OLZ alone. Consistently, the co-treatment downregulated protein levels of SREBP1, SREBP2, and LDLR by 57.71% \u00b1 9.42%, 73.05% \u00b1 11.82%, and 59.46% \u00b1 9.91%, respectively. In addition, co-treatment reversed the phosphorylation level of AMP-activated protein kinase-\u03b1 (AMPK\u03b1), which was reduced by OLZ, determined via the ratio of pAMPK\u03b1:AMPK\u03b1 (94.1%) compared with OLZ alone. The results showed that BBR may prevent lipid metabolism disorders caused by OLZ by reversing the degree of SREBP pathway upregulated and the phosphorylation of AMPK\u03b1 downregulated. Collectively, these results indicated that BBR could be used as a potential adjuvant to prevent dyslipidemia and obesity caused by the use of second-generation antipsychotic medication.",

Impaired memory and executive function are common findings in sepsis survivors. Although neuroinflammation and blood-brain barrier dysfunction have been associated with acute brain dysfunction and its consequences, no specific treatments are available that prevent cognitive impairment after sepsis. Experimental sepsis was induced in Swiss Webster mice by intraperitoneal injection of cecal material (5mg/kg, 500\u03bcL). Control groups (n=5/group each experiment) received 500\u03bcL of saline. Support therapy recover (saline 0.9%, 1mL and imipenem 30mg/kg) were applied (6, 24 and 48h post injection, n=5-10/group, each experiment), together or not with additive orally treatment with statins (atorvastatin/simvastatin 20mg/kg b.w.). Survival rate was monitored at 6, 24 and 48h. In a setting of experiments, animals were euthanized at 6 and 24h after induction for biochemical, immunohistochemistry and intravital analysis. Statins did not prevented mortality in septic mice, however survivors presented lower clinical score. At another setting of experiments, after 15days, mice survivors from fecal supernatant peritoneal sepsis presented cognitive dysfunction for contextual hippocampal and aversive amygdala-dependent memories, which was prevented by atorvastatin/simvastatin treatment. Systemic and brain tissue levels of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines and activation of microglial were lower in septic mice treated with statins. Brain lipid peroxidation and myeloperoxidase levels were also reduced by statins treatment. Intravital examination of the brain vessels of septic animals revealed decreased functional capillary density and increased rolling and adhesion of leukocytes, and blood flow impairment, which were reversed by treatment with statins. In addition, treatment with statins restored the cholinergic vasodilator response due to sepsis. Taken together, these data demonstrated that statins reverse microvascular dysfunction and reduce neuroinflammation during sepsis, preventing the development of long-term cognitive decline.", 
    "166": "We evaluated the effects of simvastatin and antiandrogen enzalutamide on growth and androgen signaling in androgen-sensitive LNCaP and VCaP prostate cancer cells. Simvastatin alone abolished androgen-induced growth in both cell lines but decreased androgen receptor (AR) and prostate-specific antigen protein expression only in LNCaP, indicating that statin-induced growth inhibition is beyond AR transcriptional activity in VCaP. Combination of simvastatin and enzalutamide exerted additive growth inhibition in both cell lines accompanied with strong induction of autophagy in LNCaP. The data provide new insight into statins' effects on androgen signaling and their proposed role in enhancing androgen deprivation therapy in prostate cancer.",

The error-prone PCR and site-directed saturation mutagenesis libraries of aldolase LbDERA were constructed and screened using the high-throughput method. Two improved variants, LbDERAT29L and LbDERAF163Y, were identified and combined, giving a double mutant LbDERAT29L/F163Y which showed 7-fold higher activity than the native enzyme. The crystal structure of LbDERAT29L/163Y obtained by X-ray diffraction with 1.77\u00a0\u00c5 resolution revealed the structural changes responsible for the significant activity improvement.",

Currently, there are different alternatives available (amongst which statins occupy a pre-eminent place), to optimise the treatment of patients at high or very high cardiovascular risk. Despite this, the percentage of patients that achieve good lipid control is low. The causes of the mismatch with proposed objectives include lack of patient adherence and therapeutic inertia. This review uses available evidence and the latest clinical guides as a basis to assess the pharmacological treatment of dyslipaemia in patients with a background of arteriosclerotic vascular disease, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular risk at \u22655% calculated by SCORE and familial hypercholesterolaemia. The treatment of hypertriglyceridemia is also reviewed along with the special consideration that poly-pharmacy deserves in patients treated with statins, making mention of the treatment of dyslipaemia with HIV infection. The global assessment of cardiovascular risk is of high priority to adapt treatment to the specific objectives of the c-LDL for each risk category.", 
    "173": "Different pharmacological interventions have been applied with success to reduce the progression of atherosclerosis. However, many patients are not good responders or must interrupt treatment due to adverse effects. Bioactive compounds such as omega-3 fatty acids (n-3 FA), plant sterol esters (PSE) and phenolic compounds (PHC) are natural molecules with great potential to reduce the atherosclerosis burden by reducing inflammation, LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) and oxidative stress, respectively. Although their physiological effects on biomarkers are much lower than those expected by drugs used for the same purpose, bioactive compounds can easily be incorporated into the daily diet and present no adverse effects. However, little is known about the combination of n-3 FA, PSE, PHC, and drugs in atherosclerosis progression. This review article summarizes potential effects of co-therapies involving n-3 FA, PSE, and PHC combined with major hypolipidemic drugs on atherosclerosis biomarkers and clinical outcomes. Evidence of additive and/or complementary effects regarding drugs action reveals possible roles for bioactive compounds in disease management. Pharmaceutical companies, physicians, and food scientists should be prepared to better understand this type of interaction and its consequences in terms of efficacy and life quality.",

After treatment, serum lipid profiles, atherosclerotic lesions, and hepatic lipid content and inflammation were determined. NXT moderately increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, although had little effect on atorvastatin-induced reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Both NXT and atorvastatin reduced en face lesions and sinus lesions of aortic root. In addition, NXT enhanced atorvastatin-induced lesion plaque stability by increasing smooth muscle cell/collagen content and reducing macrophage accumulation and calcification in lesion areas. The co-treatment of NXT and atorvastatin further reduced hepatic triglyceride levels by downregulating acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 while activating hormone-sensitive lipase, adipose triglyceride lipase, and comparative gene identification-58 expression. The AMPK\u03b1 pathway was also further activated by the co-treatment. More importantly, the liver injuries caused by atorvastatin, such as hepatic inflammation and elevated serum aminotransferase activities, were substantially attenuated by NXT. Therefore, our study demonstrates that NXT enhances atorvastatin-induced plaque stability and ameliorates atorvastatin-induced hepatic side effects.",

Areas covered: We searched for reports of drug induced liver injury, both idiosyncratic and intrinsic, in patients with chronic liver disease including non-alcoholic and alcoholic liver disease, and cirrhosis. Reports we analyzed include statin treatment in patients with fatty liver, acetaminophen use in alcoholic fatty liver, antituberculous drugs in patients with tuberculosis and viral hepatitis, antiviral medications in hepatitis and antiretroviral medications in HIV/AIDS. The most challenging cases we found are drug therapy in patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis. Expert opinion: We identified many case reports and case series discussing a potential increased risk of DILI in patients with pre-existing liver disease. However, most of these reports were retrospective and ambiguous. With few exceptions, we conclude that drugs seem to be well tolerated by the majority of patients with pre-existing, non-cirrhotic chronic liver diseases. Special care is needed for some therapies, however, including antiviral therapy in chronic hepatitis B and C and in decompensated liver cirrhosis with impaired drug metabolism.

With regard to OM3FAs, the JELIS study showed that eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) significantly reduced major coronary events in statin-treated hypercholesterolemic patients. Regarding other agents, extended-release niacin and fenofibrate are no longer recommended as statin add-on therapy (by some guidelines, though not all) because of the lack of convincing evidence from outcome studies. Notably, subgroup analyses from the outcome studies have generated the hypothesis that triglyceride lowering may provide benefit in statin-treated patients with persistent hypertriglyceridemia.

Current formulations contain blood pressure-lowering drugs and others, such statins or acetylsalicylic acid. These drugs exhibit different physical chemical features, and consequently different release kinetics. Therefore, the concentration in plasma of some of them after the release process can be out of the therapeutic range. This paper investigates a new methodology for the control dosage of a polypill recently reported containing hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, losartan and simvastatin in a 12.5/2.5/25/40 weight ratio. The procedure is based on mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSN) with MCM-41 structure (MSN-41) used as carrier, aimed to control release of the four drugs included in the polypill. In vitro release data were obtained by HPLC and the curves adjusted with a kinetic model. To explain the release results, a molecular model was built to determine the drug-matrix interactions, and quantum mechanical calculations were performed to obtain the electrostatic properties of each drug. Amlodipine, losartan and simvastatin were released from the polypill-MSN-41 system in a controlled way. This would be a favourable behavior when used clinically because avoid too quick pressure decrease. However, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was quickly released from our system in the first minutes, as is needed in hypertensive urgencies. In addition, an increase in the stability of amlodipine and hydrochlorothiazide occurred in the polypill-MSN-41 system. Therefore, the new way of polypill dosage proposed can result in a safer and effective treatment.", 
    "250": "Volume-activated Cl(-) channels (VACCs) can be activated by hypotonic solutions and have been identified in many cell types. Here, we investigated the effects of different statins on VACCs in monocytes. Whole-cell patch clamp recordings demonstrated that a hypotonic solution induced 5-nitro-2- (3-phenylpropylamino) benzoic acid (NPPB)- and 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2, 2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS)-sensitive VACC currents in human peripheral monocytes and RAW 264.7\u00a0cells. The VACC currents were inhibited by the lipophilic statin (simvastatin) but not by the hydrophilic simvastatin acid and pravastatin. A low-molecular-weight superoxide anion scavenger (tiron, 1\u00a0mM) and inhibitor of NADPH oxidase (DPI 10\u00a0\u03bcM) was able to abolish the VACC currents. A hypotonic solution increased the reactive oxygen species (ROS) detected by the fluorescence of dichlorodihydrofluorescein (DCF), which was abolished by tiron and DPI. NPPB, DIDS, and simvastatin but not pravastatin decreased the fluorescence of DCF. Simvastatin could not further decrease VACC currents when pretreated with tiron or DPI, whereas exogenous H2O2 (100\u00a0\u03bcM), increased the VACC currents and overcame the blockade of VACC currents by simvastatin. Functionally, hypotonic solution increased the TNF-\u03b1 mRNA expression, which could be decreased by tiron, DPI, NPPB, DIDS and simvastatin but not pravastatin. However, simvastatin could not decrease the TNF-\u03b1 expression further when pretreatment with tiron, DPI, NPPB or DIDS. We conclude that lipophilic (simvastatin) rather than hydrophilic statin inhibit VACCs and decrease hyposmolality induced inflammation in monocytes by inhibiting NADPH oxidase."
