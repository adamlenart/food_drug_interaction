    "14": "We found that curcumin enhanced LDL receptor (LDLR) level on the cell surface, as well as LDLR activity; however, LDLR transcription and mRNA stability were not affected. Furthermore, we found that proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) gene was downregulated at the transcriptional level by curcumin, leading to an increase in LDL uptake in HepG2 cells. The curcumin-responsive element of the PCSK9 promoter, a binding site for hepatocyte nuclear factor 1\u03b1 (HNF-1\u03b1), was also identified. We demonstrated that curcumin reduced the nuclear abundance of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1\u03b1, resulting in its attenuated interaction with the PCSK9 promoter and leading to a downregulation of PCSK9 expression. Finally, we showed that curcumin decreased the statin-induced PCSK9 expression and potentially synergized with statin administration.", 
    "15": "Current results indicate that curcumin suppression of PCSK9 expression is associated with increases in cell-surface LDLR and LDLR activity in hepatic cells and it acts in a molecular mechanism that is distinct from the statins.

All statins, apart from rosuvastatin, were used in very young children (1-7\u00a0years old). Polypharmacy was common in these patients, including combinations with calcineurin inhibitors and diltiazem, which can increase systemic statin exposure. A small number of very young children were prescribed high doses of statin, based on mg/kg dosing.",

    "42": "A frequent mechanism for drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is mitochondrial impairment, and early evaluation of new drugs for their potential to cause mitochondrial dysfunction is becoming an important task for drug development. To this end, we designed a high-content screening assay to study mitochondrial-induced hepatotoxicity in HepG2 cells in detail. Simultaneous assessment of mitochondrial mass and cell viability in cells exposed for 24\u00a0h to compounds provides preliminary information on the mitochondrial- or nonmitochondrial-related hepatotoxic potential of compounds. To fully address the mechanisms implicated in mitochondrial impairment, prelethal changes in mitochondrial superoxide production, mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial permeability transition, intracellular calcium concentration and apoptotic cell death were studied in cells incubated for 1\u00a0h with compounds. The assay correctly classified a set of well-known mitochondrial toxicants and negative controls and revealed high sensitivity for the detection of mitochondrial DILI and the establishment of different mitochondrial toxicity risks (low to high). This procedure was used for analysing the potential mitochondrial impairment of six statins to determine their clinical risk. All the tested statins produced mitochondrial impairment, although they showed different levels of toxicity (low-medium toxicity risk). The results suggest that this cell-based assay is a promising in vitro approach to predict the potential of drug candidates to induce mitochondrial-associated hepatotoxicity.", 
    "43": "Objective of the present study was to develop a proliposomal formulation to decrease the hepatic first-pass metabolism of a highly metabolized drug. Lovastatin was chosen as the model drug. Proliposomes were prepared by mixing different ratios of phospholipids such as soy phosphatidylcholine (SPC), hydrogenated egg phosphatidylcholine (HEPC) and dimyristoyl phosphatidylglycerol (DMPG) individually with drug and cholesterol in an organic solvent. Proliposomal powder was obtained following evaporation of the solvent. The proliposomal powder was either filled into capsules or compressed into tablets. Physical characterization, in vitro drug transport studies and in vitro dissolution of formulations and pure drug was carried out. In vitro transport across the membrane was evaluated using parallel artificial membrane permeability assay (PAMPA). The extent of drug released from various proliposomal formulations in the first 30 min was 85%, 87% and 96% with DMPG, SPC and HEPC containing formulations respectively, while the pure drug formulation showed 48% drug release in the same period. In vivo studies were carried out in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Following single oral administration of the selected formulation (F9), a relative bioavailability of 162% was achieved compared to pure lovastatin. The study demonstrated that proliposomes can be used as a drug delivery system to decrease the hepatic first-pass metabolism.", 
    "44": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with dementia. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a key determinant in this association. It is not clear whether T2DM increases the risk of conversion from MCI to dementia. We plan to explore the relationship between T2DM-MCI and dementia and identify its potential risk factors. A prospective community-based cohort study was conducted from March 2010 to March 2014, including 634 participants with T2DM-MCI, 261 T2DM participants who were cognitively intact, and 585 MCI participants without diabetes. All cohort members received detailed annual evaluations to detect dementia onset during the 5 years of follow-up. The three cohorts were compared to assess differences in dementia onset. Furthermore, Cox proportional hazards regression was used to identify risk factors for dementia onset in the T2DM-MCI cohort. During follow-up, 152 and 49 subjects developed dementia in the MCI and cognitively-intact cohorts, amounting to an adjusted hazard ratio (HR) of 1.66 (95% CI 1.07-2.26). In a survival analysis of the cohorts, MCI accelerated the median progression to dementia by 2.74 years. In a multivariable analysis of the T2DM-MCI cohort, major risk factors for dementia were age >75 years and longer durations of diabetes, while significantly reduced risks of dementia were associated with oral hypoglycemic agents and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Insulin was not associated with significantly changed risk. T2DM-MCI may aggravate the clinical picture as a concomitant factor. To minimize progression to dementia, it may be worthwhile to target several modifiable diabetes-specific features, such as the duration of disease, glycemic control, and antidiabetic agents.", 
    "45": "Although statins reduce cardiac events in hypertensive patients with cardiovascular risk factors, the effect of statins on coronary flow reserve (CFR) has not been examined. We tried to examine the effect of rosuvastatin on CFR in hypertensive patients at cardiovascular risk. CFR was studied in 56 hypertensive patients (40 men, 61 \u00b1 9 years) with cardiovascular risk factors and without coronary artery disease in a prospective clinical trial. Using Doppler echocardiography, coronary flow velocity in the distal left anterior descending artery was recorded at baseline and during intravenous adenosine infusion, and CFR was defined as the ratio of hyperemic to basal average peak diastolic flow velocity. The primary efficacy measure was defined as the change in CFR after rosuvastatin therapy for 12 months. CFR was measured successfully in 55 of 56 enrolled patients (98%). CFR was 3.16 \u00b1 0.44 at baseline and negatively correlated with age (R = -0.30, p = 0.025). All patients continued rosuvastatin 10 mg/day without any serious adverse events. After rosuvastatin therapy, serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein significantly decreased from 222 \u00b1 18 to 142 \u00b1 20 mg/dl, 148 \u00b1 21 to 85 \u00b1 18 mg/dl, and 1.7 \u00b1 2.9 to 1.2 \u00b1 3.1 mg/L, respectively (all p <0.01). CFR significantly increased from 3.16 \u00b1 0.44 to 3.31 \u00b1 0.42 (p <0.001). The change in CFR correlated with the change in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (R = -0.28, p = 0.040) but not with the change in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. In conclusion, CFR was significantly improved after 12 months of rosuvastatin therapy in hypertensive patients at cardiovascular risk and average levels of serum cholesterol.", 
    "46": "Beyond lipid-lowering effect, statins, the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase competitively inhibitors, have recently attracted wide concern on their anticarcinogenic properties in various cancer cells. However, the molecular mechanisms by which statins inhibit cancer cell proliferation remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of simvastatin on cells proliferation and oxidative stress in the A549 lung cancer cells and the mechanisms underlying. MTT assay revealed that simvastatin inhibited the proliferation of A549 cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Treatment with 50 microM simvastatin for 48 h significantly increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and malondialdehyde (MDA), a lipid peroxidation production, and augmented the activity of total superoxide dismutase (SOD) and manganese SOD (SOD2). Moreover, western blotting analysis showed that simvastatin effectively up-regulated the SOD2 relative protein level. These findings suggested that simvastatin could inhibit the proliferation of A549 lung cells through oxidative stress and up-regulation of SOD2.", 
    "47": "Simvastatin (SIM) solid dispersions with Pluronic F127 (PLU) obtained by kneading and fusion methods were characterized by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). DSC studies demonstrate that the SIM/PLU solid dispersions formed a simple eutectic phase diagram. FTIR spectroscopy and XRPD studies of obtained mixtures showed no interaction between the components in the solid state and confirmed the absence of terminal solid solutions. Intrinsic dissolution studies of solid dispersions in 0.5% sodium lauryl sulfate solution (SLS) indicated that the dissolution rate markedly increased in these solid dispersions systems compared with pure SIM. The increase in dissolution rate strongly depended on ratios of drug to carriers and selection of the method of preparations of mixtures. The solid dispersions prepared in the weight ratios of 60.0/40.0% and 69.9/30.1% w/w of SIM/PLU by the kneading method showed the highest improvement in wettability and dissolution rate of SIM. Approximately 100% of the drug was dissolved from these mixtures in comparison to 3.84% of pure simvastatin within 120 min.",

Therefore, we systematically reviewed the effect of statins on cognitive deficits in adult male rodents after TBI. After identifying eligible studies by searching four electronic databases on February 28, 2014, we assessed study quality, evaluated the efficacy of statin treatment, and performed stratified metaregression and metaregression to assess the influence of study design on statin efficacy. Eleven studies fulfilled our inclusion criteria from a total of 183 publications. The overall methodological quality of these studies was poor. Meta-analysis showed that statins exert statistically significant positive effects on cognitive performance after TBI. Stratified analysis showed that atorvastatin has the greatest effect on acquisition memory, simvastatin has the greatest effect on retention memory, and statin effects on acquisition memory are higher in closed head injury models. Metaregression analysis further showed that that animal species, study quality, and anesthetic agent impact statin effects on retention memory. We conclude that statins might reduce cognitive deficits after TBI. However, additional well-designed and well-reported animal studies are needed to inform further clinical study.",

Our objective is to explore sources of this heterogeneity by applying a common protocol in different data settings. We conducted ten case-control studies using data from five different health care databases. Databases varied on type of patients (hospitalised vs. GP), level of case validity, and mode of exposure ascertainment (prescription or dispensing based). Identified CAP patients and controls were matched on age, gender, and calendar year. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios (OR) for the associations between the drugs of interest and CAP. Associations were adjusted by a common set of potential confounders. Data of 38,742 cases and 118,019 controls were studied. Comparable patterns of variation between case-control studies were observed for ACEi, statins and PPI use and pneumonia risk with adjusted ORs varying from 1.04 to 1.49, 0.82 to 1.50 and 1.16 to 2.71, respectively. Overall, higher ORs were found for hospitalised CAP patients matched to population controls versus GP CAP patients matched to population controls. Prevalence of drug exposure was higher in dispensing data versus prescription data. We show that case-control selection and methods of exposure ascertainment induce bias that cannot be adjusted for and to a considerable extent explain the heterogeneity in results obtained in case-control studies on statins, ACEi and PPIs and CAP. The common protocol approach helps to better understand sources of variation in observational studies.", 
    "69": "The intent of this review is to update the science of emerging cardiometabolic risk factors that were listed in the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel-III (ATP-III) report of 2001 (updated in 2004). At the time these guidelines were published, the evidence was felt to be insufficient to recommend these risk factors for routine screening of cardiovascular disease risk. However, the panel felt that prudent use of these biomarkers for patients at intermediate risk of a major cardiovascular event over the subsequent 10 years might help identify patients who needed more aggressive low density lipoprotein (LDL) or non-high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol lowering therapy. While a number of other emerging risk factors have been identified, this review will be limited to assessing the data and recommendations for the use of apolipoprotein B, lipoprotein (a), homocysteine, pro-thrombotic factors, inflammatory factors, impaired glucose metabolism, and measures of subclinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease for further cardiovascular disease risk stratification.",

After filtering, we were left with a potentially disease causing variant in the LDL receptor (LDLR) gene, which we validated by Sanger-sequencing (nucleotide substitution in the acceptor splice-site of exon 10, c.1359-1G > A). Sequencing of all family members available for genetic analysis revealed co-segregation of the variant with CAD (LOD 3.0) and increased LDLC (>190 mg/dL), following correction for statin treatment (LOD 4.3). Interestingly, mutation carriers presented with highly variable corrected (183-354 mg/dL) and on-treatment LDL levels (116-274 mg/dL) such that the diagnosis of FH in this family was made only after the molecular-genetic analysis.",

Because of them, each year in Poland die about 82.000 men and 91.000 women, which is 43% of all deaths in men and 54% of all deaths in women. The risk of heart disease in women is still underestimated. 200 patients were examined. They were classified into one of four groups (25 women and 25 men in each group). In the population there were evaluated: patients' age, BMI, the number of pack-years and number of patients treated with a statin; biochemical parameters: total cholesterol, HDL and LDL cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting plasma glucose, urea, creatinine, eGFR, uric acid, hs-CRP. The hemodynamic characteristics were evaluated: ABI, IMT and PWV. The study showed that ABI and IMT were significant correlated in women with hypertension (with or without concomitant coronary artery disease). On the other hand, this correlation in patients with coronary artery disease (without concomitant hypertension) was significant only in men. Moreover, women with hypertension (without concomitant coronary heart disease) had significantly lower levels of serum uric acid than men and significantly less subclinical organ damage assessed by IMT and PWV measurements. Meanwhile the ABI was not significantly different in women and men, regardless of the presence of coronary artery disease or hypertension.",

Alternative splicing in a number of genes has been reported to be associated with variable statin response. RNA-seq has proven to be a powerful technique for genome-wide splice variant analysis. In the present study, we sought to investigate atorvastatin responsive splice variants in HepG2 cells using RNA-seq analysis to identify novel candidate genes implicated in cholesterol homeostasis and in the statin response. HepG2 cells were treated with 10 \u00b5M atorvastatin for 24 hours. RNA-seq and exon array analyses were performed. The validation of selected genes was performed using Taqman gene expression assays. RNA-seq analysis identified 121 genes and 98 specific splice variants, of which four were minor splice variants to be differentially expressed, 11 were genes with potential changes in their splicing patterns (SYCP3, ZNF195, ZNF674, MYD88, WHSC1, KIF16B, ZNF92, AGER, FCHO1, SLC6A12 and AKAP9), and one was a gene (RAP1GAP) with differential promoter usage. The IL21R transcript was detected to be differentially expressed via RNA-seq and RT-qPCR, but not in the exon array. In conclusion, several novel candidate genes that are affected by atorvastatin treatment were identified in this study. Further studies are needed to determine the biological significance of the atorvastatin responsive splice variants that have been uniquely identified using RNA-seq.",

We investigated the relationship of Rac1, atrial endothelial thromboprotective markers and AF inducibility and if simvastatin has a potential beneficial effect on a myocardial infarction (MI)-induced heart failure (HF) rat model. Rats were randomized into three groups (shams, MI group and simvastatin treatment group) and underwent echocardiography, AF induction studies and left atrial (LA) fibrosis analysis. Atrial Rac 1, sodium calcium exchanger (INCX), sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA), endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and induced nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were measured. AF inducibility, AF duration and LA fibrosis were significantly higher in the MI group (p < 0.001 vs. sham), which were significantly reduced by simvastatin (p < 0.05 vs. MI). The reduced expressions of atrial eNOS, SERCA, thrombomodulin, tissue factor pathway inhibitor and tissue plasminogen activator in the MI group were significantly improved by simvastatin. Furthermore, the increased expression of atrial iNOS, INCX and Rac1 activity were significantly decreased by the simvastatin. Oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction and thrombogenicity are associated with the promotion of AF in a rat model of ischemic HF. These were associated with increased Rac1 activity, and simvastatin treatment prevents these changes.",

    "174": "Since the discovery of the importance of nitric oxide (NO) to the human body three decades ago, numerous laboratory and clinical studies have been done to explore its potential therapeutic actions on many organs. In the cardiovascular system, NO works as a volatile signaling molecule regulating the vascular permeability and vascular tone, preventing thrombosis and inflammation, as well as inhibiting the smooth muscle hyperplasia. Thus, NO is important in the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease. NO is synthesized by NO synthase (NOS) with tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) as the crucial cofactor. Many studies have been done to form nitric oxide donors so as to deliver NO directly to the vessel walls. In addition, NO moieties have been incorporated into existing therapeutic agents to enhance the NO bioavailability, including statins. Statins are inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme (HMG-CoA), the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway. By inhibiting this pathway, statins lower blood cholesterol and exert their pleiotropic effects through activity in reaction cascades, such as Rho/ROCK and Rac 1/NADPH oxidase pathways. Statins have also been observed to implement their non-lipid effects by promoting BH4 synthesis with increase of NO bioavailability. Furthermore, NO-donating statins in laboratory studies have demonstrated to produce better therapeutic effects than their parent's drugs. They offer better anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative and antithrombotic actions on cardiovascular system. They also cause better revascularization in peripheral ischemia and produce greater enhancement in limb reperfusion and salvage. In addition, it has been shown that NO-donating statin caused less myotoxicity, the most common side effect related to treatment with statins. The initial studies have demonstrated the superior therapeutic effects of NO-donating statins while producing fewer side effects.",

ATV facilitated the MSC survival, as revealed by the increased expression of Y chromosomal genes and the increased number of Y chromosome-positive cells; however, no transdifferentiation markers were observed. ATV inhibited the production of inflammatory cytokines both in vitro and vivo, accompanied by suppression of ROCK and ERK activities. Geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) abrogated the effects of ATV in the H9c2 cells under hypoxia/serum deprivation (H/SD), while the ROCK inhibitor fasudil mimicked the benefits of ATV after AMI.",

    "180": "Pitavastatin, a highly potent inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-methylglutarylcoenzyme A reductase, is a known substrate of OATP1B1. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) inhibits OATP1B1 expression by repressing hepatocyte nuclear factor 1\u03b1 (HNF1\u03b1). Thus, the effects of UDCA on the pharmacokinetics of pitavastatin were investigated in healthy subjects.", 
    "181": "An open-label, 2-phase, parallel study was conducted with 13 healthy volunteers. In the control phase, after an overnight fast, each subject received a single dose of 2 mg pitavastatin. After a 1-week washout period, in the UDCA phase, subjects received a daily oral dose of 600 mg of UDCA (300 mg b.i.d.) for 14 days. On day 15, 2 mg of pitavastatin was administered as described previously for the control phase.", 
    "182": "In the UDCA phase, the maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) of pitavastatin was slightly higher than in the control phase (48.6 \u00b1 22.9 ng/mL vs. 42.4 \u00b1 16.1 ng/mL). However, the overall pharmacokinetic parameters of pitavastatin and pitavastatin lactone during the two study phases were not significantly different.", 
    "183": "UDCA had no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of pitavastatin. These results do not support the notion that UDCA increases the systemic exposure of OATP1B1 substrate by inhibiting HNF1\u03b1 and decreasing OATP1B1 transporter expression.",

Our objective was to determine whether abbreviated rapid carotid ultrasonographic screening would reveal important global vascular risk information in statin-naive patients referred for routine transthoracic echocardiography (TTE).", 
    "185": "Abbreviated carotid ultrasonographic imaging was performed in 560 consecutive patients undergoing TTE. The common carotid artery (CCA), the carotid bulb, and the internal carotid artery (ICA) were scanned. Maximal CCA intima-media thickness (IMT) was measured in the far wall.

    "188": "The objective of this work was to formulate a Self Emulsifying Drug Delivery System (SEDDS) of simvastatin, a poorly soluble drug and to evaluate by in vivo, in vitro and ex vivo techniques. Oils and surfactants were screened out depending upon their solubilizing capacity. Among all of the solvents, Capryol 90 showed good solubilizing capacity. It dissolved 105\u2009mg/ml of simvastatin. Tween-80 also showed good solubilizing capacity which was 117\u2009mg/ml. The two excipients were used to prepare simvastatin SEDDS. Formulations were initially checked for the color, clarity and sedimentation. The SEDDS formulations were transparent and clear. Formulation F2 containing 7:3 (m/m) mixture of Capryol 90/Tween-80 produced smallest micro-emulsion with particles size of 0.074\u2009\u00b5m and drug release was higher than other formulation (102% within 20\u2009min). Ex vivo study of the SEDDS formulation was evaluated using guinea pig intestinal sac. Drug diffused from F2 formulation was significantly higher than pure drug (p\u2009<\u20090.001). In vivo study of SEDDS was performed in albino mice using plasma cholesterol level as a pharmacodynamic marker parameter. The test formulation (F2) appeared remarkable reduction in plasma cholesterol level, after oral administration which showed that SEDDS may be an effective technique for the oral administration of simvastatin.", 
    "189": "AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a key energy sensor that regulates cellular energy homeostasis. AMPK activation is associated with decreased phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and S6 kinase and causes a general reduction in mRNA translation and protein synthesis. Therefore, AMPK is a novel target for anticancer therapy. Metformin and aspirin are two traditional drugs that are widely used as anti-diabetes and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), respectively. Much evidence has confirmed that these two drugs demonstrated encouraging anti-cancer properties. Most importantly, both inhibited tumor proliferation and were mainly dependent on the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway. In addition, several other drugs, such as resveratrol, berberine, statins, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and capsaicin, have provided a similar capacity for tumor inhibition, and the anti-cancer effects of most of them were mainly the result of AMPK activation. In the current review, we summarize the literature on combination therapy based on these non-classical drugs and their potential mechanisms for activating AMPK. Combinations of these drugs will provide a novel cancer therapeutic regimen.", 
    "190": "The purpose of the present report was to examine whether proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) levels differ in individuals who do not exhibit expected reductions in low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with statin therapy. Eighteen nonresponder subjects treated with 80\u2009mg atorvastatin treatment for 6 months without substantial reductions in LDL-C (\u0394LDL-C: 2.6 \u00b1 11.4%) were compared to age- and gender-matched atorvastatin responders (\u0394LDL-C: 50.7 \u00b1 8.5%) and placebo-treated subjects (\u0394LDL-C: 9.9 \u00b1 21.5%). Free PCSK9 was marginally higher in nonresponders at baseline (P = 0.07) and significantly higher in atorvastatin responders after 6 months of treatment (P = 0.04). The change in free PCSK9 over 6 months with statin treatment was higher (P < 0.01) in atorvastatin responders (134.2 \u00b1 131.5\u2009ng/mL post- versus prestudy) than in either the nonresponders (39.9 \u00b1 87.8\u2009ng/mL) or placebo subjects (27.8 \u00b1 97.6\u2009ng/mL). Drug compliance was not lower in the nonresponders as assessed by pill counts and poststudy plasma atorvastatin levels. Serum PCSK9 levels, both at baseline and in response to statin therapy, may differentiate individuals who do versus those who do not respond to statin treatment.",

    "193": "Fibrosis progression occurred in 3/29 (10%) statin users and 145/514 (29%) non-users. The unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) for fibrosis progression among statin users compared to non-users was 0.32 (95% CI 0.10-0.99). This association remained significant after adjusting for established predictors of histological outcome, including body mass index, platelets and hepatic steatosis (adjusted HR 0.31; 95% CI 0.10-0.97). The mean change in Ishak fibrosis score over the 3.5 year study period was -0.34 (SE 0.18) for statin users compared to +0.42 (SE 0.07) for non-users (p = 0.006, after adjustment for baseline fibrosis score).",

    "201": "Ovarian cancer cell lines were treated with combinations of statins and oxysterols. Cell viability was determined by a modified MTT assay. Apoptosis was evaluated by immunoblotting of PARP and DAPI-mediated visualization of apoptotic nuclei. STOX effects on the expression of genes of the mevalonate pathway were assessed by real-time qPCR and immunoblotting. siRNA-mediated gene silencing was used to test the involvement of oxysterol-mediated repression of SREBP-2 in STOX synergy. The impact of statin-mediated inhibition of protein prenylation and on cholesterol homeostasis was evaluated.", 
    "202": "Oxysterols dramatically enhance cytotoxicity of statins in ovarian cancer cells through increased apoptosis. Decreased expression of SREBP-2 down-regulates the mevalonate pathway and prevents the active statin-induced sterol feedback, enhancing statin toxicity. Comparison of two ovarian cancer cell lines reveals two distinct mechanisms of statin induced toxicity, namely, dependence on protein geranylgeranylation and/or perturbation of cellular cholesterol levels.", 
    "203": "We provide evidence of statins' mechanisms of cytotoxicity in different ovarian cancer cells and discovered a new approach to significantly enhance the anti-tumor activity of statins. These observations provide a potential new path to improve statins as a treatment against ovarian cancer with obtainable dosages.", 
    "204": "The administration of statins in patients with liver disease is not an absolute contraindication. Hepatotoxicity is a rare and often dose-related event and in the literature there are only a few described cases of fatal rhabdomyolysis in patients with chronic liver disease after statin administration. During treatment with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, the factors responsible for myopathy may either be related to the patient, or due to interactions with other medications that are metabolic substrates of the same isozymes and therefore able to increase blood statin concentration. The most important side effects consist of increased transaminase levels, abdominal pain or muscle weakness, increased serum levels of creatine kinase and rhabdomyolysis. In this article we report a case of fatal rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure after gastric endoscopy, where midazolam was used as a sedation agent in a patient with chronic liver disease treated with a high dose of atorvastatin. Therefore, we suggest paying particular attention to the potential risks of associating atorvastatin and midazolam in patients with chronic liver disease who need to undergo gastric endoscopy.",

Recently, larger studies have challenged the correlations made by earlier case reports, and instead demonstrate a mild protective effect in statin users. We present a case report of likely statin induced pancreatitis in a 58-year-old male (which we have attributed to drug-drug interaction with resulting inhibition of hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes) and have reviewed the apparent dichotomy in the available literature.", 
    "206": "Redox systems are key players in vascular health. A shift in redox homeostasis-that results in an imbalance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and endogenous antioxidant defenses has the potential to create a state of oxidative stress that subsequently plays a role in the pathogenesis of a number of diseases, including those of the cardiovascular and metabolic system. Statins, which are primarily used to reduce the concentration of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, have also been shown to reduce oxidative stress by modulating redox systems. Studies conducted both in vitro and in vivo support the role of oxidative stress in the development of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases. Oxidative stress may also be responsible for various diabetic complications and the development of fatty liver. Statins reduce oxidative stress by blocking the generation of ROS and reducing the NAD+/NADH ratio. These drugs also have effects on nitric oxide synthase, lipid peroxidation and the adiponectin levels. It is possible that the antioxidant properties of statins contribute to their protective cardiovascular effects, independent of the lipid-lowering actions of these agents. However, possible adverse effects of statins on glucose homeostasis may be related to the redox system. Therefore, studies investigating the modulation of redox signaling by statins are warranted.", 
    "207": "Lifelong exposure to raised concentrations of LDL cholesterol increases cardiovascular event rates, and the use of statin therapy as an adjunct to diet, exercise, and smoking cessation has proven highly effective in reducing the population burden associated with hyperlipidaemia. Yet, despite consistent biological, genetic, and epidemiological data, and evidence from randomised trials, there is controversy among national guidelines and clinical practice with regard to LDL cholesterol, its measurement, the usefulness of population-based screening, the net benefit-to-risk ratio for different LDL-lowering drugs, the benefit of treatment targets, and whether aggressive lowering of LDL is safe. Several novel therapies have been introduced for the treatment of people with genetic defects that result in loss of function within the LDL receptor, a major determinant of inherited hyperlipidaemias. Moreover, the usefulness of monoclonal antibodies that extend the LDL-receptor lifecycle (and thus result in substantial lowering of LDL cholesterol below the levels achieved with statins alone) is being assessed in phase 3 trials that will enrol more than 60,000 at-risk patients worldwide. These trials represent an exceptionally rapid translation of genetic observations into clinical practice and will address core questions of how low LDL cholesterol can be safely reduced, whether the mechanism of LDL-cholesterol lowering matters, and whether ever more aggressive lipid-lowering provides a safe, long-term mechanism to prevent atherothrombotic complications.", 
    "208": "We explored the effects of atorvastatin on BMD and biochemical markers of bone metabolism in a 1-year, prospective, randomized controlled study. 64 male patients with osteopenia and mild dyslipidemia (mean age 80.1\u00b16.6 years) were randomized to a 1-year atorvastatin treatment or control. BMD of hip and lumbar spine was measured with dual-energy X-ray absorptionmetry (DXA). Bone metabolic markers including resorption markers \u03b2-c-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTx), formative markers osteocalcin (OC), 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) were measured with electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (ECLIA). Other bone metabolism markers including intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and testosterone were measured with chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA). Levels of serum lipid and biochemical parameters were measured with automatic biochemical analyzer. All the parameters were recorded at baseline, and at 6 and 12 months, respectively. Compared with the control group, the atorvastatin treatment group showed significant reduction of triglyceride (TG, P<0.01) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C, P<0.01). At 12 month, total hip BMD in atorvastatin group was significantly higher (P<0.01) compared with the control group, while there were no similar effect on femoral neck or lumbar spine between the two groups (P=0.48 and 0.53 respectively). Meanwhile, CTx significantly reduced in atorvastatin treatment group (P<0.001) compared with baseline. Our findings suggest that in elderly male patients with osteopenia and mild dyslipidemia, therapeutic doses of atorvastatin were associated with positive effects on BMD, probably mediated by suppressed bone resorption."
