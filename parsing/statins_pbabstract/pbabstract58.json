    "0": "Breast carcinoma is the leading cause of cancer-associated mortality in female individuals worldwide. Previous studies have investigated the pro-apoptotic and antimetastatic effects of statins, and have demonstrated that simvastatin exhibits antitumor activity and potent chemopreventive effects. However, the mechanism underlying the effects of simvastatin in breast cancer remains to be elucidated. The present study demonstrated that simvastatin inhibited the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner, decreased the protein expression of B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and increased the protein expression of Bcl-2-associated X protein in time- and dose-dependent manners. In addition, simvastatin arrested cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle, downregulated the protein expression levels of cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)2, mediated the mitochondria-dependent caspase cascade by increasing the protein expression levels of caspase-3, -8 and -9, and downregulated the protein expression of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis, which induced cell apoptosis. In addition, simvastatin decreased the protein expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and suppressed the activation of nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB in the MDA-MB-231 cells. Taken together, these results demonstrated that the antitumor effect of simvastatin in the human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line was via the inhibition of cell proliferation, affecting the cell cycle, downregulating the expression levels of cyclin D1 and CDKs, inducing apoptosis and decreasing the expression of MMP-2, possibly by inhibiting the activation of NF-\u03baB. Statin treatment may provide a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of breast cancer.", 
    "1": "Human non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is one of the most common cancer worldwide. In previous studies, lovastatin, acting as an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl Co A (HMG-CoA) reductase, exhibited significant antitumor activity during tumorigenesis. However, whether or not this effect is mediated through changes in minichromosome maintenance (MCM) 2 expression remains unclear. The present study investigated whether lovastatin inhibits proliferation due to MCM2 in NSCLCs. We first assessed the effects of lovastatin on cell anti-proliferation, cell cycle progression and apoptosis in NSCLC cells. We found, by quantitative RT-PCR and western blot analysis, that lovastatin treatment markedly and consistently inhibited the expression of MCM2. Then, to further explore the anticancer mechanism of lovastatin involving MCM2, we silenced MCM2 by siRNA in two cell lines (A549 and GLC-82). Silencing of MCM2 triggered G1/S arrest. Following further examination of cell cycle-related factors, MCM2 knockdown inhibited protein retinoblastoma (Rb), cyclin D1 and CDK4 expression, but increased p21 and p53 expression, suggesting that siMCM2 indeed triggered cell cycle arrest. In addition, siMCM2 induced apoptosis. Finally, lovastatin treatment increased p-JNK, which is involved in the downregulation of MCM2. In conclusion, our data suggest that MCM2 may be a novel therapeutic target of lovastatin treatment in NSCLCs.",

However the lack of suitable antibodies limits its widespread application. We developed a method in which multi-specific antibodies are used to enrich groups of peptides, thus facilitating multiplexed quantitative protein assays. We tested this strategy in a pharmacokinetic experiment by targeting a group of homologous drug transforming proteins in human hepatocytes. Our results indicate the generic applicability of this method to any biological system.", 
    "3": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor, atorvastatin (ATO), is a highly effective drug used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia. Its application is restricted now-a-days due to several acute and chronic side effects. ATO induced anti hypercholesterolemia and hepatic tissue toxicity has been reported to follow different mechanisms. The present study has been carried out to investigate the protective role of arjunolic acid (AA) against ATO induced oxidative impairment and cell death in hepatic and renal tissue in mice. Administration of ATO (at a dose 30\u00a0mg/kg/day for 8 weeks) enhanced serum markers, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and altered the pro oxidant-antioxidant status of liver and kidney tissues. Our experimental evidence suggests that ATO exposure induces apoptotic cell deathby the activation of caspase-3 and reciprocal regulation of Bcl-2/Bax with the concomitant reduction of mitochondrial membrane potential and increased level of cytosolic cytochrome c, Apaf1, caspase-9. Besides, ATO markedly increased the phosphorylation of MAPKs, enhanced caspase-12 and calpain level. Histological studies and DNA fragmentation analysis also support the toxic effect of ATO in these organs pathophysiology. Post treatment with AA (at a dose of 20\u00a0mg/kg body weight for 4 days), however, reduced ATO-induced oxidative stress and suppressed all these apoptotic events. Results suggest that AA could effectively and extensively counteract these adverse effects and might protect liver and kidney from ATO-induced severe tissue toxicity.",

Stage was coded using SEER criteria and was stratified into early (in situ and local)- versus late (regional and distant)-stage disease. Information on statins and other risk factors were collected by self- and interviewer-administered questionnaires. Cause of death was based on medical record review. Multivariable-adjusted hazards ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) evaluating the relationship between statin use (at baseline only and in a time-dependent manner) and diagnosis of late-stage breast cancer and breast cancer-specific mortality were computed from Cox proportional hazards analyses after adjusting for appropriate confounders.",

    "16": "The discovery and elucidation of the role of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDL-R) in familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) ushered in the statin group of drugs. These drugs, in addition to lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), result in a significant reduction in cardiovascular events (CVE) and mortality. Recently, a gain-of-function mutation in another protein, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), was reported to result in a FH phenotype by promoting degradation of the LDL-R. More importantly, loss-of-function mutations in the same gene resulted in low LDL-C and a reduction in CVE, making this an enticing target for drug development. Numerous strategies have been developed to target PCSK9, the most successful being monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that bind PCSK9. These mAbs have been shown to reduce LDL-C around 50% as either monotherapy with diet or in combination with statin therapy. In this short perspective, we discuss the biochemistry and biology of PCSK9 in relation to lipid metabolism and the promising studies in humans demonstrating a substantial reduction in LDL-C with relative good short-term safety of PCSK9 mAbs.",

We have recently detected higher levels of flavonoids in indigo leaves. This study was undertaken to conduct the simultaneous analysis of those flavonoids using total extracts from indigo leaves by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-time-of-flight/mass spectrometry(E) (UPLC-ESI-TOF/MS(E)). The analysis by UPLC-ESI-TOF/MS(E) allowed us to determine 11 peaks of flavonoid species. The chemical structures of these compounds were identified as flavonol O-glycosides with different types of aglycones by the combination of spectroscopic and chemical methods. The predominant compounds were flavonol O-glycosides with 3,5,4'-trihydroxy-6,7-methylenedioxyflavone as an aglycone. Of these, three compounds were elucidated as new compounds. All the isolated flavonol O-glycosides exhibited the inhibitory activity against 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase in a dose-dependent manner with different potencies. Taken together, our results suggest the potential usefulness of the major flavonol O-glycosides from indigo leaves in controlling cholesterol biosynthesis.", 
    "18": "Serum cholesterol, both total and lipoprotein fractions, has been associated with mid- and late-life depression. Using longitudinal data on a large and ethnically diverse sample of urban adults, the associations of serum lipid profile measured by high or low total cholesterol (TC; >200\u2009mg\u2009dl(-1); <160\u2009mg\u2009dl(-1)) and by atherogenic indices, namely high total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol relative to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, with change in total and domain-specific depressive symptoms over time were examined. Findings were compared by sex. (Hypothesis 1) In addition, baseline depressive symptoms as predictors for longitudinal change in lipid profile trajectory were tested. (Hypothesis 2) Mixed-effects regression analyses stratified by sex was used. Sample sizes of participants (n) and repeated observations (n') were: Hypothesis 1 (Men: n=826 ; n'=1319; Women: n=1099 ; n'=1817); Hypothesis 2 (Men: n=738; n'=1230; Women: n=964; n'=1678). As hypothesized, a higher level of atherogenic indices was linked to faster increase in depressive symptom scores, particularly depressed affect and interpersonal problems, though this relationship was found only among women. Among men a U-shaped relationship between baseline TC and longitudinal increase in somatic complaints and a direct link between low TC and longitudinal putative improvement in positive affect was found. On excluding statin users among women, low TC was associated with slower increase in depressed affect over time, whereas high TC was associated with faster increase in interpersonal problems. In summary, atherogenic indices were directly linked to faster increase in depressive symptoms among women only. More studies are needed to explain these sex-specific associations.",

In order to treat those infections properly, it is necessary to target the treatment not only to the trophozoite but also to the cyst. Furthermore, it may be advantageous to avoid parasite killing by necrosis, which may induce local inflammation. We must also avoid toxicity of host tissue. Many drugs which target eukaryotes are known to induce programmed cell death (PCD), but this process is poorly characterized in Acanthamoeba. Here, we study the processes of programmed cell death in Acanthamoeba, induced by several drugs, such as statins and voriconazole. We tested atorvastatin, fluvastatin, simvastatin, and voriconazole at the 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) and IC90s that we have previously established. In order to evaluate this phenomenon, we investigated the DNA fragmentation, one of the main characteristics of PCD, with quantitative and qualitative techniques. Also, the changes related to phosphatidylserine exposure on the external cell membrane and cell permeability were studied. Finally, because caspases are key to PCD pathways, caspase activity was evaluated in Acanthamoeba. All the drugs assayed in this study induced PCD in Acanthamoeba. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study where PCD induced by drugs is described quantitatively and qualitatively in Acanthamoeba.", 
    "23": "This Review discusses new developments in understanding the basis of chylomicronaemia--a challenging metabolic disorder for which there is an unmet clinical need. Chylomicronaemia presents in two distinct primary forms. The first form is very rare monogenic early-onset chylomicronaemia, which presents in childhood or adolescence and is often caused by homozygous mutations in the gene encoding lipoprotein lipase (LPL), its cofactors apolipoprotein C-II or apolipoprotein A-V, the LPL chaperone lipase maturation factor 1 or glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored high density lipoprotein-binding protein 1. The second form, polygenic late-onset chylomicronaemia, which is caused by an accumulation of several genetic variants, can be exacerbated by secondary factors, such as poor diet, obesity, alcohol intake and uncontrolled type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus, and is more common than early-onset chylomicronaemia. Both forms of chylomicronaemia are associated with an increased risk of life-threatening pancreatitis; the polygenic form might also be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Treatment of chylomicronaemia focuses on restriction of dietary fat and control of secondary factors, as available pharmacological therapies are only minimally effective. Emerging therapies that might prove more effective than existing agents include LPL gene therapy, inhibition of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein and diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1, and interference with the production and secretion of apoC-III and angiopoietin-like protein 3.",

Despite the fact that ezetimibe led to positive results on the primary endpoint, the clinical benefit translated to real-life practice is only modest at best. However, this is the first major trial to demonstrate a significant benefit of a lipid medication in addition to statins.

The formulation strategy was based on the use of drug-loaded mesoporous silica as the core for the fusion of liposomes. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (Cryo-TEM) and nitrogen adsorption were used to systematically characterize the drug carrier and drug-loaded MN-SLB formulation, confirming the successful inclusion of LOV into the nano-pores of MN-SLB. Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) confirmed that the incorporated drug in the carrier was in an amorphous state. An in vitro dissolution study showed that LOV-loaded MN-SLB exhibited a sustained drug release behavior. Compared with the LOV-loaded mesoporous silica particles, LOV-loaded MN-SLB markedly suppressed the burst release. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetics and relative bioavailability of the LOV-loaded MN-SLB formulation was studied in beagle dogs after oral administration and using a commercially available immediate release formulation (Sandoz Lovastatin\u00ae) as a reference. It was found that the relative bioavailability of LOV and LOV \u03b2-hydroxy acid (LOVA) for the LOV-loaded MN-SLB formulation was 207.2% and 192.1%, respectively. In addition, MN-SLB exhibited negligible toxicity against Caco-2 and HT-29 cells in cytotoxicity assays. The results of this study indicate that the MN-SLB nanocomposite is a promising candidate as a novel oral drug delivery nanovehicle for controlling the dissolution rate and improving the oral absorption of water-insoluble drugs.",

    "54": "The present study explores the role of simvastatin in vincristine-induced neuropathic pain, which was induced by administering vincristine (100\u2009\u00b5g/kg i.p.) for 10 days (two 5 day cycles with 2 days pause). Pain was assessed by determining mechanical hyperalgesia, mechanical dynamic allodynia, heat hyperalgesia and cold allodynia. Biochemically, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was measured along with serum cholesterol levels. Simvastatin (7.5, 15 and 30\u2009mg/kg) was administered for 14 days after administration of vincristine. Simvastatin (7.5 and 15\u2009mg/kg) reversed vincristine-induced neuropathic pain and attenuated vincristine-induced increase in MPO, without altering cholesterol levels. Simvastatin at higher dose (30\u2009mg/kg) did not alter neuropathic pain despite decreasing MPO levels. Furthermore, administration of simvastatin (30\u2009mg/kg i.p.) in vincristine treated rats as well as it's per se administration in normal rats reduced cholesterol levels. Per se administration of simvastatin in normal rats produced neuropathic pain. It is concluded that simvastatin attenuates neuropathic pain only at lower doses with no reduction in cholesterol levels and anti-inflammatory effects may possibly reverse neuropathic pain. However, despite reducing inflammation, simvastatin did not confer beneficial effects at higher doses at which there is reduction in cholesterol levels, suggesting the critical role of cholesterol in neuropathic pain induction.",

A 48-year old Caucasian female was admitted for diffuse arthralgias. She was diagnosed eight years before with seropositive RA and she received Methotrexate, Prednisone and anti-inflammatory drugs. A week after the admission the patient presented sudden onset of left hemiplegia. Cerebral CT scan was suggestive for acute infarction in the right middle cerebral artery area and an old sequelar infarction in the left posterior artery area. Laboratory tests revealed: erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 40 mm/hour, fibrinogen 656 mg/dL, C-reactive protein of 20 mg/dL, rheumatoid factor 66.83 U/mL, anti CCP3 IgG 213.54 U/mL, ANA 128.126 U/mL. Also, she had high LDL-cholesterol serum concentration (190 mg/dL). The ECG revealed sinus rhythm, QRS axis-45 degrees, antero-lateral ischemia. Ultrasound examination of cervico-cerebral arteries emphasized occlusion of the left internal carotid artery, large atheromas in both carotid and vertebral arteries. A treatment with anti-aggregant and statin was started, and the former treatment for RA was continued with a raised Prednisone dose. The outcome was favorable, the patient's motor deficit improved (3/5 BMRC at the upper limb and 4/5 at the inferior limb) and she was able to walk with a cane support. She also presented an alleviation in the laboratory test status. Ischemic stroke is a possible complication of RA, presenting as principal risk factor precocious atherosclerosis. A better control of inflammation by new anti-rheumatic treatments will protect the RA patients of deleterious effects of ischemic stroke.",

    "61": "Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in the pancreatic \u03b2-cells entails a variety of signaling mechanisms including activation of small GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins). Previous studies from our laboratory in human islets, rodent islets and clonal \u03b2-cells have demonstrated that G-proteins (e.g., Arf6, Cdc42 and Rac1) play novel roles in cytoskeletal remodeling, which is a critical step in the trafficking of insulin-laden secretory granules for fusion with plasma membrane and release of insulin. To further understand regulatory roles of Rac1 in GSIS, we utilized, herein, EHT 1864, a small molecule inhibitor, which attenuates Rac1 activation by retaining the G-protein in an inert/inactive state, thereby preventing activation of its downstream effector proteins. We demonstrate that EHT 1864 markedly attenuated GSIS in INS-1 832/13 cells. In addition, EHT 1864 significantly reduced glucose-induced activation and membrane targeting of Rac1 in INS-1 832/13 cells. This Rac1 inhibitor also suppressed glucose-induced activation of ERK1/2 and p53, but not Akt. Lastly, unlike the inhibitors of protein prenylation (simvastatin), EHT 1864 did not exert any significant effects on cell morphology (cell rounding) under the conditions it attenuated Rac1-sensitive signaling steps leading to GSIS. Based on these findings, we conclude that EHT 1864 specifically inhibits glucose-induced Rac1 activation and membrane association and associated downstream signaling events culminating in inhibition of GSIS.",

The analysis uses data from the Australian Hypertension and Absolute Risk Study (AusHEART), which involves patients aged 55 years and over who visited a GP between April and June 2008. Socioeconomic and clinical information was collected and linked to administrative data on pharmaceutical use. Patients without a concession card were 63% more likely (hazard ratio (HR) 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.14-2.33) to discontinue and 60% (odds ratio (OR) CI: 1.04-2.44) more likely to fail to adhere to therapy compared to concessional patients. Smokers were 2.12 (HR CI: 1.39-3.22) times more likely to discontinue use and 2.23 (OR CI: 1.35-3.71) times more likely to fail to adhere compared to non-smokers. Patients who had recently initiated statin medication were also 2.28 (HR CI: 1.22-4.28) times more likely to discontinue use.

This paper assesses whether patterns of statin use by Medicare beneficiaries post-discharge may be due to a mix of high-quality and low-quality physicians. Our data come from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) Chronic Condition Data Warehouse (CCW) and include 100% of Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized for an acute myocardial infarction in 2008 or 2009. Our study sample included physicians treating at least 10 Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries during their MI institutional stay. Physician-specific statin fill rates (the proportion of each physician's patients with a statin within 30 days post-discharge) were calculated to assess physician quality. We hypothesized that if the observed statin rates reflected a mix of high-quality and low-quality physicians, then physician-specific statin fill rates should follow a u-shaped or bimodal distribution. In our sample, 62% of patients filled a statin prescription within 30 days of discharge. We found that the distribution of statin fill rates across physicians was normal, with no clear distinctions in physician quality. Physicians, especially cardiologists, with relatively younger and healthier patient populations had higher rates of statin use. Our results suggest that physicians were engaging in patient-centered care, tailoring treatments to patient characteristics.",

This study evaluated serial coronary plaque change of NCL in patients with different stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and integrated backscatter IVUS (IB-IVUS). In 113 patients (113 NCLs) underwent both IVUS-guided PCI and follow-up IVUS, volumetric IVUS analyses were performed at proximal reference NCLs in de novo target vessels post PCI and at 8-month follow-up. NCLs were divided into 4 groups based on baseline CKD stage: CKD-1, n = 18; CKD-2, n = 42; CKD-3, n = 29; and CKD4-5, n = 24. We compared serial changes of plaque burden and composition among groups under statin treatment. Plaque progression occurred in CKD-3 (+4.6 mm(3), p < 0.001) and CKD4-5 (+9.8 mm(3), p < 0.001) despite anti-atherosclerotic treatment, whereas plaque regression occurred in CKD-1 (-5.4 mm(3), p = 0.002) and CKD-2 (-3.2 mm(3), p = 0.001) mainly due to initiate statin treatment after PCI. Plaque volume change was correlated with eGFR (p < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis showed CKD stage 3-5 was an independent predictor of plaque progression. Regarding IB-IVUS analyses, lipid plaque increased in CKD-3 (+4.6 mm(3), p < 0.001) and CKD4-5 (+5.4 mm(3), p < 0.001), but decreased in CKD-2 (-2.7 mm(3), p < 0.05). Fibrotic plaque also increased in CKD4-5 (+3.4 mm(3), p < 0.001). Moderate to advanced CKD was associated with coronary plaque progression characterized by greater lipid and fibrotic plaque volumes in NCL under statin treatment after culprit PCI.",

The effects of statins (rosuvastatin) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors (meloxicam) on ALI were assessed by measuring inflammatory mediator levels in the serum and in the bronchoalveolar space.

Administration of rosuvastatin decreased significantly cytokine levels that were increased after the blunt chest trauma. Rosuvastatin increased the expression of inducible nitric oxide (iNOS), COX-2, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and prostaglandin E2 (PGE-2) in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of the rat contused lungs. Coadministration of meloxicam prevented these changes.",

    "95": "The current study aimed at the evaluation of, in vivo, the effect of omeprazole on the pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor. Omeprazole is an acid suppressant and CYP2C9, CYP3A4, and CYP2C19 substrate and inhibitor, as well as inhibitor of transporters (like P-gp). This was a randomized, open-label, 2-period, crossover study. Healthy male volunteers (N = 20), divided into 2 groups, were given single oral doses of rosuvastatin 40 mg either alone (treatment period I) or concomitantly with omeprazole 40-mg capsule (treatment period II). Plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin (rosuva) and its metabolite N-desmethyl rosuvastatin (NDM-rosuva) were quantified by a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method developed in our laboratory. An insignificant decrease (P > 0.05) has been observed in the values of maximum plasma concentrations, clearance, and half-life of rosuva, whereas an insignificant increase (P > 0.05) has been observed in the area under the plasma concentration-time curves from zero time to the last measurable concentration(Equation is included in full-text article.), that extrapolated to infinity (Equation is included in full-text article.), and mean residence time values after concomitant administration with omeprazole. Although omeprazole concomitant administration altered the pharmacokinetics of NDM-rosuva metabolite significantly, rosuva's very little metabolism (10%) suggests that these changes are of no clinical significance. Concomitant administration of omeprazole with rosuva did not alter the pharmacokinetics of rosuva in healthy volunteers. These data are consistent with other reported studies, indicating that rosuva is not a good candidate for metabolism-based drug-drug interactions. Therefore, rosuva can be administered safely along with omeprazole.",

The algorithm achieved 90% to 97% PPVs in identification of MACE cases as compared against physician review. By applying the algorithm to EMR data in BioVU, cases and controls were identified and used subsequently to replicate known associations with eight genetic variants. We replicated 6/8 previously reported genetic associations with cardiovascular diseases or lipid metabolism disorders.

These effects may be mediated through an anti-inflammatory effect of statins. The purpose of this pilot-study was to determine whether statins have an anti-inflammatory effect on the lungs of COPD patients. We conducted randomized, controlled, parallel group pilot-study to compare the effects of atorvastatin (n=12) or placebo (n=6) on lung inflammation in patients with mild to moderate COPD. The primary endpoint was change in CD45+ cells expression measured by immunohistochemistry and changes in expression of genes measured using microarrays in lung biopsy (TBB) samples before and after 12 weeks of treatment with atorvastatin 40 mg/day. All subjects had spirometry, lung volumes, diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO), St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), 6 minute walk distance (6 MWD), serum lipids, hs-CRP, induced sputum (IS), bronchoscopy and TBB carried out at baseline and after treatment. TBB specimens were processed for histology, immunohistochemistry and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) profiling. Seventeen subjects completed the study. There was a significant improvement in SGRQ with mean SGRQ decreased by 12 points after treatment with atorvastatin (P=0.012). Atorvastatin treatment produced a significant 34% reduction in sputum neutrophil count, and a 57% reduction in CD45+ cells in lung biopsies (expressed as integrated optical density -IOD; median IOD 62.51% before, 27.01% after atorvastatin treatment, P=0.008). In patients' lung tissue atorvastatin treatment produced downregulation of key genes involved in inflammatory processes, immune response, and leukocyte activation.

We have previously shown that protection from ventricular fibrillation (VF) due to prolonged treatment with these compounds was linked with modulation of myocardial connexin-43, which is responsible for myocardial electrical coupling and synchronisation. To elucidate further the antiarrhythmic potential of atorvastatin, melatonin, EPA and DHA we aimed to explore their acute anti-fibrillating effects and defibrillating efficacy. Experiments were conducted on isolated perfused heart preparation of adult male and female hypertriglyceridemic (HTG) rats when using atorvastatin, EPA and DHA, while melatonin was examined in hearts of old male and female guinea pigs. VF inducibility was tested in hearts pre-treated for 10 min with atorvastatin, EPA or DHA (15 \u03bcmol) or melatonin (50 \u03bcmol) and compared with non-pre-treated hearts. Sustained VF was induced in all untreated HTG rat hearts. In contrast, its incidence was reduced to 30% and 60% by atorvastatin, 70% and 75% by EPA, 60% and 60% by DHA in male or female rat hearts respectively. Moreover, bolus (150 \u03bcmol) of EPA and DHA administered directly to the fibrillating heart restored sinus rhythm in 6 of 6 hearts and atorvastatin in 4 of 6 hearts. Threshold to induce sustained VF was 21.7 \u00b1 3.8 mA in male and 38.3 \u00b1 2.9 mA in female guinea pig hearts. However, sustained VF was not possible to induce even by the strongest (50 mA) stimulus in the heart pre-treated with melatonin regardless the sex. In conclusion, atorvastatin, melatonin, EPA and DHA exhibit clear cut acute anti-fibrillating efficacy. Findings challenge to investigate expression of connexin-43, especially its phosphorylated status associated with connexin channel function, in acute conditions.",

We hypothesized that atorvastatin improves endothelial cell (EC) function and reduces inflammation in hypertensive rats with diabetes. Non-diabetic and streptozotocin-induced type 2 diabetic male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were treated with atorvastatin at 20 mg/kg/day. After five weeks, nitric oxide (NO) and peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)) were measured in aortic and glomerular endothelial cells. A tandem of nanosensors was used to simultaneously measure NO and ONOO(-) concentration and their ratio [NO]/[ONOO(-)] was monitored with a time resolution better than 10 \u03bcs and detection limit 1 nM. [NO]/[ONOO(-)] was applied as a marker of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) uncoupling, endothelial dysfunction and nitroxidative stress. Glucose, cholesterol, blood pressure (BP), and the cytokine RANTES were also measured. Diabetic SHR rats had elevated glucose (355 \u00b1 38 mg/dL), mean BP (172 \u00b1 15 mmHg), and plasma RANTES (38.4 \u00b1 2.7 ng/mL), low endothelial NO bioavailability and high ONOO(-). Maximal NO release measured 267 \u00b1 29 nM in aortic endothelium of SHR rats and 214 \u00b1 20 nM for diabetic SHR rats; [NO]/[ONOO(-)] was 0.88 \u00b1 12 and 0.61 \u00b1 0.08, respectively. [NO]/[ONOO(-)] ratios below one indicate a high uncoupling of eNOS, endothelial dysfunction and high nitroxidative stress. Atorvastatin treatment partially restored endothelial function by increasing NO level by 98%, reducing ONOO(-) by 40% and favorably elevating [NO]/[ONOO(-)] to 1.1 \u00b1 0.2 for diabetic SHR rats and 1.6 \u00b1 0.3 for SHR rats. The effects of atorvastatin were similar in glomerular endothelial cells and were partially reproduced by modulators of eNOS or NADPH oxidase. Atorvastatin had no significant effect on fasting glucose or total cholesterol levels but reduced mean BP by 21% and 11% in diabetic and non-diabetic animals, respectively. Atorvastatin also reduced RANTES levels by 50%. Atorvastatin favorably increased the [NO]/[ONOO(-)] balance, enhanced endothelial cytoprotective NO, decreased cytotoxic ONOO(-) and reduced BP, inflammation and RANTES levels in diabetic, hypertensive rats without altering cholesterol levels. These findings provide insights into mechanisms of restoration of endothelial function and vascular protection by atorvastatin in diabetes and hypertension.",

However, whether they have an effect on RA disease activity is controversial. This study aimed to investigate the effect of statins on disease activity in RA patients. A systematic literature review was performed using the MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, ISI WEB of Knowledge, Scopus, and Clinical Trials Register databases. Only prospective randomized controlled trials or controlled clinical trials comparing the efficacy of statins with placebo on adult RA patients were included. The efficacy was measured according to the ACR criteria, EULAR criteria, DAS28, HAQ score, ESR, or CRP. The Jadad score was used for quality assessment. The inverse variance method was used to analyze continuous outcomes. A fixed-effects model was used when there was no significant heterogeneity; otherwise, a random-effects model was used. For stability of results, we performed leave-one-study-out sensitivity analysis by omitting individual studies one at a time from the meta-analysis. Publication bias was assessed using Egger test. A total 13 studies involving 737 patients were included in the meta-analysis; 11 studies were included in the meta-analysis based on DAS28, while the other 2 studies were only included in the meta-analysis based on ESR or CRP. The standardized mean difference (SMD) in DAS28 between the statin group and the placebo group was -0.55 (95% CI [-0.83, -0.26], P\u200a=\u200a0.0002), with an I2 value of 68%.

    "114": "Although mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have a therapeutic potential for the repair of tissue injuries, their poor viability in damaged tissue limits their effectiveness. Statins can induce an increased production of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), which may prevent this detrimental effect in MSCs. We investigated the protective effect of statin-induced overexpression of HO-1 by examining changes in gene expression and function in MSCs after pitavastatin treatment. The relative expression of the HO-1 and endothelial nitric oxide synthase genes in MSCs was significantly increased after treatment with pitavastatin (MSCs). Immunocytological analysis showed that MSCs also stained with phospho-Akt. After exposure to oxidative stress, MSCs showed increased resistance to induced cell death compared with control MSCs. Under serum starvation conditions, MSCs treated with 1 \u03bcM pitavastatin showed enhanced cell proliferation and a marked increase in vascular endothelial growth factor production compared with control MSCs. Interestingly, MSCs showed enhanced tube formation under both normoxia and hypoxia.

CONCLUSION. Phagocytosis by macrophages of injected SPIONs results in a prolonged shortening of both T2 and T2* leading to hypointensity of macrophage-infiltrated tissues in contrast-enhanced MR images. SPIONs as contrast agents are therefore useful for the in vivo MRI detection of macrophage infiltration, and there is substantial research and clinical interest in the use of SPION-based contrast agents for MRI of infection and inflammation. This technique has been used to identify active infection in patients with septic arthritis and osteomyelitis; importantly, the MRI signal intensity of the tissue has been found to return to its unenhanced value on successful treatment of the infection. In SPION contrast-enhanced MRI of vascular inflammation, animal studies have shown decreased macrophage uptake in atherosclerotic plaques after treatment with statin drugs. Human studies have shown that both coronary and carotid plaques that take up SPIONs are more prone to rupture and that abdominal aneurysms with increased SPION uptake are more likely to grow. Studies of patients with multiple sclerosis suggest that MRI using SPIONs may have increased sensitivity over gadolinium for plaque detection. Finally, SPIONs have enabled the tracking and imaging of transplanted stem cells in a recipient host.", 
    "120": "Statin treatment in association with physical exercise practice can substantially reduce cardiovascular mortality risk of dyslipidemic individuals, but this practice is associated with myopathic event exacerbation. This study aimed to present the most recent results of specific literature about the effects of statins and its association with physical exercise on skeletal musculature. Thus, a literature review was performed using PubMed and SciELO databases, through the combination of the keywords \"statin\" AND \"exercise\" AND \"muscle\", restricting the selection to original studies published between January 1990 and November 2013. Sixteen studies evaluating the effects of statins in association with acute or chronic exercises on skeletal muscle were analyzed. Study results indicate that athletes using statins can experience deleterious effects on skeletal muscle, as the exacerbation of skeletal muscle injuries are more frequent with intense training or acute eccentric and strenuous exercises. Moderate physical training, in turn, when associated to statins does not increase creatine kinase levels or pain reports, but improves muscle and metabolic functions as a consequence of training. Therefore, it is suggested that dyslipidemic patients undergoing statin treatment should be exposed to moderate aerobic training in combination to resistance exercises three times a week, and the provision of physical training prior to drug administration is desirable, whenever possible.A associa\u00e7\u00e3o do tratamento medicamentoso por estatinas com a pr\u00e1tica de exerc\u00edcios f\u00edsicos pode reduzir substancialmente o risco de mortalidade cardiovascular de indiv\u00edduos dislipid\u00eamicos, por\u00e9m sua realiza\u00e7\u00e3o vem sendo associada \u00e0 exacerba\u00e7\u00e3o de quadros miop\u00e1ticos.

    "121": "Cholesterol homeostasis is strictly regulated through the modulation of HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol synthesis. Phosphorylation of HMGCR inactivates it and dephosphorylation activates it. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is the major kinase phosphorylating the enzyme. Our previous study found that thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) increased the hepatocytic HMGCR expression, but it was still unclear whether TSH affected hepatic HMGCR phosphorylation associated with AMPK. We used bovine TSH (bTSH) to treat the primary mouse hepatocytes and HepG2 cells with or without constitutively active (CA)-AMPK plasmid or protein kinase A inhibitor (H89), and set up the TSH receptor (Tshr)-KO mouse models. The p-HMGCR, p-AMPK, and related molecular expression were tested. The ratios of p-HMGCR/HMGCR and p-AMPK/AMPK decreased in the hepatocytes in a dose-dependent manner following bTSH stimulation. The changes above were inversed when the cells were treated with CA-AMPK plasmid or H89. In Tshr-KO mice, the ratios of liver p-HMGCR/HMGCR and p-AMPK/AMPK were increased relative to the littermate wild-type mice. Consistently, the phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, a downstream target molecule of AMPK, increased. All results suggested that TSH could regulate the phosphorylation of HMGCR via AMPK, which established a potential mechanism for hypercholesterolemia involved in a direct action of the TSH in the liver.",

    "126": "Intracranial aneurysm, as a common cause of cerebral hemorrhage, is often discovered when the aneurysm ruptures, causing subarachnoid hemorrhage. Unfortunately, the formation of cerebral aneurysm, which is associated with endothelial damage and macrophage migration, still cannot be prevented now. Tight junctions (TJs) open due to the disappearance of TJ proteins occludin and zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) in damaged endothelia, thus allowing macrophage migration and forming cerebral aneurysm. Therefore, cerebral aneurysm formation can be prevented by increasing TJs of the artery endothelium. Interestingly, statin, which can reduce saccular aneurysm, may prevent aneurysm formation through acting on different steps, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, angiotensin II (Ang II) significantly increased the permeability of human arterial endothelial cell (HAEC). Moreover, the distribution of ZO-1 in cell-cell junction area and the total expression in HAECs were significantly decreased by Ang II treatment. However, the abnormal distribution and decreased expression of ZO-1 and hyperpermeability of HAECs were significantly reversed by pretreatment with atorvastatin. Furthermore, Ang II-induced phosphorylations of MYPT1, LIMK and MLC2 were significantly inhibited with atorvastatin or Rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor (H1152) pretreatment. Knockdown of ROCK-II probably abolished Ang II-induced abnormal ZO-1 distribution and expression deficiency and hyperpermeability of HAECs. In conclusion, atorvastatin prevented Ang II-induced rupture of HAEC monolayers by suppressing the ROCK signaling pathway. Our results may explain, at least in part, some beneficial effects of statins on cardiovascular diseases such as intracranial aneurysm.",

In this study, the mice were divided into seven groups, with each group undergoing treatment for 3 weeks: the control group, group 1 was administered 100 \u03bcl of bleomycin, group 2 was administered simvastatin (5mg/kg/day), group 3 received pioglitazone (10mg/kg/day), group 4 received simvastatin (5mg/kg/day) 1h before bleomycin, group 5 received pioglitazone (10mg/kg/day) 1h before bleomycin, and group 6 was administered simvastatin (5mg/kg/day) and pioglitazone (10mg/kg/day) 1h before bleomycin. In group 2, dermal thickening, subcutaneous fat atrophy, degeneration of hair follicles, and thickening of cutaneous vessel walls were observed in addition to a significant increase in caspase-3 reaction, transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-\u03b21) expression, and hydroxyproline content. A reversal of the previous findings was markedly observed in group 6 compared with groups 4 and 5. We conclude that the concurrent administration of pioglitazone and simvastatin enhanced their beneficial effects in the reversal of bleomycin-induced changes in mice thin skin.",

In addition, when compared with insulin glargine, sitagliptin was less effective in decreasing glycosylated hemoglobin, but was associated with significantly lower rates of hypoglycemia. Further, trials have shown a beneficial effect of using statins in patients with diabetes mellitus with regard to decreasing cardiovascular risk, regardless of baseline lipid levels or the presence of a cardiac disease. Both medications have also demonstrated an acceptable side effect profile. However, caution is needed when coadministering with any drug that may increase simvastatin levels to reduce the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis.",

To investigate the relationship of wine consumption to CV risk markers, we studied a multi-ethnic sample of middle-aged, healthy women (N = 2900; 48% white, 28% black, 7% Hispanic, 8% Chinese, 9% Japanese) participating in SWAN over 7 years with repeated assessments of CV risk factors. Consumption of wine was stable and common with 20% reporting none, 69% light (<1/day), 7% moderate ( = 1/day), and 4% heavy (>1/day). To guard against underreporting, we took the maximum reported wine consumption over 7 years as the predictor. We used mixed models with a random intercept and random time to assess the relationship between wine consumption and CV risk factors with moderate consumption as the reference. Outcome variables were log-transformed where necessary. Longitudinal models were adjusted for ethnicity, age, and time-varying menopausal status, hormone therapy use, overall alcohol consumption, high density lipoprotein (HDL), statin use, and a healthy lifestyle score based on physical activity, not smoking, and weight maintenance. Interactions of wine consumption with time were not significant. Moderate wine consumers had significantly lower levels of C-reactive protein (CRP, p < .001), fibrinogen (p < .001), factor VII (p < .01), and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1, p < .05) than women who drank no or little wine.

We investigated whether the carotenoid bixin (BIX) may reduce oxidative damage, inflammatory response, and the atherosclerotic lesion induced by hypercholesterolemia in rabbits. Rabbits received regular chow (control) or a hypercholesterolemic diet (0.5% cholesterol) alone or supplemented with BIX (10, 30 or 100 mg/kg body weight, b.w.) or simvastatin (15 mg/kg b.w.) for 60 days. Treatment with BIX or simvastatin reduced the atherosclerotic lesions in cholesterol-fed rabbits (up to 55 and 96% reduction, respectively). This protective effect of BIX was accompanied by decrease in the levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha by 15%, interleukin 6 by 19%, lipid peroxidation by 60%, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) by 37%, and triglycerides by 41%. BIX increased by 160% the HDL-C levels and decreased by 67% the atherogenic index of hypercholesterolemic rabbits. In atherosclerotic rabbits, the non-protein thiol groups content and the activity of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione reductase, and thioredoxin reductase were increased in the aortic tissue, whereas paraoxonase activity was reduced in the serum. All these changes were completely prevented by BIX or simvastatin treatment. These results demonstrate that BIX reduces the extent of atherosclerotic lesions and this effect was associated with the decrease in oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and improvement of dyslipidemia, which were most effectively controlled after treatment with 10-30 mg BIX/kg b.w. BIX consumption may, therefore, be an adjuvant to prevent atherosclerosis reducing risk factors for coronary diseases.",

    "188": "Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) remains a condition with suboptimal functional outcomes, especially in the young population. Pharmacotherapy has an accepted role in several aspects of the disease and an emerging role in several others. No preventive pharmacologic interventions for SAH currently exist. Antiplatelet medications as well as anticoagulation have been used to prevent thromboembolic events after endovascular coiling. However, the main focus of pharmacologic treatment of SAH is the prevention of delayed cerebral ischemia (DCI). Currently the only evidence-based medical intervention is nimodipine. Other calcium channel blockers have been evaluated without convincing efficacy. Anti-inflammatory drugs such as statins have demonstrated early potential; however, they failed to provide significant evidence for the use in preventing DCI. Similar findings have been reported for magnesium, which showed potential in experimental studies and a phase 2 trial. Clazosentane, a potent endothelin receptor antagonist, did not translate to improve functional outcomes. Various other neuroprotective agents have been used to prevent DCI; however, the results have been, at best inconclusive. The prevention of DCI and improvement in functional outcome remain the goals of pharmacotherapy after the culprit lesion has been treated in aneurysmal SAH. Therefore, further research to elucidate the exact mechanisms by which DCI is propagated is clearly needed. In this article, we review the current pharmacologic approaches that have been evaluated in SAH and highlight the areas in which further research is needed.", 
    "189": "Feedback regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis provides a mechanism to adapt to varying cholesterol input while maintaining rather constant serum and tissue cholesterol levels. The molecular mechanisms by which this occurs have been the subject of extensive investigation. This review focuses on the physiological mechanisms by which this regulation occurs. In animals that are sensitive to dietary cholesterol such as Golden Syrian hamsters, feedback regulation occurs mainly at the level of transcription of hepatic HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase). In animals like the Sprague Dawley rat that are resistant to the serum cholesterol raising action of dietary cholesterol, regulation occurs mainly at the level of translation efficiency of hepatic HMG-CoA reductase. Oxylanosterols were shown to effectively decrease translation of HMG-CoA reductase mRNA. Dietary cholesterol acts to significantly lower transcription of squalene epoxidase and lanosterol 14\u03b1 demethylase favoring accumulation of the putative regulatory oxylanosterol-3\u03b2-hydroxylanosterol-8-en-32-al. Thus, decreased transcription of enzymes occurring late in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway appears to result in decreased translation of hepatic HMG-CoA reductase mRNA. These findings indicate that pronounced physiological feedback regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis in cholesterol resistant animals occurs at the level of translational efficiency without substantial reduction in hepatic HMG-CoA reductase transcription.", 
    "190": "Simvastatin is an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor commonly used in the clinic to treat hypercholesterolemia. In addition, simvastatin has been shown to cross the blood-brain barrier and pleiotropic effects of simvastatin have been reported including anti-inflammatory properties, enhancement of neurite outgrowth, and memory enhancement properties. However, little has been reported on the effects of simvastatin on basal synaptic transmission and neuronal excitability. Here we report that simvastatin increases the fEPSP, the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated fEPSP using extracellular recordings in the dendritic region of the CA1 of hippocampal slices taken from 8-week-old C57Black6J mice. In addition, we found that simvastatin perfusion causes a change in the input/output curve and a decrease of the paired-pulse facilitation ratio, indicating respectively an increase of the neuronal excitability and neurotransmitter release. We have also observed that acute application of simvastatin increased the amplitude of the compound action potential in the CA1 region. Notably, using LY294002, we have demonstrated that this effect was PI3K dependent and was occluded if the animals had previously received a diet supplemented with simvastatin. We have finally shown that the simvastatin-mediated increase of the compound action potential amplitude was also present in hippocampal slices from aged mice.",

Median postoperative follow-up was 7.8 years. Compared with patients not on statin therapy, patients taking statins at surgery had similar 10-year progression-free survival (80% vs. 79%; P = 0.56), cancer-specific survival (85% vs. 84%; P = 0.71), and overall survival (59% vs. 64%; P = 0.11).

    "195": "Statins are inhibitors of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, thereby inhibiting cell synthesis of cholesterol and isoprenoids. Moreover, several studies have been evaluating pleiotropic effects of statins, mainly because they present neuroprotective effects in various pathological conditions. However, knowledge about behavioral effects of statins per se is relatively scarce. Considering these facts, we aimed to analyze behavioral responses of atorvastatin or simvastatin-treated mice in the open field test, elevated plus maze and object location test. Atorvastatin treatment for 7 consecutive days at 1 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg (v.o.) or simvastatin 10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg enhanced cognitive performance in object location test when compared to control group (saline-treated mice). Simvastatin effects on mice performance in the object location test was abolished by post-training infusion of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol. Atorvastatin and simvastatin did not change the behavioral response in open field and elevated plus-maze (EPM) tests in any of the used doses. These data demonstrate the positive effects of both statins in cognitive processes in mice, without any alteration in locomotor parameters in the open field test or anxiolytic-like behavior in EPM. In conclusion, we demonstrate that atorvastatin and simvastatin per se improve the cognitive performance in a rodent model of spatial memory and this effect is related to beta-adrenergic receptors modulation.", 
    "196": "Background. Activation of the innate immune system by cholesterol accelerates atherosclerosis. High levels or modified forms of cholesterol stimulate release of the inflammatory cytokines IL-12 and IL-18 that synergistically stimulate T lymphocytes to produce the atherogenic cytokine interferon-\u03b3. While activation of the innate immune system by cholesterol is well-described in animal models and human subjects with high cholesterol levels or known atherosclerotic disease, the interaction of cholesterol and lipoproteins with the innate immune system in human subjects without known atherosclerosis is less well-described. The goal of our study was to assess the TH1 modulating cytokines IL-12 p40 and IL-18, and their counter regulatory cytokines IL-18 binding protein and IL-27, to determine if their levels are linked to cholesterol levels or other factors. Methods. We performed a blinded, randomized hypothesis-generating study in human subjects without known atherosclerotic disease. We measured serum lipids, lipoprotein levels, and collected plasma samples at baseline. Subjects were randomized to two weeks of therapy with atorvastatin, pravastatin, or rosuvastatin. Lipids and cytokine levels were measured after two weeks of statin treatment. Subjects were given a four-week statin-free period. At the end of the four-week statin-free period, venous blood was sampled again to determine if serum lipids returned to within 5% of their pre-statin levels. When lipid levels returned to baseline, subjects were again treated with the next statin in the randomization scheme. IL-12, IL-18, IL-18 binding protein, and IL-27 were measured at baseline and after each statin treatment to determine effects of statin treatment on their blood levels, and identify correlations with lipids and lipoproteins. Results. Therapy with statins revealed no significant change in the levels of IL-12, IL-18, IL-18 binding protein or IL-27 levels. We found that IL-18 levels positively correlate with total cholesterol levels (r (2) = 0.15, p < 0.03), but not HDL or LDL cholesterol. In contrast, IL-12 p40 levels inversely correlated with total cholesterol (r (2) = -0.17, p < 0.008), HDL cholesterol (r (2) = -0.22, p < 0.002), and apolipoprotein A1 (r (2) = -0.21, p < 0.002). Similarly, IL-18 binding protein levels inversely correlated with apolipoprotein A1 levels (r (2) = -0.13, p < 0.02). Conclusions. Our findings suggest that total cholesterol levels positively regulate IL-18, while HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A1 may reduce IL-12 p40 and IL-18 binding protein levels. Additional studies in a larger patient population are needed to confirm these findings, and verify mechanistically whether HDL cholesterol can directly suppress IL-12 p40 and IL-18 binding protein levels in human subjects.", 
    "197": "Diet is strongly associated with risk for first stroke. In particular, observational and experimental research suggests that a Mediterranean-type diet may reduce risk for first ischemic stroke with an effect size comparable to statin therapy. These data for first ischemic stroke suggest that diet may also be associated with risk for recurrent stroke and that diet modification might represent an effective intervention for secondary prevention. However, research on dietary pattern after stroke is limited and direct experimental evidence for a therapeutic effect in secondary prevention does not exist. The uncertain state of science in this area is reflected in recent guidelines on secondary stroke prevention from the American Heart Association, in which the Mediterranean-type diet is listed with only a class IIa recommendation (level of evidence C). To change guidelines and practice, research is needed, starting with efforts to better define current nutritional practices of stroke patients. Food frequency questionnaires and mobile applications for real-time recording of intake are available for this purpose. Dietary strategies for secondary stroke prevention are low risk, high potential, and warrant further evaluation.",

HRs for recurrent VTE were similar for concomitant use of rivaroxaban-statin and enoxaparin/VKA-statin. Major bleeding events occurred in 3.0 per 100 patient-years with statin use compared with 2.3 per 100 patient-years without statins (adjusted HR 0.77; 95% CI 0.46-1.29). Due to adjustments in the Cox regression model, the direction of this HR is in contrast to the crude comparison. In EINSTEIN Extension, no recurrent VTEs occurred with statin use in the rivaroxaban group compared with 1.6 per 100 patient-years without statins. In the placebo group, 12.2 recurrent VTEs occurred per 100 patient-years with statin use compared with 13.2 per 100 patient-years without (adjusted HR 0.81; 95% CI 0.35-1.86).",

Localized proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements showed a significant decrease in the concentration of N-acetylaspartate+N-acetylaspartylglutamate and myo-inositol in the D-galactose group compared to the control group, and, conversely, an increase of N-acetylaspartate+N-acetylaspartylglutamate in the D-galactose/Simvastatin group. Using a saturation transfer experiment, with phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we observed a significant elevation of the forward rate constant of the creatine kinase reaction in the brains of the D-galactose group compared to controls, and subsequently, a significant reduction of this reaction in the D-galactose/Simvastatin group. Spatial learning and memory were evaluated using the modified Morris water maze test. The dynamics of the learning process represented by the learning index revealed a significant reduction in learning in the D-galactose group, but the deficits as a consequence of the D-galactose effects were recovered in the D-galactose/Simvastatin group, in which the learning dynamics resembled those of the control group. By determining the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and total coenzyme Q9 in plasma, we have shown that long-term administration of D-galactose created conditions for oxidative stress, and that the administration of Simvastatin decreased oxidative stress in plasma. Volumetry analyses from the hippocampal area show a reduction in the segmented area in the D-galactose group, compared with the control group, and an enlarged area in the hippocampus in the d-galactose/Simvastatin group.",
