The objectives of this study were to determine the influence LPL mutations Asn291Ser and Ser447Ter on plasma lipid levels, regression and progression of CAD, clinical events rate, and response to fluvastatin therapy in the Lipoprotein and Coronary Atherosclerosis Study (LCAS) population. LCAS is a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study designed to test the influence of fluvastatin on progression or regression of CAD. The Asn291Ser and Ser447Ter genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction enzyme digestion. Fasting plasma lipid profiles were measured and quantitative coronary angiography was performed at baseline and 2.5 years following randomization. Fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events during the follow-up period were recorded. A total of 4% (14/363) and 18% (62/352) of the subjects had the Asn291Ser and Ser447Ter mutations, respectively. Overall, there was no statistically association between the Asn291Ser and Ser447Ter mutations and the baseline or final mean plasma levels of lipids, number of coronary lesions, total occlusions, the mean minimal lumen diameter (MLD) stenoses and the clinical events rate. However, patients with the Ser447Ter variant had a slightly higher baseline high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) level (46.2 +/- 12 vs 43.2 +/- 11, P = 0.057), less increase in plasma HDL levels in response to fluvastatin therapy (3 vs 11%, P = 0.056) and a higher cardiovascular events rate (23 vs 13%, P = 0.056). Thus, the Ser447Ter variant had a modest influence on plasma HDL levels and the rate of cardiovascular events. These changes were of borderline statistical significance. Neither the Ser447Ter nor the Asn291Ser mutation had a major impact on susceptibility to CAD, progression or regression of CAD, clinical events rate or response to fluvastatin therapy in LCAS population.", 
    "1": "Monoterpenes such as limonene and perillyl alcohol (PA) are currently under investigation for their chemotherapeutic properties which have been tied to their ability to affect protein isoprenylation. Because PA affects the synthesis of isoprenoids, such as ubiquinone, and cholesterol is the end product of the synthetic pathway from which this isoprenoid pathway branches, we investigated the effects of this compound upon cholesterol metabolism in the colonic adenocarcinoma cell line SW480. PA (1 mM) inhibited incorporation of 14C-mevalonate into 21-26 kDa proteins by 25% in SW480 cells. Cholesterol (CH) biosynthesis was assessed by measuring the incorporation of 14C-acetate and 14C-mevalonate into 27-carbon-sterols. Cells treated with PA (1 mM) exhibited a fourfold increase in the incorporation of 14C-acetate but not 14C-mevalonate into cholesterol. Mevinolin (lovastatin), an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA(HMG-CoA) reductase, at 2 microM concentration, inhibited CH synthesis from 14C-acetate by 80%. Surprisingly, concurrent addition of mevinolin and PA did not significantly alter the stimulatory effects of PA. As observed differences in 14C-acetate and 14C-mevalonate precursor labeling could indicate PA affects early pathway events, the effects of this monoterpene on HMG-CoA reductase activity were evaluated. Unexpectedly, 1 mM PA did not stimulate activity of this enzyme. Consistent with its action as a reversibly bound inhibitor, in washed microsomes, 2 microM mevinolin pretreatment increased reductase protein expression causing a 12.7 (+/- 2.4)-fold compensatory HMG-CoA reductase activity increase; concurrent treatment with 1 mM PA attenuated this to a 5.3 (+/- 0.03)-fold increase. Gas chromatographic analysis confirmed CH was the major lipid present in the measured thin-layer chromatography spot. Since 14C-acetate incorporation into free fatty acid and phospholipid pools was not significantly affected by PA treatment, nonspecific changes in whole acetate pool sizes were not indicated. Because increases in endogenous CH synthesis should result in compensatory changes in exogenous sterol utilization, the effects of PA upon low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor activity were evaluated. Consistent with the observed increases in CH synthesis, 1 mM PA decreased 125I-LDL internalization to 50% of the fetal bovine serum control; concurrent addition of 2 microM mevinolin attenuated this effect to a reduction of 80% of the control value. Data suggest that in certain colonic tumor cells PA strongly affects cholesterol metabolism via a mechanism of action that is insensitive to the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor mevinolin.", 
    "2": "Cholesterol synthesis inhibitors and fibrates both exercise effects that could influence BP and renal function in hypertension. To test this issue, transit-time ultrasound flow probes, implanted optical fibers, and laser-Doppler flowmetry were used for measurements of total and regional renal blood flows in lovastatin (40 mg/kg body wt) and bezafibrate (50 mg/kg body wt) chronically treated deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA)-salt hypertensive mice. Total renal blood flow was well autoregulated between 70 and 150 mmHg (approximately 3.5 ml/min per g kidney weight in DOCA-salt mice). Both lovastatin and bezafibrate increased renal blood flow to a range between 4.7 and 5.5 ml/min per g kidney weight. In the renal perfusion pressure ranges investigated, renal vascular resistance increased in lovastin- and bezafibrate-treated DOCA-salt mice, but not as steeply as in vehicle-treated DOCA-salt mice. During a stepwise increase in renal perfusion pressure in lovastatin-treated DOCA-salt mice, medullary blood flow increased up to 130% of baseline values, which was not seen in vehicle- or bezafibrate-treated mice. After extracellular volume expansion with 1% saline, 1 ml over 1 min, total renal blood flow was also higher in lovastatin- or bezafibrate-treated DOCA-salt mice, whereas medullary blood flow increased more steeply in lovastatin-, compared with bezafibrate- or vehicle-treated mice. Systemic BP was significantly decreased in lovastatin-treated DOCA-salt mice compared with vehicle-treated mice. Lovastatin prevented histologic evidence for hemostasis in the medullary circulation of DOCA-salt mice. The results suggest that both lovastatin and bezafibrate diminished DOCA-salt-induced reductions in total renal blood flow. Lovastatin also abolished the perturbed medullary blood flow reactions to increased perfusion pressure or to volume expansion. Finally, lovastatin decreased systemic BP in DOCA-salt mice. These data suggest that cholesterol synthesis inhibition or fibrate treatment improve disturbed renal function in a mouse model of salt-dependent hypertension.", 
    "3": "Reduction in plasma lipids has been recognized as one of the primary cardiovascular risk reduction strategies in the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD). The primary end points of TARGET TANGIBLE were the safety (adverse events and laboratory measurements) and efficacy (responder rates) of therapy with atorvastatin versus simvastatin with the aim of achieving low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol lowering to < or =100 mg/dl (2.6 mmol/L). A total of 3,748 CHD patients with LDL cholesterol levels > or =130 mg/dl (3.4 mmol/L) entered a run-in diet phase of 6 weeks without any lipid-lowering drug therapy. At the end of the diet phase, 2,856 patients met the lipid criteria and were randomized to active treatment for 14 weeks. Patients received 10 to 40 mg of either drug in an optional titration design at 2:1 randomization for atorvastatin versus simvastatin. Adverse event rates were statistically equivalent (p<0.01) for simvastatin (35.7%) and for atorvastatin patients (36.3%). Both drugs were well tolerated; <5% of patients in both groups were withdrawn due to adverse events. In all, 37 atorvastatin patients (2%) and 27 simvastatin patients (3%) had serious adverse events. Drug-related side effects (elevations in creatine kinase, liver enzymes) occurred in both groups at similar rates with 10 atorvastatin patients (0.5%) and 5 simvastatin patients (0.5%) presenting confirmed transaminase elevations >3 x the upper limit of the normal range. Significantly fewer patients in the atorvastatin group (n = 724) required titration to 40 mg compared with the simvastatin group (n = 514) (38% vs. 54%, respectively; p<0.001). Atorvastatin resulted in a significantly greater number of patients reaching the LDL cholesterol goal than those treated with simvastatin, with 67% of atorvastatin patients and 53% of simvastatin patients reaching the target LDL cholesterol level of < or =100 mg/dl (2.6 mmol/L) (p<0.001). Both atorvastatin and simvastatin are safe for use by patients in the secondary prevention of CHD, with patients in both drug groups having similar adverse event rates. Despite the use of concomitant medications there was no drug-induced rhabdomyolysis with either atorvastatin or simvastatin.", 
    "4": "HMG-CoA reductase is the key enzyme for the biosynthesis of isoprenoid compounds essential for cell growth and differentiation. Its tyrosine kinase-dependent modulation has recently been suggested and described in the ErbB-2 overexpressing cell line SKBR-3 [Asslan et al. (1998) Biochem. J. 330, 241-246]. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) increased the HMG-CoA reductase activity, protein, and mRNA levels only in ErbB-2-expressing cells (SKBR-3 and MCF-7) but not in MDA-MB-468 cells that do not express ErbB-2 even though their EGF receptor was efficiently phosphorylated. Tyrphostin AG 879, a specific inhibitor of ErbB-2 tyrosine kinase activity, decreased HMG-CoA reductase activity only in cells that expressed ErbB-2. A functional EGF receptor appeared to be necessary since its inhibition by the specific tyrphostin AG 1478 abolished the EGF effects. Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) might be a crucial enzyme in the signaling pathway since the specific inhibitor, LY 294002, was shown to inhibit HMG-CoA reductase activity and to completely abolish the stimulation by EGF in SKBR-3 cells.", 
    "5": "For tumor progression, a cascade of linked sequential biological events is essential. We tried to test whether biological therapy can modulate specific biological phenotypes and increase the anti-tumor effect when combined with chemotherapy. Five human gastric cancer cell lines (YCC-1, YCC-2, YCC-3, YCC-7, AGS) were used in these studies. Pentosan polysulfate (PPS) as a heparin-binding growth factor inhibitor, Tranexamic acid as a plasmin inhibitor, Lovastatin as an adhesion inhibitor and Adriamycin as a chemotherapeutic agent were selected. The effects of each drug on colony formation and tumor cell proliferation were evaluated by soft agar assay and cell proliferation assay, respectively to test direct anti-tumor effect. The expression of uPA, PAI-1 was determined by ELISA, while MMPs activity was evaluated by zymography. PPS suppressed the colony-forming activity as much as Adriamycin did, but it showed only cytostatic effects in cell proliferation assay. Migration capacity using Boyden chamber assay was more closely correlated with adhesive capacity than uPA or MMP-2 expression. The motility inhibitory effect of Tranexamic acid was observed in the YCC-7 cell line, which expressed all the required biological phenotypes for migration. In AGS, with high cell motility and adhesiveness, the adhesion was inhibited by Lovastatin and most of the inhibitory effect was recovered by Mevalonate. When PPS was combined with Adriamycin on the Adriamycin-resistant, midkine (MK) gene expressing YCC-7 cell line, the growth inhibition rate increased up to 84%, while that for a single treatment of PPS or Adriamycin was 40% and 22%, respectively (p=0.001). When we combined Tranexamic acid and Adriamycin, we observed the synergistic effect in YCC-3 and YCC-7, while no combined effect was found in YCC-1. The combination of Lovastatin and Adriamycin did not show any combined effects in any of the cell lines. In conclusion, a synergistic anti-proliferative effect (chemo-sensitization) with combined chemo-biotherapy was found in cancer cells with specific biological target, MK. The anti-motility effect was the greatest when the gastric cancer cells expressed all the specific biological phenotypes.", 
    "6": "Ischemia followed by reperfusion in the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) results in cardiac contractile dysfunction as well as cardiomyocyte injury. These deleterious effects are due in large part to endothelial dysfunction leading to the upregulation of cell adhesion molecules and subsequent neutrophil-endothelium interaction. At clinically relevant doses, simvastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, has been shown to lower serum cholesterol levels and normalize endothelial cell function. We wanted to test the effects of simvastatin on neutrophil-mediated cardiac dysfunction in a controlled model of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion.", 
    "7": "This study examines the effects of simvastatin in a neutrophil-dependent isolated perfused rat heart model of ischemia (I) (20 minutes) and reperfusion (R) (45 minutes) injury. Administration of simvastatin 25 micrograms/rat improved coronary flow and preserved left ventricular developed pressure (LVDP) and dP/dtmax, indexes of cardiac contractile function. Final LVDP was 95+/-5 mm Hg in I/R hearts perfused with PMNs and simvastatin, compared with 49+/-4 mm Hg in PMN-perfused I/R hearts receiving only vehicle (P<0.001). In addition, simvastatin significantly reduced PMN accumulation in the ischemic myocardium (P<0.01). In PMN-perfused rat hearts after I/R, simvastatin also significantly attenuated P-selectin expression, CD18 upregulation in rat PMNs, and PMN adherence to rat vascular endothelium. Significant, although less potent, effects were obtained with pravastatin.", 
    "8": "These results provide evidence that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are potent and effective cardioprotective agents that inhibit leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions and preserve cardiac contractile function and coronary perfusion after myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. Moreover, these effects are unrelated to the cholesterol-lowering action of this agent and appear to be mediated by enhanced endothelial release of NO.", 
    "9": "We evaluated the use of combination therapy (ciprofibrate 100 mg or bezafibrate 400 mg plus fluvastatin 40 mg) in 23 patients (n = 13 in the ciprofibrate group) with established cardiovascular disease. Both treatments achieved a significant (P< or =0.01) decrease in the total cholesterol (TC) (32 and 21%), triglycerides (TG) (53 and 46%) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (36 and 26%) levels and the TC/high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (42 and 31%) and LDL/HDL (46 and 35%) ratios. HDL levels were increased (19% for both treatment groups), but this rise only achieved significance (P=0.01) in the ciprofibrate group. Although the two patient groups were not strictly matched, the reduction in serum TC and LDL levels was greater with ciprofibrate (32 and 36%, respectively; P< or =0.001) than with bezafibrate (21 and 26%, respectively; P< or =0.01). There was a significant reduction in plasma fibrinogen levels (36.4 and 13.5% in the ciprofibrate and bezafibrate group, respectively). None of the patients reported myalgia or had abnormal creatine kinase activity or liver function tests. Combination therapy is worth considering in high-risk patients because of the advantages associated with this option. Combination therapy is competitively priced when compared with high doses of statins. An end-point-based trial is needed.", 
    "10": "The cholesterol lowering drug lovastatin, a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, blocks DNA synthesis and proliferation of thyrotropin (TSH) primed FRTL-5 rat thyroid cells. The blockade can be completely prevented and/or reversed by mevalonate and largely prevented and/or reversed by farnesol whereas cholesterol and/or other non-sterol mevalonate derivatives such as ubiquinone, dolichol or isopentenyladenosine are ineffective. TSH-dependent augmentation of cyclic-AMP and cAMP dependent differentiated functions, such as iodide uptake, are unaffected by lovastatin. 3H-Thymidine incorporation into DNA is also decreased by alpha-hydroxyfarnesyl-phosphonic acid, an inhibitor of protein farnesylation which mimicks the effect of lovastatin since it also leaves unaffected TSH stimulated iodide uptake. It is suggested that the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin affects cell proliferation mainly through inhibition of protein farnesylation which results in altered function proteins relevant for proliferation control, notably p21ras and/or other small GTPases.", 
    "11": "Medulloblastoma is a malignant cerebellar tumor usually manifesting in childhood. We have previously shown that blocking the mevalonate pathway with lovastatin, a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, inhibits medulloblastoma proliferation and induces apoptosis in vitro. The underlying mechanism may involve blocking post-translational modification of important mitogenic signal-transduction proteins. We show that p21 ras processing is blocked by lovastatin, suggesting that inhibition of isoprenylation may be important in lovastatin-induced apoptosis. To test this hypothesis, manumycin A, an antibiotic which inhibits farnesyl protein transferase and thus farnesylation, was administered to 4 medulloblastoma cell lines in vitro. We found that blocking protein farnesylation with manumycin A was followed by apoptosis in a time- and dose-dependent manner. However, cell death induced by manumycin A was uniformly more rapid and efficient, requiring only 12 to 24 hr of treatment, than lovastatin-induced apoptosis, which required 36 to 96 hr (depending on the cell line tested). In addition, unlike lovastatin, which caused cell-cycle arrest in G1 phase and HMG-CoA reductase gene up-regulation, manumycin A had no effect on the cell cycle and resulted in down-regulation of HMG-CoA reductase gene expression. In both lovastatin- and manumycin A-treated cells, cellular cysteine protease precursor (CPP32) was activated, confirming the occurrence of apoptosis.", 
    "12": "In order to test whether a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor has an anti-atherogenic activity, the effects of carvastatin, a newly developed potent inhibitor, and pravastatin were examined on the intimal thickening of the artery after the endothelial denudation induced by balloon catheter injury. Rabbits were divided into four groups; control, pravastatin-treated (20 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) and two of carvastatin-treated groups (10 or 20 mg kg(-1) day(-1)). Two weeks after balloon catheter injury, the areas of intima and media of the injured carotid arteries were determined, and the ratios of intima to media (I/M) were calculated as an index of intimal thickening. Average I/M ratios of the injured artery were 0.42+/-0.05 for control, 0.49+/-0.07 for pravastatin, 0.19+/-0.03 (10 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) and 0.20+/-0.04 (20 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) for carvastatin-treated rabbits, respectively. Thus, carvastatin reduced I/M ratio of the injured artery to approximately half versus control, but pravastatin failed to suppress the intimal thickening. For in vitro study, vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) from rabbit aorta were explanted, then cultured, and the effects of carvastatin on SMC migration and SMC proliferation were also examined. Carvastatin inhibited dose-dependently SMC migration and SMC proliferation with IC50 values of 0.5 microM and 1 microM, respectively. These inhibitory effects of carvastatin were cancelled by the coexistence of mevalonate, a metabolite of cholesterol synthesis. Our results suggest that carvastatin may be useful in rabbits as an anti-atherogenic drug by means of the inhibition of SMC migaration or SMC proliferation.",

A total of 2,245 patients underwent coronary revascularization before randomization including 1,154 patients with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) alone, 876 patients with coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) alone, and 215 patients with both procedures. Clinical events in revascularized patients were compared between patients on placebo and on pravastatin.",

Fatal or nonfatal MI was reduced by 3.3% (RR reduction 39%, 95% CI 16 to 55, p = 0.002), postrandomization repeat revascularization was reduced by 2.6% (RR reduction 18%, 95% CI 1 to 33, p = 0.068) and stroke was reduced by 1.5% (RR reduction 39%, 95% CI 3 to 62, p = 0.037) with pravastatin.

    "18": "Inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase are widely used in the treatment of dyslipemias and have shown beneficial effects in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases. However, regression studies with lipid-lowering drugs have not shown significant lesion reduction associated with the improvement in clinical events. Therefore, our objective has been to study whether treatment with a lipid-lowering drug of this family, atorvastatin, could reduce platelet deposition on the damaged vessel wall at different shear stress conditions, simultaneously with retardation of the development of atherosclerotic lesions. Using cholesterol-fed swine as the model, we found that atorvastatin significantly diminished platelet deposition on the mildly damaged vessel wall at high shear rates (50%, P<0.01), but it did not have any effect in preventing platelet deposition triggered by a severely injured vessel wall. Development of coronary lesions was also reduced by treatment. These findings suggest that atorvastatin may prevent platelet attachment to eroded vessels and hence, contribute to reducing the thrombotic risk associated with the erosions of the luminal surface and the platelet-dependent progression of atherosclerotic plaques.",

We randomly assigned the patients either to receive medical treatment with atorvastatin, at 80 mg per day (164 patients), or to undergo the recommended percutaneous revascularization procedure (angioplasty) followed by usual care, which could include lipid-lowering treatment (177 patients). The follow-up period was 18 months.", 
    "25": "Twenty-two (13 percent) of the patients who received aggressive lipid-lowering treatment with atorvastatin (resulting in a 46 percent reduction in the mean serum LDL cholesterol level, to 77 mg per deciliter [2.0 mmol per liter]) had ischemic events, as compared with 37 (21 percent) of the patients who underwent angioplasty (who had an 18 percent reduction in the mean serum LDL cholesterol level, to 119 mg per deciliter [3.0 mmol per liter]). The incidence of ischemic events was thus 36 percent lower in the atorvastatin group over an 18-month period (P=0.048, which was not statistically significant after adjustment for interim analyses). This reduction in events was due to a smaller number of angioplasty procedures, coronary-artery bypass operations, and hospitalizations for worsening angina. As compared with the patients who were treated with angioplasty and usual care, the patients who received atorvastatin had a significantly longer time to the first ischemic event (P=0.03).",

    "27": "Several clinical studies have shown that different types of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can reduce the cholesterol content of atherosclerotic blood vessels. The mechanism of this reduction is not established. One possibility is that NSAIDs affect low density lipoprotein (LDL) catabolism. In this study, we investigated the effect of the NSAIDs, indomethacin, flufenamic acid, ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and also acetylsalicylic acid on LDL binding, cell-association and degradation in cultured hepatoma HepG2 cells. LDL was labelled with 125I to study LDL catabolism. Furthermore, dextran sulphate, a substance that is known to release bound LDL from its receptors, was used to study LDL receptor activity. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to study the messenger RNA (mRNA) of LDL receptor. Our results show that flufenamic acid, indomethacin, and to a lesser extent ibuprofen, and acetaminophen increase LDL binding, cell-association, and degradation. Flufenamic acid was most potent and increased LDL catabolism by 50-70%, whereas acetylsalicylic acid had only a modest effect. Also, flufenamic acid and indomethacin were both found to increase the synthesis of mRNA of the LDL receptor with a subsequent increase of LDL receptor protein. We also investigated the effect of indomethacin on LDL binding in the presence of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitor, fluvastatin. We found that both indomethacin and fluvastatin had an additive up-regulatory effect on LDL receptor activity. In addition the effect of flufenamic acid on cell-associated LDL was examined in the presence of cyclosporine, which is known to decrease LDL catabolism. The results show that flufenamic acid can restore the inhibitory effect of cyclosporine. The study thus shows that NSAIDs enhance LDL catabolism due to increased synthesis of the mRNA for LDL receptor protein. This action might contribute to the lipid-lowering effect of NSAIDs.", 
    "28": "In the past 3 years, treatment for HIV infection has significantly improved the prognosis for HIV-infected persons. The administration of protease inhibitors for the treatment of HIV infection has had a significant role in the reduction of AIDS-related complications. Recent findings have indicated that protease inhibitors may significantly increase lipids to levels that pose a health risk that may be greater than the illness itself. This article reviews the initial findings of a study that investigated the impact of interventions for the treatment of protease inhibitor-related hyperlipidemia. The purpose of the study was to determine if initiation of interventions based on the National Cholesterol Education Program Guidelines would be effective in lowering protease inhibitor-related hyperlipidemia without disrupting the effectiveness of the HIV therapy. A total of 45 HIV-infected individuals who were taking a protease inhibitor and had abnormally elevated lipids were enrolled into this study. Mean serum cholesterol level prior to initiation of a protease inhibitor regimen was 170 mg/dl as compared to a mean cholesterol at time of enrollment of 289 mg/dl and triglycerides of 879 mg/dl. Interventions included diet and exercise and the prescription of gemfibrozil alone or in combination with atorvatstatin. During the course of the study, overall intervention significantly reduced serum cholesterol level to 201 mg/dl (p. 01) over a study period of ten months. Case studies of five medical events related to hyperlipidemia are included. Currently, 26 participants continue in the study. Sixteen participants discontinued protease inhibitor therapy during the course of the study and thus ended their participation.", 
    "29": "In this paper we present the finding that lovastatin arrests cells by inhibiting the proteasome, which results in the accumulation of p21 and p27, leading to G1 arrest. Lovastatin is an inhibitor of hydroxymethyl glutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis. Previously, we reported that lovastatin can be used to arrest cultured cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, resulting in the stabilization of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) p21 and p27. In this report we show that this stabilization of p21 and p27 may be the result of a previously unknown function of the pro-drug, beta-lactone ring form of lovastatin to inhibit the proteasome degradation of these CKIs. The lovastatin mixture used in this study is 80% open-ring form and 20% pro-drug, beta-lactone form. We show that while the lovastatin open-ring form and pravastatin (a lovastatin analogue, 100% open ring) inhibit the HMG-CoA reductase enzyme, lovastatin pro-drug inhibits the proteasome but does not inhibit HMG-CoA reductase. In addition, many of the properties of proteasome inhibition by the pro-drug are the same as the specific proteasome inhibitor lactacystin. Lastly, mevalonate (used to rescue cells from lovastatin arrest) unexpectedly abrogates the lactacystin and lovastatin pro-drug inhibition of the proteasome. Mevalonate increases the activity of the proteasome, which results in degradation of the CKIs, allowing lovastatin- and lactacystin-arrested cells to resume cell division. The lovastatin-mediated inhibition of the proteasome suggests a unique mechanism for the chemopreventative effects of this agent seen in human cancer.", 
    "30": "Thirty-one renal transplant recipients, submitted to treatment with cyclosporin in association with other immunosuppressive agents, were also treated for 9 months with two hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, simvastatin (10 mg/day) or pravastatin (20 mg/day), for concomitant hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia. Both drugs significantly decreased total cholesterol and triglyceride serum levels, but they did not modify whole-blood trough concentrations of polyclonal and monoclonal cyclosporin or polyclonal/monoclonal cyclosporin ratio. No alterations of the clinical and laboratory parameters investigated were found. The results of this study show the efficacy and safety of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors in the treatment of hyperlipidemia in kidney transplant patients.",

Nevertheless, intensive lipid lowering with drug combinations can attain the recommended target lipid levels in 66% of subjects with diabetes. With this strategy the plasma lipoprotein composition shifts towards a less atherogenic profile. Subjects with diabetes should therefore receive lipid-lowering therapy tailored to reach target levels, rather than standard dosages, in order to reduce atherogenic risk.",

Considering the scarcity of therapeutic resources against metastasis, our objective was to study LOV as an antimetastatic agent on L-TACB rat lymphoma, which as a syngeneic tumor model resembles more closely the situation in human cancer. We also aimed to analyze the effect of LOV on chemoinvasion, motility, metalloproteases secretion, angiogenic capacity, and adhesion to the reconstituted basement membrane Matrigel. Our results showed that LOV caused no effect on cell motility, metalloprotease secretion and neovascularization. Conversely, LOV produced a significant inhibition of invasiveness, which could be a consequence of an impaired cell adhesion to the basement membrane observed. These effects could explain, at least in part, the inhibitory action of LOV on L-TACB rat lymphoma metastases.",

Neither the specialized resources available in a lipid clinic nor protocols designed to improve tolerance to therapy reduced the high drug discontinuation rate. Unless more tolerable niacin and sequestrant formulations become available, reliance on statins as the preferred cholesterol-lowering agents will continue because they have fewer side effects and lower discontinuation rates.", 
    "46": "Statins are hypolipidemic drugs which not only improve cholesterol but also triglyceride levels. Whereas their cholesterol-reducing effect involves inhibition of de novo biosynthesis of cellular cholesterol through competitive inhibition of its rate-limiting enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase, the mechanism by which they lower triglycerides remains unknown and forms the subject of the current study. Treatment of normal rats for 4 days with simvastatin decreased serum triglycerides significantly, whereas it increased high density lipoprotein cholesterol moderately. The decrease in triglyceride concentrations after simvastatin was caused by a reduction in the amount of very low density lipoprotein particles which were of an unchanged lipid composition. Simvastatin administration increased the lipoprotein lipase mRNA and activity in adipose tissue and heart. This effect on lipoprotein lipase was accompanied by decreased mRNA as well as plasma levels of the lipoprotein lipase inhibitor apolipoprotein C-III. These results suggest that the triglyceride-lowering effect of statins involves a stimulation of lipoprotein lipase-mediated clearance of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins.",

It remains unproven whether this is mediated by inhibition of cholesterol synthesis. Therefore, the effect of a long-term administration of pravastatin on cholesterogenesis and on biliary lipid secretion was investigated in seven healthy volunteers. Placebo or 40 mg of pravastatin were taken daily at bedtime for 5 weeks using a double-blind crossover design. During the last week, 12 hours after the last drug intake 0.04 mmol [1-13C]acetate/kg. h and 0.5 g polyethylene glycol 4,000/h were infused intraduodenally for 15 hours. Plasma and duodenal bile samples were collected hourly. Thereafter, the decay of [13C]labeled plasma cholesterol was measured during the following 3 days. The fractional and absolute syntheses of plasma and biliary cholesterol were determined by gas chromatography mass spectrometry using mass isotopomer distribution analysis. At the end of the pravastatin period plasma total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol had decreased by 20% and 24%, respectively. Similarly, pravastatin suppressed biliary secretion rates of cholesterol, total bile acids and phospholipids (P <.05) by 46%, 36%, and 51%. As a consequence, cholesterol saturation index remained unchanged. However, fractional syntheses of cholesterol were comparable (P >.05) on placebo compared with pravastatin with 3.1% versus 4.0% in plasma and 4.3% versus 5.2% in bile after 15 hours, respectively. The mean absolute synthesis rates amounted to 0.3 mg/kg/h on placebo versus 0.4 on pravastatin (P >. 05). In conclusion, the pravastatin-induced reduction of biliary cholesterol secretion is not directly related to an inhibition of cholesterol synthesis.",

Each patient was mailed a survey for determining risk factors for coronary heart disease (CHD) and NCEP-recommended low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol goal and was asked to provide a fasting blood sample for determination of lipid profile, liver function, and serum creatine phosphokinase concentration. The patients were asked to make a follow-up laboratory visit six to seven weeks after they had started taking simvastatin. The percentage change from baseline and the percentage of patients who meet their LDL cholesterol goal before and after the conversion will be determined. A total of 1115 patients were converted to simvastatin. Only 35.4% of patients taking pravastatin to prevent a second CHD-related event met or exceeded their LDL cholesterol goal. Only 36.2% of patients with two or more CHD risk factors who were taking pravastatin for primary prevention met or exceeded their LDL cholesterol goal.

    "60": "Evidence from epidemiological and clinical studies continues to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of coronary heart disease (CHD). However, despite major advances in the development of diagnostic methods and effective treatment, CHD remains the leading cause of mortality in the Western world. That cholesterol lowering is of major importance in lowering the risk of developing coronary artery disease (CAD) is now an accepted principle in medicine. Most patients with CAD will require drug therapy to achieve target lipid levels. Subgroup analyses of data from the landmark statin trials show that this benefit is seen in all patient groups: male and female, older and younger patients, diabetics and non-diabetics, and patients with and without myocardial revascularization. Recent evidence suggests that the extent to which cholesterol is lowered is also important and that the attainment of reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels is associated with greater reductions in the risk of cardiovascular events. Unfortunately, data from studies to date do not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether there is a benefit in lowering cholesterol to very low levels.", 
    "61": "Current treatment strategies and disease management programs for hyperlipidemia employ a range of lipid-lowering drugs. Results from early lipid-lowering trials using diet, fibrates, niacin and other classes of drug showed that lowering plasma cholesterol can significantly reduce the risk of developing ischemic cardiovascular events. The landmark statin trials have clearly demonstrated the benefits of lipid-lowering therapy in coronary heart disease (CHD) prevention and unlike early lipid-lowering studies, a reduction in mortality may become evident with statin therapy during the first year of treatment. The number of successful lipid-intervention trials continues to increase and evidence is accumulating that lipid modification can also reduce the risk of cardiovascular events among individuals with only modest degrees of blood-lipid abnormalities. With increasingly powerful drugs to modify blood lipids, the potential levels at which to initiate treatment and the appropriate target levels are rapidly changing and debate surrounds the question of where the line to initiate treatment should be drawn. The relative lack of major adverse events with statin therapy means that the level of CHD risk at which clinical benefit occurs cannot be determined by the degree of risk at which benefit exceeds adverse events. Therefore, patients with only moderately raised cholesterol levels can be treated because statin treatment is well tolerated. One of the most important aspects of the statin trials is the finding that clinical events, such as death and disability due to coronary artery disease, may be preventable or limited in a significant number of patients if they receive aggressive therapy. Current goals for cholesterol levels in patients with established CHD are rarely achieved with non-aggressive treatment; however, with aggressive lipid lowering statins can achieve these goals in a safe and effective manner.", 
    "62": "Lovastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor produced by the fungus Aspergillus terreus, is composed of two polyketide chains. One is a nonaketide that undergoes cyclization to a hexahydronaphthalene ring system and the other is a simple diketide, 2-methylbutyrate. Fungal polyketide synthase (PKS) systems are of great interest and their genetic manipulation should lead to novel compounds.", 
    "63": "An A. terreus mutant (BX102) was isolated that could not synthesize the nonaketide portion of lovastatin and was missing a approximately 250 kDa polypeptide normally present under conditions of lovastatin production. Other mutants produced lovastatin intermediates without the methylbutyryl sidechain and were missing a polypeptide of approximately 220 kDa. The PKS inhibitor cerulenin reacted covalently with both polypeptides. Antiserum raised against the approximately 250 kDa polypeptide was used to isolate the corresponding gene, which complemented the BX102 mutation. The gene encodes a polypeptide of 269 kDa containing catalytic domains typical of vertebrate fatty acid and fungal PKSs, plus two additional domains not previously seen in PKSs: a centrally located methyltransferase domain and a peptide synthetase elongation domain at the carboxyl terminus.", 
    "64": "The results show that the nonaketide and diketide portions of lovastatin are synthesized by separate large multifunctional PKSs. Elucidation of the primary structure of the PKS that forms the lovastatin nonaketide, as well as characterization of blocked mutants, provides new details of lovastatin biosynthesis.", 
    "65": "The primary objective of the present study was to investigate the cholesterol-lowering effect of fluvastatin on the incidence of cardiac events in hyperlipidaemic patients with symptomatic, clinically-diagnosed (exercise-ECG) coronary heart disease (CHD) during 1 year of treatment. Exercise tolerance, incidence of angina pectoris episodes, use of anti-anginal medication and intimal-medial-thickness (IMT subgroup) of the A. carotis were secondary endpoints. In the double-blind trial a total of 365 male and female patients with stable symptomatic CHD and a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) above 160 mg/dl on a lipid-lowering diet were randomised to fluvastatin 40 mg (o.a.d. or b.i.d.) or placebo for 1 year. Fluvastatin lowered total cholesterol by 17% and LDL-C by 27%. There was a significantly lower incidence of cardiac events (cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, unstable angina pectoris) in the fluvastatin group (3 events) as compared to the placebo group (10 events) (P < 0.05). Exercise tolerance improved and the incidence of angina pectoris episodes decreased in both groups, but more pronounced on fluvastatin (n.s.). Exercise-ECG discontinuation due to angina pectoris and ST-segment depression decreased in the fluvastatin group by 55.6 and 70.9%, respectively, and in the placebo group by 39.6 and 46.5% (n.s.). At baseline, a subgroup of 76 patients showed a mean IMT value of 0.73 mm which remained uninfluenced in the fluvastatin and the placebo groups. Fluvastatin was safe and well tolerated. In conclusion, patients with symptomatic CHD get cardiovascular benefit from lipid-lowering therapy with fluvastatin even during the first year of treatment.", 
    "66": "Monocytes are recruited as the principal inflammatory cells into the atherosclerotic lesion. In a previous study we demonstrated that a low HDL-cholesterol and the apo E4 allele are associated with an increased proportion of blood monocytes that are characterized by a high expression of Fcgamma-RIIIa (CD16), a dim expression of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) receptor (CD14) and a high expression of beta1- and beta2-integrins (Rothe et al. Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Cell Biol 1996;16:1437-1447). In this study, 79 hypercholesterolemic patients were treated either with the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor fluvastatin in combination with diet or with placebo and diet in a double-blind and randomized multicenter study, and monitored for the potential effects on the phenotype of peripheral blood monocytes. At baseline, in the whole group of hypercholesterolemic patients the population size of these more mature monocytes (CD14dimCD16+) was positively correlated to triglyceride (P = 0.003) and total serum cholesterol levels (P = 0.012) confirming our previous study. Fluvastatin treatment for 52 weeks was associated with a 24.2% reduction in LDL-cholesterol (P < 0.001) as well as a 40.7% decrease in the expression density of CD14 on all monocytes (P = 0.027). A 24.5% decrease (P < 0.001) of the population of less differentiated CD14brightCD16- monocytes and an 83.1% increase (P = 0.029) of the population of more differentiated CD14dimCD16+ monocytes further confirmed this modification of the phenotype of peripheral blood monocytes. The positive pre-study correlation of the CD14dimCD16+ monocyte subset to the serum cholesterol concentration, but inverse changes of both parameters under fluvastatin therapy, in conclusion indicate that fluvastatin exerts an as yet uncharacterized immunomodulatory effect on either monocyte maturation and differentiation, or extravasation which may also depend on the endothelial phenotype that is independent of the change in serum lipids.", 
    "67": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, such as pravastatin, are widely used as lipid lowering drugs in hypercholesterolemia. Pravastatin does not only reduce the atherogenic low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, but is also increasing high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol. However, the mechanism leading to an increase of HDL are unclear. Therefore, the effects of pravastatin on the in vivo kinetics of apolipoprotein (apo) A-I were studied in six normolipidemic subjects and in a patient with coronary artery disease (CAD) utilizing stable isotope tracer techniques. Two turnover studies were performed. The first turnover study was carried out before any drug treatment, the second study after 6 weeks of 40 mg pravastatin/day. Three times deuterium labeled L-leucine (3D-leucine) was given as a primed bolus constant infusion (bolus: 1340 microg/kg; infusion: 22 microg/kg per h), and tracer uptake into HDL apoA-I was determined by gas chromatography (GC)-mass-spectrometry (MS). In the healthy subjects HDL-cholesterol increased by 13% and apoA-I increased by 12% under pravastatin treatment. The HDL in the CAD patient decreased by 3% and apoA-I increased by 2%. Prior to drug treatment the mean apoA-I fractional synthetic rate (FSR) was 0.194 per day (S.D. +/- 0.02) and apoA-I production rate (PR) was 10.8 mg/kg per day (S.D. +/- 2.1). The CAD patient had a FSR of 0.219 per day and a PR of 10.6 mg/kg per day. After treatment with pravastatin the mean apoA-I FSR was 0.204 per day (S.D. +/- 0.02) and apoA-I PR was 12.5 mg/kg per day (S.D. +/- 1.5) in the healthy subjects. Despite only minor changes of HDL and apoA-I in the CAD patient, there were significant changes of FSR (0.267 per day) and PR (13.1 mg/kg per day) with pravastatin treatment. The in vivo kinetic data demonstrate an increased FSR of apoA-I. The increase in apoA-I is due to an increased PR of apoA-I. This study demonstrates increased production of HDL apoA-I as the metabolic cause of the increase in HDL and apoA-I levels under inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase in man.", 
    "68": "Endothelial-derived nitric oxide (NO) is an important mediator of vascular function. Clinical studies indicate that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) improve endothelial function and reduce the incidence of stroke and myocardial infarction. Treatment of human endothelial cells with statins increased the expression of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) protein and mRNA expression. Statins increased eNOS mRNA half-life but did not change eNOS gene transcription. Inhibition of mevalonate synthesis by statins not only blocks the formation of cholesterol but also of isoprenoids. The upregulation of eNOS expression by statins was independent of cholesterol but mediated via the inhibition of the isoprenoid geranylgeraniol, whereas farnesiol had no effect on eNOS. Immunoblot analyses, (35S)-GTP gamma S-binding assays and transfection studies revealed that statins upregulate eNOS expression by blocking the geranylgeranylation of the GTPase Rho which is necessary for its membrane-associated activity. Studies with mice showed, that statin treatment upregulates eNOS expression and function independent of serum cholesterol levels. Prophylactic treatment with statins augmented cerebral blood flow and reduced cerebral infarcts in normocholesterolemic mice. These effects of statins were completely absent in eNOS-deficient mice indicating that enhanced eNOS activity by statins is the predominant mechanism by which these agents protect against cerebral injury. Our results suggest that statins provide a novel prophylactic treatment strategy for increasing blood flow and reducing brain injury during cerebral ischemia. Upregulation of eNOS by inhibiting Rho may provide a new pharmacologic target for the treatment of arteriosclerosis, pulmonary hypertension, and heart failure.",

Both compounds inhibited clonogenic colony formation of neuroblastoma cells in soft agar. However, while the addition of mevalonate, the product of HMG-CoA-reductase, circumvented the inhibition by lovastatin it had no reversing effect on the inhibition by L-ascorbic acid.

    "74": "The addition of 1% lovastatin (LVT) to hypercholesterolemic diets [1% cholesterol or 1% cholesterol plus 0.1% sodium deoxycholate (HD)] induced hepatic damage and was lethal to CD-1 mice in the first days of treatment; the females were more resistant than males. LVT or HD administered alone was harmless to male or female mice. After a 3-day treatment all groups that received LVT (1%, 0.1% or 0.05%) plus HD showed a higher percentage of liver weight, with respect to whole body weight. Cholesterol serum levels increased in males with HD, but remained low in female mice. In the liver, total lipids and cholesterol levels increased in male mice with HD, but cholesterol remained unchanged in females. The addition of LVT to HD prevented the increase of serum and liver cholesterol levels in male mice. These results allow us to propose the CD-1 male-mouse as a model to evaluate the toxicity of LVT or other vastatins.",

    "80": "It has earlier been suggested that postoperative thrombocytosis frequently occur after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and may be linked to lipid disturbances. A prospective randomized study was undertaken to evaluate if preoperative lipid-control, using HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor (Zocor), simvastatin, reduces the risk of postoperative thrombocytosis.", 
    "81": "Seventy-seven patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease and hypercholesterolemia (total cholesterol > or =6.2 mmol/l), planned for CABG where randomly assigned to; undergo CABG without preoperation lipid control (group I, n = 37) or undergo simvastatin-treatment (20 mg daily) to control their lipids (4 weeks) prior to CABG (group II, n = 40).", 
    "82": "Patient characteristics and operation data did not differ between the groups. Serum-cholesterol, cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, Apolipoprotein A1 and Plasminogen were all significantly higher in group I patients compared with group II just prior to surgery. Other laboratory parameters did not differ.", 
    "83": "In group II, total cholesterol and cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol quota were significantly lowered by simvaststin (-2 and -29%, respectively). Postoperative thrombocytosis (platelet counts > or =400000/microl) occurred significantly more frequently in group I 81% (30/37) compared with 3% (1/40) in group II, P<0.0001. Myocardial infarction after the 7th postoperative day was more often diagnosed in group I, 14 vs. 0% in group II. Postoperative transient renal failure occurred also more frequently in group I, 24% compared with 8% in group II. Other postoperative complications and laboratory data did not differ.", 
    "84": "This study once again underlines the importance of lipid control using HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors (e.g. Zocor) in patients with established coronary artery disease. For the first time it is shown that lipid-control with simvastatin prior to CABG reduces the risk of postoperative thrombocytosis, thus lowers the risk for thrombotic complications.", 
    "85": "A method for simultaneous quantitation of both the acid and lactone forms of atorvastatin, a new synthetic inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase that is being marketed for the treatment of high serum cholesterol, and both the acid and lactone forms of its two biotransformation products, 2-hydroxyatorvastatin and 4-hydroxyatorvastatin, in human serum (a total of six analytes) by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrospray tandem mass spectrometry was developed and validated. A deuterium labeled analog was used as internal standard for each of the six analytes. Each point of the calibration standard curve, which ranged from 0.5 to 200 ng/mL, contained the six analytes at equal concentrations. Three groups of quality control (QC) samples were used. In the first group, combination QC samples contained all six analytes at equal concentrations. In the second group, acid-only QC samples contained only the acid forms (i.e. three analytes) at equal concentrations. In the third group, lactone-only QC samples contained only the lactone forms (i.e. three analytes) at equal concentrations. After adding the internal standard to 0.5 mL of each standard and the QC sample kept at 4 degrees C, the samples were acidified with sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.0) and then extracted with methyl tert-butyl ether. Detection was by positive ion electrospray tandem mass spectrometry using eight selected reaction monitoring channels. The acid compounds were stable in human serum at room temperature but the lactone compounds were unstable as they hydrolyzed rapidly to their respective acid forms. The conversion of the lactone compounds in both QC and post-dose human serum samples was nearly complete after 24 h at room temperature. The lactone compounds in serum could be stabilized by lowering the working temperature to 4 degrees C or lowering the serum pH to 6.0. The acid-only and the lactone-only QC samples showed that, under the sample processing conditions used, the degree of the hydrolysis of the lactone compounds or the lactonization of the acid compounds during the assay procedure was minimal (< 5%). The intra-day C.V., inter-day C.V. and the deviations from the nominal concentrations for all six analytes were within 15%, demonstrating good precision and accuracy. The required lower limit of quantitation (LLQ) of 0.5 ng/mL was achieved for each analyte.",

The training involved a circuit using various ergometers, with continuous monitoring of pulse rate, at an exercise intensity of 2 to 3 mmol/L lactate. The control group (n = 6) received no drug treatment; they completed the training programme only. The pretreatment group (n = 6) comprised participants who had already been treated with fluvastatin 20 mg/day for at least 3 months before beginning the training programme. The treatment group (n = 6) received fluvastatin 20 mg/day from the beginning of the training programme. All participants were required to comply with the exercise programme and with a standardised carbohydrate-loaded diet together with restriction of alcohol consumption to a maximum of 20 ml/day.", 
    "90": "In the control group, increased physical activity alone reduced serum triglyceride (TG) levels (-24.7%) and increased serum high density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) levels (+19.3%). There was a smaller effect on serum low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels (-12.8%). Similar but smaller effects were observed in the pretreatment group (i.e. patients previously treated with fluvastatin): TG -12.88%, HDL-C +13.81%, LDL-C -8.7%. Marked changes were observed in the treatment group: TG -33.1%, HDL-C +34.7%, LDL-C -40.5%, total cholesterol -30.5%.", 
    "91": "A reduction of serum LDL-C level in the target range of -30 to -40% cannot be achieved by this intensity of training alone. In combination with fluvastatin 20 mg/day, however, the positive effects on lipid metabolism are potentiated. Thus, treatment with fluvastatin combined with moderate endurance training is a rational mode of therapy, particularly in patients with a highly pathological lipid profile.",

In the present study, the role of Ras signal transduction pathway in alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) gene expression was evaluated in HuH-7 human hepatoma cells using simvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, which blocks Ras function through inhibition of farnesylation, and the ras(val-12) expression vector.", 
    "95": "The HuH-7 cells were treated with simvastatin (10 micromol/l), or both simvastatin and mevalonate (300 micromol/l), and numbers of viable cells were counted after treatment. To elucidate the effects of simvastatin on AFP gene expression and the interactive effect of simvastatin on Ras signal transduction pathway, Northern blotting and transient chloramphenicol acetyltransferase plasmid transfection assays were performed.", 
    "96": "Cell growth was inhibited by simvastatin, and this growth inhibition was restored by addition of mevalonate. Levels of AFP mRNA but not albumin mRNA were elevated by simvastatin in a dose-dependent manner (1-10 micromol/l). AFP promoter and enhancer activities were stimulated by simvastatin. In contrast, both activities were repressed by transfection with the ras(val-12) expression vector. The ras(val-12)-mediated repression was restored by simvastatin and returned to the repressed level by simvastatin plus mevalonate.", 
    "97": "These results indicate that the Ras signal transduction pathway functions to down-regulate the AFP gene transcription in human hepatoma cells.", 
    "98": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are effective in primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. The mechanism of action is mainly attributed to their plasma cholesterol lowering activity, although additional effects have been suggested. Our objective was to study whether atorvastatin and simvastatin exhibited an inhibitory effect on platelet deposition onto a triggering damaged vessel wall in addition to an antiatherosclerotic effect in the dyslipemic rabbit model. Statins were administered at identical doses of 2.5 mg/kg/day with a hyperlipidemic diet during 10 weeks. Both drugs similarly lowered total cholesterol and, moderately, triglycerides. Mural platelet deposition on damaged vessel wall placed in an ex-vivo flow perfusion system was reduced in atorvastatin treated animals (39.7+/-6.2 X 10(6) PLT/cm2) vs. controls (94.8+/-15.9 x 10(6) PLT/cm2, p <0.02). Simvastatin reduced aortic fatty streak surface coverage (31,7+/-5.3%) vs. controls (47.9+/-4.1%, p <0.005) and intimal thickening in thoracic aorta (0.15+/-0.05 intima to total area ratio in simvastatin treated animals vs. 0.36+/-0.03 in control animals, p <0.05). Atherosclerotic fatty streak coverage correlated positively with total cholesterol, tryglicerides and LDL-cholesterol levels in all groups. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors similarly lowered plasma lipids but exhibited significantly different effects in the modulation of atherosclerotic development and platelet response at the tested dose. Therefore, the effect of statins on the progression and manifestation of cardiovascular disease might be also mediated by regulating platelet response to vessel injury.", 
    "99": "A randomized, double-masked, crossover clinical trial was carried out to evaluate whether lovastatin therapy (60 mg daily) affects the initiation of oxidation of low density lipoprotein (LDL) in cardiac patients on alpha-tocopherol supplementation therapy (450 IU daily). Twenty-eight men with verified coronary heart disease and hypercholesterolemia received alpha-tocopherol with lovastatin or with dummy tablets in random order. The two 6-week, active-treatment periods were preceded by a washout period of at least 8 weeks. The oxidizability of LDL was determined by 2 methods ex vivo. The depletion times for LDL ubiquinol and LDL alpha-tocopherol were determined in timed samples taken during oxidation induced by 2, 2-azobis(2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile). Copper-mediated oxidation of LDL isolated by rapid density-gradient ultracentrifugation was used to measure the lag time to the propagation phase of conjugated-diene formation. alpha-Tocopherol supplementation led to a 1.9-fold concentration of reduced alpha-tocopherol in LDL (P<0.0001) and to a 2.0-fold longer depletion time (P<0.0001) of alpha-tocopherol compared with determinations after the washout period. A 43% prolongation (P<0.0001) was seen in the lag time of conjugated-diene formation. Lovastatin decreased the depletion time of reduced alpha-tocopherol in metal ion-independent oxidation by 44% and shortened the lag time of conjugated-diene formation in metal ion-dependent oxidation by 7%. In conclusion, alpha-tocopherol supplementation significantly increased the antioxidative capacity of LDL when measured ex vivo, which was partially abolished by concomitant lovastatin therapy.", 
    "100": "We determined the role of Fluvastatin: HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor on the regression of atherosclerosis following removal of dietary cholesterol. Male rabbits fed a 0.5% cholesterol diet for 12 weeks were divided into three groups: A1, hypercholesterolemic; A2, fed a regular diet for an 12 additional weeks; and A3, fed a regular diet with fluvastatin (2 mg/kg/day). Fluvastatin treatment (A3) did not affect serum lipid levels compared with A2. However, it decreased the atherosclerotic area in the aortic arch and decreased total and esterified cholesterol concentrations in the descending aorta. Tone-related basal NO release in the thoracic aorta was larger in A3 than in A2. eNOS mRNA in vessel was determined by competitive RT-PCR assay. It increased in A1, compared with normal aorta and decreased in A2; however, it did not decrease in A3. This is the first report of a decrease in eNOS mRNA in atherosclerosis after removal of dietary cholesterol and a reversal of it by a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, which may contribute to the regression of atherosclerosis.",

    "103": "We conducted a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial in 24 postmenopausal women, each of whom received the following drug regimens during three consecutive six-week treatment periods: 1) hormone replacement (oral dose of 0.625 mg/day conjugated equine estrogens and 2.5 mg/day medroxyprogesterone acetate); 2) 20 mg lovastatin/day and 3) hormone replacement plus lovastatin.", 
    "104": "Total and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol were significantly lowered and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was significantly increased by all three regimens compared with baseline (p < 0.05). Lovastatin was more effective than estrogen/progestin in reducing LDL (p < 0.001), but estrogen/progestin was slightly more effective in increasing HDL. The hormone replacement and lovastatin regimen blocked the estrogen-associated increase in triglycerides. Hormone replacement (alone and with lovastatin) resulted in increases in brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilator capacity (p = 0.01 for both regimens) and the area under the curve (p = 0.016 and p = 0.005, respectively) compared with baseline. Percent dilation was greatest after the hormone replacement regimen, whereas the area under the curve was greatest after hormone replacement plus lovastatin (69% improvement vs. baseline).", 
    "105": "In postmenopausal women with coronary disease and hyperlipidemia, conjugated equine estrogen produced significant improvements in lipids and vasodilator responses despite the concurrent administration of low dose medroxyprogesterone acetate. Low dose lovastatin produced greater reductions in LDL, but less dramatic improvements in vasodilator responses. Estrogen/progestin plus lovastatin may provide additional benefits via a greater reduction in the LDL/HDL ratio and attenuation of estrogen-associated hypertriglyceridemia. More information is needed about the safety and efficacy of such combinations of hormone replacement and reductase inhibitor therapy.", 
    "106": "To assess the value of secondary prevention with lipid lowering therapy following either balloon angioplasty (PTCA) or bypass surgery (CABG) in familial hypercholesterolemia patients, the correlation of the new evolution of stenotic lesions and therapeutically achieved cholesterol levels was studied in 50 patients.", 
    "107": "All surviving patients were followed angiographically after 5 years, and findings were correlated with the annually determined total serum cholesterol (TC) levels.", 
    "108": "New coronary atherosclerotic plaques were not observed in 18 patients in whom the TC was controlled to <220 mg/dl but in 19 of 32 patients in whom the TC was >220 mg/dl, a new evolution of stenotic lesions was observed angiographically.", 
    "109": "The new evolution of stenotic lesions following revascularization in patients with FH can be controlled significantly by lipid lowering therapy to maintain a TC level of <220 mg/dl, and if diet alone can not achieve it, aggressive medication and even LDL apheresis might be justified.", 
    "110": "Apolipoprotein E (apoE) allele epsilon4 is a major risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, the molecular mechanism underlying the acceleration of the development of AD in patients possessing epsilon4 remains to be determined. To investigate the isoform-specific effects of apoE on neurons, primary neuron cultures were prepared from fetal rat cerebral cortices. Inhibition of de novo cholesterol synthesis by compactin, a 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitor, induced neuronal cell death in a dose dependent manner. In the presence of a sublethal dose of compactin, apoE4 with beta-migrating very low density lipoproteins (beta-VLDL) caused apoptotic cell death in neuronal cultures. The same results were obtained with inhibition of de novo cholesterol synthesis by sublethal doses of squalestatin, an inhibitor of squalene synthase. The de novo cholesterol synthesis was suppressed to a higher degree by apoE4 than by apoE3, administered with beta-VLDL in the presence or absence of compactin. Mevalonate and squalene, which are metabolites of the cholesterol synthesis pathway, protected neuronal cells from apoE4-induced cell death. These results may suggest that apoE4 may exhibit neurotoxic action when de novo cholesterol synthesis is suppressed to a certain level, and that apoE4 induces neuronal cell death through the suppression of de novo cholesterol synthesis via an undetermined isoform-specific mechanism.", 
    "111": "Medulloblastoma is a malignant paediatric central nervous system tumor with a poor prognosis, stimulating the evaluation of improved treatment strategies. Lovastatin, a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, is currently used to treat patients with hypercholesterolemia. This compound also inhibits the production of non-steroidal mevalonate derivatives that are implicated in the control of cellular proliferation, and can induce cell-cycle arrest in vitro. We recently showed that lovastatin inhibited growth and promoted apoptosis of neuroblastoma, the peripheral nervous system 'cousin' of medulloblastoma. Therefore the potential of lovastatin as a possible anticancer drug against medulloblastoma was evaluated in vitro. Four medulloblastoma cell lines, Daoy, UW228, D341 Med and D283 Med, were treated with 1-40 microM of lovastatin in vitro. Analysis of cell morphologic changes, cell viability, DNA fragmentation and flow cytometry in all four cell lines showed growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis with lovastatin treatment. As little as 10 microM of lovastatin was sufficient to cause a marked reduction in cell numbers, and more than 20 microM of lovastatin induced >90% cells to undergo apoptosis, after intervals ranging between 36 and 96 h, depending on the cell line. Lovastatin induced apoptosis in these cell lines was concomitant with cell cycle arrest in G1. The attached cell lines UW228 and Daoy were more sensitive to lovastatin than D283 Med and D341 Med. Daoy cells which survived several cycles of lovastatin treatment could still be induced to undergo apoptosis after longer treatment times. The efficient induction of apoptosis by lovastatin favours this drug as a potential new avenue of therapeutic intervention for medulloablastoma.", 
    "112": "Early stages of coronary atherosclerosis are characterized by a mainly functional impairment of coronary vasodilator capacity under the impact of such risk factors as hypercholesterolemia. The goal of this study was to determine whether 6-month cholesterol-lowering therapy improves coronary flow reserve in patients with angina, reduced flow reserve despite minimally diseased coronary vessels or even normal angiogram, and mild to moderately elevated LDL levels on average.", 
    "113": "We noninvasively investigated 23 consecutive patients (18 men, 5 women; mean age, 56+/-7.6 years) with a mean LDL level of 165+/-34 mg/dL at baseline by PET for myocardial blood flow measurement with [13N]ammonia at rest and under dipyridamole stress (0.56 mg/kg) before and after lipid-lowering therapy with simvastatin for 6 months. Between baseline and the 6-month follow-up, total cholesterol concentration fell from 241+/-44 to 168+/-34 mg/dL, and the LDL level decreased from 165+/-34 to 95+/-26 mg/dL (P<0.001). Overall, coronary flow reserve increased from 2.2+/-0.6 to 2.64+/-0.6 (P<0.01). Maximal coronary flow increased significantly from 182+/-36 to 238+/-58 mL/minx100 g (P<0.001) at follow-up. Minimum coronary resistance declined significantly from 0. 51+/-0.12 to 0.40+/-0.14 mm Hg. mL-1. minx100 g (P<0.001). Concomitantly, a regression of anginal symptoms was observed in most patients.", 
    "114": "Our results suggest that cholesterol-lowering therapy with simvastatin may improve overall coronary vasodilator capacity assessed noninvasively by PET in patients with mild to moderate hypercholesterolemia. Consequently, intensive lipid-lowering therapy is considered a vasoprotective treatment for selected patients in very early stages of coronary atherosclerosis with the potential of preventing further disease progression.", 
    "115": "The concept that hepatic cholesterol synthesis regulates hepatocyte assembly and secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins remains controversial. The present study was carried out in HepG2 cells to examine the regulation of apoB secretion by the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor atorvastatin. ApoB accumulation in the media was decreased by 24% and 36% at 10 microm (P < 0.02) and 20 microm (P < 0.01) of atorvastatin, respectively. Atorvastatin inhibited HepG2 cell cholesterol synthesis by up to 96% (P < 0.001) and cellular cholesteryl ester (CE) mass by 54% (P < 0.001). Another HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, simvastatin, decreased cellular cholesterol synthesis and CE mass by up to 96% (P < 0.001) and 52% (P < 0.001), respectively. However, in contrast to atorvastatin, simvastatin had no effect on apoB secretion. To characterize the reduction in apoB secretion by atorvastatin (10 microm), pulse-chase experiments were performed and the kinetic data were analyzed by multicompartmental modeling using SAAM II. Atorvastatin had no affect on the synthesis of apoB, however, apoB secretion into the media was decreased by 44% (P = 0.048). Intracellular apoB degradation increased proportionately (P = 0.048). Simvastatin (10 microm) treatment did not significantly alter either the secretion or intracellular degradation of apoB, relative to control. The kinetics of apoB degradation were best described by a rapidly and a slowly turning over degradation compartment. The effect of atorvastatin on apoB degradation was largely confined to the rapid compartment. Neither inhibitor affected apoB mRNA concentrations, however, both significantly increased LDL receptor and HMG-CoA reductase mRNA levels. Atorvastatin treatment also decreased the mRNA for the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) by 22% (P < 0.02). These results show that atorvastatin decreases apoB secretion, by a mechanism that results in an enhanced intracellular degradation in apoB.", 
    "116": "Elevated plasma triglyceride levels are increasingly recognized as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Fibric acid derivatives (fibrates) substantially decrease triglyceride levels and have been demonstrated to decrease clinical cardiovascular events in some trials. Ongoing research will elucidate the molecular mechanisms by which fibrates modify lipoprotein metabolism, clarify their use in combination with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins), and determine their role in the prevention of cardiovascular events.", 
    "117": "Lipid-lowering statin treatment reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality and improves endothelial function in patients with hypercholesterolemia. The aim of the present study was to evaluate plasma levels of fibrinogen, factor VII, and the macrophage-derived inflammatory mediator neopterin during lipid lowering. In addition, the endothelial production of platelet antiaggregatory and vasodilatory factors such as nitric oxide and prostacyclin, and vasoconstrictive factors such as endothelin-1, was assessed. Plasma fibrinogen, factor VII, endothelin-1, and the neopterin and intraplatelet nitric oxide and prostacyclin mediators cyclic 3'-5'guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) and cyclic 3'-5'adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) were measured before and 6 months after the institution of treatment with fluvastatin in 17 patients (eight men and nine women, median age 60 years) with vascular disease and previously untreated hypercholesterolemia. After 6 months, a decrease of 1.62 mmol/l [1.26-2.18 (19%); P < 0.01] was noted in levels of total cholesterol, and a decrease of 1.70 mmol/l [1.52-2.30 (28%); P < 0.01] in levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Plasma levels of fibrinogen had increased [from 4.81 g/l (4.26-5.27) to 5.17 g/l (4.81-5.67); P < 0.05], whereas no significant changes had occurred in intraplatelet levels of cGMP [decrease by 0.05 pmol/10(9) platelets (-0.17 to 0.24); NS], cAMP [decrease by 0.13 pmol/10(9) platelets (-0.37 to 0.86); NS], plasma endothelin-1 [decrease by 0.05 pg/ml (-0.60 to 0.70); NS], plasma factor VII [from 1.14 IE/ml (0.58-1.38) to 1.22 IE/ml (0.96-1.46); NS], or plasma neopterin [from 8.6 nmol/l (7.1-11.5) to 8.7 nmol/l (7.9-11.3); NS]. In conclusion, during cholesterol-lowering treatment with fluvastatin, plasma levels of fibrinogen increased whereas intraplatelet cyclic nucleotide levels and plasma endothelin-1, factor VII and neopterin levels were unchanged.", 
    "118": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors reduce serum total cholesterol concentrations and the risk of coronary heart disease in patients with hypercholesterolemia. Recently, it has been reported that patients with combined hyperlipidemia are also at risk of coronary heart disease. However, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor therapy alone does not sufficiently reduce serum triglyceride concentrations. Epidemiological and clinical evidence has shown that fish oil can lower plasma lipid levels, especially triglycerides. Consequently, we investigated the effects of the combination of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and eicosapentaenoic acid, a major component of fish oil, on hyperlipidemia. We administered 900-1,800 mg/day of the ethyl ester of eicosapentaenoic acid to patients with hyperlipidemia who had been treated with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors for 30 +/- 6 months (means +/- SE). Serum total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations were significantly decreased 3 months after the administration of eicosapentaenoic acid (from 5.63 +/- 0.23 mmol/l to 5.02 +/- 0.20 mmol/l, P < 0.05; from 2.07 +/- 0.41 mmol/l to 1.08 +/- 0.17 mmol/l, P < 0.01, respectively). Serum high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol concentrations were significantly increased after the treatment (from 1.23 +/- 0.12 mmol/l to 1.34 +/- 0.13 mmol/l, P < 0.05). Plasma eicosapentaenoic acid concentrations and the ratio to arachidonic acid in plasma were also significantly increased 3 months after the treatment (from 101.9 +/- 8.1 mg/l to 181.8 +/- 23.9 mg/l, P < 0.001; from 0.640 +/- 0.075 to 1.211 +/- 0.170, P < 0.001, respectively). These results suggested that the combination therapy of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and eicosapentaenoic acid was effective for patients with hyperlipidemia.",

Patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) have been shown to have raised total serum cholesterol and serum triglycerides and increased sP-selectin levels when compared with controls. A total of 31 patients with PAOD and hypercholesterolaemia took part in this three-staged study. Soluble P-selectin (sP-selectin) levels were significantly lowered after 12 weeks of fluvastatin treatment (157.0 ng/ml versus 113.77 ng/ml, p = 0.01), whereas 12 weeks of placebo treatment had no statistically significant effect on sP-selectin levels (150.0 ng/ml versus 139.4 ng/ml). An unpaired t-test almost reached statistical significance (p = 0.051) when the levels by which sP-selectin fell after 12 weeks of active or placebo treatment were compared. The placebo group was then put onto long-term, active treatment and sP-selectin levels were significantly lowered by fluvastatin when compared to pre-treatment levels (150.0 ng/ml versus 110.0 ng/ml, p = 0.03). By lowering the levels of P-selectin, fluvastatin may not only attenuate atherosclerotic progression but may also decrease the platelet activation associated with PAOD.",

    "124": "The integrin heterodimer CDllb/CD18 (alphaMbeta2, Mac-1, CR3) expressed on monocytes or polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) is a receptor for iC3b, fibrinogen, heparin, and for intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 on endothelium, crucially contributing to vascular cell interactions in inflammation and atherosclerosis. In this report, we summarize our findings on the effects of lipid mediators and lipid-lowering drugs. Exposure of endothelial cells to oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) induces upregulation of ICAM-1 and increases adhesion of monocytic cells expressing Mac-1. Inhibition experiments show that monocytes use distinct ligands, i.e. ICAM-1 and heparan sulfate proteoglycans for adhesion to oxLDL-treated endothelium. An albumin-transferable oxLDL activity is inhibited by the antioxidant pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), while 8-epi-prostaglandin F2alpha (8-epi-PGF2alpha) or lysophosphatidylcholine had no effect, implicating yet unidentified radicals. Sequential adhesive and signaling events lead to the firm adhesion of rolling PMN on activated and adherent platelets, which may occupy areas of endothelial denudation. Shear-resistant arrest of PMN on thrombin-stimulated platelets in flow conditions requires distinct regions of Mac-1, involving its interactions with fibrinogen bound to platelet alphallbbeta3, and with other platelet ligands. Both arrest and adhesion strengthening under flow are stimulated by platelet-activating factor and leukotriene B4, but not by the chemokine receptor CXCR2. We tested whether Mac-1-dependent monocyte adhesiveness is affected by inhibitors of hydroxy-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A reductase (statins) which improve morbidity and survival of patients with coronary heart disease. As compared to controls, adhesion of isolated monocytes to endothelium ex vivo was increased in patients with hypercholesterolemia. Treatment with statins decreased total and low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol plasma levels, surface expression of Mac-1, and resulted in a dramatic reduction of Mac-1-mediated monocyte adhesion to endothelium. The inhibition of monocyte adhesion was reversed by mevalonate but not LDL in vitro, indicating that isoprenoid precursors are crucial for adhesiveness of Mac-1. Such effects may crucially contribute to the clinical benefit of statins, independent of cholesterol-lowering, and may represent a paradigm for novel, anti-inflammatory mechanisms of action by this class of drugs.",

    "126": "This was a 16-week, open-label, parallel-design study conducted in our lipid clinic. After a 6-week dietary baseline phase, we implemented a treatment phase, during which patients received 10 mg/day atorvastatin (n = 45) or 200 mg/day micronized fenofibrate (n = 46) for 16 weeks. Patients were assigned to one of the drugs in sequential orders. Serum lipid profiles, including levels of lipoprotein(a) and fibrinogen, as well as muscle and liver enzymes, were measured during screening, and during weeks -4, -2, 0, 8, and 16 of the treatment period.", 
    "127": "Atorvastatin was more effective than was micronized fenofibrate at lowering levels of total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, whereas fenofibrate was more effective at lowering levels of triglycerides, and raising levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein A1. However, micronized fenofibrate could significantly decrease plasma fibrinogen levels, whereas atorvastatin evoked a small increase.", 
    "128": "Both atorvastatin in small doses and micronized fenofibrate are effective for improving serum lipid profiles of patients with mixed hyperlipidemia. However, there are considerable differences between the two drugs concerning their influences on plasma fibrinogen levels.",

    "133": "Cerivastatin and simvastatin produced clinically significant reductions in LDL-C of 28.4% and 35.4%, respectively, at the end point for the 32-week study, and reductions of 32.8% and 35. 0%, respectively, at the end of the extension phase of the study. Response rates (a greater than 15% drop in LDL-C) were comparable for the two treatments (88.9% cerivastatin versus 93.2% simvastatin) at the 32-week end point. Response rates were 100% for both treatments at the end of the 72-week extension phase. Both treatments also reduced total cholesterol, apolipoprotein B and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Cerivastatin and simvastatin increased HDL-C levels significantly by 8.8% and 11.0%, respectively, at the end point for the 32-week study, and by 8.6% and 12.1%, respectively, at the end of the extension phase of the study.

    "135": "Deficiency of nonsterol isoprenoids, intermediate metabolites of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, has been known to cause an inhibition of DNA synthesis and cell growth, and to induce apoptosis in nonneuronal cells. To investigate whether this is also the case in neurons, we examined the effect of a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor on the viability of neuronal cultures prepared from fetal rat brains. Treatment with compactin, a competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, induced neuronal death in a dose-dependent manner. Concurrent treatment with cholesterol, beta-migrating very low density lipoprotein, mevalonate, or squalene substantially inhibited the induction of neuronal death by compactin. Cell death was also induced by treatment with squalestatin, which specifically inhibits cholesterol biosynthesis at a site downstream from the generation of nonsterol metabolites. Furthermore, squalestatin-induced neuronal death was inhibited by concurrent incubation with squalene but not mevalonate. In contrast, cell growth of proliferating cells such as NIH 3T3 and PC12 cells was exclusively dependent on the level of nonsterol isoprenoid products and not that of cholesterol. The results of this study clearly indicate that the viability of neurons, different from that of nonneuronal cells, depends on the intracellular cholesterol content and not on the intermediate nonsterol isoprenoid products.", 
    "136": "An increase of biliary lipid secretion is known to occur in the rat under sustained administration of statin-type 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG) coenzyme A (CoA) reductase inhibitors. The present study has addressed critical mechanisms of hepatic lipid synthesis and phosphatidylcholine (PC) biliary transport in the rat fed with a 0.075% pravastatin diet for 3 weeks. After treatment, biliary secretion of PC and cholesterol increased to 233% and 249% of controls, while that of bile salts was unchanged. Activity of cytidylyltransferase (CT), a major regulatory enzyme in the CDP-choline pathway of PC synthesis, was raised in both microsomal and cytosolic fractions (226% and 150% of controls), and there was an increase to 187% in the mass of active enzyme as determined by Western blot of microsomal protein using an antibody specific to CT. Cytosolic activity of choline kinase, another enzyme of the CDP-choline pathway, also increased to 175% of controls. In addition, there was an over eightfold increase in the HMG CoA reductase activity and mRNA. Thus, an increased PC and cholesterol synthetic supply to hepatocytes appeared as a basic mechanism for the biliary hypersecretion of these lipids. Notwithstanding the increased synthesis, hepatic PC content was unchanged, suggesting an enhanced transfer of this lipid into bile. Indeed, there was a sevenfold increase of multidrug resistance gene 2 (mdr2) gene mRNA coding for a main PC canalicular translocase. Thus, hypersecretion of biliary PC in the model studied can be explained by an up-regulation of mdr2 gene transcription and its P-glycoprotein product mediating the biliary transfer of PC supplied by an increased biosynthesis.", 
    "137": "Drug treatment of dyslipidaemia has progressed dramatically over the past decade. Of the available drugs, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have emerged as very effective and important treatments for dyslipidaemia. These agents potently reduce low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels (the main lipid target in management protocols and treatment guidelines) and have produced significant reductions in coronary heart disease (CHD) related morbidity and mortality, as well as overall mortality, in large intervention studies. They have also been shown to reduce progression and increase regression of coronary atherosclerosis. Statins are generally well tolerated and are thus associated with high patient compliance in comparison with the other classes of medications used for dyslipidaemia. There are minimal studies to date with these agents in patients with elevated triglycerides, either with or without accompanying elevated cholesterol levels. Preliminary results with statins in patients with hypertriglyceridaemia are promising, with reductions in triglycerides of 26 and 46%, respectively, having been reported following treatment with simvastatin and atorvastatin. Therefore, statins can be considered first-line drugs in many patients with elevated total and/or LDL-cholesterol levels according to treatment guidelines.", 
    "138": "Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death and the leading source of healthcare expenditure in the US and most other industrialised countries. Cholesterol lowering by pharmacological means prevents atherosclerotic plaque progression and has been shown to reduce both fatal and nonfatal coronary events in patients with or without coronary artery disease (CAD). Because of their excellent efficacy and safety profiles, the introduction of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (also known an 'statins') in 1987 raised hopes for demonstrating the survival benefit of cholesterol reduction. In the past decade, several large-scale placebo-controlled trials with statin therapy have revisited the relationship between cholesterol reduction, cardiovascular disease and mortality. The West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS) [pravastatin] and the Air Force/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention Study (AFCAPS/TexCAPS) [lovastatin] have shown significant cardiovascular disease reduction in primary prevention trials of patients with elevated and normal cholesterol levels, respectively. The Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S), the Long-Term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischaemic Disease (LIPID) Study and the Cholesterol and Recurrent Events (CARE) trial [pravastatin] have shown significant cardiovascular disease reduction in patients with a previous history of CAD with high, moderate and normal cholesterol levels, respectively. Three of these studies (4S, WOSCOPS and LIPID) have shown significant reduction in all-cause mortality, while all the statin secondary prevention trials (4S, CARE and LIPID) have demonstrated significant reduction in cerebrovascular disease/ Earlier cholesterol reduction cost-effectiveness studies with nonstatin treatments (bile acid resins, fibrates, niacin and diet) suggested that only patients at extremely high risk could be treated with lipid therapy in a cost-effective manner. More recently, rigorous outcomes evidence demonstrates that statins, particularly for simvastatin for secondary prevention and lovastatin for primary prevention, have a broadly favourable cost-effectiveness profile. Based on US medical price levels and the available clinical trial data on statins, it would be cost effective [e.g. cost less than $US50,000/year of life saved] to intervene with statin therapy in any patient with an annual CAD risk exceeding 1%. This includes all patients with pre-existing CAD or diabetes mellitus, and many more primary prevention patients than are currently contemplated by the US National Cholesterol Education Panel treatment guidelines. Achieving such a goal will require enormous changes in patient education, clinical perspective, healthcare practice and healthcare finances. But any proven opportunity for saving the lives of 25% of those dying from cardiovascular disease each year deserves to be considered with the utmost seriousness and urgency.", 
    "139": "Lowering cholesterol with drugs of the statin class reduces the risk of a coronary event. Recent guidelines recommend use of the 'Sheffield tables' to detect individuals who might be offered drug treatment in whom the annual absolute risk of a first coronary event is > or = 3%. Using these tables in a general practice cohort aged 35-68 years, we found that 3% of men and 0.05% of women were above the treatment threshold. Smokers aged over 50 accounted for 85% of people recommended for statin therapy. Almost all smokers would fall below the treatment threshold if they quit smoking.", 
    "140": "The rheological properties of erythrocytes are impaired in diabetes mellitus, especially because of changes in their membrane lipid composition. In hypercholesterolaemic patients, lowering plasma cholesterol is associated with an improvement of the erythrocyte rheological parameters. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between erythrocyte deformability, plasma lipids, lipid membrane composition and cytosolic cations in poorly controlled Type 2 diabetic patients and to test the effects of a cholesterol-lowering treatment on these parameters.", 
    "141": "We compared 37 poorly controlled Type 2 diabetic patients with 26 controls. In 22 of the diabetic patients who showed an impairment in erythrocyte deformability (filtration index >10.5 on the Hanss' haemorheometer), a double-blind randomized trial compared the effect of the inhibitor of HMG CoA reductase pravastatin 20 mg per day for 4 months vs. placebo on the erythrocyte parameters.", 
    "142": "Compared with controls, diabetic patients had higher filtration index (FI), erythrocyte sodium and calcium contents and lower free cholesterol-phospholipids ratio in erythrocyte membranes. Erythrocyte sodium content correlated positively with the FI and the membrane free cholesterol-phospholipids ratio. In the pravastatin-treated group (11 patients), fibrinogen decreased significantly, FI reached a normal value (<10) in six patients. Four of the five other patients who still had abnormal FI after 4 months of treatment had either a high plasma triglycerides (> or =4.60 mmol/l) or a high plasma fibrinogen (> or =4 g/l) level at baseline. Only two of the 11 placebo-treated patients achieved a normal FI.",

    "144": "A 3-week treatment of rats with pravastatin (PV) augmented biliary cholesterol and phospholipid output 3.6- and 2.2-fold over controls, while bile acid (BA) output and kinetics were unchanged. No major changes were detected in hepatic and serum cholesterol concentrations despite the PV inhibitory property on hydroxymethyl glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase. To evaluate the mechanisms of this adaptive phenomenon, several parameters of hepatic lipid homeostasis were assessed. Biliary cholesterol changes could not be attributed to an increased influx of lipoprotein cholesterol to the liver and bile. Hepatic low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor content, as inferred from Western blot analysis, was unchanged, as was the biliary excretion of labeled cholesterol derived from chylomicron remnants. In vivo 3H2O-incorporation studies showed an 80% increase in hepatic cholesterol synthesis, evidence for bypass of the PV block. Remarkably, fatty acid synthesis was also stimulated twofold, providing substrate for hepatic triglycerides, which were slightly enhanced. However, serum triglycerides decreased 52% associated with a 22% decrease in hepatic very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion. Thus, the biochemical adaptation following PV treatment produces complex alterations in hepatic lipid metabolism. An enhanced supply of newly synthesized cholesterol and fatty acids in association with a limited VLDL secretion rate augments the biliary lipid secretion pathway in this experimental model.",

According to the study protocol, the children were submitted to a 3-month washout (free diet). Then they were given a diet (American Heart Association, step 2) for 6 months. After 6 months they were divided into two groups matched for sex, age and body mass index (BMI). Diet only was given to group A (n = 8); simvastatin (10 mg/daily) was given to group B, for 1 year. All patients were examined at baseline, and monitored for safety during the study by pediatricians. All patients were submitted to noninvasive cardiovascular examinations (exercise electrocardiogram, echocardiography). After 12 months of treatment with simvastatin, total cholesterol (TC) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) showed a statistically significant reduction (group B). The decrease of TC and LDLC in patients on diet only was 4% and 3% (all) and 17% and 4% (group A) after 6 and 12 months, respectively.",

Twenty healthy volunteers, 97 NIDDM patients and 2 patients with familial hypercholesterolemia were studied. None had overt heart failure or any other heart disease. Mean serum CoQ10 concentrations were significantly (p < 0.01) lower in diabetic patients with normal serum cholesterol concentrations, either with or without administration of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (HMG-CoA RIs) including simvastatin (normal: 0.91 +/- 0.26 (mean +/- SD) mumol 1(-1); diabetic with HMG-CoA RI: 0.63 +/- 0.19; diabetic without HMG-CoA RI: 0.66 +/- 0.21). CoQ10 concentrations were higher (1.37 +/- 0.48, p < 0.001) in diabetic patients with hypercholesterolemia. Simvastatin or low density lipoprotein apheresis decreased serum CoQ10 concentrations along with decreasing serum cholesterol. Oral CoQ10 supplementation in diabetic patients receiving HMG-CoA RI significantly (p < 0.001) increased serum CoQ10 from 0.81 +/- 0.24 to 1.47 +/- 0.44 mumol 1(-1), without affecting cholesterol levels. It significantly (p < 0.03) decreased cardiothoracic ratios from 51.4 +/- 5.1 to 49.2 +/- 4.7%.

This study evaluates the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of cerivastatin 0.8 mg once daily for 4 weeks. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group trial conducted at 2 study centers, 41 patients (63% women) with primary hypercholesterolemia were placed on an American Heart Association Step 1 diet for 4 weeks. Single-blind placebo was administered for the final 2 weeks, before randomization. Patients received cerivastatin 0.8 mg (n = 28) or placebo (n = 13) once each evening for 28 days. Cerivastatin at 0.8 mg daily was well tolerated. No discontinuations occurred during the study. Adverse events were mild and transient. One cerivastatin-treated patient experienced asymptomatic creatinine kinase, 8x the upper limit of normal (ULN) elevation on the last day of the study, which resolved 6 days after the completion of the study. Cerivastatin 0.8 mg daily significantly reduced LDL cholesterol compared with placebo (-44.0 +/- 2.0% vs 2.2 +/- 2.8%, p <0.0001); total cholesterol (-30.8 +/- 1.4% vs 2.6 +/- 2.1%, p <0.0001), triglycerides (-11.2 +/- 5.9% vs 15.9 +/- 8.6%, p <0.02), but did not significantly alter high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (3.2 +/- 2.1% vs -1.2 +/- 3.1%, p = NS). The pharmacokinetics of the 0.8-mg dose revealed dose proportional elevations in the 24-hour area under the curve and maximum plasma concentration relative to 0.3- and 0.4-mg doses with no change in time to maximum concentration or the elimination half-life in plasma. The increased efficacy and lack of clinically significant laboratory abnormalities or adverse events demonstrates a need for a large long-term study to confirm the safety and efficacy of this dose of cerivastatin.", 
    "150": "Polyketides, the ubiquitous products of secondary metabolism in microorganisms, are made by a process resembling fatty acid biosynthesis that allows the suppression of reduction or dehydration reactions at specific biosynthetic steps, giving rise to a wide range of often medically useful products. The lovastatin biosynthesis cluster contains two type I polyketide synthase genes. Synthesis of the main nonaketide-derived skeleton was found to require the previously known iterative lovastatin nonaketide synthase (LNKS), plus at least one additional protein (LovC) that interacts with LNKS and is necessary for the correct processing of the growing polyketide chain and production of dihydromonacolin L. The noniterative lovastatin diketide synthase (LDKS) enzyme specifies formation of 2-methylbutyrate and interacts closely with an additional transesterase (LovD) responsible for assembling lovastatin from this polyketide and monacolin J."
