This quality improvement study aimed to determine, and subsequently reduce, the percentage of patients with PAD discharged without statins. According to the Vascular Society of Great Britain and Ireland, and draft National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence guidance, all patients undergoing major vascular procedures should be prescribed a statin. A baseline audit of patients with PAD under the care of the vascular team at our instituted was undertaken for the period Dec 2009-July 2010. Electronic discharge letters (EDLs) were analysed and compliance with statin prescription were recorded. A number of interventions aimed at improving compliance were then enacted and monitored through weekly PDSA cycles. Junior doctor leadership was key to identifying the problem and conceiving, implementing, and measuring changes. A second cycle was run, using similar data collection methods to the first, for the period August-October 2010. In the first cycle, EDLs pertaining to 113 patient admissions, involving 96 patients with PAD, were examined. Statins were not prescribed in 30.1%.

    "23": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, commonly known as statins, are some of the most widely prescribed medications worldwide and have been shown to be effective at lowering cholesterol in numerous long-term prospective trials, yet there are significant limitations to their use. First, patients receiving statin therapy have relatively low levels of medication adherence compared with other drug classes. Next, numerous statin formulations are available, each with its own unique safety and efficacy profile, and it may be unclear to prescribers which treatment is optimal for their patients. Finally, statins have class-wide side effects of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis that have resulted in a product recall and dosage limitations. Recent evidence suggests that two genomic markers, KIF6 and SLCO1B1, may inform the therapy choice of patients initiating statins. Given the prevalence of statin usage, their potential health advantages and their overall cost to the healthcare system, there could be significant clinical benefit from creating personalized treatment regimens. Ultimately, if this approach is effective it may encourage higher adoption of generic statins when appropriate, promote adherence, lower rates of myopathy, and overall achieve higher value cardiovascular care. This paper will review the evidence for personalized prescribing of statins via KIF6 and SLCO1B1 and consider some of the implications for testing these markers as part of routine clinical care.",

Different pathological pathways that are triggered in the setting of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), such as endothelial dysfunction, activation of inflammatory and coagulation cascades, and thrombus formation, are known to be inhibited by statins, thereby justifying the use of these agents in patients with ACS. Several recent prospective controlled clinical trials have demonstrated the safety and, in some cases, the efficacy of statins when administered early after ACS. An increasing number of publications have reported, however, that statins may confer a beneficial effect not only in early secondary prevention, but also in the direct treatment of ACS (ie, when statins are administered as first-line treatment in clinically unstable patients). This therapeutic option is supported by the following: numerous experimental studies demonstrating a protective effect of statins under conditions of acute ischemia; analysis of different registries and trials, which has demonstrated a more favourable prognosis for statin-treated patients at the time of acute myocardial ischemia; and small clinical trials reporting a lower periprocedural infarction rate during coronary intervention or lower levels of several prognostic biomarkers, in addition to a lower incidence of cardiovascular events associated with statin therapy.

Notably, through this activity, simvastatin exerts antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects on various cancer cells, including non-small cell lung and breast cancer. Although statin-induced breast cancer cell death is nitric oxide inducible and arginase dependent, we report alternative mechanisms relative to the antitumor function of simvastatin in breast cancer cells. Simvastatin induced cell death in MDA-MB-361, SK-Ov3, and SKBR3, HER2-overexpressing cell lines, in both time- and dose-dependent manners, but did not exert cytotoxicity in MCF10A and MDA-MB-231, HER2 low/negative cell lines. The protein expression of HER2 decreased after the cells were treated with simvastatin; however, HER2 protein and mRNA stabilities were not changed. Furthermore, simvastatin inhibited the activity of the HER2 promoter. Simvastatin-induced cytotoxicity and promoter activity repression were reversed by mevalonate and GGPP, the immediate metabolic products of the acetyl CoA/3-hyrdoxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase reaction and the isoprenoid of the mevalonate cascade, respectively. In addition, simvastatin treatment induced the expression of PEA3, which is a HER2 promoter inhibitor. The use of siRNA to downregulate expression of PEA3 inhibited the simvastin-induced HER2 repression and cell death. These findings provide alternative mechanisms for the antitumor effects of simvastatin, suggesting that simvastatin could also be used as a combination therapy with other chemotherapy agents in HER2-positive patients.",

The effect of simvastatin on pulmonary fibrosis was studied by measurements of IL-13, PDGF, IFN-\u03b3, TGF-p1 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and lung tissue hydroxyproline (HPL) content and by histopathological examination (Ashcroft score). BLM caused significant change in BAL fluid cytokine levels and increased both HPL content and histopathological score (p<0.001 for all). While LD simvastatin had no effect on cytokine levels, HD significantly reduced IL-13 (15.12 \u00b17.08 pg/ml vs. 4.43\u00b12.34 pg/mL; p<0.05) and TGF-\u03b21 levels (269.25 \u00b165.42 pg/mL vs. 131.75\u00b132.65 pg/mL; p<0.05). Neither HD nor LD simvastatin attenuated HPL content or Ashcroft score. In conclusion, this study showed that LD simvastatin had no effect on a BLM-induced pulmonary fibrosis model, while the high dose caused partial improvement in profibrotic cytokine levels.", 
    "52": "There is increasing evidence that statin treatment can be beneficial in certain cancer patients. To determine if these benefits are a direct result of the cholesterol-lowering effects of statins or a result of secondary, protein transcription effects, the impacts of pravastatin and a cholesterol sequestrating agent methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (MbetaCD) on mRNA expression in the breast cancer cell MDA-MB-231 and the lung carcinoma cell Calu-1 have been compared by microarray techniques. The effects of these agents on cholesterol-rich rafts and caveolae, which have significance in cancer signaling, have also been examined. Both treatments caused a general downregulation of not only signal transduction including cancer pathway proteins, but also apoptosis and chemokine pathways, with statins impacting 35 genes by twofold or greater in MDA-MB-231 and > 300 genes in Calu-1. These manifold dysregulations could also explain the various side effects reportedly caused by statins. MbetaCD produced far fewer statistical events than pravastatin in the breast cancer line but many more in the lung cell line. Pravastatin increased expression of CAV1 but caveolae density decreased and overall raft density was unaffected. MbetaCD also caused an increase in CAV1 expression and reduced the prevalence of both rafts and caveolae. It is proposed that sequestration of cholesterol from the membrane by MbetaCD is not equivalent to blockade of the cholesterol pathway and causes different effects on microdomain-mediated signal transduction dependant on the cell line. The profound effects of statins on mRNA expression can be explained by the failure of caveolin-1 to properly complex with cholesterol in an altered sterol environment, with caveolae acting as the main loci for signaling directed towards those transcription processes unaffected by MbetaCD. Targeted inhibition of the postmevalonate pathway could offer an opportunity to specifically reduce caveolae-based signaling in cancer cells. The observed impact of pravastatin on gene expression may explain the pleiotropic effects of statins when they are used as adjuvants in chemotherapy and suggests impact on gene expression as a possible cause of side effects from statin use.", 
    "53": "ChemVassa, a new chemical structure search technology, was developed to allow rapid in silico screening of compounds for hit and hit-to-lead identification in drug development. It functions by using a novel type of molecular descriptor that examines, in part, the structure of the small molecule undergoing analysis, yielding its \"information signature.\" This descriptor takes into account the atoms, bonds, and their positions in 3-dimensional space. For the present study, a database of ChemVassa molecular descriptors was generated for nearly 16 million compounds (from the ZINC database and other compound sources), then an algorithm was developed that allows rapid similarity searching of the database using a query molecular descriptor (e.g., the signature of atorvastatin, below). A scoring metric then allowed ranking of the search results. We used these tools to search a subset of drug-like molecules using the signature of a commercially successful statin, atorvastatin (Lipitor\u2122). The search identified ten novel compounds, two of which have been demonstrated to interact with HMG-CoA reductase, the macromolecular target of atorvastatin. In particular, one compound discussed in the results section tested successfully with an IC50 of less than 100uM and a completely novel structure relative to known inhibitors. Interactions were validated using computational molecular docking and an Hmg-CoA reductase activity assay. The rapidity and low cost of the methodology, and the novel structure of the interactors, suggests this is a highly favorable new method for hit generation.", 
    "54": "Mushrooms have been consumed for thousands of years, and several bioactive components were found therein, including lovastatin, \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and ergothioneine. The study reported herein was to analyze these three bioactive components in 15 fruiting bodies and 9 mycelia of 19 species of mushrooms from genera Agaricus, Agrocybe, Auricularia, Boletus, Ganoderma, Hypsizygus, Inonotus, Lentinus, Morchella, Pleurotus, Tremella, Termitomyces, and Volvariella. The results show that Hypsizygus marmoreus contained the highest amount of lovastatin (628.05 mg/kg) in fruiting bodies and Morchella esculenta contained the highest amount (1438.42 mg/ kg) in mycelia. Agaricus brasiliensis contained the highest amount of GABA (1844.85 mg/kg) in fruiting bodies, and mycelia of Boletus edulis, Pleurotus citrinopileatus, and Termitomyces albuminosus contained extraordinarily higher amounts (1274.03, 1631.67, and 2560.00 mg/kg, respectively). Volvariella volvacea contained the highest amount of ergothioneine (537.27 mg/kg) in fruiting bodies and mycelia; Boletus edulis, Pleurotus ferulae, and P. salmoneostramineus contained relatively higher amount of ergothioneine too (258.03, 250.23, and 222.08 mg/kg, respectively). However, none of these components was detected in fruiting bodies of Inonotus obliquus. In conclusion, these three bioactive components were commonly found in most mushrooms, and these results might be related to their beneficial effects.", 
    "55": "Niacin has been used for more than 50 years in the treatment of cardiovascular disease, although its use has largely been superseded by better-tolerated lipid-modulating interventions. There has been a renewed interest in the HDL-cholesterol raising properties of niacin, with the appreciation that substantial cardiovascular risk remains despite effective treatment of LDL-cholesterol. This coincides with increasing evidence that the complex functional properties of HDL are not well reflected by measurement of HDL-cholesterol alone. In addition to favorable actions on lipoproteins, it is becoming apparent that niacin may also possess lipoprotein independent or pleiotropic effects including the inhibition of inflammatory pathways mediated by its receptor GPR109A, which is expressed by adipocytes and some leukocytes. In this article we consider emerging and prior clinical trial data relating to niacin. We review recent data in respect of mechanisms of action on lipoproteins, which remain complex and incompletely understood. We discuss the recent reports of anti-inflammatory effects of niacin in adipocytes and through bone marrow derived cells and vascular endothelium. These novel observations come at an interesting time, with current imaging and outcome studies leaving outstanding questions on niacin efficacy in statin-treated patients.",

    "58": "Each population comprised 209 patients (mean age 80.4 years [\u00b1 6], 70.3% women). NH showed a higher number of diseases [7 (5-9) vs. 5 (3-7); p < 0.001]. BP (<140/90 mmHg) was better controlled in NH (61.0% vs. 48.1%; p = 0.015). The median number of BP-lowering drugs was three (2-4; CD) and two (1-3; NH) (range: 0-9). Most frequently used antihypertensives were diuretics and beta-blockers. Among renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers, angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) were preferred in CD and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in NH. Drug treatment for secondary prevention of myocardial infarction or stroke [acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 100, RAS-blocker, beta-blocker, statin] was low among both groups (CD 21.3%; NH 1.6%; p = 0.01).

    "60": "The growth and plasticity of engrafted human mesenchymal stem cells is regulated by external stimuli. Rosuvastatin (RSV) promotes myocardial neovascularization and limits myocardial remodeling in patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). While these non-lipid benefits may in part depend on the activation of stem cells, experimental evidence that RSV directly elicits vasculogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells is still lacking. We assessed whether RSV may drive a gene program of vascular commitment and the secretion of trophic mediators with antiapoptotic, angiogenic and antifibrotic activities in human mesenchymal stem cells from full-term placentas (FMhMSCs). With real-time RT-PCR, immunofluorescence, chemiluminescence, Western blot analysis, and in vitro vasculogenesis assays, we show that RSV enhanced expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), kinase insert domain receptor (KDR), encoding a major VEGF receptor, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), and platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) in a time- and dose-dependent manner. GATA-4 and Nkx-2.5 transcription was not affected. RSV enhanced capillary-like formation in vitro, but capillary-embedded FMhMSCs lacked endothelial marker expression, suggesting a role of pericyte-like elements in tube formation. In HUVEC/FMhMSC cocultures, RSV increases PDGFR\u03b2 expression in FMhMSCs, and enhanced capillary density and organizational efficiency, promoting a long-lasting survival of tubular networks. RSV also activated PI3K-Akt pathway; the vasculogenic effects of the statin were abrogated following PI3K inhibition by LY294002. In conclusion, RSV-induced increase in capillary formation was dependent on VEGF and KDR. RSV promotes the activation of paracrine signals for vascular commitment of FMhMSCs through PI3K-Akt pathway. This observation may pave the way to the use of RSV as a pharmacological enhancer of stem cell potential for cardiovascular cell therapy.", 
    "61": "Statins are known clinically by their cholesterol reduction properties through the inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase. There is mounting evidence suggesting a protective role of statins in certain types of cancer, cardiac, and vascular disease through a mechanism that extends beyond their lipid lowering ability. The root mechanism of damage likely involves the inflammatory cascade, specifically compounds known as reactive oxygen species such as the hydroxyl radical. However, direct evidence for the hydroxyl-scavenging capacity of pravastatin and fluvastatin, two forms of statins being widely used to lower LDL cholesterol, is still lacking in literature. In this study, electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy in combination with 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO)-spin-trapping technique was utilized to determine the abilities of pravastatin and fluvastatin in scavenging hydroxyl radical generated from Fe(II) with H(2)O(2) system. In addition, we examined the effects of pravastatin and fluvastatin on oxidative-induced \u03c6X-174 RF I plasmid DNA damage. We have demonstrated here for the first time that pravastatin and fluvastatin at physiologically relevant concentrations significantly decreased formation of DMPO-OH adduct indicating that both compounds could directly scavenge hydroxyl radicals. However, pravastatin and fluvastatin were not able to directly protect against oxidative DNA plasmid damage. The hydroxyl radical sequestering ability of pravastatin and fluvastatin reported in this study may contribute to their beneficial use in certain types of cancer and in cardiovascular disease.",

Thus, they are among the most common serious illnesses in adults, and are associated with an in-hospital mortality of approximately 5%. The most common cause is rupture of an atherosclerotic coronary plaque, resulting in subtotal coronary occlusion. Diagnosis is based on the clinical picture of retrosternal chest pain, aided by electrocardiographic findings of ST segment deviations and biomarker abnormalities (elevation of troponin and natriuretic peptides) and cardiac imaging (myocardial scans showing perfusion defects). Treatment involves antiischemic agents (nitrates and \u03b2 blockers), antiplatelet drugs (aspirin, P2Y(12), and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor blockers), and anticoagulants (unfractionated and low-molecular-weight heparins). Patients should undergo risk stratification, and those with high-risk factors should undergo coronary arteriography promptly with the intent to carry out coronary revascularization. Those at low risk should continue to receive intensive antiischemic and antithrombotic therapy. At discharge, patients should receive intensive lipid-lowering therapy with high doses of a statin, as tolerated.", 
    "67": "Population-based studies demonstrated that statins might decrease the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Statins inhibit the 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme-A reductase and thereby de novo synthesis of cholesterol. Cell culture and animal studies indicated that cholesterol affects the proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein and the generation of amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2). Recently, we have demonstrated that statins can also stimulate the degradation of A\u03b2. The statin-induced clearance of A\u03b2 could be attributed to increased release of the insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) via an exosome-related unconventional secretory pathway. Interestingly, this statin-induced secretion of exosome-associated IDE was independent of cellular cholesterol concentrations, but rather caused by impairment of isoprenoid biosynthesis and protein prenylation. We further identified a new hexapeptide sequence in the C-terminal region of IDE, named the SlyX motif that is critically involved in IDE secretion. Taken these findings together, the increased clearance of A\u03b2 by stimulated secretion of IDE might contribute to the protective effects of statins against AD.",

During the last decades, advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of vulnerable plaque progression, coupled with novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, created a new opportunity for progress against cardiovascular disease. It has been demonstrated that inflammation, implicated in all stages of atherosclerosis, is an integral part of vulnerable plaque development and progression, leading eventually to plaque instability. Thus, new diagnostic modalities have been proposed for the detection of local plaque inflammation. Moreover, treatments such as stenting, photodynamic therapy, and novel pharmaceutical agents are under consideration as methods to stabilize the vulnerable plaques by inhibiting inflammation. This review provides an overview of the inflammatory process leading to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and the potential clinical strategies that may substantially decrease the incidence of events. We will mention the major impact of local and systemic inflammation on plaque advancing and destabilization, the imaging techniques for early detection of vulnerable plaques and the potential therapeutic strategies.",

The determination of markers such as acute phase proteins (C-reactive protein), adhesion molecules such as vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and chemokines is crucial in determining therapeutic responses and clinical outcomes of hypertensive patients.

Here, the expression profile of PLA2G7 was studied in 1137 prostate cancer and 409 adjacent non-malignant prostate tissues using immunohistochemistry to validate its biomarker potential and putative association with disease progression. In order to reveal the molecular alterations induced by PLA2G7 impairment, lipidomic and gene expression profiling was performed in response to PLA2G7 silencing in cultured prostate cancer cells. Moreover, the antineoplastic effect of statins combined with PLA2G7 impairment was studied in prostate cancer cells to evaluate the potential of repositioning of in vivo compatible drugs developed for other indications towards anti-cancer purposes. The results indicated that PLA2G7 is a cancer-selective biomarker in 50 % of prostate cancers and associates with aggressive disease. The alterations induced by PLA2G7 silencing highlighted the potential of PLA2G7 inhibition as an anti-proliferative, pro-apoptotic and anti-migratorial therapeutic approach in prostate cancer. Moreover, the anti-proliferative effect of PLA2G7 silencing was potentiated by lipid-lowering statins in prostate cancer cells.

    "89": "Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is one of the most frequent and serious vascular diseases. Although the major risk factors of VTE are well recognized, the pathology often develops in subjects without any obvious precipitating factor. Recent evidence suggests a link between arterial and venous thrombosis, particularly in patients with idiopathic venous thrombosis. Therefore, similar or identical risk factors may play a role in the development of both diseases. A positive association between classical risk factors of atherosclerosis, including dyslipidemia, and VTE has been reported. Recent studies demonstrated an association between hypercholesterolemia and objectively verified VTE. Circulating lipids have been shown to have both prothrombotic- and endothelium-deteriorating properties. Studies suggested a greater generation of thrombin, endothelial dysfunction, and higher platelet activity in hyperlipidemic blood. By impeding these mechanisms, statins may protect against VTE. Observational, controlled studies and two meta-analyses showed that statins significantly reduced VTE risk, most likely in a process independent from cholesterol lowering, through mechanisms related to the pleiotropic effects of these drugs. Currently, it is unknown whether VTE prevention is a class-effect of statins, or if statins differ in their antithrombotic efficacy, and it is also unknown if statin benefit is dose-dependent. However, there are also opposite findings about the efficacy of statins in prevention of VTE. Therefore, the use of statins for prophylaxis of VTE cannot be generally recommended at this stage. Further studies are needed to identify those patients who could eventually benefit maximally from treatment with statins for prevention of VTE.",

    "91": "In filamentous fungi, production of multiple secondary metabolites is controlled by so-called global regulators. In this study, two genes encoding homologs of VeA and LaeA, representative fungal global regulators, were identified in ML-236B-producing Penicillium citrinum. Disruption of VeA and/or LaeA and complementation clearly demonstrated that both of them played critical roles in ML-236B production by controlling the expression of mlcR, the pathway-specific activator gene for ML-236B biosynthesis. Moreover, sequence analysis revealed that laeA in a mutant strain producing high levels of ML-236B (strain S-1567) possessed a single nucleotide alteration, which resulted in 15 surplus amino acids at the carboxyl terminus of LaeA compared to the LaeA in the wild-type strain (strain SANK18767). Introduction of the mutated laeA into SANK18767 proved that the extended carboxyl region plays a crucial role in the higher production of ML-236B. These results indicated that VeA and LaeA dominantly control the biosynthesis of ML-236B, and the enhanced production in the strain S-1567 is attributable to the mutation in laeA.",

The results revealed that treatment by atorvastatin in combination with prednisolone produced better satisfactory results than in either remedy alone evidenced by significant decrease in volume of hind paw, levels of MDA, nitrites, CRP, significant increase in PON1 activity and HDL and amelioration of other lipid profile parameters that were impaired by prednisolone. The present work demonstrated that statins exert beneficial anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects beyond their basic cholesterol-lowering activity. Thus, we suggest that if corticosteroid therapy is indicated in rheumatoid arthritis, atorvastatin could be added to get benefit from its pleiotropic effects. However, further studies are needed to verify to what extent statin therapy contribute to clinical benefits in human.",

In previously published work, we have shown that chronic SV treatment rescues cognitive function in a transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, and enhances learning and memory in non-transgenic mice without affecting total brain cholesterol and amyloid-beta levels. More recently, we demonstrated the ability of SV to enhance long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 region of the hippocampus in slices from wild-type C57BL/6 mice via a mechanism dependent upon phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K)/Akt activation during LTP induction. The present study was conducted to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying SV-induced enhancement of LTP. Specifically, it was found that inhibiting production of isoprenoid intermediates in the biosynthetic pathway for cholesterol triggers the downstream events leading to enhanced LTP. Interestingly, two major isoprenoid intermediates exhibit differential effects. Replenishment of farnesyl pyrophosphate, but not geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, abolished the LTP-enhancing ability of SV. In parallel to this finding, inhibiting farnesylation, but not geranylgeranylation, replicated the enhancement of LTP caused by SV. Finally, inhibiting farnesylation promotes the activation of Akt during the induction phase. Together, these results suggest that SV enhances LTP in CA1 by modulating isoprenylation-dependent molecular pathways downstream of farnesyl transferase. These findings will aid in the identification of novel therapeutic targets that modulate synaptic and cognitive function.",

Two commercial Monascus-fermented products were also evaluated for comparison. Improved methods of monacolins extraction and identification were developed for the assessment of monacolins in the fermented products. Methanol and ethanol were found to be the most favorable solvents for monacolins extraction due to their ability to extract higher amount of monacolin K and higher numbers of monacolin derivatives. Problem related to false-positive results during monacolins identification was solved by adding monacolin lactonization step in the assessment method. Using this improved method, monacolin derivatives were not detected in all Monascus-fermented products tested in this study, suggesting that their hypocholesterolemic effects may be due to other compounds other than monacolins.",

However, the predicted biliary clearance from SCRH was 7- to 300-fold lower than in vivo biliary clearance. We speculated that the process of biliary excretion might not have been evaluated using sandwich-cultured hepatocytes. To evaluate this issue, intrinsic biliary clearance (CL(bile, int)) based on intracellular compound concentrations was evaluated to investigate the in vitro-in vivo correlation of this process among ARBs, statins, \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, and topotecan. Intrinsic biliary clearance in SCRH correlated to in vivo values obtained by constant intravenous infusion of six compounds, but not rosuvastatin and cefmetazole, to rats. Moreover, differences between SCRH and in vivo CL(bile, int) (0.7-6-fold) were much smaller than those of CL(bile, app) (7-300-fold). Therefore, in vivo CL(bile, int) is more accurately reflected using SCRH than CL(bile, app). In conclusion, to predict in vivo biliary clearance more accurately, CL(bile, int) should be evaluated instead of CL(bile, app) between SCRH and in vivo.",

An LDL reduction of 49% from baseline in statin-na\u00efve patients with stable CHD or a 41% to 44% reduction in LDL from postadmission values in patients with acute coronary syndrome improves composite morbidity and mortality end points.Current evidence suggests that a more intensive LDL reduction of approximately 45% to 50% from a patient's baseline in acute and stable CHD is warranted. The decrease in recurrent events associated with the use of statin regimens that can achieve this degree of reduction in LDL may offer a financial incentive for managed care healthcare systems; however, statin therapy should be selected upon careful consideration of both dose and agent.",

Design A health economic modelling study. Setting Primary healthcare in the Netherlands. Participants Simulated individuals from the general Dutch population, aged 45-75 years. Interventions Opportunistic screening followed by prescription of the polypill to eligible individuals. Eligibility was defined as having a minimum 10-year risk of cardiovascular death as assessed with the Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation function of alternatively 5%, 7.5% or 10%. Different versions of the polypill were considered, depending on composition: (1) the Indian polycap, with three different types of blood pressure-lowering drugs, a statin and aspirin; (2) as (1) but without aspirin and (3) as (2) but with a double statin dose. In addition, a scenario of (targeted) separate antihypertensive and/or statin medication was simulated. Primary outcome measures Cases of acute myocardial infarction or stroke prevented, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained and the costs per QALY gained. All interventions were compared with usual care. Results All scenarios were cost-effective with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio between \u20ac7900 and 12\u2008300 per QALY compared with usual care. Most health gains were achieved with the polypill without aspirin and containing a double dose of statins. With a 10-year risk of 7.5% as the threshold, this pill would prevent approximately 3.5% of all cardiovascular events. Conclusions Opportunistic screening based on global cardiovascular risk assessment followed by polypill prescription to those with increased risk offers a cost-effective strategy. Most health gain is achieved by the polypill without aspirin and a double statin dose.",

We examined the qualitative characteristics of LDLs in patients with stable coronary artery disease (CAD) receiving statin therapy. LDL-particle size was estimated based on the LDL-cholesterol/apolipoprotein B ratio (LDL-C/apoB) in 214 age-adjusted men receiving statin therapy. The LDL-C/apoB ratio was significantly lower in the CAD (+) group (n = 107) than in the CAD (-) group (n = 107) (median, 1.17 versus 1.19, P = 0.0095). LDL-C/apoB was significantly lower in patients with serum TG \u2265 150 mg/dL than in those with serum TG < 150 mg/dL, and in patients with serum HDL-C < 40 mg/dL than in those with serum HDL-C \u2265 40 mg/dL (1.06 versus 1.18, P = 0.012; 1.08 versus 1.22, P = 0.0023). Stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that elevated serum TG was an independent predictor for smaller sizes of LDLs, both in the overall subjects (\u03b2 : -0.165, P = 0.02) as well as in the subset with serum LDL-C < 100 mg/dL (\u03b2 : -0.252, P = 0.011). This study demonstrated that not only the absolute serum LDL-C level, but also the qualitative characteristics of LDL may be monitored for secondary prevention of CAD. Such monitoring is particularly important in patients with elevated serum TG levels, which is associated with smaller sizes of LDL-particles.",

We examined how lipid-lowering therapy with strong statin affected serum PUFA levels in patients with coronary artery disease. The study population consisted of 46 patients with coronary artery disease whose low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was more than 100 mg/dl. Lipid-lowering therapy was performed with a strong statin including atorvastatin (n = 22), rosuvastatin (n = 9) or pitavastatin (n = 15). Serum PUFA levels were determined by gas chromatography. The treatment with strong statin decreased the sum of dihomo-\u03b3-linolenic acid (DGLA) and arachidonic acid (AA) levels (195 \u00b1 41 to 184 \u00b1 44 \u03bcg/ml, P < 0.05) as well as the sum of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) levels (233 \u00b1 71 to 200 \u00b1 72 \u03bcg/ml, P < 0.001). These effects of strong statin resulted in a significant decrease in ratio of the sum of EPA and DHA levels to the sum of DGLA and AA levels (1.20 \u00b1 0.27 to 1.10 \u00b1 0.35, P < 0.05). The percent decrease in the LDL cholesterol level correlated significantly with that in the sum of EPA and DHA levels (r = 0.38, P < 0.01). In conclusion, our results showed that lipid-lowering therapy with strong statin mainly reduced n-3 PUFAs in proportion to the decrease in the LDL cholesterol level in patients with coronary artery disease.",

We analyzed in the Rotterdam Study whether the common polymorphisms -24C>T, 1249G>A and 3972C>T in the ABCC2 gene were associated with a dose decrease or switch to another cholesterol-lowering drug in simvastatin and atorvastatin users. These events could indicate an adverse effect or a too strong reduction in cholesterol level. We identified 1014 simvastatin and atorvastatin users during the period 1 January 1991 to 1 January 2010. Associations between genetic variation and the risk of these events were analyzed using Cox proportional hazards modelling. The ABCC2 -24C>T genotype (HR 1.32 95% CI 1.04-1.69) and the H12 haplotype versus the H2 haplotype (HR 1.49; 95% CI 1.06-2.09) were associated with these events in simvastatin users. A similar but not significant association was found in atorvastatin users. To conclude, genetic variation in the ABCC2 gene is associated with these events in simvastatin users.",

For this purpose, forty eight albino rabbits were randomly divided into eight equal groups; untreated control on normal routine feed, untreated control on butter and cholesterol, treated control on synthetic cholesterol lowering drug simvastatin (Tablet survive (R) 20 mg), three treated groups on three respective doses of C. zeylanicum bark powder and two treated groups on water and methanol extracts of C. zeylanicum bark powder. Butter ad lib and cholesterol powder 500 mg/kg body weight were used to induce experimental hyperlipidaemia in all groups except untreated control group. The results suggested that C. zeylanicum bark powder at the rate of 0.50 g/kg, 0.75 g/kg and methanol extract equivalent to 0.75 g/kg powder produced respective percent reductions in total lipids by 45, 49 and 64; triglycerides by 38, 53 and 60; total cholesterol by 53, 64 and 69 and LDL-cholesterol by 50, 59 and 62. However, at these dosage levels HDL-cholesterol showed respective percent increase of 42, 48 and 53. Nonetheless, C. zeylanicum bark powder at the level of 0.25g/kg and C. zeylanicum extract in water could not significantly reduce lipid profile indicators. Based on these studies, it can safely be said that C. zeylanicum bark powder methanol extract equivalent to 0.75g/kg bark powder and simvastatin (0.6 mg/kg b. wt.) were equieffective in treating hyperlipidaemia.",

Treating vitamin D deficiency in patients with moderate chronic kidney disease (CKD) may reduce CV events in this high-risk population. Study data were abstracted from Harry S. Truman Memorial Veterans Hospital electronic medical record system. The medical records of all veterans who had CKD stages 3 and 4 and had 25OHD levels determined from April 2006 to September 2007 were reviewed. Patients with 25OHD deficiency, serum level <30 ng/mL, were included (N = 126, all men, mean age = 70 years). Successful 25OHD replacement was defined as prescription of ergocalciferol sufficient to increase serum 25OHD level by 25% from baseline within 6 months (treatment group, n = 90). Otherwise patients were considered as untreated controls (n = 36). The date when the 25OHD level was drawn was considered as the date of inclusion. All the patients were followed up from the date of inclusion until July 2009 to capture CV events prospectively. During mean follow-up of 27.2 months, 44% of the controls had CV events, whereas only 21% of the patients in the treatment group had CV events (P = 0.001). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, adjusting for CV disease predictors age, initial parathyroid hormone level, statin use, history of CV disease, and glomerular filtration rate, the estimated odds ratio for 25OHD replacement status was 0.37 (95% confidence interval: 0.14-1.0). Treatment of 25OHD deficiency with ergocalciferol in patients with moderate CKD is associated with significant reduction in CV events.", 
    "153": "Statins have been hypothesized to decrease ventricular arrhythmias through a direct antiarrhythmic effect. Clinical studies have demonstrated a clear reduction only in populations with underlying ischemic heart disease. This study was designed to compare the effect of statins on appropriate shocks between ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Patients with an ejection fraction 35% or less who received an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and had follow-up for at least 1 month were included. The ischemic and nonischemic groups were divided into statin treatment and control subgroups and the occurrence of appropriate shocks was compared. The frequency of shocks was analyzed using negative binomial models to account for overdispersion of the \"count\" data (number of appropriate shocks) and an adjusted intensity rate ratio was calculated for statin use. A total of 676 patients were included, of which statins were used by 65% (329 of 506) of the ischemic and 42% (72 of 170) of the nonischemic groups. Occurrence of appropriate shocks was significantly reduced with statins in ischemic (13.4% vs 20.9%; relative risk 0.64, P = 0.028), but not in the patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Similarly, although use of statins lowered the intensity rate of appropriate shocks in ischemic patients (intensity rate ratio, 0.23; 95% confidence interval, 0.12-0.47), no such benefit was noted in the nonischemic group (intensity rate ratio, 1.27; 95% confidence interval, 0.37-4.40). In conclusion, statins reduced the occurrence and frequency of appropriate shocks for ventricular arrhythmias in ischemic but not in nonischemic cardiomyopathy. Larger, randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings.",

Activation of c-kit results, amongst others, in induction of the PI3K and MEK/Erk pathways. Comparison of two MEK inhibitors, the specific, widely used U0126 and the more selective PD0325901, in different MC models revealed severe differences on SF-induced expression of proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 as well as the transcription factor Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 2 (KLF2). Expression of the latter in MCs was not investigated so far. Whereas SF-induced expression of IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and KLF2 was unaltered by U0126, it was significantly augmented by PD0325901. The effect of PD0325901 was corroborated by a second selective MEK inhibitor, PD184352 (Cl-1040), indicating the presence of MEK/Erk-based negative feedback mechanism(s) downstream of c-kit activation. Further analysis of KLF2 production revealed a positive function of PI3K. Depending on additional stimuli (e.g. antigen, IGF-1, LPS, thapsigargin), SF-triggered KLF2 expression was differentially modified, most likely controlled by the respective ratio between MEK/Erk and PI3K pathway activation. Moreover, the statin, simvastatin, was demonstrated to upregulate expression of KLF2 in MCs. In conclusion, data obtained by solely using the MEK inhibitor U0126 have to be carefully corroborated by using more selective inhibitors, such as PD0325901 or PD184352. SF-induced expression of the transcription factor KLF2 and its regulation by the MEK/Erk and PI3K pathways could impact on physiological as well as pathophysiological MC functions.",

Since n-6 PUFA compete with n-3 PUFA for common metabolic enzymes, the n-6:n-3 ratio intake rather than the n-3 PUFA intake levels per se may be critical. We aimed to examine whether altering the n-6:n-3 ratio affects cardiovascular risk factors in hypercholesterolaemic patients on lipid management with statins. Adhering to a randomised, crossover study design, patients on statins (n 11) were placed on one of two dietary interventions (Diet high-ratio (HR) - n-6:n-3\u00a0=\u00a030:1 or Diet low-ratio (LR) - n-6:n-3\u00a0=\u00a01\u00b77:1) for 4 weeks followed after an 8-week washout period by the alternate diet. Foods enriched with n-3 or n-6 PUFA were delivered to each patient, who were given clear guidance on consumption expectations for the study. Measures of lipid profile, blood pressure and vascular function were determined. Diet LR significantly reduced body weight, LDL-cholesterol, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, blood pressure and the apoA-1:apoB ratio. While Diet HR trended towards a similar cardioprotective profile, most of the parameters examined did not reach statistical significance. A direct comparison between diets demonstrated no significant superiority of Diet LR over Diet HR. These results suggest that a dietary intervention focused on n-6 and n-3 fatty acids may improve cardiovascular risk factors in patients over and above standard lipid management, but there is no significant advantage of a low n-6:n-3 ratio diet when compared to a high-ratio diet.",

The adipocytes were incubated in vitro in the presence of atorvastatin and/or fenofibric acid. The secretory function of the cells was determined using ELISA assays. The visceral adipocytes released significantly more adiponectin and IL-6 and less PAI-1 than those that were obtained from subcutaneous tissue. The levels and patterns of adipokine release differed between the patients with or without lipid abnormalities and between the adipocytes that were obtained from visceral or subcutaneous adipose tissue. The culture that contained hypolipidemic drugs resulted in the significant changes of the release of adipokines. The effects of atorvastatin and fenofibric acid on the hormonal function of human adipocytes may be, in part, responsible for the clinical efficacy of these drugs in the prevention and treatment of dyslipidemia-related cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. The study supports the concept that the pleiotropic effects of fenofibrate and atorvastatin may be, in part, a result of their impact on the secretory function of adipocytes.",

Despite the fact that many studies have been performed and published, the action of cholesterol-lowering agents used to diminish the plasma cholesterol level is not fully understood yet. In this study, the effects of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor rosuvastatin and the new CYP51A1 inhibitor 2-((3,4-dichlorophenethyl)(propyl)amino)-1-(pyridin-3-yl)ethanol (LEK-935) on the proteome of primary human hepatocytes were analyzed for the first time. To get an idea about interindividual differences, two different human donors were used. The cytosolic and microsomal fractions of the cells were analyzed in a semiquantitative manner by two-dimensional-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and capillary high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, respectively. Thereby, a set of 44 proteins was found to be differentially presented. The chosen experimental set-up was validated by proteins already known to be affected by statins and involved in the cholesterol biosynthesis. Other proteins found to be regulated cannot be directly related to cholesterol metabolism and have not been described to be affected by cholesterol-lowering agents so far. Some of these proteins may represent interesting targets for further investigations into the analysis of severe side-effects as well as pleiotropic effects of the statins. During the proteome analysis of the two different donors, interindividual differences were observed that were validated by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction measurements. Thus, new information and a deeper insight into the processes taking place inside cells treated with cholesterol-lowering agents can be drawn from this study.",

Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into six groups: normal diet group, high-fat diet group, lovastatin (2.5 mg/kg) group and A-F-B (12.5, 25 or 50 mg/kg) groups. To evaluate the lipid-lowering effects of A-F-B, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), atherogenic index (AI) and coronary risk index (CRI) were investigated. The activities of phosphatidate phosphohydrolase (PAP) and hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase in hepatic tissue were evaluated. Treatment with A-F-B to hyperlipidemic rats resulted in a significant decline in TC, TG, LDL-C, AI and CRI, with an increase in HDL-C level. The results also showed that A-F-B significantly decreased the activities of PAP and HMG-CoA reductase in hepatic tissue. These findings suggest that A-F-B improves lipid profiles. The mechanisms of A-F-B were associated with regulating the activities of PAP and HMG-CoA reductase in hepatic tissue.",

    "170": "Human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC) were treated with atorvastatin (ATV) and TLR2 surface expression was determined by FACS analyses. Western blot analyses were used to explore the phosphorylation status of SP1.", 
    "171": "ATV profoundly inhibited basal and stimulated endothelial TLR2 expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner. It also inhibited HCAEC activation by MALP-2. TLR2 surface expression was inversely correlated to SP1 serine phosphorylation and was casein kinase 2 dependent.", 
    "172": "We demonstrate that ATV can control over-expression of proinflammatory endothelial TLR2 protein and TLR2-mediated endothelial activation. The mechanism involves casein kinase 2 and SP1 phosphorylation. ATV effects on endothelial cell TLR2 are comparable to those of laminar blood flow and might therefore also be atheroprotective.", 
    "173": "Valvular aortic stenosis (AS) produces a slowly progressive obstruction in left ventricular outflow track. For this reason, aortic valve replacement is warranted when the valvular stenosis is hemodinamically significant, becoming the most common worldwide cause of aortic valve surgery. Recent epidemiologic studies have revealed an association between degenerative AS and cardiovascular risk factors for atherosclerosis, althought reducing the exposure to such factors and statin therapies both fail to delay or reverse the pathology. Hence, a deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of this disease is required to identify appropriate preventive measures. A proteomic analysis of plasma will permit to know and identify the changes in protein expression induced by AS in this tissue. Using two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) followed by mass spectrometry (MS), we compared the crude (not pre-fractioned) and pre-fractioned plasma from AS patients and control subjects. We sought to identify plasma proteins whose expression is modified in AS. In addition we investigated if crude plasma presented some alterations in the more abundant proteins since to date, has never been studied before. We also further investigated the link between this disease and atherosclerosis with a view to identifying new potential markers and therapeutic targets.", 
    "174": "The aim of this study was to investigate if blood levels of trace and/or heavy metals are related to atherosclerosis in a cross-sectional study in elderly. In the population-based Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors (PIVUS) study (1016 subjects, all aged 70), the prevalence of carotid artery plaques was recorded by ultrasound. The numbers of carotid arteries with plaques (0, 1 or 2) were recorded. Also the thickness (IMT) and gray scale (IM-GSM) of the intima-media complex were measured together with plaque echogenicity. Eleven heavy metals and trace elements were analyzed in whole blood, using inductively coupled plasma-sector field mass spectrometry. Nickel levels were related to the number of carotid arteries with plaques in an inverted U-shaped manner after multiple adjustment for gender, waist circumference, body mass index, fasting blood glucose, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, HDL and LDL cholesterol, serum triglycerides, smoking, antihypertensive treatment and statin use (p=0.026). IM-GSM and plaque echogenicity were both inversely related to chromium in a linear fashion, and to aluminum in an inverted U-shaped manner (both p<0.0001 for IM-GSM). The relationships between metals and IMT were modest. Circulating levels of some metals, like nickel, aluminum and chromium, were related to atherosclerotic plaques or the echogenicity of the IM-GSM and overt plaques independently of cardiovascular risk factors, including lipids.", 
    "175": "The enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, a four-electron oxidoreduction that is the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of cholesterol and other isoprenoids. This study was designed to understand the mode of interactions of HMGCR isoform 2 with other statins. Hence, ligands such as Atorvastatin (DB01076), Lovastatin (DB00227), Fluvastatin (DB01095), Simvastatin (DB00641), Pravastatin (DB00175), Rosuvastatin (DB01098) and Cerivastatin (DB00439) were docked with enzymes HMGCR isoform 1 (pdb: 1DQ8) and modeled HMGCR isoform 2 (gi|196049380). Our homology modeling results were further processed to model the structure of human HMGCR isoform 2 and its accuracy was confirmed through RMS Z-scores (1.249). These interactions revealed that binding residues such as Arg515, Asp516, Tyr517 and Asn518 are found to be conserved in HMGCR isoform 2 with various statins. Our studies further concluded that Atorvastatin is most efficient inhibitor against both the isoforms of HMGCR whereas HMGCR isoform 2 shows less effectiveness with statins when compared with HMGCR isoform 1.", 
    "176": "Some patients who undergo lower extremity bypass (LEB) for critical limb ischemia ultimately require amputation. The functional outcome achieved by these patients after amputation is not well known. Therefore, we sought to characterize the functional outcome of patients who undergo amputation after LEB, and to describe the pre- and perioperative factors associated with independent ambulation at home after lower extremity amputation.", 
    "177": "Within a cohort of 3,198 patients who underwent an LEB between January, 2003 and December, 2008, we studied 436 patients who subsequently received an above-knee (AK), below-knee (BK), or minor (forefoot or toe) ipsilateral or contralateral amputation. Our main outcome measure consisted of a \"good functional outcome,\" defined as living at home and ambulating independently. We calculated univariate and multivariate associations among patient characteristics and our main outcome measure, as well as overall survival.", 
    "178": "Of the 436 patients who underwent amputation within the first year following LEB, 224 of 436 (51.4%) had a minor amputation, 105 of 436 (24.1%) had a BK amputation, and 107 of 436 (24.5%) had an AK amputation. The majority of AK (75 of 107, 72.8%) and BK amputations (72 of 105, 70.6%) occurred in the setting of bypass graft thrombosis, whereas nearly all minor amputations (200 of 224, 89.7%) occurred with a patent bypass graft. By life-table analysis at 1 year, we found that the proportion of surviving patients with a good functional outcome varied by the presence and extent of amputation (proportion surviving with good functional outcome = 88% no amputation, 81% minor amputation, 55% BK amputation, and 45% AK amputation, p\u00a0= 0.001). Among those analyzed at long-term follow-up, survival was slightly lower for those who had a minor amputation when compared with those who did not receive an amputation after LEB (81 vs. 88%, p = 0.02). Survival among major amputation patients did not significantly differ compared with no amputation (BK amputation 87%, p = 0.14, AK amputation 89%, p = 0.27); however, this part of the analysis was limited by its sample size (n = 212). In multivariable analysis, we found that the patients most likely to remain ambulatory and live independently despite undergoing a lower extremity amputation were those living at home preoperatively (hazard ratio [HR]: 6.8, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.94-49, p = 0.058) and those with preoperative statin use (HR: 1.6, 95% CI: 1.2-2.1, p = 0.003), whereas the presence of several comorbidities identified patients less likely to achieve a good functional outcome: coronary disease (HR: 0.6, 95% CI: 0.5-0.9, p = 0.003), dialysis (HR: 0.5, 95% CI: 0.3-0.9, p = 0.02), and congestive heart failure (HR: 0.5, 95% CI: 0.3-0.8, p = 0.005).", 
    "179": "A postoperative amputation at any level impacts functional outcomes following LEB surgery, and the extent of amputation is directly related to the effect on functional outcome. It is possible, based on preoperative patient characteristics, to identify patients undergoing LEB who are most or least likely to achieve good functional outcomes even if a major amputation is ultimately required. These findings may assist in patient education and surgical decision making in patients who are poor candidates for lower extremity bypass.", 
    "180": "The aim of the study is to determine the effect of posaconazole , an extended-spectrum triazole, on the pharmacokinetics of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, simvastatin.", 
    "181": "This randomized, fixed-sequence, parallel-group, single-center, open-label study was conducted in 35 healthy volunteers randomly assigned to receive one of three doses of oral posaconazole: 50, 100 or 200 mg. All subjects received single doses of the reference drug midazolam (2 mg oral) alone on day -9; simvastatin (40 mg oral) alone on day -6; posaconazole (50, 100 or 200 mg) on days 1 - 7 once daily (q.d.); posaconazole plus midazolam (day 8); posaconazole alone (days 9 - 10); posaconazole plus simvastatin (day 11) and posaconazole alone (days 12 - 13).", 
    "182": "Relative to simvastatin alone, posaconazole (50, 100 and 200 mg q.d.) significantly increased the C(max) and AUC of simvastatin (5- to 11-fold increase in AUC) and simvastatin acid (5- to 8-fold increase in AUC) during co-administration. Relative to midazolam alone, posaconazole (50, 100 and 200 mg q.d.) significantly inhibited CYP3A4-mediated metabolism of midazolam (three to sixfold increase in AUC).", 
    "183": "These findings support the classification of posaconazole as a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor. Simvastatin, or other statins predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4, should not be co-administered with posaconazole. Other statins, whose metabolism/elimination is not affected by CYP3A4 inhibition, should be considered for co-administration.", 
    "184": "Infection is a major medical problem in patients with acute stroke. Recent evidences suggest that statins reduce infection-associated complications. The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of statin treatment on mortality and functional outcomes in patients with stroke-associated infection.", 
    "185": "In this prospective observational cohort study, 514 patients with acute ischaemic stroke or transient ischaemic attack (mean age, 74 \u00b1 11 years; men, 48%) with infection occurring in the first 7 days after admission were included. We examined the effect of in-hospital statin treatment on mortality and favorable functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score \u22642) at 3 months follow-up.", 
    "186": "\u2002 Infection occurred at 0.93 \u00b1 1.49 days after admission. All patients had not received statin treatment prior to admission, and 121 patients (24%) received statin at 1.71 \u00b1 1.28 days after admission. Follow-up at 3 months was completed for 511 patients (99%). National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score and Charlson index were the most important independent predictors of mortality and functional outcome. Univariate [hazard ratio (HR), 0.82; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 0.47-1.42] and multivariate (HR, 1.68; 95% CI, 0.79-3.56) Cox regression analysis showed that statin did not significantly decrease the morality. In propensity analysis, statin treatment still had no significant association with mortality (HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 0.68-3.47) in the multivariate analyses after adjusting for age, sex, and propensity score.",
