An increase in albumin excretion has traditionally been considered to reflect a 'glomerular' leak of protein; however, it is now recognized that significant tubular reabsorption of albumin occurs under physiological conditions that may be modified by genetic determinants, systemic disease and drug therapies.", 
    "1": "The endocytosis of albumin by the proximal tubule is a highly regulated process depending on protein-protein interactions between several membrane proteins and scaffolding and regulatory molecules. The elucidation of these interactions is an ongoing research focus. There is also mounting evidence for a transcytotic pathway for retrieval of albumin from the tubular filtrate. The molecular basis for the role of albuminuria in both interstitial renal disease and cardiovascular pathology continues to be defined. The clinical implications of albuminuria due to a glomerular leak vs. reduced tubular reabsorption of albumin are, however, now under consideration. In particular, the prognostic implication of microalbuminuria induced by the more potent 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors is under study.",

    "4": "An 82-year-old white female was admitted to the hospital because of an international normalized ratio (INR) value greater than 8, which was detected at a routine follow-up visit to monitor warfarin therapy. Four weeks earlier her lipid-lowering therapy had been switched from atorvastatin 10 mg daily to simvastatin 10 mg daily. She had been treated with 2.5 mg of warfarin daily for almost 30 years due to episodes of deep venous thrombosis and lung embolism. Her INR had been stable within the treatment range (2.0-3.5) for more than 2 years before the INR increase. Upon hospitalization, she was given 5 mg of vitamin K orally. A few hours later she lost the feeling and movement of her right arm and a computed tomography scan showed major bleeding in the left cerebral hemisphere. She died the following day.", 
    "5": "One study has shown a lack of interaction between warfarin and atorvastatin. In comparison, 3 studies have shown significant increases (10-30%) in warfarin effect and/or reductions in dose requirement after starting concomitant simvastatin treatment. The interaction mechanism between simvastatin and warfarin is not known but is possibly associated with reduced elimination of warfarin. Use of the Naranjo probability scale showed that the likelihood of warfarin-induced INR increase following the switch to simvastatin was probable.",

The study included a voluntary pharmacogenetic component, enrolling 1,404 patients, which allowed association testing of baseline measures and longitudinal analysis of the 707 fluvastatin-treated and 697 placebo-treated individuals. A candidate gene approach, examining 42 polymorphisms in 18 genes, was used to test for association between selected polymorphisms and major adverse cardiac events, graft failure, change in LDL and HDL cholesterol, and baseline LDL and HDL cholesterol. Reported associations between cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) and baseline HDL cholesterol were replicated, with four previously implicated single nucleotide polymorphisms significantly associated in males and one in females; tests of reported associations between CETP and CV disease yielded varying results. We found no evidence for genetic factors affecting fluvastatin response.

    "12": "Mixed hyperlipidaemia is an important risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease. The global management of mixed hyperlipidaemia is often more difficult than the treatment of pure hypercholesterolaemia in terms of goal attainments. Despite the significant clinical benefits provided by statins, many patients with mixed hyperlipidaemia do not achieve their recommended low-density and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol target goals with statin monotherapy. The combination of ezetimibe plus fenofibrate is a new alternative to improve the overall atherogenic lipid profile of patients with mixed hyperlipidaemia. However, the absence of comparative data with statin monotherapy and of long-term clinical studies suggests reservation of the combination of ezetimibe plus fenofibrate as a second-line therapy. Nevertheless, this combination therapy of ezetimibe plus fenofibrate seems particularly useful for patients with a poor response or intolerance to statin monotherapy.",

We evaluated the relationship between prestroke statin use and pretreatment angiographic collateral grade among acute ischemic stroke patients presenting with occlusion of a major cerebral artery.

    "15": "Hypercholesterolemia is present in many patients with hypertension and adds a significant component of cardiovascular risk. The 3-hydroxy-3 methyl-glutarylcoenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol but also inhibit many of the structural and functional components of the arteriosclerotic process. Structural effects include reductions in vascular smooth muscle hypertrophy and proliferation, fibrin deposition, and collagen cross-linking. Among the functional effects are improvements in endothelial function, reduction in inflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species, and down-regulation of angiotensin II and endothelin receptors. These would be expected to reduce blood pressure in patients with hypertension; 14 studies have shown statin-induced decrease in blood pressure, but 11 studies showed no effect. Many of the studies had no placebo controls, were of short duration, or had small sample sizes, or combinations of these. Despite predictions made on the basis of the vasoprotective actions of statins, the blood-pressure-lowering effects of statins are at best modest.", 
    "16": "The metabonomic effects of hepatotoxic doses of pravastatin on the urinary metabolic profiles of female rats have been investigated using ultra performance liquid chromatography (UPLC)-oa-TOF-MS and, independently, by (1)H NMR spectroscopy. UPLC was performed using a 1 mm microbore column packed with 1.7 microm particles. Examination of the data obtained from the individual animals, aided by statistical interpretation of the data, made it possible to identify potential markers for toxicological effects, with both NMR and UPLC-MS analysis highlighting distinct changes in the urinary metabolite profiles. These markers, which included elevated taurine and creatine, as well as bile acids, were consistent with hepatotoxicity in some animals, and this hypothesis was supported by histopathological and clinical chemistry findings. The analytical data from both techniques could be used to define a metabolic \"trajectory\" as toxicity developed and to provide an explanation for the lack of hepatotoxicity for one of the animals. The two analytical approaches (UPLC-MS and NMR) were found to be complementary whilst the use of a 1mm i.d. x 100 mm column reduced the amount of sample required for analysis to 2 microL, compared with 10 microL for a 2.1mm i.d. x 100 mm column. The 1mm i.d. column also provided increased signal-to-noise without loss of chromatographic efficiency.", 
    "17": "We evaluated opportunities to initiate statin therapy in 574 consecutive subjects admitted to a chest pain observation unit (CPOU). Ten-year Framingham risk scores were retrospectively calculated for all patients according to the National Cholesterol Education Program and Adult Treatment Panel III 2001 recommendations. Subjects were then stratified according to (1) recommendations for initiation of a lipid-lowering medication and (2) whether they received lipid-lowering drug therapy at discharge. Of 574 subjects, we excluded 50 with previously established coronary heart disease or who were already taking a statin medication on presentation, 23 with missing data, and 80 who did not have a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) measurement at admission. Of the remaining 421 subjects, the mean age was 47 years, 40% were men, 57% were white, 31% had hypertension, 27% were current smokers, and 6% had diabetes. Ten-year risk calculation classified 47% (n=199) at low risk (<2 risk factors), 32% (n=134) at moderate risk (>or=2 risk factors and <10% risk), 11% (n=48) at moderate-high risk (10% to 20% risk), and 10% (n=40) at high risk (>20% risk). Of the entire cohort, 23% of subjects (n=96) had hypercholesterolemia, of which 52% (n=50) met indications for initiation of lipid-lowering medication. Only 6% of patients with an indication for treatment (n=3) were prescribed a lipid-lowering medication on discharge, leaving 94% (n=47) untreated for their hypercholesterolemia. In conclusion, patients admitted to a CPOU have a high prevalence of hypercholesterolemia, and therefore, an increased long-term risk for cardiovascular events. In addition to their primary role, CPOUs should focus on primary prevention and reduction of long-term risk.", 
    "18": "We tested the hypothesis that, compared with placebo, simvastatin would reduce the progression of coronary artery calcium (CAC) and abdominal aortic calcium (AAC) levels in participants asymptomatic for vascular disease. Total CAC and AAC were measured with multidetector cardiac computed tomography. Inclusion criteria were a CAC score of >or=50 Agatston units, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol level<or=50 mg/dl, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level between 100 and 160 mg/dl, and >or=2 other risk factors. Diabetes and history of vascular disease were exclusion criteria. Participants were randomized to receive 80 mg simvastatin (n=40) or matching placebo (n=40) for 12 months. Lipids were measured at 3-month intervals, and CAC and AAC measurements were repeated at 6 and 12 months. Total cholesterol, triglycerides, and LDL decreased significantly with simvastatin treatment (p<0.0001 for all comparisons, adjusted for baseline levels), whereas lipids remained unchanged for subjects randomized to receive placebo. Total CAC volume increased from baseline in both treatment groups. For subjects in the active treatment group, CAC volume increased by 9%, whereas in the placebo group, plaque volume increased by 5% (p=0.12 for treatment effect). AAC volume also increased in both treatment groups (p=0.15 for treatment effect). In conclusion, simvastatin treatment does not reduce progression of CAC or AAC compared with placebo.", 
    "19": "The lowering effects of ezetimibe/simvastatin combination therapy on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP) were compared with those of simvastatin or atorvastatin monotherapy in a large cohort of patients with primary hypercholesterolemia. To compare ezetimibe/simvastatin with simvastatin, data were combined from 3 identical, prospective 12-week trials in which patients were randomized to receive placebo; ezetimibe 10 mg; ezetimibe 10 mg added to simvastatin 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg; or simvastatin 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg. To compare ezetimibe/simvastatin with atorvastatin, data were analyzed from a phase III double-blind, active-controlled study in which patients were randomized equally to receive ezetimibe/simvastatin 10/10, 10/20, 10/40, or 10/80 mg or atorvastatin 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg for 6 weeks. When averaged across doses, ezetimibe/simvastatin produced significantly greater reductions compared with simvastatin alone in LDL cholesterol (52.5% vs 38.0%, respectively) and CRP levels (31.0% vs 14.3%, respectively). At each individual simvastatin dose, co-administration with ezetimibe produced significant further CRP reductions versus simvastatin alone. Ezetimibe/simvastatin was significantly more effective at lowering LDL cholesterol than atorvastatin when pooled across doses (53.4% vs 45.3%, respectively) and in each milligram-equivalent dose comparison. Reductions in CRP of similar magnitude were observed with ezetimibe/simvastatin and atorvastatin when averaged across doses and at each milligram-equivalent statin dose comparison. In conclusion, the lipid-modulating and anti-inflammatory effects of ezetimibe/simvastatin provide additional benefits not realized by statin monotherapy alone.", 
    "20": "In an effort to identify hepatoselective inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, two series of pyrroles were synthesized and evaluated. Efforts were made to modify (3R,5R)-7-[3-(4-fluorophenyl)-1-isopropyl-4-phenyl-5-phenylcarbamoyl-1H-pyrrol-2-yl]-3,5-dihydroxy-heptanoic acid sodium salt 30 in order to reduce its lipophilicity and therefore increase hepatoselectivity. Two strategies that were explored were replacement of the lipophilic 3-phenyl substituent with either a polar function (pyridyl series) or with lower alkyl substituents (lower alkyl series) and attachment of additional polar moieties at the 2-position of the pyrrole ring. One compound was identified to be both highly hepatoselective and active in vivo. We report the discovery, synthesis, and optimization of substituted pyrrole-based hepatoselective ligands as potent inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase for reducing low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "21": "Statins can reduce adverse myocardial remodeling independently of their cholesterol-lowering ability. We have previously reported that simvastatin inhibits tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha)-induced cardiac myofibroblast invasion and MMP-9 secretion, key events in this remodeling process. The aim of the present study was to investigate the mechanisms underlying this effect. Selective MMP-9 gene silencing with siRNA oligonucleotides revealed that myofibroblast invasion through a Matrigel barrier (Boyden chamber assay) was MMP-9-dependent. In contrast, cell migration (in the absence of Matrigel) was MMP-9-independent. Simvastatin, a commonly prescribed statin, inhibited both invasion and migration of myofibroblasts and disrupted the actin cytoskeleton as determined by confocal microscopy of rhodamine-phalloidin staining. All these effects of simvastatin were mimicked by the Rho-kinase inhibitor Y27632. TNFalpha activated the ERK-1/2, p38 MAPK, PI-3-kinase and NF-kappaB pathways but not the JNK pathway, as determined by immunoblotting with phospho-specific antibodies. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that TNFalpha-induced MMP-9 mRNA expression was substantially reduced by pharmacological inhibitors of the ERK-1/2, PI-3-kinase and NF-kappaB pathways. However, none of the signal transduction pathways studied was influenced by simvastatin treatment. Moreover, despite reducing MMP-9 secretion, simvastatin had no effect on MMP-9 promoter activity (luciferase reporter assay) and actually increased MMP-9 mRNA levels. In summary, simvastatin reduces TNFalpha-induced invasion of human cardiac myofibroblasts through two distinct mechanisms: (i) by attenuating cell migration via Rho-kinase inhibition and subsequent cytoskeletal disruption, and (ii) by decreasing MMP-9 secretion via a post-transcriptional mechanism.", 
    "22": "Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) of the lower limbs is the third most important site of atherosclerotic disease alongside coronary heart disease (CHD) and cerebrovascular disease (CVD). Best medical treatment is beneficial even in patients who eventually need invasive treatment, as the safety, immediate success, and durability of intervention is greatly improved in patients who adhere to best medical treatment. In recent years, a number of studies have suggested that the ACE-inhibitor ramipril and different statins, together with antiplatelet drugs, reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in PAD. Patients with PAD are really a category of patients with a very high cardiovascular risk burden for fatal and nonfatal cerebrovascular and cardiovascular events; therefore, they need to be treated not only for local problems deriving from arteriopathy (intermittent claudication, rest pain and/or ulcers) but, above all, for preventing vascular events. Statins not only lower the risk of vascular events, but they also improve the symptoms associated with PAD. Statins exert beneficial pleiotropic effects on hemostasis, vasculature and inflammatory markers; there is also evidence that statins improve renal function considering that the plasma creatinine level is considered as an emerging vascular risk factor.",

Those in the highest (high ADMA, n = 15) and lowest quartiles of the ADMA distribution (low ADMA, n = 13) were eligible to receive, in a randomized order, simvastatin (40 mg/day), L-arginine (3 g/day), or a combination of both, each for 3 weeks. Endothelium-dependent vasodilation (EDD) was assessed by brachial artery ultrasound.", 
    "26": "Simvastatin had no effect on EDD in subjects with high ADMA (6.2 +/- 1.2% vs. 6.1 +/- 0.9%), whereas simvastatin plus L-arginine significantly improved EDD (9.8 +/- 1.5% vs. 5.3 +/- 0.8%; p < 0.01). In subjects with low ADMA, simvastatin improved endothelial function when given alone (9.5 +/- 3.2% vs. 6.1 +/- 3.8%; p < 0.001) or in combination with L-arginine (9.0 +/- 3.1% vs. 6.3 +/- 3.3%; p = 0.001). L-arginine alone improved endothelial function in both groups. Endothelium-independent vasodilation was not affected.", 
    "27": "Simvastatin does not enhance endothelial function in subjects with elevated ADMA, whereas it does so in patients with low ADMA. Combination of simvastatin with oral L-arginine improves endothelial function in subjects with high ADMA, but has no additional effect in subjects with low ADMA. As NO-mediated effects may play a major role in the therapeutic effects of statins, ADMA concentration is an important factor that influences the \"pleiotropic\" effects of simvastatin.", 
    "28": "Statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) are currently the most effective medications for reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. Although generally safe, they have been associated with a variety of myopathic complaints. Statins block production of farnesyl pyrophosphate, an intermediate in the synthesis of ubiquinone or coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10). This fact, plus the role of CoQ10 in mitochondrial energy production, has prompted the hypothesis that statin-induced CoQ10 deficiency is involved in the pathogenesis of statin myopathy. We identified English language articles relating statin treatment and CoQ10 levels via a PubMed search through August 2006. Abstracts were reviewed and articles addressing the relationship between statin treatment and CoQ10 levels were examined in detail. Statin treatment reduces circulating levels of CoQ10. The effect of statin therapy on intramuscular levels of CoQ10 is not clear, and data on intramuscular CoQ10 levels in symptomatic patients with statin-associated myopathy are scarce. Mitochondrial function may be impaired by statin therapy, and this effect may be exacerbated by exercise. Supplementation can raise the circulating levels of CoQ10, but data on the effect of CoQ10 supplementation on myopathic symptoms are scarce and contradictory. We conclude that there is insufficient evidence to prove the etiologic role of CoQ10 deficiency in statin-associated myopathy and that large, well-designed clinical trials are required to address this issue. The routine use of CoQ10 cannot be recommended in statin-treated patients. Nevertheless, there are no known risks to this supplement and there is some anecdotal and preliminary trial evidence of its effectiveness. Consequently, CoQ10 can be tested in patients requiring statin treatment, who develop statin myalgia, and who cannot be satisfactorily treated with other agents. Some patients may respond, if only via a placebo effect.", 
    "29": "A sensitive liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometric (LC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for the determination of rosuvastatin in human plasma. The plasma samples were prepared using liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl ether. Chromatographic separation was accomplished on a Zorbax XDB-C18 (150 mm x 4.6 mm i.d., 5 microm) column. The mobile phase consisted of methanol-water (75:25, v/v, adjusted to pH 6 by aqueous ammonia). Detection of rosuvastatin and the internal standard (IS) hydrochlorothiazide was achieved by ESI MS/MS in the negative ion mode. The lower limit of quantification was 0.020 ng/ml by using 200 microl aliquots of plasma. The linear range of the method was from 0.020 to 60.0 ng/ml. The intra- and inter-day precisions were lower than 8.5% in terms of relative standard deviation (RSD), and the accuracy was within -0.3 to 1.9% in terms of relative error (RE). Compared with the existing methods, the validated method offered increased sensitivity. The method was successfully applied for the evaluation of pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin after single oral doses of 5, 10 and 20 mg rosuvastatin to 10 healthy volunteers.", 
    "30": "The role of leptin in the pathomechanism of atherosclerosis, through its free radical generating ability is established. Its effect however, on the regulation of intracellular cholesterol synthesis has not been studied. The aim of the present study was to elucidate whether leptin influences endogenous cholesterol synthesis in monocytes. Furthermore, leptin signaling to HMG CoA reductase in control and hypercholesterolemic monocytes were compared. The in vitro effect of leptin was studied on freshly isolated human monocytes obtained from healthy control volunteers and patients with hypercholesterolemia. Our results can be summarized as follows: (1) Leptin is able to increase endogenous cholesterol synthesis in human monocytes in vitro. (2) The cholesterol synthesis increasing effect of the hormone is more pronounced in hypercholesterolemic monocytes with high basal cholesterol biosynthesis. (3) The leptin-induced Ca(2+) signal was involved in the enhancement of HMG CoA reductase activation in monocytes from both controls and hypercholesterolemic patients. (4) In control monocytes the Ca(2+) signal originated from intracellular pools, whereas in patients, Ca(2+)-influx and protein kinase C activation were found to be responsible for the leptin-effect. Mevalonate cycle inhibiting fluvastatin and 25-hydroxycholesterol decreased cholesterol production in leptin-stimulated monocytes. Our present study provides the first proof of the cholesterol synthesis enhancing effect of leptin through a statin-sensitive pathway in circulating monocytes. Furthermore our results suggest that leptin can be involved in the pathomechanism of atherosclerotic plaque formation also through its effect on cholesterol biosynthesis in monocytes.", 
    "31": "Statins are effective cholesterol-lowering drugs that reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease events (heart attacks, strokes, and the need for arterial revascularisation). Adverse effects from some statins on muscle, such as myopathy and rhabdomyolysis, are rare at standard doses, and on the liver, in increasing levels of transaminases, are unusual. Myopathy--muscle pain or weakness with blood creatine kinase levels more than ten times the upper limit of the normal range--typically occurs in fewer than one in 10,000 patients on standard statin doses. However, this risk varies between statins, and increases with use of higher doses and interacting drugs. Rhabdomyolysis is a rarer and more severe form of myopathy, with myoglobin release into the circulation and risk of renal failure. Stopping statin use reverses these side-effects, usually leading to a full recovery. Asymptomatic increases in concentrations of liver transaminases are recorded with all statins, but are not clearly associated with an increased risk of liver disease. For most people, statins are safe and well-tolerated, and their widespread use has the potential to have a major effect on the global burden of cardiovascular disease.", 
    "32": "Neutrophil infiltration is a major determinant of ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI). Statins improve endothelial function by elevating nitric oxide synthase activity and inhibiting adhesion molecule expression and may, therefore, inhibit IRI-induced neutrophil extravasation. Although statins are protective against myocardial IRI and stroke, a role for statins in ameliorating skeletal muscle IRI has not yet been confirmed. This study, therefore, addressed the hypothesis that simvastatin would attenuate the severity of tissue damage during skeletal muscle IRI.", 
    "33": "Rats were administered simvastatin for 6 d before 4 h hind limb ischemia and 24 h reperfusion. Neutrophil infiltration was assessed using myeloperoxidase (MPO) assays and tissue damage by quantitative immunohistochemical analysis of collagen IV. The effect of reducing nitric oxide levels on the severity of IRI was assessed by administering the NOS inhibitor, N-Imino-L-ornithine (L-NIO), before ischemia.", 
    "34": "Simvastatin significantly inhibited IRI-induced MPO activity but not collagen degradation in postischemic skeletal muscle. Inhibition of nitric oxide synthase by L-NIO markedly inhibited neutrophil infiltration and protected against IRI-induced collagen degradation. When both simvastatin and L-NIO were administered before IRI, the IRI-induced elevation in MPO activity was completely inhibited. However, paradoxically, simvastatin counteracted the protective effect of L-NIO against IRI-induced collagen IV degradation.", 
    "35": "The inhibition by simvastatin of IRI-induced neutrophil infiltration in skeletal muscle suggests that statins may be a useful therapy to attenuate the severity of IRI but their precise mechanisms of action remains to be determined.

It is unclear how the expression level of HMG CoA reductase in cardiovascular tissues compares with that in cells derived from the liver.

Isopimaric acid (10 microM)-mediated enhancement of the BK(Ca) amplitude was reversed by external simvastatin. Simvastatin Na+ (10 microM, applied internally), markedly attenuated isopimaric acid (10 microM)-induced enhancement of the BK(Ca) amplitude.

Mononuclear cells isolated from blood were quantified for EPCs by flow cytometry (CD133/VEGFR-2 cells) and assayed in culture for EPC colony-forming units (CFUs). In 23 patients, EPCs were stained for annexin-V as a marker of apoptosis, and nitrite was measured in blood as an indicator of intravascular nitric oxide.",

Those patients whose EPCs increased from baseline showed significant increases in nitrite and reduction in annexin-V staining (both P < .01) versus no change in patients without increase in EPCs. Over the course of the program, EPCs increased prior to increase in nitrite in the blood.",

    "49": "Statins are reported to be beneficial in treating a multitude of disorders including dementia due to Alzheimer disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VaD) with varying, yet-to-be determined mechanisms of actions. Although cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs) are still recommended as the primary drug of choice for AD and related diseases, their efficacy is frequently questioned. We recently reported that alpha7-neuronal acetylcholine nicotinic receptor (alpha7-nAChR)-mediated neurogenic vasodilation of porcine cerebral arteries was blocked by ChEIs, and this blockade was prevented by statin pretreatment. The exact mechanism of interaction between ChEIs and statins remains unclear. Activation of alpha7-nAChRs located on perivascular postganglionic sympathetic nerve terminals releases norepinephrine, which then acts on presynaptic beta(2)-adrenoceptors located on neighboring nitrergic nerve terminals, resulting in nitric oxide release and vasodilation. The present study, therefore, was designed to determine whether interaction of ChEIs and statins occurs at the alpha7-nAChR level. We examined effects of concurrent application of ChEIs and statins on alpha7-nAChR-mediated inward currents in primary neuronal cultures of rat superior cervical ganglion cells, the origin of the perivascular sympathetic innervation to the cerebral arteries. The results indicated that physostigmine, neostigmine, and galantamine inhibited choline- and nicotine-induced whole cell currents in a concentration-dependent manner. This inhibition, which was noncompetitive in nature, was prevented by concurrent application of mevastatin and lovastatin in a concentration-dependent manner. These results suggest that statins protect alpha7-nAChR function directly at the receptor level. Since alpha7-nAChR is neuroprotective, having beneficial effects on memory and cerebral vascular function, its functional inhibition by ChEIs may explain in part the limitation of its effectiveness in AD and VaD therapy. Protection of alpha7-nAChR function from ChEI inhibition by concurrent administration of statins may provide an alternative strategy in improving the efficacy of AD and VaD therapy.",

    "64": "The earliest structural change in hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension is increased proliferation of adventitial fibroblasts. This fibroproliferative response occurs in acute and chronic hypoxic models, is dependent on p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation, is selective for the pulmonary circulation, and would seem an important therapeutic target. Simvastatin attenuates pulmonary vascular remodeling in animal models, but additional information regarding mechanisms of action, differential antiproliferative effects and dose responses of available statins is required for appropriate clinical trial design. Our objectives were to determine the effects of statins on acute hypoxia-induced proliferation and p38 MAP kinase activation in pulmonary and systemic artery fibroblasts, to assess the effects of cholesterol intermediates, prenyltransferase and related inhibitors, and to determine the statin's mechanism of action. Atorvastatin, fluvastatin, and simvastatin inhibited adventitial fibroblast proliferation. At low doses (1 microM), this effect was selective for hypoxic (versus serum-induced) proliferation and was also selective for pulmonary (versus systemic) fibroblasts. Complete inhibition of hypoxia-induced p38 MAP kinase activity was achieved at this 1-microM dose. The lipophilic statins exhibited similar potency. The statin effect was reversed by geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate and mimicked by geranylgeranyl transferase and Rac1 inhibitors. Hypoxia-induced p38 MAP kinase activation and proliferation in pulmonary adventitial fibroblasts is dependent on a geranylgeranylated signaling protein, probably Rac1. One micromolar of fluvastatin exhibits a circulation- and stimulus-selective antiproliferative effect on pulmonary artery fibroblasts. The pharmacokinetics of fluvastatin would suggest that its antiproliferative effects may be useful in pulmonary hypertension associated with hypoxia.", 
    "65": "A growing body of experimental evidence suggests the therapeutic potential of diosgenin, a steroid [corrected] saponin against several cancers. However, precise molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the modes of action of this compound against colon cancer remain only partially understood. In this study, we investigated if the anticancer mechanism of diosgenin in HCT-116 human colon carcinoma cells involves modulation in the expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl Co-enzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. Diosgenin treatment resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in the viability and growth of HCT-116 cells. The IC(50) cytotoxic dose of diosgenin in HCT-116 was approximately 35 microM after 24h, while concentrations of approximately 32 microM or greater decreased the percent viable cells by 50%. Higher doses of diosgenin (30-40 microM) effectively inhibited recovery of cells for up to 24h post-treatments. At sub-cytotoxic doses, diosgenin induced a dose-dependent increase in apoptotic demise. In part, the apoptotic mechanism was through the cleavage of the 116 kDa poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase protein to the 85kDa fragment. The expression of HMG-CoA reductase at both mRNA and protein levels was significantly lowered by increasing concentrations of diosgenin. This was accompanied by a concomitant dose-dependent decrease in the expression of p21 ras and beta-catenin. In conclusion, our data demonstrates that the food saponin, diosgenin is a potent inhibitor of HCT-116 human colon carcinoma cells by growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis. Importantly, our result identifies that the growth suppressive or apoptotic activity of diosgenin may involve cholesterol homeostasis.", 
    "66": "Statins are associated with adverse effects in skeletal muscle. This study tested the hypothesis that atorvastatin would increase the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) at rest and during exercise. Twenty-eight healthy subjects (mean age 52 years) were enrolled in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study of the effects of atorvastatin (40 mg/day) on whole body energetics over 8 weeks. Ventilatory gas exchange measurements, at rest and during bicycle ergometry, were used to assess muscle oxidative metabolism. Thirteen subjects from each treatment arm completed the study. Eight weeks of atorvastatin lowered plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration but had no effect on resting or submaximal energy expenditure, RER, or calculated fatty acid oxidation rates. Atorvastatin did not affect maximal exercise oxygen consumption or the anaerobic threshold. Eight weeks of atorvastatin therapy was not associated with alterations in substrate oxidation, or muscle oxidative function at rest, or during exercise in healthy adults.", 
    "67": "Although HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as statins are the most widely used cholesterol-lowering agents, there is a risk of myopathy or rhabdmyolysis occurring in patients taking these drugs. It has been reported that a number of lipophilic statins cause apoptosis in various cells, but it is still not clear whether intracellular acidification is involved in statin-induced apoptosis. There have been few studies aimed at identifying compounds that suppress statin-induced myotoxicity. In the present study, we examined the relationship between cerivastatin-induced apoptosis and intracellular acidification and the effect of bicarbonate on cerivastatin-induced apoptosis using an RD cell line as a model of in vitro skeletal muscle. Cerivastatin reduced the number of viable cells and caused dramatic morphological changes and DNA fragmentation in a concentration-dependent manner. Moreover, cerivastatin-induced apoptosis was associated with intracellular acidification and caspase-9 and -3/7 activation. On the other hand, bicarbonate suppressed cerivastatin-induced pH alteration, caspase activation, morphological change and reduction of cell viability. Accordingly, bicarbonate suppressed statin-induced apoptosis. The strategy to combine statins with bicarbonate can lead to reduction in the chance of the severe adverse events including myopathy or rhabdmyolysis.",

All high-risk patients should receive lifestyle counselling. In patients with CVD the use of acetylsalicylic acid and often, depending on the specific disease, a beta-blocker or an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor are recommended. The use of a statin is recommended if the LDL-cholesterol concentration is > or = 2.5 mmol/l. In patients with DM2, the use of statins is recommended if LDL-cholesterol is > or = 2.5 mmol/l and use of a blood pressure lowering drug with a systolic blood pressure > or = 140 mmHg, as well as glucose lowering drugs. In patients without CVD and DM2, the need for drug treatment will be determined by estimation of the absolute 10-year mortality risk of CVD. Treatment is recommended if this risk exceeds 10%.

Recent studies have also focused on vascular pathologies and showed impaired endothelial function, suggesting that atherosclerotic alterations could also be involved in increased cardiovascular mortality. Novel findings suggest that chronic systemic inflammation is involved in these cardiac and vascular pathologies. Thus, spondyloarthritides and ankylosing spondylitis are associated with increased levels of circulating inflammatory mediators such as C-reactive protein. Interestingly, ankylosing spondylitis patients may also have an atherogenic lipid profile and disturbances in their T-helper lymphocyte subsets, which may be involved in cardiovascular disease development.

In present study, we compared the Ang II-triggered free radical generation of neutrophils obtained from patients with relatively isolated forms of metabolic syndrome (MS) with membrane-bound cholesterol content and membrane fluidity. We determined the enhancement of Ang II-induced superoxide anion and leukotriene C(4) (LTC(4)) generation, membrane fluidity and cell-bound cholesterol content of neutrophils obtained from 12 control subjects, 11 patients with obesity (Ob), 10 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (t2-DM) and 12 patients with HC. The alteration of signal processing was studied after preincubation with different inhibiting drugs. Superoxide anion, LTC(4) production and membrane rigidity were increased in the following order: control < Ob < t2-DM < HC. Both Ang II-induced superoxide anion and LTC(4) generation were decreased in control cells by pertussis toxin and fluvastatin (Flu), whereas in each patient group, mepacrin, verapamil and Flu were effective, suggesting alterations in signal pathways, which may be attributed to isoprenylation. The enhancement of superoxide anion and LTC(4) generation correlated significantly with membrane rigidity, independently from the experimental groups and membrane-bound cholesterol content. Membrane rigidity of neutrophils, obtained from patients with MS, plays a role in Ang II-induced free radical generation independent of intracellular cholesterol homeostasis.", 
    "102": "The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, statins, have pleiotropic effects which may include interference with the isoprenylation of Ras and Rho small GTPases. Statins have beneficial effects in animal models of pulmonary hypertension, although their mechanisms of action remain to be determined. Serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] is implicated in the process of pulmonary artery smooth muscle (PASM) remodeling as part of the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertension. We examined the effect of atorvastatin on 5-HT-induced PASM cell responses. Atorvastatin dose dependently inhibits 5-HT-induced mitogenesis and migration of cultured bovine PASM cells. Inhibition by atorvastatin was reversed by mevalonate and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP) supplement, suggesting that the statin targets a geranylgeranylated protein such as Rho. Concordantly, atorvastatin inhibits 5-HT-induced cellular RhoA activation, membrane localization, and Rho kinase-mediated phosphorylation of myosin phosphatase-1 subunit. Atorvastatin reduced activated RhoA-induced serum response factor-mediated reporter activity in HEK293 cells, indicating that atorvastatin inhibits Rho signaling, and this was reversed by GGPP. While 5-HT-induced ERK MAP and Akt kinase activation were unaffected by atorvastatin, 5-HT-induced ERK nuclear translocation was attenuated in a GGPP-dependent fashion. These studies suggest that atorvastatin inhibits 5-HT-induced PASM cell mitogenesis and migration through targeting isoprenylation which may, in part, attenuate the Rho pathway, a mechanism that may apply to statin effects on in vivo models of pulmonary hypertension.",

Possible modifying risk factors such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension should continue to be pursued aggressively. All patients should receive statins. Clinical trials will provide the evidence needed to ascertain whether mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitors should be used in de novo cardiac transplant recipients to attenuate cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV). Intravascular ultrasound appears to play a key role in the diagnosis and evaluation of new treatments, and may indeed represent a surrogate marker that can be used to tailor management and improve outcomes. A better understanding of CAV is needed to develop targeted preventive therapies. Ongoing research in native atherosclerosis and vascular biology may provide answers within the next decade.",

The primary efficacy end point was a significant decrease from baseline to long-term follow-up low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) level; the primary safety end point was a significant increase from baseline in ALT level. The mean change in LDL level was a reduction of 22% (p<0.01).

LAM is a disease predominantly affecting women and is exacerbated by pregnancy; only a lung transplant can save the life of a patient. It has been discovered that in LAM, somatic or genetic mutations of tumor suppressor genes tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) or TSC2 occur and the TSC1/TSC2 protein complex functions as a negative regulator of the mTOR/S6K1 signaling pathway. These two pivotal observations paved the way for the first rapamycin clinical trial for LAM. The recent discoveries that TSC1/TSC2 complex functions as an integrator of signaling networks regulated by growth factors, insulin, nutrients, and energy heightened the interest regarding this rare disease because the elucidation of disease-relevant mechanisms of LAM will promote a better understanding of other metabolic diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases. In this review, we will summarize the progress made in our understanding of TSC1/TSC2 cellular signaling and the molecular mechanisms of LAM; we will also highlight some of the lesser explored directions and challenges in LAM research.",

The patients had persistently positive crossmatches with their living related donors and a panel reactive antibody titer of more than 20%. All patients received IVIG (500 mg/kg per day on alternate days for a total of six doses); panel reactive antibody (PRA) titer and crossmatch testing were carried out after each dose and before each subsequent one. Two months after the last dose, eight patients received simvastatin (20 mg/day) for a period of 2 months; PRA titer and crossmatch testing were carried out every two weeks. Only four patients showed an insignificant reduction of PRA activity (P = 0.36); no patient attained a negative crossmatch. Simvastatin also resulted in an insignificant reduction of anti-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies in three patients (P = 0.32). We propose that IVIG or simvastatin alone can not effectively inhibit preformed anti-HLA antibodies to allow successful renal transplantation. Further trials on the use of IVIG and simvastatin with other modalities of treatment to desensitize these patients may be warranted.",

UA was measured by a colorimetric method. FBF, RH and FMD were measured by brachial artery ultrasound. Regression analyses were used to assess whether UA was associated with FBF, RH and FMD before and after adjustment for age, sex, systolic BP, diabetes, total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, smoking, body mass index (BMI), C-reactive protein (CRP), serum creatinine, alcohol intake, statin and diuretic use and brachial artery diameter (BAD). UA was significantly associated with FBF (P<0.0001) and RH (P=0.0001) but not with FMD (P=0.43). After adjustment for the covariates listed above, higher UA level remained independently associated with a higher FBF (P=0.012) and lower RH (P=0.004). The independent predictors were as follows: (a) higher FBF: lower age, higher BMI, history of smoking, statin use, higher CRP, higher BAD and higher UA levels; (b) lower RH: higher BMI, diabetes and higher UA levels; (c) lower FMD: greater age, male sex, higher BMI, history of smoking, statin use and higher BAD. We conclude that in hypertensive individuals, higher UA levels are associated with higher resting FBF and lower RH, markers of microvascular function, but not with brachial artery FMD.",

Some of these studies investigated the general impact of a statin on blood pressure (BP) among various other factors, while others were specifically designed to determine this effect. Data from animal studies are conflicting but the majority of human studies in the field report a beneficial effect, and most available statin compounds are reported to lower BP levels. Recent clinical studies using ambulatory BP measurements support these findings. Although the exact actions of statins involved in this effect are unknown, several possible mechanisms can be hypothesized. This review summarizes existing data on the effect of statins on BP, aiming to give an overview of the current knowledge and to provide perspectives for future research in the field.",

Selective coronary angiography showed significant involvement. The father had a history of hypercholesterolemia and confirmed coronary artery disease involving 3 vessels. Angiography showed anterioapical and inferiobasal hypokinesis with preserved left ventricle systolic function. The mother and the other two siblings did not have hyperlipidemia, thereby indicating heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia in the two affected siblings.

Among the most widely used mouse models for atherosclerosis are apolipoprotein E-deficient (ApoE-/-) and LDL receptor-deficient (LDLr-/-) mice. An up-and-coming model is the ApoE*3Leiden (E3L) transgenic mouse. Here, we review studies that have explored how and to what extent these mice respond to compounds directed at treatment of the risk factors hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hypertension, and inflammation. An important outcome of this survey is that the different models used may differ markedly from one another in their response to a specific experimental manipulation. The choice of a model is therefore of critical importance and should take into account the risk factor to be studied and the working spectrum of the compounds tested.",

The cholesterol-lowering drug simvastatin has been shown to stimulate bone formation by increasing the gene expression of bone morphogenetic protein-2 and vascular endothelial growth factor. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of local simvastatin application on bone defect healing and compare the amount of new bone produced by simvastatin gelatin sponge graft with that produced by a gelatin sponge graft and with natural healing. Twenty-one bone defects at 3 mm diameter were created in the angulus mandible region of Wistar albino rats. In the experimental group, nine defects were grafted with simvastatin dissolved in water mixed with a gelatin sponge. In the control groups, eight defects were grafted with water mixed with a gelatin sponge alone (active control) and six were left empty (passive control). Animals were killed on day 14 and the defects were prepared for radiologic and histologic assessment. Density of the regenerate was evaluated by peripheral quantitative computed tomography. The density of the experimental group was 240% more than the passive control group and 190% more than the active control group (P < 0.01).

However, its role in platelet aggregation is unclear. Both aspirin and HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) reduce LOX-1 expression in endothelial cells. In this study, we investigated the effect of aspirin and pravastatin on LOX-1 expression on plate-lets. After ADP stimulation, mean fluorescence intensity of LOX-1 expression on platelets increased 1.5- to 2.0-fold. Blocking LOX-1 inhibited ADP-induced platelet aggregation in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. We also established that LOX-1 is important for ADP-stimulated inside-out activation of platelet alpha(IIb)beta(3) and alpha(2)beta(1) integrins (fibrinogen receptors). The specificity of this interaction was determined by arginine-glycine-aspartate-peptide inhibition. Furthermore, we found that LOX-1 inhibition of integrin activation is mediated by inhibition of protein kinase C activity. In other experiments, treatment with aspirin (1-10 mM) and pravastatin (1-5 microM) reduced platelet LOX-1 expression, with a synergistic effect of the combination of aspirin and pravastatin. Aspirin and pravastatin both reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) released by activated platelets measured as malonyldialdehyde (MDA) release and nitrate/nitrite ratio. Aspirin and pravastatin also enhanced nitric oxide (NO) release measured as nitrite/nitrite + nitrate (NOx) ratio in platelet supernates. Small concentrations of aspirin and pravastatin had a synergistic effect on the inhibition of MDA release and enhancement of nitrite/NOx. Thus, LOX-1 is important for ADP-mediated platelet integrin activation, possibly through protein kinase C activation. Furthermore, aspirin and pravastatin inhibit LOX-1 expression on platelets in part by favorably affecting ROS and NO release from activated platelets.",

The diagnosis of ALS is often problematic, and the insidiousness and chronicity of the disease make causality with a drug difficult to assess. The disproportionally high reporting makes this an important signal nevertheless, since ALS is serious clinically and statins are so widely used.

In hypertensive patients, the dietary sodium intake should be limited to 65 mmol/day to 100 mmol/day. Other lifestyle modifications for both normotensive and hypertensive patients include: performing 30 min to 60 min of aerobic exercise four to seven days per week; maintaining a healthy body weight (body mass index of 18.5 kg/m2 to 24.9 kg/m2) and waist circumference (less than 102 cm in men and less than 88 cm in women); limiting alcohol consumption to no more than 14 units per week in men or nine units per week in women; following a diet reduced in saturated fat and cholesterol, and one that emphasizes fruits, vegetables and low-fat dairy products, dietary and soluble fibre, whole grains and protein from plant sources; and considering stress management in selected individuals with hypertension. For the pharmacological management of hypertension, treatment thresholds and targets should take into account each individual's global atherosclerotic risk, target organ damage and any comorbid conditions: blood pressure should be lowered to lower than 140/90 mmHg in all patients and lower than 130/80 mmHg in those with diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease. Most patients require more than one agent to achieve these blood pressure targets. In adults without compelling indications for other agents, initial therapy should include thiazide diuretics; other agents appropriate for first-line therapy for diastolic and/or systolic hypertension include angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (except in black patients), long-acting calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) or beta-blockers (in those younger than 60 years of age). First-line therapy for isolated systolic hypertension includes long-acting dihydropyridine CCBs or ARBs. Certain comorbid conditions provide compelling indications for first-line use of other agents: in patients with angina, recent myocardial infarction, or heart failure, beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors are recommended as first-line therapy; in patients with cerebrovascular disease, an ACE inhibitor plus diuretic combination is preferred; in patients with nondiabetic chronic kidney disease, ACE inhibitors are recommended; and in patients with diabetes mellitus, ACE inhibitors or ARBs (or, in patients without albuminuria, thiazides or dihydropyridine CCBs) are appropriate first-line therapies. All hypertensive patients with dyslipidemia should be treated using the thresholds, targets and agents outlined in the Canadian Cardiovascular Society position statement (recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of dyslipidemia and prevention of cardiovascular disease). Selected high-risk patients with hypertension who do not achieve thresholds for statin therapy according to the position paper should nonetheless receive statin therapy.

Age-matched Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) gavaged by distilled water were used as normal controls (WKY group, n = 6). By using these rats, we observed the effects of atorvastatin on LV hypertrophy and fibrosis, and investigated atorvastatin-induced cell apoptosis and p27 protein expression. In addition, the serum lipid concentration and blood pressure level were also measured in this study. 10 weeks later, a significant decrease in the cardiosomatic ratio, LV weight to body weight ratio and cardiomyocyte transverse diameter, as well as myocardial hydroxyproline and collagen content was observed in the atorvastatin-treated SHR. In addition, atorvastatin increased the positive rate of cell apoptosis and p27 protein expression. A decreased serum lipid concentration and a reduced systolic blood pressure level were also found in the atorvastatin-treated SHR. These findings demonstrated a beneficial effect of atorvastatin on adverse LV remodeling in SHR, and the induction of cell apoptosis and upregulation of p27 protein may serve as the underlying mechanisms of this action.",

    "185": "Over 20 large-scale prospective studies show that the inflammatory biomarker high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) is an independent predictor of future cardiovascular events that additionally predicts risk of incident hypertension and diabetes. In many studies, the relative impact of hsCRP is at least as large as that individually of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, blood pressure, or smoking, and knowledge of hsCRP correctly reclassifies a substantial proportion of \"intermediate-risk\" individuals into clinically relevant higher- or lower-risk categories. Other studies show the relative benefit of statins to be greater among those with increased hsCRP and that achieved hsCRP levels after statin therapy predict recurrent event rates as much as achieved levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Nonetheless, it remains controversial whether the time has come to modify traditional algorithms used for global risk detection. As described here, 6 areas of controversy regarding hsCRP are resolvable with a consensus position that focuses in primary prevention on selective use among individuals with 5% to 20% 10-year risk as estimated by Adult Treatment Panel III, and focuses in secondary prevention on high-risk patients being treated with statin therapy. Forthcoming trial data could expand or contract this \"screen selectively\" policy, and investigators should be open to the possibility that second-generation inflammatory biomarkers may be developed that supplant hsCRP altogether. In the meantime, however, this consensus position on hsCRP should be one to which both advocates and critics of the inflammatory hypothesis of atherosclerosis can adhere because it is one that can immediately improve patient care.",

There were no clinically relevant differences between statins in adverse events or incidence of creatine kinase >10 times the upper limit of normal, alanine aminotransferase >3 times the upper limit of normal on 2 consecutive occasions, or proteinuria or hematuria over the relatively short duration of treatment. In conclusion, statin therapy was well tolerated and effective in decreasing LDL cholesterol in patients of South-Asian origin, with the 10- and 20-mg doses of rosuvastatin and atorvastatin allowing most patients to reach recommended LDL cholesterol goals.",

The aims of this study were to evaluate and clarify characteristics of patients with AMI in whom standard statin therapy has beneficial effects against a secondary event in a real-world setting. Between 1999 and 2004, 4,075 patients with AMI were registered and followed prospectively, of whom 1,404 (matched by propensity scores) were analyzed. Statin use was defined as prescription on discharge from the hospital, and the control group was not prescribed statins at discharge. The primary end point was total mortality rate. Final follow-up was performed in June 2006 (median 4.1 years), and follow-up rate was 97.2%. During follow-up, 139 patients died, including 87 (12.4%) from the control group and 52 (7.4%) from the statin group. The hazard ratio for statin therapy was 0.64 (95% confidence interval 0.45 to 0.90, p = 0.011) throughout the study. Early statin therapy was strongly correlated with a lower risk of cardiovascular death, less recurrence of AMI, and less heart failure. Statin therapy was particularly beneficial for men, patients > or =60 years of age, and patients with a high low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level > or =155 mg/dl.
