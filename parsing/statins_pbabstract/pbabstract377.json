Addition of oxotremorine-M to SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells resulted in rapid increases in the phosphorylation of FAK (t(1/2) = 2 min) and paxillin that were independent of integrin-extracellular matrix interactions, cell attachment, and the production of phosphoinositide-derived second messengers. In contrast, the increased tyrosine phosphorylations of FAK and paxillin were inhibited by inclusion of either cytochalasin D or mevastatin, agents that disrupt the cytoskeleton. Furthermore, phosphorylation of FAK and paxillin could be prevented by addition of either wortmannin or LY-294002, under conditions in which the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate was markedly attenuated. These results indicate that muscarinic receptor-mediated increases in the tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK and paxillin in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells depend on both the maintenance of an actin cytoskeleton and the ability of these cells to synthesize phosphoinositides.", 
    "1": "Ras and Rho are involved in the regulation of signal transduction events governing cell growth and cell proliferation. Protein prenylation is essential for the activation and/or the translocation of these small GTPases; however, protein geranylgeranylation rather than farnesylation is required for G1/S transition. We studied prenylation and translocation of Ras and Rho A during G1/S progression in growth-stimulated rat thyroid FRTL-5 cells. Immunoblot analysis revealed that both Ras and Rho A were detected in membrane fractions at G0. Rho A was eliminated from the membrane fraction during G1 and was not detected on the membrane at mid-G1. Translocation of Rho A from the cytoplasm back to the membranes was observed during late G1 phase. In contrast, Ras remains in the membrane fraction through the cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase. The immunoprecipitation of Rho A from the membrane fraction demonstrated that newly synthesized Rho A, labeled by pulsing cells with [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine, was geranylgeranylated and associated with the membrane in late G1. These results indicate that Rho A, not Ras, was eliminated from membrane fraction during G1 progression and that newly synthesized Rho A is geranylgeranylated and translocated to membranes during G1/S progression in growth-stimulated FRTL-5 cells.", 
    "2": "Recently, the Regression Growth Evaluation Statin Study (REGRESS) demonstrated the synergistic, antiatherogenic effect of lipid-lowering therapy with pravastatin in combination with calcium antagonists. This combination retarded the progression of stenosis and reduced the number of new lesions more effectively than did statin therapy alone. In the present study, our objective was to elucidate the mechanism of this more pronounced effect of the statin-calcium antagonist combination on the atherosclerotic lesion. Smooth muscle cells cultured from the subendothelial intima of the human aorta were incubated with whole blood serum or with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) taken from patients cotreated with lovastatin and amlodipine. Serum added to the cells cultured from the atherosclerotic lesion reduced cell cholesterol. Such an antiatherosclerotic effect of cotreatment with amlodipine-lovastatin was revealed in this study and was more pronounced than the effect of treatment with either amlodipine or lovastatin alone. LDL isolated from atherogenic plasma stimulated cell cholesterol accumulation. Treatment with amlodipine alone and the amlodipine-lovastatin combination ameliorated the atherogenic effect of LDL. As compared with amlodipine alone, the combination demonstrated a considerably higher antiatherogenic effect on LDL atherogenicity. Amlodipine-lovastatin cotreatment increased sialic acid and decreased the susceptibility of LDL to oxidation more effectively than amlodipine alone. In addition, combination therapy reduced the LDL negative charge, while amlodipine alone was impotent. These findings may serve as an explanation of the more pronounced antiatherogenic effect at the lipoprotein level of amlodipine-lovastatin combined therapy compared with amlodipine therapy alone.",

    "8": "We estimated the lifelong costs and benefits of the modification of lipid levels achieved with lovastatin based on published studies and a validated CHD prevention computer model. Patients were middle-aged men and women without CHD, with mean total serum cholesterol levels of 6.67, 7.84, and 9.90 mmol/L (258, 303, and 383 mg/dL), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels of 1.19 mmol/L (46 mg/dL), as described in clinical trials. We estimated the cost per year of life saved for dosages of lovastatin ranging from 20 to 80 mg/d that reduced the total cholesterol level between 17% and 34%, and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level between 4% and 13%.", 
    "9": "After discounting benefits and costs by 5% annually, the average cost-effectiveness of lovastatin, 20 mg/d, ranged from $11,040 to $52,463 for men and women. The marginal cost-effectiveness of 40 mg/d vs 20 mg/d remained in this range ($25,711 to $60,778) only for persons with baseline total cholesterol levels of 7.84 mmol/L (303 mg/dL) or higher. However, the marginal cost-effectiveness of lovastatin, 80 mg/d vs 40 mg/d, was prohibitively expensive ($99,233 to $716,433 per year of life saved) for men and women, irrespective of the baseline total cholesterol level.",

At current drug prices, treatment with 40 mg/d is also cost-effective for total cholesterol levels of 7.84 mmol/L (303 mg/dL) or higher. However, treatment with 80 mg/d is not cost-effective for primary prevention of CHD.", 
    "11": "An HMG-CoA reductase inhibition assay was developed and validated for quantitation of atorvastatin in human, dog, rat, and mouse plasma. Atorvastatin was isolated from plasma by protein precipitation. Rat-liver microsomes were used to provide the reductase enzyme. The method was validated by assaying calibration standards and quality controls in triplicate on each of the 3 days. A customized computer program was used for data calculation. Quantitation of the assay ranged from 0.36 to 16 ng/ml of atorvastatin in different plasma matrices. Assay precision and accuracy, based on the coefficient of variation and percent relative error, respectively, of quality controls were 10.4% to 14.5% and within +/- 6.25% in human; 4.89% to 10.6% (+/- 8.13%) in dog; 2.68% to 8.62% (+/- 5.00%) in rat; and 3.68% to 8.96% (+/- 5.38%) in mouse plasma. The method has been applied to pharmacokinetic studies of atorvastatin in human and toxicokinetic studies in dog, rat, and mouse after atorvastatin administration. Atorvastatin equivalent concentrations in a set of plasma samples from subjects receiving single and multiple doses of atorvastatin were determined by validated HMG-CoA reductase inhibition assays at four different laboratories. Results were compared using linear regression and concordance correlation statistical procedures. Good agreements among these data indicated that results from different laboratories with the same validated method can be used interchangeably.", 
    "12": "Existing methods to analyse data from repeated arteriographic progression/regression studies are restrictive and do not fully explore the dynamics of coronary artherosclerosis. We present a new approach making a distinction between new occlusions, new lesions, and growth of existing lesions. Random effect models, based on the logistic, the Poisson, and the normal distribution are proposed with correlation depending on distance. The data from the Regression Growth Evaluation Statin Study (REGRESS) are used to validate the model. Lipid lowering treatment of pravastatin resulted in less growth of existing lesions and fewer new lesions than when placebo was given. Fewer new lesions were found in segments influenced by percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) than in segments not influenced by PTCA. Similarly, the growth of lesions influenced by PTCA was smaller than lesions not influenced by PTCA. More new occlusions were found in segments influenced by coronary arterial bypass grafting (CABG) than in segments not influenced by CABG, but 98 per cent of the new occlusions were located proximal to the bypass anastomosis. Similarly, existing lesions proximal to the bypass anastomosis showed larger growth (p < 0.001). We conclude that our new approach for analysing the arteriographic data from repeated coronary arteriographic studies appeared a fruitful way to analyse the dynamics of coronary atherosclerosis.", 
    "13": "The effect of pravastatin, an inhibitor of p21ras isoprenylation, on hepatocarcinogenesis induced by N-nitrosomorpholine and on p21ras isoprenylation were investigated in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Rats received i.p. injections of pravastatin (10 and 20 mg kg(-1) body weight) every other day and, from the beginning of the experiment, were given drinking water containing N-nitrosomorpholine for 8 weeks. Visible white nodules and hepatic lesions staining positively for gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase or glutathione-S-transferase, placental type, were examined macroscopically or histochemically. In week 15, pravastatin at both dosages significantly reduced the incidence, number and volume of visible white nodules. Quantitative histological analysis also showed that prolonged administration of pravastatin at both dosages resulted in significant reductions in the number and percentage area of hepatic lesions positive for gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and glutathione-S-transferase, placental type. Administration of pravastatin also significantly decreased the amount of membrane-associated p21ras in the tumour and the labelling index of neoplastic nodules and increased the apoptoic indices of neoplastic nodules. These findings indicate that pravastatin suppresses hepatocarcinogenesis and suggest that this effect might be related to pravastatin's inhibition of p21ras isoprenylation and its subsequent inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis in neoplastic lesions.",

While this material is not commonly used as a conduit because of limited success in the past, this case demonstrates that, given the right circumstances, long-term patency is possible. Since available conduits for CABG are quite often limited, viable alternatives may be lifesaving and require further evaluation. In addition to mechanical considerations such as size, length, and material, anticoagulation and strict management of hyperlipidemia may be critical.", 
    "19": "The optimistic bias favouring intervention in medicine has long been known, and it may be fair to say that compensating for this characteristic tendency of human judgement is a primary reason for the need for blind trials and evidence-based medicine. Packer has observed that \"Physicians frequently decide to prescribe a drug because of the therapeutic gains it might provide (based on pathophysiological theories) rather than the benefits it actually delivers (as demonstrated by the results of controlled clinical trials).\" In the present case, sorting out evidence from optimism, what we know from what we wish to be so, is a challenging task for the clinician trying to determine what to recommend to his/her patients in day-to-day practice. In the case of lipid-lowering therapies, the optimistic preference for positive results is widely evident. Ravsknov showed that trials finding a positive result have been cited six times as often as equally sound trials finding no effect. (The LRC alone was cited 612 times in the first 4 years after its publication.) The LRC trial results themselves (interpreted with appropriate statistical tests) were inconclusive and difficult to generalize, but were presented as definitive and generalizable with certainty. Subsequent papers have been more circumspect, but none the less have generally focused on CHD reduction (a positive result) while giving minimal discussion to overall mortality. In this vein, the finding of increase in mortality due to violence has been dismissed outright (e.g. p. 1243 of the Helsinki Study) though it has appeared in fibrate and bile acid sequestrant trials, there is a dose-response relationship, and the same effect is observed in non-human primates. Clinically, increased violence as a side effect may no longer be relevant, as recent analyses suggest that it is specific to fibrates (and to hormones, not used any longer); the currently favoured statin drugs do not so far appear to share this side effect, but it was dismissed by enthusiasts for lipid lowering long before such data existed. Estimates of the effect of lipid lowering are often inflated by including secondary prevention studies, as well as by assertions that 5-year NNTs underestimate the benefits of lipid lowering although analysis of primary prevention trials indicates that the full benefit of risk reduction is evident within 5 years. What is the family doctor to do? Clearly, not all the claims in the literature can be taken at face value, particularly when advanced by content-area experts invested in lipid research. Hence, it seems to fall to the family physician to translate these claims into honest expectations of benefit for the variety of patients we see, with their various levels of risk. Perhaps the best solution is to be found in combining the sound clinical epidemiology approach taken by Rembold with the honest extrapolation of effect according to baseline risk used by the CTF. We do now have the necessary estimates of NNT for primary prevention to inform our higher-risk patients: an NNT of 53 for CHD events certainly does justify our recommending statin drugs to middle-aged significantly hyperlipidaemic men, especially if they have multiple risk factors. The situation is less clear for lower-risk patients, such as women, the elderly and mildly dyslipidaemic men with no or few other risk factors. Even including the recent data on the statin drugs, the 5-year NNT for prevention of a CHD event in average-risk mildly hyperlipidaemic clinical populations (extrapolated using the CTF method) is 212. What intervention if any the family physician wishes to make, and the patient wishes to take, should be a matter negotiated between them, informed by the family physician's realistic appraisal of the patient's likely expected benefit.", 
    "20": "The effects of atorvastatin on the expression of the hepatic HMG-CoA reductase and LDL receptor genes were investigated in rats. Like the other statins, atorvastatin increased the rate of degradation and presumably cycling of the hepatic LDL receptor. In atorvastatin-treated rats, the half-life of the receptor was decreased by over 60%. Hepatic HMG-CoA reductase mRNA levels were increased about 3-fold by feeding a diet containing 0.04% atorvastatin while reductase protein levels were increased by as much as 700-fold. Apparent HMG-CoA reductase activity was not increased as much as protein levels. Washing experiments revealed that atorvastatin is more difficult to remove from microsomes than lovastatin. The results support the conclusion that the potent hypocholesterolemic action of atorvastatin involves decreased hepatic VLDL production due to effective inhibition of in vivo cholesterol biosynthesis resulting from diminished recovery of HMG-CoA reductase activity following drug treatment.",

    "23": "There are various ways in which data for economic evaluations may be obtained, including via clinical trials and via economic modelling. There are numerous advantages and disadvantages associated with each method, although it is generally assumed that economic models lack the accuracy required for the calculation of meaningful cost-effectiveness data. In order to assess the predictive accuracy of economic modeling in the context of cholesterol-modifying pharmacotherapy it is possible to compare predicted coronary heart disease (CHD) incidence estimates obtained using CHD risk equations derived from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) with actual CHD incidence rates achieved in a major clinical trial, the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS). FHS-derived CHD risk equations substantially underestimate the actual risks of nonfatal myocardial infarction obtained by WOSCOPS. However, in predicting risks of death from CHD, FHS-derived CHD risk equations estimate extremely accurately the incidence obtained by WOSCOPS. For example, from WOSCOPS the risk of an individual fulfilling the trial entry criteria incurring nonfatal myocardial infarction or CHD death in 4.9 years is 0.079 for placebo group and 0.055 for the intervention group. Therefore, the relative risk for the intervention group relative to placebo group is 0.696, implying a risk reduction of 30%. Comparable risks predicted using FHS-derived CHD risk equations are 0.116 for the placebo group and 0.088 for the intervention group. Consequent relative risks and risk reductions for the intervention relative to placebo are 0.757 and 24%, respectively. Using both model and trial estimates of CHD incidence in an economic evaluation of cholesterol-modifying pharmacotherapy, incremental costs per life year gained are 41,707 Pounds using WOSCOPS data and 36,480 Pounds using FHS-derived CHD risk equations.", 
    "24": "Using a probe derived from the 5'-untranslated region of the human mevalonate kinase (MK) cDNA, we screened a lambda gt 11 genomic library and obtained a single clone containing the 5' untranslated region of the gene. Nucleotide sequencing identified several putative regulatory elements, including two Sp1 (GC box) elements and a CCAAT box. A canonical TATA box was not detected. Directly adjacent to one Sp1 element was a sterol regulatory element (SRE), 5'-CACCCCAG-3', which was a 7/8 base pair match to the consensus sequences identified in the genes encoding 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A synthase and reductase, and the LDL receptor. There was no Sp1 element upstream of the SRE. Northern blot analysis in human CRL1508T cells revealed that quantities of MK poly A+ RNA increased for cells grown in the presence of lipid-deficient calf serum, and further increased upon addition of 1 microM lovastatin. Primer extension analysis with human poly A+ RNA suggested at least 4 transcription initiation sites downstream from the CCAAT box. To assess sterol responsiveness of transcription initiation, a 1.4 kb genomic fragment upstream of the translational start site was fused to the pSV2cat vector for transient expression in COS-7 cells, with chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) as the reporter gene. This construct demonstrated modest levels of CAT expression which was induced > 2-fold when cells were grown in lipoprotein-deficient calf serum. Our data provide further evidence for coordinate regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis in response to sterol.", 
    "25": "In this study the effects of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) on cell cycle and apoptosis of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells were investigated to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the antineoplastic potential of this retinoid in breast cancer. The antiproliferative effect of ATRA was evaluated by DNA content measurements and dual-parameter flow cytometry of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation and of the expression of cell cycle-related proteins (Ki-67 as proliferation marker and statin as quiescence marker) vs DNA content. Apoptosis was also studied by flow cytometry of either DNA content or Annexin V labelling. After 10(-6) M ATRA treatment, the fraction of S-phase cells decreased significantly, and cells accumulated in the G0/G1 range of DNA contents. Dual-parameter flow cytograms showed a decrease in the percentage of Ki-67-labelled cells (after 10 days, only 20% of the cells were still positive for Ki-67 compared with 95% in controls), while the fraction of statin-positive cells increased slightly. From 3 days of treatment onwards, apoptosis was found to occur. These results show that ATRA-induced inhibition of MCF-7 cell growth is related to two mechanisms, i.e. the block of cell proliferation, mostly in a pre-S phase, and the induction of apoptosis. These results should be taken into account when attempting to design treatment programmes that associate ATRA with antineoplastic compounds of different cell cycle specificity.", 
    "26": "Insulin resistance is characterized principally by impaired insulin-mediated glucose uptake which provokes a compensatory increase in pancreatic beta-cell secretory activity. For a time this may produce well-controlled plasma glucose levels but as the insulin resistance worsens the augmented insulin production becomes inadequate to keep plasma glucose at euglycemia leading to the development of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), accompanied by hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia. A number of metabolic defects are associated with NIDDM including obesity, hypercoagulability, cardiovascular disease risk factors such as hypertension and dyslipidemia and these constitute the insulin resistance syndrome. The identity of the biochemical factor that might link all these defects is not yet known. We have hypothesized that platelet-activating factor (1-O-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, PAF) may be such a link. In this study, we measured plasma acetylhydrolase (EC.1.1.48), which degrades PAF to the inactive metabolise lyso-PAF, as a surrogate for PAF activity in three groups of hypercholesterolemic subjects: lean controls (n = 9), non-diabetic obese (n = 6) and NIDDM subjects (n = 6). The ages and body mass indices of the subjects were 46 +/- 3.1 and 24.2 +/- 2.2 for the lean controls, 52 +/- 2.5 and 28.7 +/- 0.9 for the NIDDM subjects and 60 +/- 2 and 27.6 +/- 2.1 for the obese, non-diabetic subjects (mean +/- S.E.M.). The measurements were made before and after therapy with the cholesterol-lowering drug lovastatin, a 3-hydroxy 3 methylglutaryl (HMG) coenzyme. A reductase inhibitor (40 mg/day) for 3 months. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels were 91 +/- 11, 96 +/- 3 and 146 +/- 11 mg/dl, for the lean, obese and NIDDM subjects, respectively, before therapy began. Lovastatin did not affect FPG in any of the three subject groups. Before treatment, the fasting plasma insulin (FPI) levels were 6.1 +/- 0.92, 10.83 +/- 2.03 and 14.68 +/- 3.64 mU/l for the lean, non-diabetic obese and NIDDM subjects, respectively. After lovastatin therapy only the obese group exhibited a significant change in FPI (15.35 +/- 2.47 mU/l) (P < 0.05). Total cholesterol levels were similar in all three groups both before and after lovastatin therapy but within each group lovastatin therapy significantly reduced the total cholesterol by 32, 29 and 34% in the lean, obese and NIDDM subject groups respectively (P < 0.0001). Lovastatin therapy reduced LDL-cholesterol levels by 40, 32 and 46% in the lean, obese and NIDDM subjects, respectively, but produced no significant effect on HDL or triglyceride levels. Before therapy, the plasma acetylyhydrolase activities were 104 +/- 7, 164 +/- 7 and 179 +/- 7 nmol/ml per min in the lean, obese and NIDDM subjects, respectively. Lovastatin therapy reduced plasma acetylhydrolase levels to 70 +/- 7, 87 +/- 6 and 86 +/- 7 nmol/ml per min in the lean, obese and NIDDM subjects, respectively. Plasma acetylhydrolase activity was predominantly (> 80%) associated with LDL cholesterol both before and after lovastatin treatment. Also, plasma acetylhydrolase activity significantly correlated with fasting plasma insulin levels before lovastatin therapy but not after. Taken together, this study clearly implicates PAF metabolism in three defects associated with the insulin resistance syndrome: hypercholesterolemia, obesity and NIDDM. Additionally, we conclude that chronic hyperinsulinemia may play a significant role in the production of plasma acetylhydrolase.",

Cyclosporine trough concentration data were also collected from cardiac transplant recipients (n=32) who received simvastatin for the treatment of hyperlipidaemia. Cyclosporine daily dosage and total concentration (monoclonal FPIA method) were recorded for periods up to 6 months before and after simvastatin administration. The total number of dose rate-concentration observations was 172 before and 135 after simvastatin administration respectively. Using a population pharmacokinetic approach (implemented in P-PHARM software) the ratio of dose rate to trough concentration at steady state (DR/C[SS trough]), an estimation of apparent clearance, was determined. The posterior Bayesian estimate of DR/C(SS trough) was calculated for each patient before and after simvastatin administration.",

    "31": "Hypoxia induces vasoconstriction, in part, by down-regulating endothelial cell nitric oxide synthase (ecNOS) expression. Previous studies indicate that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors improve endothelium-dependent relaxation by increasing ecNOS activity. To determine whether HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can prevent hypoxia-mediated down-regulation of ecNOS function and expression, human endothelial cells were exposed to hypoxia (3% O2) in the presence of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors simvastatin and lovastatin for various durations (0-48 h). Hypoxia decreased ecNOS protein and mRNA levels in a time-dependent manner, resulting in a 4- and 9-fold reduction after 48 h, respectively. In a concentration-dependent manner, simvastatin, and to a lesser extent, lovastatin, prevented the down-regulation of ecNOS expression by hypoxia. Simvastatin-induced changes in ecNOS expression correlated with changes in endothelial NO production and were reversed by treatment with L-mevalonate. Actinomycin D studies revealed that under hypoxic conditions, simvastatin increased ecNOS mRNA half-life from 13 to 38 h. Nuclear run-on studies showed that simvastatin had no effect on repression of ecNOS gene transcription by hypoxia. These results indicate that HMG CoA reductase inhibitors regulate ecNOS function and expression through changes in ecNOS mRNA stability and suggest that treatment with HMG CoA reductase inhibitors may have beneficial effects in patients with hypoxia-mediated pulmonary hypertension.", 
    "32": "This study explores the role of mevalonate inhibitors in the activation of NF-kbeta and the induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6) in rat primary astrocytes, microglia, and macrophages. Lovastatin and sodium phenylacetate (NaPA) were found to inhibit LPS- and cytokine-mediated production of NO and expression of iNOS in rat primary astrocytes; this inhibition was not due to depletion of end products of mevalonate pathway (e.g., cholesterol and ubiquinone). Reversal of the inhibitory effect of lovastatin on LPS-induced iNOS expression by mevalonate and farnesyl pyrophosphate and reversal of the inhibitory effect of NaPA on LPS-induced iNOS expression by farnesyl pyrophosphate, however, suggests a role of farnesylation in the LPS-mediated induction of iNOS. The inhibition of LPS-mediated induction of iNOS by FPT inhibitor II, an inhibitor of Ras farnesyl protein transferase, suggests that farnesylation of p21(ras) or other proteins regulates the induction of iNOS. Inhibition of LPS-mediated activation of NF-kbeta by lovastatin, NaPA, and FPT inhibitor II in astrocytes indicates that the observed inhibition of iNOS expression is mediated via inhibition of NF-kbeta activation. In addition to iNOS, lovastatin and NaPA also inhibited LPS-induced expression of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6 in rat primary astrocytes, microglia, and macrophages. This study delineates a novel role of the mevalonate pathway in controlling the expression of iNOS and different cytokines in rat astrocytes, microglia, and macrophages that may be important in developing therapeutics against cytokine- and NO-mediated neurodegenerative diseases.", 
    "33": "Low density lipoprotein (LDL) reduction independent of LDL receptor regulation was investigated using HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in LDL receptor-deficient mice. In males, LDL cholesterol dose-dependently decreased with atorvastatin treatment after 1 week. As untreated mice grew older, their LDL cholesterol progressively rose above basal levels, but was quelled with atorvastatin treatment. In females, atorvastatin treatment time-dependently decreased LDL cholesterol levels and induced hepatic HMG-CoA reductase activity. Unlike males, cholesterol-lowering effects of the drug were sustained in females. Lovastatin, simvastatin, and pravastatin also reduced total and LDL cholesterol; however, additional studies in females demonstrated that atorvastatin caused the greatest dose-dependent and sustained effect after 2 weeks. In females, hepatic HMG-CoA reductase mRNA inversely correlated with LDL cholesterol lowering, with atorvastatin showing the greatest increase in mRNA levels (17.2-fold), followed by lovastatin (10.7-fold), simvastatin (4.1-fold), and pravastatin (2.5-fold). Atorvastatin effects on lipoprotein production were determined after acute (1 day) or chronic (2 week) treatment prior to intraperitoneal injection of Triton WR1339. Acute treatment reduced cholesterol (-29%) and apoB (-16%) secretion, with no change in triglyceride secretion. In contrast, chronic treatment elevated cholesterol (+20%), apoB (+31%), and triglyceride (+57%) secretion. Despite increased cholesterol and apoB secretion, plasma levels were reduced by 51% and 46%, respectively. Overall, under acute or chronic conditions, apoB paralleled cholesterol secretion rates, and triglyceride to cholesterol secretion ratios were elevated by 38% and 32%, respectively. We propose that atorvastatin limits cholesterol for lipoprotein assembly, which is compensated for by triglyceride enrichment. In addition, with either acute or chronic atorvastatin treatment, apoB-100 secretion was blocked, and compensated for by an increased secretion of apoB-48. The apoB-48 particles produced are cleared by LDL receptor-independent mechanisms, with an overall effect of reducing LDL production in these mice. These studies support the idea that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors modulate lipoprotein levels independent of LDL receptors, and suggest they may have utility in hyperlipidemias caused by LDLreceptor disorders.", 
    "34": "Pravastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, inhibits coronary transplant vasculopathy in the clinical setting. To further delineate the immune modulatory effect of this agent, it was tested in a rat cardiac transplant model of chronic rejection.", 
    "35": "Rat heterotopic abdominal cardiac transplants were performed using a Lewis to Fischer 344 combination. Fischer 344 recipients received a brief course of cyclosporine to decrease the incidence of acute rejection. Experimental groups were treated with either high-dose (10 mg/kg) or low-dose (5 mg/kg) pravastatin for 120 days, while a control group did not receive pravastatin. The effect of pravastatin on chronic rejection of cardiac allografts was analyzed by histology, and the expression of laminin, fibronectin, macrophages, and T cells was assessed by immunohistochemistry.", 
    "36": "Coronary transplant vasculopathy was inhibited in both groups of pravastatin-treated animals, as compared with controls. Immunohistochemistry revealed that control animals had degraded laminin and fibronectin which paralleled the degree of tissue necrosis. In contrast, pravastatin-treated animals had modest amounts of extracellular matrix proteins retained within intermyocytes and endothelium, a pattern seen in native cardiac tissue. The pravastatin-treated groups also had fewer graft-infiltrating macrophages, specifically within the arterial intima and perivascular areas.", 
    "37": "Progressive chronic vascular rejection, a leading cause of allograft failure, can be inhibited by pravastatin in a well-defined rat cardiac transplant model. Pravastatin appears to inhibit the synthesis and subsequent degradation of extracellular matrix proteins and block the infiltration of macrophages to the graft, which emphasizes that this inflammatory cell plays a major role in the pathogenesis of transplant chronic rejection.", 
    "38": "To assess the effect of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors on plasma cholesterol concentrations and on platelet aggregation, lovastatin or fluvastatin, 40 mg daily, was given to hypercholesterolemic patients. After 24 weeks, plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations were reduced by 37% after lovastatin therapy and 29% after fluvastatin therapy. The platelet cholesterol/phospholipid ratio was reduced by 33% and 26%, respectively. Platelet aggregation was significantly reduced by 12-15% (p < 0.01) after 4 weeks of therapy with either agent. Lovastatin or fluvastatin therapy reduced platelet aggregation through an in vivo hypocholesterolemic action on the platelet cholesterol content and also through a direct effect on platelet function, as a result of drug binding to the platelets. We also studied the effect of these HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on LDL susceptibility to oxidation. LDL oxidation (induced by copper ions) was reduced by 31% after lovastatin therapy and by 37% after fluvastatin therapy. The inhibitory effect of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on LDL oxidation involved their stimulatory effect on the removal of LDL from the circulation and a direct binding effect of the drugs to the lipoprotein. Because HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors can inhibit platelet aggregation, macrophage foam cell formation, and LDL oxidation, major contributors to atherogenesis, the use of these drugs can significantly attenuate the atherosclerotic process.", 
    "39": "Inducing renal cytochrome P4504A (P4504A) activity with clofibrate prevents the development of hypertension in Dahl salt-sensitive (Dahl S) rats. To determine if this also occurs with other antilipidemic agents, we compared the effects of a related drug, fenofibrate, with those of an unrelated agent, pravastatin, on blood pressure, renal histology, and P4504A activity. Dahl S rats were pretreated with fenofibrate (95 mg/kg per day), pravastatin (70 mg/kg per day), or vehicle for 7 days before and after being switched from a low-salt (0.1% NaCl) to a high-salt (8.0% NaCl) diet. After 3 weeks on the high-salt diet, mean arterial pressures averaged 183+/-13 (n=9), 126+/-10 (n=9), and 148+/-11 mm Hg (n=8), respectively, in vehicle-, fenofibrate-, and pravastatin-treated animals. Both drugs reduced the degree of proteinuria and glomerular injury. P4504A protein levels and the synthesis of 20-hydroxyeicosa-5,8,11,14-tetraenoic acid (20-HETE) were increased in the liver and kidney of fenofibrate-treated, but not pravastatin-treated rats. We also administered these agents to Dahl S rats in which hypertension had previously been induced by a high-salt diet. Mean arterial pressures averaged 164+/-10, 113+/-23, and 160+/-15 mm Hg in rats treated with vehicle, fenofibrate, or pravastatin for 3 weeks. Fenofibrate-treated rats exhibited a natriuresis. Proteinuria and glomerular injury were reduced by pravastatin but not by fenofibrate. These results indicate that fenofibrate prevented the development of hypertension and reduced subsequent glomerular injury in Dahl S rats, probably secondary to increased renal production of 20-HETE. Although pravastatin did not induce renal P4504A activity in these animals, it reduced the severity of hypertension and renal damage through some other mechanism.",

Dyslipidemia, often found in these patients, plays an important role in this process. This study investigates the efficacy and safety of lipid-lowering therapy with pravastatin, a 3-HMG-Coenzym A reductase inhibitor in hypercholesterolemic type-1 and type-2 diabetic patients. Of 49 patients (22 type-1 DM and 27 type-2 DM), 24 patients were treated with pravastatin, 20 mg/day, and 25 patients with placebo. After 24 weeks, total cholesterol (TC) was decreased by 22.2%, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 25.8% and triglycerides (TG) by 13.6%. Pravastatin treatment did not induce a significant change in high-density (HDL) cholesterol levels. No differences in effects of pravastatin treatment on serum lipids and lipoproteins were found with respect to the diabetes type. No serious side effects occurred and pravastatin treatment did not cause any deterioration in glycemia control. The data suggest that pravastatin is effective and safe in the treatment of dyslipidemia in both type-1 and type-2 diabetic patients.",

Specifically, interventions in primary and secondary prevention represent an important field of research. A resource utilization analysis was performed on the basis of the recently published Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study. It could be shown that treatment with simvastatin compared to placebo leads to a reduction in patient costs of CHF 8.4 million. This represents a reduction of CHF 3770.- per patient. The effective daily treatment costs can thus be calculated at CHF 1.11, which is equivalent to 36% of the actual acquisition cost per day. These results support the notion that secondary coronary prevention is not only justified from a clinical but also from an economic point of view.",

The risk ratios for nonfatal and fatal stroke with fibrates, resins, and dietary interventions were all close to 1.0, and the difference between the HMGcoA reductase inhibitor effect and the pooled estimate for all other interventions would, under the null hypothesis, be unlikely to occur by chance (P = 0.01).

At the end of the study the patients were referred back to their own physicians, with written advice on diet and drug therapy. At a recall two years later we studied to what extent recommended therapy and follow-up had been implemented. 15% had no follow-up after participating in the study and 18% had not measured their cholesterol for one year or more. The majority of the patients did not follow the recommended diet and level of physical activity satisfactorily, and 20% had stopped their lipid-lowering medication. In general they had been prescribed too low doses of the lipid-lowering agent, and 70% of the patients had not reached the target of the LDL-cholesterol. In conclusion, adequate treatment and a five-year follow-up is not sufficient to keep the patient compliant when the follow-up becomes less intensive.

We report the biochemical and molecular characterization of a mutation in the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A lyase gene in four new probands, three Spanish and one Turkish, affected by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaric aciduria, all homozygous for the nonsense mutation Glu37Ter, which was reported by our group in two probands of Portuguese and Moroccan origin (15). In addition to the aberrant mRNAs found in the two previous probands, a novel species of mature HL mRNA was observed in the patients studied here, since a new cDNA, skipped in exons 2 and 3, was obtained from the mRNAs by reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Thus, three mRNA species were produced in aberrant splicings as a result of this nonsense mutation: (i) one of the expected size that contains the premature stop codon UAA, (ii) another with a deletion of 84 bp corresponding to the whole of exon 2, and (iii) a new species found now, with a deletion of 192 bp corresponding to skipping of the whole of exons 2 and 3, whose translation product led to the loss of seven amino acids in the leader peptide and 57 amino acids in the terminal domain of the mature enzyme. The association of a nonsense mutation with the skipping of the exon that contains it, plus the following exon, is an unusual finding not seen previously in HL deficiencies. The mutation described here shows the highest incidence (> 37%) of total HL deficiencies reported.",

We compared the standard simvastatin plus bile-acid sequestrant (cholestyramine) therapy with simvastatin plus fenofibrate in 29 patients with severe familial hypercholesterolaemia. The fibrate regimen resulted in an 35.1 +/- 10.7% reduction in total cholesterol, a 40.6 +/- 20.5% in LDL cholesterol, 17.2 +/- 56.5% reduction in triglycerides and a 20.3 +/- 52.0% increase in HDL cholesterol. The cholestyramine regimen produced reductions of 29.3 +/- 13.2% in cholesterol, 37.1 +/- 21.9% in LDL cholesterol, and 12.5 +/- 48.9% in triglycerides, and a 5.0 +/- 25.4% rise in HDL cholesterol. The fibrate regimen was significantly more effective in reducing total cholesterol (p < 0.001) and LDL-cholesterol (p = 0.004), and also reduced triglycerides significantly (p = 0.05), compared to the cholestyramine regimen.

    "62": "Okadaic acid, calyculin A and cantharidin, potent and specific inhibitors of protein phosphatases 1 (PP1) and 2A (PP2A), stimulated both acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) activity and cholesterol ester formation in suspension cultures of isolated rat hepatocytes. The activation of microsomal ACAT was marked (up to 14-fold the basal values), fast in onset (within 5 min), persistent in duration (up to 45 min) and concentration-dependent. Concentrations of okadaic acid (OA) or calyculin A > or = 100 nM or of cantharidin > or = 1 microM were required to stimulate enzyme activity, which specifically points to a dominant contribution of PP1. No effects were seen with up to 1 microM nor-okadaone, an inactive OA analogue. Rises in [3H]oleate incorporation into cell cholesteryl esters closely paralleled those in ACAT activity, though were somewhat less accentuated. The increases in microsomal ACAT activity seen in OA-, calyculin A- or cantharidin-treated hepatocytes were not linked to changes in bulk microsomal unesterified cholesterol or in the de novo cholesterol synthesis. The findings firmly indicate a role for protein phosphatase activity, probably that of PP1, in controlling the cholesterol esterification rate and ACAT activity in intact rat hepatocytes, which is not secondary to an alteration of the steady-state distribution of cholesterol mass between cell membranes. However, as the OA-induced stimulation of ACAT was not abrogated by addition of purified PP1 or PP2A to microsomes, it is unlikely that the phosphatase inhibitors here used act directly on the phosphorylation degree of the ACAT enzyme.", 
    "63": "Beta-hydroxy-beta-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors reduce plasma LDL cholesterol by upregulating hepatic LDL receptors. However, their effects on lipid metabolism in extrahepatic cells may also contribute to their therapeutic benefit. We examined the effects of lovastatin (LOV) on cellular lipid levels in the human monocytic Mono Mac 6sr and cultured rat smooth muscle cells. In both cell types, LOV produced a dose-dependent increase in cellular triglycerides. This increase was observed in cells grown in the absence of exogenous lipids in the culture medium, but was more pronounced after additions of oleic acid (50 to 200 microM) and VLDL (50 to 200 microg ml-1). In Mono Mac 6sr cells grown in medium containing 10% delipidated FCS for the last 16 h, the LOV-induced rise in triglyceride levels was completely reversed by 2 mM mevalonic acid and was associated with a decrease in cellular cholesterol. However, when cells were maintained in lipoprotein-replete medium, the LOV-induced rise in triglycerides did not correlate with cellular cholesterol. LOV also reduced cellular cholesterol esterification and increased the synthesis of fatty acids and their incorporation into triglycerides and phospholipids. Increased triglyceride levels were also seen in Mono Mac 6sr cells treated with the lanosterol demethylase inhibitor RS-21607 and the acylcoenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase inhibitor SaH 58035. Our findings suggest that the LOV-induced triglyceride accumulation involves changes in intracellular cholesterol pools regulating cellular fatty acid concentrations. Although decreased cholesterol levels in cells participating in plaque formation are beneficial, the impact of the herein described shift in intracellular neutral lipid metabolism on other cellular functions warrants further investigation.", 
    "64": "Patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (HFH) have abnormalities in both low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor alleles, resulting in severe hypercholesterolaemia and premature coronary heart disease. Limited treatment options are available and the response to drug therapy has been poor. In the present paper, we have evaluated the efficacy and safety of simvastatin at doses beyond the current maximal dose of 40 mg/day in patients with HFH. After a 4 week placebo diet run-in period, 12 patients with well-characterized HFH were randomized to simvastatin 80 mg/day administered in three divided doses (n = 8; group 1) or 40 mg once daily (n = 4; group 2). After 9 weeks, the dose in group 1 was increased to 160 mg/day while the dose in group 2 was kept at 40 mg/day, but with the drug given in three divided doses and treatment continued for an additional 9 weeks. All 12 patients completed the study and there were no serious or unexpected adverse effects. LDL-cholesterol concentrations fell by 14% at the 40 mg/day dose, but were reduced further at the higher doses (25% at the 80 mg/day and by 31% at the 160 mg/day dosage, P < 0.0001). Excretion of urinary mevalonic acid, as an index of in vivo cholesterol biosynthesis, was reduced but did not correlate with reduction in LDL-cholesterol in the individual patients. The magnitude of response to therapy was not predicted by the LDL-receptor gene defect as patients with the same LDL-receptor mutations responded differently to the same dose of simvastatin therapy. The ability of expanded doses of simvastatin (80 or 160 mg/day) to reduce LDL-cholesterol levels in patients with HFH, even if receptor negative, suggests that at these doses, the drug reduces LDL production. Simvastatin therapy, at doses of 80 or 160 mg/day, should therefore be considered in all patients with HFH, either as an adjunct to apheresis, or as monotherapy for those patients who do not have access to apheresis or other such treatment modalities.", 
    "65": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl Coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) are therapeutically used to lower plasma cholesterol levels. In addition, these drugs can block vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation. The present study addressed the question whether the inhibitory effect of lovastatin on premitotic DNA synthesis correlates with a downregulation of c-fos mRNA levels, a marker of signaling efficiency, in human SMC. Here we show that in human SMC exposed to individual growth factors (platelet-derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, alpha-thrombin, insulin, insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I)) and human serum, the maximal [3H]thymidine incorporation and c-fos mRNA expression are closely correlated. Only alpha-thrombin elicited overexpression of c-fos as compared with its effect on [3H]thymidine incorporation. Lovastatin efficiently inhibited [3H]thymidine uptake promoted by all mitogens tested (76-87%); however, it significantly inhibited upregulation of c-fos mRNA levels induced only by insulin (33-67%, P < 0.05) and IGF-I (31 57%, P < 0.05). This inhibition was overcome by mevalonate and geranylgeraniol, and partially by farnesol. c-fos mRNA expression induced by 4-beta-phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate, an activator of protein kinase C, was insensitive to lovastatin treatment. Thus, in human vascular SMC, lovastatin impairs premitotic DNA synthesis induced by growth factors, but only c-fos expression promoted by insulin and IGF-I. These data indicate that statin-sensitive and -insensitive pathways seem to be involved in the regulation of c-fos in the response of human SMC to proliferative stimuli, and suggest a prominent role of isoprenylated proteins in the activation of VSMC through the IGF-I/insulin dependent pathways.", 
    "66": "Glomerular expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and subsequent glomerular macrophage infiltration may play an important role in the development of glomerulosclerosis. Previous studies have shown that lovastatin ameliorates experimental renal disease and reduces MCP-1 expression in serum-stimulated, cultured mesangial cells. We investigated the effects of lovastatin on glomerular MCP-1 expression and macrophage infiltration in rats with puromycin aminonucleoside (PA) nephrosis, an experimental model of renal disease characterized by early macrophage infiltration. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were pretreated for 5 days with either lovastatin (4 mg/kg) or vehicle. At the end of pretreatment, the lovastatin-pretreated rats received a single i.v. injection of PA (50 mg/kg) and continued to receive daily lovastatin thereafter. The vehicle-pretreated rats received i.v. injections of either PA or saline, and continued to receive daily vehicle treatment thereafter. Ten days after PA injection, the vehicle-treated PA rats showed increased (P < 0.05) serum cholesterol (359 +/- 25 mg/100 mL) and urine albumin excretion (343 +/- 95 mg/24 hr), compared with the vehicle-treated control rats (61 +/- 3 mg/100 mL and 2.5 +/- 0.6 mg/24 hr, respectively). Serum cholesterol (193 +/- 22 mg/dL) and urine albumin excretion (255 +/- 68 mg/24 hr) were less in the lovastatin-treated PA rats than in the vehicle-treated PA rats. The number of glomerular macrophages, assessed as ED-1-positive cells, per glomerular profile was increased 77% in the vehicle-treated PA rats (3.3 +/- 0.2) compared with the vehicle-treated control rats (1.8 +/- 0.2) (P < 0.05). By contrast, the number of glomerular macrophages was not elevated in the lovastatin-treated PA rats (2.3 +/- 0.2). Thus, lovastatin in vivo can attenuate glomerular macrophage infiltration. This may represent one mechanism by which lovastatin ameliorates experimental glomerular disease.",

    "71": "The goals of this work were to establish a reproducible and effective model of apoptosis in a cell line derived from advanced prostate cancer and to study the role of the caspase family of proteases in mediating apoptosis in this system. The study involved the use of the prostate cancer cell line LNCaP. Apoptosis was induced using the hydroxymethyl glutaryl CoA reductase inhibitor, lovastatin, and was evaluated by agarose gel electrophoresis of genomic DNA, morphological criteria, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling. Caspases were studied by catalytic activity, mRNA induction, and protein processing. Lovastatin (30 microM) was an effective inducer of apoptosis, causing changes that were evident after 48 h and essentially complete after 96-120 h of treatment. These effects were prevented by the simultaneous addition of mevalonate (300 microM) to the culture medium. Lovastatin induced a proteolytic activity that was able to cleave the enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and the substrate Z-DEVD-AFC, which is modeled after the P1-P4 amino acids of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage site. Caspase-7, but not caspase-3, underwent proteolytic activation during lovastatin-induced apoptosis, an effect prevented by mevalonate. Caspase-7 was the only detected interleukin 1beta converting enzyme family protease with DEVD cleavage activity that exhibited lovastatin-induced mRNA up-regulation. Again, mevalonate blocked this effect. Lovastatin-induced apoptosis also was prevented when the caspase inhibitors Z-DEVD-CH2F or Z-VAD-CH2F (100 microM) where added to the medium. These studies have identified lovastatin as a powerful inducer of apoptosis in the cell line LNCaP. Caspase activation was a necessary event for LNCaP cells to undergo apoptosis during treatment with lovastatin. Of the caspases tested, only caspase-7 underwent proteolytic activation after stimulation with lovastatin. Identification of caspase-7 as a potential mediator of lovastatin-induced apoptosis broadens our knowledge of the molecular events associated with programmed cell death in a cell line derived from prostatic epithelium.", 
    "72": "Cytosolic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) synthase catalyzes the formation of HMG-CoA, the substrate for the rate-controlling enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. To explore the regulation in liver, we developed a new, accurate, and reliable reversed-phase ion-pair chromatographic assay that uses nonradioactive substrates and n-propionyl coenzyme A as an internal recovery standard. The hepatic activities were measured in rats treated with cholesterol, sitosterol, cholic acid, deoxycholic acid, ursodeoxycholic acid, cholestyramine, bile fistula, lovastatin, and BM 15.766, an inhibitor of 7-dehydrocholesterol delta7-reductase, and were compared with microsomal HMG-CoA reductase and cytosolic acetoacetyl coenzyme A (AcAc-CoA) thiolase activities. HMG-CoA synthase activity was effectively suppressed in synchrony with HMG-CoA reductase activity by treatments with cholesterol (-41%, P < .05), cholic acid (-72%, P < .005), and deoxycholic acid (-62%, P < .05). However, ursodeoxycholic acid increased activity 84% (P < .05) and intravenous sitosterol did not change activity. AcAc-CoA thiolase activities also paralleled HMG-CoA reductase and HMG-CoA synthase activities, but differences were not statistically significant. In contrast to inhibition, up-regulation of hepatic HMG-CoA synthase activities by cholestyramine, bile fistula, and lovastatin was much less than HMG-CoA reductase activities. In addition, BM 15.766 did not stimulate synthase activity, whereas lovastatin increased activity 2.4-fold. Thus, hepatic HMG-CoA synthase activity was regulated coordinately with HMG-CoA reductase, and responded more forcefully to regulatory stimuli than acetoacetyl-CoA thiolase activity but usually less than HMG-CoA reductase.", 
    "73": "We investigated the role of the intrinsic mevalonate cascade in DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) stimulated by phytohemagglutinin (PHA). PHA stimulated the expression of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase mRNA prior to the DNA synthesis (S phase). Pravastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, inhibited DNA synthesis and blocked the entry to S phase in PHA-stimulated PBMC. Mevalonate restored these inhibitory effects. Thus, we examined two major metabolites of mevalonate, geranylgeranyl-pyrophosphate (GGPP) and farnesyl-pyrophosphate (FPP), using a novel liposome system for uptake into the cells. GGPP, not FPP, restored the pravastatin-induced inhibitions. These data indicated that 1) the intrinsic mevalonate cascade plays critical roles for the entry to S phase and DNA synthesis, and that 2) GGPP is an essential metabolite of mevalonate cascade for cell cycle progression in PBMC stimulated by PHA.", 
    "74": "Nerve fiber elongation involves the input of lipids to the growing axons. Since cell bodies are often a great distance from the regenerating tips, alternative sources of lipids have been proposed. We previously demonstrated that axonal synthesis of phosphatidylcholine is required for axonal growth (Posse de Chaves, E., Vance, D. E., Campenot, R. B. and Vance, J. E. (1995) J. Cell Biol. 128, 913-918; Posse de Chaves, E., Vance, D. E., Campenot, R. B. and Vance, J. E. (1995) Biochem. J. 312, 411-417). In contrast, cholesterol is not made in axons. We now show that when compartmented cultures of rat sympathetic neurons are incubated with pravastatin, in the absence of exogenously supplied lipids, cholesterol synthesis is inhibited and axonal growth is impaired. The addition of cholesterol to the axons or cell bodies of neurons treated with this inhibitor restores normal axonal elongation. Similarly, a supply of cholesterol via lipoproteins restores normal axonal growth. In contrast, lipoproteins do not provide axons with sufficient phosphatidylcholine for normal elongation when axonal phosphatidylcholine synthesis is inhibited. Thus, our studies support the idea that during axonal regeneration lipoproteins can be taken up by axons from the microenvironment and supply sufficient cholesterol, but not phosphatidylcholine, for growth. We also show that neither apoE nor apoA-I within the lipoproteins is essential for axonal growth.", 
    "75": "The high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration is inversely related to the risk of coronary artery disease. The cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) has a central role in the metabolism of this lipoprotein and may therefore alter the susceptibility to atherosclerosis.", 
    "76": "The DNA of 807 men with angiographically documented coronary atherosclerosis was analyzed for the presence of a polymorphism in the gene coding for CETP. The presence of this DNA variation was referred to as B1, and its absence as B2. All patients participated in a cholesterol-lowering trial designed to induce the regression of coronary atherosclerosis and were randomly assigned to treatment with either pravastatin or placebo for two years.", 
    "77": "The B1 variant of the CETP gene was associated with both higher plasma CETP concentrations (mean [+/-SD], 2.29+/-0.62 microg per milliliter for the B1B1 genotype vs. 1.76+/-0.51 microg per milliliter for the B2B2 genotype) and lower HDL cholesterol concentrations (34+/-8 vs. 39+/-10 mg per deciliter). In addition, we observed a significant dose-dependent association between this marker and the progression of coronary atherosclerosis in the placebo group (decrease in mean luminal diameter: 0.14+/-0.21 mm for the B1B1 genotype, 0.10+/-0.20 mm for the B1B2 genotype, and 0.05+/-0.22 mm for the B2B2 genotype). This association was abolished by pravastatin. Pravastatin therapy slowed the progression of coronary atherosclerosis in B1B1 carriers but not in B2B2 carriers (representing 16 percent of the patients taking pravastatin).", 
    "78": "There is a significant relation between variation at the CETP gene locus and the progression of coronary atherosclerosis that is independent of plasma HDL cholesterol levels and the activities of lipolytic plasma enzymes. This common DNA variant appears to predict whether men with coronary artery disease will benefit from treatment with pravastatin to delay the progression of coronary atherosclerosis.", 
    "79": "The preponderance of evidence confirms the importance of aggressive lipid modification in patients at risk for coronary heart disease (CHD). However, data suggest that this information is underimplemented in the clinical setting, even in patients with existing CHD, in whom the greatest benefit of such treatment has been shown. The fact that many practitioners do not pursue a proven treatment strategy in patients who qualify must be redressed through education and reinforcement of existing recommendations. In the present review, the current clinical and mechanistic understanding of the benefit of aggressive lipid management is summarized, with a focus on the clinical implications of recent findings. These include growing public awareness of cholesterol as a modifiable CHD risk factor, recommendations for earlier and more aggressive intervention in patients with existing disease, and discussion of the cost-effectiveness of lipid-regulating therapy. Despite the secular trend of declining CHD morbidity and mortality rates in recent years, CHD remains the leading cause of death in both men and women in the United States. It is imperative to prevent any reduction in public focus on primary and secondary prevention.", 
    "80": "The Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S) demonstrated pronounced reductions in mortality and major coronary events in a cohort of patients with established coronary heart disease (CHD). The present study provides a detailed, post hoc assessment of the efficacy and safety of simvastatin therapy in the following subgroups of 4S patients: those > or = 65 years of age, those < 65 years of age, women, and men.", 
    "81": "The 4S cohort of 4444 CHD patients included 827 women and 1021 patients > or = 65 years of age. Total cholesterol at baseline was 5.5 to 8.0 mmol/L with triglycerides < or = 2.5 mmol/L. Patients were randomized to therapy with simvastatin 20 to 40 mg daily or placebo for a median follow-up period of 5.4 years. End points consisted of all-cause and CHD mortality, major coronary events (primarily CHD death and nonfatal myocardial infarction), other acute CHD and atherosclerotic events, hospitalizations for CHD and cardiovascular events, and coronary revascularization procedures. Mean changes in serum lipids were similar in the different subgroups. In patients > or = 65 years of age in the simvastatin group, relative risks (95% confidence intervals) for clinical events were as follows: all-cause mortality, 0.66 (0.48 to 0.90); CHD mortality, 0.57 (0.39 to 0.83); major coronary events, 0.66 (0.52 to 0.84); any atherosclerosis-related event, 0.67 (0.56 to 0.81); and revascularization procedures, 0.59 (0.41 to 0.84). In women, the corresponding figures were 1.16 (0.68 to 1.99); 0.86 (0.42 to 1.74), 0.66 (0.48 to 0.91), 0.71 (0.56 to 0.91), and 0.51 (0.30 to 0.86), respectively.", 
    "82": "Cholesterol lowering with simvastatin produced similar reductions in relative risk for major coronary events in women compared with men and in elderly (> or = 65 years of age) compared with younger patients. There were too few female deaths to assess the effects on mortality in women. Because mortality rates increased substantially with age, the absolute risk reduction for both all-cause and CHD mortality in simvastatin-treated subjects was approximately twice as great in the older patients.", 
    "83": "Medical therapy to treat and prevent this major complication has progressed slowly. The early use of diltiazem, pravastatin, or photopheresis has had reported efficacy in slowing the development of TCAD but not in preventing its development. Current ongoing multicenter studies with mycophenolate mofetil, angiopeptin, and other agents may hold promise for the future. It is clear that whatever intervention is applied, it must be started at the time of transplantation, as the cascade of events of TCAD begins at the time of surgery. Revascularization procedures, including angioplasty and CABS, have proven to be palliative and not applicable to all patients with TCAD. Currently, retransplantation remains the only viable treatment for patients with severe transplant vasculopathy. For patients undergoing retransplantation for severe TCAD, survival and the development of TCAD in the second donor heart appear acceptable compared to outcomes for patients undergoing primary heart transplantation. The ethical dilemma surrounding heart retransplantation, however, is considerable because of the scarcity of donor organs.", 
    "84": "Recent data have extended the benefit of lipid lowering therapy to patients with only mildly to moderately elevated LDL-cholesterol, which is typical of patients with coronary artery disease. Meta-analysis of clinical trials of statin therapy with similar sample sizes indicated that the LDL-cholesterol level on treatment was as good a predictor of angiographic benefit as was the percentage reduction in LDL-cholesterol. We review evidence that management of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, HDL, fibrinogen, lipoprotein particle size, LDL-oxidation, and lipoprotein (a) may also favorably influence atherosclerotic progression. Angiographic and arterial ultrasound trials of lipid lowering therapy have demonstrated benefits on disease progression that are consistent with benefits on myocardial infarction, stroke, and death reported in larger, lengthier trials.", 
    "85": "Early trials with lipid-lowering therapy in patients with established coronary artery disease revealed favorable trends in cardiovascular events but did not yield significant reductions in total mortality. Recent clinical trials using hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor (\"statin\") therapy have shown significant decreases in total mortality, cardiovascular events, hospitalizations, and the need for revascularization procedures, with its usage (1) to lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol after myocardial infarction (secondary prevention); and (2) in high-risk patients without evidence for coronary artery disease (primary prevention). Secondary prevention benefits have been seen for both men and women, in the young and elderly, and among diabetic and nondiabetic patients. The beneficial effects of LDL-cholesterol reduction occur early and are additive to other risk-reduction therapies. Lipid-lowering therapy should be part of the comprehensive treatment of all patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease and patients at high risk.", 
    "86": "Pravastatin dissolves gallstones in patients with hypercholesterolemia by reducing the cholesterol saturation index (CSI) of bile. There are few reports on effect of pravastatin on bile lipids, CSI and nucleation time (NT) in patients with gallstones and normal plasma lipid levels, or on the effect of pravastatin on gallbladder motility. Therefore we studied the effect of pravastatin on bile lipids, CSI, NT, and gallbladder motility in persons with normal cholesterol levels. We included 10 patients (ages 32 +/- 8 years; 6 men) with symptomatic gallstones and normal plasma lipid profiles. Estimation of bile lipids, CSI, and NT in duodenal bile and gallbladder motility were done using standard methods. Subsequently each patient was given 40 mg pravastatin daily for 1 month. At completion of pravastatin therapy, bile lipids and gallbladder motility studies were repeated. After pravastatin therapy, we found no significant reduction in bile cholesterol (11.2 +/- 3.2 vs. 10.4 +/- 2.8 mmol/l), bile acids (114.6 +/- 7.4 vs. 133 +/- 16 mmol/l), phospholipids (23 +/- 3.5 vs. 24 +/- 6.2 mmol/l), CSI (1.28 +/- 0.4 vs. 1.22 +/- 0.3), and nucleation time (7 +/- 3 vs. 7 +/- 3 days). In addition, there was no significant change in gallbladder fasting volume (26 +/- 3 vs. 26.6 +/- 3 ml), residual volume (14.6 +/- 1.1 vs. 15.08 +/- 1.4 ml), ejection fraction (44% vs. 43%), and rate constant of gallbladder emptying (0.018/min vs. 0.022/min). One-month therapy with pravastatin does not alter bile lipids, CSI, NT, and gallbladder contractility in persons with normal levels of cholesterol.", 
    "87": "To more efficiently reduce the risk of coronary heart disease with lipid lowering therapy, cost effectiveness analysis offers an important tool to best determine how to allocate inherently limited resources to improve the health of both individuals and society. Formal economic analysis of the most recent clinical trials with the 3-hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) suggest that secondary prevention of coronary heart disease is very cost effective compared to existing treatment and prevention strategies. Primary prevention is also cost effective but has a much wider range of cost effectiveness depending on an individual baseline risk. Cost effectiveness can be better maximized in primary prevention by treating patients at the highest absolute risk of coronary heart disease. The debate about lipid lowering therapy will now shift from that of efficacy and safety, to that of cost and cost effectiveness. Defining the optimal treatment thresholds for intervention in primary prevention will become a major focus of investigation.", 
    "88": "Old lipid acting drugs (fibrates, resins and niacin) continue to demonstrate morbidity and mortality benefits with variable efficacy and safety. Controlled trials have provided efficacy and safety data that support the use of statins as the first choice in the treatment and prevention of atherosclerosis. Knowledge of old and new mechanisms of action, optimal doses, pharmacokinetic behavior and drug interactions improve the safety and effectiveness of these hypolipidemic agents.", 
    "89": "The basis for treatment of lipid disorders in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus is weight reduction by diet and exercise, and additional control of glycaemic condition with oral antidiabetics, alone or in combination with insulin. Hypercholesterolaemic, mildly hypertriglyceridaemic non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients respond to cholesterol malabsorption caused by dietary sitostanol ester margarine, while long-term statin treatment of respective coronary patients significantly lowers the recurrence of coronary events, in addition to improving the lipid disorder. However, no information is available concerning the preventive effect of long-term improvement of lipid disorders in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus patients without coronary heart disease, or in patients with the 'classical' type of diabetic lipid disorder, that is, hypertriglyceridaemia with low HDL and normal-low LDL-cholesterol levels. In this group of patients, beneficial lipid effects can be obtained (although perhaps not normalization) with fibrates alone or, especially, in combination with current statins.", 
    "90": "The etiology of arteriosclerosis is a complicated interaction of many factors, among which aberrations in the cholesterol metabolism appear to play an important role. Several studies have shown that lipid-lowering therapy with statins improves survival and reduces complications in patients with coronary artery disease. Until recently, the role of cholesterol-lowering in patients with elevated cholesterol, but without diagnosed coronary disease, was not clear. New studies suggest that men in this group may benefit from treatment with statins. This article focuses on some of the problems connected with the widespread use of statins, namely: proper selection of patients, the safety of long-term statin therapy, economics, and the need for additional therapy and for the continuation of population-based general measures.", 
    "91": "We report on adverse drug reactions to statins recorded internationally and in Norway. The use of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) has increased with a factor of 30 in Norway over the period 1989-96. Recently published clinical trials conclude that statins are safe; adverse drug reactions being infrequent and non-serious. The reactions observed are mostly increased hepatic enzymes and myopathy. Data from the Norwegian spontaneous reporting system, and from WHO's international database covering the period of 1988-95, includes reports of adverse drug reactions relating to other organ systems, such as the nervous system, the gastrointestinal tract, skin and cardiovascular organs. Psychiatric disorders represent 15% of the reactions to statins in the Norwegian database. Reactions include aggression, nervousness, depression, anxiety, sleeping disorders and impotence. The pharmacological mechanisms are not elucidated, but may be an effect of falling serum cholesterol.", 
    "92": "Post myocardial infarction preventive strategies are effective in reducing morbidity and mortality. Life threatening risk factors can be controlled by medication in addition to dietary measures. The following update will be proposed on: new lipidic and non lipidic risk factors; necessity to control risk factors, nicotine dependence and lipid metabolism disorders in particular; patient follow-up; drug treatment efficacy (beta-blockers, aspirin, ACEI, statins); compliance to a varied drug treatment regimen. Three newly developed treatments will be presented: the first sartan, clopidogrel and troglitazone.", 
    "93": "Consumption of boiled coffee raises serum cholesterol levels in humans. The diterpenes cafestol and kahweol in boiled coffee have been found to be responsible for the increase. To investigate the biochemical background of this effect, we studied the effects of cafestol and a mixture of cafestol/kahweol/isokahweol (48:47:5 w/w) on bile acid synthesis and cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase and sterol 27-hydroxylase in cultured rat hepatocytes. Dose-dependent decreases of bile acid mass production and cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase and sterol 27-hydroxylase activity were found, showing a maximal reduction of -91%, -79%, and -49% respectively, at a concentration of 20 micrograms/mL cafestol. The decrease in 7 alpha-hydroxylase and 27-hydroxylase activity paralleled well the suppression of the respective mRNAs, being -79% and -77%, and -49% and -46%, respectively, at 20 micrograms/mL cafestol. Run-on data showed a reduction in 7 alpha-hydroxylase and 27-hydroxylase gene transcriptional activity after incubation with cafestol. The mixture of cafestol/kahweol/isokahweol was less potent in suppression of bile acid synthesis and cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase. Cafestol (20 micrograms/mL) had no effect on lithocholic acid 6 beta-hydroxylase mRNA, another enzyme involved in bile acid synthesis. LDL-receptor, HMG-CoA reductase, and HMG-CoA synthase mRNAs were significantly decreased by cafestol (-18%, -20%, and -43%, respectively). We conclude that cafestol suppresses bile acid synthesis by downregulation of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase and of, to a lesser extent, sterol 27-hydroxylase in cultured rat hepatocytes, whereas kahweol and isokahweol are less active. We suggest that suppression of bile acid synthesis may provide an explanation for the cholesterol-raising effect of cafestol in humans.", 
    "94": "Cholesteryl esters (CE) in lipid droplets undergo a continual cycle of hydrolysis and reesterification by neutral cholesterol esterase (N-CEase) and acyl CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT), respectively. The mechanism by which HDL mobilizes CE from lipid droplets in J774 A.1 cells was investigated, focusing on N-CEase activity. We asked whether HDL enhances the activity and, if so, what signals induce the change of the activity. An incubation of cells with HDL enhanced the decline of cholesteryl-[l-14C]-oleate in foam cells and increased N-CEase activity in the supernatant of cell homogenate in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas incubation with LDL decreased the activity. In addition, N-CEase activity was fivefold higher when cells were cultured in 10% lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS) medium (2 micrograms cholesterol/mL) than when cultured in 10% fetal calf serum medium (31 micrograms cholesterol/mL), suggesting that changes in N-CEase activity are mediated by cholesterol. An addition of cholesterol (0 to 30 micrograms/mL) in LPDS medium markedly inhibited N-CEase activity with a concomitant increase in cellular cholesterol concentration. This inhibitory effect of cholesterol was also observed in mouse peritoneal macrophages. In vitro addition of cholesterol did not affect N-CEase activity. Treatment of cells with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors enhanced N-CEase activity, whereas ACAT inhibitor decreased the activity. Northern blot analysis of N-CEase mRNA showed that the expression was not altered by the presence of cholesterol in LPDS medium. These results suggest that cholesterol downregulates N-CEase activity, probably through cholesterol-dependent appearance of some factors.", 
    "95": "Gemfibrozil reduces the plasmal levels of cholesterol and triglyceride in patients with hyperlipidemia by a mechanism that is not well understood. The present study evaluated the effect of gemfibrozil on the LDL receptor in human hepatoma cells compared with that of pravastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase. Exposure to gemfibrozil, 40 mumol/L, for 3 days increased the binding of 125I-LDL to the surface of three lines of human hepatoma cell, HepG2, HuH7, and HLE by 1.5- to 2.0-fold. Similar findings were observed with pravastatin. Scatchard analysis with 125I-LDL indicated an increased number of LDL receptors on the cell surface of HepG2 cells when treated with gemfibrozil and pravastatin. However, the gemfibrozil-treated cells exhibited no increase in the binding of 125I-epidermal growth factor (EGF). Gemfibrozil increased the levels of LDL receptor mRNA and protein in HepG2 cells. The increase in LDL receptor activity induced by pravastatin was abolished by concomitant administration of mevalonic acid, 770 mumol/L. This effect was not seen with gemfibrozil, suggesting the mechanism differs for the two lipid-lowering drugs. To determine whether this increase in mRNA was due to transcriptional activation, we prepared HepG2 cells transfected with an LDL receptor promoter-reporter construct that contained a sterol regulatory element. The expression of LDL receptor regulated by the sterol regulatory element was increased by pravastatin, but not by gemfibrozil. We evaluated the stability of the mRNA in the presence of actinomycin D to explain the increase in the LDL receptor mRNA. Gemfibrozil prolonged the half-life of the mRNA for LDL receptor but not that for the EGF receptor. Stabilization of the LDL receptor mRNA is suggested to be the novel mode of action of gemfibrozil.", 
    "96": "In the present studies, the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor atorvastatin was used to test the hypothesis that inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis in vivo with a consequent reduction in the availability of hepatic cholesterol for lipoprotein synthesis, would (1) reduce very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) apolipoprotein B (apoB) secretion into the plasma, (2) reduce the conversion of VLDL apoB to LDL apoB, and (3) reduce LDL apoB direct synthesis. ApoB kinetic studies were carried out in six control miniature pigs and in six animals after 21 days of administration of atorvastatin (3 mg/kg per day). Pigs were fed a fat- (34% of calories; polyunsaturated to monounsaturated to saturated ratio, 1:1:1) and cholesterol- (400 mg/d cholesterol; 0.1%; 0.2 mg/kcal) containing pig chow-based diet. Atorvastatin treatment significantly reduced plasma total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, total triglyceride, and VLDL triglyceride concentrations by 16%, 31%, 19%, and 28%, respectively (P < .01). Autologous 131I-VLDL, 125I-LDL, and [3H]leucine were injected simultaneously into each pig, and apoB kinetic data were analyzed using multicompartmental analysis (SAAM II). The VLDL apoB pool size decreased by 29% (0.46 versus 0.65 mg/kg; P = .002), which was entirely due to a 34% reduction in the VLDL apoB production rate (PR) (1.43 versus 2.19 mg/kg per hour; P = .027). The fractional catabolic rate (FCR) was unchanged. The LDL apoB pool size decreased by 30% (4.74 versus 6.75 mg/kg; P = .0004), which was due to a 22% reduction in the LDL apoB PR (0.236 versus 0.301 mg/kg per hour; P = .004), since the FCR was unchanged. The reduction in LDL apoB PR was primarily due to a 34% decrease in conversion of VLDL apoB to LDL apoB; however, this reduction was not statistically significant (P = .114). Hepatic apoB mRNA abundance quantitated by RNase protection assay was decreased by 13% in the atorvastatin-treated animals (P = .003). Hepatic and intestinal LDL receptor mRNA abundances were not affected. We conclude that inhibition of hepatic HMG-CoA reductase by atorvastatin reduces both VLDL and LDL apoB concentrations, primarily by decreasing apoB secretion into the plasma and not by an increase in hepatic LDL receptor expression. This decrease in apoB secretion may, in part, be due to a reduction in apoB mRNA abundance.", 
    "97": "A combined treatment of statins and extracorporeal H.E.L.P.-apheresis (Heparin-mediated Extracorporeal LDL/fibrinogen Precipitation) has already been shown to be beneficial for coronary artery disease (CAD). Presumably high levels of LDL cholesterol, Lp(a), and fibrinogen also increase the risk for graft vessel disease (GVD). Therefore, we studied whether this concept can be applied in GVD, based on the hypothesis that GVD is an accelerated form of CAD.", 
    "98": "For comparison of statin treatment alone with the combined treatment, two matched groups of 10 cardiac transplant recipients were studied during a mean period of 3.6+/-1.0 years. Both groups were comparable in clinical characteristics, immunosuppressive medication, baseline plasma Lp(a), and high fibrinogen levels. Group I had normal LDL-C levels (3.36+/-0.60 mmol/L). Simvastatin alone was administered in this group to counteract the LDL-increasing effect of the immunosuppressive medication. Group II had marked hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C, 6.07+/-1.89 mmol/L), which was treated, in addition to simvastatin, with H.E.L.P.-apheresis weekly. GVD was assessed by coronary angiography. Simvastatin alone kept LDL-C levels within baseline limits but could not prevent GVD in 7 of 10 patients. In contrast, the combined treatment prevented GVD in 9 of 10 patients (P=.006) by simultaneous and drastic reduction of 48% LDL-C (P=.006), 35% fibrinogen (P=.002), and 47% Lp(a) (P=.006) below baseline. Both treatments were well tolerated and did not affect prevention of graft rejection and infections.",

    "100": "Patients with reduced renal mass are at increased risk of developing renal failure. A remnant kidney model has been used to study the hemodynamic and structural changes that occur. We recently reported that the lipid-lowering agent lovastatin preserves renal function in this model. The purpose of the present study was to determine the specific effects of lovastation on the renal microcirculation of rats with reduced renal mass.", 
    "101": "We used the rat hydronephrotic kidney preparation with a 5/6 partial nephrectomy. This model allows direct visualization of preglomerular and postglomerular vessels using videomicroscopy. The diameters and vascular responses to acetylcholine and angiotensin II of the interlobular, afferent, and efferent vessels were determined in two groups of animals with renal mass reduction: 15 rats with no lovastatin treatment and 18 rats treated with oral lovastatin (15 mg/kg body weight/day) for 2 weeks.", 
    "102": "In the lovastatin-treated rats, the baseline efferent vessel diameter was smaller by 21% (P < 0.05), but the interlobular and afferent vessel baseline diameters were not different from those in the untreated rats. Serum creatinine levels were lower in the treated rats (1.5 +/- 0.1 versus 2.0 +/- 0.2 mg/dL, P < 0.05), but serum lipids were not different. In the lovastatin-treated rats, vascular reactivity to acetylcholine was enhanced in the afferent and decreased in the efferent vessels.", 
    "103": "In this renal ablation model, lovastatin preserved renal function as measured by serum creatinine without lowering plasma lipid levels. Lovastatin treatment resulted in smaller efferent vessel diameters. Lovastatin also increased the vasodilatory response to acetylcholine in the afferent vessels. Together, these preglomerular and postglomerular changes would increase the single-nephron glomerular filtration rate. The renal protective effect of lovastatin may be due to these vasoactive effects on the renal microcirculation.", 
    "104": "Osteonecrosis of the femoral head was induced experimentally in chickens after the administration of a high dose of corticosteroids. Lovastatin was used to prevent the effects of the steroid on adipogenesis in cultured cells, and adipogenesis and osteonecrosis in chickens. The in vitro study, with marrow cells in culture, showed that Lovastatin inhibited steroid induced fat specific gene expression and counteracted the inhibitory effects of steroids on osteoblastic gene expression. For the in vivo study, 83 adult chickens were used: 48 received methylprednisolone 3 mg/kg weekly via intramuscular injection (Group A). Fifteen received the steroid (as in Group A) plus Lovastatin 20 mg per animal per day orally (Group B). Ten chickens received Lovastatin only (Group C). Another 10 received no medication and served as the control group (Group D). Evidence of osteonecrosis was observed in specimens from Group A, including subchondral bone death and resorption, fat cell proliferation, and new bone formation. Conversely, sections from Group B showed less adipogenesis and no bone death. It is concluded that the bipedal chicken is a useful animal model for studies of osteonecrosis and that lipid clearing agents, such as Lovastatin, may be helpful in preventing the development of steroid induced osteonecrosis.", 
    "105": "1. The main objective of the present study was to verify the speed with which two 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, simvastatin and pravastatin, could revert endothelial cell dysfunction in hypercholesterolaemic rabbits. An attempt was also made to correlate the plasma cholesterol level and the tissue cholesterol and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents of the aortae with the endothelium-dependent relaxation on the assumption that any endothelial dysfunction could be rapidly and partially reversed, even in the presence of relatively high serum cholesterol levels. 2. Ninety-one male New Zealand white rabbits were randomly assigned to hypercholesterolaemic (control), simvastatin or pravastatin groups. All rabbits were fed a diet supplemented with cholesterol (0.5%) and coconut oil (2%) for 8 weeks. Simvastatin (10 and 20 mg/day) and pravastatin (15 and 30 mg/day) were administered 6, 4 and 2 days before the end of the experiment. At the end of the 8th week, animals were killed and the aortae were removed for histological examination as well as for the measurement of cholesterol and MDA contents and for endothelium-dependent relaxation studies. 3. The results showed that significant improvement in endothelium-dependent relaxation was obtained only with pravastatin and only with 4 or 6 days of administration. In these cases, the cholesterol and MDA contents of the vessel wall were reduced, although no significant changes were observed in plasma total cholesterol. Higher doses of the drugs did not alter these results. 4. We conclude that pravastatin enhances endothelium-dependent relaxation when administered to cholesterol-fed rabbits, probably via an anti-oxidant action. This effect, which was observed to start on the 4th day of drug administration, may represent a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of acute coronary syndromes in hypercholesterolaemic patients.",

The aim of the study was to investigate changes in serum cholesterol levels and the use of cholesterol lowering drugs one year after the end of the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S), a randomized secondary prevention study of coronary heart disease with simvastatin and placebo.", 
    "111": "A questionnaire asking the current use of cholesterol lowering drugs, most recent serum cholesterol value and attitudes towards cholesterol lowering was sent to 785 surviving 4S participants in four 4S centres in Finland. The response rate was 94%. The current use of cholesterol lowering drugs and the reported mean serum cholesterol values were similar to the original simvastatin and placebo groups. In all, 74% (n = 546) reported that they had used cholesterol lowering drugs after the study, and 63% (n = 467) were currently using them, mostly simvastatin (96%) with an average dose of 14 (SD 5) mg.day-1. Cholesterol lowering was considered to be 'very important' by 53% and 'important' by 37% of the respondents. The most frequent reasons for discontinuation were 'drug costs' (38%) and 'normal cholesterol values' (30%). The reported mean serum cholesterol levels were 5.1 (SD 1.0) and 5.7 (SD 1.1) mmol-1 in the current cholesterol lowering drug users and non-users, respectively (P < 0.0001). The in-trial treatment goal of serum cholesterol (< or = 5.2 mmol-1) was not met in 38% of the users and in 68% of the non-users of cholesterol lowering drugs.", 
    "112": "One year post-trial the original simvastatin and placebo groups of the 4S had become similar with regard to the use of cholesterol lowering drugs and serum cholesterol levels. The adherence to medication, however, still remained relatively high, but there was a shift toward lower doses, and consequently toward higher post-trial serum cholesterol levels.", 
    "113": "To assess the additional benefit gained from high compliance in the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study and to examine cases where withdrawal from trial medication was due to an adverse event.", 
    "114": "The incidence of definite coronary heart disease or non-fatal myocardial infarction, cardiovascular mortality, definite or suspect coronary heart disease death or non-fatal myocardial infarction, the need for coronary revascularization procedures, all-cause mortality and incident cancers were measured in the entire cohort and compared with the high compliance group. The adverse events associated with withdrawal were coded by body system.", 
    "115": "In subjects with compliance > or = 75%, treatment with pravastatin resulted in a 38% risk reduction for definite coronary heart disease death or non-fatal myocardial infarction and for cardiovascular mortality, a 46% reduction in risk or coronary revascularization and a 32% risk reduction (P = 0.015) for all-cause mortality.", 
    "116": "The analysis of the effect of pravastatin in the subgroup of high compliers to randomized medication demonstrated a substantial increase in the estimated risk reductions in comparison with that achieved in the intention-to-treat analysis. This result has significant implications for the motivation of high compliance among patients and for the assessment of the cost-effectiveness of treatment.", 
    "117": "When incubated with isolated rat hepatocytes, pravastatin sodium (PS) yielded a small amount of a metabolite in addition to two major metabolites that have already been reported. The previously uncharacterized metabolite was found to be formed by at first being enzymatically dehydrogenated to 6'-keto intermediate (R-104), followed by decomposition to give the aromatized metabolite (R-195), through spontaneous deesterification with accompanying aromatization. The PS-6'beta-hydroxydehydrogenase activity was localized in cytosolic fraction and required NADP, preferentially over NAD, as a cofactor. The formation of R-195 by rat liver cytosol was strongly inhibited by indomethacin, 3 alpha-hydroxysteroids (but not 3 beta-isomers) and 3-ketosteroids. The results and high substrate specificity of purified PS-6'beta-hydroxydehydrogenase toward 3 alpha-hydroxysteroids suggested that the enzyme is identical to 3 alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.", 
    "118": "Pravastatin, a hydrophilic inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, has been reported to beneficially affect atherogenesis, plaque stability, and transient myocardial ischemia in significant coronary artery disease by influencing lipid metabolism and by intracellular signaling via mevalonate pathway products other than cholesterol. Leukocytes are implicated to play a pathophysiological role in these events. We were interested in finding out whether pravastatin could affect transendothelial migration (TEM), chemotaxis, and respiratory burst activity of the neutrophil ex vivo. In addition, effects on monocyte and T-lymphocyte chemotaxis were tested. For TEM assays, monolayers of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were grown to confluence on polycarbonate filters bearing 5-microns pores in Transwell (Costar) culture plate inserts. Chemotaxis experiments were performed using modified Boyden chambers with cellulose nitrate micropore filters. Respiratory burst activity was measured fluorometrically. Treatment of neutrophils and monocytes with pravastatin at 2 to 200 mumol/L and 10 to 1000 mumol/L, respectively, significantly decreased chemotaxis triggered by fMet-Leu-Phe. This effect was abolished in the presence of mevalonic acid (500 mumol/L); no effect of pravastatin was seen on T-lymphocyte chemotaxis triggered by interleukin-8. Preincubation of neutrophils with pravastatin (200 mumol/L) also resulted in a significant reduction in the number of neutrophils that transmigrated a tumor necrosis factor-stimulated or lipopolysaccharide-stimulated HUVEC monolayer. At none of the concentrations tested (2 pmol/L to 200 mumol/L) did pravastatin affect neutrophil respiratory burst activity. We conclude that pravastatin may alter monocyte chemotaxis and neutrophil-endothelial interactions in migratory responses at concentrations obtained in vivo with cholesterol-lowering doses.", 
    "119": "Atorvastatin calcium is an HMG-coenzyme A (CoA) reductase inhibitor that was approved by the Food and Drug Administration on December 17, 1996. Like other such agents, it inhibits the action of HMG-CoA reductase and thereby decreases endogenous cholesterol synthesis, leading to a decrease in circulating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. In addition to its effect on lipoprotein profile, atorvastatin reduces triglycerides to a greater extent than other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. These actions occur in a dose-dependent fashion. The adverse effect profile is similar to that of other agents in this class. Indications for atorvastatin include primary hypercholesterolemia as well as other lipid disorders.", 
    "120": "Lovastatin, an inhibitor of protein prenylation, was reported to inhibit DNA synthesis and induce apoptosis in cultured cells. This report describes the morphological consequences of lovastatin treatment. Lovastatin (50 microM) induced mesangial cell rounding and disassembly of actin stress fibers within 24 to 48 h. After 48 to 72 h of lovastatin treatment, the cells detached from the substratum and underwent apoptotic cell death as evidenced by condensed nuclear chromatin, nuclear fragmentation, cell blebbing and decrease in cell size. Time lapse cinematography revealed that lovastatin caused cell rounding by either inhibiting cytokinesis or cell spreading following cytokinesis. Lovastatin-induced cell rounding, detachment, and apoptosis were dependent upon cell proliferation. These effects were prevented by serum deprivation to inhibit cell proliferation or by plating cells at densities which resulted in contact inhibition of cell growth. Lovastatin-induced mesangial cell rounding and apoptosis were also prevented by the inclusion of the isoprenoids all-trans-farnesol or all-trans-geranylgeraniol in the incubation medium. These results indicate that the effects of lovastatin were mediated by inhibition of protein isoprenylation because exogenous all-trans-geranylgeraniol can be used only in protein prenylation. The small GTP-binding protein RhoA, which may be important for cell spreading and cytokinesis, accumulated in the cytosol following treatment with lovastatin, suggestive of its inactivation. This effect was also prevented by the inclusion of either farnesol or geranylgeraniol in the incubation medium. Thus, lovastatin-induced apoptosis in mesangial cells occurs by interfering with prenylation dependent mitotic and post-mitotic events."
