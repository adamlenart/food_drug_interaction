    "0": "The treatment of patients with high cardiovascular risk and mixed hyperlipidemia is difficult due to multiple quantitative and qualitative lipid abnormalities. The priority is to reduce LDL-c levels, for which statins are the drug of choice. Despite the benefits of statins, the residual cardiovascular risk is very high in patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia. To reduce this risk, we also need to control non-HDL cholesterol levels, decreasing triglyceride levels and increasing HDL-c levels. To achieve these objectives and lifestyle changes, the use of combined therapy is often required. Fibrates are drugs that can be used in combination with statins to reduce this residual risk. Fenofibrate is well tolerated in combination with statins. The fixed combination of pravastatin/ fenofibrate has been shown to have complementary benefits in the atherogenic lipid profile in general. The combination is well tolerated and is indicated in patients with high risk and mixed hyperlipidemia who have controlled or are close to their objectives for LDL-c levels, using 40-mg pravastatin in monotherapy. The beneficial eff ect of the combination on LDL-c levels is minimal and is primarily observed in non-HDL cholesterol, triglycerides and HDL-c. The combination of pravastatin 40 and fenofibrate 160 can provide a considerable clinical benefit to patients with high risk and mixed atherogenic dyslipidemia, to patients with LDL-c levels that are controlled or near the objectives for decreasing their residual risk of lipid origin and is especially useful for patients with type 2 diabetes, obesity and combined metabolic syndrome and familial hyperlipidemia.", 
    "1": "With mixed dyslipidemia of the atherogenic dyslipidemia type, once the LDL-c objectives have been achieved through statin treatment, there is often a residual risk, for which the addition of a fibrate is recommended. The combination of statins and fibrates has been limited by the possibility of drug interactions, which mostly result in myopathy. Interactions between statins and other drugs are caused by pharmacokinetic mechanisms, mainly by changing the metabolism of statins in the CYP450 enzyme system, in the hepatic glucuronidation pathway or in the transporters responsible for statin distribution in tissues. The most significant adverse eff ect of statins is myopathy, which can also be induced by fibrates and is more frequent when the 2 drugs (statins and fibrates) are combined. This adverse eff ect manifests clinically as myalgia, muscle weakness, increased CK levels and, in its most severe form, rhabdomyolysis. This interaction mainly aff ects gemfibrozil due to its specific action on the CYP450 enzyme system and that interferes with the hepatic glucuronidation of statins by using the same isoenzymes and with organic anion transporters in the liver. When combining statins, we should use other fibric acid derivatives, preferably fenofibrate.", 
    "2": "Atherogenic dyslipidemia (AD) consists of the combination of an increase in very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), which results in increased plasma triglyceride (TG) levels, with a reduction of levels of high-density lipoprotein bound cholesterol (HDL-C), also accompanied by a high proportion of small and dense LDL particles. AD is considered the main cause of the residual risk of experiencing cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is still presented by any patient on treatment with statins despite maintaining low-density lipoprotein bound cholesterol (LDL-C) levels below the values considered to be the objective. Non-HDL cholesterol (non-HDL-c) reflects the number of atherogenic particles present in the plasma. This includes VLDL, intermediate density lipoproteins (IDL) and LDL. Non-HDL-c provides a better estimate of cardiovascular risk than LDL-c, especially in the presence of hypertriglyceridemia or AD. The European guidelines for managing dyslipidemia recommend that non-HDL-c values be less than 100 and 130 mg/dL for individuals with very high and high cardiovascular risk, respectively. However, these guidelines state that there is insufficient evidence to suggest that raising HDL-c levels incontrovertibly results in a reduction in CVD. Therefore, the guidelines do not set recommended HDL-c levels as a therapeutic objective. The guidelines, however, state that individuals with AD on treatment with statins could benefit from an additional reduction in their risk by using fibrates.", 
    "3": "Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common genetic disorder, clinically manifested since birth, and associated with very high levels of plasma LDL-cholesterol (LDL-c), xanthomas, and premature coronary heart disease. Its early detection and treatment reduces coronary morbidity and mortality. Despite effective treatment being available, FH is under-diagnosed and under-treated. Identification of index cases and cascade screening using LDL-c levels and genetic testing are the most cost-effective strategies for detecting new cases and starting early treatment. Long-term treatment with statins has decreased the vascular risk to the levels of the general population. LDL-c targets are <130mg/dL for children and young adults, <100mg/dL for adults, and <70mg/dL for adults with known coronary heart disease or diabetes. Most patients do not to reach these goals, and combined treatments with ezetimibe or other drugs may be necessary. When the goals are not achieved with the maximum tolerated drug treatment, a reduction \u226550% in LDL-c levels can be acceptable. Lipoprotein apheresis can be useful in homozygous, and in treatment-resistant severe heterozygous, cases. This Consensus Paper gives recommendations on the diagnosis, screening, and treatment of FH in children and adults, and specific advice to specialists and general practitioners with the objective of improving the clinical management of these patients, in order to reduce the high burden of coronary heart disease.",

In contrast, a longer treatment with MG132 (0.3 \u03bcmol/L, 24 h) did not change LDLR mRNA, but markedly increased LDLR protein by reducing PCSK9-mediated lysosome LDLR degradation.

Although awareness of the importance of the risk of dyslipidemia has increased, treatment of dyslipidemia has not improved accordingly.

This problem is highlighted in this issue of Atherosclerosis by the article of S. Zhao et al. who in a cross-sectional study involving 25,697 Chinese individuals found that overall 38.5% of those receiving lipid-lowering treatment did not achieve the treatment goal for low density lipoprotein. Of particular concern is the authors' finding that the majority of these were individuals with a high cardiovascular risk and/or with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

    "48": "Statins form the pharmacologic cornerstone of the primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. In addition to beneficial cardiovascular effects, statins seem to have multiple non-cardiovascular effects. Although early concerns about statin induced hepatotoxicity and cancer have subsided owing to reassuring evidence, two of the most common concerns that clinicians have are myopathy and diabetes. Randomized controlled trials suggest that statins are associated with a modest increase in the risk of myositis but not the risk of myalgia. Severe myopathy (rhabdomyolysis) is rare and often linked to a statin regimen that is no longer recommended (simvastatin 80 mg). Randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses suggest an increase in the risk of diabetes with statins, particularly with higher intensity regimens in people with two or more components of the metabolic syndrome. Other non-cardiovascular effects covered in this review are contrast induced nephropathy, cognition, cataracts, erectile dysfunction, and venous thromboembolism. Currently, systematic reviews and clinical practice guidelines indicate that the cardiovascular benefits of statins generally outweigh non-cardiovascular harms in patients above a certain threshold of cardiovascular risk. Literature is also accumulating on the potential non-cardiovascular benefits of statins, which could lead to novel applications of this class of drug in the future.",

Conversely, the administration of these inhibitors in clinically diagnosed subjects with AD confers little or no benefits over time. Here, we investigated the association between AD and HMGCR rs3846662, a polymorphism known to be involved in the regulation of HMGCR exon 13 skipping, in a founder population and in two distinct mixed North American populations of converting mild cognitively impaired (MCI) subjects (Alzheimer's disease Cooperative study (ADCS) and Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohorts). Targeting more specifically women, the G allele negative (G-) AD subjects exhibit delayed age of onset of AD (P=0.017) and significantly reduced risk of AD (OR: 0.521; P=0.0028), matching the effect size reported by the apolipoprotein E type 2 variant. Stratification for APOE4 in a large sample of MCI patients from the ADCS cohort revealed a significant protective effect of G negative carriers on AD conversion 3 years after MCI diagnosis (odds ratio (OR): 0.554; P=0.041). Conversion rate among APOE4 carriers with the HMGCR's G negative allele was markedly reduced (from 76% to 27%) to levels similar to APOE4 non-carriers (27.14%), which strongly indicate protection. Conversion data from the independent ADNI cohort also showed significantly reduced MCI or AD conversion among APOE4 carriers with the protective A allele (P=0.005). In conclusion, HMGCR rs3846662 acts as a potent genetic modifier for AD risk, age of onset and conversion.",

HMGR inhibitors (more commonly known as statins) are discovered as plasma cholesterol lowering molecules. In this work, 120 atorvastatin analogues were studied using a combination of molecular modeling techniques including three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship (3D-QSAR), molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. The results show that the best CoMFA (comparative molecular field analysis) model has q(2)=0.558 and r(2)=0.977, and the best CoMSIA (comparative molecular similarity indices analysis) model has q(2)=0.582 and r(2)=0.919. Molecular docking and MD simulation explored the binding relationship of the ligand and the receptor protein. The calculation results indicated that the hydrophobic and electrostatic fields play key roles in QSAR model. After MD simulation, we found four vital residues (Lys735, Arg590, Asp690 and Asn686) and three hydrophobic regions in HMGR binding site.

Safety data for coadministration of daptomycin with statins are limited. To determine the safety of coadministration of daptomycin with statin therapy, a multicenter, retrospective, observational study was performed at 13 institutions in the Southeastern United States. Forty-nine adult patients receiving statins concurrently with daptomycin were compared with 171 patients receiving daptomycin without statin therapy. Detailed information, including treatment indication and duration, infecting pathogen, baseline and subsequent CPK levels, and presence of myalgias or muscle complaints, was collected. Myalgias were noted in 3/49 (6.1%) patients receiving combination therapy compared with 5/171 (2.9%) of patients receiving daptomycin alone (P = 0.38). CPK elevations of >1,000 U/liter occurred in 5/49 (10.2%) patients receiving combination therapy compared to 9/171 (5.3%) patients receiving daptomycin alone (P = 0.32). Two of five patients experiencing CPK elevations of >1,000 U/liter in the combination group had symptoms of myopathy. Three patients (6.1%) discontinued therapy due to CPK elevations with concurrent myalgias in the combination group versus 6 patients (3.5%) in the daptomycin-alone group (P = 0.42).

Ultrasound examinations of endothelial function of the rabbit abdominal aorta artery were performed immediately after the 6 weeks (0 wk) and then 3, 6 and 9 wk after that. For off-line analysis, a computerized analysis method for evaluating instantaneous changes in the wall of the rabbit abdominal aorta was used. As parameters of improvement resulting from treatment, endothelium-dependent acetylcholine-induced dilation and endothelium-independent nitroglycerin-induced dilation were evaluated in treated rabbits. Differences among groups were tested using analysis of variance. On histopathology, intima-media thickness decreased after treatment in all groups. There were no significant differences in arterial diameter and blood velocity changes among treated rabbits at 0, 3, 6 and 9 wk of treatment in all groups, except in end-diastolic velocity, radial strain percentage, pulse index and resistance index in group C.

Statin use did not affect the magnitude of cTnI release (group*time p\u00a0= 0.47) or the incidence of runners with cTnI elevation greater than the diagnostic cut-point for myocardial infarction (57% vs 51%, p\u00a0= 0.65). In addition, there was no significant association between statin potency and cTnI release (r\u00a0= 0.09, p\u00a0= 0.65).

Previously we could induce T cell tolerance by applying a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor (HMGCRI) atorvastatin, which also modulates MHC class II expression and has therapeutic potential in autoimmune disease. Here, we aimed at elucidating the impact of this therapeutic strategy on T cell differentiation as a consequence of alterations in dendritic cell function. We investigated the effect of HMGCRI during differentiation of peripheral human monocytes and murine bone marrow precursors to immature DC in vitro and assessed their phenotype. To examine the stimulatory and tolerogenic capacity of these modulated immature dendritic cells, we measured proliferation and suppressive function of CD4+ T cells after stimulation with the modulated immature dendritic cells. We found that an HMGCRI, atorvastatin, prevents dendrite formation during the generation of immature dendritic cells. The modulated immature dendritic cells had a diminished capacity to take up and present antigen as well as to induce an immune response. Of note, the consequence was an increased capacity to differentiate na\u00efve T cells towards a suppressor phenotype that is less sensitive to proinflammatory stimuli and can effectively inhibit the proliferation of T effector cells in vitro. Thus, manipulation of antigen-presenting cells by HMGCRI contributes to an attenuated immune response as shown by promotion of T cells with suppressive capacities.",

This purpose of this study was to determine whether simvastatin combined with an antioxidant could produce the same effect or greater and to examine affected surrogate biomarkers for the neuroinflammation after traumatic brain injury in rat. In our study, cortical contusions were induced, and the effect of acute and continuous treatment of simvastatin and vitamin C on behavior and inflammation in adult rats following experimental TBI was evaluated. The results demonstrated that simvastatin combined with an antioxidant could provide neuroprotection and it may be attributed to a dampening of cerebral vascular endothelial inflammatory response.",

The IT system allowed for complex eligibility criteria with central on and off control of recruitment and flagging at a practice. Good Clinical Practice guidelines, governance and consent procedures were found to have substantially affected the intended simple nature of the trials. One qualitative study of 13 clinicians found that clinicians were generally positive about the principle of computerised trial recruitment (flagging during consultation). However, trials which did not include patients with acute illness were favoured. The second qualitative process evaluation interviewed 27 GPs about their actual experiences, including declining, recruiting and non-recruiting GPs. Opportunistic patient recruitment during a routine GP consultation was found to be the most controversial element. The actual experiences of recruiting patients during unscheduled consultation were generally more positive than the hypothetical views of GPs. Several of the recruiting GPs reported the process took 5 minutes and was straightforward and feasible on most occasions. Almost all GPs expressed their strong support for the use of EHRs for trials.

Shared risk factors for vascular dementia and Alzheimer's disease, as well as frequent coexistence of these pathologies in cognitively impaired older people, suggests convergence of the aetiology, prevention and management of the commonest dementias affecting older people. In light of this understanding, the cognitive impairment associated with cerebrovascular disease is an increasingly important and recognised area of the medicine of older people. Although the incidence of cerebrovascular events is declining in many populations, the overall burden associated with brain vascular disease will continue to increase associated with population ageing. A spectrum of cognitive disorders related to cerebrovascular disease is now recognised. Cerebrovascular disease in older people is associated with specific clinical and imaging findings. Although prevention remains the cornerstone of management, the diagnosis of brain vascular disease is important because of the potential to improve clinical outcomes through clear diagnosis, enhanced control of risk factors, lifestyle interventions and secondary prevention. Specific pharmacological intervention may also be indicated for some patients with cognitive impairment and cerebrovascular disease. However the evidence base to guide intervention remains relatively sparse.",

Simvastatin increased the expression of the P. aeruginosa target genes KLF2, KLF6, IL-8 and CCL20. Furthermore, both simvastatin and P. aeruginosa induced alternative splicing of KLF6. The novel effect of simvastatin on wtKLF6 expression was found to be responsible for induction of the KLF6 regulated genes CCL20 and iNOS. Simvastatin also increased the adhesion of P. aeruginosa to host cells, without altering invasion or cytotoxicity.

STZ-diabetic rats were intragastrically administered with AT (10, 20 mg/kg/d) for consecutive 8 weeks. The effects of AT on body weight, levels of blood glucose, lipometabolism, redox state, cellular metabolism, regulator factor and kidney morphological changes were monitored by routine measurement, biochemistry assay, PT-PCR analysis, ultrastructural and pathological observations, respectively. Compared with the diabetic nephropathy rats, AT elevated the body weight of diabetic nephropathy rats (P<0.01), effectively reduced the blood glucose level (P<0.01), increased the levels of insulin and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in plasma (P<0.01), and decreased the 24 h urine protein content and serum concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (P<0.01). Meanwhile, increase in kidney tissue, the intrarenal activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were enhanced, while the malonaldehyde (MDA) content was reduced (P<0.01). In addition, the expression of transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-\u03b21) mRNA in kidney tissue was notably down-regulated (P<0.01). Furthermore, AT contributed to alleviating STZ-induced nephritic damages in rats.

At the same time, in the animals with acute renal failure the level of creatine phosphokinase was increased by 141%. However, the activity of blood plasma creatine phosphokinase of all animals treated with statins was 14% higher than in the intact control, indicating the minor myotrphic activity of statins in selected mode of administration.

Statins are the first choice for treating lipid abnormalities. Other lipid-lowering agents can be administered when statins are not tolerated and if LDL-C targets are not reached. Furthermore, multifactorial treatment, including a statin, exerts several beneficial effects on cardiovascular and residual risk reduction.

Insulin resistance is at the center of these metabolic abnormalities. Then, hepatocyte injury might be induced by oxidative stress. This ongoing process progresses to NASH, even to cirrhosis in some patients. In addition to oxidative stress, possibilities for the next hit are lipid peroxidation, reactive metabolites, adipose tissue products, transforming growth factor-\u03b2\u2081, Fas ligand, mitochondrial dysfunction, respiratory chain deficiency, and intestinal microbiota. Currently, there is no well-established and approved therapy. Recommendations are to improve existing co-morbidities, such as obesity, hyperlipidemia, or type 2 diabetes, and lifestyle modification with weight loss and exercise.", 
    "220": "Lipid metabolism is one of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) life cycle steps. Statins can reduce cholesterol level and finally can decrease HCV replication. Thus, we assessed the effect of Statins in combination with standard antiviral treatment on hyperlipidemic genotype I HCV infected patients.", 
    "221": "This study was a prospective clinical trial. 40 patients were selected from those referred to educational and Therapeutic Centers of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences from 2009 to 2010 with confirmed HCV viremia. All patients received Peg-interferon-a2a and ribavirin. 20 hyperlipidemic Patients received 20 mg atorvastatin nightly for 3 months and placebo was prescribed for 20 normolipidemic HCV infected patients as a control group. Liver enzymes and complete blood count were checked monthly and thyroid stimulating hormone was checked every 3 months. We also performed quantitative HCV-ribonucleic acid (RNA) test in 12(th) week of therapy, at the end of treatment and 6 months after therapy for all samples.", 
    "222": "We didn't find any significant differences in the mean of HCV-RNA numbers between statin and placebo groups in 12(th) week of treatment, in the end of treatment and 6 months after treatment (P > 0.05).", 
    "223": "Atorvastatin has no effect on the mean of HCV viral load when we added it to standard treatment for hepatitis C infection. Further studies are necessary to examine the possible antiviral properties of statins and their potential role as adjuncts to standard HCV therapy.", 
    "224": "Elevated plasma LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) levels are associated with cardiovascular diseases and statin therapy was proven to decrease LDL-C and reduce cardiovascular death. However, in patients at high cardiovascular risk, achievement of optimal LDL-C levels is challenging, and therefore additional strategies for further loweing LDL-C levels are under development. Recently, silencing of apolipoprotein B gene and MTP inhibition have been approved for the treatment of patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, and there is great interest in the inhibition of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9). PCSK9 promotes the degradation of the LDL receptor. The inhibition of PCSK9 favors LDL catabolism and reduces plasma LDLC levels. Monoclonal antibodies against PCSK9 represent so far the most advanced approach in clinical development, with alirocumab, evolocumab and bococizumab under advanced clinical development. Recent data from the first phase III studies show LDL-C reduction in monotherapy and on top of statins. Long-term studies on cardiovascular endpoints are ongoing and the results will be crucial to translate the benefit of this promising approach into clinical practice.", 
    "225": "Statins can significantly improve the lipid profile and reduce cardiovascular events. However, beneficial effects of statins on renal function are still controversial. PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Web of Knowledge, and ClinicalTrials.gov Web sites were searched for randomized controlled trials. The selected studies reported renal function during treatment with statins and control. Forty-one studies with a total of 88,523 participants were included in this analysis. Compared with statins, placebo group had significantly decreased estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR): the standardized mean difference (SMD) of eGFR in change from baseline was 0.15 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.07 to 0.23, p\u00a0= 0.0004) in patients with eGFR >60\u00a0ml/min and 0.09 (95% CI 0.01 to 0.17, p\u00a0= 0.02) in patients with eGFR 30 to 60\u00a0ml/min. Compared with placebo, statin group had significantly greater reduction of proteinuria: the SMD of proteinuria in change from baseline was\u00a0-1.12 (95% CI\u00a0-1.95 to\u00a0-0.30, p\u00a0= 0.008) in patients with urinary protein excretion 30 to 300\u00a0mg/day and\u00a0-0.77 (95% CI\u00a0-1.35 to\u00a0-0.18, p\u00a0= 0.01) in patients with urinary protein excretion > 300\u00a0mg/day. eGFR was significantly greater with high-intensity statins than with moderate-intensity statins (SMD 0.12, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.16, p\u00a0= 0.00001). Placebo group had significantly decreased eGFR for 1 to 3\u00a0years (SMD 0.05, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.08, p\u00a0= 0.003) and >3\u00a0years (SMD 0.14, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.25, p\u00a0= 0.007) of statin therapy. The beneficial effect of statins on renal function may be dosage related and duration dependent. In conclusion, statins appear to decrease the rate of reduction of eGFR and slow the progression of pathologic proteinuria moderately."
