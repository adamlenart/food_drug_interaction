Furthermore, around 60% of patients with autoimmune myopathy have been shown to have a myositis-specific autoantibody, each of which is associated with a distinct clinical phenotype. The typical clinical presentations of the autoimmune myopathies are reviewed here, and the different myositis-specific autoantibodies, including the anti-synthetase antibodies, dermatomyositis-associated antibodies, and IMNM-associated antibodies, are discussed in detail. This Review also focuses on a newly recognized form of IMNM that is associated with statin use and the production of autoantibodies that recognize 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, the pharmacological target of statins. The contribution of interferon signaling to the development of dermatomyositis and the potential link between malignancies and the initiation of autoimmune myopathies are also assessed.",

Therefore, in this study, we aim to investigate whether pitavastatin treatment attenuates myocardial IR injury via regulating oxidative stress, inflammation, apoptosis, and phosphorylated protein kinase B (pAkt) endothelial nitric oxide synthase (e-NOS) pathways. After the 14-day treatment with pitavastatin (0.16-0.64 mg\u00b7kg\u00b7d, po) or saline, rats were subjected to 45 minutes of ischemia by occluding the left anterior descending coronary artery and to 60 minutes of reperfusion to induce myocardial damage. Pitavastatin at a dose of 0.32 and 0.64 mg/kg significantly improved cardiac function as evidenced by the normalization of the mean arterial pressure, heart rate, \u00b1LVdP/dtmax, and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure as compared with the IR control. Additionally, pitavastatin dose-dependently normalized myocardial antioxidants, lactate dehydrogenase, and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances along with decreased serum tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 level and creatine kinase isoenzyme-MB activity. Furthermore, pitavastatin enhanced pAkt, (p) e-NOS, Bcl-2, and suppressed I\u03baB kinase/nuclear factor-kappa B, nitrotyrosine (NO inactivation product), Bax, and capases-3 protein expression in the heart. Morphological assessments of the IR-challenged myocardium showed that 0.32 and 0.64 mg/kg of pitavastatin decrease myocardial necrosis and inflammatory changes. Thus, pitavastatin reduced IR-induced infarction and dysfunction via the augmentation of endogenous antioxidant, suppression of I\u03baB kinase/nuclear factor-kappa B, activation of pAkt-e-NOS, and/or decreased NO inactivation and apoptosis.",

Furthermore, we determined major hemorheologic variables as well as the plasma levels of homocysteine, folic acid, and vitamin B6 and B12. No patient had obtained folic acid or B vitamin supplement. Platelet aggregation upon agonist-induced stimulation did not differ between patients under high-dose atorvastatin therapy and controls at baseline and after six months (p > 0.05). All hemorheologic parameters (plasma viscosity, red cell aggregation, whole blood viscosity, hematocrit, platelets, leucocytes) measured at baseline and after six months were not significantly different between both groups, too. After therapy with 80 mg atorvastatin homocysteine levels were significantly elevated as compared with baseline values (p = 0.0007), whereas levels remained unchanged in the control group.

To investigate the mechanisms underlying the anti-atheroscleroic action of atorvastatin, we examined the expression of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and its downstream target gene, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) using real-time PCR. In in vitro studies, exposure to high glucose or AGE induced oxidative stress and activation of the AGE/RAGE system in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Treatment of the cells with atorvastatin significantly released the oxidative stress by restoring the levels of glutathione and inhibited the RAGE upregulation. In diabetic Goto Kakisaki (GK) rats fed with a high-fat diet for 12weeks, RAGE and MCP-1 were upregulated in the aortas, and there was a significant correlation between RAGE and MCP-1 mRNA abundance (r=0.482, P=0.031).

Parameters that affect the efficiency of the different extraction methods such as solid phase material, sample pH and elution solvent in the case of SPE; the type and volume of the extracting and dispersive solvent, pH of sample, salt addition and number of extraction steps in the case of DLLME; and the stirring time, pH of sample, sample volume and salt addition for SBSE were evaluated. SPE allowed the best recoveries for most of the analytes. Pravastatin was poorly extracted by DLLME and could not be determined. SBSE was only applicable for lovastatin and simvastatin. However, despite the limitations of having poorer recovery than SPE, DLLME and SBSE offered some advantages because they are simple, require low organic solvent volumes and present low matrix effects.

Biodistribution study revealed preferential accumulation of NLC in the liver and this is advantageous because liver is the target organ for simvastatin. IVIVC studies demonstrated level A correlation between in vitro release and percent drug absorbed.

We hypothesized that the Angiotensin II AT1 receptor is also increased in leukocytes from patients with chronic kidney disease, however and can still be corrected with combined anti-hypertensive treatment with renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockers and statins. Blood pressure, cholesterol, renal function oxidative stress parameters, inflammation, and leukocyte Angiotensin II AT1 receptor mRNA expression were measured both on and (6 weeks) off treatment. Data were compared to data of 10 healthy control subjects. Untreated chronic kidney disease patients (n=20) had higher blood pressure, cholesterol and leukocyte Angiotensin II AT1 receptor mRNA expression, but no different ox-LDL, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, paraoxonase activity or hs-CRP. OxLDL and Lipoprotein(a) were increased in untreated chronic kidney disease. Angiotensin II AT1 receptor expression inversely correlated with renal function (R(2)=0.15, P<0.03) and Lipoprotein(a) but not with the other parameters. Treatment with RAS blockers and statins normalized blood pressure and cholesterol, however it did not correct enhanced leukocyte Angiotensin II AT1 receptor expression. Leukocyte Angiotensin II AT1 receptor expression is inappropriately high in chronic kidney disease, correlates inversely with renal function and does not depend on antihypertensive and lipid-lowering treatment. The uremic environment seems to dominate over previously reported actions of high blood pressure and cholesterol to enhance leukocyte Angiotensin II AT1 receptor expression.",

Achieving LDL-C goals as outlined by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III can be difficult with statins alone; therefore, adjunctive therapy is often indicated to reduce cardiovascular risk. Ezetimibe, a potent inhibitor of intestinal cholesterol absorption, has been shown to be safe, tolerable and effective at lowering LDL-C, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein B, each of which has been correlated with improved clinical outcomes, alone or in combination with a statin. However, because of randomized trials that demonstrated mixed results about atherosclerotic plaque regression via carotid intima-media thickness and a concern about cancer risk, ezetimibe's role in lipid therapy has been questioned. Currently, a large randomized controlled trial is in progress to answer if ezetimibe improves clinical outcomes in patients with high-risk acute coronary syndrome. A smaller trial in patients with chronic kidney disease demonstrated reduced clinical events, including myocardial infarction, stroke and revascularization for patients taking the combination of ezetimibe and simvastatin versus those taking statin or placebo alone.

Cytotoxicity assays demonstrate a synergistic interaction between 3dSB and the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin but not with other IBP inhibitors in a variety of human cancer cell lines. The cytotoxic effects of 3dSB were enhanced in cells incubated in lipid-depleted serum. 3dSB was found to enhance the lovastatin-induced decrease in protein prenylation. In addition, 3dSB decreases intracellular farnesyl pyrophosphate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate levels in both established cell lines and primary cells. To determine whether 3dSB alters the regulation of expression of genes involved in isoprenoid homeostasis, real-time PCR studies were performed in human cell lines cultured in either lipid-replete or -deplete conditions. These studies demonstrate that 3dSB abrogates lovastatin-induced upregulation of sterol regulatory element-containing genes and lovastatin-induced downregulation of ABCA1.

This review studies the existing literature on statins and VTE: one meta-analysis, one randomized controlled trial, four cohort studies and eight case-control studies. The hypothesis of a risk reducing effect of statins on recurrent VTE is supported, but the included studies are heterogeneous; and there is a risk of uncontrolled confounding. Randomized clinical trials aimed at clarifying whether statins can prevent recurrent VTE or not are warranted.",

References from appropriate retrieved articles were also reviewed.", 
    "120": "The guidelines outline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) thresholds and targets to inform optimal use of statins in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Family history of CVD and levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) are risk modifiers in calculating the risk score with the new recommendations. An electronic calculator has been developed to facilitate increased uptake of these guidelines. Large numbers of asymptomatic people, particularly the elderly, will become eligible for statin therapy according to these new guidelines. Poor uptake by physicians and patients might result from the need for repeated testing of hsCRP and LDL-C levels in people who do not perceive themselves to be ill. Controversy persists concerning the role of hsCRP in the reclassification of CVD risk, and the concept of treating LDL-C to target has never been tested as an independent variable in a randomized trial. As two-thirds of the LDL-C lowering achieved by a statin occurs at the initial dose, it might be possible to achieve considerable CVD risk reduction for those at risk by treating initially with a mid-dose statin without LDL-C follow-up.",

    "122": "This study is to investigate the transportation of scutellarin in cell and live models and study on mechanism of absorption and transport of scutellarin in mouse liver. The concentration of scutellarin in plasma and liver from control and pretreated groups was determined by high performance liquid chromatography. The uptake of scutellarin was examined in control hepatocytes group, induced hepatocytes group and induced hepatocytes plus pravastatin group. Pravastatin can affect the pharmacokinetics of scutellarin in mouse: CL is decreased while AUC is increased. The scutellarin absorption of hepatocyte induced group was higher than that of control group, but was decreased in the group with pravastatin added. The research showed that there was potential drug interaction between pravastatin and scutellarin. The drugs may compete for oatp2 mediated transport pathway consisted in the uptake of scutellarin in liver.", 
    "123": "Inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, known as statins, have revolutionized the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and coronary artery disease prevention. However, there are considerable issues regarding statin safety and further development of residual risk control, particularly for diabetic and metabolic syndrome patients. Pitavastatin is a potent statin with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol-lowering effects comparable to those of atorvastatin or rosuvastatin. Pitavastatin has a high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol raising effect, may improve insulin resistance, and has little influence on glucose metabolism. Considering these factors along with its unique pharmacokinetic properties, which suggest minimal drug-drug interaction, pitavastatin could provide an alternative treatment choice, especially in patients with glucose intolerance or diabetes mellitus. Many clinical trials are now underway to test the clinical efficacy of pitavastatin in various settings and are expected to provide further information.", 
    "124": "Progressive renal function loss is still a threat to health despite the presence and use of renal protective drugs such as ACEi and ARB. This unmet need appears to be related to factors like a residual high blood pressure and residual albuminuria. Strategies that enhance the efficacy of RAAS blockade, such as increasing the dose of ACEi or ARB, combining ACEi and ARB, or new RAAS inhibitor drugs like the direct renin inhibitors may help us in improving renal protection. However, it is likely that renal disease progression is caused by multiple risk factors and that we will need multiple approaches to tackle this residual risk. Recent trials testing the effect of vitamin D receptor activators and the effect of statins indicate that drugs in these classes may become valuable extra tools (in addition to ACEi or ARB) to tackle the unmet need in renal protection.", 
    "125": "The prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing alarmingly mainly as a result of an ongoing epidemic of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes mellitus. CKD is a well-recognized risk multiplier for development of cardiovascular disease (CVD), and it is widely known that CVD is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with CKD. Cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality is significantly increased along the continuum of CKD, and it is more than 10 times higher in end-stage renal disease populations than in the general population. Lipid metabolism is profoundly disturbed in CKD, and there is a gradual shift to the uremic lipid profile as kidney function deteriorates, which is further modified by the presence of comorbidities such as diabetes and obesity. Apart from quantitative differences, major qualitative changes in lipoproteins can be observed, such as oxidization and modification to small and dense low-density lipoprotein (LDL), which render the particles more atherogenic. It has been noted that these abnormalities contribute to the development of CV events, and they may lead to the progression of CKD. Lipid-lowering treatment with statins in the general population has achieved important benefits both in reducing CV risk and in the prevention of CVD. Similarly, data from secondary analyses of CKD subgroups of larger prospective trials using statins also suggest an important benefit on CV outcomes and, with more conflicting evidence, on the progression of kidney disease. Preliminary results from a large randomized controlled trial of lipid-lowering therapy in CKD confirm similar benefits of treatment for dyslipidemia in patients with CKD and ESRD. The safety profile of lipid- lowering therapy with statins in CKD is not different from that observed in people with normal renal function. Hence, lipid- lowering therapy with statins should be part of the standard treatment of patients with CKD.",

    "127": "Effects of lovastatin alone or in combination with a small interference RNA to inhibit AR expression on cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis were assessed by [(3)H] thymidine incorporation and caspase-3 activity assay. PSA levels were measured in the cell culture supernatant by immunoassay. In addition, expression and activity of AR and Akt/protein kinase B (Akt) were determined by Western blotting and real-time polymerase chain reaction as well as by luciferase reporter gene assay.", 
    "128": "Our results show that lovastatin significantly reduces AR expression and activity, resulting in decreased PSA levels. These effects were associated with inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis. In addition, we observed that the Akt signaling pathway plays a pivotal role in lovastatin-mediated regulation of AR signaling.",

We report on six patients treated by hemodiafiltration with a high cut-off membrane (HCO-HDF) for myoglobinuric acute renal failure. Rhabdomyolysis was caused by infection in two patients, by a statin in one patient and a non-traumatic crush in another, and followed cardiovascular surgery in two others. Ten HCO-HDF procedures were performed. A high cut-off hemofilter was used, with citrate anticoagulation and postdilutional fluid substitution of 2-3 L/h, dialysate flow 500 mL/min, and blood flow within 250-300 mL/min. Albumin losses were replaced by infusion of human albumin solution, and the mean myoglobin reduction ratio was 77% (range, 62-89%). An excellent clearance of 81 mL/min (range 42-131 mL/min) was achieved. Nearly 5 g of myoglobin was removed into the dialysate collected in one of the procedures. A high rebound in serum myoglobin, on average to 244% of the post-procedure myoglobin level, was observed. The four patients alive at the time remained anuric for a week. Slow myoglobin elimination with a mean half-time of 39 h (range 19-59 h) was observed in that period. Highly efficient myoglobin removal by high cut-off membrane hemodiafiltration was demonstrated in our patients. Rapid redistribution from the extracellular fluid and sustained myoglobin release were suggested by the high rebound observed. Elimination of myoglobin within the body was shown in our study to occur slowly during the period of anuria.",

This lymphocyte-suppressing effect, which was accompanied by a decrease in plasma levels of hsCRP and ICAM-1 (P<0.001), was strongest in patients receiving both simvastatin and ezetimibe. There were no differences in lymphocyte-suppressing, systemic anti-inflammatory and endothelial protective effects of simvastatin between insulin-resistant and insulin-sensitive subjects, whereas the effects of ezetimibe and the combined treatment were greater in the former group of patients (P<0.01 and P<0.001, respectively).", 
    "139": "The results of this study indicate that simvastatin is superior to ezetimibe in producing lymphocyte-suppressing, systemic anti-inflammatory and endothelial protective effects in patients with elevated cholesterol levels. Hypercholesterolaemic patients with high cardiovascular risk may receive the greatest benefits from concomitant treatment with a statin and ezetimibe.", 
    "140": "Statins represent a major advance in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, a significant risk factor for atherosclerosis. There is, however, notable interindividual variation in the cholesterolemic response to statins, and the origin of this variability is poorly understood; pharmacogenetics has attempted to determine the role of genetic factors. Myopathy, further, has been reported in a considerable percentage of patients, but the mechanisms underlying muscle injury have yet to be fully characterized. Most statins are the substrates of several cytochrome P450s (CYP). CYP polymorphisms may be responsible for variations in hypolipidemic activity; inhibitors of CYPs, e.g. of CYP3A4, can significantly raise plasma concentrations of several statins, but consequences in terms of clinical efficacy are not uniform. Pravastatin and rosuvastatin are not susceptible to CYP inhibition but are substrates of the organic anion-transporting polypeptide (OATP) 1B1, encoded by the SLCO1B1 gene. Essentially all statins are, in fact, substrates of membrane transporters: SLCO1B1 polymorphisms can decrease the liver uptake, as well as the therapeutic potential of these agents, and may be linked to their muscular side-effects. A better understanding of the mechanisms of statin handling will help to minimize adverse effects and interactions, as well as to improve their lipid-lowering efficiency.", 
    "141": "In this study, (1)H NMR-based metabonomics was applied to evaluate the beneficial effects of cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine), a natural monomer compound, on endogenous metabolic profiles of liver and plasma from hyperlipidemic Syrian golden hamsters. Hyperlipidemia was successfully established in hamsters fed by a high-fat diet for 2 weeks. The hyperlipidemic hamsters were treated with an oral administration of simvastatin (2\u00a0mg\u00a0kg(-\u00a01)) or cordycepin (140\u00a0mg\u00a0kg(-\u00a01)) for consecutive 4 weeks. The metabolic profiles of plasma and intact liver tissues were established using (1)H NMR spectroscopy. The results showed higher contents of lipids (triglyceride and cholesterol), lactate, acetate, alanine, glutamine together with lower contents of choline-containing compounds (e.g. phosphocholine, phosphatidylcholine, and glycerophosphocholine), glucose, and glycogen in plasma and liver samples from hyperlipidemic hamsters than those in controls. Cordycepin afforded a little lipid-regulating activity on plasma but more beneficial effects on liver, implicating that cordycepin might have a protective effect on liver under fatty liver condition.", 
    "142": "Rac1-GTPase activation plays a key role in the development and progression of cardiac remodeling. Therefore, we engineered a transgenic mouse model by overexpressing cDNA of a constitutively active form of Zea maize Rac gene (ZmRacD) specifically in the hearts of FVB/N mice. Echocardiography and MRI analyses showed cardiac hypertrophy in old transgenic mice, as evidenced by increased left ventricular (LV) mass and LV mass-to-body weight ratio, which are associated with relative ventricular chamber dilation and systolic dysfunction. LV hypertrophy in the hearts of old transgenic mice was further confirmed by an increased heart weight-to-body weight ratio and histopathology analysis. The cardiac remodeling in old transgenic mice was coupled with increased myocardial Rac-GTPase activity (372%) and ROS production (462%). There were also increases in \u03b1(1)-integrin (224%) and \u03b2(1)-integrin (240%) expression. This led to the activation of hypertrophic signaling pathways, e.g., ERK1/2 (295%) and JNK (223%). Pravastatin treatment led to inhibition of Rac-GTPase activity and integrin signaling. Interestingly, activation of ZmRacD expression with thyroxin led to cardiac dilation and systolic dysfunction in adult transgenic mice within 2 wk. In conclusion, this is the first study to show the conservation of Rho/Rac proteins between plant and animal kingdoms in vivo. Additionally, ZmRacD is a novel transgenic model that gradually develops a cardiac phenotype with aging. Furthermore, the shift from cardiac hypertrophy to dilated hearts via thyroxin treatment will provide us with an excellent system to study the temporal changes in cardiac signaling from adaptive to maladaptive hypertrophy and heart failure.", 
    "143": "Vitamin E represents a family of compounds that is divided into two subgroups called tocopherols and tocotrienols, which act as important antioxidants that regulate peroxidation reactions and control free-radical production within the body. However, many of the biological effects of vitamin E are mediated independently of its antioxidant activity. Although tocopherols and tocotrienols have the same basic chemical structure characterized by a long phytyl chain attached to a chromane ring, only tocotrienols display potent anticancer activity, by modulating multiple intracellular signaling pathways associated with tumor cell proliferation and survival, and combination therapy with other chemotherapeutic agents result in a synergistic anticancer response. Combination therapy is most effective when tocotrienols are combined with agents that have complementary anticancer mechanisms of action. These findings strongly suggest that the synergistic antiproliferative and apoptotic effects demonstrated by combined low dose treatment of \u03b3-tocotrienol with other chemotherapeutic agents may provide significant health benefits in the prevention and/or treatment of breast cancer in women, while at the same time avoiding tumor resistance and toxic side effects associated with high dose monotherapy.",

The thickness (IMT) and echogenicity (IM-GSM) of the intima-media complex were also measured. Bisphenol A (BPA) and 10 phthalate metabolites were analyzed in serum by a API 4000 liquid chromatograph/tandem mass spectrometer.",

This pattern was significant after adjustment for gender, body mass index, blood glucose, blood pressure, HDL and LDL-cholesterol, serum triglycerides, smoking, antihypertensive treatment and statin use (p=0.004). High levels of BPA, mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP) and MMP were associated with an echogenic IM-GSM and plaque GSM, while high levels of mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP) were associated with an echolucent IM-GSM and plaque GSM (p<0.0001 after adjustment).",

    "148": "In this study we aimed to investigate the vasorelaxant and antiatherogenic effects of the statins (fluvastatin and pravastatin) in the human saphenous vein grafts at the molecular level by using histopathologic, pharmacological and immunochemical techniques. The saphenous vein grafts evaluated histopathologically displayed a loss in their endothelium up to a ratio of 30% and set forth indications of functional deterioration. The pharmacological evaluations proved that the relaxation responses induced by fluvastatin and pravastatin were significantly inhibited by nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, N(G)-nitro-l-arginine, and cyclooxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, while these responses were significantly increased by angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, captopril and enalapril, and rho kinase inhibitor, Y27632. The results of immunochemical studies are in accordance with the results of the pharmacological studies that the related statins increased the levels of nitric oxide, phospholipase A(2) and they decreased the levels of angiotensin II and active rho kinase. On the other hand mevalonolactone, a substrate of lipid metabolism, failed to change the effects of fluvastatin and pravastatin in the related tissue. The experimental results indicate that activation of nitric oxide synthase and phospholipase A(2)-cyclooxygenase pathway and inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme and rho kinase may have a role on the effects of fluvastatin and pravastatin in the human saphenous vein grafts. It seems that the vasorelaxant and antiatherogenic effects of the related statins are independent of their lipid lowering mechanism.",

In this study, effects of atorvastatin on spatial recognition memory and the involvement of nitric oxide (NO) has been determined on consolidation and retrieval of memory in a two-trial recognition Y-maze test. Memory was impaired using scopolamine (1mg/kg, i.p.); atorvastatin (1, 5mg/kg, p.o.) was administered, either in presence or in absence of a non-specific NO synthase inhibitor, L-NAME (3, 10mg/kg, i.p.); a specific inducible NO synthase inhibitor, aminoguanidine (100mg/kg, i.p.); and a NO precursor, L-arginine (750 mg/kg, i.p.).", 
    "150": "1) atorvastatin (5mg/kg) significantly improved memory performance in a dose-dependent manner on consolidation and retrieval stage of memory in scopolamine-treated mice; 2) the beneficial effects of atorvastatin on memory consolidation was significantly reversed by L-NAME (10mg/kg) and aminoguanidine; 3) L-arginine slightly potentiated the effects of sub-effective dose of atorvastatin (1mg/kg) on memory consolidation; 4) either L-NAME (up to 10mg/kg), or aminoguanidine did not affect the memory improvement by atorvastatin on retrieval stage; 5) the effects of sub-effective dose of atorvastatin (1mg/kg) on retrieval of memory were not potentiated by L-arginine. The present study demonstrates that atorvastatin improves both consolidation and retrieval phases of memory. This effect is affected by NO synthase inhibitors and NO precursor, L-arginine, only in memory consolidation phase, but not in retrieval phase. It is concluded that NO might be involved in consolidation of spatial memory improvement by atorvastatin.",

Principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to study metabolic patterns of endothelial dysfunction rats and healthy control rats. 1-Methyladenosine, indoxyl sulfate, hippuric acid, riboflavin, coproporphyrin, and p-cresol glucuronide were identified as potential biomarkers, indicating that pathways of adenine, tryptophan, phenylalanine, riboflavin and porphyrin metabolism were disturbed in endothelial dysfunction rats. Applications of simvastatin and tongxinluo to endothelial dysfunction rats improved endothelial function according to the results of histopathology and measurements of endothelin-1 and nitric oxide. Metabonomic studies suggested that tongxinluo prevents endothelial dysfunction by regulating multiple metabolic pathways to their normal state, whereas simvastatin only altered selected metabolic pathways. This research demonstrated that metabonomics is a powerful and promising tool for disease investigation and the efficacy evaluation of complex traditional Chinese medicines.",

Discontinuation for flushing did not differ with regard to maximum dose, or to the presence or type of statin combined with NER.", 
    "168": "Although flushing was common with NER treatment, discontinuation due to flushing occurred in only 5-6% of patients in this pooled analysis. This could be due to several factors, including the fact that all patients in the NER trials were educated about flushing and its management. Translation of methodology employed in these trials into clinical practice may improve long-term adherence to NER therapy, which would enhance the therapeutic benefit of NER for reducing cardiovascular risk.", 
    "169": "Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a key regulator of circulating levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles. PCSK9 acts mainly by enhancing degradation of the LDL receptor in the liver. Several gain-of-function and loss-of-function mutations in the PCSK9 gene have been identified and linked to hypercholesterolemia and hypocholesterolemia, respectively. Since the loss-of-function mutations in humans are associated with protection against coronary heart disease, and with no apparent deleterious effects, PCSK9 inhibition is becoming attractive as a new strategy for lowering LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) levels, particularly in combination with statins. Candidate patient populations for PCSK9 inhibition include those with familial hypercholesterolemia, patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease not controlled by statin therapy, and patients with poor tolerance or total intolerance to statin therapy. PCSK9 inhibition represents a very promising target for reducing LDL-C levels and decreasing the risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases, but human clinical trials will be crucial to assess the potency and safety of PCSK9 inhibitors.",

    "171": "Data used were from METEOR (Measuring Effects on Intima-Media Thickness: an Evaluation Of Rosuvastatin), a randomized controlled trial of rosuvastatin 40 mg among 984 low-risk patients with modest carotid intima-media thickening (CIMT). In this analysis, duplicate ultrasound images from 12 carotid sites were collected at the baseline and end of the study from 495 European patients and were evaluated for plaque presence and severity. Plaques were scored from near and far walls of the 12 sites (0= none; 1= minimal; 2= moderate; 3= severe) and plaque scores (PS) were combined into two summary measures for each examination. The MeanMaxPS is the mean over the 12 carotid sites of the maximum score at each site and the MaxMaxPS reflects the most severe lesion at any site.",

    "174": "A recent study in men without prostate cancer suggested that extended use of common medications (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), thiazide diuretics and statins) may lower serum total prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels by clinically relevant amounts. The present study evaluated the impact of these drugs in patients with clinically localized prostate cancer. A retrospective analysis of 177 patients was performed. The multivariate regression analyses were adjusted for age, prostate volume, Gleason score, T stage, diagnostic setting (clinical symptoms versus elevated PSA only) and presence of diabetes mellitus. Drug use increased with age, e.g. to 50% in patients \u226570 years. The most commonly used drugs were statins (32% of all patients, including those who used drug combinations), followed by NSAIDs (21%) and thiazide diuretics (13%). Drug use was associated with a statistically significant PSA reduction (12%, when comparing 104 non-users to 73 users of any of the three drug types; adjusted analysis, p=0.01). Compared to the U.S.A. National Comprehensive Cancer Network risk group assignment based on measured PSA level, reassignment after correcting for medication use resulted in 8 changes among 57 patients with low or intermediate risk (14%). No such changes can be expected in patients belonging to the high-risk group. These results support the concerns expressed previously, given that risk group assignment, which may be inaccurate in patients using concomitant medications, eventually guides choice of treatment.", 
    "175": "Calcific aortic valve disease is associated with the differentiation of valvular interstitial cells (VICs) to myofibroblast and osteoblast-like cells, particularly in the fibrosa layer of the valve. Previous studies suggested that C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) protects against calcific aortic valve disease to maintain homeostasis. We aimed to determine whether CNP inhibits VIC pathological differentiation as a mechanism to explain its protective effects.", 
    "176": "CNP expression was prominent in normal porcine aortic valves, particularly on the ventricular side, but reduced in sclerotic valves concomitant with the appearance of pathological VIC phenotypes in the fibrosa. In vitro, CNP inhibited calcified aggregate formation and bone-related transcript and protein expression by VICs grown in osteogenic conditions. Under myofibrogenic culture conditions, CNP reduced \u03b1-smooth muscle actin expression and cell-mediated gel contraction, indicating inhibition of myofibroblast differentiation. Similar to CNP, simvastatin inhibited VIC osteoblast and myofibroblast differentiation in vitro. Strikingly, simvastatin upregulated CNP expression in VICs cultured under myofibrogenic conditions, and small interfering RNA knockdown of natriuretic peptide receptor-b (a CNP receptor) significantly reduced the antifibrotic effect of simvastatin, suggesting that it acts in part via CNP/NPR-B autocrine/paracrine signaling.", 
    "177": "CNP inhibits myofibroblast and osteoblast differentiation of VICs and is responsible in part for inhibition of VIC myofibroblast differentiation by statins, suggesting novel mechanisms to explain the protective effect of CNP and the pleiotropic effects of statins in the aortic valve.",

During a 2-year follow-up period, no significant problems concerning safety were observed upon treatment with pitavastatin. Pitavastatin demonstrated potent and stable lowering of the LDL-cholesterol level. The LIVES study subanalyses revealed significant and continuous elevation of HDL-cholesterol in association with pitavastatin treatment and also showed that the drug did not adversely affect glycemic control as evaluated by the glycohemoglobin A(1c) level. Moreover, pitavastatin treatment was associated with an increase in estimated glomerular filtration rate in subjects with chronic kidney disease. These results suggest the usefulness of pitavastatin in hypercholesterolemic patients from various backgrounds. The ongoing LIVES study extension is expected to provide further data on cardiovascular outcome in subjects treated with pitavastatin.",

Specifically, the mechanism of action and metabolism of simvastatin, the most known and studied molecule among the statin family, are critically reviewed.", 
    "186": "Various cellular pathways have been implicated in COPD, with alveolar macrophages emerging as pivotal inflammatory mediators in the COPD patho-physiology. Recently, emerging anti-cytokine therapies, such as PDE4 inhibitors and ACE inhibitors, have shown good anti-inflammatory properties that can be useful in COPD treatment. Recently, statins as a drug class have gained much interest with respect to COPD management, following studies which show simvastatin to exert effective anti-inflammatory effects, via inhibition of the mevalonic acid cascade in alveolar macrophages.", 
    "187": "We investigated the effects of statin treatment on platelet-derived microparticles (PMPs) and thrombin generation in atherothrombotic disease. Nineteen patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease were randomised to eight weeks of treatment with atorvastatin or placebo in a cross-over fashion. Expression of GPIIIa (CD61), P-selectin (CD62P), tissue factor (TF, CD142) and phosphatidylserine (PS; annexin-V or lactadherin binding) was assessed on PMPs. Thrombin generation in vivo was assessed by measurement of prothrombin fragment 1+2 in plasma (F1+2) and ex vivo by using the calibrated automated thrombogram (CAT). During atorvastatin treatment, expression of TF, P-selectin and GPIIIa was significantly reduced vs. placebo (p<0.001 for all). No effect on annexin-V or lactadherin binding was seen. Thrombin generation was significantly reduced during atorvastatin as assessed by both the CAT assay (p<0.001) and by measurements of F1+2 (p<0.01). Subsequent in vitro experiments showed that when TF on microparticles (MPs) was blocked by antibodies, the initiation of thrombin generation was slightly but significantly delayed. Blocking PS on MPs using annexin-V or lactadherin resulted in almost complete inhibition of thrombin generation. In conclusion, atorvastatin reduces thrombin generation and expression of TF, GPIIIa and P-selectin on PMPs in patients with peripheral vascular disease. Microparticle-bound TF slightly enhances initiation of thrombin generation whereas negatively charged surfaces provided by MPs or lipoproteins could reinforce thrombin generation. Statins may inhibit initiation of thrombin generation partly through a microparticle dependent mechanism but the main effect is probably through reduction of lipoprotein levels.", 
    "188": "Statins have important pleiotropic effects and have been shown to reduce vascular inflammation. Some evidence suggests that statins may have a role in the primary prevention of atrial fibrillation (AF), whereas little is know on the role of statins in patients with existing AF. We performed a meta-analysis of the literature to assess the effect of statins on the recurrence of AF after electrical cardioversion or ablation. MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were searched up to January 2010. Relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were then calculated and pooled using a random-effects model. Statistical heterogeneity was evaluated through the use of I\u00b2 statistics. Sixteen studies were included in our systematic review. Statins did not reduce the risk of AF recurrence after ablation (four studies including 750 patients; RR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.85-1.28, p=0.71; I\u00b2 = 34%). Conversely, the use of statins was associated with a significantly reduced risk of AF recurrence after electrical cardioversion (12 studies including 1790 patients; RR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.67-0.90, p=0.0003; I\u00b2 = 34%). This reduction was not statistically significant when the analysis was restricted to randomised controlled trials (RCTs) only (five studies, 458 patients, RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.48-1.20). In conclusion, statins may lower the risk of AF recurrence after electrical cardioversion, but not ablation. However, this finding should be considered with caution, and larger RCTs are warranted to confirm our preliminary results.", 
    "189": "The lipid-lowering agent pravastatin and the antidepressant paroxetine are among the most widely prescribed drugs in the world. Unexpected interactions between them could have important public health implications. We mined the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) for side-effect profiles involving glucose homeostasis and found a surprisingly strong signal for comedication with pravastatin and paroxetine. We retrospectively evaluated changes in blood glucose in 104 patients with diabetes and 135 without diabetes who had received comedication with these two drugs, using data in electronic medical record (EMR) systems of three geographically distinct sites. We assessed the mean random blood glucose levels before and after treatment with the drugs. We found that pravastatin and paroxetine, when administered together, had a synergistic effect on blood glucose. The average increase was 19 mg/dl (1.0 mmol/l) overall, and in those with diabetes it was 48 mg/dl (2.7 mmol/l). In contrast, neither drug administered singly was associated with such changes in glucose levels. An increase in glucose levels is not a general effect of combined therapy with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and statins.",
