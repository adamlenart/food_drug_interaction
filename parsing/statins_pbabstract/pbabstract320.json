This research focuses on the effect of adding red mold rice to hens' diet on cholesterol level in egg yolk and on cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in serum. Forty-eight Hy-line laying hens of 48 weeks of age were studied by dividing them into four groups. Except for the control group, the feed for three other groups contained 2.0, 5.0, and 8.0% red mold rice (monacolin K concentrations were 0.0145, 0.035, and 0.056%, respectively). The experiment lasted 6 weeks. During this period, egg weight and egg production were recorded every day, and cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL, and LDL in serum were measured weekly as well. The result showed that the cholesterol in eggs produced by experimental groups was lower than that of the control group (0%, 194.14 +/- 8.30; 2%, 167.17 +/- 4.34; 5%, 168.93 +/- 9.38; 8%, 183.02 +/- 7.63 mg/egg; p < 0.05), and the triglyceride (0%, 1494 +/- 178; 2%, 1280 +/- 174; 5%, 1189 +/- 248; 8%, 1381 +/- 218 mg/dL; p < 0.05) and LDL levels (0%, 36.81 +/- 5.53; 2%, 32.25 +/- 7.93; 5%, 30.06 +/- 4.39; 8%, 28.81 +/- 4.16 mg/dL; p < 0.05) were also significantly lowered in the experimental groups. However, the HDL level did not show significant change for either control or experimental groups (0%, 36.06 +/- 3.96; 2%, 36.25 +/- 5.39; 5%, 33.13 +/- 3.68; 8%, 31.44 +/- 4.29 mg/dL; p > 0.05). Besides, the addition of red mold rice also helps to inhibit production of malondialdehyde (MDA) in serum lipid oxidation (0%, 27.42 +/- 0.53; 2%, 25.62 +/- 0.76; 5%, 24.35 +/- 0.59; 8%, 23.63 +/- 0.48 microM; p < 0.05).", 
    "1": "Patients with diabetes are at high risk for the development of coronary artery disease and have a significantly impaired prognosis after ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) as compared with non-diabetic patients. The beneficial effect of pharmaceutical treatment for secondary prevention after STEMI is proven also for diabetics, but little is known about its use in clinical practice. Between June 1994 and December 2000, consecutive patients with STEMI, admitted to hospital within 24 h of symptoms onset, were enrolled into the multicenter MITRA registry in 61 hospitals in Germany. We examined whether there were differences in the frequencies of pharmaceutical secondary prevention after STEMI and in long-term outcomes between diabetics and nondiabetics in 8206 patients who had been discharged alive and followed for a mean period of 17 months. The prevalence of diabetes in 8206 patients discharged alive after acute STEMI was 18%. Diabetics were older and more often female, and more often already had prior myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke than non-diabetics. As chronic discharge medication, diabetics received aspirin and betablockers less often, but more often ACE inhibitors than non-diabetics. The mortality rate 17 months after STEMI was nearly twice as high in diabetics than in non-diabetics (19.1% vs. 10.4%, p<0.01 at univariate analysis; OR=1.50 and 95% CI 1.27-1.77 at multivariate analysis). The combined endpoint of death, MI and stroke occurred in 25.8% of diabetics, but only in 15.8% of non-diabetics ( p<0.01). Long-term treatment with aspirin, betablockers and ACE inhibitors in diabetics was associated with a significant reduction of mortality. Diabetics received intensive pharmaceutical therapy for secondary prevention significantly less often than non-diabetics, although the beneficial effects of this treatment were similar or even more pronounced as compared with non-diabetics. Diabetes was an independent predictor of increased mortality in follow-up after acute STEMI. Intensifying secondary prevention by a more frequent use of established pharmaceutical regimes might improve the prognosis of diabetics after STEMI and prevent cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events.", 
    "2": "Clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of statins in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and lowering coronary heart disease risk. However, many patients receiving statin therapy in clinical practice are not achieving their LDL-C goals. Generally, statins are initiated at starting doses, and doses should be titrated as needed until the goal of therapy is achieved or a second lipid-lowering drug is required; titration is required in the majority of patients who receive less efficacious agents. Most patients receiving statin therapy in clinical practice are maintained on their starting dose, and this frequently results in inadequate control of elevated cholesterol levels. A number of factors may limit dose titration in clinical practice, including the cost of therapy, safety of prescribing statins at high doses and the additional office visits required for evaluations and monitoring. There may be several solutions to this problem. The choice of statin appears to be one of the important factors influencing the success of therapy. Selecting a statin that provides greater LDL-C lowering enables more patients to achieve LDL-C goals, and the majority of patients can be effectively treated with starting doses of the more efficacious statins. Another factor influencing the success of therapy is the willingness to add other drugs to a statin to enhance LDL-C lowering. Choices here include niacin, a bile acid sequestrant, and ezetimibe, a new cholesterol absorption inhibitor. Of these approaches, use of a more efficacious statin is preferred to combination therapy because of cost, safety, effectiveness, and simplicity issues.", 
    "3": "Clinical and experimental evidence suggests that the pathways by which hypertension and dyslipidemia lead to vascular disease may overlap and that angiotensin II (Ang II) is involved in restructuring of the arterial wall in both atherosclerosis and hypertension. Ang II represents a potent proinflammatory agent promoting recruitment of monocytes into the vascular intima. Ang II also indirectly facilitates transformation of macrophages and smooth muscle cells into foam cells by promoting superoxide radical formation (via NADP/NADPH oxidase stimulation). The oxidative stress produced by Ang II leads to enhanced low-density lipoprotein oxidation and degradation of nitric oxide, an important vascular protective molecule capable of retarding atherosclerosis progression. The importance of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) in atherogenesis is highlighted by studies in animal models as well as human beings indicating that inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme or blockade of type 1 Ang II receptors retards the development of atherosclerotic lesions. In light of a causal and central role of Ang II in atherogenesis, blockade of the RAS represents an important therapeutic consideration in the prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic disease.", 
    "4": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease. We investigated whether atorvastatin, a powerful agent for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease, influences ACE production in endothelial cells. Human umbilical cord vein endothelial cells were treated with VEGF (476 pM), which induced ACE upregulation. Cotreatment with atorvastatin (0.1-10 microM) dose dependently inhibited VEGF-induced ACE upregulation. In the presence of mevalonate (100 microM), atorvastatin failed to downregulate VEGF-induced ACE production. Cotreatment of the cells with either farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP; 5 microM) or geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP; 5 microM) partially inhibited the suppressive effect of atorvastatin. Pretreatment of the cells with Rho-associated protein kinase inhibitor, Y-27632 (10 microM), partially inhibited VEGF-induced ACE upregulation. VEGF (476 pM) caused PKC phosphorylation, which was inhibited by cotreatment of the cells with atorvastatin. Atorvastatin inhibited VEGF-induced ACE upregulation probably by inhibiting PKC phosphorylation. This effect was mediated via inhibition of the mevalonate pathway. ACE downregulation may be an additional beneficial effect of statins in the treatment of cardiovascular disease.", 
    "5": "The mechanisms responsible for interindividual variation in response to statin therapy remain uncertain. It has been shown that hepatic cholesterol synthesis is associated with ATP binding cassette transporter G5 and G8 (ABCG5/8) activities. To test the hypothesis that genetic variation in ABCG5/8 might influence the plasma lipid response to statin therapy, we examined five nonsynonymous polymorphisms at the ABCG5/8 loci (Q604E, D19H, Y54C, T400K, and A632V) in 338 hypercholesterolemic patients treated with 10 mg atorvastatin. In carriers of the D19H variant, means of posttreatment values and adjusted percent reductions in LDL cholesterol (LDLC) were significantly lower (P = 0.028) and greater (P = 0.036) (112 mg/dl, 39.7%) than those of noncarriers (119 mg/dl, 36.2%), respectively, while no significant difference was observed in percent reductions in total cholesterol. Stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed significant and independent associations with absolute or percent reduction between D19H genotype and posttreatment LDL cholesterol levels. The other polymorphisms were not significantly associated with treatment effects. These results suggest that, in patients with hypercholesterolemia, the ABCG8 D19H variant is associated with greater LDLC-lowering response to atorvastatin therapy.", 
    "6": "Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus exhibit hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia as well as a markedly increased incidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Here we report the characterization of a novel arylthiazolidinedione capable of lowering both glucose and lipid levels in animal models. This compound, designated TZD18, is a potent agonist with dual human peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-alpha/gamma activities. In keeping with its PPARgamma activity, TZD18 caused complete normalization of the elevated glucose in db/db mice and Zucker diabetic fatty rats. TZD18 lowered both cholesterol and triglycerides in hamsters and dogs. TZD18 inhibited cholesterol biosynthesis at steps before mevalonate and reduced hepatic levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity. Moreover, TZD18 significantly suppressed gene expression of fatty acid synthesis and induced expression of genes for fatty acid degradation and triglyceride clearance. Studies on 17 additional PPARalpha or PPARalpha/gamma agonists showed that lipid lowering in hamsters correlated with the magnitude of hepatic gene expression changes. Importantly, the presence of PPARgamma agonism did not affect the relationship between hepatic gene expression and lipid lowering. Taken together, these data suggest that PPARalpha/gamma agonists, such as TZD18, affect lipid homeostasis, leading to an antiatherogenic plasma lipid profile. Agents with these properties may provide favorable means for treatment of type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia and the prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.", 
    "7": "Data from randomized trials document that the frequency of major vascular events can be significantly reduced by lowering serum cholesterol and systolic blood pressure in high-risk patients. The recent publication of the Heart Protection Study (HPS) provided randomized trial evidence to support the recommendation of the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III to broaden statin use to include patients whose risk for a coronary event is equivalent to that among patients with manifest coronary artery disease, such as those with diabetes or cerebral, aortic, or peripheral vascular disease. Similarly, recent meta-analyses of hypertension trials provide us precise estimates of the benefits of lowering blood pressure. Risk and risk reduction data from these trials were applied to 153,305 Veterans Health Administration primary care patients to assess the health impact and costs of lowering cholesterol and blood pressure more aggressively in this population. Based on the results, it was estimated that 98,598 major vascular events might be prevented and $302,074,587 saved over 5 years if all patients were treated according to the HPS criteria and the recommendations of the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure. It is anticipated that achieving these goals will not be possible without significant, innovative system changes, such as disease management programs with electronic chart abstraction to identify patients who do not meet these recommendations.", 
    "8": "Morbidity of patients with Syndrome X (SX; chest pain and normal coronary angiograms) is high and is associated with continuing episodes of chest pain and hospitalization. Impairment of microvascular endothelial function caused by increased oxidative stress has been suggested to be a mechanism of the disease. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) is the major antioxidant enzyme system of the vascular wall. This study sought to establish whether combination treatment with ACE inhibitors and statins reduces oxidative stress and improves quality of life of patients with cardiac SX.", 
    "9": "Forty-five patients with SX were randomly assigned to receive either a combination of ramipril (10 mg/d) and atorvastatin (40 mg/d) or placebo for 6 months. We determined the activity of extracellular SOD and its relation to flow-dependent endothelium-mediated dilation (FMD) and quality of life (exercise capacity and score with Seattle Angina Questionnaire [SAQ]) before and after treatment. After 6 months, patients with SX who received atorvastatin and ramipril had significantly reduced (P=0.001) SOD levels (188.1+/-29.6 U/mL). No significant changes were seen on placebo (262.9+/-48.8 U/mL). Reduction of SOD after therapy was negatively correlated with FMD (r=0.38; P=0.01) and positively with total cholesterol (r=-0.56; P<0.001). At follow-up, patients taking atorvastatin and ramipril improved their quality of life both in terms of exercise duration (by 23.46%) and SAQ (by 64.1%).", 
    "10": "Six months of therapy with atorvastatin and ramipril improves endothelial function and quality of life of patients with SX. Reduced SOD activity may reflect low superoxide anion production. Benefits of these drugs may be related to reduction of oxidative stress.", 
    "11": "Statins were recently shown to possess anti-inflammatory activities, which might be responsible for their favourable effects in cardiovascular or CNS disorders independently from the inhibition of hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl CoA reductase. Here we investigated the effects of the statins lovastatin and mevastatin on prostanoid production in primary cultures of rat cortical microglia and astrocytes. We found that both statins significantly reduce prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) release from microglia, either under basal conditions or after stimulation by interleukin-1beta. Lovastatin also tends to reduce, although not in a significant manner, basal and interleukin-1beta-stimulated PGE2 release from astrocytes. Precursors and intermediates in cholesterol biosynthesis--mevalonic acid and geranyl and farnesyl pyrophosphate--also reduce PGE2 production, and potentiate the inhibitory effects of statins, suggesting that the latter might not depend on the inhibition of hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl CoA reductase.", 
    "12": "Scavenger receptor CD36 plays important roles in atherosclerosis, inflammation, thrombosis, and angiogenesis. Statins besides lowering serum cholesterol levels, exhibit a variety of effects on inflammation, coagulation and atherosclerosis lesion stability. PPAR-gamma ligands influence macrophage responses to many inflammatory stimuli. Herein, we investigated in human monocytes the effect of statins alone, and in combination with PPAR-gamma ligands on CD36 expression, as well as the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulatory action of statins. Our results demonstrate that statins upregulate both CD36 surface protein and mRNA by potentiating the transcription of the CD36 gene. Furthermore, the combination of statins and PPAR-gamma ligands has an additive effect on CD36 expression. Effects of statins on CD36 expression were prevented by mevalonate and geranylgeraniol, indicating the requirement of geranylgeranylated proteins for CD36 regulation. Rho GTPases inhibitor C3 exoenzyme reproduced the effect of statins, while Rho activator lysophosphatidic acid downregulated CD36. Transient expression of dominant-negative mutants of RhoA and RhoB induced a significant increased in CD36 promoter activity. Finally, the actin cytoskeleton disrupter cytochalasin D upregulated CD36. These data indicate that Rho proteins are important modulators of CD36 expression, and strongly suggest that statins increased CD36 expression by disrupting cytoskeleton organization by inactivating Rho GTPases. These features prompt to investigate the roles of Rho GTPases and actin cytoskeleton modulators on monocytic functions affected by statins.", 
    "13": "Statin/fibrate combinations are frequently used to treat mixed dyslipidemia. However, these combinations may cause life-threatening drug interactions (e.g. rhabdomyolysis) possibly induced by modifications of cytochrome P450 isozyme activities. Some statins are also transported by P-glycoprotein (Pgp) and may act as inhibitors of this drug efflux pump. So far, nothing is known about possible Pgp modulating effects of fibrates. We tested whether gemfibrozil, fenofibrate, fenofibric acid, and bezafibrate inhibit Pgp in vitro using a calcein acetoxymethylester (calcein-AM) uptake assay and confocal laser scanning microscopy with bodipy-verapamil as substrate in L-MDR1 cells, which overexpress human Pgp. In uptake assays in cells with (L-MDR1) and without (LLC-PK1) human Pgp we also investigated whether these compounds are transported by Pgp. Intracellular concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Of the tested fibrates, only fenofibrate increased calcein-AM uptake into cells indicating an inhibition of Pgp mediated transport by this compound. The potency of fenofibrate (mean+/-SD: 7.1+/-3.2 microM), evaluated by calculating the concentration needed to double baseline fluorescence (f2), was similar to that of simvastatin (5.8+/-1.5 microM), lovastatin (10.1+/-1.0), and verapamil (4.7+/-0.8 microM). For simvastatin and fenofibrate Pgp inhibition was confirmed with confocal laser scanning microscopy. Fenofibrate, fenofibric acid, gemfibrozil, and bezafibrate showed no difference in the cellular uptake between LLC-PK1 and L-MDR1, indicating that the tested fibrates are not Pgp substrates. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that fenofibrate inhibits Pgp in vitro with a potency similar to simvastatin.", 
    "14": "Alloantigen mismatch and cold ischemia have been shown to induce transplant arteriosclerosis. Pravastatin (PR) decreases arteriosclerosis probably related to an immunosuppressive effect. Statins possess other nonimmune properties that may be beneficial to transplantation. We studied the effect of PR on cold ischemia and alloantigen-induced transplant arteriosclerosis in syngeneic (SYN) and allogeneic (ALLO) aortic transplantation models.", 
    "15": "Lewis rats served as the donors and recipients for SYN transplants and Brown Norway rats were donors for ALLO transplants. Aortic segments that had been preserved at 4 degrees C in Euro-Collins solution for 0 or 24 hours were transplanted to the infrarenal aorta of the recipients PR (10 mg/kg/d) was administered for 12 weeks prior to morphometric studies. Areas of intimal thickness and its relation to total vessel area were calculated. Lipid levels were measured at 12 weeks.", 
    "16": "Aorta rings preserved for 24 hours showed marked intimal thickening compared to controls (SYN, CI 0 hours = 21.5% +/- 16.5% vs SYN, CI 24 hours = 50.7 +/- 9.5%, P <.05). PR significantly decreased thickening (SYN, CI 24 hours + PR = 41.7 +/- 12.2 (P <.05) vs SYN, CI 0 hours on SYN, CI 24 hours). There was a nonsignificant decrease in thickening among ALLO transplants treated with PR (ALLO = 31.4 +/- 15.9 vs ALLO + PR = 23.8 +/- 18.8; P >.05). PR had no effect on lipid levels. PR decreases cold ischemia induced transplant arteriosclerosis in this syngeneic aortic transplant model, but does not affect an alloantigen-mediated process. The beneficial effect of PR is not related to its lipid-lowering properties but probably to a nonimmune effect.", 
    "17": "To test whether genetic variation in the CYP system may influence the statin response, a promoter (A-290G) and 2 nonsynonymous polymorphisms (F189S and M445T) in the CYP3A4 gene locus were examined in 340 hypercholesterolemic patients who were treated with atorvastatin 10 mg. The A-290G variant allele was significantly associated with higher levels of post-treatment low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, whereas the M445T variant was associated with lower levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol before and after treatment.", 
    "18": "We assessed the impact of long-term fluvastatin treatment on adverse atherosclerotic cardiac events (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and revascularization excluding repeat interventions due to restenosis in the first 6 months) in 847 patients (fluvastatin [n = 417] or placebo [n = 430]) with average cholesterol levels treated with stents in the Lescol Intervention Prevention Study (LIPS). During the 4-year follow-up period, fluvastatin significantly decreased total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and decreased the risk of first adverse atherosclerotic cardiac events by 30% compared with placebo (95% confidence interval -49 to -3.4, p = 0.03).", 
    "19": "The effect of 6-week treatment with 80 mg/day atorvastatin on vascular function in the forearm was investigated in 18 patients with mean pretreatment serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations of 112 +/- 4 mg/dl in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study. Statin treatment improved hyperemic forearm blood flow and decreased serum markers of oxidative stress and inflammation.", 
    "20": "The effects of atorvastatin at 20, 40, and 80 mg/day on plasma lipoprotein subspecies were examined in a randomized, placebo-controlled fashion over 36 weeks in 97 patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) with low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels of >130 mg/dl and compared directly with the effects of fluvastatin (n = 28), pravastatin (n = 22), lovastatin (n = 24), and simvastatin (n = 25). The effects of placebo and 40 mg/day of each statin were also examined in subjects with CHD with subjects in the fasting state and in the fed state 4 hours after a meal rich in saturated fat and cholesterol and compared with results in age- and gender-matched control subjects. At all doses tested in the fasting and fed states, atorvastatin was significantly (p <0.01) more effective in lowering LDL cholesterol and non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol than all other statins, and significantly (p <0.05) more effective than all statins, except for simvastatin, in lowering triglyceride and remnant lipoprotein (RLP) cholesterol. At 40 mg/day in the fasting state, atorvastatin was significantly (p <0.01) more effective than all statins, except for lovastatin and simvastatin, in lowering cholesterol levels in small LDL, and was significantly (p <0.05) more effective than all statins, except for simvastatin, in increasing cholesterol in large HDL and in lowering LDL particle numbers. Our data indicate that atorvastatin was the most effective statin tested in lowering cholesterol in LDL, non-HDL, and RLP in the fasting and fed states, and getting patients with CHD to established goals, with fluvastatin, pravastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin having about 33%, 50%, 60%, and 85% of the efficacy of atorvastatin, respectively, at the same dose in the same patients.", 
    "21": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors have been shown to prevent or reverse hypertrophy of the LV in several models of left ventricular hypertrophy. The aim of the present study was to determine whether treatment with simvastatin can prevent hypertension, reduction of tissue nitric oxide synthase activity and left ventricular (LV) remodeling in NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester(L-NAME)-induced hypertension. Four groups of rats were investigated: control, simvastatin (10 mg/kg), L-NAME (40 mg/kg) and L-NAME + simvastatin (in corresponding doses). Animals were sacrificed and studied after 6 weeks of treatment. The decrease of NO-synthase activity in the LV, kidney and brain was associated with hypertension, LV hypertrophy and fibrosis development and remodeling of the aorta in the L-NAME group. Simvastatin attenuated the inhibition of NO-synthase activity in kidney and brain, partly prevented hypertension development and reduced the concentration of coenzyme Q in the LV. Nevertheless, myocardial hypertrophy, fibrosis and enhancement of DNA concentration in the LV, and remodeling of the aorta were not prevented by simultaneous simvastatin treatment in the L-NAME treated animals. We conclude that the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin improved nitric oxide production and partially prevented hypertension development, without preventing remodeling of the left ventricle and aorta in NO-deficient hypertension.", 
    "22": "We have characterized the cDNA for a Rho GTPase activating protein (GAP) mapping to chromosome 13q12. The cDNA was characterized by determining the complete sequence of a 4.8 kb cDNA clone that represents the 5' untranslated region (UTR), the translated region, and the 3' UTR. The protein has a sterile alpha-motif (SAM), a distinct GAP domain, and a conserved START (StAR related lipid transfer) domain. The cDNA has 5 instability motifs (ATTTA) in the 3' UTR and one motif in the translated region between GAP and START domains. The RhoGAP transcript is truncated in some breast carcinoma cell lines and it has low expression in other breast cancer cell lines as compared to a normal breast cell line. We have previously observed the absence of RhoGAP transcript in a breast tumor specimen. A GST-fusion of the RhoGAP was tested for its specificity on RhoA, Cdc42, and Rac1. The protein was most active for RhoA. Transfection of RhoGAP into MCF7 cells significantly inhibited cell growth. The introduction of the RhoGAP construct into MDAMB231 cells that had previously been transfected with a p21 construct did not affect cell proliferation, indicating the involvement of p21 in Rho-mediated proliferation of cancer cells. NIH3T3 cells overexpressing RhoGAP showed considerable inhibition of stress fiber formation. Several cDNAs were identified as RhoGAP interactors by using the yeast two-hybrid assay system. These cDNAs correspond to SWI/SNF, alpha-tubulin, HMG CoA reductase, and TAX1 binding protein (TAX1BP1). The interaction with HMG CoA reductase may partially explain the growth inhibition of breast carcinoma cells by statin class of cholesterol lowering drugs. The biological significance of the interacting proteins is discussed in the context of their involvement in tumorigenesis. Our results indicate that loss of RhoGAP or its altered activity suppresses the growth of breast tumor cells. The presence of various motifs in RhoGAP and its interaction with several other proteins suggest that the protein may regulate Rho signaling in multiple ways and possibly function in a Rho-independent manner.", 
    "23": "A middle-aged man presented with joint pain and muscle weakness that had begun 2 months before presentation. Three months before presentation, he had begun to take the herbal preparation Chinese red rice. Laboratory testing revealed a moderately elevated creatine phosphokinase level. Symptoms and laboratory abnormalities resolved with discontinuation of the Chinese red rice. Eight months later, he resumed the product and his creatine phosphokinase level rose again. Lovastatin is a naturally occurring component of Chinese red rice and was the probable cause of his myopathy.", 
    "24": "Long-and-short term trials with the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) have demonstrated significant reductions in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events in patients with and without preexisting heart disease. Beyond improving the lipid profile, statins have additional effects that may contribute to their overall clinical benefit. Statin treatment appears to reduce global risk profile by affecting both novel and established lipid, inflammatory, and morphologic markers including low-density lipoprotein subclasses, lipoprotein (a), markers of endothelial function, inflammatory mediators, intima-media thickening, and coronary calcification. Although statins may be regarded as a rather homogeneous drug class in terms of biological activity, some agents feature unique properties that have beneficial effects on selected important risk matters.", 
    "25": "Lipid-lowering statins are thought to have a favorable safety profile. Statins inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, the rate-limiting step of mevalonate synthesis. Mevalonate is the substrate for further synthesis of cholesterol and Co Enzyme Q10 (CoQ10). CoQ10 plays an important role during oxidative phosphorylation in the myocardial cell. Since myocardial diastolic function is a highly ATP dependent, we reasoned that early changes of diastolic function may be an early marker of ventricular dysfunction.", 
    "26": "Patients who are to commence on statin therapy will be enrolled in the trial. Baseline measurements of plasma CoQ10, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, CoQ10/LDL ratio, peak E, peak A velocities, E/A ratio, deceleration time, isovolumetric relaxation time, color M-mode propagation velocity will be performed and patients will then begin to take Oral atorvastatin (Lipitor, Parke-Davis) 20 mg daily for three to six months. All baseline measurement will be repeated after 3 to 6 months of statin therapy. Those patients demonstrating > 1 measurement of diastolic LV function that worsened during the 3 to 6 months of statin therapy will be supplemented with CoQ10 300 mg. daily for 3 months. A followup echocardiogram and blood CoQ10 level will be measured in patients who received CoQ10 supplementation.",

    "28": "It has been shown that treating hypercholesterolemic patients (HPC) with statins leads to a decrease, at least in plasma, not only in cholesterol, but also in important non-sterol compounds such as ubiquinone (CoQ10), and possibly dolichols, that derive from the same biosynthetic pathway. Plasma CoQ10 decrease might result in impaired antioxidant protection, therefore leading to oxidative stress. In the present paper we investigated the levels in plasma, lymphocytes and erythrocytes, of ubiquinol and ubiquinone, other enzymatic and non-enzymatic lipophilic and hydrophilic antioxidants, polyunsaturated fatty acids of phosfolipids and cholesterol ester fractions, as well as unsaturated lipid and protein oxidation in 42 hypercholesterolemic patients treated for 3 months. The patients were treated with different doses of 3 different statins, i.e. atorvastatin 10 mg (n = 10) and 20 mg (n = 7), simvastatin, 10 mg (n = 5) and 20 mg (n = 10), and pravastatin, 20 mg (n = 5) and 40 mg (n = 5). Simvastatin, atorvastatin and pravastatin produced a dose dependent plasma depletion of total cholesterol (t-CH), LDL-C, CoQ10H2, and CoQ10, without affecting the CoQ10H2/CoQ10 ratio. The other lipophilic antioxidants (d-RRR-alpha-tocopherol-vit E-, gamma-tocopherol, vit A, lycopene, and beta-carotene), hydrophilic antioxidants (vit C and uric acid), as well as, TBA-RS and protein carbonyls were also unaffected. Similarly the erythrocyte concentrations of GSH and PUFA, and the activities of enzymatic antioxidants (Cu,Zn-SOD, GPx, and CAT) were not significantly different from those of the patients before therapy. In lymphocytes the reduction concerned CoQ10H2, CoQ10, and vit E; other parameters were not investigated. The observed decline of the levels of CoQ10H2 and CoQ10 in plasma and of CoQ10H2, CoQ10 and vit E in lymphocytes following a 3 month statin therapy might lead to a reduced antioxidant capacity of LDL and lymphocytes, and probably of tissues such as liver, that have an elevated HMG-CoA reductase enzymatic activity. However, this reduction did not appear to induce a significant oxidative stress in blood, since the levels of the other antioxidants, the pattern of PUFA as well as the oxidative damage to PUFA and proteins resulted unchanged. The concomitant administration of ubiquinone with statins, leading to its increase in plasma, lymphocytes and liver may cooperate in counteracting the adverse effects of statins, as already pointed out by various authors on the basis of human and animal studies.", 
    "29": "The depletion of the essential nutrient CoQ10 by the increasingly popular cholesterol lowering drugs, HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), has grown from a level of concern to one of alarm. With ever higher statin potencies and dosages, and with a steadily shrinking target LDL cholesterol, the prevalence and severity of CoQ10 deficiency is increasing noticeably. An estimated 36 million Americans are now candidates for statin drug therapy. Statin-induced CoQ10 depletion is well documented in animal and human studies with detrimental cardiac consequences in both animal models and human trials. This drug-induced nutrient deficiency is dose related and more notable in settings of pre-existing CoQ10 deficiency such as in the elderly and in heart failure. Statin-induced CoQ10 deficiency is completely preventable with supplemental CoQ10 with no adverse impact on the cholesterol lowering or anti-inflammatory properties of the statin drugs. We are currently in the midst of a congestive heart failure epidemic in the United States, the cause or causes of which are unclear. As physicians, it is our duty to be absolutely certain that we are not inadvertently doing harm to our patients by creating a wide-spread deficiency of a nutrient critically important for normal heart function.", 
    "30": "Clinical guidelines for cholesterol testing and management have been updated recently. With the evolving recognition of benefits and intensified recommendations for cholesterol management, many more patients will require cholesterol-lowering drugs. All the statins share similar adverse-effect profiles, with a low overall frequency of undesirable effects. Emerging data associate statins with a decreased risk of Alzheimer's disease; however, we report two women who experienced significant cognitive impairment temporally related to statin therapy. One woman took atorvastatin, and the other first took atorvastatin, then was rechallenged with simvastatin. Clinicians should be aware of cognitive impairment and dementia as potential adverse effects associated with statin therapy.", 
    "31": "Four randomized trials with a statin and one trial with a fibrate showed a modest but significant absolute reduction in the incidence of stroke in patients with a previous myocardial infarction. The reasons for the positive effect of statins on stroke end-point are unclear since, paradoxically, the link between serum cholesterol level and stroke has never been fully established. Furthermore, the positive results of statins trials were mainly obtained in patients with an average or a low serum cholesterol level. This suggests nonhypolipidemic effects of these drugs, so-called pleiotropic effects, acting on the biologic promoters of plaque instability. Statins have a good overall safety profile with no increase of hemorrhagic stroke and no increase in cancer. They have positive effects in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in high-risk young as well as elderly populations. Statins reduced stroke incidence in high-risk (mainly CHD, diabetics and hypertensives) population even with a normal baseline blood cholesterol level, which argues for a global cardiovascular risk-based treatment strategy. In patients with prior strokes, statins likely reduce the incidence of cononary events, but it is not yet proven that statins actually reduce the incidence of recurrent strokes in secondary prevention. If current hypotheses are verified by ongoing trials, we may expect between 20 to 30 more stroke events avoided per 1,000 patients treated during 2 years with a lipid-lowering agent, which adds to the 28 stroke events prevented with an antiplatelet agent over the same time period. This would be one of the most significant advances in stroke and vascular dementia prevention since the era of aspirin therapy.", 
    "32": "Dyslipidemia and non-traditional cardiovascular (CV) risk factors, such as lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)), homocysteine, oxidative stress and inflammation, are important determinants in the increased CV risk of hemodialysis (HD) patients. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effects of atorvastatin on these parameters in one of the groups with the highest CV risk: diabetic patients with end-stage renal disease under HD therapy.", 
    "33": "Twenty maintenance HD diabetic patients (mean age 64 +/- 10 years, mean time on HD 25 +/- 11 months) with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) >2.59 mmol/l received atorvastatin (10 mg/day) for 4 months. Lipid profile, including total cholesterol (TC), LDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TG), apolipoproteins A1 and B (Apo-A and Apo-B), and the non-traditional risk factors Lp(a), homocysteine, autoantibodies against oxidized LDL-C (anti-LDLox), total antioxidant status (TAS), and high sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), were measured at baseline and at the end of the study. Safety was assessed by clinical and laboratory (liver and muscle enzymes) monitoring once a month.",

No significant changes were observed in HDL-C. Concerning the non-traditional risk factors, levels of homocysteine, Lp(a), anti-LDLox and TAS did not change significantly. However, hs-CRP decreased from 5.4 (range 0.9-67.8) to 2.3 mg/l (range 0.4-21) (p < 0.01), whereas a concomitant increase in serum albumin was observed (from 38 +/- 2 to 40 +/- 1.7 g/l, p < 0.01). At baseline, hs-CRP was inversely associated with HDL-C and Apo-A, and directly related to Lp(a). The change in hs-CRP was inversely associated with the change of HDL-C, whereas a direct correlation was found with the change of TG.",

It considers the characteristics and incidence of dyslipidaemia among specific patient types and describes the available data concerning the ability of statin therapy to regulate dyslipidaemia in the renal disease population as well as early results for an anti-inflammatory effect in this group. The clinical impact of statins in terms of reduced morbidity and mortality is also discussed. The relative merits of different statin agents are reviewed in terms of efficacy and safety, together with the role of aggressive intervention as compared with standard approaches to care. Finally, a proposed algorithm for the initiation and monitoring of statin therapy in chronic renal disease patients is presented.", 
    "37": "Whereas the anti-inflammatory properties of statins have been extensively studied, less attention has been devoted to the antithrombogenic effects of these drugs. We evaluated the effect of short-term (18 h) treatment with pravastatin (1 mg/kg) on hypercholesterolemia-induced platelet-endothelial (P/E) cell adhesion in intestinal venules. Mice were placed on either a normal diet (ND) or cholesterol-enriched diet (HCD) for 2 wk. Wild-type mice fed a HCD exhibited significantly elevated blood serum cholesterol levels, which were unaltered by pravastatin treatment. ND or HCD platelets were isolated, fluorescently labeled, and administered to either ND or HCD recipients. Intravital videomicroscopy was used to quantify transient (saltation) and firm adhesion of platelets. HCD mice receiving platelets from either ND or HCD mice exhibited increased P/E cell interactions compared with ND mice receiving platelets from ND or HCD mice. P/E adhesion was dramatically reduced when platelets from donor mice, recipient mice, or both were treated with pravastatin. The protective effect of pravastatin in hypercholesterolemia-induced P/E cell adhesion was abolished in N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester-treated mice. These results indicate that 1). hypercholesterolemia-induced P/E cell adhesion is mediated by changes in the vascular wall rather than circulating platelets; 2). pravastatin treatment inhibits the prothrombogenic effects of hypercholesterolemia via an action on both endothelial cells and platelets; and 3). the protective effect of pravastatin is nitric oxide dependent.",

Compliance with therapy was high (range, 85%-92%), and upward titration of therapy was found in only 160 members (2.6%). Multiple regression analysis indicated that receiving statin therapy compared with other lipid-lowering therapy was a significant predictor of percentage reduction in LDL-C (P < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis indicated that compared with high-efficacy statin regimens, low-efficacy statin regimens (odds ratio [OR] = 0.619; 95% CI, 0.436-0.877) and low-efficacy regimens from other therapeutic classes (OR = 0.171; 95% CI, 0.099-0.295) were less effective in lowering LDL-C by >or=10%.

At C(max), rosuvastatin accounted for approximately 50% of the circulating radioactive material. Approximately 90% of the rosuvastatin dose was recovered in feces, with the remainder recovered in urine. The majority of the dose (approximately 70%) was recovered within 72 hours after dosing; excretion was complete by 10 days after dosing. Metabolite profiles in feces indicated that rosuvastatin was excreted largely unchanged (76.8% of the dose). Two metabolites-rosuvastatin-5S-lactone and N-desmethyl rosuvastatin-were present in excreta. [14C]-rosuvastatin was well tolerated; 2 volunteers reported 4 mild adverse events that resolved without treatment.",

Testing for heterogeneity was applied and on the basis of these results a fixed effect model or a random effect model was used for calculation of relative risk values (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Sensitivity analysis tested the impact of the individual study--duration of study, type of statin therapy and study size. The number of patients needed to treat was calculated as an absolute measure of clinical effectiveness of statin therapy when appropriate.", 
    "59": "Data from 15 trials with 63,410 participants and mean duration of treatment of 3.6 years, were included in this overview. Tests for heterogeneity showed that the variability between study estimates is sufficiently small to assume that they are estimating the same underlying treatment effect. Statin therapy was associated with a 22% reduction in total cholesterol, 29% reduction in LDL cholesterol, 12% reduction in triglycerides and 6% increase in HDL cholesterol. Overall (primary and secondary studies) statin therapy significantly reduces relative risk of coronary events (RR, 0.73, 95% CI, 0.68, 0.77, *p < 0.0001), relative risk of cardiovascular disease mortality (RR, 0.78, 95% CI, 0.73, 0.84, *p < 0.0001), relative risk of non-fatal stroke (RR, 0.74, 95% CI, 0.67, 0.82, *p < 0.0001), relative risk of total (fatal and non-fatal) stroke (RR, 0.77, 95% CI, 0.70, 0.84, *p < 0.001) and relative risk of all-cause death (RR, 0.85, 95% CI, 0.81, 0.89, *p < 0.0001). There was a slight and insignificant reduction of relative risk in non-cardiovascular mortality (RR, 0.94, 95% CI, 0.86, 1.03, p = 0.1677) and fatal strokes (RR, 0.86, 95% CI, 0.70, 1.07, p = 0.1912). Sensitivity analysis showed the robustness of our results for all outcomes. The results were not altered if an individual study was removed from meta-analysis.",

    "61": "Atherosclerosis may be considered an inflammatory disease characterised by the development of atherosclerotic plaques and ischaemic cardiovascular events. Increased prevalence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality due to (premature) atherosclerosis has been observed in patients with autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Wegener's granolumatosis. This increased prevalence cannot be explained by the presence of the traditional cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus and smoking. Therefore, other risk factors must be present in patients with systemic autoimmune disease. Although the mechanisms have not been fully unravelled, endothelial cell (EC) activation through autoantibodies seems to be one of the factors involved. EC activation results in EC dysfunction. It is supposed that chronic EC dysfunction, as present in patients with systemic autoimmune disorders, contributes to the development of premature atherosclerosis and results in an increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease.",

Membrane Na+, K(+)-ATPase activity, serum magnesium, and ubiquinone were decreased while hydroxy methyl glutaryl CoA (HMG) coenzyme A (CoA) reductase activity, serum digoxin, and dolichol levels were increased in trisomy 21. There were increased levels of tryptophan catabolites--nicotine, strychnine, quinolinic acid, and serotonin--and decreased levels of tyrosine catabolites--dopamine, noradrenaline, and morphine in trisomy 21. There was an increase in dolichol levels, carbohydrate residues of glycoproteins, glycolipids, total/individual glycosaminoglycan (GAG) fractions, and lysosomal enzymes in trisomy 21. Reduced levels of ubiquinone, reduced glutathione, and free radical scavenging enzymes as well as increased lipid peroxidation products and nitric oxide were noticed in trisomy 21.

So far, the precise sequence of these events and their role in lesion formation and disease progression remain unknown. Here we provide quantitative evidence that blood-brain barrier leakage is an early event and precedes massive cellular infiltration in the development of acute experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), the animal correlate of multiple sclerosis. Cerebrovascular leakage and monocytes infiltrates were separately monitored by quantitative in vivo MRI during the course of the disease. Magnetic resonance enhancement of the contrast agent gadolinium diethylenetriaminepentaacetate (Gd-DTPA), reflecting vascular leakage, occurred concomitantly with the onset of neurological signs and was already at a maximal level at this stage of the disease. Immunohistochemical analysis also confirmed the presence of the serum-derived proteins such as fibrinogen around the brain vessels early in the disease, whereas no cellular infiltrates could be detected. MRI further demonstrated that Gd-DTPA leakage clearly preceded monocyte infiltration as imaged by the contrast agent based on ultra small particles of iron oxide (USPIO), which was maximal only during full-blown EAE. Ultrastructural and immunohistochemical investigation revealed that USPIOs were present in newly infiltrated macrophages within the inflammatory lesions. To validate the use of USPIOs as a non-invasive tool to evaluate therapeutic strategies, EAE animals were treated with the immunomodulator 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl Coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, lovastatin, which ameliorated clinical scores. MRI showed that the USPIO load in the brain was significantly diminished in lovastatin-treated animals. Data indicate that cerebrovascular leakage and monocytic trafficking into the brain are two distinct processes in the development of inflammatory lesions during multiple sclerosis, which can be monitored on-line with MRI using USPIOs and Gd-DTPA as contrast agents. These studies also implicate that USPIOs are a valuable tool to visualize monocyte infiltration in vivo and quantitatively assess the efficacy of new therapeutics like lovastatin.",

    "91": "In the Statin Therapies for Elevated Lipid Levels compared Across doses to Rosuvastatin (STELLAR) trial, the efficacy of rosuvastatin calcium (Crestor) was compared with that of atorvastatin (Lipitor), simvastatin (Zocor), and pravastatin (Pravachol) for lowering plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) after 6 weeks of treatment. In this multicenter, parallel-group, open-label trial, adults with hypercholesterolemia were randomized to treatments with rosuvastatin 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg, atorvastatin 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg, simvastatin 10, 20, 40, or 80 mg, or pravastatin 10, 20, or 40 mg. Efficacy and safety results from this trial have been previously published. The additional analyses included in this report show that 53% (83/156) to 80% (125/157) of patients in the rosuvastatin 10- to 40-mg groups achieved LDL-C levels < 100 mg/dl (< 2.6 mmol/l), compared with 18% (28/158) to 70% (115/165) of patients who received atorvastatin, 8% (13/165) to 53% (86/163) of patients who received simvastatin, and 1% (1/160) to 8% (13/161) of patients who received pravastatin. Other additional analyses showed that more patients in the rosuvastatin 10- to 40-mg groups than in the comparator groups who were at high risk of coronary heart disease according to National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III, Joint European Societies, or Canadian guidelines achieved the LDL-C goals of < 100 mg/dl (< 2.6 mmol/l) (55% to 77% compared with 0 to 64%), < 3.0 mmol/l (< 116 mg/dl) (76% to 94% compared with 6% to 81%), and < 2.5 mmol/l (< 97 mg/dl) (47% to 69% compared with 0 to 53%), respectively. Results favoring rosuvastatin versus the comparators were also reported for patients: (a) who had triglycerides > or = 200mg/dl (> or = 2.3 mmol/l), and achieved both ATP III LDL-C and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) goals (80% to 84% versus 15% to 84%); (b) overall who achieved the Canadian LDL-C goals of < 2.5 (< 97 mg/dl) to < 5.0 mmol/l (< 193 mg/dl) (85% to 91% versus 44% to 86%); and (c) who achieved all 3 Canadian goals for LDL-C, triglycerides (< 3.0 mmol/l [< 266 mg/dl] to < 2.0 mmol/l [< 177 mg/dl]), and the total cholesterol/high-density lipoproteincholesterol ratio (< 4 to < 7) (70% to 83% versus 35% to 79%).", 
    "92": "Statins are central to the government's National Service Framework (NSF) for coronary heart disease (CHD). NHS spending on statins is currently about pounds sterling 500 million per annum and rising at an annual rate of 30%. Although generally considered to be a cost-effective treatment for hyperlipidaemia and cardiovascular disease, given the high and rising expenditure on statins in the UK, there is a pressing need to ensure that the choice between available statins reflects cost-effectiveness considerations. A decision model was developed to establish the cost-effectiveness of treating new hypercholesterolaemic patients to UK and European target levels of blood total cholesterol (TC) and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), using rosuvastatin, atorvastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin or fluvastatin. The model was used to estimate the proportion of patients reaching target and the associated costs over a one-year period from the perspective of the NHS. The effectiveness of the alternative statins were modelled using data from the Statin Therapies for Elevated Lipid Levels compared Across doses to Rosuvastatin (STELLAR) trial. Monte Carlo simulation was used to reflect uncertainty in the parameter estimates applied in the model. Rosuvastatin is demonstrated to dominate (i.e. lower costs and a higher number of patients treated to target) atorvastatin, simvastatin and pravastatin. Compared with fluvastatin, the incremental cost per additional patient to target (PTT) for rosuvastatin was pounds sterling 24 using LDL-C and pounds sterling 83 using TC. The probability that rosuvastatin is cost-effective exceeds 95%, provided the NHS is prepared to pay at least pounds sterling 35 per PTT to achieve target LDL-C cholesterol levels (pounds sterling 160 for TC). The analysis demonstrates rosuvastatin is more cost-effective than the other statins in achieving UK and European cholesterol targets.", 
    "93": "Under hypergravity conditions, the cell wall of stem organs becomes mechanically rigid and elongation growth is suppressed, which can be recognized as the mechanism for plants to resist gravitational force. The changes in gene expression by hypergravity treatment were analyzed in Arabidopsis hypocotyls by the differential display method, for identifying genes involved in hypergravity-induced growth suppression. Sixty-two cDNA clones were expressed differentially between the control and 300 g conditions: the expression levels of 39 clones increased, whereas those of 23 clones decreased under hypergravity conditions. Sequence analysis and database searching revealed that 12 clones, 9 up-regulated and 3 down-regulated, have homology to known proteins. The expression of these genes was further analyzed using RT-PCR. Finally, six genes were confirmed to be up-regulated by hypergravity. One of such genes encoded 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A reductase (HMGR), which catalyzes a reaction producing mevalonic acid, a key precursor of terpenoids such as membrane sterols and several types of hormones. The expression of HMGR gene increased within several hours after hypergravity treatment. Also, compactin, an inhibitor of HMGR, prevented hypergravity-induced growth suppression, suggesting that HMGR is involved in suppression of Arabidopsis hypocotyl growth by hypergravity. In addition, hypergravity increased the expression levels of genes encoding CCR1 and ERD15, which were shown to take part in the signaling pathway of environmental stimuli such as temperature and water, and those of the alpha-tubulin gene. These genes may be involved in a series of cellular events leading to growth suppression of stem organs under hypergravity conditions.", 
    "94": "Human endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) can differentiate into cardiomyogenic cells in vitro. We tested the effects of statin therapy on the differentiation rate of EPCs from patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), who may benefit from autologous cell therapy.EPCs from 3 age-matched groups were tested: No CAD (n = 13), CAD patients with (n = 10) or without (n = 16) statin therapy. From 4 CAD patients, EPCs were tested before and after 4 weeks of therapy with 20 mg atorvastatin. After 6 days of co-culture with rat neonatal cardiomyocytes, EPC differentiation was quantified by immunostaining for alpha-sarcomeric actinin flow cytometry analysis. After 6 days of co-culture, the percentage of -sarcomeric actinin-positive EPCs was significantly (p = 0.014) higher in EPCs from adults without CAD (8.07% +/- 1.48% of EPCs) compared to EPCs from CAD patients without statin (3.56% +/- 0.72%). Importantly, patients with statin therapy revealed significantly higher numbers of alpha-sarcomeric actinin-positive EPCs (6.36% +/- 0.69%, p = 0.01) compared to CAD patients without statin. In addition, statin therapy resulted in a significant (p = 0.017) increase of EPC differentiation in all 4 CAD patients investigated before and 4 weeks after statin therapy. The survival of EPCs did not differ between the different groups suggesting that the regulation of EPC differentiation is not secondary to altered EPC survival. In vitro, EPC treatment with 0.1 micro M atorvastatin did not affect EPC differentiation (116.15% +/- 49.11% of control).EPCs from patients with CAD display impaired differentiation into cardiomyogenic cells. This defect can be improved by in vivo, statin therapy.", 
    "95": "An efficient synthesis of N3,4-diphenyl-5-(4-fluorophenyl)-2-isopropyl-1H-3-pyrrolecarboxamide, a key intermediate for the synthesis of an effective HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor atorvastatin, is described. The synthesis is based on the 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reaction of mesoionic munchnone (1,3-oxazolium-5-olate) with N1,3-diphenyl-2-propynamide leading to N-benzyl pyrrole, and N-debenzylation using sodium in liquid ammonia as key steps.", 
    "96": "An in vitro study was carried out in order to examine the metabolic basis of the interaction between fibrates and statins. Metabolic inhibition of statins was noted in the presence of gemfibrozil. However, increase in the unchanged form was fairly small for pitavastatin, compared with other statins. Several CYP enzymes were shown to be principally responsible for the metabolism of gemfibrozil in contrast to other fibrates. In the presence of gemfibrozil, a focal point was obtained in Dixon plots, demonstrating that there was inhibition of CYP2C8-, CYP2C9- and CYP3A4-mediated metabolism. We propose that the increase of plasma concentration caused by co-administration of gemfibrozil and statins is at least partially due to CYP-mediated inhibition.", 
    "97": "Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are widely used to inhibit biosynthesis of cholesterol in individuals with elevated serum levels of this risk factor for cardiovascular disease. We find that statins are toxic to human lymphocytes in cell culture at concentrations less than 0.1 microg/ml. Addition of their own plasma reverses this toxicity in some, but not all, individuals. Addition of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) with plasma is more effective than plasma alone in reversing toxicity in some individuals. Apparently, two factors are required to reverse the cellular toxicity of statins: CoQ10 and a plasma factor found in a subset of individuals. These observations may provide the basis for a method to assess individual susceptibility to statin toxicity and to predict which individuals may benefit from supplements of CoQ10.", 
    "98": "Hypertension and hyperlipidemia are potent cardiovascular risk factors. Treatment can lower blood pressure and reduce events, but the optimal drug for initial hypertension treatment and the benefits of long-term cholesterol reduction on clinical outcomes in understudied hypertensive subpopulations were unknown. The Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) was a long-term randomized, multicenter study undertaken to address these questions. In the hypertension component, 42,448 patients with mild-moderate hypertension and 1 or more other coronary risk factors were randomized to initial therapy with chlorthalidone, or to a newer antihypertensive agent--doxazosin (alpha blocker), amlodipine (calcium blocker), or lisinopril (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor). The primary combined endpoint was coronary heart disease mortality or nonfatal myocardial infarction, with secondary endpoints including combinations of mortality, cardiac, and vascular complications. By interim analysis, doxazosin was shown inferior to diuretics in preventing secondary endpoints, resulting in early termination of this arm. There were no differences in primary endpoint frequency in chlorthalidone-amlodipine and chlorthalidone-lisinopril comparisons, but both amlodipine and lisinopril therapy resulted in more secondary events. In the lipid-lowering trial, 10,355 patients enrolled in the hypertensive trial with low-density-lipoprotein levels 100 to 189 mg/dL were randomized to pravastatin or usual care. There was no overall difference in the primary endpoint (total mortality) or most secondary endpoints, with statin therapy reducing stroke and coronary events modestly but nonsignificantly. Subgroup comparisons showed equivalent treatment effects in all groups except blacks, who had greater reduction in total coronary events but more strokes with pravastatin therapy and more strokes with lisinopril treatment.", 
    "99": "Dyslipidemia is one of the major cardiovascular risk factors especially for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. As a feature of the metabolic syndrome insulin resistance is also associated with an atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype. In type 1 diabetes inadequate glycemic control results in an increase of plasma triglyceride levels. The treatment of diabetic dyslipidemia is based on an improvement of glycemic control, in type 1 and type 2 diabetes, as well as in lifestyle recommendations, including dietary advice and physical exercise. The achievement of strict target levels, especially LDL-cholesterol values below 100 mg/dL, requires lipid lowering drug therapy. This LDL-cholesterol target level is based on the fact that diabetic patients reveal the same risk for myocardial infarction as non-diabetics after their first cardiovascular event. Thus the diagnosis of diabetes is regarded as an equivalent for manifest cardiovascular disease. The re-evaluation of large lipid intervention trials (4 S, CARE, LIPID, VA-HIT, Heart Protection Study) could clearly demonstrate also for the diabetic subpopulation that statin and fibrate therapy results in a significant reduction of the cardiovascular risk.",

Ten patients had a history of diabetes. Serological markers for viral hepatitis were negative in all patients and there was no history of alcohol or drug abuse. Patients who had autoimmune hepatitis were excluded from the study. Liver biopsy was performed before therapy to confirm the diagnosis. Among NASH patients, 17 normolipidemic cases received UDCA 13 to 15 mg/kg/day (group 1), while hyperlipidemic cases (n=27) received atorvastatin 10 mg/day (group 2) for six months. The BMI, serum lipids, liver function tests and liver density, assessed by computerized tomography, were evaluated before and after the treatment period. The BMI, serum aminotransferase levels, histological parameters (steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis scores) and liver densities were not statistically different between the groups at the beginning of therapy.",

In group 1, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and gamma-glutamyl-transferase (GGT) levels reduced significantly, and in group 2, serum cholesterol, aspartate aminotransferase, ALT, alkaline phosphatase and GGT levels reduced significantly. Liver densities increased only in group 2, probably as a result of diminishing fat content of liver. The normalization of transaminases was also more prevalent in group 2. Liver steatosis was closely correlated with liver density, but inflammation and fibrosis were not.",

    "104": "More than a decade has passed since it was unintentionally discovered that grapefruit juice interacts with certain drugs. The coadministration of these drugs with grapefruit juice can markedly elevate drug bioavailability, and can alter pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters of the drug. The predominant mechanism for this interaction is the inhibition of cytochrome P-450 3A4 in the small intestine, resulting in a significant reduction of drug presystemic metabolism. An additional mechanism is, presumably, the inhibition of P-glycoprotein, a transporter that carries drug from the enterocyte back to the gut lumen, resulting in a further increase in the fraction of drug absorbed. Some calcium channel antagonists, benzodiazepines, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors and cyclosporine are the most affected drugs. A single exposure to one glass of the juice can usually produce the maximal magnitude of the interaction. The data available so far, concerning this interaction and its clinical implications, are reviewed in this article. It is likely that more information regarding this interaction will accumulate in the future, and awareness of such is necessary for achieving optimal drug therapy.",

Treatment of the dyslipidemia associated with these disorders should focus on correcting the abnormal lipoprotein levels as well as LDL and HDL heterogeneity. Statins and fibrates are useful for treating elevated LDL in patients with and without diabetes or the metabolic syndrome. In addition, thiazolidinediones or niacin in combination with a statin show promise for correcting defects in LDL and HDL heterogeneity. The ultimate goal of treatment in this patient population is to prevent the development and progression of coronary artery disease.", 
    "106": "The objective of this study was to evaluate the cardiac toxicity of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors by testing the hypothesis that lovastatin induces apoptotic and/or oncotic cell death in the myocyte element of the heart and further that cell death is mediated through interruption of the mevalonate pathway and that apoptosis is induced through activation of caspase-2 and caspase-3. Cardiomyocytes were cultured from embryonic chick heart. Lovastatin-induced apoptosis in these cells was demonstrated by three independent techniques, namely (1) FACS analysis of low DNA content by propidium iodide (PI); (2) microscopic assessment for cellular changes of apoptosis; and (3) FACS analysis of cells stained with PI and fluorescein diacetate. Lovastatin produced a concentration-dependent increase in apoptotic cell death and 100 microM lovastatin showed over a 4-fold increase in apoptosis compared to control. Lovastatin also induced oncotic cell death, as there was a 2.5-fold increase in the amount of oncotic cell death compared to control. Lovastatin-induced apoptosis operated, in part, through the mevalonate pathway. The caspase-2 inhibitor z-VDVAD-fmk and the caspase-3 inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO reduced the extent of lovastatin-induced cardiac apoptosis. In contrast, lovastatin-induced oncosis was not only insensitive to these caspase-2 or -3 inhibitors but occurred through a mevalonate-independent mechanism of action. In summary, lovastatin-induced cardiotoxicity is complex and represents the sum of two distinct modes of cell death operating in part through the mevalonate pathway with the apoptotic component subject to modification by inhibitors of the initiator caspase, caspase-2, as well as the effector caspase, caspase-3.",

Our results confirm the under-representation of women and elderly patients in premarketing clinical trials, e.g. an M : F ratio of 4.6 in clinical trails of simvastatin vs 1.0 in the joint population.

At 10 micro mol/L, HR780 significantly (P = 0.010) inhibited X/XO-induced EC injury. 3. HR780 dose-dependently inhibited PDGF-induced SMC migration and FCS-induced SMC proliferation. The addition of mevalonate completely abolished the inhibitory effect of HR780 on SMC proliferation. Another HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, simvastatin (0.1-100 micro mol/L), also inhibited the migration and proliferation responses as potently as HR780. In contrast, pravastatin (0.1-100 micro mol/L) did not show any effects. 4.

The Km value of CMPF uptake by kidney slices (22 micromol/L) was comparable with that of rOat3, while the corresponding values of IA and HA (42 and 33 micromol/L, respectively) were similar to those of rOat1. PAH preferentially inhibited the uptake of IA and HA by kidney slices, while pravastatin and benzylpenicillin preferentially inhibited the uptake of CMPF. The effect of these inhibitors on the uptake of IS by kidney slices was partial.", 
    "131": "rOat1/hOAT1 and rOat3/hOAT3 play major roles in the renal uptake of uremic toxins on the basolateral membrane of the proximal tubules. Both OAT1 and OAT3 contribute almost equally to the renal uptake of IS. OAT3 mainly accounts for CMPF uptake by the kidney, while OAT1 mainly accounts for IA and HA uptake.", 
    "132": "To evaluate the effects of simvastatin only or combined with continuous transdermal hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on the serum lipid profile in hypercholesterolaemic women.", 
    "133": "The study population consisted of 75 women after menopause, ranging in age from 45 to 62. The patients were divided into five groups: group I--women receiving HRT (Systen Sequi, Cilag); group II--HRT + statin (Systen Sequi, Cilag + Zocor, MSD); group III--HRT (Systen Conti, Cilag); group IV--HRT + statin (Systen Conti, Cilag + Zocor, MSD) and group V--statin only (Zocor, MSD). Before and after 3 and 6 months therapy serum total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) and LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) was measured.", 
    "134": "The combination of simvastatin + HRT or simvastatin only decreased significantly TC and LDL-C, and increased HDL-C levels at 3 months (groups II, IV and V). A comparative analysis revealed that HRT effect on TC, LDL-C and HDL-C was significantly observed after 6 months (group I and III). TG levels significantly decreased after 6 months of therapy (simvastatin + HRT) in groups II and IV.", 
    "135": "The combination of simvastatin and HRT seems to be more effective than simvastatin only in the treatment of hypercholesterolaemia in women.", 
    "136": "3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase is a key rate-limiting enzyme in the mevalonate pathway, which generates precursors both for cholesterol biosynthesis and for the production of nonsteroidal mevalonate derivatives that are involved in a number of growth-regulatory processes. We have reported that lovastatin, a competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, not only inhibits medulloblastoma proliferation in vitro, but also induces near-complete cell death via apoptosis. The mechanism of this phenomenon is unclear. Possible involvement of changes in expression of certain cell-cycle related genes led us to study some of them in more detail.", 
    "137": "Medulloblastoma cell lines were exposed in vitro to lovastatin, and the effects of gene expression changes were studied using RT-PCR, antisense oligonucleotide, DNA electrophoresis and Western blotting analysis.", 
    "138": "1) Levels of total Ras gene mRNA and individual Ras gene mRNA are stable in lovastatin treatment in all examined medulloblastoma cell lines. 2) Blocking c-myc gene over-expression does not enhance medulloblastoma cell sensitivity to lovastatin. 3) Following lovastatin treatment, p16 expression exhibits no change, but pronounced increases of p27KIP1 protein are observed in all examined cell lines. Lovastatin induces pronounced increases of p21WAF1 protein only in Daoy and UW228, but not in D283 Med and D341 Med. 4) Following lovastatin treatment, increased p53 protein is detected only in D341 Med, and bax protein is unchanged in all cell lines.", 
    "139": "Lovastatin-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in medulloblastoma are not dependent on the regulation of Ras and c-myc gene expression, but may be mediated by p27KIP1 gene expression. Lovastatin-induced apoptosis in medulloblastoma is probably p53 independent, but p53 and p21WAF1 gene expression may also mediate anti-proliferative effects of lovastatin on specific medulloblastoma cell lines.", 
    "140": "In Belgium, regulations restrict the reimbursement of statins to patients with total serum cholesterol above 250 mg/dl (6.41 mmol/l) after a three-month lipid-lowering diet. We investigated the possible impact of these regulations on characteristics of Belgian patients receiving a lipid-lowering drug.", 
    "141": "From 1998 to 2000, standard questionnaires on coronary risk factors and treatments with lipid-lowering drugs were completed by 301 GPs sampled at random in the 11 Belgian Provinces. Questionnaires had to be completed for 18 consecutive patients 35 years old or more attending GPs' practices, irrespective of the underlying motive for attendance.", 
    "142": "Of the 5511 patients included in the study, 1519 (28%) had established coronary disease or diabetes mellitus, or > or = 2 non-cholesterol coronary risk factors. Most (70%) of these patients were not treated with a lipid-lowering drug. Only 22% of patients with established coronary disease, 10% of patients with diabetes mellitus and 9% of patients with > or = 2 coronary risk factors were treated with a statin. Fifty-nine percent of fibrate users and 50% of statin users had a pre-treatment cholesterol level above 250 mg/dl, but had no or only one non-cholesterol coronary risk factor.", 
    "143": "In Belgium, the majority of patients at higher risk of coronary event do not benefit from lipid-lowering drugs, particularly the statins. In contrast, one of two statin users and three of five fibrate users should probably not receive the drug prescribed. Regulation based on blood cholesterol level encourages the overlooking of other risk factors relevant for selecting patients having the greatest chance to benefit from statin treatment.", 
    "144": "Measurement of intima-media thickness (IMT) is a well established surrogate marker for cardiovascular endpoints. We studied the long-term effects of statins on femoral IMT and plaque scoring in the Atorvastatin versus Simvastatin on Atherosclerosis Progression (ASAP) study.", 
    "145": "Three hundred and twenty-five patients with familial hypercholesterolaemia were randomized to either atorvastatin 80 mg/day or simvastatin 40 mg/day. IMT was measured at baseline and at 2 years. At baseline, femoral IMT was 1.69 mm in the atorvastatin group and 1.61 mm in the simvastatin group; at 2 years, IMT increased by 0.06 mm (P=0.24) and 0.15 mm (P=0.012), respectively. No significant differences were obvious between these two treatment arms (P=0.26). Femoral plaques were present in 64.7% in the atorvastatin group and 56.1% in the simvastatin group at baseline; after 2 years, these proportions rose to 66.0% (P=0.47) and 67.3% (P=0.02), respectively (P=0.87 between treatment arms). Carotid plaques were present in 6.3% versus 4.9%; after 2 years, these percentages were 5.0% (P=0.48) versus 5.5% (P=0.71), respectively (P=0.90 between treatment arms).", 
    "146": "Our study indicates increased efficacy of atorvastatin 80 mg in retarding progression of atherosclerosis in the femoral artery compared with simvastatin 40 mg. Interestingly, in the carotid arteries these statins influenced IMT to a greater extent, whereas in the femoral artery the effects were more pronounced on plaque frequency. These findings underscore the generalized effects of lipid lowering on atherosclerosis.", 
    "147": "Osteopontin is upregulated in the diabetic vascular wall and in vascular smooth muscle cells cultured under high glucose concentration. In the present study, we analyzed the mechanism of high glucose-induced upregulation of osteopontin in cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells.", 
    "148": "We found that an inhibitor of Rho-associated protein kinase, Y-27632, suppressed osteopontin mRNA expression under high glucose concentration. Transfection of cells with a constitutive active Rho mutant, pSRalpha-myc-RhoDA, enhanced osteopontin mRNA expression. Furthermore, incubation of cells under high glucose concentration activated Rho, indicating that Rho/Rho kinase pathway mediates high-glucose-stimulated osteopontin expression. Treatment of cells with an inhibitor of protein kinase C, GF109203X, and azaserine, an inhibitor of the hexosamine pathway, suppressed high glucose-induced Rho activation. Glucosamine treatment was shown to activate Rho. Treatment of cells with an inhibitor of MEK1, PD98059, suppressed osteopontin mRNA expression under high glucose concentration. Incubation of cells under high glucose concentration activated ERK. Finally, transfection of cells with pSRalpha-myc-RhoDA also activated ERK.", 
    "149": "In conclusion, our present findings support a notion that Rho/Rho kinase pathway functions downstream of protein kinase C and the hexosamine pathways and upstream of ERK in mediating high-glucose-induced upregulation of osteopontin expression.", 
    "150": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most frequent malignancies worldwide. A variety of pharmacological strategies has been evaluated in the treatment of HCC: classical chemotherapy, tamoxifen, octreotide, thymostimulin, pravastatin, (131)I-lipiodol as well as transarterial chemoperfusion (TAC) and chemoembolisation (TACE). TACE monotherapy or TACE combined with pravastatin resulted in a survival benefit of selected HCC patients. New strategies such as immunotherapy, antiangiogenic agents or cyclooxygenase inhibitors are under clinical investigation and might play a role in future therapies for HCC. Efficient strategies for the primary prevention of HCC are available and promising concepts in the secondary prevention have been reported.", 
    "151": "Diabetes, a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States, is associated with a 2- to 4-fold increase in the risk of coronary artery disease. As the population in the United States has aged, the incidence of obesity, hypertension, glucose intolerance, and dyslipidemia has increased significantly, culminating in the current epidemic of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Strict glycemic control must, therefore, be accompanied with proven therapies (such as antihypertensives and lipid-lowering agents) to reduce cardiovascular events. Patients with type 2 diabetes have average low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels but have an increased number of small, dense LDL particles, which are associated with a 3-fold increase in cardiovascular disease. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is also associated with increased triglyceride rich atherogenic particles, which trigger inflammation. In addition to glycemic control and drug therapy, lifestyle modifications (eg, diet, weight loss, and exercise) also play an important role in managing diabetes. Therefore, strict glycemic control, pharmacologic therapy, and lifestyle modifications are parts of a comprehensive strategy to prevent both microvascular and macrovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes.", 
    "152": "The authors investigated the effect of pravastatin and fluvastatin on paraoxonase 1 (PON1) activity in plasma, liver, heart, and kidney, as well as on plasma platelet activating factor acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) in the rat. The animals received pravastatin at doses of 4 and 40 mg/kg/d or fluvastatin at doses of 2 or 20 mg/kg/d for 3 weeks. Fluvastatin (20 mg/kg/d) reduced plasma PON1 activity toward paraoxon and phenyl acetate by 23.6% and 17.4%, respectively. The lower dose of this drug as well as both doses of pravastatin had no effect on plasma PON1. PON1 activity toward paraoxon in the liver of rats treated with 20 mg/kg/d fluvastatin was 27.5% lower than in the control group, and the activity toward phenyl acetate was reduced by 25.4% and 35.9% in rats receiving 2 and 20 mg/kg/d of this drug, respectively. Fluvastatin at 2 and 20 mg/kg/d also decreased cardiac PON1 by 31.3% and 27.3%, respectively. Both statins reduced PON1 activity in the renal cortex and medulla. Statins had no effect on plasma PAF-AH. It is concluded that fluvastatin reduces PON1 activity more efficiently than does pravastatin. Reducing effect on PON1 may negatively modulate atheroprotective potential of statins and may contribute to differences in antiatherosclerotic properties of different drugs in this group.", 
    "153": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA replication depends on viral protein association with intracellular membranes, but the influence of membrane composition on viral replication is unclear. We report that HCV RNA replication and assembly of the viral replication complex require geranylgeranylation of one or more host proteins. In cultured hepatoma cells, HCV RNA replication was disrupted by treatment with lovastatin, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methyglutaryl CoA reductase, or with an inhibitor of protein geranylgeranyl transferase I, each of which induced the dissolution of the HCV replication complex. Viral replication was not affected by treatment of cells with an inhibitor of farnesyl transferase. When added to lovastatin-treated cells, geranylgeraniol, but not farnesol, restored replication complex assembly and viral replication. Inasmuch as the HCV genome does not encode a canonical geranylgeranylated protein, the data suggest the involvement of a geranylgeranylated host protein in HCV replication. Inhibition of its geranylgeranylation affords a therapeutic strategy for treatment of HCV infection.", 
    "154": "Rosuvastatin is a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A-reductase inhibitor developed for the treatment of dyslipidemia. The results of clinical trials suggest that it is effective and well tolerated.", 
    "155": "The goals of this study were to determine the absolute bioavailability of an oral dose of rosuvastatin and to describe the intravenous pharmacokinetics of rosuvastatin in healthy volunteers.", 
    "156": "This was a randomized, open-label, 2-way crossover study consisting of 2 trial days separated by a > or =7-day washout period. Healthy male adult volunteers were given a single oral dose of rosuvastatin 40 mg on one trial day and an intravenous infusion of rosuvastatin 8 mg over 4 hours on the other. Pharmacokinetic and tolerability assessments were conducted up to 96 hours after dosing. A 3-compartment pharmacokinetic model was fitted to the plasma concentration-time profiles obtained for each volunteer after intravenous dosing.", 
    "157": "Ten white male volunteers entered and completed the trial. Their mean age was 35.7 years (range, 21-51 years), their mean height was 177 cm (range, 169-182 cm), and their mean body weight was 77.6 kg (range, 68-85 kg). The absolute oral bioavailability of rosuvastatin was estimated to be 20.1%,and the hepatic extraction ratio was estimated to be 0.63. The mean volume of distribution at steady state was 134 L. Renal clearance accounted for approximately 28% of total plasma clearance (48.9 L/h). Single oral and intravenous doses of rosuvastatin were well tolerated in this small number of healthy male volunteers.", 
    "158": "The absolute oral bioavailability of rosuvastatin in these 10 healthy volunteers was approximately 20%, and absorption was estimated to be 50%. The volume of distribution at steady state was consistent with extensive distribution of rosuvastatin to the tissues. The modest absolute oral bioavailability and high hepatic extraction of rosuvastatin are consistent with first-pass uptake into the liver after oral dosing. Rosuvastatin was cleared by both renal and nonrenal routes; tubular secretion was the predominant renal process."
