    "0": "Despite new therapeutic approaches, metastatic melanomas still have a poor prognosis. Statins reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and exert anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative actions. We have recently shown that simvastatin triggers an apoptotic burst in human metastatic melanoma cells by the synthesis of an autocrine factor.", 
    "1": "The current in vitro study was performed in human metastatic melanoma cell lines (A375, 518a2) and primary human melanocytes and melanoma cells. The secretome of simvastatin-stressed cells was analysed with two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis and MS. The signalling pathways involved were analysed at the protein and mRNA level using pharmacological approaches and siRNA technology.", 
    "2": "Simvastatin was shown to activate a stress cascade, leading to the synthesis of 15-deoxy-12,14-PGJ2 (15d-PGJ2 ), in a p38- and COX-2-dependent manner. Significant concentrations of 15d-PGJ2 were reached in the medium of melanoma cells, which were sufficient to activate caspase 8 and the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis. Inhibition of lipocalin-type PGD synthase, a key enzyme for 15d-PGJ2 synthesis, abolished the apoptotic effect of simvastatin. Moreover, 15d-PGJ2 was shown to bind to the fatty acid-binding protein 5 (FABP5), which was up-regulated and predominantly detected in the secretome of simvastatin-stressed cells. Knockdown of FABP5 abolished simvastatin-induced activation of PPAR-\u03b3 and amplified the apoptotic response.", 
    "3": "We characterized simvastatin-induced activation of the 15d-PGJ2 /FABP5 signalling cascades, which triggered an apoptotic burst in melanoma cells but did not affect primary human melanocytes. These data support the rationale for the pharmacological targeting of 15d-PGJ2 in metastatic melanoma.", 
    "4": "Statins stimulate transcription of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a negative regulator of the low-density lipoprotein receptor, thus blunting the cholesterol-lowering effects of statin treatment. Although there is interindividual variation in PCSK9 statin response, little is known about ancestral and other genetic factors that could contribute to this variation.", 
    "5": "We measured plasma PCSK9 levels before and after 6 weeks of treatment with 40\u2009mg/day simvastatin in 901 participants of the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics clinical trial and tested phenotypic and genetic factors for correlation with PCSK9 statin response.", 
    "6": "Statin-induced changes in plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B were all significantly correlated with statin-induced changes in PCSK9. A detailed examination of the associations of genetic ancestry with PCSK9 statin response revealed that Ashkenazi Jews had smaller statin-induced increases in PCSK9 levels than other self-reported Caucasians (P=0.016). Using genomewide association analysis, we found that the 'G' minor allele of rs13064411 in the WD repeat domain 52 (WDR52) gene was significantly associated with greater statin-induced increases in plasma PCSK9 in Caucasians (P=8.2 \u00d7 10(-8)) in the Cholesterol and Pharmacogenetics trial.", 
    "7": "Overall, these results suggest that genetic ancestry and the rs13064411 genotype contribute to interindividual variation in PCSK9 statin response in Caucasians.", 
    "8": "Simvastatin (SIM), a hypocholesterolaemic drug, is among the most widely used pharmaceuticals worldwide and is therefore of emerging environmental concern. Despite the ubiquitous nature of SIM in the aquatic ecosystems, significant uncertainties exist about sublethal effects of the drug in aquatic organisms. Therefore, here we aimed at investigating a multi-level biological response in the model amphipod Gammarus locusta, following chronic exposures to low levels of SIM (64 ng/L to 8 \u03bcg/L). The work integrated a battery of key endpoints at individual-level (survival, growth and reproduction) with histopathological biomarkers in hepatopancreas and gonads. Additionally, an individual-based population modelling was used to project the ecological costs associated with long-term exposure to SIM at the population level. SIM severely impacted growth, reproduction and gonad maturation of G. locusta, concomitantly to changes at the histological level. Among all analysed endpoints, reproduction was particularly sensitive to SIM with significant impact at 320 ng/L. These findings have important implications for environmental risk assessment and disclose new concerns about the effects of SIM in aquatic ecosystems.", 
    "9": "The incidence of hypertriglyceridemia has grown alongside that of obesity. Statin therapy has been widely recommended for the treatment of dyslipidemias. Omega-3 (OM3) fatty acid concentrates are commonly prescribed concurrently with statins in patients with persistent hypertriglyceridemia for additional lowering of triglyceride and non-HDL cholesterol. The bioavailability of currently available OM3 ethyl ester drugs is limited by their need for hydrolysis by pancreatic lipases, largely stimulated by dietary fat, prior to intestinal absorption. This review will discuss the chemistry, pharmacokinetics and clinical efficacy of a novel OM3 carboxylic acid drug that provides polyunsaturated docosahexaenoic and eicosapentaenoic acids in the free fatty acid form, which is readily absorbed by the intestine. This drug was approved in May 2014 as an adjunct to diet to reduce triglyceride levels in adults with severe (\u2265500 mg/dl) hypertriglyceridemia.", 
    "10": "The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence issued its final guidance in July on lipid modification, making millions more adults eligible for statin treatment. However, community nurses may encounter many patients for whom statin use is not appropriate for a variety of reasons. This article provides advice for community nurses on methods for improving patients' cholesterol levels and reducing the risk of developing cardiovascular disease if statins are not to be used. The article explains the current situation in the UK in relation to cholesterol, then gives dietary and lifestyle modifications that may help to lower cholesterol levels and help maintain good heart and circulatory health.", 
    "11": "The inhibition of cholesterol absorption by ezetimibe increases cholesterol synthesis. The effect of inhibition of cholesterol synthesis on cholesterol absorption is controversial. The influence of these interactions on cholesterol levels is unknown. We investigated on the extent to which cholesterol levels were affected by the reaction of one pathway to the inhibition of the other pathway.", 
    "12": "This case-controlled study enrolled 198 patients who needed cholesterol-lowering drugs. Ezetimibe (10 mg) was administered to the patients with (n=58) and without on-going statin therapy (n=58). Simvastatin (20 mg) was administered to the patients treated with (n=41) and without ezetimibe (n=41).", 
    "13": "Ezetimibe without statin lowered the total cholesterol by 13.3\u00b18.8% (p<0.001) and the low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) by 18.7\u00b115.3% (p<0.001). Ezetimibe added to statin decreased the total cholesterol by 21.1\u00b17.7% (p<0.001) and the LDL-C by 29.9\u00b112.6% (p<0.001). The total cholesterol and LDL-C were reduced more by ezetimibe in patients with statin therapy than in those without statin therapy (p<0.001 and p<0.001, respectively). The differences in the effect of simvastatin on total cholesterol and LDL-C between the patients with and without ezetimibe showed borderline significance (p=0.10 and p=0.055, respectively).", 
    "14": "A prior inhibition of cholesterol synthesis by statin enhanced the effect of ezetimibe on total cholesterol and LDL-C by 7.8% and 11.2%, respectively. This finding suggests that ezetimibe increased cholesterol synthesis, resulting in a significant elevation of cholesterol levels.", 
    "15": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia and is associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The anti-arrhythmic effect of statins on AF prevention appears to be highly significant in most clinical studies. However, some discrepancies do exist among different clinical studies. Different clinical settings and types of stains used may explain these differences between trials. The CHADS2 and CHA2DS2VASc scoring systems have been used for stroke risk stratification in AF patients. The recent study suggested that these scores can also be used to guide statin therapy for AF prevention. Patients with higher scores had a higher risk of developing AF and gained more benefits from statins therapy than those with lower scores. This review article focused on the ability of these scores to predict AF prevention by statins.", 
    "16": "An amphiphilic hyaluronic acid conjugate is successfully developed based on grafting a thiolated hydrophobic molecule to the polysaccharide backbone. The engineered conjugate is capable of assembling into nanostructures once dispersed in water, with average diameter of 80.2\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4\u2009nm (n\u2009=\u20095), stable up to 6 months. The thiolated HyA conjugate is reticulated by dissulfide bond with a homofunctional crosslinker-1,4-Bis(3-[2-pyridyldithio]propionamido)butane (DPDPB). The drug loading efficiency of the reticulated and non-reticulated nanogel is accessed with two hydrophobic drugs, curcumin and simvastatin. Results suggest that crosslinked nanogel exhibit higher stability upon dilution and drug loading efficiency and proves to be a redox sensitive material. The nanogels hold great potential as stealth carriers of lipophilic drugs.", 
    "17": "Leptomeningeal collaterals improve outcome after stroke, including reduction of hemorrhagic complications after thrombolytic or endovascular therapy, smaller infarct size, and reduction in symptoms at follow-up evaluation. The purpose of this study was to determine the demographic and clinical variables that are associated with a greater degree of cerebral collaterals.", 
    "18": "Clinical data of patients presenting with M1 occlusions of the middle cerebral artery (MCA) and associated computed tomography angiography studies after admission from 3 separate institutions were retrospectively compiled (n = 82). Occluded hemispheres were evaluated against the intact hemisphere for degree of collateralization in the MCA territory. Regression analysis of variance was conducted between clinical variables and collateral score to determine which variables associate with greater collateral development.", 
    "19": "Smaller infarct size corresponded to greater collateral scores, whereas older age and statin use corresponded to lower collateral scores (P < .001).", 
    "20": "Cerebral collateralization is influenced by age and statin use and influences infarct size.", 
    "21": "Simvastatin (SIM) can increase osteoblast activity and enhance osteogenesis. However, some limitations of SIM have been noted, such as statin-associated rhabdomyolysis and its poor solubility in water. In this study, we fabricated new cationic nanoparticles (NPs) designed for the controlled release of hydrophobic SIM and endocytosis by cells with the aim of reducing the total required amount of SIM administered and enhancing the osteogenesis of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). New copolymers of bis(poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-phenylalanine-polyethylene glycol)-quaternary ammonium grafted diethyltriamine (bis(PLGA-phe-PEG)-qDETA; BPPD) were created using a diethyltriamine-quaternary ammonium (qDETA) moiety, hetero-bifunctional polyethylene glycol (COOH-PEG-NH2), phenylalanine (phe) and poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA). SIM encapsulated in BPPD NPs (SIM/BPPD) was fabricated using a water-miscible solvent. The size distributions of BPPD NPs and SIM/BPPD NPs, the encapsulation efficacy and the in vitro release profile of SIM in SIM/BPPD NPs over 6days were investigated. Based on the results of Alizarin Red S staining, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity assays and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) results, we propose that SIM/BPPD NPs may induce osteogenesis in BMSCs by enhancing the expression of an osteogenic gene, which subsequently elevates ALP activity and mineralization, resulting in enhanced BMSC osteogenesis. These results suggest that the SIM/BPPD NPs may be used as hydrophobic drug carriers to reduce the total required amount of SIM administered and to provide an effective SIM release mechanism for enhancing BMSC osteogenesis. Surprisingly, BPPD NPs were also shown to have the ability to promote osteogenesis in BMSCs by enhancing the expression of osteogenic genes, especially osteocalcin (OC), and subsequently elevating ALP activity and mineralization.", 
    "22": "Neuropathic pain is a debilitating condition caused by a lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system. Statins inhibit the rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis by blocking 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase. Apart from the cholesterol-reducing actions of statins, recent studies have shown their pleiotropic actions; accordingly, their usefulness in attenuating different disease states has been described in preclinical studies. Studies in animals have also suggested their beneficial effects in attenuating neuropathic pain in various animal models of neuropathy. In these studies, their usefulness has been ascribed to cholesterol-independent actions, including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and neuromodulatory effects. On the contrary, clinical evidence suggests that statin administration in patients is associated with development of neuropathy, suggesting the dichotomous role of statins in neuropathic pain. The present review discusses the pain-attenuating as well as pain-inducing role of statins in preclinical and clinical studies, respectively. Furthermore, the review provides mechanistic insight to explain the paradoxical nature of this class of drugs in neuropathy in preclinical and clinical studies.", 
    "23": "The article reviews the pain-inducing role of statins in clinical studies and its neuropathic pain-attenuating role in preclinical studies with possible mechanisms. Understanding key differences in mechanisms may help to attenuate pain induction in the clinical setting and may possibly project statins as neuropathic pain-attenuating agents.", 
    "24": "Rosuvastatin, which is a potent statin, has never been studied in traumatic spinal cord injury. The aim of this study was to investigate whether rosuvastatin treatment could protect the spinal cord after experimental spinal cord injury. Rats were randomized into the following five groups of eight animals each: control, sham, trauma, rosuvastatin, and methylprednisolone. In the control group, no surgical intervention was performed. In the sham group, only laminectomy was performed. In all the other groups, the spinal cord trauma model was created by the occlusion of the spinal cord with an aneurysm clip. In the spinal cord tissue, caspase-3 activity, tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels, myeloperoxidase activity, malondialdehyde levels, nitric oxide levels, and superoxide dismutase levels were analyzed. Histopathological and ultrastructural evaluations were also performed. Neurological evaluation was performed using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan locomotor scale and the inclined-plane test.After traumatic spinal cord injury, increases in caspase-3 activity, tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels, myeloperoxidase activity, malondialdehyde levels, and nitric oxide levels were detected. In contrast, the superoxide dismutase levels were decreased. After the administration of rosuvastatin, decreases were observed in the tissue caspase-3 activity, tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels, myeloperoxidase activity, malondialdehyde levels, and nitric oxide levels. In contrast, tissue superoxide dismutase levels were increased. Furthermore, rosuvastatin treatment showed improved results concerning the histopathological scores, the ultrastructural score and the functional tests. Biochemical, histopathological, ultrastructural analysis and functional tests revealed that rosuvastatin exhibits meaningful neuroprotective effects against spinal cord injury.",

    "26": "The mRNA expression and function of OATP1B1, ABCB1 and ABCG2 were assessed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of healthy subjects and from patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) before and after statin treatment by real-time PCR and flow cytometric assay, respectively. The effects of statin exposure and cholesterol depletion in PBMCs and in cell lines were assessed.", 
    "27": "ABCG2 expression and activity in PBMCs in patients with FH were 2-fold and 26-fold higher, respectively, than those of the healthy subjects (p < 0.001 for both). Statin treatment decreased ABCG2 expression and function in patients with FH. Depletion of cholesterol ex vivo reduced ABCG2 expression in PBMCs and reduced ABCG2 activity in liver and colon cells.", 
    "28": "This study suggested that statins may downregulate ABCG2 expression and function through reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.", 
    "29": "Relapse and acquired drug resistance in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) remains a significant clinical problem. This study was designed to establish a preclinical model of resistance to induction therapy in childhood T-ALL to examine the emergence of drug resistance and identify novel therapies. Patient-derived T-ALL xenografts in immune-deficient (non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient) mice were exposed to a four-drug combination of vincristine, dexamethasone (DEX), L-asparaginase and daunorubicin (VXLD). 'Relapse' xenografts were characterized by responses to drugs, changes in gene expression profiles and Connectivity Map (CMap) prediction of strategies to reverse drug resistance. Two of four xenografts developed ex vivo and in vivo drug resistance. Both resistant lines showed altered lipid and cholesterol metabolism, yet they had a distinct drug resistance pattern. CMap analyses reinforced these features, identifying the cholesterol pathway inhibitor simvastatin (SVT) as a potential therapy to overcome resistance. Combined ex vivo with DEX, SVT was significantly synergistic, yet when administered in vivo with VXLD it did not delay leukemia progression. Synergy of SVT with established chemotherapy may depend on higher drug doses than are tolerable in this model. Taken together, we have developed a clinically relevant in vivo model of T-ALL suitable to examine the emergence of drug resistance and to identify novel therapies.",

There was large interindividual variability in the reductions of LDL-C, non-HDL-C, and apoB achieved with a fixed statin dose. More than 40% of trial participants assigned to high-dose statin therapy did not reach an LDL-C target <70 mg/dl. Compared with patients who achieved an LDL-C >175 mg/dl, those who reached an LDL-C 75 to <100 mg/dl, 50 to <75 mg/dl, and <50 mg/dl had adjusted hazard ratios for major cardiovascular events of 0.56 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.46 to 0.67), 0.51 (95% CI: 0.42 to 0.62), and 0.44 (95% CI: 0.35 to 0.55), respectively.

It also aimed to determine the possible mechanism of atorvastatin intervention. A model of cerebral I/R in Sprague-Dawley rats was used.", 
    "36": "Fifty-two male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups. The normal and sham-operated groups received no treatment. The I/R group was intragastrically administered with physiological saline, and the intervention group received atorvastatin (10 mg/kg) prepared with physiological saline according to reperfusion time (time of palinesthesia, 24 and 48 hours). All rats were killed after 72 hours of reperfusion.", 
    "37": "2,3,5-Triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling showed that atorvastatin significantly reduced the volume of cerebral infarction (%) in the brain tissue and attenuated neuronal apoptosis in the cortex of rats, respectively. HspB8 was expressed in the pallium of Sprague-Dawley rats in the normal and sham-operated groups. The expression level of HspB8 was significantly upregulated after cerebral I/R. However, the level of HspB8 expressed was lower in the intervention group than in the I/R group.", 
    "38": "The expression of HspB8 was upregulated after cerebral I/R injury. Atorvastatin affected the precursors of the heat shock stress response, relieved stress injury due to cerebral ischemia, downregulated HspB8 expression, and inhibited nerve cell apoptosis in the brain cortex. However, HspB8 might not contribute to atorvastatin-mediated cytoprotective effects.", 
    "39": "The technique of evaluation of metabolism of fatty acids in vivo consists in detection of content of fatty acids in phospholipids of membranes of erythrocytes. The fatty acids are received with food, through synthesis on liver from carbohydrates and by katabolism of very long-chain polyolefinic fatty acids of food in peroxisomes of hepatocytes (oxidation, saturation and desaturation). In position sn-1 phospholipids more often than palmitic fatty acid (14%) stearic fatty acid is esterified (21% of all fatty acids). The palmitic, stearic and lignoceric saturated fatty acids are esterified into sn-1 phospholipids as 2:3:1. The simvastatin (80 mg per day) increased content of margarine, tricosanoic and hexacosanoic fatty acids by decrease of level of palmitic fatty acid. The ratio omega-3 polyolefinic fatty acids/omega-6 polyolefinic fatty acids reliably increased. The statins increase content of omega-3 polyolefinic fatty acids. In practice, it is necessary to differentiate the terms \"atherosclerosis\" and \"atheromatosis\". The atherosclerosis is a syndrome of intracellular deficiency of polyolefinic fatty acids, derangement of function of cells in vivo under decrease of biological availability for all cells (absorption blockage). The atheromatosis is such most significant clinically symptom of atherosclerosis as accumulation of non-saturated and polyolefinic fatty acids in pool of collection and utilization of biological \"garbage\" from blood plasma, in intima of elastic type arteries. The statins activate absorption of low density lipoproteins by cells and normalize biological availability of polyolefinic fatty acids which have a positive effect under atherosclerosis and on formation of atheromatosis.",

Colestilan was more effective than placebo at maintaining control of serum LDL-C levels during the withdrawal phase (mean change +4.4% vs. +41.7%; difference -37.4%; p < 0.001). Reductions in total cholesterol were similar with both drugs, but simvastatin was more effective at controlling triglyceride levels. Adverse events most commonly affected the gastrointestinal system.",

    "44": "Dyslipidaemia is a critical risk factor for the development of cardiovascular complications such as ischemic heart disease and stroke. Although statins are effective anti-dyslipidemic drugs, their usage is fraught with issues such as failure of adequate lipid control in 30% of cases and intolerance in select patients. The limited potential of other alternatives such as fibrates, bile acid sequestrants and niacin has spurred the search for novel drug molecules with better efficacy and safety. CETP inhibitors such as evacetrapib and anacetrapib have shown promise in raising HDL besides LDL lowering property. Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) inhibitors such as lomitapide and Apo CIII inhibitors such as mipomersen have recently been approved in Familial Hypercholesterolemia but experience in the non-familial setting is pretty much limited. One of the novel anti-dyslipidemic drugs which is greatly anticipated to make a mark in LDL-C control is the PCSK9 inhibitors. Some of the anti-dyslipidemic drugs which work by PCSK9 inhibition include evolocumab, alirocumab and ALN-PCS. Other approaches that are being given due consideration include farnesoid X receptor modulation and Lp-PLA2 inhibition. While it may not be an easy proposition to dismantle statins from their current position as a cholesterol reducing agent and as a drug to reduce coronary and cerebro-vascular atherosclerosis, our improved understanding of the disease and appropriate harnessing of resources using sound and robust technology could make rapid in-roads in our pursuit of the ideal anti-dyslipidemic drug.",

On-site attendance at prescheduled visits was our primary exposure variable. The primary outcome was all-cause death or hospitalization at two years following the expected program completion date, irrespective of drop-out. Secondary outcomes included adherence to statins, health-seeking preventative health visits, and changes in clinical risk-profiles. Cox proportional hazards adjusted for baseline sociodemographic, clinical and comorbid characteristics.", 
    "47": "Among the 12,440 patients who attended at least one prescheduled on-site visit, on-site attendance was inversely correlated with baseline smoking rates and body mass index at program entry. After adjustment for baseline factors, the risk of death or hospitalization progressively fell with incremental increases in on-site attendance (adjusted hazard ratio for each 10% increase in on-site attendance: 0.96; 95% confidence interval: 0.93-0.99, p\u2009=\u20090.007). Such associations were driven predominantly by differences in non-cardiovascular hospitalizations. Incremental increases in on-site attendance were associated with improvements in cardiopulmonary fitness and body mass index (both p\u2009<\u20090.001), better attendance of preventative care physician visits (p\u2009<\u20090.001) and higher medication adherence to statins (p\u2009=\u20090.007).",

    "52": "By Chi-square test, there was a significant difference in the prevalence of statin use between cases and controls (23.2 vs. 16.4%, p < 0.001). Conditional logistic regression analysis revealed that after adjusting for diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, the OR for prior statin use was 1.47 (95% CI 1.28-1.69) for cases compared with controls. Bell's palsy was significantly associated with previous regular statin use (\u226560 days within 6 months) (adjusted OR: 1.46, 95% CI 1.28-1.67).

    "54": "Statins are often prescribed for treatment of cardiovascular diseases, although there are still many patients who cannot be effectively treated by statins alone. Both probucol and cilostazol exhibit anti-atherogenic effects. In the current study, we attempted to investigate whether a probucol and cilostazol combination had any add-on effects on atorvastatin. To examine this hypothesis, we fed Japanese white rabbits with a cholesterol-rich diet supplemented with atorvastatin alone (Statin group), probucol and cilostazol (PC group), atorvastatin, probucol and cilostazol (APC group), and compared their effects on plasma lipids and aortic atherosclerosis. All three drug-treated groups had lowered total cholesterol levels compared with the vehicle group but high-density lipoproteins cholesterol levels of the atorvastatin group were higher than other groups. Although aortic atherosclerosis was significantly reduced in all drug-treated groups, the most prominent atheroprotective effect was seen in APC group (APC: 67% reduction> PC: 43% reduction> Statin group: 42% reduction over the vehicle). Morphometric analysis revealed that the reduced aortic atherosclerosis in all three groups was mainly attributed to the reduction of intimal macrophages and smooth muscle cells. These results suggest that a combination of probucol and cilostazol with statin enhances statin's anti-atherogenic functions, which may be beneficial for those patients who are less responsive to statin therapy alone.", 
    "55": "Statins have been shown to favorably affect the prognosis of patients with risk factors to atherosclerosis-both as a primary and a secondary prevention. The beneficial effects observed with statin therapy are not merely related to changes in lipid profile but also are due to a positive effect on vascular inflammation and on immune-modulation of T lymphocytes and endothelial progenitor stem cells (EPCs). This dual effect has been demonstrated mainly in clinical trials where a change in endothelial function was observed within hours, much earlier than the effects of statins on the lipid profile (weeks). Based on all the knowledge that we have today questions were raised as to the mechanistic pathways that may explain the process of atherosclerosis and through this pathway to find better solutions and therapies to prevent and fight atherosclerosis. Our review will focus on the new updates in the field of inflammation and stem cells in vascular biology-in relation with atherosclerosis.",

    "96": "Berberine (BBR) is a botanical alkaloid that has been reported to have effects in cardiovascular diseases; however, the mechanisms involved are not yet fully understood. In the present study, the protective effects of BBR were evaluated, and the underlying molecular mechanisms were investigated. The effects of a combination of atorvastatin and BBR on foam cell formation were also investigated. THP-1-derived macrophages were pre-treated with BBR (5, 10 and 20 mg/l) for 2 h prior to the addition of oxidized low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL; 50 mg/l). Small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and the adenosine 5'-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) inhibitor, compound C, were used to investigate the mechanisms through which BBR exerts its effects. To determine the effect of a combination of atorvastatin and BBR, the macrophages were treated with atorvastatin and BBR separately or jointly for 2 h, and then treated with ox-LDL (50 mg/l) or lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 10 \u00b5M) for 12 h. Oil Red O staining was used to detect foam cell formation. Lipid amounts were assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Gene and protein expression was evaluated by RT-qPCR, western blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) carried out separately or jointly. The results from Oil Red O staining and HPLC revealed that BBR effectively suppressed foam cell formation and lipid and cholesterol accumulation. Furthermore, BBR upregulated the expression of SIRT1 and AMPK and downregulated the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR-\u03b3). Pre-treatment of the cells with SIRT1-siRNA or compound C attenuated the anti-atherosclerotic effects of BBR. The results obtained in the present study demonstrate that the combination of atorvastatin and BBR is more effective in inhibiting foam cell formation than using atorvastatin alone. These data suggest that BBR suppresses foam cell formation by activating the AMPK-SIRT1-PPAR-\u03b3 pathway and diminishing the uptake of ox-LDL. Combination therapy with BBR and atorvastatin was more effective in preventing atherosclerotic processes than atorvastatin alone.", 
    "97": "Atherosclerosis, the major cause of heart attack and stroke, is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the formation of atherosclerotic plaque. Oxidized low-density lipoprotein through increased oxidative stress has been identified as one of the primary factors responsible for atherogenesis. Cell proliferation and death are key processes in the progression of atherosclerosis. The oxidative environment in areas of lipid accumulation is mainly created by the production of reactive oxygen species, which are assumed to mediate vascular tissue injury. Oxidative DNA damage and levels of DNA repair are reduced during dietary lipid lowering. The tumor suppressor molecules play a pivotal role in regulating cell proliferation, DNA repair and cell death, which are important processes in regulating the composition of atherosclerotic plaque. Accordingly, in this review, we discuss the fundamental role of tumor suppressor molecules in regulating atherogenesis. In particular, we discuss how tumor suppressor molecules are activated in the complex environment of atherosclerotic plaque, and regulate growth arrest, cell senescence and the apoptosis of vascular smooth muscle cells, which may protect against the progression of atherosclerosis. In addition, we discuss promising alternatives to the use of medications (such as statin) against atherosclerosis, namely diet, with the use of plant-derived supplements to modulate the expression and/or activity of tumor suppressor molecules. We also summarize the progress of research made on herbs with a focus on the modulatory roles of tumor suppressors, and on the molecular mechanisms underlying the prevention if atherosclerosis, supporting designs for further research in this field.", 
    "98": "Statin-associated muscular adverse effects cover a wide range of symptoms, including asymptomatic increase of creatine kinase serum activity and life-threatening rhabdomyolysis. Different underlying pathomechanisms have been proposed. However, a unifying concept of the pathogenesis of statin-related muscular adverse effects has not emerged so far. In this review, we attempt to categorize these mechanisms along three levels. Firstly, among pharmacokinetic factors, it has been shown for some statins that inhibition of cytochrome P450-mediated hepatic biotransformation and hepatic uptake by transporter proteins contribute to an increase of systemic statin concentrations. Secondly, at the myocyte membrane level, cell membrane uptake transporters affect intracellular statin concentrations. Thirdly, at the intracellular level, inhibition of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase results in decreased intracellular concentrations of downstream metabolites (e.g. selenoproteins, ubiquinone, cholesterol) and alteration of gene expression (e.g. ryanodine receptor 3, glycine amidinotransferase). We also review current recommendations for prescribers.", 
    "99": "In liver statins inhibit synthesis of specific pool of cholesterol which is formed de novo by hepatocytes for monolayer of polar lipids at the surface of forming lipoproteins of very low density. The statins, decreasing content of non-esterified cholesterol in monolayer, activate hydrolysis of triglycerides in lipoproteins of very low density, formation of lipoproteins of low density and their absorption by cells through apoB-100 receptors. The statins, activating absorption of lipoproteins of low density, restore functional action of essential polyenoic fatty acids. The essential polyenoic fatty acids, fibrates and glitazones form in cells effective oleic version of metabolism when mitochondrions predominantly oxidize oleic fatty acid. The statins, non-activating oxidation in peroxisomes and inhibiting activity of stearil-KoA-desaturase, form in cells less effective palmitic variant of metabolism of fatty acids under oxidation of palmitic fatty acid in mitochondrions. The fatty acids are not enough under hydrolysis of exogenous triglycerides to synthesize optimal amount of ATP. The fatty acids accumulated in adipocytes are to be used. This is the cause of formation by statins the resistance to insulin. Functionally, lipoproteins of very low density and lipoproteins of low density are phylogenetically different. The former ones transfer fatty acids to cells in the form of triglycerides and the latter ones--in the form of ethers with alcohol cholesterol. The statins normalize absorption of essential polyenoic fatty acids by cells which manifest a physiological action named a pleotropic one.",

For each patient, cultures of early and late EPCs were performed under 4 different conditions: normal glucose concentration (control); high glucose concentration; normal glucose concentration with atorvastatin supplementation and normal glucose concentration with pravastatin supplementation. To compare the effect of these treatments on EPC function in DMpts versus NDMpts, we performed in vitro: EPC colony-forming units (CFU) assay; cell cycle analysis; viability assessment and expression of the surface markers CXCR4, CD133, CD34 and KDR. Under control conditions, CFU numbers were reduced in DMpts-derived EPCs when compared to those of NDMpts (1.4\u00b10.8 vs 2.6\u00b11.2 CFU/well, P=0.021). When early EPCs from DMpts were cultured in the presence of statins, CFU capacity was restored, surmounting that of NDMpts under control conditions. Statins significantly improved viability of early EPCs and delayed the onset of late EPCs senescence, even in cells from DMpts. In addition, statins induced approximately a 2-fold increase in the proportion of late EPCs in S-phase of the cell cycle (P<0.05). Statins have a beneficial effect on both early and late EPCs from DMpts with AMI.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of atorvastatin and pitavastatin on serum apoA-I levels and to investigate the role of apoA-I in the anti-inflammatory effect of statin. We conducted a 6-month, prospective, randomized, open-label study in which we assigned hypercholesterolemic patients to a pitavastatin group (n = 52; 2 mg/day) or an atorvastatin group (n = 52; 10 mg/day) to investigate the effects of these two statins on the serum apoA-I levels and serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels. There were no significant differences between the two groups in the changes in the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), or hs-CRP levels, but the change in apoA-I in the pitavastatin group was significantly greater than in the atorvastatin group (5.3 vs. 1.4 %; p = 0.0001). A stepwise regression analysis revealed that the percent change in (\u0394) serum apoA-I level was an independent predictor of the \u0394 serum hs-CRP (standard correlation coefficient = -0.198; p = 0.047). However, there was a significant negative correlation between the \u0394 apoA-I levels and \u0394 hs-CRP levels in the pitavastatin group (r = -0.283, p = 0.042), but not the atorvastatin group (r = -0.133, p = 0.356). The results suggest that the contribution of apoA-I to the reduction in serum hs-CRP levels by these two statins may be different. A decrease in hs-CRP level accompanied by an increase in apoA-I level may be involved in the pleiotropic effects of pitavastatin.",

Head trauma was associated with an increased ALS susceptibility (OR 1.95, 95% CI 1.11-3.43, P = 0.02). No association was found with autoimmune diseases, cancer, psychiatric disorders or cardiovascular diseases, or survival. The lower frequency of hypercholesterolemia and less use of statins in ALS patients indicate a favorable lipid profile prior to symptom onset in at least a subpopulation of ALS. Prior head trauma is a risk factor for ALS and the significantly lower use of immunosuppressive drugs in ALS patients could suggest a protective effect. The identification of specific subpopulations at risk for ALS may provide clues towards possible pathogenic mechanisms.",

Rats were exposed to sodium arsenite (100ppm) through drinking water for 90 consecutive days. Atorvastatin (10mg/kg bw, orally) was administered once daily during the last 30days of arsenic exposure. On the 91(st) day, blood was collected for measuring serum C-reactive protein. Thoracic aorta was isolated for assessing reactivity to phenylephrine, sodium nitroprusside and acetylcholine; evaluating eNOS and iNOS mRNA expression and measuring NO production, while abdominal aorta was used for ELISA of cytokines, chemokine and vascular cell adhesion molecules. Histopathology was done in aortic arches. Arsenic did not alter phenylephrine-elicited contraction. Atorvastatin inhibited Emax of phenylephrine, but it augmented the contractile response in aortic rings from arsenic-exposed animals. Sodium nitroprusside-induced relaxation was not altered with any treatment. However, arsenic reduced acetylcholine-induced relaxation and affected aortic eNOS at the levels of mRNA expression, protein concentration, phosphorylation and NO production. Further, it increased aortic iNOS mRNA expression, iNOS-derived NO synthesis, production of pro-inflammatory mediators (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, MCP-1, VCAM, sICAM) and serum C-reactive protein and aortic vasculopathic lesions. Atorvastatin attenuated these arsenic-mediated functional, biochemical and structural alterations.

Hence we measured expression of genes involved in cell cycle progression (cyclin G1), ventricular remodelling brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and environmental stress response small proline-rich protein 1A (SPRR 1A) in the offspring left ventricle (LV) from dams on HF with or without statin treatment. Female C57 mice were fed a HF diet (45% kcal fat) 4 weeks prior to conception, during pregnancy and lactation. From the second half of the pregnancy and throughout lactation, half of the pregnant females on HF diet were given a water-soluble statin (Pravastatin) in their drinking water (HF + S). At weaning offspring were fed HF diet to adulthood (generating dam/offspring dietary groups HF/HF and HF + S/HF). These groups were compared with offspring from dams fed standard chow (C 21% kcal fat) and fed C diet from weaning (C/C). LV mRNA levels for cyclin G1, BNP and SPRR 1A were measured by RT-PCR.

    "151": "Sex differentiation of the male reproductive tract in mammals is driven, in part, by fetal androgen production. In utero, some phthalate esters (PEs) alter fetal Leydig cell differentiation, reducing the expression of several genes associated with steroid synthesis/transport, and consequently, lowering fetal androgen and Insl3 hormone levels. Simvastatin (SMV) is a cholesterol-lowering drug that directly inhibits HMG-CoA reductase. SMV may also disrupt steroid biosynthesis, but through a different mode of action (MOA) than the PEs. As cholesterol is a precursor of steroid hormone biosynthesis, we hypothesized that in utero exposure to SMV during the critical period of sex differentiation would lower fetal testicular testosterone (T) production without affecting genes involved in cholesterol and androgen synthesis and transport. Secondly, we hypothesized that a mixture of SMV and a PE, which may have different MOAs, would reduce testosterone levels in an additive manner. Pregnant Sprague Dawley rats were dosed orally with SMV, dipentyl phthalate (DPeP), or SMV plus DPeP from gestational days 14-18, and fetuses were evaluated on GD18. On GD18, SMV lowered fetal T production and serum triglycerides, low density lipoprotein, high density lipoprotein, and total cholesterol levels, and downregulated two genes in the fetal testis that were different from those altered by PEs. When SMV and DPeP were administered as a mixture, fetal T production was significantly reduced in an additive manner, thus demonstrating that a mixture of chemicals can induce additive effects on fetal T production even though they display different MOAs.",

Herein, we showed, by real-time PCR analysis of mRNA from human breast cancer biopsies, no significant differences in OSC expression at various stages of disease, or between tumor and normal mammary cells. Since the growth of hormone-responsive tumors is ER\u03b1-dependent, we conducted experiments to determine whether RO affects ER\u03b1. Using mammalian cells engineered to express human\u00a0ER\u03b1 or ER\u03b2 protein, together with an ER-responsive luciferase promoter, we found that RO dose-dependently inhibited 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2)-induced ER\u03b1 responsive luciferase activity (IC50 value, ~10\u00a0\u00b5M), under conditions that were non-toxic to the cells. RO was less effective against ER\u03b2-induced luciferase activity. Androgen receptor (AR) mediated transcriptional activity was also reduced by RO. Notably, while ER\u03b1 activity was reduced by atorvastatin, the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor did not influence AR activity, showing that RO possesses broader antitumor properties. Treatment of human BT-474 breast cancer cells with RO reduced levels of estrogen-induced PR protein, confirming that RO blocks ER\u03b1 activity in tumor cells. Our findings demonstrate that an important means by which RO suppresses hormone-dependent growth of breast cancer cells is through its ability to arrest the biological activity of ER\u03b1. This warrants further investigation of RO as a potential therapeutic agent for use against hormone-dependent breast cancers.", 
    "168": "Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is the leading cause of death and disability in the United States and other developed nations, and is rising rapidly in the rest of the world. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is the major atherogenic particle in most patients at high risk for ASCVD events, and statin-based LDL-lowering treatment is the major focus of treatment for prevention of ASCVD. Despite this, an estimated 57 million US adults (25%) still have moderately elevated levels of LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) > 160 mg/dL, and many others have an LDL-C above the level considered appropriate for their high-risk status. Although statins are very effective for lowering LDL-C, and other classes of LDL-lowering medications are available, many patients still cannot achieve adequate LDL-lowering with maximal tolerated doses of US Food and Drug Administration-approved treatments. Thus, there is an unmet medical need for statin adjuncts in these patients, as well as for statin alternatives in statin-intolerant patients. A recently discovered human protein, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), plays an important role in LDL metabolism by promoting degradation of the LDL receptor, and thus reducing clearance of LDL and increasing LDL-C levels. Accordingly, inhibition of PCSK9 activity has become an attractive target for drug development for lowering LDL-C, and human monoclonal antibodies against PCSK9, are now in late-stage clinical development. These antibodies are at least as effective as statins for LDL-C lowering (or more so), and their effects are additive to those of statins. To date, they have been well tolerated and apparently safe in clinical trials. Long-term randomized, controlled trials of their safety, tolerability, and ability to reduce ASCVD are now underway.",

A combined CYP3A4/5 genotype classification, combining the decrease-of-function CYP3A4*22 and the loss-of-function CYP3A5*3, has recently been reported. We aim to determine whether CYP3A4*22 and CYP3A5*3 alleles are associated with increased plasma concentrations of simvastatin lactone (SV) and simvastatin acid (SVA). This is the first report evaluating associations between in-vivo simvastatin concentrations and CYP3A4*22, alone or in a combined CYP3A4/5 genotype-defined classification.",

Concentrations were determined in 12-h postdose samples. Associations between simvastatin concentrations and CYP3A4*22 and CYP3A5*3 alleles were tested separately and in a combined CYP3A4/5 genotype-defined classification system.", 
    "171": "In Whites, CYP3A4*22 carriers (n=42) had 14% higher SVA (P=0.04) and 20% higher SV (P=0.06) compared with noncarriers (n=513). CYP3A5*3 allele status was not significantly associated with SV or SVA in Whites. In African-Americans, CYP3A4*22 carriers (n=8) had 170% higher SV (P<0.01) than noncarriers (n=267), but no significant difference was detected for SVA. African-American CYP3A5 nonexpressors (n=28) had 33% higher SV (P=0.02) than CYP3A5 expressors (n=247), but no significant difference was detected for SVA.

    "173": "We used the Archimedes Model, a mathematical simulation model (Model) to estimate the clinical- and cost-effectiveness of using LDL particle concentration (LDL-P) as an adjunct or alternative to LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) to guide statin therapy. LDL-P by NMR has been shown to be a better measure of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk than LDL-C, and may therefore be a better gauge of the need for and response to statin treatment. Using the Model, we conducted a virtual clinical trial comparing the use of LDL-C alone, LDL-P alone, and LDL-C and LDL-P together to guide treatment in the general adult population, and in high-risk, dyslipidemic subpopulations. In the general population, the 5-year major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) relative risk reduction (RRR) of LDL-P alone compared to the control arm (LDL-C alone) was 5.0% (95% CI, 4.7-5.3; p\u00a0<\u00a0.0001); using both LDL-C and LDL-P (dual markers) led to 3.0% RRR compared to the control arm (95% CI, 2.8-3.3; p\u00a0<\u00a0.0001). For individuals with diabetes, the RRR was 7.3% (95% CI, 6.4-8.2; p\u00a0<\u00a0.0001) for LDL-P alone and 6.9% for dual markers (95% CI, 6.1-7.8; both, p\u00a0<\u00a0.0001). In the general population, the costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) associated with the use of LDL-P alone were $76,052 at 5 years and $8913 at 20 years and $142,825 at 5 years and $25,505 at 20 years with the use of both markers. In high-risk subpopulations, the use of LDL-P alone was cost-saving at 5 years; whereas the cost per QALY for the use of both markers was $14,250 at 5 years and $859 at 20 years for high-risk dyslipidemics, $19,192 at 5 years and $649 at 20 years for diabetics, and $9030 at 5 years and $7268 at 20 years for patients with prior CHD. In conclusion, the model estimates that using LDL-P to guide statin therapy may reduce the risk of CVD events to a greater extent than does the use of LDL-C alone and maybe cost-effective or cost-saving for high-risk patients.", 
    "174": "Mycobacterium leprae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis antimicrobial resistance has been followed with great concern during the last years, while the need for new drugs able to control leprosy and tuberculosis, mainly due to extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), is pressing. Our group recently showed that M. leprae is able to induce lipid body biogenesis and cholesterol accumulation in macrophages and Schwann cells, facilitating its viability and replication. Considering these previous results, we investigated the efficacies of two statins on the intracellular viability of mycobacteria within the macrophage, as well as the effect of atorvastatin on M. leprae infections in BALB/c mice. We observed that intracellular mycobacteria viability decreased markedly after incubation with both statins, but atorvastatin showed the best inhibitory effect when combined with rifampin. Using Shepard's model, we observed with atorvastatin an efficacy in controlling M. leprae and inflammatory infiltrate in the BALB/c footpad, in a serum cholesterol level-dependent way. We conclude that statins contribute to macrophage-bactericidal activity against Mycobacterium bovis, M. leprae, and M. tuberculosis. It is likely that the association of statins with the actual multidrug therapy effectively reduces mycobacterial viability and tissue lesion in leprosy and tuberculosis patients, although epidemiological studies are still needed for confirmation.", 
    "175": "Endothelial progenitor stem cells (EPCs) are mobilized to the peripheral circulation in response to myocardial ischemia, playing a crucial role in vascular repair. Statins have been shown to stimulate EPCs. However, neither the impact of previous statin therapy on EPC response of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients nor the effect of post-AMI high-intensity statin therapy on the evolution of circulating EPC levels has yet been addressed. Therefore, we aimed to compare circulating EPC levels between patients receiving long-term statin therapy before the AMI and statin-naive patients and to assess the impact of high-intensity statin therapy at discharge on the evolution of circulating EPCs post-AMI.", 
    "176": "This is a prospective observational study of 100 AMI patients. Circulating EPCs (CD45dimCD34\u2009+\u2009KDR\u2009+\u2009cells) and their subpopulation coexpressing the homing marker CXCR4 were quantified by the high-performance flow cytometer FACSCanto II in whole blood, in two different moments: within the first 24\u00a0h of admission and 3\u00a0months post-AMI. Patients were followed up clinically for 2\u00a0years.",

In addition, the subanalysis of diabetics (N\u2009=\u200938) also revealed that patients previously on statins had significantly greater numbers of both CD45dimCD34\u2009+\u2009KDR\u2009+\u2009CXCR4+ cells (p\u2009=\u20090.024) and CD45dimCD34\u2009+\u2009KDR\u2009+\u2009CD133+ cells (p\u2009=\u20090.022) than statin-naive patients. Regarding the evolution of EPC levels after the AMI, patients not on a high-intensity statin therapy at discharge had a significant reduction of CD45dimCD34\u2009+\u2009KDR\u2009+\u2009and CD45dimCD34\u2009+\u2009KDR\u2009+\u2009CXCR4+ cells from baseline to 3\u00a0months follow-up (p\u2009=\u20090.031 and p\u2009=\u20090.005, respectively). However, patients discharged on a high-intensity statin therapy maintained circulating levels of all EPC populations, presenting at 3\u00a0months of follow-up significantly higher EPC levels than patients not on an intensive statin therapy. Moreover, the high-intensity statin treatment group had significantly better clinical outcomes during the 2-year follow-up period than patients not discharged on a high-intensity statin therapy.", 
    "178": "Chronic statin therapy prior to an AMI strongly enhances the response of EPCs to myocardial ischemia, even in diabetic patients. Furthermore, high-intensity statin therapy after an AMI prevents the expected decrease of circulating EPC levels during follow-up. These results reinforce the importance of an early and intensive statin therapy in AMI patients.", 
    "179": "Hypertension and coronary heart disease are common in aortic stenosis (AS) and may impair prognosis for similar AS severity. Different changes in the electrocardiogram may be reflective of the separate impacts of AS, hypertension, and coronary heart disease, which could lead to enhanced risk stratification in AS. The aim of this study was therefore to examine if combining prognostically relevant electrocardiographic (ECG) findings improves prediction of cardiovascular mortality in asymptomatic AS. All patients with baseline electrocardiograms in the SEAS study were included. The primary end point was cardiovascular death. Backward elimination (p >0.01) identified heart rate, Q waves, and Cornell voltage-duration product as independently associated with cardiovascular death. Multivariate logistic and Cox regression models were used to evaluate if these 3 ECG variables improved prediction of cardiovascular death. In 1,473 patients followed for a mean of 4.3\u00a0years (6,362 patient-years of follow-up), 70 cardiovascular deaths (5%) occurred. In multivariate analysis, heart rate (hazard ratio [HR] 1.5 per 11.2\u00a0minute(-1) [1 SD], 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.2 to 1.8), sum of Q-wave amplitude (HR 1.3 per 2.0\u00a0mm [1 SD], 95% CI 1.1 to 1.6), and Cornell voltage-duration product (HR 1.4 per 763\u00a0mm\u00a0\u00d7 ms [1 SD], 95% CI 1.2 to 1.7) remained independently associated with cardiovascular death. Combining the prognostic information contained in each of the 3 ECG variables improved integrated discrimination for prediction of cardiovascular death by 2.5%, net reclassification by 14.3%, and area under the curve by 0.06 (all p \u22640.04) beyond other important risk factors. ECG findings add incremental predictive information for cardiovascular mortality in asymptomatic patients with AS.", 
    "180": "Data examining cardiovascular (CV) risk factors in renal transplant recipients (RTRs) and their contribution to the disparity in graft survival between African American (AA) patients and non-AAs is limited. A single-center, retrospective analysis of 1003 adult RTRs from January 1, 2000 to May 1, 2008 to inspect the impact of race on post-transplant CV events, treatment of CV risk factors and their independent influence on graft outcomes was performed. AAs experienced a higher incidence of late graft loss, with 1- and 5-year graft survival rates of 93% and 76% vs 95% and 84% in the non-AA group, respectively. AA patients had a higher prevalence of hypertension (HTN) and diabetes mellitus (DM) and demonstrated reduced control of DM post-transplant (AA 74% vs non-AA 82%, p = 0.053). Multivariate analysis for graft survival indicated acute rejection, delayed graft function (DGF) and incidence of CV events were significant risk factors for graft failure, while the use of beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors were protective. In conclusion, after controlling for CV risk factors and events, race did not have an independent effect on outcomes, suggesting CV risk factors and events contribute to this disparity. Clinical summary. AAs experienced a higher rate of graft failure and CV events; after adjusting for multiple immunological and CV risk factors, race no longer remained an independent risk factor for post-transplant CV events or graft failure; although disparities in post-transplant outcomes remain, race alone does not account for the disparity; the racial disparity is due to the higher incidence of DGF and acute rejection, as well as traditional CV risk factors, including HTN and DM.",

Prior studies show a need to improve clinical practice in this area. Here, we review the latest research and perspectives on improving postmyocardial infarction lipid control.", 
    "182": "Dyslipidemia and myocardial infarction remain leading causes of global disability and premature mortality throughout the world. The processes of care in lipid control involve multiple patient-level, provider-level, and healthcare system-level factors. They can be challenging to coordinate. Recent studies show suboptimal use of early high-intensity statin therapy and overall lipid control following myocardial infarction. Encouragingly, lipid control has improved over the last decade. Implementation science has identified checklists as an effective tool. At the top of the checklist for reducing atherogenic lipids and recurrent event risk postmyocardial infarction is early high-intensity statin therapy. Smoking cessation and participation in cardiac rehabilitation are also priorities, as are lifestyle counseling, promotion of medication adherence, ongoing lipid surveillance, and medication management.",

    "184": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and/or progressive loss of \u03b2-cell function. T2DM patients are at increased risk of micro- and macrovascular disease, and are often considered as representing an atherosclerotic coronary heart disease (CHD) risk equivalent. Interventions directed at glucose and lipid level control in T2DM patients may reduce micro- and macrovascular disease. The optimal T2DM agent is one that lowers glucose levels with limited risk for hypoglycemia, and with no clinical trial evidence of worsening CHD risk. Lipid-altering drugs should preferably reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apolipoprotein B (apo B) and have evidence that the mechanism of action reduces CHD risk. Statins reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and apo B and have evidence of improving CHD outcomes, and are thus first-line therapy for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. In patients who do not achieve optimal lipid levels with statin therapy, or who are intolerant to statin therapy, add-on therapy or alternative therapies may be indicated. Additional available agents to treat hypercholesterolemic patients with T2DM include bile acid sequestrants, fibrates, niacin, and ezetimibe. This review discusses the use of these alternative agents to treat hypercholesterolemia in patients with T2DM, either as monotherapy or in combination with statin therapy.",

Immunoglobulin G anti-oxLDL showed the highest values at 21 weeks. Seven patients (16.7%) were nondyslipidemic at 21 weeks. In patients who continued to be dyslipidemic, LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels significantly decreased, salusin \u03b1 levels and CD36 expression increased, and dyslipidemia resolved in 59.4% of the patients following atorvastatin treatment.",

Recently oxysterols, which activate the Liver X Receptor (LXR), have been implicated in producing sEng, by upregulating matrix metalloproteinase-14 (MMP14; cleaves endoglin to produce sEng) and down-regulating tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-3 (TIMP-3; inhibitor of MMP14). The functional experiments in that study were performed on JAR cells (human choriocarcinoma cell line) and placental explants.",

Given pravastatin is thought to block oxysterol production and inhibit the LXR, we examined whether pravastatin reduces sEng release.", 
    "192": "LXR\u03b1 and \u03b2 were localized to the syncytiotrophoblast and villous tips and were significantly up-regulated in preeclamptic placenta. Oxysterols upregulated sEng production in HUVECs and placental explants although the increases were far more modest than that recently reported. Oxysterols did not upregulate sEng in primary trophoblasts. Furthermore, mRNA expression of MMP14 and TIMP-3 were not altered by oxysterols in any tissue. Surprisingly, pravastatin did not decrease oxysterol-induced upregulation of sEng.", 
    "193": "LXR is up-regulated in preeclamptic placenta. Oxysterols upregulate sEng production from human tissues, but the increase is modest, suggesting this may not be the main mechanism for the very significant elevations in sEng seen in preeclampsia.

In other words, there is an excess of cholesterol and triglycerides, associated or not with HDL-c deficiency. These clinical conditions are associated with high to very high cardiovascular risk. It is appropriate when treating these conditions to achieve an overall control of lipid metabolism abnormalities, in terms of excess cholesterol carried by atherogenic lipoproteins (LDL-c and non-HDL-c) and triglyceride excess and deficit of HDL-c. To achieve this overall control is necessary to correct the potential causes of secondary dyslipidemia, improve lifestyle habits and use a drug from the statin family, and it is often necessary to combine a drug from the fibrate family. This combination has been shown to be effective and safe in the overall control of dyslipidemia and the cardiovascular risk prevention in patients at high risk. This combination has been shown to have a favorable eff ect in the population with diabetes and microangiopathy, both in the retina and in the glomerulus. For patients with moderate renal failure, the use of fibrates is controversial, and there are marked disagreements between the recommendations issued by various organizations and expert consensus groups.", 
    "196": "The combination with fixed doses of pravastatin (40 mg) and fenofibrate (160 mg) offers a therapeutic alternative, especially in the comprehensive approach to mixed hyperlipidemia in patients with high cardiovascular risk of metabolic origin. It also ensures the efficacy and safety as a result of the evidence that supports the clinical benefit of both pravastatin in primary and secondary prevention and fenofibrate in patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia. This combination also has few adverse effects, which are similar in all cases to those produced by the isolated monotherapy of each of the drugs. Consequently, the possible indications for this combination include patients with mixed hyperlipidemia, patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia (increased triglyceride levels, reduced HDL-c levels and moderately increased LDL-c levels), patients with hypertriglyceridemia who need to reduce their LDL-c levels, patients with low HDL syndrome who also require a reduction in LDL-c levels, patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia who require an additional reduction of triglyceride levels and especially patients with high atherogenic metabolic risk who require an overall intervention for each of the lipid fractions.", 
    "197": "Although LDL cholesterol is the primary treatment objective for reducing cardiovascular risk, the increase in triglyceride levels and the reduction of HDL cholesterol levels constitute the so-called residual cardiovascular risk. Treatment with statins combined with fibrates is an actual possibility for the treatment of overall cardiovascular risk. However, this combination is often associated with adverse eff ects, especially muscular and hepatic. Due to its pharmacological characteristics, the combination of pravastatin and fenofibrate can be effective and safe, with few adverse eff ects. In this review, we analyze the available safety studies and conclude that Pravafenix(\u00ae) (the combination of 40-mg pravastatin and 160-mg fenofibrate) achieves complementary benefits on the overall atherogenic lipid profile, is well tolerated and has few adverse eff ects, which is similar to the monotherapy of each of its components. It remains to be seen whether this combination confers additional long-term benefits for patients treated with statins.", 
    "198": "Therapeutic objectives for patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia are achieved by improving patient compliance and adherence. Clinical practice guidelines address the importance of treatment compliance for achieving objectives. The combination of a fixed dose of pravastatin and fenofibrate increases the adherence by simplifying the drug regimen and reducing the number of daily doses. The good tolerance, the cost of the combination and the possibility of adjusting the administration to the patient's lifestyle helps achieve the objectives for these patients with high cardiovascular risk.", 
    "199": "Pravafenix(\u00ae) is a fixed-dose combination of 40mg of pravastatin and 160 mg of fenofibrate. The rationale behind the use of Pravafenix(\u00ae) is based on the increased residual cardiovascular risk observed in high risk patients with hypertriglyceridemia and/or low HDL cholesterol levels despite treatment with statins in monotherapy. In this article, we review the available evidence on the clinical efficacy of Pravafenix(\u00ae), which shows complementary benefits in the overall lipid profile of high risk patients with mixed dyslipidemia not controlled with 40-mg pravastatin or 20-mg simvastatin."
