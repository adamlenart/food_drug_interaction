The long-term clinical experience with simvastatin indicates that it is a safe, effective, and well-tolerated hypolipidemic agent. Laboratory adverse events involving elevations of serum transaminase levels and serum creatine kinase (CK) levels to more than three times the upper limit of normal range have been seen in 1.5% and 3.4% of cases, respectively. We describe a case of severe myopathy and rhabdomyolysis associated with concomitant use of simvastatin and gemfibrozil. Seven days after discontinuing administration of gemfibrozil and simvastatin, the patient's condition improved and she was discharged home. Although this is the first report to indicate an association between myopathy and concomitant use of simvastatin and gemfibrozil, we strongly recommend caution and careful monitoring if simvastatin is given to patients receiving gemfibrozil.", 
    "1": "Cell membrane cholesterol is an important determinant of membrane fluidity. Changes in fluidity have important consequences for membrane function. Treatment of hypercholesterolaemia could therefore affect membrane function by reducing cell membrane cholesterol levels. The aim of this study was to determine whether treatment with simvastatin affects membrane cholesterol and the activity of the polymorphonuclear cell membrane enzyme NADPH oxidase. Blood was obtained from 12 hypercholesterolaemic patients before, and 6 weeks after, treatment with simvastatin, and from 20 normolipidaemic subjects. Cell cholesterol was in the unesterified from indicating that it was membrane-associated. Pre-treatment mean cell cholesterol concentration in the hyperlipidaemics was higher (P < 0.05) than in the normolipidaemics [4.19 fmol/cell, 95% confidence interval (CI) 3.38-5.05 versus 3.10 fmol/cell, 95% CI 2.58-3.61]. There was a strong correlation between cell cholesterol content and NADPH oxidase lag phase (R(s) = 0.76, P < 0.01). Cell cholesterol fell to 3.52 fmol/cell (95% CI 2.77-4.28, P < 0.05) following treatment and there was a correlation (R(s) = 0.61, P < 0.05) between the reductions in cell cholesterol and lag phase.",

    "3": "The studies were identified using the Medline CD+ and Current Contents databases from January 1980 through May 1996, inclusive. All studies were evaluated on the use of a placebo control, monotherapy, and double blindness. When the type of stroke or the occurrence of clinical events or adverse effects were incompletely or not reported, the investigators were contacted personally. For each trial, the number of strokes in the treatment arm was compared with the number of strokes expected on all observations under the assumption that drug treatment had no effect.", 
    "4": "A total of 462 strokes among 20438 participants in 13 trials could be analyzed. A total of 181 strokes were observed in patients randomized to treatment with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and 261 strokes in patients randomized to placebo. A lower than expected number of strokes was observed in the treatment groups of all but one trial (P = .001). Treatment with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor led to an overall risk reduction of 31% (odds ratio, 0.69; 95% confidence interval, 0.57 to 0.83).", 
    "5": "The combined data suggest that treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors prevents stroke in middle-aged persons. Because stroke is especially common in older age, these data reinforce the need for clinical trials to evaluate the effect of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in preventing stroke in the elderly.", 
    "6": "A meta-analysis of the benefits of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery has been used as the basis of a model for comparing the costs and benefits of surgical and medical treatment of angina pectoris. In order to allow for the results of recent research, the economic model included the addition of aspirin and aspirin plus an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) to medical management. The analysis indicates that in unselected patients the cost-effectiveness of CABG vs initial standard medical therapy over 5 years is towards the upper limit of what can be considered a cost-effective treatment both in terms of its effect on mortality (life-years gained) and morbidity (quality adjusted life-years). Addition of a statin to medical therapy reduced mortality and made coronary artery bypass graft surgery an expensive option in terms of improvement of quality of life. In patients with three-vessel disease or left ventricular dysfunction surgery appears fairly cost-effective in comparison with standard medical therapy but becomes relatively expensive when the benefits of aspirin or lipid-lowering therapy are added to medical treatment.", 
    "7": "Squalene synthase catalyzes the reductive dimerization of two molecules of farnesyl pyrophosphate to form squalene and is the first committed step in sterol synthesis. A specific inhibitor of squalene synthase would inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis but not prevent the formation of other products of the isoprenoid pathway, such as dolichol and ubiquinone. RPR 107393 [3-hydroxy-3-[4-(quinolin-6-yl)phenyl]-1-azabicyclo[2-2-2]octane dihydrochloride] and its R and S enantiomers are potent inhibitors of rat liver microsomal squalene synthase, with IC50 values of 0.6 to 0.9 nM. One hour after oral administration to rats, RPR 107393 inhibited de novo [14C]cholesterol biosynthesis from [14C]mevalonate in the liver with an ED50 value of 5 mg/kg. Diacid metabolites of [14C]farnesyl pyrophosphate were identified after acid treatment of the livers of these animals. These results support in vitro data demonstrating that these compounds are inhibitors of squalene synthase. In rats, RPR 107393 (30 mg/kg p.o. b.i.d. for 2 days) reduced total serum cholesterol by < or = 51%. In the same paradigm, the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor lovastatin failed to lower serum cholesterol in rats. In marmosets, RPR 107393 (20 mg/kg b.i.d.) reduced plasma cholesterol concentration by 50% after 1 week of administration; this was greater than the reduction observed with lovastatin or pravastatin, neither of which produced > 31% reduction in plasma cholesterol when administered for 1 week at a dose of 50 mg/kg b.i.d. The R and S enantiomers of RPR 107393 (20 mg/kg p.o. q.d. for 7 days) reduced plasma low density lipoprotein cholesterol by 50% and 43%, respectively, whereas high density lipoprotein cholesterol was unchanged. In summary, RPR 107393 is a potent inhibitor of squalene synthase. It is an orally effective hypocholesterolemic agent in rats and marmosets that has greater efficacy than lovastatin or pravastatin in the marmoset.", 
    "8": "We conducted an historical cohort study to evaluate the relative effectiveness of niacin and lovastatin in the treatment of dyslipidemias in patients enrolled in a health maintenance organization (HMO).", 
    "9": "To be eligible for this study, adults aged 18 years and older who were initially treated with either niacin or lovastatin between January 1, 1992, and December 31, 1993, were identified from pharmacy databases. Each potentially eligible member with a fasting lipid panel prior to initiation of drug therapy and with a second fasting lipid panel between 9 and 15 months after initiation of drug therapy was included in the study. A total of 244 patients treated with niacin and 160 patients treated with lovastatin had complete data and are subjects of this report.", 
    "10": "Patients initially treated with lovastatin had higher baseline mean cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels as well as higher rates of diabetes mellitus and heart disease than did patients initially treated with niacin. Lovastatin use was associated with a mean 25.8% decrease in LDL cholesterol, while niacin use was associated with a mean 17.5% drop in LDL cholesterol (t = 3.19, P < .002). Niacin use was associated with a 16.3% improvement in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, while HDL-cholesterol levels in the lovastatin group improved 1.5% (t = 4.74, P < .001). Niacin use was associated with an 18.4% improvement in triglycerides, while lovastatin use was associated with an 8% improvement in triglyceride levels (t = 2.81, P = .005). Differences in LDL/HDL ratio from before treatment to follow-up were no different in the two groups of patients (t = -1.21, P = .22). A total of 46% of patients initially treated with either drug reached their treatment goals in accordance with those set by the National Cholesterol Education Program. Drug discontinuation rates were 73% for niacin and 52% for lovastatin at follow-up, which averaged 10.7 months in each group.", 
    "11": "These results suggest that both niacin and lovastatin are effective in treating dyslipidemic patients in this care system, and that physicians appropriately use lovastatin more often for patients with higher baseline LDL levels and more comorbidity. The data also strongly suggest that establishing an organized, population-based approach to systematically identify, treat, and monitor patients with dyslipidemias may be the single most important intervention HMOs should consider for improving control of dyslipidemias on a population basis.", 
    "12": "This report describes an impaired sphincter of Oddi relaxation function in relation to hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia. As indicated by repetitive amyl nitrite-augmented quantitative hepatobiliary scintgraphy, normalization of serum lipids by means of diet and a 3-month treatment period with 20 mg of lovastatin per day resulted in an improvement of sphincter of Oddi relaxation.", 
    "13": "1. Recent studies (4S, CARE, WOSCOPS) with the HMG CoA reductase inhibitors have shown that reductions of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol reduce the risk for a new fatal or non-fatal cardiac event by approximately 30-35%, providing LDL is decreased by 25-35%. 2. Preliminary data also suggest that achieved LDL levels around 3.2 mmol/L results in no greater reduction in new events than when LDL is lowered even further. 3. There is considerable debate, nonetheless, as to whether these reduction in cardiovascular events are entirely a consequence of LDL reduction or whether the lipid-modifying agents have effects on lipoprotein structure, endothelial cell function, clotting and haemorrheological pathways. 4. The study results achieved with statins have obscured the role of fibrates as useful agents for reducing cardiovascular disease. Fibrates have a different mode of action to stains by reducing triglyceride-rich lipoprotein precursors and favourably altering LDL and HDL composition. 5. The practising clinician needs to consider the lipoprotein phenotype and to choose whether the ideal treatment is stain alone, fibrate alone or perhaps a combination.", 
    "14": "Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a common disease of aging men. Current medical treatment for this condition is only partially effective, therefore many patients must undergo surgery for symptomatic relief. BPH is caused by an increase in prostate epithelial and stromal cells, especially the latter. Since BPH stromal cells have a long life span and are not very responsive to androgen withdrawal, cultured BPH stromal cells were used to explore the feasibility of pharmacologically inducing apoptosis in these cells. We obtained BPH tissue during surgery, and stromal cells were isolated and maintained in culture. After cells achieved confluence, we induced apoptosis with the HMGCoA reductase inhibitor, lovastatin (30 micromol/L). The effects of testosterone (100 micromol/L), dihydrotestosterone (DHT; 100 micromol/L) and finasteride (100 micromol/L) on lovastatin-induced apoptosis were studied on cells grown in media containing charcoal stripped serum. Similarly, we examined the effect of the cholesterol pathway metabolites, mevalonic acid (30 micromol/L), geranyl geraniol (30 micromol/L), farnesol (10 micromol/L), squalene (30 micromol/L) and 7-ketocholesterol (3 micromol/L) on lovastatin-induced apoptosis. We demonstrated apoptosis by DNA laddering in agarose gels, by fluorescence microscopy following acridine orange staining, and by flow cytometry after end-labeling of DNA strand breaks with biotin-16-dUTP using deoxynucleotidyl exotransferase (TdT). Lovastatin at 30 micromol/L, but not at lower concentrations, induced apoptosis in BPH prostate stromal cells. This was seen (by flow cytometry) in 16.6 +/- 7.3% (mean +/- SD) of BPH cells treated with lovastatin at 72 h vs. 2.5 +/- 1.2% of cells treated with ethanol. Lovastatin-induced apoptosis was not increased in stripped serum or by the addition finasteride, and was not inhibited by testosterone or DHT. Only mevalonate and geranyl geraniol, prevented lovastatin-induced apoptosis whereas farnesol, squalene, or 7-ketocholesterol did not. We conclude that lovastatin can induce apoptosis in BPH stromal cells in vitro, and this is not affected by androgen withdrawal or stimulation. It is unlikely that lovastatin, per se, will be an effective treatment for BPH in vivo, but it does provide a means for inducing apoptosis in vitro. Understanding the apoptotic process in BPH stromal cells ultimately may lead to new therapeutic strategies for BPH.", 
    "15": "Atorvastatin is a synthetic HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor which lowers plasma cholesterol levels by inhibiting endogenous cholesterol synthesis. It also reduces triglyceride levels through an as yet unproven mechanism. Dose-dependent reductions in total cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and triglyceride levels have been observed with atorvastatin in patients with hypercholesterolaemia and in patients with hypertriglyceridaemia. In large trials involving patients with hypercholesterolaemia, atorvastatin produced greater reductions in total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, apolipoprotein B and triglyceride levels than lovastatin, pravastatin and simvastatin. In patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia, the combination of atorvastatin and colestipol tended to produce larger reductions in LDL-cholesterol levels and smaller reductions in triglyceride levels than atorvastatin monotherapy. Although atorvastatin induced smaller reductions in triglyceride levels and more modest increases in high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels than either fenofibrate or nicotinic acid in patients with combined hyperlipidaemia, it produced larger reductions in total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol. As with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, the most frequently reported adverse events associated with atorvastatin are gastrointestinal effects. In comparative trials, atorvastatin had a similar adverse event profile to that of other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Clinical data with atorvastatin are limited at present. However, with its ability to markedly reduce LDL-cholesterol levels, atorvastatin is likely to join other members of its class as a first-line agent for the treatment of patients with hypercholesterolaemia, if changes in lipid levels with atorvastatin convert to reductions in CHD mortality and morbidity. Atorvastatin may be particularly suitable for patients with heterozygous or homozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia because of the marked reductions in LDL-cholesterol experienced with the drug. Additionally, because of its triglyceride-lowering properties, atorvastatin appears to have the potential to become an appropriate treatment for patients with combined hyperlipidaemia or hypertriglyceridaemia.", 
    "16": "Beta-Carotene and lycopene are derived from plants, and they share similar initial synthetic pathway with cholesterol, which is synthesized in animal but not in plant cells. Thus, we sought to analyze the effect of carotenoids on macrophage cholesterol metabolism, in comparison to the effect of LDL cholesterol and of the cholesterol synthesis inhibitor, fluvastatin. In J-774 A. 1 macrophage cell line, the cellular cholesterol synthesis from [3H]-acetate, but not from [14C] mevalonate, was suppressed by 63% any by 73% following cell incubation with beta-carotene or lycopene (10 microM) respectively, in comparison to a 90% and 91% inhibition by LDL (100 micrograms of cholesterol), or by fluvastatin (10 micrograms/ml) respectively. However, unlike LDL derived cholesterol, which also suppresses macrophage LDL receptor activity, lycopene and beta-carotene augmented the activity of the macrophage LDL receptor, similarly to the effect of fluvasfatin. In agreement with these in vitro observations, dietary supplementation of tomato's lycopene (60 mg/day) to 6 males for a 3 months period resulted in a significant 14% reduction in their plasma LDL cholesterol concentrations. We thus conclude that dietary supplementation of carotenoids may act as moderate hypocholesterolemic agents, secondary to their inhibitory effect on macrophage 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A (HMGCoA) reductase, the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol synthesis.", 
    "17": "3 beta-Hydroxy-25,26,26,26,27,27,27-heptafluoro-5 alpha-cholestan-15-one (4) has been prepared as part of a program to synthesize 15-ketosterols that are not readily metabolized to cholesterol or side-chain oxygenated species. Saponification of 3 beta-acetoxy-5 alpha-chola-8(14),23-dien-15-one (5) followed by lithium-ammonia reduction with a bromobenzene quench gave 3 beta-hydroxy-5 alpha-chol-23-en-15-one (6). Addition of (CF3)2CFI to 6 in the presence of triethylborane gave an iodide preparation, which was reduced to 4 with tributyltin hydride (71% overall yield of 4 from 5). The 23-iodide preparations consisted of 6:1 mixtures of (23R)-3 beta-hydroxy-23-iodo-25,26,26,26,27,27,27-heptafluoro-5 alpha-cholestan-15-one (9a) and its C-23 epimer 9b with variable amounts of 4. Compound 4 was also prepared by lithium-ammonia reduction of the delta 8(14) analogs of 4 and iodides 9a and 9b. The presence of small amounts of 6 in the latter product suggested a side reaction involving cleavage of the C24-C25 bond with loss of a (CF3)2CF radical. Also prepared were 25,26,26,26,27,27,27-heptafluoro-5 alpha-cholestane-3 beta, 15 alpha-diol, its 15 beta epimer, the 7 alpha-methyl analog of 4, 3 beta-hydroxy-7 alpha-methyl-5 alpha-cholestan-15-one (16), and (25R)-3 beta,26-dihydroxy-5 alpha-cholestan-15-one. Full 1H and 13C-NMR data of high precision with complete signal assignments are given for all new compounds. Definitive 1H-NMR stereochemical assignments of the C-24 protons were established for most sterols with a C8H17 side chain based on analysis of the downfield H-24 resonance in a 750-MHz spectrum of 16. Detailed electron-impact mass spectral data are presented together with a summary of major fragmentation patterns for 15-hydroxy- and 15-ketosteroids with and without a delta 8(14) bond.", 
    "18": "The effects of 6 HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors: pravastatin, lovastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin, fluvastatin and cerivastatin were analyzed in cultured human smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells and myoblasts. In vascular smooth muscle cells, pravastatin was a much weaker inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis than the 5 other drugs which displayed equally strong inhibitory potency. The anti-proliferative effects of these 6 drugs were analyzed by measuring cell number and mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity (MTT assay) after 3 days of incubation. IC25 values for inhibition of proliferation were very similar among the 4 cell types and were in the following order of magnitude: pravastatin < lovastatin = simvastatin = atorvastatin = fluvastatin < cerivastatin. Only in the case of pravastatin was proliferation inhibited at lower concentration in smooth muscle cells than in the other cell types. Proliferation was also assessed by measuring DNA synthesis in these cells. A 3 day-incubation with 1 microM of pravastatin had no effect on this parameter in all 4 cell types. However, 1 microM of simvastatin or lovastatin caused either an inhibition (in smooth muscle cells and endothelial cells) or stimulation (in fibroblasts) of this process. The effects of simvastatin on cell number, mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity and DNA synthesis were counteracted by simultaneous mevalonate addition. Simvastatin treatment was also associated with a change in the post-translational modification of the ras protein in smooth muscle cells, probably by inhibition of its farnesylation. Moreover, simvastatin treatment blocked the PDGF and bFGF-induced DNA synthesis in synchronized smooth muscle cells, whereas it does not affect the fetal calf serum-induced DNA synthesis in synchronized fibroblasts, suggesting that simvastatin blocks various steps of the cell cycle and that this effect depends on the cell type and the growth signalling pathway activated.", 
    "19": "Although LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) is generally accepted to be a major risk factor for progression of atherosclerosis, the traditional measurement of LDL-C includes measurement of IDL. Little is known about the relationship between IDL and progression of atherosclerosis. Therefore, we investigated the association of plasma lipoprotein subclasses with progression of preintrusive carotid artery atherosclerosis in the Monitored Atherosclerosis Regression Study (MARS).", 
    "20": "MARS was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled serial arterial imaging trial conducted in subjects 37 to 67 years old with angiographically defined coronary artery disease. Analytical ultracentrifugation was used to determine lipoprotein subclasses, including LDL (Sf 0 to 12), IDL (Sf 12 to 20), VLDL (Sf 20 to 400), and HDL (F1.20 0 to 9) in 188 subjects. Subjects were randomized to a cholesterol-lowering diet plus placebo or lovastatin 80 mg/d. The outcome measure, the annual progression rate of the distal common carotid artery far wall intima-media thickness determined by high resolution B-mode ultrasonography, was determined at baseline and every 6 months on trial. When the major apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins were measured independently, IDL (r=.21, P<.005) but not VLDL (r=-.09, P=.24) or LDL (r=.09, P=.26) was associated with the progression of carotid artery intimamedia thickness.", 
    "21": "These data provide further evidence for the role of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins in the progression of atherosclerosis and support the evidence that indicates that the risk of atherosclerosis attributable to LDL-C may in part be the result of lipoproteins in the IDL fraction (Sf 12 to 20) that is included within the traditional measurements of LDL-C.", 
    "22": "Atherosclerosis and its consequences account for most of the morbidity and mortality in Western countries. It is a disease of the intima and primarily involves four cell types, i.e., endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells, monocytes and platelets. In recent years, knowledge on the cellular and molecular mechanisms of these cells and their alterations by cardiovascular risk factors and in atherosclerosis has greatly expanded. In particular, it has become clear that endothelial cells play a crucial role in the regulation of platelet function, coagulation, and vascular tone and structure. Interestingly, endothelial dysfunction occurs early, particularly if cardiovascular risk factors such as hyperlipidemia, hypertension and diabetes are present. This could lead to adhesion of circulating platelets and monocytes and increased accumulation of lipids in the intima, as well as increased contraction, migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. One of the enzymes with a key role in vascular homeostasis is angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE). ACE is located on the endothelial cell membrane and is responsible for the conversion of angiotensin I into angiotensin II, as well as for the breakdown of bradykinin. While the antihypertensive effect of ACE inhibitors probably contributes to their antiatherogenic effects, other mechanisms are likely to be of greater importance. These direct antiatherogenic effects attributable to ACE inhibition are related to their vasculoprotective properties, including antiproliferative and antimitogenic activity, effects on endothelial function, protection against plaque rupture, antithrombotic effects, and possible antioxidant properties. There is overwhelming evidence to demonstrate the beneficial effects of long-term ACE inhibitor treatment in heart failure, acutely for suspected myocardial infarction (MI), and following MI in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Hypercholesterolemia is a health risk, and epidemiological studies have shown a line between total cholesterol levels and the risk of cardiac events. Studies have shown that lowering the levels of total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol using HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors can result in a decrease in cardiac morbidity and mortality. Angiographic studies of coronary arteries have demonstrated a disparity between the decrease in cardiac events and the extent of regression of coronary artery lesions. Mechanisms other than the regression of coronary stenosis may therefore be important in the beneficial effect of cholesterol lowering. It may be of major importance that lipid-lowering therapy is associated with improved endothelial function and decreased platelet activity. Thus, both ACE inhibitors and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have vasculoprotective properties which may explain their beneficial effects on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.", 
    "23": "Pravastatin sodium, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, was administered to rats at 500 mg/kg, and the changes in several parameters concerning the metabolism of cholesterol in the liver were determined over 12 h. HMG-CoA reductase activity began to be induced 6 h after pravastatin dosage and continued to increase for an additional 6 h. A significant reduction of serum and liver microsomal cholesterol was observed only at 9 h. At this time point, the protein mass and activity of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase were significantly decreased by 31% and 34%, respectively. Hepatic low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor expression was not affected by pravastatin throughout the experimental period. These results suggest that, in rats, the compensatory mechanism to restore the cholesterol balance after depletion of liver cholesterol produced by a single administration of pravastatin might primarily depend on the induction of HMG-CoA reductase and might be facilitated by a reduction in cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase, without the induction of hepatic LDL receptor.", 
    "24": "The lipid-lowering effect of pravastatin on glomerulosclerosis was observed in nephrotic syndrome model, which was induced in rats by using repeated puromycin injections. The histologic changes of the model were similar to those of human focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Rats were divided into three groups, namely, normal control, nephropathy and nephropathy with pravastatin. Pravastatin was administered through gastric tube 6mg.kg-1.d-1 for 12 weeks. The lipoprotein profile and histologic development were observed. The results showed that pravastatin-treated rats had significantly lower cholesterol, triglycerides, very low density lipoprotein and high density lipoprotein than the nephropathy group at 7 weeks (P < 0.05). Moreover, the renal damage was also less marked in pravastatin-treated rats. Light microscopic and immunohistochemical examination revealed that lipid-lowering therapy was associated with significant lower level of glomerular sclerosing index and less accumulation of extracellular matrix including collagen III, IV, laminine and fibronectin as compared with the nephropathy group. However urinary protein and serum albumin levels were similar in both groups. It is suggested that lipid-lowering thyrapy may retard the progression of glomerulosclerosis and thus preserve renal function. The results imply that hyperlipoidemia plays an important role in the pathophysiological progression of renal disease.",

Forty-one patients completed the 10 week study. Eligibility for entrance into the study was determined by patient lipid profiles meeting the criteria for pharmacological intervention outlined by the National Cholesterol Education Program II guidelines. Patients were randomized into 2 groups: lovastatin 20 mg per day, or placebo. A registered dietitian counseled both groups on two visits during the study to ensure compliance with a low fat, low cholesterol diet.

    "34": "A 16 week, randomized, double-blind, parallel, placebo-controlled study was designed to determine the effects of low-dose pravastatin on cholesterol concentrations in patients with mild hypercholesterolemia and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Following a 6-to 8-week dietary run-in period, a mean serum total cholesterol (TC) level > 5.2 mmol/L (200 mg/dL), but < 7.8 mmol/L (300 mg/dL) was required for entry. Metabolic control of diabetes was determined by a hemoglobin Alc (HbAlc) level less than twice the upper limit of normal on two occasions. Eighty six (86) patients recruited in 5 French diabetic clinics, were randomized in a ratio of 1:1 (pravastatin 10 mg or placebo), and 74 completed the study. There were 12 discontinuations: 5 (11.6%) in the pravastatin group and 7 (16.3%) in the placebo group. Drop-out was due to an adverse event in 1 patient (2.3%) in the pravastatin group and in 5 patients (11.6%) in the placebo group. Thirty five (35) placebo patients and 14 pravastatin patients had their dose of treatment doubled at week 8: the dose of treatment was to be doubled at week 8 in the event of non-response to treatment (TC at week 7 > 5.2 mmol/L and TC decrease < 15% from baseline). At week 16, pravastatin lowered TC from 6.4 to 5.6 mmol/L (-13.8%, p < 0.001 versus placebo), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) from 4.3 to 3.4 mmol/L (-20.4%, p < 0.001 versus placebo) and slightly increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) from 1.18 to 1.25 mmol/L (+6.7%). Side effects were similar in both groups. Blood glucose control was not altered as assessed by serial HbAlc measurements which were unchanged during treatment. This study demonstrated that low-dose pravastatin is effective in lowering cholesterol levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia and NIDDM.", 
    "35": "A sensitive and specific method was developed and validated to quantitate lovastatin and its hydroxy acid in mouse and rat plasma. This method employs a solid-phase extraction procedure to isolate lovastatin and its hydroxy acid metabolite from the biological matrices (0.1 ml of mouse or rat plasma). The reconstituted extracts were analyzed by liquid chromatography/ionspray tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). Simvastatin and simvastatin hydroxy acid were used as internal standards for lovastatin and lovastatin hydroxy acid, respectively. The assay has a lower limit of quantitation (LLQ) of 0.50 ng ml-1 in mouse and rat plasma for both lovastatin and its hydroxy acid based on 0.1 ml aliquots of plasma. The intra- and inter-assay precision (RSD), calculated from quality control (QC) samples, was < 7% for lovastatin and < 6% for lovastatin hydroxy acid in both matrices. The inter-assay accuracy as determined from QC samples was less than 6% for lovastatin and less than 8% for lovastatin hydroxy acid in both matrices. The overall recovery of lovastatin was 54% in mouse plasma and 55% in rat plasma, and the overall recovery of lovastatin hydroxy acid was 100% in mouse plasma and 67% in rat plasma.", 
    "36": "The Monitored Atherosclerosis Regression Study was a double-blind, 2-year, placebo-controlled, randomized, serial angiographic trial which tested reduction of low density lipoprotein-cholesterol with monotherapy using lovastatin on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis. Angiographic outcome was evaluated both by a panel of human readers who visually inspected matched film pairs to arrive at a global change score and by automated computerized vessel edge finding and lesion measurement (quantitative coronary angiography, QCA). In this paper, we model the association between QCA measures of coronary artery lesion change and the panel-based global change score. QCA measures included: per-patient changes in percent diameter stenosis and minimum lumen diameter averaged over all lesions; per-patient changes in average diameter and percent involvement averaged over all segments; the numbers of progressing and regressing lesions and new total occlusions; and the development of any new lesions. We found that when evaluating coronary artery lesion change, panelists evaluate changes in percent diameter stenosis for both low grade (< 50% diameter stenosis at baseline) and high grade (> or = 50% diameter stenosis at baseline) lesions as well as new total occlusions and the number of progressing lesions. Although computerized quantification of the size of a lesion at baseline and as an endpoint may be a more precise measure than that by human panel interpretation, QCA fails to incorporate many other important aspects of coronary angiographic change visualized over the entire coronary artery tree by a panel of human interpreters. Thus, the global change score provides a \"multiple endpoint\" for coronary angiographic trials which does not suffer from the problems of statistical analysis and interpretation of multiple hypothesis tests which usually accompany true multiple endpoint measures. Choice of either or both endpoints in preparing angiographic trials depends on careful consideration of the desired information as well as the cost of carrying out the endpoint analysis.", 
    "37": "Plasma cholesterol and other lipoproteins play a significant role in the development of atherosclerosis and subsequent coronary heart disease (CHD). This 1 year study was designed to confirm the efficacy and safety of atorvastatin (Lipitor) compared to pravastatin, a marketed agent for low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction in hypercholesterolemic patients. Patients were recruited at 26 centers in six European countries. After a 6 week placebo baseline phase, patients were randomized to receive atorvastatin 10 mg or pravastatin 20 mg daily. The dose could be doubled at week 16, if LDL-C levels remained > or = 3.4 mmol/l (135 mg/dl). Atorvastatin significantly lowered LDL-C from baseline by 35% compared with 23% for pravastatin (P < 0.05). A total of 72% of atorvastatin patients attained the LDL-C target level of < 3.4 mmol/l, compared to 26% of pravastatin patients. Atorvastatin also significantly reduced TC, TG and apo B (P < 0.05). Safety was assessed by recording adverse events and measuring clinical laboratory parameters. The adverse event profile was similar for both treatment groups and neither treatment caused clinically relevant laboratory abnormalities. Atorvastatin 10 and 20 mg once daily is superior to pravastatin 20 and 40 mg once daily in treating patients with hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "38": "Hemodynamic changes associated with the lowering of total cholesterol (TC) by the water-soluble HMG-COA reductase inhibitor pravastatin were investigated in 59 patients with hypercholesterolemia (TC level at least 220 mg/dl) who received pravastatin therapy for 6 months. The patients were divided into two groups according to the reduction in TC: a > or = 15% reduction group and a < 15% reduction group. The changes in hemodynamics were compared before and after pravastatin treatment. No changes in blood pressure, heart rate or aortic damping factor were found in either group. However, significant decreases in pulse wave velocity and total peripheral resistance, and increase in cardiac output were seen in the > or = 15% reduction group. All these hemodynamic parameters remained unchanged in the < 15% reduction group. The 12 patients with a clear pravastatin-induced reduction in TC maintained over a 5-year period showed no changes in blood pressure, heart rate or aortic damping factor, but the reductions in pulse wave velocity and total peripheral resistance, and increase in cardiac output were maintained. These changes in hemodynamics were not dependent on aortic elasticity, and appeared to result from improved peripheral hemodynamics. Lowering of TC levels by pravastatin results in improvement in the peripheral endothelium-dependent vasodilation disorder associated with hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "39": "In a clinical trial, the changes in LDL cholesterol and in total apolipoprotein B with time were analyzed using a one-compartment model with constant input rate and first-order elimination rate constant after the initiation and discontinuation of treatment with atorvastatin. After initiation of treatment, input rate for total apoplipoprotein B (21 mg/dL/day) and elimination rate constants for both total apoplipoprotein B (0.36 days-1) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (0.24 days-1) were similar to those reported for LDL-apolipoprotein B at steady state during treatment with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. However, after discontinuation of treatment, very low elimination rate constants of 0.09 days-1 for LDL cholesterol and 0.07 days-1 for total apolipoprotein B are obtained. A likely explanation is that the model incorrectly assumes an immediate return to the pretreatment state, whereas transient stimulation of hepatic cholesterol synthesis on discontinuation of therapy with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors is known to occur.", 
    "40": "We have demonstrated previously in a subset of Monitored Atherosclerosis Regression Study (MARS) subjects with hypercholesterolemia (190 to 295 mg/dL) and documented coronary artery disease that lovastatin significantly reduces cholesterol-rich lipoprotein B (LpB) but has little effect on complex, triglyceride-rich apolipoprotein (apo) B-containing LpBc (the sum of LpB:C, LpB:C:E and LpA-II:B:C:D:E) particles defined by their apolipoprotein composition. This differential effect of lovastatin on apoB-containing lipoprotein families offered the opportunity to determine in the same subset of MARS subjects the independent relationship of LpB and LpBc with the progression of coronary artery disease. Subjects randomized to either lovastatin (40 mg twice daily) or matching placebo were evaluated by coronary angiography before randomization and after 2 years of treatment, and the overall coronary status was judged by a coronary global change score. In the lovastatin-treated group, there were 22 nonprogressors (69%) and 10 progressors (31%), while in the placebo group 13 subjects (42%) were nonprogressors and 18 (58%) were progressors (P < .03). In the lovastatin-treated group, lipid and lipoprotein parameters did not differ between progressors and nonprogressors except for LpBc and LpA-II:B:C:D:E particle levels, which were statistically higher in progressors (P = .02). In the placebo-treated group, progressors differed from nonprogressors by having significantly higher levels of triglycerides (P = .03) and apoC-III in VLDL + LDL (P = .05), the characteristic constituents of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins. In the placebo- and lovastatin-treated groups combined, progressors had significantly higher on-trial levels of triglycerides (P = .003), VLDL cholesterol (P = .005), apoC-III in VLDL + LDL (P = .008), apoC-III (P = .01), apoB (P = .03), and total cholesterol (P = .04) than nonprogressors. Even after adjustment for treatment group, progressors in the combined placebo- and lovastatin-treated groups had significantly higher levels of LpBc, LpA-II:B:C:D:E, triglycerides, and apoC-III in VLDL + LDL than nonprogressors. Progressors in the placebo-treated, lovastatin-treated, and combined treatment groups had lower levels of LpA-1 but not LpA-I:A-II than non-progressors, and this difference reached statistical significance (P = .047) in the combined sample adjusted for treatment group. Results of this study show that elevated levels of triglyceride-rich LpBc in general and LpA-II:B:C:D:E in particular contribute significantly to the progression of coronary artery disease. Furthermore, they provide additional evidence for the potentially protective role of LpA-I particles in the atherogenic process and suggest that apolipoprotein-defined lipoprotein families may be more specific prognosticators of coronary artery atherosclerosis progression than lipids and apolipoproteins.", 
    "41": "To evaluate the effect of pravastatin on progression of coronary atherosclerosis in normocholesterolemic patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), 90 patients with CAD and serum cholesterol levels of 160 to 220 mg/dl were randomized into a pravastatin (10 mg/day) group (n = 45) and control group (n = 45) in a 2-year study. The proportions of patients with progression (an increase of > or = 15% in percent stenosis) and regression (a decrease of > or = 15% in percent stenosis) of coronary atherosclerosis were compared between the 2 groups. Of 90 patients, 80 (89%) had a final angiogram: the pravastatin (n = 39) and control group (n = 41). Percent changes in total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and apoprotein B levels were significantly greater in the pravastatin group than in the control group (total cholesterol -11 +/- 12% vs 3 +/- 15%, p < 0.01; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol -18 +/- 16% vs 4 +/- 21%, p < 0.01; apoprotein B -5 +/- 20% vs 6 +/- 20%, p < 0.05). The proportion of patients with progression of coronary atherosclerosis was significantly smaller in the pravastatin group than in the control group (21% vs 49%, p < 0.05). The proportion of patients with disease regression did not differ in the 2 groups (3% vs 2%, p = NS). In conclusion, this study indicates that cholesterol-lowering therapy with pravastatin can prevent the progression of coronary atherosclerosis even in normocholesterolemic patients with established CAD.", 
    "42": "Initial trials hint that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may have a role in preventing or retarding the progression of AGAS. Whether the potential of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors to prevent AGAS is due to their lipid-lowering effect, immunomodulating properties, or a combination of both is also not completely known at present. Further study is needed to fully identify their mode of preventing AGAS and, more important, to determine their usefulness and role in preventing AGAS, especially since concurrent HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor use with cyclosporine is not innocuous. Potential for a pharmacokinetic drug interaction, which results in an elevation of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor concentrations, exists when these two agents are used together, thus increasing the potential for the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor to cause musculoskeletal complications. When such combination therapy is used, the likelihood of this interaction can be reduced by prescribing the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor conservatively--using the smallest effective dose and increasing the daily dosage slowly. Although the risk of musculoskeletal toxicity exists at any HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor dosage, most patients should be able to tolerate daily dosages of up to 20 mg of lovastatin, 10 mg of simvastatin, and 40 mg of pravastatin. Patients also need to be made aware of and monitored for musculoskeletal symptoms suggestive of myositis and/or myalgias. In addition, the avoidance of elevated cyclosporine concentrations and when practical, monitoring of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor concentrations are recommended.",

    "44": "New Zealand rabbits were fed purified diet (20% protein, 11% fat and 0.06% cholesterol) for 28 days. Animals received either 1.4 mg simvastatin or placebo orally during the last 14 days. A randomized 3 x 2 factorial design was used for the administration of diet and drug treatments.", 
    "45": "Mean food intake and body weight of the animals in all groups were similar. In placebo groups, soy protein decreased (p = 0.06) total cholesterolemia with significantly (p = 0.009) lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and significantly (p = 0.004) higher very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) triglycerides (TG), compared to animal proteins. Addition of low dose simvastatin to soy protein induced a further decrease of serum total cholesterol, decreased VLDL and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and LDL (apolipoprotein B), as well as improved VLDL-TG and HDL cholesterol levels. No similar reduction was seen when simvastatin was combined with casein or cod protein.",

Participants in the 4S were randomly assigned to double-blind treatment with simvastatin, 20 mg daily, with blinded dosage titration up to 40 mg daily, according to cholesterol response during the first 6-18 weeks, or placebo.

    "57": "Previously we have shown that cyclosporine inhibits low-density lipoprotein (LDL) catabolism in HepG2 cells. This inhibition mainly occurs through reduced LDL-receptor activity. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutarylcoenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors up-regulate LDL receptor activity with a subsequent increase in LDL uptake and degradation. In this study, in HepG2 cells, we investigated the effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors on cellular LDL catabolism in the presence of cyclosporine. Different concentrations of cyclosporine and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, which were within the range of therapeutic concentrations used in humans, were added to the culture medium and the cellular LDL receptor activity was then measured. The results show that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors reverse the down-regulatory effect of cyclosporine on LDL receptor activity, thus further supporting our previous findings and also providing a rationale for the already established treatment in cyclosporine-induced hypercholesterolemia with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.",

This combined fungicidal activity was confirmed by time-versus-killing studies.", 
    "59": "Combined hyperlipoproteinemia (CHL) can be difficult to treat because of the heterogeneous nature of the lipoprotein abnormalities. We compared the relative efficacies of simvastatin and gemfibrozil and sought predictors of responsiveness in terms of the baseline lipids and other potential metabolic determinants (plasma insulin, Lp(a) and apo E genotype). Sixty-six subjects entered a cross-over, randomized trial involving 12 weeks on each drug. Efficacy was assessed after 6 and 12 weeks on each treatment. Simvastatin lowered total cholesterol 24%, triglycerides 12%, LDL cholesterol 33%, raised HDL cholesterol 13% and substantially reduced the cholesterol:triglyceride ratio in VLDL and IDL. Gemfibrozil lowered total cholesterol 5%, triglycerides 44%, raised HDL 26% and reduced VLDL and IDL lipids more than simvastatin did. LDL size increased with both treatments and HDL size increased with simvastatin. Responsiveness (25% fall in cholesterol or 40% fall in triglycerides) was shown by 31/61 subjects when taking simvastatin (cholesterol-lowering) and by 44/60 taking gemfibrozil (triglyceride-lowering). Responsiveness was greatest in those with apo E2 genotype with both drugs (P < 0.05). Unexpectedly, responders to simvastatin tended to have lower baseline total cholesterol but higher triglyceride levels than those whose cholesterol or triglyceride was lowered by gemfibrozil. Nevertheless, more hypercholesterolemic subjects responded to simvastatin and more hypertriglyceridemic subjects to gemfibrozil. Lp(a) (P = 0.04) and plasma insulin concentrations (P = 0.03) were negative predictors of percentage triglyceride-lowering with gemfibrozil. The difference between the two drugs in triglyceride-lowering lessened with rising insulin and falling HDL cholesterol. Thus, the responsiveness to the two major classes of lipid lowering drugs can be partly predicted from baseline lipids and related metabolic parameters.", 
    "60": "The West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study recently demonstrated the benefits of pravastatin therapy in the prevention of coronary heart disease events in middle-aged hypercholesterolemic men without prior myocardial infarction. We present an analysis of the influence of baseline risk factors on coronary events and total mortality in the trial, and their interaction with therapy, using the Cox proportional hazards model. The multivariate predictors of fatal or nonfatal coronary events were treatment allocation (pravastatin or placebo), current smoking, diabetes mellitus, nitrate consumption, minor electrocardiographic abnormalities, angina pectoris, family history of premature coronary death, widowhood, blood pressure, and total cholesterol/high density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio. Independent of other risk factors, pravastatin reduced the risk of definite coronary heart disease death or nonfatal myocardial infarction by 32% (95% confidence interval 17 to 44, p = 0.0001), definite or suspected coronary heart disease death by 35% (3 to 56, p = 0.035), cardiovascular death by 33% (4 to 53, p = 0.027), coronary revascularization procedures by 38% (11 to 56, p = 0.009), and all-cause mortality by 24% (2 to 41, p = 0.037). The 5-year risk of fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction, calculated using the predictors identified in the Cox analysis, ranged from <4.4% in the lowest quartile of risk to >9.6% in the highest quartile. The proportional benefit achieved by pravastatin was independent of other risk factors; hence, the absolute benefit of therapy was greatest in subjects with the highest baseline risk. Such subjects can be identified easily in the population and deserve high priority for treatment.", 
    "61": "New evidence suggests an interaction between hyperlipidemia, activation of the renin-angiotensin system, and atherosclerotic disease. In patients with atherosclerosis and hyperlipidemia, coronary endothelial dysfunction is usually diffuse and affects vasomotor tone, platelet activity, thrombosis, fibrinolysis, and regulation of inflammatory cells. Angiotensin II, an important oxidant, alters the binding of low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol to its receptors and increases endothelial uptake of LDL. Endothelial dysfunction is worsened by the suppression of nitric oxide production and/or release via angiotensin II-associated degradation of bradykinin and oxygen free radical production, resulting in inadequate vasorelaxation. Therapy with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors appears to eliminate these untoward effects and may ameliorate the tendency for myocardial infarction associated with elevated plasma levels of angiotensin II. Although the role of ACE inhibitors in the prevention and/or treatment of coronary artery disease in patients without left ventricular dysfunction remains to be established, the capacity of ACE inhibition to correct endothelial dysfunction offers promise. The ability of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors to improve endothelial function, prevent the progression of coronary atherosclerosis, reduce the incidence of ischemic events, and improve survival is well known. Potentially, ACE inhibitors may have an additive or synergistic effect on the development of atherosclerosis and the clinical consequences of this disease when used in combination therapy with lipid-lowering strategies.", 
    "62": "Cholesterol-lowering therapy can improve cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with atherosclerosis.

    "63": "This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study evaluated the effect of simvastatin (20 mg daily for 4 weeks) on endothelium-dependent and endothelium-independent vasodilation and on the response to the inhibitor of nitric oxide synthesis, NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), in the forearm vasculature of subjects with moderate elevation of total serum cholesterol (6.0 to 10.0 mmol/L) by use of strain-gauge plethysmography. Studies were repeated after 3 more months of open therapy. When the results are expressed as percentage changes in flow in the infused arm relative to the noninfused arm, the vasodilator response to acetylcholine was significantly increased after 4 weeks of treatment with simvastatin (P < .0005), and this improvement was further enhanced after 3 months (P < .005). Concurrently, simvastatin augmented the vasoconstrictor response to L-NMMA, an effect that was maintained at 3 months (P < .0005). The response to the endothelium-independent vasodilator sodium nitroprusside was unaltered.",

Experimentally, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors reduces transplant arteriosclerosis. Whether this is linked to an immunosuppressive effect or not is unknown.

    "66": "Biotransformation of cerivastatin, a new cholesterol-lowering drug, by human liver microsomes was investigated using the 14C-labeled drug. Metabolite profiles were established by HPLC and structures of metabolites were elucidated. Two metabolic pathways were equally important, demethylation of the benzylic methyl other and hydroxylation at one methyl group of the 6-isopropyl substituent. The product of combined hydroxylation and demethylation was observed as a minor metabolite. During sample preparation the lactone forms of both primary metabolites were isolated in small amounts. Detailed structural analysis by NMR and LC-ESI-MS showed that hydroxylation occurred with high regio- and stereoselectivity. The proposed structures were confirmed by chemical synthesis of enantiomerically pure reference compounds. Microsomes from a human lymphoblastoid AHH-1 cell line, stably expressing CYP 3A4, catalyzed the demethylation reaction. Upon incubation of cerivastatin with human liver microsomes in the presence of the specific CYP 3A inhibitor TAO, both hydroxylation and demethylation were considerably reduced. This indicates that CYP 3A enzymes play a major role in cerivastatin metabolism.", 
    "67": "Manipulation of cholesterol metabolism open several possibilities of interfering with the growth of malignant cells. Deprivation of cholesterol decreases the velocity of growth and alters the composition of the cell membrane. The high requirement for LDL of malignant cells can be utilized for drug targeting. Proliferation assays were performed with neuroblastoma cells and cell lines of acute myeloid leukemia deprived of cholesterol by inhibition of HMG-CoA-reductase or culture in LDL-deficient medium. The cholesterol content of the cell membrane when reduced to 50% had no effect on the toxicity of LAK-cells but the toxicity of the fluorescent dye merocyanine MC 540 was enhanced two-fold. LDL-mediated drug targeting to AML cells was performed with oxidized LDL and showed toxic reactions. These results proved that cholesterol deprivation could be used to support some therapeutic approaches.", 
    "68": "1. The aim of this study was to determine whether BAYw6228 (BAYw), a newly developed 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, could suppress an atherogenic process such as intimal thickening by a mechanism other than lowering the level of serum cholesterol. 2. First, we evaluated the in vitro effect of BAYw on the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMC) from various species: Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. New Zealand (NZ) white rabbits, intimal cells from Watanabe hereditary hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbit and SMC from the new-born human aorta. The increasing rate of total protein content of these cells was inhibited by the addition of BAYw in a dose-dependent fashion. In the presence of 2% foetal calf serum (FCS), the value of IC50 was 1.0 microM in SD rats, 2.1 microM in NZ white rabbits, and 0.3 microM in WHHL rabbits. With human SMC, the value was 0.02 microM in the presence of 10% FCS and 0.2 microM with a mixture of growth factors. 3. Based on these above in vitro findings, we next examined the in vivo effect of the agent to determine whether it could suppress rabbit intimal thickening induced by balloon catheterization. A balloon catheter was inserted from a peripheral branch of the left external carotid artery to the aorta to denude the endothelium of the left common carotid artery in Japanese white rabbits. After 12 days they were divided into control and BAYw groups. The former were subcutaneously injected with saline and the latter with BAYw 1 mg kg-1 day-1. Two days after the beginning of treatment, a second balloon injury was performed to the previously injured left common carotid artery in both groups. After another two weeks, the left common carotid artery was removed and variously stained. Although the total serum cholesterol in the BAYw group was significantly lower than in the control (P < 0.05), the difference was not enough to affect intimal thickening. In addition, the BAYw group had a smaller intima/media ratio than the control group, decreasing to 45% of control (P < 0.05). By anti-alpha smooth muscle actin antibody staining, these intimal thickening areas were entirely occupied by SMCs, and their amount was attenuated by BAYw. By anti-rabbit macrophage antibody (RAM 11) staining, the number of positive cells in the intimal thickening was markedly decreased in the BAYw group compared to control (P < 0.01). 4. These results indicate that BAYw has an inhibitory effect on intimal thickening by attenuating intimal SMC proliferation and infiltration of macrophages, suggesting that BAYw could be effective in the prevention of the progression of atherosclerotic plaque-like restenosis after angioplasty.", 
    "69": "The objective of this open trial was to investigate the efficacy and safety of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor fluvastatin in hypercholesterolemic patients already receiving probucol. All of the participants had hypercholesterolemia. i.e. serum total cholesterol > or = 220 mg/dl, despite administration of probucol, 500 mg/day, for more than 4 weeks. After this, fluvastatin, 30 mg/day, was added to probucol treatment for 12 weeks. Twenty-seven patients were recruited into this study; all were evaluated for safety, and 22 were evaluated for efficacy. The addition of fluvastatin to the probucol regimen produced a significant further reduction in serum total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations (of 18 and 20%, respectively; p < 0.001); these effects were fully established within 4 weeks of treatment and were maintained throughout the treatment. Fluvastatin did not affect the serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration. Fluvastatin treatment decreased serum triglyceride concentrations slightly in all patients (not significant); in patients with hypertriglyceridemia, triglyceride levels were decreased significantly by 34% (p < 0.01; serum triglycerides > or = 150 mg/dl). In addition, fluvastatin significantly decreased serum apolipoprotein B, C-II, C-III and E levels, whereas serum apolipoprotein A-I and A-II levels were unaffected. One patient complained of slight abdominal discomfort during fluvastatin administration, but relationship to fluvastatin remains unclear. One patient had slight elevation of the serum alanine aminotransferase level, and another patient had an elevated gamma-glutamyl transferase level. The addition of fluvastatin to probucol treatment can be considered to be an effective and well tolerated treatment in hypercholesterolemic patients.", 
    "70": "We examined the effects of different combinations of beta 1-selective adrenoceptor blockers and lipid-lowering drugs, on fat metabolism and fatigue during moderate intensity exercise in 14 healthy young volunteers.", 
    "71": "The study was a randomized crossover design, each subject completing 5, 90 min walks at 50% of predetermined maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max), one following each 3 day treatment period with either: atenolol 100 mg and bezafibrate 400 mg, atenolol 100 mg and fluvastatin 40 mg, metoprolol CR 100 mg and bezafibrate 400 mg, metoprolol CR 100 mg and fluvastatin 40 mg, or placebo.", 
    "72": "Plasma free fatty acid (FFA) concentration during exercise was significantly reduced on all treatments, in comparison with placebo, P = 0.0001. Following 90 min of exercise FFA levels were as follows: placebo 573 mumol l-1 (105-1041), metoprolol CR + fluvastatin 277 mumol l-1 (0-647), metoprolol CR + bezafibrate 182 mumol l-1 (0-396), atenolol + fluvastatin 211 mumol l-1 (0-511), and atenolol + bezafibrate 123 mumol l-1 (0-352). Total fat oxidation during exercise was also reduced on all treatments in comparison with placebo: 38.1% (2-74), compared with 29.1% (0-61) on metoprolol CR + fluvastatin, P = 0.02, 26.2% (2-51) on metoprolol CR + bezafibrate, P = 0.002, 25.5% (3-48) on atenolol + fluvastatin, P = 0.009, and 22.8% (0-47) on atenolol + bezafibrate treatment, P = 0.0002. Plasma ammonia concentration was elevated on all treatments during exercise in comparison with placebo. After 90 min of exercise, plasma ammonia levels were as follows: placebo 37 mumol l-1 (0-84), metoprolol CR + fluvastatin 56 mumol l-1 (2-110), metoprolol CR + bezafibrate 79 mumol l-1 (0-167), atenolol + fluvastatin 90 mumol l-1 (10-170), and atenolol + bezafibrate 100 mumol l-1 26-174). In comparison with placebo, metoprolol CR + fluvastatin had the least adverse impact on measures of perceived exertion and the 'feeling scale' during exercise. Metoprolol CR + bezafibrate, atenolol + fluvastatin, and atenolol + bezafibrate treatments had greater adverse effects, particularly on perceived 'cardiorespiratory effort' and 'feeling scale' scores.", 
    "73": "In healthy volunteers, combinations of beta 1-selective blockers and lipid-lowering drugs were associated with significant reductions in fat metabolism, increased plasma ammonia levels, and raised the perception of effort during exercise, in comparison with placebo. Metoprolol CR + fluvastatin had the least effect, combinations metoprolol CR + bezafibrate and atenolol + fluvastatin had intermediate effects, and atenolol + bezafibrate had the most adverse effect.", 
    "74": "A single 300-mg intraperitoneal injection of poloxamer 407 (P-407) to rats produces a marked hypercholesterolemia for a minimum of 96 hours and increases the activity of hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase compared with the enzyme activity found in microsomal homogenates of control animals. We attempted to determine whether inhibition of microsomal HMG-CoA reductase by pravastatin sodium would yield similar values for the maximum reaction in velocity (Vmax) and the HMG-CoA reductase-pravastatin dissociation constant (Ki) when the enzyme was in the activated state compared with the control state. Knowledge of the respective values for Vmax and Ki would allow us to determine whether P-407-induced hypercholesterolemia in the rat was refractory to pravastatin treatment. Over a pravastatin concentration range of 0.5-50 nM, enzyme activity in vitro decreased as the drug's concentration increased. A standard Dixon plot of mean values of reciprocal reaction velocity versus pravastatin concentration yielded Ki of 3.7 and 4.1 nM for the control and activated states, respectively. The Vmax for conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate in vitro in the presence of pravastatin was 3.5-fold greater when assayed in microsomal homogenates obtained from P-407-injected rats compared with control animals. Dixon plot analysis of the data resulted in Vmax of 58.1 and 202 pmol.min-1.mg-1 for the control and activated states, respectively. These data suggest that whereas the Vmax is affected, injection of P-407 to rats does not alter the binding affinity of pravastatin for receptor(s) contained in HMG-CoA reductase as reflected by similar Ki values. This experimental animal model may be an additional screen with which to rank order the relative potency of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors by determining the drug's effectiveness when HMG-CoA reductase is in an activated state.", 
    "75": "Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells express lower low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor activity and higher 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase activity than normal mononuclear blood cells indicating that CLL cells may depend on cholesterol synthesis for their proliferation. We studied the effects of competitive inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase on malignant lymphocyte proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Tumor B-cells from 13 patients with CLL, hairy cell leukemia, or immunoblastic B-cell lymphoma were cultured for 4 d in the presence of B-cell mitogens and cholesterol synthesis inhibitors. Simvastatin and lovastatin suppressed, in a concentration-dependent manner, the mitogen-induced cellular thymidin uptake in medium with 10% human AB-serum or lipoprotein-deficient serum. Pravastatin was active only in medium with lipoprotein-deficient serum. Ten previously untreated patients with CLL received simvastatin orally, 40 mg daily for 12 wk. Mean reductions in total plasma and LDL cholesterol were 30% (range 9-46%) and 37% (range 16-63%), respectively. Cells from four patients showed moderate to minor increases in the degradation rate of 1251-LDL suggesting that the need for exogenous cholesterol had increased, three patients showed an increase in HMG-CoA reductase activity, and the cells from one patient showed both. There was no significant change in the clinical disease status during medication. However, four of the ten patients developed a therapy-demanding progressive disease during the subsequent year. Further clinical studies with cholesterol synthesis inhibitors in leukemia are warranted.", 
    "76": "The efficacy and safety of hydroxymethylglutaric coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statins) in the treatment of hyperlipidemia were evaluated in 12 infants and children with steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome followed prospectively for 1 to 5 years. All patients experienced a hypolipidemic response with a marked reduction in their total cholesterol (40%), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (44%), and triglyceride levels (33%), but no appreciable change in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Statin therapy was well tolerated without clinical or laboratory adverse effects. In spite of a significant hypolipidemic response to statin therapy there were no changes observed in the degree of proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, or in the rate of progression to chronic renal failure. Long-term controlled studies with statin therapy are needed to further document or negate their renoprotective role in refractory nephrotic syndrome.", 
    "77": "The 5' end of the mRNA-encoding sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) exists in two forms, designated 1a and 1c. The divergence results from the use of two transcription start sites that produce two separate 5' exons, each of which is spliced to a common exon 2. Here we show that the ratio of SREBP-1c to 1a transcripts varies markedly among organs of the adult mouse. At one extreme is the liver, in which the 1c transcript predominates by a 9:1 ratio. High 1c:1a ratios are also found in mouse adrenal gland and adipose tissue and in human liver and adrenal gland. At the other extreme is the spleen, which shows a reversed 1c:1a ratio (1:10). In five different lines of cultured cells, including the HepG2 line derived from human hepatocytes, the 1a transcript predominated (1c:1a ratio < 1:2). In mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, the 1a transcript was present, but the 1c transcript was not detectable. When these cells were differentiated into adipocytes by hormone treatment in culture, the amount of 1a transcript rose markedly (8.2-fold), and the 1c transcript remained virtually undetectable. We conclude that the SREBP-1a and 1c transcripts are controlled independently by regulatory regions that respond differentially to organ-specific and metabolic factors.", 
    "78": "Erythrocyte deformation is an important regulatory factor of the microcirculation. The present study was designed to examine whether erythrocyte deformability is altered in hypercholesterolemic patients and, if so, whether cholesterol-lowering therapy affects this parameter in these patients. The erythrocyte deformability of 37 hypercholesterolemic patients was evaluated before and after 1 year of therapy with pravastatin, an inhibitor of hepatic hydroxymethyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase, under various shear stresses (4.7, 9.5, 23.6, 47.3, 118.1, and 236.2 dyne/cm2) using laser diffractometry. At study entry, erythrocyte deformability under 4.7 and 9.5 dyne/cm2 shear stress, which is actually observed in human vessels, was reduced compared with that in 20 age-matched normocholesterolemic subjects and was inversely correlated with serum cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Pravastatin therapy for 1 year, which reduced serum cholesterol from 288 +/- 28 to 223 +/- 20 mg/dL, significantly improved erythrocyte deformability by approximately 20%. There was a significant relation between the improvement of erythrocyte deformability and the reduction of serum cholesterol or LDL cholesterol. The results suggest that erythrocyte deformability is reduced in hypercholesterolemic patients, and that long-term cholesterol-lowering therapy can improve reduced erythrocyte deformability, which may contribute to the improvement of organ perfusion.", 
    "79": "We studied an extended family of similar genetic and environmental background to determine whether there is a difference in response to statin therapy in those subjects with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH Afrikaner-1 (FH1) or FH Afrikaner-2 (FH2)) compared to those with familial defective apo B-100 (FDB), or both FH plus FDB. Fasting lipid profiles and Lp(a) levels were done on 18 members of the family and then repeated following 6 weeks of therapy with simvastatin 20 mg daily. Statin therapy reduced LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) by 31% in those with FH (n = 7); 29.8% in FDB (n = 5) and 25.4% in those with both FDB and FH (n = 5). There was no response to statin therapy in the single subject with both FH1, FH2, as well as FDB. Lp(a) levels did not change significantly either within or between any of the groups following statin therapy (FH from 6.5 (1.2-72.3) to 5.3 (1.2-52.3), FDB from 6.1 (4.70-71) to 8.2 (5.7 79) and FDB plus FH from 4.5 (2.6-17.4) to 3.1 (1.9-24) mg/dl). Statins are equally effective in lowering LDL-C in related subjects with heterozygous FH, FDB or both FDB plus FH. The ability of statins to lower LDL-C in FDB is probably due to increased hepatic uptake of lipoprotein precursors of LDL that can bind via apo E receptors. Lp(a) concentration is not reduced by drugs that stimulate LDL receptor activity implying that LDL receptors do not contribute greatly to normal clearance of Lp(a) in hypercholesterolaemic subjects with defects in receptor-mediated endocytosis of LDL.", 
    "80": "The metabolism of 25-hydroxycholesterol in different cell types was studied and the role of 7 alpha-hydroxylation for the effect of 25-hydroxycholesterol on the activity of HMG-CoA reductase was determined. Human diploid fibroblasts (HDF) and the human melanoma cell line SK-MEL-2 converted 25-hydroxycholesterol into 7 alpha,25-dihydroxycholesterol and 7 alpha,25-dihydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one while the virus-transformed fibroblast line 90VA-VI, the colon carcinoma cell line WiDr and the breast cancer cell line MDA-231 did not express 7 alpha-hydroxylase activity. The 7 alpha-hydroxylation of 25-hydroxycholesterol in HDF could be stimulated by dexamethasone and cortisol and inhibited by metyrapone. An unidentified, possibly 4-hydroxylated, metabolite was formed by 90VA-VI cells and a polar, probably conjugated, metabolite was formed by WiDr cells. The 7 alpha-hydroxylated metabolites of 25-hydroxycholesterol suppressed the activity of HMG-CoA reductase to a similar extent as 25-hydroxycholesterol in HDF but not in 90VA-VI cells, while the 7 alpha-hydroxylated metabolites of 27-hydroxycholesterol suppressed the activity of HMG-CoA reductase also in 90VA-VI cells. The suppression of HMG-CoA reductase activity by 25- and 27-hydroxycholesterol was decreased or abolished by dehydroepiandrosterone or pregnenolone which have little or no effect on the 7 alpha-hydroxylation. The results indicate that 7 alpha-hydroxylation is not directly involved, positively or negatively, in the action of 25- or 27-hydroxycholesterol as suppressors of HMG-CoA reductase activity.", 
    "81": "Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CKIs) p21, p27, p16, and p15 are an essential and integral part of cell cycle regulation. Studies on the expression of these inhibitors in normal versus tumor human breast cancer cells revealed that although p27 and p16 are expressed at higher levels in tumor cells, p21 and p15 expression were higher in normal cells. Analysis on the expression pattern of these proteins throughout the cell cycle in synchronized cells demonstrated a substantial increase in p21 during the S-phase in normal cells and barely detectable expression of p21 in any phase of the tumor cell cycle. Levels of p15, p16, and p27 remained relatively constant throughout the cell cycle of normal and tumor cells. Synchronization of tumor cells by lovastatin, which arrests cells in G1, resulted in increased levels of p21 and p27 with a concomitant decrease in cyclin-dependent kinase 2-associated kinase activity. Synchronization of cells by double-thymidine block did not result in the induction of p21 or p27. These observations suggest that lovastatin causes a profound cell cycle-independent alteration of CKI expression which is distinct from growth factor deprivation or thymidine block.", 
    "82": "Oxidized low density lipoproteins (OxLDL) are toxic to cells of the arterial wall and trigger the expression of the inducible form of hsp 70 in cultured endothelial cells (EAhy-926) and smooth muscle cells (HUVSMC). The latter response is believed to protect cells from toxicity since heat shock protein 70 (hsp70) is synthesized by cells under stress condition to protect proteins from irreversible denaturation. Simvastatin (10(-8) M to 10(-5) M), a competitive inhibitor of hydroxy methyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), a key enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, enhanced the toxicity of OxLDL (300 micrograms/mL) to endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells in a dose-dependent manner, as detected by 3H-adenine release and the MTT test. In EAhy, 3H-adenine release with OxLDL was 0.419 +/- 0.048 (ratio of radioactivity released in the medium to total radioactivity) versus 0.337 +/- 0.008 of control; in the presence of simvastatin and OxLDL this value increased from 0.49 +/- 0.01 at 10(-8) M to 0.918 +/- 0.001 at 10(-5) M with simvastatin alone (10(-5) M) this value was 0.463 +/- 0.025. Furthermore simvastatin reduced in a dose-dependent manner the expression of hsp 70 triggered by OxLDL, as detected by immunoblotting. To address whether this finding was due to the effect of simvastatin on the cholesterol pathway, mevalonate (100 microM) was used to bypass the HMG-CoA reductase block. This compound completely prevented the enhancement of OxLDL toxicity by simvastatin and restored the expression of hsp70. To verify whether cholesterol synthesis was required for the induction of hsp70 by OxLDL, squalestatin I (25 nM to 100 nM), an inhibitor of squalene synthase, another key enzyme of the cholesterol pathway, was used: OxLDL toxicity and hsp70 expression were not affected by this compound. These results indicate that simvastatin increases OxLDL cytotoxicity in vitro with a concomitant decrease of hsp70 expression triggered by OxLDL and that the key step in the cholesterol synthesis responsible for these effects must be between mevalonate and squalene formation.", 
    "83": "To determine the in vivo activity of BAYw6228 (BAYw), a newly developed 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, we examined its effect on balloon catheterization-induced carotid arterial intimal thickening in Japanese white rabbits. In all rabbits weighing approximately 3.5 kg, a balloon catheter was inserted from a peripheral branch of the left external carotid artery to the aorta in order to denude the endothelium of the left common carotid artery. At day 12, they were divided into control and BAYw groups. The latter were subcutaneously injected with BAYw, 1 mg/kg/day, for the following 17 days. At day 15, the second balloon catheterization was performed in the same left common carotid artery in both groups. After another two weeks, the left common carotid artery was removed and stained with Elastica-Masson (EM) and anti-rabbit macrophage antibody (RAM 11). With RAM 11 staining, the number of positive cells in the intimal thickening was markedly decreased in the BAYw group compared with the control group (P < 0.01). Compared with the area ratio of the thickened intima/media layer of the control group, that of the BAYw group was significantly decreased to 45% (P < 0.05). These results indicate that BAYw prevents accumulation of macrophages and consequently contributes to the inhibition of intimal thickening induced by balloon catheterization.", 
    "84": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the cholesterol-lowering and antiatherosclerotic effect of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor pravastatin sodium at a dosage comparable to human therapy. Twelve heterozygous WHHL rabbits (13 months old) were fed 100 g per day of a low cholesterol (0.03%) enriched diet for 12 months. Six of these animals also received pravastatin sodium at a daily dose of 1 mg/kg body weight (verum group). In the verum group, total plasma cholesterol levels were lower by 47%(P < 0.05) and relative aortic plaque volume (% ratio of total plaque volume to the aortic lumen) was reduced by 78% (P < 0.05), when compared to the control group. Plaque composition was analysed at 30 cross-sectional levels of the entire aortic wall using a grid window. Compared to the control group, the plaque type, in terms of architecture and composition, was altered as follows: lesions in the verum group had no confluent atheromatous cores and showed a pattern of a diffuse mixture of the main plaque components with a decreased relative content of necrosis (-44%) and an increased relative content of smooth muscle cells (+19%), whereas the relative content of macrophage-derived foam cells and collagen were nearly unaffected. Furthermore, a similar plaque volume and type was observed in animals with comparable cholesterol profiles. There was no histologic evidence for structurally damaging effects of pravastatin sodium on the arterial wall. We conclude that pravastatin sodium reduces total plasma cholesterol levels in this animal model, thereby leading to smaller plaques and a different plaque type.", 
    "85": "Crilvastatin, a new drug from the pyrrolidone family, has been previously shown to inhibit the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, in vitro and in vivo, to reduce the absorption of dietary cholesterol and to stimulate the activity of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase in the rat. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of crilvastatin on cholesterol and bile acid metabolism in the hamster. In hamsters fed on a lithogenic diet for 8 weeks, crilvastatin treatment (200 mg/day per kg body weight) did not change plasma lipid levels, failed to improve bile parameters and did not prevent gallstone formation. In hamsters fed on a basal cholesterol-rich (0.2%) diet for 8 weeks, crilvastatin at the same dose reduced the cholesterol level in the plasma by 20%, with a decrease of both low-density and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The drug did not significantly stimulate the biliary secretion of bile acids but significantly decreased the activity of acyl coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase in the small intestine by 64%. This effect was enhanced when cholestyramine, a bile acid-sequestering resin, was given in combination with crilvastatin. Crilvastatin alone did not change the activity of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase in the liver, despite the marked reduction in both hepatic cholesterogenesis and intestinal absorption of dietary cholesterol (the absorption coefficient was 44 +/- 2% in treated hamsters vs. 61 +/- 7% in controls).", 
    "86": "Hypercholesterolemia is associated with accelerated atherosclerosis in transplant recipients. It has been notoriously difficult to treat pharmacologically due to the complex interactions that occur with lipid-lowering drugs and immunosuppressive therapies. The purpose of the current study was to compare the efficacy and safety of a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (lovastatin, 20 mg/d) with a fibric acid derivative (gemfibrozil, 600 mg twice a day). We used a randomized, crossover design in 18 solid organ transplant recipients who followed the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Guidelines diet for 8 weeks and had persistent elevations of total cholesterol (>240 mg/dL). Each patient received each therapy for a minimum of 8 weeks (mean 14.2 +/- 2.4, range 8-20 weeks). The participants had stable allograft function and were treated with a standard immunosuppressive regimen containing cyclosporine, prednisone, and azathioprine. Lovastatin therapy reduced the mean total cholesterol by 15.5% (271.9 mg/dL to 229.9 mg/dL; p = 0.02) and the mean low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 22.7% (178.2 mg/dL to 137.8 mg/dL; p = 0.07). There were no significant changes in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol or triglycerides. Conversely, when these same patients were treated with gemfibrozil, the mean total cholesterol decreased by 7.9% (271.9 mg/dL to 250.5 mg/dL; p = NS) and the LDL cholesterol decreased by 5.1% (178.2 mg/dL to 169.1 mg/dL; p = NS). In addition, the mean triglyceride concentration decreased significantly by 46.1% (234.0 mg/dL to 126.3 mg/dL; p = 0.002) and the mean HDL cholesterol increased 15.4% (48.8 mg/dL to 56.3 mg/dL; p = 0.09). In all patients, the serum creatinine, hepatocellular enzymes, and creatinine phosphokinase remained stable. Lovastatin was discontinued in three patients for myalgias, one patient with unexplained anemia, and one patient with parasthesias. These results suggest that lovastatin and gemfibrozil are both safe and efficacious in transplant patients. However, neither therapy alone completely corrects abnormalities of high LDL cholesterol and low HDL cholesterol in transplant recipients.", 
    "87": "The high prevalence of hypercholesterolemia (HCh) in kidney transplant recipients probably contributes to the high cardiovascular mortality of these patients. Additionally, HCh is a contributing factor to the progression of renal failure. We conducted a prospective, randomised study with low dose Lovastatin in 42 kidney transplant recipients during 32 weeks, focusing on side effect and kidney function 42 consecutive patients with kidney transplanted in our Institute, with stable renal function (creatinine level < 160 mmol/l) treated with ciclosporine, azathioprine, prednisone were enrolled for the study (regardless of the initial cholesterol level). Every second patient was given Lovastatin 20 mg/night. In the Lovastatin group total cholesterol (TC) and LDL concentration were significantly lower after 6 months of treatment (TC was reduced from 242.5 +/- 12.8 to 220 +/- 15.4 mg/dl, p < 0.05) in Lovastatin group whereas in control group it increased nonsignificantly. Similarly LDL in Lovastatin group decreased from 140.0 +/- 7.0 to 121.3 +/- 10.8 mg/dl, p < 0.02 whereas in control group it increased from 143.6 +/- 5.4 to 169.9 +/- 10.3 mg/dl, p < 0.01. HDL and trigliceride concentrations were unchanged. The Lovastatin treatment did not results in more adverse events than the placebo treatment. Notably, the tendency to increase creatinine level in Lovastatin group was observed from 1.59 +/- 0.17 to 1.74 +/- 0.22 in Lovastatin group versus 1.89 +/- 0.22 to 2.21 +/- 0.35 mg/dl (NS). Low dose Lovastatin treatment seems to be safe and efficient cholesterol-lowering procedure. However we did not observe beneficial effect on kidney graft function.", 
    "88": "2,3-Oxidosqualene:lanosterol cyclase (OSC, E.C. 5.4.99.7) represents a unique target for a cholesterol lowering drug. Partial inhibition of OSC should reduce synthesis of lanosterol and subsequent sterols, and also stimulate the production of epoxysterols that repress HMG-CoA reductase expression, generating a synergistic, self-limited negative regulatory loop. Hence, the pharmacological properties of Ro 48-8.071, a new OSC inhibitor, were compared to that of an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, simvastatin. Ro 48-8.071 blocked human liver OSC and cholesterol synthesis in HepG2 cells in the nanomolar range; in cells it triggered the production of monooxidosqualene, dioxidosqualene, and epoxycholesterol. It was safe in hamsters, squirrel monkeys and G\u00f6ttingen minipigs at pharmacologically active doses, lowering LDL approximately 60% in hamsters, and at least 30% in the two other species, being at least as efficacious as safe doses of simvastatin. The latter was hepatotoxic in hamsters at doses > 30 mumol/kg/day limiting its window of efficacy. Hepatic monooxidosqualene increased dose-dependently after treatment with Ro 48-8.071, up to approximately 20 micrograms/g wet liver or less than 1% of hepatic cholesterol, and it was inversely correlated with LDL levels. Ro 48-8.071 did not reduce coenzyme Q10 levels in liver and heart of hamsters, and importantly did not trigger an overexpression of hepatic HMG-CoA reductase, squalene synthase, and OSC itself. In strong contrast, simvastatin stimulated these enzymes dramatically, and reduced coenzyme Q10 levels in liver and heart. Altogether these findings clearly differentiate the OSC inhibitor Ro 48-8.071 from simvastatin, and support the view that OSC is a distinct key component in the regulation of the cholesterol synthesis pathway.", 
    "89": "The aim of this study was to evaluate the lipid-lowering effect of acipimox as compared to pravastatin in patients with combined hyperlipidemia. One hundred and six subjects, all males, aged 18-60 years, with total cholesterol (TC) > or = 200 mg/dl, TC/HDL-C ratio > or = 5, triglycerides (TG) > or = 200 and > or = 350 mg/dl were randomized to receive acipimox 250 mg thrice daily or pravastatin 20 mg once daily for 3 months, according to a double-blind, double-dummy design. After a 1-month wash-out period patients were crossed to the alternative regimen for further 3 months. Prior to and at the end of each treatment period, TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, TG, blood glucose, and fibrinogen were evaluated. Both acipimox and pravastatin significantly decreased TC, LDL-C, TC/HDL-C ratio and TG and increased HDL-C, without affecting plasma glucose. However, at the dosages employed in the study acipimox was more effective in reducing TG and increasing HDL-C levels, whereas pravastatin was more efficient in decreasing TC and LDL-C. There was no difference between the 2 treatments in their effects on TC/HDL-C ratio. Unlike pravastatin acipimox caused a slight but significant reduction in fibrinogen plasma levels. No serious adverse event was observed with either drug, but a major incidence of side-effects was reported during treatment with acipimox. Our findings suggest that, although both drugs at the standard dose employed in the study were effective in improving the lipid profile; in the treatment of combined hyperlipidemia acipimox might be preferable in the presence of more pronounced hypertriglyceridemia with low levels of HDL-C, whereas pravastatin might be more useful when hypercholesterolemia is predominant.", 
    "90": "Simvastatin is an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase and also selectively inhibits the growth of leukaemic progenitor cells. The antileukaemic action of simvastatin was compared in vitro with that of lovastatin and pravastatin, chemically related compounds which are also competitive inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase. After 18 hours incubation with 2.5-20 microM of inhibitor, no effect was observed by any of the compounds on the subsequent clonogenic growth of normal bone marrow (BM) progenitor cells from 4 donors and BM cells from one patient in remission. However, simvastatin and lovastatin produced inhibition of acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) progenitor cell growth of between 25% and 100% in 5 populations tested (4 primary AMLs and the HL60 cell line). Pravastatin showed similar growth inhibitory effects to simvastatin and lovastatin in 2 out of 3 primary AMLs but was less active against one primary AML cell population and HL60 cells. These results indicate that, in addition to simvastatin, lovastatin and pravastatin are also selective inhibitors of leukaemic cell growth, however simvastatin was chosen for clinical trial in patients with leukaemia.", 
    "91": "Hypercholesterolemia is associated with platelet activation. Reduction of plasma cholesterol levels by the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor simvastatin has been found to improve certain aspects of platelet function in vitro and in vivo, but controlled trials are largely lacking. The present randomized, double-blind, crossover study was performed to evaluate whether 10- to 12-week treatment with simvastatin or placebo affects platelet function in vivo in 23 hypercholesterolemic men. Measurements were performed at rest and during mental stress. Simvastatin treatment reduced plasma total cholesterol levels by 18 +/- 2% and low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by 26 +/- 2% (P < .001 for both), whereas high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels increased slightly (6 +/- 2%, P < .05). Platelet aggregability as assessed by filtragometry ex vivo was unaffected by simvastatin treatment both at rest and during mental stress. Plasma beta-thromboglobulin levels, which reflect platelet secretion, were also unaltered by simvastatin treatment both at rest (antilog of the mean: 20.2 versus 20.0 ng/mL during placebo) and during mental stress. Moreover, nocturnal excretion of 11-dehydrothromboxane B2 in urine did not differ between placebo and active treatment: 218 versus 216 ng/mmol creatinine, respectively. The corresponding values for urinary excretion of high-molecular-weight beta-thromboglobulin were 1.78 versus 1.92 ng/mmol creatinine. Thus, simvastatin treatment had no clear-cut effect on platelet function, as assessed by four different in vivo related platelet function variables, in hypercholesterolemic men.", 
    "92": "We examined the effect of fluvastatin, the first entirely synthetic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor that is structurally different from other vastatins, on tissue factor (TF) expression in human macrophages spontaneously differentiated in culture from blood monocytes. Fluvastatin decreased TF activity in a dose-dependent manner (1 to 5 mumol/L) in both unstimulated and lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages, and this reduction paralleled the decrease in immunologically recognized TF protein. The same results were obtained with another lipophilic vastatin, simvastatin, but not with hydrophilic pravastatin. The reduction in TF expression was also observed in macrophages enriched in cholesterol after exposure to 50 micrograms/mL acetylated low density lipoprotein. The inhibitory effect of fluvastatin on TF activity and antigen was fully reversible by coincubation with 100 mumol/L mevalonate or 10 mumol/L all-trans-geranylgeraniol but not with dolichol, farnesol, or geraniol. Suppression of TF antigen and activity was accompanied by a diminution in TF mRNA levels, which was completely prevented by mevalonate. Furthermore, fluvastatin impaired bacterial lipopolysaccharide-induced binding of c-Rel/p65 heterodimers to a kappa B site in the TF promoter, indicating that this drug influences induction of the TF gene. We conclude that lipophilic vastatins inhibit TF expression in macrophages, and because this effect is prevented by mevalonate and geranylgeraniol, a geranylgeranylated protein plays a crucial role in the regulation of TF biosynthesis. The suppression of TF in macrophages by vastatins indicates a potential mechanism by which these drugs interfere with the formation and progression of atherosclerotic plaque as well as thrombotic events in hyperlipidemic patients.",

    "107": "The Oxford Cholesterol Study is a randomized placebo-controlled trial designed primarily to assess the effects of simvastatin on blood cholesterol levels and side-effects in preparation for a large, long-term trial of the effects of cholesterol-lowering drug therapy on mortality. At present there is only limited evidence from randomized comparisons of the effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, such as simvastatin, on thrombogenic, as distinct from atherogenic, pathways in coronary heart disease. The present sub-study was carried out to assess the effects of simvastatin on a range of haemostatic variables, as well as on free fatty acids and on lipoprotein fractions not studied in detail previously. At an average of about 2 years after starting study treatment, non-fasting blood samples were obtained from a sequential sample of 162 participants who had been randomly allocated to receive 40 mg (54 patients) or 20 mg (57 patients) daily simvastatin or matching placebo treatment (51 patients). Only patients who reported taking their study treatment and who were not known to be diabetic or to be taking some other lipid lowering treatment were to be included. The principal comparisons were to be of those allocated simvastatin (i.e. 20 and 40 mg doses combined) vs those allocated placebo. Among patients allocated simvastatin, marginally significant lower factor VII antigen levels (12.10% +/- 6.08 of standard; 2P < 0.05) and non-significantly lower factor VII coagulant activity (8.24% +/- 4.99 of standard) and fibrinogen concentrations (0.10 +/- 0.08 g. l-1) were observed. In contrast, plasminogen activator inhibitor activity was significantly higher (2.62 +/- 1.03 IU; 2P < 0.01) among patients allocated simvastatin. No significant differences were seen in the other haemostatic factors studied (e.g. prothrombin fragment 1.2, factor XII and C1 inhibitor). Total free fatty acid concentration was marginally significantly reduced (2P = 0.02) with simvastatin, but none of the reductions in individual free fatty acids was significant. Lipoprotein fractions were only measured among patients allocated 40 mg daily simvastatin or placebo. Compared with placebo, simvastatin produced significant decreases not only in LDL cholesterol (1.74 +/- 0.15 mmol.1(-1): 2P < 0.0001) but also in VLDL cholesterol (0.28 +/- 0.08 mmol.1(-1); 2P < 0.001) and IDL cholesterol (0.17 +/- 0.03 mmol.1(-1); 2P < 0.0001). There were also lower triglyceride levels associated with LDL (0.07 +/- 0.01 mmol.1(-1); 2P < 0.0001), IDL (0.03 +/- 0.01 mmol.1(-1); 2P < 0.01) and VLDL (0.27 +/- 0.14; 2P = 0.05). The effects of simvastatin on haemostatic variables appear to be far less marked than its lipid effects. Given the associations of haemostatic factors with coronary heart disease incidence, larger randomized comparisons of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (and of the newer fibrates which may produce greater effects) are needed to provide more reliable estimates of the extent to which they influence these variables.", 
    "108": "In several angiographic trials, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have shown a beneficial effect on the progression of coronary artery disease. Using 20 mg simvastatin, day-1, a treatment period of up to 4 years was necessary to show a significant reduction in coronary artery disease progression. The question remains however whether higher dosages of simvastatin would be more advantageous in respect to the magnitude of the effect and the required time interval to demonstrate treatment efficacy.", 
    "109": "In the Coronary Intervention Study (CIS), a multicentre randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study, the effects of lipid-lowering therapy with simvastatin on progression of coronary artery disease in 254 men with documented coronary artery disease and hypercholesterolaemia were investigated. Following a period of lipid-lowering diet, treatment with 40 mg simvastatin or placebo was maintained for an average of 2.3 years. Two primary angiographic endpoints were chosen: the global change score (visual evaluation according to the method of Blankenhorn) and the per patient mean change of minimum lumen diameter (evaluated by the CAAS I system). The mean simvastatin dose was 34.5 mg day-1. In the placebo group, the serum lipids remained unchanged; in comparison to the placebo group the simvastatin group showed a 35% LDL-cholesterol decrease. Coronary angiography was repeated in 205 patients (81%) and 203 film pairs (80%,) were evaluable by quantitative coronary angiography. In the simvastatin and placebo groups, the mean global change scores were +0.20 and +0.58 respectively, demonstrating a significantly slower progression of coronary artery disease in the treatment group (P = 0.02). The change in minimum lumen diameter assessed by computer-assisted quantitative evaluation with the CAAS I system was -0.02 mm in the simvastatin group and -0.10 mm in the placebo group (P = 0.002). In the simvastatin group, there was a significant correlation between the LDL cholesterol levels achieved therapeutically and the per patient mean loss of minimum lumen diameter (r = 0.29; P = 0.003). During the study period, there was no significant difference in the incidence of serious cardiac events (15 of 129 patients in the simvastatin group and 19 of 125 patients in the placebo group, ns).",

    "111": "The percentage of non-cycling blast cells in children with untreated acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) was investigated by staining smears for statin, a nuclear protein specifically present in non-growing resting cells. Results were compared with purified normal CD34-positive progenitors. A low fraction of ALL and CD34-positive cells expressed statin (2.9 +/- 3.8% and 2.8 +/- 3.1%, respectively), the growth fraction assessed by staining for the nucleolar antigen p120 was 94% in both ALL and CD34-positive cell samples. From this analysis it can be concluded that the compartment of non-replicating cells in ALL as well as in normal CD34-positive precursor cells collected from peripheral blood is very small and that most cells are cycling.", 
    "112": "Pravastatin is an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor which lowers plasma cholesterol levels by inhibiting de novo cholesterol synthesis. Pravastatin produces consistent dose-dependent reductions in both total and low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels in patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia. Favourable changes in other parameters such as total triglyceride and high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol levels are generally modest. Combination therapy with other antihyperlipidaemic agents such as cholestyramine further enhances the efficacy of pravastatin in patients with severe dyslipidaemias. Available data suggest that pravastatin is effective in elderly patients and in patients with hypercholesterolaemia secondary to diabetes mellitus or renal disease. The benefit of cholesterol-lowering in terms of patient outcomes is currently an area of considerable interest. Recently completed regression studies (PLAC I, PLAC II, KAPS and REGRESS) show that pravastatin slows progression of atherosclerosis and lowers the incidence of coronary events in patients with mild to moderately severe hypercholesterolaemia and known coronary heart disease. Large scale primary (WOSCOPS) and secondary (CARE) prevention studies, moreover, demonstrate that pravastatin has beneficial effects on coronary morbidity and mortality. In WOSCOPS, all-cause mortality was reduced by 22%. Pravastatin is generally well tolerated by most patients (including the elderly), as evidenced by data from studies of up to 5 years in duration. As with other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, myopathy occurs rarely (< 0.1% of patients treated with pravastatin): approximately 1 to 2% of patients may present with raised serum levels of hepatic transaminases. Thus, with its favourable effects on cardiovascular morbidity/mortality and total mortality, pravastatin should be considered a first-line agent in patients with elevated cholesterol levels, multiple risk factors or coronary heart disease who are at high risk of cardiovascular morbidity.", 
    "113": "The Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S) showed that lowering cholesterol levels with simvastatin reduces mortality and morbidity in patients with angina pectoris or previous acute myocardial infarction. Before the widespread use of cholesterol-lowering drugs in such patients is recommended, its cost effectiveness should be demonstrated.

    "115": "In the analysis limited to direct costs, the cost of each year of life gained ranged from $3,800 for 70-year-old men with 309 mg of cholesterol per deciliter to $27,400 for 35-year-old women with 213 mg of cholesterol per deciliter. When we included indirect costs, the results ranged from a savings in the youngest patients to a cost of $13,300 per year of life gained in 70-year-old women with 213 mg of cholesterol per deciliter.",

    "117": "Both retinoids and anti-estrogens inhibit breast cancer cell proliferation with accumulation of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, but the effect of retinoids is delayed compared to that of anti-estrogens. To determine whether this temporal difference is due to a simple delay in the action of retinoids on a common site or to different sites of action within the G1 phase, we studied the cell cycle effects of retinoic acid (RA) and the anti-estrogen ICI 164384 (ICI) in T-47D cells partially synchronized by mevalonic acid rescue of lovastatin-induced cell cycle arrest. We found that cells entering the cell cycle semi-synchronously after mevalonic acid rescue of lovastatin treatment were immediately susceptible to ICI but not RA. This suggests that RA may act at a point up-stream and ICI at a point down-stream of lovastatin action. Consistent with this, cells recommencing cell cycle progression after RA treatment were susceptible to the effects of lovastatin, while cells pre-treated with ICI then rescued with estradiol were not. In addition, cells rescued from cell cycle arrest induced by either RA, ICI or lovastatin entered S phase with the same kinetics. Our findings suggest, first, that within G1, RA acts before and ICI acts after the point of lovastatin action and, second, that despite these differences in the initiation of cell cycle arrest, the final nature of the cell cycle arrest is similar. Hence, retinoids and anti-estrogens may be expected to target different cell cycle-regulatory molecules to initiate cell cycle arrest, while overcoming this arrest may be accomplished by the activation of a common molecular pathway.", 
    "118": "Oncogenic H-Ras requires farnesylation for its transforming activity. Lovastatin inhibits both protein farnesylation and geranylgeranylation by decreasing cellular pools of farnesylpyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP), respectively. Use of lovastatin as a chemotherapeutic agent has been precluded by its significant cytotoxic effects. In this report, we describe a novel approach utilizing a combination of lovastatin and geranylgeraniol (GGOH) to potentiate the ability of lovastatin to block oncogenic H-Ras signaling and concomitantly rescue lovastatin toxicity. GGOH co-treatment with lovastatin enhances inhibition of oncogenic H-Ras processing and constitutive activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and preserves the processing of geranylgeranyltransferase (GGTase) I and GGTase II protein substrates. Moreover, co-treatment with GGOH significantly (15-fold) attenuates the cytotoxic effects of lovastatin as well as prevents lovastatin-induced cell rounding. These results demonstrate that GGOH potentiates the anti-oncogenic/anti-signaling activity of lovastatin while antagonizing its cytotoxicity. These opposing effects are due to a GGOH metabolite that serves simultaneously as a potent inhibitor for farneslyltransferase as well as a substrate for GGTases I and II.", 
    "119": "A critical aspect of sexual development in Dictyostelium is the selection of \"self\" as a targeted food source by the phagocytic zygotic giant cell (ZGC). It has previously been demonstrated that phagocytic giant cells preferentially take up amoebae of the same species suggesting that the process is mediated by a specific receptor. By using tunicamycin, which inhibits N-linked glycosylation and mevastatin and mevinolin, which both inhibit HMG-CoA-reductase, we have been able to further characterize the glycoprotein(s) involved in the recognition process. We have utilized a \"cell blotting\" technique which lends itself well to identifying glycoproteins which are present on the ZGC at the phagocytic stage and interactive with the target amoebae. The cell blotting data, combined with pharmacological evidence, identifies these glycoproteins as the receptors for cannibalistic phagocytosis by the ZGC of D. discoideum.",

Serum cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels and ambulatory monitoring were repeated after 4 to 6 months of therapy. The two groups were comparable with respect to baseline characteristics, number of episodes of ST-segment depression, and baseline serum cholesterol levels. The treatment group had lower mean total and LDL cholesterol levels at study end and experienced a significant reduction in the number of episodes of ST-segment depression compared with the placebo group. ST-segment depression was completely resolved in 13 of 20 patients (65%) in the treatment group versus 2 of 20 (10%) in the placebo group.

    "127": "Previously, we found that mevalonate-derived products together with an oxysterol regulated reductase synthesis at a posttranscriptional level. To determine which products were responsible for this regulation, either the squalene synthase inhibitor zaragozic acid A or the squalene cyclase inhibitor 4,4,10-beta-trimethyl-trans-decal-3beta-ol (TMD) was added to lovastatin-treated Syrian hamster cells in conjunction with mevalonate. Mevalonate alone decreased reductase synthesis 50% compared with lovastatin-treated cells. In contrast, when both zaragozic acid A and mevalonate were added to lovastatin-treated cells, there was no change in reductase synthesis. With either treatment, reductase mRNA levels did not change compared with lovastatin-treated cells. When both 25-hydroxycholesterol and mevalonate were added to lovastatin-treated cells, reductase synthesis and mRNA levels were decreased 95 and 50%, respectively. The 10-fold difference between changes in reductase synthesis and mRNA levels under these conditions reflects a specific effect of mevalonate-derived isoprenoids on reductase synthesis at the translational level. In contrast, coincubation of cells with mevalonate plus 25-hydroxycholesterol in the presence of zaragozic acid decreased reductase synthesis and mRNA levels 60 and 50%, respectively, compared with lovastatin-treated cells. Moreover, degradation of reductase was increased approximately 7-fold in cells treated with mevalonate alone but only 3-fold in cells treated with mevalonate and zaragozic acid A. These results indicate that isoprenoid products between mevalonate and squalene affect reductase at a posttranslational level by increasing degradation but do not regulate reductase synthesis at a posttranscriptional level. In contrast, when both TMD and mevalonate were added to lovastatin-treated cells, reductase synthesis was decreased approximately 50% with no corresponding decrease in reductase mRNA levels, similar to mevalonate only. Reductase degradation was increased approximately 7-fold under these conditions. Cellular incubation in TMD, mevalonate, and 25-hydroxycholesterol decreased reductase synthesis and mRNA levels 95 and 50%, respectively. From these results we concluded that mevalonate-derived nonsterols synthesized between squalene and lanosterol decrease reductase synthesis at a translational level-either alone or in combination with 25-hydroxycholesterol-and also increase reductase degradation."
