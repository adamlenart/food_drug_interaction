Up to 93.1% of stroke patients were eligible for a polypill containing at least 2 types of medications, with 75.3% eligible for a statin and antiplatelet agent and 70.6% for antihypertensive and antiplatelet medications. Considering 3 therapies, 54% were eligible for antihypertensive, statin, and antiplatelet medications. The current treatment rate with all required combinations of separate pills was only 6.9%.",

We report a rare case of a 49-year old man with a history of myocardial infarction and hyperlipidaemia who suffered an acute occlusion of his innominate artery (IA) accompanied by subclavian steal syndrome and cerebral infarction, on day seven after abrupt cessation of aspirin and statin, as confirmed by magnetic resonance and computed tomographic angiography of head and neck, and colour-coded Duplex ultrasonography (CCDU). Aspirin and atorvastatin were immediately re-started on admission. Spontaneous recanalization of IA was shown on repeat CCDU and digital subtraction angiography on day 10 after stroke onset. This case serves as a reminder that abrupt discontinuation of both aspirin and statin in patients with previous history of cardiovascular disease may increase the risk of ischaemic stroke.",

    "13": "Mammary cancer is the most frequent type of tumor in the female canine. Treatments are mainly limited to surgery and chemotherapy; however, these tumors may develop clinical recurrence, metastasis and chemoresistance. The existence of a subpopulation of cancer cells with stemness features called cancer stem-like cells, may explain in part these characteristics of tumor progression. The statins, potent blockers of cholesterol synthesis, have also shown antitumor effects on cancer mammary cells, changes mediated by a decrease in the isoprenylation of specific proteins. Few studies have shown that simvastatin, a lipophilic statin, sensitizes cancer stem-like cells eliminating drug resistance. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of simvastatin on spheres derived from CF41.Mg canine mammary tumor cells, which were characterized by phenotypic and functional analyses. Spheres exhibited characteristics of stemness, primarily expressing a CD44\u207a/CD24\u207b/low phenotype, displaying auto-renewal and relative chemoresistance. Exposure to simvastatin induced a decrease in the sphere-forming capacity and cell viability, accompanied by a concentration- and time-dependent increase in caspase-3/7 activity. In addition, modulation of \u03b2-catenin and p53 expression was observed. Simvastatin triggered a synergistic effect with doxorubicin, sensitizing the spheres to the cytotoxic effect exerted by the drug. Invasiveness of spheres was decreased in response to simvastatin and this effect was counteracted by the presence of geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. Our results suggest that simvastatin targets canine mammary cancer stem-like cells, supporting its therapeutical application as a novel agent to treat canine mammary cancer.", 
    "14": "Coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary interventions are common procedures that utilize iodinated contrast medium to visualize the coronary arterial tree and treat stable and unstable ischemic heart syndromes. Exposure to contrast agents can cause acute and persistent worsening of renal function leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Certain patient characteristics such as age, presence of diabetes, congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, hemodynamic instability on presentation, and type and volume of contrast used can increase the risk of developing contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) and its subsequent complications. Despite the lack of a universal definition, CIN is typically defined as an increase in serum creatinine \u22650.5\u00a0mg/dL or 25\u00a0% above baseline 48 to 72\u00a0h after contrast exposure. Previous research has shown the benefits of adequate intravenous hydration with iso-osmolar crystalloids and the importance of limiting the amount of low-osmolar and iso-osmolar contrast used to prevent the development of CIN. 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) have anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic properties with few side effects, making it an attractive therapeutic option for prevention of CIN. A number of trials have examined the benefit of different types of statins, high-dose versus low-dose statins, loading versus chronic dosing of statins, in various clinical presentations including acute coronary syndromes and elective procedures, and in those with associated comorbidities such as anemia and chronic kidney disease. In this review, we will summarize recent data regarding statin therapy for prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy.",

KRGE decreased hepatic triglyceride and cholesterol levels. Further, KRGE suppressed expression of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. These results suggest that KRGE may reduce hepatic lipid accumulation by inhibition of FAS and HMG-CoA reductase expression in HepG2 cells.",

    "37": "The aim of the present work was to develop a new solid self-microemulsifying drug delivery system (SMEDDS) for the pulmonary delivery of the poorly water-soluble anti-cancer drug atorvastatin (AVT). Microemulsion (ME) was first developed using isopropyl myristate (IPM), a combination of 2 biocompatible surfactants: lecithin/d-\u03b1-tocopheryl polyethylene glycol succinate (TPGS) and ethanol as co-surfactant. Two types of lecithin with different phosphatidylcholine (PC) contents were compared. Phase diagram, physico-chemical characterization and stability studies were used to investigate ME region. Solid SMEDDS were then prepared by spray-drying the selected ME using a combination of carriers composed of sugars, leucine as dispersibility enhancer with or without polyethylene glycol (PEG) 6000. Yield, flow properties, particle size and in vitro pulmonary deposition were used to characterize the spray-dried powders. Reconstituted MEs were characterized in terms of morphology, particle size and size distribution. In vitro cytotoxicity study was undertaken on lung cancer cell line for the selected MEs and SD-SMEDDS formulae. Results showed that the most satisfactory MEs properties were obtained with 1:3 lecithin/TPGS, 1:1 lecithin/oil and 1:1 surfactant/co-surfactant ratios. A larger ME area was obtained with lecithin containing 100% PC compared to the less expensive lecithin containing 20% PC. By manipulating spray drying parameters, carrier composition and ratio of ME lipids to carrier, microparticles with more than 70% of respirable fraction could be prepared. The ME was efficiently recovered in simulated lung fluid even after removal of alcohol. The concurrent delivery of AVT with TPGS in solid SMEDDS greatly enhanced the cytotoxic activity on lung cancer cells.", 
    "38": "Enhanced cardiovascular risk in ankylosing spondylitis (AS) provides a strong rationale for early therapeutical intervention. In view of the proven benefit of statins in atherosclerotic vascular disease, we aimed to investigate the effect of rosuvastatin on endothelial dysfunction (ED) and inflammatory disease activity in AS. In a single-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel study, 32 AS patients were randomized to receive 24\u00a0weeks of treatment with rosuvastatin (10\u00a0mg/day, n\u2009=\u200917) and placebo (n\u2009=\u200915) as an adjunct to existing stable antirheumatic drugs. Flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) was assessed by AngioDefender\u2122 (Everest Genomic Ann Arbor, USA). Inflammatory measures (BASDAI, BASFI, CRP and ESR) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (tumour necrosis factor-alpha [TNF-\u03b1], interleukin-6 [IL-6] and interleukin-1 [IL-1]) were measured at baseline and after treatment. Lipids and adhesion molecules (intracellular adhesion molecule [ICAM-1] and vascular cell adhesion molecule [VCAM-1]) were estimated at baseline and after treatment. At baseline, inflammatory measures, pro inflammatory cytokines and adhesion molecules were elevated among both groups. After treatment with rosuvastatin, FMD improved significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.01). Levels of inflammatory measures, TNF-\u03b1, IL-6 and ICAM-1 decreased significantly (p\u2009<\u20090.01) after treatment with rosuvastatin. Rosuvastatin exerted positive effect on lipid spectrum. No significant change in the placebo group. Significant negative correlation was observed between FMD and IL-6, ICAM-1, CRP after treatment with rosuvastatin. First study to show that rosuvastatin improves inflammatory disease activity and ED in AS. Rosuvastatin lowers the proinflammatory cytokines, especially IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1, which downregulates adhesion molecules and CRP production which in turns improves ED. Improvement in ED in AS occurs through both cholesterol-independent and cholesterol-dependent pathways. Rosuvastatin can mediate modest but clinically apparent anti-inflammatory effects with modification of vascular risk factors in the context of high-grade autoimmune inflammation of AS.", 
    "39": "Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a serine protease that plays an important role in modulating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels by targeting LDL-C receptors for lysosomal degradation. Genetic association studies have demonstrated that loss-of-function mutations in PCSK9 are associated with low plasma LDL-C levels and a reduction in the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events. Monoclonal antibodies directed against PCSK9 have been developed and have been shown in phase 1, 2, and 3 trials to dramatically reduce LDL-C regardless of background lipid-lowering therapy, including in clinically challenging populations such as patients intolerant to statin therapy and those with familial hypercholesterolemia. To date, the clinical trials have not raised any significant safety concerns, with no appreciable excess of myalgias, elevation in aminotransferases, or other adverse events. Large, cardiovascular outcomes trials are underway to assess definitively the efficacy and safety of 3 monoclonal antibodies (evolocumab, alirocumab, and bococizumab), while additional non-monoclonal antibody approaches to inhibit PCSK9 continue in the early-phase development.", 
    "40": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with structural remodeling in atrial myocytes. Emerging evidence suggests that statin has a protective effect on AF through cholesterol-independent mechanisms. The aim of this study is to investigate whether heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a potent antioxidant system, mediates the suppressive effect of statin on atrial tachycardia-induced structural remodeling. Treatment of cultured atrium-derived myocytes (HL-1 cell line) with rosuvastatin enhanced HO-1 expression/activity and attenuated tachypacing-induced oxidative stress and myofibril degradation. Heme oxygenase-1 inhibitors and small-interfering RNA for HO-1 blocked the inhibitory effect of rosuvastatin on tachypacing-stimulated changes, suggesting the crucial role of HO-1 in mediating the effect of rosuvastatin. Time-dependent experiments and loss-of-function study demonstrated that Akt/Nrf2 pathways lay to the up-stream of HO-1 in this signaling cascade. Furthermore, the involvement of Akt/Nrf2/HO-1 pathway in the antioxidant effect of rosuvastatin was documented in an ex vivo tachypacing model. The suppressive effect of statin on atrial tachypacing-induced cellular remodeling is mediated via the activation of Akt/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling, which provides a possible explanation for the protective effect of statin on AF.",

    "42": "Statins are a class of cholesterol-lowering drugs and have been suggested therapeutic use for neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our recent studies revealed a neuronal protective effect of lovastatin (LOV) from N-methyl-d-aspartic acid (NMDA) excitotoxicity. The neuroprotective mechanism of statins, however, is far unknown. Here we demonstrated that LOV suppressed the aberrant tau phosphorylation both from frontotemporal dementia and Parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17) mutation and okadaic acid (OA) induction in cultured rat primary neurons. The protective effect of LOV occurred at multiple pathological sites of tau protein, including Tyr181, Tyr231 Ser202/Tyr205, Tyr212/Ser214 and Ser396/Ser404. Further analysis revealed that the potential mechanism of the suppressive effect of LOV resulted from two aspects, activating OA-inhibited protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity and attenuating OA-induced activity of tau kinases CDK5/P25 and CDK2/4, but not glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2). These findings give new insights into the molecular mechanism of LOV-mediated neuroprotective effect and provide experimental evidence for its therapeutic use in AD.",

    "50": "Patients were age 68 years on average, 412 used statins (15%), and 769 died during follow-up (29%). After a median follow-up time of 3.4 years, use of statins was not associated with overall (HR = 1.10, 95% CI = 0.85 to 1.41), CRC-specific (HR = 1.11, 95% CI = 0.82 to 1.50), or recurrence-free survival (HR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.63 to 1.27). Analyses in relevant subgroups also showed no association of statin use with overall and CRC-specific survival, and no associations were observed after stratifying for major pathological subtypes. Among stage I and II patients, statin use was associated with better recurrence-free but not with better CRC-specific survival.", 
    "51": "Statin use was not associated with reduced mortality among CRC patients. Effects reported in previous studies might reflect incomplete control for stage at diagnosis and other factors associated with the use of statins.", 
    "52": "Adherence to statin therapy has been shown to be suboptimal. In statin-treated patients with residual elevated low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels the physician must decide whether to switch to a more potent statin or try and achieve better adherence. We examined the association between adherence and LDL-C within low, moderate and high intensity statin groups in a \"real world\" setting.", 
    "53": "We assessed annual adherence by the mean MPR (Medication Possession Ratio = number of purchased/prescribed daily doses) in unselected patient group. Statins were stratified (ACC/AHA Guideline) into low, moderate and high intensity groups. The impact of adherence on LDL levels was assessed by LOESS (locally weighted scatter plot smoothing).", 
    "54": "Out of 1183 patients 173 (14.6%) were treated with low, 923 (78.0%) with moderate and 87 (7.4%) with high intensity statins. Statin intensity was inversely associated with adherence (MPR 77\u00b121, 73\u00b122 and 69\u00b121% for low, moderate and high intensity respectively, p=0.018). Non-adjusted LDL levels decreased with higher adherence: a 10% adherence increase resulted in LDL decrease of 3.5, 5.8 and 7.1mg/dL in low, moderate and high intensity groups. Analysis of the adherence effect on LDL levels adjusted for age, DM and ischemic heart disease showed that MPR above 80% was associated with an additional decrease in LDL levels only in the high intensity group.", 
    "55": "Increased adherence to statins beyond an MPR of 80% improves LDL levels only among patients given high intensity therapy. Switching from lower to higher intensity therapy may be more effective than further efforts to increase adherence.",

Data related to prescription medications and comorbidities were retrieved from the database of the National Health Insurance program of Taiwan. Statin users were defined as patients who had used statins within 1 year before their cancer diagnosis. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to compare cancer-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) between statin users and patients who had never used statins (never users). In the multivariate analysis, we used propensity scores to adjust for age, sex, diagnosis year, physician visits, hospitalization, conjunctive medications, and comorbidities.",

    "60": "Even though oxidative stress damage from excessive production of ROS is a well known phenomenon, the impact of reductive stress remains poorly understood. This study tested the hypothesis that cellular reductive stress could lead to mitochondrial malfunction, triggering a mitochondrial hormesis (mitohormesis) phenomenon able to protect mitochondria from the deleterious effects of statins. We performed several in vitro experiments on L6 myoblasts and studied the effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) at different exposure times. Direct NAC exposure (1mM) led to reductive stress, impairing mitochondrial function by decreasing maximal mitochondrial respiration and increasing H\u2082O\u2082production. After 24h of incubation, the reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was increased. The resulting mitochondrial oxidation activated mitochondrial biogenesis pathways at the mRNA level. After one week of exposure, mitochondria were well-adapted as shown by the decrease of cellular ROS, the increase of mitochondrial content, as well as of the antioxidant capacities. Atorvastatin (ATO) exposure (100\u03bcM) for 24h increased ROS levels, reduced the percentage of live cells, and increased the total percentage of apoptotic cells. NAC exposure during 3days failed to protect cells from the deleterious effects of statins. On the other hand, NAC pretreatment during one week triggered mitochondrial hormesis and reduced the deleterious effect of statins. These results contribute to a better understanding of the redox-dependant pathways linked to mitochondria, showing that reductive stress could trigger mitochondrial hormesis phenomenon.", 
    "61": "The ACC/AHA released a new guideline on the assessment of cardiovascular risk and management of hypercholesterolemia that some controversy exists concerning its usefulness. We examined the clinical usefulness of this guideline in a high incidence population using novel measures.", 
    "62": "First, we validated the new risk equation in a cohort of 2372 men and 2781 women aged 40-75 years. Then, high risk individuals for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) were identified according to the ACC/AHA guideline at baseline (as a predictor) and CVD outcomes were detected during a 10-year follow-up. Discrimination of the guideline was quantified and the quality of decisions was evaluated by Net Benefit Fraction index considering the harm, for false-positive, and benefit, for true-positive predictions. Finally, net number needed to treat (NNT) for statin was estimated, using test tradeoff index, in diabetic and non-diabetic subjects.", 
    "63": "During follow-up, 726 CVD events including 298 hard CVDs occurred. The equation overestimated the risk by 57% in men and 48% in women. Based on the guideline, 73% of men and 44% of women were eligible for statin therapy. The lowest sensitivity was detected for intensive treatment in non-diabetic subgroups (82% in men and 41% in women; corresponding specificity, 52% and 90% respectively). The guideline had a significant net benefit for both moderate and intensive treatment, which resulted in estimated NNTs ranged 5-55; however, net benefit of intensive therapy was uncertain in non-diabetic women.", 
    "64": "We objectively showed that the ACC/AHA recommendations could be useful in our population but with some overtreatment in women.", 
    "65": "In randomized clinical trials statins and placebo treated patients showed the same degree of coronary artery calcium (CAC) progression. We reanalyzed data from two clinical trials to further investigate the time and dose dependent effects of statins on CAC. Additionally, we investigated whether CAC progression was associated with incident cardiovascular events.", 
    "66": "Data were pooled from two clinical trials: St. Francis Heart Study (SFHS) (419 and 432 patients treated with placebo and 20 mg atorvastatin daily, respectively) and EBEAT Study (164 and 179 patients respectively treated with 10 mg and 80 mg atorvastatin daily). CAC scores were assessed at baseline, 2 years and 4-6 years in SFHS; in EBEAT they were measured at baseline and 12 months. After a short-term follow-up (12 to 24 months) placebo and low dose atorvastatin showed a similar CAC increase, although 80 mg/daily atorvastatin increased CAC an additional 12-14% over placebo (p<0.001). In the long-term, atorvastatin caused a greater progression of CAC compared to placebo (additional 1.1%, p=0.04). In SFHS 42 cardiovascular events occurred after the second CT scan. The baseline and progression of CAC were greater in patients with events. However, only baseline CAC and family history of premature cardiovascular disease but not CAC progression were independent predictors of events.", 
    "67": "Despite a greater CAC increase with high dose and long-term statin therapy, events did not occur more frequently in statin treated patients. This suggests that CAC growth under treatment with statins represents plaque repair rather than continuing plaque expansion.", 
    "68": "Despite the availability of effective surveillance for colorectal cancer with colonoscopy, chemoprevention might be an acceptable alternative. Statins are potent inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis. In clinical trials, statins have been found to be beneficial in the primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease. However, the overall benefits observed with statins appear to be greater than what might be expected from changes in lipid levels alone, suggesting effects beyond cholesterol lowering. This systematic review aimed to gather information on the possible chemopreventive role of statins in preventing carcinogenesis and tumor promotion by a diverse array of mechanisms in both sporadic and colitis-associated cancer in animal models. The MEDLINE database was thoroughly searched using the following keywords: 'statin, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, colon cancer, mice, rats, chemoprevention, colitis-associated cancer'. Additional articles were gathered and evaluated. There are a lot of clinical studies and meta-analyses, as well as a plethora of basic research studies implementing cancer cell lines and animal models, on the chemopreventive role of statins in colorectal cancer (CRC). However, data derived from clinical studies are inconclusive, yet they show a tendency toward a beneficial role of statins against CRC pathogenesis. Thus, more research on the molecular pathways of CRC tumorigenesis as related to statins is warranted to uncover new mechanisms and compare the effect of statins on both sporadic and colitis-associated cancer in animal models. Basic science results could fuel exclusive colitis-associated cancer clinical trials to study the chemopreventive effects of statins and to differentiate between their effects on the two types of CRCs in humans.",

    "70": "The study cohort consisted of a population-based sample of 64-year-old women with varying degrees of glucose tolerance (n=594). To identify and record the occurrence of carotid atherosclerotic plaques ultrasonography was used. Measurements of plasma IgM and IgG autoantibodies against the native and malondialdehyde (MDA)-modified apoB-100 peptides p45 and p210 were performed by ELISA.", 
    "71": "Women with carotid plaques were found to have lower levels of IgM MDA-p210 autoantibodies compared to plaque-free women. The number of carotid plaques in each subject and the total carotid plaque area correlated inversely with IgM MDA-p210 levels (r=-0.11, P=0.009 and r=-0.11, P=0.013, respectively). Furthermore, levels of IgM MDA-p210 above the lowest tertile were associated with an odds ratio of 0.55 (95% CI 0.38-0.79, P=0.001) for occurrence of carotid plaques, independently of other risk markers and statin treatment. Associations between apo-B100 peptide autoantibodies and cardiovascular risk factors were generally weak but subjects with impaired glucose tolerance had higher levels of IgM against MDA-p210.", 
    "72": "The present study demonstrates that high levels of IgM against MDA-p210 are associated with less severe carotid disease in women. These findings provide additional support for a role of immune responses against oxidized LDL in cardiovascular disease.",

A total of 335 (30%) patients utilized all four guideline-recommended therapies. Adherence to four guideline-recommended therapies was lowest among patients with acute limb ischemia (14%) and highest among patients with renal artery stenosis (37%). Among all patients with vascular disease, the range of adherence to individual guidelines was 64%-91% for aspirin, 43%-83% for statins, 49%-66% for ACEIs, and 47%-78% for smoking abstention.",

The study reported here sought to evaluate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between rosuvastatin and valsartan in healthy Korean subjects.", 
    "83": "Thirty healthy male Korean subjects were administered with rosuvastatin (20 mg/day), valsartan (160 mg/day), and both drugs concomitantly for 4 days in a randomized, open-label, multiple-dose, three-treatment, three-period crossover study. Plasma concentrations of rosuvastatin, N-desmethyl rosuvastatin, and valsartan were determined using validated high-performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. Lipid profiles and vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate) were measured for the pharmacodynamic assessment.", 
    "84": "For rosuvastatin, the geometric mean ratios (90% confidence intervals [CIs]) of coadministration to mono-administration were 0.8809 (0.7873-0.9857) for maximum plasma concentration at steady state and 0.9151 (0.8632-0.9701) for area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) over a dosing interval at steady state. For valsartan, the geometric mean ratios (90% CIs) of those were 0.9300 (0.7946-1.0884) and 1.0072 (0.8893-1.1406), respectively. There were no significant differences in the metabolic ratio of N-desmethyl rosuvastatin AUC to rosuvastatin AUC between coadministration and rosuvastatin alone. No interaction was found in terms of systolic or diastolic blood pressure or lipid profiles. Combined treatment with valsartan and rosuvastatin was generally well tolerated without serious adverse events.",

Lovastatin (LOV) was chosen as the model drug and LOV rod shaped nanocrystals (LOV-RNs) and spherical like nanocrystals (LOV-SNs) were prepared by sonoprecipitation and bead milling, respectively. The dry powders obtained following freeze-drying were characterized by hydrodynamic diameter, polydispersity index, zeta potential, transmission electron microscope, scanning electron microscope, atomic force microscope, differential scanning calorimetry, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and in vitro dissolution test. The pharmacokinetic study was performed in beagle dogs. The results obtained showed that LOV-RNs and LOV-SNs had similar hydrodynamic diameters (500.6\u00b121.0 nm versus 503.2\u00b120.4 nm), and the same crystalline state. The dissolution test showed that LOV-RNs had a higher dissolution rate than LOV-SNs. The AUC(0-24h) values of LOV-RNs and LOV-SNs were higher than Junning\u00ae for both LOV (p<0.05 for LOV-RNs, and p>0.05 for LOV-SNs) and lovastatin acid (p>0.05). More importantly, the oral bioavailability of LOV-RNs was higher than LOV-SNs (p>0.05). The findings of this study show that the crystal shape has a significant effect on oral bioavailability.",

    "91": "Statin induced necrotizing autoimmune myopathy (SINAM) is a recently characterized entity belonging to the spectrum of statin myotoxicity. It is a more severe form, and is usually associated with significant proximal muscle weakness, strikingly elevated creatine kinase levels and persistent symptoms despite statin discontinuation. The characteristic pathological finding is a marked muscle fiber necrosis with minimal or no inflammation on muscle biopsy. SINAM is an autoimmune disorder associated with an antibody against 3-hydroxy-3-methyglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR), and the antibody titer is a useful marker for assessing treatment response. However, anti-HMGCR positive myopathies are also caused by unknown etiologies other than statin exposure, especially in the younger population. SINAM should be promptly recognized as immunosuppressive therapy can improve its clinical outcome significantly. Further research is needed to elucidate its pathogenesis and provide evidence based guidelines for management.", 
    "92": "Diabetic kidney disease is a leading cause of renal failure in Germany. Albuminuria is an early diagnostic indicator of renal damage in diabetes and, aside from renal failure, a major risk factor of cardiovascular disease. An early diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease is of great importance to reduce associated cardiovascular mortality; glycemic control should aim for HbA1c levels of <\u20097\u2009%. Guidelines on blood pressure differ, but it should generally be reduced to <\u2009140/90\u00a0mmHg; stricter limits should be applied if albuminuria is present. ACE inhibitors (ACE-I) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) should be preferred for blood pressure control. A combination of ACE-Is and ARBs or a renin-inhibitor therapy does not improve cardiovascular outcome, instead it increases the rate of adverse events, e.g., hyperkalemia or renal failure. Lipid control, usually with statins, should be started at an early phase of renal failure. Vitamin\u00a0D receptor activation and uric acid reduction might play a future role in the treatment of diabetic kidney disease. Pharmacological modification of inflammatory signaling appears to be promising but is not yet of clinical relevance.",

The update consists of 296 trials that evaluated dose-related efficacy of atorvastatin in 38,817 participants. Included are 242 before-and-after trials and 54 placebo-controlled RCTs. Log dose-response data from both trial designs revealed linear dose-related effects on blood total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglycerides.

Over this range, blood LDL-cholesterol is decreased by 37.1% to 51.7% (Summary of findings table 1). The slope of dose-related effects on cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol was similar for atorvastatin and rosuvastatin, but rosuvastatin is about three-fold more potent. Subgroup analyses suggested that the atorvastatin effect was greater in females than in males and was greater in non-familial than in familial hypercholesterolaemia. Risk of bias for the outcome of withdrawals due to adverse effects (WDAEs) was high, but the mostly unclear risk of bias was judged unlikely to affect lipid measurements.

In vitro, idelalisib inhibits P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and organic anion transporting polypeptides 1B1 and 1B3, and GS-563117 is a time-dependent CYP3A inhibitor. This study enrolled 24 healthy subjects and evaluated (1) the effect of idelalisib on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of digoxin, a P-gp probe substrate, rosuvastatin, a breast cancer resistance protein, and OATP1B1/OATP1B3 substrate, and midazolam, a CYP3A substrate; and (2) the effect of a strong inducer, rifampin, on idelalisib PK. On treatment, the most common clinical adverse events (AEs) were headache and pyrexia. Grade 3 transaminase increases were observed in 5 of 24 subjects and were reversible. Two subjects had serious AEs after treatment completion (grade 3 pyrexia and/or drug-induced liver injury). Idelalisib coadministration did not affect digoxin and rosuvastatin PK. Coadministration with idelalisib increased plasma exposures of midazolam (138% and 437% for maximum observed plasma concentration [Cmax ] and area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 extrapolated to infinity [AUCinf ], respectively), consistent with the in vitro finding of CYP3A inhibition by GS-563117. Rifampin caused a substantial decrease in idelalisib (58% and 75%, Cmax and AUCinf , respectively) and GS-563117 exposures, indicating an enhanced contribution of CYP3A to idelalisib metabolism under a strongly induced state.", 
    "109": "Statins have been shown to modulate the number and the suppressive function of CD4(+)FOXP3(+) T cells (Treg) in inflammatory conditions. However, it is not well established whether statin could also affect Treg in absence of inflammation. To address this question, eighteen normocholesterolemic male subjects were treated with lovastatin or atorvastatin daily for 45 days. The frequency and phenotype of circulating Treg were evaluated at days 0, 7, 30, and 45. mRNA levels of FOXP3, IDO, TGF-\u03b2, and IL-10 were measured in CD4(+) T cells. We found that both statins significantly increased Treg frequency and FOXP3 mRNA levels at day 30. At day 45, Treg numbers returned to baseline values; however, TGF-\u03b2 and FOXP3 mRNA levels remained high, accompanied by increased percentages of CTLA-4- and GITR-expressing Treg. Treg Ki-67 expression was decreased upon statin treatment. Treg frequency positively correlated with plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), suggesting a role for HDL-c in Treg homeostasis. Therefore, statins appear to have inflammation-independent immune-modulatory effects. Thus, the increase in Treg cells frequency likely contributes to immunomodulatory effect of statins, even in healthy individuals.",

First, we used ordinary least squares (OLS) and logit models to determine if receiving a statin was protective against pneumonia. Second, to control for nonrandom treatment assignment, we performed an instrumental variables analysis using geographic treatment rates as an instrument.

Although a significant reduction in SCr was seen postoperatively in people treated with statins, this result was driven by results from a single study, where SCr was considered as a secondary outcome. The results of the meta-analysis should be interpreted with caution; few studies were included in subgroup analyses, and significant differences in methodology exist among the included studies.

Patients presenting <24 hours from ICH onset were randomized to a systolic blood pressure target <150 or <180 mm Hg with computed tomography perfusion imaging 2 hours after randomization. Cerebral blood flow maps were calculated. Hematoma and edema volumes were measured planimetrically. Regression models were used to assess the relationship between statin use, perihematoma edema and cerebral hemodynamics. Fourteen patients (19%) were taking statins at the time of ICH.

Statins are 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors commonly used to lower cholesterol levels. Studies indicated that statins, especially simvastatin, promote wound healing in experimental models. As Staphylococcus aureus is one of the most important microorganism responsible for wound infections, the aims of this study were to characterise the anti-staphylococcal activity of simvastatin and to evaluate the application of simvastatin as a topical therapy for S. aureus-contaminated wounds. In the present study, simvastatin was bacteriostatic against S. aureus at sub-inhibitory concentrations up to 8 hours after exposure. Further increased concentrations of simvastatin above the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) did not enhance the growth inhibitory effect. By contrast, the ability of simvastatin to inhibit S. aureus biofilm formation was concentration dependent. Topical application of simvastatin at its MIC against S. aureus accelerated the healing and bacterial clearance of S. aureus-contaminated wounds in an excisional mice wound model. This effective concentration is well below the safe concentration for topical use. Collectively, topical application of simvastatin has the potential as a novel modality for managing wound infections and promoting wound healing.", 
    "149": "Furocoumarin shows some antitumor activity when it is radiated by the UV light. In order to improve the antitumor activity of furocoumarin under standard environment conditions, the \"minimal DNA-intercalating\" hypothesis was firstly introduced to the structural modification of furocoumarin, which resulted in the design of pseudo-furocoumarin. The pseudo-furocoumarin was synthesized by two-step reaction including Pechmann reaction catalyzed by conc. H2SO4 and Suzuki coupling reaction catalyzed by Pd(PPh3)4. The structural character of the pseudo-furocoumarin is that the bonding mode of furan ring fused to the coumarin is replaced by a chemical single bond between furan ring and coumarin. The interaction of the pseudo-furocoumarin with calf thymus DNA (CT-DNA) has been respectively investigated by using DNA melting curve, UV-Vis absorption spectra, fluorescence spectra and viscosity titration, and the modes of DNA-binding for the pseudo-furocoumarin have been proposed. Based on the results of DNA melting curve, spectra and viscosity titration, it was suggested that 5a and 5b bind to DNA by the partial intercalation and classical intercalation, respectively. The DNA-binding behaviors of 5c and 5d have been rarely reported in literature and may be interpreted in terms of bridge-structure. All target compounds, except 5b, show a decreasing capability of intercalation to DNA. Further, the antiproliferative activities of the pseudo-furocoumarin on human lung adenocarcinoma (A549), human breast cancer (MCF-7) and human ovarian carcinoma cell line (SKOV-3) in vitro were evaluated using the sulforhodamine B (SRB) protein statin assay. All pseudo-furocoumarin exhibited an improved anti-proliferative activity as compared with the control compound psoralen (PS, a linear furocoumarin). Interestingly the pseudo-furocoumarin binding to DNA by a non-classical intercalation mode showed a stronger anti-proliferative activity than PS.

    "174": "Patients with coronary artery disease often receive concurrent treatment with clopidogrel and a hydroxymethylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase inhibitor medication. Accordingly, potential drug-drug interactions associated with the concomitant use of these agents present an area of concern. Both CYP enzymes and carboxylesterase 1 (CES1) are involved in the metabolism of clopidogrel, while CES1 is believed to be the enzyme responsible for the activation of simvastatin. Some in vitro studies have suggested that simvastatin could attenuate clopidogrel activation via inhibiting CYP3A activity. However, these findings have not found support in several recently published clinical investigations. The present study addresses these inconsistencies by exploring the potential role of CES1 in the metabolism of clopidogrel and simvastatin. Our in vitro human liver s9 fraction incubation study demonstrated that simvastatin significantly enhanced the formation of the intermediate metabolite 2-oxo-clopidogrel, and inhibited the CES1-mediated hydrolysis of clopidogrel, 2-oxo-clopidogrel, and the active metabolite. However, the production of the active metabolite remained unchanged. Conversely, clopidogrel was not found to influence the CES1 mediated hydrolysis (activation) of simvastatin. Moreover, we provided evidence that CES1 is not an efficient enzyme for catalyzing simvastatin activation. In summary, the inhibitory effect of simvastatin on the hydrolysis of clopidogrel and its principal metabolites may have offset the influence of simvastatin-mediated inhibition of CYP3A, and permitted the unaltered formation of the clopidogrel active metabolite. These data help explain the conflicting accounts in previous reports regarding clopidogrel and simvastatin interactions by taking into consideration CES1; they suggest that the interactions are unlikely to significantly influence clinical outcomes.", 
    "175": "Nobody doubts the importance of organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP)1B1 and 1B3 in the clinical pharmacokinetics of substrate drugs. Based on the theory of pharmacokinetics, even if a drug is eliminated from the body by extensive metabolism, the rate-determining process of the hepatic intrinsic clearance of OATP substrates is often hepatic uptake. Because of their broad substrate specificities, once the functions of OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 are altered by several kinds of special occasions such as drug-drug interactions (DDI) and genetic polymorphisms of transporter genes, the hepatic clearance of many kinds of structurally-unrelated drugs is expected to be changed. In some cases, these alterations of pharmacokinetics lead to modified pharmacological effects and adverse reactions such as statin-induced myotoxicity and the glucose-lowering effect of anti-diabetes drugs. Thus, appropriate methods with which to quantitatively predict the changes in plasma and tissue concentrations of drugs are needed in the process of drug development. As for DDI, a static model that takes into consideration of the theoretically-maximum unbound inhibitor concentration is often used for the sensitive detection of possible DDI risks and this method has been adopted in several regulatory guidance/guidelines on DDI. Regarding genetic polymorphisms, the effects of SLCO1B1 c.388A>G and c.521T>C on the pharmacokinetics of substrate drugs have been extensively investigated. Even though there are some discrepancies, c.521T>C generally decreased hepatic uptake activity, while c.388A>G tended to slightly increase it. This article briefly summarizes the current status of research on hepatic OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 and the clinical significance of their functions.", 
    "176": "Hypercholesterolemia and hypertension are the most common risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Updated guidelines emphasize target reduction of overall cardiovascular risks. Hypercholesterolemia and hypertension have a synergistic deleterious effect on insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction. Unregulated renin-angiotensin system (RAS) is important in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Statins are the most important in patients with hypercholesterolemia to prevent CVD by lowering low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, improving endothelial dysfunction, and other anti-atherosclerotic effects. Unfortunately, statin therapy dose-dependently causes insulin resistance and increases the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. RAS inhibitors improve both endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance in addition to blood pressure lowering. Further, cross-talk between hypercholesterolemia and RAS exists at multiple steps of insulin resistance and endothelial dysfunction. In this regard, combined therapy with statins and RAS inhibitors demonstrates additive/synergistic beneficial effects on endothelial dysfunction and insulin resistance in addition to lowering both cholesterol levels and blood pressure and it did reduce cardiovascular events when compared with either monotherapy in patients. This is mediated by both distinct and interrelated mechanisms. Therefore, combined therapy with statins and RAS inhibitors may be important in developing optimal management strategies in patients with hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, metabolic syndrome or obesity to prevent or treat CVD.",

In conclusion, P. ostreatus is a good source for \u03b2-glucan, dietary polyphenols, and antioxidants.

Only the PWE fractions obtained at 25\u00b0C showed 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR) inhibitory activity. Besides the enzymatic inhibition, PWE extracts may downregulate some of the key genes involved in the cholesterol homeostasis, such as the squalene synthase gene (FDFT1), since its mRNA expression falls by one third of its initial value.

Combined treatment with 5 \u03bcM troglitazone and 1 \u03bcM lovastatin exhibited no cytotoxicity but significantly inhibited EGF-induced migration, as determined using wound healing and Boyden chamber assays. Cotreatment with troglitazone and lovastatin altered the epithelial-to-mesenchymal-transition (EMT) -related marker gene expression of the cells; specifically, E-cadherin expression increased and vimentin expression decreased. In addition, cotreatment reduced the number of filopodia, which are believed to be involved in migration, and significantly inhibited EGF-induced Cyr61 mRNA and protein expression as well as Cyr61 secretion. Moreover, the phosphorylation levels of 2 crucial signal molecules for EGF-induced Cyr61 expression, the cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), were decreased in cells cotreated with troglitazone and lovastatin.

After monkeys had received a 3-mg/kg oral dose, mass balance was achieved after bile duct cannulation (mean total recovery of radioactivity of 103.6%). Forty-two percent of the RSV dose was recovered in urine and bile, and the elimination pathways were similar to those reported for human subjects; 61.7%, 39.0%, and 2.9% of the dose was recovered in the feces, bile, and urine, respectively. The high levels of unchanged RSV recovered in urine and bile (26% of the dose) and the relatively low levels of metabolites observed indicated that RSV was eliminated largely by excretion.

Quantitative PCR and Western blot were used to analyze (forkhead box P3) FOXP3 mRNA transcript levels and the expression of FOXP3 protein.In ACS patients, the percentage and inhibitory properties of nTregs were reduced, IFN-\u03b3 and hsCRP levels were increased, and IL-10 and TGF-\u03b21 levels were lowered. Atorvastatin treatment increased the percentage and inhibitory ability of nTregs, decreased serum IFN-\u03b3 and hsCRP levels, and decreased IL-10 and TGF-\u03b21 levels, as compared with the non-atorvastatin group.Our findings suggest that nTregs play an atheroprotective role in atherosclerosis.

    "209": "The study used cell lines that stably expressed or over-expressed the respective transporters. The clinical study was an open-label, single sequence study where subjects (n = 36) received pradigastat (100 mg once daily x 3 days thereafter 40 mg once daily) and rosuvastatin (10 mg once daily), alone and in combination.", 
    "210": "Pradigastat inhibited BCRP-mediated efflux activity in a dose-dependent fashion in a BCRP over-expressing human ovarian cancer cell line with an IC(50) value of 5 \u03bcM. Similarly, pradigastat inhibited OATP1B1, OATP1B3 (estradiol 17\u03b2 glucuronide transport), and OAT3 (estrone 3 sulfate transport) activity in a concentrationdependent manner with estimated IC(50) values of 1.66 \u00b1 0.95 \u03bcM, 3.34 \u00b1 0.64 \u03bcM, and 0.973 \u00b1 0.11 \u03bcM, respectively. In the presence of steady state pradigastat concentrations, AUC(\u03c4, ss) of rosuvastatin was unchanged and its Cmax,ss decreased by 14% (5.30 and 4.61 ng/mL when administered alone and coadministered with pradigastat, respectively). Pradigastat AUC(\u03c4, ss) and C(max, ss) were unchanged when coadministered with rosuvastatin at steady state. Both rosuvastatin and pradigastat were well tolerated.", 
    "211": "These data indicate no clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction between pradigastat and rosuvastatin.", 
    "212": "The aim of this study was to examine the effects of different statins on the clinical outcomes of Japanese patients with coronary stent implants.", 
    "213": "This study included 5,801 consecutive patients (males, 4,160; age, 69.7\u00b111.1 years, mean\u00b1SD) who underwent stent implantation between April 2008 and March 2011. They were treated with a strong statin (n=3,042, 52%, atorvastatin, pitavastatin, or rosuvastatin), a regular statin (n=1,082, 19%, pravastatin, simvastatin, or fluvastatin) or no statin (n=1,677, 29%). The patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) were divided into mild-to-moderate CKD (30\u2264eGFR<60, n=1,956) and severe CKD (eGFR <30, n=559). Primary endpoints included cardiovascular death and nonfatal myocardial infarction, including stent thrombosis and ischemic stroke. The clinical outcome for the primary endpoint in mild-to-moderate CKD patients treated with a strong statin (hazard ratio 0.50, 95% confidence interval 0.31-0.81; P=0.005) was significantly lower than in those on no statins, but that in the patients treated with a regular statin was not (P=0.160). The clinical outcome for the primary endpoint in severe CKD patients treated with a strong or regular statin was no different than not being on statin therapy (P=0.446, P=0.194, respectively).", 
    "214": "In patients with mild-to-moderate CKD, only strong statins were associated with lower risk compared with no statin, but regular statins were not. It is possible that taking a strong statin from the early stage of CKD is useful for suppression of cardiovascular events.", 
    "215": "Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is a useful modality for visualizing atherosclerotic lesions in coronary arteries, not only for the degree of arterial luminal stenosis but also for the plaque composition within the vessel walls. We aimed to determine the relationship between the clinical parameters and coronary plaque characteristics evaluated by IVUS in patients with stable angina under medical treatment.", 
    "216": "Plaque measurements within the coronary arteries were collected by coronary angiography and iMAP-IVUS in 40 men with stable angina. The serum remnant-like cholesterol (RemL-C) was measured using homogeneous assays and serum adiponectin and omentin-1 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays.", 
    "217": "The iMAP-IVUS analysis of the coronary arteries demonstrated that the plaque cross-sectional area (CSA) was 11.0\u00b13.5 mm(2). Plaque CSA positively correlated with body mass index and negatively correlated with the serum adiponectin levels. Both areal and volumetric analyses of the plaque characteristics demonstrated that the serum RemL-C level was a positive determinant for %Necrosis and the negative determinant for %Fibrosis of the plaques. Neither serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol nor low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels correlated with the proportion of any plaque components. Additionally, the RemL-C/triglyceride ratio positively correlated with %Lipid significantly in the areal analysis.", 
    "218": "Elevation of the serum RemL-C levels in the patients with stable angina may link to coronary plaque vulnerability, which is characterized by high necrotic and low fibrotic components.", 
    "219": "The immune system may play an important role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. T cell-driven inflammation in human hypertension and atherosclerosis has recently been revealed. In the present study, we evaluated the association between serum levels of the C-X-C chemokine receptor type 3 chemokines and the carotid intima media thickness (IMT) in humans.", 
    "220": "One hundred sixty-four consecutive patients undergoing baseline and 2-year follow-up carotid IMT (110 men, 62.4\u00b110.0 years) were enrolled. The maximum carotid IMT (max-IMT) and the mean carotid IMT (mean-IMT) were measured at baseline and after 24 months. Clinical and laboratory variables, including serum levels of the monokine induced by gamma interferon (MIG) and interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10), were analyzed at the time of initial enrollment.", 
    "221": "The baseline max- and mean-IMT were 0.992\u00b10.235 and 0.793\u00b10.191 mm, respectively. The serum levels of MIG and IP-10 significantly correlated with the carotid IMT. However, there was no significant correlation between the serum levels of MIG or IP-10 and IMT changes. A multivariate regression analysis revealed the serum MIG to be independently associated with the carotid IMT (max-IMT: \u03b2=0.194, p=0.010; mean-IMT: \u03b2=0.184, p=0.016) when controlled for age, sex, diabetes mellitus history, smoking history, body mass index, blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, and aspirin and statin medication.", 
    "222": "Circulating MIG levels are independently associated with the carotid IMT, after adjusting for confounding factors and medications. These findings indicate the potential clinical implication of MIG with respect to early atherosclerosis in humans.", 
    "223": "Beyond lipid-lowering properties, statins decrease sympathetic nervous activity. Due to the limited number of studies and included participants, a meta-analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled studies using microneurography (MSNA) was performed to assess sympatholytic effect of statins.", 
    "224": "We conducted a comprehensive search of online databases (Cochrane, Embase, and EBSCO) for published human studies up to April 2014. Randomized controlled trials (parallel and crossover design) were eligible for inclusion if results of statins versus placebo treatments on sympathetic activity were measured with MSNA.", 
    "225": "Data from five studies with a total number of subjects n = 82 were included into the meta-analysis. MSNA expressed as bursts/min and as bursts/100 heartbeats was lower in the statin group than in the placebo group with a mean difference of -4.37 95% CI (-7.03; -1.70), p < 0.0013 and -5.85 95% CI (-7.56; -4.13), p < 0.0001, respectively. No significant publication bias was observed. Meta-regression revealed no significant effect of baseline total cholesterol or dose of statin. No change in blood pressure and heart rate was observed.", 
    "226": "Published data show that regardless of type and dose, statins reduce sympathetic activity measured by microneurography. The role of decreased sympathetic outflow during statin therapy on clinical end points needs to be clarified.", 
    "227": "Breast cancer is associated with high levels of incidence, morbidity and mortality; therefore, the identification of effective chemopreventive strategies is crucial. It is important for clinicians to be able to identify the populations at risk who would benefit from chemoprevention, and the interventions that are effective and safe. The aim of the present study was to investigate the combined effects of simvastatin and exemestane on MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. The anti-proliferative effects of simvastatin and exemestane, alone and in combination, on the growth of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells were assessed by MTT assay. The synergism between the two drugs was determined in vitro using the combination index (CI) analysis. Cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry, and alterations to the signaling pathway in MCF-7 cells were examined by immunoblotting following treatment with various regimens. The results of the MTT assay indicated that the combined treatment of simvastatin and exemestane significantly decreased the viability of MCF-7 estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) human breast cancer cells, as compared with those that were treated with the individual drugs (CI<1). In addition, coadministration of exemestane and simvastatin was shown to result in marked inhibition of tumor cell proliferation, significant cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase and induction of apoptosis, as compared with that of the control and individual drug-treated cells. Furthermore, the results of the present study indicated that these synergistic effects may be associated with the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)/Bcl-2-associated X protein apoptotic pathway and the mitogen-activated protein kinase/mammalian target of rapamycin/p70S6 kinase growth pathway. The combination of exemestane and simvastatin generated synergistic effects on MCF-7 ER+ breast cancer cells, indicating that the combination of these drugs may be a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of hormone-dependent breast cancer. The combination of the two inhibitors markedly increased the efficacy, as compared with the single-agent treatment, suggesting that combination treatment could become a highly effective approach for breast cancer. The results of the present study suggested that this combination of drugs has therapeutic potential, and requires further mechanistic and biomarker investigations in clinical trials."
