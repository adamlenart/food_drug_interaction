    "0": "The aim of the present study was to see whether a moderate dose of omega-3 fatty acids (FA) potentiates the beneficial effects of statins on the high risk for coronary heart disease (CHD) in patients with combined hyperlipemia.", 
    "1": "In the present double-blind parallel study, 42 patients with combined hyperlipemia with serum triglycerides 2-15 mmol/L-1 and serum total cholesterol > 5.3 mmol/L-1 at the end of a three-month dietary run-in period were treated with 10 mg/d atorvastatin for 10 or more weeks. During the last 5 weeks they were randomized into two groups that received either 1.68 g/d omega-3 FA as ethylesters of eicosapentaenoic (45%) and docosahexaenoic acids (39%), or placebo (corn oil). As expected, atorvastatin significantly reduced serum total LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides and apolipoproteins B, E, CII and CIII, whereas HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) was increased. Addition of omega-3 FA further increased HDL-C (p < 0.03), and reduced systolic blood pressure (< 0.03), while the small dense LDL-particles (LDL III) (p < 0.05) and postprandial hypertriglyceridemia (p < 0.01) were reduced compared with the baseline, though there were no significant differences to the placebo group. This may be related to the large individual variation in these parameters and the small number of patients. No significant effects on basic or postheparin activities of lipoprotein lipase or hepatic lipase were observed after atorvastatin with or without addition of omega-3 FA.", 
    "2": "This study indicates that addition of a low dose of omega-3 FA may further improve the risk profile for CHD in patients with combined hyperlipemia treated with atorvastatin. The effect is related to reduction of postprandial hyperlipemia and redistribution of LDL subfractions.", 
    "3": "This study compares the cholesterol-lowering efficacy of atorvastatin and simvastatin in attainment of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) guidelines LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) goal in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HFH). The association of atorvastatin with significant changes of blood fibrinogen and other coagulative variables was also compared with that of simvastatin.", 
    "4": "In a 24-week study, 26 HFH patients (16 men, 10 women, mean age 55.1 +/- 11.3) were randomly assigned to receive atorvastatin or simvastatin. The initial daily dose of 10 mg was progressively raised to 20, 40 and 80 mg in patients who had not reached the NCEP LDL-C goal. Significant reductions of total and LDL-C (p < 0.001), triglycerides (p < 0.005) and apoB100 (p < 0.001) were observed in both groups. Atorvastatin caused greater reductions in total cholesterol (-42% vs -30%) (p < 0.001) and LDL-C (-50% vs -37%) (p < 0.01). Three patients treated with Atorvastatin (23%) and none of those treated with simvastatin reached the NCEP LDL-C goal at the end of the study. No significant departures from the fibrinogen and coagulative variable baselines were observed.", 
    "5": "Atorvastatin has greater cholesterol-lowering efficacy than simvastatin in HFH.", 
    "6": "Simvastatin attenuates ischemia and reperfusion in normocholesterolemic animals by stabilizing endothelial nitric oxide synthase activity and inhibiting neutrophil-mediated injury. Because endothelial dysfunction is a detrimental effect of hypercholesterolemia, we examined whether short-term treatment with simvastatin could inhibit leukocyte-endothelium interaction and attenuate myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury in apoE-deficient (apoE(-/-)) mice fed a high-cholesterol diet.", 
    "7": "We studied leukocyte-endothelium interactions in apoE(-/-) mice fed a normal or a high-cholesterol diet after short-term (ie, 18 hours) simvastatin treatment. We also studied simvastatin treatment in myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury by subjecting apoE(-/-) mice to 30 minutes of ischemia and 24 hours of reperfusion. ApoE(-/-) mice fed a high-cholesterol diet exhibited higher blood cholesterol levels, which were not affected by short-term simvastatin treatment. However, the increased leukocyte rolling and adherence that occurred in cholesterol-fed apoE(-/-) mice (P<0.001 versus control diet) were significantly attenuated by simvastatin treatment (P<0.01 versus vehicle). Cholesterol-fed apoE(-/-) mice subjected to myocardial ischemia-reperfusion also experienced increased myocardial necrosis (P<0.01 versus control diet), which was significantly attenuated by simvastatin (P<0.01 versus vehicle). Simvastatin therapy also significantly increased vascular nitric oxide production in apoE(-/-) mice.", 
    "8": "Simvastatin attenuates leukocyte-endothelial cell interactions and ameliorates ischemic injury in hypercholesterolemic mice independently of lipid-lowering actions.", 
    "9": "C-reactive protein (CRP) induces adhesion molecule expression by endothelial cells. However, the effects of CRP on chemokine expression by endothelial cells are not known.", 
    "10": "We tested the effects of CRP on the production of the chemokines monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and RANTES in cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The secretion of chemokines was assessed by ELISA. Incubation with 100 microgram/mL recombinant human CRP induced a 7-fold increase in MCP-1 but no change in RANTES secretion. We showed that the effect of CRP on MCP-1 was present even at 5 microgram/mL CRP, with stepwise increases as the CRP concentration was increased to 10, 50, and 100 microgram/mL. The effect of CRP on MCP-1 induction was not influenced by aspirin (at concentrations up to 1 mmol/L), but it was significantly inhibited by 5 micromol/L simvastatin. The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha activators fenofibrate (100 micromol/L) and Wy-14649 (100 micromol/L) almost completely abolished the induction of MCP-1, but the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma activator ciglitazone had only a moderate effect.", 
    "11": "These results further strengthen the role of CRP in the pathogenesis of vascular inflammation and, likely, atherosclerosis and provide a crucial insight into a novel mechanism of action of anti-atherosclerosis drugs such as simvastatin and fenofibrate.", 
    "12": "Recently, we demonstrated increased oxidative stress in the interstitium of ureteral obstructed kidneys based on the increased expression of heme oxygenase-1 and immunohistochemical detection of advanced glycation end products (AGE) in the interstitium. Antioxidant therapy may have a therapeutic potential toward interstitial fibrosis of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) kidneys. Fluvastatin is an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and has been demonstrated to have an antioxidant activity in vitro.", 
    "13": "The effects of fluvastatin on UUO kidneys from the viewpoints of antioxidant action in vivo and antifibrosis action were studied. To investigate the antioxidant action and its therapeutic efficacy of fluvastatin in UUO kidneys, AGE accumulation and fibrosis in the obstructed kidneys was compared among vehicle-, pravastatin-, or fluvastatin-treated (10 or 40 mg/kg/day) groups.", 
    "14": "Tubulointerstitial fibrosis was significantly attenuated in fluvastatin-treated animals. Fluvastatin significantly suppressed the degree of immunostaining of AGE in UUO kidneys.", 
    "15": "These results provide evidence for the antioxidant action of fluvastatin in vivo. The decreased interstitial fibrosis along with a decreased oxidative stress marker in the interstitial lesion strongly suggests the existence of a causal relationship between them. Fluvastatin may have therapeutic value in slowing or preventing interstitial fibrosis in progressive renal disease.", 
    "16": "In order to suppress de novo cholesterol and VLDL biosynthesis, a long-term therapy trial with lovastatin, a competitive inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, was initiated in two patients with cholesteryl ester storage disease (CESD), and concentrations of plasma lipids were monitored over a period of 9 years.", 
    "17": "We studied two male patients with enzymatically confirmed CESD in whom long-term lovastatin therapy (8 and 9 years) was begun at the age of 7 and 19 years. The diagnosis of CESD was confirmed by the measurement of human lysosomal acid lipase (hLAL) activity in cultured skin fibroblasts and leukocytes. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis revealed that both subjects are homozygotes for the common CESD splice site mutation. Levels of serum lipids and lipoproteins were measured yearly.", 
    "18": "During the first year, total serum cholesterol decreased from 317 to 201 mg/dl in Patient A and from 228 to 120 mg/dl in Patient B, due mainly to the reduction of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol from 262 to 151 mg/dt in Patient A and from 166 to 66 mg/dl in Patient B. Accordingly, the LDL cholesterol : high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ratio was markedly reduced in both patients after one year of therapy. The treatment was continued and, after 9 years of further medication, low total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol levels were still maintained.", 
    "19": "The study demonstrates that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are well tolerated drugs during long-term treatment of CESD patients and may help to prevent the development of premature atherosclerosis.", 
    "20": "The single-dose and steady-state pharmacokinetics of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor cerivastatin and its two major metabolites, M-1 and M-23, were evaluated in patients with renal failure on chronic hemodialysis.", 
    "21": "After having given their informed consent, 12 end-stage renal disease patients (5 female/7 male; 18 to 63 years) received a single-dose of 0.2 mg cerivastatin sodium followed by a 4-hour dialysis session for pharmacokinetic profiling. Two to four weeks later, all patients received 0.2 mg once-daily as maintenance treatment for a period of 7 days during which PK profiling was carried out on Days 1 and 7/8, both being dialysis-free days. Plasma concentrations of parent drug and active metabolites were measured by HPLC with fluorescence detection. In addition, assessment of lipid parameters, safety and tolerability, and a complete clinical chemistry program were included in the study procedures.", 
    "22": "Cerivastatin was well-tolerated and no serious adverse events were observed. In spite of the short treatment period, treatment responses with respect to total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides lowering were observed. Mean cerivastatin and metabolite concentrations and thus systemic exposure were slightly higher (up to 50%) in patients on chronic dialysis compared to previous studies carried out in healthy subjects. The unbound fraction of cerivastatin ranged from 0.6 - 1.5% in these patients (normal range: 0.5 - 0.9%). The half-lives of both parent drug (approximately 3 h) and metabolites remained unaffected and, most notably, no accumulation occurred under repeated dosing. In addition, cerivastatin clearance was not increased by concurrent dialysis as would be predicted from the high plasma protein-binding (> 99%), and there were no significant differences in cerivastatin exposure between the dialysis period and the dialysis-free profile days.", 
    "23": "Cerivastatin can be safely administered in the usual dosages to patients with end-stage renal disease on chronic hemodialysis. Based on the observed moderate increase in cerivastatin mean exposure, patients should be started at the lower end of the recommended dosing range and subsequent titration should be performed with caution.", 
    "24": "Following hepatectomy, liver \"knows\" when to start and when to stop growing, and thereby accurately regulates its mass. Partial hepatectomy triggers hepatocyte proliferation whereas excessive liver mass (transplant) is regulated by apoptosis. Liver regeneration mainly involves the activation of adult hepatocytes and possibly of liver precursor (\"stem\") cells. The multistep process of liver regeneration comprises at least 2 critical phases: the transition of the quiescent hepatocyte into the cell cycle (priming) and the progression beyond the restriction point in the G1 phase of the cycle. The priming phase is characterized by the expression of immediate early genes. Activation of protooncogenes in the immediate early gene response involves both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms. Activation of four transcription factors, NF kappa B, STAT3, AP-1, and C/EBP beta, causes secondary activation of multiple genes and plays an important role in the initiation of hepatic regeneration. The passage of primed hepatocytes through the cell cycle is characterized by the expression of cell cycle genes and requires growth factors. An equilibrium between stimulator and inhibitor genes of the cell cycle expressed after hepatectomy, may explain why the liver regeneration is a tightly regulated growth process. Based on the knowledge of the regulation of liver regeneration, several practical considerations and potential therapeutic strategies can be applied in humans with hepatic dysfunction due to liver resection.", 
    "25": "The fungal metabolite lovastatin and its derivatives are widely prescribed cholesterol-lowering drugs that act as potent inhibitors of (3S)-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase). These drugs and a number of analogs that have been approved for use in humans are manufactured by fermentation in combination with subsequent chemical or microbial modification. This review highlights early work done in the elucidation of lovastatin biosynthesis involving the use of labeled precursors and the incubation of putative intermediates with cell-free extracts from various fungal sources. A series of more contemporary papers are also reviewed, describing the use of gene cloning to identify the various functions of the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of lovastatin. In particular, overexpression, purification and the subsequent investigation of the various roles of lovastatin nonaketide synthase (LNKS) during lovastatin biosynthesis are discussed.", 
    "26": "Postprandial lipemia is associated with endothelial dysfunction. Remnant-like particles (RLP) have been suggested to contribute to these adverse vascular effects. We investigated the effect of cerivastatin and gemfibrozil upon oral fat load induced changes in endothelial function and postprandial lipid profile in vivo.", 
    "27": "In a randomized cross-over trial, 15 healthy volunteers received cerivastatin (0.4 mg once daily), gemfibrozil (900 mg once daily) or placebo for 3 weeks. Lipid profiles and flow mediated dilation (FMD) were assessed before and 4 h after an oral fat load. Endothelium-independent dilation was tested after nitroglycerine 0.4 mg sublingual spray.", 
    "28": "After the placebo period, the oral fat load induced an increase in triglycerides (TG) and RLP-cholesterol (RLP-C) (0.9 +/- 0.7 and 0.08 +/- 0.04 mmol/l, respectively) and a significant decrease in FMD (9.1 +/- 3.4 to 4.3 +/- 3.3%, P < 0.05). After gemfibrozil, TG increase was attenuated (0.5 +/- 0.5 mmol/l), whereas RLP-C increase (0.05 +/- 0.09 mmol/l) and FMD decrease (9.0 +/- 3.8 to 5.2 +/- 2.6%, P < 0.05) were not different from placebo therapy. Cerivastatin did not affect TG increase (0.7 +/- 0.8 mmol/l). RLP-C increase (0.02 +/- 0.07 mmol/l) and FMD (7.9 +/- 2.6 to 8.4 +/- 2.8%) change were attenuated significantly compared to placebo. Endothelium-independent vasodilatation remained unaltered throughout the protocol.", 
    "29": "Cerivastatin, but not gemfibrozil significantly reduces RLP-C increase after an oral fat load in combination with a reversal of fat-load induced endothelial dysfunction. The present data imply that lowering of RLP-C, rather than lowering of total TG levels, may contributes to the prevention of endothelial dysfunction after an oral fat load during statin use.", 
    "30": "Three landmark trials involving 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) were published between 1994 and 1996 (the Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study [4S], the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study, and the Cholesterol and Recurrent Events trial). These trials provided evidence that lipid-lowering therapy decreases cardiovascular events, including mortality. Whether these recent data caused a shift toward statin use has not been evaluated.", 
    "31": "Data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey in 1980, 1981, 1985, and 1989 through 1998 were used. We analyzed 5053 visits by patients taking lipid-lowering medications to office-based physicians selected by stratified random sampling. The main outcome measure was use of specific lipid-lowering medications, including statins.", 
    "32": "In 1980 resins and niacin were the most commonly used lipid-lowering medications. By 1985 rising use of fibrates caused reductions in niacin use and resin use. By 1989 statins replaced fibrates as the most heavily used medications. Statin use climbed continuously thereafter, accounting for 90% of visits by patients treated for hypercholesterolemia in 1998. In time series analyses, increases in overall statin use were temporally unrelated to the publication of clinical trials, although the 4S trial may have contributed to a shift from older statins to simvastatin. For patients receiving lipid-lowering therapy in 1993 to 1998, statin use was significantly more likely for female patients, white patients, and patients visiting cardiologists.", 
    "33": "Although the market for lipid-lowering medications is dominated by statins, the rise in statins predated the recent clinical trials supporting their use.", 
    "34": "Recent studies have demonstrated that women at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) benefit from cholesterol lowering to an extent similar to that of men. The ability to achieve established treatment goals for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in women with clearly defined risk factors has not been examined in detail.", 
    "35": "We have determined the efficacy and frequency of achieving target levels for LDL-C with atorvastatin on the basis of National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel II recommendations in 318 women according to the presence of CVD (198 women) or risk factors for CVD (120 women) and the presence of mixed dyslipidemia with obesity with or without CVD (72 women). Mean baseline LDL-C concentrations for women with established CVD were in the upper 10% of the distribution for age-matched North American women and, for those without CVD, were also extremely elevated and were in the top 5% of the LDL-C distribution for age-matched women in this population. The majority of participants without CVD (63%) reached LDL-C targets (LDL-C <or=160 mg/dL [4.1 mmol/L] if <2 CHD risk factors and LDL-C <or=130 mg/dL [3.4 mmol/L] if >or=2 CVD risk factors) with 10 mg atorvastatin and 79% reached targets with up to 20 mg of atorvastatin. For women with established CVD, 34% achieved an LDL-C <or=100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L) with 10 mg and 60% reached this target with up to 20 mg of atorvastatin. With maximal titration to the LDL-C target, up to and including 80 mg atorvastatin, 87% of women without CVD and 80% of women with established CVD achieved LDL-C targets. The presence of mixed dyslipidemia with obesity did not affect the frequency of achieving LDL-C targets.", 
    "36": "Atorvastatin is very effective in achieving National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel II target concentrations for LDL-C in the majority of women with established CVD or CVD risk factors.", 
    "37": "Randomized, controlled trials demonstrate that HMG CoA reductase inhibition reduces coronary event rates in both primary and secondary prevention. In addition to reducing cholesterol levels, laboratory evidence suggests that statins also have anti-inflammatory activity, a property that may be critical for maintaining plaque stability. Recently, the inflammatory marker high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) has been shown to predict vascular risk in individuals with and without hyperlipidemia. Furthermore, in the Cholesterol and Recurrent Events (CARE) trial, the relative efficacy of pravastatin in reducing events was greatest among those with elevated levels of hs-CRP. However, the time course and magnitude of this effect in both primary and secondary prevention is controversial.", 
    "38": "PRavastatin Inflammation CRP Evaluation (PRINCE) is an investigator-initiated, multicenter, community-based trial that will evaluate the effects of pravastatin on hs-CRP in up to 1182 individuals with coronary artery disease and up to 1702 individuals without coronary artery disease. Lipid profiles and hs-CRP levels will be obtained at baseline, 12 weeks, and 24 weeks in all study participants. Patients with known coronary artery disease will receive 40 mg/d pravastatin, whereas those without coronary artery disease will be randomly assigned to receive placebo or 40 mg/d pravastatin.", 
    "39": "The potential clinical impact of the PRINCE trial is substantial because nearly 50% of myocardial infarctions in the United States occur in persons with normal cholesterol levels, and inflammatory markers such as hs-CRP may provide a means to detect such individuals at high risk who do not currently qualify for statin therapy. The PRINCE trial will determine the time course of effect of this statin on hs-CRP and whether any observed effect on hs-CRP is independent of pravastatin-induced changes in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.", 
    "40": "Connective tissue growth factor (ccn; ctgf) gene expression is upregulated in fibrotic renal glomeruli. Therefore, the regulation and pharmacological modulation of ccn2 (ctgf) mRNA expression was investigated in a human renal mesangial cell line.", 
    "41": "A human renal mesangial cell line was cultured in vitro under standard conditions. After stimulation, RNA was extracted and ccn2 (ctgf) mRNA expression assessed by northern blot analysis.", 
    "42": "The expression of ccn2 (ctgf) mRNA was transiently upregulated by fetal calf serum. Very rapid onset but short lasting ccn2 (ctgf) mRNA expression was observed after stimulation with lysophosphatidic acid, a bioactive lipid, which activates G protein coupled receptors. Induction of ccn2 (ctgf) mRNA expression by transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) was more prolonged and lasted for more than one day. The small GTPases of the Rho family were essential for basal as well as induced ccn2 (ctgf) expression: preincubation of the cells with toxin B from Clostridium difficile abrogated ccn2 (ctgf) mRNA expression. HMG CoA reductase inhibitors, which are therapeutically used as lipid lowering drugs, interfere with the isoprenylation and thus activation of Rho proteins. Simvastatin, an HMG CoA reductase inhibitor, inhibited ccn2 (ctgf) mRNA expression in a concentration dependent manner (IC(50): 1-2 microM).", 
    "43": "Statins were identified as potent inhibitors of ccn2 (ctgf) mRNA expression in mesangial cells, and therefore might be of potential use to modulate the excessive ccn2 (ctgf) expression in mesangial cells related to glomerular fibrosis.", 
    "44": "Recent studies have reported that hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors have vasculoprotective effects independent of their lipid-lowering properties, including anti-inflammatory actions. We used intravital microscopy of the rat mesenteric microvasculature to examine the effects of rosuvastatin, a new HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, on leukocyte-endothelium interactions induced by thrombin. Intraperitoneal administration of 0.5 and 1.25 mg kg(-1) rosuvastatin 18 h prior to the study, significantly and dose-dependently attenuated leukocyte rolling, adherence, and transmigration in the rat mesenteric microvasculature superfused with 0.5 u ml(-1) thrombin. This protective effect of rosuvastatin was reversed by intraperitoneal injection of 25 mg kg(-1) mevalonic acid 18 h before the study. Immunohistochemical detection of the endothelial cell adhesion molecule P-selectin showed a 70% decrease in endothelial cell surface expression of P-selectin in thrombin-stimulated rats given 1.25 mg kg(-1) rosuvastatin. In addition, rosuvastatin enhanced release of nitric oxide (NO) from the vascular endothelium as measured directly in rat aortic segments. Moreover, rosuvastatin failed to attenuate leukocyte-endothelium interactions in peri-intestinal venules of eNOS(-/-) mice. These data indicate that rosuvastatin exerts important anti-inflammatory effects via inhibition of endothelial cell adhesion molecule expression, and that this protective action of rosuvastatin requires release of nitric oxide by the vascular endothelium. These data also demonstrate that the mechanism of the non-lipid lowering actions of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in vivo may be due to reduced formation or availability of mevalonic acid within endothelial cells.", 
    "45": "Lovastatin is a secondary metabolite produced by Aspergillus terreus. A chemically defined medium was developed in order to investigate the influence of carbon and nitrogen sources on lovastatin biosynthesis. Among several organic and inorganic defined nitrogen sources metabolized by A. terreus, glutamate and histidine gave the highest lovastatin biosynthesis level. For cultures on glucose and glutamate, lovastatin synthesis initiated when glucose consumption levelled off. When A. terreus was grown on lactose, lovastatin production initiated in the presence of residual lactose. Experimental results showed that carbon source starvation is required in addition to relief of glucose repression, while glutamate did not repress biosynthesis. A threefold-higher specific productivity was found with the defined medium on glucose and glutamate, compared to growth on complex medium with glucose, peptonized milk, and yeast extract.", 
    "46": "Further therapy should be considered for patients who have reached target low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels but have low plasma levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) since rates of coronary artery disease continue to be high for a sizable proportion of this population. Lifestyle approaches include dietary changes, smoking cessation, moderate alcohol intake, concomitant drug reassessment, and specific coexistent conditions. Aggressive statin therapy still leaves a high residual rate of cardiac events. Other drug approaches include estrogen, fibrate, niacin therapy, and combinations of these agents. Recent results from an ongoing trial of combination extended-release prescription niacin plus lovastatin are very promising.", 
    "47": "A growing number of trials that used fibrates and niacin alone or in combination with other lipid-altering agents have shown that both these drugs are effective for reducing total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides, and for increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. These lipid changes are associated with a reduction in events such as fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and transient ischemic attack. In angiographic trials, they are associated with disease regression, increased minimal luminal diameter, and protection from risk of new lesions. In a head-to-head comparison study, niacin 2,000 mg/day increased HDL-C more than gemfibrozil 1,200 mg/day, and decreased the total cholesterol-to-HDL-C ratio, lipoprotein (a) (Lp[a]), and fibrinogen levels significantly more. Combination therapies of niacin plus a resin or statin are effective, well tolerated, and safe.", 
    "48": "Bile acid sequestrants, fibric acid derivatives (fibrates), hydroxy-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors (\"statins\"), and niacin are able to increase HDL-C serum concentrations to varying degrees. Bile acid sequestrants are the least effective, whereas niacin is the most powerful agent for increasing HDL-C levels. Because of 2 alternate metabolic pathways of niacin breakdown, flushing or hepatotoxicity can occur in patients taking niacin. These effects can be mediated in a carefully designed formulation of niacin that releases the drug at a predictable rate. Niacin has few drug interactions and is a relatively inexpensive means of increasing HDL-C. A combination formulation that combines niacin plus a statin has shown promise in ongoing clinical trials.", 
    "49": "Administration of pravastatin soon after transplantation successfully lowers cholesterol levels, whereas a reduced number of acute rejection episodes is accompanied by a decrease in natural killer (NK) cell activity. As a consistent low NK cell activity caused by pravastatin might impair tumor surveillance leading to cancer, we studied the effect of pravastatin on NK cell activity in stable renal transplant patients.", 
    "50": "From 14 cyclosporine (CsA)-treated and 11 azathioprine (AZA)-treated patients with hypercholesterolemia, more than 1 year after kidney transplantation, we determined NK cell number and cytotoxic activity before, and at 6 and 12 weeks after, initiating pravastatin treatment. Additionally, cholesterol levels and liver and kidney function parameters were assessed.", 
    "51": "During pravastatin treatment, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels decreased significantly in both patient groups. In the CsA group, the number and cytotoxic activity of the NK cells at 12 weeks after institution of pravastatin was in the same range as before pravastatin. Additionally, in the AZA group, pravastatin did not influence the number of NK cells. However, in the AZA group, both the number of NK cells and their cytotoxic activity were significantly (<0.002) lower compared to the values in the CsA group.", 
    "52": "In contrast to previous reports on decreased NK cell cytotoxicity caused by pravastatin treatment early after transplantation, we cannot confirm these results in stable kidney recipients. In our hands, NK cell cytotoxicity during pravastatin treatment was within the same range as in the absence of pravastatin. Thus, in view of the potential role of NK cells in tumor surveillance, these data are reassuring.", 
    "53": "Concomitant use of fibrates with statins has been associated with an increased risk of myopathy, but the underlying mechanism of this adverse reaction remains unclear. Our aim was to study the effects of bezafibrate and gemfibrozil on the pharmacokinetics of lovastatin.", 
    "54": "This was a randomized, double-blind, 3-phase crossover study. Eleven healthy volunteers took 400 mg/day bezafibrate, 1200 mg/day gemfibrozil, or placebo for 3 days. On day 3, each subject ingested a single 40 mg dose of lovastatin. Plasma concentrations of lovastatin, lovastatin acid, gemfibrozil, and bezafibrate were measured up to 24 hours.", 
    "55": "Gemfibrozil markedly increased the plasma concentrations of lovastatin acid, without affecting those of the parent lovastatin compared with placebo. During the gemfibrozil phase, the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours [AUC(0-24)] of lovastatin acid was 280% (range, 131% to 1184%; P < .001) and the peak plasma concentration (Cmax) was 280% (range, 123% to 1042%; P < .05) of the corresponding value during the placebo phase. Bezafibrate had no statistically significant effect on the AUC(0-24) or Cmax of lovastatin or lovastatin acid compared with placebo.", 
    "56": "Gemfibrozil markedly increases plasma concentrations of lovastatin acid, but bezafibrate does not. The increased risk of myopathy observed during concomitant treatment with statins and fibrates may be partially of a pharmacokinetic origin. The risk of developing myopathy during concomitant therapy with lovastatin and a fibrate may be smaller with bezafibrate than with gemfibrozil.", 
    "57": "Numerous studies have shown that elevated plasma cholesterol can exacerbate renal disease. However, the effect of lipids on renal structure and vascular function in normal kidneys is less well established. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of hypercholesterolaemia on glomerular structure and vascular reactivity of segmental arteries in rabbits. In addition, we also studied whether or not atorvastatin can prevent these structural and vascular alterations in hypercholesterolaemic rabbits.", 
    "58": "Male New Zealand rabbits were fed either a normal rabbit chow or a diet containing 1% cholesterol and treated or not with atorvastatin (1 mg/kg/day) for 12 weeks. Dose-response curves to acetylcholine (10(-9)-10(-4) mol/l) and sodium nitroprusside (10(-9)-10(-4) mol/l) were studied in segmental arteries in the presence or absence of the thromboxane A2/PGH2 receptor antagonist ifetroban (10(-5) mol/l). Glomerular size and structure were also evaluated.", 
    "59": "Compared with control animals, hypercholesterolaemic rabbits presented glomerular hypertrophy and several types of injuries (capillary collapse, hyalinosis and alterations of Bowman's capsule), suggesting diffuse glomerulosclerosis. Segmental arteries also showed relaxing responses to acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside which were lower than and similar to, respectively, those of control animals. The presence of ifetroban improved the acetylcholine response only in hypercholesterolaemic rabbits. Atorvastatin treatment prevented vascular and most glomerular changes associated with hypercholesterolaemia even in the presence of very high cholesterol levels.",

    "61": "Both lovastatin (a fungal product) and a tocotrienol rich fraction (TRF(25), a mixture of tocols isolated from stabilized and heated rice bran containing desmethyl [d-P(21)-T3] and didesmethyl [d-P(25)-T3] tocotrienols) are potent hypocholesterolemic agents, although they suppress cholesterol biosynthesis by different mechanisms. To determine additive and/or synergistic effects of both agents, chickens were fed diets supplemented with 50 ppm TRF(25) or d-P(25)-T3 in combination with 50 ppm lovastatin for 4 weeks. Combinations of d-P(25)-T3 with lovastatin were found most effective in reducing serum total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol compared to the control diet or individual supplements. The mixture of TRF(25)+lovastatin inhibited the activity of beta-hydroxy-beta-methylglutaryl coenzymeA reductase (21%) compared to lovastatin alone, which did not change its activity. Cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase activity was increased by lovastatin (11%) and by lovastatin plus TRF(25) (19%). TRF(25)+lovastatin decreased levels of serum total cholesterol (22%), LDL cholesterol (42%), apolipoprotein B (13-38%), triglycerides (19%), thromboxane B(2) (34%) and platelet factor 4 (26%), although high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and apolipoprotein A1 levels were unaffected. The mixture of TRF(25)+lovastatin showed greater effects than did the individual treatments alone, reflecting possible additive pharmacological actions. The effects, however, of the d-P(25)-T3/lovastatin combination were no greater than that of d-P(25)-T3 alone, possibly indicating that d-P(25)-T3 produced a maximum cholesterol lowering effect at the concentration used.", 
    "62": "We have recently shown that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane protein, is degraded in ER membranes prepared from sterol pretreated cells and that such degradation is catalyzed by a cysteine protease within the reductase membrane domain. The use of various protease inhibitors suggested that degradation of HMG-CoA reductase in vitro is catalyzed by a cathepsin L-type cysteine protease. Purified ER contains E-64-sensitive cathepsin L activity whose inhibitor sensitivity was well matched to that of HMG-CoA reductase degradation in vitro. CLIK-148 (cathepsin L inhibitor) inhibited degradation of HMG-CoA reductase in vitro. Purified cathepsin L also efficiently cleaved HMG-CoA reductase in isolated ER preparations. To determine whether a cathepsin L-type cysteine protease is involved in sterol-regulated degradation of HMG-CoA reductase in vivo, we examined the effect of E-64d, a membrane-permeable cysteine protease inhibitor, in living cells. While lactacystin, a proteasome-specific inhibitor, inhibited sterol-dependent degradation of HMG-CoA reductase, E-64d failed to do so. In contrast, degradation of HMG-CoA reductase in sonicated cells was inhibited by E-64d, CLIK-148, and leupeptin but not by lactacystin. Our results indicate that HMG-CoA reductase is degraded by the proteasome under normal conditions in living cells and that it is cleaved by cathepsin L leaked from lysosomes during preparation of the ER, thus clarifying the apparently paradoxical in vivo and in vitro results. Cathepsin L-dependent proteolysis was observed to occur preferentially in sterol-pretreated cells, suggesting that sterol treatment results in conformational changes in HMG-CoA reductase that make it more susceptible to such cleavage.", 
    "63": "Fluvastatin, the first fully synthetic HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, has been shown to reduce cholesterol in patients with hyperlipidaemia, to prevent subsequent coronary events in patients with established coronary heart disease, and to alter endothelial function and plaque stability in animal models. Fluvastatin is relatively hydrophilic, compared with the semisynthetic HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, and, therefore, it is extensively absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. After absorption, it is nearly completely extracted and metabolised in the liver to 2 hydroxylated metabolites and an N-desisopropyl metabolite, which are excreted in the bile. Approximately 95% of a dose is recovered in the faeces, with 60% of a dose recovered as the 3 metabolites. The 6-hydroxy and N-desisopropyl fluvastatin metabolites are exclusively generated by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C9 and do not accumulate in the blood. CYP2C9, CYP3A4, CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 form the 5-hydroxy fluvastatin metabolite. Because of its hydrophilic nature and extensive plasma protein binding, fluvastatin has a small volume of distribution with minimal concentrations in extrahepatic tissues. The pharmacokinetics of fluvastatin are not influenced by renal function, due to its extensive metabolism and biliary excretion; limited data in patients with cirrhosis suggest a 30% reduction in oral clearance. Age and gender do not appear to affect the disposition of fluvastatin. CYP3A4 inhibitors (erythromycin, ketoconazole and itraconazole) have no effect on fluvastatin pharmacokinetics, in contrast to other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors which are primarily metabolised by CYP3A and are subject to potential drug interactions with CYP3A inhibitors. Coadministration of fluvastatin with gastrointestinal agents such as cholestyramine, and gastric acid regulating agents (H2 receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors), significantly alters fluvastatin disposition by decreasing and increasing bioavailability, respectively. The nonspecific CYP inducer rifampicin (rifampin) significantly increases fluvastatin oral clearance. In addition to being a CYP2C9 substrate, fluvastatin demonstrates inhibitory effects on this isoenzyme in vitro and in vivo. In human liver microsomes, fluvastatin significantly inhibits the hydroxylation of 2 CYP2C9 substrates, tolbutamide and diclofenac. The oral clearances of the CYP2C9 substrates diclofenac, tolbutamide, glibenclamide (glyburide) and losartan are reduced by 15 to 25% when coadministered with fluvastatin. These alterations have not been shown to be clinically significant. There are inadequate data evaluating the potential interaction of fluvastatin with warfarin and phenytoin, 2 CYP2C9 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index, and caution is recommended when using fluvastatin with these agents. Fluvastatin does not appear to have a significant effect on other CYP isoenzymes or P-glycoprotein-mediated transport in vivo.", 
    "64": "The enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase catalyses the rate limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis and is markedly inhibited by the statin family of drugs. The effect of statins on lipid lowering is clearly defined, but the ability of the drugs to directly regulate inflammatory functions has not been well explored. In this report, we show that there are differences among the statins in their capacity to induce proinflammatory responses both in human monocytes in vitro, and in leukocytes in mice in vivo. Treatment of human monocytes with lipophilic statins alone stimulated the production of MCP-1, IL-8, TNF-alpha and IL-1 beta and markedly sensitized the cells to subsequent challenge with inflammatory agents. Lipophilic statins also increased the production of reactive oxygen species in monocytes. In contrast, pretreatment of cells with the hydrophilic pravastatin did not induce these heightened inflammatory responses. Furthermore, treatment of mice with lipophilic statins caused a markedly higher influx of leukocytes into the inflamed peritoneal cavity following challenge with thioglycollate. Overall, these results demonstrate that the lipophilic statins influence a regulatory pathway in monocytes that controls cytokine production and that the statins induce different pro-inflammatory responses both in vitro and in vivo.", 
    "65": "Identification of mutations in the ATP binding cassette transporter (ABCA1) gene in patients with Tangier disease, who exhibit reduced HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) and apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1) levels and premature coronary atherosclerosis, has led to the hypothesis that common polymorphisms in the ABCA1 gene could determine HDL-C and apoA1 levels and the risk of coronary atherosclerosis in the general population. We sequenced a 660-bp 5' fragment of the ABCA1 gene in 24 subjects and identified 3 novel polymorphisms: -477C/T, -419A/C, and -320G/C. We developed assays, genotyped 372 participants in the prospective Lipoprotein Coronary Atherosclerosis Study (LCAS), and determined the association of the variants with fasting plasma lipids and indices of quantitative coronary angiograms obtained at baseline and 2.5 years after randomization to fluvastatin or placebo. Distribution of -477C/T and -320G/C genotypes were 127 CC, 171 CT, and 74 TT and 130 GG, 168 GC, and 75 CC, respectively, and were in complete linkage disequilibrium (P<0.0001). Data for -477C/T are presented. The -419A/C variant was uncommon (present in 1 of 63 subjects). Heterozygous subjects had a modest reduction in HDL-C (P=0.09) and apoA1 (P=0.05) levels and a lesser response of apoA1 to treatment with fluvastatin (P=0.04). The mean number of coronary lesions causing 30% to 75% diameter stenosis was greater in subjects with the TT genotype (3.1+/-2.1) or CT genotype (2.9+/-1.9) than in subjects with the CC genotype (2.2+/-1.8) (P=0.002). Similarly, compared with subjects with the CC genotype, greater numbers of subjects with the TT or CT genotype had >/=1 coronary lesion (P=0.001). No association between the genotypes and progression of coronary atherosclerosis or clinical events was detected. We conclude that ABCA1 genotypes are potential risk factors for coronary atherosclerosis in the general population.", 
    "66": "Interindividual variability in low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (LDL-C) response during treatment with statins is well documented but poorly understood. To investigate potential metabolic and genetic determinants of statin responsiveness, 19 patients with refractory heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia were sequentially treated with placebo, atorvastatin (10 mg/d), bile acid sequestrant, and the 2 combined, each for 4 weeks. Levels of LDL-C, mevalonic acid (MVA), 7-alpha-OH-4-cholesten-3-one, and leukocyte LDL receptor and hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase mRNA were determined after each treatment period. Atorvastatin (10 mg/d) reduced LDL-C by an overall mean of 32.5%. Above-average responders (LDL-C -39.5%) had higher basal MVA levels (34.4+/-6.1 micromol/L) than did below-average responders (LDL-C -23.6%, P<0.02; basal MVA 26.3+/-6.1 micromol/L, P<0.01). Fewer good responders compared with the poor responders had an apolipoprotein E4 allele (3 of 11 versus 6 of 8, respectively; P<0.05). There were no baseline differences between them in 7-alpha-OH-4-cholesten-3-one, hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase mRNA, or LDL receptor mRNA, but the latter increased in the good responders on combination therapy (P<0.05). Severe mutations were not more common in poor than in good responders. We conclude that poor responders to statins have a low basal rate of cholesterol synthesis that may be secondary to a genetically determined increase in cholesterol absorption, possibly mediated by apolipoprotein E4. If so, statin responsiveness could be enhanced by reducing dietary cholesterol intake or inhibiting absorption.", 
    "67": "Atherogenic levels of native low density lipoproteins (nLDLs) decrease the bioavailability of endothelium-derived NO and downregulate endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) expression in cultured human endothelial cells. Here, we show that simvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, within the therapeutic range (0.01 to 1 micromol/L) prevented the downregulation of eNOS mRNA and protein promoted by nLDL (180 mg cholesterol/dL, 48 hours) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. This effect of simvastatin was completely reversed by mevalonate, the product of the reaction, and to a lesser extent by farnesol and geranyl geraniol. Simvastatin significantly stabilized eNOS mRNA in cells treated with nLDL during 48 hours (eNOS mRNA half-life approximately 11 hours in controls versus >24 hours in nLDL per 0.1 micromol/L simvastatin-treated cells). The downregulation of eNOS by nLDL was abrogated by cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, and by N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal, a protease inhibitor that reduces the catabolism of sterol regulatory element binding proteins. Sterol deprivation increased the downregulation produced by nLDL on eNOS and sterol regulatory element binding protein-2 expression levels. However, no differential modulation of the retardation bands corresponding to the putative sterol-responsive element present in the eNOS promoter was detected by electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Our results suggest that nLDL promote eNOS downregulation operating at a transcriptional level, whereas simvastatin prevents such an effect through a posttranscriptional mechanism.", 
    "68": "The mechanism of the antithrombotic action of statins is unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of simvastatin on the coagulation process at sites of microvascular injury.", 
    "69": "Tissue factor-initiated coagulation was assessed in blood samples collected every 30 seconds from bleeding-time wounds of 17 patients who had advanced coronary artery disease and total cholesterol levels of 224.6+/-11.8 mg/dL (mean+/-SEM). Quantitative Western blotting for time courses of fibrinogen depletion and activation of prothrombin, factor V, and factor XIII was performed before and after 3 months of simvastatin treatment (20 mg/d). Simvastatin induced reductions in total cholesterol (23%) and LDL-cholesterol (36%), which were accompanied by significant decreases in the rates of prothrombin activation (16.2+/-2.1%; P=0.004), formation of alpha-thrombin B-chain (27.4+/-1.8%; P=0.001), generation of factor Va heavy chain (29.7+/-3.1%; P=0.007) and factor Va light chain (18.9+/-1.2%; P=0.02), factor XIII activation (19.8+/-1.3%; P=0.001), and fibrinogen conversion to fibrin (72.2+/-3%; P=0.002). Posttreatment fibrinopeptides A and B concentrations, determined by using high-performance liquid chromatography, were reduced within the last 30 seconds of bleeding. The 30-kDa fragment of the factor Va heavy chain (residues 307 to 506), produced by activated protein C, and the 97-kDa fragment of the factor Va heavy chain (residues 1 to 643) were released more rapidly after simvastatin treatment. The antithrombotic actions of simvastatin showed no relationship to its cholesterol-lowering action.",

We reported a 31-year-old Chinese male in Hong Kong, who has the characteristic features of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis including the multiple xanthomas of tendons, mental retardation, bilateral cataracts, cerebellar ataxia and spasticity of the left arm, high concentrations of plasma phytosterols and abnormal MR of brain. On screening the family, two other siblings of 27 and 29 respectively, have tendon xanthomas and high plasma phytosterols. An extensive search of the international medical literature, including the Medline, has revealed only one other case report of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis in Taiwan. CTX is a potentially treatable disease. It is hoped by alertness, early diagnosis and treatment can be made, and hence prevent further progression of the disease.", 
    "72": "Two randomized, two-period crossover studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of repeat oral dosing of troglitazone (Study I) and pioglitazone (Study II) on the pharmacokinetics of plasma HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors following multiple oral doses of simvastatin and of simvastatin on the plasma pharmacokinetics of troglitazone (Study I) in healthy subjects. In both studies, each subject received two treatments. Treatment A consisted of once-daily oral doses of troglitazone 400 mg (Study I) or pioglitazone 45 mg (Study II) for 24 days with coadministration of once-daily doses of simvastatin 40 mg (Study I) or 80 mg (Study II) on Days 15 through 24. Treatment B consisted of once-daily oral doses of simvastatin 40 mg (Study I) or 80 mg (Study II) for 10 days. In Study I, the area under the plasma concentration-time profiles (AUC) and maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors in subjects who received both troglitazone and simvastatin were decreased modestly (by approximately 30% for Cmax and approximately 40% for AUC), but time to reach Cmax (tmax) did not change, as compared with those who received simvastatin alone. Simvastatin, administered orally as a 40 mg tablet daily for 10 days, did not affect the AUC or tmax (p > 0.5) but caused a small but clinically insignificant increase (approximately 25%) in Cmax for troglitazone. In Study II, pioglitazone, at the highest approved dose for clinical use, did not significantly alter any of the pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC, Cmax, and tmax) of simvastatin HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity. For all treatment regimens, side effects were mild and transient, suggesting that coadministration of simvastatin with either troglitazone or pioglitazone was well tolerated. The modest effect of troglitazone on simvastatin pharmacokinetics is in agreement with the suggestion that troglitazone is an inducer of CYP3A. The insignificant effect of simvastatin on troglitazone pharmacokinetics is consistent with the conclusion that simvastatin is not a significant inhibitor for drug-metabolizing enzymes. The lack of pharmacokinetic effect of pioglitazone on simvastatin supports the expectation that this combination may be used safely.", 
    "73": "Coronary heart disease is still the major cause of death in industrialized countries. Multiple primary or secondary interventional trials to lower serum cholesterol in humans have resulted in significant reduction of coronary events and death, one of the major reasons attributed to developing a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor such as pravastatin. Developing new inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis is still common in the pharmaceutical industry. Tannin comprises a large group of natural polyphenolic compounds possessing antioxidant effects. The methods for analysis of specific inhibitors of mevalonate biosynthesis have already been well established by using Vero cells, a cell line obtained from kidneys of African green monkeys. Tannin derivatives isolated from different traditional Chinese herbs were dissolved in DMSO and incubated with Vero cells with or without the addition of 1 mmol/l mevalonate or 5 mmol/l sodium acetate for 24 h in order to observe cell growth. Pravastatin, a specific HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, was used as positive control which could inhibit Vero cells growth effectively and cell growth inhibition was reversible after adding 1 mmol/l mevalonate. More than 50 tannin derivatives were used for the study, but only two compounds - proanthrocyanidin A-2 (belonging to the flavan-3-ol group) and 1,2,3,6-tetra-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose (belonging to the gallotannin group) - showed significant growth inhibition of Vero cells. This study showed that some isolated tannin derivatives from traditional herbs were effective HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors which might be developed into new hypocholesterolemic agents.", 
    "74": "Pantethine is a versatile and well-tolerated hypolipidemic agent whose efficacy in this regard appears to be mediated by its catabolic product cystamine, a nucleophile which avidly attacks disulfide groups. An overview of pantethine research suggests that the hypotriglyceridemic activity of pantethine reflects cystamine-mediated inhibition of the hepatic acetyl-CoA carboxylase, which can be expected to activate hepatic fatty acid oxidation. Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase as well as a more distal enzyme in the cholesterol synthetic pathway may account for pantethine's hypocholesterolemic effects. If pantethine does indeed effectively inhibit hepatic acetyl-CoA carboxylase, it may have adjuvant utility in the hepatothermic therapy of obesity. As a safe and effective compound of natural origin, pantethine merits broader use in the management of hyperlipidemias.",

The parameters used to assess lung injury included: Wet to dry lung weight ratio (W:D), myeloperoxidase activity (MPO), protein concentration (BALprot) and neutrophil count (BAL PMN) of bronchoaveolar lavage fluid.

    "79": "Zebrafish are a valuable model for mammalian lipid metabolism; larvae process lipids similarly through the intestine and hepatobiliary system and respond to drugs that block cholesterol synthesis in humans. After ingestion of fluorescently quenched phospholipids, endogenous lipase activity and rapid transport of cleavage products results in intense gall bladder fluorescence. Genetic screening identifies zebrafish mutants, such as fat free, that show normal digestive organ morphology but severely reduced phospholipid and cholesterol processing. Thus, fluorescent lipids provide a sensitive readout of lipid metabolism and are a powerful tool for identifying genes that mediate vertebrate digestive physiology.", 
    "80": "Although hyperlipidemia is associated with the development of diabetes complications, the effect of lipid reduction on microvascular complications is unknown. We initiated a 2-year, randomized, double-blinded placebo-controlled pilot trial of simvastatin/diet vs. diet alone in Type 1 diabetic patients without overt nephropathy. Thirty-nine patients with LDL cholesterol 100-160 mg/dl, >10 year duration of diabetes and an albumin excretion rate (AER) <200 microg/min were recruited for study. The primary end-point was change in AER. Secondary end-points were change in ankle-brachial index, progression of retinopathy status, change in vibratory threshold, and development of new clinical neuropathy. Nineteen patients were treated with simvastatin and twenty with placebo. However, because of the lowering of drug initiation levels by the American Diabetes Association, the trial was terminated early with 2 subjects reaching 2 years, 17 reaching 18 months, 36 reaching 1 year, and all 6 months. Simvastatin significantly reduced total cholesterol (mean on treatment 173.4 vs. 191.4, P=.020) and LDL cholesterol (mean on treatment 105.0 vs. 127.7, P<.001). Simvastatin therapy was associated with a slower rise in AER compared to placebo, though the result was not statistically significant (median rate of change/month 0.004 vs. 0.029). There was a trend towards slower progression of neuropathy as measured by vibratory threshold (median change at 1 year 0.03 simvastatin vs. 0.94, P=.07). There was no difference in change in ankle-brachial index, clinical neuropathy status, or retinopathy status. In conclusion, treatment with simvastatin may have a beneficial effect on early nephropathy and diabetic neuropathy, justifying a fully powered trial. However, this would be difficult under current treatment guidelines.",

    "88": "Involvement of LST-1 (a human liver-specific transporter, also called OATP2) as the major transporter in the uptake of pravastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, by human liver was demonstrated. The hepatic uptake of pravastatin evaluated using human hepatocytes was Na(+)-independent and reached saturation with a Michaelis constant (K(m)) of 11.5 +/- 2.2 microM. The uptake of pravastatin was temperature-dependent and was inhibited by estradiol-17beta-D-glucuronide, taurocholic acid, bromosulfophthalein, and simvastatin acid, but not by p-aminohippurate. Estradiol-17beta-D-glucuronide competitively inhibited pravastatin uptake with an inhibition constant comparable to the K(m) value for estradiol-17beta-D-glucuronide transport, indicating that a common transporter mediates the transport of pravastatin and estradiol-17beta-D-glucuronide in human hepatocytes. The results obtained with human hepatocytes agreed with those obtained with LST-1 expressing Xenopus oocytes. Oocytes microinjected with human liver polyadenylated mRNA showed Na(+)-independent uptake of pravastatin and estradiol-17beta-D-glucuronide. A simultaneous injection of LST-1 antisense oligonucleotides completely abolished this uptake. Expression of LST-1 was immunohistochemically demonstrated in the human hepatocytes, but not in Hep G2 cells, which showed very low uptake of pravastatin. Therefore, LST-1 was regarded as a key molecule for pravastatin in liver-specific inhibition of cholesterol synthesis, making pravastatin accessible to the target enzyme, which would otherwise not be inhibited by this hydrophilic drug.",

After vehicle, 2 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) simvastatin, 2 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) atorvastatin, or 4 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) pravastatin were administered orally for 6 days, the thoracic cavity was opened, and the heart was removed under pentobarbital sodium (30 mg/kg ip) anesthesia. The heart was perfused to remove residual blood. After the heart was blotted dry, the right and left ventricular free walls were dissected. Each free wall was weighed and used for determination of DNA, RNA, and protein concentrations and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activity. Simvastatin and atorvastatin resulted in smaller increases with age in the weight, concentrations of RNA and protein, and activity of MAP kinase in the left ventricular free wall, whereas pravastatin did not. The parameters of heart growth in the right ventricular free wall were not appreciably affected by either drug. The blood pressure and heart rate were not changed by the treatments. These results suggest that simvastatin and atorvastatin interfere with heart growth in neonatal piglets after birth, especially in the left ventricular free wall.", 
    "90": "Increased vascular endothelial cell growth factor (VEGF) may be important in cardiovascular pathophysiology (perhaps relating to angiogenesis and collateral vessel development) and binds target endothelium via receptors such as Flt-1. We hypothesized that there would be increased levels of plasma VEGF and Flt-1 in patients with atherosclerosis and others with hyperlipidemia compared with controls, and a reduction in these factors with 3 months of lipid-lowering therapy. Twenty patients with uncomplicated hyperlipidemia but no atherosclerosis, 20 patients with hyperlipidemia plus clear atherosclerosis, and 40 matched controls were studied. Plasma VEGF was higher in patient groups than in healthy controls (p <0.01), but Flt-1 was not significantly altered. After lipid-lowering therapy, patients with uncomplicated hyperlipidemia had significantly reduced total cholesterol and VEGF (all p <0.05) but no significant change in Flt-1. Lack of a significant correlation between the von Willebrand factor and VEGF suggests the latter is unrelated to endothelial damage. Plasma VEGF that increases in patients with uncomplicated hyperlipidemia free of major underlying atherosclerosis and in patients with hyperlipidemia plus established atherosclerosis is reduced by successful lipid-lowering treatment. These findings may have implications for the pathophysiology and treatment of hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis, and suggest an alternative mechanism (i.e., modulation of angiogenesis) by which lipid-lowering therapy may reduce cardiovascular events beyond lipid reduction alone.",

The reduction of endothelin synthesis in the range of 21-46% was higher with the combination than with the monosubstances; the reduction, however, was not statistically significant. The expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase was not significantly increased by the combination compared with the monosubstances, however, a tendency to an additive increase was observed. For the synthesis of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, no significant changes were seen for either the monosubstances or the combination. The synthesis of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 was decreased by the combination between 21% and 40%; the decrease, however, was not statistically significant compared with the effect of the monosubstances. The effective estradiol concentrations are higher than can be achieved by replacement therapy; in contrast, fluvastatin was effective at concentrations that can be reached during clinical treatment.",

Significantly more patients in secondary prevention than in primary prevention achieved the treatment goal (44% versus 17%), more patients with than without diabetes achieved it (45% versus 34%), and more men than women (42% versus 27%). These differences were mainly due to differences in base levels of total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol.

Assuming the effectiveness of statin treatment decreased with age, a 10-year risk, corresponding to Euro 18 000, varied from 11% (under age 30) to 41% (over age 80).

The developed model allows comparison of cost effectiveness of statin therapy across a wide range of subjects with or without coronary heart disease. The consensus committee in the Netherlands postulated that drug therapy should be considered in subjects with or without coronary heart disease in which cost-effectiveness is similar. Such groups can be identified using the presented model. When cost effectiveness ratios up to Euro 18 000 per life year gained are deemed acceptable, statin treatment should be considered in most patients with known cardiovascular disease (secondary prevention), and in a limited group of subjects who are at high risk of developing coronary heart disease (primary prevention).", 
    "112": "Thyrotropin (TSH)-initiated cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase in FRTL-5 thyroid cells requires serum, insulin, or insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and involves activation of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase, geranylgeranylation of RhoA, p27Kip1 degradation, and activation of cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) 2. In the present report, we show that the serine-threonine kinase Akt is an important mediator of insulin/IGF-1/serum effects on cell cycle progression in FRTL-5 thyroid cells. The phosphoinositol (OH) 3 kinase inhibitors, Wortmannin (WM) and Ly294002 (LY), block the ability of insulin/IGF-1 to reduce p27 expression, to induce expression of cyclins E, D1, and A as well as cdk 2 and 4, and to phosphorylate retinoblastoma protein. They also inhibit insulin/IGF-1-increased DNA synthesis and cell cycle entrance (S+G2/M). Insulin/IGF-1 rapidly induced activation of Aktl in a PI3 kinase-dependent manner, and increased Aktl RNA levels. Most importantly, FRTL-5 cells transfected with a constitutively active form of Aktl have higher basal rates of DNA synthesis and no longer require exogenous insulin/IGF-1 or serum for TSH-induced growth. In sum, Aktl appears to have an important role in insulin/IGF-1 regulation of FRTL-5 thyroid cell growth and cell cycle progression.",

    "114": "Experimental observations suggest that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (\"statins\") reduce the risk of restenosis. The activity of statins limits the rate of synthesis, not only of cholesterol, but also of a range of other molecules involved in cellular function. Their benefits in primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerosis have been widely recognized. Clinical trials using different types of statins were designed to evaluate their ability to influence the incidence of restenosis after successful conventional PTCA. The results clearly demonstrated that statins reduce lipid levels but do not prevent restenosis. Experimental evidence has failed to translate into clinical effect. The underlying pathological reasons for this shortcoming as well as promising alternative approaches including vascular gene therapy and brachytherapy will be discussed in this review.",

Statins are HMGR inhibitors with inhibition constant values in the nanomolar range that effectively lower serum cholesterol levels and are widely prescribed in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. We have determined structures of the catalytic portion of human HMGR complexed with six different statins. The statins occupy a portion of the binding site of HMG-CoA, thus blocking access of this substrate to the active site. Near the carboxyl terminus of HMGR, several catalytically relevant residues are disordered in the enzyme-statin complexes. If these residues were not flexible, they would sterically hinder statin binding.",

This double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled trial, in 6,605 generally healthy middle-aged and older men and women, had prespecified end point and cancer analyses. All analyses were intention-to-treat. Safety monitoring included history, physical examination, and laboratory studies (including hepatic transaminases and creatine phosphokinase [CPK]). All participants, even those who discontinued treatment, were contacted annually for vital status, cardiovascular events, and cancer history. After an average of 5.2 years of follow-up, there were 157 deaths (80 receiving lovastatin and 77 receiving placebo; relative risk [RR] 1.04; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.76 to 1.42; p = 0.82); of which 115 were noncardiovascular (RR 1.21; CI 0.84 to 1.74; p = 0.31), and of these, 82 were due to cancer (RR 1.41; CI 0.91 to 2.19; p = 0.13). There were no significant differences between treatment groups in overall cancer rates, discontinuations for noncardiovascular adverse experiences, or clinically important elevations of hepatic transaminases or CPK. Among those who used cytochrome P450 isoform (CYP3A4) inhibitors, there were no treatment group differences in the frequency of clinically important muscle-related adverse events. Treatment with lovastatin 20 to 40 mg daily for primary prevention of coronary heart disease was well tolerated and reduced the risk of first acute coronary events without increasing the risk of either noncardiovascular mortality or cancer.", 
    "117": "Osteonecrosis is a devastating complication of systemic steroid use. Prolonged steroid use produces a hyperlipidemic state in most patients and puts them at risk for osteoporosis and osteonecrosis. The fat content within the femoral head increases, resulting in increased intracortical pressure that may lead to sinusoidal collapse and osteonecrosis. Statins are lipid-clearing agents that dramatically reduce lipid levels in blood and tissues. Statins are widely used to prevent cardiovascular disease and have been shown to reduce the adverse effects of steroids on lipid metabolism. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the use of statin drugs affects later development of osteonecrosis in patients receiving steroids. The records of 284 patients who were taking statin drugs at the time they were started on high dose steroids were examined to determine whether osteonecrosis had developed. The patients remained on statin drugs during the entire time of steroid exposure. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were used to verify the osteonecrosis unless it was visible by radiograph. After an average of 7.5 years (minimum followup, 5 years), only three patients (1%) from the group had osteonecrosis develop. This 1% incidence is much less than the 3% to 20% incidence usually reported for patients receiving high-dose steroids. Statins may offer some protection against having osteonecrosis develop when steroid treatment is necessary.", 
    "118": "In the treatment of hyperlipoproteinaemias (HLP) our main effort should be treatment of the patient and not achievement of defined biochemical values. The basic goals of HLP treatment can be defined on the basis of results of intervention studies as follows: reduction of general mortality, reduction of morbidity from IHD, reduction of the incidence of CMP, improved course of ischaemia of the lower extremities, better quality of life of patients with cardiovascular disease and reduced necessity of revascularization surgery. Even if we shall assume that the positive effect of treatment with HLP are in the first place optimization of the lipid spectrum, in particular a drop of total and LDL cholesterol, we cannot overlook so-called \"non-lipid\" effects of hypolipidaemic agents, in particular statins. In the treatment of patients with HLP it is important in the first place to evaluate the comprehensive risk of the patient, nevertheless it is possible to define \"target values\" e.g. according to recommendations of \"European societies\". Even these target values may be the subject of further discussions. It may be however stated that the objective is that total cholesterol should be less than 5 mmol/l, LDL cholesterol less than 3 mmol/l and triglycerides less than 2 mmol/l, HDL cholesterol higher than 1 mmol/l. Attention should be however drawn to the fact that evidence is increasing that in particular patients with already manifest IHD will benefit from even more aggressive treatment and attempts to achieve minimal lipid and lipoprotein values. LDL cholesterol should be reduced to 2.5 mmol/l and triglycerides should be below 2 mmol/l. It is a problem how to achieve these values. The strongest evidence is in favour of statin administration. On the other hand it is important to mention that optimation of the lipid and lipoprotein spectrum may be more important than prescription of a drug from a certain group.", 
    "119": "Eccentric atherogenic plaques which cause only insignificant narrowing of the diameter of coronary arteries are the cause of 60-80% of all acute coronary syndromes. The plaque becomes unstable (vulnerable) due to cytokines released by macrophages in the lipid rich core. Weakening of the fibrous capsule of the core then leads to rupture of the plaque and subsequently to intracoronary thrombosis with a wide spectrum of ischaemia or even necrosis of the myocardium. Secondary preventive studies (4S, LIPID, CARE), morphological non-mortality studies (e.g. AVERT, REGRESS, LCAS) and primary preventive studies (WOSCOPS, AFCAPS/TexCAPS) revealed that statins reduce significantly, as compared with placebo, total and LDL-cholesterol by 20-35% and lead in subsequent years to a significant decline of the relative risk of the general and coronary mortality and morbidiy by 20-40%. They prevent progression and may lead to regression of coronary sclerosis. They do not act by mere reduction of the cholesterol level but also by their extralipid effects which stabilize the plaque. 80% of patients with coronary syndrome have cholesterol levels between 6.0 and 7.5 mmol/l, similarly as ca 40% of healthy middle aged persons. The difference is in the risk caused either by the presence of ischaemic heart disease or in healthy subjects by the cumulation of several coronary risk factors. A special risk group are the remaining 20% patients. They include subjects with a cholesterol level above 8 mmol/l who must be treated more aggressively, similarly as patients after a venous aortocoronary bypass. Subjects with slightly elevated LDL-cholesterol values but high triacylglycerol levels and lower HDL-cholesterol levels have also an atherogenic risk. This applies not only to postmenopausal women, elderly people, obese and diabetic subjects, hypertensive subjects with insulin resistance but also to young subjects. In the latter reduction of triacylglycerols is indicated. In coronary patients a combination of statins and fibrates may be used. Basic hypolipidaemic treatment for reduction of the atherothrombotic risk are statins. Despite statin treatment the prospective mortality and morbidity of coronary patients is still high and it is necessary to make an effort to achieve target lipid levels. Recent studies provide new findings, further progress and stricter therapy are foreseen.", 
    "120": "The causes of chronic heart failure at the end of the 20th century are quite different from those 30 or 50 years ago. The last data from the Framingham study indicate that ischaemic heart disease and/or hypertension are the main cause in as many as 90% patients. The prevalence of chronic heart failure in European countries, 0.4-2%, implies 40-200,000 patients in the Czech Republic. Pharmacological treatment during the last 15 years revealed clearly that the drugs of choice which prolong life are inhibitors of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE-I) which are combined with other drugs as needed by the patient. A combination of five drug groups (ACE-I, digitalis, diuretics, beta-blockers, and spironolactone) are nowadays the basic treatment. In the 4S study (Scandinavian Simvastatin Survival Study--4,444 patients with ischaemic heart disease followed up for 5.4 years) 412 (9.2%) developed chronic heart failure requiring treatment, i.e. 228 (10.3%) in the placebo group and 184 (8.3%) patients in the group treated with simvastatin (p < 0.015). In the group of patients with signs of heart failure 73 of 228 died the placebo group and 47 of 184 in the simvastatin group (reduction of the relative risk by 19%, p = 0.014), to save one life (NNT) it was necessary to treat 15 patients for a period of 5 years. From the aspect of the number of patients it was necessary to treat six times as many patients without heart failure than with heart failure to save one life in five years. Hypolipidaemic treatment should be an obvious part of treatment of heart failure due to ischaemic heart disease. Hyperlipoproteinaemia is described in 60-80% patients after transplantation of the heart. Treatment involves diet, reduction or discontinuation of corticoids, maintenance of cyclosporin at the lowest effective level and treatment wit statins.", 
    "121": "To date, there are no evidence-based data to support specific drug therapy for a patient with atheroembolism. It makes sense to use HMG CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A) reductase inhibitors (statins) in any patient with atherosclerosis, as these drugs have been shown to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke, and have a theoretical benefit on plaque stabilization. Surgical treatment should be considered for patients with abdominal aortic or popliteal artery aneurysms and downstream atheroembolism. There are case reports of atheroemboli in patients worsening after given warfarin or heparin. For this reason, some institutions are reluctant to prescribe these drugs for patients with atheroemboli or thromboemboli from aortic plaque. However, the incidence of this complication is quite low. Anticoagulation probably should be stopped if a patient develops atheroembolism. Similarly, the current state of knowledge does not allow for selecting specific pharmacologic intervention in patients with thromboemboli from aortic plaque. Statin therapy does make sense, as these drugs theoretically stabilize plaques and prevent plaque hemorrhage, thrombosis, and subsequent embolization. Unstable aortic plaques may develop superimposed thrombi (red thrombi on pathologic examination), easily seen as mobile elements on transesophageal echocardiography. Therefore, it is possible that anticoagulation with warfarin might prevent embolic events in these patients. For this reason, we are often in the position of recommending warfarin therapy for patients with emboli and severe atheromas seen on transesophageal echocardiography, especially when superimposed mobile thrombi are seen. There are small series in the literature that indicate the potential benefit of warfarin. However, until a large multicenter randomized clinical trial is done, the use of warfarin can not be definitively recommended. Antiplatelet agents, although safer than warfarin (less risk of hemorrhage), have not been proven beneficial in patients with thromboembolism from the aorta. Surgery (endarterectomy) of the aortic arch is a very risky procedure that should not be performed routinely, but may be used in highly selected patients."
