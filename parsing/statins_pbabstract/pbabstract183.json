    "1": "The 2-kidney, 1-clip hypertensive rats were prepared with SD rats. Twenty-one rats were randomly selected seven rats as the control group (n=7), the remaining rats were randomly divided into hypertension group (n=7) and the statins group (n=7) after the establishment of model. Statins group was treated with atorvastatin calcium 30 mg/kg/d four weeks after model construction and then given through lavage for 8 consecutive weeks. All rats were evaluated for caudal systolic blood pressure (SBP) and blood lipid, microscopic changes in vascular structure and ratio of intima media thickness to lumen diameter (MT/LD) of thoracic aorta. Expressions of OPN were assessed with immunohistochemical staining, and expressions of OPN mRNA with fluorescence quantitative PCR.", 
    "2": "Compared with control group, hypertension group showed significant increase in SBP, MT/LD, and the expression of OPN and OPN mRNA, and significant decrease in HDL level. As compared with hypertension group, MT/LD and the expression of OPN and OPN mRNA of statins group were significantly decreased, while its HDL level significantly increased.", 
    "3": "Hypertension can lead to high expression of artery OPN, atorvastatin calcium was shown to improve the development of vascular remodeling in rats, possibly associated with decreased expression of OPN.", 
    "4": "To evaluate the potential drug-drug interaction between raltegravir and pravastatin.", 
    "5": "This was an open-label, randomized, 3-period, cross-over, single-centre trial in 24 healthy volunteers. Subjects received the following treatments: pravastatin 40 mg every day for 4 days, raltegravir 400 mg twice a day for 4 days, and pravastatin 40 mg every day + raltegravir 400 mg twice a day for 4 days. The treatments were separated by washout periods of 10 days. On day 4 of each treatment period, blood samples for pharmacokinetics were collected throughout a 24-hour period.", 
    "6": "Geometric mean ratios (90% confidence interval) for pravastatin + raltegravir versus pravastatin alone were 0.96 (0.83 to 1.11) for AUC0-24 and 1.04 (0.85 to 1.26) for Cmax. The mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol decrease after 4 days of pravastatin was 0.42 mmol/L both in the presence and the absence of raltegravir. The geometric mean ratio (90% confidence interval) AUC0-12, Cmax, and C12 for raltegravir + pravastatin versus raltegravir alone were 1.13 (0.77 to 1.65), 1.31 (0.81 to 2.13), and 0.59 (0.39 to 0.88), respectively.", 
    "7": "Raltegravir did not influence the pharmacokinetics or the short-term lipid-lowering effects of pravastatin, whereas pravastatin increased the Cmax but decreased the C12 of raltegravir. The effects of pravastatin on raltegravir pharmacokinetics are not likely to be clinically relevant.", 
    "8": "Osteocalcin has been reported to influence insulin secretion in experimental animals. We investigated whether serum osteocalcin was associated with measures of insulin resistance, circulating adipokine levels, and the presence of metabolic syndrome (MetSyn).", 
    "9": "Serum osteocalcin was measured by solid-phase sandwich immunoassay in 1284 blacks (64+/-9 years; 71% women) and 1209 non-Hispanic whites (59+/-10 years; 57% women) belonging to hypertensive sibships. MetSyn was defined per Adult Treatment Panel III criteria. The prevalence of MetSyn was 50% in blacks and 49% in non-Hispanic whites. In each ethnic group, after adjustment for age and gender, osteocalcin levels were inversely correlated with body mass index, fasting glucose and insulin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, triglycerides, and leptin, and positively correlated with adiponectin (P<0.001 for each variable). In multivariable regression analyses that adjusted for age, gender, smoking, serum creatinine, and statin and estrogen use, osteocalcin levels in the highest quartile (compared with the lowest quartile) were associated with a lower odds ratio (OR) of having MetSyn: OR (95% CI) in blacks, 0.33 (0.23 to 0.46); OR in non-Hispanic whites, 0.43 (0.31 to 0.63).",

    "11": "To assess the effect of intensive statins therapy on the outcome of small-diameter vascular prosthesis, we investigated whether atorvastatin treatment (30 mg/d) could accelerate the re-endothelialization process and improve the patency rate in a canine infrarenal abdominal aorta-expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) bypass model. Furthermore, we also evaluated the effect of atorvastatin on the migratory and adherent capacity of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in vitro. Improved patency was confirmed by Doppler sonography and arteriography. Histological and scanning electron microscopy illustrated enhanced re-endothelialization process. Treatment with atorvastatin enhanced the circulating pool of EPCs with fortified migratory and adherent capacity. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed that atorvastatin treatment increased endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and kinase insert domain receptor (KDR) messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in cultured EPCs and neointima. In conclusion, intensive statin therapy could be considered a favorable option to improve small-diameter vascular graft patency.", 
    "12": "Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is associated with increased morbidity, extended hospital stay, and higher costs. We compared an atorvastatin plus N-acetylcysteine (NAC) regimen with NAC alone in patients undergoing coronary angiography. A total of 130 patients (mean age 54 +/- 10; 77 men) undergoing coronary angiography were studied. Seven CIN cases occurred in the NAC group and 2 in the atorvastatin + NAC group; this difference was not significant. Baseline mean creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) were similar between the 2 groups, whereas after the procedure there was a significant creatinine decrease and eGFR increase in the atorvastatin + NAC group. Change in creatinine (baseline creatinine-creatinine after the procedure) was also significantly higher in patients taking statin plus NAC. Atorvastatin may be effective in protecting patients undergoing coronary angiography from CIN.",

    "15": "This study was comprised of 164 patients with CHD and a control population of 122 healthy subjects. The patients with CHD were divided into 2 groups and treated with either simvastatin 20 mg/day or atorvastatin 10 mg/day. The markers of oxidative stress were measured before and after 12 weeks of treatment.", 
    "16": "The effects of atorvastatin on reducing oxidative stress were significantly greater compared with those of simvastatin (P < 0.05). The changes in the markers of oxidative stress did not correlate with the changes in the plasma lipid profile (P > 0.05).", 
    "17": "This study suggests that atorvastatin reduces oxidative stress more effectively than simvastatin.", 
    "18": "Evidence for the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis is compelling and has generated interest in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) as a marker of cardiovascular risk. Data regarding hs-CRP and cardiovascular risk, though largely consistent, is of unclear clinical relevance. Most recently, the Justification for the Use of Statins in Primary Prevention: An Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) trial has led to further debate regarding the utility of hs-CRP. This article provides a comprehensive review of the data regarding cardiovascular risk and hs-CRP with an emphasis on the JUPITER trial and concludes with an evidence-based analysis of the current role of hs-CRP in cardiovascular risk assessment.", 
    "19": "We undertook a study investigating whether immigrants from Turkey, Pakistan and Yugoslavia received adequate medical treatment with beta-blockers and statins after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) when compared with Danish-born residents and explored whether associations between patient origin and medical treatment were mediated by socioeconomic status (SES).", 
    "20": "This register-based follow-up study consisted of individuals >17 years of age, admitted to hospital with AMI between 2001 and 2005 (n=25,443). Danish-born residents were compared with immigrants from Turkey, Pakistan and Yugoslavia. Individuals were identified by civil registration number, and data were obtained through linkage to the national registers of hospitalisations and drug prescriptions. Odds of initiating treatment and hazard ratios (HR) of terminating treatment were estimated. Mediators such as income and employment were included in the models.", 
    "21": "Pakistanis were less likely than Danish-born residents to initiate treatment with beta-blockers after AMI [odds ratio 0.52; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34-0.80]. Immigrants from Turkey (HR 1.36; 95% CI 1.07-1.73) and Pakistan (HR 1.59; 95% CI 1.21-2.08) were more likely to terminate treatment with beta-blockers before being recommended to do so. Estimates did not change markedly when income and education were included in the models.", 
    "22": "The results of this study suggest that immigrants from Pakistan and Turkey do not receive adequate medical treatment with beta-blockers after a first AMI compared with Danish-born residents. Mediators such as income and employment may not be sufficient indicators of SES when the effect of patient origin on medical treatment is explored. A lower SES of immigrants, communication problems between doctor and patient and doctors' attitudes towards immigrants may explain ethnic differences in medical treatment after AMI.", 
    "23": "Individuals with type 1 diabetes have a less atherogenic fasting lipid profile than those without diabetes but paradoxically have increased rates of cardiovascular disease (CVD). We investigated differences in lipoprotein subfraction cholesterol distribution and insulin resistance between subjects with and without type 1 diabetes to better understand the etiology of increased CVD risk.", 
    "24": "Fast protein liquid chromatography was used to fractionate lipoprotein cholesterol distribution in a substudy of the Coronary Artery Calcification in Type 1 Diabetes (CACTI) study (n = 82, age 46 +/- 8 years, 52% female, 49% with type 1 diabetes for 23 +/- 8 years). Insulin resistance was assessed by a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp.", 
    "25": "Among men, those with type 1 diabetes had less VLDL and more HDL cholesterol than control subjects (P < 0.05), but among women, those with diabetes had a shift in cholesterol to denser LDL, despite more statin use. Among control subjects, men had more cholesterol distributed as VLDL and LDL but less as HDL than women; however, among those with type 1 diabetes, there was no sex difference. Within sex and diabetes strata, a more atherogenic cholesterol distribution by insulin resistance was seen in men with and without diabetes, but only in women with type 1 diabetes.", 
    "26": "The expected sex-based less atherogenic lipoprotein cholesterol distribution was not seen in women with type 1 diabetes. Moreover, insulin resistance was associated with a more atherogenic lipoprotein cholesterol distribution in all men and in women with type 1 diabetes. This lipoprotein cholesterol distribution may contribute to sex-based differences in CVD in type 1 diabetes.", 
    "27": "To investigate the role of statins in beta-cell regeneration a model of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced beta-cell injury was used in the neonatal rat. We hypothesized that beta-cell growth and regeneration would increase following treatment with atorvastatin and that this would be associated with intraislet vasculogenesis. Pregnant Wistar rats were gavaged with 20 or 40 mg/kg atorvastatin for 21 days commencing on gestation day 15. Atorvastatin was detected in the circulation of the offspring. On postnatal day 4, the pups were given either a control or STZ (70 mg/kg ip) injection. beta-Cell mass had partially recovered by postnatal day 44 following STZ treatment, and atorvastatin (20 mg/kg) significantly increased beta-cell mass in both STZ-treated and control animals. An increase in the numbers of small islets at postnatal day 44 was seen in STZ-treated animals following atorvastatin, suggestive of neogenesis, and glucose tolerance was improved. Treatment with atorvastatin caused an increase in the numbers of intraislet endothelial cells at postnatal day 14 and the percentage of endothelial cells undergoing DNA synthesis, suggesting that angiogenesis had preceded the increase in beta-cell mass. The results indicate that functional beta-cell mass was expanded with atorvastatin in both control and STZ-treated neonatal rats and suggests a novel effect of a statin in promoting islet plasticity.", 
    "28": "A previous study in 4703 patients suggested that a single-pill combination of amlodipine and atorvastatin is associated with greater adherence to therapy than a two-pill calcium channel antagonist (calcium channel blocker [CCB]) and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) regimen. However, the impact of prior medication use on the potential adherence benefits of single-pill amlodipine/atorvastatin has not been studied.",

    "30": "This retrospective study was conducted among managed care enrolees in the US. Patients included in the analysis had to have a pharmacy claim for single-pill amlodipine/atorvastatin or claims for both a CCB and a statin within any 30-day window between April 2004 and April 2005. Adherence was measured over 6 months following the index date (the date of the first single-pill amlodipine/atorvastatin claim or of the claim for the second medication class for any two-pill CCB + statin regimen) as the proportion of days covered (PDC) by both CCB and statin therapy; patients were considered 'adherent' if PDC was > or =80%. Patients were divided into four cohorts based on pre-index CCB and statin use: (i) naive (CCB)/naive (statin); (ii) experienced (CCB)/naive (statin); (iii) naive (CCB)/experienced (statin); and (iv) experienced (CCB)/experienced (statin). Within each cohort, adherence was compared for patients receiving single-pill amlodipine/atorvastatin versus two-pill amlodipine + atorvastatin or other two-pill CCB + statin regimens (including amlodipine or atorvastatin but not both) at index. Multivariable logistic regression with propensity score weighting was used to adjust for covariates, including age, sex and co-morbidities.", 
    "31": "In total, 35,430 patients were included in the analysis. At month 6 (after adjusting for covariates), patients in the experienced (CCB)/naive (statin) cohort receiving single-pill amlodipine/atorvastatin were more than twice as likely to be adherent as those receiving two-pill amlodipine + atorvastatin (odds ratio [OR] 2.20; p < 0.0001) or other two-pill CCB + statin regimens (OR 2.75; p < 0.0001). Similarly, patients in the naive (CCB)/experienced (statin) cohort receiving single-pill amlodipine/atorvastatin were more likely to be adherent than those receiving two-pill amlodipine + atorvastatin (OR 1.72; p < 0.0001) or other two-pill CCB + statin regimens (OR 2.81; p < 0.0001). In contrast, in the naive (CCB)/naive (statin) cohort there was no significant difference in adherence between patients receiving single-pill amlodipine/atorvastatin versus two-pill amlodipine + atorvastatin (OR 1.00), although patients receiving single-pill amlodipine/atorvastatin were slightly more likely to be adherent than those receiving other two-pill CCB + statin regimens (OR 1.29; p < 0.01). In the experienced (CCB)/experienced (statin) cohort there was also no significant difference between patients receiving single-pill amlodipine/atorvastatin versus two-pill amlodipine + atorvastatin (OR 1.08), and only a slightly greater likelihood of achieving adherence to single-pill amlodipine/atorvastatin versus other two-pill CCB + statin regimens (OR 1.19; p < 0.01).", 
    "32": "This large retrospective study confirms previous observations that single-pill amlodipine/atorvastatin can help improve adherence versus two-pill CCB + statin regimens. However, greater improvements in adherence are likely to be observed in patients with prior experience of either CCB or statin therapy than in those either naive to, or experienced with, both therapies.", 
    "33": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors(statins) are widely used to treat dyslipidemia, and now play an important role in the management of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Besides their lipid lowering effect, statins display 'pleiotropic effects' that include improvement of nitric oxide bioavailability, inhibition of inflammatory cytokine expression and inhibition of blood coagulability, which may ameliorate the pathogenesis of ACS as shown in animal models and human studies. In clinical trials, statins are proven to reduce the risk of ACS in primary as well as secondary prevention, in which LDL cholesterol lowering correlates with the risk reduction for ACS. Recent trials suggested that the immediate initiation of statins benefit the ACS patients reducing recurrent ischemic events and improve prognosis. These evidences suggest that more aggressive statin treatment may benefit both low- and high-risk patients in the management of ACS.", 
    "34": "The number of patients with limited organ function is steadily increasing due to the aging of the population. Consequently, a growing number of patients needing surgery is accompanied by serious comorbidities. These patients are at high risk of perioperative organ dysfunction. In this context cardiac events (e.g. cardiac arrhythmias, angina or myocardial infarction) play a major role with significant impact on postoperative care, long term outcome and economic sequelae. Thus, anaesthesiologists must prevent such events in the perioperative period. Besides general measures such as adequate analgesia, protection from stressful events and sufficient volume replacement, medical intervention with beta-blockers or HMG-CoA-reductase-inhibitors (statins) are necessary to reduce the incidence of perioperative cardiac events. Both beta-blockers and HMG-CoA-reductase-inhibitors are known to exhibit pleiotropic effects (defined as additional cardioprotective effects) besides the primary blockade of the beta-adrenergic receptor or the inhibition of the synthesis of serum cholesterol, respectively. Both groups of drugs improve cardiac function, decrease inflammatory response, decrease activation of blood coagulation and stabilize endothelial plaques. Based on the current literature the following recommendations are published concerning the perioperative administration of beta-blockers: (i) Patients who are on beta-blockers on a regular basis following guidelines concerning chronic treatment of cardiovascular diseases should continue this medication throughout the perioperative period; (ii) a sufficient indicator of an adequate therapy is the baseline heart rate. It should not exceed 60-70bpm at rest; (iii) the Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI) is a widely accepted score to estimate the patient's perioperative cardiac risk; (iv) patients with a RCRI > or =3 should not be scheduled for routine surgery without sufficient beta-adrenergic-receptor blockade; (v) in patients at high cardiac risk based on the RCRI who are scheduled for emergency surgery beta-blocker-therapy should not be initiated de novo perioperatively. However, for perioperative treatment of tachycardia or hypertension beta-blockers are the drug of first choice. Concerning perioperative statin-therapy the following recommendations are suggested: (i) chronic statin-therapy should be continued throughout surgery and the perioperative period; (ii) in patients without chronic statin-therapy scheduled for vascular surgery this treatment should be started perioperativly; (iii) no data is available concerning other patient populations; (iv) if statin-therapy is indicated it should be started independently from baseline serum LDL-C-concentration; (v) side effects of statin-therapy are rare and usually not live threatening, thus treatment is considered to be without serious risks to the patient.", 
    "35": "Cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) metabolizes \u223c50% of all clinically used drugs. Although CYP3A4 expression varies widely between individuals, the contribution of genetic factors remains uncertain. In this study, we measured allelic CYP3A4 heteronuclear RNA (hnRNA) and mRNA expression in 76 human liver samples heterozygous for at least one of eight marker SNPs and found marked allelic expression imbalance (1.6-6.3-fold) in 10/76 liver samples (13%). This was fully accounted for by an intron 6 SNP (rs35599367, C>T), which also affected mRNA expression in cell culture on minigene transfections. CYP3A4 mRNA level and enzyme activity in livers with CC genotype were 1.7- and 2.5-fold, respectively, greater than in CT and TT carriers. In 235 patients taking stable doses of atorvastatin, simvastatin, or lovastatin for lipid control, carriers of the T allele required significantly lower statin doses (0.2-0.6-fold, P=0.019) than non-T carriers for optimal lipid control. These results indicate that intron 6 SNP rs35599367 markedly affects expression of CYP3A4 and could serve as a biomarker for predicting response to CYP3A4-metabolized drugs.", 
    "36": "The medications we use for cholesterol and triglyceride lowering are powerful and have substantial outcome data. However, even with aggressive statin therapy, there is residual risk for recurrent cardiovascular events. Strict dietary modification has been shown to reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol by 20% to 30%. Low-fat and Mediterranean-type diets have also been associated with atherosclerosis regression and fewer coronary heart disease events. On the other hand, a high-fat diet can produce postprandial lipemia and an increase in cardiovascular disease risk. Patients with atherogenic dyslipidemia (low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, increased triglycerides and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, small dense low-density lipoprotein particles) and visceral adiposity are particularly prone to postprandial lipemia. These individuals typically have insulin resistance, which is associated with endothelial dysfunction and an increased risk for thrombosis. Lifestyle intervention is the key to reducing postprandial lipemia, specifically weight reduction and increased physical activity. Although medications can improve postprandial lipemia, poor dietary choices can overwhelm the effects of medication and negatively impact the health of arteries, thus promoting atherosclerosis. Therefore, patients who are treated with medications for dyslipidemia must be counseled on consuming a heart-healthy diet.",

    "40": "Prespecified criteria were met by 6 RCTs involving 2,088 patients. During the periprocedural period, 81 of 1,051 patients (7.7%) in the statins pretreatment group developed periprocedural MI, significantly less than 147 of 1,037 (14.2%) patients assigned to the control group (OR 0.51, 95% CI 0.38-0.67; P< 0.001). During 1-month follow-up, only 4 deaths, 7 non-periprocedural Q-wave MIs, and 4 revascularizations occurred in all 2,088 enrolled patients. The composite of death, MI, or target vessel revascularization at 1 month, essentially driven by periprocedural MI, was reported in 8.0% in the statins pretreatment group and 15.3% in the control group (OR 0.48, 95% CI 0.36-0.64; P< 0.001).",

Due to the widespread prescription of these agents, special attention should be given to their rare adverse effects when these may have severe outcomes. Here, we report two cases of localized rhabdomyolysis associated with mononeuropathy in patients taking statins and suggest possible explanations for this uncommon association. Close monitoring for myopathic/neuropathic events is warranted in high-risk patients with pre-existing neuropathies who are taking statins.",

We arranged an experimental design which focuses on the effect of simvastatin on peripheral nerves and neural regeneration. Sciatic nerve injury was performed at midthigh region of male wistar rats either by clamp compression or fine cut. Electrophysiological and electron microscopical studies were carried out to assess the effect of simvastatin on peripheral nerve and nerve regeneration. There was no difference between the groups that were given simvastatin and standard regimen in the sciatic nerve when electrophysiological measurements were concerned. However, some of the rats that were given simvastatin show reduction in axoplasm density (intensity) of myelinated nerve fibers and prominent vacuolization of myelin sheath according to light and electron microscopic studies. Sciatic nerve compound muscle activation potential measurements of the animals given simvastatin showed that this drug doesn't have a delaying effect on the peripheral nerve recovery time. Electrophysiological measurements showed that simvastatin did not influence nerve regeneration however it was found to induce severe vacuolization of myelin sheath of the sciatic nerve. It was apparent that the drug induces some form of structural dysfunction as myelin changes supported by electron microscopical studies.",

    "45": "Despite the use of statin therapy, a significant proportion of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) still develop cardiovascular events. We hypothesized that development of mitochondrial dysfunction (MD) after statin therapy might be linked to endothelial dysfunction and thus limiting its beneficial effects. We studied the effect of MD on endothelial function in 119 patients with CAD on long-term statins (>1 year). Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) was assessed by high-resolution ultrasonography and blood levels of lactate, pyruvate, fasting glucose, and lipids were measured. MD (defined by a lactate/pyruvate ratio >75th percentile of the age- and sex-matched normal controls, i.e., > or = 18) was observed in 43/119(36%) patients. There were no significant differences in age, gender, and clinical characteristics between patients with or without MD (all P > 0.05). Patients with MD received higher dose of statin (23.5 +/- 19.3 vs. 17.1 +/- 10.5 mg simvastatin-equivalent dose, P = 0.05) and had lower FMD (2.69 +/- 2.94 vs. 4.33 +/- 2.80%, P = 0.003) than those without MD. Multivariate analysis showed that statin dosage was independently associated with MD (OR:1.03, P = 0.03), and MD significantly predicted an absolute 1.36% decrease in FMD (P = 0.01). In conclusion, a significant proportion of patients with CAD on statin developed MD, which was associated with high-dose statin and with impaired FMD, suggesting that increased statin dosage may induce MD and contribute to endothelial dysfunction in patients with CAD.",

In the present study, the effects of repeated antigen exposure on the expression of GGTase I were determined in mouse BSMs. Male BALB/c mice were sensitized and repeatedly challenged with ovalbumin antigen. Animals were also treated with lovastatin (4 mg/kg/day, i.p.) once a day prior to and during the antigen inhalation period. Western blot analyses revealed that GGTase I was upregulated in BSMs of the antigen-challenged mice. The systemic treatment with lovastatin attenuated the upregulation of GGTase I induced by antigen exposure. Interestingly, lovastatin also significantly reduced the protein expression of GGTase I in BSMs of control animals. We thus concluded that an upregulation of GGTase I in BSM might be, at least in part, involved in the development of antigen-induced airway hyperresponsiveness. Lovastatin might have therapeutic potential to ameliorate airway hyperresponsiveness in allergic bronchial asthma.",

    "59": "An injectable tissue-engineered bone (ITB) composed of human adipose-derived stromal cells (hADSCs) and platelet-rich plasma (hPRP) was preliminarily constructed, but its osteogenic capability needs improving. This study aimed to evaluate if simvastatin can be applied as a bone anabolic agent for this ITB. We found 0.01 microm, 0.1 microm, and 1 microm simvastatin could induce hADSCs' osteoblastic differentiation in vitro that accompanied with non-inhibition on cell proliferation, high alkaline phosphatase activity, more mineralization deposition and more expression of osteoblast-related genes such as osteocalcin, core binding factor alpha1, bone morphogenetic protein-2, vascular endothelial growth factor, and basic fibroblast growth factor. Simvastatin at 1 mum seemed the most optimal concentration due to its high osteocalcin secretion in media (P < 0.01). Quantitative mineralization assay also showed 1 microm SIM had the most obvious synergistic effect on hPRP's induction for matrix mineralization of hADSCs (P < 0.01). When 1 microm Simvastatin was applied to this ITB to restore the critical-sized calvarial defects in mice, more bone formation was observed in defected regions, and the peripheries just outside the defect margins by X-ray analysis, and H&E staining. These findings indicate that simvastatin at optimal concentrations can be used to promote this ITB's osteogenesis. However, simvastatin's effects on this ITB await long-term investigation.",

Meta-regression analyses were conducted to determine whether statins' effects were duration or dose dependent. A random-effects model was used in all instances.",

Statins reduced postoperative atrial fibrillation risk (relative risk 0.57, 95% confidence interval 0.45-0.72, P < .0001, risk difference -0.14, 95% confidence interval -0.20 to -0.08, P < .0001, number needed to treat 8) and total hospital stay (weighted mean difference -0.66 days, 95% confidence interval -1.01 to -0.30 days, P = .0004) relative to placebo. Intensive care unit stay was also reduced (weighted mean difference -0.17 days, 95% confidence interval -0.37 to 0.03 days, P = .09) but did not meet prespecified criteria for statistical significance. Metaregression analysis revealed association between duration of preoperative statin prophylaxis and postoperative atrial fibrillation risk reduction (3% reduction per day, P = .008). No association was found between statin dose used and risk reduction (P = .47).",

    "64": "Retrospective studies suggest that statins might exert an antiarrhythmic effect on the heart. The mechanism of this effect is unclear. Parasympathetic stimulation of the heart has been shown to protect against ventricular arrhythmias. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of statins on ventricular arrhythmias and its correlation with changes in parasympathetic responsiveness and Galpha(i2) expression. Patients were randomized to pravastatin and simvastatin in a double-blind crossover design. Ventricular arrhythmias were determined by analysis of 24-hour Holter recordings. Spectral RR interval analysis of Holter studies determined peak high-frequency power fraction, which reflects parasympathetic modulation of heart rate. Expression of Galpha(i2), a molecular component of the parasympathetic response pathway, was determined by Western blots of patients' lymphocytes. Pravastatin treatment decreased the incidence of ventricular premature complexes by 22.5 + or - 3.4% (n = 20, p <0.05), couplets, and runs of 3 to 6 beats of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia from 9.8 + or - 2.67 to 3.9 + or - 1.25 events/patient/24 hours (n = 12, p <0.05). Pravastatin increased peak high-frequency fraction by 29.8 + or - 4.3% (n = 33, p <0.001), while Galpha(i2) expression increased by 51.3 + or - 22.5% (n = 21, p <0.05). Effects of simvastatin on ventricular premature complexes and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia were not significant. Relative changes in couplets and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia in pravastatin-treated patients correlated negatively with changes in Galpha(i2) and high-frequency fraction (rho = -0.588 and rho = -0.763, respectively, n = 12, p <0.05). In conclusion, these data suggest that pravastatin might decrease cardiac irritability via an increase in parasympathetic responsiveness and that changes in Galpha(i2) expression might serve as a molecular marker for this effect, which might play a role in the molecular mechanism of the antiarrhythmic effect of statins.", 
    "65": "RhoA prenylation may play an important step in the translocation of RhoA in the basal internal anal sphincter (IAS) smooth muscle tone. Statins inhibit downstream posttranslational RhoA prenylation by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibition (HMGCRI). The role of statins in relation to RhoA prenylation in the pathophysiology of the spontaneously tonic smooth muscle has not been investigated. In the present studies, we determined the effect of classical HMGCRI simvastatin on the basal IAS tone and RhoA prenylation and in the levels of RhoA/Rho kinase (ROCK) in the cytosolic vs. membrane fractions of the smooth muscle. Simvastatin produced concentration-dependent decrease in the IAS tone (via direct actions at the smooth muscle cells). The decrease in the IAS tone by simvastatin was associated with the decrease in the prenylation of RhoA, as well as RhoA/ROCK in the membrane fractions of the IAS, in the basal state. The inhibitory effects of the HMGCRI were completely reversible by geranylgeranyltransferase substrate geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. Relaxation of the IAS smooth muscle via HMGCRI simvastatin is mediated via the downstream decrease in the levels of RhoA prenylation and ROCK activity. Studies support the concept that RhoA prenylation leading to RhoA/ROCK translocation followed by activation is important for the basal tone in the IAS. Data suggest that the role of HMG-CoA reductase may go beyond cholesterol biosynthesis, such as the regulation of the smooth muscle tone. The studies have important implications in the pathophysiological mechanisms and in the novel therapeutic approaches for anorectal motility disorders.", 
    "66": "Ablation outcomes were investigated in patients with and without statin pretreatment before cardiac surgery with concomitant surgical ablation for atrial fibrillation (AF). A prospective cohort study was performed containing 149 patients (n=73 statin group vs. n=76 control group) undergoing on-pump cardiac procedures with surgical ablation for paroxysmal or persistent AF. Measured outcomes were freedom from AF in the intensive care unit, discharge and at three and six months follow-up and perioperative markers of inflammation (white blood cell count, C-reactive protein). Independent predictors for freedom from AF were assessed. Groups did not differ with respect to EuroSCORE, New York Heart Association class, left atrial size, anti-arrhythmic drug therapy or aortic cross-clamp time. Statin therapy had no impact on postoperative inflammatory markers. Freedom from AF was more frequent in the statin group at discharge (P=0.07) and after three and six months (P<0.05). Subgroup analysis showed that statin pretreatment was associated with higher rates of freedom from AF for paroxysmal AF at three and six months and for persistent AF after six months (P<0.05). Importantly, statin-pretreatment was independently predictive for freedom from AF at discharge [odds ratio (OR): 3.21; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2-8.55; P=0.02] and at three months (OR: 2.91; 95% CI: 1.14-7.45; P=0.026).

However, the twin global pandemics of obesity and diabetes are promoting an increased prevalence of associated cardiometabolic risk factors. These factors include mixed dyslipidemia, which is prevalent among several important subgroups of the overall population. Cardiovascular risk increases as women reach and extend beyond menopause, partly reflective of dyslipidemia. In addition, women with polycystic ovary syndrome display a cluster of risk factors reminiscent of the metabolic syndrome. Certain ethnic groups are also at increased risk for type 2 diabetes or the metabolic syndrome. Dyslipidemia contributes significantly to overall cardiovascular risk in the elderly, and the frequency of children and adolescents presenting with type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome is increasing worldwide. Physicians should be aware of the possibility of mixed dyslipidemia in patients at elevated cardiometabolic risk. However, while combination therapy may successfully correct the associated dyslipidemia, it remains to be established whether the addition of a second agent improves coronary risk beyond statin monotherapy.",

The SHARP trial (Study of Heart And Renal Protection) will evaluate the effects of lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol with ezetimibe 10 mg and simvastatin 20 mg/day versus placebo in patients with chronic kidney disease. Recently, in a post-marketing analysis of reported adverse events, it was clearly demonstrated that ezetimibe or the combination of ezetimibe and simvastatin does not increase risk of cancer.

In patients with a history of ischaemic stroke, intensive statin treatment substantially reduces the risk for both recurrent ischaemic stroke and for coronary heart disease (CHD) events.

    "83": "Current therapies for diseases of heart muscle (cardiomyopathy) and aorta (aortopathy) include inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system, beta-adrenergic antagonists, and the statin class of cholesterol-lowering agents. These therapies have limited efficacy, as adverse cardiovascular events continue to occur with some frequency in patients taking these drugs. Although cardiomyopathy and aortopathy can coexist in a number of conditions (for example, Marfan's syndrome, acromegaly, pregnancy, and aging), pathogenetic molecular links between the two diseases remain poorly understood. We reasoned that identification of common molecular perturbations in these two tissues could point to therapies for both conditions. Here, we show that deficiency of the transcriptional regulator Kruppel-like factor 15 (Klf15) in mice leads to both heart failure and aortic aneurysm formation through a shared molecular mechanism. Klf15 concentrations are markedly reduced in failing human hearts and in human aortic aneurysm tissues. Mice deficient in Klf15 develop heart failure and aortic aneurysms in a p53-dependent and p300 acetyltransferase-dependent fashion. KLF15 activation inhibits p300-mediated acetylation of p53. Conversely, Klf15 deficiency leads to hyperacetylation of p53 in the heart and aorta, a finding that is recapitulated in human tissues. Finally, Klf15-deficient mice are rescued by p53 deletion or p300 inhibition. These findings highlight a molecular perturbation common to the pathobiology of heart failure and aortic aneurysm formation and suggest that manipulation of KLF15 function may be a productive approach to treat these morbid diseases.",

Patients were divided into 2 groups depending on preoperative therapy with statin drugs. The primary outcome was postoperative AKI based on the RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, End-stage) criteria. Secondary outcomes included requirement for postoperative dialysis and hospital mortality. Multivariable logistic regression models were developed for the primary and secondary outcomes. To control for selection bias related to statin therapy, a propensity score was developed using a greedy matching technique.",

Hospital mortality after surgery occurred in 1.71% (n = 182) of patients. The incidence of mortality for patients in the statin group was 1.71% (105 of 6157 patients) and this was not different from mortality in the no statin group of 1.71% (77 of 4491 patients) (P = 0.97).

    "88": "It is becoming increasingly clear that cholesterol-independent effects of statins also contribute to the cardioprotective effects, but these mechanisms remain poorly understood. We investigated the effects of lovastatin on vascular smooth muscle phenotype. We have previously shown that mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) inhibition with rapamycin induces vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) differentiation. We found that lovastatin also inhibits mTORC1 signaling and that this inhibition is required for VSMC differentiation. Lovastatin inhibition of mTORC1 was farnesylation dependent, suggesting the farnesylated G protein Rheb (Ras homologue enriched in brain), a known upstream activator of mTORC1. Rheb overexpression induced mTORC1 activity and repressed contractile protein expression, but a farnesylation-deficient mutant (C18S) elicited the opposite effect. Rheb knockdown with small interfering RNA was also sufficient to inhibit mTORC1 and induce contractile protein expression, and it prevented statin-induced VSMC differentiation. Notably, mTORC1 activity was elevated in VSMC isolated from an intimal hyperplastic patient lesion compared with normal media, and lovastatin treatment inhibited mTORC1 activity in these cultures. Furthermore, lovastatin inhibited mTORC1 activity and prevented the downregulation of contractile protein expression in an ex vivo angioplasty model. In conclusion, these findings illustrate a mechanism for the cardioprotective effects of lovastatin through inhibition of Rheb and mTORC1 and promotion of a differentiated VSMC phenotype.",

While most side effects of statins are mild and transient, muscular symptoms are relatively common (5 to 10% of patients), but rarely serious (myositis, rhabdomyolysis). In cases of myopathy, the severity of symptoms and the determination of CK (creatine kinase) determine whether discontinuation of statin is necessary. Alternative strategies are also suggested.

In Switzerland, the Swiss Group Lipids and Atherosclerosis (GSLA) recommends to use the PROCAM score with an adjustment of the level of risk for Switzerland.

The present study demonstrated that 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels increased with rosuvastatin treatment; whereas fluvastatin treatment had no effect on 25-hydroxyvitamin D. This disparity could be related to the potency or the bioavailability of these two statins. Further studies are needed to clarify the relationship between statins and the vitamin D physiology.", 
    "103": "The use of statins for the prevention or treatment of different neurodegenerative diseases has generated considerable interest albeit with some controversy. Mechanisms of statin-induced neuroprotection are not well understood. Recently, we reported that simvastatin stimulated neuronal gene expression and protein levels of the major antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 in vivo and in vitro; suppression of Bcl-2 in SH-SY5Y cells reduced simvastatin neuroprotection; effects were independent of cholesterol and other products of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase pathway. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) can increase Bcl-2 abundance via the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated thymocytes (NFATc), and simvastatin was reported to increase ET-1 gene expression. We tested the hypothesis that simvastatin stimulation of Bcl-2 involves up-regulation of ET-1 and binding of NFATc to Bcl-2 promoter sites in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. Simvastatin increased both intracellular and secreted ET-1 protein levels. Exogenous ET-1 increased Bcl-2 protein abundance, which was inhibited by ET-1 receptor antagonists. Simvastatin increased translocation of NFATc3 to the nucleus while reducing nuclear NFATc1 and having no effect on NFATc4. Endothelin-1 also increased NFATc3 levels in the nucleus, and this increase was inhibited by ET-1 receptor antagonists. Treatment of cells with simvastatin stimulated binding of NFATc3 to the Bcl-2 promoter. We report novel findings showing that up-regulation of Bcl-2 by simvastatin involves ET-1 and the transcription factor NFATc3. Discovering how statins can selectively alter a specific NFATc isoform that leads to an increase in an antiapoptotic protein will provide a new approach to understanding statin-induced neuroprotection and conditions outside the brain in which apoptosis contributes to pathophysiology.", 
    "104": "Recent studies demonstrate that statins decrease ventricular arrhythmias in internal cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) patients. The mechanism is unknown, but evidence links increased inflammatory and oxidative states with increased arrhythmias. We hypothesized that statin use decreases oxidation. Methods. 304 subjects with ICDs were surveyed for ventricular arrhythmia. Blood was analyzed for derivatives of reactive oxygen species (DROMs) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Results. Subjects included 252 (83%) men, 58% on statins, 20% had ventricular arrhythmias. Average age was 63 years and ejection fraction (EF) 20%. ICD implant duration was 29 +/- 27 months. Use of statins correlated with lower ICD events (r = 0.12, P = .02). Subjects on statins had lower hsCRP (5.2 versus 6.3; P = .05) and DROM levels (373 versus 397; P = .03). Other factors, including IL-6 and EF did not differ between statin and nonstatin use, nor did beta-blocker or antiarrhythmic use. Multivariate cross-correlation analysis demonstrated that DROMs, statins, IL-6 and EF were strongly associated with ICD events. Multivariate regression shows DROMs to be the dominant predictor. Conclusion. ICD event rate correlates with DROMs, a measure of lipid peroxides. Use of statins is associated with reduced DROMs and fewer ICD events, suggesting that statins exert their effect through reducing oxidation.",

To minimize emotional desensitization, subjects were asked to refrain from using self-selected tapes and images for at least 2 weeks before the assigned study phase. Endothelial function was assessed by brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and measured as percent diameter change after an overnight fast. After baseline FMD measurements, subjects were randomized to a 30-minute phase of the testing stimulus followed by poststudy FMD; they returned a minimum of 1 week later for the subsequent task.

    "109": "The aim of this study was to explore the molecular mechanisms underlying the protective effect of pravastatin against carboplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in rodents. We exposed rat NRK-52E renal tubular epithelial cells to carboplatin, with or without pravastatin. Pravastatin decreased production of reactive oxygen species, increased expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), cyclooxygenase-2, and 6-keto prostaglandin F1alpha, enhanced nuclear translocation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha), and increased HO-1 promoter and peroxisome proliferator response element (PPRE) activities. We found interaction of PPARalpha with PPRE on the HO-1 promoter in nuclear extracts from pravastatin-treated NRK-52E cells and by chromatin immunoprecipitation. We pretreated mice with pravastatin and then administered a single intraperitoneal injection of carboplatin. Effects on renal function, morphology, apoptosis, and survival were assessed. In response to carboplatin injection, mice developed acute renal failure, with elevated activated caspase-3, increased apoptotic bodies, and decreased survival. Pretreatment with pravastatin significantly ameliorated renal dysfunction and apoptosis and improved renal morphology and survival. Injection of pravastatin also induced overexpression of PPARalpha and HO-1 in wild-type mice, and HO-1 expression was significantly attenuated in PPARalpha-knockout mice. These results indicate that pravastatin up-regulates HO-1 and protects against carboplatin-induced renal dysfunction and apoptosis via a PPARalpha-dependent pathway.",

We determined whether application of statins after a detrimental insult protected endothelial cells. Bovine pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (BPAEC) were subjected to a 5-h oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and a 1-h simulated reperfusion. Simvastatin or atorvastatin alone or plus mevalonate (the immediate product of the reaction mediated by HMG-CoA reductase), geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP, a product downstream of mevalonate), Ly294002 (a protein kinase B/Akt inhibitor), U0126 [an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway inhibitor] or diphenyleneiodonium [a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase inhibitor] were added to cells immediately after the OGD for 1h. Simvastatin and atorvastatin dose-dependently reduced the OGD and simulated reperfusion-induced lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release from primary BPAEC and BPAEC between passage 4 and 15. This effect was inhibited by mevalonate, GGPP and Ly294002 and was not affected by U0126. Consistent with those results, simvastatin and atorvastatin increased the expression of phospho-Akt/activated Akt, and did not change the expression of phospho-ERK/activated ERK after the OGD and simulated reperfusion. The OGD and simulated reperfusion-induced LDH release and superoxide production, as measured by the dihydroethidium fluorescent intensity, were inhibited by diphenyleneiodonium. These results suggest that statin post-treatment reduces OGD and simulated reperfusion-induced cell injury. This effect may be mediated by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase and the subsequent inhibition of small GTPases. GTPase activation depends on GGPP generation and contributes to the formation of NADPH oxidase complex that produces superoxide. The statin post-treatment-induced protection may also involve activated Akt.",

Based on this assessment, target LDL-cholesterol levels have been set as <100 mg/dL, <130 mg/dL, and <160 mg/dL for high-, intermediate-, and low-risk individuals, respectively. The most important rationale for this approach is to implement a cost-effective treatment strategy, giving special attention to high-risk individuals when allocating available sources. Recent data suggest that increased levels of high sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) are associated with increased risk for cardiovascular events, independent of other risk parameters. Most recently, the JUPITER trial demonstrated that rosuvastatin 20 mg/day significantly lowered cardiovascular mortality and all-cause mortality in low- or intermediate-risk patients whose LDL-cholesterol levels were <130 mg/dL (median 108 mg/dL) and hs-CRP levels were =/>2 mg/L.

Fluvastatin modulates alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone induced melanogenesis by increasing tyrosinase mRNA production, as shown by real time PCR, or tyrosinase protein synthesis, as presented by western blot technique. The stimulatory effect of fluvastatin on melanogenesis was, in part, induced by modulation of cell proliferation (decreased melanoma cell proliferation in G2/M phase) and possibly decrease of Akt. These findings indicate that fluvastatin increases tyrosinase synthesis induced by alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone in B16F10 cells and reveal an unknown effect of statin use: their influence on melanin production.", 
    "159": "Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were established as in vitro models for the modulation of endothelial function and cell viability by statins. Emphasis was placed on the biphasic effects of the drugs on nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability and cytotoxicity, as well as drug interference with the interaction of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) with caveolin-1 (Cav-1). Incubation of HUVECs with fluvastatin, lovastatin or cerivastatin for 24 h caused an approximately 3-fold upregulation of eNOS expression that was associated with increased eNOS activity and accumulation of cGMP. Cerivastatin exhibited the highest potency with an EC50 of 13.8 +/- 2 nM after 24 h, while having no effect after only 30 min. The effects of statins on eNOS expression were similar in control and Cav-1 knockdown cells, but the increase in eNOS activity was less pronounced in Cav-1-deficient cells. Statin-triggered cytotoxicity occurred at approximately 10-fold higher drug concentrations (maximal toxicity at 1-10 microM), was sensitive to mevalonate, and was significantly enhanced in the presence of NG-nitro-L-arginine. The overexpression of eNOS induced by clinically relevant concentrations of statins may contribute to the beneficial vascular effects of the drugs in patients. Stimulation of NO synthesis and cytotoxicity appear to share a common initial mechanism but involve distinct downstream signaling cascades that exhibit differential sensitivity to HMG-CoA reductase inhibition.",

    "161": "Platelet-vessel wall interaction and thrombosis take place under dynamic conditions involving the interaction of the exposed damaged vascular wall with the circulating blood cells and proteins. Blood was perfused over type I collagen at different wall shear rates, and platelet deposition was measured by confocal microscopy. Perfused effluent blood was collected, platelets were sequentially extracted based on differential protein solubility, and proteins were separated by 2D gel electrophoresis. Blockade of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase significantly reduced platelet deposition and modulated the expression pattern of 18 proteins in the platelet subproteome. Among them, an increase in platelet surface 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78), a stress-inducible multifunctional endoplasmic reticulum protein, was clearly apparent. Immunoprecipitation of platelet GRP78 revealed its interaction with tissue factor. Moreover, blockade of surface GRP78 resulted in a substantial increase in platelet deposition and tissue factor procoagulant activity and in a decrease in clotting time.", 
    "162": "These findings demonstrate that blockade of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase reduces platelet deposition and inhibits GRP78 translocation from the platelet surface after shear and collagen activation. For the first time to our knowledge, this study reports on the presence and functional role of GRP78 in platelets and indicates that GRP78 has additional functions beyond those of a molecular chaperone.", 
    "163": "Statin inhibitors, used to control hypercholesterolemia, trigger apoptosis of hematologic tumor cells and therefore have immediate potential as anticancer agents. Evaluations of statins in acute myelogenous leukemia and multiple myeloma have shown that statin efficacy is mixed, with only a subset of tumor cells being highly responsive. Our goal was to distinguish molecular features of statin-sensitive and -insensitive myeloma cells and gain insight into potential predictive markers. We show that dysregulation of the mevalonate pathway is a key determinant of sensitivity to statin-induced apoptosis in multiple myeloma. In sensitive cells, the classic feedback response to statin exposure is lost. This results in deficient up-regulation of 2 isoforms of hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase: the rate-limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway and hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A synthase 1. To ascertain the clinical utility of these findings, we demonstrate that a subset of primary myeloma cells is sensitive to statins and that monitoring dysregulation of the mevalonate pathway may distinguish these cancers. We also show statins are highly effective and well tolerated in an orthotopic model of myeloma using cells harboring this dysregulation. This determinant of sensitivity further provides molecular rationale for the significant therapeutic index of statins on these tumor cells.", 
    "164": "The beneficial role of statins in primary and secondary prevention of coronary heart disease has resulted in their frequent use in clinical practice. However, safety concerns, especially regarding hepatotoxicity, have driven multiple trials, which have demonstrated the low incidence of statin-related hepatic adverse effects. The most commonly reported hepatic adverse effect is the phenomenon known as transaminitis, in which liver enzyme levels are elevated in the absence of proven hepatotoxicity. This class effect is usually asymptomatic, reversible, and dose-related. However, the increasing incidence of chronic liver diseases, including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and hepatitis C, has created a new challenge when initiating statin treatment in patients with high cardiovascular risk. These diseases result in abnormally high liver biochemistry values, discouraging statin use by clinicians, fostering treatment discontinuation, and leaving a large number of at-risk patients untreated. A PubMed/MEDLINE search of the literature regarding statin safety (January 1, 1994-December 31, 2008) was performed, using the following search terms: statin safety, statin-related hepatotoxicity, and chronic liver disease and statin use, as well as the specific names of different statins and different liver diseases. Relevant clinical trials, review articles, panel discussions, and guideline recommendations were selected. This review supports the use of statin treatment in patients with high cardiovascular risk whose elevated aminotransferase levels have no clinical relevance or are attributable to known stable chronic liver conditions. For each patient, the decision should be based on an individual assessment of risks and benefits.", 
    "165": "Airway mucus overproduction is a cardinal feature of airway inflammatory diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and cystic fibrosis. Since the small G-protein Ras is known to modulate cellular functions in the lung, we sought to investigate whether the Ras inhibitor simvastatin could attenuate acrolein-induced mucin production in rat airways. Rats were exposed to acrolein for 12 days, after first being pretreated intragastrically for 24 h with either simvastatin alone or simvastatin in combination with mevalonate, which prevents the isoprenylation needed for Ras activation. Lung tissue was analyzed for extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity, goblet cell metaplasia and mucin production. To analyze the effect of simvastatin on mucin production in more detail, acrolein-exposed human airway epithelial NCI-H292 cells were pretreated with simvastatin alone or together with mevalonate. Culture medium was collected to detect mucin secretion, and cell lysates were examined for Ras-GTPase activity and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/ERK phosphorylation. In vivo, simvastatin treatment dose-dependently suppressed acrolein-induced goblet cell hyperplasia and metaplasia in bronchial epithelium and inhibited ERK phosphorylation in rat lung homogenates. Moreover, simvastatin inhibited Muc5AC mucin synthesis at both the mRNA and protein levels in the lung. In vitro, simvastatin pretreatment attenuated the acrolein-induced significant increase in MUC5AC mucin expression, Ras-GTPase activity and EGFR/ERK phosphorylation. These inhibitory effects of simvastatin were neutralized by mevalonate administration both in vitro and in vivo. Our results suggest that simvastatin may attenuate acrolein-induced mucin protein synthesis in the airway and airway inflammation, possibly by blocking ERK activation mediated by Ras protein isoprenylation. Thus, the evidence from the experiment suggests that human trials are warranted to determine the potential safety and efficacy of simvastatin for treatment of over production of airway mucus.", 
    "166": "Our group previously reported that tumour-specific expression of the rate-limiting enzyme in the mevalonate pathway, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutharyl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoAR) is associated with more favourable tumour parameters and a good prognosis in breast cancer. In the present study, the prognostic value of HMG-CoAR expression was examined in tumours from a cohort of patients with primary epithelial ovarian cancer.", 
    "167": "HMG-CoAR expression was assessed using immunohistochemistry (IHC) on tissue microarrays (TMA) consisting of 76 ovarian cancer cases, analysed using automated algorithms to develop a quantitative scoring model. Kaplan Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazards modelling were used to estimate the risk of recurrence free survival (RFS).", 
    "168": "Seventy-two tumours were suitable for analysis. Cytoplasmic HMG-CoAR expression was present in 65% (n = 46) of tumours. No relationship was seen between HMG-CoAR and age, histological subtype, grade, disease stage, estrogen receptor or Ki-67 status. Patients with tumours expressing HMG-CoAR had a significantly prolonged RFS (p = 0.012). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that HMG-CoAR expression was an independent predictor of improved RFS (RR = 0.49, 95% CI (0.25-0.93); p = 0.03) when adjusted for established prognostic factors such as residual disease, tumour stage and grade.", 
    "169": "HMG-CoAR expression is an independent predictor of prolonged RFS in primary ovarian cancer. As HMG-CoAR inhibitors, also known as statins, have demonstrated anti-neoplastic effects in vitro, further studies are required to evaluate HMG-CoAR expression as a surrogate marker of response to statin treatment, especially in conjunction with current chemotherapeutic regimens.",

We evaluated the predictors of statin use following kidney transplantation and examined its association with patient and allograft survival.", 
    "171": "We examined 615 consecutive patients who underwent kidney transplant at our institution between January 1998 and January 2002. Statin use was assessed at baseline and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months following kidney transplant. Patients were followed for allograft and patient survival.", 
    "172": "36% of the 615 kidney transplant recipients were treated with statin treatment. Statin use increased over the course of the study period. Older age, elevated body mass index, higher triglyceride levels, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, history of myocardial infarction were associated with higher rates of statin use; elevated alkaline phosphatase levels and CMV IgG seropositivity were associated with less statin use. Older age, elevated BMI and hypercholesterolemia remained significant predictors of increased statin use after accounting for covariates using multiple regression. The early use of statins was not associated with improvements in unadjusted patient survival [HR 0.99; 95%CI 0.72-1.37] or graft survival [HR 0.97; 95% CI 0.76-1.24]. The risks of death and graft survival were not consistently reduced with exposure to statin using either adjusted models or propensity scores in Cox Proportional Hazards models.",

    "174": "The present study has been undertaken to investigate the effect of exendin-4 (a glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist) in diabetes mellitus (DM) and hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy)-induced vascular endothelial dysfunction (VED). Streptozotocin (55 mg kg-1, iv, once) and methionine (1.7% w/w, po, 4 weeks) were administered to rats to produce DM (serum glucose >200 mg d1-1) and HHcy (serum homocysteine >10 microM) respectively. VED was assessed using isolated aortic ring preparation, microscopy of thoracic aorta, and serum nitrite/nitrate concentration. Serum TBARS concentration was estimated to assess oxidative stress. Atorvastatin has been employed as standard agent. Exendin-4 (1 microg kg-1, ip) and atorvastatin (30 mg kg-1, po) treatments significantly attenuated increase in serum glucose and homocysteine but their concentrations remained markedly higher than sham control value. Exendin-4 and atorvastatin treatments markedly prevented DM and HHcy-induced (i) attenuation of acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation, (ii) impairment of vascular endothelial lining, (iii) decrease in serum nitrite/nitrate concentration, and (iv) increase in serum TBARS. However, this ameliorative effect of exendin-4 has been prevented by L-NAME (25 mg kg-1, ip), an inhibitor of NOS. It may be concluded that exendin-4 may activate eNOS due to activation of GLP-1 and consequently reduce oxidative stress to improve vascular endothelial dysfunction.", 
    "175": "Increasing insulin resistance is associated with a shift in cholesterol metabolism to increased synthesis and decreased absorption. Since statins inhibit cholesterol synthesis, we hypothesized that insulin-resistant patients will have greater LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) response to statins than insulin-sensitive patients.", 
    "176": "High-risk vascular patients not on lipid-lowering therapy were recruited and treated with Atorvastatin 80 mg for 6 weeks. Percent LDL-C response to Atorvastatin was related to insulin sensitivity using the quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI). Comparisons: (1) correlation between %LDL-C response and QUICKI. (2) Differences in cholesterol metabolism markers in insulin-resistant (lowest tertile QUICKI) vs insulin-sensitive patients (highest tertile of QUICKI). (3) Correlation of QUICKI with percent LDL-C response after correction for cholesterol metabolism markers.",

QUICKI correlated negatively with percent LDL-C reduction (Pearson's r=-0.258, p=0.037) and on regression analysis explained approximately 7% (R2=0.067) of the variation in percent LDL-C response which approximates that reported by pharmacogenomics. Insulin-resistant patients had higher levels of cholesterol synthesis markers (desmosterol, lathosterol) and lower levels of absorption markers (cholestanol, sitosterol) and the correlation between QUICKI and percent LDL-C response ceased to be significant when these factors were controlled for.",

    "179": "Patients with features of the metabolic syndrome, e.g. high triglycerides (TG) and low high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) may have an enhanced benefit from statin therapy. A retrospective analysis from the 4S investigators where the study population was stratified by HDL-C and TG quartiles revealed variations in statin efficacy. Patients who fell into both the lowest quartile of HDL-C (<39 mg/dl) and highest quartile of TG (>159 mg/dl) had a greater frequency of features of the metabolic syndrome (high BMI, hypertension, diabetes) than the patients in the highest quartile of HDL-C (>52 mg/dl) and lowest quartile of TG (<98 mg/dl). The 4S investigators suggested that patients with low HDL-C and high TG achieved an enhanced clinical benefit from statins compared to patients with high HDL-C and low TG with hazard ratios of 0.48 and 0.86 respectively and a treatment-by-subgroup interaction p value of 0.03 [1]. Since the clinical benefit of statin therapy is directly proportional to achieved percent reduction in low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) [2], we hypothesized that insulin-resistant patients would have greater percent decreases in LDL-C with statin therapy.", 
    "180": "Inflammatory reactology has become increasingly important in diabetic kidney disease. In this study, we estabilished STZ-induced diabetic rat model to investigate whether dendritic cells (DCs) mediated tubulointerstitial damages, and whether the effects by DCs were mediated by P-selectin expression and can be inhibited by atorvastatin. The study demonstrated that there was an accumulation of DCs in diabetic rats mediated by P-selectin. It also showed the accumulation of DCs and expression of P-selectin was closely correlated with the degree of renal tubulointerstitial injury. These effects were markedly attenuated by atorvastatin. Thus, DCs play a role in tubulointerstitial damages, atorvasttin can prevent renal tubulointerstitium from damage by inhibiting the P-selectin expression and DCs migration.",

The backward selection procedure was used to select the significant risk factors in a model. The best fitting model was selected using the log-likelihood ratio test, Akaike Information and Bayesian Information Criteria.",

Risk factors such as age, smoking status, total cholesterol and high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, qualifying event for the acute coronary syndrome, revascularization, history of stroke or diabetes, angina grade and treatment with pravastatin were significant for development of both first and subsequent MI events. No significant difference was found for the effects of these risk factors between the first and subsequent MI events. The significant risk factors selected in this study were the same as those selected by the parametric conditional frailty model. Estimates of the relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were also similar between these two methods.",

    "185": "Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a hematological malignancy, 95% of which is due to translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 and the resulting bcr-abl fusion protein. Imatinib specifically binds to the bcr-abl and inhibits cancer cells. However, a subpopulation of the CML cells named leukemia stem cells are resistant to the imatinib therapy, leading to the relapse. In this study, we identified a subpopulation of CD34+ cells in K562 were much more resistant to imatinib than the bulk cells. Simvastatin single also had little pro-apoptotic effect on the CD34+ cells. In contrast, combination of simvastatin and imatinib induced a significant cell death in the subpopulation, which is dependent on the induced ROS by simvastatin as the effect was blocked by ROS scavenger N-acetyl-L: -cysteine (NAC). Our data here point out that combination of simvastatin and imatinib could be a therapeutic option for the resistant CML.", 
    "186": "C-reactive protein (CRP) is an independent predictor of risk in ACS patients, and it has been previously shown that percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is associated with an early rise in CRP. To assess the long-term relationship between PCI and CRP, we compared CRP levels at baseline, 30 days, 4 months and 24 months among patients in the Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy-Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 22 trial who were treated with PCI and those who did not receive PCI. At study entry, CRP was significantly higher among patients who had undergone PCI (13.2 vs. 9.5 mg/l, P < 0.001). However, by day 30 CRP was significantly lower among patients who had undergone PCI for management of the index event (1.5 vs. 2.1 mg/l, P < 0.001) and remained lower at 4 months and by end of study (average 2 years after ACS). Using a multivariable model, we observed that PCI was associated with 8.6% lower CRP level at month 4 (P = 0.05) and 14.2% at approximately 2 years (P = 0.0028). These analyses suggest that although PCI may acutely increase inflammation, it may also serve a role in decreasing inflammation associated with atherosclerotic plaques via long-term mechanical stabilization.",

A total of 112 rabbits, which were injected intramuscularly with 20 mg/kg of methylprednisolone acetate were divided into four groups and treated as follows: one group received enoxaparin combined with lovastatin (EL; n = 30), another received enoxaparin alone (EA; n = 28), another received lovastatin alone (LA; n = 28) and the last received no treatment (non-prophylactic; NP, n = 26). Haematological examination for serum lipid levels and prothrombin time was carried out and both femora and humeri were examined histopathologically for the presence of osteonecrosis (ON) before injection and at 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks after the injection. The incidence of ON in the EL group (15%) was significantly lower than that observed in the NP group (68%). The incidence in the EA and LA groups was also significantly lower than that in the NP group (31%, 35%vs. 68%). The fat cell sizes of the bone marrow in both EL (46.49 +/- 1.27 microm) and LA (50.8 +/- 2.31 microm) groups were lower than in the NP group (59.89 +/- 6.33 microm). The prothrombin time was prolonged and plasma lipid levels were reduced in the EL group during the study. Combination treatment with an anti-coagulant agent and a lipid-lowering agent can reduce the incidence of steroid-induced ON in rabbits. Future evaluation in clinical practice is necessary."
