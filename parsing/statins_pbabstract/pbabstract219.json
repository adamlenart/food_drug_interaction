Despite a strong association between increased levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and the incidence of coronary heart disease (CHD) has been well proven, it not yet established whether serum LDL-C levels are related to stroke incidence. The major aim of this paper is to perform a comprehensive up-to-date review of research papers, meta-analyses and randomized controlled clinical trials reporting the effects of statins in primary and secondary stroke prevention strategies. In addition, our work provides an overview on statin chemical structure, mechanism of action and pharmacological properties, investigating also most common adverse effects and relationship between statin therapy and haemorrhagic stroke risk, in order to assess drugs safety. Although studies are heterogeneous, our analysis shows that statins reduce the risk of stroke occurrence in high risk patients and seem also to reduce stroke recurrence. Moreover, the low incidence and reversibility of adverse effects, and the unclear association with hemorrhagic events, support the safe use of these drugs.", 
    "1": "A non-optimal plasma concentration of lipids is among the major modifiable risk factors of atherosclerosis. Therefore, the prevention of cardiovascular disease by means of lipid-lowering therapy with statins and other agents is of great importance for patient groups where a lifestyle change, for example, diet modification, does not lead to adequately reduced lipid levels. The response of low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels to statin therapy is highly variable. This is partly attributed to hereditary variation in genes involved in pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and lipid metabolism. The pharmacogenetics of lipid-lowering therapy have been investigated for more than 40 different genes. The gene for apolipoprotein E (APOE) has been the most frequently studied, particularly regarding the epsilon2/epsilon3/epsilon4 polymorphism. Those with the epsilon4 allele seem to have the poorest and those with the epsilon2 allele the strongest response to statins with regards to LDL-C levels. In addition, the epsilon2 carriers may reach the LDL-C treatment goals more frequently than epsilon4 carriers. Few studies have investigated the interaction of the APOE epsilon2/epsilon3/epsilon4 polymorphism and lipid-lowering therapy in relation to the course of coronary heart disease; the results are contradictory and so far inconclusive. This review summarizes the pharmacogenetic findings related to the influence of APOE gene variation on lipid responses and the prevention of coronary heart disease during lipid-lowering therapy.",

An increase in the serum adiponectin level has been reported after the administration of hydrophilic pravastatin, but not after the administration of lipophilic statins thus far. We investigated whether hydrophilic pravastatin acts distinctly from simvastatin, which has the highest lipophilicity, on the favorable effect on adiponectin in dyslipidemic patients. A total of 27 dyslipidemic patients with mild hypertension were enrolled in this study. The patients were initially treated with simvastatin 10 mg/day for six months or more (mean 7.1 months), and then were switched to pravastatin 20 mg/day. The serum adiponectin, cholesterol fractionated components, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were evaluated after six-month intervals. Switching from simvastatin to pravastatin caused little change in the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (103 mg/dl to 104 mg/dl, p = 0.782) and blood pressure (133/70 mmHg to 132/69 mmHg), while the serum adiponectin level significantly increased (11.9 mug/ml to 13.1 mug/ml, p = 0.009, respectively), and the serum CRP significantly decreased (0.078 mg/dl to 0.062 mg/dl, p = 0.040, respectively). Hydrophilic pravastatin increased the serum adiponectin level and decreased the CRP after switching from lipophilic simvastatin in the absence of any difference in the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level and blood pressure. It remains possible, however, that this difference was due not only to pharmacologic lipophilicity, but also to some other specific characteristics such as the formula of statins, the subject characteristics, race, body size, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, etc.",

Therefore, during the drug discovery process it is important to select drug candidates with reduced potential for DDIs. In the present study, we evaluated the pharmacokinetics of simvastatin (SV), a typical substrate for cytochrome P450 (P450) 3A, and examined the DDI between SV and ketoconazole (KTZ), a P450 3A inhibitor, in monkeys. SV metabolism in monkey liver and intestinal microsomes was almost completely inhibited by addition of anti-P450 3A4 antiserum. A similar effect was seen in human microsomes, and the IC(50) values of KTZ for inhibition of SV metabolism were similar in monkey and human samples. In vivo, there were no significant differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters of SV and SVA after i.v. administration of SV in the presence of KTZ compared with those in controls, probably because of the limited systemic exposure to KTZ. In contrast, the pharmacokinetics of SV and SVA after p.o. administration of SV were significantly influenced by the presence of KTZ, and C(max) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve were approximately 5 to 10 times higher than those after p.o. dosing with SV alone. The increases in systemic SV exposure caused by a concomitant p.o. dose of KTZ in monkeys were similar to those observed in clinical studies, which suggests that monkeys might be a suitable animal model in which to predict DDIs involving P450 3A inhibition.", 
    "13": "Although statins are widely prescribed as cholesterol-lowering drugs, a number of studies suggest that these compounds may have anabolic effects on bone. Our aim was to assess whether simvastatin affects the rate of fracture healing in humans. A prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial was performed. Individuals who had sustained an undisplaced, extra-articular fracture of the distal radial metaphysis were recruited from a trauma clinic. Patients were randomized to receive simvastatin 20 mg once daily or a placebo. Regular clinical and radiological follow-up was undertaken for a 12 week period. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry assessment of bone mineral density was conducted at 2 and 12 weeks postinjury. Biochemical markers of bone turnover were assayed during the study period. Time to fracture union was defined as the time to cortical bridging in four cortices on plain radiographs. In addition, the rate of trabecular union was assessed. Eighty patients were recruited, of which 62 completed the study (31 in each group). Study cohorts were matched for age and gender. For patients receiving simvastatin therapy, the mean time to fracture union was 71.6 days (SD 22.2 days, SEM 3.8 days). This compared to 71.3 days (SD 21.3, SEM 4.1 days) for the control cohort (p = 0.6481). There was no significant difference between bone mineral density or bone biochemical markers between groups (p > 0.05). Despite promising results from in vivo and in vitro animal studies, simvastatin at a treatment dose of 20 mg once daily does not affect the rate of fracture healing in humans.",

Southern hybridization analysis revealed that the gene is present only in one copy in the R. miehei genome. The isolated Rhizomucor gene was expressed in the related fungus, Mucor circinelloides. Transformants harbouring the Rhizomucor hmgR gene in an autoreplicative plasmid proved to be more tolerant to statins (e.g. lovastatin, simvastatin, and fluvastatin), the competitive inhibitors of the HMG-CoA reductase, than the original M. circinelloides strain. At the same time, heterologous expression of the Rhizomucor hmgR did not affect the carotenoid production of M. circinelloides.",

    "16": "To investigate the relationship of micro-albuminuria with C-reactive protein (CRP) and hyperuricemia in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes. All patients with type 2 diabetes, 40 years old and over were recruited consecutively from diabetic clinics at a medical center. Serum lipid, creatinine, uric acid, CRP, HbA(1C) and urinary albumin concentration were measured. A total of 515 patients, aged 60.3 +/- 10.7 years were recruited and the number (rate) of micro- and macro-albuminuria were 109 (21.2%) and 55 (10.7%). The prevalence of micro-albuminuria for the quartiles of CRP levels demonstrated a meaningful trend of increases between groups from 17.4, 21.1, 30.3, and 31.2% (P trend = 0.002). Besides, the median CRP concentrations was significantly higher in the patients with micro- and macro-albuminuria than those with non-albuminuria. Stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that CRP was significantly associated with abnormal albuminuria (OR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.12-1.64, P = 0.002). After excluding those subjects with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotension II receptor blockers or/and statin usage, the observed relationship between serum CRP levels and albuminuria was still persistent (OR = 1.61, 95% CI = 1.24-2.08, P < 0.001). In addition, hyperuricemia were significantly associated with abnormal albuminuria in the patients without diuretics, uricosuric agents or alcohol usage. Both serum CRP levels and hyperuricemia were significantly related to the presence of albuminuria in patients with diabetes. In addition, Chinese type 2 diabetic patients with serum CRP levels in the lower range as other ethnic groups can lead to the development of micro-albuminuria.",

Rates of all-cause mortality and major adverse cardiovascular events were compared between patients who were (n=1745) and were not (n=5788) prescribed statins within 1 month of CABG discharge. Additional analyses evaluated the impact of statin initiation between 1 and 6 months after surgery. Multivariable and propensity score analysis demonstrated that statin use within 1 month of CABG discharge independently reduced the risk of all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 0.82, 95% confidence interval 0.72 to 0.94) compared with no statin use. Similarly, statin use within 1 month of CABG discharge independently reduced the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (adjusted hazard ratio 0.89, 95% confidence interval 0.81 to 0.98). Initiation of statin therapy between 1 and 6 months after CABG discharge was also associated with reductions in major adverse cardiovascular events and mortality; however, outcome rates between early (</=1 month after CABG) and delayed (1 to 6 months after CABG) statin initiation were not significantly different.",

    "20": "This study investigated the effects of atorvastatin on ABCB1 and ABCC1 mRNA expression on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and their relationship with gene polymorphisms and lowering-cholesterol response. One hundred and thirty-six individuals with hypercholesterolemia were selected and treated with atorvastatin (10 mg/day/4 weeks). Blood samples were collected for serum lipids and apolipoproteins measurements and DNA and RNA extraction. ABCB1 (C3435T and G2677T/A) and ABCC1 (G2012T) gene polymorphisms were identified by polymerase chain reaction-restriction (PCR)-RFLP and mRNA expression was measured in peripheral blood mononuclear cells by singleplex real-time PCR. ABCB1 polymorphisms were associated with risk for coronary artery disease (CAD) (p<0.05). After atorvastatin treatment, both ABCB1 and ABCC1 genes showed 50% reduction of the mRNA expression (p<0.05). Reduction of ABCB1 expression was associated with ABCB1 G2677T/A polymorphism (p=0.039). Basal ABCB1 mRNA in the lower quartile (<0.024) was associated with lower reduction rate of serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (33.4+/-12.4%) and apolipoprotein B (apoB) (17.0+/-31.3%) when compared with the higher quartile (>0.085: LDL-c=40.3+/-14.3%; apoB=32.5+/-10.7%; p<0.05). ABCB1 substrates or inhibitors did not affect the baseline expression, while ABCB1 inhibitors reversed the effects of atorvastatin on both ABCB1 and ABCC1 transporters. In conclusion, ABCB1 and ABCC1 mRNA levels in PBMC are modulated by atorvastatin and ABCB1 G2677T/A polymorphism and ABCB1 baseline expression is related to differences in serum LDL cholesterol and apoB in response to atorvastatin.", 
    "21": "Although an association between elevated leucocyte count and mortality in patients with ACS (acute coronary syndromes) has been established, the independence of this association from coronary risk factors and C-reactive protein has been inadequately studied. In the present study, this prospective registry included 4329 patients with ACS treated with PCI (percutaneous coronary intervention): 1059 patients with STEMI [ST-segment elevation MI (myocardial infarction)], 1753 patients with NSTEMI (non-STEMI) and 1517 patients with unstable angina. Blood samples were obtained before angiography for leucocyte count and C-reactive protein measurements. The primary outcome of this analysis was 1-year mortality. At 1 year, 345 patients (8%) had died: 45 patients in the 1st tertile, 93 patients in the 2nd tertile and 207 patients in the 3rd tertile of leucocyte count [Kaplan-Meier estimates of mortality, 3.2%, 6.4% and 14.1% with an OR (odds ratio)=2.42, 95% CI (confidence interval)1.78-3.12; P<0.001 for tertile 3 compared with tertile 2 and an OR=1.99, 95% CI 1.77-2.25; P<0.001 for tertile 2 compared with tertile 1]. The Cox proportional hazards model adjusting for coronary risk factors, ACS presentation, extent of coronary artery disease, C-reactive protein and other covariates identified leucocyte count with a HR (hazard ratio)=1.05 (95% CI 1.02-1.07; P<0.001 for 1000 cells/mm(3) increase in the leucocyte count), but not C-reactive protein (HR=1.13, 95% CI 0.95-1.34; P=0.15 for a 1 tertile increase in the C-reactive protein concentration) as an independent correlate of 1-year mortality. We conclude that elevated leucocyte count, but not C-reactive protein, predicts 1-year mortality independent of cardiovascular risk factors across the entire spectrum of patients with ACS treated with PCI.", 
    "22": "Statins are widely used drugs to reduce LDL cholesterol and risk for cardiovascular disease. Varying degrees of myopathies occur with statin use, ranging from mild myalgic symptoms alone to documented muscle damage and rhabdomyolysis. The activity of creatine kinase (CK) above a population-based reference range has been used to differentiate myalgias from documented myositic injury due to statins. However, because normal ranges for CK depend on gender, exercise, and ethnicity and are necessarily broad, it is possible for a patient to have myositic injury with a result that is within the reference range. Therefore, serial testing relative to baseline levels may be more effective in detecting mild increases in CK.",

    "26": "The 2007 European Guidelines on Hypertension are jointly sponsored by the European Society of Cardiology and the European Society of Hypertension. Changes with respect to the previous 2003 Guidelines are few but some are significant. Perhaps the most significant change is inclusion of metabolic syndrome as a cardiovascular risk factor similar in importance to diabetes mellitus or target-organ damage. Also striking is the recognition of chronic kidney disease as a very high risk condition in hypertensive patients. Masked arterial hypertension (AHT) is included for the first time as a new entity that is present in 10-15% of cases and associated with increased cardiovascular risk. The eye fundus examination is no longer considered necessary in the diagnostic evaluation. The decision to start treatment should be based on systolic and diastolic BP values and on assessment of total cardiovascular risk. Drug therapy should be started early. The delay to check the response to nonpharmacological measures should be only some weeks and not months as was previously established. Any of the five large groups (diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium antagonists, ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II blockers) is valid for the first stage of treatment, although the choice should be individualized based on the possible risk factors and associated cardiovascular and renal disease. The guidelines place strong emphasis on drug combinations because most patients will require more than one drug for their control.",

Because the content of the next few pages was necessarily chosen on the basis of the authors' preferences, we assume that many other topics of great interest have been left out of this summary. In any case, we hope that this article will be interesting and useful and also serve as an subject of debate in nephrology forums.",

    "29": "Intravenous bisphosphonate therapy is associated with acute phase reaction characterized by fever and musculoskeletal pain. Bisphosphonates have been shown in vitro to activate gammadeltaT-cells to proliferate and produce cytokines, suggesting a role in acute phase reaction, which can be effectively blocked by statins. We conducted a double-blind randomized crossover placebo controlled study in 12 children (12.1 +/- 4.2 yr; 10 girls and 2 boys) receiving intravenous bisphosphonates to evaluate whether statins can be used to prevent acute phase reaction associated with therapy. Children received two cycles given 3-4 mo apart of intravenous bisphosphonate given on 2 consecutive days in each cycle. Atorvastatin 10 mg or placebo was given orally once a day for 3 days, starting the day before intravenous bisphosphonate therapy and on the 2 infusion days. We measured pain using a visual analog pain scale at five time points in 0-48 h, oxycodone use for pain, acetaminophen for fever, C-reactive protein (CRP), and total and percent gammadeltaT-cells. There was a nonsignificant decrease in pain, oxycodone use, and acetaminophen use with Atorvastatin compared with placebo. There was no difference in CRP and total or percent gammadeltaT-cells between the two groups. The results remained unchanged after adjustment for Atorvastatin versus placebo given with the first cycle. We conclude that in vivo Atorvastatin may not be as effective in modulating the acute phase reaction associated with intravenous bisphosphonate as would have been anticipated from in vitro studies.", 
    "30": "Consumption of plant sterol- or stanol-enriched margarines by statin users results in an additional LDL-cholesterol reduction of approximately 10 %, which may be larger than the average decrease of 3-7 % achieved by doubling the statin dose. However, whether this effect persists in the long term is not known. Therefore, we examined in patients already on stable statin treatment the effects of 85 weeks of plant sterol and stanol ester consumption on the serum lipoprotein profile, cholesterol metabolism, and bile acid synthesis. For this, a double-blind randomised trial was designed in which fifty-four patients consumed a control margarine with no added plant sterols or stanols for 5 weeks (run-in period). For the next 85 weeks, seventeen subjects continued with the control margarine and the other two groups with either a plant sterol (n 18) or plant stanol (n 19) (2.5 g/d each) ester-enriched margarine. Blood was sampled at the end of the run-in period and every 20 weeks during the intervention period. Compared with the control group, plant sterol and stanol ester consumption reduced LDL-cholesterol by 0.28 mmol/l (or 8.7 %; P = 0.08) and 0.42 mmol/l (13.1 %; P = 0.006) respectively after 85 weeks. No effects were found on plasma concentrations of oxysterols or 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, a bile acid synthesis marker. We conclude that long-term consumption of both plant sterol and stanol esters effectively lowered LDL-cholesterol concentrations in statin users.", 
    "31": "1. The aims were to attest whether HepG2-GS-3A4, a cell line into which the human CYP3A4 gene was introduced, can be used for a screening of chemicals that will inhibit CYP3A4 activity. 2. The capacity of the cells for metabolizing CYP3A4 substrates in vitro was evaluated. Also determined was the effect of CYP3A4 inhibitors and non-inhibitors on nifedipine hydroxylation. Western blot, immunohistochemostry and determination of beta-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-reductase activity were performed. 3. HepG2-GS-3A4 selectively metabolized substrates of CYP3A4 (diazepam, nordiazepam, lidocaine, atorvastatin, and nifedipine) to a greater degree than control. The metabolites were easily detected in the culture medium. Values of V(max) of HepG2-GS-3A4 were about 30- to 100-fold higher than those of the control, while values of K(m) were comparable. Pre-incubation of cimetidine and ketoconazole significantly inhibited nifedipine hydroxylation, while addition of inhibitors specific to other isoforms of CYPs had no substantial effect. The HepG2-GS-3A4 expressed a higher amount of CYP3A4 protein and mRNA than control. Most NADPH reductase activity was detected in microsomal fractions. 4 In conclusion, HepG2-GS-3A4 sufficiently and selectively metabolize substrates of CYP3A4, and inhibitors of CYP3A4 reduced the metabolism. Because the metabolites were easily detected in the culture medium, this cell might be useful for the new and easy screening of new drugs for the evaluation of CYP3A4-inhibiting activity in vitro.", 
    "32": "The effects of NO-Fluvastatin on proliferation of human lens epithelial cells (HLECs) and the action mechanism were investigated. Cell proliferation was assessed by MTT assay. Cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry. The expression of cell cycle regulatory proteins CyclinE mRNA and P21(waf1) mRNA was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). MTT staining colorimetry showed that HLECs proliferation was markedly inhibited by NO-Fluvastatin and the effect was dependently related to time (24, 48 and 72 h) and dosage (1, 5 and 20 mumol/L). Flow cytometry revealed that NO-Fluvastatin could significantly block HLECs in the G(0)/G(1) phase, resulting in the increased cells in the G(0)/G(1) phase and decreased in the S phase (P<0.05). RT-PCR showed that NO-Fluvastatin could obviously inhibit the CyclinE mRNA expression and induce the P21(waf1) mRNA expression as compared with the negative control groups (P<0.05). This experiment suggested that NO-Fluvastatin could suppress the proliferation of HLECs by regulating cell cycle regulatory proteins (inhibiting the expression of CyclinE mRNA and inducing the expression of P21(waf1) mRNA), resulting in the arrest of HLECs in the G(0)/G(1) phase, which can offer theory basis for NO-Fluvastatin in treating posterior capsular opacification in clinic practice.", 
    "33": "The effect of atorvastatin on warfarin-induced aortic medial calcification and systolic blood pressure (SBP) of rats induced by warfarin was studied. Thirty healthy and adult rats were randomly divided into Warfarin group (n=10), Atorvastatin group (n=10) and normal control group (n=10). Caudal arterial pressure of rats was measured once a week, and 4 weeks later, aorta was obtained. Elastic fiber, collagen fiber and calcium accumulation in tunica media of cells were measured by Von Kossa staining. The results showed that warfarin treatment led to elevation of systolic blood pressure and aortic medial calcification. The chronic treatment also increased collagen, but decreased elastin in the aorta. However, the atorvastatin treatment had adverse effects. It was concluded that treatment with atorvastatin presented evidence of blood pressure lowing and calcification reducing. These data demonstrate that atorvastatin protected aortic media from warfarin-induced calcification and elevation of systolic blood pressure.",

The present study addresses whether plasma apelin increases after hypolipidemic intervention either through therapeutic life style change (TLC) or statin treatment. A total of 134 patients were subjected to treatment with a TLC intervention for 12 weeks. Of these, 116 successfully completed the period, and LDL-cholesterol level decreased to target level (<160 mg/dL) in 54 (46.5%) individuals. The remaining 62 patients were treated with rosuvastatin for 12 weeks, and 56 of them finished the study. Circulating apelin, adiponectin, leptin, TNF-alpha, hsCRP and insulin levels were determined both at baseline and after TLC intervention and statin treatment. There was no significant change in plasma apelin concentration in patients unresponsive to TLC (p=0.110). LDL-cholesterol lowering either through TLC or statin treatment was accompanied by an increase in plasma apelin (p=0.000, p=0.020) and adiponectin (p=0.001, p=0.011). Serum leptin decreased after successful TLC (p=0.042/male, p=0.023/female) but not after statin treatment (p=0.959/male, p=0.134/female). Serum TNF-alpha (p=0.902) and plasma hsCRP (p=0.135) levels remained unchanged after TLC intervention but decreased after statin treatment (p=0.000, p=0.023, respectively). Plasma insulin and homeostasis model assessment scores decreased after TLC (p=0.000 for both) but not rosuvastatin treatment (p=0.865, p=0.722, respectively). In conclusion, independent of the type of treatment, reduction in LDL-cholesterol levels in otherwise healthy people with isolated dyslipidemia results in an increase in plasma apelin concentration. More experiments may show a substantial role for this peptide in the mechanism of atherosclerosis.",

It was significantly lower in group SS than in group PS (P < 0.05). Plasma concentrations of lipids (low-density lipoprotein, triglyceride, free fatty acid, and total cholesterol) in groups P, PS, and SS were significantly lower than in group C; and hepatic CYP3A levels were significantly higher in group SS than in groups P or PS after treatment (P < 0.005 for both).",

Prostate cancer cells release tissue factor (TF)-bearing, cholesterol-rich prostasomes which are pro-coagulant in vitro and a possible source for the blood-borne TF found in prostate cancer patients. We investigated the effect of cholesterol depletion on the production of prostasomes and on the TF activity in the conditioned medium of simvastatin-treated PC3 cells. Human PC3 prostate cancer cells were treated with high and low concentrations of simvastatin for different time periods. Caspase-3 was detected with the Array Scan microscope, whereas TF mRNA and protein were analyzed by TaqMan and flow cytometry. TF activity was assessed by measuring the cleavage of a chromogenic thrombin substrate. Prostasomes were isolated by repeated centrifugations and detected and quantified by flow cytometry. A micromolar dose of simvastatin caused reduction of TF expression and induction of apoptosis in the PC3 cells. The levels of TF on the prostasomes were also decreased but the TF activity in the conditioned medium of the simvastatin-treated PC3 cells was increased due to apoptosis-dependent release of prostasomes. Treatment with a nanomolar dose of simvastatin did not induce apoptosis or alter the expression of TF but instead decreased the production and release of the prostasomes. The TF activity was reduced in parity with the decline in prostasome release. In conclusion, in prostate cancer, a nanomolar dose of simvastatin may have an anti-thrombotic effect due to decreased levels of circulating TF-bearing prostasomes.",

The standardized mortality ratio (compared with the population in England and Wales) was calculated before and from 1 January 1992. In patients aged 20-79 years, CHD mortality fell significantly by 37% (95% CI = 7-56) from 3.4- to 2.1-fold excess. Primary prevention resulted in a 48% reduction in CHD mortality from 2.0-fold excess to none, with a smaller reduction of nearly 25% in patients with established disease. Coronary mortality was reduced more in women than in men. In patients without known CHD at registration, all-cause mortality from 1992 was 33% (21-43), lower than in the general population, mainly due to a 37% (21-50) lower risk of fatal cancer.",

    "59": "The ability of neutrophils to sense and migrate toward damaged tissue is a vital component of the innate immune response. Paradoxically, this same migration serves as the hallmark of a number of inflammatory conditions, including ischemic reperfusion injury, atherosclerosis, arthritis, and Crohn's disease. More recent evidence suggests that neutrophil infiltration into the cardiac allograft following transplantation is a contributing factor in allograft rejection. We have demonstrated previously a positive correlation between the degree of neutrophil migration and subsequent rejection grades in a cohort of cardiac transplant recipients. Intracellular signaling pathways that are intimately involved in neutrophil migration thus offer potential targets of manipulation in the treatment of such conditions. 3-hydroxy-3-methylyglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors or statins are emerging as potential anti-inflammatory agents and have a proven survival benefit in the transplant population. Yet, little is known about their ability to modulate neutrophil function and their subsequent mechanism of action. We demonstrate here that pravastatin, simvastatin, and atorvastatin significantly reduce neutrophil transendothelial migration toward the chemoattractant fMLP. This effect is independent of any change in neutrophil adhesion or adhesion molecule expression but is related to the ability of statins to reduce fMLP-induced Rho activity in neutrophils. This was confirmed by the ability of the Rho precursor geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate to rescue the statin-mediated reduction in neutrophil transendothelial migration. Understanding the mechanisms of action of statins in the neutrophil allows for their use in targeting excessive migration in inappropriate inflammatory conditions.", 
    "60": "The present study examined the effect of fluvastatin on Cu(2+)-induced hydroxyl radical generation (*OH) in the extracellular fluid of rat myocardium using microdialysis technique (O system). Fluvastatin, an inhibitor of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) oxidation, was administered at a dose of 5.0 mg/kg/day i.p. for 4 weeks. Rats were anesthetized and sodium salicylate in Ringer's solution (0.5 nmol/microl/min) was infused through a microdialysis probe to detect the generation of *OH as reflected by the nonenzymatic formation of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHBA) in the myocardium. When CuSO(4) was infused through the microdialysis probe, CuSO(4) clearly produced an increase in *OH formation trapped as 2,3-DHBA (R(2)=0.983). However, when corresponding experiments were performed with fluvastatin (5.0 mg/kg/day i.p. for 4 weeks) pretreated animals, small increases in the level of 2,3-DHBA products were observed. When LDL is oxidized by Cu(2+), Cu(2+) can be reduced to Cu(1+) by LDL. Fenton-type reactions in the presence of Cu(1+) yields highly cytotoxic *OH. These results suggest that Cu(2+)-induced *OH generation may be reduced by inhibiting LDL oxidation with fluvastatin.",

The initial non-invasive strategy should include an echocardiography and a stress test (exercise ECG, stress echocardiography or perfusion scintigraphy), followed, in the majority of cases, by a coronary angiography. Lifestyle changes are mandatory and are fully part of secondary prevention: cigarette smoking withdrawal, mediterranean diet (fruit, vegetables, fish and poultry), weight loss, moderate alcohol consumption, increased omega-3 fatty acids and regular physical activity. Pharmacological therapy of stable coronary artery disease should associate short-acting nitrates (in case of angina), and systematically aspirin and statin. A beta-blocker should be used as a first-line therapy, particularly in the post-infarction setting or in case of left ventricular dysfunction. In case of contraindication, a calcium inhibitor or a long-acting nitrate should be choosen. ACE inhibitors are indicated in patients with left ventricular dysfunction, hypertension or diabetes and should also be considered in high-risk patients.

A diagnosis of drug-induced ANCA-associated vasculitis (on the basis of mononeuritis multiplex, sensorineural hearing loss and markedly increased anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) ANCA) and statin-induced distal myopathy was made. He was treated with three 500 mg doses of methylprednisolone, followed by slowly tapering dose of oral corticosteroids from 30 mg once daily (OD). He was also started on azathioprin (2.5 mg/kg). He had a dramatic improvement of his myalgia, hearing loss and sensory symptoms and went into complete clinical remission. His inflammatory markers rapidly returned to normal, and MPO-ANCA normalised within 3 months of starting immunosuppressive therapy and remained negative on further testing.

Also, the normal expression of Ca(2+) regulatory proteins is critical for efficient myocardial function. However, it is still unclear whether the beneficial effect of statins on cardiac function is associated with alterations of Ca(2+) regulatory proteins. In this study, we investigated the effect of atorvastatin on cardiac function in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), focusing in particular on its impact on the expression of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-adenosine triphosphatase (SERCA2a), phospholamban (PLB) and its phosphorylated form (phosphorylated PLB), all of which are Ca(2+) regulatory proteins in myocardium. SHRs showed decreases in gene expression of SERCA2a and phosphorylated PLB, and reduction in SERCA activity in the left ventricular myocardium, as well as reduced cardiac function, compared to age-matched Wistar Kyoto rats (WKYs). Furthermore, we showed that in SHRs atorvastatin preserved cardiac dysfunction accompanied by positive alterations in calcium regulatory proteins, with up-regulation in expression of SERCA2a and phosphorylated PLB, and with improvement of SERCA activity. Thus, atorvastatin has positive effects on calcium regulatory proteins, which may be one of the mechanisms of the beneficial effect of statins on cardiac function in spontaneously hypertensive rats.", 
    "83": "In this overview the actual guideline-recommendations for anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation and the problems of the currently available therapy are discussed. Furthermore an outlook over future developments in this field is given. Effective anticoagulation can prohibit thrombembolic events and is thus essential for the prognosis of patients suffering from atrial fibrillation. Until now vitamin-K-antagonists (VKAs) and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) are available for oral anticoagulation in these patients. VKAs demonstrate a satisfying efficiency combined with rather high bleeding hazard. ASA on the other hand allows only moderate risk reduction with minimal side effects. Thus the guidelines recommend anticoagulation tailored to the individual risk, which can be evaluated by the CHADS2-Score. New therapeutic strategies, like the factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban or the factor II inhibitor dabigatran, are actually evaluated in phase III studies. These drugs bear the hope of higher efficiency combined with improved safety and much more comfortable use in the daily practice (e. g. no need for INR measurement, no dose adaptation).",

Several clinical and recently basic studies have suggested an extra-beneficial effect of the statins in the prevention of atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease. These studies showed that statins may affect the cardiovascular system beyond their effect on the lipid profile, and it was suggested that they affect the immunological system and vascular inflammation. Many of the beneficial pleiotropic effects of statins occur as a result of modulated endothelial function and reduced inflammatory processes. Attempting to understand these properties of statins is an exciting field of research that will also improve our understanding of vascular biology in health and disease, and thus enable the better use of this drug class in clinical practice.",

This study was designed to compare gene expression profiles of atorvastatin with the newly developed ROCK2 inhibitor SLx-2119 in primary cultures of normal human endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts. Cells were treated with each compound for 24 h, after which total RNA was isolated and genome-wide gene-expression profiles were obtained with Illumina arrays. Because of the known effect of statins on the actin cytoskeleton and on connective tissue growth factor, a prominent growth factor involved in tissue fibrosis, the effects of SLx-2119 and atorvastatin on the actin cytoskeleton and connective tissue growth factor mRNA were also examined in cultures of smooth muscle cells with a fibrotic phenotype, isolated from biopsies of human intestine with radiation-induced fibrosis. Although SLx-2119 and atorvastatin affected expression of genes belonging to the same biological processes, individual genes were mostly different, consistent with synergistic or additive properties. Both SLx-2119 and atorvastatin reduced connective tissue growth factor mRNA and remodeled the actin cytoskeleton in fibrosis-derived smooth muscle cells, suggesting that both compounds have antifibrotic properties. These results form the basis for further studies to assess the possible therapeutic benefit of combined treatments.", 
    "95": "Statins have been proposed as a novel treatment of respiratory diseases. To determine the beneficial effects of statins on the airway hyperresponsiveness, a characteristic feature of allergic bronchial asthma, the effect of systemic treatment with lovastatin on antigen-induced bronchial smooth muscle hyperresponsiveness was investigated in mice. Male BALB/c mice were sensitized and repeatedly challenged with ovalbumin antigen. Animals were also treated with lovastatin (4 mg/kg/day, i.p.) once a day prior to and during the antigen inhalation period. The bronchial smooth muscle responsiveness to acetylcholine, but not to high K(+)-depolarization, was markedly and significantly augmented in the repeatedly antigen challenged mice. The bronchial smooth muscle hyperresponsiveness to acetylcholine induced by antigen exposure was significantly attenuated by the systemic treatment with lovastatin. Thus, lovastatin might have therapeutic potential to ameliorate airway hyperresponsiveness in allergic bronchial asthma.", 
    "96": "PH (pulmonary hypertension) often complicates the disease course of patients with COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and is an indication of a worse prognosis. In the present study, we assessed whether pravastatin administration was effective in improving PH and exercise capacity in COPD patients with PH, and whether the pulmonary protection was mediated by inhibiting ET-1 (endothelin-1) production. In a double-blind parallel design, 53 COPD patients with PH were randomly assigned to receive either placebo or pravastatin (40 mg/day) over a period of 6 months at a medical centre. Baseline characteristics were similar in both groups. The exercise time remained stable throughout the study in the placebo group. After 6 months, the exercise time significantly increased 52% from 660+/-352 to 1006+/-316 s (P<0.0001) in pravastatin-treated patients. With pravastatin, echocardiographically derived systolic PAP (pulmonary artery pressure) decreased significantly from 47+/-8 to 40+/-6 mmHg. There was significant improvement in the Borg dyspnoea score after administering pravastatin. Despite unchanged plasma ET-1 levels throughout the study, urinary excretion of the peptide was decreased and significantly correlated with an improvement in exercise time in pravastatin-treated patients (r=-0.47, P=0.01). In conclusion, pravastatin significantly improved exercise tolerance, and decreased PH and dyspnoea during exercise in COPD patients with PH, probably by inhibiting ET-1 synthesis.",

    "98": "Thirty-three patients with active RA were prescribed simvastatin (40 mg/day) for 3 months. Most of the patients received background traditional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) in stable doses. At the end of treatment there was a reduction in the 28-joint Disease Activity Score (DAS28) and in the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) score.", 
    "99": "Eleven patients (33%) achieved a moderate European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) response. There was a decrease in circulating interleukin (IL)-17 concentrations and spontaneous PBMC proliferation. Anti-CD3-stimulated IL-10 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)alpha production by PBMCs was upregulated after simvastatin therapy. A reduction in serum IL-6 was detected only in the responder group. Baseline circulating IL-10 concentrations were higher in responders than in non-responders.", 
    "100": "Simvastatin treatment is associated with moderate clinical improvement in patients with active RA. Immunological changes produced by simvastatin in peripheral blood are complex and may reflect both its anti- and pro-inflammatory properties.", 
    "101": "Here, we characterize the Aspergillus fumigatus homologue ncsA Neuronal Calcium Sensor. We showed that ncsA is not an essential gene and ncsA growth was decreased in the presence of EGTA and SDS. Furthermore, the ncsA mutant is more resistant to calcium chloride. NcsA:mRFP localizes to the cytoplasm and its cellular localization is not affected by the cellular response to either calcium chloride or EGTA. The ncsA mutant strain is more sensitive to voriconazole, itraconazole, and amphotericin. Polar growth in the DeltancsA mutant was also considerably more affected by lovastatin than in the wild type strain. The Spitzenk\u00f6rper can be visualized in both strains and although the vacuolar system does not seem to be very different, there is an increase in the staining intensity on the germling surface of the ncsA strain. NcsA promotes pmcA and pmcB expression and therefore there is a reduced expression of these ion pumps in the DeltancsA mutant background, and also of other genes involved in the response to calcium in A. fumigatus. The ncsA inactivation mutation is not causing loss of virulence in a low dose murine infection when compared to the corresponding wild type strain.",

    "104": "We compared the long-term health outcomes for a scenario in which all diabetes patients received LLT to those in a 'current practice' scenario, in which 28% received LLT. The model reflected the Dutch diabetes population 40-80 years of age, in 2003. Sensitivity analyses were performed, using more conservative assumptions.", 
    "105": "Over the lifetime, LLT for all diabetes patients reduced the expected cumulative incidences of coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke by, respectively, 6 and 9%. Average life expectancy of Dutch diabetes patients would increase by 0.33 years, ranging from 0.14 years for patients aged 70-79 years, to 0.84 years for patients aged 40-49 years at the start of the simulation. Life-long treatment for patients aged 50-59 contributed most to the life years gained (55,000 out of 146,000). With reduced effectiveness of LLT and fewer patients starting LLT, the cumulative incidences of both CHD and stroke would decrease by approximately 2%. The number needed to treat to prevent one incident case of cardiovascular disease over lifetime was 20 for CHD and 44 for stroke.",

    "109": "A large proportion of Maori (47%) and Pacific (69%) patients had poor glycaemic control at baseline and only small improvements were made over the two years. Significant improvements were made in all the ethnic groups in blood pressure and lipid management at two-year follow-up. By the two-year follow-up, over 75% of Maori and Pacific patients received appropriate treatment with anti-hypertensive and lipid lowering medication and many of the ethnic disparities in risk factors for complications were reduced.", 
    "110": "Participation in the annual review programme may have contributed to improvements in clinical management and reduced disparities in a cohort with Type 2 diabetes. However, the removal of restrictions on statin use in 2002, and introduction of diabetes management guidelines in 2003 may also have improved management standards.", 
    "111": "Diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle is an increasingly recognized clinical entity that may in some cases cause overt congestive heart failure. Currently, treatment of these patients is based on limited studies in patients with symptomatic heart failure. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) drugs, which are primarily used for the treatment of hyperlipidemia, have been shown to have additional pharmacologic properties that may be beneficial in other disease states such as heart failure. Here, we wish to review the current knowledge of the mechanism of action of statins and the probable implications for asymptomatic patients with diastolic dysfunction. We discuss the causes and settings of diastolic dysfunction, the potential role of statin therapy in the treatment of diastolic dysfunction, and potential mechanisms by which statins may show benefit. The use of statins in the setting of diastolic dysfunction, both for treatment of established heart failure as well as to prevent progression of subclinical disease to overt symptomatic expression, is an area of substantial research interest with direct clinical application.", 
    "112": "Cardiovascular disease is characterized by significant prevalence and cost in the managed care setting.

    "114": "As evidenced by a consistent body of clinical trial data, intensive LDL-C reduction plays a critical role in the mitigation of cardiovascular risk. Yet, the effectiveness of lipid-lowering strategies is offset to a significant degree by both physician and patient factors that limit goal attainment. Despite extensive evidence demonstrating the benefits of lipid-lowering therapy, many patients are still not getting to goal because the transition from physician awareness to clinical practice is lagging. Patient noncompliance to therapy also limits goal attainment, thus resulting in poor health outcomes and increasing managed care costs.", 
    "115": "To overcome the issues surrounding LDL-C goal attainment, interventions designed to increase goal attainment should be based not only on the conclusions of clinical trials but also on successful patientand provider-focused behavioral strategies. Interventions for improving adherence to lipid-lowering medication will provide an opportunity to decrease morbidity, mortality, and hospitalization associated with cardiovascular disease.", 
    "116": "The prescription of low-protein diets to patients with chronic kidney disease has several objectives: to lower the dietary phosphorus load and circulating phosphorus and parathyroid hormone levels, and to improve the acid-base control and uremic symptoms while preserving the nutritional status. However, such objectives are always subordinate to the necessity of maintaining adequate calorie intake. An important target of any reduction of dietary protein intake is the delay of renal death and start of dialysis, as demonstrated by several methodologically sound studies and meta-analyses. However, no prospective study has yet confirmed the nephroprotective potential of low-protein diets repeatedly shown in animal models. Such negative results in human studies could be explained by their frequent methodological flaws, as well as by the modest actual reduction of protein intake compared with pre-study levels. The recent Cochrane meta-analysis confirmed that reducing dietary protein intake can delay renal death and dialysis. The Number-to-Treat estimate in the Cochrane meta-analysis (NNT=16) was even better than similar estimates in the statin prevention trials ''4S'' and ''WOSCOPS''.", 
    "117": "While clinical trials demonstrate the benefits of blood pressure and cholesterol reduction, medication adherence in clinical practice is problematic. We hypothesized that a single-pill would be superior to a 2-pill regimen for achieving adherence. In this retrospective, cohort study based on pharmacy claims data, patients newly initiated on a calcium channel blocker (CCB) or statin simultaneously or within 30 days, regardless of sequence, were followed (N=4703). Adherence was measured over 6 months as proportion of days covered (PDC). At baseline, mean age was 63.0 years, 51.6% were female, and mean number of other medications was 7.8. Overall, 16.9% of patients were on single-pill amlodipine/atorvastatin, 15.6% amlodipine + atorvastatin, 24.7% amlodipine + other statin, 13.9% other CCB + atorvastatin, 28.9% other CCB + other statin. Percentages of patients achieving adherence (PDC >or= 80%) were: 67.7% amlodipine/atorvastatin; 49.9% amlodipine + atorvastatin; 40.4% amlodipine + other statin; 46.9% other CCB + atorvastatin; 37.4% other CCB +other statin. After adjusting for treatment selection and cohort differences, odds ratios for adherence with amlodipine/atorvastatin were 1.95 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.80-2.13) vs amlodipine + atorvastatin, 3.10 (95% CI, 2.85-3.38) vs amlodipine + other statin, 2.06 (95% CI, 1.89-2.24) vs other CCB + atorvastatin, 2.85 (95% CI, 2.61-3.10) vs other CCB + other statin (all p<0.0001). Single-pill amlodipine/atorvastatin may provide clinical benefits through improving adherence, offering clinicians a practical solution for cardiovascular risk management.", 
    "118": "Patients with rheumatic disorders have an increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This excess co-morbidity is not fully explained by traditional risk factors. Disease severity is a major risk factor for CVD in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Shared disease mechanisms in atherosclerosis and rheumatic disorders include immune dysregulation and inflammatory pathways, which are potential targets for therapy. Lessons from RA and SLE may have implications for future research on the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic vascular disease in general. Recent data indicate that suppression of inflammation reduces the risk of CVD morbidity and mortality in patients with severe RA. The modest, but clinically relevant, efficacy of atorvastatin treatment in RA adds to the evidence for important anti-inflammatory properties for statins. There is increased recognition of the need for structured preventive strategies to reduce the risk of CVD in patients with rheumatic disease. Such strategies should be based on insights into the role of inflammation in CVD, as well as optimal management of life style related risk factors. In this review, the research agenda for understanding and preventing CVD co-morbidity in patients with rheumatic disorders is discussed.", 
    "119": "Recent clinical trials recommend achieving a low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level of <100 mg/dl in high-risk and <70 mg/dl in very high risk patients. To attain these goals, however, many patients will need statins at high doses. The most frequent side effects related to the use of statins, myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, and increased levels of transaminases, are unusual. Although low and moderate doses show a favourable profile, there is concern about the tolerability of higher doses. During recent years, numerous trials to analyze the efficacy and tolerability of high doses of statins have been published. This paper updates the published data on the safety of statins at high doses.", 
    "120": "The objective of the study is to formulate bilayer tablets consisting of atorvastatin calcium (AT) as an immediate release layer and nicotinic acid (NA) as an extended release layer. The immediate release layer was prepared using super disintegrant croscarmellose sodium and extended release layer using hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC K100M). Both the matrix and bilayer tablets were evaluated for hardness, friability, weight variation, thickness, and drug content uniformity and subjected to in vitro drug release studies. The amount of AT and NA released at different time intervals were estimated by HPLC method. The bilayer tablets showed no significant change either in physical appearance, drug content or in dissolution pattern after storing at 40 degrees C/75% relative humiding (RH) for 3 months. The release of the drug from the tablet was influenced by the polymer content and it was much evident from thermogravimetry/differential thermal analysis (TG/DTA) analysis. The results indicated that the bilayer tablets could be a potential dosage form for delivering AT and NA.",

The incidence of RAS is increasing because of the aging of the US population and increasing prevalence of atherosclerosis. The case of Mrs S, an 82-year-old woman with long-standing hypertension and unilateral RAS detected by magnetic resonance angiography, illustrates the challenges surrounding indications for revascularization. The discussion reviews the clinical presentation and natural history of RAS and strategies for diagnosis. The role of medical therapy, surgery, and endovascular therapy are reviewed, particularly in the context of guidelines and systematic reviews to help clinicians and patients facing this challenging decision.",

DATA EXTRACTION AND STATISTICAL METHOD: From each study relative changes in LDL-C and CRP were extracted. Random effects meta-analysis was used to obtain pooled summary estimates of the average study specific LDL-C and CRP reductions, in total and stratified by dose and type of statin. Weighted correlation analysis and metaregression analysis was used to investigate the relationship between the LDL-C and CRP changes adjusted for baseline values, type of statin and dose.",

We found a positive correlation between the average LDL-C and CRP reduction (r = 0.49, p = 0.010) which increased when adjusting for pre-treatment concentrations (r = 0.79, p < 0.001). The effect of statins on CRP were strongly related to the changes in LDL-C and baseline concentrations, independent of the type and dose of statin used.",

    "126": "Statin treatment is essential for the prevention of vascular disease. Despite the established benefits of statins, discontinuation of these agents is frequent. Whether statin discontinuation leads to adverse outcomes is still debated and the most convincing evidence is mainly restricted to patients who experienced an acute vascular event. It is important to establish if this phenomenon extends to other populations, like those without vascular disease but with a high calculated risk. Overall, it appears that even a brief discontinuation of statins might be harmful. Therefore, statin treatment should not be interrupted except if there is a very good reason. Moreover, patients should be instructed as to why they must adhere to their medication. Adherence should be monitored regularly.",

Modified Neurological Severity Scores were used to evaluate the sensory motor functional recovery. Rats were killed at 1, 3, 7, 14, and 35 days after treatment, and brain tissue was harvested for terminal deoxynucleotidyl nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining, caspase-3 activity assay, and Western blot analysis.", 
    "129": "Simvastatin significantly decreased the modified Neurological Severity Scores from Days 7 to 35 after TBI, significantly reduced the number of TUNEL-positive cells at Day 3, suppressed the caspase-3 activity at Days 1 and 3 after TBI, and increased phosphorylation of Akt as well as Forkhead transcription factor 1, inhibitory-kappaB, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase, which are the downstream targets of the prosurvival Akt signaling protein.", 
    "130": "These data suggested that simvastatin reduces the apoptosis in neuronal cells and improves the sensory motor function recovery after TBI. These beneficial effects of simvastatin may be mediated through activation of Akt, Forkhead transcription factor 1 and nuclear factor-kappaB signaling pathways, which suppress the activation of caspase-3 and apoptotic cell death, and thereby, lead to neuronal function recovery after TBI.",

In a randomized double-blind cross-over study comparing intensive lipid-lowering treatment using 80 mg simvastatin mono-treatment with combination treatment of 10 mg simvastatin and 10 mg ezetimibe, we found a similar treatment effect on EPC levels. Secondary analyses of these data suggested that both treatment regimens had increased circulating EPCs to control levels (626 +/- 428 after combination treatment, P < 0.01; 524 +/- 372 EPC/mL after monotherapy, P < 0.05). Serum levels of EPC-mobilizing factor SCF-sR correlated with reduced EPC levels and normalized concurrently with treatment.",

To reduce flushing, nicotinic acid should be initiated at low stepwise increasing dosages. beta-blocker therapy should not be stopped acutely in coronary heart disease patients. If beta-blocker therapy has to be terminated, blood pressure should be monitored closely and, if necessary controlled with other medication. Termination of statin therapy in the acute phase after strokes or acute coronary syndromes is associated with increased cardiovascular events and should therefore be avoided.", 
    "156": "Clinical studies suggest that statins reduce proteinuria and slow the decline in kidney function in chronic kidney disease. Given a rich literature identifying podocyte apoptosis as an early step in the pathophysiological progression to proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis, we hypothesized that rosuvastatin protects podocytes from undergoing apoptosis. Regarding a potential mechanism, our lab has shown that the cell cycle protein, p21, has a prosurvial role in podocytes and there is literature showing statins upregulate p21 in other renal cells. Therefore, we queried whether rosuvastatin is prosurvival in podocytes through a p21-dependent pathway.", 
    "157": "Two independent apoptotic triggers, puromycin aminonucleoside (PA) and adriamycin (ADR), were used to induce apoptosis in p21 +/+ and p21 -/- conditionally immortalized mouse podocytes with or without pre-exposure to rosuvastatin. Apoptosis was measured by two methods: Hoechst 33342 staining and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). To establish a role for p21, p21 levels were measured by western blotting following rosuvastatin exposure and p21 was stably transduced into p21 -/- mouse podocytes.", 
    "158": "Rosuvastatin protects against ADR- and PA-induced apoptosis in podocytes. Further, exposure to rosuvastatin increases p21 levels in podocytes in vitro. ADR induces apoptosis in p21 -/- mouse podocytes, but rosuvastatin's protective effect is not seen in the absence of p21. Reconstituting p21 in p21 -/- podocytes restores rosuvastatin's prosurvival effect.", 
    "159": "Rosuvastatin is prosurvival in injured podocytes. Rosuvastatin exerts its protective effect through a p21-dependent antiapoptotic pathway. These findings suggest that statins decrease proteinuria by protecting against podocyte apoptosis and subsequent podocyte depopulation.", 
    "160": "Bilateral leg compartment syndrome due to myonecrosis caused by inappropriate use of statins is a rare but potentially fatal complication of this lipid lowering medication. We report a case of a 39-year-old woman who presented with suspicious critical lower limb ischemia. Subsequently, bilateral leg compartment syndrome and myonecrosis developed. The primary cause of myonecrosis was due to misuse of simvastatin mistaken by the patient for a weight-reducing drug. Urgent fasciotomies were performed and the patient underwent urgent renal replacement therapy with continuous hemodialysis for acute renal failure due to myoglobinuria. After this complex treatment, the patient was discharged. She almost fully recovered with only a residual paresis of the left fibular nerve. According to literature, this is a unique case of bilateral compartment syndrome and myonecrosis with acute renal failure due to statin overdose leading to acute renal failure and bilateral fasciotomy.", 
    "161": "This study was designed to assess the diagnostic value of dynamic patterns of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1b, IL-6, TNF-alpha) in patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) and restenosis of coronary stents 14 months after their implantation for long-term prophylaxis of dyslipoproteinemia. A total of 40 patients with IHD of advanced functional classes (FC) were examined. Blood cytokine levels were measured before, 1 day, and 12-18 months after coronary stenting. Two groups of 23 and 17 patients included cases with recurrent angina and without it respectively. The main parameters measured in the study were in-stent restenosis rate, incidence of' acute myocardial infarction (AMI), mortality rate, frequency of hospitalization for unstable angina, and the levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Considerable activation of cytokines in patients with post-infarction cardiac dysfunction who rarely resorted to therapy with statins (16.7%) was associated with the high rate of recurrent coronary insufficiency related to in-stent occlusion (8.7%), progressive atherosclerosis (65.2%), impaired myocardial perfusion, and restenosis of coronary stents (26.1%). Patients lacking apparent expression of serum cytokines after revascularization while receiving efficacious secondary prophylaxis of dyslipidemia (13.8 and 17% decrease of triglycerides (TG) and low density lipoproteins (LDL) cholesterol respectively, p = 0.04) had left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) improved by 12.5% (p = 0.03%), left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) decreased by 15.8% (p = 0.03), and frequency of ischemic perfusion defect (PD) reduced by 45.3% (p = 0.01). Moreover, they showed low incidence of progressive coronary atherosclerosis (17.6%) in the absence of in-stent restenosis. It is concluded that the frequency of restenosis of coronary stents after endovascular myocardial revascularization depends on the preprocedural rise in IL-1b content (R = 0.62, p = 0.0023). It is concluded that long-term secondary prophylaxis of dyslipoproteinemia in patients with ischemic dysfunction at risk of coronary restenosis effectively (more than thrice) decreases the occurrence of coronary stent restenosis after endovascular revasularization.", 
    "162": "Statins have multiple effects, including anti-inflammatory actions, lowering C-reactive protein levels, and reducing coronary events. We performed a post hoc analysis of the randomized placebo-controlled 4D Study that had evaluated the efficacy and safety of atorvastatin in 1255 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were on maintenance hemodialysis. Here we determined the relationship between atorvastatin treatment, C-reactive protein, and the outcome of patients who had pre-specified and adjudicated endpoints of all-cause mortality, composite vascular endpoint, myocardial infarction, sudden death, and stroke. Atorvastatin had no significant effect on the risk of composite vascular endpoint or death relative to placebo in any quartile of baseline C-reactive protein. These baseline levels were not significantly different between the treated and placebo group and remained stable at 6 months on atorvastatin but significantly increased in those patients on placebo. All of the patients with baseline C-reactive protein in the fourth quartile had a significantly increased risk of deaths and in composite vascular endpoint compared to patients in the first quartile. The mean value of two consecutive C-reactive protein measurements was associated with significant increases in the risk of sudden death, stroke, all-cause mortality and composite vascular endpoint. Our results show that C-reactive protein was highly predictive of outcome, but atorvastatin treatment was not associated with reduced relative risks in the composite vascular endpoint or mortality in patients on hemodialysis with or without inflammation.", 
    "163": "Recurrent episodes of life-threatening myoglobinuria in childhood are caused by inborn errors of glycogenolysis, mitochondrial fatty acid beta-oxidation, and oxidative phosphorylation. Nonetheless, approximately half of the patients do not suffer from a defect in any of these pathways. Using homozygosity mapping, we identified six deleterious mutations in the LPIN1 gene in patients who presented at 2-7 years of age with recurrent, massive rhabdomyolysis. The LPIN1 gene encodes the muscle-specific phosphatidic acid phosphatase, a key enzyme in triglyceride and membrane phospholipid biosynthesis. Of six individuals who developed statin-induced myopathy, one was a carrier for Glu769Gly, a pathogenic mutation in the LPIN1 gene. Analysis of phospholipid content disclosed accumulation of phosphatidic acid and lysophospholipids in muscle tissue of the more severe genotype. Mutations in the LPIN1 gene cause recurrent rhabdomyolysis in childhood, and a carrier state may predispose for statin-induced myopathy.", 
    "164": "There is evidence to suppose that cholesterol-lowering medicine might confer protection against dementia, probably via modulation of cholesterol synthesis in the brain. The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential influence of statins and cholesterol diet on selected parameters relevant to Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology.", 
    "165": "For 15 days, rats were orally administered simvastatin (10 or 20mg/kg b.wt.), atorvastatin (10 or 20mg/kg b.wt.), or aqua (control group); and one group was fed high-cholesterol (2%) diet. At the end of experiments brain (and plasma) cholesterol, lathosterol, hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase protein, acetylcholinesterase activity, amyloid beta (40 and 42) and cholesterol synthesis rate (using the incorporation of deuterium from deuterated water) were determined and statistically compared to those of aqua.", 
    "166": "Both statins were able to lower cholesterol in the plasma, but none elicited an effect on total brain cholesterol. Significant reductions of brain lathosterol and cholesterol synthesis rate were observed after simvastatin and atorvastatin treatment. Acetylcholinesterase activity, amyloid beta and hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase levels remained unaffected by the two drugs.", 
    "167": "This study brings additional evidence of a role for statins in cholesterol synthesis in the brain. Our data question the relationship between amyloid beta, acetylcholinesterase activity and cholesterol synthesis in the rat brain as well as the assumption about no exchange between peripheral and brain cholesterol pools.", 
    "168": "Bisphosphonates and statins target the mevalonate pathway of biosynthesis of prenyl groups, which are necessary for the lipid modification of small GTP-binding proteins (eg, Ras, Rac, Rho) that transduce a wide array of extracellular growth and differentiation signals from cell surface receptors to the nucleus. Interference with this pathway has been shown to confer beneficial anti-inflammatory properties in vitro and in animal models of inflammation. Primarily open-label data in spondylo-arthritis suggests mild to moderate efficacy on symptoms and function but their primary clinical role may be as adjunctive therapy to manage systemic osteoporosis and risk for cardiovascular events.", 
    "169": "To evaluate the effects of cyclosporin A and itraconazole, which were used as inhibitors of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and/or cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 on the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin in rats.", 
    "170": "The pharmacokinetic parameters of atorvastatin were measured after intravenous (2 mg/kg) and intragastric (10 mg/kg) administration of atorvastatin in rats, which were pretreated with cyclosporin A (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg) or itraconazole (5, 10, and 20 mg/kg).", 
    "171": "Compared with the control rats, cyclosporin A and itraconazole altered the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin significantly. The AUC0-t values of atorvastatin after intragastric administration, pretreated with cyclosporin A (5-20 mg/kg), increased by 32.3%, 61.8%, and 187.2%, respectively, but the CLbile values decreased (P<0.01, 5-20 mg/kg). With pretreatment of itraconazole (5-20 mg/kg), the AUC(0-t) values of atorvastatin increased by 88.2%, 102%, and 123%, respectively, but the CL(bile) values decreased (P<0.01, 5-20 mg/kg).", 
    "172": "These data indicated that cyclosporin A could be effective in inhibiting the efflux of atorvastatin, and itraconazole could be effective in inhibiting both the metabolism and biliary excretion of atorvastatin.", 
    "173": "Cardiovascular remodeling is closely associated with cholesterol and is attenuated by statins. The spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) has a low serum cholesterol level and evident cardiovascular remodeling. The aims of the present study were to characterize the effects of atorvastatin on tissue cholesterol content and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase expression and activity in four tissues from SHR: liver, heart, aorta and kidney.", 
    "174": "SHR and normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY) were treated daily with atorvastatin (50 mg/kg) for 8 weeks. Cholesterol levels of serum and tissues (liver, heart, aorta and kidney) were determined by commercial enzymatic methods. Western blot analysis and high performance liquid chromatogram (HPLC) were used to assay the expression and activity of enzyme respectively.", 
    "175": "Treatment with atorvastatin decreased cholesterol content and HMGCoA reductase expression and activity in all four tissues of SHR. However, in WKY, atorvastatin only altered HMG-CoA reductase in liver, where the protein expression was upregulated but the enzyme activity was decreased.", 
    "176": "The present study demonstrates that the effects of atorvastatin on tissue cholesterol content and HMG-CoA reductase are strain- and tissue-specific.", 
    "177": "Tamoxifen has been the mainstay of endocrine therapy for estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. However, approximately 40% of breast cancer patients do not respond to tamoxifen treatment. Further, most tumors eventually acquire tamoxifen resistance. Therefore, it is necessary to develop effective modalities to enhance the efficacy of tamoxifen in breast cancer treatment. In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which breast cancer cells develop resistance against tamoxifen from the viewpoint of tamoxifen-induced apoptosis. Overexpression of the anti-apoptotic molecule survivin rendered the human breast cancer cells MCF-7 resistant to tamoxifen-induced apoptosis. To examine whether the down-regulation of survivin can enhance tamoxifen-induced apoptosis, we introduced siRNA targeting the survivin gene (survivin-siRNA) into MCF-7 cells. Survivin-siRNA transfection not only induced apoptosis without tamoxifen treatment but also augmented the tamoxifen-induced apoptosis. We have previously demonstrated that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (HRIs), which are widely used to reduce the serum cholesterol levels in hypercholesterolemia patients, decreases survivin expression in colon cancer cells. To develop a pharmacological approach for improving the efficacy of tamoxifen treatment, we determined whether HRIs can enhance tamoxifen-induced apoptosis. Lovastatin, an HRI, down-regulated the expression of survivin protein in MCF-7 cells in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, the proportion of apoptotic cells induced by the tamoxifen and lovastatin combination was greater than the theoretical additive effect. These results suggest that survivin may function as a factor inducing resistance against tamoxifen-induced apoptosis, and the combined use of tamoxifen and HRI may be a novel approach to overcome tamoxifen resistance in breast cancer.", 
    "178": "Considerable interindividual variation exists in cholesterol-lowering response to 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) inhibitors (statins). HMGCR catalyzes the rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis, and also plays a significant role in cholesterol homeostasis. We evaluated the association of a single nucleotide polymorphism (rs17238540) in the HMGCR gene with lipid-lowering response to statins in a large population-based cohort of patients with diabetes.", 
    "179": "One thousand six hundred and one patients commencing statins between 1993 and 2006 were identified from the Genetics of Diabetes Audit and Research in Tayside Scotland database. Statin response was determined by both percentage change in lipids, and whether patients failed to reach a total cholesterol target of less than or equal to 4 mmol/l. Covariates included HMGCR genotype, baseline lipids, age, sex, adherence and statin dose. All patients were genotyped for rs17238540 using a TAQMAN-based allelic discrimination assay.", 
    "180": "Twenty-eight percent of individuals homozygous for the more frequent T allele failed to reach target compared with 51% of the individuals with a single copy of the minor G allele (carrier frequency 3.3%), with an adjusted odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for failure of 2.93 (1.61-5.34) mmol/l, P = 0.0005. In addition, we found that the heterozygotes had a 13% smaller reduction in total cholesterol (-32.3 vs. -37.1%, P = 0.0081) and a 27% smaller reduction in triglycerides (-27.5 vs. -37.6%, P = 0.0046).", 
    "181": "Individuals heterozygous for the G allele of rs17238540 in the HMGCR gene may respond less well to statin therapy in terms of total cholesterol and triglyceride lowering."
