Clinical significance of drug interactions varies. * Studies which only identified drug interactions of potentially major clinical significance found lower prevalence, of between 2 and 16%. * Prevalence of drug interactions defined 'potentially hazardous' has had limited study, with no publications identified for the Australian population. WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS * In the study population of 287 074, 1.5% of subjects were dispensed potentially hazardous interacting drug pairs. * However, limited to populations on specific medicines, it was found that for patients dispensed verapamil, methotrexate, amiodarone, lithium, warfarin, cyclosporin and itraconazole, potentially hazardous interactions occurred at a rate greater than 5%. * These patients should be the focus of medication review programmes to avoid potentially serious adverse drug events. BACKGROUND Up to 21% of adverse drug event-related hospital admissions are due to drug interactions. Clinical significance of drug interactions varies, and drug interactions defined 'potentially hazardous' are more likely to contribute to morbidity and mortality. AIM The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of potentially hazardous drug interactions in an elderly Australian veteran population. METHODS This study assessed the prevalence of potentially hazardous drug interactions, where hazardous was defined in three or more international drug interaction references, using Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme pharmacy claims data. Analysis was limited to patients who received regular concurrent dispensings of potentially hazardous interacting medicines. RESULTS Of the 287 074 subjects included in the study, 1.5% were dispensed potentially hazardous interacting drug pairs. For patients dispensed cyclosporin, concomitant use of a statin was common (47%); as was statin use with those dispensed itraconazole (31%). Of those dispensed methotrexate, 24% also received a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug; of those on lithium, 18% also received an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin 2 receptor blocker; of those on warfarin, 7.2% and 5.9% were co-dispensed an non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or antiplatelets respectively; for those on verapamil, 5.3% were co-dispensed a beta-blocker, while for those on amiodarone 6.2% were co-dispensed digoxin. CONCLUSIONS Overall prevalence of potentially serious drug interactions appears to be low in the Australian veteran population. However, patients taking cyclosporine, itraconazole, methotrexate, lithium, warfarin, verapamil and amiodarone appear to be most at risk and their medicine use should be regularly reviewed to prevent potentially hazardous drug interactions.", 
    "18": "In the general population, dyslipidemia is an established independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. In patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), comorbid cardiovascular disease is present at alarming rates, and those who require hemodialysis and have cardiovascular disease continue to have a high mortality rate. Lipid abnormalities associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD) vary depending on the stage of disease (stages 1-5), but low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) has been established as the primary lipid treatment target. Guidelines support an LDL level of less than 100 mg/dl in patients with all stages of CKD, except when the triglyceride level is above 500 mg/dl. As patients progress to stage 5 CKD (ESRD with hemodialysis), the high triglyceride, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and increased lipoprotein(a) levels of the early stages become more pronounced, with increases in small dense LDL particles; however, total cholesterol and LDL values remain normal or decrease. In patients undergoing hemodialysis, lipid abnormalities are driven by an increase in hepatic secretion and delayed catabolism of very low-density lipoproteins, as well as a reduction in lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase. Epidemiologic data support the role of cholesterol lowering as a means to lower cardiovascular events in the hemodialysis population. We conducted a literature search of various databases (1966-September 2009) to identify relevant clinical trials that evaluated the efficacy and safety of multiple lipid-lowering agents for the treatment of dyslipidemia in patients with ESRD requiring hemodialysis. Only those trials that used clinical primary end points of coronary heart disease (e.g., cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke) were included in this review. Evidence demonstrates that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin) therapy (i.e., atorvastatin and rosuvastatin) significantly reduces surrogate cardiovascular markers, particularly LDL, in patients with ESRD requiring hemodialysis; however, no statin has proved to reduce cardiovascular morbidity or mortality in this population. Trials evaluating omega-3 fatty acids did not show significant reductions in LDL or cardiovascular events in this population. Clinicians should appreciate these limitations when deciding whether to continue lipid-lowering pharmacotherapy in these patients, depending on their overall cardiovascular risk assessment.",

Histology was evaluated by light microscopy with immunohistochemistry for p53, p53-upregulated modulation of apoptosis (PUMA), and terminal deoxynucleotide transferase dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) staining. CP induced renal tubular damage with a higher MDA level, increased PUMA expression, p53- and TUNEL-positive cells counts, elevation of serum lipids, and decreased GSH level, GPx mRNA expression, and activity. Pravastatin partially ameliorated CP-induced renal injury, based on suppression of the renal MDA and TG levels, decreased p53 expression, and apoptosis in CP-treated rats. These findings suggest that pravastatin has a partial protective effect against CP nephrotoxicity via antioxidant activity as well as attenuation of the p53 response, and lipid-lowering effects.",

The influence of ISDs on the development and progression of CAV is complex. In spite of their high potency to suppress the alloimmune response (prevention of allograft rejection) which plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of CAV, the immunosuppressive regimens which were used in the past were not able to entirely prevent the development of CAV. This can be explained by the fact that several non-alloimmune insults such as brain death, organ preservation, surgical trauma, ischemia-reperfusion, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cytomegalovirus infection etc. are also involved in the development or progression of CAV. Some of these insults are not affected by immunosuppression, whereas others can be even aggravated by certain ISDs, particularly by calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs), but also by glucocorticosteroids and proliferation signal inhibitors (PSIs). Certain ISDs, especially CNIs, also have direct toxic effects on vascular endothelial and smooth muscle cells inducing endothelial dysfunction and proliferation of both smooth muscle cells and fibroblasts which promotes the development and progression of CAV. Other ISDs like PSIs and mycophenolate mofetil appeared able to delay the onset of CAV and reduce its progression, especially by their inhibitory effects on smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation.

    "73": "Statins have pleiotropic actions against the development of vascular remodeling and the incidence of ischemic stroke. Although previous studies have suggested that posttranslational modification of several proteins, such as Rho by mevalonate-derived isoprene groups, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate or farnesyl pyrophosphate, underlie the pleiotropic effects of statins, the detailed mechanisms remain elusive. Recent growing evidence demonstrated that ClC-3 volume-regulated chloride channel plays an important role in cell proliferation, and the activity of this channel is increased in basilar smooth muscle cells from a hypertensive rat. We hypothesized that inhibition of volume-regulated chloride channel may contribute to the beneficial effects of statins on cerebrovascular remodeling during hypertension. Our study here demonstrated that simvastatin ameliorated hypertension-caused cerebrovascular remodeling. In rat basilar smooth muscle cells, simvastatin inhibited cell proliferation and activation of volume-regulated chloride channel, and these effects of simvastatin were abolished by pretreatment with mevalonate or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. In addition, Rho A inhibitor C3 exoenzyme and Rho kinase inhibitor Y-27632 both reduced cell proliferation and activation of volume-regulated chloride channel. Moreover, ClC-3 overexpression decreased the suppressive effect of simvastatin on cell proliferation and increased estimated IC(50) of simvastatin on endothelin 1- and hypo-osmolarity-induced cell proliferation from 3.40+/-0.08 and 3.50+/-0.10 micromol/L to 5.30+/-0.70 and 5.60+/-0.70 micromol/L, respectively (P<0.01; n=6). Furthermore, the expression of ClC-3 was increased in basilar artery during hypertension, and simvastatin normalized the upregulation of ClC-3. Our data suggested that simvastatin ameliorates cerebrovascular remodeling in the hypertensive rat through inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation by suppression of volume-regulated chloride channel.", 
    "74": "Previous studies have demonstrated that benefits of intensive statin therapy compared to standard statin therapy begin shortly after an acute event and are continued up to 2 years of follow-up. However, whether efficacy and safety of intensive statin therapy in patients with a recent cardiac event are maintained in longer-term follow-up has not been evaluated. We conducted a post hoc analysis of a subgroup of 999 patients who had a first acute myocardial infarction (MI) <2 months before randomization in a prospective, open-label, blinded end-point evaluation trial of 8,888 patients with a history of MI that compared intensive statin therapy (atorvastatin 80 mg) to standard statin therapy (simvastatin 20 to 40 mg) over approximately 5 years of follow-up. We analyzed the same composite end point used in the Pravastatin or Atorvastatin Evaluation and Infection Therapy (PROVE IT) trial (death, MI, hospitalization for unstable angina, revascularization, and stroke). Rates of the composite end point were 44.7% (n = 226) in the simvastatin group and 37.9% (n = 187) in the atorvastatin group (hazard ratio 0.82, 95% confidence interval 0.67 to 0.99, p = 0.04). Although statistical power was smaller than that of the PROVE IT trial, the relative risk decrease observed at 5 years is consistent with that in the 2-year follow-up in PROVE IT. The 2 treatment regimens were well tolerated. In conclusion, our analysis provides support for the strategy of placing patients with recent MI on intensive statin therapy and maintaining the high dose over the long term, beyond 2 years.", 
    "75": "The risk of cardiovascular disease is inversely correlated to level of plasma HDL-c. Moreover, reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) from peripheral tissues to the liver is the most widely accepted mechanism linked to the anti-atherosclerotic activity of HDL. The apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I) and the ABC transporters play a key role in this process.Adipose tissue constitutes the body's largest pool of free cholesterol. The adipose cell could therefore be regarded as a key factor in cholesterol homeostasis. The present study investigates the capacity of primary cultures of mature human adipocytes to release cholesterol and explores the relationships between apoA-I, ABCA1, and apoE as well as the signaling pathways that could be potentially involved.", 
    "76": "We demonstrate that apoA-I induces a strong increase in cholesterol release and apoE secretion from adipocytes, whereas it has no transcriptional effect on ABCA1 or apoE genes. Furthermore, brefeldin A (BFA), an intracellular trafficking inhibitor, reduces basal cholesterol and apoE secretion, but does not modify induction by apoA-I. The use of statins also demonstrates that apoA-I stimulated cholesterol release is independent of HMG-CoA reductase activation.",

The aim of this study was to conduct a meta analysis evaluating the effect of statin use on maintenance of NSR after ECV of persistent AF. Randomised controlled trials evaluating the use of statins to maintain NSR after ECV of AF were identified through a systematic search including Medline (1950 through December 2009), the Cochrane CENTRAL Register (4th quarter, 2009) and a manual review of references without any language restrictions. Pooled estimates of effect are reported as relative risks (RRs) with accompanying 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using a random-effects model. Four trials (n = 424; range: 48-212) were identified and subject to meta analysis. Evaluated statins included atorvastatin 10 and 80 mg and pravastatin 40 mg/day. Over a mean of 2.1 months (range: 1-3 months) statins did not increase the likelihood of maintaining NSR following ECV (RR, 1.12; 95%CI, 0.85-1.46) compared with control.

Case reports and limited controlled data suggest that commonly prescribed drugs may be triggers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of selected medication use [Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), and Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)] in patients with MC compared to 'random controls' and 'diarrhea controls.' METHODS: All patients were selected from primary care practices of a university health system during 2002 to 2007. Patients with biopsy proven lymphocytic or collagenous colitis were identified as cases. Diarrhea controls consisted of a 10:1 random sample of patients with chronic diarrhea and normal colon biopsies. Ten random controls were matched to each case on sex and index date (date of biopsy proven diagnosis). Drugs prescribed within the year prior to the index date were collected from the electronic medical record system. RESULTS: 26 cases (median age 68.9 yrs), 259 random, and 259 diarrhea controls were identified. The adjusted ORs for PPI, SSRI, and statin prescription within 12 months of diagnosis of MC between cases and diarrhea controls were 0.28 (0.07-1.07), 0.87 (0.28-2.64), 1.12 (0.34-3.71) respectively. Use of PPI and statins was less common in MC patients than in random controls (p<0.05 for both comparisons).

Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease. Lp-PLA2 is recognized as a risk marker in primary or secondary prevention of atherosclerosis. Elevated Lp-PLA2 levels are associated with the increased risk for cardiovascular events, even after multivariable adjustment for traditional risk factors. Patients with dyslipidemia are shown to benefit largely from the modification of Lp-PLA2. The degree of coronary artery disease (0-, 1-, 2-, or 3-vessel disease) and plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol significantly correlated to Lp-PLA2 levels. The low biologic fluctuation and high vascular specificity of Lp-PLA2 make it possible to use a single measurement in clinical decision making, and it also permits clinicians to follow the Lp-PLA2 marker serially. Simvastatin significantly reduces macrophage content, lipid retention, and the intima to media ratio but increased the content of smooth muscle cells in atherosclerotic lesions. Statin treatment markedly reduced Lp-PLA2 in both plasma and atherosclerotic plaques with attenuation of the local inflammatory response and improved plaque stability due to reduced inflammation and decreased apoptosis of macrophages. Darapladib, an inhibitor of Lp-PLA2 when added to lipid-lowering therapy such as statins, offers great benefit in the reduction of plaque formation. This article explores the atherosclerotic process at molecular level, role of Lp-PLA2 in atherosclerosis, the effect of lipid-lowering drugs on Lp-PLA2, effect of direct Lp-PLA2 inhibitor darapladib in the atherosclerosis process, the therapeutic implications of Lp-PLA2 as risk marker, and finally the net effect on plaque stabilization.",

Ezetimibe represents a new class of hypolipidemic drugs that inhibit cholesterol absorption in the small intestine. The combination of ezetimibe with statins has been more effective than monotherapy alone in many randomized trials. LDL cholesterol reduction with statin occurs mainly with the initial dose, with relatively smaller reductions seen at higher doses. Ezetimibe was also shown to be useful in various population subgroups such as African-Americans, men and women, elderly and aged, and also those with kidney disease.

Results were compared between the groups. The effect of 8 weeks of HD and high-volume predilution hemodiafiltration (HDF) was compared in a randomized study. HD patients showed higher ADMA (1.20 [0.90-1.39 micromol/L]) compared to controls (0.89 [0.77-0.98], P < 0.01), while ADMA in PD did not differ from controls (0.96 [0.88-1.28]). AGE and homocysteine were highest in HD, lower in PD (P < 0.01 vs. HD), and lowest in controls (P < 0.001 vs. HD and PD). PD patients had higher residual renal function than HD (P < 0.01). The decrease in ADMA at the end of HD (from 1.25 [0.97-1.33] to 0.66 [0.57-0.73], P < 0.001) was comparable to that of HDF. Switching from HD to HDF led to a decrease in predialysis homocysteine level in 8 weeks (P < 0.05), while ADMA and AGE did not change. Increased ADMA levels in patients undergoing HD, as compared to PD, may be caused by higher oxidative stress and lower residual renal function in HD. Other factors, such as diabetes and statin therapy, may also be at play. The decrease in ADMA at the end of HD and HDF is comparable. Switching from HD to HDF decreases in 8 weeks the predialysis levels of homocysteine without affecting ADMA.",

Neither is there a consensus on the efficacy of statins in treating the aforementioned diseases nor are the mechanisms of the purported statin-induced neuroprotection well-understood. Part of the support for statin-induced neuroprotection comes from studies using animal models and cell culture. Important information has resulted from that work but there continues to be a lack of progress on basic issues pertaining to statins and brain that impedes advancement in understanding how statins alter brain function. For example, there are scant data on the pharmacokinetics of lipophilic and hydrophilic statins in brain, statin-induced neuroprotection versus cell death, and statins and brain isoprenoids. The purpose of this mini-review will be to examine those aforementioned issues and to identify directions of future research.", 
    "134": "Background. Cardiovascular disease is the principal cause of mortality in older individuals, and more than 80% of deaths due to coronary heart disease or stroke occur in patients over 65 years of age. Hyperlipidemia is one of the main modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Current guidelines recommend the use of statins to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol to appropriate targets based on an individual's cardiovascular risk, and clearly state that older age should not be a barrier to treatment. Despite extensive evidence demonstrating clear benefit with statin therapy in older individuals, this population remains chronically undertreated. Scope. This paper provides an overview of the current evidence available regarding the efficacy and safety of statin therapy to reduce cardiovascular risk in older patients. We use hypothetical case studies to address some of the questions frequently posed by physicians responsible for the cardiovascular health of older patients. Conclusions. Various factors may account for the failure to provide appropriate treatment, including a lack of awareness of clinical benefits and perceived safety issues. However, if current guidelines are followed and older patients treated to appropriate LDL-C goals, the likelihood of cardiovascular events will be reduced in this high-risk population. Employing an evidence-based approach to the management of cardiovascular risk in older patients is likely to yield benefits in terms of overall cardiovascular burden.",

Recent evidence, however, points to cortisol rather than aldosterone as the hormone activating cardiac mineralocorticoid receptors, under conditions of tissue damage, and spironolactone as acting by mechanisms other than receptor blockade. ILLUMINATE compared the effects of torcetrapib, a cholesterol ester transport protein inhibitor, in combination with atorvastatin vs. atorvastatin alone, and was terminated after excess mortality was found in the torcetrapib arm. Subjects receiving torcetrapib showed effects consistent with increased aldosterone secretion, subsequently confirmed on patient samples and in vitro. In animal experiments, the pressor effect of torcetrapib was abolished by adrenalectomy but not by administration of trilostane, an inhibitor of aldosterone secretion. Although aldosterone (and probably cortisol) excess is involved in the off-target effects of torcetrapib, they may also involve secretion of endogenous oubain from the adrenal glomerulosa. This possibility may explain the enigma of aldosterone being homeostatic in chronic sodium deficiency, but deleterious in the presence of inappropriate sodium levels.",

Statins also have pleiotropic effects, independent of cholesterol-lowering effects, including induction of apoptosis in various cell lines. However, the mechanism underlying statin-induced apoptosis is still not fully understood. This study aims to explore the proapoptotic effects and underlying mechanisms of statins on human salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma (SACC). Exposure of SACC cells to mevastatin resulted in cell growth inhibition and apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner, accompanied by the release of cytochrome c and cleavage of caspase-3. A remarkable decrease in phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and increase in phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated kinase were observed. Furthermore, the JNK-specific inhibitor SP600125, but not the p38-specific inhibitor SB203580, abolished mevastatin-induced cell growth inhibition and apoptosis in SACC cells. This was supported by results in which the JNK inhibitor efficiently blocked mevastatin-induced JNK phosphorylation, but not p38 phosphorylation, and further decreased mevastatin-induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Taken together, the results suggest that the JNK pathway was required for mevastatin-induced cell growth inhibition and apoptosis in SACC cells.

We investigated the effect of statins on mesangial cell hypocontractility and identified candidate proteins and filamentous/globular (F/G)-actin involved in this process. A high-glucose-induced mouse mesangial cell hypocontractility model was treated with fungal statins, simvastatin (Sim), lovastatin (Lov), and pravastatin (Pra). The optimum statin dose was determined by an 3-(4,5-Dimethylthiazol-2-Yl)-2,5-Diphenyltetrazolium Bromide (MTT) assay and then applied to a cell model. A 2-dimensional gel/matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer analysis was used to evaluate protein expression cells incubated in the presence of a normal level of glucose (N), a high level of glucose (H), and a high level of glucose plus Sim (H + S). Candidate proteins were analyzed. Finally, the ratio of F/G actin in groups N, H, and H+S was evaluated. The MTT assay showed that Sim and Lov exerted dose- and time-related inhibition of proliferation of mesangial cells at N, but Pra had no effect. The optimum doses selected for Sim was 1 microM and for Lov was 3 microM, which were 1 increment before significant proliferation inhibition. Both doses reversed cell hypocontractility significantly, but Sim was chosen for further proteomic and F/G actin analyses. Proteomic analysis of groups N, H, and H + S showed that 18 proteins were involved in hypocontractility. These proteins were grouped and analyzed based on their known functions. Two selected proteins, TCP-1beta and GRP78, that were upregulated and downregulated, respectively, were confirmed by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. In regard to the F/G actin, group H had a significantly lower ratio than that of group N, and group H + S returned to a level similar to that of group N. In conclusion, Sim and Lov both seem to reverse mesangial cell hypocontractility. The process of Sim reversal of mesangial cell hypocontractility may involve F-actin, TCP-1beta, and GRP78.",

Significant changes in mean LDL cholesterol from baseline (127.9+/-49.3 vs posttreatment 65.2+/-32.1 mg/dL; P<.001) were also observed. However, regression analysis revealed only a weak positive relationship between changes in LDL cholesterol and Lp-PLA(2) mass (R(2)=0.29; P<.01). Thus, Lp-PLA(2) mass is significantly reduced with lifestyle and combination lipid therapy. Changes in Lp-PLA(2) were only partially explained by the changes observed for LDL cholesterol.", 
    "171": "Hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors or statins are the most effective medications for reducing elevated concentrations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Statins reduce cardiac events in patients with coronary artery disease and previously healthy persons. Current recommendations for LDL-C treatment goals indicate that more patients will be treated with higher doses of these medications. Statins have been extremely well-tolerated in controlled clinical trials but are increasingly recognized to produce skeletal muscle myalgia, cramps, and weakness. The reported frequency of such mild symptoms is not clear, and muscle performance has not been examined with these medications. Accordingly, the present investigation, the Effect of Statins on Skeletal Muscle Function and Performance (STOMP) study, will recruit approximately 440 healthy persons. Participants will be randomly assigned to treatment with atorvastatin 80 mg/d or placebo. Handgrip, elbow and knee isometric and isokinetic strength, knee extensor endurance, and maximal aerobic exercise performance will be determined at baseline. Participants will undergo repeat testing after 6 months of treatment or after meeting the study definition of statin myalgia. This study will determine the effect of statins on skeletal muscle strength, endurance, and aerobic exercise performance and may ultimately help clinicians better evaluate statin-related muscle and exercise complaints.", 
    "172": "Recent studies support the notion that statins, widely prescribed cholesterol-lowering agents, may target key elements in the immunological cascade leading to inflammation and tissue damage in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS). Compelling experimental and observational clinical studies highlighted the possibility that statins may also exert immunomodulatory synergy with approved MS drugs, resulting in several randomized clinical trials testing statins in combination with interferon-beta (IFN-\u03b2). Some data, however, suggest that this particular combination may not be clinically beneficial, and might actually have a negative effect on the disease course in some patients with MS. In this regard, a small North American trial indicated that atorvastatin administered in combination with IFN-\u03b2 may increase disease activity in relapsing-remitting MS. Although other trials did not confirm this finding, the enthusiasm for studies with statins dwindled. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the completed clinical trials and reports of the interim analyses evaluating the combination of IFN-\u03b2 and statins in MS. Moreover, we try to address the evident question whether usage of this combination routinely requires caution, since the number of IFN-\u03b2-treated MS patients receiving statins for lowering of cholesterol is expected to grow.", 
    "173": "This post hoc analysis compared the effects of switching to ezetimibe/simvastatin 10/20 mg (EZE/SIMVA) or rosuvastatin 10 mg (ROSUVA) in uncontrolled high-risk hypercholesterolemic patients with/without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) despite statin monotherapy.", 
    "174": "Patients (n = 618) at high risk for coronary vascular disease with elevated LDL-C \u2265100 and \u2264190 mg/dL despite use of statins were randomized 1:1 to double-blind EZE/SIMVA 10/20 mg or ROSUVA 10 mg for 6 weeks. Patients were classified as having T2DM based on \u22651 of the following: diagnosis of T2DM, antidiabetic medication, or FPG \u2265126 mg/dL. This analysis evaluated percent changes from baseline in lipids among patients with (n = 182) and without T2DM (n = 434).", 
    "175": "EZE/SIMVA was more effective than ROSUVA at lowering LDL-C, TC, non-HDL-C, and apo B in the overall study population and within both subgroups. Numerically, greater between-treatment reductions in LDL-C, TC, non-HDL-C, and apo B were seen in patients with T2DM versus those without T2DM. A significant interaction (P= 0.015) was seen for LDL-C indicating that patients with T2DM achieved larger between-group reductions versus those without T2DM.",

    "177": "The long-term success of arthroplastic joints is dependent on the stabilization of the implant within the skeletal site. Movement of the arthroplastic implant within the bone can stimulate osteolysis, and therefore methods which promote rigid fixation or bone growth are expected to enhance implant stability and the long-term success of joint arthroplasty. In the present study, we used a simple bilateral bone defect model to analyze the osteogenic activity of three small-molecule drug implants via microcomputerized tomography (micro-CT) and histomorphometry. In this study, we show that local delivery of alendronate, but not lovastatin or omeprazole, led to significant new bone formation at the defect site. Since alendronate impedes osteoclast-development, it is theorized that alendronate treatment results in a net increase in bone formation by preventing osteoclast mediated remodeling of the newly formed bone and upregulating osteoblasts.", 
    "178": "Genetic loci predict <5% of variation in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) response to statins. Cholestanol and desmosterol are plasma markers of cholesterol absorption and synthesis, respectively. Because statins lower LDL-C by inhibiting cholesterol synthesis, we studied the relationship between cholestanol and desmosterol and LDL-C response to atorvastatin.", 
    "179": "High-risk patients were treated with 80 mg of atorvastatin for 6 weeks. LDL-C response to atorvastatin was related to baseline cholestanol to cholesterol ratio (CCR) and desmosterol. The following comparisons were used: (1) correlates of percentage LDL-C response, (2) baseline characteristics of hyperresponders versus hyporesponders, and (3) binary logistic regression analysis for predictors of achieved LDL-C <70 mg/dL.", 
    "180": "One hundred fifty-four patients were enrolled of which 118 completed the study with adequate adherence. Average LDL-C reduction was 57% \u00b1 13% (mean \u00b1 SD). On univariate analysis, desmosterol and CCR correlated with percentage LDL-C reduction and multivariate modeling explained approximately 16% of the variation in response. Atorvastatin hyperresponders had higher mean desmosterol (P = 0.046) and lower CCR (P = 0.035) than hyporesponders. On logistic regression analysis for the outcome of achieved LDL-C of <70 mg/dL, baseline LDL-C and CCR were significant predictors; odds ratios were 0.932 and 0.979, respectively.", 
    "181": "CCR and desmosterol explain more variation in LDL-C response to statin than that reported with pharmacogenomics. CCR and desmosterol may guide lipid-lowering therapy.", 
    "182": "To review the recent evidence of the effectiveness of statin therapy in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease in men and women without established cardiovascular disease (CVD).", 
    "183": "The use of statins in patients without established CVD has important public health implications. Until recently, research has provided ambiguous answers and the reliability of treatment in older people (>65 years), women, and patients with diabetes has remained uncertain, mainly because of a lack of data or inconsistent findings within these clinically defined groups. The Justification for the use of Statins in Primary Prevention: an Intervention Trial Evaluating Rosuvastatin (JUPITER) demonstrated a significant benefit of rosuvastatin in low-risk patients with no apparent vascular disease, low-density lipoprotein levels of less than 3.4 mmol/l, and elevated high sensitivity C-reactive protein. The latest meta-analysis of statins in 70 000 patients without established CVD confirmed the overall benefit of statins in these low-risk patients and found no significant heterogeneity of the treatment effect in the clinically defined subgroups of elderly (>65 years), women, and patients with diabetes.", 
    "184": "The use of statins in low-risk patients without CVD remains a matter of intense debate, even following the latest findings from the JUPITER. Statins reduce cardiovascular risk and mortality in this patient category. However, the overall absolute risk reductions and cost-effectiveness of long-term statin prescription should be kept in mind before prescribing statins to relatively healthy individuals. The exact threshold of baseline risk of CVD has not been determined yet and is a challenge for emerging treatment guidelines in primary prevention.", 
    "185": "To summarize recent studies on combination regimens that employ a statin with added niacin, ezetimibe, and/or bile acid sequestrants, and to understand the implications of these studies for clinical practice.", 
    "186": "Combinations of statin, niacin, and/or intestinally active LDL-lowering drug have demonstrated safety and favorable effects on plasma low and high-density lipoproteins. Niacin and bile acid sequestrants appear to exert beneficial effects on atherosclerotic lesions, whereas results with ezetimibe are uncertain. Moreover, the use of niacin and bile acid sequestrants is supported by clinical outcome results from large monotherapy trials and small combination therapy trials. Three large randomized trials currently are evaluating clinical outcomes with the addition of niacin or ezetimibe to statin treatment.", 
    "187": "Until the results of ongoing trials are known, it is reasonable to favor the use of niacin and bile acid sequestrants in combination with statins, based on safety and efficacy with regard to effects on lipoproteins, atherosclerotic lesions, and, to a limited extent, clinical outcomes. The effect of ezetimibe on carotid atherosclerosis is indeterminate, but ezetimibe can be reasonably added to statin therapy as a secondary option for LDL-lowering.", 
    "188": "New data have emerged over the last few years about the role of fibrates in treatment of microvascular and macrovascular disease.", 
    "189": "Endpoint studies have been conducted with fibrates in coronary heart disease since 1971 and results have been contradictory. Fibrates have shown benefits in patients with low HDL-cholesterol and low LDL-cholesterol. Fibrates remain topical, given their actions on the lipid triad present in the metabolic syndrome and in diabetes. In the Fenofibrate Intervention in Endpoint Lowering in Diabetes study of mixed primary and secondary prevention cohorts, fenofibrate therapy resulted in an 11% reduction in coronary or cardiovascular events in monotherapy. Despite frequent use, there was little endpoint data on fibrate-statin combination therapy until recently. The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes trial of fenofibrate added to baseline simvastatin therapy in diabetes showed a nonsignificant 8% reduction in cardiovascular events. The benefits were concentrated in men, and women did slightly worse with fibrate therapy. In post-hoc analysis, slight beneficial effects of fenofibrate were seen in patients with moderate hypertriglyceridaemia (>2.3 mmol/l) and low HDL-cholesterol (<0.88 mmol/l). The safety profile of fibrate-simvastatin combination was good.", 
    "190": "Fenofibrate and bezafibrate are reasonable second-line therapies for dyslipidaemia and in diabetes. They are safe in combination therapy with statins but add little endpoint benefit except possibly in patients with a significant degree of atherogenic dyslipidaemia (high triglycerides and low HDL-cholesterol). The benefits of fibrates on microvascular disease remain to be fully explored.", 
    "191": "This study explored the clinical significance of CD34(+)/133(+) circulating progenitor cell (CPC) counts in patients with stable angina pectoris (AP) who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).", 
    "192": "Subjects comprised 52 patients with stable AP requiring PCI and 50 control patients without AP. In the AP group, blood samples were taken before and 20 min and 24 h after PCI to measure CPC counts by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. The baseline number of CPCs was smaller in the AP group than in controls. In the AP group, body mass index (BMI) correlated positively with the baseline number of CPCs and was an independent predictor of CPC count in multivariate regression analysis. Other conventional risk factors, daily exercise activity and statin administration showed no association with CPC count. CPC counts remained unchanged within 24 h after PCI.", 
    "193": "CPC counts in patients with AP are influenced by BMI, but not by other coronary risk factors. CPC counts remain unchanged within 24 h after PCI.", 
    "194": "Few studies have serially monitored the change of coronary plaque after statin therapy using multiple plaque imaging modalities.", 
    "195": "A prospective open-label trial was performed to assess coronary plaque regression and stabilization following 52 weeks of pitavastatin treatment (2 mg/day). Coronary segments that included the most diseased plaque of 90 patients determined on angioscopy were analyzed using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). The yellow grade of each plaque of 46 patients who had matched angioscopy and IVUS data was evaluated on angioscopy. Low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) was reduced 34.5% (145.0+/-24.0 mg/dl to 93.6+/-22.6 mg/dl, P<0.001), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased 17.8% (44.9+/-11.1 mg/dl to 51.9+/-11.7 mg/dl, P<0.001). Yellow grade decreased (2.9+/-0.8 to 2.6+/-0.7, P=0.040) during 52 weeks. The reduction of yellow grade was not correlated with the LDL-C level at 52 weeks or its change. The change of yellow grade was inversely correlated with maximum yellow grade at baseline. Percent atheroma volume on IVUS did not change during 52 weeks, but its change for 52 weeks was significantly correlated with LDL-C level at 52 weeks (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient 0.312, P=0.035).", 
    "196": "Fixed dose pitavastatin stabilized vulnerable coronary plaques by the reduction of yellow grade without significant reduction of plaque volume. The stabilization and regression of atherosclerotic plaques by statin may differ, but both nonetheless contribute to the reduction of cardiovascular events (UMIN Clinical Trials Registry UMIN000001107).", 
    "197": "The preventative effect of statins on postoperative atrial fibrillation has been hypothesized. However, all studies to date have examined patients who did not receive statins before their further allocation to treatment or no treatment. Because guidelines recommend the routine use of statins in patients with coronary artery disease, we set out to examine the effect of intensive statin pretreatment versus continuation of usual statin dose on atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery.",

The primary end point was the development of postoperative atrial fibrillation during hospital stay.", 
    "199": "A total of 104 consecutive patients were included. Postoperative atrial fibrillation occurred in 33 patients (32.4%). No significant differences were found in demographics, medical history, or intraoperative variables between treatment groups, with the exception of higher rate of \u03b2-blocker use in the atorvastatin 10 mg group (75% vs 53%, P = .002) and previous myocardial infarction (62% vs 42%, P = .049). The incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation was lower in the atorvastatin 80 mg group when compared with the atorvastatin 10 mg group, but this difference did not reach statistical significance (29% vs 36%, P = .43).", 
    "200": "High-dose atorvastatin for 7 days before cardiac surgery conferred a nonsignificant reduction in postoperative atrial fibrillation when compared with a low-dose regimen. A larger study would be necessary to confirm the beneficial effect of high-dose statins in this setting.", 
    "201": "Mixed dyslipidemia is a complex clinical entity that contributes significantly to the increased risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality that is observed in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Insulin resistance is associated with reduced serum lipoprotein lipase activity, increased serum levels of very low-density lipoproteins and triglyceride, low serum high-density lipoproteins, and increased concentrations of small, dense low-density lipoproteins. Combinations of medications are frequently required in order to achieve guideline-specified goals for the various lipid fractions of diabetic patients. The fibric acid derivatives (fibrates) are effective agents for raising serum levels of high-density lipoproteins and decreasing levels of triglycerides. A number of trials have demonstrated that among patients with high triglycerides and low HDL, fibrates do beneficially impact cardiovascular morbidity in diabetic and nondiabetic individuals. The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) trial suggests that the addition of fenofibrate to ongoing statin therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus offers limited benefit.", 
    "202": "Premorbid statin use has been associated with decreased mortality in septic and trauma patients. This has been ascribed to the pleiotropic, anti-inflammatory effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. This association has not been investigated in burn victims.",
