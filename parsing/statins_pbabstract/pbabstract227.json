    "0": "High-density lipoprotein (HDL) is a \"regression particle\" based on its unique lipid particle biology. This unique property predicts that, in theory, therapies that raise HDL cholesterol should be able to induce regression of atherosclerosis. Presently, the principle pharmacotherapy for increasing HDL cholesterol is niacin. Niacin has been shown to regress atherosclerosis when used as monotherapy, in combination with a statin, and in combination with nonstatin therapies (including cholesterol-binding resins) and fibrates. Insights into the atherosclerosis benefits of combination lipid-lowering therapy with niacin have come from imaging studies utilizing quantitative coronary angiography, carotid ultrasound, and intravascular ultrasound showing modest inverse correlations between the extent of HDL increase and atherosclerosis regression. Recent adverse atherosclerosis and clinical effects seen with cholesterol ester transfer protein inhibition indicate that HDL-raising effects alone are insufficient to predict clinical benefit of new HDL therapies. Thus, although clinical trial evidence is necessary to understand the full scope of the safety and efficacy profile of novel HDL therapeutics, atherosclerosis imaging will be an important component of preclinical testing of these agents as they emerge and in head-to-head testing of treatment strategies.", 
    "1": "Niacin is the most potent lipid-altering agent for raising high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels. Niacin also lowers triglyceride (TG) levels, lowers low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, and improves lipoprotein particle size and subclass distribution. Niacin's major adverse experience (AE) is flushing. Niacin may also increase glucose levels, liver enzymes, and uric acid levels and cause other AEs that may have clinical relevance in selected patients. Simvastatin is representative of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin) class of lipid-altering drugs, which are the most effective agents for lowering LDL cholesterol levels and also have modest benefits in raising HDL cholesterol and lowering TG levels. The most common AEs with statins are muscle AEs and modest liver enzyme elevations. Because niacin and statins have complementary lipid effects and because individually, niacin and statins have been shown in outcomes studies to reduce atherosclerotic coronary artery disease events, the combined use of these 2 agents has significant potential to not only improve the lipid values of patients but improve their lives as well. Equally important is ensuring that the combination of niacin and simvastatin has an acceptable safety profile, with no greater AEs than would otherwise be expected by adding 1 agent to the other.", 
    "2": "Combination therapy for patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) is often indicated as a significant number of patients receiving 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (statin) therapy continue to have high residual risk. Combination drug therapy is also indicated for patients at high risk, including those with combined hyperlipidemia and dyslipidemia with diabetes mellitus. Effectively managing CAD and achieving optimal therapeutic targets, especially in patients at high risk, frequently requires the use of aggressive therapeutic interventions. In this article, the authors review the use of combination therapy as a strategy for risk reduction in CAD.", 
    "3": "Statins and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly prescribed for lowering cholesterol and anti-inflammation, respectively. Recently, their potential roles as cancer chemopreventive agents have been subject to intensive studies. Human trials have not provided conclusive results on the protective effects of statins against different cancers, while more convincing results have been observed for cancer preventive effects of NSAIDs, especially on colorectal cancer. A promising strategy to enhance the cancer preventive efficacy of statins and NSAIDs is to use them in combination, which may produce synergy and lower the dose required for each agent. This strategy is of particular interest for potential use of low doses of statins and NSAIDs on a long-term basis for cancer chemoprevention; increased risks for gastrointestinal and cardiovascular side effects associated with the use of NSAIDs have been observed in colorectal cancer chemopreventive trials. This article reviews the evidence for the cancer preventive actions of statins and NSAIDs, as well as their possible synergistic action and the mechanisms involved.",

For the pharmacological management of hypertension, treatment thresholds and targets should be predicated on by the patient's global atherosclerotic risk, target organ damage and comorbid conditions. Blood pressure should be decreased to lower than 140/90 mmHg in all patients, and to lower than 130/80 mmHg in those with diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease. Most patients will require more than one agent to achieve these target blood pressures. For adults without compelling indications for other agents, initial therapy should include thiazide diuretics. Other agents appropriate for first-line therapy for diastolic and/or systolic hypertension include angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (in nonblack patients), long-acting calcium channel blockers (CCBs), angiotensin receptor antagonists (ARBs) or beta-blockers (in those younger than 60 years of age). A combination of two first-line agents may also be considered for initial treatment of hypertension if systolic blood pressure is 20 mmHg above target or if diastolic blood pressure is 10 mmHg above target. Other agents appropriate for first-line therapy for isolated systolic hypertension include long-acting dihydropyridine CCBs or ARBs. In patients with angina, recent myocardial infarction or heart failure, beta-blockers and ACE inhibitors are recommended as first-line therapy; in patients with cerebrovascular disease, an ACE inhibitor/diuretic combination is preferred; in patients with proteinuric nondiabetic chronic kidney disease, ACE inhibitors are recommended; and in patients with diabetes mellitus, ACE inhibitors or ARBs (or, in patients without albuminuria, thiazides or dihydropyridine CCBs) are appropriate first-line therapies. All hypertensive patients with dyslipidemia should be treated using the thresholds, targets and agents outlined in the Canadian Cardiovascular Society position statement (recommendations for the diagnosis and treatment of dyslipidemia and prevention of cardiovascular disease). Selected high-risk patients with hypertension but who do not achieve thresholds for statin therapy according to the position paper should nonetheless receive statin therapy.

Changes in plasma PCSK9 following fenofibrate or gemfibrozil treatments (fibric acid derivatives) were inversely correlated with changes in LDLC levels (r = -0.558, p = 0.013). Atorvastatin administration (HMGCoA reductase inhibitor) significantly increased plasma PCSK9 (7.40%, p = 0.033) and these changes were inversely correlated with changes in LDLC levels (r = -0.393, p = 0.012). Immunoblot analyses of endogenous PCSK9 and LDLR expression by HepG2 cells in response to statins and fibrates showed that LDLR is more upregulated than PCSK9 by simvastatin (2.6x vs 1.5x, respectively at 10 muM), while fenofibrate did not induce changes in either.",

    "36": "In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the Angiopoietin 1 (Ang1)/Tie2 pathway mediates simvastatin-induced vascular integrity and migration of neuroblasts after stroke. Rats were subjected to 2 hrs of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) and treated, starting 1 day after stroke with or without simvastatin (1 mg/kg, daily) for 7 days. Simvastatin treatment significantly decreased blood-brain barrier (BBB) leakage and concomitantly, increased Ang1, Tie2 and Occludin expression in the ischaemic border (IBZ) compared to the MCAo control group. Simvastatin also significantly increased doublecortin (DCX, a marker of migrating neuroblasts) expression in the IBZ compared to control MCAo rats. DCX was highly expressed around vessels. To further investigate the signalling pathway of simvastatin-induced vascular stabilization and angiogenesis, rat brain microvascular endothelial cell (RBMEC) culture was employed. The data show that simvastatin treatment of RBMEC increased Ang1 and Tie2 gene and protein expression and promoted phosphorylated-Tie2 activity. Simvastatin significantly increased endothelial capillary tube formation, an index of angiogenesis, compared to non-treated control. Inhibition of Ang1 or knockdown of Tie2 gene expression in endothelial cells significantly attenuated simvastatin-induced capillary tube formation. In addition, simvastatin significantly increased subventricular zone (SVZ) explant cell migration compared to non-treatment control. Inhibition of Ang1 significantly attenuated simvastatin-induced SVZ cell migration. Simvastatin treatment of stroke increases Ang1/Tie2 expression and thereby reduces BBB leakage and promotes vascular stabilization. Ang1/Tie2 expression induced by simvastatin treatment promotes neuroblast micro-vascular coupling after stroke.", 
    "37": "Evidence has been accrued recently that chronic high levels of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) can be directly beneficial to the treatment of atherosclerotic vascular disorders thus making the substance a promising new therapeutic target. A therapeutic target can be theoretically each stage in the process of generation and elimination of asymmetric dimethylarginine. The methylation of L-arginine residues is a universal biological process involving hundreds of proteins but still with unknown effects. Interference with these mechanisms can generate ambiguous and speculative discussions. Supplementation with L-arginine seems to be the most natural way to reverse the detrimental effect of ADMA on the endothelium. The enzymatic activity of endogenous nitric oxide synthase is regulated by the ratio between the concentrations of L-arginine (the natural substrate) and that of ADMA (the endogenous inhibitor): in the presence of normal L-arginine levels, any elevation ofADMA levels may cause relative L-arginine deficiency thus attenuating the activity of the endogenous nitric oxide synthase. Target replacement therapy with L-arginine to increase the L-arginine plasma levels results in the normalisation of the L-arginine/ADMA ratio in the presence of higher levels of the latter. There is still some controversy about the effects of the most frequently used drugs on asymmetric dimethylarginine. Most of the relevant studies show that statins do not affect the ADMA levels. On the other hand, patients with high levels of ADMA are resistant to statin therapy--to improve the endothelium-dependent vasodilation they need a combined therapy with L-arginine. The angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and the angiotensin receptor blockers are the most extensively studied substances, the studies predominantly centring on confirming their ADMA reducing effect. Until the specific ADMA-reducing therapy becomes readily available, it is the therapies of modification of the risk factors causing the increase of ADMA or the depletion of L-arginine, and the L-arginine replacement therapy that are the most realistic therapeutic solutions for patients with high plasma levels of ADMA because the synthesis of nitric oxide correlates with the L-arginine/ADMA ratio. A study was conducted in the Surgery of Preventive Cardiology with the Clinic of Cardiology in Plovdiv which included 40 patients with pronounced hypercholesterolemia (HC)--it was found that a one-month therapy with 40 mg simvastatin did not change statistically significantly ADMA plasma levels in spite of the optimal lipid regulation.",

Rather than be swayed by popular opinion, we should each put the results of ENHANCE into context and ask the questions: should I put my trust in an imaging surrogate or in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (LDL-C), and how do the safety and efficacy of ezetimibe compare with other nonstatin lipid-lowering agents?",

    "43": "The present study aimed to assess the effects of a COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib, a HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, atorvastatin, and the association of both on monocrotaline (MC)-induced pulmonary hypertension in rats. Celecoxib (Cib, 25 mg kg(-1) day(-1)), atorvastatin (AS, 10 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) or vehicle, were given orally, separately or in combination, for 26 days to Wistar male rats injected or not with MC (60 mg/kg intraperitoneally). At 4 weeks, MC-injected rats developed a severe pulmonary hypertension, with an increase in lung to body weight ratio (L/BW), right ventricular pressure (RVP in mmHg, 31 +/- 3 and 14 +/- 1 for MC and control groups, respectively, P < 0.05) and right ventricle/left ventricle + septum weight ratio (RV/LV+S) associated with a decrease in acetylcholine- and sodium-nitroprusside-induced pulmonary artery vasodilation in vitro. Hypertensive pulmonary arteries exhibited an increase in wall thickness (wall thickness to external diameter ratio, 0.42 +/- 0.01 vs 0.24 +/- 0.01 for MC and control groups, respectively, P < 0.001). Whole lung eNOS expression was decreased, and an increase in apoptosis, evaluated by cleaved caspase-3 expression, was evidenced by Western blotting. Cib (RVP in mmHg, 19 +/- 3 and 31 +/- 3 for MC+Cib and MC groups, respectively, P < 0.05), but neither AS nor AS+Cib significantly limited the development of pulmonary hypertension (P < 0.05), although the three treatments exhibited protective effects against MC-induced lung and right ventricle hypertrophy evaluated by L/BW and RV/(LV+S) ratios, respectively (P < 0.05). AS, Cib and AS+Cib treatments reduced MC-induced thickening of small intrapulmonary artery wall (0.42 +/- 0.01, 0.24 +/- 0.01, 0.26 +/- 0.01 and 0.28 +/- 0.01 for MC, MC+AS, MC+Cib and MC+AS+Cib groups, respectively, P < 0.001). In control rats, Cib reduced acetylcholine-induced pulmonary artery vasorelaxation. Treatment of MC rats by either Cib or AS did not modify acetylcholine-induced pulmonary artery relaxation, whereas combination of both drugs significantly worsened it (P < 0.05). AS, but neither Cib nor the combination of both, prevented apoptosis (AS, P < 0.05) and partially restored eNOS expression (AS, P < 0.05) in whole lung of MC rats. In conclusion, celecoxib exhibited beneficial effects against the development of monocrotaline-induced pulmonary artery hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy. These beneficial effects of celecoxib might be, at least partly, explained by its effects on pulmonary artery thickening and pulmonary hypertrophy, even if it did not show any effect on pulmonary artery vasorelaxation and whole lung eNOS expression or apoptosis. The combination of celecoxib and atorvastatin was unable to prevent MC-induced pulmonary hypertension, decreased endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation and showed a trend toward an increased in RVP that deserves further studies.",

The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) released 2004 update to the Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III) guidelines. The new guidelines of European Society of Cardiology announced in 2007 support more intensive LDL-C lowering in patients at high risk of cardiovascular diseases. For patients at the highest risk of cardiovascular diseases (diabetic patients with coronary heart disease), the recommended LDL-C goal is <1.8 mmol/L. In very high-, high-, and moderately high-risk patients, statin therapy should be considered with a treatment targeting an LDL-C reduction of 30-40%. Clinical studies have shown that statin therapy alone is not always effective, especially in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia. Furthermore, high doses of statins can increase the possibility of adverse events. The combination of statins with intestinal cholesterol absorption inhibitors is more effective than statin monotherapy in LDL-C lowering and is well tolerated.",

Interestingly, simvastatin treatment induced PrP(Sc) accumulation in parallel with an induced neuroprotective effect. In accordance, we found that simvastatin induced immunomodulatory mechanisms in the brains of infected mice, affecting expression levels of specific microglial chemokines and cytokines.", 
    "58": "Simvastatin delays prion disease progression and increases survival in vivo, independently of the pathogenic conversion of PrP(C) to PrP(Sc). We show that simvastatin's effects on neuroprotection are correlated with downregulation of Cox2 levels and induction of microglial activation in prion-infected mouse brains.", 
    "59": "n-3 Fatty acids (FAs) when used in doses of 3-4 g/d eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid have profound effects on triacylglycerol (TG) concentrations. The mechanism for their TG reduction relates to their favorable effects on reducing hepatic production and secretion of VLDL and VLDL apolipoprotein B particles, along with favorable effects on plasma lipolytic activity through lipoprotein lipase-mediated clearance, as well as stimulation of beta-oxidation of other FAs in the liver. Their hypotriglyceridemic properties are related to both the dose of n-3 FAs used and the baseline TG concentrations of the population. In patients with TG concentrations >500 mg/dL, 4 g n-3 FAs have been shown to reduce TGs by 45%, VLDL by 42%, and non-HDL by 10.2%. A recent pooled meta-analysis with multiple doses of n-3 FAs ranging from 0.8 to 5.4 g revealed changes in TGs of -27 mg/dL (95% CI: -33, -20), in HDL of +1.6 mg/dL (95% CI: + 0.8, +2.3), and in LDL cholesterol of +6 mg/dL (95% CI: + 3, +8). The clinical uses of n-3 FAs include treatment of severe and moderate hypertriglyceridemia, use in statin-treated patients with elevated TG concentrations or non-HDL cholesterol (mixed hyperlipidemia), and use in the secondary and primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Existing large-scale clinical trials such as the GISSI-Prevenzione Study and JELIS with low doses of n-3 FAs (1-2 g) show clinical benefit in reducing coronary heart disease without substantial changes in concentrations of TGs or other lipids. Future clinical trials need to determine whether the TG-lowering doses of n-3 FAs (3-4 g/d) result in additional risk reduction.", 
    "60": "In cerebral adrenoleukodystrophy (cALD), an accumulation of very long chain fatty acids stems from a defect of the peroxisomal ALD protein (ALDP) and results in the loss of myelin/oligodendrocytes, induction of inflammatory disease and mental deterioration. In brain white matter of cALD patients, we observed not only increased levels of very long chain fatty acid but also reduced levels of plasmenylethanolamine (PlsEtn) and increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). The loss of PlsEtn was greatest in the plaque area and lesser but significant at histologically normal-looking areas of the cALD brain. The reduction in PlsEtn was related to oxidative stress, as supported by increased levels of reactive lipid aldehydes (4-hydroxynonenal and acrolein) and deleterious oxidized proteins (protein carbonyl) in all areas of the cALD brain. This inverse relationship between the levels of PlsEtn and reactive oxygen species (ROS) was further supported in an in vitro study using gene-silencing for dihydroxyacetone phosphate-acyl transferase, a key enzyme for PlsEtn biosynthesis. Levels of PlsEtn were also found decreased in vitro following gene-silencing for the ALDP/ALD-related protein. Furthermore, low levels of PlsEtn were detected in brain white matter of ALDP knock out (KO) mice. A treatment of ALDP KO mice with lovastatin increased PlsEtn levels in the brain. Further, in an in vitro study, lovastatin treatment of rat C6 glial cells increased PlsEtn biosynthesis and reduced the cytokine-induced ROS accumulation. In summary, this study reports that altered metabolism of PlsEtn and ROS in cALD may be corrected by lovastatin treatment.",

High resolution crystal structures, thermodynamic binding parameters, and biochemical data were used to design statin inhibitors with improved HMGR affinity and therapeutic index relative to statin-induced myalgia. These studies facilitated the identification of imidazole 1 as a potent (IC 50 = 7.9 nM) inhibitor with excellent hepatoselectivity (>1000-fold) and good in vivo efficacy. The binding of 1 to HMGR was found to be enthalpically driven with a Delta H of -17.7 kcal/M. Additionally, a second novel series of bicyclic pyrrole-based inhibitors was identified that induced order in a protein flap of HMGR. Similar ordering was detected in a substrate complex, but has not been reported in previous statin inhibitor complexes with HMGR.",

Mice with methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (Mthfr) deficiency, an animal model of hyperhomocysteinemia, were administered simvastatin (in diets or by injection) for in vivo assessment of these interactions. In HepG2 cells, Hcy reduced the statin-dependent increases in ApoA-I protein, mRNA, and ApoA-I promoter activity. In RAW264.7 macrophages, simvastatin decreased, whereas Hcy increased, the expression of pro-inflammatory NF-kappaB protein; in the presence of both Hcy and simvastatin, the pro-inflammatory effect of Hcy prevailed. Hcy increased mRNA levels of iNOS in the macrophage line; the combination of Hcy and simvastatin resulted in a trend towards greater induction. In mouse studies, simvastatin decreased cholesterol levels, but levels of ApoA-I in Mthfr-deficient mice remained lower than those in Mthfr(+/+) mice. Simvastatin injection increased iNOS protein and mRNA levels in peripheral blood of hyperhomocysteinemic Mthfr-deficient mice, but not in Mthfr(+/+) mice. The drug also increased MTHFR protein in cells and mouse liver, an effect that was modified by Hcy.",

This study conducted the cultivation of M. purpureus (ATCC 16365, BCC 6131, DMKU and FTCMU) and M. ruber TISTR 3006 on the adlay substrate for mevinolin, citrinin, pigments and glucosamine synthesis at room temperature (32-35 degrees C) for 28 days. The results elucidated that glucosamine levels expressed as the mold growth in solid-state fermentation corresponded as a relatively reliable indicator to the mevinolin, citrinin and pigments production. M. purpureus DMKU produced the lowest citrinin content of 0.26 ppm and the highest mevinolin content of 25.03 ppm with pigment concentrations expressed by absorbance at wavelengths of 400, 470 and 500 nm for yellow, orange and red pigments of 9.76, 3.03 and 3.43 units respectively and moisture content and pH of 83.51% and 6.54 respectively.

    "81": "Waldenstrom macroglobulinaemia (WM) is an incurable lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma with secretion of serum monoclonal immunoglobulin M (IgM). We previously showed that patients receiving cholesterol-lowering statins, had the lowest IgM value in a large cohort of patients with WM. Simvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitor, induced inhibition of proliferation, cytotoxic effect and apoptosis in IgM secreting cell lines as well as in primary CD19(+) WM cells. Interestingly, those effects were reversed by addition of mevalonate and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate, demonstrating that simvastatin inhibited cell growth, survival and IgM secretion on BCWM.1 WM cells by inhibition of geranylgeranylated proteins. Furthermore, simvastatin overcame tumour cell growth induced by co-culture of WM cells with bone-marrow stromal cells. Simvastatin also decreased IgM secretion by BCWM.1 cells at an early time-point that had not affected cell survival. Simvastatin-induced cytotoxicity was preceded by a decrease in Akt (protein kinase B, PKB) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways at 18 h. In addition, simvastatin induced an increase in stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) MAPK followed by caspase-8, -9, -3 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavages at 18 h, leading to apoptosis. Furthermore, simvastatin enhanced the cytotoxicity induced by bortezomib, fludarabine and dexamethasone. Our studies therefore support our earlier observation of statin-mediated anti-WM activity and provide the framework for future clinical trials testing simvastatin in WM.",

    "83": "The beneficial effects of statins in hypertension stem from their effects on endothelial function, their interactions with the renin-angiotensin system, and their influence on large artery compliance. Substantial evidence has recently accumulated showing that statins exert pleiotropic effects in vascular function. These include an increase in the synthesis of NO, inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration, anti-inflammatory actions, downregulation of angiotensin II type 1 receptor expression, and anti-oxidative effects. These effects occur before reduction of cholesterolemia. Available data support only a modest BP-lowering effect of statins which is most prominent in those patients with poorly controlled hypertension. Even though they only cause a minor reduction in BP, they may play a role in the prevention of cardiovascular disease. Statins may be useful therapeutic agents in hypertensives with high serum total cholesterol, in patients with poorly controlled hypertension even without hypercholesterolemia, in normocholesterolemic well-controlled hypertensive subjects with high C reactive protein levels, and in those subjects who need secondary prevention.

This review examines some of the recent patents taken out on biomarkers of cardiovascular risk, novel dietary supplements and new methods to treat cardiovascular disease. Though current approaches based on risk stratification into primary and secondary prevention and calculation of risk using simple risk factors are well established, there remains a need to develop more specific biomarkers of risk integrating many of the aspects of the atherosclerotic process including oxidized lipoproteins or inflammation-modified proteins. Diet is established as the mainstay of long-term cardiovascular management with great potential benefits but in the modern environment compliance tend to be low. Many approaches investigate the role of dietary supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids and other agents or the use of nutriceutical compounds capable of competing with cholesterol for absorption. A statin-based strategy is the mainstay of cardiovascular lipid -related risk management. However statins are not universally tolerable and are limited in the effects they have on some fractions of the risk profile especially low high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol. Many new drugs are in development to raise HDL or mimic its effects. These include novel agents to target nuclear factor receptors already familiar from previous successful drugs such as bile acid sequestrants, fibrates and thiazolidinediones as well as novel approaches investigating key regulatory enzymes such as stearoyl-CoA desaturase. Similarly as inflammation is a central part of atherosclerosis other novel approaches are targeting the multiplicity of inflammation-associated pathways including 5-lipoxygenase and purinergic receptors.",

ROCK has been incriminated in pathophysiologic events ranging from mediation of sustained abnormal vasoconstriction to promotion of vascular inflammation and remodelling. In addition, the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitors, statins, which inhibit activation of RhoA by preventing post-translational isoprenylation of the protein and its translocation to the plasma membrane ameliorate PH in several different rat models, and may also be effective in PH patients. Also, phosphorylation of RhoA and prevention of its translocation to the plasma membrane are involved in the protective effect of the type 5-PDE inhibitor, sildenafil, against hypoxia- and bleomycin-induced PH. Collectively, these and other observations indicate that independent of the cause of PH, activation of the RhoA/ROCK pathway serves as a point of convergence of various signalling cascades in the pathogenesis of the disease. We propose that ROCK inhibitors and other drugs that inhibit this pathway might be useful in the treatment of various forms of PH.",

    "110": "In type 2 diabetic patients rosuvastatin 20 mg not only induces a significant increase of LDL-ApoB catabolism (73%), but also has favourable effects on the catabolism of triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins, e.g. a significant increase in the catabolism of VLDL1-ApoB (48%), VLDL2-ApoB (63%) and IDL-ApoB (68%), and a reduction in the production rate of VLDL1-ApoB (-36%). The effects of rosuvastatin on the metabolism of triacylglycerol-rich lipoproteins may be beneficial for prevention of atherosclerosis in type 2 diabetic patients.", 
    "111": "Proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTEC) secrete chemokines under proteinuric conditions. Both statins and thiazolidinediones (TZDs) possess pleiotropic anti-inflammatory effects. This study examined the ability of statins and TZDs and the natural peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) agonist 15-deoxy-Delta(12,14)-prostaglandin J(2) (PGJ(2)) to attenuate the proteinuria-induced pro-inflammatory phenotype of PTEC.", 
    "112": "Mouse PTEC were treated with statins, TZDs and PGJ(2 )and effects on uptake and binding of FITC-albumin determined. PTEC were incubated with fatty acid free bovine serum albumin with or without statins/TZDs/PGJ(2), and the release of MCP-1 and RANTES measured.", 
    "113": "Statins and TZDs significantly inhibited PTEC albumin endocytosis. PGJ(2 )had no effect. Incubation of PTEC with albumin significantly stimulated production of MCP-1 and RANTES. Co-treatment with statins and PGJ(2) significantly reduced albumin-stimulated chemokine production, an effect reversed by the addition of mevalonate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. In contrast, TZDs had no effect on albumin-mediated chemokine production.", 
    "114": "Statins and PGJ(2), but not TZDs, prevent the development of a PTEC pro-inflammatory phenotype in response to albumin. Albumin endocytosis is not a prerequisite for PTEC chemokine production, and inhibition of albumin endocytosis alone is insufficient to attenuate chemokine production. These studies suggest a therapeutic role for statins and some PPARgamma ligands in proteinuric renal disease.", 
    "115": "Glutamate is an important excitatory amino acid in the central nervous system. Under pathological conditions glutamate levels dramatically increase. Aim of the present study was to examine whether the HMG-CoA inhibitor fluvastatin prevents glutamate-induced blood-brain-barrier (BBB) disruption. Measurements of transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) were performed to analyze BBB integrity in an in vitro co-culture model of brain endothelial and glial cells. Myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation was detected by immunohistochemistry, or using the in-cell western technique. Intracellular Ca2+ and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were analyzed using the fluorescence dyes Ca-green or DCF. Glutamate induced a time- (1-3 h) and concentration- (0.25-1 mmol/l) dependent decrease of TEER values that was blocked by the NMDA-receptor antagonist MK801, the Ca2+ chelator BAPTA, the NAD(P)H-oxidase inhibitor apocynin and the MLC-kinase inhibitor ML-7. Furthermore we observed a concentration-dependent increase of intracellular Ca2+ and ROS after glutamate application. Glutamate caused an increase of MLC phosphorylation that was antagonized by apocynin, or BAPTA, indicating that Ca2+ and ROS signaling is involved in the activation of the contractile machinery. Fluvastatin (10-25 micromol/l) completely abolished the glutamate-induced barrier disruption and oxidative stress. The BBB-protecting effect of fluvastatin was completely lost if the cells were treated with the nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor L-NMMA (300 micromol/l). In the present study we demonstrated that glutamate-induced BBB disruption involves Ca2+ signalling via NMDA receptors, which is followed by an increased ROS generation by the NAD(P)H-oxidase. This oxidative stress then activates the MLC kinase. Fluvastatin preserves barrier function in a NO-dependent way and reduces glutamate-induced oxidative stress.", 
    "116": "Our expectation is that the numbers of diagnosed small abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) will increase in the future. Slowing down the progression of AAAs is of great interest as this could prevent cost-intensive and potential lethal operations. Recent studies indicate that modern medical treatment such as prevention for cardiovascular disease has a spin-off benefit by suppressing the expansion rate of AAAs. According to these studies ACE inhibitors, statins and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may have effect, macrolides may have some effect while beta-blockers and calcium-channel blockers have no effect.", 
    "117": "In Hong Kong, about 10% of adults 25-74 years of age have diabetes mellitus. The management of dyslipidemia with lipid-lowering agents (LLAs), including HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) for the primary prevention of cardiovascular complications, has been found to be beneficial. This study examined statin utilization patterns for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with diabetes mellitus in two public hospitals in Kong Kong; clinical outcomes in patients who received statins for primary prevention were compared with those in patients not treated with any LLAs.", 
    "118": "This was a retrospective study in patients who were diagnosed with diabetes mellitus. Only patients with no prior history of coronary artery disease were included in the study. Utilization patterns of LLAs and the incidences of cardiovascular complications were recorded from 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2003.", 
    "119": "A total of 222 patient records were reviewed. Only 75/222 (33.8%) of patients with diabetes mellitus received one or more LLAs for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events. Among these patients, only 21% of patients attained target lipid goals. Nearly half of the patients who were not treated with LLAs (n=147) had dyslipidemia problems. The overall incidence of cardiovascular complications in patients treated and not treated with LLAs was 12.2%. Absence of routine screening for cardiovascular risk and sub-optimal utilization and inadequate dosage titration of LLAs were identified as contributory factors towards cardiovascular events in this patient group.", 
    "120": "The current study failed to prove the benefits of LLAs in reducing the risk of first cardiovascular events in diabetic patients. This may have been due to the use of low doses of LLAs and a lack of laboratory monitoring of cholesterol levels. Development and implementation of guidelines may help promote the use of LLAs in primary prevention of cardiovascular complications.", 
    "121": "Although pharmacologic treatment for cholesterol reduction represents an advance in cardiovascular and atherosclerosis treatment, the benefits of such therapy are still limited because of interindividual variability in the response to these drugs. Disease severity, treatment adherence, physiologic conditions, biologic conditions, and the patient's genetic profile could be cited as important factors in the evaluation of interindividual variability. In regard to the latter consideration, three large groups of genes could be investigated: (i) genes that code for proteins involved in metabolism and/or drug transport, thereby influencing the pharmacokinetics of these compounds; (ii) genes that code for proteins involved in the mechanism of action and/or in the metabolic pathway of drug action, and which therefore influence pharmacodynamics; and (iii) genes that code for proteins involved in direct development of the disease or in intermediate phenotypes. In this review we discuss pharmacogenetic studies of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and the implications of pharmacogenetic considerations for predicting treatment efficacy and reducing the adverse effects of these drugs. Once new studies have been performed and most of the genetic variability associated with drug action has been revealed, the great challenge will be to apply this knowledge in clinical medicine.", 
    "122": "The obvious strengths of fixed-dose drug combinations include the potential advantages of increased compliance, convenience, and cost savings. In contrast, potential disadvantages include reduced flexibility in dosing, exposure of some patients to therapies they do not require, and possible increased risks of adverse effects without added benefits. With respect to fixed-dose drug combinations of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), the totality of evidence is far less for the non-statin component leading to possible over utilization of two drugs when single-agent efficacy will suffice to maximize the benefit and minimize the risks. The current US FDA policy for fixed-dose drug combinations was established in 1971. The policy states that \"two or more drugs may be combined in a single dosage form when each component makes a contribution to the claimed effects and the dosage of each component (amount, frequency, duration) is such that the combination is safe and effective for a significant patient population requiring such concurrent therapy as defined in the labeling for the drug.\" The FDA was concerned with several disadvantages associated with fixed-dose combination drugs, including the lack of flexibility in titration, exposure of patients to unnecessary drugs when one component alone would be effective, as well as the increased possibility of adverse reactions without increased efficacy. The FDA has considered novel fixed-dose combination drugs to be composed of component drugs at least one of which has not been previously approved, labeled for an indication that is new to at least one or more of the component drugs, or where no significant evidence exist to support concurrent use of the components in a patient population. Based on the current FDA regulatory approval process for fixed-dose drug combinations with statins, it was possible to gain regulatory approval with intermediate endpoints such as lipids for example niacin/lovastatin and ezetimibe/simvastatin and BP/lipids, for example, amlodipine/atorvastatin. Based on the more stringent criteria of additive benefits on clinical endpoints of myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular disease death, it was possible to gain regulatory approval for aspirin/pravastatin. In summary, the approvals of several fixed-dose drug combinations with statins have both strengths and limitations. The availability to the healthcare provider of many individual statins with varying potency on lipids as well as several fixed-dose drug combinations reinforces the fact that the final decision should be made on astute and individual clinical judgements based on randomized clinical trial data, guidelines and FDA approvals with evidence to do more good than harm to the patient.", 
    "123": "Fasting and postprandial hypertriglyceridemia are essential features of metabolic syndrome. Statins decrease fasting lipid levels but fail to reduce fat load induced hypertriglyceridemia. We established whether ezetimibe combined with simvastatin differently influences post fat load lipid levels and lipoprotein composition as compared to simvastatin 80mg monotherapy in obese male metabolic syndrome patients.", 
    "124": "Prospective, randomized, double blind, crossover trial. Male obese metabolic syndrome (ATPIII) patients (n=19) were treated with simvastatin 80mg and simvastatin/ezetimibe 10mg/10mg for 6 weeks. At the start of the study and after each treatment period oral fat loading tests were performed. Lipoprotein fractions (triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL), IDL, LDL, and HDL) were isolated by density gradient ultracentrifugation. Postprandial changes in lipid levels were integrated as areas under the curve (AUCs).", 
    "125": "Fasting LDL-C, RLP-C and triglycerides were lowered equally by both simvastatin 80mg and simvastatin/ezetimibe 10mg/10mg. Also postprandial plasma triglyceride levels (net AUC-TG) were equally lowered after both treatments (5.16+/-0.50mmolh/l after simvastatin/ezetimibe 10mg/10mg and 6.09+/-0.71mmolh/l after simvastatin 80mg) compared to fat loading without treatment (6.64+/-0.86mmolh/l). In addition, triglyceride-content in lipoprotein fractions after fat load (net AUCs) were also equally reduced after both treatments. Similarly, TRL. IDL and LDL cholesterol and apoB concentrations were equally affected by both treatment regimens, leading to a reduced number of circulating particles, in both conditions. However the composition of these particles remained the same.",

    "127": "Myalgia, which often manifests as pain or soreness in skeletal muscles, is among the most salient adverse events associated with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins). Clinical issues related to statin-associated myotoxicity include (1) incidence in randomized controlled trials and occurrence in postmarketing surveillance databases; (2) potential differences between statins in their associations with such adverse events; and (3) diagnostic and treatment strategies to prevent, recognize, and manage these events. Data from systematic reviews, meta-analyses, clinical and observational trials, and post-marketing surveillance indicate that statin-associated myalgia typically affects approximately 5.0% of patients, as myopathy in 0.1% and as rhabdomyolysis in 0.01%. However, studies also suggest that myalgia is among the leading reasons patients discontinue statins (particularly high-dose statin monotherapy) and that treatment with certain statins (eg, fluvastatin) is unlikely to result in such adverse events. This review presents a clinical algorithm for monitoring and managing statin-associated myotoxicity. The algorithm highlights risk factors for muscle toxicity and provides recommendations for (1) creatine kinase measurements and monitoring; (2) statin dosage reduction, discontinuation, and rechallenge; and (3) treatment alternatives, such as extended-release fluvastatin with or without ezetimibe, low-dose or alternate-day rosuvastatin, or ezetimibe with or without colesevelam. The algorithm should help to inform and enhance patient care and reduce the risk of myalgia and other potentially treatment-limiting muscle effects that might undermine patient adherence and compromise the overall cardioprotective benefits of statins.",

    "129": "Twenty SSc patients with normal cholesterol concentrations and 20 hypercholesterolemic subjects were allocated to receive 20 mg/day simvastatin for 12 weeks. Peripheral blood samples were collected before and 12 weeks after initiation of treatment, and 4 weeks after discontinuation. Five-parameter, 3-color flow cytometry was performed with a FacScan to enumerate EPC and mature circulating endothelial cells (CEC). Levels of soluble E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, interleukin 6, and endothelin-1 were assessed by commercial ELISA.", 
    "130": "Simvastatin treatment significantly increased EPC in the hypercholesterolemic group, but failed to improve the EPC levels in the SSc patients, mainly in patients with late disease. Baseline levels of CEC were significantly higher in SSc patients compared with controls and at the end of the treatment they were significantly decreased. Regarding other markers of endothelial activation, we found that all the cytokine levels decreased in a statistically significant manner in the treated patients.", 
    "131": "Treatment with simvastatin results in rapid and significant improvement of measures of endothelial activation, suggesting a potential role of statins in the treatment of peripheral vascular disease in SSc. The lack of effect on increase of EPC confirms our previous findings of a defective endothelial stem cell recruitment in the bone marrow of SSc patients. This could indicate that the potential effectiveness of statins in SSc could mainly be ascribed to their effectiveness in modulating endothelial activation mechanisms.", 
    "132": "Although several studies have reported on the anti-tumoural properties exerted by 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoAR) inhibitors (statins), the in vivo expression of HMG-CoAR in human cancer has been considerably less investigated. In our study, we examined the immunohistochemical expression of HMG-CoAR in 511 incident breast cancers within the Malm\u00f6 Diet and Cancer Study in order to explore its relationship to established clinicopathological and tumour biological parameters. Furthermore, the potential influence of estrogen exposure on HMG-CoAR expression was assessed by performing Cox's proportional hazards analyses of the relationship between the use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT), obesity (waist circumference) and tumour-cell specific HMG-CoAR expression. We found that HMG-CoAR was present in various fractions and intensities in the cytoplasm, sometimes with a membranous pattern, but not in the tumour cell nuclei. The expression of HMG-CoAR was associated with a smaller tumour size (p = 0.02), low histological grade (p = 0.001), low Ki67 index (p = 0.004), ERalpha+ (p = 0.02), ERbeta+ (p = 0.005), and high p27 expression (p = <0.001). The incidence of tumours with a high HMG-CoAR-expression was increased among HRT-users, although this was not statistically significant in a heterogeneity analysis. Obesity was significantly associated with a high HMG-CoAR expression assessed both as a high (>50%) fraction of positive cells (relative risk: 2.06; 95% confidence interval: 1.20-3.51), and a strong staining intensity (2.33: 1.08-5.02). In summary, we demonstrate that HMG-CoAR is differentially expressed in breast cancer and that a high expression is associated with prognostically favourable tumour parameters. Moreover, estrogen related life-style and anthropometric factors might indeed regulate HMG-CoAR expression.",

The CYP3A4*1G polymorphism had a gene-dose-dependent effect on percentage reduction in serum TC (P < 0.01). Conversely, there was no significant association between lipid-lowering efficacy of simvastatin and CYP3A4*1G polymorphism.",

    "137": "Chronic kidney disease, especially in the setting of proteinuria, is characterized by hyperlipidemia. In animal models, hyperlipidemia causes glomerular foam cells and glomerulosclerosis. Treatment with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) ameliorates kidney disease in these models. The data of the role of hyperlipidemia in progression of human kidney disease are less clear. Data from small studies in glomerular disease suggest that statins decrease proteinuria. Data mainly from cardiovascular studies suggest that statins decrease the loss of glomerular filtration. The benefit of statins may derive from their lipid lowering effects. More recently, data suggest that the benefit of statins is greater than lipid lowering alone. The pleiotropic effects of statins may derive from inhibition of other downstream targets (isoprenoids) of the mevalonic acid pathway that are separate from cholesterol synthesis. Statins inhibits isoprenylation of Ras and Rho GTPases. These effects may lead to decreased monocyte/macrophage infiltration in the glomerulus, decreased mesangial proliferation and decreased accumulation of extracellular matrix and fibrosis. In addition, inhibition of RhoA and Ras may decrease inflammation and increase eNOS activity. These effects could lead to improvement in the progression of kidney disease.",

They, however, also showed improved control over blood pressure, lipids, and glucose at the beginning of rehabilitation; their use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers had increased; whereas their use of statin and acetylsalicylic acid remained relatively stable. At discharge, no changes were noted for blood pressure and glucose--at a high target-level attainment of more than 80%. Lipid values, however, tended to improve over time, with an increase in target-level attainment from 45 to 55%.

The objective of this study was to identify any patterns of differences in labeled dosing. Approved labeling, for the most widely prescribed proprietary drugs in the United States, was used as a basis for this study. Dosing was compared, for common indications, for the United States, Europe, and Japan. Overall, these data indicate that there are numerous differences in approved dosing for drugs approved in all 3 regions. For about half of the drugs studied, dosing in Japan is considerably lower than the United States or Europe. Some differences in dosing are also apparent between the United States and Europe.",

Epidemiologic studies found no or little association between blood cholesterol levels and stroke. However, randomized trials in patients with CAD have shown that statins decrease stroke incidence. These statin trials indicate 21% relative risk reductions for stroke. In subgroup analysis of the Heart Protection Study, simvastatin had no effect on stroke recurrence, in patients with a previous stroke. Recently, Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels study showed that treatment with high dose atorvastatin reduced risk of stroke in patients with recent stroke and transient ischemic attack and no known CAD.

In treatment na\u00efve patients with MS, a trend for lower TNF-alpha serum levels compared to controls was detected (P=0.08). Interferon-beta treatment increased TNF-alpha levels, while a trend for lowering of IL-5 serum levels was found (P=0.07). Addition of atorvastatin raised IL-12p70 serum levels (P<0.05). Mean levels of two Th2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-10) showed a non-significant increase after addition of atorvastatin. We conclude that interferon-beta and atorvastatin exert divergent action on Th1/Th2 serum cytokines levels in MS. Supplemental atorvastatin might promote a Th1-type response by raising IL-12p70. Further studies are required to support a Th2 cytokine shift by atorvastatin in patients with MS.",

The administration of immunosuppression is well recognised as the main cause of cancer following transplantation, so the addition of an immunomodulatory agent should be associated with an increased incidence of cancer, as immune surveillance and response may be suppressed, allowing cellular transformation and proliferation combined with lack of recognition to occur.

Patients were considered persistent if, at the time of the survey, they continued to take study medication that had been prescribed at discharge. Persistence with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, aspirin, and beta-blockers was also assessed to determine whether changes in statin persistence were unique to the class or related to other medication issues that affected all classes. The Kruskal-Wallis test, with post hoc Mann-Whitney U test, was used to analyze the differences in persistence between the groups. All comparisons were considered statistically significant at p less than 0.05.", 
    "165": "There were no significant differences in patient characteristics between study groups. Persistence with statins decreased during the periwithdrawal period (88.4% pre vs 76.7% peri) and rebounded in the postwithdrawal period (90.8%; p = 0.007). There were no significant differences in persistence with the other drug classes.", 
    "166": "The temporary decline in statin persistence appeared to be associated with the withdrawal of cerivastatin, while persistence with the other study medications remained constant.

The achieved LDL-C levels in the statin group were 100.7, 95.1, 96.7, and 102.8mg/dL at discharge, 6 months, 1 year, and 3 years, respectively, whereas those in the non-statin group were 103.2, 107.3, 102.8, and 103.0mg/dL. These levels were not significantly different between the groups during 3 years. Based on Kaplan-Meier estimates, statin therapy was associated with a reduction of long-term mortality (log-rank test P=0.007). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that statin therapy (P=0.015, hazard ratio: 0.10; 95% confidence interval: 0.01-0.64) was a significant predictor of favorable prognosis.

Clinical symptoms are muscle pain, weakness and muscle cramps, main laboratory finding is an increase in serum creatine kinase (CK). If myopathy symptoms are present or CK levels are greater than 5 times the upper limits of normal, statin therapy should be discontinued. In case of an asymptomatic CK increase below 5 times the upper limits of normal, therapy can be continued with CK monitoring.", 
    "172": "Statins, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors could be associated with the risk reduction of colorectal cancer. We previously demonstrated that simvastatin inhibits NF-kappaB signaling in human intestinal epithelial cells and ameliorates acute murine colitis. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effects of simvastatin on the apoptotic pathways related to NF-kappaB signaling in colon cancer cells, and on anticancer effects in 2 different animal models. We treated cell lines (COLO 205 and HCT 116) with simvastatin or vehicle and determined apoptosis by cell cycle analysis, Annexin V-FITC staining, caspase-3 activity assay and confocal microscopy. We assessed the expression of antiapoptotic factors by RT-PCR and Western blotting. In the colitis-associated colon cancer (CAC) model, we induced colonic tumors in C57/BL6 mice by azoxymethane and dextran sulfate sodium administration, and evaluated simvastatin's effect on tumor growth. In the xenograft model, we evaluated its effect on the inoculated tumor growth. In both cell lines, simvastatin caused dose- and time-dependent cell death. Annexin V staining significantly increased after simvastatin treatment. It augmented caspase-3 activity and downregulated the expression of Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, cIAP1 and cFLIP. In the CAC model, simvastatin significantly reduced tumor development. In the xenograft model, tumors from animals treated with simvastatin had smaller volumes, larger necrotic areas, lower expression of VEGF and higher apoptotic scores. In conclusion, simvastatin inhibited colon cancer development by induction of apoptosis and suppression of angiogenesis. These results suggest that simvastatin could be a potential chemopreventive and therapeutic agent of CAC as well as de novo colon cancer.",

However, coadministration with FPV/RTV did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of RSV. The AUC 0-24h of N-desmethyl-RSV was not significantly affected by either combinations, but that of RSV-lactone increased (P < 0.05) by 61% and 76% after coadministration with ATV/RTV and FPV/RTV, respectively.",

Aging and hypertension are two independent cardiovascular risk factors that have been shown to exhibit increased endothelin-1 system activation. This review focuses on the cardiovascular effects of the endothelin system, its relation to aging and hypertension, as well as potential treatment options.", 
    "178": "Many of the cardiovascular complications associated with both aging and hypertension are attributable, in part, to endothelial dysfunction, particularly vasomotor dysregulation. To date most studies have focused on the effects of aging and hypertension on endothelium-dependent nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation. However, endothelin-1-mediated vasoconstrictor tone increases with age and contributes to the pathogenesis of hypertension. Pharmacologic approaches to reduce endothelin-1 system activation have produced limited results and are largely disease-specific. In contrast, regular aerobic exercise has been shown to be extremely effective at reducing endothelin-1 system activity.", 
    "179": "Both aging and hypertension represent important cardiovascular disease risk factors that are characterized by increased endothelin-1-mediated vasoconstrictor tone. Future studies are needed to elucidate pharmacologic options for reducing endothelin-1 system activity especially in older hypertensive adults, though regular aerobic exercise must continue to be a point of emphasis for maintaining/improving vascular health.", 
    "180": "Fibric acid derivatives and statins have been increasingly recognized as causes of rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure. We report severe rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure associated to combination treatment with statin and fenofibrate in two patients with underlying coronary artery disease. Both patients developed rhabdomyolysis-induced acute renal failure after their hyperlipidemia treatment was changed from statin to statin plus fenofibrate. Both patients experienced intense muscle symptoms, hemoglobinuria, oliguria, and elevation of blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine. Their serum creatine kinase levels were markedly elevated (case 1; 97,392 IU/l and case 2; 96,639 IU/l). Rhabdomyolysis induced acute renal failure was diagnosed in both patients. Both patients were managed with cessation of the statin-fibrate combination, adequate fluid resuscitation and forced alkaline-mannitol diuresis. Although both patients required hemodialysis, their renal function recovered. Fenofibrate initiation is associated with an increased risk for rhabdomyolysis in patients receiving statin therapy. To prevent future events, it is crucial that clinicians recognize the interaction risk associated with concurrent use of statin and fenofibrate. We recommend careful monitoring when fenofibrate is given to patients receiving statin therapy.", 
    "181": "Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol is the principal target of lipid-lowering therapy, but recent evidence has suggested more appropriate targets. We compared the relationships of on-treatment levels of LDL cholesterol, non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B, as well as ratios of total/HDL cholesterol, LDL/HDL cholesterol, and apolipoprotein B/A-I, with the occurrence of cardiovascular events in patients receiving statin therapy.", 
    "182": "A post hoc analysis was performed that combined data from 2 prospective, randomized clinical trials in which 10,001 (\"Treating to New Targets\") and 8888 (\"Incremental Decrease in End Points through Aggressive Lipid Lowering\") patients with established coronary heart disease were assigned to usual-dose or high-dose statin treatment. In models with LDL cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B were positively associated with cardiovascular outcome, whereas a positive relationship with LDL cholesterol was lost. In a model that contained non-HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B, neither was significant owing to collinearity. Total/HDL cholesterol ratio and the apolipoprotein B/A-I ratio in particular were each more closely associated with outcome than any of the individual proatherogenic lipoprotein parameters.", 
    "183": "In patients receiving statin therapy, on-treatment levels of non-HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein B were more closely associated with cardiovascular outcome than levels of LDL cholesterol. Inclusion of measurements of the antiatherogenic lipoprotein fraction further strengthened the relationships. These data support the use of non-HDL cholesterol or apolipoprotein B as novel treatment targets for statin therapy. Given the absence of interventions that have been proven to consistently reduce cardiovascular disease risk through raising plasma levels of HDL cholesterol or apolipoprotein A-I, it seems premature to consider the ratio variables as clinically useful.", 
    "184": "Patients with type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome remain at high residual risk of cardiovascular events even after intensive statin therapy. While treatment guidelines recommend the addition of a fibrate to statin therapy in this setting, concerns about the potential for myopathy may limit the use of this combination in clinical practice. These concerns are certainly justified for gemfibrozil, which interferes with statin glucuronidation, leading to elevation in statin plasma concentrations and an increased risk of myotoxicity in combination with a range of commonly prescribed statins. However, the available evidence refutes suggestions that this is a class effect for fibrates. Fenofibrate does not adversely influence the metabolism or pharmacokinetics of any of the commonly prescribed statins. This in turn translates to a reduced potential for myotoxicity in combination with a statin. Data are awaited from the ongoing Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fenofibrate plus simvastatin combination therapy in type 2 diabetes patients.",

The existing data suggest that primary cardiovascular disease prevention treatment with a statin could be cost effective for women and men with a high cardiovascular disease risk. In secondary cardiovascular disease prevention both men and women seem to benefit equally from statin treatment. However, the relatively small number of women included in several statin trials has limited the evidence available. With regard to the question of whether Eve is becoming Adam, the answer is not yet: we need more evidence!",

That of a statin treatment strategy was R22.93 per percentage of risk reduction. U sing a high-dose statin, the cost-effective ratio was R12.81 per percentage of risk reduction. Combining the antihypertensive and statin strategy demonstrated a cost-effective ratio of R23.84 per percentage of risk reduction. A combination of several drugs enabled the hypothetical patient to reduce the risk to 14% at a cost-effective ratio of R17.18 per percentage of risk reduction.",

    "191": "A key step in endothelin-1 (ET-1) synthesis is the proteolytic cleavage of big ET-1 by the endothelin-converting enzyme-1 (ECE-1). Four alternatively spliced isoforms, ECE-1a to ECE-1d, have been discovered; however, regulation of the expression of specific ECE-1 isoforms is not well understood. Therefore, we stimulated primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) with angiotensin II (Ang II). Furthermore, expression of ECE-1 isoforms was determined in internal mammary arteries of patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery. Patients had received one of 4 therapies: angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-I), Ang II type 1 receptor blockers (ARB), HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins), and a control group that had received neither ACE-I, ARB (that is, treatment not interfering in the renin-angiotensin system), nor statins. Under control conditions, ECE-1a is the dominant isoform in HUVECs (4.5+/-2.8 amol/microg RNA), followed by ECE-1c (2.7+/-1.0 amol/microg), ECE-1d (0.49+/-0.17 amol/microg), and ECE-1b (0.17+/-0.04 amol/microg). Stimulation with Ang II did not change the ECE-1 expression pattern or the ET-1 release. We found that ECE-1 mRNA expression was higher in patients treated with statins than in patients treated with ARB therapy (5.8+/-0.76 RU versus 3.0+/-0.4 RU), mainly attributed to ECE-1a. In addition, ECE-1a mRNA expression was higher in patients receiving ACE-I therapy than in patients receiving ARB therapy (1.68+/-0.27 RU versus 0.83+/-0.07 RU). We conclude that ECE-1a is the major ECE-1 isoform in primary human endothelial cells. Its expression in internal mammary arteries can be regulated by statin therapy and differs between patients with ACE-I and ARB therapy.",

    "197": "While some centres can activate trials relatively quickly, there is considerable variation the time taken to set up a trial, much of which is due to the delay in obtaining R&D approval. This is having a major adverse effect on UK health research. There is a national need to streamline the process for considering multi-centre non-commercial clinical trials, in particular, having fixed timelines for R&D assessment. Without this, the costs of trials will increase because of extended duration, and the time to answer a research question and alter clinical practice will be significantly prolonged.", 
    "198": "Regeneration of bone is driven by the action of numerous biomolecules. However, most osteobiologic devices mainly depend on delivery of a single molecule. The present studies were directed at investigating a polymeric system that enables localized, alternating delivery of two or more biomolecules. The osteotropic biomolecules studied were simvastatin hydroxyacid (Sim) and parathyroid hormone (1-34) (PTH(1-34)), and the antimicrobial peptide cecropin B (CB) was also incorporated. Loaded microspheres were made using the complexation polymer system of cellulose acetate phthalate and Pluronic F-127 (blend ratio, 7:3). By alternating layers of the different types of microspheres, 10-layer devices were made to release CB and Sim, CB and PTH, or Sim and PTH. In vitro experiments showed five discrete peaks for each molecule over a release period of approximately two weeks. MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells alternately exposed to the osteotropic biomolecules showed enhanced proliferation and early osteoblastic activity. Alternating delivery of 10nm Sim and either 500pg/ml or 5ng/ml PTH showed additive effects compared to the CB/Sim or CB/PTH devices. These implantable formulations may be useful for alternating delivery of different biomolecules to stimulate concurrent biological effects in focal tissue regeneration applications.", 
    "199": "Besides the classical inflammatory myopathies (IM), dermatomyositis (DM), polymyositis, and inclusion body myositis, the much larger spectrum of IM includes focal and nodular myositis, granulomatous myositis, macrophagic myofasciitis, graft vs. host myositis, eosinophilic myositis, and other immune-associated conditions, some of them only recently described. In addition, paraneoplastic, statin-induced and critical illness myopathies have been considered immune-associated IM. Infectious, i.e., bacterial, viral, and parasitic IM are much less frequent in the northern hemisphere. In IM, muscle biopsy is an essential diagnostic procedure to initiate therapy. The myopathological spectrum encompasses disease-specific histopathological features, such as perifascicular atrophy in DM, non-necrotizing granulomas in sarcoid myopathy, autophagic vacuoles with tubulofilamentous inclusions in inclusion body myositis, rarely electron microscopic criteria, such as undulating tubules in endothelial cells of DM specimens, and, foremost, immunohistochemical findings. These latter features concern inflammatory infiltrates, the muscle parenchyma, the interstitial compartment, and the vasculature with varying involvement of each component in the different IM. Differences in immunohistochemical parameters among the IM, such as major histocompatibility complexes I and II, cytokines, cell adhesion molecules, different types of inflammatory cells, metalloproteinases, and complement factors procure a large gamut of data, the individual patterns of which characterize the myopathology of individual IM.", 
    "200": "We recently found that chromium picolinate (CrPic), a nutritional supplement thought to improve insulin sensitivity in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance, enhances insulin action by lowering plasma membrane (PM) cholesterol. Recent in vivo studies suggest that cholesterol-lowering statin drugs benefit insulin sensitivity in insulin-resistant patients, yet a mechanism is unknown. We report here that atorvastatin (ATV) diminished PM cholesterol by 22% (P<0.05) in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. As documented for CrPic, this small reduction in PM cholesterol enhanced insulin action. Replenishment of cholesterol mitigated the positive effects of ATV on insulin sensitivity. Co-treatment with CrPic and ATV did not amplify the extent of PM cholesterol loss or insulin sensitivity gain. In addition, analyses of insulin signal transduction suggest a non-signaling basis of both therapies. Our data reveal an unappreciated beneficial non-hepatic effect of statin action and highlight a novel mechanistic similarity between two recently recognized therapies of impaired glucose tolerance.", 
    "201": "Hypercholesterolemia in midlife increases the risk of subsequent cognitive decline, neurovascular disease, and Alzheimer's disease (AD), and statin use is associated with reduced prevalence of these outcomes. While statins improve vasoreactivity in peripheral arteries and large cerebral arteries, little is known about the effects of statins on cerebral hemodynamic responses and cognition in healthy asymptomatic adults. At the final visit of a 4-month randomized, controlled, double-blind study comparing atorvastatin 40 mg daily to placebo, 16 asymptomatic middle-aged adults (15 had useable data) underwent blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), arterial spin labeling (ASL) quantitative cerebral blood flow (qCBF), dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) and structural imagings of the brain. Using a memory recognition task requiring discrimination of previously viewed (PV) and novel (NV) human faces, fMRI was used to elicit activation from brain regions known to be vulnerable to changes associated with AD. The BOLD signal amplitude (PV > NV) and latency to each stimulus were tested on a voxel basis between the atorvastatin (n=8) and placebo (n=7) groups. Persons randomized to atorvastatin not only showed significantly greater BOLD amplitude in the right angular gyrus, left superior parietal lobule, right middle temporal and superior sulcus than the placebo group, but also decreased hemodynamic response latencies in the right middle frontal gyrus, left precentral gyrus, left cuneus and right posterior middle frontal gyrus. However, neither the resting cerebral blood flow (CBF) measured with ASL nor the mean transit time (MTT) of cerebral perfusion calculated from DSC showed differences in these regions in either group. The drug related BOLD differences during memory recognition suggest that atorvastatin may have improved cerebral small vessel vasoreactivity, possibly through an effect on endothelial function. Furthermore, these results suggest that the effect of atorvastatin on the task-induced BOLD signal may not be a simple consequence of baseline flow change."
