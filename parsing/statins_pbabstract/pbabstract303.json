Mevalonate, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-coenzyme A (CoA) reductase metabolite, was added in parallel experiments. Manumycin A, which inhibits protein prenylation, was added to cultures in the absence of statins. Calcification was assessed by counting the number of calcific nodules formed and measuring alkaline phosphatase activity (APA). Statins inhibited calcific nodule formation (P<0.01) and APA (P<0.01) in AVMFs. Mevalonate reversed the statin effect on nodule formation (P<0.05) and APA (P<0.01). Manumycin A had no effect on either parameter. M2-10B4 cells treated with simvastatin formed more calcific nodules compared with controls (P<0.01), although pravastatin had no effect. Both statins, however, resulted in increased APA in M2-10B4 cells (P<0.01). Mevalonate had no impact on nodule numbers or APA in M2-10B4 cells.", 
    "2": "Statins inhibit calcification in AVMFs by inhibiting the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, independent of protein prenylation, but paradoxically stimulate bone cell calcification. Because 15% of patients with end-stage valvular heart disease exhibit mature bone in their aortic valves, statins may differentially regulate calcification within a valve, limiting dystrophic calcification but promoting ossification of formed bone.", 
    "3": "A novel, proinflammatory cytokine, interleukin (IL)-18 production was detected in the medium of human monocytes treated with 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme-A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, pravastatin, and fluvastatin (0.1 and 1 muM) but not with the statin-derived lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) inhibitor LFA703, which did not inhibit HMG-CoA reductase. Pravastatin and fluvastatin also induced the production of IL-18, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in contrast to LFA703. IL-18 production by PBMC is located upstream of the cytokine cascade activated by these statins. The IL-18-induced cytokine production was demonstrated to be dependent on adhesion molecule expression on monocytes. In the absence and presence of lower concentrations (0.1 and 1 ng/ml) of IL-18, pravastatin and fluvastatin inhibited the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and induced the expression of CD40, whereas LFA703 had no effect. In the presence of higher concentrations (5, 10, and 100 ng/ml) of IL-18, pravastatin, fluvastatin, and LFA703 similarly inhibited the expression of ICAM-1 and CD40 as well as the production of IL-12, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma in PBMC. The effects of pravastatin and fluvastatin but not LFA703 were abolished by the addition of mevalonate, indicating the involvement of HMG-CoA reductase in the action of pravastatin and fluvastatin. Thus, the effects of LFA703 were distinct from those of pravastatin and fluvastatin in the presence of lower concentrations of IL-18. It was concluded that LFA703 has the inhibitory effect on an IL-18-initiated immune response without any activation on monocytes.", 
    "4": "We consider the number needed to treat (NNT) when the event of interest is defined by dichotomizing a continuous response at a threshold level. If the response is measured with error, the resulting NNT is biased. We consider methods to reduce this bias.", 
    "5": "Bias adjustment was studied using simulations in which we varied the distributions of the underlying response and measurement error, including both normal and nonnormal distributions. We studied a maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) based on normality assumptions, and also considered a simulation-extrapolation estimate (SIMEX) without such assumptions. The treatment effect across all potential thresholds was summarized using an NNT threshold curve.", 
    "6": "Crude NNT estimation was substantially biased due to measurement error. The MLE performed well under normality, and it continued to perform well with nonnormal measurement error, but when the underlying response was nonnormal the MLE was unacceptably biased and was outperformed by the SIMEX estimate. The simulation results were also reflected in empirical data from a randomized study of cholesterol-lowering therapy.", 
    "7": "Ignoring measurement error can lead to substantial bias in NNT, which can have an important practical effect on the interpretation of analyses. Analysis methods that adjust for measurement error bias can be used to assess the sensitivity of NNT estimates to this effect.", 
    "8": "A role for mevalonate in cancer development has long been suggested by findings that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity is elevated in malignant cells. Increased synthesis mevalonate and mevalonate-derived nonsterol isoprenoids supports increased cell proliferation through the activation of growth-regulatory proteins and oncoproteins, and by promoting DNA synthesis. We have recently shown that mevalonate promotes the growth of human breast cancer cells both in culture and as tumors grown in nude mice. Inhibition mevalonate synthesis, therefore, may be an effective strategy to impair the growth of malignant breast cells. Several dietary compounds with known anti-cancer effects are also reported to inhibit HMG-CoA reductase activity. Here, we review evidence suggesting that inhibition of mevalonate synthesis may mediate the protective effects of cholesterol, plant isoprenoids, genistein, and long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on experimental breast cancer.",

Flow-mediated dilatation of the brachial artery was repeated at the end of the 4-week period.", 
    "11": "Folic acid and placebo groups were comparable regarding age, sex, smoking, hypertension, coronary artery disease, obesity, family history and blood lipids.

    "13": "The present study examined the interaction of four 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (atorvastatin, lovastatin, and simvastatin in acid and lactone forms, and pravastatin in acid form only) with multidrug resistance gene 1 (MDR1, ABCB1) P-glycoprotein, multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2, ABCC2), and organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1, SLCO21A6). P-glycoprotein substrate assays were performed using Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells expressing MDR1, and the efflux ratios [the ratio of the ratio of basolateral-to-apical apparent permeability and apical-to-basolateral permeability between MDR1 and MDCK] were 1.87, 2.32/4.46, 2.17/3.17, and 0.93/2.00 for pravastatin, atorvastatin (lactone/acid), lovastatin (lactone/acid), and simvastatin (lactone/acid), respectively, indicating that these compounds are weak or moderate substrates of P-glycoprotein. In the inhibition assays (MDR1, MRP2, Mrp2, and OATP1B1), the IC50 values for efflux transporters (MDR1, MRP2, and Mrp2) were >100 microM for all statins in acid form except lovastatin acid (>33 microM), and the IC50 values were up to 10-fold lower for the corresponding lactone forms. In contrast, the IC50 values for the uptake transporter OATP1B1 were 3- to 7-fold lower for statins in the acid form compared with the corresponding lactone form. These data demonstrate that lactone and acid forms of statins exhibit differential substrate and inhibitor activities toward efflux and uptake transporters. The interconversion between the lactone and acid forms of most statins exists in the body and will potentially influence drug-transporter interactions, and may ultimately contribute to the differences in pharmacokinetic profiles observed between statins.", 
    "14": "The present study was designed to investigate the lipid-lowering properties and mechanisms of action of a new HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, rosuvastatin, in female ApoE*3-Leiden transgenic mice. Mice received a high fat/cholesterol (HFC) diet containing either rosuvastatin (0 [control], 0.00125%, 0.0025%, or 0.005% [w/w]) or 0.05% (w/w) lovastatin. The highest dose of rosuvastatin reduced plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels by 39% and 42%, respectively, compared with the HFC control. Lovastatin had no effect on plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels. In ApoE*3-Leiden mice on a chow diet, rosuvastatin (0.005% [w/w]) decreased plasma cholesterol levels by 35% without having an effect on triglyceride levels. On a chow diet, expression of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis and uptake in the liver was increased by rosuvastatin. Further mechanistic studies in HFC-fed mice showed that rosuvastatin treatment resulted in decreased hepatic VLDL-triglyceride and VLDL-apolipoprotein B production. VLDL lipid composition remained unchanged, indicating a reduction in the number of VLDL particles secreted. Lipolytic activity and expression of genes involved in cholesterol and triglyceride synthesis and beta-oxidation of fatty acids in the liver were not affected by rosuvastatin treatment, and hepatic lipid content did not change. However, activity of hepatic diacylglycerol acyltransferase was significantly decreased by 25% after rosuvastatin treatment. Moreover, biliary excretion of cholesterol, phospholipids, and bile acids was increased during treatment. The results indicate that rosuvastatin treatment in ApoE*3-Leiden mice on a HFC diet leads to redistribution of cholesterol and triglycerides in the body, both by reduced hepatic VLDL production and triglyceride synthesis and by enhanced hepatobiliary removal of cholesterol, bile acids, and phospholipids, resulting in substantial reductions in plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels.", 
    "15": "Inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (statins) ameliorate atherosclerotic diseases. Macrophages play an important role in the development and subsequent stability of atherosclerotic plaques. We reported previously that oxidized low density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) induced macrophage proliferation through the secretion of granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and the consequent activation of p38 MAPK. The present study was designed to elucidate the mechanism of the inhibitory effect of statins on macrophage proliferation. Mouse peritoneal macrophages were used in our study. Cerivastatin and simvastatin each inhibited Ox-LDL-induced [(3)H]thymidine incorporation into macrophages. Statins did not inhibit Ox-LDL-induced GM-CSF production, but inhibited GM-CSF-induced p38 MAPK activation. Farnesyl transferase inhibitor and geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor inhibited GM-CSF-induced macrophage proliferation, and farnesyl pyrophosphate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate prevented the effect of statins. GM-CSF-induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation was also inhibited by farnesyl transferase inhibitor or geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitor, and farnesyl pyrophosphate and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate prevented the suppression of GM-CSF-induced p38 MAPK phosphorylation by statins. Furthermore, we found that statin significantly inhibited the membrane translocation of the small G protein family members Ras and Rho. GM-CSF-induced p38 MAPK activation and macrophage proliferation was partially inhibited by overexpression of dominant negative Ras and completely by that of RhoA. In conclusion, statins inhibited GM-CSF-induced Ras- or RhoA-p38 MAPK signal cascades, thereby suppressing Ox-LDL-induced macrophage proliferation. The significant inhibition of macrophage proliferation by statins may also explain, at least in part, their anti-atherogenic action.",

    "18": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the possibility of different effects of the hydrophobic statin simvastatin and the hydrophilic statin pravastatin on the remodelling process in the overloaded left ventricle and renal cortex of SHRs (spontaneously hypertensive rats). Fifteen SHRs were treated for 40 days with simvastatin, pravastatin or placebo (water) via orogastric administration. Left ventricle and renal cortex were examined by light microscopy and stereology. LV (left ventricular) cardiomyocyte nuclei (N[cmn]) and glomeruli (N[gl]) numbers were estimated by the dissector method. BP (blood pressure) and serum triacylglycerols (triglycerides) were lower in the statin-treated groups than in the untreated control group. The volume density of the interstitial connective tissue was smaller and length density of the intramyocardial arteries, as well as the arteries/cardiomyocyte ratio, was greater in the statin-treated groups than in the control group. No difference was observed between the two statin-treated groups. The cross-sectional cardiomyocyte area was significantly smaller in the simvastatin-treated group than in the control or pravastatin-treated groups, and it was smaller in the pravastatin-treated group than in the control group. N[cmn] and N[gl] were greater in the two statin-treated groups than in the control group, but no significant difference was observed between the two statin-treated groups. In conclusion, administration of the statins simvastatin and pravastatin to SHRs effectively prevented the elevation in BP and serum triaclyglycerols, and also attenuated adverse cardiac and kidney remodelling by preventing LV hypertrophy, enhancing myocardial vascularization with the decrease in interstitial fibrosis and attenuating cardiomyocyte and glomerular loss.", 
    "19": "Atorvastatin (Lipitor) is an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor with well documented lipid-lowering effects. It has recently been evaluated for the primary prevention of major cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus without elevated serum low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol levels. Atorvastatin 10mg daily for 4 years was effective at reducing the risk of a first major cardiovascular event, including stroke, in a large, placebo-controlled, multicentre trial in patients with type 2 diabetes and at least one other coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factor, but without markedly elevated LDL-cholesterol levels. In this trial, known as CARDS (the Collaborative AtoRvastatin Diabetes Study), atorvastatin had a similar tolerability profile to that of placebo. Thus, atorvastatin has a potential role in the primary prevention of cardiovascular events in diabetic patients at risk of CHD, irrespective of pre-treatment LDL-cholesterol levels.",

Serum levels of total cholesterol (t-chol), triglyceride (TG), very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-chol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-chol, and CMF were significantly higher in hyperlipidemia, but there was no significant difference in serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-chol levels between hyperlipidemic and healthy subjects. Treatment with atorvastatin resulted in significant decreases of serum t-chol, TG, and LDL-chol levels but not serum HDL-chol and VLDL-chol. Treatment with colestimide significantly reduced serum t-chol, HDL-chol, and LDL-chol levels but not those of TG and VLDL-chol. CMF was significantly reduced by treatment with atorvastatin but not by colestimide. Atorvastatin significantly reduced plasma levels of thrombomodulin, thrombin antithrombin complex (TAT) and tissue type plasminogen activator-plasminogen activator inhibitor-I complex. Colestimide moderately prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time and reduction of TAT. Based on its actions of lowering modified LDL and improving hemostatic abnormalities, we postulate that atorvastatin might inhibit the onset of ischemic diseases.",

Here, we show that this mAb labels activated EC in newly formed vessels in vivo without staining mature vessels or other tissues. Using this mAb, drug effects on in vivo EC migration and vessel formation were visually assessed by whole-mount immunochemical staining in the transparent embryo. In addition, we have developed a quantitative microplate-based ELISA that measures EC proliferation in vivo after drug treatment. We have validated the quantitative in vivo ELISA using several antiangiogenic small molecules with different mechanisms of action which were added directly to the fish water. Some of these drugs, including: 2-methoxyestradiol, flavopiridol, paclitaxel, and genistein, are currently in clinical trials. We also injected large molecule drugs, including 3TSR and TSR2+KRFK, recombinant human antiangiogenic peptides of thrombospondin-1, a natural protein. To demonstrate that proangiogenic effects can also be assessed in zebrafish, we assessed effects of penicillamine and simvastatin, two proangiogenic compounds shown to stimulate vessel formation in rodents. Using whole-mount immunochemical staining with Phy-V002, inhibition of EC migration and inhibition or stimulation of vessel formation were visually observed for each compound. Next, using the quantitative in vivo angiogenesis ELISA, we generated dose-response curves for each compound. Compared to conventional assays, advantages of using zebrafish to assess drug effects on angiogenesis include: (1) a short assay time; (2) easy animal maintenance; (3) use of small quantities of drug; (4) single dosing; (5) a quantitative assay format; and (6) use of statistically significant number of animals per test.",

    "36": "The bisphosphonates are a novel class of drug that have been registered for various clinical applications worldwide. Bisphosphonates, and in particular the aminobisphosphonates (nBPs), are known to have a number of side-effects including a rise in body temperature and accompanying flu-like symptoms that resemble a typical acute phase response. The mechanism for this response has been partially elucidated and appears to be associated with the release of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)alpha and interleukin (IL)6, although the effector cells that release these cytokines and the mechanism of action remain enigmatic. Here, we show that the nBP-induced acute phase response differs from the typical acute phase response in that CD14+ cells such as monocytes and macrophages are not the primary cytokine producing cells. We show that by inhibiting the mevalonate pathway, nBPs induce rapid and copious production of TNFalpha and IL6 by peripheral blood gammadelta T cells. Prior treatment with statins, which inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, blocks nBP-induced production of these proinflammatory cytokines by gammadelta T cells and may offer a means of avoiding the associated acute phase response. In addition, our findings provide a further mechanism for the anti-inflammatory effects attributed to inhibitors of HMG CoA reductase.",

It also discusses other therapeutic targets, such as squalene synthase, microsomal transfer protein, acyl-cholesterol acyl transferase, cholesterol ester transfer protein, peroxosimal proliferator-activating receptors and lipoprotein (a), for which compounds have been developed and have at least reached trials in animal models. Lipid-altering drugs are likely to prove a fast-developing area for novel treatments, as possible synergies exist between new and established compounds for the treatment of atherosclerosis.", 
    "38": "The statins (including mevastatin and lovastatin) are a widely prescribed class of serum-cholesterol lowering drugs that function by inhibiting 3-hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase activity and cellular sterol synthesis. Statins are also widely being appreciated for their inhibitory effects upon inflammation, primarily mediated through direct regulation of inflammatory gene expression. Here we report that statins are also capable of increasing the expression of macrophage elastase (MMP-12). The induction of MMP-12 in mouse macrophages by statins is specific for HMG CoA reductase inhibition, rescued by mevalonate and not observed after inhibition of subsequent steps in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. Modulation of cholesterol metabolism may lead to changes in MMP-12 expression and subsequent impacts during physiological and pathophysiological states. We conclude that statins, in addition to their previously described anti-inflammatory properties, may promote the production of some proteinases from activated macrophages.", 
    "39": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a devastating and complex clinical condition involving proinflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide toxicity that produces a predictable pattern of progressive injury entailing neuronal loss, axonal destruction, and demyelination at the site of impact. The involvement of proinflammatory cytokines and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in exacerbation of SCI pathology is well documented. We have reported previously the antiinflammatory properties and immunomodulatory activities of statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl [HMG]-CoA reductase inhibitors) in the animal model of multiple sclerosis, experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE). The present study was undertaken to investigate the efficacy of atorvastatin (Lipitor; LP) treatment in attenuating SCI-induced pathology. Immunohistochemical detection and real-time PCR analysis showed increased expression of iNOS, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta) after SCI. In addition, neuronal apoptosis was detected 24 hr after injury followed by a profound increase in ED1-positive inflammatory infiltrates, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive reactive astrocytes, and oligodendrocyte apoptosis by 1 week after SCI relative to control. LP treatment attenuated the SCI-induced iNOS, TNFalpha, and IL-1beta expression. LP also provided protection against SCI-induced tissue necrosis, neuronal and oligodendrocyte apoptosis, demyelination, and reactive gliosis. Furthermore, rats treated with LP scored much higher on the locomotor rating scale after SCI (19.13 +/- 0.53) than did untreated rats (9.04 +/- 1.22). This study therefore reports the beneficial effect of atorvastatin for the treatment of SCI-related pathology and disability.",

Sixteen percent of patients had no history of cardiovascular disease but presented at least one of major cardiovascular risk factor: hypertension (91%), hyperlipemia (58%), diabetes (28%), and/or smoking (6%). Eighty-four percent had a known history of occlusive, atherosclerotic vascular disease: coronary heart disease in 76%, peripheral artery disease in 17%, and prior stroke or transient ischemic attack in 13%.

    "56": "Forward genetics is an unbiased methodology to discover new genes or functions of genes. At the present, the zebrafish is one of the few vertebrate systems where large-scale forward genetic studies are practical. Fluorescent lipid labeling of zebrafish larvae derived from families created from ENU-mutagenized fish enabled us to perform a large scale in vivo screen to identify mutants with perturbed lipid processing. With the aid of the zebrafish genome project, positional cloning of mutated genes with abnormal lipid metabolism can be accelerated. MO- and gripNA-based transient gene silencing is feasible in zebrafish embryos and provides a reverse genetic screening strategy to search for important lipid regulators. The advantages of using zebrafish as a vertebrate model to study lipid metabolism include its rapid external development and its optical clarity that enables the monitoring of biological processes. Large scale, high-throughput drug screening in vivo, especially for drugs that inhibit lipid absorption, can be easily achieved in this model. These zebrafish-based assays are important tools to understand aspects of lipid biology with significant clinical implications.",

    "59": "This 12-month, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial was conducted at the University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy. Patients aged 18 to 80 years with combined hyperlipidemia, type 2 DM, and CHD were randomly assigned to receive combination therapy with extended-release fluvastatin 80 mg + micronized fenofibrate 200 mg or monotherapy with extended-release fluvastatin 80 mg. All treatments were given in tablet form, once daily with the evening meal, for 12 months. Lipid variables (low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C], total cholesterol [TC], and triglycerides [TG]) at 6 and 12 months were the primary efficacy variables, and glycemic status (glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA(1c)], fasting plasma glucose, and postprandial plasma glucose levels) at 6 and 12 months was the secondary efficacy variable. Tolerability was assessed using physical examination, including vital-sign assessment, body-weight measurement, electrocardiography, adverse events, and laboratory tests. A pharmacoeconomic analysis of both treatment regimens was also carried out using the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER).", 
    "60": "A total of 48 patients (24 men, 24 women; mean [SD] age, 60 [5] years) were enrolled. After 6 months, all primary efficacy variables, except for TG level, showed significant improvements from baseline only in the combination-therapy group (changes: LDL-C, -25%; HDL-C, +12%; and TC, -19%; all, P < 0.05 vs baseline). After 12 months, lipid variables showed significant improvements over baseline in both groups (all, P < 0.05), except for TG in the monotherapy group. Significant changes in LDL-C, HDL-C, and TG were found in the combination-therapy group (-35%, +34%, -32%, respectively) versus the monotherapy group (-25%, +14%, -17%, respectively; all, P < 0.05 between groups). The change from baseline in HbA(1c) level was significant with combination therapy (-12% vs -7%; P < 0.05). Both treatments were well tolerated, with no significant differences in the incidences of adverse events between the 2 groups. The ICER showed that each 1% decrease in LDL-C level achieved with the fenofibrate + fluvastatin combination added a cost of 14.97 Euros/y (US 12.25 US dollars/y), and each 1% increase in HDL-C level added a cost of 7.48 Euros/y (6.12/y US dollars), over the cost of monotherapy.", 
    "61": "In this selected sample of patients with combined hyperlipidemia, type 2 DM, and CHD, the combination of extended-release fluvastatin + micronized fenofibrate was associated with a more improved lipid profile than fluvastatin monotherapy, and was a well-tolerated and cost-effective therapeutic choice to treat these patients at high risk for CVD.",

The aim of this study was to assess the effect of 30-day atorvastatin treatment on major hemostatic risk factors (fibrinogen, PAI-1 levels, factor VII coagulant activity) in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia. We studied 18 hypercholesterolemic patients and 12 matched control subjects. Compared to the control subjects, hypercholesterolemic patients exhibited increased plasma PAI-1 levels and factor VII activity. Atorvastatin (20 mg/d) not only decreased total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and oxidized LDL, but also reduced PAI-1 levels and factor VII activity and tended to decrease fibrinogen levels.

    "67": "The lifetime risk of developing coronary heart disease after age 40 has been estimated to be 49% and 32% in men and women, respectively. Including other diseases secondary to atherosclerosis makes the likelihood of developing cardiovascular disease even greater. Lacking an adequate screening test for subclinical cardiovascular disease, or for those in whom it will develop, our current national prevention and treatment strategy is to screen for risk factors of coronary artery disease (CAD), treating only those at greatest risk. Although pharmacologic lipid-lowering therapy has proven to be effective at reducing the development and manifestations of CAD, as well as remarkably safe, our current strategy withholds treatment of many in whom cardiovascular disease will ultimately develop. An alternate strategy is to implement universal lipid-lowering therapy, initiated in men at age 30 and at the time of menopause in women. Such a policy would not limit effective treatment to only those at greatest risk. While the cost of such a program would be substantial, although decreasing with the increasing availability of generic agents, this must be weighed against the direct and indirect costs of cardiovascular disease, estimated to be $368 billion in 2004. If such a strategy were implemented, the goal of screening would shift from CAD detection to detection of a disease burden such that therapies shown to decrease events among those with manifest CAD would be expected to benefit. Such treatments currently include aspirin, beta blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and revascularization.",

We tested the effectiveness of statin therapy in improving arterial compliance in patients with manifest coronary disease (CAD) and/or diabetes. Simvastatin (40 mg/day) was administered to 10 patients with proven CAD for 4 months. As measured by air plethysmography, compliance of the arterial segments in the thigh improved in every patient after 2 months, increasing by 34% by the fourth month. Compliance at the calf was not affected. These results suggest that compliance in the thigh is controlled by smooth muscle tone. Compliance measurements in the thigh and calf may be a useful measurement in evaluating high-risk patients and monitoring cholesterol-lowering therapy.",

In the FBS-cultured arteries, the protein expression ratio of alpha-actin/beta-actin was significantly decreased, indicating the change to synthetic phenotype. Fluvastatin restored the decreased expression ratio, and the addition of mevalonate (100 mumol/L) suppressed this recovery. In accordance with the synthetic morphological changes, the absolute force of contractions induced by stimuli was decreased. Fluvastatin treatment also restored the decreased contractility, and the addition of mevalonate suppressed this recovery. In the arteries cultured with FBS, extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) phosphorylation were significantly increased. Fluvastatin inhibited these phosphorylations, and mevalonate prevented the action of fluvastatin.",

The antihyperplastic actions by statins may be induced by inhibiting the ERK1/2 and p38MAPK activities, possibly through inhibition of prenylated Ras. We examined the inhibitory mechanisms of fluvastatin on FBS-induced vascular hypertrophy assessed by organ-cultured artery. Results suggest that fluvastatin inhibits vascular smooth muscle phenotype modulation and proliferation by inhibiting the ERK1/2 and p38MAPK activities through depletion of mevalonate in smooth muscle cells, resulting in inhibiting vascular hyperplastic changes.",

AV (0.9 mg kg-1) was administered orally for 49 successive days to Schistosoma heamatobium-infected hamster starting from day 35 post-infection (pi). Another group of infected hamster was administrated MPA intramuscularly (0.1 ml kg-1) at days 7 and 35 pi followed by AV treatment regimen. Both treatment regimens significantly affected the surface ultrastructure of the male worms more pronouncedly than the female ones. Combined treatment was more severe in action compared to single one. The combined treatment was characterized by losing of spines and damaging of tubercles throughout the tegument, severe erosion and peeling and appearance of deep crakes in different parts of the tegument. Moreover, mild to sever destruction to the oral suckers of both female and male worms was noticed. On the other hand, both treatment regimens significantly reduced numbers of recovered S. haematobium worms and tissue egg load. Oogram pattern was affected only in case of combined treatment with high percentage of dead eggs. In conclusion, AV, if given continuously for long time, has a pronounced antischistosomal action especially when accompanied with contraceptive intake. These promising results may encourage further investigation with the intention of their possible application on treatment of schistosomiasis as a complement strategy to praziquantel chemotherapy.",

However, it has not been determined whether protein geranylgeranylation is involved in early differentiation of osteoclasts (pOC formation). The current study shows that statins and the geranylgeranyl transferase I inhibitor GGTI-2166 inhibit the pOC formation induced by RANKL or TNF-alpha in cultures of both mouse marrow-derived macrophage-colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) dependent monocytes (MD cells) and the mouse monocyte cell line RAW 264.7 (RAW cells). Mevastatin, 0.1-0.6 microM, inhibited the formation of pOCs induced by receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL) or tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha) in both cell cultures. The inhibitory effects of mevastatin were overcome by the addition of mevalonate, farnesyl pyrophosphate or geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate. GGTI-2166 inhibited TRAP activity induced by RANKL or TNF-alpha in both cell cultures and prevented the incorporation of [3H]all-trans geranylgeraniol into prenylated proteins in RAW cells. However, the farnesyl transferase inhibitor FTI-2153 did not inhibit TRAP activity although FTI prevented the incorporation of [14C]mevalonate into farnesylated proteins in RAW cells. Clostridium difficile cytotoxin B (toxin B) inhibited pOC formation induced by RANKL or TNF-alpha in both cell cultures. The inhibitory effects of statins and GGTI-2166 on pOC formation may result from the inhibition of the geranylgeranylation of G-proteins, such as Rho or Rac, suggesting that the geranylgeranylation of these proteins is involved in the early differentiation of progenitor cells into pOCs.", 
    "100": "A novel method (MOLPRINT 3D) for virtual screening and the elucidation of ligand-receptor binding patterns is introduced that is based on environments of molecular surface points. The descriptor uses points relative to the molecular coordinates, thus it is translationally and rotationally invariant. Due to its local nature, conformational variations cause only minor changes in the descriptor. If surface point environments are combined with the Tanimoto coefficient and applied to virtual screening, they achieve retrieval rates comparable to that of two-dimensional (2D) fingerprints. The identification of active structures with minimal 2D similarity (\"scaffold hopping\") is facilitated. In combination with information-gain-based feature selection and a naive Bayesian classifier, information from multiple molecules can be combined and classification performance can be improved. Selected features are consistent with experimentally determined binding patterns. Examples are given for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, and thromboxane A2 antagonists.", 
    "101": "The efficacy of the statins for both primary and secondary prevention has now been clearly established in patients across the spectrum of cardiovascular risk. In addition to their primary effect in reducing plasma cholesterol, the statins possess various 'pleiotropic' effects that may contribute to their clinical effectiveness in reducing cardiovascular events, e.g. improvement of endothelial function, reduction of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol oxidation and stabilisation of atheromatous plaques. Although statins share similar chemical characteristics, they differ significantly in terms of their molecular synthesis, solubility and pharmacokinetic behaviour and metabolism. Side-effects secondary to longterm statin therapy are rare, but rhabdomyolysis may occur when statins are administered together with other drugs that have a direct toxic effect on muscle or which inhibit statin metabolism. Among the various statins, it would appear that fluvastatin has the lowest propensity to interact with other drugs and the least potential to induce myotoxicity.", 
    "102": "Coronary artery disease is becoming more prevalent every day. We now know that controlling the risk factors for this pathology is of the utmost importance, not only to prevent the formation of atheromatous plaques (primary prevention), but also to slow its progression, or even promote regression of existing plaques (secondary prevention). There is no longer any doubt that an increase in serum cholesterol is essential for the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Therefore, lowering cholesterol levels is a key factor in controlling this disease. It has been shown that cholesterol reduction with statins is associated with a reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. It has also been demonstrated that reducing cholesterol restores peripheral and coronary vasodilation even in subjects with no angiographic evidence of the disease.", 
    "103": "The present study aimed at assessing the effect of simvastatin in reducing myocardial ischemia in patients with chronic atherosclerotic coronary artery disease.", 
    "104": "Twenty-five patients with stable angina and dyslipidemia undergoing clinical treatment were studied prospectively. Their lipid profile was analyzed and the diagnosis of effort-induced ischemia was confirmed by means of exercise testing. They were then randomly distributed in two groups: the simvastatin group and the placebo group. After a four- to six-month follow-up period (average of 5.72 months), they underwent new laboratory and exercise tests.", 
    "105": "A significant reduction in the variation of total cholesterol (p < 0.0002) and LDL-C levels (p < 0.001) was observed in the simvastatin group, compared to the placebo group. The parameters assessed during the exercise test revealed a significant improvement in ST-segment depression during effort (p < 0.046), as well as a decrease in precordial pain in the treated group during exertion, when comparing pre- and post-treatment periods. Patients receiving simvastatin also improved their functional capacity (p < 0.016), subjectively assessed by the angina pectoris classification of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society.", 
    "106": "These results suggest that the association of simvastatin and conventional treatment in patients with stable angina reduces effort-induced ischemia, and can be used with this group of patients, particularly those considered ineligible for invasive therapeutic intervention.", 
    "107": "The pharmacologic regulation of lipid metabolism in patients with dyslipidemia is unequivocally associated with significant reductions in risk for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. A number of therapeutic drug classes have been developed in an effort to ever more precisely and intensively modulate lipid metabolism. Statins, fibrates, ezetimibe, and niacin exert their effects via different mechanisms and afford physicians the opportunity to beneficially impact multiple pathways in patients. When used alone or in combination, these drugs decrease risk for the development and progression of atherosclerotic disease. There are strong clinical trial data to support of the use of lipid-lowering therapies in the settings of both primary and secondary prevention. This article (1) discusses the mechanisms of action of antilipidemic medications, (2) reviews dosing regimens and the pharmacokinetic differences among drugs of the same class, (3) assesses risk for drug interactions, and (4) reviews the clinical trial evidence used to support the use of particular antilipidemic medications in specific physiologic settings. The incidence of dyslipidemia is rising worldwide. This trend portends an ever-growing need for the aggressive and judicious use of different antilipidemic medication(s) in patients at risk for all forms of atherosclerotic vascular disease.", 
    "108": "Specific ongoing observations from diverse medical studies do not serve to belittle the impact of prostate or other cancers, but the overall impact of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in individuals at high-risk or in individuals that have been diagnosed with common cancers needs to be addressed by future research. CVD has been the number one cause of death in men and women since the year 1990. Serum cholesterol levels are some of the most accurate long-term predictors of all-cause mortality. CVD has been the number one cause of death in the largest dietary supplement cancer chemoprevention trials.", 
    "109": "The potential for utilizing a cancer chemoprevention agent that may simultaneously reduce the risk of CVD and cancer is not only attractive, but several agents are available immediately that may demonstrate this unique impact. For example, recently statin drugs, low-dose aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and even fish oil supplements may be utilized in the next major cancer chemoprevention trial.", 
    "110": "Heart healthy agents and interventions seem to also exhibit the ability to be prostate healthy. In addition, their low cost and potential to reduce all-cause mortality may also ensure good compliance. Statins and other heart healthy agents should be considered to be the next most ideal interventions to be utilized in the next major chemoprevention trial, especially now because several popular past dietary supplements and drugs have demonstrated the potential for notable side effects and an inability to impact the risk of CVD.", 
    "111": "Several important observations should be kept in mind by cancer researchers: cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the number one cause of death; CVD is the number one cause of death in the largest cancer chemoprevention trials; CVD is the number one or two cause of death in prostate cancer patients; and some of the mechanisms that increase the risk of CVD may also increase the risk or progression of prostate cancer.", 
    "112": "Screening studies suggest a high prevalence of dyslipidemia in men with and without prostate cancer. Numerous recent lifestyle interventions that reduce cholesterol have also been found to have a potential impact on reducing the risk of prostate cancer. Recent studies of statins and other heart healthy agents have found a secondary potential for exhibiting a reduced risk or progression of prostate cancer.", 
    "113": "Laboratory and clinical data over the past several decades continue to support the use of a heart healthy agent in the nest cancer chemoprevention trial. The potential for an agent to simultaneously reduce the risk of the primary and secondary cause of death suggests that statins and other heart healthy agents are the ideal next interventions to be utilized in the next major cancer chemoprevention trial. If successful, this agent would most likely represent a dramatic impact on the history of cancer chemoprevention, and if not successful the potential secondary impact would again be a landmark finding in cancer chemoprevention; so the time is more than ripe for such a unique trial.", 
    "114": "Statins significantly reduce cholesterol synthesis and reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In addition, they appear to have beneficial effects independent of their ability to lower cholesterol. Recent publications suggesting a potential role for statin therapy in chronic renal insufficiency, hypertension and following organ transplantation are reviewed.", 
    "115": "Pharmacokinetic studies have shown statins to be well-tolerated and effective in patients on long-term haemodialysis, providing equivalent control of lipid levels to that seen in matched controls. Preliminary clinical trials suggest that statins may have beneficial disease-modifying effects in chronic inflammatory disease. Furthermore, immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory actions may confer benefit following cardiac transplantation, but this remains to be demonstrated definitively in renal transplant patients. Data to date suggest that, in addition to reduction of cardiovascular risk, statins may help slow the progress of chronic renal insufficiency, particularly in patients with proteinuria. Addition of statin therapy may also contribute to the control of systemic and pulmonary hypertension.", 
    "116": "Encouraging data in support of a wider spectrum of use for statins are emerging. In addition to reduction of cardiovascular risk through lipid lowering, they may represent an important adjunctive therapy in patients with chronic kidney diseases and post-transplantation. However, further large, well-designed clinical trials are required before their widespread use can be recommended in this setting.", 
    "117": "Coronary artery plaque rupture is a sudden, unpredictable event leading to acute coronary syndrome. Thus far, there is no clinical characteristic to distinguish the patients at risk for acute myocardial infarction from those with more stable coronary artery disease. The purpose of this study was to identify clinical predictors of first ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).", 
    "118": "We retrospectively compared 116 consecutive patients presenting with their first STEMI for primary angioplasty and 216 ambulatory patients with stable angina requiring their first coronary intervention.", 
    "119": "Patients with STEMI were younger, more likely to be smokers, but less likely to have hypertension or hypercholesterolemia. Diabetes was present equally between the two groups. Cardioprotective medication usage, such as aspirin and statin, was much lower among patients presenting with their first STEMI.", 
    "120": "Thus, patients with STEMI presumably from plaque rupture have fewer traditional risk factors compared with patients with stable angina. Identifying these vulnerable patients at risk for plaque rupture may enable early institution of cardioprotective pharmacotherapy to prevent their first acute coronary syndrome occurrence.", 
    "121": "Systemic lupus erythematosus is a multisystem autoimmune disease characterized by a wide range of immunological abnormalities that underlie the loss of tolerance. In this study we show that administration of atorvastatin to lupus-prone NZB/W F(1) mice resulted in a significant reduction in serum IgG anti-dsDNA Abs and decreased proteinuria. Histologically, the treatment was associated with reduced glomerular Ig deposition and less glomerular injury. Disease improvement was paralleled by decreased expression of MHC class II on monocytes and B lymphocytes and reduced expression of CD80 and CD86 on B lymphocytes. Consequent upon this inhibition of Ag presentation, T cell proliferation was strongly impaired by atorvastatin in vitro and in vivo. A significant decrease in MHC class II expression was also observed in the target organ of lupus disease (i.e., the glomerulus). Serum cholesterol in atorvastatin-treated lupus mice fell to the level found in young NZB/W mice before disease onset. This is the first demonstration that atorvastatin can delay the progression of a spontaneous autoimmune disease and may specifically benefit patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.", 
    "122": "trans fatty acid (TFA) intake increases systemic inflammation in healthy persons. However, the effect in patients with established heart disease is unknown.", 
    "123": "Our aim was to determine whether TFAs are associated with systemic inflammation in patients with established heart disease.", 
    "124": "Red blood cell membrane TFAs, a biomarker of dietary intake, and inflammatory marker concentrations were ascertained in 86 ambulatory patients with established heart failure. Associations between TFA levels and inflammatory markers were evaluated by linear regression.",

For each inflammatory marker, associations are presented as the absolute difference and percentage difference from the mean for each 1% higher membrane TFA level. After adjustment for age, sex, body mass index, diabetes, smoking, ejection fraction, New York Heart Association class, ischemic etiology, statin use, and serum glucose, TFA levels were positively associated with interleukin (IL) 1beta (difference from mean: 0.38 pg/mL; percentage difference from mean: 66%; P=0.04), IL-1 receptor antagonist (4033 pg/mL; 297%; P=0.006), IL-6 (9.5 pg/mL; 123%; P=0.006), IL-10 (241 pg/mL; 183%; P=0.02), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha (256 pg/mL; 249%; P=0.02), TNF receptor 1 (537 pg/mL; 41%; P=0.03), TNF receptor 2 (39 242 pg/mL; 247%; P=0.001), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (117 pg/mL; 119%; P=0.004), and brain natriuretic peptide (40 pg/mL; 57%; P=0.04). Further adjustments for other patient characteristics did not significantly alter the results.",

    "127": "Nephrotic syndrome (N-S) is associated with elevated plasma concentration and impaired clearance of VLDL, chylomicrons (CM), and their atherogenic remnants. These abnormalities are largely due to lipoprotein lipase, hepatic triglyceride lipase, and VLDL receptor deficiencies and impaired HDL-mediated shuttling of apoE and apoC between the nascent and remnant VLDL and CM. LRP is a multifaceted endocytic receptor that is heavily expressed in the liver. LRP recognizes at least 30 different ligands including VLDL and CM remnants. These observations prompted the present study to discern the effect of N-S on hepatic LRP gene and protein expressions. The study further sought to explore the effect of lipid-lowering therapy on LRP expression in N-S. Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to the N-S (given ip injections of puromycin aminonucleoside; 130 mg/kg on day 1, 60 mg/kg on day 14) and placebo-injected control groups. On day 14, animals were subdivided into statin-treated (rosuvastatin; 20 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) mixed with powdered chow) and untreated groups and studied on day 28. The untreated N-S group exhibited severe proteinuria, hypoalbuminemia, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and marked elevation of hepatic tissue LRP mRNA and protein abundance. Statin administration for 2 wk resulted in significant improvements of plasma lipid profile, proteinuria, and hypoalbuminemia as well as hepatic LRP mRNA and protein abundance. In contrast, statin administration had no significant effect on either plasma lipids or hepatic LRP levels in the normal control rats. In conclusion, N-S results in marked upregulation of hepatic LRP expression that is partly reversed with statin administration. These findings exclude depressed hepatic LRP expression as the primary cause of elevated plasma lipoprotein remnants in N-S.", 
    "128": "Prospective studies showed plasma high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels to be a powerful predictor of cardiac events. However, the association between hsCRP levels and the extent of coronary stenosis in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) remains controversial. We investigated the association between hsCRP levels and the extent of coronary stenosis in 273 patients undergoing elective coronary angiography. Plasma hsCRP levels were higher in patients with CAD than in those without CAD (0.70 mg/l versus 0.56 mg/l, P < 0.02), but hsCRP levels did not correlate with the number of >50% stenotic vessels and were not a significant factor for CAD. However, after the exclusion of 76 patients taking statins, a step-wise increase in hsCRP levels was found depending on the number of >50% stenotic vessels: 0.50 in CAD(-), 0.68 in 1-vessel, 0.77 in 2-vessel, and 0.88 mg/l in 3-vessel disease (P < 0.01). The hsCRP levels also correlated with the numbers of >50% and >25% stenotic segments (r = 0.30 and 0.32, P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed the hsCRP levels to be a significant factor for CAD. Thus, after the exclusion of patients with statins, plasma hsCRP levels were found to be associated with the presence and extent of coronary stenosis in patients with stable CAD.", 
    "129": "The impact of simvastatin and atorvastatin, two HMG-CoA inhibitors, on plasma HDL-C concentrations has been shown to be inconsistent, simvastatin being reported to induce greater increases in HDL-C than atorvastatin. The physiological mechanisms underlying this diverging effect are still unknown.", 
    "130": "To compare the impact of simvastatin and atorvastatin on apoA-I kinetics in vivo.", 
    "131": "In this double-blind, cross-over study, seven men with relatively low baseline HDL-C were assigned in random order to one of two experimental 8-week treatments (atorvastatin 40 mg or simvastatin 80 mg), each separated by a 6-week washout period. After each phase, apoA-I kinetics were measured using a primed-constant infusion of l-(5,5,5-D3) leucine for 12 h with patients being kept in constant fed, steady state. Isotopic enrichment of apoA-I over time was assessed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and kinetic parameters were calculated by multicompartmental modeling.", 
    "132": "Both treatments reduced plasma LDL-C levels to a similar extent while HDL-C levels remained statistically unchanged after both experimental phases. However, compared to atorvastatin, plasma apoA-I concentrations were significantly higher after treatment with simvastatin (1.33 +/- 0.07 g/L versus 1.23 +/- 0.07 g/L, P = 0.05). Treatment with simvastatin also induced a significant increase in apoA-I production rate compared to atorvastatin (15.2 +/- 3.0 mg/kg/d versus 13.2 +/- 2.6 mg/kg/d, P = 0.05). There was no statistical difference in apoA-1 fractional catabolic rate between simvastatin and atorvastatin (0.26 +/- 0.05 pool/d versus 0.24 +/- 0.04 pool/d).", 
    "133": "These results suggest that the diverging impact of simvastatin and atorvastatin on plasma HDL-C levels in humans may be attributable, at least partly, to a greater production rate of apoA-I with simvastatin.", 
    "134": "Postprandial hyperlipidemia has been linked to premature coronary artery disease (CAD) in fasting normotriglyceridemic patients. We investigated the effects of increasing doses of simvastatin up to 80 mg/day on fasting and postprandial lipoprotein metabolism in 18 normotriglyceridemic patients with premature CAD. Fasting lipoprotein subfractions and cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activity were determined after each 5-week dose titration (0, 20, 40 and 80 mg/day). At baseline and after treatment with simvastatin 80 mg/day, standardised Vitamin A oral fat loading tests (50 g/m2; 10 h) were carried out. Ten normolipidemic healthy control subjects matched for gender, age and BMI underwent tests without medication. Treatment with simvastatin resulted in dose-dependent reductions of fasting LDL-cholesterol, without changing cholesterol levels in the VLDL-1, VLDL-2 and IDL fractions. In addition, simvastatin decreased CETP activity dose-dependently, although HDL-cholesterol remained unchanged. Simvastatin 80 mg/day decreased fasting plasma triglycerides (TG) by 26% (P < 0.05), but did not decrease significantly TG levels in any of the subfractions. The TG/cholesterol ratio increased in all subfractions. The plasma TG response to the oral fat loading test, estimated as area under the curve (TG-AUC), improved by 30% (from 21.5 +/- 2.5 to 15.1 +/- 1.9 mmol h/L; P < 0.01). Treatment with simvastatin 80 mg/day improved chylomicron remnant clearance (RE-AUC) by 36% from 30.0 +/- 2.6 to 19.2 +/- 3.3 mg h/L (P < 0.01). After therapy, remnant clearance in patients was similar to controls (19.2 +/- 3.3 and 20.3 +/- 2.7 mg h/L, respectively), suggesting a normalization of this potentially atherogenic process. In conclusion, high-dose simvastatin has beneficial effects in normotriglyceridemic patients with premature CAD, due to improved chylomicron remnant clearance, besides effective lowering of LDL-cholesterol. In addition, the lipoprotein subfractions became more cholesterol-poor, as reflected by the increased TG/cholesterol ratio, which potentially makes them less atherogenic.",

Interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma, 1000 U/ml) increased SPIO uptake to 163% of control, P < 0.05. Interleukin-4 (IL-4, 40 ng/ml) also increased uptake (178% of control, P < 0.04). In cells incubated with SPIO in the absence of serum proteins, SPIO uptake fell to 57% of control (P < 0.001).",

    "142": "Ezetimibe is a new cholesterol absorption inhibitor that selectively inhibits dietary and biliary cholesterol absorption from the intestine. This drug inhibits cholesterol absorption without affecting the absorption of triglycerides, biliary salts and fat-soluble vitamins. Inhibition of cholesterol absorption using ezetimibe 10 mg/day alone resulted in substantial reductions of plasma LDL-C concentrations (approximately 18%). Coadministration of ezetimibe 10 mg/day with statins 10 mg/day showed LDL lowering comparable to or greater than that of the highest dose of the respective statin alone. Combination therapy of ezetimibe with statins helped more patients in achieving their target LDL-C goal. Ezetimibe in coadministration with statins or alone had also favourable effects on triglycerides and HDL. In clinical studies, ezetimibe alone or coadministered with a statin was shown to have a safety profile (asymptomatic mild increases in aminotransferase levels, without evidence of rhabdomyolysis) similar to placebo or to the statin alone. Large clinical studies on clinical endpoints are in progress.", 
    "143": "Atherosclerosis and its complications represent the most frequent cause of death in the developed countries. Pathophysiology of the atherosclerosis development has been described in details. Much less is known what is the extent of reversibility of pathophysiological changes. Several angiographic studies have proved that statin administration can slow down the progression of the coronary arteries atherosclerosis. However, only intravascular ultrasound analysis is able to give a detailed description of atherosclerotic plaque development during the treatment with statins. Studies have shown apparent stagnation of atherosclerosis progression and in voluminous plaques also signs of regression. Beside changes in the size of atherosclerotic plaques, alteration in their chemical composition was described. During the treatment with statins, amount of lipids in plaque decreases, which indicates the stabilisation of plaques. Plaques are less prone to a rupture and to the subsequent development of an acute coronary syndrome. Beside statins, which influence namely LDL cholesterol, attention is given to drugs enabling to elevate HDL cholesterol level, because it is the way in which cholesterol is transported from tissues back to the liver. It appears that elevation of HDL cholesterol level could bring about more effective regression of atherosclerotic plaques and together with stagnation of the plaque progression it can significantly improve the conservative methods in the treatment of atherosclerotic disease of the coronary and peripheral arterial system.", 
    "144": "The objective of the study was to evaluate the efficiency of lovastatin correction of dyslipidemia and impaired intravascular platelet activity (IPA) in patients with arterial hypertension (AH) concurrent with metabolic syndrome (MS). Eighteen patients were given lovastatin for a month. The time course of changes in anthropometric parameters, blood lipid spectrum, plasma and lipid peroxidation, antioxidative protectiveness of the liquid blood part and platelets, and IPA were assessed. The results were processed by Student's test and correlation analysis. Lovastin was ascertained to correct dyslipoproteinemia and peroxidation syndrome and to optimize the intrathrombocytic mechanisms responsible for their function regulation in patients with AH + MS. Lovastatin inhibits in vivo increased platelet activity. These effects may be stabilized during its use. Body weight loss and diminished insulin resistance in patients with AH concurrent MS require long use of lovastatin along with low-calorie diet and exercises.",

Following extraction, enzyme assays involving recombinant farnesyl protein transferase or geranylgeranyl protein transferase I are performed to conjugate FPP or GGPP to dansylated peptides. The reaction products are then separated and quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to a fluorescence detector at the excitation wavelength 335 nm and the emission wavelength 528 nm. The retention times for farnesyl-peptide and geranylgeranyl-peptide are 8.4 and 16.9 min, respectively. The lower limit of detection is 5 pg of FPP or GGPP ( approximately 0.01 pmol). A linear response has been established over a range of 5-1000 pg ( approximately 0.01-2 pmol) with good reproducibility. The method has been used to determine the levels of FPP (0.125+/-0.010 pmol/10(6)cells) and GGPP (0.145+/-0.008 pmol/10(6)cells) in NIH3T3 cells.

Analysis of the structural features common to CYP2C8 substrates exhibiting a micromolar K(m) led to a substrate pharmacophore in which the site of oxidation by CYP2C8 is 12.9, 8.6, 4.4, and 3.9 A from features that could establish ionic or hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic interactions with protein amino acid residues. Comparison of this pharmacophore with a 3D model of CYP2C8 constructed using the X-ray structure of CYP2C5 suggested potential CYP2C8 amino acid residues that could be involved in substrate recognition. Twenty CYP2C8 site-directed mutants were constructed and expressed in yeast to compare their catalytic activities using five CYP2C8 substrates that exhibit different structures and sizes [paclitaxel, fluvastatin, retinoic acid, a sulfaphenazole derivative (DMZ), and diclofenac]. Mutation of arginine 241 had marked effects on the hydroxylation of anionic substrates of CYP2C8 such as retinoic acid and fluvastatin. Serine 100 appears to be involved in hydrogen bonding interactions with a polar site of the CYP2C8 substrate pharmacophore, as shown by the 3-4-fold increase in the K(m) of paclitaxel and DMZ hydroxylation after the S100A mutation. Residues 114, 201, and 205 are predicted to be in close contact with substrates, and their mutations lead either to favorable hydrophobic interactions or to steric clashes with substrates. For instance, the S114F mutant was unable to catalyze the 6alpha-hydroxylation of paclitaxel. The S114F and F205A mutants were the best catalysts for retinoic acid and paclitaxel (or fluvastatin) hydroxylation, respectively, with k(cat)/K(m) values 5 and 2.1 (or 2.4) times higher, respectively, than those found for CYP2C8. Preliminary experiments of docking of the substrate into the experimentally determined X-ray structure of substrate-free CYP2C8, which became available quite recently [Schoch, G. A., et al. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 9497], were consistent with key roles for S100, S114, and F205 residues in substrate binding. The results suggest that the effects of mutation of arginine 241 on anionic substrate hydroxylation could be indirect and result from alterations of the packing of helix G with helix B'.", 
    "152": "A reduced HDL-Cholersterol and increased triglyzerides are an often seen laboratory abnormality. They are known risk factors for arteriosclerosis. However the small influence of a pharamcologic treatment on the two reduced the interest in them. We therefore want to show the relation of the triglyzerides with the HDL-Cholesterol and the nonpharmacologic treatment of these two factors. Some clinical examples are illustrating the topic.", 
    "153": "Familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL) patients have an impaired catabolism of postprandial triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoproteins (TRLs). We investigated whether atorvastatin corrects the delayed clearance of large TRLs in FCHL by evaluating the acute clearance of Intralipid (10%) and TRLs after oral fat-loading tests. Sixteen matched controls were included. Atorvastatin reduced fasting plasma TG (from 3.6 +/- 0.4 to 2.5 +/- 0.3 mM; mean +/- SEM) without major effects on fasting apolipoprotein B48 (apoB48) and apoB100 in large TRLs. Atorvastatin significantly reduced fasting intermediate density lipoprotein (Svedberg flotation, 12-20)-apoB100 concentrations. After Intralipid, TG in plasma and TRL showed similar kinetics in FCHL before and after atorvastatin treatment, although compared with controls, the clearance of large TRLs was only significantly slower in untreated FCHL, suggesting an improvement by atorvastatin. Investigated with oral fat-loading tests, the clearance of very low density lipoprotein (Sf20-60)-apoB100 improved by 24%, without major changes in the other fractions. The most striking effects of atorvastatin on postprandial lipemia in FCHL were on hepatic TRL, without major improvements on intestinal TRLs. Fasting plasma TG should be reduced more aggressively in FCHL to overcome the lipolytic disturbance causing delayed clearance of postprandial TRLs.", 
    "154": "Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disorder, and the inflammation associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) accelerates the development of atherosclerosis. Nitric oxide (NO) is an important mediator of inflammation including the inflammation associated with atherosclerosis and SLE. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (NOS3)-mediated constitutive expression of NO promotes endothelial integrity and normal vascular function. In contrast, inducible nitric oxide synthase- (NOS2) mediated expression of NO promotes endothelial dysfunction and atherogenesis. Statins appear to have anti-inflammatory properties and reverse many of the deleterious effects associated with NO metabolism in atherosclerosis. Statins augment NOS3 expression and inhibit the induction of NOS2. Therefore, the balance between normal vascular function and atherogenesis may be mediated by differences in the quantity, location, and timing of NO production within vessel walls.", 
    "155": "Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) have been linked with potential chemopreventive effects; however, the data are conflicting. We conducted a population-based cohort study using data from the Prescription Database of North Jutland County and the Danish Cancer Registry for the period 1989-2002. In a study population of 334,754 county residents, we compared overall and site-specific cancer incidence among 12,251 statin users (> or =2 prescriptions) with cancer incidence among nonusers and users of other lipid-lowering drugs (n = 1,257). Statistical analyses were based on age-standardization and Poisson regression analysis, adjusting for age, gender, calendar period and use of NSAIDs, hormone replacement therapy and cardiovascular drugs. We identified 398 cancer cases among statin users during a mean follow-up period of 3.3 years (range 0-14 years). The age- and gender-standardized incidence rates of cancer overall were 596 per 100,000 person-years among statin users, 645 per 100,000 person-years among nonusers and 795 per 100,000 person-years among users of other lipid-lowering drugs. Adjusted rate ratios for cancer overall among statin users were 0.86 (95% CI, 0.78-0.95) compared to nonusers and 0.73 (95% CI, 0.55-0.98) compared to users of other lipid-lowering drugs. No significantly increased or decreased rate ratios were observed for any of the studied site-specific cancers (liver, colorectum, lung, breast, prostate, female genital organs and lymphatic and haematopoietic tissue), but most estimates tended to be less than 1.0. Stratification by duration of follow-up or number of prescriptions revealed no clear trends. In summary, individuals prescribed statins experienced a slightly reduced cancer incidence compared to population controls of nonusers and users of other lipid-lowering drugs. Larger and longer-term studies are needed to determine the potentially protective effect of statin use on cancer development.", 
    "156": "Endothelial dysfunction has been shown to be a critical early component of organ injury after myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. Circulating levels of adhesion molecules have been regarded as a valid index of endothelial activation. Recent reports suggest that statins, widely used in the control of hypercholesterolemia, exert a protective effect on the endothelium reflected by a reduced level of circulating adhesion molecules. In this study, the effects of preoperative simvastatin treatment, at doses equivalent to those used orally for cholesterol control, were studied on plasma levels of VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and ELAM-1.",

In the late postoperative samples, the plasma levels of ICAM-1 and ELAM-1 were lower in both simvastatin-treated patients compared with the control patients. No significant difference was found between the patients responsive to statin and those not responsive. Finally, no significant difference was found for VCAM-1 plasma levels between the control group and the 2 treatment groups.",

    "162": "Recent studies suggest that statins and beta-blockers which are widely prescribed for the treatment of hyperlipidemia and hypertension play an important role in bone metabolism. Statins inhibit HMG-CoA reductase and its down-stream mevalonate pathway. They modulate osteoclastic and osteoblastic activity, since metabolites of mevalonate are critically involved in bone cell biology. Sympathetic nervous system also controls bone formation via its direct effects on osteoblasts. Administration of beta-blockers may lead to an increase bone mass and reduce the risk of fracture. Statins and beta-blockers could have anabolic effects on bone metabolism and may be potential therapeutic implications for osteoporosis.", 
    "163": "Statins are cholesterol-lowering drugs as they inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, which is a rate limiting enzyme in the mevalonate pathway. Recently, mevalonate metabolites are also shown to play pivotal roles in the regulation of generation and function of osteoclasts and osteoblasts. However, there have been great controversies in effects of statins on bone metabolism, especially that on osteoporotic fractures in human. Here we briefly review the role of statins in bone metabolism through the survey of clinical observations.", 
    "164": "Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMP) are cytokines that promote differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into differentiated osteoblasts and bone formation. Recently, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) emerged as a candidate for the treatment of osteoporosis, because they stimulate BMP-2 expression and bone formation. Inhibition of Rho/Rho-kinase pathway may be involved in statin effect on bone formation.",

In this review, roles of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in bone are discussed.

Moreover, I have mentioned the presence of bone-like tissue in atherosclerotic plaque.", 
    "166": "3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) are widely used for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Recent studies reveal that statins stimulate the bone formation, presumably through increasing the production of BMP-2, an important differentiation factor of osteoblast. Most, but not all, observational studies show that statin use is associated with a reduced rate of fracture. Randomized controlled trials are needed to judge the prophylactic effects of statins on fracture and their beneficial effects on surrogate markers for fracture, such as bone mass and bone turnover.",

However, there have been great controversies in effects of statins on bone in human. Here we review the role of statins in bone metabolism, mainly focusing on clinical observations.", 
    "168": "Statins are currently approved for reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases, clinically. These evidences were thought to be due to the lipid-lowering effects of the statins.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the apoB/apoA-I ratio was superior to any of the cholesterol ratios - total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (TC/HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)/HDL-C and non-HDL-C/HDL-C - in predicting the risk of coronary disease. Moreover, we examined whether any lipids, lipoproteins or cholesterol ratios add significant predictive information beyond that provided by the apoB/apoA-I ratio.",

    "171": "High apoB and a high apoB/apoA-I ratio were strongly related to increased coronary risk, while high apoA-I was inversely related to risk. The apoB/apoA-I ratio was superior to any of the cholesterol ratios in predicting risk. This advantage was most pronounced in subjects with LDL-C levels <3.6 mmol/l. Addition of lipids, lipoproteins or any cholesterol ratio to apoB/apoA-I in risk models did not further improve the strong predictive value of apoB/apoA-I.", 
    "172": "These results indicate that the apoB/apoA-I ratio is at present the best single lipoprotein-related variable to quantitate coronary risk. Given the additional advantages apolipoproteins possess - fasting samples are not required, apoB/apoA-I is a better index of the adequacy of statin therapy than LDL-C, and the measurement of apoB and apoA-I are standardized, whereas LDL-C and HDL-C are not - there would appear to be considerable advantage to integrating apolipoproteins into clinical practice.", 
    "173": "Oxidative stress and dyslipidaemia play an important role in the development of diabetes-induced vascular complications. The aim of this study was to examine the reversal effects of simvastatin on some metabolic and oxidative parameters, and vascular functions in diabetic rats. Diabetes was induced by a single injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 45 mg/kg, i.p.). Eight weeks after STZ induction, some of the diabetic and control rats were treated with simvastatin (10 mg/kg rat/d) for 4 weeks. Plasma glucose, triglyceride and total cholesterol concentrations were significantly increased in 12-week diabetic rats. Simvastatin treatment stopped the loss of body weight, completely normalized the increase of plasma lipids and partially reduced the hyperglycaemia in diabetic rats. Increased malondialdehyde levels, catalase and glutathione peroxidase activities were normalised by simvastatin treatment in diabetic aorta. Phenylephrine (PE)-induced contractility in aorta rings was unaffected by diabetes, but was markedly decreased after simvastatin treatment in both control and diabetic rats. Reduction of endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation in diabetes was significantly ameliorated by simvastatin treatment. Incubation of aorta rings with lysophosphatidylcholine, a component of the oxidized LDL, did not significantly affect PE-induced contractions, but reduced endothelium-dependent relaxations more in untreated-diabetic rats than in other experimental groups. The endothelium-independent vasorelaxations were similar in all ring preparations. These results indicate that simvastatin treatment may ameliorate diabetes-induced abnormal vasoconstriction and endothelial dysfunction via affecting general and oxidizing metabolism, nitric oxide disability and intracellular calcium mobilisation."
