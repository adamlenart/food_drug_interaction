We sought to understand the mechanism underlying such protection and hypothesized that simvastatin would be protective in mice against acute infection with Staphylococcus aureus, the primary etiologic agent in sepsis. Mice were treated with simvastatin or buffer for two weeks and were subsequently challenged with S. aureus intratracheally or intravenously. Relative to buffer-treated mice, bacterial killing was enhanced 4-fold (p=0.02), systemic dissemination was reduced, and lethality was decreased (hazard ratio 8.8, 95% CI 2.5 to 31.3, p=0.001) in mice that were pretreated with simvastatin for two weeks. Systemic inflammatory response was abrogated and the local elaboration of inflammatory mediators was diminished. Serum concentrations of pro-fibrinolytic protein C were elevated (p=0.034), while the concentration of pro-coagulant tissue factor in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids was attenuated (reduced 25%), p=0.001, in simvastatin-treated mice. Taken together, these data indicate that extended treatment with simvastatin is protective during infection with S. aureus through enhanced bacterial clearance, anti-inflammatory, and anti-coagulant activities. These studies provide insights into the mechanism by which statins confer protection in acute infection, support the notion that statins may be effective adjuncts in the treatment of sepsis, and provide a rationale for randomized control trials in patients that are at a high risk for infection characterized by coagulopathy.",

The crude incidence density rate of AMD among patients at the lowest quintile of persistence with statins (7.18 per 1,000) was comparable to that of highest persistence quintile (7.13 per 1,000). After adjustment for potential confounders, patients in the highest quintile of persistence with statins had a hazard ratio of 0.99 (95% Confidence Interval: 0.78-1.26) for AMD compared with patients in the lowest proportion of days covered (PDC) quintile. In addition to age, AMD was found to associate with past smoking, asthma, diabetes and frequent visits to ophthalmologists or primary physicians prior to index date.",

In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which atorvastatin inhibits renal crystal retention. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were separated into four experimental groups, and the ethylene glycol model of hyperoxaluria and the atorvastatin treatment model were analyzed. To clarify the mechanism by which atorvastatin inhibits renal crystal retention, the removed kidneys were used for the quantitative analysis of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase. The subunits of the NADPH oxidase system were evaluated using real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis. Furthermore, the level of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) in kidney tissue was compared in each group. Atorvastatin treatment increased the SOD and catalase level compared with the stone-forming control group. Atorvastatin treatment decreased the expression of NOX-1 mRNA. Furthermore, the level of TGF-\u03b2 was suppressed by atorvastatin treatment. We found that atorvastatin have inhibited calcium oxalate (CaOX) urolithiasis formation. We hypothesize that the mechanism of action of atorvastatin involves inhibiting TGF-\u03b2 and NADPH oxidase, and increasing the SOD and catalase level. We believe that atorvastatin will be helpful in the treatment of CaOX urolithiasis.", 
    "11": "Atherothrombosis remains one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality in the western countries. Human atherothrombotic disease begins early in life in relation to circulating lipid retention in the inner vascular wall. Risk factors enhance the progression towards clinical expression: dyslipidaemia, diabetes, smoking, hypertension, ageing, etc. The evolution from the initial lipid retention in the arterial wall to clinical events is a continuum of increasingly complex biological processes. Current strategies to fight the consequences of atherothrombosis are orientated either towards the promotion of a healthy life style and preventive treatment of risk factors, or towards late interventional strategies. Despite this therapeutic arsenal, the incidence of clinical events remains dramatically high, dependent, at least in part, on the increasing frequency of type 2 diabetes and ageing. But some medical treatments, focusing only on prevention of the metabolic risk, have failed to reduce cardiovascular mortality, thus illustrating that our understanding of the pathophysiology of human atherothrombosis leading to clinical events remain incomplete. New paradigms are now emerging which may give rise to novel experimental strategies to improve therapeutic efficacy and prediction of disease progression. Recent studies strengthen the concept that the intraplaque neovascularization and bleeding (Figure 1, upper panel) are events that could play a major role in plaque progression and leucocyte infiltration, and may also serve as a measure of risk for the development of future events. The recent advances in our understanding of IntraPlaque Hemorrhage as a critical event in triggering acute clinical events have important implications for clinical research and possibly future clinical practice.",

Because BRAF(V600E) mutant may be responsible for cetuximab resistance in KRAS wild-type cells, we measured the growth of xenograft tumors originating from KRAS mutant and BRAF mutant cells in mice treated with cetuximab alone or plus simvastatin (n = 5 mice per treatment group).

It usually begins in early adulthood and demonstrates a chronic course. In recent years research interest has turned to the increased burden of somatic illness in schizophrenia, with special emphasis on metabolic syndrome and diabetes. In this article I review the theoretical and practical aspects of the comorbidity of schizophrenia with metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus. Epidemiological studies demonstrate the occurrence of metabolic syndrome between 22% and 66%, while the prevalence of diabetes is at least threefold compared to the non-psychiatric population in all age groups. Etiologically it is not clear to what extent these alterations are caused by direct genetic and biological effects in contrast to environmental factors. Among the latter the role of atypical antipsychotics should be emphasized. Clinical management of prediabetic conditions and diabetes in schizophrenia warrants the close cooperation of professionals working in the areas of psychiatry and diabetology. This cooperation should include close metabolic monitoring, lifestyle and dietary training, moreover careful modification and in some cases switching of antipsychotic medication. Persisting metabolic symptoms or diabetes require treatment with oral antidiabetics, fibrates, and statins.",

    "22": "Ezetimibe (Zetia(\u00ae), Ezetrol(\u00ae), Merck, Whitehouse Station, NJ) is a potent inhibitor of sterol absorption, which selectively blocks the uptake of biliary and dietary cholesterol in the small intestine. Clinical trials have demonstrated the beneficial effects of ezetimibe on the reduction of atherogenic lipoproteins and the attainment of guideline-recommended lipid levels. Direct evidence that these improvements translate to a reduction in atherosclerosis or cardiovascular events is limited, although reductions in major atherosclerotic events that are consistent with the LDL-C lowering achieved have recently been presented for patients with chronic kidney disease treated with ezetimibe/simvastatin 10/20mg in the SHARP trial. Animal models of atherosclerosis have played a central role in defining the mechanisms involved in initiation and development of disease and have been used in drug development to evaluate potential therapeutic efficacy. The effect of ezetimibe on atherosclerosis has been examined in several of these animal model systems. ApoE knockout mice develop severe hypercholesterolemia and premature atherosclerosis with features similar to that seen in humans and techniques ranging from gross visualization of plaque to high-resolution MRI have demonstrated the consistent ability of ezetimibe to significantly inhibit atherosclerosis. sr-b1(-/-)/apoE(-/-) double knockout mice exhibit additional characteristics common to human coronary heart disease (CHD), and the one study of ezetimibe in sr-b1(-/-)/apoE(-/-) mice showed a significant reduction in aortic sinus plaque (57%), coronary arterial occlusion (68%), myocardial fibrosis (57%), and cardiomegaly (12%) compared with untreated controls. The effects of ezetimibe have also been evaluated in ldlr(-/-)/apoE(-/-) double knockout mice, demonstrating that functional LDL receptors were not required for ezetimibe-mediated reduction of plasma cholesterol or atherosclerosis. For the few studies that have been conducted in rabbits, ezetimibe has been shown to significantly inhibit diet and vascular-injury-induced atherosclerosis as measured by intima/media thickness, atherosclerotic lesion composition, and thrombosis. The current body of preclinical evidence consistently demonstrates that ezetimibe reduces atherosclerosis in animals, presumably due primarily to the decrease in circulating levels of atherogenic lipoproteins that the drug produces. Demonstration that ezetimibe-mediated lowering of atherogenic lipoproteins in humans has a similar effect on atherosclerosis and cardiovascular risk awaits additional results from recently completed and ongoing outcomes trials.", 
    "23": "In surgical patients, statins have been shown to have beneficial effects independent of the lipid-lowering properties. Statin use has not been well studied in the bariatric patient. The objective of this study was to characterize the use of statins in the bariatric surgery patient and compare outcomes, including complications, weight loss, and changes in comorbidities. A retrospective chart review of patients undergoing bariatric surgery between 2005 and 2008 was conducted. Four hundred forty surgical patients charts were reviewed, of which 151 (34%) were taking a perioperative statin. The two groups were similar in length of stay, baseline body mass index, type of procedure, smoking status, and hospital charges. However, the statin group was older, more likely male, and with more baseline comorbidities, including hypertension (HTN), hyperlipidemia (HLD), diabetes mellitus (DM), coronary artery disease, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). There was no statistical significance noted in the any complication or death. There was no difference in weight loss over time between the two groups. The statin group was more likely to report resolution in HLD (27.5 vs 9.5%, P = 0.004), but not DM, HTN, or OSA. In summary, there are differences in bariatric patients who take statins compared with their counterparts. Statins with gastric bypass may improve resolution of HLD, which may eventually alter long-term cardiac risk in these patients.",

    "33": "The xenobiotic response represents a complex group of chemical reactions aimed to inactivate and eliminate foreign chemicals, to antagonize their toxic effects, and to repair eventually damaged tissues. Intriguingly, xenobiotic response is also active against endogenous products of metabolism. Members of the nuclear receptor superfamily play a key role in xenobiotic detection and response. In particular, the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and the pregnane X receptor (PXR) are transcription factors activated by a variety of endogenous and exogenous ligands. However, high affinity endogenous ligand for CAR or PXR is not known, therefore these NRs have been put in the class of \"orphan receptors\". Both CAR and PXR elevate the expression of the detoxification machinery in the presence of endogenous and exogenous ligands, regulating the expression of Phase I and II metabolizing enzymes and of phase III transporters. Unfortunately, prescription drugs are included in the list of xenobiotic recognized by CAR and PXR. Among others, statins represent a good example of CAR- and PXR-mediated drug metabolism. Indeed statins, the most effective and prescribed cholesterol-lowering drugs, are target of xenobiotic response mediated by CAR and PXR. Here, we review the structural and molecular bases of CAR- and PXR-mediated drug response highlighting how these mechanisms could impact on statin metabolism. Moreover, the alteration of statin pharmacodynamics and/or pharmacokinetics induced by concomitant drug treatment or dietary factors will be also examined.",

Determined that some patients with resistant to statins hypercholesteremia and normal or elevated levels of hormones T3 and T4 in the blood have isolated symptoms of hypothyroidism, which may be a manifestation of reducing tissue sensitivity to thyroid hormones. Adding to the statins levothyroxine in daily doses of 25-50 mkg have additional cholesterol reducing action, allowing to achieve target levels of lipoprotein in blood in patients.

The associated severe side-effects of these statins led us to explore the therapeutic potentials of naturally occurring Tocomin (mixture of dietary \u03b1-, \u03b2-, \u03b3- and \u03b4-tocotrienols). Tocomin (10\u2009mg) was orally administered daily for 10\u2009days before and 12\u2009h after bacterial lipopolysaccharide (200 \u03bcg) or 24\u2009h after zymosan (20 mg) or turpentine (0.5\u2009mL) to Syrian hamsters. The data showed that Tocomin significantly reduced the levels of plasma and lipoprotein lipids, cholesterol, apoB, small dense (sd)-LDL as well as LDL in the hyperlipidemia-induced hamsters. Further, the mechanism of action of \u03b1-, \u03b2-, \u03b3- and \u03b4-tocotrienols was validated by docking studies with HMG-CoA reductase enzyme using the Molegro Virtual Docker. The inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase predicted in terms of MolDockScore and interaction energy suggest the comparative potential in the descending order: Atorvastatin > Fluvastatin ~ \u03b4 > \u03b3 > \u03b2 > \u03b1. The results favor the daily intake of naturally occurring tocotrienols as dietary supplement in the prevention and treatment of infection/inflammation induced dyslipidemia compared with the hypolipidemic drugs.", 
    "40": "Emerging evidence suggests apolipoprotein B (apoB) and apolipoprotein AI (apoAI) are strong risk predictors for atherosclerosis. Non-human primates (NHP), including rhesus monkeys, cynomolgus monkeys, and African green monkeys, are important preclinical species for studying dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis as they more closely resemble humans in lipid metabolism and disease physiology compared to lower species such as rodents. However, no commercial assays are currently available for measuring apoB and apoAI in NHP. We therefore evaluated analytical methods for routinely measuring apoB and apoAI in our NHP dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis research. Since NHP apoB and apoAI sequences are likely highly similar to human, we focused on the clinically validated and widely utilized human apoB and apoAI immunoturbidity assays. We carried out technical validation of these assays with NHP samples and leveraged orthogonal technical platforms including mass spectrometry, independent ELISA assay, and absolute quantitation via SDS-PAGE for further characterization. Analysis of purified lipoproteins demonstrated that the immunoturbidity assays detect NHP apoAI and apoB, with good dilution linearity and spike recovery from NHP plasma. Orthogonal studies showed apoAI correlated with protein concentration and apoB levels correlated with LC/MS and an independent ELISA. NHP samples from a drug treatment study were analyzed with the immunoturbidity assays and levels of apoB and apoAI fit our understanding of biology and expectations from literature. These studies serve as important technical and biological validation of the immunoturbidity assays for NHP samples, and demonstrate that these assays provide a high-throughput, fully automated analytical platform for NHP samples. Our studies pave the way for future translational research in NHP for developing therapies for treating dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis.",

Serum total cholesterol and LDL have been linked to the development of atherosclerosis and progression to CHD in the general population. However, the reductions of total and LDL cholesterol in the dialysis population have not demonstrated the ability to reduce the morbidity, mortality, and cost burden associated with CHD. The patients at greatest risk include those with pre-existing CHD, a CHD-risk equivalent, or multiple risk factors. However, data in the dialysis population are much less impressive, and the relationship between plasma cholesterol, cholesterol reduction, use of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase, and reduction in incidence of CHD or effect on progression of renal disease have not been proven. Adverse event information from published trials indicates that agents within this class share similar tolerability and adverse event profiles. Hepatic transaminase elevations may occur in 1 to 2% of patients and is dose related. Myalgia, myopathy, and rhabodmyolysis occur infrequently and are more common in kidney transplant patients and patients with CKD. This effect appears to be dose related and may be precipitated by administration with agents that inhibit cytochrome P-450 isoenzymes. Caution should be exercised when coadministering any statin with drugs that metabolize through cytochrome P-450 IIIA-4 in particular fibrates, cyclosporine, and azole antifungals. Elderly patients with CKD are at greater risk of adverse drug reactions, and therefore the lowest possible dose of statins should be used for the treatment of hyperlipidemia.",

    "50": "Familial hypercholesterolemia, which arises as a result of a mutation in the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene, is characterized by elevated levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), regardless of dietary and lifestyle modifications. Pharmacological therapy is often required to adequately control the elevated LDL-C levels associated with familial hypercholesterolemia. However, children with this genetic condition present many challenges for physicians, who must weigh the benefits of lipid-lowering therapy against the risks associated with the various treatment options. Furthermore, because familial hypercholesterolemia is a chronic condition, children will likely require long-term lipid-lowering therapy. As such, the potential effect of pharmacological treatment on development is of paramount importance in this population. Bile acid sequestrants represent a unique treatment option for children with familial hypercholesterolemia in that these agents are not systemically absorbed but rather exert their lipid-lowering effects via binding to bile acids within the gastrointestinal tract. A literature search was performed to identify clinical data related to the use of bile acid sequestrant therapy in children (< 18 years of age) with familial hypercholesterolemia. Studies published in English between 1990 and December 2010 that were retrieved from MEDLINE and EMBASE were included in this systematic review. In total, five clinical studies were identified that evaluated bile acid sequestrant monotherapy, whereas two studies were identified that evaluated combination therapy with a bile acid sequestrant and low-dose statin. This review summarizes the clinical data regarding the efficacy and safety of bile acid sequestrants in this specialized population.", 
    "51": "Multidrug therapy increases the risk for drug-drug interactions. Clopidogrel, a prodrug, requires hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) metabolic activation to produce the active metabolite that inhibits the platelet P2Y\u2081\u2082 adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor, decreasing platelet activation and aggregation processes. Atorvastatin, omeprazole, and several other drugs have been shown in pharmacodynamic studies to competitively inhibit CYP activation of clopidogrel, reducing clopidogrel responsiveness. Conversely, other agents increase clopidogrel responsiveness by inducing CYP activity. The clinical implications of these pharmacodynamic interactions have raised concern because many of these drugs are coadministered to patients with coronary artery disease. There are multiple challenges in proving that a pharmacodynamic drug-drug interaction is clinically significant. To date, there is no consistent evidence that clopidogrel-drug interactions impact adverse cardiovascular events. Statins and proton pump inhibitors have been shown to decrease adverse clinical event rates and should not be withheld from patients with appropriate indications for therapy because of concern about potential clopidogrel-drug interactions. Clinicians concerned about clopidogrel-drug interactions have the option of prescribing either an alternative platelet P2Y\u2081\u2082 receptor inhibitor without known drug interactions, or statin and gastro-protective agents that do not interfere with clopidogrel metabolism.",

One hundred and four patients with isolated primary hypercholesterolemia were randomized to one of four treatment groups, simultaneously treated for 90 days with ezetimibe (10 mg daily), simvastatin (40 mg daily), ezetimibe (10 mg daily) plus simvastatin (40 mg daily), or placebo. Plasma lipids/lipoproteins and hemostatic cardiovascular risk factors were assessed on the day of randomization and after 30 and 90 days of therapy. Despite improving lipid/lipoprotein profile by both simvastatin and ezetimibe, only simvastatin reduced plasma levels/activity of fibrinogen, factor VII, factor X, von Willebrand factor, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1. The strongest effects on plasma lipids/lipoproteins and the assessed hemostatic variables were observed when patients were treated with both simvastatin and ezetimibe. With the exception of oxidized low-density lipoproteins, the hemostatic effects of simvastatin or simvastatin plus ezetimibe did not correlate with the changes in plasma lipids/lipoproteins. Our study shows that simvastatin is a more effective agent than ezetimibe in affecting coagulation and fibrinolysis in individuals with isolated hypercholesterolemia. It also suggests that the combined administration of simvastatin and ezetimibe may bring more benefits to patients than monotherapy with only one of these agents.",

The yellow pigments in RMR, namely, monascin (MS) and ankaflavin (AK), have been reported to exhibit antimetastatic and antiangiogenic activities. Currently, MK and these yellow pigments are usually detected in RMR by different analytical methods that are inconvenient, expensive, and time-consuming. The goal of this study was to establish a rapid, synchronous analytical method for determination of the MKA, MKL, MS, AK, and CT levels in RMR. MKA, MKL, MS, AK, and CT were extracted by the same extraction method, then separated by RP-HPLC with a C18 column. The effluent from the column was passed through a photodiode array detector and then introduced directly into a fluorescence detector. The results showed that high recovery rates of MKA, MKL, MS, AK, and CT are possible if RMR powder is extracted with 75% ethanol (10 mL) at 80 degrees C for 30 min. With regard to the optimal conditions of the HPLC, the peaks of MKA, MKL, MS, AK, and CT can be clearly separated from any noise peaks by isocratic elution with a mobile phase comprising 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in acetonitrile-water (62.5 + 37.5, v/v).",

This case-control study was designed to assess the associations between cutaneous melanoma (CM) and exposure to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and statins in current users. A total of 400 CM and 600 eligible age- and gender-matched community-based controls were prospectively recruited and interviewed. We assessed participants' demographic characteristics, CM risk factors, and current and previous use of medications. Multivariable conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations between NSAIDs and/or aspirin (ASA), statin exposure, and CM risk. Half of the subjects were men (mean age 60 years). After adjusting for confounders, use of any type of NSAIDs for more than 5 years significantly reduced the risk of melanoma development compared with the low-exposure group (adjusted OR=0.57; 95% CI=0.43-0.77). Subgroup analyses showed that the observed risk reduction was primarily driven by continuous ASA use (>5 years adjusted OR=0.51, 95% CI=0.35-0.75). No significant protective effect was observed with statin exposure (OR=0.97, 95% CI=0.73-1.29).

One means of treating PC is identification of small-molecule inhibitors of PC-related keratins. Here, we cloned the human K6a promoter, and using a cell-based reporter gene assay, a chemical library was screened for K6a inhibitors. One compound, compactin, the precursor of all cholesterol-lowering statins, was of particular interest. We found that, surprisingly, simvastatin and other statins inhibit K6a promoter activity and K6a protein expression. Further investigation showed that this effect works through cholesterol/mevalonate pathway inhibition rather than an off-target effect. Inhibition of both basal and IFN-\u03b3-inducible K6a expression by statins was demonstrated. Both these K6a inhibitory effects were found to be mediated by Stat1 transcription factor, but only the IFN-\u03b3-inducible promoter activity was controlled via the Stat/JAK pathway. The repressive effect of statins was found to be mediated by the isoprenoid pathway downstream of mevalonate (the intermediate following 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase) but upstream of cholesterol, specifically the geranylgeranylation pathway. These data set the scene for further unraveling signaling pathways that control the K6a promoter, as well as facilitating clinical trials for statins in PC patients.", 
    "66": "The treatment of chronic illnesses commonly includes the long-term use of pharmacotherapy. Although these medications are effective in combating disease, their full benefits are often not realized because approximately 50% of patients do not take their medications as prescribed. Factors contributing to poor medication adherence are myriad and include those that are related to patients (eg, suboptimal health literacy and lack of involvement in the treatment decision-making process), those that are related to physicians (eg, prescription of complex drug regimens, communication barriers, ineffective communication of information about adverse effects, and provision of care by multiple physicians), and those that are related to health care systems (eg, office visit time limitations, limited access to care, and lack of health information technology). Because barriers to medication adherence are complex and varied, solutions to improve adherence must be multifactorial. To assess general aspects of medication adherence using cardiovascular disease as an example, a MEDLINE-based literature search (January 1, 1990, through March 31, 2010) was conducted using the following search terms: cardiovascular disease, health literacy, medication adherence, and pharmacotherapy.

    "75": "The transporter-mediated uptake of drugs from blood into hepatocytes is a prerequisite for intrahepatic drug action or intracellular drug metabolism before excretion. Therefore, uptake transporters, e.g., members of the organic anion transporting polypeptide (OATP) family are important determinants of drug pharmacokinetics. Highly and almost exclusively expressed in hepatocytes are the OATP family members OATP1B1 (SLCO1B1) and OATP1B3 (SLCO1B3). Drug substrates of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 include antibiotics and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins). It has been demonstrated that administration of two or more drugs that are substrates for these hepatic uptake transporters may lead to transporter-mediated drug-drug interactions, resulting in altered transport kinetics for drug substrates. In this study we investigated whether non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and paracetamol interact with OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 using the standard substrate BSP and the drug substrate pravastatin. Using human embryonic kidney cells stably expressing OATP1B1 or OATP1B3, we demonstrated that bromosulfophthalein uptake was inhibited by diclofenac, ibuprofen. and lumiracoxib. Of interest, pravastatin uptake was stimulated by these NSAIDs, and for ibuprofen we determined activation constants (EC\u2085\u2080 values) of 64.0 and 93.1 \u03bcM for OATP1B1- and OATP1B3-mediated uptake, respectively. Furthermore, we investigated whether NSAIDs were also substrates for OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 and demonstrated that only diclofenac was significantly transported by OATP1B3, whereas all other NSAIDs investigated were not substrates for these uptake transporters. These results demonstrated that drugs may interact with transport proteins by allosteric mechanisms without being substrates and, therefore, not only uptake inhibition but also allosteric-induced modulation of transport function may be an important mechanism in transporter-mediated drug-drug interactions.",

The target list of analytes included analgesic and anti-inflammatories, cholesterol lowering statin drugs and lipid regulators, antidepressants, anti-ulcer agents, psychiatric drugs, ansiolitics, cardiovasculars and a high number (26) of antibiotics from different chemical groups. A common pre-concentration step based on solid-phase extraction with Oasis HLB cartridges was applied, followed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) measurement. All compounds were satisfactorily determined in just one single injection, with a chromatographic run time of only 10 min. The process efficiency (combination of the matrix effect and the extraction process recovery) for the 47 selected compounds was evaluated in nine effluent wastewater (EWW) samples, and the use of different isotope-labelled internal standards (ILIS) was investigated to correct unsatisfactory values. Up to 12 ILIS were evaluated in EWW and surface water (SW). As expected, the ILIS provided satisfactory correction for their own analytes. However, the use of these ILIS for the rest of pharmaceuticals was problematic in some cases. Despite this fact, the correction with analogues ILIS was found useful for most of analytes in EWW, while was not strictly required in the SW tested. The method was successfully validated in SW and EWW at low concentration levels, as expected for pharmaceuticals in these matrices (0.025, 0.1 and 0.5 \u03bcg/L in SW; 0.1 and 0.5 \u03bcg/L in EWW). With only a few exceptions, the instrumental limits of detection varied between 0.1 and 8 pg. The limits of quantification were estimated from sample chromatograms at the lowest spiked levels tested and normally were below 20 ng/L for SW and below 50 ng/L for EWW. The developed method was applied to the analysis of around forty water samples (river waters and effluent wastewaters) from the Spanish Mediterranean region.

The dose was increased to 20 mg rosuvastatin every other day over approximately four months resulting in a 39-percent decrease in LDL levels and a 14-percent improvement in HDL levels with excellent tolerability. The long half-life of rosuvastatin along with its high potency make it a good candidate for alternate-day administration. While few studies have evaluated the efficacy of the described alternate-day statin therapy, the failure to address significant hyperlipidemia is associated with adverse health outcomes and costs. Alternate-day statin agent use remains an underutilized option in patients intolerant of daily statin administration.

In patients who had normal lipid profiles on admission, statin was not administered for at least 2 weeks after admission (Non-Statin group; n = 101). The serum concentrations of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, IL-18, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, and high sensitive C-reactive protein were measured on days 1, 3, 7, and 14. In percentage changes in serially measured circulating IL-6 levels, a significant interaction between group and repeated measures (group X time factor) was demonstrated (p = 0.047).

The initiation of usual dose of atorvastatin early after the onset of ischemic stroke significantly decreased the elevation of IL-6 and may protect against the early neurological deterioration. Circulating levels of IL-6 may be one of the candidates for monitoring the acute effects of statin. Further studies wherein IL-6 levels are monitored in larger samples would be feasible for investigating the effect of early treatment with usual dose of atorvastatin on the functional outcome.",

The aim of this study was to compare the effects of statin monotherapy and low-dose statin/ezetimibe on lipid parameters including fasting and postprandial TG. After a 4-week dietary run-in period, 78 patients with combined hyperlipidemia were randomized into 1 of 2 treatment groups for 8 weeks: atorvastatin 20 mg or atorvastatin/ezetimibe 5 mg/5 mg. An oral fat load test was performed before and after the drug-treatment period. The low-dose combination had a tendency to decrease fasting TG more than atorvastatin monotherapy. The combination regimen showed a greater reduction in postprandial TG (-13% \u00b1 42% and -34% \u00b1 30%, in the atorvastatin and combination groups, respectively, P = .03) and total cholesterol (TC; P = .03). The changes in low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) and high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) were not different between the 2 groups. The reduction in apo B/A1 was greater in the combination group (-32% \u00b1 19% and -42% \u00b1 13%, in the atorvastatin and combination groups, respectively, P = .02).

It has been suggested that statins have pleiotropic effects countering inflammatory and oxidative stress involved in CIN. Several studies support this theory; however, previously published studies have not evaluated the potential differences between statins in reducing the incidence of CIN. The purpose of this retrospective, single-center trial was to compare the incidence of CIN in patients receiving simvastatin or pravastatin therapy undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). A total of 261 patients were included (145 received simvastatin and 116 received pravastatin) with the majority undergoing elective PCI. The population was predominantly male (65%), Hispanic (65%), and diabetic (62%), with a mean age of 59 years and a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) of 85 mg/dL. No significant differences were found between groups for risk factors or prophylactic strategies (eg, hydration). Contrast-induced nephropathy occurred in 26 patients (17.9%) in the simvastatin group versus 10 (8.6%) in the pravastatin group (P < .05). No patients required dialysis as a result of contrast administration. Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurred in 21 patients (14.5%) in the simvastatin group compared to 8 (6.9%) in the pravastatin group (P < .05). In multivariate analysis, the difference between statins remained an independent predictor for the development of CIN.

Previous studies had shown that BYHWD alkaloids and glycosides could inhibit intimal hyperplasia and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation after injury caused by balloon catheter. The present study aims to explore the mechanisms by which cell cycle was affected by BYHWD and its components. Primary rat VSMC was treated with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and cell cycle phase and extracellular-signal regulated protein kinase (ERK) transduction pathway factors were measured. PDGF-treated cells were associated with a significant increase in the number of cells in the G(2)/M phase and S phase, and in the expression of P-ERK1/2, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), c-fos, cyclinD(1) and cyclin-dependent kinase-4, as well as a decrease in the number of cells in the G(0)/G(1) phase, and in the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor P21 protein and mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1). Treatment with plasma of rats fed seven doses of BYHWD crude extract (22.2g/kg), BYHWD alkaloids (1.66g/kg), BYHWD glycosides (14.2g/kg) or the negative control atorvastatin (20mg/kg) inhibited these changes. All drug-containing plasma had similar activity to the mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK antagonist PD098059 which inhibited PDGF-induced expression of P-ERK1/2 and enhanced MKP-1. These suggest that BYHWD and its components may prevent VSMC proliferation by interfering with the ERK transduction pathway.",

Considering the use of statin for secondary prevention to achieve the LDL-C goal of <130mg/dl (3.37mmol/l), more than 80% of atorvastatin users could be switched to simvastatin. Only 8% of simvastatin usage would not be able to achieve this target.

Rosuvastatin, a new statin, has demonstrated higher potency than previously released statins and is not extensively metabolized by the liver P450 system; therefore, the probability of deleterious pharmacokinetic interactions with commonly used immunosuppressants and antiretroviral drugs is reduced. We present the first case of severe rhabdomyolysis in a liver transplant patient receiving rosuvastatin for the treatment of immunosuppressive therapy-related grade IV dyslipidemia, an HIV-infected subject on protease inhibitor-sparing HAART, that resolved after rosuvastatin withdrawal, probably related to interactions between calcineurin inhibitors and hepatic rosuvastatin uptake transporters such as organic anion transporting polypeptides (OATPs).",

Recent studies have shown that statins improve inflammation and fibrosis in several organs. We therefore examined the therapeutic effect of pravastatin on progression of chronic pancreatitis by starting this treatment after induction of pancreatic fibrosis in rats. Chronic pancreatitis was induced by continuous pancreatic ductal hypertension (PDH) for 14 days according to our previous study. Pravastatin at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day was administrated directly into the duodenum via cannula from 2 days after induction of PDH. Progression of pancreatic fibrosis and expression levels of transforming growth factor-\u03b21 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 mRNA were markedly attenuated after commencement of pravastatin compared with untreated group with PDH. In addition, pravastatin treatment markedly improved pancreatic exocrine function and significantly elevated expression level of interleukin (IL)-10 and superoxide dismutase activity in the pancreas compared with the untreated group with PDH. These results revealed that pravastatin substantially attenuates the progression of pancreatic inflammation, fibrosis and exocrine dysfunction probably by its anti-oxidative property and overproduction of IL-10 in animal model of chronic pancreatitis. These results provide an experimental evidence that pravastatin exerts beneficial effect for progression of chronic pancreatitis.",

SAH increased phosphorylated eNOS which was prevented by pre- or post-treatment with simvastatin. Simvastatin pre-treatment also prevented the increase in eNOS monomer formation that was associated with SAH, decreased superoxide anion radical production and increased NO.

As of the second day, C-reactive protein (CRP) differed between non-statin users (12.0\u00b14.1 mg/L) and patients treated with 20 (8.5\u00b14.0 mg/L), 40 (3.8\u00b12.5 mg/L), and 80 mg/day (1.4\u00b11.5 mg/L), and the daily differences remained significant until the seventh day (P<0.0001). The higher the statin dose, the lower the elevation of interleukin-2 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, the greater the reduction of 8-isoprostane and low-density lipoprotein(-), and the greater the increase in nitrate/nitrite levels during the first 5 days (P<0.001). Later initiation of statin was less effective than its early introduction in relation to attenuation of CRP, interleukin-2, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, 8-isoprostane, and low-density lipoprotein(-), as well as in increase in nitrate/nitrite levels (P<0.0001).

Participants underwent baseline and \u22652 annual follow-up measures of IL-6 and sVCAM-1. Participants were categorized as follows: category 1, annual levels of IL-6 (or sVCAM-1) were in the lowest tertile for \u22653 study visits; category 3, annual levels of IL-6 (or sVCAM-1) were in the highest tertile for \u22653 visits. Category 2 levels of IL-6 (or sVCAM-1) did not meet criteria for group 1 or 3. Six-minute walking distance, fastest paced 4-m walking velocity, and the Short Physical Performance Battery were measured annually. Results were adjusted for age, gender, race, co-morbidities, statin use, physical activity, the ankle-brachial index, and other confounders. Across IL-6 categories, average annual decreases in 6-minute walking distance were -21.4 feet in category 1, -49.2 feet in category 2, and -76.8 feet in category 3 (p for trend = 0.013), and average annual decreases in Short Physical Performance Battery score were -0.18, -0.45, and -0.62, respectively (p for trend = 0.022). Similar associations of IL-6 categories with decrease in fastest paced walking velocity were observed (p for trend = 0.034). There were no significant associations of sVCAM-1 categories with functional decline. In conclusion, in participants with peripheral arterial disease, persistently high IL-6 levels are associated with faster functional decline compared to those with fluctuating or persistently low IL-6 levels.", 
    "151": "The present study aimed to investigate the effects of separate and simultaneous dietary intake of atorvastatin (ATO) and the soluble fiber oat bran on serum and hepatic lipid levels and the degree of atherosclerosis. Ninety female LDL-receptor-deficient (LDLr-/-) mice were fed a Western-type diet containing either low dose (0.0025%), high dose (0.01%) or no ATO, with or without oat bran (27%) (n=15 per group) for 16 weeks. Both ATO and oat bran were effective in reducing serum total cholesterol levels (low ATO: -5.48, high ATO: -9.12, oat bran: -3.82 mmol/l, compared to control (no ATO/no oat bran), all p<0.0001). When oat bran was added to a low dose ATO, the cholesterol-lowering effects of this combination were 50% smaller compared to the low dose ATO diet alone (between-group difference: 2.77 mmol/l, p=0.002), whereas total cholesterol decreased to a similar extent in the groups fed a high dose ATO, with or without oat bran (between-group difference: 1.10 mmol/l, p=0.21). Serum LDL- and HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, hepatic lipid levels and atherosclerotic lesion development showed a similar pattern. In conclusion, the efficacy of oat bran and atorvastatin to lower lipid levels and atherosclerosis is reduced after simultaneous intake. We hypothesize that oat bran inhibits the intestinal absorption of atorvastatin, and consequently its cholesterol-lowering effects. The effects are likely dependent on the type of statin and dietary fiber, and on the relative timing of intake of the statin and the dietary fiber. Future studies should focus on these aspects to provide further insight into the exact mechanism of this food-drug interaction.",

We analyzed the influence of the treatment with atorvastatin (10mg/day) on the platelet sensitivity to ASA monitored under in vitro conditions in hypercholesterolemic patients. The associations between plasma or platelet cholesterol parameters and the ASA-mediated inhibition of platelet reactivity or the extent of platelet protein acetylation by ASA were estimated in the patients treated with atorvastatin for 1, 3, or 6 months. Out of 27 patients, in 17 individuals platelets appeared significantly more sensitive to 50 \u03bcM ASA in arachidonic acid- or collagen-induced whole blood aggregation following 1 month atorvastatin therapy (inhibition by 60.9 \u00b1 5.6% vs. 48.8 \u00b1 5.4%, P<0.05 for 0.5mM arachidonic acid, 40.8 \u00b1 2.9% vs. 27.0 \u00b1 4.1%, P<0.05 for 1 \u03bcg/ml collagen), and this effect lasted for 3 and 6 months, remaining in a weak, although significant, relation to the reduction of platelet cholesterol content (R(S)=-0.277, P<0.002 for arachidonic acid, R(S)=-0.197, P<0.02 for collagen). It was, however, not dependent upon either antiplatelet action or plasma lipid-lowering activity of atorvastatin. In addition, in about 50% of patients, we noticed that ASA (50 \u03bcM) significantly and time-dependently diminished thromboxane B(2) concentration in atorvastatin-treated patients. The ASA-induced acetylation of platelet proteins significantly increased in the course of atorvastatin therapy and was associated with reduced platelet cholesterol (R(S)=-0.598, P<0.0001). In conclusion, statin therapy may improve platelet sensitivity to ASA in some hypercholesterolemic patients. This effect may extend beyond the action of atorvastatin as merely a lipid-lowering agent. The mechanisms of resistance of some patients to such a combined ASA-statin treatment remain to be elucidated.",

Furthermore, the effects of AT on the frequency and suppressive function of T(reg) were determined in vitro. Our data revealed that the suppressive function of T(reg) from RA patients significantly decreased compared with that of control subjects. AT significantly reduced erythrosedimentation, C-reactive protein, and disease activity. Concomitantly, T(reg) numbers and suppressive functions were significantly improved by AT. Consistent with the in vivo experiments, AT promoted the generation of T(reg) from primary T cells and enhanced preexisting T(reg) function in vitro. Moreover, we showed that PI3K-Akt-mTOR and ERK signal pathways were involved in the induction of T(reg) by AT. In conclusion, AT significantly increased T(reg) numbers and restored their suppressive function in the RA patients, and this may be relevant in the modulation of uncontrolled inflammation in this disorder.",

We have characterized a murine disease model in which coronary arteritis is induced by a novel superantigen found in Lactobacillus casei cell wall extract (LCWE). Using this animal model of KD, we have identified three pathogenic steps leading to coronary artery aneurysm formation. These steps include T cell activation and proliferation, production of the proinflammatory cytokine tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and up-regulation of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9), an elastolytic protease. In addition to their cholesterol-lowering effects, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG) coenzyme A (CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) have pleotropic immunomodulatory properties. Thus, we examined the effect of atorvastatin in modulating each of these three critical pathogenic processes leading to aneurysm formation in the disease model. Atorvastatin inhibited lymphocyte proliferation in response to superantigen stimulation in a dose-dependent manner. This inhibition was also observed for production of soluble mediators of inflammation including interleukin (IL)-2 and TNF-\u03b1. The inhibitory effect on proliferation was rescued completely by mevalonic acid, confirming that the mechanism responsible for this inhibitory activity on immune activation was inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase. Similarly, TNF-\u03b1-induced MMP-9 production was reduced in a dose-dependent manner in response to atorvastatin. Inhibition of extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation appears to be the mechanism responsible for inhibition of MMP-9 production.

The calibration curves for all analytes were linear (R(2)\u2009\u2265\u20090.9975, n\u2009=\u20093) over the concentration range of 0.05-100 ng/mL and with lower limit of quantitation of 0.05 ng/mL. Mean extraction recoveries ranged between 88.6-111%. Intra- and inter-run mean percent accuracy were between 85-115% and percent imprecision was\u2009\u2264\u200915%. Stability studies revealed that ATV acid and lactone forms were stable in plasma during bench top (6 h on ice-water slurry), at the end of three successive freeze and thaw cycles and at -80 \u00b0C for 3 months. The method was successfully applied in a clinical study to determine concentrations of ATV and its metabolites over 12 h post-dose in patients receiving atorvastatin.", 
    "194": "Simvastatin, a drug used to lower blood cholesterol, has been reported to have an anabolic effect on bone. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of simvastatin and demineralized bovine bone matrix (DBBM) on the repair of rat calvarial defects. Defects of 5 mm were created in 64 rats, divided into four groups: no local treatment (control); treatment with DBBM (DBBM); treatment with a combination of simvastatin solution (2.2 mg/50 \u03bcl) and DBBM (DBBMSIM-1); and treatment with simvastatin solution (0.5 mg/50 \u03bcl) and DBBM (DBBMSIM-2). Animals were sacrificed on postoperative day 30 or 60, after which the calvariae were X-rayed and prepared for histomorphometric evaluation. The data were submitted to statistical analysis (p < 0.05). X-rays revealed that, on postoperative day 30, animals treated with a lower dose of simvastatin presented the lowest bone density, whereas on postoperative day 60 the use of simvastatin, regardless of the dose, resulted in lower density than that observed in control and DBBM group samples. Histomorphometric analysis revealed that, on postoperative day 30, both DBBM and DBBMSIM-1 had a negative impact on bone formation. On postoperative day 60, none of the combinations tested impaired bone repair. These results showed that the association between DBBM and simvastatin had a negative impact on bone repair.",

We investigated whether co-administration of statins with clopidogrel affected the anti-platelet efficacy of clopidogrel in Korean patients with stable angina.", 
    "196": "This was a randomized, open-label and two-period crossover design study conducted at two centers. Two hundreds thirty three patients with stable angina scheduled for coronary stenting were randomized into two groups. In Group A, 119 patients first received atorvastatin (10 mg) followed by fluvastatin (80 mg) for 12 weeks per treatment. In Group B, 114 patients received the same treatments in reverse order.",

Charts of patients with GCA seen at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics from 1960 to 2008 were reviewed. Inclusion criteria were adequate medication records, serum ESR and/or CRP on record, no prior corticosteroid use, and biopsy-positive GCA. Exclusion criteria were the presence of diseases known to elevate ESR or CRP. Main outcome measures included ESR and CRP values measured while evaluating patients for GCA but prior to receiving treatment.",

We studied the toxic effects of high glucose (50 mmol/L and 83 mmol/L) and its reversal by atorvastatin (0.5 - 5 \u03bcmol/L) on cultures of rat peritoneal mesothelial cells (PMCs).", 
    "204": "Rat PMCs were harvested from the peritonea of male Sprague-Dawley rats and grown in M199 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The effects of high glucose (50 mmol/L and 83 mmol/L) on levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), on caspase 3 activity, and on phospho-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in the cultures were evaluated.", 
    "205": "Exposure to high glucose (for 4, 8, and 24 hours) increased intracellular levels of ROS and phospho-p38 MAPK (indices of cellular toxicity). Atorvastatin blocked these toxic effects of high glucose, being more effective against 50 mmol/L glucose (protective effects were observed above 0.5 \u03bcmol/L) than against 83 mmol/L (protective effects were observed above 2.5 \u03bcmol/L). Atorvastatin was also able to prevent glucose-induced increase in caspase 3 activity.",

    "207": "The study is to explore the toxicity of organic extracts and water-soluble fraction of fine particles on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The exposure doses were 100, 200 and 400 \u03bcg/ml, respectively, for two kinds of fractions. Moreover, atorvastatin was used for intervention study. HUVECs were stimulated by 400 \u03bcg/ml organic and water soluble extracts, respectively, immediately followed by treatment with atorvastatin in concentrations of 0.1 \u03bcmol/L, 1 \u03bcmol/L and 10 \u03bcmol/L, respectively. Cell viability, malondialdehyde (MDA), nitric oxide (NO), superoxide dismutase (SOD), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the expression of interleukin-6 beta (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), endothelin-1 and P-selectin were determined in cells. The results showed that MDA and ROS increased in HUVECs after exposed to organic extracts and water-soluble fraction, whereas cell viability, NO and SOD decreased. The mRNA expression of IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, endothelin-1 (ET-1) and P-selectin increased after exposed to different fractions. Meanwhile, at the same exposure dose, water-soluble fraction caused more significant increase of MDA, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and P-selectin and decrease of cell viability and NO when compared to organic extracts. Compared to no atorvastatin group, the levels of MDA, ROS and the expression of IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, ET-1 and P-selectin decreased in HUVECs in adding atorvastatin group, but cell viability, NO and SOD increased, which indicated that atorvastatin attenuated fine particle-induced inflammatory response, oxidative stress and endothelial damage. The results hinted that the inflammatory response, oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction might be the mechanisms of cardiovascular injury induced by different fractions of ambient fine particles.", 
    "208": "Hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) is the rate-controlling enzyme of cholesterol synthesis, and owing to its biological and pharmacological relevance, researchers have investigated several compounds capable of modulating its activity with the hope of developing new hypocholesterolemic drugs. In particular, polyphenol-rich extracts were extensively tested for their cholesterol-lowering effect as alternatives, or adjuvants, to the conventional statin therapies, but a full understanding of the mechanism of their action has yet to be reached. Our work reports on a detailed kinetic and equilibrium study on the modulation of HMGR by the most-abundant catechin in green tea, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG). Using a concerted approach involving spectrophotometric, optical biosensor, and chromatographic analyses, molecular docking, and site-directed mutagenesis on the cofactor site of HMGR, we have demonstrated that EGCG potently inhibits the in vitro activity of HMGR (K(i) in the nanomolar range) by competitively binding to the cofactor site of the reductase. Finally, we evaluated the effect of combined EGCG-statin administration.", 
    "209": "Lovastatin (Lov), bisphosphonates (BP) and metformin (Met) are widely used drugs, having in common that they interfere with the mevalonate pathway (MP). The MP generates isoprene moieties required for the function of regulatory GTPases controlling cell proliferation and survival. Here, we addressed the question whether MP inhibitors interfere with the anti-tumor efficacy of anticancer drugs. We comparatively analyzed the effect of equitoxic doses of Lov, BP and Met on cell viability, cell cycle progression, apoptosis and DNA damage response (DDR) of human osteo- and fibrosarcoma cells exposed to doxorubicin or cisplatin. We found that Lov, BP and Met modulated the anticancer drug sensitivity of sarcoma cells in an agent-, dose and time-dependent fashion. Mostly, the MP inhibitors increased the cytotoxicity of the anticancer drugs in an additive manner. MP modulators differed from each other regarding their impact on anticancer drug-induced DNA damage response as measured by the phosphorylation status of SAPK/JNK, Chk-1 and H2AX as well as p53 protein level. In this regard, lovastatin and metformin turned out as the most effective inhibitory drugs. The data show that MP inhibitors can affect the anti-tumor efficacy of anticancer drugs and impact the DDR of human sarcoma cells.", 
    "210": "Despite recent advances in solid-state NMR spectroscopy, the structural characterization of amorphous active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) in solid dosage forms continues to be a monumental challenge. To circumvent complications following from low concentrations of APIs in tablet formulations, we propose a new time-saving procedure based on chemometric approach: factor analysis of (19)F MAS NMR spectra. Capability of the proposed method is demonstrated on atorvastatin--a typical representative of fluorinated pharmaceutical substances exhibiting extensive polymorphism. Applying the factor analysis on the recorded (19)F MAS NMR spectra, unique parameters for every sample were derived. In this way every solid form of atorvastatin was characterized and clearly distinguishable even among various amorphous and disordered forms. The proposed method was also found to be suitable for both qualitative and quantitative analysis of mixtures of various forms of atorvastatin. Reliability of the proposed method was extensively examined by comparing the obtained results with other experimental techniques such as (13)C CP/MAS NMR, FTIR and XRPD. As highly linear correlations between the sets of parameters obtained from different experimental data were found, the perspectives of the applied comparative factor analysis to obtain detail structural view on variability of amorphous forms of atorvastatin are also discussed. Although the reported method was tested on atorvastatin, authors expect wider application for any fluorinated compound to give the routine, fast and reliable characterization of amorphous forms of APIs in drug products even at low concentrations (1-5%). Bear in mind that 20-25% of currently developed pharmaceuticals contain at least one fluorine atom in the molecule.",

A series of in vitro tests confirmed the strong anti-inflammatory activities of known inhibitors of NF-\u03baB activation (\u03b4-tocotrienol, quercetin, riboflavin, (-) Corey lactone, amiloride, and dexamethasone). \u03b4-Tocotrienol also suppresses \u03b2-hydroxy-\u03b2-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity (the rate-limiting step in de novo cholesterol synthesis), and concomitantly lowers serum total and LDL cholesterol levels. We evaluated these compounds in an avian model anticipating that a dietary additive combining \u03b4-tocotrienol with quercetin, riboflavin, (-) Corey lactone, amiloride, or dexamethasone would yield greater reductions in serum levels of total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and inflammatory markers (tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 [TNF-\u03b1], and nitric oxide [NO]), than that attained with the individual compounds.",

The serum levels of TNF-\u03b1 and NO were decreased 61% - 84% (P < 0.001), and 14% - 67%, respectively, in chickens fed diets supplemented with \u03b4-tocotrienol, quercetin, riboflavin, (-) Corey lactone, amiloride, or dexamethasone as compared to controls. Significant decreases in the levels of serum total and LDL-cholesterol were attained with \u03b4-tocotrienol, quercetin, riboflavin and (-) Corey lactone (13% - 57%; P < 0.05), whereas, these levels were 2-fold higher in dexamethasone treated chickens as compared to controls. Parallel responses on hepatic lipid infiltration were confirmed by histological analyses. Treatments combining \u03b4-tocotrienol with the other compounds yielded values that were lower than individual values attained with either \u03b4-tocotrienol or the second compound. Exceptions were the significantly lower total and LDL cholesterol and triglyceride values attained with the \u03b4-tocotrienol/(-) Corey lactone treatment and the significantly lower triglyceride value attained with the \u03b4-tocotrienol/riboflavin treatment. \u03b4-Tocotrienol attenuated the lipid-elevating impact of dexamethasone and potentiated the triglyceride lowering impact of riboflavin. Microarray analyses of liver samples identified 62 genes whose expressions were either up-regulated or down-regulated by all compounds suggesting common impact on serum TNF-\u03b1 and NO levels. The microarray analyses further identified 41 genes whose expression was differentially impacted by the compounds shown to lower serum lipid levels and dexamethasone, associated with markedly elevated serum lipids.",

KKA(y) obese mouse is a model of type 2 diabetes characterized by systemic oxidative stress because of severe obesity, hypertriglyceridaemia, hyperglycaemia and hyperinsulinaemia. We investigated lipid peroxidation and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in the skin of KKA(y) obese mice. We also investigated the effect of lipid peroxidation derivatives on VEGF production and proliferation in human epidermal keratinocyte cell line (HaCaT). The lipid peroxidation level in the mouse skin tissue was determined by measuring the levels of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances. The levels of VEGF expression, p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation and CD36 expression were analysed by Western blot. Their localization was examined by immunofluorescence. For the in vitro experiments, an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was utilized to measure VEGF secretion in the medium. In vitro experiments demonstrated that lipid peroxidation derivatives increased VEGF production in HaCaT cells, which was blocked by a p44/p42 MAPK inhibitor and anti-CD36 antibody. We observed increased levels of lipid peroxidation derivatives, p44/p42 MAPK activation and VEGF expression in the skin of KKA(y) obese mice. Notably, pitavastatin, an inhibitor of competitive 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, suppressed all of these processes. Our results suggest that lipid peroxidation induces VEGF expression via CD36 and p44/p42 MAPK pathway in the skin of obese mice."
