Although pharmacogenomics of phase I metabolizing enzymes seems to have been well studied, knowledge on the clinical impact of genetic variability of phase II metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters is more limited. This paper reviews data on the pharmacogenomics of phase II metabolizing enzymes as well as of ATP binding cassette transporters and of solute carrier transporters focusing on clinical implications for drug efficacy and drug toxicity. The clinical impact of some of these polymorphisms has been well defined i.e. the association between polymorphisms of organic anion transporter polypeptides and statin induced myopathy. However, as the same drug may be substrate for different enzymes and different transporters, it is difficult to elucidate the impact of each polymorphism. Investigating the impact of multiple polymorphisms might be more clinically meaningful, although methodologically challenging.",

    "22": "Sepsis-triggered immune paralysis including T-cell dysfunction increases susceptibility to infections. Statins exert beneficial effects in patients with sepsis, although the mechanisms remain elusive. Herein, we hypothesized that simvastatin may attenuate T-cell dysfunction in abdominal sepsis. Male C57BL/6 mice were pretreated with simvastatin (10 mg/kg) before cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Spleen CD4 T-cell apoptosis, proliferation, and regulatory T cells (CD4CD25Foxp3) were quantified by use of flow cytometry. Formation of interferon \u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) and interleukin 4 (IL-4) in the spleen and plasma levels of high-mobility box group 1 (HMBG1) and IL-6 were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Cecal ligation and puncture caused a clear-cut increase in apoptosis and decrease in proliferation in splenic CD4 T cells. It was found that simvastatin markedly reduced apoptosis and improved proliferation in CD4 T cells in septic mice. Moreover, CLP-induced formation of regulatory T cells in the spleen was abolished in simvastatin-treated animals. Cecal ligation and puncture greatly decreased the levels of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 in the spleen. Simvastatin completely reversed this sepsis-mediated inhibition of IFN-\u03b3 and IL-4 formation in the spleen. We observed that CLP increased plasma levels of HMBG1 by 25-fold and IL-6 by 99,595-fold. Notably, treatment with simvastatin abolished this CLP-evoked increase in HMBG1 and IL-6 levels in the plasma, suggesting that simvastatin is a potent inhibitor of systemic inflammation in sepsis. Lastly, it was found that simvastatin reduced CLP-induced bacteremia. In conclusion, these novel findings suggest that simvastatin is a powerful regulator of T-cell immune dysfunction in abdominal sepsis. Thus, these protective effects of simvastatin on T-cell functions help to explain the protective effect of statins in patients with sepsis.",

Statins having both immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects were intuitively thought to influence the development of postsurgical infections. We sought to systematically examine whether any association exists between statin use and risk of infectious complications in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. We searched Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid EMBASE, Thomson Scientific Web of Science, and Elsevier Scopus from inception through February 2011 for comparative studies examining the association between statin use and risk of postoperative infections in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. We contacted a study's author for missing information. We conducted a random-effects meta-analysis of individual studies' odds ratios (adjusted for potential confounders). We identified 6 cohort studies for inclusion, 3 of which were conducted in Canada and 3 of which were conducted in the United States. Four were single-center studies, and 2 were population based. Exposure ascertainment was based on a review of admission medication list or prescription databases. Infectious outcomes were heterogeneous and included surgical site infections within 30 days, serious infections (sepsis), or any other postoperative infection. Statin use in the preoperative period was associated with a trend toward reduction in the incidence of postoperative infections in patients who underwent cardiac surgery (odds ratio, 0.81 [95% confidence interval, 0.64-1.01]; [Formula: see text]; [Formula: see text]). Heterogeneity was explained by country effect. Studies performed in Canada showed weaker associations than studies performed in the United States. This difference could not be attributed to study quality alone. We did not find good evidence to support an association between statin use and postoperative infectious complications. However, the trend toward statistical significance for this association indicates that further investigation is warranted.",

In this study, we investigated whether transplantation of sub-therapeutic doses of HUCBCs and Simvastatin enhances cerebral vascular remodeling after stroke.

There was no significant difference between Simvastatin- or HUCBC-monotherapy and MCAo-alone group. Combination treatment 24h post-stroke significantly increased the perimeter of von Willebrand factor (vWF)-positive vessels, the diameter and density of alpha smooth muscle actin (\u03b1SMA)-positive arteries, and the percentage of 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-positive endothelial cells (ECs) in the ischemic boundary zone (IBZ) compared with MCAo-alone or HUCBC-monotherapy 14 days after MCAo (p<0.05, n=8/group); Combination treatment significantly increased the densities of vWF-vessels and \u03b1SMA-arteries as well as the densities of BrdU-ECs and BrdU-positive smooth muscle cells (SMCs) in vascular walls in the IBZ compared with Simvastatin-monotherapy. Moreover, the increased BrdU-ECs and BrdU-SMCs were significantly correlated with neurological functional outcome 14 days after MCAo. Combination treatment also significantly increased the expression of Angiopoietin-1 (Ang1), Tie2 and Occludin in the IBZ (p<0.05, n=8/group). The in vitro experiments showed that combination treatment and Ang1 significantly increased capillary-like tube formation and arterial cell migration; anti-Ang1 significantly reduced combination treatment-induced tube-formation and artery cell migration (p<0.05, n=6/group). These findings indicated that a combination of sub-therapeutic doses of Simvastatin and HUCBCs treatment of stroke increases Ang1/Tie2 and Occludin expression in the ischemic brain, amplifies endogenous angiogenesis and arteriogenesis, and enhances vascular remodeling which in concert may contribute to functional outcome after stroke.",

These effects and group differences were significantly (p < 0.05) related to greater \u03b2-sitosterol reductions and smaller lathosterol increases.

Several barriers might explain this shortfall and variation, but the simplicity and economy of a polypill-based strategy might overcome some barriers. The 'Use of a Multidrug Pill In Reducing cardiovascular Events' (UMPIRE) trial assesses whether a polypill strategy (by combining aspirin, a statin and two blood pressure lowering agents) would improve adherence to guideline-indicated therapies and would lower both blood pressure and cholesterol, in people with established cardiovascular disease. UMPIRE, running in India and three European countries (England, Ireland and the Netherlands), is an open, randomised, controlled trial designed to include 1000 participants in India and 1000 in Europe, with a followup of 12-24 months. Participants were randomised to one of two versions of the polypill or relegated to usual care. The primary study outcomes were the self-reported use of aspirin, a statin and at least two blood pressure lowering agents; as well as changes in blood pressure and cholesterol. Secondary outcomes included: any cardiovascular events, reasons for stopping medications, serious adverse events and perceived changes in quality of life. Interpretation of the study data will be enhanced by health, economic and process-related evaluations. UMPIRE is registered with the European Clinical Trials database, as EudraCT: 2009-016278-34 and the Clinical Trials Registry, India as CTRI/2010/091/000250.

Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA)-induced arthritis in rats has been used widely as a model of rodent arthropathy and polyarthritis followed by osteoporosis, decreased bone formation and increased bone formation. Osteoporosis is characterized by rapid reduce of bone mass affecting more than 100 million people worldwide. Periodontitis a chronic inflammatory, of multifactorian origin disease has been associated with general osteoporosis. Protective bone-specific anabolic and antiresorptive effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have also been evaluated in normal and osteoporotic bone. AIM. The aim of the study was to investigate mandible and femur bone density in Freund's adjuvant induced arthritis rats under the influence of simvastatin. METHODS. Three groups (A, B, C) of 7 Wistar male rats each aged 3 months, (292\u00b148.38 g) were used. A control. Group B and C subjected experimental arthritis via complete Freund's adjuvant injected in right paw. Group C was treated with simvastatin 0.5 mg/kg/daily po 14 days. Femur, mandible were isolated and sizes parameters, biochemical serum findings and BMD were estimated. RESULTS. CFA established by paw diameter, adrenals and spleen weight increase and thymus weight decrease, while biochemical serum findings were also affected. Reduced femur, mandible weight and general bone mass parameters BMD evaluated via DEXA occurred and restored under simvastatin treatment. CONCLUSIONS. CFA induced mandible and femur injuries are repaired by ssimvatatin treatment that could be therapeutically useful.",

These anemic patients require close monitoring of the deferasirox exposures for ensuring its therapeutic efficacy. Dried blood spot (DBS) sampling methodology has the advantages of low volume of blood withdrawal and ease of transportation and storage over liquid blood methods. A LC-MS/MS based analytical method was developed using reversed phase column with gradient elution program and quantitated in MRM mode. Linearity range for the liquid blood was 1-1000 ng/mL and for DBS was 5-5000 ng/mL under similar mass spectrometry conditions. The method was validated with respective (M-H)(-) ions, m/z 372\u2192118 for deferasirox and m/z 410\u2192348 for fluvastatin (internal standard). The validated method was applied for the analysis of DBS samples from a rat pharmacokinetic study and results were compared against liquid blood samples from the same animal. The mean C(max) from DBS sample (1121 ng/mL) was comparable to mean C(max) found in blood samples (1015 ng/mL) at 2h after oral dose of deferasirox.

The disease is caused by mutational inactivation of the tumor suppressor gene tuberous sclerosis complex 1 (TSC1) or TSC2. By injecting TSC2-null cells into nude mice, we have developed a mouse model of LAM that is characterized by multiple random TSC2-null lung lesions, vascular endothelial growth factor-D expression, lymphangiogenesis, destruction of lung parenchyma, and decreased survival, similar to human LAM. The mice show enlargement of alveolar airspaces that is associated with progressive growth of TSC2-null lesions in the lung, up-regulation of proinflammatory cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) that degrade extracellular matrix, and destruction of elastic fibers. TSC2-null lesions and alveolar destruction were differentially inhibited by the macrolide antibiotic rapamycin (which inhibits TSC2-null lesion growth by a cytostatic mechanism) and a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, simvastatin (which inhibits growth of TSC2-null lesions by a predominantly proapoptotic mechanism). Treatment with simvastatin markedly inhibited MMP-2, MMP-3, and MMP-9 levels in lung and prevented alveolar destruction. The combination of rapamycin and simvastatin prevented both growth of TSC2-null lesions and lung destruction by inhibiting MMP-2, MMP-3, and MMP-9. Our findings demonstrate a mechanistic link between loss of TSC2 and alveolar destruction and suggest that treatment with rapamycin and simvastatin together could benefit patients with LAM by targeting cells with TSC2 dysfunction and preventing airspace enlargement.",

Paracetamol is metabolized by CYP enzymes (CYP2E1, 1A2, 2A6, 3A4) to a reactive metabolite, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone-imine (NAPQI). Under conditions of excessive NAPQI formation or reduction in glutathione stores by approximately 70%, NAPQI covalently binds to the cysteinyl sulfhydryl groups of cellular proteins, forming NAPQI-protein adducts.

For most patients unable to achieve recommended lipid level goals with therapeutic lifestyle changes, statins are the first option for treatment. Results of large, well-controlled clinical trials have demonstrated that statins are effective in primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease in diverse populations, including patients with diabetes and the elderly, and that intensive statin therapy provides more effective lipid goal attainment and significantly greater risk reduction in patients with coronary artery disease. Statin therapy is generally well tolerated but may increase the risk of myopathy. Statin use has been associated with increases in hepatic transaminases and an increased risk of diabetes, although the absolute risk of diabetes is low compared with the risk reduction benefit. Combination therapy including a statin may be appropriate for certain populations, but the risk reduction benefits of combination therapy remain unclear. Ezetimibe is an important treatment option for patients with hypercholesterolemia who do not tolerate intensive statin therapy.

    "110": "The cancer killing efficacy of standard chemotherapeutic agents such as cisplatin (CDDP) is limited by their side effects to normal tissues. Therefore, research efforts optimizing the safety and efficacy of those agents are clinically relevant. We did screen for agents that specifically protect normal human mesothelial cells against CDDP without reducing the cancer cell killing efficacy. Lovastatin was identified from the screen. Lovastatin at a pharmacologically relevant concentration strongly arrested the proliferation of normal cells, whereas cancer cells were less affected. CDDP-induced DNA damage response was not activated and normal cells showed enhanced tolerance to CDDP when normal cells were treated with the combination of CDDP and lovastatin. We demonstrate that interfering with protein geranylgeranylation is involved in the lovastatin-mediated CDDP protective effect in normal cells. In contrast to normal cells, in cancer cells lovastatin did not change the CDDP-induced response, and cancer cells were not protected by lovastatin. Furthermore, lovastatin at the pharmacological relevant concentration per se induced DNA damage, oxidative stress and autophagy in cancer cells but not in normal mesothelial cells. Therefore, our data suggest that lovastatin has a potential to improve the therapeutic index of cisplatin-based therapy.",

In this study, we investigated the effects of simvastatin on axonal injury and neurite outgrowth after experimental TBI and explored the underlying mechanisms. Wistar rats were subjected to controlled cortical impact or sham surgery. Saline or simvastatin was administered for 14 days. A modified neurological severity score (mNSS) test was performed to evaluate functional recovery. Immunohistochemistry studies using synaptophysin, neurofilament H (NF-H) and amyloid-\u03b2 precursor protein (APP) were performed to examine synaptogenesis and axonal injury. Primary cortical neurons (PCNs) were subjected to oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD) followed by various treatments. Western blot analysis was utilized to assess the activation of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK-3\u03b2)/adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) pathways. Simvastatin decreased the density of APP-positive profiles and increased the density of NF-H -positive profiles. Simvastatin reduced mNSS, which was correlated with the increase of axonal density. Simvastatin treatment stimulated the neurite outgrowth of PCNs after OGD, which was attenuated by LY294002 and enhanced by lithium chloride (LiCl). Simvastatin activated Akt and mTOR, inactivated GSK-3\u03b2 and dephosphorylated APC in the injured PCNs. Our data suggest that simvastatin reduces axonal injury, enhances neurite outgrowth and promotes neurological functional recovery after experimental TBI. The beneficial effects of simvastatin on neurite outgrowth may be mediated through manipulation of the PI-3K/Akt/mTOR and PI-3K/GSK-3\u03b2/APC pathways.",

    "125": "Fungal hybrid enzymes consisting of a polyketide synthase (PKS) and a nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) module are involved in the biosynthesis of a vast array of ecologically and medicinally relevant natural products. Whereas a dozen gene clusters could be assigned to the requisite PKS-NRPS pathways, the programming of the multifunctional enzymes is still enigmatic. Through engineering and heterologously expressing a chimera of PKS (lovastatin synthase, LovB) and NRPS (cytochalasin synthase, CheA) in Aspergillus terreus, we noted the potential incompatibility of a fungal highly reducing PKS (hrPKS) with the NRPS component of fungal PKS-NRPS hybrids. To rationalize the unexpected outcome of the gene fusion experiments, we conducted extensive bioinformatic analyses of fungal PKS-NRPS hybrids and LovB-type PKS. From motif studies and the function of the engineered chimeras, a noncanonical function of C-terminal condensation (C) domains in truncated PKS-NRPS homologues was inferred. More importantly, sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees revealed an evolutionary imprint of the PKS-NRPS domains, which reflect the evolutionary history of the entire megasynthase. Furthermore, a detailed investigation of C and adenylation (A) domains provides support for a scenario in which not only the A domain but also the C domain participates in amino acid selection. These findings shed new light on the complex code of this emerging class of multifunctional enzymes and will greatly facilitate future combinatorial biosynthesis and pathway engineering approaches towards natural product analogues.",

    "127": "Renovascular hypertension (hypertension induced by renal artery stenosis) is a form of secondary hypertension caused by overactivation of the renin-angiotensin system by the ischemic kidney. Prevalence of renal artery stenosis (RAS) is estimated to be between 2% (unselected hypertensives) and 40% (older patients with other atherosclerotic comorbidities). Most cases of RAS are caused by atherosclerosis; other causes, including fibromuscular dysplasia, vasculitis, thromboembolism and aneurysms, are less frequent. The most frequent clinical presentation of RAS is hypertension. Acute kidney injury, rapid loss of kidney function and episodes of flash pulmonary edema are other symptoms of RAS, especially in bilateral disease. In current practice, RAS therapy includes antiplatelet (aspirin) and lipid-lowering (statin) therapy as well as angiotensin II receptor blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors as a first choice of antihypertensive agents. Angiotensin blockade, however, is contraindicated in bilateral RAS and in RAS of the solitary kidney.

    "128": "Patients with increased cardiovascular risk profile are frequently seen in general practice. Comprehensive management of modifiable risk factors, in particular dyslipidemia, is mandatory. Many studies in clinical practice have shown a gap between the recommendations in clinical guidelines and the actual situation. Current data on the management situation of patients with high cardiovascular risk is provided by the prospective registry LIMA. Primary care physicians in 2,387 offices throughout Germany documented 13,924 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), diabetes mellitus or peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Treatment with simvastatin 40\u2005mg was an inclusion criterion. Physicians documented drug utilization, laboratory values (lipids, blood glucose), blood pressure and clinical events over one year and received feedback about the target value attainment of their patients after data entry. Mean age of the patients was 65.7 years, and 61.6\u200a% were men. CAD was reported in 70.6\u200a%, diabetes mellitus in 58.2\u200a% and PAD in 14.9\u200a%. Most patients (68\u200a%) received simvastatin as monotherapy also after the inclusion visit; 20.6\u200a% of patients received in addition the cholesterol absorption inhibitor (ezetimibe) in the first 6 months, and 23.3\u200a% in the second 6 months. Patients achieved the LDL-cholesterol target value in 31.8\u200a% at entry and 50.0\u200a% after one year. The blood pressure target <\u2005140\u200a/90\u2005mmHg was reached by 65.8\u200a% after one year. Of patients with diabetes mellitus 40.0\u200a% reached an HbA1c value below 6.5\u200a%. Clinical events (death, hospitalization, (cardio-) vascular events, and dialysis) were reported by 11.7\u200a% of patients between entry and Month 6, and by 12.0\u200a% between Month 7 and 12.

    "129": "Rosuvastatin increased vascular endothelial NO and attenuated platelet activation after ischemia-reperfusion in mice; nevertheless, the influence of rosuvastatin on the activation of human platelets and the underlying mechanism has never been investigated. In an in vitro study platelets from 8 healthy donors were incubated with scalar concentrations of rosuvastatin (1-10 \u03bcM) before activation. Platelet recruitment (PR), that mimics the propagation of platelet aggregation and is dependent upon isoprostane formation, was investigated. PR was inhibited by rosuvastatin in concentration-dependent manner concomitantly with down-regulation of platelet release of the pro-thrombotic molecule CD40L. This effect was associated with lower production of platelet reactive oxygen species (ROS), isoprostane and activation of the glycoprotein IIb/IIIa and was counteracted by exogenous addition of isoprostanes. Conversely, rosuvastatin concentration-dependently increased platelet NO. Platelet isoprostane formation mainly depends from NADPH oxidase. Rosuvastatin concentration-dependently inhibited platelet sNOX2-dp release, a specific marker of NADPH oxidase activation, PKC phosphorylation and p47(phox) translocation from cytosol to membranes. In an ex vivo study 10 hypercolesterolemic patients were randomly allocated to diet or rosuvastatin (20 mg). We observed that as early as 2h after rosuvastatin PR, platelet isoprostanes formation, platelet CD40L and sNOX2-dp decreased while platelet NO increased; no changes were detected in diet-assigned patients. This study shows that in vitro rosuvastatin impairs platelet activation via inhibition of NOX2-derived oxidative stress. This effect, which is associated ex vivo with acute inhibition of platelet activation, suggests that rosuvastatin behaves as an antiplatelet drug.",

To evaluate the association between persistent use of statins and risk of acute nonfatal cardiovascular events in primary prevention patients in community settings, we retrospectively analyzed a cohort of 171,535 adults 45 to 75 years old with no indication of cardiovascular disease who began statin therapy from 1998 to 2009 in a large health maintenance organization in Israel. Persistence with statins was measured by the proportion of days covered with dispensed prescriptions of statins during the follow-up period. Main outcome measurements were occurrence of myocardial infarction or performance of a cardiac revascularization procedure. Incidence of acute cardiovascular events during the follow-up period (993,519 person-years) was 10.22 per 1,000 person-years. Persistence with statins was associated with a lower risk of incident cardiac events (p for trend <0.01). The most persistent users (covered with statins for \u226580% of their follow-up time) had a hazard ratio of 0.58 (95% confidence interval 0.55 to 0.62) compared to nonpersistent users (proportion of days covered <20%). Similar results were found when analyses were limited to patients with >5 years of follow-up. Treatment with high efficacy statins was associated with a lower risk of cardiac events. In conclusion, our large and unselected community-based study supports the results of randomized controlled trials regarding the beneficial effect of statins in the primary prevention of acute cardiac events.",

On the basis of such evidence, as well as pragmatic considerations, it is clear that clinicians should place stronger emphasis on lipid and blood pressure management to lessen cardiovascular risks. At the same time, cardiovascular disease benefits of glycaemia reduction appear less pronounced, with patient characteristics critically influencing risk to benefit ratio.

The polypill represents a powerhouse pill that would consist of a combination of several key medications commonly prescribed for CVD prevention, such as a statin, diuretic, beta blocker, or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, in one pill. It was suggested that it could be a novel, tactical measure in the approach to CVD prevention in that it greatly simplifies the healthcare delivery system. Not only does it increase medication compliance for those currently receiving health care, but it also has the potential to access those in underserved healthcare sectors of the world, primarily low- and middle-income countries, which have been identified as areas of highest CVD risk. A major drawback of the polypill is that there are limited data demonstrating its safety and efficacy in the prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Thus far, research shows that the polypill has promise but needs to be approached with a few considerations, such as desired target patient population and formulation.

However, little attention has been paid to the relationship between hypercholesterolemia and stroke, despite stroke being the most common cardiovascular disease in Japan. We therefore reviewed cohort studies that investigated this relationship in the Japanese population over the past 20 years, and compared their findings with clinical trials and cohort studies in Western countries. Fourteen cohort studies were carried out in Japan during this period. The number of subjects in the studies ranged from 1621 to 91,219 and the mean follow-up period ranged from 7.6 to 32 years. The majority of studies showed no association between hypercholesterolemia and total stroke. However, one report showed a positive association between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and atherothrombotic cerebral infarction. The relationship between hypercholesterolemia and cerebral infarction may be modified by the proportion of atherothrombotic infarctions in the population surveyed. Randomized controlled trials on statins have shown a substantial reduction in cerebral infarction, and so the discrepancy between cohort studies and clinical trials requires further study. However, some studies have reported that subjects with low blood cholesterol are more susceptible to intracerebral hemorrhage. Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain this association between low cholesterol and intracerebral hemorrhage. First, low blood cholesterol may induce angionecrosis, possibly in combination with hypertension, and second, low blood cholesterol may reflect a poor nutritional status. Either way, further continuous research in various fields of medical science is required to clarify the overall effect of blood cholesterol on stroke in humans.",

To evaluate attainment of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals among hypercholesterolaemic patients undergoing lipid-lowering drug treatment in Hong Kong and to identify potential determinants of treatment outcomes. DESIGN. Cross-sectional observational study. SETTING. A single site in Hong Kong, as part of the CEPHEUS Pan-Asian survey. PATIENTS. Subjects with hypercholesterolaemia aged 18 years or above, who had been on lipid-lowering drug treatment for at least 3 months with no dose adjustment for at least 6 weeks. RESULTS. A total of 561 such patients (mean age, 65.3; standard deviation, 9.7 years) were evaluated. Most had major cardiovascular risk factors; 534 (95.2%) of 561 patients had coronary heart disease and 534 (95.4%) of 560 patients had low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals set at lower than 70 mg/dL. In all, 465 (82.9%) patients attained their respective low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals. Among 75 patients who had coronary heart disease or equivalent risk, and multiple risk factors with a 10-year coronary heart disease risk of over 20%, 62 (82.7%) attained their respective low-density lipoprotein cholesterol goals.

    "147": "Pharmacological agents used to treat primary and combined hyperlipidemia reduce cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. Risk reduction has been attributed to improvements in blood lipid and lipoprotein characteristics. However, each class of available lipid-lowering drugs has been shown to exhibit pleiotropic effects that broaden their anticipated actions. Indeed, the results of a growing number of available studies suggest that a strong relationship exists between pharmacological reductions in blood lipids and circulating concentrations of the adipose tissue derived protein, adiponectin. Adiponectin is the most abundantly secreted protein from adipose tissue and has been shown to decrease hepatic glucose production, increase fatty acid oxidation in liver and skeletal muscle, and decrease vascular inflammation. In this chapter, we present a comprehensive analysis of the effects of the available classes of lipid-lowering drugs (statins, fibrates, niacin, and omega-3-fatty acids) on circulating adiponectin and the known mechanisms which produce these important events.",

Examination of multiple circulating inflammatory biomarkers has shown that they independently predict cardiovascular risk in patients with and without overt cardiovascular disease.

Statins, a class of drugs that reduce levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and other inflammatory biomarkers, have been the most thoroughly studied anti-inflammatory agents to reduce cardiovascular risk. However, all such trials are necessarily confounded by the ability of statins to markedly reduce cholesterol, a well-known causal risk factor for adverse vascular outcomes. Nevertheless, the provocative results of several key statin trials have provided the scientific basis to test the hypothesis that reducing inflammation will improve cardiovascular outcomes with novel and specific anti-inflammatory agents. These newer drugs promise to reduce inflammatory marker levels without affecting lipids, glucose, or blood pressure. The results of these trials will provide key data to help us understand the relationship between inflammation and vascular risk.",

Etoposide caused a dose-dependent increase in the \u03b3H2AX level as shown by Western blotting. By contrast, the doxorubicin response was bell-shaped with high doses failing to increase H2AX phosphorylation. Identical results were obtained by immunohistochemical analysis of \u03b3H2AX focus formation, comet assay-based DNA strand break analysis, and measuring the formation of the topo II-DNA cleavable complex. At low dose, doxorubicin activated ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) but not ATM and Rad3-related (ATR). Both the lipid-lowering drug lovastatin and the Rac1-specific inhibitor NSC23766 attenuated doxorubicin- and etoposide-stimulated H2AX phosphorylation, induction of DNA strand breaks, and topo II-DNA complex formation. Lovastatin and NSC23766 acted in an additive manner. They did not attenuate doxorubicin-induced increase in p-ATM and p-Chk2 levels. DDR stimulated by topo II poisons was partially blocked by inhibition of type I p21-associated kinases. DDR evoked by the topoisomerase I poison topotecan remained unaffected by lovastatin. The data show that the mechanisms involved in DDR stimulated by topo II poisons are agent-specific with anthracyclines lacking DDR-stimulating activity at high doses. Pharmacological inhibition of Rac1 signaling counteracts doxorubicin- and etoposide-stimulated DDR by disabling the formation of the topo II-DNA cleavable complex. Based on the data we suggest that Rac1-regulated mechanisms are required for DNA damage induction and subsequent activation of the DDR following treatment with topo II but not topo I poisons.",

We conducted a MEDLINE search for observational studies reporting the association between exposure to statins and risk for incident liver cancer until March 2012. Fixed-effect and random-effect models were used to estimate summary relative risks (RR) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Moreover, between-study heterogeneity and publication bias were assessed using adequate statistical tests. Five observational studies (two case-control and three cohort studies) based on 2574 cases of HCC were included. Statin treatment, compared with no treatment, was inversely related to HCC (summary RR=0.58; 95% CI 0.46-0.74). Between-study heterogeneity was significant (P<0.001) and numerically relevant (I=65%). When only longest statin use was considered, the RR was 0.66 (95% CI 0.55-0.80). Influence analysis on the overall estimate showed that heterogeneity was largely because of one study; when omitting it, the I dropped to 27% (P=0.240), whereas the summary RR was only marginally modified (RR=0.52; 95% CI 0.44-0.62).

However, no outcomes trials exist to assess the efficacy of TG lowering for preventing pancreatitis in patients with severe hypertriglyceridemia. Similarly, no completed prospective outcomes trial exists to support or refute a reduction in CHD risk resulting from lipid-altering therapy in patients specifically selected for the presence of hypertriglyceridemia. This review examines the available evidence for the use of statins, omega-3 fatty acids, fibrates, and niacin in the management of hypertriglyceridemic patients. Results from CHD outcomes trials support statins as the first-line lipid-altering drug therapy to reduce CHD in hypercholesterolemic patients, and subgroup analyses suggest statins are efficacious in hypertriglyceridemic patients with fasting TG levels <500 mg/dL. Omega-3 fatty acids and fibrates are reasonable first drug options for patients with TG \u2265500 mg/dL and often are used to lower TG levels with the objective of reducing pancreatitis risk, although a statin or niacin may also be reasonable options. Combination lipid drug therapy may be needed to achieve both low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol treatment goals for CHD prevention in patients with elevated TG levels, particularly those with TG \u2265500 mg/dL.

The micelles had an average size of 80 nm. The in vitro release behavior of SV from the micelles showed prolonged release compared to the free SV. The following four groups were tested in a cytologic experiment: a free SV group, a SV-loaded micelle group with SV concentrations ranging from 2.5\u00d710(-6) to 2.5\u00d710(-10) M, a drug-free micelle group and a blank control group. The effect of SV-loaded micelles on osteoblast-like MG-63 cells was determined via analysis of cell proliferation, alkaline phosphatase activity, and cell calcification. In addition, the mRNA and protein expression of the BMP-2 gene were determined with real-time fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot techniques, respectively. The results show that SV-loaded PECL micelles cause effective suppression of the osteoblast early proliferation inhibition, stimulation of osteoblast differentiation and mineralization, and stimulation of the BMP-2 expression. Therefore, SV-loaded PECL micelles are predicted to have great potential in bone regeneration applications.", 
    "201": "Statins have well-established cardiovascular benefits, and recent evidence suggests that discontinuing statin therapy after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is harmful. Our objective was to assess the association between statin discontinuation post-AMI and 1-year all-cause mortality in a real world setting.", 
    "202": "Data on survivors of AMI between 2000 and 2007 were extracted from the hospital discharge summary database of Quebec and the provincial physician and drug claims database. Statin prescription filling was used to establish cohort groups. Previous statin use was defined as having filled a statin prescription in the 90 days pre-AMI, while post-AMI statin use was filling a prescription between discharge from hospital post-AMI and 90 days post-discharge. AMI patients who survived 90 days (n=48,229) were divided into 4 groups: i) non-users (n=11,657), did not receive statins pre- or post- AMI (reference group), ii) starters (n=22,452), received statins only post-AMI, iii) stoppers (n=488), received statins pre- but not post-AMI, and, iv) users (n=13,632), received statins pre- and post-AMI. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate hazard ratios (HR).", 
    "203": "Compared with non-users, stoppers had increased 1-year all-cause mortality (adjusted HR 1.36; 95% CI 1.08- 1.70, P=0.008). Starters (HR 0.65; 95% CI 0.59-0.71, P<0.0001) and users (HR 0.81; 95% CI 0.74-0.88, P<0.0001) had lower mortality than non-users.", 
    "204": "Discontinuation of statins in survivors of AMI was associated with an increase in 1-year all-cause mortality. Physicians should use caution when discontinuing statins post-AMI.", 
    "205": "To assess the effect of exposure to evidence-based medication after hospital discharge for Medicare beneficiaries with acute myocardial infarction (AMI).", 
    "206": "A discrete-time hazard model was used to estimate time to outcome associated with exposure to four drug classes (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)/angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARBs), beta-blockers (BBs), statins, and clopidogrel) used for post-AMI secondary prevention of cardiovascular events and mortality.", 
    "207": "Medicare administrative data for a 5% random sample of beneficiaries.", 
    "208": "Medicare beneficiaries (N\u00a0=\u00a09,538) hospitalized for an AMI between April 1, 2006, and December 31, 2007, who survived for at least 30\u00a0days after discharge. The cohort was followed until death or December 31, 2008.", 
    "209": "Time-varying exposure was measured as proportion of days covered (PDC) for each quarter during the follow-up period. PDC was classified into five categories (0-0.2, 0.2-0.4, 0.4-0.6, 0.6-0.8, 0.8-1.0). Outcomes were mortality and a composite outcome of death or post-AMI hospitalization.", 
    "210": "Over a median follow-up of 18\u00a0months, mean PDC rates ranged from 0.37 (clopidogrel) to 0.50 (statins). When comparing the highest versus lowest categories of exposure, the hazard of the composite outcome was significantly lower for all drug classes except BBs (statins, adjusted hazard ratio (aHR)\u00a0=\u00a00.71, ACEIs/ARBs, aHR\u00a0=\u00a00.81, clopidogrel, aHR\u00a0=\u00a00.85, BBs, aHR\u00a0=\u00a00.93). All four drug classes were significantly associated with reductions in mortality; the magnitude of effect for the mortality outcome was largest for statins and smallest for BBs. Age modified the effect of statins on mortality.", 
    "211": "Use of evidence-based medications for secondary prevention after AMI is suboptimal in the Medicare population, and low exposure rates are associated with significantly higher risk for subsequent hospitalization and death.", 
    "212": "Statins are widely used in the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease and prevent first and recurrent ischemic strokes mainly because of their lipid-lowering effect. However, they also have pleiotropic effects and might be neuroprotective in acute ischemic stroke. Improved functional outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke treated with intravenous thrombolysis tissue plasminogen activator has been proposed, but not confirmed by other studies. Furthermore, some studies showed an increased risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage in statin users. The article being evaluated presents a large observational cohort of acute ischemic stroke patients treated with intravenous tissue plasminogen activator and showed no association between statin use or lipid profiles and functional outcome or risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage. The results of this article are discussed in the context of previous published studies.", 
    "213": "Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) is implicated as a key molecule maintaining endothelial function. This study was designed to evaluate the reciprocal regulation of KLF2 by the forkhead transcription factor FOXO1, and the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme\u00a0A reductase inhibitor atorvastatin, in hyperglycaemic conditions.", 
    "214": "Exposure of human umbilical vein endothelial cells to 30 mM glucose activated FOXO1 and suppressed KLF2. These effects were reversed by FOXO1 small interfering RNA. Adenoviral transfection of constitutively active FOXO1 suppressed KLF2 expression. Interestingly, atorvastatin inhibited FOXO1 by increasing phosphorylation and also by inhibiting nuclear localization and replenished KLF2 in high-glucose conditions. This effect of atorvastatin was attenuated by mevalonate. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that glucose increased whereas atorvastatin decreased FOXO1 binding to the promoter region of the KLF2 gene. In the vessels of Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty rats, animal models of type 2 diabetes, FOXO1 was activated and KLF2 was suppressed, and this was reversed by atorvastatin treatment. The arteries from Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty rats showed impairment of endothelium-dependent vasodilatation, and both atorvastatin and KLF2 gene therapies restored it.", 
    "215": "Suppression of KLF2 by FOXO1 may be a plausible mechanism of diabetic endothelial dysfunction. High-glucose-induced, FOXO1-mediated KLF2 suppression was reversed by atorvastatin, suggesting that intensive statin treatment could be a therapeutic option in diabetic vascular dysfunction.", 
    "216": "Individual patient-data meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials is the gold standard for investigating how patient factors modify the effectiveness of treatment. Because participant data from primary studies might not be available, reliable alternatives using published data are needed. In this paper, I show that the maximum likelihood estimates of a participant-level linear random effects meta-analysis with a patient covariate-treatment interaction can be determined exactly from aggregate data when the model's variance components are known. I provide an equivalent aggregate-data EM algorithm and supporting software with the R package ipdmeta for the estimation of the \"interaction meta-analysis\" when the variance components are unknown. The properties of the methodology are assessed with simulation studies. The usefulness of the methods is illustrated with analyses of the effect modification of cholesterol and age on pravastatin in the multicenter placebo-controlled regression growth evaluation statin study. When a participant-level meta-analysis cannot be performed, aggregate-data interaction meta-analysis is a useful alternative for exploring individual-level sources of treatment effect heterogeneity.", 
    "217": "Statins are effective in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and cardiac events but can produce muscle side effects. We have hypothesized that statin-related muscle complaints are exacerbated by exercise and influenced by factors including mitochondrial dysfunction, membrane disruption, and/or calcium handling. The interaction between statins, exercise, and muscle symptoms may be more effectively diagnosed and treated as rigorous scientific studies accumulate.", 
    "218": "The aim of this study was to clarify the impact of diabetes mellitus (DM) as well as antidiabetic, antihypertensive, and antihyperlipidemic medications such as metformin and statins on survival in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer receiving chemotherapy.", 
    "219": "We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 250 patients with advanced pancreatic cancer receiving chemotherapy. Multivariate analyses of prognostic factors for survival were performed both in overall population and in subgroups with and without DM.", 
    "220": "Diabetes mellitus was diagnosed in 124 patients (50%) who had less distant metastasis and more hypertension. Thirty patients received statin for hyperlipidemia. Overall survival was 13.3 versus 10.0 months with and without DM (P = 0.084), but hazard ratio of DM was 1.05 (P = 0.758) in the multivariate analysis. Subgroup analysis of diabetic patients, but not in non-diabetic patients, demonstrated use of statins (hazard ratio, 0.40; P = 0.010) as a prognostic factor, as well as distant metastasis, performance status, combination therapy with gemcitabine and S-1, and use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers. No antidiabetic medications were prognostic factors.", 
    "221": "Neither DM nor antidiabetic treatment had prognostic impact on advanced pancreatic cancer. Statin use was associated with better survival in the diabetic patients.", 
    "222": "Experimental and clinical data suggest that statins may protect bone by inhibiting bone resorption and/or stimulating bone formation. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is produced by osteoblasts, and potently stimulates osteoclast activation playing a key role in normal bone resorption as well as in post-menopausal and inflammation-driven osteoporosis. Although statins inhibit IL-6 production from different cell types, currently no data exist on osteoblasts. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of rosuvastatin on IL-6 production by human osteoblasts.", 
    "223": "Osteoblasts from osteoarthritic patients were incubated with rosuvastatin (0.1-10 \u03bcmol/L)\u00b1IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 production was evaluated as cytokine concentration in the culture medium (ELISA), as well as mRNA expression in the cells (qPCR). Putative intracellular mechanisms of the drug, such as blocking HMG-CoA-reductase, and interference in the prenylation process were investigated by the addition of mevalonate and isoprenoids. The effect of rosuvastatin\u00b1IL-1\u03b2 on the anti-resorptive molecule osteoprotegerin (OPG) was also assessed (ELISA).", 
    "224": "Rosuvastatin significantly reduced IL-6 levels in the osteoblast culture medium, both in unstimulated and IL-1\u03b2-stimulated cells. This effect was reversed by mevalonate or geranylgeraniol, but not farnesol. Moreover, the drug decreased both spontaneous and IL-1\u03b2-induced IL-6 mRNA expression in osteoblasts. Conversely, rosuvastatin did not affect OPG levels in the culture medium.", 
    "225": "Our results show that rosuvastatin decreases IL-6 production by osteoblasts, thereby suggesting a possible inhibiting activity on osteoclast function in an indirect way. These data may provide further rationale for employing rosuvastatin to beneficially affect bone metabolism in post-menopausal women and possibly in inflammation-driven osteoporosis.", 
    "226": "Previous meta-analyses suggest that pre-procedural use of statin therapy may reduce atrial fibrillation (AF) following invasive cardiac interventions (coronary artery by-pass grafting and percutaneous coronary intervention). However, the current evidence on the benefit of statins unrelated to invasive cardiac interventions has not been clarified systematically.", 
    "227": "Through a systematic literature search, trials examining the effect of statin therapy on AF were selected. Trials using statins before any percutaneous or surgical cardiac interventions were excluded.", 
    "228": "The search identified 11 randomized and 16 observational eligible studies, totaling 106,640 patients receiving statin therapy and 129,305 serving as controls. Fourteen studies investigated the effect of statins on new-onset AF, 13 studies investigated the effect of statins on recurrent AF and one in both new-onset and recurrent AF. In the statin versus control group the mean age was 60.7 \u00b1 8.3 versus 68.6 \u00b1 6.2 years and females comprised 8.4% versus 10.3%. Statin therapy was associated with significant reduction of AF (Risk ratio (RR): 0.81 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.80-0.83], p<0.001) combining all studies. Assessing exclusively randomized trials, statin therapy showed no significant risk reduction (RR: 0.97 [95%CI: 0.90-1.05], p=0.509), heterogeneity p>0.05. Assessing exclusively observational studies the risk reduction of new-onset AF was 12% (RR: 0.88 [95%CI: 0.85-0.91], p<0.001) and recurrent AF 15% (RR: 0.85 [95%CI: 0.80-0.90], p<0.001), heterogeneity p<0.001.", 
    "229": "The hitherto published randomized clinical trials do not support a beneficial effect of statins on AF in patients not undergoing invasive cardiac interventions. This is in contrast to the results of observational and interventional studies.", 
    "230": "Vascular endothelial dysfunction is determined by both genetic and environmental factors that cause decreased bioavailability of the vasodilator nitric oxide. This is a hallmark of atherosclerosis, hypertension, and coronary heart disease, which are major complications of metabolic disorders, including diabetes and obesity. Several therapeutic interventions, including changes in lifestyle as well as pharmacologic treatments, are useful for improving endothelial dysfunction in the face of lipotoxicity. This review discusses the current understanding of molecular and physiologic mechanisms underlying lipotoxicity-mediated endothelial dysfunction as well as relevant therapeutic approaches to ameliorate dyslipidemia and consequent endothelial dysfunction that have the potential to improve cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes."
