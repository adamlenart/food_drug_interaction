After infection of cells with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, bacterial burden was determined. In vivo, mice were treated with statins before aerosol-based infection with M. tuberculosis and were monitored for disease progression.", 
    "2": "PBMCs and MDMs from patients with FH receiving statin therapy were more resistant to M. tuberculosis infection, with reduced bacterial burdens, compared with those of healthy donors. Moreover, statin treatment in experimental murine M. tuberculosis infection studies increased host protection, with reduced lung burdens and improved histopathologic findings. Mechanistically, metabolic rescue experiments demonstrated that statins reduce membrane cholesterol levels, particularly by the mevalonate-isoprenoid arm of the sterol pathway. This promoted phagosomal maturation (EEA-1/Lamp-3) and autophagy (LC3-II), as shown by confocal microscopy and Western blot in macrophages. In addition, inhibitors of phagosome and autophagosome maturation reversed the beneficial effect of statins on bacterial growth.", 
    "3": "These results suggest that statin-mediated reduction in cholesterol levels within phagosomal membranes counteract M. tuberculosis-induced inhibition of phagosomal maturation and promote host-induced autophagy, thereby augmenting host protection against tuberculosis.", 
    "4": "The aim of this study is to determine the effects of Atorvastatin treatment, an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase, in periodontal disease. Male Wistar albino rats were randomly divided into five groups of ten rats each: (1) non-ligated treatment (NL), (2) ligature only (L), (3) ligature plus 1 mg/kg Atorvastatin daily for 10 days, (4) ligature plus 5 mg/kg Atorvastatin daily for 10 days, and (5) ligature plus 10 mg/kg Atorvastatin daily for 10 days. Following the treatment course, the periodontal tissue of the animals was analyzed by Measurement of alveolar bone loss, Histopathology and immunohistochemistry to determine of the expression of COX-2, MMP-2, MMP9, and RANKL/RANK/OPG. ELISA assay was used to quantitate the levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-10, TNF-\u03b1, myeloperoxidase, malondialdehyde, and glutathione. The periodontal group treated with 10 mg/kg of Atorvastatin (3.9\u00b10.9 mm; p<0.05) showed reverse the alveolar bone loss caused Experimental Periodontal Disease compared to (L) (7.02\u00b10.17 mm). The periodontal group treated with 10 mg/kg of Atorvastatin showed a significant reduction in MPO and MDA (p<0.05) compared to ligature only group (L). Similarly in this group, the levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1 were significantly decreased (p<0.05). Furthermore, MMP-2, MMP-9, RANKL/RANK, and COX-2 were all downregulated by Atorvastatin treatment, while OPG expression was increased. The findings support a role of Atorvastatin for reducing the bone loss, inflammatory response, oxidative stress, and expression of extracellular matrix proteins, while reducing RANK/RANKL and increase OPG in periodontal disease.", 
    "5": "The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae can be a useful model for studying cellular mechanisms related to sterol synthesis in humans due to the high similarity of the mevalonate pathway between these organisms. This metabolic pathway plays a key role in multiple cellular processes by synthesizing sterol and nonsterol isoprenoids. Statins are well-known inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR), the key enzyme of the cholesterol synthesis pathway. However, the effects of statins extend beyond their cholesterol-lowering action, since inhibition of HMGR decreases the synthesis of all products downstream in the mevalonate pathway. Using transgenic yeast expressing human HMGR or either yeast HMGR isoenzyme we studied the effects of simvastatin, atorvastatin, fluvastatin and rosuvastatin on the cell metabolism.", 
    "6": "Statins decreased sterol pools, prominently reducing sterol precursors content while only moderately lowering ergosterol level. Expression of genes encoding enzymes involved in sterol biosynthesis was induced, while genes from nonsterol isoprenoid pathways, such as coenzyme Q and dolichol biosynthesis or protein prenylation, were diversely affected by statin treatment. Statins increased the level of human HMGR protein substantially and only slightly affected the levels of Rer2 and Coq3 proteins involved in non-sterol isoprenoid biosynthesis.", 
    "7": "Statins influence the sterol pool, gene expression and protein levels of enzymes from the sterol and nonsterol isoprenoid biosynthesis branches and this effect depends on the type of statin administered. Our model system is a cheap and convenient tool for characterizing individual statins or screening for novel ones, and could also be helpful in individualized selection of the most efficient HMGR inhibitors leading to the best response and minimizing serious side effects.",

Obesity, diabetes mellitus (DM), and dyslipidaemia, common components of the metabolic syndrome (MetS), are frequently associated with NAFLD; 75-100% of patients with MetS or DM have NAFLD. NAFLD is characterized by hepatic triglyceride (TG) infiltration in the absence of alcohol abuse or chronic liver disease. NAFLD includes a spectrum of conditions varying from steatosis to steatosis with inflammation [steatohepatitis (NASH)], necrosis, fibrosis or cirrhosis that rarely progresses to hepatocellular carcinoma. NAFLD and NASH are the hepatic manifestations of MetS and are associated with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Most NAFLD/NASH patients die from CVD rather than from liver disease. There is no universally accepted treatment for NAFLD.", 
    "9": "Using meta-analysis of eight independent transplant datasets (236 graft biopsy samples) from four organs, we identified a common rejection module (CRM) consisting of 11 genes that were significantly overexpressed in acute rejection (AR) across all transplanted organs. The CRM genes could diagnose AR with high specificity and sensitivity in three additional independent cohorts (794 samples). In another two independent cohorts (151 renal transplant biopsies), the CRM genes correlated with the extent of graft injury and predicted future injury to a graft using protocol biopsies. Inferred drug mechanisms from the literature suggested that two FDA-approved drugs (atorvastatin and dasatinib), approved for nontransplant indications, could regulate specific CRM genes and reduce the number of graft-infiltrating cells during AR. We treated mice with HLA-mismatched mouse cardiac transplant with atorvastatin and dasatinib and showed reduction of the CRM genes, significant reduction of graft-infiltrating cells, and extended graft survival. We further validated the beneficial effect of atorvastatin on graft survival by retrospective analysis of electronic medical records of a single-center cohort of 2,515 renal transplant patients followed for up to 22 yr. In conclusion, we identified a CRM in transplantation that provides new opportunities for diagnosis, drug repositioning, and rational drug design.", 
    "10": "The use of statins in women of reproductive age to prevent adverse cardiovascular events is on the rise. This is attributed to an increase in metabolic risk factors such as obesity, raised lipids, diabetes and high blood pressure. Statins are contraindicated in pregnancy because of the perceived increased risk of congenital abnormalities to the foetus. We evaluated the evidence, including published reviews and primary studies, on the safety of statins in pregnancy and assessed the benefits to the mother.", 
    "11": "The risk of major congenital abnormalities from exposure to statins in pregnancy is similar to the background risk of the population. No specific pattern of abnormalities was observed.

    "13": "HMG-CoA-Reductase inhibitors, also known as statins, are currently the most powerful cholesterol-lowering drugs available on the market. Clinical trials and experimental evidence suggest that statins have heavy anti-atherosclerotic effects. These are in part consequence of lipid lowering but also result from pleiotropic actions of the drugs. These so-called pleiotropic properties affect various aspects of cell function, inflammation, coagulation, and vasomotor activity. These effects are mediated either indirectly through LDL-c reduction or via a direct effect on cellular functions. Although many of the pleiotropic properties of statins may be a class effect, some may be unique to certain agents and account for differences in their pharmacological activity. So, although statins typically have similar effects on LDL-c levels, differences in chemical structure and pharmacokinetic profile can lead to variations in pleiotropic effects. In this paper we analize the in vitro effects of different statins over different cell lines from cells implicated in atherosclerotic process: endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and vascular muscular cells. In relation with our results we can proof that the effects of different dosis of different statins provides singular effects over growth curves of different cellular lines, a despite of a class-dependent effects. So, pleiotropic effects and its reversibility with mevalonate are different according with the molecule and the dosis.",

Nowadays, statins are the primary drug of choice for treating cardiovascular disease. Although several reviews have described clinical trials and in vitro studies of statins, the anti-atherosclerotic effects of statins on animal models have not been comprehensively reviewed. This review summarized the contribution of WHHL rabbits to elucidating the anti-atherosclerotic effects of statins in vivo. Studies using WHHL rabbits verified that statins suppress plaque destabilization by reducing unstable components (foam cells derived from macrophages, foam cell debris, and extracellular lipid accumulation), preventing smooth muscle cell reductions, and increasing the collagen content of plaques. In addition, the expression of matrix metalloproteinases and tissue factor are decreased in intimal macrophages by statin treatment. Lipid-lowering effects of statins alter plaque biology by reducing the proliferation and activation of macrophages, a prominent source of the molecules responsible for plaque instability and thrombogenicity. Although statins remain the standard treatment for cardiovascular disease, new therapeutics are eagerly awaited. WHHL rabbits will continue to contribute to the development of therapeutics.",

Endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) contribute to vascular healing and play a crucial role in repair following ischemic injury primarily by endothelialization of VP and neovascularization of ischemic myocardium. We present the rationale and design of the Plaque Regression and Progenitor Cell Mobilization with Intensive Lipid Elimination Regimen or the PREMIER Trial, which is designed to address the question for the very first time whether a highly intensive low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-lowering therapy with LDL-apheresis could lead to a more rapid and detectable reduction in coronary atheroma volume, along with a robust mobilization of EPC compared to standard statin therapy, in patients selected for percutaneous coronary intervention for an acute coronary syndrome.", 
    "27": "Propensity score methods are increasingly being used to estimate causal treatment effects in observational studies. In medical and epidemiological studies, outcomes are frequently time-to-event in nature. Propensity-score methods are often applied incorrectly when estimating the effect of treatment on time-to-event outcomes. This article describes how two different propensity score methods (matching and inverse probability of treatment weighting) can be used to estimate the measures of effect that are frequently reported in randomized controlled trials: (i) marginal survival curves, which describe survival in the population if all subjects were treated or if all subjects were untreated; and (ii) marginal hazard ratios. The use of these propensity score methods allows one to replicate the measures of effect that are commonly reported in randomized controlled trials with time-to-event outcomes: both absolute and relative reductions in the probability of an event occurring can be determined. We also provide guidance on variable selection for the propensity score model, highlight methods for assessing the balance of baseline covariates between treated and untreated subjects, and describe the implementation of a sensitivity analysis to assess the effect of unmeasured confounding variables on the estimated treatment effect when outcomes are time-to-event in nature. The methods in the paper are illustrated by estimating the effect of discharge statin prescribing on the risk of death in a sample of patients hospitalized with acute myocardial infarction. In this tutorial article, we describe and illustrate all the steps necessary to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the effect of treatment on time-to-event outcomes.",

Membrane isolation, sample workup, and LC-MS/MS analyses were as described before by our laboratory. Briefly, total native membrane proteins, isolated from the liver tissue and cryopreserved hepatocytes, were trypsin digested and quantified by LC-MS/MS using signature peptide(s) unique to each transporter. The mean \u00b1 S.D. (maximum/minimum range in parentheses) protein expression (fmol/\u00b5g of membrane protein) in human liver tissue was OATP1B1- 2.0 \u00b1 0.9 (7), OATP1B3- 1.1 \u00b1 0.5 (8), OATP2B1- 1 1.7 \u00b1 0.6 (5), and P-gp- 0.4 \u00b1 0.2 (8). Transporter expression in the liver tissue was comparable to that in the cryopreserved hepatocytes. Most important is that livers with SLCO1B1 (encoding OATP1B1) haplotypes *14/*14 and *14/*1a [i.e., representing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), c.388A > G, and c.463C > A] had significantly higher (P < 0.0001) protein expression than the reference haplotype (*1a/*1a). Based on these genotype-dependent protein expression data, we predicted (using Simcyp) an up to \u223c40% decrease in the mean area under the curve of rosuvastatin or repaglinide in subjects harboring these variant alleles compared with those harboring the reference alleles. SLCO1B3 (encoding OATP1B3) SNPs did not significantly affect protein expression. Age and sex were not associated with transporter protein expression. These data will facilitate the prediction of population-based human transporter-mediated drug disposition, drug-drug interactions, and interindividual variability through physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling.", 
    "29": "We report an unusual case of left main thrombosis with distal embolization in the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). Two filter wires were placed in both LAD and circumflex coronary arteries at the beginning of the procedure. Manual thrombectomy was performed but only a portion of the left main thrombosis was removed; residual debris was displaced into the distal LAD but captured by the filter. A loco-regional infusion of abciximab was finally administered by a microporous balloon in order to treat residual embolization in the distal LAD. This case shows that manual thrombectomy does not always allow for complete and safe removal of thrombotic material, especially when high-burden coronary thrombosis occurs in large, proximal vessels. A multi-device approach has proved useful in this patient, allowing to obtain complete resolution of luminal thrombosis.", 
    "30": "Acute atherosis (Aa) affects uteroplacental spiral arteries in 20-40% of cases of preeclampsia. Its hallmark is lipid-filled, CD68-positive foam cells. It usually develops in the decidua (the pregnancy endometrium) at the distal ends of arteries that are often unremodelled in their proximal segments. Aa resembles the early stages of atherosclerosis, which becomes symptomatic in the middle-aged and elderly, in contrast to the young age of pregnant women with Aa. Although the mechanisms of Aa are largely unknown, they are likely to resemble those of early atherosclerosis, which is an inflammatory lesion of the arterial wall. However, Aa is likely to have added pregnancy-specific features. Because it also occurs in normotensive pregnancies, complicated by foetal growth restriction, diabetes mellitus or autoimmune disease or even without any complications, we suggest that Aa is the final manifestation of several inflammatory processes. We revisit an old proposition that immunological incompatibility between mother and foetus may sometimes induce Aa. We propose that excessive inflammatory activation, of other aetiologies, primarily in the decidua basalis, may explain the different ways in which Aa occurs. We speculate that the subset of women who develop these lesions may be at an increased risk of atherosclerotic arterial disease later in life. We hypothesise that use of anti-atherogenic statins during established preeclampsia may ameliorate Aa, improve uteroplacental perfusion and enhance pregnancy outcome.", 
    "31": "Metformin is a kind of oral hypoglycemic agents commonly prescribed to patients with diabetes mellitus. Although past studies had proven its protective effect on cardiovascular risk and related mortality, the evidence of metformin on stroke prevention was still insufficient and conflicting. Our study randomly selected 14,856 patients with diabetes from the database provided by the Taiwan National Health Research Institute, and 2 cohorts were formulated according to whether metformin was in the prescription record. All cases were followed up for 4 years to track their stroke incidence. As a result, 701 (17.5%) of 3999 diabetic patients had stroke without metformin use, whereas 994 (9.2%) of 10,857 patients had stroke with metformin use. Cox proportional hazard regressions showed that the stroke hazard ratio (HR) of metformin was .383. After adjustment for the patients' age, gender, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, and medications including antiplatelets, coumadin, statin, and estrogen use, the HR was still .468. Further stratified analysis revealed that metformin had more protective effect in the patients with higher risk of stroke. Therefore, metformin should be placed in priority when prescribing oral hypoglycemic agents for diabetic patients when considering stroke prevention according to our study.",

Regrettably, the primary prevention of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events in psychiatry is a neglected area in clinical practice as well as in interventional research, whether in high- or in low-risk patients. Initial concerns notwithstanding, psychiatric complications do not appear to be important among the adverse effects of statins. Although statins are associated with an increased risk of incident diabetes mellitus, myopathy, and other untoward consequences, the risk-benefit ratio appears to favor statin use. The advisability of using statins in low-risk or medically healthy subjects remains debatable.", 
    "35": "Overweight, obesity, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and the metabolic syndrome are common in patients with major mental illness, and these increase the risk of medical morbidity and mortality.

    "39": "mCRP, but not nCRP, induced a significant activation in platelet deposition, whereas SAP induced an activation only on fibrinogen-coated substrates. The effects of CRP on platelet deposition were significantly reduced by statin treatment. mCRP resulting from recirculation of blood containing nCRP over a thrombogenic vessel wall induced increased platelet deposition. Blocking glycoprotein IIb-IIIa prevented the effects of CRP dissociation and significantly reduced platelet deposition. Annexin V treatment did not block monomerization of CRP on activated platelets.", 
    "40": "Under flow conditions, platelet deposited on all tested biological substrates support nCRP dissociation into mCRP. The effect is dependent on the thrombogenic potency of the substrate to trigger initial platelet deposition. Exposure of glycoprotein IIb-IIIa in the platelet surface supports nCRP dissociation. CRP monomerization was not dependent on the aminophospholipid exposed on the surface of activated platelets. The dissociated mCRP is trapped in the growing platelet aggregate and stimulates further platelet deposition. SAP increases platelet deposition only on fibrin monolayers.

In recent years, due to acceleration of the drug discovery and development process, there is a significant need for highly efficient methodologies for structural elucidation. In this work, we devised and standardized a simple and economical online hydrogen-deuterium exchange methodology, which can be used for structure elucidation purposes. Deuterium oxide (D2O) was infused as a postcolumn addition using the syringe pump at the time of elution of the analyte. The obtained hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange spectrum of the unknown analyte was compared with the nonexchanged spectrum, and the extent of deuterium incorporation was delineated by using an algorithm to deconvolute partial H/D exchange, which confirmed the number of labile hydrogen(s) in the analyte. The procedure was standardized by optimizing flow rates of LC output, D2O infusion, sheath gas, and auxiliary gas using the model compound sulfasalazine. The robustness of the methodology was demonstrated by performing sensitivity analysis of various parameters such as concentrations of analyte, effect of matrices, concentrations of aqueous mobile phase, and types of LC modifiers. The optimized technique was also applied to chemically diverse analytes and tested on various mass spectrometers. Moreover, utility of the technique was demonstrated in the areas of impurity profiling and metabolite identification, taking pravastatin-lactone and N-oxide desloratidine, as examples.",

Recent studies have indicated that H2S is synthesized by CSE in perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT), and is responsible for the anticontractile effect of PVAT on adjacent vessels. The lipophilic statin atorvastatin increases PVAT-derived H2S by suppressing its mitochondrial oxidation; the effect that results from statin-induced depletion of ubiquinone. Experimental obesity induced by a highly palatable diet has a time-dependent effect on H2S in PVAT. Adipose tissue hypoxia suppresses H2S oxidation and increases its level in short-term obesity not associated with insulin resistance. In contrast, in long-term obesity, insulin resistance and (or) hyperinsulinemia result in the down-regulation of CSE and H2S deficiency, which is corrected by treatment with the insulin sensitizer rosiglitazone. In addition, cannabinoid CB1 receptor agonist administered for 2 weeks increases H2S by impairing mitochondria biogenesis. This indicates that the rate of mitochondrial H2S oxidation plays an important role in the regulation of H2S level in PVAT. Up-regulation of H2S signaling in short-term obesity and (or) by elevated endocannabinoids may be a compensatory mechanism that maintains vascular tone, despite endothelial dysfunction.", 
    "59": "Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) directly binds to the epidermal growth factor-like repeat A domain of low-density lipoprotein receptor and induces its degradation, thereby controlling circulating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentration. Heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in PCSK9 can decrease the incidence of coronary heart disease by up to 88%, owing to lifelong reduction of LDL-C. Moreover, two subjects with PCSK9 loss-of-function mutations on both alleles, resulting in a total absence of functional PCSK9, were found to have extremely low circulating LDL-C levels without other apparent abnormalities. Accordingly, PCSK9 could represent a safe and effective pharmacological target to increase clearance of LDL-C and to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease. Recent clinical trials using anti-PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies that block the PCSK9:low-density lipoprotein receptor interaction were shown to considerably reduce LDL-C levels by up to 65% when given alone and by up to 72% in patients already receiving statin therapy. In this review, we will discuss how major scientific breakthroughs in PCSK9 cell biology have led to the development of new and forthcoming LDL-C-lowering pharmacological agents.",

Candidate models obtained from the SOHGA runs were further assessed for biological plausibility and the precision of parameter estimates, followed by traditional backward elimination process for model refinement. The final population pharmacokinetic model shows that the elimination rate constant for simvastatin acid, the active form by hydrolysis of its lactone prodrug (i.e., simvastatin), is only 44% in the concurrent amlodipine administration group compared with the non-concurrent group.

Simvastation, widely used for lowering serum cholesterol, is known to have a bone stimulatory effect. However, it is not clear whether simvastation affects the differentiation of PDLSCs. This study examined the effects of simvastatin on human PDLSCs in vitro and in vivo. Using the limiting dilution technique, human PDLSCs were isolated and expanded. PDLSCs were cultured with simvastatin (0.01-10 \u03bcM), and the proliferation was measured. The osteogenic differentiation was characterized by alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and Alizarin Red-S staining for calcium deposition. The gene expression levels of osteogenic markers were evaluated by RT-PCR. In addition, PDLSCs were transplanted into nude mice with ceramic bovine bone powders as carriers to observe the capacity of mineralized tissue formation in vivo. Simvastatin at concentrations <1 \u03bcM did not suppress the proliferation of PDLSCs. After the administration of 0.1 \u03bcM simvastatin, the expression of ALP, bone sialoprotein, and bone morphogenetic protein-2 genes were significantly upregulated, and the ALP activity and mineralized nodule formation were significantly higher in the simvastatin-treated cells than the control cells. In addition, the in vivo transplantation results showed that simvastatin treatment promoted the degree of mineralized tissue formation. Collectively, simvastatin has positive effects on osteogenic differentiation of human PDLSCs in vitro and in vivo. This suggests that simvastatin might be a useful osteogenic induction agent for periodontal bone regeneration.",

Three-month-old male Wistar rats treated for 21 days with simvastatin or vehicle were tested in the social interaction, elevated plus-maze, and inhibitory avoidance tasks; after behavioral testing, the amygdala, hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, dorsal, and ventral striatum were dissected out for biochemical assays. In order to delve deeper into the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed effects, primary rat hippocampal neurons were used. Our results show that HMGR inhibition by simvastatin induces anxiogenic-like effects in the social interaction but not in the elevated plus-maze test, and improves memory consolidation in the inhibitory avoidance task. These effects are accompanied by imbalances in the activity of specific prenylated proteins, Rab3 and RhoA, involved in neurotransmitter release, and synaptic plasticity, respectively. Taken together, the present findings indicate that the isoprenoid/cholesterol biosynthetic pathway is critically involved in the physiological modulation of both emotional and cognitive processes in rodents.",

The risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) associated with high levels of LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) can be reduced by treatment with statins, which reduce LDL-C levels by inhibiting cellular cholesterol synthesis. However, patients who are treated with high doses of statins, especially secondary CAD prevention, regardless of their resulting LDL-C levels, are still at high risk of CAD. Therefore, there has been growing interest in HDL-directed therapies. Inhibitors of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) substantially increase HDL-C levels (by 31-138%). However, it is still unclear whether or not CETP inhibitors can reduce the risk of CAD associated with low HDL-C levels, while reconstituted HDL or apolipoprotein A-I mimetic peptides increase the functionality of HDL. Low levels of HDL-C are often complicated with metabolic disorders, including hypertriglyceridemia, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, and lifestyle changes are effective for correcting these conditions. Physical activity and exercise training increase HDL-C levels, especially HDL2-C levels, by multiple mechanisms. Therefore, although using HDL-directed therapies that increase HDL-C levels and/or improve the function of HDL is a reasonable approach for reducing the residual risk of CAD as a complement to LDL-C-lowering therapy, lifestyle modifications including exercise to improve metabolic disorders should be considered as the first option.",

Peripheral blood cells were counted, and the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and the malondialdehyde (MDA) level in tissues of both thymus and spleen were measured. Compared with the radiation-only group, 20 mg/kg/d simvastatin administration significantly increased the mean villi height and decreased apoptotic cells in jejunum tissue, and stimulated regeneration and reduced apoptotic cells in bone marrow. Peripheral blood cell analysis revealed that simvastatin treatment induced a larger number of red blood cells and increased the hemoglobin level present after 4 Gy of radiation. Interestingly, it was also found that the number of peripheral endothelial progenitor cells was markedly increased following simvastatin administration. Antioxidant determination for tissues displayed that simvastatin therapy increased the SOD activity after both 4 and 8 Gy of radiation, but only decreased the MDA level after 4 Gy. Simvastatin ameliorated radiation-induced tissue damage in mice.

We have here extended the assessment of metabolic drug stability in a standard human hepatocyte incubation to allow for elucidation of the distribution-metabolism interplay established for substrates of drug transporters. Cellular concentration-time profiles were obtained from incubations of eight known OATP substrates at 1 \u03bcM, each for two different 10-donor batches of suspended cryopreserved human hepatocytes. The kinetic data sets were analyzed using a mechanistic mathematical model that allowed for separate estimation of active uptake, bidirectional diffusion, metabolism and nonspecific extracellular and intracellular binding. The range of intrinsic clearances attributed to active uptake, diffusion and metabolism of the test set spanned more than 2 orders of magnitude each, with median values of 18, 5.3, and 0.5 \u03bcL/min/10(6) cells, respectively. This is to be compared with the values for the apparent clearance from the incubations, which only spanned 1 order of magnitude with a median of 2.6 \u03bcL/min/10(6) cells. The parameter estimates of the two pooled 10-donor hepatocyte batches investigated displayed only small differences in contrast to the variability associated with use of cells from individual donors reported in the literature. The active contribution to the total cellular uptake ranged from 55% (glyburide) to 96% (rosuvastatin), with an unbound intra-to-extracellular concentration ratio at steady state of 2.1 and 17, respectively. Principal component analysis showed that the parameter estimates of the investigated compounds were largely influenced by lipophilicity.

As such, apolipoprotein measures may be of particular relevance for subjects with PAD and claudication. We compared plasma apolipoprotein profiles in 29 subjects with peripheral artery disease (PAD) and intermittent claudication and in 39 control subjects. Furthermore, we compared the plasma apolipoprotein profiles of subjects with PAD either treated (n = 17) or untreated (n = 12) with statin medications. For the apolipoprotein subparticle analyses, subjects with PAD had higher age-adjusted Lp-B:C (P < 0.05) and lower values of Lp-A-I:A-II (P < 0.05) than controls. The PAD group taking statins had lower age-adjusted values for apoB (P < 0.05), Lp-A-II:B:C:D:E (P < 0.05), Lp-B:E + Lp-B:C:E (P < 0.05), Lp-B:C (P < 0.05), and Lp-A-I (P < 0.05) than the untreated PAD group. Subjects with PAD have impaired apolipoprotein profiles than controls, characterized by Lp-B:C and Lp-A-I:A-II. Furthermore, subjects with PAD on statin medications have a more favorable risk profile, particularly noted in multiple apolipoprotein subparticles. The efficacy of statin therapy to improve cardiovascular risk appears more evident in the apolipoprotein sub-particle profile than in the more traditional lipid profile of subjects with PAD and claudication.

    "113": "Statins are a class of drugs that inhibit the rate-limiting step in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway and show an anticancer effect, probably through the inhibition of cell proliferation. To date, the exact mechanism of cancer cell growth arrest induced by statins is not known. We report that simvastatin is able to induce apoptosis in melanoma cells but not in normal cells and also able to contrast the growth of tumor in an experimental melanoma murine model. We observed a delay in the tumor development in almost the 50% of the simvastatin administered animals and a strong reduction of the tumor volume with a differences of ~150% compared to the controls. Also the survival rate was significantly higher in mice that received the drug with a survival increase of ~130% compared to the controls. The tumor growth reduction in mice was supported by the results of cell migration assay, confirming that simvastatin clearly reduced cell migration. Moreover, simvastatin induced a strong downregulation of NonO gene expression, an important growth factor involved in the splicing regulation. This result could explain the decrease of melanoma cells proliferation, suggesting a possible action mechanism. The results derived from our experiments may sustain the many reports on the anticancer inhibitory property of statins and encourage new studies on this drug for a possible use in therapy, probably in combination with conventional chemotherapy.",

In 1993 near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) was first used to detect the lipid (cholesterol) content of atherosclerotic plaques in an experimental animal study. NIRS was then carefully validated using human atherosclerotic plaques (ex vivo), and has subsequently been developed for intracoronary imaging in humans, for which now an FDA-approved catheter-based NIRS system is available. NIRS provides a \"chemogram\" of the coronary artery wall and is used to detect lipid-rich plaques. Using this technology, recent studies have shown that lipid-rich plaques are very frequent in the culprit lesion of patients with an acute coronary syndrome, and are also common in non-culprit coronary lesions in these patients as compared to patients with stable coronary disease. First studies are evaluating the impact of statin therapy on coronary NIRS-detected lipid cores.

Plasma Lp-PLA\u2082 is mainly associated with apolipoprotein (apo)B-containing lipoproteins, primarily with low density lipoproteins (LDLs). Importantly, only a proportion of circulating lipoproteins contain Lp-PLA\u2082. We determined the plasma levels of Lp-PLA\u2082-bound apoB (apoB/Lp-PLA\u2082) in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia. The effect of simvastatin therapy was also addressed. The plasma apoB/Lp-PLA\u2082 concentration in 50 normolipidemic controls and 53 patients with primary hypercholesterolemia at baseline and at 3 months posttreatment with simvastatin (40 mg/day) was determined by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The concentration of the apoB-containing lipoproteins that do not bind Lp-PLA\u2082 [apoB/Lp-PLA\u2082\u207b] was calculated by subtracting the apoB/Lp-PLA\u2082 from total apoB. The apoB/Lp-PLA\u2082 levels were 3.6-fold higher, while apoB/Lp-PLA\u2082\u207b were 1.3-fold higher in patients compared with controls. After 3 months of simvastatin treatment apoB/Lp-PLA\u2082 and apoB/Lp-PLA\u2082\u207b levels were reduced by 52% and 33%, respectively. The elevation in apoB-containing lipoproteins in hypercholesterolemic patients is mainly attributed to the relative increase in the proatherogenic apoB/Lp-PLA\u2082, while simvastatin reduces these particles to a higher extent compared with apoB/Lp-PLA\u2082\u207b.

Statins are also involved in immunomodulation, which might influence the outcome of bacterial infection. Hence, a possible effect of statin treatment on Listeriosis was explored in mice. Statin treatment prior to subsequent L. monocytogenes infection strikingly reduced bacterial burden in liver and spleen (up to 100-fold) and reduced histopathological lesions. Statin-treatment in infected macrophages resulted in increased IL-12p40 and TNF-\u03b1 and up to 4-fold reduced bacterial burden within 6 hours post infection, demonstrating a direct effect of statins on limiting bacterial growth in macrophages. Bacterial uptake was normal investigated in microbeads and GFP-expressing Listeria experiments by confocal microscopy. However, intracellular membrane-bound cholesterol level was decreased, as analyzed by cholesterol-dependent filipin staining and cellular lipid extraction. Mevalonate supplementation restored statin-inhibited cholesterol biosynthesis and reverted bacterial growth in Listeria monocytogenes but not in listeriolysin O (LLO)-deficient Listeria. Together, these results suggest that statin pretreatment increases protection against L. monocytogenes infection by reducing membrane cholesterol in macrophages and thereby preventing effectivity of the cholesterol-dependent LLO-mediated phagosomal escape of bacteria.",

An age/gender/treatment-matched group of adult-onset non-FH hypercholesterolaemic patients (n=37/group) was comparatively analysed. cMPs were characterised by flow cytometry using annexin-V and cell surface-specific antibodies. Our study shows that LLT-FH patients had higher overall cMP-numbers (p<0.005) than LLT-non-FH patients. Endothelial cell-shed cMPs were also significantly higherin FH (p<0.0005). Within the leukocyte-derived cMP-subpopulations, FH-patients had significantly higher lymphocyte- and monocyte-derived cMP-numbers as well as cMPs carrying leukocyte-activation markers. Normalisation of cMPs by LDL levels did not affect cMP number or phenotype, indicating that the proinflammatory effect was derived from chronic vascular damage. Levels of AV+-total, CD45+-pan-leukocyte and CD45+/CD3+-lymphocyte-derived cMPs were significantly higher in FH-patients with subclinical lipid-rich atherosclerotic plaques than fibrous plaques. Levels of CD45+/CD3+-lymphocyte-MPs above 20,000/ml could differentiate between FH-patients with lipidic or non-lipidic plaques (area under the ROC curve of 0.803, 95%CI: 0.641-0.965, p=0.008). In summary, in this snapshot cross-sectional study cMP concentration and phenotype in FH differed markedly from non-FH hypercholesterolaemia. Patients with life-long high LDL exposure have higher endothelial activation and higher proinflammatory profile, even under current state-of-the-art LLT. cMPs carrying lymphocyte-epitopes appear as markers of lipid-rich atherosclerotic plaques in FH.",

A total of 48 Sprague-Dawley rats were allocated to 4 groups of sham, Epo, Simv and control. Unilateral ureteral ligation was performed on all rats except the Sham group. For interstitial fibrosis Masson's trichrome stain and for the expression of TGF-\u03b2, PDGF-B, bFGF, NF\u03baB and fibronectin, immunohistochemical methods were used. In the Epo and Simv groups, expression of TGF-\u03b2 and fibronectin and staining with Masson's trichrome were less compared to the control group. In addition, fibronectin expression in the Epo group was less than the Simv group. Unlike the Simv group, NF\u03baB and bFGF expression in the Epo group were less when compared to the control group. Consequently, it was seen that both Epo and Simv prevented fibrosis in ON. Epo was superior in this effect by suppressing the expressions of NF\u03baB and bFGF more effectively than Simv. Based on this finding, Epo might be a better agent than Simv in the prevention of fibrosis in ON.",

Prevention of new-onset AF is therefore a potential therapeutic target in AS and MI patients. Lipid-lowering drugs, particularly statins, have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that may prevent AF. Accordingly, statins are recommended as a class IIa recommendation for prevention of new-onset AF after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). However, this preventive effect has not been investigated on new-onset AF in asymptomatic patients with AS or a large scale first-time MI patient sample and data in patients not undergoing invasive cardiac interventions are limited. This PhD thesis was conducted at the Heart Centre, Rigshospitalet, Denmark, with the aim to investigate the three aforementioned questions and to add to the existing evidence of AF prevention with statins. This was done using three different settings: 1) a randomized patients sample of 1,873 from the Simvastatin and Ezetimibe in Aortic Stenosis (SEAS) study, 2) a register patient sample of 97,499 with first-time MI, and 3) all published studies until beginning of June 2011 examining statin treatment on new-onset and recurrent AF in patients not undergoing cardiac surgery. This thesis revealed that statins did not lower the incidence or the time to new-onset AF in patients with asymptomatic AS. However, statin treatment showed an independently preventive effect on new-onset AF, including type-dependent effect and a trend to dosage-dependent effect. In addition, this thesis showed that good compliance to statin treatment was important to prevent new-onset AF. Finally, the meta-analysis in this PhD thesis showed a preventive effect in the observational studies although this effect was absent in the randomized controlled trials. Based on this PhD thesis, although there might be an effect in MI patients, primary statin treatment to prevent new-onset AF cannot be recommended in AS patients or in patients not undergoing cardiac surgery.",

RSV biliary clearance (CLBile) was ablated almost completely by GF120918 in TR(-) IPLs, confirming that Mrp2 and Bcrp primarily are responsible for RSV CLBile. RSV appearance in outflow perfusate was attributed primarily to CLBL, which was impaired in TR(-) IPLs. CLBL was \u2248 6-fold greater than CLBile in the linear range in WT IPLs in the absence of GF120918. Recovery of unchanged RSV in liver tissue increased in TR(-) compared with WT (\u2248 25 versus 6% of the administered dose) due to impaired CLBL and CLBile. RSV pentanoic acid, identified by high-resolution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy, comprised \u2248 40% of total liver content and \u2248 16% of the administered dose in TR(-) livers at the end of perfusion, compared with \u2248 30 and 3% in WT livers, consistent with impaired RSV excretion and \"shunting\" to the metabolic pathway. In vitro-ex vivo extrapolation between WT SCH and IPLs (without GF120918) revealed that uptake clearance and CLBL were 4.2- and 6.4-fold lower, respectively, in rat SCH compared with IPLs; CLBile translated almost directly (1.1-fold). The present IPL data confirmed the significant role of CLBL in RSV hepatic elimination, and demonstrated that both CLBL and CLBile influence RSV hepatic and systemic exposure.", 
    "219": "The association of nonfunctional variants of the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) with efficacy of statins has been a subject of debate. We evaluated whether three functional CETP variants influence statin efficacy. The effect of CETP genotype on achieved levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDLc), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc), and total cholesterol during statin treatment was estimated by meta-analysis of the linear regression outcomes of three studies (11,021 individuals). The effect of these single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on statin response in protecting against myocardial infarction (MI) was estimated by meta-analysis of statin \u00d7 SNP interaction terms from logistic regression in five studies (16,570 individuals). The enhancer SNP rs3764261 significantly increased HDLc by 0.02 mmol/l per T allele (P = 6\u2009\u00d7\u200910(-5)) and reduced protection against MI by statins (interaction odds ratio (OR) = 1.19 per T allele; P = 0.04). Focusing on functional CETP variants, we showed that in carriers of the rs3764261 T variant, HDLc increased more during statin treatment, and protection against MI by statins appeared to be reduced as compared with those in noncarriers.", 
    "220": "The combination of pegylated interferon-\u03b1 and ribavirin is a standard-of-care (SOC) treatment for chronic hepatitis C (CHC), and it achieves a sustained virological response (SVR) in 41-52% of genotype 1 and in 73-79% of genotype 3 patients. In a few clinical trials, the combination of fluvastatin and SOC increased the SVR in genotype 1 patients.", 
    "221": "This prospective study enrolled 179 na\u00efve CHC patients. In the fluvastatin group patients received the combination of SOC and fluvastatin 80 mg daily; historical controls matching the study group in genotype, age and gender were treated with the SOC treatment only.", 
    "222": "On-treatment viral responses as well as the SVR did not differ significantly between the two groups, except for the genotype 1 patients with a high viral load presenting a significantly higher SVR rate in the fluvastatin group (75%) compared to the control group (41%; p = 0.024). Multivariate logistic regression identified hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 3 infection (p < 0.001), age \u226440 years (p < 0.001), liver steatosis <5% (p < 0.01) and low viral load (p < 0.001) as independent predictors of an SVR.", 
    "223": "A combination of fluvastatin and SOC significantly improved the SVR in na\u00efve CHC patients infected with HCV genotype 1 and high viral load, but it did not improve the SVR in patients infected with HCV genotype 3.", 
    "224": "Cancer risk reduction using pharmacological means is an attractive modern preventive approach that supplements the classical behavioural prevention recommendations. Medications that are commonly used by large populations to treat a variety of common, non-cancer-related, medical situations are an attractive candidate pool. This Review discusses three pharmacological agents with the most evidence for their potential as cancer chemopreventive agents: anti-hypercholesterolaemia medications (statins), an antidiabetic agent (metformin) and antiosteoporosis drugs (bisphosphonates). Data are accumulating to support a significant negative association of certain statins with cancer occurrence or survival in several major tumour sites (mostly gastrointestinal tumours and breast cancer), with an augmented combined effect with aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Metformin, but not other hypoglycaemic drugs, also seems to have some antitumour growth activity, but the amount of evidence in human studies, mainly in breast cancer, is still limited. Experimental and observational data have identified bisphosphonates as a pharmacological group that could have significant impact on incidence and mortality of more than one subsite of malignancy. At the current level of evidence these potential chemopreventive drugs should be considered in high-risk situations or using the personalized approach of maximizing individual benefits and minimizing the potential for adverse effects with the aid of pharmacogenetic indicators.", 
    "225": "Elevated triglyceride levels seem to predispose to the earlier development and accelerated progression of coronary artery disease. In our study, we assessed for the first time whether simvastatin treatment affects coagulation and fibrinolysis in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia.", 
    "226": "The study included 39 patients with elevated triglyceride levels and peripheral artery sclerosis, treated for 90 days with either simvastatin (40 mg daily) or placebo. Plasma lipids, glucose homeostasis markers and hemostasic variables were assessed at baseline and after treatment.", 
    "227": "Simvastatin, but not placebo, administered to these patients reduced plasma levels/activity of fibrinogen (from 3.5 \u00b1 0.4 to 2.8 \u00b1 0.3 g/l, p < 0.01), factor VII (from 144.2 \u00b1 16.9 to 112.5 \u00b1 14.0%, p < 0.01) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (from 76.9 \u00b1 13.5 to 50.2 \u00b1 9.2 ng/ml, p < 0.001), without a significant reduction in von Willebrand factor levels, and tended to prolong the prothrombin and partial thromboplastin times.", 
    "228": "Our results suggest that statin treatment produces a multidirectional effect on coagulation and fibrinolysis in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridemia and that this treatment may bring some benefits to patients with elevated triglyceride levels.", 
    "229": "The effect of statins on the prevention of cardiovascular events is well-established. However, a recent controversy in France questioned the value of statins, especially in primary prevention.", 
    "230": "To evaluate the impact of this controversy on patient adherence to statin therapy and its potential clinical impact.", 
    "231": "All patients on statins were recruited consecutively from consultations over a period of 1 month (from March 2013) by five physicians in three centres. Patient demographics and co-morbidities were collected and adherence to statin therapy was evaluated with a questionnaire. We estimated the number of deaths and major cardiovascular events that could be induced per year.", 
    "232": "A total of 142 patients were included: 37 in primary prevention (mean age, 68.0\u00b113.1 years; 41% women); 105 in secondary prevention (mean age, 67.6\u00b112.1 years; 20% women). In primary prevention, 24.3% of patients intended to stop statins versus 8.6% in secondary prevention (P<0.001). In France, if the percentages of medication discontinuations following the controversy were actually similar to those we found in our survey, 4992 major cardiovascular events, including 1159 deaths, would be induced in 1 year.", 
    "233": "Recent controversy over statins could induce a large proportion of patients to stop their medication and generate a large number of major cardiovascular events."
