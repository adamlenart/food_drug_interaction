    "1": "Abstract Lipoprotein-related risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) can be adequately predicted in subjects with elevated total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL-)cholesterol using the available guidelines. However, individuals with dyslipidemia can have normal total- and LDL-cholesterol concentrations. Many statin-treated patients remain at high residual risk of CVD despite achieving LDL goals. The small dense LDL phenotype, frequently presenting with hypertriglyceridemia and low high-density lipoprotein (HDL-)cholesterol (lipid triad), may contribute to failure to identify and treat high-risk individuals. Therefore, calculated non-HDL-cholesterol is recommended as secondary therapeutic target to LDL-cholesterol in patients with hypertriglyceridemia and mixed dyslipidemia. On-treatment apolipoprotein B adds prognostic information to LDL- and non-HDL-cholesterol by indicating the total number of atherogenic lipoproteins, regardless of their cholesterol content. Risk may be higher than indicated in the risk estimation systems in additional subjects with elevated lipoprotein(a) and homocysteine concentrations. To improve the (post-)post-analytical phase of lipid tests, aiming for maximal health outcome effectiveness of test interpretation and utilization, laboratory professionals should deliver clinical added value services by providing readily interpreted and guideline-adjusted test reports, interpretative commenting, proactive reflex testing or recommending additional tests, and joining multidisciplinary cooperations in guideline development and cost/benefit studies.",

It highlights the need for physicians to be aware of individual patient risk factors predisposing to statin induced myopathy. It also highlights the need for further research into cholesterol lowering drugs which do not have such side effects. When prescribing statins for patients, we must also explain potential side effects following initiation of therapy and with dose titrations.",

The authors report a case of DM occurring after simvastatin intake. A 50-year-old male sought medical attention for a photodistributed rash and considerable muscular weakness present for 3 months. One year earlier, simvastatin had been introduced. Serum creatine kinase levels were elevated. Histological examination of a muscle biopsy was consistent with a diagnosis of DM. Investigation for neoplasia and associated autoimmune disease proved negative. All clinical and laboratory abnormalities diminished corticosteroid therapy (1 mg/kg/day). Case reports have suggested that lipid-lowering drugs, especially statins, could induce or reveal chronic muscle diseases. In statins myopathy, reduction of coenzyme Q has been discussed as a key mechanism. Our case of DM in a patient receiving simvastatin adds to the previous reported cases in the literature and highlights the potential role of statins as triggers of immune systemic diseases.",

This paper presents the cases of two first-degree male relative patients (father and son) identified by self-referral to the University of California in San Diego Statin Effects Study. Both patients experienced behavioural adverse effects on statins including irritability and aggression, however neither patient recognised a significant change in their behaviour. This may be the first report of behavioural adverse effects manifested on statins by first-degree male relatives, which may suggest possible familial/biological predisposition. These cases also highlight the issue of externalisation by patients of the origin of interpersonal discord, which may serve as an obstacle to adverse effects reporting and lead to negative outcomes for patients, and for those around them.",

    "8": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a well-known complication of diabetes mellitus (DM), and patients with DM are at an increased risk for early onset of CVD. Hyperglycemia is believed to be the primary mediator in premature development of atherosclerosis in patients with DM, but there are also derangements in cholesterol levels and inflammatory markers beyond the explanation of hyperglycemia. Although clinicians often screen for dyslipidemia as part of routine care for children and adolescents with DM, many do not feel comfortable treating this condition. Multiple guidelines exist to help clinicians with the prevention, screening, and treatment of CVD risk factors in pediatric patients with DM, but the guidelines do not always agree on screening intervals or medical treatment. Furthermore, the cost-effectiveness of medication use in this population has not been established. Research has advanced our understanding of the role of other biomarkers and radiologic studies of CVD risk, but these studies do not currently have a place in routine clinical practice. It is evident that the increased CVD risk in pediatric patients with DM is complex in origin and the optimal approach to managing dyslipidemia remains unclear. Therefore, an algorithm designed at the University of North Carolina (UNC), Division of Pediatric Endocrinology, is presented to help guide clinicians through screening and treatment of dyslipidemia in youth with DM.",

In the present study, we investigated the effect of the fungal elicitor and the mutagenesis of UV & LiCl on the amount of monacolin K produced by Monascus purpureus. The fugal elicitor, Sporobolomyces huaxiensis, was isolated from tea leaves and its filtrate was added into the culture filtrate of Monascus purpureus during growth to induct the production of monacolin K. The results showed that the highest amount of monacolin K produced by the liquid fermentation was 446.92 mg/mL, which was produced after the fungal elicitor was added to the culture filtrate of Monascus purpureus on the day 4; this amount was approximately 6 times greater than that of the control culture filtrate, whereas the highest amount of monacolin K produced by the mutated strain was 3 times greater than the control culture after the irradiation of UV light in the presence of 1.0 % LiCl in the medium.",

Despite advances in supportive care and transplant conditioning regimens graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), infectious complications and end organ toxicity remain the leading causes of transplant related mortality (TRM). Development of safe and effective strategies to mitigate these significant complications associated with HSCT, are urgently needed. Statins are lipid lowering drugs, which reduce cholesterol production by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, with a well defined toxicity profile. Statins have pleiotropic immunomodulatory effects which are relevant in the context of treating and preventing GVHD. In addition to GVHD statins may possess several other effects that might have clinical benefit in the setting of hematopoietic cell transplantation, such as treatment of bronchiolitis obliterans and antineoplastic activity.

This study was conducted to determine the effect of statins on the serum levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (HSCPR). MATERIALS AND METHODS. This randomized clinical trial was carried out on 95 hemodialysis patients divided into three groups of atorvastatin, 10 mg; simvastatin, 20 mg; and lovastatin, 40 mg, daily, administered for 2 months. Levels of serum HSCRP, IL-6, and LDLC were all measured before and after the study period. RESULTS. At baseline, 59% of the hemodialysis patients presented with elevated HSCRP, 46.3% them had increased IL-6, and 26.3% had an increased LDLC level. The three drugs were capable to lower the level of HSCRP, among which atorvastatin had the highest effect size (41.8% reduction, P = .001). Lovastatin stood in the next (37.6% reduction, P = .02), while HSCRP reduction was not significant in the simvastatin group (25% reduction, P = .14). Neither of the drugs significantly reduced IL-6 levels. Effects of atorvastatin and simvastatin on the LDLC levels were significant, while lovastatin had a marginal effect. CONCLUSIONS. Use of statins resulted in CRP reduction in patients on hemodialysis. Atorvastatin was much more effective than lovastatin, while CRP reduction was not significant by simvastatin. However, simvastatin had the greatest impact on LDLC. None of these drugs could reduce IL-6 levels within 2 months.",

Since lovastatin is used worldwide as a cholesterol lowering drug, the present study was undertaken to evaluate the antioxidant property of lovastatin against H(2)O(2) induced oxidative stress in rats. Four study groups of rats of four animals each were treated with DMSO (control), H(2)O(2) (OS), lovastatin (L) and H(2)O(2) + lovastatin (OSL). On the 15th day the animals were sacrificed, and the liver and heart tissues were analyzed for oxidative stress biomarkers and anti-oxidant enzymes. Results of the OSL-group showed a reduction in thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in liver (42.7%) and heart tissue (8%) compared with the control group. An increase was observed in the activity of the antioxidant enzymes, catalase (34.6% in liver and 33.3% in heart) and glutathione peroxidase (50.5% in liver and 34.7% in heart). A commensurate increase in the activity of G6PDH was observed indicating an enhanced requirement of NADPH. The ratio GSH:GSSG in liver (1.05) and heart (0.84) was satisfactorily regulated compared to the control group (1.01 in liver and 0.93 in heart). These results suggest that lovastatin possesses antioxidant activity and reduces oxidative stress.",

Regular-administration trial data expose the time course of preventative effect of a single tablet. From 90,056 patients' trial data, event-prevention of a single statin tablet is found to develop gradually over one year. Each tablet of (modest) statin gives 0.137% relative reduction in annual mortality over one year. For an average 60-year-old UK man, absolute mortality reduction is 143 millionths of a percent (47 times larger than the survival benefit of him wearing a seatbelt once). Verification by 1-year trial would need 300 million subjects. A 1-month trial would need 4 billion, the majority of the world's population.",

Regular-administration trials show that each tablet delivers event reduction gradually over 1 year. Although the absolute death reduction seems small, for men over 35 it is larger than death reduction from wearing a seatbelt for a car journey. Physicians currently encourage opportunistic uptake of exercise, but not statins. Opportunistic pharmaceutical prevention should not be rejected without more valid grounds than lack of explicit trials.", 
    "83": "Atorvastatin is a selective HMG-CoA reductase competitive inhibitor, used for the treatment of hyperlipidaemia. It is metabolized by CYP 3A4 and 3A5 isoenzymes in liver. It also has moderate inhibition on metabolizing enzymes like CYP 2C9, 2D6 and 3A4. Hence there is more possibility of atorvastatin for inhibition of metabolism of glyburide, by both CYP 2C9 and 3A4. We have studied the effects of atorvastatin on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of glyburide in experimental diabetic rats. Atorvastatin (20mg/kg p.o.) was given to alloxan-induced diabetic rats for 7 consecutive days followed by glyburide (10mg/kg p.o.). In the rats co-treated with atorvastatin and glyburide, fasting plasma glucose concentration (60.69\u00b15.70%) was further reduced, markedly as compared with glyburide-treated animals. In co-treated group, the pharmacokinetic parameters like clearance (27.83\u00b13.55l/h) of glyburide was reduced, while peak plasma concentration (18.39\u00b15.29\u03bcg/ml), area under the plasma concentration time curve (120.02\u00b115.17\u03bcg/ml/h) and elimination half-life (4.09\u00b10.50h) were significantly increased when compared to glyburide alone administered rats. The results of this study revealed that atorvastatin led to the PK/PD changes have been due to glyburide increased bioavailability, decrease volume of distribution, and/or decrease total clearance may be due to the inhibition of cytochrome P450 metobolic system.", 
    "84": "The aim of this paper is to review the latest data on the pharmacological modulation of asymmetric dimethylarginine in human disease. When the terminal nitrogens of the guanidine portion of an arginine become methylated through the action of N-methyl transferases, two chemically close, but physiologically different amino acids are synthesized: symmetric and asymmetric dimethylarginine. The vascular origin of asymmetric dimethylarginine and its inhibitory activity on endothelial nitric oxide synthase give it an important role in certain diseases in which microcirculation is compromised: hypertension, atherosclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and diabetes. This review discusses the role that asymmetric dimethylarginine plays in the development of vascular disease, and, wherever possible, evaluates its use in clinical diagnosis. The fact that a number of chemically unrelated drugs, such as angiotensin II antagonists, selective beta- 1 adrenergic antagonists, plant phenolics, statins, and farnesoid X receptor agonists have all been found to reduce dimethylarginine levels in plasma or tissue allows for an integrated study. Although it is difficult to determine exactly why these various agents all have the same effect on arginine metabolism, an explanation of their mechanisms of action is needed. We have thus analyzed the mechanisms involved and reviewed potential trends in the therapeutic use of these drugs.",

Statins inhibit the rate-limiting enzyme of endogenous cholesterol synthesis, HMG-CoA-reductase and reduce serum cholesterol concentrations as well as cardiovascular morbidity. Indirect evidence from smaller studies shows, that patients with high baseline cholesterol absorption may show only a small response to statin treatment in terms of cholesterol lowering. Moreover, evidence from recent clinical studies suggests that increased cholesterol absorption and decreased hepatic cholesterol synthesis is associated with an increased cardiovascular risk. This article reviews the current literature on this issue and suggests prospective clinical studies to analyze whether determination of the baseline relation of cholesterol synthesis and absorption may facilitate an individualized lipid lowering therapy to further reduce cardiovascular risk.", 
    "90": "The present study examined the functional profile of dendritic cells (DCs) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and the effects of simvastatin on the function of DCs. A total of 40 patients who was recently diagnosed as having RA were equally assigned to two groups: the routine treatment group (group R) and the routine treatment plus simvastatin group (group R+S). Twenty healthy individuals served as control. The peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated before and 4 weeks after the treatment and then cultured with interleukin-4 (IL-4) and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulatory factor (GM-CSF) to prepare mature DCs. The expression of co-stimulating factor CD86 on the surface of DCs was assessed by flow cytometry. And the stimulating capacity of DCs was measured by mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR). The contents of cytokines in culture supernatants of DCs in MLR were detected by ELISA. Blood lipids and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were detected. The relationship between the expression of CD86 and the blood CRP level was also investigated. The results showed that, as compared with the control group, the CD86 expression and the level of cytokines secreted by DCs were significantly increased in RA patients and greater stimulating capacity of DCs in MLR was demonstrated in RA patients. T lymphocytes in MLR secreted higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-2, IL-17, TNF-\u03b1 and INF-\u03b3) and lower level of anti-inflammation cytokine (IL-10). The function of DCs was markedly weakened and the level of hs-CRP and low-density lipoprotein was substantially lowered in group R+S in comparison to group R. The CD86 expression was positively correlated with hs-CRP. It was concluded that DCs in RA are highly activated and DC-initiated immune reaction may play an important role in the pathogenesis of RA. Simvastatin administration can significantly inhibit the DCs function and reduce the level of hs-CRP, indicating the suppression on inflammatory reaction may be one of the mechanisms by which simvastatin exerts its effect in treating RA.",

This review focuses on HIV and HIV treatment-associated metabolic and cardiovascular concerns, including dyslipidemias, lipodystrophy syndromes, endothelial dysfunctions, and associated metabolic events such as insulin resistance. Emerging hypotheses of the underlying pathophysiology of these issues, with impact on selection of specific antiretroviral treatment (ART) strategies, therapy, and preventive approaches to decreasing cardiovascular risk and other problems associated with these syndromes are discussed. Screening for cardiovascular risk as part of the decision of starting antiretroviral therapy, and during care of patients with HIV regardless of ART therapy status, is suggested with particular areas of focus.

    "92": "Cholesterol drug lowering is a paradig on how to best apply clinical evidence to clinical practice. Considering the available options, it is essential that statins have a clear safety and tolerability profile and a favourable benefit/risk relationship. Intensive cholesterol drug lowering is not associated with deleterious consequences, dependent on a greater efficacy or on serious side effects. Statins are not hepatotoxic. Enzyme fluctuation is common in dyslipidemia. The risk of increased transaminases is directly and closely related to the dosage (and type of statin used). Minor changes in baseline liver profile are not regarded as contraindications to their use (in patients with a cardiovascular justifiable risk). Iterative monitoring of the liver profile is not necessary. The etiology of miotoxicity with statins is not completely clear. The risk of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis is not related to the absolute or percent change in the LDL-C (or with the achieved LDL-C value). The adverse effects of statins may depend on the physical and chemical characteristics of the molecule and its pharmacokinetic characteristics. On a pharmacovigilance strategy the patient also has his say. The sharing of a common goal makes the patient divide responsibilities with his Health Team, encouraging safer treatments and better cardiovascular prevention. The grounds for treatment and intensive effective reduction of dyslipidemias must be made through a better adherence to quality Health Programs and through improving treatment and achieved goals.",

Although lumen loss within the first 3 mm from each stent edge was primarily due to an increase in P&M area rather than a change in EEM area, and lumen loss beyond 3 mm from each stent edge was due to a combination of increased P&M area and decreased EEM area, no significant differences in changes were observed in P&M, EEM, and lumen area at every 1-mm subsegment between the simvastatin and non-statin group.",

We examined whether these variants are also associated with general statin intolerance in a large population of patients with type 2 diabetes receiving statins as part of routine clinical care. A total of 4,196 individuals were genotyped for rs4149056 (Val174Ala) and rs2306283 (Asp130Asn). Intolerance was defined by serum biochemistry and also by discontinuation, switching, or reduction in dose of the prescribed statin drug. Ala174 was associated with higher intolerance (odds ratio = 2.05, P = 0.043), whereas Asp130 was associated with lower intolerance (odds ratio = 0.71, P = 0.026). Ala174 was associated with a lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLc) response to statins (P = 0.01) whereas 130D was associated with a greater LDLc response to statins (P = 0.048), as previously reported; however, this association was no longer present when data for statin-intolerant individuals were removed from the analysis.

We previously demonstrated that hyperhomocysteinemia stimulated hepatic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase leading to hepatic lipid accumulation and liver injury. The liver plays an important role in cholesterol biosynthesis and overall homeostasis. HMG-CoA reductase catalyzes the rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis. Hepatic HMG-CoA reductase is a major target for lowering cholesterol levels in patients with hypercholesterolemia. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of berberine, a plant-derived alkaloid, on hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis in hyperhomocysteinemic rats and to identify the underlying mechanism. Hyperhomocysteinemia was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by feeding a high-methionine diet for 4 wk. HMG-CoA reductase activity was markedly elevated in the liver of hyperhomocysteinemic rats, which was accompanied by hepatic lipid accumulation. Activation of HMG-CoA reductase was caused by an increase in its gene expression and a reduction in its phosphorylation (an inactive form of the enzyme). Treatment of hyperhomocysteinemic rats with berberine for 5 days inhibited HMG-CoA reductase activity and reduced hepatic cholesterol content. Such an inhibitory effect was mediated by increased phosphorylation of HMG-CoA reductase. Berberine treatment also improved liver function. These results suggest that berberine regulates hepatic cholesterol biosynthesis via increased phosphorylation of HMG-CoA reductase. Berberine may be therapeutically useful for the management of cholesterol homeostasis.",

Before and after the treatments, the levels of plasma 8-iso-PGF2\u03b1 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and the plasma levels of SOD and MDA were detected by colorimetric method. LDL, HDL, TC, TG, and UA were also measured biochemically. RESULTS Compared with the control group, both of the treatment groups showed significantly increased levels of SOD and decreased MDA, 8-iso-PGF2\u03b1, UA and plasma lipids after the treatments (P<0.05). CONCLUSION In patients with coronary heart disease, simvastatins can decrease plasma lipids, inhibit lipid peroxidations, and promote the clearance of free radicals, thereby alleviating the oxidative stress.",

We evaluated the influence of prolonged pravastatin treatment on the survival of Leishmania amazonensis-infected animals (BALB/c, C57BL6 mice and Syrian hamsters), including weekly measurement of cutaneous lesions (footpad thickness) and weight. Pravastatin improved survival of Leishmania-infected BALB/c mice but not of infected C57BL6 mice or hamsters. On the 50th week of follow-up, 71% of pravastatin-treated Leishmania-infected BALB/c mice were alive against 29% of control group (p<0.01). Low footpad thickness was found on BALB/c pravastatin treated mice from the 14th week (p<0.05), and 20th week onward for C57BL6 treated mice. Pravastatin treatment decreased weight loss in Leishmania-infected C57BL6 mice and Syrian hamsters, but not infected BALB/c mice.

It is also unknown whether a JNK inhibitor could act in synergy with statins. We examined if the sequential combination of a JNK inhibitor and simvastatin would reduce islet inflammation and improve islet viability. We performed porcine islet isolation with or without intraductal administration of SP600125, a JNK inhibitor. This was followed by culture medium supplementation with either nicotinamide alone or nicotinamide plus simvastatin. We assessed the viability of islets by flow cytometry, islet loss during overnight culture, graft function in NOD/SCID mice, and expression of inflammation-related genes in islets. The sequential combination of a JNK inhibitor and simvastatin increased the \u03b2-cell viability index of porcine islets cultured overnight (p = 0.015) as well as islet viability as assessed by a DNA binding dye staining (p = 0.011). The combination of a JNK inhibitor and simvastatin significantly increased the islet survival rate (p = 0.027) when the histomorphometry of donor pancreas indicated a large islet proportion of greater than 50.55%. When we transplanted the same islet mass per recipient for each group, there was no difference in overall islet graft function. Intraductal administration of JNK inhibitor significantly suppressed mRNA expression levels of interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), interferon-\u03b3, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8, and macrophage chemoattractant protein-1. It also decreased the concentration of IL-1\u03b2 (p = 0.040) and IL-8 (p = 0.023) in the culture supernatant. In conclusion, the sequential combination of a JNK inhibitor and simvastatin protected porcine islets from peritransplant apoptosis.

It was the objective of this study to investigate the signal transduction pathways by which statins increase the expression of tissue-type PA (t-PA) and decrease PA inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) in human umbilical vein EC. Fluvastatin treatment increased t-PA expression more than 10-fold and reduced PAI-1 expression up to five-fold. This effect was mimicked by geranylgeranyl transferase inhibition. The role of geranylgeranylated small G-proteins of the Rho family was assessed by adenovirus-mediated expression of dominant negative (DN) RhoA, Cdc42 and Rac1 and by siRNA-mediated suppression of these proteins. DN-Cdc42 and DN-Rac1, as well as siRNA for Cdc42, increased t-PA expression, while DN-RhoA and DN-Rac1 decreased PAI-1 expression. Latrunculin B, an inhibitor of actin polymerisation, increased t-PA mRNA and reduced PAI-1 mRNA to the same extent as fluvastatin. Inhibition of p38, as well as p38\u03b1 or p38\u03b2 siRNA, reversed the effects of fluvastatin on t-PA expression. Treatment with p38\u03b2 siRNA partially reversed the effect of fluvastatin on PAI-1, whereas p38\u03b1 siRNA had no significant effect. Inhibition of jun kinase reduced basal and fluvastatin-induced t-PA expression to the same extent and increased PAI-1. MEK/ERK inhibition had no effect. In human EC, the fluvastatin-induced increase in t-PA is mediated by Cdc42 and, as with t-PA induced by inhibition of actin polymerisation, requires activation of p38MAP kinase. The mechanisms by which fluvastatin treatment reduces PAI-1 are different from those that increase t-PA.",

In vitro dissolution studies showed that the release of the drug from the new formulation followed a zero-order kinetic with no differences in the release profile with either the pH media or the agitation rate. The pharmacokinetic of lovastatin and its metabolite lovastatin acid was evaluated after the administration of the new formulation to Beagle dogs in fasted conditions and after a high-fat meal, and compared to the marketed formulation Altoprev\u00ae. After the administration of LOV-ER, extended plasma profiles of lovastatin and its active metabolite were achieved in both fasted conditions and after the high-fat meal. Plasma levels of lovastatin and lovastatin acid were always higher when the LOV-ER formulation was administered with the high-fat meal. A high variability in plasma levels and pharmacokinetic parameters was obtained, being this variability higher when the formulation was administered under fasting conditions. Our results suggest that there is an increase in lovastatin bioavailability when the formulation is administered after the high-fat meal. When we compare LOV-ER and Altoprev\u00ae, both administered after the high-fat meal, we found significant differences (p<0.05) in C(max) of lovastatin and in AUC(0-\u221e) and MRT of lovastatin acid. No differences were detected between both formulations in fasting conditions. In this regard, the high-fat meal seems to increase the absorption extent of lovastatin from LOV-ER formulation and to delay the absorption rate of the drug from Altoprev\u00ae.

Hence, supplementation with antioxidant compounds may offer some protection against diabetic complications. The pleiotropic effects of statins, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, represent an area of great interest in prevention and therapy of cardiovascular and neurological disorders. Using biomarkers of oxidative stress, in this study we examined the effect of non cholesterol lowering dose, long term fluvastatin treatment on oxidative stress in streptozotocin-diabetic rats. Experiments were conducted in 24 Wistar adult male rats. Diabetic and non-diabetic rats were treated orally for 6 months with fluvastatin (2mg/kg/day, p.o) starting one week after streptozotocin injection (55 mg/kg, i.p.), (preventive study). In brain, heart, liver, pancreas and kidney homogenates malondialdehyde, lipid hydroperoxide, protein carbonyl content, advanced oxidation protein products, 3-nitrotyrosine levels and superoxide dismutase, catalase activities were measured. Hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia in diabetic groups remained unchanged after fluvastatin treatment. The drug act as antioxidant in the tissues. Hence, antioxidant property of fluvastatin, independent of cholesterol lowering effect, may play a role in prevention of diabetic complications. Clinical relevance of this effect of fluvastatin seems worthy of further studies.", 
    "157": "Statins confer an antiplatelet effect in hypercholesterolemic subjects and in stable coronary artery disease patients. We explored the antiplatelet effects of statins in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients undergoing primary angioplasty. Of 120 STEMI patients, 80 (67%) received statins while 40 (33%) did not. Ex vivo platelet reactivity was studied on admission and 72 hours later by conventional aggregometry and under flow conditions (Impact R). Measures of platelet reactivity under flow conditions included aggregate size and surface coverage, signifying platelet aggregation and adhesion respectively. The effect of statins on platelet function under flow conditions and platelet aggregation was studied in?vitro in platelets from 10 STEMI patients. Platelets from each patient were incubated in?vitro with lovastatin or PBS as a control. The effect of lovastatin in the presence of a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (L-NMMA) was also studied. Patients treated with statins were compared with those who did not have significantly lower ADP-induced platelet aggregation on the 4th day (56 \u00b1 18% vs. 64 \u00b1 17%, p=0.02). Platelet deposition under flow conditions as measured by surface coverage was reduced from admission to 72 hours later among statin-treated patients (19 \u00b1 28% reduction, p<0.01), but was unchanged in non-treated patients (for comparison p<0.01). The extent of platelet inhibition was unrelated to patient characteristics, including lipid profile and type of statin administered (lipophylic vs. hydrophilic). In the in vitro study platelet incubation with statin compared with PBS resulted in a lower aggregate-size (29 \u00b1 9 \u03bcm(2) vs. 39 \u00b1 15 \u03bcm(2), p<0.01), and lower surface coverage (8.5 \u00b1 4% vs. 12 \u00b1 4%, p<0.01). The effect of the statin on both parameters was significantly blunted by L-NMMA. Incubation with statin also resulted in a reduction in collagen-induced platelet aggregation (31 \u00b1 20% vs. 54 \u00b1 25%, p<0.01). We concluded that in acute myocardial infarction patients, statins have an early antiplatelet effect, in addition to that afforded by standard antiplatelet therapy.",

We characterized phosphocreatine (PCr) exercise recovery kinetics in 10 patients with hypercholesterolemia before and after a 4-week regimen of statin therapy using 31-phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((31) P-MRS). (31) P spectra were obtained before, during, and after exercise on a calf flexion pedal ergometer. Creatine kinase (CK) serum levels were drawn before and after statin therapy. The mean metabolic recovery time constant in subjects increased from 28.1 s (SE = 6.5 s) to 55.4 s (SE = 7.4 s) after statin therapy. The unweighted mean of the pre/post-recovery time difference was -27.3 s (SE = 12.4 s; P = 0.02). Pre- and post-therapy CK levels were not significantly different (P = 0.50). Metabolic recovery time in the calf is prolonged in patients after statin use. This suggests that statins impair mitochondrial oxidative function, and (31) P MRS is a potential study model for statin-associated myopathy.",

Tight control of serum lipid parameters in these patients is recommended by the most recent clinical guidelines. Although numerous lipid-lowering treatments are available, only a small percentage of eligible patients receive therapy and fewer achieve their lipid-lowering goals. Thus it is clear that new treatment strategies to manage patients with lipid abnormalities are warranted. Pitavastatin (Lival; Kowa Pharmaceuticals America, Montgomery, AL, USA) has been recently approved for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and combined dyslipidemia. Pitavastatin 1-4 mg/day has shown similar low-density lipoprotein-reducing activity to other commercially available statins, including simvastatin and atorvastatin. Adverse events occurred at similar rates to other statins in clinical trials with favorable effects seen in patients with dyslipidemia and metabolic syndrome. Pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions are minimized due to the lack of significant metabolism of pitavastatin by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, although some drugs affect its uptake into hepatocytes and should be avoided. In addition to its higher acquisition cost, pitavastatin has not been shown to improve clinical outcomes in high-risk patient populations and thus may not be the agent of choice in many patients at this time in lieu of cheaper, clinically proven alternatives.",

    "166": "We report a case of colchicine-induced rhabdomyolysis in a heart/lung-transplanted man treated with cyclosporin. A treatment was to resolve an acute gouty arthritis and was started with 3 mg of colchicine the first day, then 2 mg the second and the third day, and finally 1 mg/d during 6 days. Eight days later, the patient developed multiple organ failure and rhabdomyolysis. The concentration of colchicine analyzed was greater than the standard 153 hours after his last intake. Pharmacokinetic interactions are responsible of this toxicity. Cyclosporin, pravastatin, and azithromycin are known to inhibit P-glycoprotein, which will enhance the intracellular colchicine level by acting in its bioavailability and moderating hepatic and renal excretion. Moreover, long-term treatment by cyclosporin generates chronic renal failure that will, in the same time, decrease colchicine elimination. Even short-term administration of therapeutic colchicine dose may cause colchicine-related toxicity, especially in the setting of a renal failure and/or polymedicinal treatment.",

We also analyzed the effect of nicorandil on atherosclerotic lesion formation in a mouse model of atherosclerosis. Lipid profiles were unaffected, but the area of atherosclerotic lesion and plaque necrosis were significantly reduced following 8-week nicorandil treatment in ApoE-deficient mice fed an atherogenic diet. Nicorandil significantly reduced the expression levels of endoplasmic reticulum stress markers, C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and glucose regulated protein/BiP (GRP78) in atherosclerotic lesions.

Increased levels of LDLR would lead to reduced cholesterol levels and contribute to strategies designed to treat hypercholesterolemia. We have previously shown that duplex RNAs complementary to transcription start sites can associate with noncoding transcripts and activate gene expression. Here we show that duplex RNAs complementary to the promoter of LDLR activate expression of LDLR and increase the display of LDLR on the surface of liver cells. Activation requires complementarity to the LDLR promoter and can be achieved by chemically modified duplex RNAs. Promoter-targeted duplex RNAs can overcome repression of LDLR expression by 25-hydroxycholesterol and do not interfere with activation of LDLR expression by lovastatin.

This study was designed to assess the effect of low-dose aspirin on CRP levels in controlled hypertensive patients who had low inflammatory burden. Two hundred twenty-five patients with controlled hypertension were randomly divided into two groups; aspirin group (n = 122, 100 mg of aspirin) and the control group (n = 134). Patients with a CRP level >1 mg/dL (10 mg/L) were excluded because these high levels suggest infection. C-reactive protein level and lipid profiles were measured before therapy and 3 months after therapy. There were no differences in baseline clinical characteristics between the two groups.

Beyond outstanding advances in catheter ablation procedures, antiarrhythmic drug therapy remains a corner-stone to restore and maintain sinus rhythm. However, potentially life-threatening hazards (proarrhythmia) and significant non-cardiac organ toxicity have made new drug development of prominent relevance. Multichannel blocking, atrial selectivity, and the reduction of the risk of adverse events have all constituted the main theme of modern antifibrillatory drug development. Dronedarone, an analog of amiodarone, has the unique characteristic of being the first antiarrhythmic drug demonstrated to reduce hospitalizations in AF. Dronedarone is associated with less systemic toxicity than amiodarone, although being less effective for sinus rhythm maintenance. Atrial selective agents have been developed to target ion channels expressed selectively in the atria. Among the most promising drugs of this class is vernakalant, which has been shown effective for the acute conversion of AF with small risk of proarrhythmia.

    "209": "All the screened patients had indications for statins. Among those, 60% of the patients had a history from 3 months to 2 years of suffering from stroke. However, up to 80% of the patients were not using statins when screened. Even in those with statins, about 1/4 of the patients took statins for much shorter period than the history of stroke. The proportion using statins among IS patients with CHD was 4 times more than in those without CHD. Simvastatin and Atorvastatin were most commonly used.", 
    "210": "Statins were greatly underused for secondary prevention among patients with atherosclerotic ischemic stroke in China. There was a large gap between evidence and practice. It remains a major challenge for healthcare professionals and policy makers to tackle this problem more positively.", 
    "211": "Inflammation has been implicated in cardiovascular disease, and the important role of proteasomes in the development of inflammation and other macrophage functions has been demonstrated. Tocotrienols are potent hypocholesterolemic agents that inhibit \u03b2-hydroxy-\u03b2-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activity, which is degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of tocotrienols in reducing inflammation. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used as a prototype for inflammation in murine RAW 264.7 cells and BALB/c female mice.", 
    "212": "The present results clearly demonstrate that \u03b1-, \u03b3-, or \u03b4-tocotrienol treatments inhibit the chymotrypsin-like activity of 20 S rabbit muscle proteasomes (> 50%; P < 0.05). Chymotrypsin, trypsin, and post-glutamase activities were decreased > 40% (P < 0.05) with low concentrations (< 80 \u03bcM), and then increased gradually with concentrations of (80--640 \u03bcM) in RAW 264.7 whole cells. Tocotrienols showed 9--33% (P < 0.05) inhibitions in TNF-\u03b1 secretion in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. Results of experiments carried out in BALB/c mice demonstrated that serum levels of TNF-\u03b1 after LPS treatment were also reduced (20--48%; P < 0.05) by tocotrienols with doses of 1 and 10 \u03bcg/kg, and a corresponding rise in serum levels of corticosterone (19--41%; P < 0.05) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (81--145%; P < 0.02) was observed at higher concentrations (40 \u03bcM). Maximal inhibition of LPS-induced TNF-\u03b1 was obtained with \u03b4-tocotrienol (10 \u03bcg/kg). Low concentrations of \u03b4-Tocotrienols (< 20 \u03bcM) blocked LPS-induced gene expression of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and iNOS (> 40%), while higher concentrations (40 \u03bcM) increased gene expression of the latter in peritoneal macrophages (prepared from BALB/c mice) as compared to control group.", 
    "213": "These results represent a novel approach by using natural products, such as tocotrienols as proteasome modulators, which may lead to the development of new dietary supplements of tocotrienols for cardiovascular diseases, as well as others that are based on inflammation.", 
    "214": "Statins induces cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, reduction of angiogenic factors, inhibition of the endothelial growth factor, impairing tissue adhesion and attenuation of the resistance mechanisms. The aim of this study was evaluate the anti-tumoral activity of simvastatin in a B16F10 melanoma-mouse model.", 
    "215": "Melanoma cells were treated with different concentrations of simvastatin and assessed by viability methods. Melanoma cells (5 \u00d7 10(4)) were implanted in two month old C57Bl6/J mice. Around 7 days after cells injection, the oral treatments were started with simvastatin (5 mg/kg/day, p.o.). Tumor size, hematological and biochemical analyses were evaluated.", 
    "216": "Simvastatin at a concentration of 0.8 \u03bcM, 1.2 \u03bcM and 1.6 \u03bcM had toxic effect. Concentration of 1.6 \u03bcM induced a massive death in the first 24 h of incubation. Simvastatin at 0.8 \u03bcM induces early cell cycle arrest in G0/G1, followed by increase of hypodiploidy. Tumor size were evaluated and the difference of treated group and control, after ten days, demonstrates that simvastatin inhibited the tumor expansion in 68%.", 
    "217": "Simvastatin at 1.6 \u03bcM, presented cytototoxicity after 72 h of treatment, with an intense death. In vivo, simvastatin being potentially useful as an antiproliferative drug, with an impairment of growth after ten days.", 
    "218": "THIS PAPER PRESENTS AN ANALYSIS OF THE RECENTLY PUBLISHED JUSTIFICATION FOR THE USE OF STATINS IN PREVENTION (JUPITER: an intervention trial evaluating rosuvastatin) trial, which tested the statin rosuvastatin in apparently healthy individuals with no prior cardiovascular (CVD) disease and with normal plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol concentrations but with raised plasma high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels. The rate of the combined primary CVD endpoint was significantly reduced in the treatment arm after a median of under 2 years. The JUPITER trial is distinct from previous studies examining statin use in primary prevention groups because the target group for drug therapy was apparently healthy men and women at low or intermediate risk for developing CVD. On the basis of JUPITER's findings, there are key questions that should be assessed on the therapeutic intervention of CVD regarding: the primary prevention groups that should be targeted for statin therapy, the utility of targets in addition to plasma LDL cholesterol levels, and the need to consider the metabolic state of individuals targeted for therapy (including the presence of obesity and inflammation). The conclusion from the current analysis is that the JUPITER results warrant further LDL cholesterol lowering than is currently targeted in primary prevention groups that have a pre-existing condition or lifestyle that elevates CVD risk but still do not have a high global CVD risk (as assessed with current algorithms). This group is not captured in current widely used CVD risk calculations, however, with the identification of useful biomarkers, such as hsCRP, this group can be better identified and targeted for intervention."
