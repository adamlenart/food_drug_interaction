Dendritic cells (DC) are professional APCs dependent on maturation to attain full T-cell priming capacity. The immunomodulatory properties of simvastatin influence the function of both T cells and APCs and could thus be a potential therapy for MS. The phenotype of myeloid DC in untreated patients with monosymptomatic optic neuritis (ON) was determined by flow cytometry and the impact of simvastatin on the function of myeloid DC derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was analysed in vitro. DC from ON patients had more mature phenotype compared with healthy controls (HC). Particularly the fraction of DC expressing CD1a and CD80 was significantly higher in ON than in HC (P<0.05). Addition of 10 muMu simvastatin significantly inhibited the maturation of DC in the ON group. Furthermore, ON derived DC induced stronger T-cell proliferation in the mixed leukocyte reaction (MLR), and simvastatin solely inhibited this proliferation of T-cells in the ON group and not in HC. In conclusion DC from ON patients have a more mature phenotype and an increased stimulatory capacity. Simvastatin has an inhibitory effect on the differentiation and maturation of DC, and selectively reduce the T-cell proliferation induced by DC from patients with ON. The results from these in vitro assays suggest potential beneficial inhibitory effects of Simvastatin in the inflammation in ON and early MS, but we need more clinical trials to confirm it.",

Authors investigated the effects of raft cholesterol depletion on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell migration. Incubation of NSCLC cells in media containing lovastatin resulted in inhibition of cell migration by 63.1-83.3%, whereas raft cholesterol depletion with successive treatment using methyl-beta cyclodextrin (MbetaCD) followed by lovastatin further suppressed their migration by 35.0-57.8%. Raft cholesterol depletion partially inhibited EGF-induced phosphorylation of EGFR and FAK, however, no change was observed in other molecules comprising focal adhesion complex. It resulted in disappearance of filopodia, inhibition of EGF-induced pY397 FAK aggregation, and its destabilization. Cholesterol depletion inhibited phosphorylation of Src on Y416 in the detergent-insoluble fraction followed by decreased localization of total and pY397 FAK in the detergent-insoluble fraction. Minimal changes in these molecules were observed in the detergent-soluble fraction and interactions between FAK and other molecules of the focal adhesion complex were not influenced. Immunocytochemical analysis confirmed translocation of Src from the raft into cytoplasm and disappearance of EGF-induced membrane ruffling by raft cholesterol depletion. In cholesterol-depleted cells, EGF-induced phosphorylation of Src, Akt, and p44/42 in the detergent-insoluble fraction were inhibited whereas phosphorylation of GSK-3beta was unaffected. We conclude that raft cholesterol depletion inhibited NSCLC migration through inhibition of phosphorylation of raft associated Src and dislocation of molecules comprising focal adhesion complexes from raft rather than by inhibiting their recruitment to Src and interaction.",

    "28": "HIV-1-infected brains are characterized by increased amyloid deposition. To study the influence of HIV-1 on amyloid beta (Abeta) homeostasis at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) level, we employed a model of brain microvascular endothelial cells exposed to HIV-1 in the presence or absence of Abeta. HIV-1 markedly increased endogenous Abeta levels and elevated accumulation of exogenous Abeta. Simvastatin, the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, blocked these effects. We next evaluated the effects of HIV-1 and/or simvastatin on expression of the receptor for lipoprotein related protein (LRP1) and the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), known to regulate Abeta transport across the BBB. LRP1 expression was not affected by HIV-1; however, it was increased by simvastatin. Importantly, simvastatin attenuated HIV-1-induced RAGE expression. These results suggest that HIV-1 may directly contribute to Abeta accumulation at the BBB level. In addition, statins may protect against increased Abeta levels associated with HIV-1 infection in the brain.",

The mechanisms underlying alpha-syn aggregation remain elusive though emerging science has hypothesized that the interaction between cholesterol and alpha-syn may play a role. Cholesterol has been linked to alpha-synucleinopathies by recent work suggesting cholesterol metabolites appear to accelerate alpha-syn fibrillization. Consistent with these findings, cholesterol-lowering agents have been demonstrated to reduce alpha-syn accumulation and the associated neuronal pathology in vitro. In this context, this study sought to investigate the in vivo effects of the cholesterol synthesis inhibitor lovastatin on alpha-syn aggregation in two different transgenic (Tg) mouse models that neuronally overexpress human alpha-syn. Lovastatin-treated mice displayed significantly reduced plasma cholesterol levels and levels of oxidized cholesterol metabolites in the brain in comparison to saline-treated controls. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated a significant reduction of neuronal alpha-syn aggregates and alpha-syn immunoreactive neuropil in the temporal cortex of lovastatin-treated Tg mice in comparison to saline-treated alpha-syn Tg controls. Consistently, immunoblot analysis of mouse brain homogenates showed a reduction in levels of total and oxidized alpha-syn in lovastatin-treated alpha-syn Tg mice in comparison to saline-treated alpha-syn Tg controls. The reduced alpha-syn accumulation in lovastatin-treated mice was associated with abrogation of neuronal pathology. The results from this study demonstrate that lovastatin administration can reduce alpha-syn aggregation and associated neuropathology and support the possibility that treatment with cholesterol-lowering agents may be beneficial for patients with PD and/or DLB.",

The event reduction was maximal in patients whose LDL cholesterol and hsCRP levels were lowered to < 70 mg/dl and <2 mg/I, respectively. The publication of the JUPITER data resulted in a wide debate within the international scientific community, particularly related to clinical implications of major findings. The main implications seem to be the confirmation of \"the lower is better\" philosophy and of the role of hsCRP as a marker to select, among intermediate risk subjects, patients who are actually at higher risk, who need to be treated with highly effective statins with a low side-effect profile, such as rosuvastatin. Patients with the \"JUPITER phenotype\" (metabolic syndrome + family history of cardiovascular disease) seem to benefit the most from a treatment that includes measurement of hsCRP and rosuvastatin administration.",

A tight correlation between LDL cholesterol and occurrence of major cardiovascular events has been observed. Moreover, favorable effects have been shown also in subjects with normal cholesterol blood levels and high levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), a predictive marker of cardiovascular events. In two studies involving patients with acute coronary artery disease the prognosis was better in subjects with cholesterol levels < 70 mg/dl or hsCRP < 2 mg/I. These studies provide the background for the JUPITER trial, a double-blind randomized controlled \"globalized\" study with rosuvastatin 20 mg in primary prevention, including 17 802 normal cholesterolemic males and females with increased risk for hsCRP > 2 mg/I. The combined primary endpoint included myocardial infarction, stroke, arterial revascularization, hospitalization for unstable angina, or death from cardiovascular causes. Rosuvastatin reduced LDL cholesterol levels by 50% and hsCRP levels by 37%. The trial was stopped after a median follow-up period of 1.9 years, due to a significant superiority of rosuvastatin on the incidence of major cardiovascular events. Moreover, long-term adherence to randomized treatment was excellent, and safety was consistent in the two groups. Eligible patients were more than one fourth of the outpatients attending a cardiology clinic; median age of 66 is 5-6 years lower than age of patients admitted to Italian intensive cardiac care units for acute coronary disease, suggesting the usefulness of a primary prevention program with rosuvastatin in this clinical setting.

Moreover, hsCRP predicts risk of recurrent coronary events and has important prognostic value in acute coronary ischemia and after coronary interventions. The JUPITER study was aimed to determine whether long-term treatment with rosuvastatin (20 mg/die) will reduce the rate of major adverse cardiovascular events, defined as the combined endpoint of cardiovascular death, stroke, myocardial infarction, hospitalization for unstable angina, or arterial revascularization among individuals with LDL cholesterol levels < 130 mg/dl (3.36 mmol/I) who are at high risk because of an enhanced inflammatory response as indicated by hsCRP levels > 2 mg/I.",

The efficacy of statin therapy has been well documented both in primary and secondary prevention, in patients with subclinical atherosclerosis and in those with average cholesterol levels. However, the so-called \"residual risk\" remains significant and new strategies are needed for reducing it, such as raising HDL-cholesterol levels. Recently, the JUPITER study demonstrated the efficacy of statins in reducing the risk in healthy subjects with elevated C-reactive protein levels, highlighting the potential protective mechanisms of these drugs. Different from the setting of primary and secondary prevention, the results of statin trials in patients with heart failure, end-stage renal disease and aortic stenosis have shown no benefit in terms of survival.", 
    "41": "Atherosclerosis is a chronic disease potentially involving the whole arterial system that causes a spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from acute myocardial infarction to stable angina or stroke. The continuous accumulation of lipids, fibrous and inflammatory elements in the arterial wall leads to progressive lumen narrowing with subsequent ischemia. Acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction) have a more complex and dynamic pathogenesis with coronary plaque rupture and thrombosis as the final common pathway. As only some plaques lead to clinical events whereas many others remain asymptomatic life-long, different imaging modalities have been applied to define the atherosclerotic burden and/or the anatomical characteristics of unstable or vulnerable lesions. Carotid ultrasound, multislice computed tomography (MSCT) or nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) have been applied to assess the atherosclerotic burden in asymptomatic subjects, while coronary angiography has been mainly used to assess unstable plaques at the time of coronary events. Today intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) offers qualitative details on plaque composition, like hard and soft components, that are helpful to assess unstable lesions, but other important details (lipid pool areas or fibrous cap thickness, ulcerations, thrombotic apposition or erosion) are either below the resolution of IVUS or not easily visualized. In the last years novel techniques have been developed to overcome these limitations. Optical coherence tomography and the combination of anatomical and biological imaging using hybrid techniques (like virtual histology or the combination of positron emission tomography and MSCT or NMR) appear to be particularly attractive. These approaches will likely provide new insights into the pathophysiology of acute coronary events and into the effects of aggressive preventive therapies.",

    "43": "Calcific aortic stenosis and atherosclerosis have been investigated separately in experimental in vitro and in vivo studies and in clinical studies. The similarities identified in both diseases suggest that similar pathogenic pathways are involved in both conditions. Most current therapeutic studies are focused on statins. The evidence suggests that statin effects on valves may, in large part, be independent of the lipid lowering effects of the drug. There are several molecules that play significant regulatory roles on the development and progression of valve sclerosis and calcification and on growth and complications of atherosclerotic plaques. The purpose of this review is to discuss the pathogenic features of the two conditions, highlight the important similarities, and then review the data that suggest that transforming growth factor-beta may play a key regulatory role in both diseases and that this is worthy of study as a potential therapeutic target for both conditions.", 
    "44": "Until recently, most envisaged atherosclerosis as a bland arterial collection of cholesterol, complicated by smooth muscle cell accumulation. According to that concept, endothelial denuding injury led to platelet aggregation and release of platelet factors which would trigger the proliferation of smooth muscle cells in the arterial intima. These cells would then elaborate an extracellular matrix that would entrap lipoproteins, forming the nidus of the atherosclerotic plaque. Beyond the vascular smooth muscle cells long recognized in atherosclerotic lesions, subsequent investigations identified immune cells and mediators at work in atheromata, implicating inflammation in this disease. Multiple independent pathways of evidence now pinpoint inflammation as a key regulatory process that links multiple risk factors for atherosclerosis and its complications with altered arterial biology. Knowledge has burgeoned regarding the operation of both innate and adaptive arms of immunity in atherogenesis, their interplay, and the balance of stimulatory and inhibitory pathways that regulate their participation in atheroma formation and complication. This revolution in our thinking about the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis has now begun to provide clinical insight and practical tools that may aid patient management. This review provides an update of the role of inflammation in atherogenesis and highlights how translation of these advances in basic science promises to change clinical practice.",

Primary care physicians (PCP) often manage patients with CKD in the early stages of the disease and have a pivotal role in affecting long-term outcomes in CKD patients related to cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Therefore, treatment of dyslipidemia often becomes the responsibility of the PCP and comes with its own set of challenges because of CKD-related issues (eg, the dose adjustments required). Exacerbating this problem is the fact that current guidelines are lengthy and complex. This article discusses the current guidelines for treating dyslipidemia in patients with CKD. Few studies have examined the safety and efficacy of pharmacotherapy for treatment of dyslipidemia in the CKD population, and ongoing studies such as the Study of Heart and Renal Protection (SHARP) should help clarify the current treatment guidelines.",

In an in vitro model of differentiated, primary human skeletal muscle myoblast cells, we demonstrate basal membrane expression and drug efflux activity of MRP1, which contributes to reducing intracellular statin accumulation.

    "52": "The cardiovascular benefits of statins, including atorvastatin (ATV), have been reported to be gender-dependent, but the underlying mechanism is unclear. In this study we examine whether estrogen and its metabolite, 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME), affect the rounding response of human vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) induced by ATV. Twenty-four hour treatment with ATV (10-100 microM) induced rounding of cultured human SMCs. Addition of 2ME (1-20 microM), but not 17beta-estradiol, for 2 h induced re-spreading of rounded cells. Our further studies showed that the effects of 2ME were mimicked by microtubule-disrupting drugs and inhibited by taxol. Inhibition of RhoA and ROCK (Rho-kinase) by C3-toxin and H-1152, respectively, blocked 2ME effects. 2ME effects were also blocked by treatment with either actin-interfering drugs, such as cytochalasin D and jasplakinolide, or myosin inhibitor blebbistatin. ML-7 and -9, the inhibitors for myosin light chain kinase, inhibited 2ME effect as well. ATV treatment induced a decrease of F-actin content and Thr18/Ser19 dual phosphorylation of myosin regulatory light chain (MRLC), which was rescued by 2ME or mevalonate. The rescue effects of 2ME on F-actin content and MRLC dual phosphorylation were abolished by taxol or H-1152. In addition, kinesin Eg5 inhibitor monastrol and dynein inhibitor erythro-9-3-(2-hydroxynonyl) adenine (EHNA) significantly blocked 2ME effects. Finally, our results revealed that 2ME inhibited the migration of SMCs induced by ATV (0.1 microM) in wound healing assay and Boyden chamber assay. In summary, our data show that 2ME, but not estrogen, inhibits ATV-induced rounding of human SMCs through induction of microtubule disassembly and activation of the Rho-ROCK-actinomyosin pathway.", 
    "53": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an increasingly common arrhythmia that now stands at epidemic proportion, with more than 2.3 million people affected in the USA and over 4.5 million people affected in Western Europe. AF is an expression of underlying heart disease and is increasingly associated with hypertension, congestive heart failure, and ischemic heart disease. It is also a progressive disease secondary to continuous structural remodeling of the atria, which relates to AF itself, to changes associated with aging and to progression of the underlying heart disease. Traditionally, AF has been addressed only after it has already presented with pharmacological and nonpharmacological therapies designed for rhythm or rate control (secondary prevention). Although secondary prevention is the most feasible approach at present, the concept of primary prevention of AF with therapies aimed at preventing the development of substrate and correcting the risk factors for AF has emerged as a strategy, which is likely to produce a larger effect in the general population. Recent experiments provided new insights into AF pathophysiology, which generated background for new mechanism-based therapies. Agents targeting inflammation, oxidative injury, atrial myocyte metabolism, extracellular matrix remodeling, and fibrosis have theoretical advantages as novel therapeutic strategies. In this respect, drugs that are not traditionally antiarrhythmic such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor blockers, aldosterone antagonists, statins, and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have shown an antiarrhythmic potential in addition to any treatment effect on the underlying disease. These agents are thought to have an advantage of targeting both the occurrence and progression of the substrate for AF, thus, providing primary and secondary prevention of the arrhythmia. Although first experimental and hypothesis-generating small clinical studies or retrospective analyses have been encouraging, several larger, properly designed, prospective trials have not confirmed earlier observations. This review provides a contemporary evidence-based insight into the possible preventative and reverse remodeling role of statins and polyunsaturated fatty acids in AF.",

We hypothesized that Atorvastatin treatment alters apoptosis protein expression and activation in AAAs. Protein was isolated from the central and distal portions of end-stage human AAA tissue obtained during surgical repair from non-statin (NST) and Atorvastatin-treated (AT) patients. Expression was compared using immunoblots. Bcl-2 expression was unchanged but Bak (4-fold, p < 0.013) and Bax (3-fold, p < 0.035) expression was increased in AT (n = 12) versus NST (n = 15) patients. No cytochrome c release or caspase 3 activation was detected and Clusterin, GRP78, and BNIP1 expression was similar in NST and AT samples. Bcl-2 and Bax cDNA sequences from AAA tissue (n = 10) and the general population were identical. Thus, the increase in Bax and Bak in AT-treated AAAs did not activate the mitochondria or endoplasmic reticulum mediated apoptosis pathways. Bcl-2, Bax, and Bak have non-apoptosis related functions that include maintenance of endoplasmic reticulum (ER), homeostasis, and adaptation to stress. We speculate that Atorvastatin-mediated increases in Bax and Bak may positively affect their non-apoptosis related cell functions to account for the beneficial effect of statins to slow AAA expansion.",

Its risk is inversely correlated with plasma high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, and approximately 50% of the variability in these levels is genetically determined. In this study, the aim was to carry out a whole-genome scan for the loci regulating plasma HDL-C levels in 35 well-defined Finnish extended pedigrees (375 members genotyped) with probands having low HDL-C levels and premature CHD. The additive genetic heritability of HDL-C was 43%. A variance component analysis revealed four suggestive quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for HDL-C levels, with the highest LOD score, 3.1, at the chromosomal locus 4p12. Other suggestive LOD scores were 2.1 at 2q33, 2.1 at 6p24 and 2.0 at 17q25. Three suggestive loci for the qualitative low HDL-C trait were found, with a nonparametric multipoint score of 2.6 at the chromosomal locus 10p15.3, 2.5 at 22q11 and 2.1 at 6p12. After correction for statin use, the strongest evidence of linkage was shown on chromosomes 4p12, 6p24, 6p12, 15q22 and 22q11. To search for the underlying gene on chromosome 6, we analyzed two functional and positional candidate genes (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-delta (PPARD), and retinoid X receptor beta, (RXRB)), but found no significant evidence of association. In conclusion, we identified seven chromosomal regions for HDL-C regulation exceeding the level for suggestive evidence of linkage.", 
    "60": "Most Health Services are not capable of offering expedited investigation and treatment to the majority of patients presenting with transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or minor stroke. The reasons for this are multifactorial. However, there is now compelling evidence that the risk of stroke after TIA/minor stroke is significantly higher than was previously thought, with one recent study suggesting the stroke risk might be as high as 17% at 72 hours in patients with a clinically significant carotid stenosis. There is also good evidence that TIA services offering 'walk in' access with single visit imaging, combined with antiplatelet, antihypertensive and statin therapy starting during the initial consultation, significantly reduce the early risk of stroke. For many years, stroke has been the 'poor relation' to cancer and heart disease in terms of political and fiscal priorities. Given the plethora of evidence now available to us, it is no longer acceptable to tolerate delays to treatment and, in particular, continued acceptance of the dogma that provided patients undergo carotid revascularisation within 6 months, the patient is receiving optimal care. This philosophy should now be considered obsolete. The only thing that benefits from undue delay to treatment (in order to minimise the procedural risk) is the surgeon/interventionist's ego. It is certainly not the patient.",

Although patients with underlying cardiopulmonary disease remain at risk, most complications have occurred among previously healthy individuals, with obesity and respiratory disease as the strongest risk factors. Pulmonary complications are common. Primary influenza pneumonia occurs most commonly in adults and may progress rapidly to acute lung injury requiring mechanical ventilation. Secondary bacterial infection is more common in children. Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant strains, is an important cause of secondary bacterial pneumonia with a high mortality rate. Treatment of pneumonia should include empirical coverage for this pathogen. Neuromuscular and cardiac complications are unusual but may occur.",

We previously reported that the Fas-death receptor may induce apoptosis of the liver sinusoid endothelial cells (LSEC), and that TNF-alpha increases the susceptibility of these cells to suffer Fas-mediated apoptosis. Based on this evidence, in this study, we investigated the effect of simvastatin on Fas-mediated LSEC apoptosis. Simvastatin induced a significant reduction in LSEC viability, in a dose dependent manner, under serum-containing or serum-free conditions. This effect was prevented by mevalonate and GGPP, indicating the role of hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase. The simvastatin effect on LSEC death was not associated with increased activation of caspase-3. We found that simvastatin increased the susceptibility of LSEC death mediated by Fas. Further, simvastatin increased LSEC-apoptosis induced by Fas and TNF-alpha. Mevalonate and GGPP partially prevented simvastatin-induced sensitization to LSEC death mediated by Jo2 and TNF-alpha, but not Jo2 alone. Simvastatin did not induce up-regulation of the Fas on the LSEC. Our results provide evidence of simvastatin in modulating Fas-mediated apoptosis in endothelial cells.

JUPITER showed that rosuvastatin reduced the incidence of cardiac events compared to a control group. The study population (median age 66 years) included men and women with the metabolic syndrome (about 41%), median blood pressures in the prehypertensive range, current smoking (about 15%), median body mass indexes higher than normal, and Framingham 10-year risk >10% (about 50%). The presence of these risk factors indicates that a significant proportion of subjects were not \"healthy\" and warranted aggressive management under current guidelines, without the measurement of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Furthermore, <17% of the trial participants were taking guidelines-recommended aspirin, and 25% had systolic blood pressures >145 mm Hg and would have merited treatment for hypertension. It is likely that many of the participants did not receive care consistent with current standards. Thus, the benefit of statin therapy would have been more difficult to demonstrate if standard therapeutic recommendations had been followed. In conclusion, these considerations cast doubt on the contention that statin therapy should be initiated in apparently healthy individuals on the basis of elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels.",

This analysis combined individual patient data from 445 subjects who participated in 3 double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trials (FATS, HATS, and AFREGS) comparing intensive lipid therapy to placebos on coronary stenosis progression by quantitative coronary angiography and on major CV events. The primary end points were change in mean proximal coronary diameter stenosis (Delta%S(prox)) over 3 years and the frequency of the predefined composite of coronary artery disease death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and revascularization due to worsening ischemia. Patients with MS had 50% more rapid coronary stenosis progression and 64% increased CV event frequency compared to those without. More rapid coronary stenosis progression was significantly and independently associated with a 3.5-fold increased event risk (p <0.001). Combination lipid therapy significantly decreased stenosis progression by 83% (Delta%S(prox) 0.5 vs 2.9, p <0.001) in patients with MS and induced a small net regression in those without (Delta%S(prox) -0.3 vs 2.0, p <0.001). Combination therapy decreased the event rate by 54% (13% vs 28%, p = 0.03) in those with MS and by 82% (3% vs 17%, p = 0.002) without. On average, each 10% decrease in LDL cholesterol or 10% increase in HDL cholesterol was significantly associated with a 0.3 Delta%S(prox) decrease. Each 10% decrease in LDL cholesterol or 10% increase in HDL cholesterol was associated with 11% (p = 0.02) or 22% (p <0.001) event risk decrease. In conclusion, patients with MS have significantly more rapid coronary stenosis progression and a higher frequency of CV events. Greater stenosis progression rate is associated with a higher event rate. LDL cholesterol-lowering and HDL cholesterol-increasing therapies independently and significantly decrease coronary stenosis progression and decrease CV events.",

NAFLD is the most common liver disorder in affluent societies. There is no proven treatment for NAFLD/NASH. One of the most frequent adverse effects of statins is an increase in hepatic aminotransferases. Studies that evaluate if the benefits of statins overcome the risks in NASH are lacking. The present study was conceived to explore the effect of both atorvastatin and diet on regression of steatohepatitis, using a chicken experimental model induced by a hyperlipidemic diet (HD). Plasma lipid levels, liver enzymes and hepatic histopathology, as well as image analysis were performed to determine changes in liver lipid deposits and inflammatory infiltration. Features of steatosis, cell-ballooning, and inflammation were scored to obtain the NAFLD activity score (NAS). A severe level of steatosis was found in animals fed on HD. Atorvastatin treated groups showed smaller size of lipid deposits and a lower level of inflammation than non-treated groups. Atorvastatin therapy induced a significant reduction of hepatocellular damage, even though in the animals which continuously received a hyperlipidemic diet. The combination of atorvastatin therapy and a standard diet produced the lowest decrease of NAS.

Daily oral administration of atorvastatin produced a significant reduction in joint inflammation (21% in A10 and 33% in A50) and associated hyperalgesia. Atorvastatin also produced a marked improvement in the stair climbing ability and motility of the arthritic rats. The beneficial effect of atorvastatin was also evident from the histological analysis of joint carried out on day 28.

    "89": "We tested whether rosuvastatin (RST) protected against excitotoxic neuronal cell death in rat primary cortical neuronal cultures. L-glutamate (200 microM, 1h) reduced neuronal viability (% of naive controls, mean+/-SEM, n=8-32, *p<0.05) from 100+/-2% to 60+/-1%*, but pretreatment with RST (0.5 microM, 3 days) increased survival to 88+/-2%*. RST-induced neuroprotection was not affected by co-application with mevalonate (10 microM), although the same dose of mevalonate fully prevented the neurotoxic effects of a high dose (20 microM) of RST. RST (0.5 microM) pretreatment did not affect mitochondrial membrane potential or superoxide anion levels in quiescent neurons. However, RST pretreatment blunted elevations in free intracellular Ca(2+) and reduced increases in superoxide anion levels following glutamate exposure. Manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD), copper-zinc SOD, catalase, and reduced glutathione levels were unaffected by RST pretreatment. In contrast, acute, one time RST application did not affect either baseline or L-glutamate-induced increases in superoxide levels. In summary, three-day RST pretreatment induces resistance to the excitotoxic effect of L-glutamate in cultured neurons apparently by a mechanism that is independent of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibition. The delayed neuroprotection by RST against excitotoxicity does not involve sustained mitochondrial depolarization or superoxide anion production as initiating events, although it is associated with reduced Ca(2+) influx and superoxide anion production upon L-glutamate challenge.", 
    "90": "Although much progress has been made in the clinical care of patients with acute spinal cord injuries, there are no reliably effective treatments, which minimize secondary damage and improve neurologic outcome. The time and expense needed to establish de novo pharmacologic or biologic therapies for acute SCI has encouraged the development of neuroprotective treatments based on drugs that are already in clinical use and, therefore, have the advantage of a well-characterized safety and pharmacokinetic profile in humans. Statins are the most commonly prescribed class of lipid-lowering drugs, and recently, it has been recognized that statins also have powerful immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. This paper describes a series of experiments that were performed to evaluate the comparative neuroprotective effects of simvastatin and atorvastatin. We observed a promising signal of neurologic benefit with simvastatin in our first experiment, but in repeated attempts to replicate that effect in three subsequent experiments, we failed to reveal any behavioral or histologic improvements. We would conclude that simvastatin given orally or subcutaneously at doses previously reported by other investigators to be effective in different neurologic conditions does not confer a significant neurologic benefit in a thoracic contusion injury model (OSU Impactor) when administered with a 1-h delay in intervention. We contend that further preclinical investigation of atorvastatin and simvastatin is warranted before considering their translation into human SCI.", 
    "91": "Contrary to the long-standing and widely accepted belief that polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) are of marginal relevance in atherosclerosis, evidence revealing a previously unappreciated role of PMN in the process of atherosclerosis is being accumulating. Systemic inflammation involving activated PMN is clearly associated with unstable conditions of coronary artery disease and an increased number of circulating neutrophils is a well-known risk indicator of future cardiovascular outcomes. Furthermore, PMN are activated in a number of clinical conditions associated with high risk of developing atherosclerosis and are detectable into culprit lesions of patients with coronary artery disease. At present, pharmacological interventions aimed at blocking neutrophil emigration from the blood into the arterial wall and/or inhibiting neutrophil-mediated inflammatory functions are not an option for treating atherosclerosis. Nevertheless, several lines of evidence suggest that part of the atheroprotective effects of statins as well as HDL and HDL apolipoproteins may be related to their ability to modulate neutrophilic inflammation in the arterial wall. These hypotheses are not definitely established and warrant for further study. This Review describes the evidence suggesting that PMN may have a causative role in atherogenesis and atheroprogression and discusses the potential importance of modulating neutrophilic inflammation as part of a novel, improved strategy for preventing and treating atherosclerosis.", 
    "92": "1. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR) inhibitors, or statins, are commonly used to lower plasma cholesterol levels. HMGCR and the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR) are of central importance to cholesterol homeostasis and yet there is a paucity of data on the effect of statins on the regulation of the LDLR and HMGCR in humans. 2. In the present study, we examined the effect of atorvastatin on the expression of HMGCR, LDLR and LDLR-related protein (LRP) mRNA in circulating mononuclear cells. Twelve human volunteers were treated with atorvastatin, 20 mg/day for 4 weeks. 3. Atorvastatin decreased plasma total and LDL-cholesterol by 29% (P < 0.0001) and 41% (P < 0.001), respectively, and increased LDLR mRNA abundance, in absolute terms, by 35% (P < 0.001) and 31% (P < 0.0001) and 37% (P = 0.01) relative to reference GAPDH and beta-actin mRNA, respectively. In contrast, atorvastatin had no significant effect on LRP or HMGCR mRNA levels. 4. The increase in LDLR mRNA in circulating mononuclear cells agrees with the few human studies conducted, as well as with in vitro and animal studies, whereas the unchanged HMGCR mRNA is consistent with the hepatic specificity of atorvastatin. The present study firmly documents an increase in LDLR mRNA levels in response to statin administration in normal humans.", 
    "93": "1. There is considerable evidence regarding the efficacy of statins for the primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease (CAD). However, due to lack of sufficient evidence, there is still doubt whether high-dose statin therapy prior to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is beneficial. In the present study, we performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of preoperative high-dose statin therapy on the incidence of major adverse cardiac events (MACE) after successful PCI. 2. Trials were retrieved through Medline (1980-2009) and the reference files limited to English-language articles. Data were abstracted using a standardized protocol and a meta-analysis was performed. 3. Five studies of a total 1789 patients with CAD qualified for analysis. Administration of high-dose statins in CAD patients before PCI was associated with a significant reduction in MACE 30 days after the procedure. The incidence of MACE in the high-dose statin group (6.98%) was significantly lower than that in the placebo group (14.77%), with an odds ratio (OR) of 0.43 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31-0.59; P < 0.00001). The incidence of post-PCI increases in creatine kinase MB in the high-dose statin and placebo groups was 9.20%vs 18.83%, respectively (OR 0.43; 95% CI 0.33-0.58; P < 0.00001), whereas the incidence of increases in troponin I was 30.13%vs 44.53%, respectively (OR 0.53; 95% CI 0.43-0.67; P < 0.00001), respectively. 4. In conclusion, high-dose statin therapy before PCI provides a significant benefit over placebo in preventing post-PCI MACE. Findings from the present analysis strongly support a strategy of routine loading of high-dose statins before interventional therapy.", 
    "94": "Myopathy is a known side effect of statins, but neurotoxicity is not. Two studies reported that statins and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) appear together more than expected amongst adverse events in overlapping surveillance databases. A pooled analysis of clinical trials, many with short follow-up, showed no higher rate of ALS in the statins arms. In older age groups, statin use increased from approximately 5% in 1991 to approximately 40% in 1998 and then remained constant. There was no similar increase in ALS incidence. The initial signals of a strong association from drug surveillance systems should now be discounted, but not disregarded.",

Among these subgroups the vast majority of non-treated patients was eligible for statin treatment (LDL-C >2.5 mmol/l). The proportion of statin-treated patients was larger among diabetics than among CVD patients. Among CVD patients, female gender, age below 40 years, living in a deprived area, a history of CVD of less than 1 year and arrhythmia were significantly associated with non-treatment. Among diabetics, significant associations were: living in a deprived area and specialist visits in the previous year. In 2003, treatment rates among diabetics were lower, but among CVD patients they were similar.

However, for these conditions, the level of evidence was inadequate to recommend statin use. The evidence for improving outcomes in atrial fibrillation, mortality in heart failure, contrast-induced nephropathy, cataract, age-related macular degeneration, sub-arachnoid hemorrhage, osteoporosis, dementia, and cancer incidence was conflicting and inconclusive. Furthermore, we found that most of the literature consists of small observational studies and their conclusions are often not corroborated by results from larger or randomized studies.

In both MCD4 cells and rat kidney, AQP2 preferentially associated with Lubrol WX-insoluble membranes regardless of its presence in the storage compartment or at the apical membrane. Block-and-release experiments indicate that 1) AQP2 associates with detergent-resistant membranes early in the biosynthetic pathway; 2) strong cholesterol depletion delays the exit of AQP2 from the trans-Golgi network. Interestingly, mild cholesterol depletion promoted a dramatic accumulation of AQP2 at the apical plasma membrane in MCD4 cells in the absence of forskolin stimulation.

Compared with controls, post-PCI statin therapy was associated with a significantly decreased risk of repeat revascularization (risk ratio (RR)=0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.55-0.98, p=0.04), nonsignificantly decreased risks of all-cause mortality (RR=0.88, 95% CI, 0.35-2.21, p=0.79), MI (RR=0.76, 95% CI, 0.49-1.18, p=0.23), and target lesion or target vessel revascularization (RR=0.58, 95% CI, 0.24-1.39, p=0.22). In conclusion, statin therapy after PCI can reduce the risk of repeat revascularization. Further investigation is needed to identify the underlying mechanism(s).", 
    "144": "We aimed to study whether atorvastatin treatment can retard motor neuron degeneration in wobbler mice. Wobbler mice and their normal littermates were fed 0.01% atorvastatin-mixed food (10 mg/kg/day) or regular food from age 3-4 weeks of disease onset for four weeks (n=10/group) or more than eight weeks (n=10/group). Motor function was evaluated by pull-strength and deformity scale of the forelimbs. For those symptomatic assessment and body weight were measured weekly. Neuropathological and biochemical changes of the biceps muscle and the cervical cord were analyzed at four weeks after treatment. Compared to vehicle, atorvastatin-treated wobbler mice delayed progression of forelimb motor deficits by more than four weeks. Wobbler mice significantly increased body weight from three weeks post-treatment of atorvastatin, compared with vehicle (p<0.05). Atorvastatin administration suppressed denervation atrophy at 30% (p<0.01), maintained choline acetyl transferase activities of the biceps muscle (p<0.05), and attenuated approximately 30% loss of motor neurons in wobbler mice (p<0.01). Atorvastatin fed to normal littermates did not influence body weight gain, neuropathological and biochemical findings. These data suggest that atorvastatin has neuroprotective effects on denervating muscles and degenerating motor neurons in wobbler mice.", 
    "145": "Recurrent fetal loss affects 1-5% of women of childbearing age. Immunological mechanisms may account for 40% of recurrent miscarriages, and in particular, the antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) appears to be implicated in 7-25% of the cases. Because antiphospholipid (aPL) antibodies have thrombogenic properties, fetal loss in patients with APS has been ascribed to thrombosis of placental vessels. However, we have shown that inflammation, specifically activation of complement with generation of the anaphylotoxin C5a, is an essential trigger of fetal injury. Thrombosis and inflammation are linked in many clinical conditions. Tissue factor (TF), the major cellular initiator of the coagulation protease cascade, plays important roles in both thrombosis and inflammation, and its expression is increased in patients with APS. Here we describe how TF, acting as a proinflammatory molecule, induces trophoblast injury and fetal death in a mouse model of APS. Importantly, we will discuss how TF contributes to C5a-induced oxidative burst in neutrophils leading to trophoblasts and fetal injury in APS. The finding that TF is an important effector in aPL-induced inflammation may allow the development of new therapies to abrogate the inflammatory loop caused by tissue factor and improve pregnancy outcomes in patients with aPL antibodies. Statins downregulate TF-induced inflammation and rescued the pregnancies in aPL-treated mice, suggesting they may be a good treatment for women with aPL-induced pregnancy complications.",

    "147": "Without language restriction, we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register, references of review articles, proceedings of the International Stroke Conference, and gray literature sources. Studies were selected if they compared outcomes between statin-treated and untreated patients during the 2 weeks following SAH. Data were extracted and appraised independently and in duplicate, using standardized forms. Fixed or random effects models, as appropriate based on the degree of study heterogeneity, were applied to calculate summary measures.", 
    "148": "Four RCTs, two \"pseudo\" RCTs, five cohort studies, and one case-control study met eligibility criteria. In the RCTs, which enrolled a total of 309 patients, statins were found to significantly reduce the occurrence of DINDs [OR 0.38 (0.23-0.65); P < 0.001], but not mortality [OR 0.51 (0.25-1.02); P = 0.06] or poor neurological recovery [OR 0.81 (0.49-1.32); P = 0.39]. Observational studies assessed 1,542 patients, of whom 385 received statins. Statin-use was not associated with any reduction in DINDs [OR 0.96 (0.71-1.31); P = 0.80], mortality [OR 1.16 (0.78-1.73); P = 0.47] or poor neurological recovery [OR 1.20 (0.84-1.72); P = 0.31]. When the results of all studies were combined, statins had no statistically significant effect.",

We report on the impact of statin treatment at entry on the CV and all-cause mortality. The multicenter CLARICOR trial randomized patients to oral clarithromycin (500 mg daily; n = 2172) versus matching placebo (daily; n = 2201) for 2 weeks. Patients were followed through public databases. In the 41% patients on statin treatment at entry, no significant effect of clarithromycin was observed on CV (hazard ratio [HR], 0.68, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.38-1.22; P = 0.20) or all-cause mortality (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.71-1.65; P = 0.72) at 2.6-year follow up. In the patients not on statin treatment at entry, clarithromycin was associated with a significant increase in CV (HR, 1.90; 95% CI, 1.34-2.67; P = 0.0003; statin-clarithromycin interaction P = 0.0029) and all-cause mortality (HR, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.05-1.67; P = 0.016; statin-clarithromycin interaction P = 0.41). Multivariate analysis and 6-year follow up confirmed these results.

    "152": "A MEDLINE search (2000-August 2009) was completed using the key words ezetimibe, statins, endothelial function, flow-mediated dilation, pleiotropic, and inflammation to identify relevant literature. Bibliographies of identified literature were reviewed for additional references.",

    "154": "Recent studies in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), heart failure, and hypercholesterolemia have demonstrated that treatment with ezetimibe for 4-12 weeks elicits no improvement of endothelial function or other measures of cardiovascular disease risk. In contrast, other studies have reported that ezetimibe improves endothelial function in certain patient populations, including those with rheumatoid arthritis, CAD with type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome. However, the statin monotherapy comparator groups in these studies that yielded equivalent reductions in cholesterol were superior, or at least equivalent to, ezetimibe-containing regimens in the improvement of these ancillary endpoints.", 
    "155": "Overall, the evidence to date suggests that administration of ezetimibe, either as monotherapy or in combination with a statin, exerts minimal beneficial effects on endothelial function and other ancillary measures of cardiovascular disease risk beyond those conferred by its cholesterol-lowering effects. Studies with larger sample sizes and follow-up beyond 12 weeks remain necessary to further define the impact of ezetimibe on the processes integral to the pathogenesis and progression of cardiovascular disease.",

    "159": "Simvastatin is a commonly prescribed, moderately potent statin. Recent evidence suggests that the risk of severe muscle toxicity with simvastatin may be higher than that with other statins, particularly when used in combination with cytochrome P450 isoenzyme inhibitors. However, the lack of direct comparative clinical trials assessing the risk of myotoxicity among the statins in equivalent doses precludes definitive conclusions. Data sources examining low-to-moderate doses of simvastatin suggest that myotoxicity with this agent is infrequent, with rates similar to those seen with other statins. Conversely, findings from clinical trials using the maximum daily dose (80 mg) and a clinical trials database of varying doses of simvastatin suggest a possible increase in rates of myotoxicity with the 80-mg dose compared with lower doses and a higher incidence rate when compared with maximum doses of other statins.", 
    "160": "Overall, the rates of severe myotoxicity with all statins are low, especially with low-to-moderate doses. However, recent trials for those using simvastatin 80 mg daily suggest a higher incidence of myotoxicity compared with maximum approved doses of other statins. Practitioners should be aware of these possible risks and individualize therapy to limit myotoxicity.", 
    "161": "Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel has been shown to reduce subsequent cardiac events in patients with acute coronary syndrome or coronary artery stenting. Clopidogrel, a thienopyridine, is a prodrug that is transformed in vivo to an active metabolite by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system. The genes encoding CYP enzymes are polymorphic. Recent data demonstrated patients carrying a genetic variant of CYP enzymes (e.g. CYP2C19) would have a higher rate of ischemic events than non-carriers due to an attenuation of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic responses to clopidogrel. Furthermore, concomitant gastrointestinal ulcer prophylaxis with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is commonly prescribed to patients because of the increased risk of bleeding with dual antiplatelet therapy. PPIs are extensively metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system and have been associated with decreased antiplatelet activity of clopidogrel. In this review, we will discuss the impact of CYP450 enzymes genetic variation and CYP450 pathway drug-drug interactions in pharmacological and clinical response to clopidogrel.",

In statin-na\u00efve patients, 63% of stenotic arteries showed a progression, while a reduction could be observed in 28%. Decrease of ICA stenosis was most accentuated in patients with a mild stenosis and was independent of serum cholesterol levels.",

The stoichiometry of the binding and its stability in acidic medium, where beta-lactoglobulin is folded and stable, were also studied, along with competition from molecules that can be regarded as analogs of physiological ligands to bovine beta-lactoglobulin. Conditional binding data were combined with protein structural information derived from circular dichroism and limited proteolysis studies. Spectroscopic techniques were also used to assess whether the bound drugs stabilize the protein structure against denaturation by chaotropes or temperature at various pH values. The results obtained provide evidence for the presence of multiple binding regions on the protein, with a specific and different affinity for structurally different classes of hydrophobic drugs and, more generally, that bovine beta-lactoglobulin can bind and protect against low pH values various classes of drugs of pharmaceutical relevance.", 
    "167": "The CAMAG thin-layer chromatography mass spectrometer (TLC-MS) interface has been assessed as a tool for the direct quantitative bioanalysis of drugs from dried blood spot (DBS) samples, using an MS detector, with or without high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation. The approach gave acceptable sensitivity, linearity, accuracy, and precision data for bioanalytical validations with and without the inclusion of HPLC separation. In addition, the direct elution technique was shown to increase assay sensitivity for a range of analytes representing a wide \"chemical space\" for pharmaceutical-type molecules over that obtained by conventional manual extraction of samples (punching of DBS and elution with solvent prior to HPLC-MS analysis). Investigations were performed to optimize extraction time, minimize sample-to-sample carry-over, and compare chromatographic performance. On the basis of this preliminary assessment, it has been demonstrated that the TLC-MS interface has the potential to be an effective tool for the direct analysis of drugs in DBS samples at physiologically relevant concentrations, an approach that could provide significant time and cost savings and greatly simplify bioanalytical procedures compared to current manual practices. Further, the increased sensitivity compared to that of manual extraction may enable the analysis of analytes not currently amenable to DBS sampling due to limitations in assay sensitivity.",

    "172": "High blood pressure is a very common disease in hypercholesterolemic and diabetic patients and contributes to the increase in cardiovascular risk. Inhibitors of 3OH-3methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase are the most effective and widely used cholesterol-lowering drugs. They significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and death in both primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Although the long-term benefit by statin treatment is largely attributed to their cholesterol-lowering action, increasing attention focuses on additional actions called \"pleitropic effects\" that might explain the cardiovascular protection seen shortly after the initiation of therapy. Very few and small studies have investigated the antihypertensive effect of statins in patients with hypertension associated with hypercholesterolemia, and the results of recently published large statin studies (albeit not designed to answer this question) have attracted the interest on this subject. Many other studies, also not specifically aimed at the evaluation of the statins' antihypertensive effect, have provided information concerning changes in blood pressure during treatment with statins, but severe limitations such as inadequate study design, small or very small sample size, too short of a treatment period, and modification of concomitant antihypertensive therapy have prevented finding a definitive effect on blood pressure. From the available results, it appears consistent that statins may be useful in hypertensives with high serum total cholesterol, in those whose hypertension is not well controlled with antihypertensive agents even without high serum total cholesterol, in hypertensive subjects well controlled with antihypertensives without high serum cholesterol when they have high polymerase chain reaction levels, in those who require preventive measures because of other concomitant cardiovascular risk factors, or when they require secondary prevention. Future research could further characterize the impact of statin use alone or in combination with antihypertensive agents to delay the development of Stage 1 hypertension in prehypertension.",

The primary outcome was cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. Baseline low-density lipoprotein was the same, and rosuvastatin reduced low-density lipoprotein by 47% in both hs-CRP groups. Median hs-CRP was 1.10 mg/L in the lower and 5.60 mg/L in the higher hs-CRP group, with higher hs-CRP associated with worse outcomes. The change in hs-CRP with rosuvastatin from baseline to 3 months was -6% in the low hs-CRP group (27% with placebo) and -33.3% in the high hs-CRP group (-11.1% with placebo). In the high hs-CRP group, 548 placebo-treated (14.0 per 100 patient-years of follow-up) and 498 rosuvastatin-treated (12.2 per 100 patient-years of follow-up) patients had a primary end point (hazard ratio of placebo to rosuvastatin, 0.87; 95% confidence interval, 0.77 to 0.98; P=0.024).

    "188": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1alpha (PGC-1alpha) serves as an inducible coactivator for a number of transcription factors to control energy metabolism. Insulin signaling through Akt kinase has been demonstrated to phosphorylate PGC-1alpha at serine 571 and downregulate its activity in the liver. Statins are 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors that reduce cholesterol synthesis in the liver. In this study, we found that statins reduced the active form of Akt and enhanced PGC-1alpha activity. Specifically, statins failed to activate an S571A mutant of PGC-1alpha. The activation of PGC-1alpha by statins selectively enhanced the expression of energy metabolizing enzymes and regulators including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, acyl-CoA oxidase, carnitine palmitoyl transferase-1A, and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4. Importantly, a constitutively active form of Akt partially reduced the statin-enhanced gene expression.
