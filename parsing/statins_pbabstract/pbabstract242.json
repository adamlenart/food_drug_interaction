    "0": "Cardiovascular risk increases exponentially by multiple risk factors. Similarly, by simultaneously treating these risk factors the therapeutic benefit can be multiplied. It is also relevant that some drugs exert extra benefit by acting beyond their main effect. A wide range of pleiotropic effects have been reported among lipid lowering statins and third-generation calcium channel blockers. These include an increase of endothelial nitric oxide (NO) production, inhibition of free radical formation and reduction of migration and proliferation of smooth muscle cells independently from the main therapeutic effect of these drugs. Favorable \"therapeutic cross effects\" due to pleiotropic mechanisms can be defined as pleiosynergy.", 
    "1": "Ischemic stroke is the third cause of death and the most common cause of neurological disability. A main target of treatment is the still salvageable tissue surrounding the core of infarction and called \"ischemic penumbra\". Up to now the only drug approved for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke is recombinant tissue plasminogen activator to achieve early arterial recanalization and hypoxic tissue reperfusion and improve neural function. However, thrombolytic therapy has to be administered soon after the event since its efficacy is time dependent. This intervention also carries an increased risk of hemorrhagic transformation. In the rescue of poorly perfused cerebral regions an important role is played by collateral blood supply through the circle of Willis and through small pial vessels surrounding the lesion. The extent of collateralization is variable and at least in part regulated by the modulation of arteriolar nitric oxide (NO)-dependent endothelial function. Drugs that can improve endothelial function and cerebrovascular reactivity could have a role in collateral formation and infarct volume limitation. Statins affect endothelial NO production demonstrating their potential to influence endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) and in treating stroke. Phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors improve functional recovery after stroke in rats enhancing neuro and synapto genesis and increasing guanosine 3,5-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP). The aim of this review is to highlight the potential of these two classes of drugs in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke by analysing their pharmacological effects and involvement in the NO and cGMP pathways.", 
    "2": "Endothelial dysfunction, a well recognized marker of cardiovascular risk, is an early event in arteriosclerosis process. Diabetes mellitus, hypertension and dyslipidemia, known risk factors for coronary disease have been associated with endothelial dysfunction, which improves after the control of these factors. Statins have additional benefits on endothelial function not related to decreasing cholesterol levels, known as pleiotropic effects. Most recently it has been reported the effect of statins promoting bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells. These cells are positive for CD34 and KDR superficial markers of endothelial cellular lineage, which is consistent with the hypothesis that they constitute the endothelial progenitor cells. Circulating endothelial progenitor cells are involved in the repair process of the endothelium after endothelial-cell injury in myocardial ischemia, angina and other stressful situations. Recent studies have demonstrated an inverse relationship between the EPC count in peripheral blood and risk of developing a cardiovascular event. In addition, circulating EPC correlates with the presence of endothelial dysfunction and could play a role as a surrogate biologic marker in vascular function. The effect of statins on endothelial progenitor cells might contribute to improve endothelial function leading to a decrease in vascular risk, independently of their impact on LDL cholesterol. In this paper, we review the role of statins in EPC mobilization, its effect in endothelial function restoration and the relevance of this finding in cardiovascular risk. We also review future therapeutic implications.", 
    "3": "The electrochemical behavior of atorvastatin calcium at glassy carbon and boron-doped diamond electrodes has been studied using voltammetric techniques. The possible mechanism of oxidation was discussed with model compounds. The dependence of the peak current and potentials on pH, concentration, scan rate and nature of the buffer were investigated for both electrodes. The oxidation of atorvastatin was irreversible and exhibited a diffusion-controlled fashion on the diamond electrode. A linear response was obtained within the range of 9.65 x 10(-7) - 3.86 x 10(-5) M in 0.1 M H(2)SO(4) solution for both electrodes. The detection limits of a standard solution are estimated to be 2.11 x 10(-7) M with differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) and 2.05 x 10(-7)M with square wave voltammetry (SWV) for glassy carbon electrode, and 2.27 x 10(-7) M with DPV and 1.31 x 10(-7)M with SWV for diamond electrodes in 0.1 M H(2)SO(4) solution. The repeatability of the methods was found good for both electrodes. The methods were fully validated and successfully applied to the high-throughput determination of the drug in tablets, human serum and human urine with good recoveries.", 
    "4": "This study presents an application of two approaches in the design of constrained and unconstrained peptides in an investigation of the peptide binding effect for HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR). In previous works, hypocholesterolemic peptides isolated from soybean were determined as competitive inhibitory peptides for HMGR. Based on the modeling of an active peptide backbone in the active site of HMGR, two peptide libraries for constrained and unconstrained peptides were designed using different amino acids varying in hydrophobicity and electronic properties. Active peptides were selected by the design parameter 'V' or 'Pr', which reflects the probability of active peptide conformations for constrained and unconstrained peptides, respectively. Using peptides designed as mimics of HMGR substrates, and a combination of in vitro test and circular dichroism study, it was found that: (1) peptide binding causes an ordering of secondary structure, reflecting an increase of alpha-helical content; (2) HMGR binds the peptide without closure of the active site; and (3) peptide binding induces the protein aggregation. The GFPDGG peptide (IC(50)=1.5 microM), designed on the basis of the rigid peptide backbone, increases the inhibitory potency more than 300 times compared to the first isolated LPYP peptide (IC(50)=484 microM) from soybean. The obtained data imply the possibility of designing a highly potent inhibitory peptide for HMGR and confirm that changes of the secondary structure in the enzyme play an important role in the mechanism of HMGR inhibition.",

Alterations in endothelial function can occur rapidly, but changes in atherosclerosis are generally considered to occur more slowly. Vascular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful technique for accurate non-invasive assessment of central and peripheral arteries at multiple anatomical sites. We report the changes in atherosclerosis burden and arterial function in response to open label statin treatment, in 24 statin-na\u00efve newly diagnosed stable coronary artery disease patients. Patients underwent MRI before, and 3 and 12 months after commencing treatment. Mean LDL-C fell by 37% to 70.8 mg/dL (P<0.01). The plaque index (normalised vessel wall area) showed reductions in the aorta (2.3%, P<0.05) and carotid (3.1%, P<0.05) arteries at 3 months. Early reductions in atherosclerosis of aorta and carotid observed at 3 months were significantly correlated with later change at 12 months (R(2)=0.50, P<0.001; R(2)=0.22, P<0.05, respectively). Improvements in aortic distensibility and brachial endothelial function that were apparent after 3 months treatment were sustained at the 12-month time point.",

To further control for selection bias, a computed propensity score matching based on 14 major preoperative risk factors was performed. After propensity matching, conditional logistic regression analysis confirmed statin-treated hyperlipidemia and statin-untreated normolipidemia to be strongly related to reduced in-hospital major adverse cardiac events (odds ratio, 0.41; 95% confidence interval, 0.24-0.71 [P = .0013] and odds ratio, 0.23; 95% confidence interval, 0.11-0.48 [P = .0001]) but not with in-hospital mortality (odds ratio, 1.18; 95% confidence interval, 0.36-3.87 [P = .79] and odds ratio, 1.10; 95% confidence interval, 0.32-4.41 [P = .80]) after coronary artery bypass grafting surgery.",

Dyslipidemia is highly prevalent in patients with CKD and may contribute to the elevated cardiovascular risk as well as CKD progression. Statins are lipid-lowering drugs that appear to protect the kidneys via cholesterol reduction as well as noncholesterol-mediated mechanisms. Subgroup analyses of major clinical studies and meta-analyses of smaller trials indicate that statin therapy slows the decline of the glomerular filtration rate. Additionally, statins appear to reduce proteinuria in patients with CKD. Statins are well recognized to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with and without documented cardiovascular disease and in certain high-risk populations, such as persons with diabetes mellitus. However, conclusive evidence for improved cardiovascular outcomes with statin therapy for CKD is not yet available. Several ongoing studies are evaluating the effect of statins on cardiovascular end points in patients with CKD and may provide data needed to support adjunctive use of these agents in this high-risk population.", 
    "17": "Mitochondrial dysfunction is a major contributor to neurodegeneration, and causes vulnerability to oxidative stress and the activations of downstream cell death pathways. 3-Hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors, statins, were originally developed as cholesterol lowering agents, and have cholesterol-independent anti-excitotoxic and anti-oxidative properties. We investigated whether atorvastatin can prevent the neurodegeneration induced by a mitochondrial toxin, 3-nitropropionic acid (3NP), which inhibits succinate dehydrogenase complex II. Male Lewis rats were administered 3NP (63 mg/kg/day) using osmotic pumps for 5 days to induce striatal degeneration, and were also treated with either atorvastatin (1 or 10 mg/kg/day, orally) or vehicle (control) on five consecutive days. Atorvastatin-treated rats showed fewer neurologic deficits than control animals as measured at day 3-5. Atorvastatin-treated animals showed reduced striatal lesion volumes by Nissl staining, and decreased numbers of TUNEL-positive apoptosis and Fluoro-Jade C-positive degenerating neurons at 5 days. Atorvastatin reduced the numbers of c-Jun-positive and p-c-Jun-positive cells, as well as 3-nitrotyrosin-positive cells. In addition, atorvastatin increased p-extracellular signal-regulated kinase and p-Akt levels, and attenuated the up-regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase by 3NP. When N(omega)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester hydrochloride was administered concomitantly with the 3NP infusion, atorvastatin failed to further reduce the striatal lesion volume and c-Jun levels compared to the vehicle treatment. In summary, atorvastatin decreased striatal neurodegeneration induced by 3NP, with attenuating inducible nitric oxide synthase and c-Jun levels as well as activating extracellular signal-regulated kinase and Akt.",

Both matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and inflammation are involved in the initiation of atherosclerotic plaques and plaque instability. 2. 2,3,4 cent,5-Tetrahydroxystilbene-2-O-beta-D-glucoside (TSG) reduces the blood lipid content and prevents the atherosclerotic process, but the mechanism of action of TSG is unclear. The purpose of the present study was to test whether TSG can suppress MMP activation and inflammation in atherosclerotic rats. 3. Sixty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into six groups. Atherosclerosis was induced by feeding rats a hyperlipidaemic diet; TSG (120, 60 or 30 mg/kg per day) was administered by oral gavage. After 12 weeks of treatment, rats were killed (ethyl carbamate 1200 mg/kg) and serum lipids, C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha were measured. Haematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining was used to examine histopathological changes in the aorta. The mRNA and protein expression of MMPs were assayed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry and western blotting. Simvastatin (2 mg/kg per day) was administered as a positive control, whereas the vehicle (0.9% NaCl) group served as the untreated control. 4. In the present study, TSG significantly and dose-dependently attenuated the hyperlipidaemic diet-induced alterations in serum lipid profile and increases in CRP, IL-6 and TNF-a levels. In addition, TSG normalized the structure of the aortic wall and suppressed the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 at both the mRNA and protein level in the rat aortic wall. 5. In summary, TSG suppresses the expression of MMP-2 and MMP-9 and inhibits inflammation in the diet-induced atherosclerotic rats.",

    "33": "Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) responsiveness in cultured cells can be modulated by TGF-beta partitioning between lipid raft/caveolae- and clathrin-mediated endocytosis pathways. The TbetaR-II/TbetaR-I binding ratio of TGF-beta on the cell surface has recently been found to be a signal that controls TGF-beta partitioning between these pathways. Since cholesterol is a structural component in lipid rafts/caveolae, we have studied the effects of cholesterol on TGF-beta binding to TGF-beta receptors and TGF-beta responsiveness in cultured cells and in animals. Here we demonstrate that treatment with cholesterol, alone or complexed in lipoproteins, decreases the TbetaR-II/TbetaR-I binding ratio of TGF-beta while treatment with cholesterol-lowering or cholesterol-depleting agents increases the TbetaR-II/TbetaR-I binding ratio of TGF-beta in all cell types studied. Among cholesterol derivatives and analogs examined, cholesterol is the most potent agent for decreasing the TbetaR-II/TbetaR-I binding ratio of TGF-beta. Cholesterol treatment increases accumulation of the TGF-beta receptors in lipid rafts/caveolae as determined by sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation analysis of cell lysates. Cholesterol/LDL suppresses TGF-beta responsiveness and statins/beta-CD enhances it, as measured by the levels of P-Smad2 and PAI-1 expression in cells stimulated with TGF-beta. Furthermore, the cholesterol effects observed in cultured cells are also found in the aortic endothelium of atherosclerotic ApoE-null mice fed a high cholesterol diet. These results indicate that high plasma cholesterol levels may contribute to the pathogenesis of certain diseases (e.g., atherosclerosis) by suppressing TGF-beta responsiveness.",

To address this concern, an attempt to create a simple, reproducible, inexpensive, and sublethal toxicity bioassay for freshwater zooplankton was initiated. The approach was centered on characterizing the response of a zooplankton enzyme, chitobiase, to the presence of a toxicant. The aim of the present research was to develop a reproducible laboratory-based assay for Daphnia magna chitobiase activity and to screen four commonly prescribed pharmaceuticals using that assay. The four pharmaceuticals tested for potential effects on D. magna chitobiase activity were atorvastatin, lovastatin, fluoxetine, and sertraline. We were able to detect exposure-associated differences in chitobiase activity at concentrations of 0.1 mug/L fluoxetine after 24 and 72 hours of exposure. Differences were also detected for the other compounds. The response of chitobiase was found to be promising as an assay to measure sublethal effects in D. magna and perhaps other zooplankton species.",

Prostate cancer cases were identified by linkage to the KP California Cancer Registries. Statin exposure, estimated from automated KP outpatient pharmacy records (available since 1991 in Southern California and since 1994 in Northern California), was treated as time-varying and defined as the cumulative days dispensed of any statin from the first dispensing until a prostate cancer diagnosis, radical prostatectomy, termination of membership, or end of study (December 31, 2004). Cox proportional hazards models with age as the time scale were used to estimate rate ratios, while controlling for confounding variables. During follow-up, 888 prostate cancer cases, including 131 advanced cases, were identified. There was no association between ever statin use or <5 years use and prostate cancer. Conversely, >or=5 years use was associated with a 28% lower risk for prostate cancer compared with nonuse (adjusted rate ratio, 0.72; 95% confidence interval, 0.53-0.99). This association did not differ markedly for advanced disease. However, the association did seem to be restricted to those who regularly take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

It has however, been found to be an inhibitor of the intestinal cytochrome P - 450 3A4 system, which is responsible for the first pass metabolism of many drugs. The P - glycoprotein pump, found in the brush border of the intestinal wall which transports many of these cytochrome P - 450 3A4 substrates, has also been implicated to be inhibited by grapefruit juice. By inhibiting these enzyme systems, grapefruit juice alters the pharmacokinetics of a variety of medications, leading to elevation of their serum concentrations.

Simultaneous correction of low HDL-cholesterol and high total-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol may provide reductions in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality beyond those possible with statins alone. Nicotinic acid (niacin in the US) is the most effective means of increasing HDL-cholesterol available and has been shown to reduce cardiovascular event rates significantly. Niaspan (prolonged-release nicotinic acid) provides a convenient, once-daily means of administering nicotinic acid. Clinical studies with Niaspan have demonstrated marked, long-term increases in HDL-cholesterol with additional useful benefits on triglycerides, LDL-cholesterol, and lipid sub-profiles. The NAUTILUS study demonstrated the beneficial efficacy and tolerability profiles of Niaspan in a usual-care setting. The most common side-effect of Niaspan is flushing, which infrequently causes treatment discontinuation and which usually subsides over continued treatment. The ARBITER 2 and ARBITER 3 studies showed 1-2 years of treatment with Niaspan plus a statin induced regression of atherosclerosis in patients with coronary artery disease. The effect of Niaspan-statin treatment, relative to a statin alone, on clinical cardiovascular outcomes is currently under evaluation. Niaspan represents a practical means of correcting low HDL-cholesterol, an independent risk factor for adverse cardiovascular outcomes.",

Significant reductions in the risk of major cardiovascular events can be achieved with appropriate drug therapy, although patients with type 2 diabetes remain at increased risk compared with non-diabetics. The thiazolidinedione, pioglitazone, is known to offer multiple, potentially antiatherogenic, effects that may have a beneficial impact on macrovascular outcomes, including long-term improvements in insulin resistance (associated with an increased rate of atherosclerosis) and improvement in the atherogenic lipid triad (low HDL-cholesterol, raised triglycerides, and a preponderance of small, dense LDL particles) that is observed in patients with type 2 diabetes. The recent PROspective pioglitAzone Clinical Trial In macroVascular Events (PROactive) study showed that pioglitazone can reduce the risk of secondary macrovascular events in a high-risk patient population with type 2 diabetes and established macrovascular disease. Here, we summarize the key results from the PROactive study and place them in context with other recent outcome trials in type 2 diabetes.",

Pitavastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inihibitor, is known to have pleiotropic actions against the development of cardiovascular remodeling. The objectives of this study were to clarify the beneficial effects as well as the mechanism of action of pitavastatin against Ang II-induced organ damage. C57BL6/J mice at 10 weeks of age were infused with Ang II for 2 weeks and were simultaneously administered pitavastatin or a vehicle. Pitavastatin treatment improved Ang II-induced left ventricular hypertrophy and diastolic dysfunction and attenuated enhancement of cardiac fibrosis, cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, coronary perivascular fibrosis, and medial thickening. Ang II-induced oxidative stress, cardiac TGFbeta-1 expression, and Smad 2/3 phosphorylation were all attenuated by pitavastatin treatment. Pitavastatin also reduced Ang II-induced cardiac remodeling and diastolic dysfunction in eNOS-/- mice as in wild-type mice. In eNOS-/- mice, the Ang II-induced cardiac oxidative stress and TGF-beta-Smad 2/3 signaling pathway were enhanced, and pitavastatin treatment attenuated the enhanced oxidative stress and the signaling pathway. Moreover, pitavastatin treatment reduced the high mortality rate and improved renal insufficiency in Ang II-treated eNOS-/- mice, with suppression of glomerular oxidative stress and TGF-beta-Smad 2/3 signaling pathway. In conclusion, pitavastatin exerts eNOS-independent protective actions against Ang II-induced cardiovascular remodeling and renal insufficiency through inhibition of the TGF-beta-Smad 2/3 signaling pathway by suppression of oxidative stress.",

Inflammation plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of both APS secondary to systemic lupus erythematosus and atheroma. Several drugs currently used in APS have also anti-atherogenic properties via their anti-inflammatory effect. Furthermore, in addition to screening and treatment of traditional cardiovascular risk factors, it has been suggested that the introduction of some new medication such as statins in APS patients could be useful. This review assesses the current knowledge in this field and the justification for this new therapeutical approach. Furthermore, these data underscore the necessity for the use of other medication for atherosclerosis in APS patients, such as immunomodulatory drugs, which would be complementary to the anti-thrombotic and anti-platelet therapy.",

Statins are generally safe; however, the results of clinical trials do demonstrate possibilities of significant adverse effects in liver and muscle. Moreover, the numbers from the trials may not reflect the real situation in daily practice because individuals at increased risk for hepatotoxicity are usually deliberately and carefully excluded in clinical trials. We presented an 85-year-old woman who had a marked elevation of ALT (up to 409 U/L) after treatment with fluvastatin 80 mg/day for 6 weeks. Hepatitis C was identified after this episode. The elevation of ALT resolved 10 weeks after discontinuation of fluvastatin. Re-institution of fluvastatin from 40 to 80 mg/day for 2 months only cause mild elevation of ALT. This case suggests that elevation of transaminases during statin therapy may not be solely ascribed to statins.

Standardized mean differences (effect size) with 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for each study and pooled effect size was calculated. A total of 6 studies were included in the meta-analysis. As compared to placebo, statins caused a significant decrease in total cholesterol (TC) [-3.11% (95% CI -3.46 to -2.99)], low-density lipoprotein (LDL) [-4.01% (95% CI -4.27 to -3.81)], triglyceride (TG) [-1.41 (95% CI -1.66 to -1.26)] and a significant increase in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) [1.12 (95% CI 0.73 1.13)].

Three formulations of Inegy are commercialized and reimbursed in Belgium, ezetimibe 10 mg/simvastatin 20 mg, ezetimibe 10 mg/simvastatin 40 mg and ezetimibe 10 mg/ simvastatin 80 mg. By blocking both synthesis and absorption of cholesterol, the fixed combination exerts a cholesterol-lowering effect as important as, or even greater than, that observed with the highest dosage of simvastatin and other statins, with a good tolerance profile. Inegy is indicated, as adjuvant treatment to diet, in patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia (homozygote or heterozygote familial form and non-familial polygenic form) not well controlled with a statin alone.

Serial volumetric IVUS analyses of a matched left main coronary arterial site were performed. A significant reduction in low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) level of 33.2% (p<0.001) was observed in the pitavastatin group. Plaque volume index (PVI) was significantly reduced in the pitavastatin group (10.6+/-9.4% decrease) compared with the control group (8.1+/-14.0% increase, p<0.001).

Significant cholesterol-lowering effects from the baseline were observed in the case of the PS/DAG oil treatment alone. Changes in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol were inversely correlated with baseline serum campesterol concentrations (r=-0.560, P<0.05), but not baseline LDL cholesterol concentrations. In addition, serum apolipoprotein B concentrations were reduced to a greater extent in subjects with high versus low levels of baseline campesterol (-13.2 mg/dL vs. -3.1 mg/dL, P<0.05).

Cardiac catheterization is typically reserved for patients in whom the diagnosis remains unclear, those requiring coronary angiography prior to valve replacement, and in the setting of complex valve disease. Cardiac computed tomography (CT) has recently been applied as a research tool to quantify the amount of aortic valve calcium (AVC), which has served as a clinical end point in several medical therapy trials. Medical therapy for aortic valve disease remains an active area of clinical research. Multiple retrospective studies have shown a benefit for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors or statins) in reducing disease progression. However, two recently completed prospective, randomized trials yielded conflicting results. The data for using angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are in the preliminary stages.

    "82": "Dyslipidemia is a pathological alteration of serum lipid levels. The most common forms are either elevations of triglycerides or low density lipoprotein cholesterol associated with a reduction of high density lipoprotein cholesterol. Most frequently both forms of lipid disorders are combined. Elevations of free fatty acid blood levels are commonly not subsumed under the term dyslipidemia. However, free fatty acids should also be considered, as they are frequently associated with dyslipidemia and represent a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Dyslipidemias are among the major etiologic factors for arterial occlusive diseases. Resulting in fatal implications such as stroke and coronary heart disease, dyslipidemias contribute to the most prevalent causes of death. Lowering of low density lipoprotein and raising of high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels have been shown in both epidemiologic and intervention studies to decrease mortality. Established treatments of dyslipidemias are statins and fibrates. However, recent research has established some new potential therapeutic targets which are currently investigated in clinical trials. New therapeutic approaches include subtype selective, dual, and pan-agonists of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor, inhibitors of the cholesterol ester transfer protein, Acyl-CoA-cholesterol-acyltransferase, squalene synthase, microsomal triglycerid-transfer-protein, and cholesterol absorption. Clinical implications of new drugs under investigation are discussed in this review.",

Dry adsorbed emulsions were prepared by using colloidal silicon dioxide in varying proportions to adsorb the liquid emulsion. Liquid emulsions were characterized for viscosity and mean globule size, and the dry adsorbed emulsions were evaluated for powder characteristics and reconstitution properties, dissolution profile, and for in vivo efficacy in rats. DSC and X-ray diffraction studies indicated complete amorphization and/or solubilization of Simvastatin in the dry adsorbed emulsion. It was supported by SEM studies, which did not show evidence of precipitation of the drug on the surface of the carrier. Dissolution studies revealed remarkable increase in dissolution of the drug compared to plain drug. One of the optimized formulations provided 10-fold enhancement in the dissolution compared to drug powder. After 24 hr of induction of hyperlipidemia in rats using poloxamer F127, administration of dry adsorbed emulsions effected significant reduction in the total cholesterol with levels of 439 mg/dL compared to 585 mg/dL of drug treated group (p < 0.01).

    "88": "The cytoskeleton of cerebral microvascular endothelial cells is a critical determinant of blood-brain barrier (BBB) function. Barrier integrity appears to be particularly sensitive to the phosphorylation state of specific residues within myosin regulatory light chain (RLC), one of two accessory light chains of the myosin II motor complex. Phosphorylation of myosin RLC by myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) has been implicated in BBB dysfunction associated with alcohol abuse and hypoxia, whereas dephosphorylation may enhance BBB integrity following exposure to lipid-lowering statin drugs. Using immunohistochemistry we provide evidence of widespread myosin II RLC distribution throughout the cerebral vasculature of the mouse. Light microscopy revealed immunolocalization of myosin II RLC protein in the endothelium of brain capillaries, the endothelial cell layer of arterioles and in association with venules. Immunolabeling of myosin RLC in non-muscle endothelial cells could be distinguished from myosin RLC immunoreactivity associated with the smooth muscle layer of the tunica media in larger muscular arterioles. These findings support an emerging role for myosin II RLC as a component of the actomyosin cytoskeleton of cerebral endothelial cells with the potential to contribute to the selective vulnerability of the brain in vivo.",

    "105": "Survivors of ischemic stroke are at significant risk for recurrent stroke. Appropriate therapy for stroke prevention is needed given the significant morbidity and mortality associated with stroke, the high financial costs, and the neurologic disability associated with treatment failure. A treatment strategy based on assessed risk represents an appropriate use of medical resources and results in improved outcomes. This approach requires evaluation of major risk factors, the most serious of which is a history of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. The annual risk for recurrent stroke is 6% during the first 5 years after an initial stroke. Non-modifiable risk factors include age, race, ethnicity, gender, family history, and geography. The most important modifiable risk factor is hypertension. Diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, left ventricular hypertrophy, atrial fibrillation, and lifestyle factors such as smoking, alcohol abuse, and obesity contribute to stroke risk. Antihypertensive, lipid-lowering, and antiplatelet therapies have been successful in reducing the incidence of secondary stroke. Clinical trials validate the benefits of statin therapy in reducing the risk for secondary stroke. Studies of antiplatelet agents, including aspirin, clopidogrel, and aspirin combined with extended-release dipyridamole, have evaluated the risk reduction in recurrent stroke and have been concerned particularly with the risk for hemorrhage. Therapy for stroke prevention based on risk stratification can identify patients who are appropriate targets for aggressive intervention.",

The present study aimed to examine the association of outpatient use of these medications on 30-day mortality for subjects aged >65 yrs and hospitalised with community-acquired pneumonia. A retrospective national cohort study was conducted using the Department of Veterans Affairs administrative data including subjects aged >/=65 yrs hospitalised with community-acquired pneumonia, and having >/=1 yr of prior Veterans Affairs outpatient care. In total, 8,652 subjects were identified with a mean age of 75 yrs, 98.6% were male, and 9.9% of subjects died within 30 days of presentation. In this cohort, 18.1% of subjects were using statins and 33.9% were using ACE inhibitors. After adjusting for potential confounders, current statin use (odds ratio (OR) 0.54, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.42-0.70) and ACE inhibitor use (OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.68-0.89) were significantly associated with decreased 30-day mortality.

Patients received either single or 2-weeks repeated doses of both simvastatin and atorvastatin, following a randomised, double-blind, cross-over design. Blood samples were collected before drug administration and at the scheduled intervals after administration, and the obtained serum was separated by centrifugation, sterilized and frozen until assayed. Cultured SMC were supplemented with medium plus 15% of separate serum sampled from the patients, and grown for 72 h. Proliferation was assayed by a Coulter Counter, while cholesterol biosynthesis was measured by the incorporation of 14C-acetate into cholesterol, under the same experimental conditions. Atorvastatin was more active vs. simvastatin in reducing total- (-28.3% vs. -20.7%; p=0.045) and LDL-cholesterol (-39.8% vs. -30.1%; p=0.011) after a 2-weeks regimen. Serum from atorvastatin-treated patients inhibited SMC proliferation vs.t=0 after both single (AUC -21.6%) and repeated (AUC -26.9%) doses, while serum from simvastatin-treated patients inhibited SMC proliferation only after repeated doses (AUC -24.5%). Interestingly, in the same experimental conditions, the serum concentrations of both statins (and of their active metabolites) were constantly below the detection limits, as shown from the lack of inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis. The absence of any significant association between the lipid-lowering effects and the inhibition of SMC proliferation, together with no detectable active statin in the serum, suggests that these effects are elicited through independent mechanisms.", 
    "116": "Neural membranes are composed of glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids, cholesterol and proteins. The distribution of these lipids within the neural membrane is not random but organized. Neural membranes contain lipid rafts or microdomains that are enriched in sphingolipids and cholesterol. These rafts act as platforms for the generation of glycerophospholipid-, sphingolipid-, and cholesterol-derived second messengers, lipid mediators that are necessary for normal cellular function. Glycerophospholipid-derived lipid mediators include eicosanoids, docosanoids, lipoxins, and platelet-activating factor. Sphingolipid-derived lipid mediators include ceramides, ceramide 1-phosphates, and sphingosine 1-phosphate. Cholesterol-derived lipid mediators include 24-hydroxycholesterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol, and 7-ketocholesterol. Abnormal signal transduction processes and enhanced production of lipid mediators cause oxidative stress and inflammation. These processes are closely associated with the pathogenesis of acute neural trauma (stroke, spinal cord injury, and head injury) and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease. Statins, the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, are effective lipid lowering agents that significantly reduce risk for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. Beneficial effects of statins in neurological diseases are due to their anti-excitotoxic, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties. Fish oil omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, have similar anti-excitotoxic, antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in brain tissue. Thus the lipid mediators, resolvins, protectins, and neuroprotectins, derived from eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid retard neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptotic cell death in brain tissue. Like statins, ingredients of fish oil inhibit generation of beta-amyloid and provide protection from oxidative stress and inflammatory processes. Collective evidence suggests that antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties of statins and fish oil contribute to the clinical efficacy of treating neurological disorders with statins and fish oil. We speculate that there is an overlap between neurochemical events associated with neural cell injury in stroke and neurodegenerative diseases. This commentary compares the neurochemical effects of statins with those of fish oil.",

In secondary prevention of stroke, statins clearly reduced the risk of major coronary events. In the SPARCL (Stroke Prevention by Aggressive Reduction in Cholesterol Levels) trial, compared with placebo, the patients with a recent stroke or transient ischaemic attack without coronary heart disease randomised to atorvastatin 80 mg/day had a significant 16% relative risk reduction of stroke and a 35% reduction in the risk of major coronary events. This was obtained despite the fact that 25% of patients allocated to the placebo arm were prescribed a commercially available statin outside the trial. A post-hoc analysis used blinded low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) measurements (taken at study visits during the trial) as a marker of adherence to lipid-lowering therapy. Compared with the group with no change or an increase in LDL-C (the group adherent to placebo or not taking a statin), the group with >or= 50% reduction in LDL-C had a significant 31% reduction in the risk of stroke. The next step is to define whether or not achieving a LDL-C of < 70 mg/dl is better than a standard dose of statin (LDL approximately 100 - 110 mg/dl) in the secondary prevention of stroke. Statins are effective in reducing both first-ever and recurrent stroke, and this effect seems driven by the extent of LDL-C lowering.",

However, Cynomolgus monkeys respond to high-cholesterol diet with increased hepatic ACAT2 mRNA expression. Also, a decrease in hepatic ACAT2 mRNA expression has been observed during statin treatment in humans. Thus, we hypothesized that cholesterol may exert transcriptional regulation on the human ACAT2 gene. To test this, we studied two human hepatoma cell lines (HuH7 and HepG2) under conditions of cholesterol loading or depletion and analyzed ACAT gene expression, enzymatic activity, and cellular cholesterol mass. We show a dose-dependent increase of ACAT2 mRNA expression, an increased enzymatic activity of ACAT2, and increased esterified cholesterol mass upon cholesterol loading.
