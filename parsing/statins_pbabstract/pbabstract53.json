Only 2.9% combined two types of modern drugs, while 0.4% combined three types (antihypertensives, statins and aspirin). Herbal compounds, sometimes with internationally rarely recommended drugs such as Reserpine were taken by 44%. Analysis of drug adherence showed that 9.8% had discontinued their drug therapy by themselves. 16% had missed doses and these were on less anti-hypertensive drugs than those who did not (t=-5.217, P=0.003). Of all participants, 28% currently smoked, 39% drank regularly and only 21% exercised frequently. The average salt intake per day was 7.1 (\u00b13.8) g, while the national recommended level is 6g.",

There is a need to review the community-based guidelines for hypertension management. Health providers and patients should make a transition from solely treating hypertension, towards prevention of CVD. Health system issues need addressing including improving rural health insurance cover and primary care doctors' capacity to manage chronic disease patients.",

Contraindicated co-medication was defined as prescription periods of statins and contraindicated drugs overlapping by at least one day. Co-medication patterns were classified into 3 categories as follows: co-medication in the same prescription, co-medication by the same medical institution, and co-medication by different medical institutions. The proportion of co-medication was analyzed by age, gender, co-morbidities, and the statin's generic name.",

Therefore, it is imperative that practitioners have not only a working knowledge of information related to statins, but more specifically to their efficacy and safety in elderly populations. Pitavastatin is the most recent statin to receive regulatory approval. It is indicated for the treatment of primary hyperlipidemia or mixed dyslipidemia as an adjunctive therapy to diet. The overall body of evidence for the efficacy and safety of pitavastatin in elderly patients is small. The available data suggest that the ability of pitavastatin to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol in elderly patients is at least similar, and may be greater than that seen in comparatively younger cohorts. Taken together, the limited available data suggest that pitavastatin is effective at improving lipid parameters in elderly patients with a similar safety profile to other agents in the class. Until data become available distinguishing pitavastatin from the other available options, its ultimate role in the hyperlipidemia treatment armamentarium remains unclear.",

First, the established kinetic models and kinetic parameters showed that the cell growth, Monacolin K formation and glycerol consumption in SSF were more rapid than those in SmF. Secondly, the comparison of fatty acid composition of mycelial cells indicated a better fluidity and permeability of the cell membrane in SSF than that of SmF, which was also consistent with the difference in the ratio of extracellular/intracellular Monacolin K between the two systems. Thirdly, the phenomenon of glycerol concentration gradient was verified in SSF, which could well explain the resistance effect to high concentration of glycerol in SSF. These new findings provide some important insights to the elucidation of the advantages of SSF for the synthesis of fungal secondary metabolites.",

Plasma levels of leptin, adiponectin, visfatin, tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), free fatty acids (FFA), and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were assessed separately for men and women before and after 30 days of treatment.", 
    "21": "At baseline, plasma levels of adiponectin and leptin were lower, while plasma levels of TNF-alpha were higher in men than in women. Administration of simvastatin and statin/ezetimibe combination for 30 days reduced plasma levels of hsCRP, FFA, leptin, visfatin, and TNF-alpha but increased plasma levels of adiponectin, while the effect of ezetimibe was much more limited. The effect of simvastatin and ezetimibe, administered alone or in combination, on plasma hsCRP, FFA, leptin, adiponectin, visfatin, and TNF-alpha did not differ between men and women. Irrespectively of sex, the changes in plasma adipokines and systemic-anti-inflammatory effects were more expressed in simvastatin - than in ezetimibe-treated patients and were strongest when both these agents were administered together.",

Newly diagnosed dementia patients 65 years and older and controls were sampled. A total of 8406 dementia and 16,812 control subjects were enrolled from Taiwan NHIRD during 2006 to 2010. The relationships between zolpidem use and dementia were measured using odds and adjusted odds ratios. The relationship between the average cumulative doses for zolpidem and dementia was also analyzed.Zolpidem alone or with other underlying diseases, such as hypertension, diabetes, and stroke, was significantly associated with dementia after controlling for potential confounders, such as age, sex, coronary artery disease, diabetes, anti-hypertension drugs, stroke, anticholesterol statin drugs, depression, anxiety, benzodiazepine, anti-psychotic, and anti-depressant agents' use (Adjusted OR\u200a=\u200a1.33, 95% CI 1.24-1.41). Zolpidem use also has significant dose-response effects for most of the types of dementia. In patient with Alzheimer diseases, the effects of zolpidem among patients with Alzheimer's disease remained obscure. The adjusted OR for patients whose cumulative exposure doses were between 170 and 819\u200amg/year (adjusted OR: 1.65, 95% CI 1.08-2.51, P\u200a=\u200a0.0199) was significant; however, the effects for lower and higher cumulative dose were not significant.Zolpidem used might be associated with increased risk for dementia in elderly population. Increased accumulative dose might have higher risk to develop dementia, especially in patients with underlying diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and stroke.", 
    "24": "Statin withdrawal is associated with deleterious outcome on stroke patients. Whether risk changes over time, depends on concomitant treatment of intravenous thrombolysis, or both remains to be clarified. We assessed the influence of statin withdrawal within 3 weeks while initiated in acute phase (72 hours) among patients receiving intravenous thrombolysis.This was a monocentered retrospective observational study enrolling intravenous thrombolytic stroke patients from June 2009 to May 2014. Consecutive patients were distinguished into 3 groups according to the initiation and withdrawal of statin: the reference group (not received statin in 72 hours after stroke onset); the continued group (initiated statin therapy in 72 hours and continued for at least 3 weeks); the withdrawal group (initiated statin in 72 hours and discontinued within 3 weeks). All reasons for cessation were recorded. The effects of statin withdrawal on short-, mid-, and long-term outcomes were evaluated as neurologic improvement (NIH Stroke Scale [NIHSS] score improvement \u22654 from baseline or later NIHSS\u200a=\u200a0), death or poor outcome (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] \u22654), and favorable outcome (mRS \u22642). We further evaluate statin withdrawal effects in cardioembolic stroke patients for these outcomes.Among 443 IVT patients enrolled, 367 were included in the final study population. There were 88, 188, and 91 patients in the reference, continued, and withdrawal groups, respectively. Multivariable logistic regression showed that statin withdrawal compared with the reference was related to a lower possibility of long-term favorable outcome (OR\u200a=\u200a0.45, 95% CI [0.22, 0.90], P\u200a=\u200a0.024). Compared with the continued group, the adjusted OR of statin withdrawal was 0.40 (95% CI [0.22, 0.72], P\u200a=\u200a0.002) and 2.52 (95% CI [1.34, 4.75], P\u200a=\u200a0.004) for long-term favorable and poor/death outcomes, respectively. Also, results were similar for cardioembolic stroke patients (OR\u200a=\u200a0.35, 95% CI [0.14, 0.89], P\u200a=\u200a0.027 of favorable outcome and OR\u200a=\u200a3.62, 95% CI [1.37, 9.62], P\u200a=\u200a0.010 of poor/death outcome).In a real-world setting, for stroke patients receiving intravenous thrombolysis, statin withdrawal within 3 weeks initiating in 72 hours may have a harmful effect on the long-term neurologic outcome, even in cardioembolic stroke patients.", 
    "25": "We evaluated the role of statins in delaying insulin use and diabetes-related diseases in Asian patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) because statins can cause new-onset diabetes.We used data from the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database in this retrospective cohort study. The 12,470 T2DM patients were categorized into 2 cohorts: a statin cohort comprising 2545 patients who received statin therapy for at least 6 months (180 days) before the index date and a nonstatin cohort comprising 9925 patients who did not receive statin therapy. The control-to-case ratio was set at approximately 4:1. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression analyses were performed to evaluate the risk of diabetes-related events and insulin use on receiving statin treatment.Patients in the statin cohort had a 48% lower risk of diabetes-related coma than those in the nonstatin cohort (95% confidence interval\u200a=\u200a0.29-0.92). Patients with >730 days of statin therapy had a significantly lower risk of insulin use, diabetes-related disorders of the eye and neurons, and peripheral circulatory disorders. Compared with patients in the nonstatin cohort, the risk of insulin use, diabetes-related coma, and diabetes-related disorders of the eye and neurons was lower in patients on a cumulative defined daily dose (cDDD) of statins for >475 days.These results suggest that longer duration of statin use and higher cDDD of statins can delay insulin use in Asian patients with T2DM.",

The incorporation of side-chain-protected natural amino acids into functional CtPs was performed to explore the potential biological functions. Several novel CtPs that consist of protected serine (S(Bn)) and/or glutamate (E(OBn)) were prepared from corresponding linear tripeptides by chemical synthesis. There is a strong possibility for CtPs that contain 3 phenyl groups to correlate with atorvastatin structure. The binding effects in human HMG-CoA reductase (hHMGR) activities were first evaluated by molecular docking. High docking scores were received with these CtPs for enzyme. Therefore, enzymatic assays were carried out and the compound cyclo(S(Bn))3 was indeed able to moderately inhibit hHMGR (IC50 = 110 \u03bcM).", 
    "27": "The aim of the study was to analyze all the available evidence from both in vitro and in vivo studies regarding the efficacy of statin therapy in the treatment of endometriosis, evaluating the potential efficacy, side effects, and contraindications of their administration in humans. We focused on defining the potential benefits that the administration of statins may have on patients affected by endometriosis and the possible adverse effects of such a therapy on ovarian function and fertility profile. According to our article selection criteria, we included in the review in vitro and in vivo studies performed on human or animal models. The systematic review of literature identified 24 eligible articles, 12 of which reported evidence regarding the effects of statins on endometrial/endometriotic cells and 12 regarding their effects on ovarian function and fertility. All articles seem to emphasize the utility of statin administration in the treatment of endometriosis due to their anti-proliferative/proapoptotic effects, their ability to reduce cell viability and migration, and the inhibition of angiogenesis and anti-inflammatory activities. Regarding the potential adverse effects on gonadal activities, steroidogenesis and fertility function, no conclusive data were collected in human models (excluding women affected by polycystic ovary syndrome in which significant decline of androgen levels was reported after statin treatment), while contrasting results were reported by studies conducted in in vitro and in vivo in animal models. Despite evidence supporting statins as the potential therapeutic agent for a targeted conservative treatment of endometriosis, the uncertainties regarding their impact on gonadal function may not define them as an appropriate therapy for all young fertile women.",

Adults with type 2 diabetes and hypercholesterolemia whose LDL-C measured <140\u00a0mg/dl (subjects receiving lipid-lowering drugs) or <160\u00a0mg/dl (subjects not receiving lipid-lowering drugs) at the start of the screening phase, were randomized after a 5-week wash-out period to ezetimibe 10\u00a0mg or placebo (1:1) for 24\u00a0weeks. Changes in HbA1c, glycoalbumin and fasting plasma glucose from baseline to week 24 were evaluated. The non-inferiority margin was set at 0.5% for HbA1c.", 
    "30": "Overall, 152 subjects were randomized (75 to ezetimibe and 77 to placebo). From baseline to 24\u00a0weeks, HbA1c significantly increased in both the ezetimibe and placebo groups (between-treatment difference 0.08 [95% CI: -0.07 to 0.23]). Ezetimibe was statistically non-inferior to placebo. At 24\u00a0weeks, the mean change from baseline in glycoalbumin levels (between-treatment differences 0.00 [95% CI: -0.47, 0.47]) and fasting plasma glucose (between-treatment differences -4.8 [95% CI: -12.1, 2.1]) were similar in both treatment groups.",

Since the introduction of statins onto the market in 1990s the originally strict conditions gradually relaxed while the prescription rates and public costs were rising. The aim was to analyze long-term utilization trends of statins, changes in their reimbursement prices and prescribing conditions, and the evolution of the market.",

    "35": "Between 1997 and 2013 the utilization of statins rose from 2 to 96 DDD/TID while the expenditure rose 5.5-fold. The rise of prescription for each molecule was always observed after the liberation of the prescribing criteria. In the study period reimbursement prices of simvastatin and atorvastatin gradually decreased to just 5% of their initial values.",

    "38": "HUVECs were isolated from the human umbilical cords from normal pregnancies and exposed to medium containing 25.5 mM D-glucose for 24 hours as the HG induction model (HG group). In the HG plus atorvastatin groups or KLF2 gene transduction, the medium then was collected for the nitric oxide (NO) assay and the cells were harvested for Western blot and for the real-time polymerase chain reaction to observe the expression of KLF2, vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, total and phosphorylated endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-3 and the role of the p38MAPK and ERK1/2 intracellular signal pathway. The cells' apoptosis was analyzed by flow cytometry.", 
    "39": "HG dose-dependently increased apoptosis. The presence of HG inhibited the expression of KLF2 mRNA and protein in HUVECs and atorvastatin treatment increased KLF2 expression, thus counteracted HG-induced suppression of KLF2 expression, and overexpression of KLF2 might protect the cells from apoptosis. HG increased the expression of VCAM-1, ICAM-1, but decreased the nitric oxide release and the expression of p-eNOs/eNos in HUVECs. However, atorvastatin reversed these changes and also attenuated high-glucose induced p38 MAPK and ERK1/2 phosphorylation.",

    "41": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death worldwide. The efficacy and safety of statins (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors) in primary and secondary prevention of CAD are confirmed in several large studies. It is well known that statins have some pleiotropic, anti-atherosclerotic effects. We review the molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of statins revealed in recently published studies. Endothelial cell injury is regarded as the classic stimulus for the development of atherosclerotic lesions. In addition, the inflammatory process plays an important role in the aetiology of atherosclerosis. In particular, chronic inflammation plays a key role in coronary artery plaque instability and subsequent occlusive thrombosis. Our previous reports and others have demonstrated beneficial effects of statins on endothelial dysfunction and chronic inflammation in CAD. A better understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying the effectiveness of statins against atherosclerosis may provide a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of coronary atherosclerosis. The present review summarizes the cellular and molecular mechanism of statins against coronary atherosclerosis.", 
    "42": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the most dreaded metabolic disorders in the world today. It is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality, and plays a cardinal role in quality of life and health economics. DM is associated with a high prevalence of microvascular and macrovascular complications. DM is a very important cardiovascular (CV) risk factor. Cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been implicated as the prime cause of mortality and morbidity in patients with DM. Hence, treatment of DM goes beyond glycemic control, and demands a multidisciplinary approach that comprehensively targets risk factors inherent in CV events. Lipid abnormalities are undoubtedly common in patients with DM, and they contribute to an increased risk of CVD. A high-risk lipid profile, termed atherogenic dyslipidemia of diabetes (ADD), is known to occur in patients with DM. The use of lipid-lowering agents, a quintessential part of the multifactorial risk factor approach, is a crucial intervention to minimize diabetes-related complications. In this article, we discuss the role of peroxisome proliferator activator receptor (PPAR) alpha/gamma (\u03b1/\u03b3) agonist, saroglitazar, in the management of ADD. While statins are irrefutably the first line of drugs for dyslipidemia management in patients with residual CV risk while on a statin, PPAR \u03b1/\u03b3 agonists have been found to be of substantial benefit. Data from the PRESS I-VI clinical trials testify to the fact that saroglitazar and fibrates have similar efficacy in reducing triglycerides and improving high-density lipoprotein. The ancillary benefit of improved glycemic control, without the weight gain of PPAR \u03b3 agonists, is an added advantage. Reduction in ADD, improved glycemic control, efficacy at par with fibrates, and an acceptable safety profile form the grounds on which this group of PPAR \u03b1/\u03b3 agonists, with their novel mechanism, holds a promising future in the management of diabetic dyslipidemia.", 
    "43": "Hepatic OATPs 1B1, 1B3 and 2B1, as well as P-gp, play important roles in regulating liver uptake and biliary excretion of drugs. The intrinsic ethnic variability in OATP1B1-mediated hepatic uptake of statins has been proposed to underlie the ethnic variability in plasma exposures of statins between Caucasians and Asians. Using a targeted quantitative proteomic approach, we determined hepatic protein concentrations of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OATP2B1, P-gp, and PMCA4 (a housekeeping protein) in a panel of human livers (n = 141) and compared protein expression across Caucasian, Asian, African-American, and unidentified donors. Using an optimized protocol that included sodium deoxycholate as a membrane protein solubilizer, the hepatic protein expression levels (mean \u00b1 S.D.) of these transporters across all livers were determined to be 15.0 \u00b1 6.0, 16.1 \u00b1 8.1, 4.1 \u00b1 1.3, 0.6 \u00b1 0.2, and 2.4 \u00b1 1.0 fmol/\u03bcg of total membrane protein, respectively. The scaling factor was 3.5 mg of total membrane protein in 100 mg of wet liver tissue. OATP1B1 protein expression was significantly associated with the c.388A>G (rs2306283, N130D) single nucleotide polymorphism. When compared across ethnicity, the hepatic expression levels of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 were unexpectedly higher in Asians relative to Caucasians, suggesting that hepatic OATP expression alone does not explain the increased systemic statin levels in Asians compared with Caucasians. These findings may help improve physiologically based pharmacokinetic modeling to predict statin pharmacokinetic profiles and enable extrapolation of pharmacokinetic data of OATP substrates across ethnic groups.",

Myopathy and hepatotoxicity, however, have been reported as side effects in a small percentage of statin users. This study aimed to investigate the cytotoxicity and the effect of atorvastatin on microRNA expression in HepG2 cells. The methylthiazol tetrazolium assay was used to assess hepatocyte viability and at 20\u2009\u03bcM atorvastatin (24\u2009h) treatment were 82\u2009\u00b1\u20091.5% viable (P\u2009=\u20090.0002). Levels of intracellular ATP in cells treated with 20\u2009\u03bcM atorvastatin were reduced by 1.25-fold, P\u2009=\u20090.002. Cytotoxicity, measured by the release of intracellular lactate dehydrogenase, was increased from 0.95\u2009\u00b1\u20090.29 units in control cells to 1.12\u2009\u00b1\u20090.02 units (P\u2009=\u20090.002) in atorvastatin treated cells. A panel of 84-miRNA species was used to evaluate the effect of atorvastatin on miRNA expression. MiR-124a was significantly up-regulated by atorvastatin (12.94-fold). A significant decrease in GAMT expression (3.54-fold) was observed in atorvastatin treated cells following quantitative PCR analysis. In addition, western blotting data showed GAMT protein levels were significantly lower than the controls (3.02-fold) and analysis of creatine levels in treated cells showed a significant decrease in the atorvastatin treated culture supernatant compared to control culture supernatant (32.33\u2009\u00b1\u20093.51\u2009\u03bcM/l vs. 59.67\u2009\u00b1\u20091.52\u03bcM/l, P\u2009=\u20090.0056).

Paired paraffin embedded pre- and post-statin treatment tumor samples were analyzed using immunohistochemistry for the expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), and the cell cycle regulators cyclin D1 and p27. Corresponding frozen tumor sample pairs were analyzed for expression of the genes coding for cyclin D1 and p27, CCND1 and CDKN1B, respectively.", 
    "47": "Forty-two patients completed all study parts, and immunohistochemical evaluation of ER and PR was achievable in 30 tumor pairs, HER2 in 29 tumor pairs, cyclin D1 in 30 tumor pairs and p27 in 33 tumor pairs. The expression of ER, PR and HER2 did not change significantly following atorvastatin treatment. Cyclin D1 expression in terms of nuclear intensity was significantly decreased (P\u2009=\u20090.008) after statin treatment in paired tumor samples. The protein expression of the tumor suppressor p27, evaluated either as the fraction of stained tumor cells or as cytoplasmic intensity, increased significantly (P\u2009=\u20090.03 and P\u2009=\u20090.02, respectively). At the transcriptional level, no significant differences in mRNA expression were detected for cyclin D1 (CCND1) and p27 (CDKN1B). However, CCND1 expression was lower in tumors responding to atorvastatin treatment with a decrease in proliferation although not significantly (P\u2009=\u20090.08).",

    "49": "In the recent two decades, data mining methods for signal detection have been developed for drug safety surveillance, using large post-market safety data. Several of these methods assume that the number of reports for each drug-adverse event combination is a Poisson random variable with mean proportional to the unknown reporting rate of the drug-adverse event pair. Here, a Bayesian method based on the Poisson-Dirichlet process (DP) model is proposed for signal detection from large databases, such as the Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) database. Instead of using a parametric distribution as a common prior for the reporting rates, as is the case with existing Bayesian or empirical Bayesian methods, a nonparametric prior, namely, the DP, is used. The precision parameter and the baseline distribution of the DP, which characterize the process, are modeled hierarchically. The performance of the Poisson-DP model is compared with some other models, through an intensive simulation study using a Bayesian model selection and frequentist performance characteristics such as type-I error, false discovery rate, sensitivity, and power. For illustration, the proposed model and its extension to address a large amount of zero counts are used to analyze statin drugs for signals using the 2006-2011 AERS data.",

No significant differences were found between those treated with levetiracetam and those with levetiracetam+simvastatin. Compared with controls, overexpressed calpain-1 was found in the rats 24 h after seizures, which indicates that calpain-1 may be involved in the pathophysiological mechanisms of epilepsy.

In this large, randomised trial, a modest benefit of the combination of simvastatin plus ezetimibe over simvastatin alone was reported after 7 years of treatment. The efficacy of such combination therapy was similar to the efficacy of high-dose statin therapy, while the combination therapy is much more expensive. Comparing the efficacy and costs of different preventive therapies, we recommend first prescribing aspirin and a moderate dose of statin, secondly an ACE inhibitor.

However, even with optimal statin treatment, 60% to 80% of residual cardiovascular risk still exists. The patients with familial hypercholesterolemia which results in extremely high level of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level and the patients who are intolerant or unresponsive to statins are the other hurdles of statin treatment. Recently, new classes of lipid-lowering drugs have been developed and some of them are available for the clinical practice. The pro-protein convertase subtilisin/kexintype 9 (PCSK9) inhibitor increases the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor in hepatocytes by enhancing LDL receptor recycling. The microsomal triglyceride transport protein (MTP) inhibitor and antisense oligonucleotide against apolipoprotein B (ApoB) reduce the ApoB containing lipoprotein by blocking the hepatic very low density lipoprotein synthesis pathway. The apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1) mimetics pursuing the beneficial effect of high density lipoprotein cholesterol and can reverse the course of atherosclerosis. ApoA1 mimetics had many controversial clinical data and need more validation in humans. The PCSK9 inhibitor recently showed promising results of significant LDL-C lowering in familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) patients from the long-term phase III trials. The MTP inhibitor and antisesnse oligonucleotide against ApoB were approved for the treatment of homozygous FH but still needs more consolidated evidences about hepatic safety such as hepatosteatosis.

Patients with PAD experienced a higher CV mortality (5.1%) than the patients with CAD (3.73%) or stroke (4.1%), P < .001. Cardiovascular death ranged from 1.2% for patients with MRFs, 2.8% for patients with 1-bed disease, 4.7% for patients with 2-bed disease to 6.4% for patients with 3-bed disease (P for trend <.001).

    "72": "Myalgia and muscle weakness may appreciably contribute to the poor adherence to statin therapy. Although the pathomechanism of statin-induced myopathy is not completely understood, changes in calcium homeostasis and reduced coenzyme Q10 levels are hypothesized to play important roles. In our experiments, fluvastatin and/or coenzyme Q10 was administered chronically to normocholesterolaemic or hypercholaestherolaemic rats, and the modifications of the calcium homeostasis and the strength of their muscles were investigated. While hypercholesterolaemia did not change the frequency of sparks, fluvastatin increased it on muscles both from normocholesterolaemic and from hypercholesterolaemic rats. This effect, however, was not mediated by a chronic modification of the ryanodine receptor as shown by the unchanged ryanodine binding in the latter group. While coenzyme Q10 supplementation significantly reduced the frequency of the spontaneous calcium release events, it did not affect their amplitude and spatial spread in muscles from fluvastatin-treated rats. This indicates that coenzyme Q10 supplementation prevented the spark frequency increasing effect of fluvastatin without having a major effect on the amount of calcium released during individual sparks. In conclusion, we have found that fluvastatin, independently of the cholesterol level in the blood, consistently and specifically increased the frequency of calcium sparks in skeletal muscle cells, an effect which could be prevented by the addition of coenzyme Q10 to the diet. These results support theories favouring the role of calcium handling in the pathophysiology of statin-induced myopathy and provide a possible pathway for the protective effect of coenzyme Q10 in statin treated patients symptomatic of this condition.",

In this study, roles of NO in water stress-induced tanshinone production in Salvia miltiorrhiza hairy roots were investigated. The results showed that accumulations of four tanshinone compounds in S. miltiorrhiza hairy roots were significantly stimulated by sodium nitroprusside (SNP, a NO donor) at 100 \u03bcM. Effects of SNP were just partially arrested by the mevalonate (MVA) pathway inhibitor (mevinolin), but were completely inhibited by the 2-C-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate pathway (MEP) inhibitor (fosmidomycin). The increase of tanshinone accumulation and the up-regulation of HMGR and DXR expression by PEG and ABA treatments were partially inhibited by an inhibitor of NO biosynthesis (N\u03c9-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME)) and a NO scavenger (2-(4-Carboxyphenyl)- 4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (c-PTIO)). Simultaneously, NO generation in the hairy roots was triggered by PEG and ABA, and the effects were also arrested by c-PTIO and L-NAME. These results indicated that NO signaling probably plays a central role in water stress-induced tanshinone production in S. miltiorrhiza hairy roots. SNP mainly stimulated the MEP pathway to increase tanshinone accumulation.",

Ezetimibe+simvastatin vs. simvastatin alone showed a stronger tendency towards a higher risk for all-cause death (2.52; 0.65-9.74), CV death (3.04; 0.48-19.21), non-CV death (3.03; 0.12-73.50), MI (1.91; 0.42-8.70), stroke (2.38; 0.46-12.35), cancer (RR 11.11; 0.62-198.29), and SAEs (1.45; 0.95-2.23). Limitations include small numbers of events and inadequate power of the pooling. Trials comparing Ezetimibe+simvastatin vs placebo showed non-significant effects: MI (0.81; 0.66-1.00 p = 0.051), all-cause death (1.02; 0.95-1.09), CV death (0.91; 0.80-1.04), non-CV death (108; 0.99-1.18), stroke (0.86; 0.72-1.04), cancer (1.18; 0.80-1.74), SAEs (1.01; 0.96-1.06).",

Effect of paroxetine on pravastatin excretion via bile, intestine, feces and urine, as well as pravastatin absorption via intestine was documented. Freshly isolated hepatocytes and Caco-2 cells were used to investigate the effect of paroxetine on pravastatin transport. 3.\u2002Paroxetine increased the systemic exposure of pravastatin and decreased hepatic distribution of pravastatin in diabetic rats. In vitro, paroxetine inhibited the hepatic uptake of pravastatin and promoted the efflux of pravastatin in freshly isolated hepatocytes, which may partly explain the decreased hepatic distribution of pravastatin by paroxetine. It was also observed that paroxetine promoted the absorption of pravastatin via jejunum and the uptake of pravastatin in Caco-2 cells. 4.\u2002We concluded that paroxetine increased the systemic exposure of pravastatin partly via promoting absorption via jejunum and inhibiting hepatic uptake of pravastatin.", 
    "113": "High levels of plasma triglycerides (TG) are a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, often associated with anomalies in other lipids or lipoproteins. Hypertriglyceridemia (HTG), particularly at very high levels, significantly increases also the risk of acute pancreatitis. Thus, interventions to lower TG levels are required to reduce the risk of pancreatitis and cardiovascular disease. Several strategies may be adopted for TG reduction, including lifestyle changes and pharmacological interventions. Among the available drugs, the most commonly used for HTG are fibrates, nicotinic acid, and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (usually a mixture of eicosapentaenoic acid, or EPA, and docosahexaenoic acid, or DHA). These last are available under different concentrated formulations containing high amounts of omega-3 fatty acids, including a mixture of EPA and DHA or pure EPA. The most recent formulation contains a free fatty acid (FFA) form of EPA and DHA, and exhibits a significantly higher bioavailability compared with the ethyl ester forms contained in the other formulations. This is due to the fact that the ethyl ester forms, to be absorbed, need to be hydrolyzed by the pancreatic enzymes that are secreted in response to fat intake, while the FFA do not. This higher bioavailability translates into a higher TG-lowering efficacy compared with the ethyl ester forms at equivalent doses. Omega-3 FFA are effective in reducing TG levels and other lipids in hypertriglyceridemic patients as well as in high cardiovascular risk patients treated with statins and residual HTG. Currently, omega-3 FFA formulation is under evaluation to establish whether, in high cardiovascular risk subjects, the addition of omega-3 to statin therapy may prevent or reduce major cardiovascular events.",

Relative variability (CV=SD/mean) was lower for ezetimibe\u00a0+\u00a0statins versus statin therapy for all study types, being more pronounced in second-line add-on and uptitrate studies, attributed to larger mean LDL-C reductions for ezetimibe\u00a0+\u00a0statins versus statin groups.

They are generally well-tolerated, but myopathy is a potentially severe adverse reaction of these compounds. The mechanisms by which statins induce myotoxicity are not completely understood, but may be related to inhibition of the AKT signaling pathway. The current studies were performed to explore the down-stream effects of the statin-associated inhibition of AKT within the AKT signaling pathway and on myocyte biology and morphology in C2C12 myotubes and in mice in vivo. We exposed C2C12 myotubes to 10 \u03bcM or 50 \u03bcM simvastatin, atorvastatin or rosuvastatin for 24 h. Simvastatin and atorvastatin inhibited AKT phosphorylation and were cytotoxic starting at 10 \u03bcM, whereas similar effects were observed for rosuvastatin at 50 \u03bcM. Inhibition of AKT phosphorylation was associated with impaired phosphorylation of S6 kinase, ribosomal protein S6, 4E-binding protein 1 and FoxO3a, resulting in reduced protein synthesis, accelerated myofibrillar degradation and atrophy of C2C12 myotubes. Furthermore, impaired AKT phosphorylation was associated with activation of caspases and PARP, reflecting induction of apoptosis. Similar findings were detected in skeletal muscle of mice treated orally with 5 mg/kg/day simvastatin for 3 weeks. In conclusion, this study highlights the importance of the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in statin-induced myotoxicity and reveals potential drug targets for treatment of patients with statin-associated myopathies.",

However, crucial questions still need to be addressed as far as the timing of their cerebral effects after intravascular administration and the role played by the blood brain barrier (BBB) crossing properties. We tested the effects of an hydrophilic statin (pravastatin, 100 nM), which poorly crosses BBB under physiological conditions. Pravastatin was administered either 90 min before or immediately after transient middle cerebral artery occlusion in the in vitro isolated guinea pig brain preparation. A multi-modal outcome assessment was performed, through electrophysiological and cerebral vascular tone recordings, MAP-2 immunohistochemistry, BBB evaluation via ZO-1/FITC-albumin analysis, AKT and ERK activation and whole-cell antioxidant capacity. Pravastatin pre-ischemic administration did not produce any significant effect. Pravastatin post-ischemic administration significantly prevented MAP-2 immunoreactivity loss in ischemic areas, increased ERK phosphorylation in the ischemic hemisphere and enhanced whole-cell antioxidant capacity. Electrophysiological parameters, vascular tone and AKT signaling were unchanged. In all tested ischemic brains, ZO-1 fragmentation and FITC albumin extravasation was observed, starting 30 min from ischemia onset, indicating loss of BBB integrity. Our findings indicate that the rapid anti-ischemic effects of intravascular pravastatin are highly dependent on BBB increased permeability after stroke.",

This benefit is presumed to result from atherogenic cholesterol lowering through multiple modalities, including lifestyle and drug therapies; (3) the intensity of risk-reduction therapy should generally be adjusted to the patient's absolute risk for an ASCVD event; (4) atherosclerosis is a process that often begins early in life and progresses for decades before resulting a clinical ASCVD event. Therefore, both intermediate-term and long-term or lifetime risk should be considered when assessing the potential benefits and hazards of risk-reduction therapies; (5) for patients in whom lipid-lowering drug therapy is indicated, statin treatment is the primary modality for reducing ASCVD risk; (6) nonlipid ASCVD risk factors should also be managed appropriately, particularly high blood pressure, cigarette smoking, and diabetes mellitus; and (7) the measurement and monitoring of atherogenic cholesterol levels remain an important part of a comprehensive ASCVD prevention strategy.",

We found OATP1A2 mRNA expression in the human brain to be comparable to breast cancer resistance protein and OATP2B1 and much higher than P-glycoprotein (P-gp), and confirmed greater expression in the brain relative to other tissues. The goal of this study was to establish a model system to explore OATP1A2-mediated transcellular transport of substrate drugs and the interplay with P-gp. In vitro (human embryonic kidney 293 cells stably expressing Oatp1a4, the closest murine isoform) and in vivo (na\u00efve and Oatp1a4 knock-out mice) studies with OATP1A2 substrate triptan drugs demonstrated that these drugs were not Oatp1a4 substrates. This species difference demonstrates that the rodent is not a good model to investigate the active brain uptake of potential OATP1A2 substrates. Thus, we constructed a novel OATP1A2 expressing Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) II wild type and an MDCKII-multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) system using BacMam virus transduction. The spatial expression pattern of OATP1A2 after transduction in MDCKII-MDR1 cells was superimposed to P-gp, confirming apical membrane localization. OATP1A2-mediated uptake of zolmitriptan, rosuvastatin, and fexofenadine across monolayers increased with increasing OATP1A2 protein expression. OATP1A2 counteracted P-gp efflux for cosubstrates zolmitriptan and fexofenadine.

Pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors, viral replication, and antiviral treatments all contribute to this accelerated and increased risk for cardiovascular disease in HIV-infected subjects. Given this risk and the proven benefit of statins reducing cardiovascular events across numerous patient groups, statin therapy might be particularly beneficial for patients with HIV. However, safety concerns and a dearth of quality trial data evaluating clinical outcomes in HIV-infected patients on simultaneous antiretroviral therapy (ART) and statin therapy have likely limited statin use in HIV-infected patients chronically taking ART. We performed a systematic review evaluating 18 clinical trials of statins in HIV-infected subjects receiving ART. Simvastatin is contraindicated in the setting of protease inhibitor use because of toxic drug-drug interactions when the 2 drugs are taken concomitantly. Meanwhile, atorvastatin appears to be relatively safe at submaximal doses if monitored. Pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and pitavastatin appear to have the most benign safety profiles among statins when co-administered with ART and may not require dose adjustment. In conclusion, clinicians should be mindful of the elevated risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in HIV-infected patients when assessing the need for lifestyle interventions and statin therapy.",

Most adverse effects associated with statin therapy are muscle-related. The recent statement of the European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) has focused on statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS), and avoided the use of the term 'statin intolerance'. Although muscle syndromes are the most common adverse effects observed after statin therapy, excluding other side effects might underestimate the number of patients with statin intolerance, which might be observed in 10 - 15% of patients. In clinical practice, statin intolerance limits effective treatment of patients at risk of, or with, cardiovascular disease. Knowledge of the most common adverse effects of statin therapy that might cause statin intolerance and the clear definition of this phenomenon is crucial to effectively treat patients with lipid disorders. Therefore, the aim of this position paper was to suggest a unified definition of statin intolerance, and to complement the recent EAS statement on SAMS, where the pathophysiology, diagnosis and the management were comprehensively presented.",

In patients with Type 1 diabetes, intensive glycemic control results in a reduction in cardiovascular disease. However, intensive glycemic control does not have a major impact in reducing cardiovascular disease in patients with Type 2 diabetes. Metformin, pioglitazone, empagliflozin, and certain GLP-1 receptor agonists have been shown to decrease cardiovascular disease in patients with Type 2 diabetes to a greater extent than other treatment modalities. In patients with Type 2 diabetes other risk factors including, hypertension and dyslipidemia, play a major role in inducing cardiovascular disease, and control of these risk factors is paramount. In patients with Type 1 diabetes in good glycemic control, the lipid profile is very similar to the general population. In contrast, in patients with Type 2 diabetes, even with good glycemic control there are frequently lipid abnormalities (elevated triglycerides and non-HDL cholesterol, decreased HDL cholesterol, and an increase in small dense LDL). In both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, poor glycemic control increases triglyceride levels and decreases HDL cholesterol levels with only modest effects on LDL cholesterol levels. Extensive studies have demonstrated that statins decrease cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes. Treatment with high doses of potent statins reduces cardiovascular events to a greater extent than low dose statin therapy. Adding fibrates or niacin to statin therapy has not been shown to further decrease cardiovascular events. In contrast, a recent study has shown that the combination of a statin and ezetimibe does result in a greater decrease in cardiovascular events than statins alone. Current recommendations indicate that most patients with diabetes should be on statin therapy.

We hypothesized that SNPs within the BUD13-APOA5 region are associated with TG, HDL-C, and LDL-C response to statin therapy. We examined 1520 observations for 1086 patients from the Personalized Medicine Research Project, a large biorepository at the Marshfield Clinic Research Foundation, who had received statin therapy and been previously genotyped for polymorphisms in the 11q23 chromosomal region. A significant differential response to statin therapy was observed for 3 SNPs.

Because there is no hyperlipidemia-related medication reference in modern TCM classics, to ensure the high safety and efficacy of all selected TCMs, we selected TCMs that are proved to be combined with statins in the World Traditional/Natural Medicine Patent Database, analyzed corresponding drugs in pharmacophore results based on that, and finally obtained common TCMs that can be applied in PPAR-\u03b1 and combined with statins. Specifically, the pharmacophore model was based on eight receptor-ligand complexes of PPAR-\u03b1.

Subsequent conditional analyses suggest that three of these (APOE, LPA and CETP) likely harbor multiple independently associated SNPs. Further, while different variants typically showed different characteristic patterns of association with combinations of subfractions, the two SNPs in CETP show strikingly similar patterns--both in our original data and in a replication cohort--consistent with a common underlying molecular mechanism. Notably, the CETP variants are very strongly associated with LDL subfractions, despite showing no association with total LDLs in our study, illustrating the potential value of the more detailed phenotypic measurements. In contrast with these strong subfraction associations, genetic association analysis of subfraction response to statins showed much weaker signals (none exceeding log(10)Bayes Factor of 6). However, two SNPs (in APOE and LPA) previously-reported to be associated with LDL statin response do show some modest evidence for association in our data, and the subfraction response proles at the LPA SNP are consistent with the LPA association, with response likely being due primarily to resistance of Lp(a) particles to statin therapy. An additional important feature of our analysis is that, unlike most previous analyses of multiple related phenotypes, we analyzed the subfractions jointly, rather than one at a time. Comparisons of our multivariate analyses with standard univariate analyses demonstrate that multivariate analyses can substantially increase power to detect associations.

    "207": "The idea that atheroma can regress is no longer a dream. We and others have discovered that decreasing the lipid content can directly lead to macrophage egress and plaque healing. The question, however, has remained as to how to translate these findings to the bedside. Taking advantage of imaging modalities such as intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), we demonstrated in the YELLOW (Reduction in Yellow Plaque by Intensive Lipid Lowering Therapy) trial that short term treatment of high dose rosuvastatin treatment can lead to a decrease in lipid content in plaques. It is important to note that optical coherence tomography (OCT), a high resolution imaging modality, was not performed during the first study and therefore, only a very limited assessment of the effect of statin therapy on measures of plaque stabilization could be made. The YELLOW II trial is the first to our knowledge to determine whether these data can be extrapolated and how it relates to HDL function, alterations in macrophage gene expression, and plaque morphology. While tremendous progress has been made, our research serves as a reminder that angiography is simply luminography and it is features such as thin cap fibroatheroma and lipid burden, for example, that likely modulate the syndromes seen in clinical practice. Ongoing studies such as ours may provide novel pathways for diagnosis and therapy, with the ultimate goal of reducing the burden of cardiovascular disease.",

    "209": "Systematic literature review and meta-analysis. Medline and EMBASE were searched until November 2014. We selected randomized studies in which RYR with a known content of the active substance monacolin K was tested against placebo or an active control group. Outcome measures were the effect of RYR on LDL cholesterol and incidence of adverse reactions with emphasis on liver and kidney injury and muscle symptoms.", 
    "210": "Twenty studies were analyzed. Quality of safety assessment was low in the majority of studies. RYR lowered LDL cholesterol with 1.02\u00a0mmol/L [-1.20;\u00a0-0.83] compared to placebo. Effect of RYR on LDL was not different from statin therapy (0.03\u00a0mmol/L [-0.36; 0.41]). The incidence of liver and kidney injury was 0-5% and the risk was not different between treatment and control groups (risk difference\u00a0-0.01 [-0.01; 0.0] and 0.0 [-0.01; 0.02]).", 
    "211": "RYR exerts a clinically and statistically significant reduction of 1.02\u00a0mmol/L LDL cholesterol. Only when the mild profile of adverse reactions can be affirmed in studies with adequate methodology for safety assessment, RYR might be a safe and effective treatment option for dyslipidemia and cardiovascular risk reduction in statin intolerant patients.", 
    "212": "Little is known about clinically driven percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) rates and predictors for progression of nontarget lesions in diabetic patients who have undergone drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical and angiographic data of 2187 diabetic patients undergoing DES implantation. The cumulative rate of nontarget lesion PCI was 6.3% at 1 year, 14.3% at 2 years, and 19.8% at 3 years. The independent predictors of need for clinically driven PCI in patients with diabetes mellitus after DES implantation included obesity (odds ratio [OR] 2.303, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.657-3.199, P < .001), low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (OR 1.412, 95% CI 1.114-1.789, P = .004), statin use (OR 0.669, 95% CI 0.454-0.986, P = .042), insulin use (OR 1.310, 95% CI 1.030-1.665, P = .027), and Synergy Between PCI With Taxus and Cardiac Surgery (SYNTAX) score (OR 1.061, 95% CI 1.045-1.077, P < .001) at baseline PCI. These findings may facilitate prediction of the risk of repeat revascularization and improve repeat revascularization rates in diabetic patients after DES implantation.", 
    "213": "The increase in proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) leads to low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor degradation. Statins significantly reduce LDL-cholesterol levels, but upregulate PCSK9. This study evaluated the effect of ezetimibe monotherapy or ezetimibe in combination with a statin on serum levels of PCSK9 in patients with type 2 diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "214": "Ezetimibe treatment was given to ten patients with diabetes without statin therapy and ten patients with statin therapy. Plasma levels of PCSK9 were examined at baseline and 24\u00a0weeks after treatment.", 
    "215": "At baseline, PCSK9 concentrations in patients with statin therapy were significantly higher than those in patients without statin use and in control subjects [median (25th-75th percentile) 411 (272-467) and 382 (356-453) ng/mL, respectively, p\u00a0<\u00a00.01]. After ezetimibe treatment for 24\u00a0weeks, LDL-cholesterol, triglyceride and remnant-like lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly decreased in both groups. However, PCSK9 concentration did not change compared with baseline measurements in both groups. The percentage change in LDL-cholesterol after ezetimibe therapy for 24\u00a0weeks was not correlated with the percentage change in PCSK9 concentration.",

    "217": "Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is a lysosomal storage disease caused by a functional deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme arylsulfatase A. The prevailing late-infantile variant of MLD is characterized by widespread and progressive demyelination of the central nervous system (CNS) causing death during childhood. In order to gain insight into the pathomechanism of the disease and to identify novel therapeutic targets, we analyzed neuroinflammation in two mouse models reproducing a mild, nondemyelinating, and a more severe, demyelinating, variant of MLD, respectively. Microgliosis and upregulation of cytokine/chemokine levels were clearly more pronounced in the demyelinating model. The analysis of the temporal cytokine/chemokine profiles revealed that the onset of demyelination is preceded by a sustained elevation of the macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1\u03b1 followed by an upregulation of MIP-1\u03b2, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, and several interleukins. The tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 remains unchanged. Treatment of the demyelinating mouse model with the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug simvastatin reduced neuroinflammation, improved the swimming performance and ataxic gait, and retarded demyelination of the spinal cord. Our data suggest that neuroinflammation is causative for demyelination in MLD mice and that anti-inflammatory treatment might be a novel therapeutic option to improve the CNS function of MLD patients.",
