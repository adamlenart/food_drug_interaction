Recently, it has been suggested that statins could be beneficial to AD patients independently from their cholesterol-lowering effects. Using 10 month-old amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice (APP mice), we sought to reverse cerebrovascular, neuronal and memory impairments with simvastatin (20 mg/kg/day, 8 weeks). Simvastatin improved reactivity of cerebral arteries, rescued the blood flow response to neuronal activation, attenuated oxidative stress and inflammation, and reduced cortical soluble amyloid-beta (Abeta) levels and the number of Abeta plaque-related dystrophic neurites. However, at such an advanced stage of the pathology, it failed to reduce Abeta plaque load and normalize cholinergic and memory deficits. These findings demonstrate that low-dose simvastatin treatment in aged APP mice largely salvages cerebrovascular function and has benefits on several AD landmarks, which could explain some of the positive effects of statins reported in AD patients.", 
    "1": "The progression of atherosclerosis following coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery results in the need for re-vascularisation therapy in a significant proportion of patients. It is well recognised that this risk can be lowered by controlling the level of low-density lipid cholesterol (LDL-C) which can be achieved easily and safely with the use of statins. The choice of which is the best statin in post-CABG patients remains unclear. It has been shown that for milligram-equivalent doses, rosuvastatin provides the greatest LDL-C reduction and greatest number of patients achieving LDL-C targets in comparison with simvastatin and atorvastatin. Rosuvastatin's superiority over other statins in allowing patients to reach LDL-C targets has been maintained in 'real-world' observational studies. Rosuvastatin has also been shown to increase high-density lipid cholesterol (HDL-C) by greater proportions in comparison with other statins, providing increased anti-atherogenic effects. There are several statins currently available, some of which are now generic. However, the empirical use of generic statins does not necessarily translate into a cost-effective treatment option. This article reviews the rationale for lipid-lowering therapy in patients following CABG. We also look objectively at which is the best statin for use in the post-CABG patient, discussing effectiveness, cost and tolerability.", 
    "2": "Redox factor-1 (Ref-1), a multifunctional protein with DNA repairing activities, plays a cytoprotective function by post-translational redox modification of numerous transcription factors, including hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). In the present study, activation of HIF-1 by hypoxia and dimethyloxaloylglycine (DMOG), a hypoxia mimic, diminished Ref-1 mRNA and protein expression in human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1). Similarly, adenoviral delivery of the stabilized form of HIF-1alpha decreased Ref-1 mRNA and protein levels. Accordingly, HIF-1alpha siRNA abolished the hypoxia-induced inhibition of Ref-1 expression, indicating the role of HIF-1 in down-regulation of Ref-1. Also, translocation of Ref-1 from nucleus to cytoplasm after HIF-1 activation was noted. Interestingly, we observed the restoration of Ref-1 expression in hypoxia by pharmacologically relevant doses of atorvastatin. This effect was dependent on the inhibition of protein geranylgeranylation, but not farnesylation, as only the inhibitor of the former but not the latter prenylation step restored the Ref-1 expression. The regulation of Ref-1 by statins may be considered as a novel mechanism of their beneficial effects on endothelium.",

    "5": "Our results show that DADS analogs are effective in reducing the total lipid levels which could be correlated with a significant decrease in 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGR) activity. DADS analogs strongly inhibit HMGR activity in vivo but not in vitro. These results can be attributed to the significant decrease in the mRNA levels and protein expression of HMGR. Further, we show that DADS analogs significantly inhibited the activation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein-2 (SREBP-2) and interfered with DNA binding activity of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) but not nuclear factor-Y (NF-Y), with upstream regulatory sequences of HMGR. Moreover, DADS analogs are also effective in reducing the levels of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL), lipid peroxidation as well as NF-kappaB activity, showing good anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties.",

In cellular and molecular studies on human vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) we have reported that transformation from a differentiated to a synthetic or dedifferentiated phenotype is associated with loss of function of L-type calcium channels and hence loss of potential responsiveness to calcium channel blockers (CCB). Statins directly inhibit cell cycle progression and dedifferentiation of VSMC due to their ability to inhibit the synthesis of isoprenoid cholesterol intermediates. We hypothesize that statins promote a more differentiated VSMC phenotype that results in upregulation of L-type calcium channels and restoration of a CCB-sensitive calcium influx pathway in VSMC, favourably affecting the balance that exists between VSMC proliferation, apoptosis and matrix metalloproteinase production with an associated increase in stability of atheromatous plaques.",

    "12": "The chemokine receptor CCR5 has been shown to be targeted to cholesterol- and sphingolipid-rich membrane microdomains. Here we elucidate the effects of membrane fluidity on CCR5 signalling and expression using the monocytic THP-1 cells. MCD treatment of THP-1 cells, which removes nearly all cholesterol from the plasma membrane, leads to an increase in the signalling properties of CCR5. In contrast, the prevention of cholesterol production with lovastatin and simvastatin decreases the release of intracellular calcium and also decreases receptor cell surface expression. The loss of response in lovastatin treated cells can be rescued by MCD addition, which shows that the cholesterol content in the membrane is only one factor in determining the amount of receptor response. We show that CCR5 signalling is dependent on thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ stores and on activation of ryanodine receptors as well as InsP3 receptors or store-operated channels. Cholesterol depletion with MCD changes the thapsigargin sensitivity in THP-1 cells and also alters receptor-G-protein coupling towards pertussis toxin (PTX) independent G-proteins. Cholesterol removal by MCD in THP-1 cells has far reaching consequences for receptor activation and signalling and emphasises the need for a clearer understanding of how membrane fluidity affects receptor signalling events.",

Analyses of cardiovascular morbidity in relationship to changes in blood pressure and in serum cholesterol levels have shown that combined reduction of both risk factors are important to achieve a reduction in morbidity. Statins have been shown to be effective in preventing both coronary and cerebrovascular events in both hypertensive and normotensive cases.

When D. salina was grown under carotenogenic and non-carotenogenic conditions, mevinolin did not inhibit growth or the accumulation of carotenoids, beta-carotene or chlorophyll. In contrast, fosmidomycin progressively inhibited cell growth and the biosynthesis of carotenoids, beta-carotene and chlorophyll. In this work, we reported for the first time that in D. salina, beta-carotene biosynthesis does not proceed via the classical acetate/mevalonate pathway but via the novel glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate/pyruvate pathway. This favours the yield of C(5) isoprenoid units for synthesis of isopentenyl diphosphate, the precursor in the biosynthesis of C(20) compounds, including geranylgeranyl diphosphate. Consequently, this pathway promotes carotenogenesis and the biosynthesis of C(40) beta-carotene in D. salina.",

The ratio apoB/apoA(1) was uncorrelated with time since symptom onset in cases, was reproducible in samples collected a few years apart in controls (correlation 0.81), and encapsulated almost all the predictive power of these four measurements. Its effect was continuous, substantial throughout the UK normal range [relative risk, top vs. bottom decile of this ratio, 7.3 (95% CI 5.8-9.2)] and varied little with age. The ratio apoB/apoA(1) was substantially more informative about risk (chi(1)(2) = 550) than were commonly used measures such as LDL-C/HDL-C, total/HDL cholesterol, non-HDL cholesterol, and total cholesterol (chi(1)(2) = 407, 334, 204, and 105, respectively). Given apoB and apoA(1), the relationship with risk of LDL-C was reversed, and this reversal was strengthened by appropriate allowance for random measurement errors in two correlated variables. Given usual apoB, lower LDL-C (consistent with smaller LDL particles) was associated with higher risk (P < 0.0001). During the first 8 h after symptom onset HDL-C increased by about 10%, precluding reliable assessment of the joint relationship of apoA(1) and pre-onset HDL-C with risk in such retrospective case-control studies.",

This association further supports a responsible role for inflammatory processes in all stages of CVD pathophysiology. Clinically, CVD ranges through different acute and chronic syndromes with ischemic symptoms in distal tissues, including heart, cerebral region or peripheral arteries.

We examined the use of potentially cardioprotective medications in a prospective observational study at seven transplant centers in the United States and Canada. Among 935 patients, 87% received antihypertensive medications at both 1 and 6 months after transplantation. Similar antihypertensive regimens were used for patients with and without diabetes and CVD, but with wide variability among centers. In contrast, while 44% of patients were on angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) at the time of transplantation, the proportion taking these agents dropped to 12% at month 1, then increased to 24% at 6 months. Fewer than 30% with CVD or diabetes received ACEI/ARB therapy 6 months posttransplant. Aspirin use was uncommon (<40% of patients). Even among those with diabetes and/or CVD, fewer than 60% received aspirin and only half received a statin at 1 and 6 months. This study demonstrates marked variability in the use of cardioprotective medications in kidney transplant recipients, a finding that may reflect, among several possible explanations, clinical uncertainty due the lack of randomized trials for these medications in this population.", 
    "40": "It is now widely accepted that redox signaling is a key feature in vascular homeostasis. Reactive oxygen species are generated by a wide range of enzymatic systems located in both vascular endothelium and vascular wall. Further, to their role as cytotoxic molecules produced by immune system, free radicals play critical signaling roles in the vascular wall. By regulating several redox-sensitive transcription pathways, free radicals play a key role in the synthesis of inflammatory mediators in both vascular endothelium and vascular wall, with important role in the overall vascular dysfunction. The well-established role of redox state in vascular disease mandates that development of newer therapeutic strategies should be able to alter redox-sensitive intracellular signaling events. Widely used cardiovascular agents like statins or angiotensin receptor blockers have well documented beneficial effects on vascular redox state, reflected also in clinical outcome improvement. Newer promising strategies along with recent patented inventions may also include thiazolidinediones, folates, tetrahydrobiopterin, cyclopentone prostaglandins and aldose reductase inhibitors with well known effects on vascular redox, but with still unclear results on clinical outcome. Better understanding of redox-sensitive intracellular signaling pathways could indicate the critical steps to intervene with newer agents to reverse vascular dysfunction, inhibiting atherosclerosis progression and potentially improve clinical outcome.",

    "43": "Inhibitors of isoprenoid biosynthesis are widely used to treat human disease including statins and nitrogenous bisphosphonates. Due to the importance of core human isoprenoid biosynthesis for diverse cellular processes related to cancer cell growth and metastasis, inhibition of this pathway may produce beneficial anticancer consequences. For example, ras oncogenes are well known; ras proteins are overexpressed in many human cancers, and these proteins must be isoprenylated to function. The rho proteins are important for regulating cell motility, and also must be isoprenylated. This has drawn significant attention to inhibitors of protein prenyl transferases. In addition to the reactions that are targeted in current clinical applications, there are other enzymes that have not been studied as extensively. Inhibition of these enzymes, from mevalonate kinase to geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase, could be attractive as a single agent therapy or in combination with current agents for treatment of cancers in which isoprenylated proteins have been implicated. While detailed in vivo data for many of these putative targets is lacking, there have been several breakthroughs in recent years that could facilitate further studies. In particular, compounds that specifically inhibit some of the downstream isoprenoid biosynthesis enzymes have been developed and their effects in cancer models are emerging. This review will discuss current knowledge of these lesser known isoprenoid pathway enzymes, identify trends in the development of their small molecule inhibitors, and describe the applications and effects of these compounds in cancer models.",

Despite the importance of the water channel, however, previous findings vary widely when it concerns AQP2 of the kidneys in subjects with cirrhosis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression of AQP2 in the distal renal tubule in cirrhosis, and the presence of the nitric oxide-AQP2 signaling pathway as a possible vasopressin-aquaporin-independent pathway. Sixty male Wister rats were assigned to six groups: (1) control; (2) TAA (thioacetamide); (3) TAA with nitric oxide donor; (4) TAA with nitric oxide inhibitor; (5) TAA with HMG CoA reductase inhibitor; (6) TAA with tetrahydrobiopterin. Immunohistochemical staining for AQP2, real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for AQP2 and 3, citrulline assay, and renal cGMP concentration were measured. The AQP2-positivity of cirrhotic rats were higher than the controls (P < 0.05). The AQP2-positivity decreased in the nitric oxide donor group, but the proportion rose back up when the subjects were injected with the nitric oxide inhibitor (P < 0.05). The expression of AQP2 and AQP3 mRNA was also found to show an increase in the cirrhotic group as compared with the normal controls (P < 0.05). The cirrhotic group administered with nitric oxide donor showed a significant decline in the expression of the mRNA. The control group's cGMP concentration was lower than that of the cirrhotic group (P < 0.05), but a comparison of the two groups injected with nitric oxide modulators, such as statin and BH4, did not show significant differences in the cGMP concentration level. The expression of AQP2 of the kidneys increased in the cirrhotic rats. AQP2 had relations to the activity changes of nitric oxide synthetase.",

The aim of the present study was to investigate Homer 1a expression in hypertrophic cardiac cells and its role in angiotensin (Ang) II-induced cardiac hypertrophy. 2. After serum starvation for 24 h, cells were treated with 1 micromol/L simvastatin, 100 nmol/L angiotensin (Ang) II or their combination added to Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% serum. For combination treatment with AngII plus simvastatin, cells were exposed to simvastatin 12 h before the addition of AngII to the medium and cells were then incubated in the presence of both drugs for a further 24 h. Western blotting was used to determine Homer 1a protein expression. Hypertrophy was evaluated by determining the protein content per cell. 3. Homer 1a protein levels were upregulated following AngII-induced hypertrophy in H9C2 cells and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, and these increases were augmented by simvastatin pretreatment. Concomitantly, simvastatin pretreatment inhibited extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 phosphorylation and AngII-induced hypertrophy. 4. The inhibitory effects of simvastatin against AngII-induced hypertrophy were attenuated by Homer 1a silencing, suggesting that simvastatin suppresses cardiac hypertrophy in a Homer 1a-dependent manner. Furthermore, AngII-induced hypertrophy and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes were significantly inhibited following the overexpression of Homer 1a using an adenovirus. 5. These results suggest a possible role for Homer 1a in inhibiting cardiac hypertrophy perhaps in part through inhibition of ERK1/2 activation.",

The mechanism by which these effects occur has not yet been determined. In the present study, lova is shown to enhance the genotoxicity of dox in the V79 cell in vitro micronucleus assay and to do so, most likely, via noncovalent interaction with DNA adjacent to sites of dox binding. These studies confirm and extend the experimental evidence strongly suggesting the importance of noncovalent drug/DNA interactions in cellular responses to genotoxic stimuli.",

Recent studies suggested that statins, besides lowering cholesterol, may protect vessels by enhancing the activity of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). In the present study, we investigated if simvastatin increases eNOS activity through its phosphorylation in 293 cells (293-eNOS) with stable expression of eNOS. The results showed that incubation of 293-eNOS cells with simvastatin (10 microm/L) for 2 h significantly increased in the activity of eNOS as shown by the conversion of L-arginine to L-citrulline (2889.70+/-201.51 versus 5630.18+/-218.75 pmol/min . mg proteins) (P<0.01). Western blotting revealed that simvastatin increased phosphorylation of eNOS at 1177 (ser) and also 495 (thr) but did not affect the overall expression of eNOS or inducible NOS. Further study found that simvastatin raised phosphorylation levels of Akt and AMPK, and such effect could be antagonized by Akt inhibitor or AMPK inhibitor. These results suggest that simvastatin could stimulate the activity of eNOS via its phosphorylation by Akt and AMPK, which provides a new mechanism, other than lipid-lowering effect, for the cardiovascular protection of statins.",

Generally, similar results were observed for patients with TG levels <200 and >or=200 mg/dl (2.3 mmol). For both treatments, notable differences between TG subgroups were that patients with elevated TGs had smaller reductions in LDL(2)-C, slightly smaller decreases in all IDL subclasses and greater decreases in all VLDL-C subclasses than those with lower TG levels.

    "57": "The mevalonate pathway is important for the generation of isoprene moieties thereby providing the basis for the biosynthesis of molecules required for maintaining membrane integrity, steroid production and cell respiration. Additionally, isoprene precursors are indispensable for the prenylation of regulatory proteins such as Ras and Ras-homologous (Rho) GTPases. These low molecular GTP-binding proteins play key roles in numerous signal transduction pathways stimulated upon activation of cell surface receptors by ligand binding. Thus, Ras/Rho proteins eventually regulate cell proliferation, tumor progression and cell death induced by anticancer therapeutics. Lipid modification of Ras/Rho proteins at their C-terminal CAAX-box is essential for their correct intracellular localization and function. Therefore, pharmacological inhibition of the isoprene metabolism is anticipated to impact the manifold biological functions attributed to Ras/Rho proteins.

This translates into reduced cardiovascular disease-related morbidity and mortality, while the drugs' anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties have earmarked it as a potential treatment strategy against various neurological conditions. Statins have been shown to protect neurons from degeneration in a number of animal models. Although no mechanism completely explains the multiple benefits exerted by statins, emerging evidence suggests that in some degenerative and brain injury models, mitochondrial impairment may play a contributive rate. However, [corrected] evidence lacks to support a directly influencing role for statins on mitochondria-related proteins and motor behavior. Mitochondrial dysfunction may increase oxygen free radical production, which in turn leaves cells susceptible to energy failure, apoptosis and related events [corrected] which could prove fatal. The potential link between simvastatin treatment and mitochondrial function would be supported if key mitochondrial proteins were altered by simvastatin exposure. Using mass spectroscopy (MS), we identified 24 mitochondrial proteins that differed significantly (P < 0.05) in relative abundancy as a result of simvastatin treatment. The identified proteins represented many facets of mitochondrial integrity, with the majority forming part of the electron transport chain machinery, which is necessary for energy production. In a follow-up study, we then addressed whether simvastatin is capable of altering sensorimotor function in a mitochondrial toxin-induced animal model. Rats were pre-treated with simvastatin for 14 days, followed by a single unihemispheric (substantia nigra; SN) injection of rotenone, a mitochondrial complex I (Co-I) inhibitor. Results showed that simvastatin improved motor performance in rotenone-infused rats.

There is evidence that statins have beneficial effects beyond those of lipid lowering, including reducing the perioperative risk of cardiac complications and sepsis.

Statins appear to have actions on vascular nitric oxide through the balance of inducible and endothelial nitric oxide synthase. The clinical evidence for these benefits is also briefly reviewed with the objective of clarifying the current status of statin use in the perioperative period. There is reasonably strong evidence that patients already taking statins should continue on them perioperatively.

We show that Srd5a2 is induced in livers and prostate from mice fed a chow diet supplemented with lovastatin plus ezitimibe (L/E), which increases the activity of nuclear SREBP-2. The three fold increase in Srd5a2 mRNA mediated by L/E treatment was accompanied by the induction of SREBP-2 binding to the Srd5a2 promoter detected by a ChIP-chip assay in liver. We identified a SREBP-2 responsive region within the first 300 upstream bases of the mouse Srd5a2 promoter by co-transfection assays which contain a site that bound SREBP-2 in vitro by an EMSA. Srd5a2 protein was also induced in cells over-expressing SREBP-2 in culture. The induction of Srd5a2 through SREBP-2 provides a mechanistic explanation for why even though statin therapy is effective in reducing cholesterol levels in treating hypercholesterolemia it does not compromise androgen production in clinical studies.",

The review recaps the results of the primary SPARCL data and discusses the findings of subsequent analyses that extend the conclusions from the study. Atorvastatin reduced the risk of stroke to a clinically persuasive degree. This benefit was present despite a small increase in risk of intracerebral hemorrhage.

The major clinical trials with statins in CKD patients are reviewed along with a discussion of statin safety. Although statin dosing and safety in patients with early CKD (Stage I or II) are similar to those of the general population, dose adjustments are required in advanced CKD (Stages III- V) due to differences in statin pharmacokinetics and renal excretion. Although the use of statins to reduce cardiovascular events in patients with mild to moderate CKD is strongly supported by existing clinical trials, no clinical benefit has been demonstrated in two large clinical trials involving hemodialysis patients.", 
    "97": "Cytoprotective or neuroprotective interventions would be of value if they could block the processes leading to delayed neuronal death or if they could delay the period between the onset of ischemia and irreversible necrotic injury, thereby lengthening the period for effective reperfusion therapy. Experimental studies in cell culture systems and laboratory animals show that statins have several potential cytoprotective actions, including promotion of angiogenesis, reduction of clot formation and facilitation of clot lysis, upregulation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase, downregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase, reduction of excitotoxicity, and modulation of the inflammatory response. Clinically, statins appear to protect against vasospasm-related ischemic injury after subarachnoid hemorrhage. There have been no prospective randomized trials aimed at determining whether statins reduce acute stroke severity, and observational studies have had inconsistent results. Although a prospective, randomized trial assessing the effect of pre- or poststroke statin treatment on initial stroke severity would be the most appropriate study design to test for this type of effect, it is unlikely that such a trial will be conducted given the benefits of these drugs in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events and stroke in high-risk populations.",

Among 17,802 trial participants, rosuvastatin resulted in a 44% reduction in the primary end point of all vascular events (P < 0.00001), a 54% reduction in myocardial infarction (P = 0.0002), a 48% reduction in stroke (P = 0.002), a 46% reduction in need for arterial revascularization (P < 0.001), and a 20% reduction in all-cause mortality (P = 0.02). All subgroups with elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein benefited, including those traditionally considered to be at low risk, such as women, nonsmokers, and those with Framingham risk scores less than 10%. Absolute risk reductions within JUPITER result in a number needed to treat at 5 years of 25, a value comparable or superior to that of other interventions routinely used in primary prevention, including statin therapy among those with hyperlipidemia. Although lifestyle interventions remain critical, the screening and treatment strategy tested in JUPITER is likely to impact on new guidelines for cardiovascular disease prevention.", 
    "99": "Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has become an established treatment for some patients with malignant and non-malignant hematologic diseases. More wide-spread use of this treatment modality is limited by its severe side effects. Graft-versus-host disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality following allogeneic stem transplantation. Recent data from experimental research in murine models of GVHD and early stage clinical studies demonstrate the potential of statins in the prevention and treatment of acute and chronic GVHD. Statins are lipid lowering drugs, which reduce cholesterol production by inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase, the rate limiting enzyme of the mevalonate pathway. They are an already approved drug class with a well known toxicity profile. Besides lowering of cholesterol levels other pleiotropic effects contribute to the therapeutic activity of statins. Statins have immunomodulatory effects and inhibit a broad range of immune cells that play a role in the pathogenesis of GVHD, including antigen-presenting cells. In addition to preventing GVHD statins possess several other effects that might prove beneficial in the setting of allogeneic transplantation, such as cardiovascular protection and anti-neoplastic activity. Here we review the current knowledge on the use and effects of statins in patients who undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with a special focus on prevention and treatment of GVHD.", 
    "100": "Statins exert pleiotropic effects on the cardiovascular system, in part through an increase in nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. In this study, we examined the role of pravastatin in ischemia-induced angiogenesis. Unilateral hindlimb ischemia was surgically induced in C57BL/6J mice. Phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) was increased in ischemic tissues. Furthermore, mice treated with pravastatin showed higher increases in phosphorylation than did untreated mice. Laser Doppler analysis has shown that pravastatin treatment accelerates the development of collateral vessels and angiogenesis in response to hindlimb ischemia. Capillary density in the ischemic hindlimb was also increased by pravastatin treatment. An in vitro study on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) revealed that pravastatin increased the phosphorylation of AMPK. Pravastatin-induced phosphorylation of eNOS, one of the downstreams of AMPK, was inhibited by compound C, an AMPK antagonist. The increased migration and tube formation of HUVECs by pravastatin were significantly blocked by compound C treatment. The accelerated angiogenesis by pravastatin after hindlimb ischemia was significantly reduced after treatment with compound C. Thus, ischemia induced AMPK phosphorylation in vivo. Furthermore, pravastatin could also activate AMPK in vivo and in vitro. Such phosphorylation results in eNOS activation and angiogenesis, which provide a novel explanation for one of the pleiotropic effects of statins that is beneficial for angiogenesis.", 
    "101": "Strategies aimed at primary prevention provide an outstanding opportunity for reducing the onset and burden of cardiovascular (CV) disease. Lipid abnormalities, including high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), elevated triglycerides and low levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), are associated with an increased risk of CV events, thereby serving as contributors to this process. By consensus, lowering LDL-C, generally with statin therapy, is the primary target of lipid-lowering therapy. However, statin therapy may be insufficient for patients with mixed dyslipidemia, especially those with insulin resistance syndromes. While the addition of niacin, fibrate or omega-3 fatty acids may be useful in this setting, outcomes data are lacking. Therefore, data from ongoing prospective studies will hopefully resolve this issue and facilitate identification of optimal strategies to augment CV risk reduction.",

CVD prevention remains unsatisfactory across Europe largely due to poor control of CVD risk factors (RFs), growing incidence of obesity and diabetes, and sedentary lifestyle/poor dietary habits. Hypercholesterolaemia is a proven CVD RF, and LDL-C lowering slows atherosclerotic progression and reduces major coronary events. Lipid-lowering therapy is cost-effective, and intensive treatment of high-risk patients further improves cost effectiveness. In Italy, models indicate that improved cholesterol management translates into potential yearly savings of euro 2.9-4 billion. Identifying and eliminating legislative and administrative barriers is essential to providing optimal lipid care to high-risk patients. Public health and government policy can influence clinical practice rapidly, and guideline endorsement via national health policy may reduce the CVD burden and change physician and patient behaviour. Action to reduce CVD burden should ideally include the integration of strategies to lower the incidence of major CV events, improvement in total CV risk estimation, database monitoring of CVD trends, and development of population educational initiatives on CVD prevention. Failure to bridge the gap between science and health policy, particularly in relation to lipid management, could result in missed opportunities to reverse the burgeoning epidemic of CVD in Europe.",

Atorvastatin resulted in significantly larger changes in all biomarkers in female patients, patients age <65 years, patients with LDL cholesterol <122 mg/dl, nonsmokers, and nondiabetic patients (p < 0.0001 for all). In particular, a significant increase in OxPL/apoB in response to atorvastatin was noted in all 20 subgroups evaluated. Weak or no significant correlations were noted between all OxLDL biomarkers and C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, tissue plasminogen activator, interleukin-6, intercellular adhesion molecule, vascular cell adhesion molecule, P-selectin, and E-selectin at randomization and 16 weeks.",

Eight-hour pharmacokinetic investigations were performed the day before the surgery and at a median of 5 weeks (range 3-6 weeks) after the surgery. Gastric bypass surgery produced a variable effect on individual systemic exposure to atorvastatin acid (area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve from 0 to 8 h postdose (AUC(0-8))), ranging from a threefold decrease to a twofold increase (median ratio = 1.1, P = 0.99).

The pathogenesis of the lipid profile in PD patients is not well understood, but both the peritoneal protein loss and the glucose absorption from the dialysate may contributes to these alterations. Hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, more commonly known as statins, are effective to reduce low density cholesterol levels in PD patients, but so far no large studies has been performed concerning the effects on clinical outcome in PD patients. Except from the lipid lowering effects, statins also have pleiotropic effects that are independent of their lipid lowering effect. Several of these pleiotropic effects may inhibit pathogenetic pathways involved in the long-term structural and functional changes in the peritoneal membrane, which also is supported by limited data from animal studies. Further studies in PD patients are needed concerning the potentially beneficial effects of statins on the peritoneal membrane.",

In patients without coronary heart disease or diabetes, with a baseline low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level < 130 mg/dL and a C-reactive protein (CRP) > or = 2mg/L, a statin-induced LDL-C reduction of 50% reduced serious cardiac events by about 50%, including in women and the elderly, and also lowered all-cause mortality. The mean on-treatment LDL-C level (55 mg/dL) in the rosuvastatin arm of JUPITER was about in the mid-range of the physiologically normal levels. C-reactive protein screening should be considered, especially in patients without preexisting indications for statin therapy. In general, the CRP-lowering efficacy of statin therapy is directly and significantly correlated with its LDL-C-lowering activity.

The existing method with UV detection set at 240 nm was successfully transferred from a conventional silica column to a 10 cm x 4.6 mm i.d. monolithic silica column. By simply increasing the mobile phase flow rate, run time was about five-fold reduced and the consumption of mobile phase was about two-fold decreased, while the chromatographic resolution of the analytes remain unaffected.

Here, we isolated an allele of the hmg1(+) gene, hmg1-1/its12, as a mutant that showed sensitivities to high temperature and to FK506, a calcineurin inhibitor. The hmg1-1 allele contained an opal nonsense mutation in its N-terminal transmembrane domain, yet in spite of the mutation a full-length protein was produced, suggesting a read-through termination codon. Consistently, overexpression of the hmg1-1 mutant gene suppressed the mutant phenotypes. The hmg1-1 mutant showed hypersensitivity to pravastatin, an HMGR inhibitor, suggesting a defective HMGR activity. The mutant treated with FK506 caused dramatic morphological changes and showed defects in cell wall integrity, as well as displayed synthetic growth phenotypes with the mutant alleles of genes involved in cytokinesis and cell wall integrity. The mutant exhibited different phenotypes from those of the disruption mutants of ergosterol biosynthesis genes, and it showed normal filipin staining as well as showed normal subcellular localization of small GTPases.

Evidence suggests that chronic heart failure (CHF) is associated with an increased inflammatory process. Pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-1 (IL-1) and adhesion molecules are elevated in states of CHF and are related to long term prognosis. Statins are among the most effective compounds reducing morbidity and mortality in patients with, or at increased risk of, CAD. Efficacy and safety of statin treatment has not been validated in patients with CHF. Several studies have reported that statins could be beneficial in patients with CHF. In addition, the beneficial effects of statins have been largely attributed to their anti-inflammatory properties. However, recent randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials reported that statins did not affect clinical outcomes in patients with CHF of any cause. These data support the notion that current immunomodulation approaches in heart failure are not successful. Thus, more large scale clinical trials are required to evaluate the impact of statins on immune imbalance and its restoration in patients with CHF.",

A large proportion of these people are affected by chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a recognized risk factor for vascular events. Systemic inflammation is the main atherothrombotic abnormality in COPD, but hypoxia-related platelet activation, pro-coagulant status and oxidative stress may play a role. Systemic inflammation is presumably a leading mechanism of atherothrombosis also in people who have a \"restrictive\" spirometric dysfunction, rather than the classic obstructive pattern of COPD. Many persons with \"poor lung function\" are affected by diabetes and their cardiovascular risk is therefore linked to the diabetic status. Patients affected by diabetes tend to have a \"restrictive\" dysfunction, rather than COPD. Recent studies show that restriction at spirometry precedes the onset of diabetes, thereby representing a marker of mechanisms involved in the pre-diabetic, insulin-resistant state. This is also proved by the fact that most patients with metabolic syndrome, a pre-diabetic condition, have a restrictive ventilatory pattern at spirometry. A significant proportion of people with \"poor lung function\" have visceral obesity, a cardiovascular risk factor. By hampering lung expansion, visceral obesity causes a restrictive ventilatory pattern. In conclusion, the term \"poor lung function\" includes various chronic illnesses with different mechanisms of atherothrombosis. Research is needed for better understanding why persons with lung dysfunctions have higher cardiovascular risk, and for identifying adequate preventive strategies.",

The kidney is a highly vascularized organ and has two important microvasculatures; glomerular and peritubular capillaries. Loss of these capillaries is strongly associated with the progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) to end-stage renal disease. In several kidney disease animal models, VEGF expression in the kidney is decreased and administration of VEGF is protective. Recent clinical observations revealed that blocking VEGF by endogenous inhibitor (soluble Flt-1) in preeclampsia and monoclonal antibody against VEGF in cancer patients cause proteinuria and renal dysfunction. However, plasma VEGF levels in diabetic nephropathy patients are increased and blocking VEGF improved diabetic nephropathy in animal models. Increased plasma VEGF levels have been reported in CKD patients. Deleterious effects of VEGF have been demonstrated in atherosclerosis and sepsis, which are frequent complications in CKD patients. Although administrating VEGF or novel drugs that activate VEGF pathway may improve the progression of CKD, careful monitoring will be required when CKD patients have complications of diabetes, atherosclerosis or sepsis.", 
    "145": "Several oral \"vasoactive\" drugs claim to increase walking capacity in patients with intermittent claudication (IC). Naftidrofuryl, cilostazol, buflomedil, and pentoxifylline are the most studied molecules. Although spanning several decades, several studies underlying these claims were not properly designed, underpowered or showed clinically doubtful outcomes. The evidence for these \"vasoactive\" drugs has always been received with scepticism, creating the need for systematic reviews and meta-analyses. This brief review discusses the benefit-risk assessment of vasoactive drugs, by applying a systematic review to evaluate randomized, placebo-controlled trials. Oral naftidrofuryl and cilostazol have an acceptable safety profile as well as sustained evidence (documented by Cochrane analyses) of increased walking capacity. Subsequently, these drugs entered recommendations for peripheral arterial disease (PAD). In contrast, buflomedil and pentoxifylline have limited and/or doubtful evidence to increase walking capacity. Moreover, there were safety concerns about the narrow therapeutic range of buflomedil. Most other \"vasoactive\" drugs were either inappropriately or insufficiently tested or showed no significant if not negative effects on IC. \"Vasoactive\" drugs are no substitutes for lifestyle or exercise therapy but are adjuvant treatment to the well-appreciated triad of cardiovascular prevention (antiplatelet agents, statins and ACE-inhibitors), of which statins in their own right have documented claims to significantly increase walking capacity. \"Vasoactive\" drugs may have a place in the pharmacological management of symptomatic PAD in addition to the basic cardiovascular pharmacotherapy, when revascularization is not indicated, when exercise therapy is not feasible or when there is still insufficient benefit.",

Inhaled pollutants induce a pulmonary and systemic inflammatory response that is thought to exacerbate cardiovascular disease. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) have been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects that could contribute to their beneficial effect in cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study is to determine the effects of statins on PM(10)-induced cytokine production in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) and alveolar macrophages (AMs). Primary HBECs and AMs are obtained from resected human lung. Cells are pretreated with different concentrations of atorvastatin for 24 hours and then exposed to 100 microg/mL urban air pollution particles (EHC-93). Cytokine levels (interleukin-1beta, interleukin-8, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) are measured at messenger RNA and protein levels using real-time polymerase chain reaction and bead-based multiplex immunoassay, respectively. PM(10) exposure increases production of these cytokines by both cell types. Atorvastatin attenuates PM(10)-induced messenger RNA expression and cytokine production by AMs but not by HBECs. It is concluded that statins can modulate the PM(10)-induced inflammatory response in the lung by reducing mediator production by AMs.",

The significant differences in TNF-alpha-induced monocytic cell recruitment and adhesion molecule expression between laminar and non-uniform shear stress regions were abolished in the absence of shear stress preconditioning. Simvastatin (1 micromol/L) suppressed the non-uniform shear stress- and TNF-alpha-induced increase in monocytic cell adhesion by about 30% via inhibition of VCAM-1 expression. Resveratrol, the active component of red wine, inhibited the expression of both VCAM-1 and E-selectin, and reduced monocytic cell recruitment by 50% at 20 micromol/L.",

    "154": "Lipid-lowering therapy with statins has been associated with decreased mortality and morbidity in heart transplant recipients. Among the available drugs, pravastatin, fluvastatin or low-dose simvastatin have been recommended due to the low risk of pharmacokinetic interaction. However, these first-line statins possess a rather modest lipid-lowering effect and selection of alternative statins is limited due to interactions with cyclosporine (CsA). The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of conversion to tacrolimus and atorvastatin in CsA-treated heart transplant recipients and dyslipidemia refractory to fluvastatin.", 
    "155": "Thirty heart transplant recipients taking CsA and fluvastatin 40 to 80 mg/day, with total cholesterol levels of >211 mg/dl, were recruited. After baseline assessment, they were converted to tacrolimus and atorvastatin at a starting dose of 20 mg/day and underwent clinical and laboratory follow-up at 1, 4, 7, 10 and 13 months.", 
    "156": "During 13 months of follow-up, treatment with tacrolimus and atorvastatin was tolerated in 24 patients (80%). No case of myotoxicity, liver toxicity or new-onset diabetes was observed. After conversion, the mean cholesterol level (as averaged from levels at 1, 4, 7, 10 and 13 months) was lower than before conversion (183 +/- 24 vs 231 +/- 33 mg/dl, p < 0.0001). When compared with baseline values, conversion also resulted in lower mean LDL-cholesterol levels (92 +/- 25 vs 130 +/- 38 mg/dl, p < 0.0001) and lower mean triglyceride levels (166 +/- 60 vs 220 +/- 101 mg/dl, p < 0.0001).", 
    "157": "Conversion to tacrolimus and atorvastatin appears to be a safe and effective lipid-lowering therapy in CsA-treated heart transplant recipients with dyslipidemia refractory to fluvastatin.", 
    "158": "Statin therapy reduces the incidence of cardiovascular (CV) disease by 30-40%. However, some risk of unprevented CV complications still persists. Thus, new drugs that when associated to the statins favorably modify the lipid profile and further reduce CV risk are needed. In this clinical commentary, we review the role of other lipids (HDL cholesterol and triglycerides) in CV risk and those potentially useful agents that could be added to statins. Fibrates are especially effective to decrease triglycerides, whilst niacin has a global effect, decreasing LDL cholesterol and triglycerides and is the most effective drug to increase HDL cholesterol. The association of statins plus niacin may be the immediate future to tackle the comprehensive treatment of dyslipidemia and potentially further reduce the risk of CV disease.", 
    "159": "Increased flux of glucose via the polyol pathway, oxidative stress and ischaemia lead to the upregulation of the aldose reductase (AR), the key enzyme of the polyol pathway. This adversely affects the organism and can in part be reduced by inhibition of the enzyme.", 
    "160": "In this study, we examined the effect of the HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor atorvastatin on the expression of aldose reductase (AR, AKR1B1), aldehyde reductase (AldR, AKR1A1) and small intestine reductase (SIR, AKR1B10) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and human proximal tubular epithelial cells (PTEC) by RT-PCR.", 
    "161": "In HUVEC, atorvastatin reduces the expression of aldehyde reductase and aldose reductase compared with control medium (-20% and -12% respectively, P < 0.05), while small intestine reductase is not expressed. In PTEC no regulation of aldehyde reductase and aldose reductase by atorvastatin could be measured, while the expression of small intestine reductase was reduced by 37% compared with control medium (P < 0.05). The reduction observed was not abolished by the addition of mevalonic acid.", 
    "162": "The reduction of members of the aldo-keto-reductase family by atorvastatin is a novel way to influence the polyol pathway and a new pleiotropic effect of atorvastatin."
