    "0": "We investigated the effects of intestinal bile acid flux, orientation of the 7-hydroxy group, and administration of lovastatin on the regulation of intestinal 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase activity in the rat ileum. HMG-CoA reductase activities in villous and crypt cells from the ileal mucosa were similar, and the study was performed on whole mucosa that contained both cell types. Taurocholate feeding decreased ileal reductase activity 48%, whereas tauroursocholate, the 7 beta-hydroxy epimer of taurocholate, had no effect. Feeding lovastatin (inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase) stimulated total ileal HMG-CoA reductase activity threefold in washed microsomes, which were dissociated from the inhibitor. However, the proportion of active enzyme in the ileum of lovastatin-fed rats was 50% lower than in controls, whereas there was no change in the percentage of expressed enzyme with bile acid treatments. Interruption of the enterohepatic circulation (bile fistula) increased HMG-CoA reductase activity in the ileum 73%. Duodenal infusion of taurocholate to bile-fistula rats significantly decreased microsomal HMG-CoA reductase activity in the ileal mucosa. In contrast, infusion of the 7 beta-hydroxy epimer tauroursocholate failed to inhibit the derepressed HMG-CoA reductase activity in the ileum of bile-fistula rats. The inhibition of intestinal HMG-CoA reductase activity by taurocholate occurred without accumulation of mucosal cholesterol. Furthermore, the stimulation of total ileal HMG-CoA reductase activity by lovastatin treatment was observed without a decrease in mucosal cholesterol. In summary, the regulation of ileal HMG-CoA reductase activity by the intestinal luminal flux of bile acids is dependent on the orientation of the hydroxyl groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "1": "Primary human acute myeloid leukaemic (AML) cells from bone marrow (BM) and peripheral (PB), the human myeloblastic leukaemia cell line (HL60) and normal human BM mononuclear cells were cultured in serum-free medium. The survival of progenitor cells from normal BM, HL60 and AML cell populations was reduced over a range of concentrations of simvastatin. This dose response relationship was more pronounced in HL60 and AML cell cultures, indicating greater sensitivity of AML progenitor cells compared with normal BM progenitors. Short-term exposure (18 h) to a range of concentrations of simvastatin showed the same differential response between leukaemic and normal BM cells in terms of clonogenicity. At a concentration of 10 micrograms/ml progenitor cell survival remained above 65% for normal BM while at this concentration leukaemia progenitor cell survival fell below 25% of the untreated values. The differential effect of simvastatin on normal and leukaemic progenitor cells may have value in the clinical management of AML. The possible use of simvastatin, or related drugs, as adjuvants to conventional chemotherapy including in vitro BM purging, merits consideration.", 
    "2": "Using a density-gradient ultracentrifugation technique, we analyzed in detail the plasma lipoprotein profiles of 18 patients with familial dysbetalipoproteinemia (FD) who had apolipoprotein (apo) E2(Arg158-->Cys) homozygosity (the E2-158 variant, n = 6), apoE3-Leiden heterozygosity (the E3-Leiden variant, n = 6), or apoE2(Lys146-->Gln) heterozygosity (the E2-146 variant, n = 6), with average plasma cholesterol concentrations of 8.99 +/- 1.34 mmol/L, 9.29 +/- 1.55 mmol/L, and 8.46 +/- 1.10 mmol/L, respectively. No significant differences in sex, age, body mass index, dietary habits, and standard laboratory tests between the three groups were observed. The lipoprotein profiles of all FD patients were characterized by higher concentrations of very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) 1, VLDL2, and intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL) and a higher cholesteryl ester content of VLDL1 and VLDL2 than in 6 normolipidemic control subjects with an average plasma cholesterol concentration of 5.90 +/- 0.53 mmol/L. Major differences between the plasma lipoprotein profiles of patients with the E2-158 variant, the E3-Leiden variant, and the E2-146 variant and the normolipidemic control subjects were in IDL cholesterol concentration (1.70 +/- 0.26, 1.50 +/- 0.26, 1.05 +/- 0.36, and 0.47 +/- 0.14 mmol/L, respectively), LDL cholesterol concentration (1.83 +/- 0.50, 3.09 +/- 0.32, 3.79 +/- 0.76, and 3.77 +/- 0.56 mmol/L, respectively), and the molar ratio of IDL cholesterol to LDL cholesterol (0.98 +/- 0.28, 0.48 +/- 0.04, 0.28 +/- 0.09, and 0.12 +/- 0.03, respectively). After 10 weeks of simvastatin treatment the concentrations of plasma cholesterol, VLDL2 cholesterol, IDL cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol in 3 patients with the E2-158 variant fell significantly, by 46%, 56%, 53%, and 48%, respectively; they also fell in 3 patients with the E3-Leiden variant, by 48%, 54%, 57%, and 52%, respectively, and in 3 patients with the E2-146 variant, by 38%, 55%, 46%, and 35%, respectively. Simvastatin therapy lowered plasma activity of cholesteryl ester transfer protein but had no significant effect on plasma activity of lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase. It is concluded that patients with FD due to various apoE variants have different lipoprotein profiles, mainly with regard to IDL and LDL levels, although they have a number of similar features of dysbetalipoproteinemia. Simvastatin therapy effectively reduced the plasma concentrations of total cholesterol, VLDL2 cholesterol, IDL cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol in the three groups of patients studied. It is proposed that apoE-dependent defects of the conversion of IDL to LDL may be an important mechanism in the pathophysiology of FD.", 
    "3": "A method for the determination of pravastatin sodium (PS), a cholesterol-lowering agent, in plasma was developed by using an immobilized antibody column extraction followed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). The analyte was monitored by a laser-induced fluorescence detector after fluorogenic derivatization. The PS antibody was coupled to Sepharose 4B and used as an extraction phase for sample cleanup and extraction of the drug. A plasma sample was applied to the column and washed with water, and the drug was eluted with methanol. N-Dansylethylenediamine (DNS-ED) was coupled to the carboxyl moiety of the drug in the presence of diethyl phosphorocyanidate (DEPC) and triethylamine (TEA) in dioxane. Derivatization was completed in 5 min at room temperature. A column-switching technique was utilized to remove excess reagents and byproducts. A He-Cd laser-induced fluorescence detector was applied to achieve an ultrasensitive determination. The detection limit was 2 pg/injection of PS, which was 20 times more sensitive than the conventional fluorescence detection. The limit of quantitation was 100 pg/mL when 1 mL of plasma sample was available. An average coefficient of variations of the overall method were less than 8% at the concentration range of 1-100 ng/mL. A single oral dose of PS in rats (20 mg/kg) and dogs (5 mg/kg) resulted in average maximum concentrations of 142 and 310 ng/mL, respectively.", 
    "4": "Restenosis remains the largest single obstacle to the long-term success of invasive vascular interventions. Lovastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, has been shown to reduce myointimal hyperplasia in animal models of restenosis and in one clinical coronary restenosis trial. We have assessed the effect of lovastatin on the growth of cultured human vascular smooth muscle cells derived from saphenous vein and vascular graft stenoses. Lovastatin (2 microM) inhibited proliferation over 14 days in saphenous vein (and graft stenoses) derived vascular smooth muscle cells by 42% and 32% respectively: this was not significantly different. Lovastatin (10 microM) reduced [methyl 3H]-thymidine uptake by 51% in saphenous vein-derived cells. These concentrations were significantly higher than those achieved in plasma during therapeutic dosage. Lovastatin-induced inhibition of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and [methyl 3H]-thymidine uptake was completely reversed by adding mevalonate (100 microM) but cholesterol (10-40 micrograms ml-1) had no effect. Isopentenyl adenine (25-50 microM) did not affect the inhibition of [methyl 3H]-thymidine uptake by lovastatin (10 microM), but farnesol (20 microM), another isoprenoid precursor of cholesterol synthesis, reversed the antiproliferative effect.", 
    "5": "This study investigates the hypothesis that lipid soluble antioxidants may increase the resistance of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) to oxidation and also enhance vascular endothelial responses in humans. In a double-blind parallel group study, 24 hypercholesterolaemic patients already on treatment with simvastatin (20 mg day-1), were randomized to supplementary treatment with probucol (500 mg bd), vitamin E (400 IU daily) or placebo for 8 weeks. Mean serum cholesterol before antioxidant treatment was 7.00 mmol l-1. Resistance of LDL to oxidation by copper was increased by 830% in the probucol group and by 30% in the vitamin E group. However, thiobarbituric acid reacting substances in whole serum were not altered by either antioxidant. Probucol lowered HDL- and LDL-cholesterol levels and increased the QT interval. Forearm vascular responses, as measured by venous occlusion plethysmography, to acetylcholine, glyceryl trinitrate and NG-monomethyl-L-arginine, were not significantly changed by antioxidant treatment. Probucol has a major, and vitamin E a minor, effect on LDL resistance to oxidation but neither compound appears to alter forearm vascular responses in vivo.", 
    "6": "The available antihyperlipidaemic drugs are generally safe and effective, and major systemic adverse effects are uncommon. However, because of their complex mechanisms of action, careful monitoring is required to identify and correct potential drug interactions. Bile acid sequestrants are the most difficult of these agents to administer concomitantly, because their nonspecific binding results in decreased bioavailability of a number of other drugs, including thiazide diuretics, digitalis preparations, beta-blockers, coumarin anticoagulants, thyroid hormones, fibric acid derivatives and certain oral antihyperglycaemia agents. Although the incidence is low, nicotinic acid may cause hepatic necrosis and so should not be used with drugs that adversely affect hepatic structure or function. With the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, relatively new agents for which clinical data are still being accumulated, the major problems appears to be rhabdomyolysis, associated with the concomitant use of cyclosporin, fibric acid derivatives or erythromycin, and mild, intermittent hepatic abnormalities that may be potentiated by other hepatotoxic drugs. Fibrates also have the potential to cause rhabdomyolysis, although generally only in combination with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, and are subject to binding by concomitantly administered bile acid sequestrants. The major interaction involving probucol is a possible additive effect with drugs or clinical conditions that alter the prolongation of the QTc interval, increasing the potential for polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.", 
    "7": "To determine the acute and long-term effects of low density lipoprotein (LDL) reduction on cholesterol biosynthesis, we studied changes in the cholesterol precursors mevalonic acid (MVA) and lathosterol in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia undergoing LDL-apheresis. Long-term LDL-apheresis in eight patients resulted in slight but insignificant increases in plasma MVA levels and lathosterol/cholesterol (L/C) ratios over 18 months. In short-term studies, six patients not on drugs and six patients treated with lovastatin or pravastatin had blood taken immediately before and after LDL-apheresis, and afterwards on days 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7. Plasma L/C ratios and MVA concentration did not change significantly on the first day after LDL-apheresis in those not on statin therapy (1.11 +/- 0.08 vs. 1.40 +/- 0.18, and 9.2 +/- 1.3 vs. 9.1 +/- 0.6 ng/ml, respectively) but increased in the statin-treated group (from 0.78 +/- 0.09 to 1.55 +/- 0.21, P = 0.003 and from 5.0 +/- 0.7 to 11.0 +/- 1.6 ng/ml, P = 0.008, respectively). There was no clear correlation between the changes in either of these precursors and the extent of reduction of total cholesterol by LDL-apheresis, but there was a strong inverse correlation with the post-apheresis LDL-cholesterol level (r = -0.77, P = 0.002 for L/C ratio; r = -0.75, P = 0.003 for MVA). Post-apheresis changes in L/C ratio and MVA were mutually correlated (r = 0.68. P = 0.01). We conclude that LDL-apheresis stimulates cholesterol biosynthesis transiently despite concomitant therapy with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, the degree of stimulation being inversely related to the level to which the LDL-cholesterol was reduced.", 
    "8": "The antiproliferative actions of retinoids in the C3H/10T1/2 cell system are exhibited as a decrease in proliferation rate and a decreased cell saturation density at confluence. These actions correlate with up-regulated gap junctional communication (GJC) driven by the retinoid-induced increased expression of the gap junctional protein connexin43 (Cx43). Here we examine which actions of retinoids occur only in cells making extensive intercellular contacts, and thus may be mediated through GJC, and which are exhibited in the absence of extensive intercellular contacts and thus may be independent of GJC. In confluent cultures, the synthetic retinoid tetrahydrotetramethylnapthalenyl-propenylbenzoic acid (TTNPB) increased GJC, reduced the already low [3H]thymidine-labeling index of G1 growth-arrested confluent cells from 4.2 to < 0.1%, and increased the area occupied by each cell by 42%. In contrast, none of these parameters was altered in logarithmic growth phase cells with very limited intercellular contacts. In order to separate cell-cell contact from cell cycle-related phenomena, non-contacting cells were arrested in early G1 by lovastatin. In this situation, Cx43 expression was low and inducible by retinoids, as in G1/G0 growth-arrested confluent cells; however, no cell spreading was induced by TTNPB. In contrast, in non-contacting cycling cells or in cells arrested by aphidicolin, Cx43 expression was higher than in confluent cells. In this situation, TTNPB did not induce Cx43 and did not induce spreading. These data demonstrate the cell cycle phase dependence of connexin43 expression and of retinoid action.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "9": "Atherosclerotic lesion development was assessed in the thoracic aorta and chronically denuded iliac-femoral artery of hypercholesterolemic New Zealand White rabbits using inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase which have previously been shown to possess varying degrees of hepatoselectivity in rats. Atorvastatin, previously known as CI-981 (2.5 mg/kg), PD135022 (1.0 mg/kg), simvastatin (2.5 mg/kg), lovastatin (2.5 mg/kg), PD134965 (1.0 mg/kg), pravastatin (2.5 mg/kg) and BMY22089 (2.5 mg/kg) were added to a 0.5% cholesterol, 3% peanut, 3% coconut oil diet and fed for 8 weeks. Although reductions in plasma total cholesterol of 27% to 60%, VLDL-cholesterol of 31% to 71% and plasma total cholesterol exposure of 37% to 43% were obtained, no correlation between these parameters and vascular lipid content, lesion size or monocyte-macrophage content was noted. Iliac-femoral lipid content was unchanged; however, atorvastatin and simvastatin significantly reduced the cholesterol content of the thoracic aorta by 45%-62%. Atorvastatin and PD135022 reduced the size of the iliac-femoral lesion by 67% and monocyte-macrophage content by 72%. Simvastatin, lovastatin and PD134965 decreased the monocyte-macrophage content; however, lesion size was unchanged. Pravastatin and BMY22089 had no effect on lesion size or content. No compound significantly reduced the extent of thoracic aortic lesions. We concluded that changes in plasma lipids and lipoproteins noted with the various HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors did not account for the beneficial effect on atherosclerotic lesion development. The antiatherosclerotic potential of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors was compound-specific and clearly not a class effect.", 
    "10": "Transposons with selectable marker genes (e.g., antibiotic resistance) have been extremely useful tools in bacterial genetics but have not been found naturally in Archaea. We constructed synthetic transposons consisting of halobacterial ISH elements (ISH2, ISH26, or ISH28) flanking a mevinolin resistance determinant. Introduction of these constructs into Haloferax volcanii cells can produce drug-resistant transformants through homologous recombination between the plasmid hmgA gene and the chromosomal hmgA locus. This problem was overcome by using another host, Haloarcula hispanica, the hmgA gene of which shares little homology with that from Haloferax volcanii. Introduction of an ISH28-based transposon (ThD28) into Haloarcula hispanica cells produced numerous transformants. Each of these was shown to contain an ISH-flanked mevinolin resistance determinant integrated into the cellular DNA. Integration was not obviously site specific. Transposon ThD26 (based on ISH26a), was less mobile, relative to ThD28, and the ISH2-based construct (ThD22) did not transpose at all in these cells. The further development of halobacterial transposons may provide useful genetic tools allowing rapid isolation and analysis of halobacterial genes, particularly those with no selectable phenotype.", 
    "11": "In this study, which was primarily designed to determine the lipid-lowering efficacy of pravastatin in the setting of background antihypertensive therapy with ACE inhibitors and calcium antagonists, we took the opportunity to examine whether pravastatin interacts with antihypertensive therapy to produce additional falls in blood pressure. This may help clarify the mechanism of action of pravastatin's rapid beneficial effects on cardiovascular morbidity. We treated 25 hypertensive hypercholesterolaemic patients with 12 weeks of either pravastatin or placebo in this double blind, placebo controlled parallel group study. Placebo treatment did not alter plasma lipids, whereas 12 weeks' treatment with pravastatin reduced total cholesterol by 27% (from 7.1 +/- 0.27 to 5.2 +/- 0.18, p < 0.001 compared with placebo) and low density lipoprotein cholesterol by 35% (from 4.9 +/- 0.36 to 3.2 +/- 0.17, p < 0.001). There were no changes in systolic or diastolic blood pressure either following 12 weeks' treatment or 3 weeks' withdrawal of pravastatin. Thus, pravastatin remains efficacious as a lipid lowering agent in the presence of antihypertensive therapy but does not enhance the blood pressure lowering action of these drugs. Therefore it is unlikely that blood pressure reduction is the mechanism by which pravastatin mediates its reported short term effects on cardiovascular morbidity.", 
    "12": "This study estimated the cost-effectiveness of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors available in Canada for the primary prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD). A model of the cost-effectiveness of therapy used to modify low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels was developed in the primary prevention of CHD based on risk functions from the Framingham Heart Study and Canadian data on coronary risk factors and the cost of treating the leading manifestations of CHD. Relative to no treatment, discounted gains in life expectancy range from 0.174 year for fluvastatin 40 mg to 0.215 year for simvastatin 10 mg. Costs per year-of-life-saved range from $38,800 for fluvastatin 40 mg to $56,200 for pravastatin 20 mg. In the incremental analysis relative to fluvastatin 40 mg, additional gains in life expectancy range from 0.011 year for pravastatin 20 mg to 0.041 year for simvastatin 10 mg, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios range from $88,200 for simvastatin, 10 mg to $330,300 for pravastatin 20 mg. Our analysis showed that the cost-effectiveness of cholesterol-lowering therapy is sensitive to pretreatment risk of CHD, as expressed by pretreatment cholesterol levels and the presence of additional risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, and smoking. The results of the analysis suggest that it is more cost-effective to initiate treatment with fluvastatin than with pravastatin, simvastatin, or lovastatin. Sensitivity analysis showed the results to be stable even if the lipid-lowering effect of fluvastatin is varied by 23% from the original assumption of 25% LDL reduction (ie, from 19.3% to 30.8%). Limitations of the study are recognized and discussed. A head-to-head comparison of these HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors could provide further evidence that therapy initiated with fluvastatin may be the most cost-effective way to treat patients with hypercholesterolemia who are eligible for treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors.", 
    "13": "Hyperlipidemia associated to nephrotic syndrome has been involved in the deterioration of the renal function in these patients. The reduction in the synthesis of cholesterol with pravastatin, an hydrophilic inhibitor of such synthesis, may improve both the dyslipemia, the renal function and the proteinuria.", 
    "14": "We conducted a controlled open randomized study in 16 patients with proteinuria greater than 2 g/day, creatinine clearance greater than 0.5 ml/s (30 ml/min) and hypercholesterolemia with LDL cholesterol greater than 4.9 mmol/l (190 mg/dl) distributed in two groups. One of these groups received hypolipemiant dietetic treatment and 20-40 mg of pravastatin and the other group, only the dietetic treatment.", 
    "15": "The patients receiving pravastatin showed a 27% decrease in total plasmatic cholesterol, compared to a 6.7% in the control group (p < 0.01). This decrease was more evident in the LDL cholesterol fraction (44 vs 9%; p < 0.01). No significant modifications were observed in the HDL cholesterol fraction, triglycerides, renal function or proteinuria. Neither clinical nor enzymatiz adverse effects from hepatic or muscular origin were observed.", 
    "16": "Three infants with malonic aciduria are reported, one of whom could be studied in detail. All children had severe and progressive encephalopathy with intermittent ketoacidosis and hypoglycemia. One infant died of cardiomyopathy. Biochemical studies revealed that one patient had neither malonyl-CoA decarboxylase nor glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiencies. This variant of malonic aciduria is different from that of four patients previously reported, both in its clinical and biochemical presentations. The biochemical pathology of this variant malonic aciduria is unknown.", 
    "17": "Lipid-lowering therapy ameliorates coronary atherosclerosis in patients with raised concentrations of low-density-lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. We have investigated whether a similar benefit can be obtained in normocholesterolaemic patients. We studied 79 normocholesterolaemic patients with coronary heart disease (70 male, 9 female), mean age 58 years, all non-smokers, with mean total cholesterol concentration 5.5 mmol/L. All patients received diet therapy and were randomly assigned placebo (39) or active treatment (40) with pravastatin, nicotinic acid, cholestyramine, and gemfibrozil stepwise as needed to reach the specified goal (total cholesterol < or = 4.1 mmol/L, ratio of LDL/high-density-lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol < or = 2.0). Coronary angiograms at baseline and after 2.5 years of treatment were analysed by computer-assisted quantitative techniques. There was no significant difference in coronary atherosclerosis during follow-up between the active treatment and placebo groups; the mean minimum diameter narrowed significantly but to the same extent in both groups (change baseline to 2.5 years 0.14 [SD 0.42] and 0.15 [0.42] mm, respectively, both p < 0.001). Similarly, the change in percentage stenosis did not differ between the groups (2.1 [10.6] vs 2.4 [10.3]%). By multiple regression analysis, the adjusted difference between the groups was a 0.04 mm (95% CI -0.04 to 0.12 mm) increase in minimum diameter and a 0% (-1.7 to 1.7) change in percentage stenosis. The groups differed significantly in plasma lipids (% change in active minus % change in placebo group: -28% total cholesterol, -41% LDL-cholesterol, 13% HDL-cholesterol, -26% triglycerides, -31% apolipoprotein B, all p < 0.001). Thus, intensive pharmacological treatment of normocholesterolaemic patients has significant effects on plasma lipid concentrations but no angiographically measurable benefit on the coronary arteries.", 
    "18": "3 beta-Hydroxy-5 alpha-cholestan-15-one (2a) and its 14 beta-epimer 2b were prepared from 3 beta-acetoxy-5 alpha-cholest-8(14)-ene (3). Hydroboration of 3 at 45-50 degrees C gave a mixture of 5 alpha,14 alpha-cholestane-3 beta,15 alpha-diol and 5 alpha,14 beta-cholestane-3 beta,15 beta-diol, which were separated on silica gel as their 3 beta-tert-butyldimethylsilyl ethers 5a and 5b. Oxidation of 5a with pyridinium chlorochromate, followed by desilylation with tetrabutylammonium fluoride gave 2a. Analogous transformations of 5b gave 2b contaminated with 2a. Desilylation of 5b followed by oxidation with pyridinium chlorochromate resulted in a mixture composed mainly of 5 alpha,14 beta-cholestane-3,15-dione and 2b. Successive chromatographic separations on silica gel and reversed phase media gave 2b of high purity. Compound 2a was also prepared by lithium-ammonia reduction of 3 beta-hydroxy-5 alpha-cholest-8(14)-en-15-one (96% yield) and by selective reduction of 5 alpha-cholestane-3,15-dione with lithium tri-tert-butoxyaluminum hydride (90% yield). Isomers 2a and 2b were readily epimerized under acidic or basic conditions or under conditions used for gas chromatographic analysis. The purities of 2a and 2b were measured from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra; chromatographic methods gave less reliable estimates of purity. NMR data also showed that ring C of the 14 beta sterols is predominantly in a chair conformation. The effects of 2a and 2b on the levels of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase have been studied in Chinese hamster ovary cells.", 
    "19": "With the aim of assessing the effectiveness and safety of lovastatin in patients with hypercholesterolemia after heart transplantation, as well as the potential differences in the lipid-lowering effect of lovastatin between patients with or without pretransplant coronary artery disease (CAD), we studied 63 heart transplant patients who had serum total cholesterol > 250 mg/dl in spite of dietary therapy. Mean age of subjects was 47 +/- 2 years. Triple-drug immunosuppressive therapy consisted of cyclosporine, azathioprine, and steroids. Thirty-nine patients (62%) had pretransplant CAD and 24 (38%) did not. Pretreatment serum lipid levels were: total cholesterol, 302 +/- 32 mg/dl; low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, 201 +/- 35 mg/dl; high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, 60 +/- 19 mg/dl; triglycerides, 205 +/- 86 mg/dl; and total/HDL cholesterol ratio, 5.4 +/- 1.6. Patients received 10 to 40 mg/day of lovastatin (mean dose 17 +/- 6) for 13 +/- 4 months. There were no serious adverse events. At 3 months, lovastatin decreased total cholesterol by 15% (p < 0.001), LDL cholesterol by 21% (p < 0.001), triglycerides by 17% (p < 0.05), and total/HDL cholesterol ratio by 17% (p < 0.001), and increased HDL cholesterol by 3% (NS). Although lovastatin was effective in both patients with pretransplant CAD and non-CAD, analysis of its effect in each subgroup (CAD and non-CAD) revealed that its lipid-lowering effect was higher for non-CAD patients (-20% vs -12% for total cholesterol, and -27% vs -17% for LDL cholesterol, both p < 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "20": "The mechanism by which lovastatin lowers cholesterol levels is well characterized but little is known about its anti-mitogenic and anti-tumorigenic mechanism. Here we demonstrate that lovastatin disrupts early events in the mitogenic signaling pathways of insulin. Insulin treatment (200 mM) of quiescent HIR rat-1 fibroblasts results in an 8-fold stimulation of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI-3-K) activity. Overnight pretreatment of cells with lovastatin (20 microM) inhibits insulin stimulation of PI-3-K activity by 75%. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting experiments using antibodies against the regulatory subunit of PI-3-K (p85), phosphotyrosine, and insulin receptor alpha and beta subunits demonstrate that lovastatin inhibits the association of p85 with tyrosine phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1 and the beta subunit of the insulin receptor. Furthermore, lovastatin dramatically reduces (70-100%) the level of tyrosine phosphorylated insulin receptor beta subunit following insulin stimulation. These results clearly demonstrate that lovastatin disrupts early events of insulin mitogenic signaling by reducing the levels of tyrosine phosphorylated beta subunit and suggest that this disruption is a potential mechanism for the anti-mitogenic effect of lovastatin.", 
    "21": "The authors studied the effects of lovastatin on the parameters of serum and lipoprotein lipids in an open multicenter trial. 160 patients with hypercholesterolemia participated in the study, 151 of whom completed the trial. After a 4 week period of dietary measures, the patients were treated with lovastatin for 12 weeks while combining standard lipid lowering diet. The initial dose of the drug was 20 mg, this was increased until serum cholesterol level decreased under 5.2 mmol/l, or to a maximal daily dose of 80 mg. By the end of the 12th week, serum cholesterol level was reduced by an average of 33% (p < 0.001), LDL-cholesterol by an average of 45% (p < 0.001), serum triglyceride concentration by an average of 22% (p < 0.001) and HDL-cholesterol increased by an average of 13% (p < 0.001). Lovastatin showed a very good safety profile, therapy had to be cancelled due to the occurrence of adverse events only in 4 cases.", 
    "22": "This multinational, 16-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the efficacy and safety of low-dose pravastatin in 325 patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) and hypercholesterolemia [serum total cholesterol concentrations of 5.2-7.8 mmol/l (200 to 300 mg/dl)]. Patients were randomized to receive pravastatin 10 mg or matching placebo with doubling of the dose after 8 weeks if predefined target levels for total cholesterol [(i.e., < 5.2 mmol/l (200 mg/dl) or > 15% decrease from baseline] had not been achieved. At Week 16, pravastatin-treated patients showed a 21.4% decrease in serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and a 13.5% reduction in serum total cholesterol (TC) concentrations (p < 0.001 compared with placebo). Levels of triglycerides (TG) were reduced 9.6% during pravastatin treatment (p < 0.05 compared with placebo) while high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels were increased 4.4% (p = NS). Adverse events and laboratory test abnormalities were similar among patients treated with pravastatin or placebo. Glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) levels remained unchanged. The results of this study demonstrate that low-dose pravastatin is effective and well tolerated for lowering elevated cholesterol concentrations during short-term treatment of patients with NIDDM and hypercholesterolemia.",

A diversity of clinical and angiographic studies has been made to evaluate the linkage between plasma lipid-control therapy in the development of initial and recurrent cardiovascular events. The plan of treatment invariably begins with a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet before initiation of drug therapy. However, many patients have difficulty in adhering to the low-fat diet. Fortunately, metabolic studies show that foods which contain fats rich in stearic (saturated) and oleic (monounsaturated) fatty acids may be given in limited amounts to boost patients' compliance to a low-fat diet and to prevent their blood lipids from rising to abnormal levels. A bile acid sequestrant (cholestyramine or colestipol) is the first-line drug for control of hypercholesterolemia. Either gemfibrozil or gemfibrozil plus niacin is prescribed to raise high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels of CAD patients. Approval of two HMG CoA reductase inhibitors, pravastatin and simvastatin, by the FDA gives physicians the additional flexibility of employing a single or a combination drug therapy for optimal control of dyslipidemia. The association of low serum cholesterol level (< 160 mg/dl) with increase in noncardiac mortality has prompted health professionals to consider modifying the universal screening and treatment of serum cholesterol in children and young women and to use hypolipidemic drugs in patients judiciously.", 
    "24": "The Expanded Clinical Evaluation of Lovastatin study, a randomized, double-blind, placebo- and diet-controlled multicenter trial, evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of lovastatin over 48 weeks in 8,245 patients with moderately severe hypercholesterolemia. During year 1 of follow-up of the full cohort, lovastatin at 20 or 40 mg/day, or 20 or 40 mg twice daily, produced dose-dependent decreases in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (24% to 40%) and triglyceride levels (10% to 19%), and increases in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (6.6% to 9.5%). In all, 977 patients continued their original blinded treatment for an additional year. In year 2, the LDL cholesterol response to lovastatin was maintained, the triglyceride reductions were somewhat less, and the increases in HDL cholesterol were moderately greater than in year 1. Successive transaminase elevations > 3 times the upper limit of normal were observed in only 1 patient in year 2, yielding a cumulative 2-year incidence of from 0.1% (placebo or lovastatin 20 mg/day) to 1.9% (lovastatin 80 mg/day). Myopathy occurred in only 1 patient during year 2, and over the 2-year study was observed rarely and only at lovastatin dosages of 40 and 80 mg/day. This study indicates that lovastatin maintains its efficacy over long-term follow-up, particularly in effectively lowering LDL cholesterol, is generally well tolerated, and has a favorable safety profile.", 
    "25": "We have previously demonstrated that the lipid profile improves following successful combined pancreas-kidney transplantation (PKT). In this study, we examined whether changes in the lipid profile were different in men than in women following PKT. Fasting total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), and the TC to HDL ratio (TC/HDL) were evaluated in 47 patients (27 men and 20 women) with normal graft function following PKT. Lipids were evaluated at regular intervals 3.5 months to 2.2 years post-PKT (a total of 317 observations). After PKT, TC/HDL decreased (P < .05), TC was unchanged, and HDL increased (P < .05) in both men and women. Although TG decreased in both men and women, it reached statistical significance in men only (P < .05). There were no significant differences in any lipid parameters between men and women before PKT, but after PKT, TC, TG, and HDL were higher in women (240 +/- 11, 183 +/- 17, and 64 +/- 19 mg/dL, respectively) than in men (207 +/- 6, 143 +/- 11, and 53 +/- 2 mg/dL, P < .05 for each). When post-PKT values were analyzed for trends over time, both TC and TG decreased (P < .05 for both) without any significant difference in trends between men and women. When six individuals who had received lovastatin at any time during their postoperative course were removed from analysis, the gender differences in TG post-PKT and the decrease in TG over time were no longer statistically significant (P > .05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "26": "Passive Heymann nephritis (PHN) is a model of human membranous nephropathy that is characterized by formation of granular subepithelial immune deposits in the glomerular capillary wall which results in complement activation. This is causally related to damage of the filtration barrier and subsequent proteinuria. The local accumulation of injurious reactive oxygen species (ROS) is a major effector mechanism in PHN. ROS may induce tissue damage by initiating lipid peroxidation (LPO). In turn, this leads to adduct formation between breakdown products of LPO with structural proteins, such as formation of malondialdehyde (MDA) or 4-hydroxynonenal-lysine adducts. To examine the role of LPO in the development of proteinuria we have localized MDA and 4-hydroxynonenal-lysine adducts in glomeruli of PHN rats by immunofluorescence microscopy, using specific monoclonal antibodies. By immunogold electron microscopy, MDA adducts were localized to cytoplasmic vesicles and cell membranes of glomerular epithelial cells, to the glomerular basement membrane (GBM), and also to immune deposits. Type IV collagen was specifically identified as being modified by MDA adducts, using a variety of techniques. Collagenase pretreatment of GBM extracts indicated that the NC-1 domain of type IV collagen was a site of adduct formation. When LPO was inhibited by pretreatment of PHN rats with the antioxidant probucol, proteinuria was reduced by approximately 85%, and glomerular immunostaining for dialdehyde adducts was markedly reduced, even though the formation of immune deposits was not affected. By contrast, lowering of the serum cholesterol levels had no influence on the development of proteinuria. These findings are consistent with the premise that ROS-induced glomerular injury in PHN involves LPO and that this results not only in damage of cell membranes but in modification of type IV collagen in the GBM as well. The close temporal correlation of the occurrence of LPO with proteinuria and the ability of probucol to inhibit proteinuria support a causal role for LPO in the the alteration of the glomerular permselectivity which results in proteinuria.", 
    "27": "Familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL) is the most common genetic lipid disorder among young survivors of myocardial infarction. Elevations of plasma total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and the prevalence of small, dense LDL particles are both involved in the high coronary risk of FCHL patients. We investigated the ability of pravastatin to favorably correct plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels and LDL structure in FCHL patients. Twelve patients with FCHL, documented by studies of first-degree relatives, received pravastatin (40 mg/d) for 12 weeks. Pravastatin significantly lowered plasma total and LDL cholesterol levels by 21% and 32%, respectively. Triglyceride levels did not change, and apolipoprotein B (apoB) concentrations decreased by 9% (P = NS). High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol increased by 6% because of a significant 73% rise of HDL2 cholesterol. LDL were smaller (diameter, 24.5 +/- 0.5 nm), less buoyant, and apoB-rich (cholesteryl ester-apoB ratio, 1.64 +/- 0.46) in the selected patients compared with patients with familial hypercholesterolemia or healthy control subjects. LDL became even smaller (23.8 +/- 0.6 nm) and richer in apoB (cholesteryl ester-apoB ratio, 1.27 +/- 0.52) after pravastatin treatment. Although pravastatin favorably altered plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels in FCHL patients, the abnormal LDL particle distribution and composition were not affected. Because of the apparent resistance of the small, dense LDL to drug-induced modifications, a maximal lipid-lowering effect is needed to reduce coronary risk in FCHL patients.", 
    "28": "The aim of our study was the biochemical and functional examination of the liver during the therapy of familiar hyperlipoproteinemia by means of MevacorR (lovostatine) in comparison with the treatment by Vasosan S (cholestyramine). We examined 20 patients treated with a daily dose of MevacorR being 20-40 mg and, 18 patients treated with a daily dose of Vasosan S being 16-32 g for the period of 12 weeks. During the therapy the total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triacylglycerols, hepatic enzymes (AST, ALT, ALP) activity, functional test of the liver, biological half-time of antipyrine (t 1/2 antipyrine) were investigated at the onset and at the end of the study. We discovered that at the end of the treatments by MevacorR and Vasosan S the hypolipidemic effect increased (cholesterol p < 0.001, LDL cholesterol p < 0.001), and there was difference in the effect on HDL-cholesterol and in that on triacylglycerols. During the treatment we discovered that due to both medicaments the liver enzymes activity increased to a different extent. At the beginning of the study the antipyrine biological half-time statistically increased in both investigated groups, namely in comparison with the control group. At the end of the treatments in both groups the antipyrine half-time was prolonged, however not significantly. Prior to long-term therapy by hypolipidemics the authors recommend biochemical and functional examination of the liver. (Tab. 4, Fig. 8, Ref. 7.)", 
    "29": "1. Endothelial dysfunction, evidenced as an impaired response to acetylcholine, is well documented in hypercholesterolaemic subjects. We examined the ability of dietary supplementation with fish oils to restore endothelial function in forearm resistance vessels in these patients and compared this with restoration by lipid-lowering therapy. 2. Responses of forearm blood flow to acetylcholine (4.6, 9.25, 18.5 and 37 micrograms/min) and sodium nitroprusside (200, 400, 800 and 1600 ng/min) were obtained using forearm venous occlusion plethysmography in nine hypercholesterolaemic and seven age-matched control subjects. The dose-response curve to acetylcholine was significantly blunted in hypercholesterolaemic subjects when compared with controls (P < 0.001). Responses to sodium nitroprusside were not different between the two groups (P = 0.37). 3. Lipid-lowering therapy decreased total plasma cholesterol levels by 33% and significantly augmented the responses to acetylcholine (P = 0.001) but not to sodium nitroprusside in the hypercholesterolaemic subjects. 4. Dietary supplementation with fish oils had no effect on either total or low density lipoprotein-cholesterol but significantly augmented the responses to acetylcholine (P = 0.011) in hypercholesterolaemic subjects. Responses to sodium nitroprusside were not altered (P = 0.94). 5. This study shows that endothelium-dependent relaxation is impaired in subjects with high cholesterol levels and that this impairment can be reversed by lowering low density lipoproteins (LDL) cholesterol levels. In addition, we demonstrate that restoration of endothelial function can occur without changes in LDL levels, by dietary supplementation with fish oils.", 
    "30": "The first evidence that elevation of plasma levels of cholesterol is a risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis in children came from the Bogalusa Heart Study in 1986, which reported an association between aortic fatty streaks in 3- to 26-year-old subjects and increased plasma levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The most compelling evidence of a cause-and-effect relationship has come from the multicenter cooperative study called the Pathobiological Determinants of Atherosclerosis in Youth. When the investigators examined the abdominal aorta and the right coronary artery of adolescents and young adults who had died of trauma, they found a significant relationship between the sum of the very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) plus LDL-C level and both fatty streaks and raised atherosclerotic lesions. They also found an inverse relationship between those lesions and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels. In addition, their studies showed that smoking (as assessed by the serum thiocyanate level) promotes atherogenesis in children as young as age 15 years. Thus many pediatricians have now accepted the importance of identifying children with significant hypercholesterolemia so that appropriate dietary and life-style modifications can be recommended. This is especially important because there is often a major genetic component to the hyperlipidemia seen in children.", 
    "31": "Using a fluorometric microculture cytotoxicity assay for measuring cell viability and proliferation we examine the cytotoxic effect of lovastatin on a drug sensitive myeloma cell line (RPMI 8226) and a multidrug resistant (MDR) clone (8226/Dox40), that was approximately 100-fold less sensitive to doxorubicin. The RPMI 8226 cells were sensitive to lovastatin with an IC50 of 15.8 micrograms/ml. However, the MDR subline exhibited a collateral sensitivity to lovastatin, with an IC50 of 1.7 microM, thus having a 9.3-fold greater sensitivity to lovastatin than the parental cell line. The combination of doxorubicin and lovastatin did not show any synergistic or antagonistic effects on any of the cell lines. The increased sensitivity to lovastatin of the P-gp 170-expressing MDR cells 8226/Dox40 might be part of a more general phenomenon that merits further investigation.", 
    "32": "Dietary measures, including calorie restriction and reduced fat intake, remain the mainstay of management in prevention of coronary heart disease (CHD). When this fails, drug therapy should be considered. Fibrates, a family of lipid lowering drugs, decrease plasma triglycerides and inhibit their synthesis. They are also reported to suppress cholesterol production in the liver. A disadvantage of fenofibrate is the poor solubility of the principal ingredient, with subsequent incomplete absorption after oral administration. Micronized fenofibrate, a new formulation chemically identical to the parent compound, has improved pharmacokinetic parameters which increase absorption, provide more stable plasma levels, and thus dosage can be decreased. The micronized formulation has been shown to be effective in reducing LDL cholesterol and triglycerides in patients with types IIa and IV hyperlipidemia, with increasing responsiveness to therapy in proportion to elevated baseline values of these parameters. This formulation has also been compared to simvastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor. Results of a double-blind crossover study showed that both drugs reduced plasma cholesterol levels by similar amounts, and both produced similar increases in HDL cholesterol. The micronized formulation of fenofibrate thus provides improved efficacy in the prevention of CHD. In comparison to the standard formulation, micronised fenofibrate thus provides improved efficacy in the control of dyslipidemia and the prevention of CHD.",

Reed, M.A. Daunais, J.R. Faust, and L. Liscum. 1992 J. Biol. Chem. 267: 4889-4896). Several of the mutants exhibited the same biochemical phenotype as classical Niemann-Pick type C (NPC) fibroblasts. Complementation analysis between these mutants and other cholesterol transport mutants with a variant biochemical phenotype has defined two complementation classes. One class is characterized by expression of the classical NPC phenotype and may represent a true cholesterol transport mutant, while the second is characterized by expression of a variant NPC phenotype and may represent a signaling defect in LDL-sensitive homeostatic responses.", 
    "34": "Hepatic VLDL overproduction in familial combined hyperlipidaemia (FCH) may delay the clearance of atherogenic apolipoprotein (apo) B containing particles. We investigated if normalization of fasting plasma triglycerides (TG) by hypolipidaemic treatment results in improved metabolism of apo B48 and apo B100 in six male subjects with FCH and compared them to six normolipidaemic controls. The FCH patients were studied before (TG, 5.2 +/- 1.2 mmol l-1; mean +/- SEM) and after therapy (TG, 2.1 +/- 0.3 mmol l-1) with either simvastatin (n = 4) or combined therapy with gemfibrozil (n = 2). The postprandial changes of apo B100 and apo B48 were studied after a single oral fat meal (24 h; 50 gram fat m-2). Changes in triglyceride rich particles (TRP; d < 1.006 g ml-1) and remnant fractions (REM; d:1.006-1.019 g ml-1) of apo B were quantitated by scanning silverstained SDS-PAGE (4-15%). Apo B48 in fasting TRP in untreated and treated FCH was 15% and 14% of total apo B, and 6% in controls (P < 0.05). In controls, postprandial B48 increased maximally at 4 h by 81% in TRP and by 137% in REM compared to baseline. In treated FCH, the postprandial apo B48 pattern normalized in TRP compared to the untreated state. Postprandial apo B100 in controls decreased in TRP and REM by 33% and 18% (P < 0.05). In untreated and treated FCH, postprandial apo B100 remained unchanged vs. baseline in TRP and in REM suggesting hypersecretion of VLDL. The elimination of B100--assessed as area under the curve--in TRP (32.5 +/- 3.6 au.h; mean +/- SEM) and REM fractions (33.2 +/- 3.1 au.h), improved significantly after treatment (21.0 +/- 2.8 and 20.4 +/- 3.3 au.h, respectively). The apo B48 clearance in TRP fractions was improved after treatment (4.3 +/- 1.4 au.h vs. 2.9 +/- 1.2 au.h; P = 0.06), but not in REM fractions (2.8 +/- 1.0 au.h vs. 1.8 +/- 0.5 au.h; NS). In conclusion, in FCH subjects with apo B100 hypersecretion and increased fasting plasma apo B48 levels, reduction of fasting plasma TG improved, but did not normalize, TRP apo B48 and B100 metabolism. However, therapy normalized postprandial apo B100 remnant metabolism. Impaired postprandial apo B metabolism may be instrumental in the development of premature atherosclerosis in FCH subjects.", 
    "35": "Glucose intolerance or diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, obesity and hypertension may have a close interrelation based on insulin resistance. We selected 28 impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) patients with hyperlipidemia. The IGT patients demonstrated hypertriglyceridemia associated with hyperinsulinemia, a typical manifestation of insulin resistance. Administration of bezafibrate at 400 mg/day for 4 weeks to the IGT patients with hypertriglyceridemia resulted in an improvement of the plasma glucose level and insulin response to 75 g oral glucose loading associated with a concomitant decrease in non-esterified fatty acids. The ratio of the level of serum C-peptide to that of insulin after a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was augmented after 4 weeks of bezafibrate administration. However, reduction of the cholesterol level with pravastatin did not alter these parameters. These results suggest that treatment to reduce the level of serum triglycerides, but not that of cholesterol, may have a beneficial effect for improving insulin resistance even in the non-obese subjects with IGT and decreasing the risk of coronary heart disease.", 
    "36": "Sleep disturbances and decrements of daytime performance have been attributed to HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. As a rule, lipophilic compounds more readily cross the blood-brain barrier and are more likely to affect central nervous system function. The authors compared the effects of lovastatin (40 mg), a lipophilic compound, to pravastatin (40 mg), a hydrophilic compound, in a 6-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, three-way Latin square design, cross-over study on 22 men with hypercholesterolemia. Patients had LDL cholesterol of more than 165 mg/dL and triglyceride of less than 350 mg/dL after 6 weeks of a low-fat (< 30%), low-cholesterol (< 300 mg/day) diet. Compared with placebo, there were no significant effects of lovastatin or pravastatin on the following subjective and polysomnographic sleep measures: changes in total sleep time, time in each sleep stage, sleep efficiency, sleep latency, REM density, REM activity, and number of arousals. Similarly, there were no effects of the two drugs on measures of cognitive performance. A significant increase in the duration of nocturnal tumescence (NPT) was observed after 2 weeks of treatment with both study drugs. This effect was not significant after 6 weeks of treatment. Both lovastatin and pravastatin caused significant (P < .05 compared with placebo) decreases in total cholesterol (by 20.9 and 20.6%, respectively), LDL cholesterol (by 27.8 and 29.9%), and triglycerides (by 13.6 and 3.7%). Subjects' HDL increased by 2.3% with lovastatin (NS) and by 3.1% with pravastatin (P < .05).

    "37": "The hypolipidemic effects of fluvastatin sodium (XU 62-320, CAS 93957-55-2), a new 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, were examined. Fluvastatin sodium was administered to Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic (WHHL) rabbits, a low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor deficient animal model, for 6 weeks at doses of 12.5 mg/kg, 25 mg/kg, and 50 mg/kg. Total cholesterol levels in serum, in very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), in intermediate density lipoprotein, and in LDL decreased dose-dependently. In the 50 mg/kg group, cholesterol reduction in each of the aforementioned segments was 50%, 91%, 94% and 33%, respectively. The secretion rate of VLDL-cholesterol, as determined by intravenous injection of Triton WR-1339, also decreased in a dose-dependent manner, showing a reduction of 16% (p < 0.05) in the 50 mg/kg group. In addition, the cholesterol content of newly-secreted VLDL also decreased dose-dependently. These results indicate that fluvastatin sodium has a potent hypolipidemic effect, and suggest that one of the mechanisms responsible for the reduction of serum cholesterol may be the suppression of VLDL-cholesterol secretion.",

This report is limited to the lovastatin component of the trial. Daily aspirin (81 mg/d) was recommended for everyone. Enrollment included 919 asymptomatic men and women, 40 to 79 years old, with early carotid atherosclerosis as defined by B-mode ultrasonography and LDL cholesterol between the 60th and 90th percentiles. The 3-year change in mean maximum intimal-medial thickness (IMT) in 12 walls of the carotid arteries was the primary outcome; change in single maximum IMT and incidence of major cardiovascular events were secondary outcomes. LDL cholesterol fell 28%, from 156.6 mg/dL at baseline to 113.1 mg/dL at 6 months (P < .0001), in the lovastatin groups and was largely unchanged in the lovastatin-placebo groups. Among participants not on warfarin, regression of the mean maximum IMT was seen after 12 months in the lovastatin group compared with the placebo group; the 3-year difference was statistically significant (P = .001). A larger favorable effect of lovastatin was observed for the change in single maximum IMT but was not statistically significant (P = .12). Five lovastatin-treated participants suffered major cardiovascular events--coronary heart disease mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, or stroke--versus 14 in the lovastatin-placebo groups (P = .04).

When Hs578T cells were depleted of serum their proliferation was drastically retarded. This was partially counteracted by insulin or IGF-1 but not by EGF. However, if the activity of HMG-CoA reductase was inhibited, there was a significant increase in DNA synthesis of EGF-treated cells. This effect was not seen in cells stimulated by insulin or IGF-1, and was prevented by addition of mevalonate.

The study population are the 17,244 respondents to the 1991 questionnaire in which questions on drug utilization were asked for the first time. It comprises 40.5% of the men and 32% of the women of the population originally targeted in 1989, i.e. the entire workforce of a national company within an age range of 35-45 years for men and 35-50 years for women. Self-reported health events and drug use over the previous year were measured. Overall 1 year prevalence of use of lipid lowering drugs was 7.7% (9.5% in men and 2.7% in women). Most antihyperlipidemics were fibrates (n = 878), with fenofibrate ranking above ciprofibrate, as opposed to HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (n = 436), principally simvastatin. Only 60% of antihyperlipidemic drug users were following a prescribed lipid-lowering diet; over half were taking other drugs concomitantly, most often b-blockers. The simvastatin group differs from the fibrate group by an excess of prevalent thyroid disease. The link between simvastatin and thyroid disease may be indication-related. In conclusion, the relevant features of this study are the extensive use of antihyperlipidemics, frequently, without concomitant diet, and the marked preference for antihyperlipidemics for which long term safety is unknown. Extent of use and choices of antihyperlipidemics are corroborated by estimations in the general middle-aged population.",

Combination therapy was more effective than pravastatin monotherapy in reducing levels of triglyceride (-39.3 versus -28.0%, P < 0.05) and elevating those of HDL cholesterol (+35.6 versus +16.4%, P < 0.001) and was equally effective in reducing total-cholesterol (-22.3 versus -24.9%, NS) and LDL-cholesterol (-27.1 versus -32.1%, NS) levels. Combination therapy was more effective than nicotinic acid monotherapy in reducing levels of total cholesterol (-23.8 versus -9.8%, P < 0.001), triglyceride (-39.4 versus -31.8%, P < 0.05) and LDL cholesterol (-35.7 versus -16.9%, P < 0.05) and equally effective in elevating HDL-cholesterol levels (+33.6 versus +30.8%, NS). Diabetic and non-diabetic participants responded similarly to combination therapy. Eleven patients (25%) were withdrawn from the study: nine as a result of nicotinic acid intolerance (flushing and nausea) and one through pravastatin intolerance (nausea); one patient died of a myocardial infarction. Combination therapy elevated glycosylated haemoglobin A1c levels in non-diabetic patients (5.5 to 5.8%, P < 0.001); in diabetic patients, however, the observed rise (7.4 to 7.9%) was not statistically significant. Fasting plasma glucose levels, liver function tests and levels of creatine kinase or uric acid were unaffected by either monotherapy or by combination therapy, with the exception of an elevation of the glucose level in diabetic patients receiving nicotinic acid monotherapy.",

Combination therapy is equally effective in type-II diabetic and non-diabetic people. The complementary effects of the combination therapy on lipid levels suggest that this regimen should be considered as a therapeutic option in patients with combined hyperlipidaemia who tolerate the side effects of nicotinic acid.",

The 1-methyl-3-carboxylpropyl subunit of deoxycholic acid was replaced by the 3,5-dihydroxyheptanoic acid lactone of lovastatin, and position 12-OH was esterified with 2-methylbutyric acid. Compounds 9 and 11 were evaluated for their inhibitory activity on rat liver HMG-CoA reductase, cholesterol biosynthesis in HEP G2 cells, and [3H]taurocholate uptake in rabbit brush border membrane vesicles and compared with methyl derivatives 8 and 10. The steroidal 21-CH3 group affects both activity on HMG-CoA reductase and recognition by the ileal bile acid transport system.", 
    "52": "Twelve men and thirteen women with hypercholesterolaemia participated in a 20-week controlled cross-over trial to assess the interaction between dietary fat intake, gender and an HMGCoA reductase inhibitor, simvastatin. Subjects were matched for total cholesterol, age, body mass index (BMI) and plasma triglyceride. Gender-drug interactions were noted with men demonstrating only a 27% fall in LDL cholesterol with simvastatin when consuming a high fat (40% energy) diet compared to women with a 35% fall. In men, the lowest LDL/HDL ratio was achieved with simvastatin on a low fat diet (22% energy). Gender differences in the effect of simvastatin on HDL were confined to HDL3 cholesterol, although the drug raised HDL2 in both sexes on the low fat diet. Simvastatin was responsible for an 11% increase in HDL3 cholesterol in men particularly when on a low fat diet but did not affect HDL3 in women. An important diet-drug interaction was seen in triglyceride response, with a lowering of 17%-20% only when subjects were on a low fat diet. There was a gender difference in response to dietary fat change with men demonstrating a 19% decrease in triglycerides with dietary fat reduction while on simvastatin, whereas women showed a 9% increase which did not reach significance. Men also responded more favourably to dietary fat reduction with at least two-fold greater falls in plasma cholesterol than was seen in women.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "53": "When bovine endothelial cells isolated from carotid arteries were cultured with a low density lipoprotein(LDL)-deficient serum for 2 days, their intracellular free cholesterol levels decreased. Under this condition, exposure of the endothelial cells to simvastatin and pravastatin, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors used clinically, resulted in further decrease in the free cholesterol levels. The migration activity was enhanced in the cells cultured with the LDL-deficient serum and it was more enhanced in the cells treated with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors under the LDL-deficient serum condition. These results suggest that cholesterol plays a negative role in wound healing in arterial walls and acts as one of the risk factors for arteriosclerosis.", 
    "54": "The hydrophilic HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor pravastatin is not taken up via a carrier-mediated system into Hep G2 cells. Therefore, Hep G2 cells are not a good model for human hepatocytes with respect to elucidation of the effect of hydrophilic HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors. Sulfobromophthalein (BSP), on the other hand, is taken up into Hep G2 cells by carrier systems with Km and Vmax values almost identical to freshly isolated hepatocytes. These results indicate that the hepatocellular BSP transporting proteins expressed in Hep G2 cells (bilitranslocase and BSP/bilirubin binding protein) are not involved in the hepatocellular uptake of pravastatin. In contrast to the hepatocellular sodium-taurocholate cotransporter, which is not functioning in Hep G2 cells, we found a saturable transport of cholate with Km and Vmax values identical to those in cultured rat hepatocytes in the presence of sodium.", 
    "55": "It has yet to be established whether substantial reduction of plasma lipids will lead to retardation, and to what extent and how quickly, of diffuse and focal coronary atheroma. The Multicentre Anti-Atheroma Study (MAAS) is a randomised double-blind clinical trial of 381 patients with coronary heart disease assigned to treatment with diet and either simvastatin 20 mg daily or placebo for 4 years. Patients on simvastatin had a 23% reduction in serum cholesterol, a 31% reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and a 9% increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol compared with placebo over 4 years. Quantitative coronary angiography was done at baseline, and after 2 and 4 years. 167 patients (89%) on placebo and 178 (92%) on simvastatin had baseline and follow-up angiograms. In the placebo group there were reductions in mean lumen diameter (-0.08 mm) and in minimum lumen diameter (-0.13 mm). Treatment effects were +0.06 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.10) and +0.08 mm (0.03 to 0.14) for mean and minimum lumen diameter, respectively (combined p = 0.006). Patients on placebo had an increase in mean diameter stenosis of 3.6% and the treatment effect of simvastatin was -2.6% (-4.4 to -0.8). Treatment effects were observed regardless of diameter stenosis at baseline. On a per-patient basis, angiographic progression occurred less often in the simvastatin group, 41 versus 54 patients; and regression was more frequent, 33 versus 20 patients (combined p = 0.02). Significantly more new lesions and new total occlusions developed in the placebo group, 48 versus 28, and 18 versus 8, respectively. There was no difference in clinical outcome. The numbers of patients who died or had a myocardial infarction were 16 and 14 in the placebo and simvastatin groups, respectively. In the placebo group more patients underwent coronary angioplasty or re-vascularisation, 34 versus 23 on simvastatin. The trial showed that 20 mg simvastatin daily over 4 years reduces hyperlipidaemia and slows progression of diffuse and focal coronary atherosclerosis.", 
    "56": "The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, lovastatin, is known to induce asymptomatic liver dysfunction in a few patients. We report the case of an adult who suffered from clinical hepatitis three months after the onset of lovastatin administration. Manifestations included asthenia, jaundice, and increased aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase activities. Histologic examination showed centrilobular necrosis, centrilobular cholestasis, and infiltrates with mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cells, including eosinophils. Withdrawal of lovastatin was followed by complete normalization of liver tests within two months.", 
    "57": "Eleven polymorphic DNA markers were mapped to rat Chromosome (Chr) 3 by linkage analysis of F2 progeny of F344/N and LEW/N rat strains. The markers, including seven genes and four anonymous loci, formed a single linkage group covering approximately 112 cM with the following order: Ptgs1 (prostaglandin G/H synthase I)-D3Arb178-Scn2a (sodium channel, type II, alpha-polypeptide)-D3Arb1-Cat (catalase)-Bdnf (brain-derived neurotropic factor)-D3Arb219-D3Arb2-Sus2 (seminal vesicle secretion II protein)-Sdc4 (ryudocan/syndecan4)-Stn1 (statin-like protein). Eight of these markers were analyzed for polymorphisms in 14 additional inbred rat strains. Three to five alleles were detected for each marker, suggesting that they are highly polymorphic and useful for genetic mapping studies with inbred rat strains. Chromosomal syntenic conservation among rats, mice and humans is also discussed.", 
    "58": "Biliary lipid composition and secretion were assessed in nine human subjects in four randomly ordered 3- to 4-week treatment periods during which they took 0 (base line), 20, 40 and 80 mg/day of lovastatin. The mean secretion of cholesterol was lower than base line for each of the three doses but the change reached statistical significance only for the 40- and 80-mg/day doses (P = .004 and .001, respectively). The mean secretion of bile acid and phospholipid was unchanged by any dose of lovastatin. The cholesterol saturation index and molar percent cholesterol in gallbladder bile were both significantly reduced by all doses of lovastatin (P = .001 to .008). For both cholesterol secretion and saturation index, increasing the dose from 20 to 40 mg/day caused an additional incremental reduction but increasing it from 40 to 80 mg/day had no additional effect. This finding suggests that any clinical trial of lovastatin for the treatment or prevention of gallstones would best be carried out with a dose of 40 mg/day. Studies performed in a subset of four subjects revealed that time-course changes in the saturation index and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were similar and reached plateaus by 1 week after 80 mg/day of lovastatin was either started or stopped.", 
    "59": "3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, pravastatin (Pr) and simvastatin (Si), suppressed 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH)-induced colon cancer development in female ICR mice. All mice received an i.p. injection of 10 mg DMH/kg body wt once weekly for 15 weeks. Pr was administered at 0.01, 0.005 and 0.001% levels in drinking water, and Si at 0.01 and 0.002% levels in the diet. All animals had access to Pr or Si throughout the experiments which were terminated at weeks 25 or 30. Histologically most of the tumors were well-differentiated adenocarcinomas. The incidence of colon tumors examined at weeks 25 or 30 was reduced by 67% in the 0.01% Pr group, by 30% in the 0.005% Pr and 0.01% Si groups, and by 24% in the 0.001% Pr and 0.002% Si groups, compared with their respective controls. However, the differences did not reach statistical significance. The number of tumors per mouse was significantly reduced in all groups administered Pr and Si except the 0.001% Pr group as compared to their respective controls. The results from those three independent experiments seem to suggest that HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may prevent colon tumorigenesis in laboratory animal model.", 
    "60": "A 1-year prospective study was conducted in 475 hypercholesterolaemic men and women who received simvastatin monotherapy 10-40 mg daily for 3 months followed by additional lipid-lowering medication after this period, if necessary, to reach a target of plasma cholesterol < 5.3 mmol/l. Of these, 403 subjects completed 1 year of follow-up. By the end of the 3-month monotherapy period, the following percentage mean changes were seen (with 95% confidence intervals): total cholesterol (TC) -31% (-30 to -32%), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol -39% (-38 to -40%), triglycerides -14% (-11 to -17%) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol +12% (+11 to +14%). These levels were maintained for the remainder of the study. When subjects with a baseline TC of 6.5-7.8 mmol/l were considered (n = 89), 42.7% achieved the target TC levels on simvastatin monotherapy alone. Additional hypolipidaemic medication had no significant impact on plasma lipid and lipoprotein levels. Simvastatin was well tolerated both as monotherapy and in combination.", 
    "61": "Lovastatin was used to study the role of isoprenylated proteins on stimulus-induced increase of cytosolic Ca2+ in retinoic acid-differentiated U937 and HL-60 cells. Preincubation of the cells with lovastatin for 11-24 h reduced the Ca(2+)-influx induced by PAF of FMLP. The maximal decrease was 60% in U937 cells and 40% in HL-60 cells. The ID50s of lovastatin in U937 and HL-60 cells were 5 microM and 15 microM, respectively. Lovastatin did not inhibit Ca(2+)-discharge from intracellular stores. Addition of mevalonate to lovastatin-treated cells completely reversed the inhibition of PAF- and FMLP-stimulated Ca(2+)-mobilization. Immunoreactivity of ras-like proteins was decreased in membranes and increased in the cytosol of U937 cells by 1 day treatment with lovastatin. We conclude that isoprenylated proteins are involved in the regulation of receptor-stimulated Ca(2+)-entry of differentiated HL-60 and U937 cells.", 
    "62": "Hyperlipidemias, and notably hypercholesterolemia, represent important risk factors for atherosclerotic vascular disease. The enzymatic inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, a selective and specific key enzyme involved in endogenous cholesterol synthesis, cause a significant mean reduction in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, both in familial and nonfamilial hypercholesterolemic forms. It has been hypothesized that these compounds might interfere with vitamin D endogenous synthesis secondarily to their effects on cholesterol. To verify this hypothesis, we studied 14 hypercholesterolemic patients treated as follows: 4 weeks of low-lipid, fiber-rich diet followed by 8 weeks of pravastatin treatment at the oral evening dose of 20 mg/d and by a 1-month washout period. No significant changes in serum calcium, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D were noticed; on the contrary, significant (P < 0.01) reductions in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol and a significant (P < 0.05) increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were observed. After the final 1-month washout period, all values returned to baseline levels. In conclusion, our study confirms the clinical efficacy of pravastatin on lipid fractions and demonstrates the absence of any interference on the circulating levels of the main vitamin D metabolites.", 
    "63": "The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term efficacy and tolerability of pravastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, in elderly patients with hypercholesterolemia. Pravastatin was administered for 12 months at a mean final dose of 9.9 mg/d to 208 elderly patients (mean [+/- SD] age, 70 +/- 7 years) with levels of total serum cholesterol greater than 5.69 mmol/L. The mean total cholesterol level was significantly decreased from 6.85 +/- 0.80 mmol/L to 5.59 +/- 0.70 mmol/L after 3 months, and this decrease was maintained thereafter. A similar change was observed in the mean serum level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Although the mean serum level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in all the patients did not change significantly, the level in 34 patients with a value lower than 1.03 mmol/L was significantly increased after 3 months and thereafter. The serum level of triglycerides in all patients was significantly decreased after 3 months and thereafter and the decrease was more marked in 101 patients with levels greater than 1.73 mmol/L. In 168 elderly patients receiving 10 mg/d of pravastatin, there were significant negative correlations between the percent decrease in total cholesterol and both baseline total serum cholesterol level (r = -.354, P < 0.001) and age (r = -.208, P = 0.007). No serious side effects were observed. These results indicate that long-term administration of pravastatin is beneficial in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia in elderly patients.", 
    "64": "The rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, is regulated at a number of levels. One important mechanism is regulation of the half-life of the protein by a controlled proteolytic system. This comes about in response to downstream products of the sterol biosynthetic pathway. Little is known about this system, including where in the cell this regulated degradation occurs. HMG CoA reductase resides in the endoplasmic reticulum. To localize the site of regulated degradation of HMG CoA reductase, we used a construct that fuses the N-terminal membrane-anchoring domain of HMG CoA reductase in-frame with beta-galactosidase as a reporter domain (HM-Gal). HM-Gal has previously been shown to reproduce faithfully the degradative properties of native HMG CoA reductase (Chun et al. (1990) J. Biol. Chem. 265, 22004-22010). CHO cells transfected with DNA encoding HM-Gal were exposed to mevalonic acid, which enhances the rate of HMG CoA reductase degradation several fold, and leads to the reduction of the steady state levels of HM-Gal by 80-90%. To accumulate HMG CoA reductase at the site of degradation, cells were simultaneously treated with N-acetyl-leucyl-leucyl-norleucinal (ALLN), which inhibits the protease responsible for reductase degradation. HM-Gal was localized morphologically by immunofluorescence and biochemically by measuring beta-galactosidase activity in Percoll gradients of cellular homogenates. Using either technique HM-Gal localization was indistinguishable from that of ER markers in both control cells and in cells treated to accumulate HMG CoA reductase at the site of degradation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "65": "Female non-insulin-dependent diabetics have a high prevalence of gallstones. Treatment of hyperlipidaemia in these patients may modify the risk. Seventeen female non-insulin-dependent diabetics (age 35-65) were treated with simvastatin (n = 10) or bezafibrate (n = 7) and had the cholesterol saturation index (CSI) of bile and gall-bladder emptying measured before and after 3 months therapy. In both groups, there was a significant reduction in serum cholesterol following treatment. The mean pretreatment cholesterol saturation indices of bile did not differ between the two groups but, after 3 months therapy, there was a highly significant difference in CSI between the bezafibrate group (2.0 +/- 0.33) and the simvastatin group (1.1 +/- 0.14) P < 0.002. Whereas the increase in the CSI (42%) observed with bezafibrate therapy was significant, the decrease in the simvastatin group (14%) was only significant in those whose pretreatment cholesterol saturation indices were elevated. Despite the differences in CSI observed between the two treatment groups, no changes in gall-bladder emptying were detected.", 
    "66": "1. In this randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, the efficacy of four dosages of fluvastatin (2.5, 5, 10 and 20 mg day-1) were assessed in 431 patients with primary hypercholesterolaemia recruited in 17 centres. 2. Following an 8-week dietary stabilisation phase and a 6-week placebo phase, the patients were randomised to receive placebo or fluvastatin 2.5, 5, 10 or 20 mg once daily at night for a period of 6 weeks. 3. Total cholesterol, beta-quant LDL-C, and the beta-quant LDL-C/HDL-C ratio were significantly reduced by all doses of fluvastatin, and HDL-C was significantly increased by the 10 mg and 20 mg doses. Fluvastatin 20 mg day-1 also significantly decreased TG and Lp(a):B levels. 4. Fluvastatin was well tolerated during the study, and relatively few biochemical or haematological abnormalities occurred. 5. Of the dosages tested, 20 mg fluvastatin day-1 is the optimal hypolipidaemic dose.", 
    "67": "1. Cholestyramine and pravastatin are two potent hypocholesterolaemic drugs which lower plasma cholesterol by increasing the clearance of low density lipoproteins by high affinity uptake mechanisms. 2. We gave heterozygous Watanabe heritable hyperlipidaemic rabbits (hz-WHHL) cholestyramine and/or pravastatin for a two week period to try and ameliorate slow clearance of chylomicron remnants, which occurs because of reduced expression of the apolipoprotein B100/E receptor. 3. In hz-WHHL rabbits the clearance of chylomicron-like lipid emulsions, traced by the decrease in plasma cholesteryl oleate radioactivity was not improved following treatment with either of the cholesterol lowering drugs. 4. In contrast, control rabbits had significantly less chylomicron-like emulsion cholesteryl-ester radioactivity remaining at each time of blood sampling. 5. Similarly, the clearance of chylomicron-like emulsion triolein was enhanced in normal rabbits receiving cholestyramine or pravastatin, whereas there was no detectable increase in clearance in hz-WHHL rabbits. 6. Combined treatment with cholestyramine and pravastatin increased the rate of receptor-mediated uptake in vivo in control rabbits but not in hz-WHHL rabbits. 7. The plasma lipid profiles of control and hz-WHHL rabbits paralleled the patterns of chylomicron-like emulsion clearance. Moderate hypertriglyceridaemia was identified in hz-WHHL rabbits compared to controls and there was no change in plasma triglyceride or cholesterol following drug therapy. In contrast, control rabbits had decreased plasma lipids following cholestyramine or pravastatin treatment. 8. It appears that therapy with lipid lowering drugs increased chylomicron remnant clearance in control rabbits by up-regulation of the apolipoprotein B100/E receptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "68": "In chronic renal failure hypertriglyceridemia is a well-known complication that persists during hemodialysis treatment: it may be one of the major risk factor for cardiovascular death in these patients. We studied the effects of two lipid lowering drugs; simvastatin (20 mg/day for six months) and probucol (500 mg/day for six months), on lipid profile in 12 hemodialysis patients. Simvastatin therapy reduced plasma total cholesterol by 26% (p > 0.002), LDL-cholesterol by 36% (p > 0.002) and triglycerides by 28% (p > 0.05): plasma HDL-cholesterol and apo-A were raised, but not significantly. Probucol therapy decreased plasma triglycerides by 38% (p > 0.05), total cholesterol by 15% and LDL-cholesterol by 19%: plasma HDL-cholesterol and apo-A were decreased but not significantly. No side effects occurred with either drug. These data suggest that in hemodialysis patients both simvastatin and probucol profoundly affect the lipid profile, as well as the triglyceride levels.", 
    "69": "The effects of acute exercise on the changes of plasma lipid profiles and peroxides, prostanoids and platelet activation in hypercholesterolemic patients before and after pravastatin 5 mg twice daily treatment for 4 weeks was studied in 30 (M/F = 21/9, age = 52 +/- 7, Mean +/- SD) patients with plasma total cholesterol level > 240 mg/dl. Pravastatin significantly reduced plasma total and low density lipoprotein cholesterol levels as expected. All patients before and after treatment and 30 healthy controls performed a treadmill exercise test using the standard Bruce protocol. The cardiac performance was similar in all groups. Treadmill exercise did not influence lipid levels after plasma volume correction. Hypercholesterolemic patients had significantly higher pre-exercise levels of malondialdehyde, thromboxane beta 2 and beta-thromboglobulin than after treatment or than pre-exercise levels in the control group. Treatment with lipid lowering drug pravastatin lowered the levels of these three parameters. At peak exercise, superoxide dismutase activity and 6-keto-PGF1 alpha were elevated. At 10 min post exercise only malondialdehyde returned to pre-exercise levels. The superoxide dismutase, thromboxane B2 and beta-thromboglobulin remained significantly higher. In the control subjects plasma beta-thromboglobulin and thromboxane 2 returned to pre-exercise levels. These results suggest that hypercholesterolemia may induce lipid peroxidation and platelet activation in resting status. Lowering of plasma cholesterol of pravastatin causes a concomitant decrease in plasma malondialdehyde, thromboxane and beta-thromboglobulin suggesting a decrease in lipid peroxidation and platelet activation. These changes were more pronounced in the hypercholesterolemic patients. Pravastatin treatment attenuated the increase in both malondialdehyde, beta-thromboglobulin and the prostanoids, but not to the level of normal subjects.", 
    "70": "Lovastatin, an inhibitor of the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol synthesis, inhibits growth of pancreatic cancer cells. A possible mechanism of this inhibition is that lovastatin inhibits the activity of RAS protein by depleting farnesyl (an intermediate of cholesterol synthesis). The K-ras gene is frequently mutated in pancreatic cancers and RAS protein requires farnesyl to be bound to the cell membrane and thereby activated. To investigate whether lovastatin inhibition of cell growth depends upon the presence of ras mutation, codons 12/13 and 61 of ras genes were examined by the dideoxynucleotide chain-terminating method in five pancreatic cell lines (human CAPAN2, CAV, MIA Paca2, PANCi, and hamster H2T) on which lovastatin exerted a growth-inhibitory effect. These codons play a major role in tumorigenic mutation of ras genes. Lovastatin inhibited cell growth by 99% (MIA), 97% (H2T), 78% (CAV), 41% (CAPAN2), and 23% (PANC1), respectively, when cells were treated with 2.5 micrograms/ml lovastatin for 6 days. Activating point mutations were found in codon 12 of the K-ras gene (wild type:GGT) in MIA (GTT), H2T (GAT), CAPAN2 (TGT), and PANC1 (GAT) but not in CAV. In addition, the CAV cell line did not have a mutation in either H- or N-ras genes. Lovastatin inhibited the growth of CAV cells even though this cell line did not have ras mutation, suggesting that lovastatin inhibition of pancreatic cancer cell growth is not directly dependent on the presence of ras mutation.", 
    "71": "Intake of lovastatin, an inhibitor of endogenous cholesterol synthesis, leads to a compensatory increase in the uptake of cholesterol from plasma (low density lipoprotein endocytosis). The drug might exert effects also by facilitating uptake of fatty acids carried in low density lipoprotein. It has been reported that dietary fat may alter physical properties of erythrocytes as well as adrenergic effects in heart muscle. We have therefore studied osmotic fragility of erythrocytes and inotropic and lusitropic responses of isolated heart papillary muscles taken from rats fed for 3 weeks either a purified high fat diet (olive oil/coconut oil 16 g/6 g/100 g diet), prepared plus and minus lovastatin, or similar diets in which 4 g/100 g diet of the olive oil was replaced by cod liver oil. Three weeks feeding of a high fat diet containing cod liver oil did not affect osmotic fragility of erythrocytes or indices of inotropy or lusitropy in papillary muscles in response to noradrenaline stimulation neither in the absence nor in the presence of lovastatin. In contrast, purified high fat diet lacking cod liver oil increased osmotic fragility in a fraction of the erythrocytes. When lovastatin was added to this diet the osmotic fragility was increased for the whole population of erythrocytes. In this situation the \"relaxation-onset index\"--an index of early relaxation in the papillary muscles--was shifted to higher concentrations of noradrenaline. Thus, intake of lovastatin may lead to an early appearance of effects of dietary fat on osmotic fragility of erythrocytes and on heart muscle responses to catecholamines. These effects of lovastatin are, however, apparently dependent upon the kind of dietary fat as they are prevented by the presence of cod liver oil.", 
    "72": "Isoprenylated proteins are believed to play an important role in DNA synthesis and subsequent cell cycle progression. Inhibition of the biosynthesis of these isoprenylated proteins results in a decrease in DNA synthesis and a characteristic G1 blockade of the cell cycle. This inhibition can be achieved by incubation of cells in the presence of a hydroxy-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitor (lovastatin) and can be reversed by addition of exogenous mevalonate. When incubated in the presence of lovastatin, L1210 wild-type cells are not inhibited at G1 but rather progress to a G2/M blockade, which is reversible with exogenous mevalonate. Thymidine incorporation has also shown that DNA synthesis is occurring until this blockade is achieved. However, when L1210 cells resistant to cisplatin are incubated in the presence of lovastatin, the characteristic G1 cell cycle blockade and DNA synthesis inhibition occur. The understanding of this mechanism and the role that isoprenylated proteins play in the regulation of DNA synthesis and cell cycle progression may gain great insight into the abnormal control of the cancer cell.", 
    "73": "Three branch-point enzymes of the mevalonate pathway, farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, cis-prenyltransferase and squalene synthase were characterized in rat hepatic cytosol, microsomes and peroxisomes isolated from rats after treatment with peroxisome proliferators, inducers of the endoplasmic reticulum or modulators of lipid metabolism. Cholestyramine and phenobarbital induced primarily the cytosolic farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase, whereas clofibrate and phthalates elevated the corresponding peroxisomal activity. cis-Prenyltransferase activities in microsomes were induced 4-5-fold after clofibrate, phthalate and phenobarbital administration, but these same treatments affected the peroxisomal activity to only a limited extent. Squalene synthase activity in microsomes was completely abolished, but the peroxisomal activity was unaffected after administration of cholesterol. On the other hand, clofibrate and phthalate induced only the microsomal activities. Mevinolin treatment greatly increased peroxisomal and cytosolic farnesyl pyrophosphate synthase activities, but not the mitochondrial activity, and the cis-prenyltransferase activities were elevated in peroxisomes, but not in microsomes. These results demonstrate that the branch-point enzymes in cholesterol and dolichol biosynthesis at various cellular locations are regulated differentially and that the capacities of peroxisomes and the endoplasmic reticulum to participate in the synthesis of polyisoprenoid lipids is affected profoundly by treatment with different xenobiotics.", 
    "74": "Normolipidemic rats were treated with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (lovastatin or pravastatin) for periods of 1-3 days. Administration of these drugs reduced plasma triacylglycerol levels. Lovastatin-treated rats displayed a 30% lower hepatic triacylglycerol secretion rate compared to controls as estimated using Triton WR-1339. Lovastatin in a dose of 0.1% in the diet for 3 days increased hepatic phosphatidate phosphohydrolase (PAP) activity 2- to 3-fold, both in the cytosolic and microsomal fractions. Similar effects were seen in the presence of 0.2% pravastatin. PAP in both fractions was stimulated to a lesser extent by treatment with 0.1% pravastatin. These differences in PAP activity obtained by different treatment regimens were preserved during purification of cytosolic PAP on hydroxylapatite. The increase in PAP activity upon treatment with lovastatin or pravastatin was gradual and occurred simultaneously with the apparent increase in HMG-CoA reductase activity. In rats treated with the reductase inhibitors, the activity of microsomal and cytosolic PAP was inversely correlated to plasma triacylglycerol levels. The results indicate that hepatic triacylglycerol and cholesterol synthesis might be co-ordinately regulated, and also suggest that the activity of PAP is rapidly modulated in concert with changes in plasma triacylglycerol levels.", 
    "75": "The efficacy and safety of treatment with recommended doses of lovastatin (20, 40 and 80 mg/day) and pravastatin (10, 20 and 40 mg/day) were compared in 48 men and women with primary hyperlipidemia and LDL-cholesterol > or = 4.1 mmol/l following dietary intervention. Each dose was taken for six weeks in this double-blind, parallel, randomized study. Lovastatin was found to reduce LDL-cholesterol by 22-37% and pravastatin by 18-26%. HDL-cholesterol levels increased and triglyceride levels decreased to the same extent in both groups. The number of patients who reported adverse events in the course of the study was small. No clinically significant changes occurred in laboratory tests, nor in sleep scores obtained from a standardized questionnaire. Neither drug had any effect on the responses to a quality of life screening questionnaire, nor were any significant changes in depressive symptoms seen during the 18 weeks of treatment.", 
    "76": "Acute rhabdomyolysis is caused by HMG-CoA reductase (HCR) inhibitors clinically and experimentally. To study the mechanism of muscle cell damage, we investigated the change in the cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in L6 rat myoblasts stimulated with three kinds of HCR inhibitors: simvastatin, simvastatin-acid form and pravastatin. Simvastatin and simvastatin-acid form induced an increase in [Ca2+]i through two different pathways, namely, the Ca2+ release from intracellular stores and the Ca2+ influx from extracellular solution. They also caused cell puncture either in the presence or absence of extracellular Ca2+. Pravastatin induced little or no change in [Ca2+]i and no cell damage resulted. Simvastatin was 10-fold more potent than simvastatin-acid form. These results suggest that the mechanism of cell damage may relate to the [Ca2+]i elevation by these drugs and may be dependent on the lipophilicity of the inhibitors.", 
    "77": "Effects of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, pravastatin and simvastatin, on mitochondrial respiration in ischemic rat liver were examined. Either vehicle, pravastatin (2 or 4 mg/kg per day), or simvastatin (1 or 2 mg/kg per day) was orally administered for 3 weeks. Liver ischemia was induced by cessation of the systemic circulation for 60 min. Liver mitochondria were isolated and the respiration was determined by polarography using glutamate and succinate as substrates. In the vehicle-treated group, ischemia drcreased ZO3, respiratory control index (RCI: QO3/QO4), and ADP/O ratio. Pretreatments with pravastatin and simvastatin enhanced the decreases in QO3 measured with either glutamate or succinate, and in ADP/O ratio measured with succinate. Because of decreasing QO4, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors did not modify the changes in RCI due to ischemia. There were no significant differences in respiratory indices between pravastatin- and simvastatin-treated groups. In conclusion, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors may enhance respiratory impairment of liver mitochondria under pathophysiological conditions, such as ischemia.", 
    "78": "We investigated the effect of the hepatic hydroxymethyl glutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor lovastatin and the primary bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) on plasma sterol and bile alcohol concentrations and the excretion of bile alcohols in urine in a 38-year-old homozygote with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). Untreated, plasma cholesterol concentrations were less than normal (171 +/- 5 v 185 +/- 3 mg/dL, P < .05) while plasma cholestanol levels were more than 20 times higher than the control mean (2.26 +/- 0.17 v 0.1 +/- 0.1 mg/dL, P < .0001). Plasma and urinary bile alcohol concentrations were markedly increased (12.6 +/- 0.6 and 154 micrograms/mL, respectively, v trace amounts in controls), with the ratio of 5 beta-cholestane-3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha, 25-tetrol to 5 beta-cholestane, 3 alpha,7 alpha,12 alpha,23 (22 and 24),25-pentols being 1.6 in plasma and reversed to 0.15 in urine. Treatment with lovastatin (40 mg/d) reduced plasma cholesterol concentrations 13%, but failed to decrease plasma cholestanol or bile alcohol levels. Abundant amounts of bile alcohols continued to be excreted in urine. In contrast, CDCA (750 mg/d) inhibited abnormal bile acid synthesis, as evidence by a 17-fold decrease in total bile alcohol levels in plasma and a 29-fold decrease in urine and the virtual elimination of cholic acid and deoxycholic acid from the bile. Plasma cholestanol concentrations also decreased 85%, but cholesterol levels increased 14%. The combination of CDCA with lovastatin did not improve plasma cholestanol or bile alcohol concentrations compared with CDCA treatment alone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "79": "The 10-kb deletion (\"French Canadian mutation\") of the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene is the most common mutation causing familial hypercholesterolemia among subjects of French Canadian descent. In affected subjects, it results in a null allele of the LDL receptor gene and provides a unique opportunity to examine single-allele regulation of this gene in humans. We sought to ascertain the response of inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase in subjects with the French Canadian mutation of the LDL receptor gene and to correlate this response with biochemical variables and the haplotype of the nondeletion LDL receptor allele. The prevalence of non-responders to high doses of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (defined as < 15% decrease in LDL cholesterol [LDL-C] from baseline values after dietary intervention) was ascertained in 105 patients heterozygous for the 10-kb deletion after excluding first-degree relatives and those on combined lipid-lowering therapy or other lipid-lowering agents. Lipoprotein cholesterol levels were examined after a diet period (30% calories as fat) and after receiving HMG CoA reductase inhibitors as mono-therapy for a minimum of 3 months. The mean reduction in total cholesterol was 45 +/- 23%, in LDL-C 33 +/- 15%, and in triglycerides 32 +/- 49% (all P < .005). There was a slight increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol of 8.5 +/- 18% (P > .05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "80": "HMG-CoA reductase (HCR) inhibitors are effective cholesterol-lowering agents in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Using intracellular microelectrodes, we studied the pathomechanism of myotonia experimentally induced in rabbits by HCR inhibitors, simvastatin, and pravastatin. The external intercostal muscle of rabbits showed some electrophysiologic characteristics of myotonia including repetitive firing after administration of simvastatin (50 mg/kg per day, for 4 weeks). The relative chloride conductance, though reduced in both, was more affected in simvastatin-administered muscles. In normal muscles perfused with a solution containing the inhibitors, both simvastatin and pravastatin produced membrane hyperexcitability with repetitive firing similar to that seen in simvastatin-administered rabbits. The minimum concentrations required to cause repetitive firing was 0.3 mg/L for simvastatin and 30 mg/L for pravastatin. These results indicate that HCR inhibitors induce some characteristics of myotonia by blocking the chloride channel in the muscle membrane.", 
    "81": "Acute renal failure can occur in cardiac transplant patients for a variety of reasons. A case of a patient who developed acute renal failure secondarily to drug-induced rhabdomyolysis is reported. The literature regarding acute renal failure and lovastatin and other 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors is reviewed. The potential mechanisms of myoglobinuria and nephrotoxicity and the therapeutic implications are discussed.", 
    "82": "To assess the relationship between cholesterol synthesis and feedback inhibition of bile acid synthesis, we studied seven normal human subjects taking three different doses of chenodiol, 0, 5, and 15 mg/kg per day: once while taking no lovastatin and again while taking lovastatin 80 mg/day. Lovastatin and both doses of chenodiol significantly lowered bile acid synthesis measured by the 14CO2 method, but there was no significant interaction between the perturbations. Both also lowered cholesterol saturation index of gallbladder bile without appreciable interaction, and the combination was distinctly more effective than either medication alone. Lovastatin and low-dose chenodiol both lowered biliary cholesterol secretion without affecting bile acid secretion. Increasing the dose of chenodiol did not further lower cholesterol secretion, but did further reduce saturation index because of an increase in secretion of bile acid and phospholipid. These studies indicate that there is no interaction between cholesterol synthesis and feedback return of bile acid in the enterohepatic circulation with respect to either bile acid synthesis or biliary lipid secretion; that the combination of chenodiol and lovastatin is better than either alone for improving biliary cholesterol saturation; and that the mechanism by which chenodiol lowers cholesterol saturation is dose-dependent.", 
    "83": "A series of oxolanosterol oximes and oxime ethers have been prepared as potential dual-action inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis. The synthesis of these oximes along with the evaluation of their ability to inhibit lanosterol 14 alpha-methyl demethylase (P450DM) and to suppress 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme. A reductase (HMGR) activity is presented. 3 beta-Hydroxylanost-7-en-15-one 15-oxime XIX was found to be an effective inhibitor of P450DM in rat liver microsomal preparations. In [14C]acetate incorporation studies using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, compound XIX was found to cause a dramatic reduction in the incorporation of acetate into C27 sterols with a concomitant increase in radiolabeled C30 sterols which is consistent with the inhibition of P450DM. In addition, 15-oxime XIX was shown to suppress HMGR activity in both wild-type CHO and P450DM-deficient (AR45) cells, indicating that suppression of HMGR is independent of any effects of this oxime on P450DM. In both cell lines, parallel declines in HMGR activity and HMGR protein levels were observed suggesting that compound XIX suppresses HMGR activity by regulation of gene expression. These results demonstrate that, as predicted, 15-oxime XIX is indeed a dual-action inhibitor of cholesterol biosynthesis which causes both the inhibition of P450DM and a reduction in HMGR activity.", 
    "84": "The role of inhibition of prelamin A processing in the inhibition of DNA synthesis by lovastatin was examined by expressing prelamin A in F9 teratocarcinoma cells. These cells, normally lacking expression of the A/C lamins, were transfected with constructs expressing either prelamin A or mature lamin A and the effect of lovastatin on DNA biosynthesis was assessed. It was found that expression of prelamin A specifically conferred sensitivity to inhibition of DNA biosynthesis by lovastatin on F9 cells.", 
    "85": "Treatments by oral administration of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) alone, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG) CoA reductase inhibitor (pravastatin) alone, and combination of the two drugs were attempted for 7 patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). CDCA treatment at a dose of 300 mg/day reduced serum cholestanol (67.3% reduction), lathosterol (50.8%), campesterol (61.7%) and sitosterol (12.7%). However, the sera of the patients changed to be \"atherogenic\"; total cholesterol, triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol were increased, while high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol was decreased. Contrarily, pravastatin at a dose of 10 mg/day improved the sera of the patients to be markedly \"anti-atherogenic\", but the reductions of cholestanol (30.4%), lathosterol (44.0%), campesterol (22.9%) and sitosterol (9.6%) were inadequate. Combined treatment with CDCA and pravastatin showed good overlapping of the effects of each drug alone. The sera of the patients were apparently more \"anti-atherogenic\" than those after CDCA treatment. Serum cholestanol concentration was still 2.7 times higher than in controls, but the serum lathosterol level was within the normal range, indicating that the enhancement of overall cholesterol synthesis in the patients was sufficiently suppressed. Plant sterol levels were also within the normal range. The combination of CDCA and pravastatin was a good treatment for CTX, based on the improvement of serum lipoprotein metabolism, the suppression of cholesterol synthesis, and reductions of cholestanol and plant sterol levels. In all of 7 patients, the progression of disease was arrested, but dramatic effects on clinical manifestations, xanthoma, and electrophysiological findings could not be found after the treatment of these drugs.", 
    "86": "The hypolipidaemic agent pravastatin differs from other US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (e.g. lovastatin and simvastatin) because it has greater hydrophilicity, as a result of the hydroxyl group attached to its decalin ring. The hydrophilic nature of pravastatin accounts for its minimal penetration into the intracellular space of nonhepatic tissues, including an apparent inability to cross the blood-brain barrier. The drug is also well tolerated because it is rapidly absorbed and excreted, and does not accumulate in plasma even with repeated administration. Pravastatin is taken up into the liver by an active transport carrier system, and the hepatic extraction ratio is high (0.66). The drug and its metabolites are cleared through both hepatic and renal routes (53 and 47%, respectively). The dual route of elimination reduces the need for dosage adjustment if the function of either of these organs is impaired. Dosage adjustments are also not required on the basis of age or gender. Furthermore, the drug can be given without regard to food intake, an important consideration for compliance since lipid-lowering therapy is generally required long term. The drug is approximately 50% protein bound, and, therefore, compared with other members of its class the tendency for displacement of highly protein bound drugs such as warfarin is decreased. This minimal potential for drug-drug interactions is important for patients who are taking multiple drugs because of concomitant medical problems. However, as with any HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, caution should be exercised when pravastatin is given with nicotinic acid (niacin), gemfibrozil or cyclosporin, because of increased risk for myopathy in patients receiving combination therapy.", 
    "87": "Puromycin-induced nephrotic syndrome is an animal model of progressive renal disease. Both angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and lipid-lowering agents have been used to preserve renal structure and function in this model, although neither completely prevents progression. We tested the hypothesis that the combination of the two agents would be more protective than either alone. Rats were divided into five groups; all were uninephrectomized. Four groups were given puromycin at a dose of 10 mg/100 g body weight (BW) with additional doses of 4 mg/100 g BW given intraperitoneally at 4, 5, and 6 weeks thereafter. One group was given enalapril (EN) 50 mg/l dissolved in the drinking water; the second received lovastatin (L) 15 mg/kg given daily by gavage; the third received both agents; the fourth was left untreated, and the final group received no puromycin and served as the control group. Eight weeks after the initial dose of puromycin, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), as inulin clearance, and protein excretion were determined and blood was collected for cholesterol and triglycerides. Blood pressure was not different between any of the groups. At the end of the study period, serum cholesterol [mean +/- SD, 252 +/- 185 mg/dl (L), 135 +/- 101 mg/dl (L + EN)] and triglycerides (239 +/- 200, 148 +/- 158 mg/dl) were significantly lower (P < 0.001) in the lovastatin-treated groups than in the untreated puromycin group (535 +/- 255 mg/dl and 579 +/- 561 mg/dl, cholesterol and triglyceride, respectively).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)", 
    "88": "A series of disubstituted thiazoles, functionalized with the essential 3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoic or heptanoic chain, were prepared and evaluated for their ability to inhibit the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase in vitro. All the synthesized compounds 46-61 showed a moderate inhibitory potency.", 
    "89": "Niacin and lovastatin are both effective drugs for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and are among the drugs of first choice recommended by the adult treatment panel. To date, however, no studies have directly compared the lipoprotein-modifying effects and safety of lovastatin and niacin across their usual dosage range in patients with primary hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "90": "The efficacy and safety of lovastatin and niacin were compared in a controlled, randomized, open-label study of 26 weeks' duration that was conducted at five lipid clinics. One hundred thirty-six patients with primary hypercholesterolemia participated in the study. Entry criteria were a low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level greater than 4.37 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) with coronary heart disease and/or more than two coronary heart disease risk factors or an LDL cholesterol level greater than 5.19 mmol/L (190 mg/dL) in patients without coronary heart disease or less than two coronary heart disease risk factors. The study consisted of a 4-week diet run-in period after which eligible patients were randomly assigned to receive treatment with either lovastatin (20 mg/d) or niacin (1.5 g/d) for 10 weeks. On the basis of the LDL cholesterol response and patient tolerance, the doses were sequentially increased to 40 and 80 mg/d of lovastatin or 3 and 4.5 g/d of niacin after 10 and 18 weeks of treatment, respectively.", 
    "91": "In the two patient groups, 66% of patients treated with lovastatin and 54% of patients treated with niacin underwent full dosage titration. At all time points, lovastatin was significantly (P < .01) more effective than niacin in reducing LDL cholesterol levels (26% vs 5% at week 10, 28% vs 16% at week 18, and 32% vs 23% at week 26), whereas niacin was more effective (P < .01) in increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (6% vs 20% at week 10, 8% vs 29% at week 18, and 7% vs 33% at week 26). Niacin reduced Lp(a) lipoprotein levels by 35% at week 26, whereas lovastatin had no effect. Cutaneous flushing was the most common side effect during treatment with niacin.", 
    "92": "Lovastatin and niacin both exerted favorable dose-dependent changes on the concentrations of plasma lipids and lipoproteins. Lovastatin was more effective in reducing LDL cholesterol concentrations, whereas niacin was more effective in increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations and reducing the Lp(a) lipoprotein level. Lovastatin was better tolerated than niacin, in large part because of the common cutaneous side effects of niacin."
