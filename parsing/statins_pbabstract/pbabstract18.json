Methods: The participants of the study were 16 women with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and coronary artery disease. On the basis of statin tolerance, they were divided into 2 groups. 8 patients who did not tolerate high-dose statin therapy were treated with a statin, the dose of which was reduced by half, together with ezetimibe. The remaining 8 patients tolerating the treatment continued high-dose statin therapy. Plasma lipids, serum levels of thyrotropin, free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine, as well as titers of thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies were measured at the beginning of the study and 6 months later. Results: Replacing high-dose statin therapy with ezetimibe/statin combination therapy increased serum titers of thyroid peroxidase as well as led to an insignificant increase in serum titers of thyroglobulin antibodies. At the end of the study, thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibody titers were higher in patients receiving the combination therapy than in those treated only with high-dose statin. Conclusions: Our study shows that high-dose statin therapy produces a stronger effect on thyroid autoimmunity than ezetimibe/statin combination therapy.",

    "6": "Statins can increase endothelial function through enhancement of the expression and activity of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of rosuvastatin on the number of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and endothelial expression of eNOS in monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertensive rats. Sixty Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were divided into three groups of 20: control (group A), pulmonary hypertension (PAH) + rosuvastatin group (group B), and PAH (group C). Monocrotaline (MCT; 60 mg/kg) was injected (intraperitoneally) to induce PAH. Rats in group B received rosuvastatin [10 mg/(kg. day)] for 2 weeks. Peripheral blood (5 mL) was aspirated from the femoral artery of each rat before and after 2 weeks of treatment. Mononuclear cells were isolated and subcultured to obtain EPCs. Small and moderately sized pulmonary arteries were collected 2 weeks later for histological analyses. eNOS gene expression in endothelial cells of pulmonary arteries were then determined at mRNA and protein levels. eNOS expression at mRNA and protein levels and the number of circulating EPCs were reduced significantly in groups B and C compared with group A (P less than 0.05), and a significant difference between group B and group C (P less than 0.05) was observed. Vascular remodeling in small and moderately sized pulmonary arteries was attenuated markedly in group B compared with group C. These results suggest that rosuvastatin can ameliorate the remodeling of pulmonary arteries in MCT-induced PAH rats by increasing the number of circulating EPCs and eNOS upregulation.",

The use of statins has become the standard treatment in patients with an increased risk of cardiovascular and coronary heart diseases. However, many clinical studies have shown that 13 - 75% of patients fail to achieve LDL-cholesterol and total cholesterol target levels. The clinical implications of insufficient response include cardiovascular complications caused by atherosclerosis leading to acute myocardial infarction, stroke and death. The mechanism underlying statin resistance has been associated with genetic polymorphisms and nongenetic factors (e.g. concomitant diseases, drug-drug interactions, interactions with food and dietary supplements). The article provides a comprehensive update of the current knowledge regarding the role of genetic polymorphism and non-genetic determinants of cholesterol-lowering effect of statins. Dietary aspects of statin efficacy were also presented. The Pubmed search was performed to identify relevant papers from the last ten years which were included in the review. Consideration of the genetic and non-genetic determinants of pharmacological action of statins as well as mechanisms of drug-drug interactions may be useful in clinical practice for improving safety and efficacy of statin treatment.",

    "17": "TAK-475 (lapaquistat acetate) and its active metabolite-I (TAK-475 M-I) inhibit squalene synthase, which catalyzes the conversion of farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) to squalene. FPP is a substrate for synthesis of other mevalonate-derived isoprenoids (MDIs) such as farnesol (FOH), geranlygeranyl diphosphate (GGPP), and geranylgeraniol. In patients with MKD, a rare autosomal recessive disorder, defective activity of mevalonate kinase leads to a shortage of MDIs. MDIs especially GGPP are required for prenylation of proteins, which is a posttranslation modification necessary for proper functioning of proteins like small guanosine triphosphatases. Malfunction of prenylation of proteins results in upregulation of the inflammatory cascade, leading to increased production of proinflammatory cytokines like interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), eventually leading to episodic febrile attacks. In vitro, TAK-475 M-I incubation in a concentration dependent manner increased levels of FPP, GGPP, and FOH in human monocytic THP-1 cells. In subsequent experiments, THP-1 cells or human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were incubated with simvastatin, which inhibits hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase and thereby decreases levels of the precursors of MDIs, leading to the depletion of MDIs as expected in MKD patients. Increased levels of GGPP and FPP attenuated lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced IL-1\u03b2 production in THP-1 cells and human PBMCs in statin-treated conditions. The MDIs also significantly reduced the damaged cell ratio in this active MKD-like condition. Moreover, TAK-475 M-I directly inhibited LPS-induced IL-1\u03b2 production from statin-treated THP-1 cells. These results show anti-inflammatory and cytoprotective effects of MDIs via TAK-475 M-I treatment in statin-treated immune cells, suggesting that possible therapeutic effects of TAK-475 treatment in MKD patients.",

OxLDL induced atherogenic heat shock proteins (HSP) 60 and 90 and decreased potentially atheroprotective heat shock protein 27, effects restored by atorvastatin. T cells exposed to oxLDL-treated DCs produced interferon-\u03b3 and interleukin (IL)-17. Atorvastatin and simvastatin suppressed the DC maturation showing lower expression of CD80, CD83, and CD86, and limited their production of tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6, and increased transforming growth factor-\u03b2 and IL-10 secretion. Statin-treated DCs inhibited Th1 and/or Th17 polarization by downregulation of transcriptional factors T-bet and ROR\u03b3t expression, and induced T regulatory cells with IL-10 production.

    "25": "Activation of the blood vessel endothelium is a critical step during inflammation. Endothelial cells stimulated by pro-inflammatory cytokines play an essential part in the adhesion and extravasation of circulating leukocytes into inflamed tissues. The endothelial egfl7 gene (VE-statin) represses endothelial cell activation in tumors, and prior observations suggested that it could also participate in the regulation of endothelial cell activation during inflammation. We show here that Egfl7 expression is strongly repressed in mouse lung endothelial cells during LPS- and TNF\u03b1-induced inflammation in vivo LPS have a limited effect on Egfl7 expression by endothelial cells in vitro, whereas the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF\u03b1 strongly represses Egfl7 expression in endothelial cells. TNF\u03b1 regulates the egfl7 gene promoter through regions located between -7585 and -5550 bp ahead of the main transcription start site and via an NF-\u03baB-dependent mechanism. Conversely, Egfl7 regulates the response of endothelial cells to TNF\u03b1 by restraining the induced expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and E-selectin, resulting in a decreased adhesion of leukocytes onto endothelial cells stimulated by TNF\u03b1. Egfl7 regulates the expression of these adhesion molecules through the NF-\u03baB and MEK/Erk pathways, in particular by preventing the proteasome-mediated degradation of IkB\u03b1 both in non-activated endothelial cells and during activation. Egfl7 is thus an endogenous and constitutive repressor of blood vessel endothelial cell activation in normal and inflammatory conditions and participates in a loop of regulation of activation of these cells by pro-inflammatory cytokines.",

In contrast, low-risk patients can be identified, who may proceed to intervention without additional cardiopulmonary diagnostic testing. According to evidence-based recommendations in patients at risk, statin therapy should be initiated and beta blockers should be uptitrated preoperatively.

Aims We examined the association of hyperlipidemia (HLD) combined with statin therapy on all-cause mortality in stroke patients. Methods All stroke patients in the Greater Cincinnati Northern Kentucky region of \u223c1.3 million were identified using ICD-9 discharge codes in 2005 and 2010. Stroke patients with and without HLD were categorized based on their reported statin use at baseline or discharge into three groups: no-HLD/no-statins, HLD/no-statins, and HLD/on-statins. Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the risk of mortality at 30 days, 1 year, and 3 years poststroke. Results Overall, 77% (2953) of the 3813 ischemic stroke patients were diagnosed with HLD and 72% ( n\u2009=\u20092123) of those patients were on statin medications. The mean age was 70.0\u2009\u00b1\u200914.6 years, 56% were women, and 21% were black. In adjusted analyses, the HLD/no-statins group showed 35% (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR)\u2009=\u20090.65, 95% CI: 0.46-0.92), 27% (aHR\u2009=\u20090.73, 95% CI: 0.59-0.90), and 17% (aHR\u2009=\u20090.83, 95% CI: 0.70-0.97) reduced risk of mortality at 30 days, 1 year, and 3 years, respectively, poststroke, compared with no-HLD/no-statins group. The HLD/on-statins group showed an additional 17% significant survival benefit at 3 years poststroke compared with HLD/no-statins group. Conclusions A diagnosis of HLD in ischemic stroke patients is associated with reduced short- and long-term mortality, irrespective of statin use. Statin therapy is associated with significant, additional long-term survival benefit.",

However, molecular mechanisms involved in renoprotective actions of statins have not been fully elucidated. We questioned whether statins influence development of diabetic nephropathy through reactive oxygen species, RhoA and Akt/GSK3 pathway, known to be important in renal pathology. Diabetic mice (db/db) and their control counterparts (db/+) were treated with atorvastatin (10 mg/Kg/day, p.o., for 2 weeks). Diabetes-associated renal injury was characterized by albuminuria (albumin:creatinine ratio, db/+: 3.2 \u00b1 0.6 vs. db/db: 12.5 \u00b1 3.1*; *P<0.05), increased glomerular/mesangial surface area, and kidney hypertrophy. Renal injury was attenuated in atorvastatin-treated db/db mice. Increased ROS generation in the renal cortex of db/db mice was also inhibited by atorvastatin. ERK1/2 phosphorylation was increased in the renal cortex of db/db mice. Increased renal expression of Nox4 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen, observed in db/db mice, were abrogated by statin treatment. Atorvastatin also upregulated Akt/GSK3\u03b2 phosphorylation in the renal cortex of db/db mice. Our findings suggest that atorvastatin attenuates diabetes-associated renal injury by reducing ROS generation, RhoA activity and normalizing Akt/GSK3\u03b2 signaling pathways. The present study provides some new insights into molecular mechanisms whereby statins may protect against renal injury in diabetes.",

Although the mainstay of treatment of NAFLD is weight loss, it is hard to maintain, prompting the need for pharmacotherapy as well. A greater understanding of disease pathogenesis in recent years was followed by development of new classes of medications, as well as potential repurposing of currently available agents. NAFLD therapies target four main pathways. The dominant approach is targeting hepatic fat accumulation and the resultant metabolic stress. Medications in this group include peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor agonists (eg, pioglitazone, elafibranor, saroglitazar), medications targeting the bile acid-farnesoid X receptor axis (obeticholic acid), inhibitors of de novo lipogenesis (aramchol, NDI-010976), incretins (liraglutide) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-21 or FGF-19 analogues. A second approach is targeting the oxidative stress, inflammation and injury that follow the metabolic stress. Medications from this group include antioxidants (vitamin E), medications with a target in the tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 pathway (emricasan, pentoxifylline) and immune modulators (amlexanox, cenicriviroc). A third group has a target in the gut, including antiobesity agents such as orlistat or gut microbiome modulators (IMM-124e, faecal microbial transplant, solithromycin). Finally, as the ongoing injury leads to fibrosis, the harbinger of liver-related morbidity and mortality, antifibrotics (simtuzumab and GR-MD-02) will be an important element of therapy.

Statin intolerance is understood as the inability to continue using a statin to reduce individual cardiovascular risk sufficiently, due to the development of symptoms or laboratory abnormalities attributable to the initiation or dose escalation of a statin. Muscle symptoms are the most common side effects observed. Areas covered: The main aim of this article is to present a review on published definitions of statin intolerance. In addition, a brief review on clinical aspects and risk factors of statin intolerance is provided and features for a common definition for statin intolerance are suggested. Expert opinion: A definition of statin intolerance by major drug regulatory agencies is not available. In clinical studies, different definitions are chosen and results are not comparable; different medical associations do not agree on one common definition. There is an unmet need to establish a common definition of statin intolerance to ensure an appropriate clinical use of this important drug class. Further work is required to develop a consensus definition on statin intolerance that could have significant positive impact on both research and clinical management.",

Risk stratification to predict patients at an increased risk of myocardial infarction (MI) and sudden ischemic death, and selection of patients for possible revascularization, is based on expert opinion. Randomized trials have compared optimal medical therapy to revascularization, after the coronary anatomy was known, and yet routine coronary angiography to exclude left main disease is not recommended. What exactly is optimal antianginal treatment varies considerably from one country's guideline recommendations to another. None of the antianginal drugs reduce mortality or MI and these drugs are equally effective in treating angina pectoris; and yet beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers are recommended as first line therapy. Double and triple therapy with different classes of antianginal drugs is also expert opinion based rather than evidence based. Recommendations to reduce the incidence of MI and sudden death are appropriate; however the use of a potent, high dose statin, is recommended by AHA/ACC and NICE guidelines for all patients with ischemic heart disease, while the European guidelines recommend a target LDL goal in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD).

    "94": "Statins, 3-hydroxyl-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, are the first-line medications prescribed for the prevention and treatment of coronary artery diseases. The efficacy of statins has been attributed not only to their systemic cholesterol-lowering actions but also to their pleiotropic effects that are unrelated to cholesterol reduction. These pleiotropic effects have been increasingly recognized as essential in statins therapy. This study was designed to investigate the pleiotropic actions of simvastatin, one of the most commonly prescribed statins, on macrophage cholesterol homeostasis with a focus on lysosomal free cholesterol egression. With simultaneous nile red and filipin staining, analysis of confocal/multi-photon imaging demonstrated that simvastatin markedly attenuated unesterified (free) cholesterol buildup in macrophages loaded with oxidized low-density lipoprotein but had little effect in reducing the sizes of cholesteryl ester-containing lipid droplets; the reduction in free cholesterol was mainly attributed to decreases in lysosome-compartmentalized cholesterol. Functionally, the egression of free cholesterol from lysosomes attenuated pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. It was determined that the reduction of lysosomal free cholesterol buildup by simvastatin was due to the up-regulation of Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), a lysosomal residing cholesterol transporter. Moreover, the enhanced enzymatic production of 7-hydroxycholesterol by cytochrome P450 7A1 and the subsequent activation of liver X receptor \u03b1 underscored the up-regulation of NPC1.

    "120": "Both HeFH and HoFH require dietary and lifestyle modification. Pharmacotherapy of adult HeFH patients is largely driven by the American Heart Association (AHA) algorithm. A high-potency statin is started initially with a goal low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) reduction of >50\u00a0%. The LDL-C target is adjusted to <100 or <70\u00a0mg/dL in subjects with coronary artery disease (CAD) with ezetimibe being second line. If necessary, a third adjunctive therapy, such as a PSCK9 inhibitor (not yet approved in children) or bile acid-binding resin, can be added. Finally, LDL-C apheresis can be considered in patients with LDL-C >300\u00a0mg/dL (or >200\u00a0mg/dL with significant CAD, although now approved for LDL-C as low as 160\u00a0mg/dL with CAD). Due to the early, severe LDL-C elevation in HoFH patients, concerning natural history, rarity of the condition, and nuances of treatment, all HoFH patients should be treated at a pediatric or adult center with HoFH experience. LDL-C apheresis should be considered as early as 5\u00a0years of age. However, apheresis availability and tolerability is limited and pharmacotherapy is required. Generally, the AHA algorithm with reference to the European Atherosclerosis Society Consensus Panel recommendations is reasonable with all patients initiated on high-dose, high-potency statin, ezetimibe, and bile acid-binding resins. In most, additional LDL-C lowering is required with PCSK9 inhibitors and/or lomitapide or mipomersen. Liver transplantation can also be considered at experienced centers as a last resort.", 
    "121": "Current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines for the management of patients with elevated blood cholesterol increasingly emphasize assessment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk in deciding when to initiate pharmacotherapy. The decision to treat is based primarily on mathematical integration of traditional risk factors, including age, sex, race, lipid values, systolic blood pressure, hypertension therapy, diabetes mellitus, and smoking. Advanced risk testing is selectively endorsed for patients when the decision to treat is otherwise uncertain, or more broadly interpreted as those patients who are at so-called \"intermediate risk\" of ASCVD events using traditional risk factors alone. These new guidelines also place new emphasis on a clinician-patient risk discussion, a process of shared decision making in which patient and physician consider the potential benefits of treatment, risk of adverse events, and patient preferences before making a final decision to initiate treatment. Advanced risk testing is likely to play an increasingly important role in this process as weaknesses in exclusive reliance on traditional risk factors are recognized, new non-statin therapies become available, and guidelines are iteratively updated. Comparative efficacy studies of the various advanced risk testing options suggest that coronary artery calcium scoring is most strongly predictive of ASCVD events. Most importantly, coronary artery calcium scoring appears to identify an important subgroup of patients with advanced subclinical atherosclerosis-who are \"between\" primary and secondary prevention-that might benefit from the most aggressive lipid-lowering pharmacotherapy.",

Elucidation of the pathophysiology of genetic disorders of lipid metabolism (e.g., familial hypercholesterolemia) has led to the development of several novel lipid-lowering strategies, including blocking the degradation of hepatic LDL-C receptors that are important in LDL-C clearance, or the inhibition of apoprotein synthesis and lipidation. Mipomersen and lomitapide are highly efficacious new agents available for the treatment of patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia. The recent introduction of PCSK9 inhibitors (alirocumab and evolocumab) have made it possible for many patients to achieve very low LDL-C concentrations (e.g., <40\u00a0mg/dl) that are usually not attainable with statin monotherapy. Ongoing clinical trials are examining the impact of very low LDL-C levels on cardiovascular disease event rates and the long-term safety of this approach.",

Patients with familial hypercholesterolemia may go undiagnosed and untreated or, despite treatment, have persistently elevated lipid levels that confer a high cardiovascular disease risk. Although the true prevalence is unknown, statin intolerance is a common clinical presentation that is difficult to assess and frequently leads to suboptimal lipid treatment. Additionally, some patients may not achieve the expected response to guideline-based therapy. For all 3 groups, a standardized approach offers the best chance for effective diagnosis and optimal treatment.",

We demonstrated that tanshinone IIA significantly increased the amount of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and LDL uptake activity in HepG2 cells at the post-transcriptional regulation. We further demonstrated that tanshinone IIA inhibited the expression of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) mRNA and mature protein, which may lead to an increase the cell-surface LDLR in hepatic cells. We further identified a regulatory DNA element involved in the tanshinone IIA-mediated PCSK9 down-regulation, which is located between the -411 and -336 positions of the PCSK9 promoter. Moreover, we found that tanshinone IIA markedly increased the nuclear forkhead box O3a (FoxO3a) level, enhanced FoxO3a/PCSK9 promoter complexes formation and decreased the PCSK9 promoter binding capacity of hepatocyte nuclear factor 1\u03b1 (HNF-1\u03b1), resulting in suppression of PCSK9 gene expression. Finally, we found that the statin-induced PCSK9 overexpression was attenuated and the LDLR activity was elevated in a synergic manner by combination of tanshinone IIA treatment in HepG2 cells.

    "135": "This Review is intended to help clinicians, patients, and the public make informed decisions about statin therapy for the prevention of heart attacks and strokes. It explains how the evidence that is available from randomised controlled trials yields reliable information about both the efficacy and safety of statin therapy. In addition, it discusses how claims that statins commonly cause adverse effects reflect a failure to recognise the limitations of other sources of evidence about the effects of treatment. Large-scale evidence from randomised trials shows that statin therapy reduces the risk of major vascular events (ie, coronary deaths or myocardial infarctions, strokes, and coronary revascularisation procedures) by about one-quarter for each mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol during each year (after the first) that it continues to be taken. The absolute benefits of statin therapy depend on an individual's absolute risk of occlusive vascular events and the absolute reduction in LDL cholesterol that is achieved. For example, lowering LDL cholesterol by 2 mmol/L (77 mg/dL) with an effective low-cost statin regimen (eg, atorvastatin 40 mg daily, costing about \u00a32 per month) for 5 years in 10\u2008000 patients would typically prevent major vascular events from occurring in about 1000 patients (ie, 10% absolute benefit) with pre-existing occlusive vascular disease (secondary prevention) and in 500 patients (ie, 5% absolute benefit) who are at increased risk but have not yet had a vascular event (primary prevention). Statin therapy has been shown to reduce vascular disease risk during each year it continues to be taken, so larger absolute benefits would accrue with more prolonged therapy, and these benefits persist long term. The only serious adverse events that have been shown to be caused by long-term statin therapy-ie, adverse effects of the statin-are myopathy (defined as muscle pain or weakness combined with large increases in blood concentrations of creatine kinase), new-onset diabetes mellitus, and, probably, haemorrhagic stroke. Typically, treatment of 10\u2008000 patients for 5 years with an effective regimen (eg, atorvastatin 40 mg daily) would cause about 5 cases of myopathy (one of which might progress, if the statin therapy is not stopped, to the more severe condition of rhabdomyolysis), 50-100 new cases of diabetes, and 5-10 haemorrhagic strokes. However, any adverse impact of these side-effects on major vascular events has already been taken into account in the estimates of the absolute benefits. Statin therapy may cause symptomatic adverse events (eg, muscle pain or weakness) in up to about 50-100 patients (ie, 0\u00b75-1\u00b70% absolute harm) per 10\u2008000 treated for 5 years. However, placebo-controlled randomised trials have shown definitively that almost all of the symptomatic adverse events that are attributed to statin therapy in routine practice are not actually caused by it (ie, they represent misattribution). The large-scale evidence available from randomised trials also indicates that it is unlikely that large absolute excesses in other serious adverse events still await discovery. Consequently, any further findings that emerge about the effects of statin therapy would not be expected to alter materially the balance of benefits and harms. It is, therefore, of concern that exaggerated claims about side-effect rates with statin therapy may be responsible for its under-use among individuals at increased risk of cardiovascular events. For, whereas the rare cases of myopathy and any muscle-related symptoms that are attributed to statin therapy generally resolve rapidly when treatment is stopped, the heart attacks or strokes that may occur if statin therapy is stopped unnecessarily can be devastating.",

Conversely, the mechanism by which statins increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration of plasma is not well understood. The plaque array method was used to examine the effect of statins on in\u00a0vitro cholesterol particle formation. We observed that statins induced high-density cholesterol particle formation in buffer solution with or without the addition of human serum. Besides, simvastatin and lovastatin in their inactive pro-drug forms modulate formation of LDL and HDL cholesterol particles, indicating a novel nonenzymatic mechanism of statins. In a pilot study, screening of serum samples in the assay showed variation among patient samples in response to different statins. Specifically, screening of 50 serum samples with high cholesterol and statin treatment, compared with standard LDL-based measurement of statin efficacy, showed a good correlation for simvastatin (88%) and atorvastatin (84%). Taken together, our data indicate that statins, in addition to inhibiting enzyme-mediated cholesterol synthesis, have the capability to nonenzymatically modulate formation of LDL and HDL cholesterol particles in\u00a0vitro.

The amounts of electrode ingredients were optimized (graphite powder: paraffin oil: ATR-CTAB: MWCNTs: BMIMPF6 (58:26:5:8:3 w/w%). Surface characterization was done by using scanning electron microscopy. The potential measurements were recorded at optimized pH by using acetate buffer solution (0.1molL(-1), pH5.5). At the above experimental conditions, calibration curve (E vs. log [ATR]) was linear (R(2)=0.9977) in the concentration range of 1.0\u00d710(-9)-1.0\u00d710(-3)molL(-1) (0.0012-1209mgL(-1)) of ATR with a Nernstian slope of 58.14\u00b10.2mV decade(-1), and detection limit of 1.0\u00d710(-9)molL(-1) (0.0013mgL(-1)). After each injection of ATR to the buffer solution, the potential was stabilized in a very short time (average response time~6s) at 25\u00b0C. The modified graphite paste electrode had a long lifetime (>4months). Recovery of the spiked drug to blood serum samples (95.3-98.2%) revealed the reliability of electrode response to ATR. Blood serum samples from consumers were analyzed by the proposed method; the results were comparable with those from HPLC standard method. The potentiometric analysis of ATR tablets by the proposed electrode resulted in a relative error of 0.8% and 1.5% for 20 and 40mg per tablets, respectively. Finally, the electrode was used in potentiometric titration of ATR (1.0\u00d710(-3)molL(-1)) by CTAB (1.0\u00d710(-3)molL(-1)).

A significant reduction of Ki67 expression was also noted for BJ fibroblasts after prolonged incubation with the tested drug.", 
    "206": "The results indicate that the anti-melanoma properties of rosuvastatin are highly dependent on the tumor cell line assessed. However, the concentrations required to decrease melanoma cell viability in vitro exceed the plasma concentrations reached in patients treated with rosuvastatin at well-tolerated doses. What is more disturbing, reduction of proliferation and viability observed in BJ fibroblasts indicated that rosuvastatin at high doses may be toxic for normal cells.", 
    "207": "A 47-year-old woman had been treated with high-dose simvastatin for several years. After systemic treatment with the antifungal agent itraconazole, she developed muscle pain and highly elevated levels of creatine kinase and myoglobin. Muscle biopsy was compatible with statin-associated rhabdomyolysis, probably caused by a drug-drug interaction between simvastatin and itraconazole. The patient made full recovery. Three commonly used statins-simvastatin, atorvastatin and lovastatin-are metabolised by the liver enzyme CYP3A4. Several potent inhibitors of this enzyme are known, for example, azole antifungal agents such as itraconazole and posaconazole. If antifungal treatment is indicated in a patient using a CYP3A4-metabolised statin, we recommend (1) topical administration of the antifungal agent if possible, (2) the use of a non-CYP3A4-inhibiting antifungal drug such as terbinafine or (3) temporary discontinuation of statin treatment.", 
    "208": "We investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying statin-induced growth suppression of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) that overexpress the transcription factor ets proto-oncogene 1(ets-1) and downregulate dual specific protein phosphatase 4(dusp4) expression. We examined the gene expression of BC cell lines using the nCounter expression assay, MTT viability assay, cell proliferation assay and Western blot to evaluate the effects of simvastatin. Finally, we performed cell viability testing in TNBC cell line-transfected DUSP4. We demonstrated that ETS1 mRNA and protein were overexpressed in TNBC cells compared with other BC cell lines (P\u2009=\u2009<0.001) and DUSP4 mRNA was downregulated (P\u2009=\u2009<0.001). MTT viability assay showed that simvastatin had significant antitumor activity (P\u2009=\u20090.002 in 0.1\u2009\u03bcM). In addition, simvastatin could restore dusp4 deficiency and suppress ets-1 expression in TNBC. Lastly, we found that si-DUSP4 RNA transfection overcame the antitumor activity of statins. MAPK pathway inhibitor, U0126 and PI3KCA inhibitor LY294002 also decreased levels of ets-1, phosphor-ERK and phosphor-AKT on Western blot assay. Accordingly, our study indicates that simvastatin potentially affects the activity of transcriptional factors such as ets-1 and dusp4 through the MAPK pathway. In conclusion, statins might be potential candidates for TNBC therapy reducing ets-1 expression via overexpression of dusp4.", 
    "209": "There is an unmet need to develop an innovative cardioprotective modality for acute myocardial infarction, for which interventional reperfusion therapy is hampered by ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury. We recently reported that bioabsorbable poly(lactic acid/glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticle-mediated treatment with pitavastatin (pitavastatin-NP) exerts a cardioprotective effect in a rat IR injury model by activating the PI3K-Akt pathway and inhibiting inflammation. To obtain preclinical proof-of-concept evidence, in this study, we examined the effect of pitavastatin-NP on myocardial IR injury in conscious and anesthetized pig models.", 
    "210": "Eighty-four Bama mini-pigs were surgically implanted with a pneumatic cuff occluder at the left circumflex coronary artery (LCx) and telemetry transmitters to continuously monitor electrocardiogram as well as to monitor arterial blood pressure and heart rate. The LCx was occluded for 60 minutes, followed by 24 hours of reperfusion under conscious conditions. Intravenous administration of pitavastatin-NP containing \u2265 8 mg/body of pitavastatin 5 minutes before reperfusion significantly reduced infarct size; by contrast, pitavastatin alone (8 mg/body) showed no therapeutic effects. Pitavastatin-NP produced anti-apoptotic effects on cultured cardiomyocytes in vitro. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging performed 4 weeks after IR injury revealed that pitavastatin-NP reduced the extent of left ventricle remodeling. Importantly, pitavastatin-NP exerted no significant effects on blood pressure, heart rate, or serum biochemistry. Exploratory examinations in anesthetized pigs showed pharmacokinetic analysis and the effects of pitavastatin-NP on no-reflow phenomenon.",

    "212": "The effect of stains in asthma is mediated through targeting several signaling molecules that are involved in the development of asthma phenotype. In vitro and in vivo studies revealed that statins reduce airway smooth muscle cells proliferation and inflammatory mediators' release. Statins reduce chemokine release and mucus production from airway epithelial cells besides attenuating subepithelial fibrosis and eosinophils recruitment. In acute and chronic allergen driven animal models of asthma, statins reduce airway hyper-responsiveness, inflammation and remodeling. However, the effectiveness of statins in clinical trials results in contradictory conclusions based on study design and treatment protocol. Therefore, more clinical trials are needed to evaluate their role in asthma patients.", 
    "213": "Statins are associated with a reduced risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and have the potential to be an adjuvant agent for HCC. In this study, we examined whether statin use is associated with additional benefits among patients who received curative treatments (CTs) such as surgery, percutaneous ethanol injection (PEI), and radiofrequency ablation (RFA).We conducted a cohort study using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Data linked to the Taiwan Cancer Registry in 2001 to 2012. The patient cohort consisted of those who received different treatments, and we compared patients who received statins with those who did not. Statin users were defined as patients who received >28 cumulative defined daily doses after their HCC diagnosis. We used a time-dependent Cox proportional method to model the time from the HCC diagnosis to any death and HCC death between men who received statins and those who did not after adjusting for confounders. Data on statin prescriptions were collected every 6 months to define the user status.In total, 18,892 patients were included, and the mean follow-up duration was 1.74 years. The adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) of all-cause deaths increased in HCC patients who received RFA/PEI compared to those who received surgery (P\u200a<\u200a0.0001 and P\u200a<\u200a0.05, with aHRs of 1.81 and 1.16, respectively, for hepatitis B virus [HBV] or non-HBV HCC). However, with the addition of statin use to RFA or PEI, the overall survival was statistically equal.Surgical resection is still superior over other therapies. If HCC patients cannot meet the criteria for surgery, the addition of statin use to RFA or PEI might improve HCC survival.",

In a factorial design Rosuvastatin 10 mg, Candesartan 16 mg/HCT 12.5 mg or both were compared with placebo. Rosuvastatin effectively lowered LDL-cholesterol and the rate of cardio- and neurovascular complications with a NNT of approximately 500/year without detectable effect on mortalitiy. Candesartan 16 mg/HCT 12.5 mg did not influence any endpoint, however, the predefined subgroup of patients with hypertension level I had a benefit. Patients with systolic pressure <131 mmHg even trended towards a higher risk if treated. The combination of statin and blood pressure-lowering agents showed no additive effects. The benefit was solely the result of statin therapy alone. Primary prevention with Rosuvastatin can be recommended if the cardio- and neurovascular risk is 1-2%/year, independent of the initial LDL, although the NNT of 500-1400/year is high and mortalitiy is not decreased. Possibly there will be future studies with longer term follow up to verify a reduction in mortality. Therapy with Candesartan 16 mg/HCT 12,5 mg has a beneficial effect only in patients with hypertension. Further studies with different antihypertensives and more intensive blood pressure lowering are desirable. The approach of combining all three drugs within a poly-pill for primary prevention in an intermediate risk population without elevated blood pressure is not recommended.",
