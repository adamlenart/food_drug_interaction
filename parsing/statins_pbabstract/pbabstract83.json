After three months on one statin, fasting lipids were measured on 10 occasions over a five-week period. The same procedure was then followed for the other statin. The LDL was measured by a direct LDL immunoassay and was compared to the LDL estimated by the Friedewald and Cordova (0.7516) \u00d7 (total cholesterol [TC]-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C]) formulae.",

    "12": "Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) originate from the bone marrow and can be classified as either early or late EPCs. The focus of this study was on late EPCs, as they play an important role in angiogenesis and vascular proliferation. Evidence suggests that inflammatory and oxidative changes can increase EPC apoptosis. Of note, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) is a contributing risk factor to the development of atherosclerosis and plays a key role as both an inflammatory mediator and an inducer of apoptosis in endothelial cells. Additionally, a member of the sirtuin family, silent information regulator type-1 (SIRT1), promotes cell survival by repressing p53- and non-p53-dependent apoptosis in response to DNA damage and oxidative stress. Statins have also been shown to play a key role in the prevention of endothelial apoptosis and senescence via their lipid-lowering and anti-inflammatory actions. However, there is little evidence that statins themselves attenuate EPC apoptosis induced by TNF-\u03b1. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the effectiveness of one of the most commonly used statins, simvastatin, on decreasing TNF-\u03b1-induced apoptosis in EPCs. The results indicated that SIRT1 protein expression was decreased by TNF-\u03b1 in a time- and dose-dependent manner and that while TNF-\u03b1 caused a marked increase in the percentage of apoptotic EPCs, application of simvastatin decreased this percentage. A high concentration of simvastatin promoted the expression of SIRT1 and increased the proliferation of EPCs. In conclusion, findings of this study showed that simvastatin is crucial in counteracting the TNF-\u03b1-induced apoptosis of EPCs and that this protection may involve the actions of SIRT1.", 
    "13": "Chronic intermittent hypoxia-hypercapnia (CIHH) exposure leads to learnning and memory deficits in rats. Overactivation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors(NMDARs) can lead to the death of neurons through a process termed excitotoxicity, which is involved in CIHH-induced cognitive deficits. Excessively activated NR2B (GluN2B)-containing NMDARs was reported as the main cause of excitotoxicity. The ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2) signaling cascade acts as a key component in NMDARs-dependent neuronal plasticity and survival. Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), synapse-associated protein 102 (SAP102) and Ras GTPase-activating protein (SynGAP) have been shown to be involved in the regulation of NMDAR-ERK signalling cascade. Recent studies revealed statins (the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor) have effect on the expression of NMDARs. The present study intends to explore the potential effect of lovastatin on CIHH-induced cognitive deficits and the NR2B-ERK signaling pathway.",

Except for those in the control group, the rats were exposed to chronic intermittent hypoxia-hypercapnia (CIHH) (9 \u223c 11%O2, 5.5 \u223c 6.5%CO2) for 4 weeks. After lovastatin administration, the rats performed better in the Morris water maze test. Electron microscopy showed alleviated hippocampal neuronal synaptic damage. Further observation suggested that either lovastatin or ifenprodil (a selective NR2B antagonist) administration similarly downregulated NR2B subunit expression leading to a suppression of CaMKII/SAP102/SynGAP signaling cascade, which in turn enhanced the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. The phosphorylated ERK1/2 induced signaling cascade involving cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) activation, which is responsible for neuroprotection.", 
    "15": "These findings suggest that the ameliorative cognitive deficits caused by lovastatin are due to the downregulation of excessive NR2B expression accompanied by increased expression of ERK signaling cascade. The effect of NR2B in upregulating pERK1/2 maybe due, at least in part, to inactivation of CaMKII/SAP102/SynGAP signaling cascade.", 
    "16": "Elevated levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are observed in conditions with vessel and neuron damage or pathological arborization and can therefore be detected in chronic inflammatory process, cardiovascular disease and depression. Hyperlipidemia and cigarette smoking are two factors that have been implicated in endothelial damage. The high comorbidity between cardiovascular disease and major depression disorder (MDD) prompted us to study the effect of cigarette smoking, hyperlipidemia and statin treatment on the VEGFA mRNA and protein expression levels measured in MDD patients. We analyzed 38 MDD patients and 38 healthy control individuals and observed that the MDD group had a significantly higher VEGFA mRNA level and protein serum concentration (P=0.001; P<0.001, respectively). We found no significant association between VEGFA expression at the mRNA or protein level and cigarette smoking, hyperlipidemia or treatment with statins (P>0.05). Interestingly, patients who had attempted suicide had a lower VEGF serum level compared with patients who had not attempted suicide. The translational value of this finding remains unknown. A higher VEGF concentration may play a potentially significant role in the pathogenesis of depression, and the expression level appears to be unaffected by additional factors.",

Atorvastatin was withdrawn, but her weakness persisted. Owing to persisting weakness, an autoimmune myopathy (myositis) was suspected, but initially disregarded since a muscle biopsy showed necrotic muscle fibres without inflammatory cell infiltrates and myositis-specific autoantibodies were absent. After 18 months with slowly progressive weakness and increasing CK values, awareness of new knowledge about autoimmunity as a cause of necrotic myopathy, led to a successful treatment trial with intravenous immunoglobulines, followed by steroids and metothrexate.

Neuropathology that is linked to cognitive decline is described along with examples of treatment studies that show reduced neuropathology in aging dogs (dietary manipulations, behavioral enrichment, immunotherapy, and statins). Studies in canine show that multi-targeted approaches may be more beneficial than single pathway manipulations (e.g., antioxidants combined with behavioral enrichment). Aging canine studies show good predictive validity for human clinical trials outcomes (e.g., immunotherapy) and several interventions tested in dogs strongly support a prevention approach (e.g., immunotherapy and statins). Further, dogs are ideally suited for prevention studies as they the age because onset of cognitive decline and neuropathology strongly support longitudinal interventions that can be completed within a 3-5 year period. Disadvantages to using the canine model are that they lengthy, use labor-intensive comprehensive cognitive testing, and involve costly housing (almost as high as that of non-human primates).

Even if these assumptions hold, one would nonetheless fail to estimate direct effects using standard methods, for example, stratification or regression modeling, when the treatment influences confounding factors. For such situations, the sequential g-estimation method for structural nested mean models has been developed for estimating controlled direct effects in point-treatment situations. In this study, we demonstrate that this method can be applied to longitudinal data with time-varying treatments and repeatedly measured intermediate variables. We sequentially estimate the parameters in two structural nested mean models: one for a repeatedly measured intermediate and the other one for direct effects of a time-varying treatment. The method was applied to data from a large primary prevention trial for coronary events, in which pravastatin was used to lower the cholesterol levels in patients with moderate hypercholesterolemia.", 
    "60": "Contrast induced nephropathy (CIN) is a common complication of coronary angiography/angioplasty. Prevention is the key to reduce the incidence of CIN and it begins with appropriate pre-procedural management. Statins have been shown to possess pleiotropic effects (anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic properties) and their effects on CIN were assessed in several studies with conflicting results. Aim of this meta-analysis is to evaluate the efficacy of short-term statins for the prevention of CIN in patients undergoing coronary angiography/percutaneous interventions. We performed formal searches of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane central register of controlled trials and major international scientific session abstracts from January 1990 to January 2014 of trials which compares short-term statins versus Placebo for the prevention of CIN in patients undergoing coronary angiography/angioplasty. Data regarding study design, statin dose, inclusion/exclusion criteria, number of patients, and clinical outcome was extracted by 2 investigators. Eight trials were included, with a total of 4734 patients. CIN occurred in 79/2,358 patients (3.3%) treated with statins versus 153/2,376 patients (6.4%) of the placebo group [OR 95% CI 0.50 (0.38-0.66), p < 0.00001; p het = 0.39]. Benefits were both observed with high-dose short-term statins [OR 95% CI 0.44 (0.30-0.65), p < 0.0001; p het = 0.16] and low-dose statins, [OR 95% CI 0.58 (0.39-0.88), p = 0.010; p het = 0.90]. By meta-regression analysis, no significant relationship was observed between benefits from statin therapy and patient's risk profile (p = 0.26), LDL cholesterol (p = 0.4), contrast volume (p = 0.94) or diabetes rate (p = 0.38). This meta-analysis showed that among patients undergoing coronary angiography/percutaneous intervention the use of short-term statins reduces the incidence of CIN, and therefore is highly recommended even in patients with low LDL-cholesterol levels.", 
    "61": "Endothelium-derived superoxide induces vascular dysfunctions. The aim of this study was to examine the activity of protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), which leads to vascular superoxide production in type 2 diabetes, in addition to the effects of pravastatin. We studied these mechanisms in Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats (type 2 diabetes model) at the early hyperglycemic stage (vs. non-diabetic Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka [LETO] rats). Superoxide production and catalase activity were measured in aortas, as were the protein expressions of PKC\u03b4 and phospho-Ser(1177) eNOS. Superoxide production was increased in OLETF rats, and this increase was inhibited by the selective conventional PKC (cPKC) inhibitor G\u00f66976 and by the non-selective cPKC and novel PKC inhibitor GF109203X. Phospho-Ser(1177) eNOS was significantly increased in OLETF rats, whereas the protein expressions of PKC\u03b4 and phosopho-Thr(505) PKC\u03b4 and catalase activity were all greatly reduced. Pravastatin administration to OLETF rats in vivo had normalizing effects on all of these variables. The increment in superoxide production seen in OLETF rats (but not the production in pravastatin-treated OLETF rats) was abolished by high concentration of N(\u03c9)-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (electron transport inhibitor of eNOS), by sepiapterin (precursor of tetrahydrobiopterin), and by LY294002 (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase [PI3-kinase] inhibitor). In OLETF rats at the early hyperglycemic stage, aortic superoxide production is increased owing to activation of uncoupled eNOS through phosphorylation by PI3-kinase/Akt. This may be related to the observed reduction in PKC\u03b4/catalase activities. Pravastatin inhibited endothelial superoxide production via normalization of PKC\u03b4/catalase activities.", 
    "62": "There is no agreement on whether statins influence the incidence of atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass grafting. We performed a meta-analysis of 12 studies that compared statins with controls. Statin therapy significantly reduced the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation (POAF) (odds ratio, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.35-0.73) and length of hospital stay (weighted mean difference, -0.72; 95% confidence interval, -0.99 to -0.45), an effect that survived detailed subgroup analysis. Meta-regression analysis revealed that patient characteristics did not influence the extent of improvement in the incidence of POAF attributable to statins. In conclusion, patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting benefit from perioperative treatment with statins, which significantly reduce the incidence of POAF and length of hospital stay.",

Variations in prescription of statins are in part due to the vacuum of clinical research trial evidence and paucity of contemporary guidelines that are needed to address the use of lipid lowering therapy in the oldest old. There are a few randomised placebo-controlled trials that recruited an older population. Therefore evidence of statins efficacy in the oldest old is based on an extrapolation of results from those studies. The extensive exclusion criteria of those studies, the relative youth of the study participants, the low levels of comorbidity and functional impairment limit the external validity and the generalisability of the findings. Current guidelines are silent or generally non-specific about statin therapy for the oldest old deferring decisions to individual medical practitioners. Life expectancy, time to benefit, functional status and medication related adverse events, polypharmacy, adherence to treatment are factors that need to be considered when forming appropriate guidelines for statin prescription in the very old. Well-designed clinical trials that account for the heterogeneity of this population are needed.

Transwell culture plates were used to establish an U251-HUVEC co-culture system, which was used to mimic the interaction between malignant glioma and endothelial cells. Lentiviral vectors expressing VE-statin/Egfl7 siRNA were constructed, and U251 cells and HUVECs were transfected to inhibit VE-statin/Egfl7 expression. The proliferation, adherence, migration, and lumen formation of endothelial cells were assayed to investigate the influence of VE-statin/Egfl7 on angiogenesis in malignant glioma in vitro. Data showed that HUVEC growth was temporarily slowed after silencing the VE-statin/Egfl7 gene but rapidly returned to normal. Although endothelial cell migration was not influenced, cell adherence was markedly inhibited. Furthermore, the endothelial cells failed to generate a capillary-like lumen after VE-statin/Egfl7 gene silencing. Therefore, it can be concluded that VE-statin/Egfl7 may regulate the adherence of endothelial cells, thus playing an important role in endothelium-induced lumen formation during angiogenesis in malignant glioma.",

Forty-five paraffin-embedded glioma (grade I-II: n=24; grade III-IV: n=21) were examined. VE-statin/Egfl7 protein expression was detected via immunohistochemistry, and its correlation with pathological grade was evaluated. Three-dimensional cell culture was then performed to investigate the influence of VE-statin/Egfl7 on the angiogenesis of umbilical vein endothelial cells. Microarray detection was used to molecularly profile VE-statin/Egfl7 and relevant signaling pathways in malignant glioma (U251 cells). Data showed that VE-statin/Egfl7 protein was mainly expressed in the cytoplasm of cancer and vascular endothelial cells and was significantly related to the degree of malignancy (t=4.399, P<0.01). Additionally, VE-statin/Egfl7 expression was low in certain gray-matter neurons but undetectable in glial cells. VE-statin/Egfl7 gene silencing significantly inhibited angiogenesis in umbilical vein endothelial cells. The following microarray results were observed in VE-statin/Egfl7-silenced U251 cells: 1) EGFR family members showed the highest differential expression, accounting for 5.54% of differentially expressed genes; 2) cell survival-related signaling pathways changed significantly; and 3) the integrin \u03b1\u03bd\u03b23 signaling pathway was markedly altered. Thus, malignant glioma cells and glioma vascular endothelial cells highly express VE-statin/Egfl7, which is significantly correlated with the degree of malignancy. Moreover, VE-statin/Egfl7 plays an important role in glioma angiogenesis. Microarray results indicate that VE-statin/Egfl7 may regulate EGFR and integrins to influence the FAK activity of downstream factors, triggering the PI3K/Akt and Ras/MAPK cascades and subsequent malignant glioma development.",

Animals defective in ceramide biosynthesis are deficient in mitochondrial surveillance, and addition of particular ceramides can rescue the surveillance defects. Ceramide can also rescue the mitochondrial surveillance defects of other gene inactivations, mapping these gene activities upstream of ceramide. Inhibition of the mevalonate pathway, either by RNAi or statin drugs, also disrupts mitochondrial surveillance.

Patients with recurrence showed higher baseline EFT (7.4 \u00b1 2.7 vs. 8.5 \u00b1 3.0 mm, p = 0.014). Multivariate linear regression analysis indicated that EFT, left atrial diameter, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, statin treatment, and dose were the significant contributors to the maintenance of SR for all periods after EC.

In the present study, the release of simvastatin from simvastatin-loaded calcium sulphate (CS) scaffolds and the effect of these scaffolds on osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in vitro and the effect of simvastatin locally applied from CS scaffolds on bone regeneration were investigated. A total of 26 complete 1.2-cm bone defects were created in the ulna of rabbits, which were treated with CS, simvastatin-loaded CS or recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 2 (rhBMP)-2-loaded CS. Simvastatin was highly efficiently released from simvastatin-loaded CS at the onset and stable release was maintained. Alkaline phosphatase was highly expressed in the MSCs co-cultured with simvastatin/CS scaffolds for 7 and 14 days. The defects treated with rhBMP-2-loaded CS and simvastatin-loaded CS showed significantly higher X-ray analysis scores and a larger amount of bone formation as determined by histology compared with the CS group (P<0.05). No significant differences in the X-ray score and bone formation were observed between groups with rhBMP-2-loaded CS and simvastatin-loaded CS (P>0.05). Simvastatin is capable of promoting osteogenic differentiation of MSCs in vitro and stimulating bone regeneration when locally released from CS scaffolds into bone defects. The beneficial effect of simvastatin was similar to that of rhBMP-2. In conclusion, the present study suggested that the simvastatin-loaded CS scaffolds may have great potential in bone tissue engineering.",

    "157": "The ramifications of statins on plasma cholesterol and coronary heart disease have been well documented. However, there is increasing evidence that inhibition of the mevalonate pathway may provide independent neuroprotective and procognitive pleiotropic effects, most likely via inhibition of isoprenoids, mainly farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP). FPP and GGPP are the major donors of prenyl groups for protein prenylation. Modulation of isoprenoid availability impacts a slew of cellular processes including synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. Our previous work has demonstrated that simvastatin (SV) administration improves hippocampus-dependent spatial memory, rescuing memory deficits in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. Treatment of hippocampal slices with SV enhances long-term potentiation (LTP), and this effect is dependent on the activation of Akt (protein kinase B). Further studies showed that SV-induced enhancement of hippocampal LTP is driven by depletion of FPP and inhibition of farnesylation. In the present study, we report the functional consequences of exposure to SV at cellular/synaptic and molecular levels. While application of SV has no effect on intrinsic membrane properties of CA1 pyramidal neurons, including hyperpolarization-activated cyclic-nucleotide channel-mediated sag potentials, the afterhyperpolarization (AHP), and excitability, SV application potentiates the N-methyl D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-mediated contribution to synaptic transmission. In mouse hippocampal slices and human neuronal cells, SV treatment increases the surface distribution of the GluN2B subunit of the NMDAR without affecting cellular cholesterol content. We conclude that SV-induced enhancement of synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus is likely mediated by augmentation of synaptic NMDAR components that are largely responsible for driving synaptic plasticity in the CA1 region.",

The control animals (n=16) were given the solvent of simvastatin by slow (over 5min) intracoronary (ic.) injection just prior to the occlusion. Twenty-six dogs were treated with simvastatin (0.1mg/kg) by the same route, both in the absence (n=15) and in the presence (n=11) of l-NAME. This latter was administered (5mg/kg, ic.) either alone (n=12) or 10min before the simvastatin treatment. The severity of ischaemia (epicardial ST-segment, inhomogeneity) and ventricular arrhythmias (ventricular premature beats [VPBs], ventricular tachycardia [VT] and fibrillation [VF]), plasma nitrite/nitrate levels, myocardial superoxide production and eNOS activity were assessed. Compared with controls simvastatin significantly reduced the number of VPBs (289\u00b134vs. 94\u00b125) and the episodes of VT (5.6\u00b11.3vs. 0.3\u00b10.2), the incidence of VT (88% vs. 20%) and VF (56% vs. 0%) during occlusion and increased survival (0% vs. 33%) on reperfusion. There were also less marked ischaemic changes in the simvastatin-treated dogs than in the controls. Simvastatin preserved eNOS activity and nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability during occlusion and attenuated superoxide production following reperfusion. All these effects of simvastatin (except for the protection against VF) were reversed by l-NAME. We conclude that simvastatin given just prior to ischaemia/reperfusion reduces the severity of arrhythmias. This effect involves both NO-dependent and NO-independent mechanisms.", 
    "169": "The use of statins for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention is clearly supported by clinical evidence. Although statin therapy is rather well tolerated, recent data from prospective and retrospective clinical trials and related meta-analyses suggest an increased incidence of new-onset type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in association with such treatment. The incidence of this adverse effect is not negligible, especially for specific subsets of patients, such as women, elderly, presence of familial history of T2DM and Asian ethnicity. Statin-driven T2DM appears to be a medication class-effect, mostly not related to potency nor to individual statin, as well as to be independent of previous history of CVD. Therefore, implementation of strategies for identification of patients using statins and at specific risk of incident T2DM, as well as of different therapeutic options is important and is discussed in this article. As most authors emphasized that benefits of CVD reduction by statin therapy seem to far exceed the risk of T2DM development itself, these medications remain the cornerstone for primary and secondary CVD prevention, although a specific attention to glucose metabolism and metabolic syndrome features should be payed before and during statin treatment, especially in cohorts at greater risk.",

HUVECs were incubated with ox-LDL (120 \u00b5g/ml) for 24 h in the presence or absence of different concentrations of simvastatin (0.1,0.5, 1.0 \u00b5mol/L) . The fluorescence intensity for reactive oxygen species (ROS) in HUVECs was measured by a laser confocal scanning microscopy and a microplate reader.NADPH oxidase activity was measured by lucigenin chemiluminescence. p22(phox), gp91(phox), p47(phox) and p67(phox) mRNA expression of HUVECs post various treatments was detected by RT-PCR. p22(phox) immunoprecipitates were immunoblotted for p47(phox) and total p22(phox) levels to identify p47(phox)/p22(phox) interaction.", 
    "225": "Simvastatin attenuated ox-LDL induced ROS generation and NADPH oxidase activity in a concentration dependent manner (all P < 0.05). In addition, simvastatin significantly downregulated mRNA expression of p22(phox), gp91(phox), p47(phox) and p67(phox) (all P < 0.05), as well as the interaction of p47(phox)/p22(phox) (P < 0.01).", 
    "226": "Simvastatin is an important regulator on NADPH subunits mRNA expressions and p47(phox)/p22(phox) interaction. Simvastatin attenuates ox-LDL-induced oxidative stress in HUVECs via reducing NADPH oxidase activity.", 
    "227": "Progress in the knowledge of the pathophysiology of portal hypertension has disclosed new targets for therapy, resulting in a larger spectrum of drugs with a potential role for clinical practice. This review focuses on pharmacologic treatments already available for reducing portal pressure and summarizes drugs currently under investigation in this field.", 
    "228": "Evolocumab, a monoclonal antibody that inhibits proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), significantly reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels in phase 2 studies. We conducted a phase 3 trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 52 weeks of treatment with evolocumab.", 
    "229": "We stratified patients with hyperlipidemia according to the risk categories outlined by the Adult Treatment Panel III of the National Cholesterol Education Program. On the basis of this classification, patients were started on background lipid-lowering therapy with diet alone or diet plus atorvastatin at a dose of 10 mg daily, atorvastatin at a dose of 80 mg daily, or atorvastatin at a dose of 80 mg daily plus ezetimibe at a dose of 10 mg daily, for a run-in period of 4 to 12 weeks. Patients with an LDL cholesterol level of 75 mg per deciliter (1.9 mmol per liter) or higher were then randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either evolocumab (420 mg) or placebo every 4 weeks. The primary end point was the percent change from baseline in LDL cholesterol, as measured by means of ultracentrifugation, at week 52.", 
    "230": "Among the 901 patients included in the primary analysis, the overall least-squares mean (\u00b1SE) reduction in LDL cholesterol from baseline in the evolocumab group, taking into account the change in the placebo group, was 57.0\u00b12.1% (P<0.001). The mean reduction was 55.7\u00b14.2% among patients who underwent background therapy with diet alone, 61.6\u00b12.6% among those who received 10 mg of atorvastatin, 56.8\u00b15.3% among those who received 80 mg of atorvastatin, and 48.5\u00b15.2% among those who received a combination of 80 mg of atorvastatin and 10 mg of ezetimibe (P<0.001 for all comparisons). Evolocumab treatment also significantly reduced levels of apolipoprotein B, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, lipoprotein(a), and triglycerides. The most common adverse events were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, influenza, and back pain.", 
    "231": "At 52 weeks, evolocumab added to diet alone, to low-dose atorvastatin, or to high-dose atorvastatin with or without ezetimibe significantly reduced LDL cholesterol levels in patients with a range of cardiovascular risks. (Funded by Amgen; DESCARTES ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01516879.).", 
    "232": "The release of recent guidelines for high cholesterol, hypertension and diabetes in the U.S. has been accompanied by great noise and concerns, both in the academic circuits and the lay press. For persons aged 40 to 75 years, with LDL cholesterol levels between 70-189 mg/dL and 7.5% or higher estimated 10-year risk, the peril of a global \"statinization\" has been advocated, predicting a 70% increase of statin use in this otherwise healthy people. A minority of the Eight Joint National Committee panel disagreed with the recommendation to increase the target systolic blood pressure from 140 to 150 mmHg in persons aged 60 years or older without diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease. The 2013-American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists algorithm and consensus statement on diabetes has been criticized with particular concerns about transparency, conflicts of interest, group composition, and the abundant use of personal judgment and experience instead of rigorous methodology. Separate careers for experts who collect evidence from persons who write the actual guidelines seems a good opportunity in order to attenuate the noise associated with release of new guidelines, especially those that counter prior practice.", 
    "233": "Statins are effective lipid lowering agents traditionally used for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease. Statins also exert a range of pleiotropic effects that make them attractive candidates for use in a wide range of disorders, in particular inflammatory and immune mediated conditions. However, the exploitation of such pleiotropic effects has been greatly hindered by poor bioavailability and adverse effects on muscles and the liver at higher doses. Nanotechnology is often suggested as the solution to this problem, as it enables an increased bioavailability of statins. Moreover, colloidal carriers can offer targeted drug delivery approaches that enable localised biological effects of statins, further reducing their potential for unwanted toxicity and adverse effects. This article reviews the available evidences for the increased potential of statin therapy when administered in nano-formulations such as nanocrystals, nanoparticles, liposomes, micelles and various nano-enabled devices.", 
    "234": "In type 2 diabetes (T2D), copresence of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) < 2.8\u2009mmol/L with triglyceride < 1.7\u2009mmol/L or with albuminuria synergistically increased cancer risk. We tested whether use of renin angiotensin system inhibitors attenuated the increased cancer risk associated with these two risk subphenotypes.", 
    "235": "A prospective cohort of 4307 patients with T2D enrolled from December 1996 to January 2005 was analysed using a new user cohort design. Cox model analysis was used to obtain hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals. The study measured additive interactions between nonuse of renin angiotensin system inhibitors and low LDL-C plus low triglyceride or albuminuria for the risk of cancer. A positive interaction suggests a specific drug effect on the low LDL-C-related cancer risk.", 
    "236": "During 18\u2009769 person years of follow-up (median follow-up years: 4.44), 4.48% (n\u2009=\u2009193) of patients developed cancer. Use of renin angiotensin system inhibitors was associated with reduced cancer risk among patients with copresence of low LDL-C plus low triglyceride or low LDL-C plus albuminuria but not in patients without these subphenotypes. In multivariable analysis, renin angiotensin system inhibitor usage attenuated the hazard ratio of copresence of low LDL-C plus low triglyceride versus lack of this subphenotype for cancer from 2.08 (95% CI: 1.25-3.47) to 1.13 (0.61-2.11) with significant additive interaction (p\u2009=\u20090.0225). Similarly, RAS inhibitor usage attenuated the hazard ratio of copresence of low LDL-C plus albuminuria versus lack of this subphenotype for cancer from 1.99 (95% CI: 1.12-3.56) to 0.82 (0.43-1.54) with significant additive interaction (p\u2009=\u20090.0009).", 
    "237": "In T2D, renin angiotensin system inhibitor usage may specifically attenuate the low LDL-C-related cancer risk.",
