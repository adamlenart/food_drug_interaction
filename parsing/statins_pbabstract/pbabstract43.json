In the pre-statin era, niacin was shown to have beneficial effects on cardiovascular end-points; but in recent years, two major studies performed in patients whose LDL cholesterol levels had been optimized by a statin therapy did not demonstrate an additional significant effect on these end-points in the groups where niacin was administered. Both studies have several drawbacks that suggest that they are not representative for other patients. Thus, niacin still plays a role either as an additive to a statin or as a substitute for a statin in statin-intolerant patients. Moreover, patients with elevated triglyceride and low HDL cholesterol levels and patients with elevated lipoprotein(a) concentrations will possibly benefit from niacin, although currently the study evidence for these indications is rather poor. Niacin may be useful for compliant patients, however possible side effects (flushing, liver damage) and contraindications should be taken into consideration.",

We have recently shown that diabetes results in a reduction of cholesterol synthesis in the brain due to decreased insulin stimulation of SREBP2-mediated cholesterol synthesis in neuronal and glial cells. In the present study, we explored the effects of the decrease in cholesterol on neuronal cell function using GT1-7 hypothalamic cells subjected to cholesterol depletion in vitro using three independent methods: 1) exposure to methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin, 2) treatment with the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor simvastatin, and 3) shRNA-mediated knockdown of SREBP2. All three methods produced 20-31% reductions in cellular cholesterol content, similar to the decrease in cholesterol synthesis observed in diabetes. All cholesterol-depleted neuron-derived cells, independent of the method of reduction, exhibited decreased phosphorylation/activation of IRS-1 and AKT following stimulation by insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1, or the neurotrophins (NGF and BDNF). ERK phosphorylation/activation was also decreased after methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin and statin treatment but increased in cells following SREBP2 knockdown. In addition, apoptosis in the presence of amyloid-\u03b2 was increased. Reduction in cellular cholesterol also resulted in increased basal autophagy and impairment of induction of autophagy by glucose deprivation. Together, these data indicate that a reduction in neuron-derived cholesterol content, similar to that observed in diabetic brain, creates a state of insulin and growth factor resistance that could contribute to CNS-related complications of diabetes, including increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer disease.",

In our previous Japanese study, SLCO1B1 521TT genotype and the SLCO1B1 *1b haplotype were significantly associated with the risk of peptic ulcer and ulcer bleeding in patients taking LDA, especially in the patients with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI), angiotensin type 1 receptor blocker (ARB), or statin co-treatment. Protonpump inhibitors (PPIs) are recommended for patients who require antiplatelet therapy and have a history of upper GI bleeding. The interaction between PPIs and consequent impaired effectiveness of clopidogrel has caused concern regarding the effect of genetic polymorphisms of the CYP2C19 which mediates conversion of clopidogrel to its active metabolite. The later recent genome-wide analysis of SNPs indicated the association of several SNPs with small bowel bleeding in Japanese patients taking LDA.

There are numerous evidences that efficacy, adverse effects and toxicity of drugs may be enantiospecific. Therefore, we investigated the effects of optical isomers of atorvastatin, fluvastatin and rosuvastatin on the expression of drug-metabolizing P450s in primary human hepatocytes, using western blots and RT-PCR for measurement of proteins and mRNAs, respectively. The activity of P450 transcriptional regulators, including pregnane X receptor (PXR), aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and glucocorticoid receptor (GR), was assessed by gene reporter assays and EMSA. Transcriptional activity of AhR was not influenced by any statin tested. Basal transcriptional activity of GR was not affected by tested statins, but dexamethasone-inducible activity of GR was dose-dependently and enantioselectively inhibited by fluvastatin. Basal and ligand-inducible transcriptional activity of PXR was dose-dependently influenced by all tested statins, and the potency and efficacy between individual optical isomers varied depending on statin and optical isomer. The expression of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 in human hepatocytes was not influenced by tested statins. All statins induced CYP2A6, CYP2B6 and CYP3A4, and the effects on CYP2C9 were rather modulatory. The effects varied between statins and enantiomers and induction potency decreased in order: atorvastatin (RR>RS = SR>SS) > fluvastatin (SR>RS = SS>RR) > rosuvastatin (only RS active).

They consider that the aim of the lipid control, based on LDL-C goals, is essential for the prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. In subjects with metabolic syndrome (mainly, abdominal obesity, pre-diabetes and diabetes), the primary objective should be apoB or Non-HDL-C, which are better associated with cardiovascular risk. The treatment must be lifestyle changes and control of other risk factors. After calculating cardiovascular risk, statins are the first therapeutic step, with the strength and dose needed to achieve LDL-C goals. If targets are not achieved, ezetimibe or resins should be added. A new group of potent cholesterol-lowering agents, the PCSK-9 monoclonal antibodies, have recently been approved in Spain. Subjects at very high cardiovascular risk that have achieved LDL-C goals, or other objectives (apoB, Non-HDL-C), other drugs (fibrates, omega-3) capable of modifying triglycerides and HDL-C could be added, if necessary. Treatment to reduce cardiovascular risk and prevent cardiovascular disease has proven effective in all populations and at all age groups.

The T-CD gel was evaluated solely and after being loaded with simvastatin (SV) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP-2) separately and in combinations in order to reduce the doses of the active substances. Three doses of SV (7.5, 75, 750 \u03bcg) and two doses of BMP-2 (3 and 6 \u03bcg) were tested. The histology and histomorphometrical analysis showed improved bone repair with T-CD compared to T, probably due to better release control of both SV and BMP-2. In addition, as T-CD eroded more slowly than poloxamine alone, it remained longer in the defect site. Although synergism was not obtained with BMP-2 and SV, according to the observed regeneration of the defect, the dose of BMP-2 and SV can be reduced to 3 \u03bcg and 7.5 \u03bcg, respectively.",

We investigated the role of autophagy, a controlled intracellular self-digestion, in the anti-leukemic action of statins. Treatment with low concentrations (\u22646 \u00b5M) of statins, cholesterol depletion, and specific inhibition of cholesterol synthesis and protein farnesylation or geranylgeranylation, all inhibited proliferation of leukemic cell lines and primary leukemic cells without inducing overt cell death. Statins and agents that selectively reduce intracellular cholesterol levels, but not the inhibition of protein farnesylation or geranylgeranylation, induced autophagy in leukemic cells. The observed autophagic response was associated with the reduction of phosphorylated Akt levels in the lipid rafts, accompanied by a decrease in the activation of the main autophagy suppressor mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and its substrate ribosomal p70S6 kinase (p70S6K). No significant autophagy induction and downregulation of mTOR/p70S6K activation were observed in normal leukocytes. Autophagy suppression by bafilomycin A1 or RNA interference-mediated knockdown of beclin-1 and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3B induced apoptotic death in statin-treated leukemic cells, an effect attenuated by the addition of mevalonate or squalene, but not farnesylpyrophosphate or geranylgeranylpyrophosphate. Therefore, while the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis, protein farnesylation, and geranylgeranylation all contributed to anti-leukemic effects of statins, the inhibition of cholesterol synthesis was solely responsible for the induction of cytoprotective autophagy. These data indicate that combined treatment with statins and autophagy inhibitors might be potentially useful in anti-leukemic therapy.",

Recently, dietary changes associated with drug therapy have garnered attention as novel drugs to mitigate or ameliorate hypercholesterolemia. The present study was undertaken to observe different dietary polyphenols that can bind to the active site of HMGR and inhibit it. Results from the 12 dietary polyphenols tested reveal that polyphenols can bind to HMGR and block the binding of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP(+)). We observed that the rigidity of phenolic rings prevents the polyphenols from docking to the enzyme activity site. The presence of an ester linkage between the phenolic rings in (-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and the alkyl chain in curcumin allows them to orient in the active site of the HMGR and bind to the catalytic residues. EGCG and curcumin showed binding to the active site residues with a low GRID score, which may be a potential inhibitor of HMGR. Kaempferol showed binding to HMG-CoA, but with low binding affinity. These observations provide a rationale for the consistent hypolipidemic effect of EGCG and curcumin, which has been previously reported in several epidemiological and animal studies. Therefore, this study substantiates the mechanism of polyphenols on the activity of HMGR by molecular docking and provides the impetus for drug design involving further structure-function relationship studies.",

Drawing upon experience elsewhere, we used a microsimulation model of cardiovascular disease to investigate the health and economic impacts of increasing prescription length from the standard thirty days to either sixty or ninety days, for South African adults on a stable statin regimen. Increasing prescription length to sixty or ninety days could save 1,694 or 2,553 lives per million adults, respectively. In addition, annual per patient costs related to cardiovascular disease would decrease by $152.41 and $210.29, respectively.

Several non-lipid-lowering effects of this type of drug have been described. It is reported that they have an influence in preventing graft rejection, especially of the acute type. In this study, patients with end-stage renal disease and candidates for kidney transplantation were divided into two groups. Group A (intervention group) received atorvastatin for two weeks prior to their transplant surgery while group B (control group) received placebo. The lipid profile was tested (triglycerides, cholesterol, LDL) in all patients two weeks before the transplantation. After transplantation, drug use was stopped. We also checked the LDL serum levels in patients with raised lipid levels (LDL >100) every two weeks. After this period, the serum lipid levels were checked monthly up to six months. Hyperlipidemia, when present, was controlled by fibrates. Concerning the rejection episodes, there was no significant difference between the two groups. In group A (13 men and nine women), three (14.3%) cases of rejection were observed whereas four (21.3%) cases of rejection were seen in group B (11 men and 10 women) (P = 0.5). Within group A, five (22.7%) cases of delayed graft function were found while four (19%) similar cases were observed in group B (P = 0.7). There was no statistically significant difference concerning delayed graft function between the two groups. Despite all the mechanisms attributed to the probable anti-rejection properties of statins, we found no significant correlation with the administration of these drugs before transplantation and the protection against graft rejection episodes.", 
    "93": "The mevalonate (MVA) pathway is often dysregulated or overexpressed in many cancers suggesting tumor dependency on this classic metabolic pathway. Statins, which target the rate-limiting enzyme of this pathway, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase (HMGCR), are promising agents currently being evaluated in clinical trials for anti-cancer efficacy. To uncover novel targets that potentiate statin-induced apoptosis when knocked down, we carried out a pooled genome-wide short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screen. Genes of the MVA pathway were amongst the top-scoring targets, including sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 2 (SREBP2), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase 1 (HMGCS1) and geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase 1 (GGPS1). Each gene was independently validated and shown to significantly sensitize A549 cells to statin-induced apoptosis when knocked down. SREBP2 knockdown in lung and breast cancer cells completely abrogated the fluvastatin-induced upregulation of sterol-responsive genes HMGCR and HMGCS1. Knockdown of SREBP2 alone did not affect three-dimensional growth of lung and breast cancer cells, yet in combination with fluvastatin cell growth was disrupted. Taken together, these results show that directly targeting multiple levels of the MVA pathway, including blocking the sterol-feedback loop initiated by statin treatment, is an effective and targetable anti-tumor strategy.",

Pristine Ti was sequentially surface-treated with NaOH, 1,1-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI), beta-cyclodextrin-immobilized HAp powders (\u03b2-CD/HAp), and simvastatin before analysis using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray photoelectron microscopy (XPS), and static contact angle measurement. This revealed that simvastatin was released continually for up 28 days. Modification of the Ti surface with nano-sized HAp and simvastatin (Ti/\u03b2-CD/HAp/Sim) discs enhanced the osteogenic differentiation of MC3T3-E1 cells in vitro. Furthermore, Ti/\u03b2-CD/HAp/Sim of screw type enhanced bone formation between the screw and the host bone when the screw implanted to the proximal tibia and femoral head of rabbits. These results suggest that surface modification of nano-sized HAp and simvastatin are effective tools for developing attractive dental implants.",

Implant\u2011derived wear particles activate and recruit macrophages and osteoclasts, which cause a persistent inflammatory response with bone destruction that is followed by a loosening of the implant. Thus, strategies for inhibiting macrophage and osteoclast function may provide a therapeutic benefit for preventing aseptic loosening. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects of pitavastatin on the activation and cytokine response of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) particle\u2011induced monocytes.

Cerebrovascular disease comprised of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. Since studies did not include any control subjects, the corresponding general population of the same reference area and period of time for each HeFH study served as control group. Analyses were performed according to the period of time during which the studies were conducted: prestatin and statin era (before and after 1987 when lovastatin was launched).",

The subjects were then divided into 2 groups by change in HDL-C: no change or decrease in HDL-C (HD group) and increase in HDL-C (HI group). In the HI group, apolipoprotein A-1 (Apo A-1) and eGFRs were significantly increased by statin switching. There were significant differences in changes in HDL-C, Apo A-1, lipoprotein lipase, glycated hemoglobin, and eGFR calculated from creatinine between the groups. In the patients with impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes, change in HbA1c was also significant between the groups.",

Two hundred twenty-one patients (59.3%) were \u226575 years of age, and 98 (26.3%) were \u226585 years old. Two hundred thirty patients (62.3%) were independent before the event, but 270 (73.4%) were dead or dependent at the 6-month follow-up, and 328 (88.9%) were dead or dependent at 5 years. The 30-day survival was lowest for patients with acute visceral ischemia (28.2%) compared with acute limb ischemia (75.3%) and critical limb ischemia (92.6%; P<0.001). Risk factors (all P<0.001) were hypertension (age- and sex-adjusted risk ratio, 2.75; 95% confidence interval, 1.95-3.90), smoking (adjusted risk ratio, 2.14; 95% confidence interval, 1.37-3.34), and diabetes mellitus (adjusted risk ratio, 3.01; 95% confidence interval, 1.69-5.35), particularly for critical limb ischemia (adjusted risk ratio, 5.96; 95% confidence interval, 3.15-11.26). Two hundred eighty-eight patients (77.2%) had known previous cardiovascular disease, and 361 (96.8%) had vascular risk factors, but only 203 (54.4%) were on an antiplatelet and only 166 (44.5%) were on a statin. Although 260 patients (69.7%) were taking antihypertensives, 42.9% of all blood pressures recorded during the 5 years before the event were >140/90 mm\u2009Hg. Of 88 patients (23.6%) with incident cardioembolic events, 62 had known atrial fibrillation (diagnosed before the event), of whom only 14.5% were anticoagulated despite 82.3% having a CHA2DS2VASC score \u22652 without contraindications.",

The ACCC also claimed that Pfizer's actions constituted a course of exclusive dealing pursuant to s 47(1)(d) and (e) for the proscribed purpose of lessening competition. Flick J in the Federal Court of Australia, in a judgment heavy with quotations but sparse in reasoning, dismissed the ACCC's Amended Originating Application alleging abuse of market power and ordered the ACCC to pay Pfizer's costs.

Pharmacokinetic studies are necessary to investigate the levels of pravastatin in patients taking COBI and fenofibrate with and without other comorbidities. Meanwhile, we suggest that creatine kinase levels should be monitored and patients advised to report myalgias when using concomitant EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF and pravastatin/fenofibrate. This case serves as an important reminder to use estimated glomerular filtration rates rather than serum creatinine levels when choosing new medications. If potentially nephrotoxic combinations are started in patients with borderline estimated glomerular filtration rates, it may be prudent to check these filtration rates more frequently than usual. In patients with reduced estimated glomerular filtration rates, potentially nephrotoxic combinations should be avoided wherever possible.", 
    "126": "Owing to the high incidence of cholesterol-induced cardiovascular disease, particularly atherosclerosis, the current study was designed to investigate the preventive and therapeutic efficacies of dietary zerumbone (ZER) supplementation on the formation and development of atherosclerosis in rabbits fed with a high cholesterol diet. A total of 72 New Zealand white rabbits were divided randomly on two experimental studies carried out 8 weeks apart. The first experiment was designed to investigate the prophylactic efficacy of ZER in preventing early developed atheromatous lesion. The second experimental trial was aimed at investigating the therapeutic effect of ZER in reducing the atherosclerotic lesion progression and establishment. Sudanophilia, histopathological, and ultrastructural changes showed pronounced reduction in the plaque size in ZER-medicated aortas. On the other hand, dietary supplementation of ZER for almost 10 weeks as a prophylactic measure indicated substantially decreasing lipid profile values, and similarly, plaque size in comparison with high-cholesterol non-supplemented rabbits. Furthermore, the results of oxidative stress and antioxidant biomarker evaluation indicated that ZER is a potent antioxidant in suppressing the generation of free radicals in terms of atherosclerosis prevention and treatment. ZER significantly reduced the value of malondialdehyde and augmented the value of superoxide dismutase. In conclusion, our data indicated that dietary supplementation of ZER at doses of 8, 16, and 20 mg/kg alone as a prophylactic measure, and as a supplementary treatment with simvastatin, significantly reduced early plague formation, development, and establishment via significant reduction in serum lipid profile, together with suppression of oxidative damage, and therefore alleviated atherosclerosis lesions.",

Meta-regression, sensitivity analysis and publication bias assessments were performed using standard methods.", 
    "129": "Eight RCTs examining the effects of statins on plasma VEGF concentrations were included. Meta-analysis suggested a significant reduction of plasma VEGF levels following statin therapy (weighed mean difference: -19.88 pg/mL, 95% CI: -35.87, -3.89, p=0.015). VEGF reductions were observed in the subsets of trials with treatment durations \u22654 weeks (-19.54, -37.78, -1.30, p=0.036), LDL-C reductions \u226550 mg/dL (-28.59, -43.68, -13.50, p<0.001), lipophilic statins (-22.31, -40.65, -3.98, p=0.017), and diseased populations (-21.08, -39.97, -2.18, p=0.029), but not in the opposite subsets. Meta-regression also suggested a significant association between changes in plasma VEGF levels and LDL-C changes, treatment duration, but not molar dose of statins.",

Monacolin K, an extract of red yeast rice (RYR, Hongqu), plays important roles in the management of dyslipidemia, coronary heart disease, and diabetes. Our study aimed to investigate the protective effect of monacolin K on ovariectomy-induced bone loss in rats. Fifty female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into a sham-operated and five ovariectomized (OVX) groups: OVX with vehicle, OVX with fluvastatin, and OVX with RYR extract of three graded doses. Bone mineral density (BMD), biochemical markers, and cell viability were analyzed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and 3(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays. Gene expression was evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction amplification and western blot. Our results showed that administration of RYR extract markedly increased the bone mineral density in OVX rats. Moreover, RYR extract decreased the levels of bone turnover markers, including osteocalcin and tartrate resistant acid phosphatase activity. The MMT assay revealed that RYR extract treatment significantly improved the osteoblast viabilities in a dose-dependent manner (P < 0.05). At the molecular level, we further demonstrated that RYR extract enhanced the expression of Bmp2 and Bmp4 both at the mRNA and protein levels. Collectively, these data suggested RYR extract could protect against osteoporosis in ovariectomized rats, most likely through activation of BMP2/4 expression.",

Although elderly patients, particularly those older > 75, have not been well represented in randomized clinical trials evaluating lipid-lowering therapy, the available evidence supporting the use of statin therapy in primary prevention in older individuals is derived mainly from subgroup analyses and post-hoc data. On the other hand, elderly patients often have multiple co-morbidities that require a high number of concurrent medications; this may increase the risk for drug-drug interactions, thereby reducing the potential benefits of statin therapy. The aim of this review was to present the relevant literature regarding statin use in the elderly for their primary cardiovascular disease, with the associated risks and benefits of treatment.",

Recent clinical data suggest that chronic use of these drugs increases the frequency of new onset diabetes. Studies to define the risks of statin-induced diabetes and its underlying mechanisms are clearly necessary. We explored the possible mechanism of statin induced insulin resistance using a well-established cell based model and simvastatin as a prototype statin. Our data show that simvastatin induces insulin resistance in a cholesterol biosynthesis inhibition independent fashion but does so by a fatty acid mediated effect on insulin signaling pathway. These data may help design strategies for prevention of statin induced insulin resistance and diabetes in patients with hypercholesterolemia.",

Atorvastatin and sildenafil exert antioxidant and pleiotropic effects that may result in cardiovascular protection. We hypothesized that atorvastatin and sildenafil alone or in association exert antiproliferative effects by down-regulating MMP-2 and TGF-\u03b2, thus reducing the vascular hypertrophy induced by two kidney, one clip (2K1C) hypertension. Sham and 2K1C rats were treated with oral atorvastatin 50 mg/kg, sildenafil 45 mg/kg, or both, daily for 8 weeks. Blood pressure was monitored weekly. Morphologic changes in the aortas were studied. TGF-\u03b2 levels were determined by immunofluorescence. MMP-2 activity and expression were determined by in situ zymography, gel zymography, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence. The effects of both drugs on proliferative responses of aortic smooth muscle cells to PDGF and on on MMP-2 activity in vitro were determined. Atorvastatin, sildenafil, or both drugs exerted antiproliferative effects in vitro. All treatments attenuated 2K1C-induced hypertension and prevented the increases in the aortic cross-sectional area and media/lumen ratio in 2K1C rats. Aortas from 2K1C rats showed higher collagen deposition, TGF-\u03b2 levels and MMP-2 activity and expression when compared with Sham-operated animals. Treatment with atorvastatin and/or sildenafil was associated with attenuation of 2K1C hypertension-induced increases in these pro-fibrotic factors. However, these drugs had no in vitro effects on hr-MMP-2 activity. Atorvastatin and sildenafil was associated with decreased vascular TGF-\u03b2 levels and MMP-2 activity in renovascular hypertensive rats, thus ameliorating the vascular remodeling.

    "166": "As demonstrated by the 2011 publication of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Integrated Guidelines for Cardiovascular Health and Risk Reduction in Children and Adolescents, the information available regarding the treatment of pediatric lipid disorders has greatly expanded. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, or statin, therapy is now considered a first-line pharmacologic intervention for pediatric patients with severe dyslipidemias failing treatment with diet and exercise alone. Despite their ability to effectively reduce cholesterol levels, bile acid sequestrants continue to pose challenges for pediatric patients because of their unpalatability and are typically used as adjunctive therapy or for patients not able to tolerate statins. Fibric acid derivatives, as a class of medications, not only lack a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved agent, but also continue to lack significant pediatric safety and efficacy data. Niacin, a potential adjunct therapy, lacks FDA approval for pediatric patients and is plagued by significant adverse effects making it an unlikely therapy option for pediatric patients. Ezetimibe provides clinicians with an alternative adjunct therapy option when synergistically paired with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor or it can be used as monotherapy for patients intolerant to statins and bile acid sequestrants. Finally, despite several marketed formulations, omega-3 fish oils currently lack FDA approval in pediatric patients and have failed to demonstrate statistically significant lipid lowering in pediatric and adolescent patients. Although recent years have witnessed a dramatic increase in data available for the use of lipid-lowering medications for pediatric patients, long-term study data are still generally lacking and continues to present an active focus of research.",

In the following article, I will synthesize the arguments against universal lipid screening and treatment in childhood. Direct evidence that relates the presence of cardiovascular risk factors in childhood to cardiovascular disease outcomes in adulthood is unavailable, and as a consequence, the guidelines were formulated based on a chain of indirect evidence. The debate centers on the strength of the indirect evidence that links risk factors present in childhood to adult disease outcomes. The arguments against universal lipid screening and treatment of children include (1) a history of unanticipated harms caused by screening tests or treatments that were enacted based on indirect evidence, (2) the poor test performance characteristics of lipid profiles in childhood when used as a screening test, (3) problems with the effectiveness of lipid testing done in the office setting, and (4) concerns regarding the safety of statins when used in children.",

Here, we investigate the unbound liver partitioning (Kpu,u) of rosuvastatin, a substrate of hepatic organic anion transporting peptides, in cynomolgus monkeys and compare it with that determined using hepatocytes in vitro. Rosuvastatin (3 mg/kg) was administered orally to monkeys and plasma and liver (by ultrasound-guided biopsy) collected over time. Uptake into monkey hepatocytes was evaluated up to steady state. Binding in monkey plasma, liver, and hepatocytes was determined using equilibrium dialysis. Mean in vivo Kpu,u was 118 after correcting total liver partitioning by plasma and liver binding. In vitro uptake data were analyzed by compartmental modeling to determine active uptake clearance, passive diffusion, the intracellular unbound fraction, and Kpu,u. In vitro Kpu,u underpredicted that in vivo, resulting in the need for an empirical in vitro to in vivo scaling factor of 10. Adjusting model parameters using hypothetical scaling factors for transporter expression and surface area or assuming no effect of protein binding on active transport increased partitioning values by 1.1-, 6-, and 9-fold, respectively. In conclusion, in vivo rosuvastatin unbound liver partitioning in monkeys was underpredicted using hepatocytes in vitro. Modeling approaches that allow integrating corrections from passive diffusion or protein binding on active uptake could improve the estimation of in vivo intracellular partitioning of this organic anion transporting peptide substrate. A similar assessment of other active hepatic transport mechanisms could confirm and determine the extent to which limited accumulation in isolated hepatocytes needs to be considered in drug development.",

    "195": "The combination of aspirin and the thienopyridine clopidogrel is a cornerstone in the prevention of atherothrombotic events. These two agents act in concert to ameliorate the prothrombotic processes stimulated by plaque rupture and vessel injury complicating cardiovascular disease. Guidelines recommend the use of clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary syndromes and in those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, and the drug remains the most utilized P2Y12 receptor inhibitor despite the fact that newer antiplatelet agents are now available. In recent years, numerous studies have shown inconsistency in the efficacy of clopidogrel to prevent atherothrombotic events. Studies of platelet function testing have shown variability in the response to clopidogrel. One of the major reason for this phenomenon lies in the interaction between clopidogrel and other drugs that may affect clopidogrel absorption, metabolism, and ultimately its antiplatelet action. Importantly, these drug-drug interactions have prognostic implications, since patients with high on-treatment platelet reactivity associated with reduced clopidogrel metabolism have an increased risk of ischemia. Previous systematic reviews have focused on drug-drug interactions between clopidogrel and specific pharmacologic classes, such as proton pump inhibitors, calcium channel blockers, and statins. However, more recent pieces of scientific evidence show that clopidogrel may also interact with newer drugs that are now available for the treatment of cardiovascular patients. Accordingly, the aim of this review is to highlight and discuss recent data on drug-drug interactions between clopidogrel and third-generation proton pump inhibitors, pantoprazole and lansoprazole, statins, pitavastatin, and antianginal drug, ranolazine.",

Finally, we examined 465,499 individuals who attended the NHSP from 2003 to 2010 without any history of dyslipidemia, statin prescription, or hospitalization for cardiovascular events until the end of 2002. The subsequent statin prescription rates were identified from the NHIC medical service claim database from 2003 to 2011. Descriptive data and odds ratio from multivariate logistic analyses on statin prescription rates and the corresponding correlations were evaluated. The NHSP detected 114,085 (24.5%) cases of newly diagnosed hypercholesterolemia. However, only 8.6% of these received statin prescription within 6 months of diagnosis. For cases of sustained hypercholesterolemia determined in the next screening visit by the NHSP, the statin prescription rate increased, but only to 12.2%. Statin prescriptions were more common among females, older individuals, and hypertension or diabetes patients. Furthermore, the statin prescription rates had increased over the study period. The NHSP exhibited low statin prescription rate which has been improving. For the NHSP to be effective, it would be worthwhile to decrease the gap between the diagnosis of hypercholesterolemia and the following treatment.", 
    "197": "Whether to start, continue or discontinue statins in older people remains a clinical and ethical dilemma. While there is clinical trial evidence that statins reduce cardiovascular morbidity in older people, recently concerns have been raised about side effects in this population. Adverse effects of statins reported in older people include muscle-related symptoms, diabetes, impaired physical function and cognitive impairment. The cognitive effects of statins are not well understood and remain contentious. In younger and healthier people with baseline intact cognitive function, short-term data suggest no adverse effects of statins on cognition whereas long-term data support a beneficial role for statins in delaying dementia. Insufficient evidence is currently available to establish causality in relation to statins and cognitive function in older people specifically. The objective of this narrative review is to analyse the current evidence in relation to statin therapy and cognition, and discuss challenges in translating the current evidence to older people.", 
    "198": "Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have a substantial risk of developing coronary artery disease. Traditional cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia do not adequately explain the high prevalence of CVD in CKD. Both CVD and CKD are inflammatory states and inflammation adversely affects lipid balance. Dyslipidemia in CKD is characterized by elevated triglyceride levels and high-density lipoprotein levels that are both decreased and dysfunctional. This dysfunctional high-density lipoprotein becomes proinflammatory and loses its atheroprotective ability to promote cholesterol efflux from cells, including lipid-overloaded macrophages in the arterial wall. Elevated triglyceride levels result primarily from defective clearance. The weak association between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level and coronary risk in CKD has led to controversy over the usefulness of statin therapy. This review examines disrupted cholesterol transport in CKD, presenting both clinical and preclinical evidence of the effect of the uremic environment on vascular lipid accumulation. Preventative and treatment strategies are explored.",

Explanations for the conversion of a predisposed individual to diabetes are ambiguous including reductions in ubiquinone and adiponectin levels. However, the risk of new-onset diabetes mellitus is far outweighed by the statin-induced considerable decrease in cardiovascular events. Thus, prediabetic patients at high cardiovascular risk should not be denied high-dose statin therapy due to the small increase in the risk of developing diabetes since statins, especially at higher doses, cause greater reductions in cardiovascular events compared with standard statin doses. Moreover, lifestyle modification or even antidiabetic drugs are highly recommended in these individuals.", 
    "204": "Numerous studies have shown that statin therapy initiated early after heart transplantation improves the short- and long-term prognosis, leading to a reduction in the incidence of cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV), acute rejection episodes and significantly lowers the incidence of cancer in this patient population. The molecular mechanisms responsible for the beneficial effects of statins in patients after heart transplantation are complex; the effectiveness of statins is associated not only with their hypolipemic action, but also with their pleiotropic properties. Statins have been shown to exert protective and therapeutic effects against cancer because they act as antiproliferative agents, promoting apoptosis and inhibiting angiogenesis. Moreover, they reduce the number of circulating monocytes, which inhibits the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, growth factors, adhesion molecules, chemokines, and matrix metalloproteinases, preventing chronic rejection and CAV. For these reasons, statins should be used as part of standard therapy in patients after heart transplantation.",

Although numerous retrospective studies have demonstrated improved prognosis in CHF patients treated with statins, two randomized trials, GISSI-HF and CORONA, have not confirmed the benefit of rosuvastatin in this group of patients. The benefits of using statins in CHF probably result mostly from their pleiotropic action, including the improvement of endothelial function, the inhibition of neurohormonal activation, and the reduction of proinflammatory activation.

Inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (statins), known as lipid-lowering agents, have been shown to exert antiarrhythmic effects both in experimental models and in humans. In this study, we postulate that atrial structural and calcium channel remodeling may occur in streptozotocin-induced type 2 diabetic rats and can be alleviated by rosuvastatin (RSV) therapy. We randomly divided Wistar rats into control, untreated diabetic, RSV-treated control, and RSV-treated diabetic animals. After treatment with RSV for 4 weeks, rats were assessed by metabolic tests, histopathology, and transmission electron microscopy. The expression of Cav1.2, Cav3.1, and Cav3.2 in atrial tissues was detected by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blot, and inward calcium currents (l(Ca-L) and l(Ca-T)) were recorded in isolated atrial myocytes using patch-clamp techniques. Compared with controls, diabetic rats displayed severe metabolic disorders and a disorganized cellular ultrastructure. In diabetic rats, the expression of Cav1.2 mRNA and protein was significantly decreased, whereas that of Cav3.1 was significantly increased. Long-term RSV treatment partially relieved some pathological changes in diabetic rats. However, Cav3.2 mRNA and protein remained unchanged in control and diabetic groups and was unaffected by RSV. Diabetic atrial myocytes showed significantly reduced L-type but increased T-type, Ca (2+) currents, and this effect was significantly reversed by RSV. In conclusion, long-term RSV therapy can alleviate structural and calcium channel remodeling in the type 2 diabetic rat atrium.", 
    "215": "SLCO1B1 polymorphisms are relevant in statin pharmacokinetics. Aim of this study was to investigate the genetic variability and haplotype profile of SLCO1B1 polymorphisms in Roma and Hungarian populations. Genotypes of 470 Roma and 442 Hungarian subjects for c.388A > G, c.521T > C and c.1498-1331T > C polymorphisms were determined by PCR-RFLP assay. Using these SNPs eight different haplotypes could be differentiated.", 
    "216": "Differences were found between Roma and Hungarians in SLCO1B1 388AA (24.5 vs. 45.5 %), GG (33.4 vs. 17.9 %) genotypes, AG + GG (75.5 vs. 54.5 %) carriers, in G allele frequency (0.545 vs. 0.362), respectively (p < 0.001). The most common SLCO1B1 haplotype was the ht8 (GTT) both in Roma (43.6 %) and in Hungarian (59.1 %) samples. The ht6 (GCT) was not present in Roma population samples Haplotype analyses showed striking differences between the Roma and Hungarian samples in ht4 (ATT, 37.2 % vs 20.8 %), ht5 (GCC, 1.15 % vs. 3.62 %) and ht8 (GTT, 43.6 % vs. 59.1 %) haplotypes (p < 0.01), respectively. Linkage disequilibrium analysis showed that the studied variants are in different linkage disequilibrium patterns depending on the ethnic origin.", 
    "217": "Similarly to Caucasians the 388G is the minor allele in Hungarians, however, in Roma the 388A was found to be the minor allele contrary to Indians (India). The minor allele frequency of 521T > C and 1498-1331T > C SNPs are almost three times higher in Romas than in Indians (Singapore and Gujarati, respectively). Observed allele frequency for 1498-1331T > C polymorphism reflects the measured average European rates in Hungarians. The results can be applied in population specific treatment algorithms when developing effective programs for statin therapy.", 
    "218": "Pemetrexed, a multitarget antifolate used to treat malignant mesothelioma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), has been shown to stimulate autophagy. In this study, we determined whether autophagy could be induced by pemetrexed and simvastatin cotreatment in malignant mesothelioma and NSCLC cells. Furthermore, we determined whether inhibition of autophagy drives apoptosis in malignant mesothelioma and NSCLC cells. Malignant mesothelioma MSTO-211H and A549 NSCLC cells were treated with pemetrexed and simvastatin alone and in combination to evaluate their effect on autophagy and apoptosis. Cotreatment with pemetrexed and simvastatin induced greater caspase-dependent apoptosis and autophagy than either drug alone in malignant mesothelioma and NSCLC cells. 3-Methyladenine (3-MA), ATG5 siRNA, bafilomycin A, and E64D/pepstatin A enhanced the apoptotic potential of pemetrexed and simvastatin, whereas rapamycin and LY294002 attenuated their induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis. Our data indicate that pemetrexed and simvastatin cotreatment augmented apoptosis and autophagy in malignant mesothelioma and NSCLC cells. Inhibition of pemetrexed and simvastatin-induced autophagy was shown to enhance apoptosis, suggesting that this could be a novel therapeutic strategy against malignant mesothelioma and NSCLC.", 
    "219": "The use of statins as the preferred lipid-lowering therapy has clearly demonstrated its efficacy in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia, reducing also the risk of coronary events and cardiovascular disease mortality. In this study, we assessed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the SLCO1B1 gene and their effect on atorvastatin response. We included 129 Chilean hypercholesterolemic patients undergoing 10 mg/day of atorvastatin therapy during 4 weeks. Lipid profile was determined before and after drug administration. Genotyping of SLCO1B1 rs4149056 (c.521T>C) SNP was performed with allele-specific polymerase chain reaction, whilst polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) was used for genotyping the SLCO1B1 rs2306283 (c.388A>G) variant. After statin therapy, concentrations of TC, LDL-C and TG had a decrease from baseline (p < 0.05). Also, HDL-C levels increased (p < 0.05). Minor allele frequencies for the rs2306283 and rs4149056 variants were 0.547 and 0.136, respectively. LDL-C response to atorvastatin was not associated with the SLCO1B1 rs4149056 nor the rs2306283 polymorphisms (p > 0.05). However, the latter SNP was associated with HDL-C variability after atorvastatin medication (p = 0.02). This study indicates that LDL-C reduction following atorvastatin therapy is not influenced by the SNPs evaluated. In addition, the polymorphism rs2306283 at the SLCO1B1 gene determines greater HDL-C concentrations in response to atorvastatin medication in Chilean hypercholesterolemic subjects.",

    "223": "Twelve RCTs involving 1116 patients, 559 receiving statin and 557 receiving control regimen, were analyzed. Postoperative AF occurred in 17.9% and 36.1% of patients in the statin and control groups, respectively. The statin therapy was associated with decreases in the postoperative AF (risk ratio [RR] 0.50, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.41-0.61, P < .000010), hospital LOS (mean difference in days, RR -0.44, 95% CI -0.67 to -0.20, P = .0002), and postoperative C-reactive protein (CRP) compared with control (mean difference in mg/L, RR -12.37, 95% CI -23.87 to -0.87, P = .04). The beneficial effects on AF and CRP were more marked in patients receiving atorvastatin compared to other statins. Decrease in postoperative AF was greater in coronary artery bypass graft surgery compared to that in isolated valvular surgery.", 
    "224": "Perioperative statin therapy in statin-naive patients with sinus rhythm undergoing cardiac surgeries was associated with decreases in the development of postoperative AF, the hospital LOS, and the CRP level. However, there were insufficient data to provide evidences regarding statin impacts in patients undergoing isolated valvular surgery.", 
    "225": "Previously, in prostate cancer-free men, we found that statin initiation resulted in a 4.1% decline in PSA. This decline in PSA was proportional to the decline in cholesterol, suggesting a link between cholesterol and PSA levels. Whether these associations vary by race has not been explored and therefore we examined the association between pre-statin serum cholesterol and PSA in black and white prostate cancer-free men.", 
    "226": "We conducted a retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of 1,163 men (709 white and 454 black) without prostate cancer who initiated a statin between 1994 and 2006. Linear regression was used to test the association between pre-statin serum cholesterol and PSA levels, adjusting for potential confounders and stratifying by race.", 
    "227": "Black men were younger, had higher low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels (both P\u2009<\u20090.05) and a trend toward higher total cholesterol (P\u2009=\u20090.063). There was no difference in PSA or year of statin prescription by race (P\u2009=\u20090.900 and P\u2009=\u20090.217, respectively). On multivariable analysis, we found a positive correlation between serum PSA and total cholesterol (P\u2009=\u20090.005) and LDL (P\u2009=\u20090.003) in white men, but no association among black men. HDL was not significantly related to PSA levels in black or white men (both P\u2009>\u20090.5).", 
    "228": "Among prostate cancer-free men about to begin a statin, pre-statin total cholesterol and LDL were correlated with PSA levels in white, but not black men. If confirmed in future studies, these findings suggest that serum cholesterol may be related to prostate biology, and that this effect may vary by race.", 
    "229": "Rate and rhythm control strategies for atrial fibrillation (AF) are not always effective or well tolerated in patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). We assessed reasons for treatment failure, associated characteristics, and effects on survival.", 
    "230": "A total of 1,376 patients enrolled in the AF-CHF trial were followed for 37\u00a0 \u00b1 \u00a019 months, 206 (15.0%) of whom failed initial therapy leading to crossover. Rhythm control was abandoned more frequently than rate control (21.0% vs. 9.1%, P < 0.0001). Crossovers from rhythm to rate control were driven by inefficacy, whereas worsening heart failure was the most common reason to crossover from rate to rhythm control. In multivariate analyses, failure of rhythm control was associated with female sex, higher serum creatinine, functional class III or IV symptoms, lack of digoxin, and oral anticoagulation. Factors independently associated with failure of rate control were paroxysmal (vs. persistent) AF, statin therapy, and presence of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. Crossovers were not associated with cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 1.11 from rhythm to rate control; 95% confidence interval [95% CI, 0.73-1.73]; P = 0.6069; HR 1.29 from rate to rhythm control; 95% CI, 0.73-2.25; P = 0.3793) or all-cause mortality (HR 1.16 from rhythm to rate control, 95% CI [0.79-1.72], P = 0.4444; HR 1.15 from rate to rhythm control, 95% [0.69, 1.91], P = 0.5873).",

    "232": "Cholesterol-lowering statins effectively reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events. Myopathy is the most important adverse effect, but its underlying mechanism remains enigmatic. In C2C12 myoblasts, several statin lactones reduced respiratory capacity and appeared to be strong inhibitors of mitochondrial complex III (CIII) activity, up to 84% inhibition. The lactones were in general three times more potent inducers of cytotoxicity than their corresponding acid forms. The Qo binding site of CIII was identified as off-target of the statin lactones. These findings could be confirmed in muscle tissue of patients suffering from statin-induced myopathies, in which CIII enzyme activity was reduced by 18%. Respiratory inhibition in C2C12 myoblasts could be attenuated by convergent electron flow into CIII, restoring respiration up to 89% of control. In conclusion, CIII inhibition was identified as a potential off-target mechanism associated with statin-induced myopathies.", 
    "233": "The KDIGO guideline on lipid management in adult patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) reflects a paradigm shift as proposals for statin use are based on cardiovascular risk rather than cholesterol levels. Statin use is now universally recommended in CKD patients 50 years and older, assuming a 10-year risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) of over 10%. Specific comorbidities or formal risk calculation are required for younger patients. It is unknown to which extent these new guidelines differ from previous practice. Here we analyzed statin use in the German Chronic Kidney Disease study of 5217 adult patients with moderately severe CKD under nephrological care enrolled shortly before publication of the new guideline. Accordingly, 407 patients younger than 50 years would be eligible for statins compared with the 277 patients treated so far, and all 4224 patients 50 years and older would be eligible compared with the 2196 already treated. Overall, guideline implementation would almost double statin prescription from 47 to 88%. Among patients 50 years and older currently not on a statin, an estimated 10-year CHD and atherosclerotic event risks over 10% were present in 68% and 82%, respectively. Thus, implementation of the new lipid guideline requires a substantial change in prescription practice, even in CKD patients under nephrological care. Based on comorbidities and risk estimates, the universal recommendation for statin use in CKD patients 50 years and older appears justified.",
