Interestingly, a similar number of patients who received prior hypolipidemic treatment (other statins, fibrates or both) and who did not reach the LDL-C treatment goals reached the LDL-C goals for primary prevention with atorvastatin. Only 34% of all patients who needed secondary prevention reached the ISA LDL-C target of 100 mg/dl. Atorvastatin proved to be completely safe, only two patients had creatine kinase elevation above 500 U/L, and another six had mild CK elevation (< 500 U/L).

    "5": "In hypercholesterolemic and hypertensive patients, an increased propensity of their low-density lipoprotein (LDL) to oxidative modification has been observed. Because oxidized LDL (ox-LDL) plays a major role in atherosclerosis, the current study analyzed the anti-oxidative effect of valsartan (an angiotensin II receptor antagonist) therapy in combination with fluvastatin therapy in these patients. Administration of 40 mg/d of fluvastatin for 2 months to seven patients resulted in significant reduction in plasma total and LDL cholesterol (by 24-28%). Valsartan administration (80 mg/d for an additional 2-month period) in combination with fluvastatin did not further affect plasma cholesterol levels. Fluvastatin therapy inhibited the susceptibility of LDL to copper ion-induced oxidation, as shown by prolongation of the lag time by 22% and by a reduction of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) levels by 14%, as compared with the patient's LDL baseline oxidation. The addition of valsartan to fluvastatin resulted in a further 17% prolongation of the lag time and in an additional reduction of 21% in TBARS levels. In a parallel study, the LDL from eight patients who were first treated with 80 mg/d of valsartan for 2 months demonstrated reduced susceptibility to copper ion-induced oxidation, as observed by prolongation of lag time by 23% and reduction in TBARS levels by 19%, compared with the baseline values. The administration of 40 mg/d of fluvastatin for an additional 2 months in combination with valsartan, however, demonstrated no further inhibitory effect on LDL oxidation. The anti-oxidative properties of fluvastatin and valsartan against LDL oxidation were also demonstrated in vitro and the combination of both drugs was shown to have an additive effect. Valsartan therapy in hypercholesterolemic and hypertensive patients has an additive anti-oxidative effect to that of fluvastatin therapy. This may be related both to the anti-oxidative properties of valsartan and to the blocking of angiotensin II-induced oxidative stress.", 
    "6": "Inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (statins), a potent class of cholesterol-lowering drugs, exert a number of pleiotropic effects, including anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic properties. Evidence is now accumulating that these effects are not related to the reduction in lipid levels. In vitro studies, supported recently by in vivo data, indicate that treatment with statins results in a significant decrease in the levels of inflammation markers, such as C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha, which appear to be predictors of acute coronary events and help stratify cardiovascular risk. Up to now, only high-sensitive C-reactive protein testing has the potential to become an adjunctive method to assess the risk of coronary events in low- and high-risk individuals. Statins can also inhibit tissue factor expression, leading to impaired activation of the blood coagulation cascade, as evidenced by a decrease in thrombin generation in vivo. Interrelated inhibition of inflammation and thrombosis induced by statins is believed to largely contribute to clinical benefits from statin therapy, regardless of cholesterol levels. Further studies will answer the question whether markers of inflammation, other than C-reactive protein and possibly indices of thrombin formation, might improve cardiovascular risk stratification.",

    "33": "Platelet activation and aggregation is considered a crucial step in the initiation and aggravation of arterial thrombosis. ADP from activated platelets is recognized as major factor in thrombus formation and is a potent stimulator of oxygen-free radical release from neutrophils. The aim of the present investigation was to determine in vitro the direct effects of statins on ATP and ADP secretion by platelets and its impact on subsequent oxidative burst activity in neutrophils. Human neutrophils and platelets were isolated from peripheral blood. Levels of platelet-derived ATP and ADP were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography, oxygen-free radical release of neutrophils was measured fluorometrically, and chemotaxis experiments were performed. Rho-GTPases were studied by Western blot analysis. Thrombin-activated platelets primed neutrophils for enhanced oxygen-free radical release on triggering with formyl-Met-Leu-Phe, reduced by cerivastatin and simvastatin treatment of platelets. The two statins decreased the amount of adenosine-derivative release in these cells. Rho-GTPases, required for the thrombin signaling in platelets and neutrophils, were decreased after coincubation with statins. Data demonstrate that inhibition of Rho-GTPases by statins inhibit platelet ADP and ATP release and the consecutive augmentation of neutrophil oxygen-free radical release. Statins affect platelet-neutrophil interactions by altering Rho-GTPase-dependent adenosine nucleotide function.", 
    "34": "Adenosine triphosphate and diphosphate that activate platelet, leukocyte, and endothelium functions are hydrolyzed by endothelial CD39/ATPDase. Because CD39/ATPDase is downregulated in endothelial cells by inflammation and this may be affected by HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, we examined the role of cerivastatin and simvastatin in regulation of endothelial CD39/ATPDase expression, metabolism of ATP/ADP, and function in platelets. Thrombin-stimulated endothelial cells in vitro were treated with the statins, and hydrolysis of exogenous ADP and ATP was assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography and malachite green assay. Platelet aggregation studies were performed with endothelial cell supernatants as triggers. CD39/ATPDase surface expression by endothelial cells was determined immunologically by fluorescence-activated cell sorter, mRNA expression by RT-PCR, and thrombin-induced dissociation of Rho-GTPases by Western blotting. Treatment by simvastatin or cerivastatin restored impaired metabolism of exogenous ATP and ADP in thrombin-activated endothelial cells by preventing thrombin-induced downregulation of CD39/ATPDase. In platelet aggregation studies, ATP and ADP supernatants of thrombin-activated endothelial cells were less stimulatory in the presence of statins than in their absence. Data show that statins preserve CD39/ATPDase activity in thrombin-treated endothelial cells involving alterations by statins of Rho-GTPase function and CD39/ATPDase expression. Preservation of adenine nucleotide metabolism may directly contribute to the observed anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory actions of statins.", 
    "35": "The beneficial effects of statins are the result of their capacity to reduce cholesterol biosyntesis, mainly in the liver, where they are selectively distributed, as well as to the modulation of lipid metabolism, derived from their effect of inhibition upon HMG-CoA reductase. Statins have antiatherosclerotic effects, that positively correlate with the percent decrease in LDL cholesterol. In addition, they can exert antiatherosclerotic effects independently of their hypolipidemic action. Because the mevalonate metabolism generates a series of isoprenoids vital for different cellular functions, from cholesterol synthesis to the control of cell growth and differentiation, HMG-CoA reductase inhibition has beneficial pleiotropic effects. Consequently, statins reduce significantly the incidence of coronary events, both in primary and secondary prevention, being the most efficient hypolipidemic compounds that have reduced the rate of mortality in coronary patients. Independent of their hypolipidemic properties, statins interfere with events involved in bone formation and impede tumor cell growth.",

    "37": "Statins, anti-hypercholesterolemic agents, have previously been reported to induce apoptosis and exert antitumor activity when combined with other antitumor agents. The potential of lovastatin in combination with highly specific COX-2 inhibitor (MF-tricyclic) to induce anti-proliferative activity against tumour cells was evaluated using the combination index (CI) method. Murine colorectal cancer (colon-26, CMT-93), melanoma (B16F10) and human bladder carcinoma cells (T24) were tested. Exposure of colon-26 and CMT-93 cells resulted in synergistic interactions in both cell lines with CI<1 for 20-80% inhibition of cell growth in both cell lines. This synergy was not observed in the B16F10 melanoma and T24 bladder carcinoma cells. MF-tricyclic (40 microg/ml), augmented lovastatin-induced apoptosis up to 2.5-fold in colon-26 cancer cells. Combination of a specific COX-2 inhibitor, MF-tricyclic, may increase antiproliferative effects of lovastatin in colon cancer cells and this effect was due to an augmented apoptosis.", 
    "38": "Our previous studies have demonstrated that basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) inhibits the growth of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells via binding to high affinity cell surface receptors. The downstream signaling of bFGF was reported to involve the ras pathway. The aim of the present study was to examine the bFGF-induced growth inhibition in the presence of lovastatin, a farnesyl transferase inhibitor, which impaired ras signaling by preventing its association with the plasma membrane. We found that the combined cytotoxicity induced by lovastatin and bFGF was greater than the cytotoxicity induced by each agent alone. Similarly, the protein level of P21/WAF1/cip1 was greater after exposure to both agents together, than separately. bFGF did not interfere with the lovastatin-induced inhibition of P21/RAS membrane association, while lovastatin did not prevent MAPK activation by bFGF. Based on these findings we suggest that the growth inhibitory effect of bFGF on breast cancer cells is largely independent of the ras signaling pathway. Understanding these pathways may enable active intervention to alter the therapeutic ratio favorably in the treatment of breast cancer.", 
    "39": "We aimed to investigate the effect of atorvastatin (5 and 30 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks) on hepatic lipid metabolism in a well established model of dietary hypertriglyceridemia, the fructose-fed rat. Fructose feeding (10% fructose in drinking water for 2 weeks) induced hepatic lipogenesis and reduced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) expression and fatty acid oxidation. As a result, plasma and liver triglyceride and plasma apolipoprotein B (apoB) levels were increased. Atorvastatin, 5 and 30 mg/kg during 2 weeks, markedly reduced plasma triglyceride, but decreased apoB levels only at the highest dose tested (50%). Triglyceride biosynthetic enzymes and microsomal triglyceride transfer protein were unchanged, whereas liver PPARalpha, acyl-CoA oxidase, and carnitine palmitoyltransferase I mRNA levels (1.9-, 1.25-, and 3.4-fold, respectively) and hepatic fatty acid beta-oxidation activity (1.25-fold) were increased by atorvastatin at 30 mg/kg. Furthermore, hepatic triglyceride content (45%) and plasma nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs) (49%) were reduced. These results show for the first time that liver triglyceride increase in fructose-fed rats is linked to decreased expression of PPARalpha, which is prevented by atorvastatin treatment. The increase in PPARalpha expression caused by atorvastatin was associated with reduced liver triglyceride and plasma NEFA levels.", 
    "40": "A therapeutic-interchange clinic for statins is described. In 1999, the Department of Defense mandated the use of cerivastatin and simvastatin as the formulary statins in all military health care facilities by April 2000. Cerivastatin was the preferred agent; the goal was to use this agent in 60-65% of all patients. Walter Reed Army Medical Center developed a voluntary therapeutic-interchange clinic for patients receiving statins. Goals included facilitating the rapid switching of patients to the formulary statins, maximizing the use of the preferred agent, maintaining or improving lipid control, monitoring safety, determining costs, educating patients about their treatment, and documenting satisfaction with the clinic. Written educational materials were prepared, an algorithm for statin conversion was created, and laboratory tests were performed, among other measures. Between January and April 2000, 1356 patients were seen by the therapeutic-interchange clinic; of these, 942 agreed to have the efficacy and safety of their therapy monitored by the clinic. Before the formulary change, the most commonly prescribed statins were atorvastatin (44% of patients) and pravastatin (42%). Under the conversion policy, 96% of patients received cerivastatin and 4% simvastatin. The percentage of patients achieving their targeted low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol concentration increased from 65% to 75%. The policy saved an average of $115 per patient in the first year. Most patients were satisfied with the clinic, but only 36% of providers were satisfied. Cerivastatin was withdrawn from the market in August 2001; simvastatin became the only formulary statin. A therapeutic-interchange clinic at a military medical center provided an efficient means of switching a large number of patients to alternative statin therapy, monitoring the outcomes, and individualizing patient care.", 
    "41": "The risk factor precursors of arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) are expressed in children and adolescents and development of coronary atherosclerosis in adulthood. Certain pediatric subjects have inherited disorders such as familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), familial combined hyperlipidemia, hyperapobetalipoproteinemia, and the metabolic syndrome, which often lead to more marked elevations in plasma low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, placing them at increased risk of premature ASCVD. The aim of this report was to examine available data on the safety and efficacy of treatment of children and adolescents with elevated LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C).", 
    "42": "Treatment of adolescents with elevated LDL-C levels of 130 mg/dL, randomized to an intervention group receiving a stricter Step Two diet, produced a significantly greater fall in LDL-C than those randomized to the usual care group after three years of follow-up in the Dietary Intervention Study in Children (DISC).", 
    "43": "There were no differences between the intervention and usual care groups in growth and development after either 3 or 7 years of follow-up. In the Lovastatin in Adolescent Males Study (LAMS), 132 boys aged 10 to 17 years with heterozygous FH were randomized into a placebo group or a group receiving up to 40 mg/day of lovastatin. The treatment group had up to a 27% reduction in LDL-C, compared with the placebo group and there were no differences in growth, sexual maturation, hormone or biochemical levels. Longer-term studies are required to assess further the safety of such treatments, and whether treatment will delay the early expression of atherosclerosis such as intima media thickness and endothelial dysfunction.", 
    "44": "There is now ample evidence to demonstrate that atherosclerosis begins in childhood and is significantly accelerated in certain genetic disorders, most notably familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Untreated FH, both the homozygous and heterozygous forms, carry a substantial burden of morbidity and mortality if left untreated or inadequately treated. Males with FH are at earlier and greater risk than females and thus should begin therapy earlier, preferably at about 10. While bile acid sequestrants have long been considered the drug of choice in children, they have never been approved for pediatric use by FDA, are poorly tolerated, marginally effective at lowering low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and have minimal well controlled studies in children upon which to adequately assess safety. Over the last decade statins have been studied extensively in children and adolescents, although many of these studies have also been poorly controlled, of short duration, too small and lack detailed assessment. However there has been at least one large, randomized, placebo-controlled and comprehensive study with lovastatin in adolescent males that indicated efficacy similar to that anticipated in adults and no apparent safety concerns. While additional well-controlled studies are needed, especially those focusing on surrogates of atherosclerosis to determine clinical benefit, it is opportune for re-evaluation of current treatment guidelines.", 
    "45": "Increased production of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) in plaques plays a role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of blockade of Rho/Rho-kinase signaling on the synthesis of PAI-1 in cultured human peripheral blood monocytes. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) and inhibitors of Rho and Rho-kinase were added to monocyte cultures. The levels of PAI antigen and mRNA were determined by Western blotting and RT-PCR, respectively, and PAI-1 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry. We performed pull-down assays to determine the activity of Rho by measuring the GTP-bound form of Rho A. In unstimulated and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated cultured monocytes, statins reduced the levels of PAI-1 antigen and mRNA. The suppressive effects of statins on PAI-1 synthesis were reversed by geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP) and were mimicked by C3 exoenzyme. Immunohistochemistry confirmed the role of lipid modification by GGPP in suppressive effect of statins in PAI-1 synthesis. Pull-down assays demonstrated that statins decreased the levels of the GTP-bound form of Rho A. Our findings suggest that statins decrease the activity of Rho by inhibiting geranylgeranylation. Moreover, Rho-kinase inhibitors, Y-27632 and fasudil, suppressed the synthesis of PAI-1 in this culture system. We show that inhibition of Rho/Rho-kinase signaling downregulates the synthesis of PAI-1 in human monocytes.", 
    "46": "The cholesterol-lowering agents, known as statins, have been in use for 15 years and are among the most commonly prescribed drugs. Animal studies and premarketing clinical trials have given signals of hepatotoxicity, primarily minor elevations in serum alanine aminotransferase enzyme (ALT) levels. For that reason, all of the cholesterol-lowering drugs have labeling that requires monitoring of liver enzymes. Postmarketing experience, however, suggests that hepatotoxicity is rare and thus it is timely to revisit the issue. The first of the statins, lovastatin, was approved in 1986 and has acquired 24 million patient-years of clinical experience. Minor elevations in liver enzymes, i.e., ALT 3 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) occur in 2.6% and 5.0% of patients on lovastatin doses of 20 and 80 mg/day, respectively. These elevations are reversible with continuing therapy, are dose related, and are probably related to cholesterol lowering per se. Rare cases of acute liver failure (ALF) have been reported with all of the cholesterol-lowering drugs. With lovastatin, the rate is approximately 1/1.14 million patient-treatment years, which is 9% of the background rate of all causes of ALF and approximately equal to the background rate of idiopathic ALF. Monitoring for hepatotoxicity has not been effective in preventing serious liver disease, largely because of its rarity and the poor predictive value of minor ALT elevations. In fact, it may increase patient risk because of needless discontinuation of cholesterol-lowering therapy for false-positive results in patients who are benefiting from treatment.",

    "64": "This study evaluates the influence of simvastatin on lipid concentrations and on LDL-subtype distribution in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and in patients with type 2 diabetes and mixed hyperlipoproteinemia. Nine patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (LDL-cholesterol: 7.1 +/- 1.1 mmol/L, triglycerides: 1.3 +/- 0.4 mmol/L) and 8 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and mixed hyperlipoproteinemia (HbA1c 6.8 +/- 1.1%, LDL-cholesterol: 4.8 +/- 0.7 mmol/L, triglycerides: 2.5 +/- 1.1 mmol/L) were examined. Cholesterol concentration was determined in 7 LDL-subfractions isolated by density gradient ultracentrifugation before and during simvastatin treatment (10-20 mg/d, 4 weeks). Simvastatin decreased LDL-cholesterol (-34%/-30%, all p < 0.05) and triglycerides (-2%, n.s./-25%, p < 0.05), but had little effect on HDL-cholesterol (+7%/+2%, n.s.) in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia and diabetes mellitus, respectively. In both groups a significant reduction of cholesterol in each LDL-subfraction was observed. Large-buoyant (LDL-1, LDL-2) and intermediate-dense (LDL-3, LDL-4) LDL were reduced more than small-dense (LDL-5-LDL-7) LDL-subtypes (-36%/-38%/-23%, respectively) in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia, while in diabetic patients cholesterol reduction was uniform in all LDL-subtypes (-29%/-27%/-31%, respectively). Simvastatin decreases cholesterol concentration in all LDL-subfractions in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia and in patients with diabetes mellitus with mixed hyperlipoproteinemia. However, the relative reduction of individual LDL-subtypes differed between both groups. This suggests that the effect of simvastatin on LDL-subtype distribution depends on the type of underlying hyperlipoproteinemia.", 
    "65": "The term 'idiopathic' is used to design sudden sensorineural hearing loss when causative factors cannot be identified. In most cases a viral infection or a circulatory defect are considered to play a significant role when an alternative satisfactory explanation cannot be found. However some significant points remain unclear, since the great variability in age and general conditions of the affected people makes it difficult to find a reliable interpretation of the exact nature of this phenomenon which is reasonably considered to have a multifactorial origin. Under these conditions many different therapeutic strategies have been put forward, thus suggesting some degree of uncertainty not only about the pathogenetic mechanisms of the disease but also on the actual effectiveness of the disparate treatment approaches. In this paper the use of statins in sudden sensorineural hearing loss is firstly proposed on the basis of their metabolic and hemodynamic effects, and the possible clinical implications are outlined.", 
    "66": "Treatments with high doses of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors may induce the expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP)-target genes, causing different effects from those attributed to the reduction of hepatic cholesterol content. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of high doses of statins on the key enzymes involved in VLDL production in normolipidemic rats. To examine whether the effects caused by statin treatment are a consequence of HMG-CoA reductase inhibition, we tested the effect of atorvastatin on these enzymes in mevalonate-fed rats. Atorvastatin and simvastatin enhanced not only HMG-CoA reductase but also the expression of the SREBP-2 gene itself. As a result of the overexpression of SREBP-2 caused by the statin treatment, genes regulated basically by SREBP-1, as FA synthase and acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase, were also induced and their mRNA levels increased. DAG acyltransferase and microsomal TG transfer protein mRNA levels as well as phosphatidate phosphohydrolase activity were increased by both statins. Simvastatin raised liver cholesterol content, ACAT mRNA levels, and CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase activity, whereas it reduced liver DAG and phospholipid content. Mevalonate feeding reversed all changes induced by the atorvastatin treatment. These results show that treatment with high doses of statins induces key enzymes controlling rat liver lipid synthesis and VLDL assembly, probably as a result of SREBP-2 overexpression. Despite the induction of the key enzymes involved in VLDL production, both statins markedly reduced plasma TG levels, suggesting that different mechanisms may be involved in the hypotriglyceridemic effect of statins at high or low doses.", 
    "67": "Most studies on the topic have shown that statin therapy decreases plasma LDL levels but not those of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)]. This specificity of action, although previously noted, has not been systematically investigated. In the current study we approached this problem by monitoring LDL- and Lp(a) cholesterol in 80 hypercholesterolemic subjects with high Lp(a) levels, at entry and 8 mon after initiation of statin therapy. We found that commonly used direct and indirect LDL cholesterol assays gave an LDL cholesterol value that comprised both true LDL- and Lp(a) cholesterol. We estimated these two analytes from the values of Lp(a) protein determined by ELISA and from knowledge of the Lp(a) chemical composition, complemented by data from immunochemical and ultracentrifugal analyses. Statin therapy, while not affecting plasma Lp(a) protein levels (21.7+/-10.4, before, and 22.0+/-10.1 mg/dL, after), caused a decrease in the estimated or true LDL cholesterol (P < 0.0001) to values in some cases as low as 10 mg/dL. This drop in true LDL was validated by the decrease in the LDL band in the ultracentrifugation profiles, and its magnitude was proportional to the degree of total cholesterol lowering and to the pretreatment true LDL/Lp(a) cholesterol weight ratio. We conclude that true LDL but not Lp(a) cholesterol is affected by statin therapy and that this specific response cannot be monitored by current LDL cholesterol assays and must, rather, rely on estimates of these two analytes.",

After six weeks on an appropriate diet, the patients were randomised to receive different statin therapies if there was no reduction in their lipid profile and/or PDTG (T1). They were re-evaluated six weeks later, and the drug doses were maintained or increased on the basis of the variables (T2). A final evaluation was made after a further six weeks (T3). All of the data were evaluated using ANOVA and Spearman's correlation coefficent. The results showed increased PDTG in hypercholesterolemic subjects (418.2 +/- 29.2 mIU/mL, p < 0.001 vs controls). Diet alone did not reduce PDTG (380.2 +/- 28.5 mIU/mL, p = 0.226 vs controls). At T2, simvastatin and atorvastatin significantly decreased PDTG (P < 0.001 vs T0-1) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). No correlation was found between the two variables in the simvastatin group (r = 0.16). Cerivastatin reduced PDTG without significantly decreasing LDL-C (p < 0.001 and p = 0.476, r = 0.14).

    "71": "The selective hand injection of contrast media into the right coronary artery of a middle-aged male by Doctor F. Mason Sones on October 30, 1958 introduced a new era in Cardiovascular Medicine. It is the purpose of this presentation to portray the pivotal role the coronary angiogram has played in creating some of the epochal events and discoveries that have characterized the march of progress in the field of cardiology over the past five decades. As the first reliable in vivo marker for the presence of obstructing coronary lesions, the coronary angiogram importantly led to our first studies of the natural history of patients with CAD. The motion studies afforded by cineangiography also permitted dynamic visualization of the contracting ventricle which led to the concept of regional wall motion abnormalities being characteristic of CAD and provided some of our earliest understanding of left ventricular dysfunction. The coronary angiogram also provided the stimulus for the development of aorto-coronary bypass surgery that was introduced by Dr. Rene Favaloro in May 1967. Subsequently, Dr. Andreas Gruntzig astounded the cardiology world by reporting his new percutaneous method of achieving revascularization (PTCA). The coronary angiogram provided the road map necessary for the successful deployment and application of this balloon technology that was soon to rival CABG surgery. The thrombolytic era was heralded in July 1979 when Dr. Peter Rentrop documented the successful reperfusion of a coronary artery in a 57-year old man by first recanalizing the occluding thrombus with a guidewire and then infusing the proteolytic enzyme, streptokinase directly into the artery. Within a year, DeWood made the angiographic observation that spontaneous regression of the totally occluding thrombus occurred among patients undergoing coronary arteriography within the first 24 hours of the onset of symptoms of an acute myocardial infarction. This led to the earliest studies on clot lysis by fibrinolytic agents and also paved the way for the balloon catheter to be used as a mechanical means of achieving coronary reperfusion in the acute setting. In the 1980s it was realized that vigorous lipid lowering with statin drugs did little to effect regression of the established atherosclerotic lesion but it did result in a dramatic decrease in subsequent clinical cardiovascular events. Similar observations were made by Little and others that acute coronary occlusion resulted more often from young, non-obstructing atheromatous lesions than it did from high grade obstructive lesions. This incriminated rupture of the soft, lipid rich atheromatous plaque as the most common mechanism leading to acute MI. In the closing decade of the past century, estimates of coronary blood flow using TIMI flow grades and TIMI frame rates led to the central unifying concept that the early restoration of normal flow (TIMI grade 3) was linearly related to survival after reperfusion therapy whether it be achieved pharmacologically or mechanically. The coronary angiogram was also integral in establishing antiplatelet therapy as the preferred pharmacotherapeutic agents to be used in association with stent deployment compared to coumarin drugs in preventing stent thrombosis. Although the coronary catheter is now used to deliver newer intracoronary devices such as intravascular ultrasound, velocity probes, gene probes and eluting catheters, it has served as the one indispensable form of coronary imaging for five successive decades. As such it has provided far more than is implied by the term \"lumenology\" and can rightly be called the lumen de lumine, the light of lights, for cardiovascular medicine.", 
    "72": "Type IIB hyperlipidemia is associated with premature vascular disease, an atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype characterised by elevated levels of triglyceride-rich VLDL and small dense LDL, together with subnormal levels of HDL. The dose-dependent and independent effects of a potent HMGCoA reductase inhibitor, Atorvastatin, at daily doses of 10 and 40 mg, were evaluated on triglyceride-rich lipoprotein subclasses (VLDL-1, VLDL-2 and IDL), on the major LDL subclasses (light LDL, LDL-1+LDL-2, D: 1.019-1.029 g/ml; intermediate LDL, LDL-3, D: 1.029-1.039 g/ml and small dense LDL, LDL-4+LDL+5, D: 1.039-1.063 g/ml), on CETP-mediated cholesteryl ester transfer from HDL to apoB-containing lipoproteins, on phospholipid transfer protein activity and on plasma-mediated cellular cholesterol efflux in patients (n=10) displaying type IIB hyperlipidemia. Plasma concentrations of triglyceride-rich lipoprotein subclasses (TRL: VLDL-1, Sf 60-400; VLDL-2, Sf 20-60 and IDL, Sf 12-20) and of LDL (D: 1.019-1.063 g/ml) were markedly diminished after 6 weeks of statin treatment at 10 mg per day (-31 and -36%, respectively; P<0.002) and by 42 and 51%, respectively at the 40 mg per day dose. Increasing doses of atorvastatin progressively normalised both the quantitative and qualitative features of the LDL subclass profile, in which dense LDL predominated at baseline. Indeed, dense LDL levels were reduced by up to 57% at the 40-mg dose, leading to a shift in the peak of the density profile towards larger, buoyant LDL particles typical of normolipidemic subjects. In addition, marked reduction in numbers of apoB100-containing particle acceptors led to a 30% decrease (P<0.02) in CETP-mediated CE transfer from HDL. Finally, a significant dose-dependent statin-mediated elevation (+15% at 10 mg; P=0.0003 and +35% at 40 mg; P<0.0001 compared to baseline) in the capacity of plasma from type IIB subjects to mediate free cholesterol efflux from Fu5AH hepatoma cells was observed. Moreover, atorvastatin (40 mg per day) significantly increased plasma apoAI levels (+24%; P<0.05), thereby suggesting that this statin enhances production of apoAI and with it, formation of nascent pre-beta HDL particles. Plasma PLTP activity was not affected by either dose of atorvastatin. We conclude that increasing the dose of atorvastatin leads to dose-dependent, preferential and progressive reduction in particle numbers of atherogenic VLDL-2, IDL and dense LDL, and concomitantly, to enhanced cellular cholesterol efflux in type IIB dyslipidemia, thereby diminishing the atherosclerotic burden in subjects characterised by high cardiovascular risk.", 
    "73": "Coronary artery disease is among the leading causes of death worldwide. Clinical trials show a protective effect of statins against the sequelae of coronary artery disease. The mean risk reductions for subjects using statins compared with placebo found in these trials is about 30%. These are average reductions for all patients included in the trials. Important factors in interpreting the variability in the outcome of drug therapy include the patient's health profile, prognosis, disease severity, quality of drug prescribing, compliance with prescribed pharmacotherapy and the genetic profile of the patient. This review aims to give an overview of the known polymorphisms (Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein polymorphism, Stromelysin-1 polymorphism, -455G/A and TaqI polymorphisms of the beta-fibrinogen gene, apoE4, Asp(9)Asn mutation in the lipoprotein lipase gene, the -514 CT polymorphism in the hepatic lipase gene and the ACE deletion type gene) that have an influence on the effects of statins in the general population. The expectation is that in the future a subject's genotype may determine whether he will be treated with statins or not. Determining the genotype will not deny therapy to a subject, but will help in deciding the therapy that will suit the patient best.", 
    "74": "Despite the significant advances made in the treatment of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) with antiplatelet and antithrombotic therapy, the risk of serious complications remains high, especially in the first few months following an acute coronary event. Although lipid-lowering therapy in patients with significant risk factors (primary prevention) or stable coronary disease (secondary prevention) is known to improve long-term survival, patients with a recent ACS were specifically excluded from the early statin trials. However, the use of lipid-lowering agents (principally statins) during hospitalization or in the period immediately following an acute coronary event has recently been studied. Statin therapy in this setting has been shown to reduce angina, rehospitalization, and mortality. Improved outcomes associated with lipid-lowering therapy in ACS may be mediated through beneficial effects on plaque stabilization, endothelial function, inflammation, and thrombus formation. This paper reviews the evidence supporting the potential benefits and mechanisms of statin therapy in the management of ACS. Clinical guidelines to achieve optimal lipid management are also discussed.", 
    "75": "This review examines the use of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) medications early in the clinical course of acute coronary syndrome. Available data demonstrate that there are clear clinical benefits to this practice. Numerous previous studies have documented the primary and secondary benefits of statins in the prevention of coronary events. Recent trials show that when statins are used during hospital admissions for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), patients experience decreased recurrent myocardial infarction, lower death rates, and fewer repeat hospitalizations for ischemia or revascularization. Several studies suggest that the positive effects of statins on plaque stabilization, inflammation, thrombosis, and endothelial function may be independent of lipid levels. There is also an emerging view that beneficial lipid-lowering with statins in high-risk patients has no lower limit. This information suggests that all patients admitted for ACS should be treated with statins, regardless of cholesterol levels.", 
    "76": "New National Cholesterol Education Program treatment guidelines incorporate a global measure of coronary heart disease (CHD) that alters risk categorization in primary prevention by identifying individuals with CHD risk equivalence on the basis of estimated absolute CHD risk. Increasing recognition of the association of on-treatment non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels with risk of CHD events is also reflected in the new guidelines by incorporation of secondary non-HDL cholesterol goals. The increased complexity of the guidelines and the likelihood of more individuals being assigned to higher risk groups with lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol goals is of some concern, because most patients receiving lipid-lowering therapy do not achieve current guideline LDL cholesterol goals. Increased potency of LDL cholesterol-lowering drugs would be of value in enabling more patients to achieve goals.", 
    "77": "Diabetes is associated with greatly enhanced risk for coronary heart disease (CHD), a correlation that justifies aggressive risk intervention in diabetic individuals. Lipid abnormalities in diabetes frequently consist of elevated triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Subgroup analyses of primary and secondary prevention trials with fibrates and statins indicate that lipid modification in diabetic patients is associated with significant CHD risk reduction. In 1 angiographic study (Diabetes Atherosclerosis Intervention Study) fibrate treatment was shown to reduce the rate of atherosclerotic progression. A primary prevention study of statin treatment (West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study) showed reduced risk for progression to diabetes in a post hoc analysis. Optimal lipid-modifying treatment in individuals with diabetes remains to be defined. Upcoming trials with diabetic cohorts will improve our understanding of how lipid treatment affects CHD risk in this patient population.", 
    "78": "Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol reduction remains the cornerstone of coronary heart disease (CHD) prevention. The most dramatic and consistent reductions in LDL cholesterol and CHD risk are achieved with statin therapy. Identification of individuals at high CHD risk is important, not only for initiating appropriate treatment and minimizing morbidity and mortality but also for optimizing the cost-effectiveness of such treatment. A simple method for identifying high-risk individuals is to identify those with preexisting atherosclerotic disease, diabetes, or familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). Treatment options for achieving LDL cholesterol goals in high-risk patients include statins, bile acid sequestrants, niacin, and plant stanols. Statin therapy should be instituted at a dose likely to result in achievement of LDL cholesterol goals based on average response; it should then be aggressively titrated if the goals are not achieved. If LDL cholesterol goals are not achieved with maximal statin therapy, combination with a bile acid sequestrant, niacin, and/or stanols should be considered. Options likely to be available in the near future include more efficacious statins with greater potential for reducing LDL cholesterol in all patients but especially in high-risk patients, such as those with FH, enabling a greater proportion to achieve LDL cholesterol goals. Other options that may soon be available as additive agents to statins to achieve greater LDL cholesterol reductions include bile acid transport inhibitors and cholesterol absorption inhibitors.", 
    "79": "Inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase, also known as statins, are lipid-lowering agents widely used in the prevention of coronary heart disease. Recent experimental and clinical data, however, indicate that the overall benefits of statin therapy may exceed its cholesterol-lowering properties. We postulate that statins may ameliorate the detrimental effects of high glucose (HG)-induced proliferation of mesangial cells (MCs), a feature of early stages of diabetic nephropathy, by preventing Rho isoprenylation. Rat MCs cultured in HG milieu were treated with and without simvastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor. Simvastatin inhibited HG-induced MC proliferation as measured by [(3)H]thymidine incorporation. This inhibitory effect was reversed with geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate, an isoprenoid intermediate of the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway. At the cell-cycle level, the HG-induced proliferation of MCs was associated with a decrease in cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor p21 protein expression accompanied by an increase in CDK4 and CDK2 kinase activities. Simvastatin reversed the down-regulation of p21 protein expression and decreased CDK4 and CDK2 kinase activities. Exposure of MCs to HG was associated with an increase in membrane-associated Ras and Rho GTPase protein expression. Cotreatment of MCs with simvastatin reversed HG-induced Ras and Rho membrane translocation. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that the overexpression of the dominant-negative RhoA led to a significant increase in p21 expression. Our data suggest that simvastatin represses the HG-induced Rho GTPase/p21 signaling in glomerular MCs. Thus, this study provides a molecular basis for the use of statins, independently of their cholesterol-lowering effect, in early stages of diabetic nephropathy.", 
    "80": "The clinical efficacy and safety of pitavastatin (NK-104), a novel HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, during long-term treatment, were examined in 25 patients (male/female=11/14, mean age=53+/-13 (mean+/-SD) years) with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (FH). After a period on placebo of >4 weeks, 2 mg/day of pitavastatin was administered for 8 weeks, and the dose was increased to 4 mg/day for up to 104 weeks. Total cholesterol (TC) decreased by 31% from the initial value of 340+/-57 to 237+/-40 mg/dl (P<0.0001) at week 8. During treatment with the higher dose, TC decreased even further to 212+/-35 mg/dl at week 12; it decreased by 37% from the initial value (P<0.0001). Similarly, the baseline low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (LDL-C) decreased by 41% at week 8, and by 49% at week 12, from 267+/-61 mg/dl at baseline. These findings indicate a dose-dependent effect of the drug on TC and LDL-C concentrations. To examine whether the levels of circulating matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and their endogenous inhibitors (tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases: TIMPs) are altered during lipid-lowering therapy, we also measured their plasma levels. The mean levels of MMP-2 and -3 were significantly increased. No significant alteration was found in MMP-9, TIMP-1 and -2 levels. As for the safety of pitavastatin, adverse reactions were observed in one case (4%) of subjective and objective symptoms. The effects of pitavastatin on TC and LDL-C were stable during long treatment of patients with heterozygous FH.", 
    "81": "Clinical studies have recently suggested that statin treatment may beneficially elevate plasma concentrations of high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol in patients with hyperlipidemia. Here, we have investigated the effect of a potent inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase on the synthesis and secretion of apolipoprotein AI (apoAI) in two model systems, HepG2 cells and primary hamster hepatocytes. Cultured cells were incubated with different doses of simvastatin (0.1-10 microM) for a period of 18 h. A dose-dependent increase in synthesis and secretion of apoAI was observed in both cell types. There was a significant increase in the synthesis of apoAI in HepG2 cells (44.3+/-12.1%), and hamster hepatocytes (212+/-2%) after treatment with 10 microM of the statin. The increase in apoAI synthesis appeared to result in a higher level of apoAI secreted into the culture media in both cell types (49.2+/-7.8% in HepG2, 197+/-0.2% in hamster hepatocytes). ApoAI mRNA levels were also significantly increased in both cell types in response to statin treatment. Control experiments with transferrin confirmed specificity of the effect on apoAI secretion. Analysis of a density fraction containing HDL particles in culture media revealed an increase in HDL-associated apoAI of 94.3+/-2.1% in HepG2 cells and 27.0+/-0.03% in hamster hepatocytes following 10 microM simvastatin-treatment. Comparative studies of simvastatin and lovastatin indicated a differential ability to induce apoAI synthesis and secretion, with simvastatin having a more significant effect. Thus, acute statin treatment of cultured hepatocytes (transformed as well as primary) resulted in a significant upregulation of apoAI mRNA and apoAI synthesis, causing oversecretion of apoAI and HDL extracellularly. The stimulatory effect on apoAI synthesis and secretion may thus explain the clinical observation of an elevated plasma HDL-cholesterol level in hyperlipidemic patients treated with certain statins.", 
    "82": "Monocytes and macrophages synthesize tissue factor (TF) which plays a role in thrombogenicity in coronary artery disease. This study was conducted to investigate the effect of Rho/Rho-kinase inhibition on the synthesis of TF in cultured human monocytes. 3-Hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins), C3 exoenzyme and Rho-kinase inhibitors were added to isolated peripheral blood monocytes and the synthesis of TF was assessed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Rho activity was determined by measuring the GTP-bound form of Rho A. Cerivastatin and pravastatin reduced the levels of TF antigen and mRNA. The suppressive effect of statins on TF synthesis was reversed by geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP) and the restoring effect of GGPP was eliminated by C3 exoenzyme and Y-27632. Pravastatin decreased the activity of Rho A, suggesting that the suppression of TF synthesis by statins is mediated via inhibition of the geranylgeranylation of Rho. Moreover, inhibition of Rho and Rho-kinase downregulated the synthesis of TF. Our results suggest that Rho/Rho-kinase signaling is involved in the synthesis of TF in human monocytes and that inhibition of Rho/Rho-kinase may be useful for treating thrombogenicity in coronary artery disease.", 
    "83": "The migration and proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) are known to play roles in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Therapy with a reductase inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3 methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) (\"statin\") produces significant alterations in various SMC functions. The objectives of the present study were to determine whether pitavastatin, a new chemically synthesized and powerful statin, can affect angiotensin II (Ang II)- and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced migration and proliferation of cultured rat vascular SMCs. The effect of pitavastatin on cell viability was also examined in these cells. Migration was evaluated by the Boyden's chamber method using microchemotaxis chambers. As expected, Ang II and PDGF BB potently stimulated cell migration in a concentration-dependent manner. Pitavastatin significantly inhibited Ang II (10(-6) mol/l)-induced migration at the concentrations of 10(-8) and 10(-7) mol/l. Pitavastatin also inhibited PDGF BB (1 ng/ml)-induced migration at concentrations between 10(-9) and 10(-8) mol/l in a relatively concentration-dependent manner. This statin modestly but significantly inhibited Ang II (10(-6) mol/l)- and PDGF BB (1 ng/ml)-induced DNA synthesis at concentrations between 10(-9) and 10(-7) mol/l. In addition, pitavastatin clearly inhibited Ang II (10(-6) mol/l)- and PDGF BB (1 ng/ml)-induced increases of cell number at concentrations between 10(-9) and 10(-7) mol/l. Pitavastatin did not affect lactate dehydrogenase release from these cells at the concentrations used in this experiment. In a trypan blue exclusion test, dead cells stained with trypan blue were not found 24 h after treatment with 10(-9), 10(-8) or 10(-7) mol/l of pitavastatin. These findings suggest that pitavastatin suppresses the migration and proliferation stimulated by Ang II and PDGF BB without affecting cell viability. Pitavastatin may exert an anti-atherogenic effect, in part, through these mechanisms.", 
    "84": "We investigated the effects of a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, pravastatin, an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, temocaprilat, and an angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist, CV-11974, on myocardial metabolism during ischemia in isolated rabbit hearts using phosphorus 31-nuclear magnetic resonance (31P-NMR) imaging. Forty-five minutes of continuous normothermic global ischemia was carried out. Pravastatin, temocaprilat, CV-11974 or a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, L-NAME was administered from 60 min prior to the global ischemia. Japanese white rabbits were divided into the following experimental groups, a control group (n=7), a group treated with pravastatin (P group; n=7), a group treated with pravastatin and temocaprilat (P+T group; n=7), a group treated with pravastatin and CV-11974 (P+CV group; n=7), and a group treated with pravastatin and L-NAME (P+L-NAME group; n=7). During ischemia, P group, as well as either P+T group or P+CV group, showed a significant inhibition of the decreases in adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and intracellular pH (pHi) (p<0.01, respectively, at the end of ischemia compared to the control group as well as P+L-NAME group), and a significant inhibition of the increase in inorganic phosphate (Pi) (p<0.01, respectively, compared with the control group as well as P+L-NAME group). These results suggest that pravastatin significantly improved myocardial energy metabolism during myocardial ischemia. This beneficial effect was dependent on NO synthase. However, this beneficial effect was not enhanced by either temocaprilat or CV-11974.", 
    "85": "Both the newly revised Adult Treatment Panel (ATP III) guidelines developed by the National Cholesterol Education Program and prospective trials indicate that lowering serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) to levels of less than 100 mg/dL is beneficial to minimize the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). However, the risk of acute coronary events is related not just to lipid levels, but also to inflammatory pathophysiologic processes that heighten the risk of plaque rupture. Statin therapy effectively lowers LDL-C to target (optimal) levels, and the newer formulas are proving to provide greater reductions. In addition, research demonstrates that statins also counteract thrombosis, reduce inflammation, improve endothelial function, block plaque formation and progression, and stimulate the growth of new blood vessels in ischemic tissues. Global risk reduction-including diet, exercise, weight loss, and drug therapy are keys to minimizing CHD events.", 
    "86": "A 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor is recommended in hemodialysis (HD) patients with hypercholesterolemia to improve their lipid profiles. We evaluated effects of simvastatin on markers for inflammation, oxidative stress, and coagulation in HD patients. Sixty-two maintenance HD patients with serum cholesterol levels of 200 mg/dL or greater were randomly assigned to the treatment group (n = 31; 8 men, 23 women; age, 63 +/- 11 years) and administered simvastatin, 20 mg/d, for 8 weeks or to the control group (n = 31; 10 men, 21 women; age, 60 +/- 12 years). We measured cholesterol, albumin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), malondialdehyde (MDA; an index of lipid peroxidation), and D-dimer (a marker of intravascular coagulation) in blood at baseline and again at 8 weeks. Fifty-eight of 62 patients completed the study. In the control group, total cholesterol, serum albumin, hs-CRP, MDA, and D-dimer levels did not change. In the treatment group, simvastatin administration for 8 weeks significantly reduced total cholesterol levels from 232 +/- 25 to 165 +/- 39 mg/dL (P < 0.001) and hs-CRP levels from a median of 0.23 mg/dL (range, 0.05 to 1.63 mg/dL) to 0.12 mg/dL (range, <0.006 to 1.45 mg/dL; P < 0.01), whereas it increased serum albumin levels from 3.4 +/- 0.3 to 3.6 +/- 0.4 g/dL (P < 0.001). Administration of simvastatin did not affect MDA and D-dimer levels. These results suggest that in addition to the lipid-lowering effect, simvastatin had an antiinflammatory effect in HD patients. Considering that atherosclerosis is inflammation of the vascular wall, simvastatin may have a beneficial effect on cardiovascular disease, in part because it alleviates inflammation.", 
    "87": "Despite the common occurrence of aortic stenosis, the cellular causes of the disorder are unknown, in part because of the absence of experimental models. We hypothesized that atherosclerosis and early bone matrix expression in the aortic valve occurs secondary to experimental hypercholesterolemia and that treatment with atorvastatin modifies this transformation.", 
    "88": "To test this hypothesis, we developed an experimental hypercholesterolemic rabbit model. New Zealand White rabbits (n=48) were studied: group 1 (n=16), normal diet; group 2 (n=16), 1% (wt/wt) cholesterol diet; and group 3 (n=16), 1% (wt/wt) cholesterol diet plus atorvastatin (3 mg/kg per day). The aortic valves were examined with hematoxylin and eosin stain, Masson trichrome, macrophage (RAM 11), proliferation cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and osteopontin immunostains. Cholesterol and highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) serum levels were obtained by standard assays. Computerized morphometry and digital image analysis were performed for quantifying PCNA (% area). Electron microscopy and immunogold labeling were performed for osteopontin. Semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed for the osteoblast bone markers [alkaline phosphatase, osteopontin, and osteoblast lineage-specific transcription factor (Cbfa-1)]. There was an increase in cholesterol, hsCRP, PCNA, RAM 11, and osteopontin and osteoblast gene markers (alkaline phosphatase, osteopontin, and Cbfa-1) in the cholesterol-fed rabbits compared with control rabbits. All markers except hsCRP were reduced by atorvastatin.", 
    "89": "These findings of increased macrophages, PCNA levels, and bone matrix proteins in the aortic valve during experimental hypercholesterolemia provide evidence of a proliferative atherosclerosis-like process in the aortic valve associated with the transformation to an osteoblast-like phenotype that is inhibited by atorvastatin.", 
    "90": "Evidence based treatment of cardiovascular risk factors on outcome in women is still inconclusive given the very large numbers needed to achieve a significant difference in cardiovascular event. Although numerous studies of the effect of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on risk factors have suggested benefit, the only data from a randomised control trial of HRT in secondary prevention was neutral. Coronary disease-primary prevention: (a) Statins: Air Force/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention Study (AFCAPS/TEX CAPS). The only randomised controlled trial (RCT) to include women. There were fewer coronary heart disease (CHD) events in women but no difference in mortality. (b) HRT: no completed RCT-the results from Womens Health Initiative (WHI) and Women Intervention Study of Long Duration of Oestrogen in the Menopause (WISDOM) are awaited, the former likely to complete in 2004. There are numerous reports of positive observational epidemiological studies for HRT. There is little evidence for statin use in women who will probably not qualify for treatment on global CHD risk assessment, familial hypercholesterolemia and type 2 diabetes excepted. HRT is, therefore, not only appropriate for its multiple effects on lipoproteins, vascular function and insulin sensitivity but also for prevention of osteoporosis. Coronary disease-", 
    "91": "(a) Statins: the major measurable effect of these drugs is to reduce total and LDL cholesterol. In RCT trials, the Scandanavian Simvastatin Survival Study (4S), the Cholesterol and Recurrent Event (CARE) and Long-term Intervention with Pravastatin in Ischaemic Disease (LIPID), approximately 20% of subjects were female, in whom CHD events, but not CHD or total mortality were reduced. (b) HRT: there is data available from a single RCT of continuous combined premarin and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) against placebo, The Heart Estrogen Replacement Study (HERS). A study of 2763 women and mean duration of 4.1 years. This study was neutral, with no reduction in CHD events or mortality. There were more events in the first year, and fewer in years 3-5. Other studies of HRT have been observational and positive for HRT. The effects of treatment on lipoproteins with statins, HRT and combination of statin and HRT have been investigated. In secondary prevention for hyperlipidemic women to achieve cholesterol <5, low density lipoprotein (LDL)<3 mmol/l statins will be first choice, possibly with HRT additionally for its other benefits on cardiovascular risk factors.", 
    "92": "By the year 2025, there will be more than 300 million type 2 diabetes sufferers worldwide. This epidemic will be followed by a wave of cardiovascular disease. Diabetes is in fact a serious vascular disease with poor prognosis, and not only a disease characterized by elevated blood glucose. If adequate attention were paid to this, it would be much easier to relieve the burden of cardiovascular disease in type 2 diabetes patients. One important cardiovascular risk factor in type 2 diabetic people is dyslipidemia. This is characterized by low HDL-cholesterol, high serum VLDL-triglycerides, and a preponderance of small, dense LDL. Even slight elevations of LDL-cholesterol in type 2 diabetic patients are associated with a substantial increase in cardiovascular risk. The composition of lipid particles in diabetic dyslipidemia is more atherogenic than in dyslipidemia in general. This means in turn that normal lipid concentrations are more atherogenic in diabetic than in non-diabetic patients. Retrospective analyses show that, in terms of protection from cardiovascular endpoints, the benefit of lipid lowering in type 2 diabetic patients is at least as great as in the non-diabetic population. Lowering of LDL-cholesterol is a very attractive target for the reduction of coronary heart disease in type 2 diabetic people.", 
    "93": "Exaggerated postprandial hyperlipidemia has been associated with cardiovascular disease. The mechanisms underlying this association are likely to depend on a multitude of effects. Potentially atherogenic remnants of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL) accumulate in the postprandial state. In addition, TRL may promote the formation of small dense LDL. There are some indications that the postprandial period is a hypercoagulable state and endothelial function seems to be hampered after acute fat intake. Conventional lipid lowering drugs such as statins and fibrates have the potency of reducing postprandial hyperlipidemia, but the fibrates seem to be more effective in this respect. There is a complete lack of prospective studies linking inefficient postprandial lipid metabolism with clinical endpoints and there is also a need to include investigations of postprandial lipid metabolism in the evaluation of novel drugs affecting lipid metabolism and insulin resistance.", 
    "94": "The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) are effective in reducing the risk of coronary events, and are generally very well tolerated. However, simvastatin, lovastatin, cerivastatin and atorvastatin are biotransformed in the liver primarily by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, and clinical experience has shown that the risk of adverse effect, such as myopathy, increases with concomitant use of statins with drugs that substantially inhibit CYP 3A4 at therapeutic doses. Indeed, pharmacokinetic interactions (e.g. increased bioavailability), myositis, and rhabdomyolysis have been reported following concurrent use of atorvastatin, cerivastatin, simvastatin or lovastatin and cyclosporine A, mibefradil or nefazodone. In contrast, fluvastatin (mainly metabolized by CYP 2C9) and pravastatin (eliminated by other metabolic routes) are less subject to this interaction. Nevertheless, an increase in pravastatin bioavailability has been reported in the presence of cyclosporine A, possibly because of an interaction at the level of biliary excretion. In summary, some statins may have lower adverse drug interaction potential than others, which is an important determinant of safety during long-term therapy.", 
    "95": "The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase inhibitors or statins are potent inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis. Several large clinical trials have demonstrated that these agents reduce serum cholesterol levels and the incidence of cardiovascular diseases. However, overlap and meta-analyses of these clinical trials suggest that the beneficial effects of statins may extend beyond their effects on serum cholesterol levels. Because statins also inhibit the synthesis of isoprenoid intermediates in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, they may have pleiotropic effects on the vascular wall. In particular, the ability of statins to decrease the incidence of ischemic stroke highlights some of their non-cholesterol effects since serum cholesterol levels are poorly correlated with the risk for ischemic stroke.", 
    "96": "3-Hydroxy-3-methhylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, or statins, are effective lipid lowering agents, extensively used in medical practice [Circulation 2000;101:207; J Am Med Assoc 2000;283:2935]. Statins have never been shown to be involved in the immune response, although reports have suggested a better outcome of cardiac transplantation in patients under pravastatin therapy [New Engl J Med 1995;333:621; Circulation 1997;96:1398]. Major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC class II) molecules are directly involved in the activation of T lymphocytes and in the control of the immune response. Whereas only a limited number of specialized cell types express MHC-II constitutively, numerous other cells become MHC-II positive upon induction by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) [Annu Rev Immunol 1996;14:301]. This complex regulation is under the control of the transactivator CIITA [Science 1994;265:106]. Recently, we demonstrated that statins act as direct inhibitors of induction of MHC-II expression by IFN-gamma and thus as repressors of MHC-II-mediated T cell activation [Nat Med 2000;6:1399; Swiss Med Wkly 2001;131:41]. This effect of statins is due to inhibition of the inducible promoter IV of the transactivator CIITA. Interestingly, this inhibition is specific for inducible MHC-II expression and does not concern constitutive expression of CIITA and MHC-II. In repressing induction of MHC-II, and subsequent T lymphocyte activation, statins therefore behave as a novel type of immunomodulator. This unexpected effect provides a scientific rationale for suggesting the use of statins as novel immunosuppressors, not only in organ transplantation but in numerous other pathologies as well.", 
    "97": "Pitavastatin (CAS 147526-32-7, NK-104), the first totally synthetic 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor discovered in Japan, was examined. Pitavastatin significantly decreased the serum levels of total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) at doses of 1 mg/day or more, and significant dose-dependence of the effect of this drug was observed within the dose range from 1 mg/day to 4 mg/day. It also significantly decreased the serum levels of triglycerides (TG) within this dose range. There was no dose-dependence of the incidence of adverse reactions to pitavastatin.", 
    "98": "Taste buds are a heterogeneous population of cells exhibiting diverse morphological and biochemical characteristics. Because taste buds arise from multiple progenitors, the different types of taste cells may represent distinct lineages. The present study was undertaken to determine the following: (1) how many progenitors contribute to a taste bud, and (2) whether the specific subpopulation of serotonin-immunoreactive (IR) taste cells are related by lineage to a restricted set of progenitor cells. These questions were addressed using cell lineage analysis of taste buds from H253 X-inactivation mosaic mice. After random X-inactivation of the lacZ transgene, the tongue of hemizygous female mice displays discrete patches of epithelial cells, which are either beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) positive or beta-gal negative. By analyzing the proportion of the two differently stained cell populations in taste buds located at the boundary between positive and negative epithelial patches, we can determine the minimum number of progenitors that may contribute to the formation of a taste bud. The presence of taste buds containing only 6-12% labeled cells indicates that at least eight progenitors contribute to an average taste bud of 55 cells, assuming progenitors contribute equally to the cell population. Cell lineage analysis of serotonin-IR taste cells in such mixed taste buds suggests that this subpopulation likely arises from only one to two progenitors and often is related by lineage. Thus, at least some of the cell types in a taste bud represent distinct lineages of cells and are not merely phenotypic stages as a cell progresses from a young to a mature state.", 
    "99": "Clinical trials with statins have demonstrated a marked reduction of cardiovascular mortality. However, it remains controversial whether these clinical benefits stem from powerful cholesterol-lowering effects of statins or whether they are due in part to their cholesterol-independent effects on vascular function, plaque growth, plaque rupture, or thrombosis. The identification of several mechanisms through which statins decrease the recruitment of monocytes and T cells into the arterial wall and inhibit T cell activation and proliferation in vitro have prompted speculations that immunomodulatory effects of statins may be beneficial in recipients of organ transplants. Hypercholesterolemia is frequent in these patients, and delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions in the arterial walls of the graft may be compounded by chronic inflammation associated with conventional atherogenesis. To assess the potential clinical relevance of immunomodulatory effects of statins, the role of the immune system in atherogenesis and the effects of statins in vitro in experimental models and in clinical trials will be reviewed. It is concluded that despite solid in vitro evidence, clinical evidence for an independent immunosuppressive effect of statins in organ transplant patients is presently insufficient; however, further investigation of their in vivo occurrence and clinical relevance is warranted.",

    "101": "Transforming growth factor-beta(1) is a multifunctional growth factor/cytokine involved in many physiologic and pathologic processes, such as vascular remodeling and atherogenesis.

In addition, isolated blood monocytes were subjected to pravastatin treatment and evaluated for TGF-beta(1) messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression and TGF-beta(1) in vitro production.", 
    "103": "Lipid-lowering treatment significantly decreased total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol plasma levels. Pravastatin, but not a low lipid diet, induced a significant increase in TGF-beta(1) plasma levels (from 1.7 +/- 0.5 ng/ml to 3.1 +/- 1.1 ng/ml, p < 0.001) and in ex vivo monocyte production (from 1.8 +/- 0.8 ng/ml to 3.9 +/- 1.0 ng/ml, p < 0.001). The increase in TGF-beta(1) levels was not related to the changes in the lipid profile observed with pravastatin. An increase of approximately twofold in TGF-beta(1) production and in mRNA expression was also observed after in vitro treatment of human monocytes with pravastatin (5 microM). Co-incubation with mevalonate reversed the in vitro effect of pravastatin.",

In order to assess the mechanism by which LDL cholesterol interferes with platelet production of O2-, human platelets were incubated with LDL cholesterol in the presence of either an inhibitor of the phospholipaseA2 enzyme, AACOCF3, or an inhibitor of NADH/NADPH oxidases, DPI.", 
    "108": "O2- platelet generation was significantly higher (p <0.001) and significantly related to LDL cholesterol (p <0.001 ) in patients as compared to controls. 8-week treatment with 10 mg/day atorvastatin significantly reduced both LDL cholesterol and O2- platelet production. This effect was partially related to the cholesterol-lowering, in that three days of treatment with atorvastatin significantly decreased platelet O2- production, while no significant change in LDL-cholesterol levels was observed. Platelets incubated with LDL cholesterol showed an increased O2- production, which was significantly inhibited by AACOCF3 (-78%) and DPI (-56%).", 
    "109": "LDL cholesterol increases platelet O2- production by activating PLA2 and NADH/NADPH enzymes.

    "110": "Atherosclerotic heart disease and osteoporosis are both diseases of old age. Evidence is accumulating for a link between vascular and bone disease. Calcification is a common feature of atherosclerotic plaques, and osteoporosis is associated with both atherosclerosis and vascular calcification. However, the relationship of vascular calcification to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis remains incompletely understood. Hormone replacement therapy has beneficial effects in the prevention of both atherosclerosis and osteoporosis. Bisphosphonates inhibit bone resorption and are used in the treatment of osteoporosis, whereas the statins inhibit cholesterol biosynthesis and are used for the treatment of atherosclerosis. We have reviewed recent advances in the knowledge of the actions of bisphosphonates and statins at the cellular, molecular and end-organ levels in order to examine the relationship between cardiovascular disease and osteoporosis and to explore the link between lipids and bones. These studies suggest that the mechanism of actions of these two classes of drugs at the cellular level may not be mutually exclusive. There are some early clinical data to complement these findings, suggesting that statins increase bone density and bisphosphonates may have a beneficial effect in vivo on plasma lipid levels and on the atherosclerotic process. Properly designed prospective studies that examine the effect of statins on bone density and fractures, as well as the effects of bisphosphonates on lipid profiles, atherosclerotic progression and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality are needed to define clearly the clinical effects and potential new roles for these agents.",

Six patients were also taking one or more drugs with known interaction with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (gemfibrozil, ketoconazole, calcium channel antagonists, dothiepin, celecoxib, amiodarone). All patients had weakness, 8 had myalgias, and 3 had myoglobinuria. Peak creatine kinase (CK) elevation ranged from 1100 to 160,000 U/L (median, 16,000 U/L).

The LV ejection fraction (EF) decreased from 2 weeks to 1 month (P<0.05) and then increased over the year (P=0.02). Throughout the study period the sphericity index increased. There was a significant and progressive decrease in LV mass index over the year, which was associated with a decrease in wall thickness at both the infarct and non-infarct sites. Independent predictors of an early increase in LVESVI were increasing age, increasing CK-MB and not receiving treatment with a statin.",

Classical remodelling occurred up to 1 month, but thereafter was attenuated.

    "119": "Despite the widespread use of coronary stents, prevention of restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) remains a major challenge. The restenotic process is even higher after balloon angioplasty without stenting and has been shown to be in the range of 30-50%. Experimental data suggest that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase inhibitors (\"statins\") might have a beneficial effect on restenosis after coronary angioplasty. Proposed mechanisms include favorable effects on plasma lipoproteins, endothelial function, plaque architecture and stability, thrombosis and inflammation. Although statins have documented efficacy in reducing clinical events and angiographic disease progression in patients with coronary atherosclerosis, the results of subsequent large prospective clinical trials using different types of statins clearly demonstrate that statins do not have a short-to-medium term effect on prevention of restenosis after successful conventional PTCA. The underlying pathological reasons for this shortcoming as well as promising innovative approaches including gene therapy and local drug delivery of vasoactive substances will be discussed in this review.", 
    "120": "The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are effective in both the primary and secondary prevention of ischaemic heart disease. As a group, these drugs are well tolerated apart from two uncommon but potentially serious adverse effects: elevation of liver enzymes and skeletal muscle abnormalities, which range from benign myalgias to life-threatening rhabdomyolysis. Adverse effects with statins are frequently associated with drug interactions because of their long-term use in older patients who are likely to be exposed to polypharmacy. The recent withdrawal of cerivastatin as a result of deaths from rhabdomyolysis illustrates the clinical importance of such interactions. Drug interactions involving the statins may have either a pharmacodynamic or pharmacokinetic basis, or both. As these drugs are highly extracted by the liver, displacement interactions are of limited importance. The cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme system plays an important part in the metabolism of the statins, leading to clinically relevant interactions with other agents, particularly cyclosporin, erythromycin, itraconazole, ketoconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, that are also metabolised by this enzyme system. An additional complicating feature is that individual statins are metabolised to differing degrees, in some cases producing active metabolites. The CYP3A family metabolises lovastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin and cerivastatin, whereas CYP2C9 metabolises fluvastatin. Cerivastatin is also metabolised by CYP2C8. Pravastatin is not significantly metabolised by the CYP system. In addition, the statins are substrates for P-glycoprotein, a drug transporter present in the small intestine that may influence their oral bioavailability. In clinical practice, the risk of a serious interaction causing myopathy is enhanced when statin metabolism is markedly inhibited. Thus, rhabdomyolysis has occurred following the coadministration of cyclosporin, a potent CYP3A4 and P-glycoprotein inhibitor, and lovastatin. Itraconazole has been shown to increase exposure to simvastatin and its active metabolite by at least 10-fold. Pharmacodynamically, there is an increased risk of myopathy when statins are coprescribed with fibrates or nicotinic acid. This occurs relatively infrequently, but is particularly associated with the combination of cerivastatin and gemfibrozil. Statins may also alter the concentrations of other drugs, such as warfarin or digoxin, leading to alterations in effect or a requirement for clinical monitoring. Knowledge of the pharmacokinetic properties of the statins should allow the avoidance of the majority of drug interactions. If concurrent therapy with known inhibitors of statin metabolism is necessary, the patient should be monitored for signs and symptoms of myopathy or rhabdomyolysis and the statin should be discontinued if necessary.", 
    "121": "Patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) have a high incidence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality from premature atherosclerosis, and the efficacy of pharmacological therapy has been limited. We evaluated the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ezetimibe, a novel cholesterol absorption inhibitor, in a multicenter, double-blind, randomized trial of HoFH patients receiving atorvastatin or simvastatin. Methods and Results- Fifty patients with a diagnosis of HoFH on the National Cholesterol Education Program Step 1 or stricter diet and taking open-label atorvastatin 40 mg/d or simvastatin 40 mg/d (statin-40) with (n=25) or without (n=25) concomitant LDL apheresis were randomized to 1 of 3 double-blind treatments: atorvastatin or simvastatin 80 mg/d (statin-80, n=17); ezetimibe 10 mg/d plus atorvastatin or simvastatin 40 mg/d (n=16); or ezetimibe 10 mg/d plus atorvastatin or simvastatin 80 mg/d (n=17) for 12 weeks. The primary end point was mean percentage change in LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) from statin-40 baseline to the end point for patients receiving statins alone (statin-80) versus patients receiving ezetimibe plus atorvastatin or simvastatin at either dose (ezetimibe plus statin-40/80). Ezetimibe plus statin-40/80 significantly reduced LDL-C levels compared with statin-80 (-20.7% versus -6.7%, P=0.007). In the high-dose statin cohorts, ezetimibe plus statin-80 reduced LDL-C by an additional 20.5% (P=0.0001) versus statin-80. Similar significant reductions in LDL-C concentrations were observed for patients with genotype-confirmed HoFH (n=35). Ezetimibe was safe and well tolerated.",

    "123": "Membrane-dependent coagulation processes play a key role in acute coronary syndromes (ACS), where the generation of thrombin depends on the complex of activated factors X and V (prothrombinase complex) assembled on activated platelets. The aim of the present study was to evaluate prothrombinase activity in patients with ACS and to examine the effect of treatment with 80 mg/day atorvastatin on prothrombinase activity. Blood samples were obtained at admission from 22 patients with ACS, and then again at 2 weeks and at 16 weeks after double-blind randomization to either placebo or atorvastatin. Prothrombinase activity was evaluated by measuring the generation of thrombin by in vitro reconstructed thrombi, and also by measuring plasma levels of prothrombin fragment F1 + 2. Twenty age-matched subjects with stable angina and 11 without coronary disease were used as controls. At admission, prothrombinase activity and F1 + 2 were significantly higher in ACS patients than in controls. Prothrombinase activity was still high at 2 weeks while it returned to normal levels at 16 weeks. F1 + 2 remained high both at 2 and at 16 weeks. Our data indicate that prothrombinase activity is high in patients with ACS, and that it is not affected by high-dose atorvastatin.", 
    "124": "We sought to determine whether a low-dose combination of a bile acid-binding resin (colestipol) with an hydroxymethylglutaryl CoA reductase inhibitor (pravastatin) would result in improved acceptability, compliance, and effectiveness in lipid-lowering compared with conventional therapy with a higher dose of a bile acid-binding resin only, with fewer side effects. We performed a randomized, crossover open-label clinical trial with two 18-wk medication regimens separated by an 8-wk washout period in 36 children and adolescents with familial hypercholesterolemia or familial combined hyperlipidemia. The regimens included colestipol 10 g/d (10 pills) versus a combination of colestipol 5 g/d with pravastatin 10 mg/d (six pills). All patients were maintained on a fat-reduced diet. Acceptability was better with the combination regimen. Mean compliance was similar and suboptimal (approximately 60%) with all medication components. Mean relative LDL cholesterol lowering was significantly better with the combination regimen (-17 +/- 16% versus -10 +/- 13%; p = 0.045), although insufficient to achieve recommended target values in the majority of patients on either regimen. Both regimens were equally free of adverse effects, with no important effect on chemistry or hematologic values. Patient-reported adverse effects were more common with the conventional-dose colestipol-only regimen. Compliance with medication regimens using the bile acid-binding resins is suboptimal, although combination with a low dose of a statin may result in better lipid lowering.", 
    "125": "Hepatic triacylglycerol secretion is elevated in insulin-resistant states. Microsomal diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) catalyzes the final reaction in the synthesis of triacylglycerol (TAG). We have previously described two DGAT activities in rat liver microsomes, one overt (cytosol-facing) and one latent (endoplasmic reticulum lumen-facing) (Owen MR, Corstorphine CG, Zammit VA: Overt and latent activities of diacylglycerol acytransferase in rat liver microsomes: possible roles in very-low-density lipoprotein triacylglycerol secretion. Biochem J 323:17-21, 1977). It was suggested that they are involved in the synthesis of TAG for the cytosolic droplet and VLDL lipidation, respectively. In the present study, we measured the overt and latent DGAT activities in rats fed diets containing one of two hypolipidemic drugs: fenofibrate (a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha [PPARalpha] agonist) and simvastatin (a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl [HMG]-CoA reductase inhibitor). We found that the activities of the two DGATs could be varied independently by these treatments. Fenofibrate raised overt DGAT activity but lowered that of latent DGAT. In contrast, simvastatin markedly lowered overt DGAT activity without affecting that of latent DGAT. The increase in overt DGAT activity induced by fenofibrate could not be mimicked by feeding a diet enriched in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), which lowered overt DGAT activity but did not affect latent DGAT, suggesting that n-3 PUFA act through a mechanism independent of PPARalpha activation. The fibrate-induced increase in overt DGAT activity and the inhibition of latent DGAT may provide a mechanism through which acyl moieties are retained within the liver for oxidation through the pathways concomitantly upregulated by PPARalpha activation.", 
    "126": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) are cholesterol-lowering drugs and reduce the risk of myocardial infarction and stroke. In this study we investigated whether rosuvastatin, a new, potent HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, upregulates endothelial nitric oxide (NO) expression and activity and protects from cerebral ischaemia in mice. Endothelial cells in culture and 129/SV mice were chronically treated with rosuvastatin. The expression and activity of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) was determined by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blotting and arginine-citrulline assays. Cerebral ischaemia was induced by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAo) for 2 h and infarct size was determined after 22 h of reperfusion. Treatment of endothelial cells with rosuvastatin concentration- and time-dependently upregulated eNOS mRNA and protein expression. In aortas of 129/SV wild-type mice, treatment with 0.2, 2, and 20 mg kg(-1) rosuvastatin subcutaneously (s.c.) for 10 days significantly upregulated eNOS mRNA by 50, 142, and 205%, respectively. NOS activity was significantly increased by 75, 145, and 320%, respectively. Stroke volume after 2-h MCAo was reduced by 27, 56, and 50% (for 0.2, 2 and 20 mg kg(-1), respectively). Serum cholesterol and triglygeride levels were not significantly lowered by the treatment. The novel HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor rosuvastatin dose-dependently upregulates eNOS expression and activity and protects from cerebral ischaemia in mice. The effects are independent of changes in cholesterol levels and are equivalent or even superior to the protective effects by simvastatin and atorvastatin in this animal model.", 
    "127": "The study was aimed to investigate the effect of two different statins on the levels of haemostatic variables reflecting procoagulant and fibrinolytic activity in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD), with the hypothesis that statins might beneficially modify these levels. Fifty-eight patients were randomized to treatment with atorvastatin (n=28) or simvastatin (n=30) for 1 year. The starting dose in both groups was 20 mg/day. Fasting blood samples were collected before and after 12-month treatment for determinations of fibrinogen, prothrombin fragment 1+2 (F1+2), plasma D-dimer, soluble tissue factor, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) antigen, tPA activity, plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 activity (PAI-1 activity) and serum D-dimer as a global test of fibrinolytic activity. In the total population, improved fibrinolytic activity was observed after 1 year with increased levels of serum D-dimer (P=.001) and tPA activity (P=.024) and a reduction in tPA antigen (P=.048). No statistically significant changes were observed in any of the measured coagulation variables. Separately examined, an improved fibrinolytic profile was seen in the atorvastatin group with a significant increase in serum D-dimer (P=.005), a borderline increase in tPA activity (P=.083) and a borderline reduction in tPA antigen (P=.069). Within the simvastatin group, a reduction in prothrombin F1+2 was observed (P=.038). The differences in changes between the groups were statistically significant only for global fibrinolysis (serum D-dimer, P=.046). In conclusion, an improved fibrinolytic profile was observed after statin treatment, most pronounced with atorvastatin. The results indicate that the drugs promote a profibrinolytic profile, and may in part explain the benefit of statin treatment rendered in the prevention of CHD.", 
    "128": "We investigated the effects of the statins, cerivastatin and fluvastatin, on the induction of nitric oxide (NO) production in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) stimulated by interleukin-1beta (IL-1) or in combination with interferon-gamma (IFN).", 
    "129": "We measured NO release, inducible NO synthase (iNOS) mRNA and protein levels, iNOS gene transcription rates, and iNOS mRNA stabilities in cytokine-activated VSMC. We also evaluated nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB activity and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) synthesis.", 
    "130": "NO production induced by cytokines was dose-dependently enhanced by both statins. Incubating VSMC with IL-1/IFN stimulated iNOS mRNA and protein expression. Both statins significantly upregulated IL-1/IFN-stimulated iNOS mRNA and protein expression, and enhanced iNOS gene transcription as shown by nuclear run-on assays. However, they did not alter the stability of iNOS mRNA. Both statins slightly modulated IL-1/IFN-induced NF-kappaB activation, which was not associated with their effect on NO production. Cytokines induce the de novo synthesis of BH4 in VSMC. This event is essential for the induction of NO synthesis, which requires transcriptional induction of the genes that encode not only iNOS but also guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase I (GTPCH), the first and rate-limiting enzyme in de novo BH4 synthesis. The synthesis of BH4 and GTPCH mRNA induced by IL-1/IFN were enhanced by both statins. Exogenous mevalonate significantly prevented and geranylgeranylpyrophosphate reversed the stimulatory effect of both statins. Furthermore, the geranylgeranyltransferase I inhibitor GGTI-298 significantly increased IL-1/IFN-induced NO production.", 
    "131": "Our data demonstrated that statins enhance immunostimulants-induced NO production by increasing iNOS gene expression at the transcriptional level via an NF-kappaB-independent pathway. The effect of statins on NO production is due at least partly through blocking the biosynthesis of mevalonate, which prevents isoprenoid biosynthesis. In addition to augmenting iNOS expression, statins potentiate GTPCH gene expression and BH4 synthesis, thereby preventing a relative shortage of BH4 which may shift the balance between NOS-catalyzed generation of protective NO and deleterious reactive oxygen species.", 
    "132": "The correlation between stroke incidence and serum lipid level has been equivocal, and conventional lipid-lowering agents such as fibrates were ineffective for stroke prevention. Recent clinical trials for HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors(statins) have demonstrated 20-30% reduction in the risk of cerebrovascular events and mortality in the population with previous coronary heart disease(CHD). The beneficial effect of statins was most evident for thromboembolic stroke, and no significant increase in hemorrhagic events was noted. Equal reduction in stroke risk was observed between hyper- and normocholesterolemic populations, indicating the non-lipid mechanisms of statins. The efficacy and safety of statin treatment make it a promising approach for the management of both CHD and non-CHD patients at high risk of stroke, especially the elderly.", 
    "133": "Currently, statin therapy is the first-line treatment for patients with hypercholesterolemia, although their effects on plasma triglyceride(TG) levels are modest and variable. Inhibition of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein(MTP), a key protein involved in the assembly of the apoB-containing lipoproteins, is an attractive lipid-lowering strategy. In animal models, MTP inhibitors have dramatic effects not only on plasma cholesterol and LDL levels but on TG levels as well, offering the potential for greater efficacy and plasma lipid control in both hypertriglyceridemia and mixed hyperlipidemia. Inhibitors of acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase(ACAT) present another strategy in treating atherosclerosis through direct inhibition of ACAT in macrophages of the arterial wall. Recent studies in mouse models of atherosclerosis lacking ACAT1, however, may argue against the selective inhibition of macrophage ACAT1.", 
    "134": "There are several drugs for hyperlipidemia except for statin and fibrate. Resin is a commonly used drug for hypercholesterolemia and is known to very useful for the prevention of coronary heart disease(CHD). Probucol is also used for hypercholesterolemia and recently is known that it prevent the restenosis of the coronary artery after PTCA. Nicotinic acid is used for hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia, both. It is also known to very useful for the prevention of CHD. Eicosapentaenoic acid is effective for hypertriglyceridemia and also shows an inhibition of platelets aggregation. These drugs as well as statin and fibrate are used in combination with each other for severe hyperlipidemia.", 
    "135": "The HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors reduce levels of low-density lipoproteins, raise high-density lipoproteins, and lower triglycerides. Treatment with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors reduces the risk of cardiovascular events across a broad spectrum of patient profiles, as evidenced by both primary and secondary prevention trials. Improved survival by way of reduced deaths from coronary heart disease was also reported with these agents, which are primarily indicated for substantial reduction in LDL-cholesterol levels. However, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are extremely complex drugs and exhibit a wide variety of vascular effects that may or may not be dependent on their lipid-modifying properties. These so-called pleiotropic effects include alternations of endothelial function, inflammation, coagulation and plaque stability. The relative contribution of the nonlipid effects of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor therapy to the well-documented clinical benefits is currently under intense investigation.", 
    "136": "An appearance of statin did not only cause fall of onset rate and the death rate of coronary arteries disease, but also a fall of the total death rate. These results are restraint of cardiovascular event, development and regression restraint of plaque, function improvement of plaque constitution cells, resulting in the decrease of the total death. However, most of the clinical lipid intervention trial were European and USA results, and there was a difference of a quantity of dosage, too, and results in a Japanese were waited for. Results of a clinical lipid intervention trials in a Japanese appeared by degrees, too though a little too late. From those results, it is proposed that hyperlipidemia is managed whether there are several risk factors of atherosclerosis except hyperlipidemia. Needless to say, it is for the greatest purpose of hyperlipidemia treatment to prevent the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Therefore, it is necessary to treat hyperlipidemia after having fully understood the function mechanism of lipid-lowering agents and after having thought about the morbid state of a patient. In addition, on the occasion of a combination treatment it is necessary to administer it after having understood the each other's function mechanism.", 
    "137": "Although C-reactive protein has been recently recognized as a useful marker of cardiovascular risk, much still needs to be clarified on the reference value among Japanese and predictive value of measuring the marker in hypercholesterolemic subjects. Upper limit of the reference value is found to be 2.0 mg/l among Japanese. CRP levels are influenced by the percentage of body fats. Increased level of C-reactive protein might indicate poor prognosis of the patients. Statin therapy was found to be effective in the primary prevention of cardiovascular events among persons with increased CRP.", 
    "138": "Recently, three large-scale clinical studies on hypercholesterolemia have been reported in Japan. The Kyushu Lipid Intervention Study(KLIS) was initiated investigate the effect of pravastatin, as compared with conventional hypolipidemic treatment, in the primary prevention of not only coronary events but also cerebral infarction in Japanese men with serum total cholesterol levels of 220 mg/dl or greater. A total of 5,640 patients were recruited. Adjusted relative risks of outcomes combined coronary events and cerebral infarction for pravastatin versus conventional treatment was 0.81(p = 0.08). The Pravastatin Anti-atherosclerosis Trial in the Elderly(PATE) is a prospective randomized controlled trial to determine the effectiveness of pravastatin on the incidence of cardiovascular events by comparing the effect of low dose(group L, 5 mg/day, n = 334) with the standard dose(group S, 10-20 mg/day, n = 331) in elderly patients aged more than 60 years old. The risk ratio for group S compared with group L was 0.674(95% confidence interval: 0.423-1.074). The Japan Lipid Intervention Trial(J-LIT) is the first nation-wide study conducted to determine a relationship between serum lipid concentrations and the development of CHD under simvastatin treatment. The J-LIT study enrolled 52,421 men and women with total cholesterol(TC) more than 220 mg/dl. Patients were treated with open-labeled simvastatin at a dose of 5 to 10 mg/day for 6 years. Simvastatin reduced serum concentrations of TC, LDL-C and TG by 18.4, 26.8 and 16.1%, respectively. LDL-C positively correlated with the CHD events and the relative risk of CHD was higher significantly more than 160 mg/dl of LDL-C."
