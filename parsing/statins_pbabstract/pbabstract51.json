It aims to prevent treatment interruption as a result of patients' inability to obtain a new valid prescription. The only currently eligible patients for this service are statin and/or oral contraceptives users who have been using these medications for 6 months or more, have not utilized the CD method during the last 12 months, and cannot obtain an immediate appointment with the prescriber in order to get a new prescription. This study aimed to investigate patients' attitudes towards potential extension and expansion of this medication supply method. Methods. A randomly selected 301 users of these medications from all Australian States were recruited using Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI). Result. The response rate was 79%. The majority of the participants (73.3%) did not agree with current restriction on CD utilization frequency. They also supported, to varying degrees, inclusion of all the proposed medications (support ranged from 44.2-78.4%). In this regard, participants who suffered from a specific disease did not differ significantly from those without the disease except in case of patients with depression (p = 0.001). Conclusions. Participants of this study strongly supported both CD extension and expansion. A future critical review of the current version of CD is highly recommended in order to enhance CD capability to achieve its goals.",

However, the mechanism underlying its ability to regulate blood lipid metabolism is unclear. We set out to study this through assessing the effects of Pu-erh tea aqueous extract (PTAE) on the central enzymes of blood lipid metabolism, including lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2), lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) and pancreatic lipase (PL). We find that the Lp-PLA2, HMRG and PL activities are inhibited by PTAE in a dose-dependent manner and that the LCAT activity tends to increase with increasing PTAE concentrations. Lineweaver-Burk plot analyses reveal that PTAE acts as a competitive inhibitor for HMGR and PL and as a noncompetitive inhibitor for Lp-PLA2. Moreover, we determine that its active ingredients include catechins, gallic acid, caffeine, free amino acids, and soluble sugar. However, the effect of each ingredient and whether any of them have synergistic effects are still unknown. The results suggest that Pu-erh tea has a potent ability to regulate blood lipid metabolism and knowledge of the mechanisms provides insights into its potential therapeutic application as an alternative hypolipidemic drug.",

Systemic inflammation and oxidation were also promoted as revealed by increased serum levels of high sensitive C-reactive protein (Hs-CRP) and malondialdehyde (MDA). Notably, endothelial function has been impaired significantly as reflected by decreased nitric oxide (NO) production and increased serum asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) level. RhoA associated kinase (ROCK) activity was also profoundly enhanced (P < 0.05). Inter-group comparisons showed that when compared to untreated group, modest improvements of endothelial function, inflammation and oxidation were observed in rosuvastatin and fasudil groups (P > 0.05). These benefits were improved more prominently in combined group (P < 0.05). Intra-group comparisons also showed that when compared to 2 weeks of dyslipidemia, slight improvement of endothelial function, inflammation and oxidation in rosuvastatin and fasudil groups were observed (P > 0.05).

Statins influence haemostatic factors, but their effect on plasma D-dimer levels is controversial. Therefore, the aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the association between statin therapy and plasma D-dimer levels. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Scopus and EMBASE (up to September 25, 2014) to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the impact of statin therapy on plasma D-dimer levels. Two independent reviewers extracted data on study characteristics, methods and outcomes. Meta-analysis of data from nine RCTs with 1,165 participants showed a significant effect of statin therapy in reducing plasma D-dimer levels (standardised mean difference [SMD]: -0.988 \u00b5g/ml, 95\u2009% confidence interval [CI]: -1.590 - -0.385, p=0.001). The effect size was robust in sensitivity analysis and omission of no single study significantly changed the overall estimated effect size. In the subgroup analysis, the effect of statins on plasma D-dimer levels was significant only in the subsets of studies with treatment duration \u2265\u200912 weeks (SMD: -0.761 \u00b5g/ml, 95\u2009%CI: -1.163- -0.360; p<\u20090.001), and for lipophilic statins (atorvastatin and simvastatin) (SMD: -1.364 \u00b5g/ml, 95\u2009% CI: -2.202- -0.526; p=0.001). Hydrophilic statins (pravastatin and rosuvastatin) did not significantly reduce plasma D-dimer levels (SMD: -0.237 \u00b5g/ml, 95\u2009%CI: -1.140-0.665, p=0.606). This meta-analysis of RCTs suggests a decrease of plasma D-dimer levels after three months of statin therapy, and especially after treatment with lipophilic statins. Well-designed trials are required to validate these results.",

In total, 41,102 women responded to a web-based questionnaire, and had raw digital mammograms stored. Volumetric mammographic density was measured using Volpara\u2122 and information on statin use was obtained through linkage with the Swedish National Prescription Register. Analysis of covariance was used to study the effect of statin use on mammographic density, adjusting for a large set of potential confounders.

After multivariable adjustment, percent dense volume was lower in statin users than in non-users (P < 0.001). This association was explained by a larger absolute non-dense volume in statin users (P < 0.001). Overall, no difference in absolute dense volume was detected, but interaction analyses revealed a larger dense volume among statin users who reported ever HRT use (P = 0.03). No differential effects were observed according to statin lipophilicity and treatment duration.",

    "15": "The present work was aimed at developing an optimized oral nanostructured lipid carrier (NLC) formulation of poorly soluble atorvastatin Ca (AT Ca) and assessing its in vitro release, oral bioavailability and pharmacodynamic activity. In this study, chlorogenic acid, a novel excipient having synergistic cholesterol lowering activity was utilized and explored in NLC formulation development. The drug-loaded NLC formulations were prepared using a high pressure homogenization technique and optimized by the Box-Behnken statistical design using the Design-Expert software. The optimized NLC formulation was composed of oleic acid and stearic acid as lipid phase (0.9% w/v), poloxamer 188 as surfactant (1% w/v) and chlorogenic acid (0.05% w/v). The mean particle size, polydispersity index (PDI) and % drug entrapment efficiency of optimized NLC were 203.56\u2009\u00b1\u20098.57\u2009nm, 0.27\u2009\u00b1\u20090.028 and 83.66\u2009\u00b1\u20095.69, respectively. In vitro release studies showed that the release of drug from optimized NLC formulations were markedly enhanced as compared to solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) and drug suspension. The plasma concentration time profile of AT Ca in rats showed 3.08- and 4.89-fold increase in relative bioavailability of developed NLC with respect to marketed preparation (ATORVA\u00ae tablet) and drug suspension, respectively. Pharmacodynamic study suggested highly significant (**p\u2009<\u20090.01) reduction in the cholesterol and triglyceride values by NLC in comparison with ATORVA\u00ae tablet. Therefore, the results of in vivo studies demonstrated promising prospects for successful oral delivery of AT Ca by means of its chlorogenic acid integrated NLC.", 
    "16": "In patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), early management is of prime importance. However, the median time taken by the patient to call the emergency services is often very long, up to 2 hours. The presence of a physician as first responder ensures good quality resuscitation in case of cardiac arrest, and allows recording of a first ECG, which can be very informative, especially in ACS without ST segment elevation. Treatment at this stage is limited to sublingual nitroglycerin and aspirin. If the first ECG shows ST segment elevation, the patient should be immediately oriented for reperfusion, usually by percutaneous coronary intervention. in the absence of ST segment elevation, the diagnosis of ACS remains unconfirmed. This does not imply that the risk is lesser, but rather that the risk cannot be evaluated accurately in the pre-hospital setting. The use of risk scores can guide the choice of management towards an invasive strategy, including coronary angiography (immediately, or within 24-72 hours). Low-risk patients are candidates for an invasive strategy, provided non-invasive tests demonstrate the presence of ischemia. During the hospital phase, antiplatelet treatment should be initiated and must be adapted to the patient bleeding and thrombotic risk. Clopidogrel is recommended only in patients who are not amenable to prasugrel or ticagrelor. Statin therapy should be initiated from day one, regardless of the initial cholesterol level, preferably with 80 mg atorvastatin. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and beta-blockers should also be prescribed to complete the medical prescription both in-hospital and in the long term.", 
    "17": "Despite significant reduction of cardiovascular events by statin treatment, substantial residual risk persists, driving emerging needs for the development of new therapies. We identified a novel cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor, K-312, that raises HDL and lowers LDL cholesterol levels in animals. K-312 also suppresses hepatocyte expression of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9 (PCSK9), a molecule that increases LDL cholesterol. We explored the underlying mechanism for the reduction of PCSK9 expression by K-312. K-312 inhibited in vitro human plasma CETP activity (IC50; 0.06 \u03bcM). Administration of K-312 to cholesterol-fed New Zealand White rabbits for 18 wk raised HDL cholesterol, decreased LDL cholesterol, and attenuated aortic atherosclerosis. Our search for additional beneficial characteristics of this compound revealed that K-312 decreases PCSK9 expression in human primary hepatocytes and in the human hepatoma cell line HepG2. siRNA silencing of CETP in HepG2 did not compromise the suppression of PCSK9 by K-312, suggesting a mechanism independent of CETP. In HepG2 cells, K-312 treatment decreased the active forms of sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBP-1 and -2) that regulate promoter activity of PCSK9. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that K-312 decreased the occupancy of SREBP-1 and SREBP-2 on the sterol regulatory element of the PCSK9 promoter. PCSK9 protein levels decreased by K-312 treatment in the circulating blood of cholesterol-fed rabbits, as determined by two independent mass spectrometry approaches, including the recently developed, highly sensitive parallel reaction monitoring method. New CETP inhibitor K-312 decreases LDL cholesterol and PCSK9 levels, serving as a new therapy for dyslipidemia and cardiovascular disease.",

Prevention of acute or chronic rejection demands the use of immunosuppression. However, nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, cardiovascular disease, post-transplantation diabetes mellitus, chronic graft dysfunction and dyslipidemia may all occur as complications of immunosuppressive therapy. Dyslipidemia is a significant problem in renal transplant recipients due to the fact that it increases the risk of cardiovascular mortality in patients in whom the risk is already higher than in the general population. Very often, there is an interaction between immunosuppressive drugs, especially cyclosporine, and drugs that are used in the treatment of dyslipidemia. We present a case of a patient who developed severe hepatotoxicity after the introduction of atorvastatin in a cyclosporine-based immunosuppressive regimen. After discontinuation of atorvastatin and replacement of cyclosporine with everolimus, liver chemistries returned to normal values.", 
    "23": "Statins are widely prescribed medicines and are also available in fixed dose combinations with other drugs to treat several chronic ailments. Given the safety issues associated with statins it may be important to assess feasibility of a single time concentration strategy for prediction of exposure (area under the curve; AUC). The peak concentration (Cmax) was used to establish relationship with AUC separately for pravastatin and simvastatin using published pharmacokinetic data. The regression equations generated for statins were used to predict the AUC values from various literature references. The fold difference of the observed divided by predicted values along with correlation coefficient (r) were used to judge the feasibility of the single time point approach. Both pravastatin and simvastatin showed excellent correlation of Cmax vs. AUC values with r value \u2265 0.9638 (p<0.001). The fold difference was within 0.5-fold to 2-fold for 220 out of 227 AUC predictions and >81% of the predicted values were in a narrower range of >0.75-fold but <1.5-fold difference. Predicted vs. observed AUC values showed excellent correlation for pravastatin (r=0.9708, n=115; p<0.001) and simvastatin (r=0.9810; n=117; p<0.001) suggesting the utility of Cmax for AUC predictions. On the basis of the present work, it is feasible to develop a single concentration time point strategy that coincides with Cmax occurrence for both pravastatin and simvastatin from a therapeutic drug monitoring perspective.",

Phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP) is an HDL-associated protein involved in reverse cholesterol transport. This study sought to determine the genetic and nongenetic predictors of plasma PLTP activity (PLTPa), and separately, to determine whether PLTPa predicted carotid artery disease (CAAD). PLTPa was measured in 1,115 European ancestry participants from a case-control study of CAAD. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to elucidate the relationship between PLTPa and CAAD. Separately, a stepwise linear regression determined the nongenetic clinical and laboratory characteristics that best predicted PLTPa. A final stepwise regression considering both nongenetic and genetic variables identified the combination of covariates that explained maximal PLTPa variance.

    "35": "Familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) is a common genetic cause of premature coronary heart disease (CHD). Globally, one baby is born with FH every minute. If diagnosed and treated early in childhood, individuals with FH can have normal life expectancy. This consensus paper aims to improve awareness of the need for early detection and management of FH children. Familial hypercholesterolaemia is diagnosed either on phenotypic criteria, i.e. an elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level plus a family history of elevated LDL-C, premature coronary artery disease and/or genetic diagnosis, or positive genetic testing. Childhood is the optimal period for discrimination between FH and non-FH using LDL-C screening. An LDL-C \u22655 mmol/L (190 mg/dL), or an LDL-C \u22654 mmol/L (160 mg/dL) with family history of premature CHD and/or high baseline cholesterol in one parent, make the phenotypic diagnosis. If a parent has a genetic defect, the LDL-C cut-off for the child is \u22653.5 mmol/L (130 mg/dL). We recommend cascade screening of families using a combined phenotypic and genotypic strategy. In children, testing is recommended from age 5 years, or earlier if homozygous FH is suspected. A healthy lifestyle and statin treatment (from age 8 to 10 years) are the cornerstones of management of heterozygous FH. Target LDL-C is <3.5 mmol/L (130 mg/dL) if >10 years, or ideally 50% reduction from baseline if 8-10 years, especially with very high LDL-C, elevated lipoprotein(a), a family history of premature CHD or other cardiovascular risk factors, balanced against the long-term risk of treatment side effects. Identifying FH early and optimally lowering LDL-C over the lifespan reduces cumulative LDL-C burden and offers health and socioeconomic benefits. To drive policy change for timely detection and management, we call for further studies in the young. Increased awareness, early identification, and optimal treatment from childhood are critical to adding decades of healthy life for children and adolescents with FH.",

Statins are the most widely prescribed cholesterol-lowering drugs with the ability to inhibit HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A) reductase. Preclinical and clinical safety data have shown that statins do not cause serious adverse effects in humans. However, their long-term administration is associated with a variety of myopatic complaints. The aim of this study was to investigate whether CoQ10 supplementation of animals under high fat diet (HFD) treated with statins is able to bypass the mitochondrial metabolic defects or not? Animals were divided into 7 groups and fed with either regular (RD) or HFD during experiments. The first group considered as regular control and fed with a RD. Groups 2-7 including HFD control, CoQ10 (10mg/kg), simvastatin (30mg/kg), atorvastatin (30mg/kg), simvastatin+CoQ10 or atorvastatin+CoQ10 treated orally for 30 days and fed with HFD. At the end of treatments, the animals were killed and blood samples were collected for biochemical examinations. The rat liver mitochondria were isolated and several mitochondrial indices including succinate dehydrogenase activity (SDA), ATP levels, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPP) were determined. We found that triglyceride (Tg), cholesterol (Chol) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) were augmented with HFD compared to RD and treatment with statins remarkably lowered the Tg, Chol and LDL levels. Mitochondrial parameters including, SDA, ATP levels, MMP and MPP were reduced with statin treatment and improved by co-administration with CoQ10.",

The progressive neuronal loss associated to cell death can be studied in vitro with a simplified model based on a biochemical block of the mevalonate pathway and a subsequent inflammatory trigger. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the mevalonate blocking on glial cells (BV-2) and the following effects on neuronal cells (SH-SY5Y) when the two populations were cultured together. To better understand the cross-talk between glial and neuronal cells, as it happens in vivo, BV-2 and SH-SY5Y were co-cultured in different experimental settings (alone, transwell, direct contact); the effect of mevalonate pathway biochemical block by Lovastatin, followed by LPS inflammatory trigger, were evaluated by analysing programmed cell death and mitochondrial membrane potential, cytokines' release and cells' morphology modifications. In this experimental condition, glial cells underwent an evident activation, confirmed by elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines release, typical of these disorders, and a modification in morphology. Moreover, the activation induced an increase in apoptosis. When glial cells were co-cultured with neurons, their activation caused an increase of programmed cell death also in neuronal cells, but only if the two populations were cultured in direct contact. Our findings, being aware of the limitations related to the cell models used, represent a preliminary step towards understanding the pathological and neuroinflammatory mechanisms occurring in mevalonate kinase diseases. Contact co-culture between neuronal and microglial cells seems to be a good model to study mevalonic aciduria in vitro, and to contribute to the identification of potential drugs able to block microglial activation for this orphan disease. In fact, in such a pathological condition, we demonstrated that microglial cells are activated and contribute to neuronal cell death. We can thus hypothesise that the use of microglial activation blockers could prevent this additional neuronal death.",

Since the early 1990 s, it has been known that statins could be successfully used in cancer therapy, but the exact mechanism(s) of statin activity remains unclear and is now an extensive focus of investigation. So far, it was proven that there are several mechanisms that are activated by statins in cancer cells; some of them are leading to cell death. Statins exert different effects depending on cell line, statin concentration, duration of exposure of cells to statins, and the type of statin being used. It was shown that statins may inhibit the cell cycle by influence on both expression and activity of proteins involved in cell-cycle progression such as cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK), and/or inhibitors of CDK. Also, statins may induce apoptosis by both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. Statin treatment may lead to changes in molecular pathways dependent on the EGF receptor, mainly via inhibition of isoprenoid synthesis. By inhibition of the synthesis of cholesterol, statins may destabilize the cell membrane. Moreover, statins may change the arrangement of transporter OATP1, the localization of HMGCR, and could induce conformational changes in GLUT proteins. In this review, we have tried to gather and compare most of the recent outcomes of the research in this field. We have also attempted to explain why hydrophilic statins are less effective than hydrophobic statins.

In spite of this, life expectancy continues to increase, and in Australia for people reaching the age of 65 years, it is now 84 years in men and 87 years in women.

Even those with CVD may be suboptimally treated, with one study showing treatment rates to fall from ~60% in those aged <50 years to <15% for those aged 85+ years. Treatment of the most elderly patient groups remains controversial partly from the lack of randomized trial intervention data and partly from the potential for adverse effects of lipid therapy.

    "104": "Statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors) are a group of highly efficient pharmacological agents used for reducing blood cholesterol level and prevention/treatment of cardiovascular disease. Adverse reactions during statin treatment affect quite significant numbers of patients (reportedly from 5% to 20%), with more side effects occurring at higher doses. Reduced statin dosing can be achieved by improved bioavailability of statins, which is fairly low due to poor aqueous solubility, low permeability and high molecular weight of some members of the statin family. Moreover, since hepatic cholesterologenesis is a main target of statin action and extrahepatic inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase has no effect on plasma lipids, hepatic bioavailability, in our opinion, becomes a new important modality of statins maximizing their potential effect on the plasma lipid profile and diminishing their extrahepatic toxicity. Therefore efficient delivery systems of statins into hepatocytes need to be developed and introduced. Uses of nano-emulsifying statin delivery systems which may include vectors of intrahepatic transport, in particular lycopene, are discussed. As a proof of concept, some preliminary results revealing the effect of a lycopene-containing nanoformulation of simvastatin (designated as Lyco-Simvastatin) on LDL in mildly hypercholesterolemic patients are shown.",

The 2013 cholesterol guideline better identifies high-risk patients with a greater burden of atherosclerosis and avoids treating those at lower risk with little atherosclerosis; its application would prevent up to 450 000 more atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events over 10 years. The 2013 cholesterol guideline also recommends regularly monitoring LDL-C levels to assess adherence to lifestyle and drug therapy, and adjusting treatment based on response to therapy and adverse events. Non-statins shown to reduce ASCVD events when added to statin therapy, and that have an acceptable margin of safety in randomized, controlled clinical trials, are preferred.

This study aimed to present the most recent results of specific literature about the effects of statins and its association with physical exercise on skeletal musculature. Thus, a literature review was performed using PubMed and SciELO databases, through the combination of the keywords \"statin\" AND \"exercise\" AND \"muscle\", restricting the selection to original studies published between January 1990 and November 2013. Sixteen studies evaluating the effects of statins in association with acute or chronic exercises on skeletal muscle were analyzed. Study results indicate that athletes using statins can experience deleterious effects on skeletal muscle, as the exacerbation of skeletal muscle injuries are more frequent with intense training or acute eccentric and strenuous exercises. Moderate physical training, in turn, when associated to statins does not increase creatine kinase levels or pain reports, but improves muscle and metabolic functions as a consequence of training. Therefore, it is suggested that dyslipidemic patients undergoing statin treatment should be exposed to moderate aerobic training in combination to resistance exercises three times a week, and the provision of physical training prior to drug administration is desirable, whenever possible.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the direct effects of statins on proinflammatory molecules in human AAA walls in ex vivo culture. Simvastatin strongly inhibited the activation of nuclear factor (NF)-\u03baB induced by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 in human AAA walls, but showed little effect on c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation. Simvastatin, as well as pitavastatin significantly reduced the secretion of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-2 and epithelial neutrophil-activating peptide (CXCL5) under both basal and TNF-\u03b1-stimulated conditions. Similar to statins, the Rac1 inhibitor NSC23766 significantly inhibited the activation of NF-\u03baB, accompanied by a decreased secretion of MMP-9, MCP-2 and CXCL5. Moreover, the effect of simvastatin and the JNK inhibitor SP600125 was additive in inhibiting the secretion of MMP-9, MCP-2 and CXCL5.

In cell cultures, statins diminish muscle oxygen consumption, promote mitochondrial permeability transient pore opening and generate apoptotic proteins. Animal models confirm the statin-induced decrease in muscle CoQ10, but reveal no changes in mitochondrial enzyme activities. Human studies yield contradictory results, with decreased CoQ10, elevated lipids, decreased enzyme activities in muscle and impaired maximal oxygen uptake in several but not all studies. Some patients are susceptible to statin-induced myopathy due to variations in genes encoding proteins involved in statin uptake and biotransformation such as the solute carrier organic anion transporter family member 1B1 (SLCO1B1) or cytochrome P450 (CYP2D6, CYP3A4, CYP3A5).

Available trial evidence indicates that neurocognitive adverse events may occur more commonly in individuals receiving an antibody to PCSK9, but these events are uncommon and have not been associated with on-treatment LDL-C levels. Moreover, it is unclear to what extent closer monitoring of trial participants allocated to PCSK9 inhibitors has led to an ascertainment bias. Regardless, further trial data are needed, and long-term outcomes trials are ongoing, with at least one including a neurocognitive substudy. Considering lessons learned from the statin experience, high-quality prospective cohort studies and randomized trials may not be enough to allay concerns or settle debate since the focus of effect in these studies is the group average. Therefore, we suggest that n-of-1 trials could be considered to bring the focus to the individual while retaining the benefits of blinding and randomization in evidence generation. Ultimately, any neurocognitive adverse effects that might exist with PCSK9 inhibition and lipid lowering must be weighed against potential benefits of therapy, including avoidance of myocardial infarction and stroke, and a reduced risk of dementia due to neurovascular benefits from long-term lipid lowering.",

Although statins are useful probes for OATP-mediated DDI, endogenous probes would be more practical for predicting such DDI. In this study, we investigate the possible use of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), an endogenous OATP substrate, in predicting OATP-mediated DDI in cynomolgus monkeys as a first step toward in human assessment. In in vitro experiments, both human and cynomolgus monkey hepatocytes showed a time- and temperature-dependent DHEAS uptake. Rifampicin (RIF), a typical OATP inhibitor, inhibited this uptake, indicating the involvement of OATP in DHEAS uptake. In in vivo experiments, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of DHEAS were significantly increased following administration of RIF 10 mg/kg, although the extent of this increase was lower than that observed with the test-statins used in this study. However, based on the results of in vitro hepatic DHEAS uptake, changes in DHEAS concentration are expected to be more prominent in human than in monkey. This shows for the first time that DHEAS may be used as endogenous probe for predicting OATP-mediated DDI.",

    "167": "Niacin is a highly effective, lipid regulating drug associated with a number of metabolically induced side effects such as prostaglandin (PG) mediated flushing and hepatic toxicity. In an attempt to reduce the development of these adverse effects, scientists have investigated differing methods of niacin delivery designed to control drug release and alter metabolism. However, despite successful formulation of various orally based capsule and tablet delivery systems, patient adherence to niacin therapy is still compromised by adverse events such as PG-induced flushing. While the primary advantage of orally dosed formulations is ease of use, alternative delivery options such as transdermal delivery or polymeric micro/nanoparticle encapsulation for oral administration have shown promise in niacin reformulation. However, the effectiveness of these alternative delivery options in reducing inimical effects of niacin and maintaining drug efficacy is still largely unknown and requires more in-depth investigation. In this paper, we present an overview of niacin applications, its metabolic pathways, and current drug delivery formulations. Focus is placed on oral immediate, sustained, and extended release niacin delivery as well as combined statin and/or prostaglandin antagonist niacin formulation. We also examine and discuss current findings involving transdermal niacin formulations and polymeric micro/nanoparticle encapsulated niacin delivery.", 
    "168": "Decision makers in different health care settings need to weigh the benefits and harms of alternative treatment strategies. Such health care decisions include marketing authorization by regulatory agencies, practice guideline formulation by clinical groups, and treatment selection by prescribers and patients in clinical practice. Multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) is a family of formal methods that help make explicit the tradeoffs that decision makers accept between the benefit and risk outcomes of different treatment options. Despite the recent interest in MCDA, certain methodological aspects are poorly understood. This paper presents 7 guidelines for applying MCDA in benefit-risk assessment and illustrates their use in the selection of a statin drug for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease. We provide guidance on the key methodological issues of how to define the decision problem, how to select a set of nonoverlapping evaluation criteria, how to synthesize and summarize the evidence, how to translate relative measures to absolute ones that permit comparisons between the criteria, how to define suitable scale ranges, how to elicit partial preference information from the decision makers, and how to incorporate uncertainty in the analysis. Our example on statins indicates that fluvastatin is likely to be the most preferred drug by our decision maker and that this result is insensitive to the amount of preference information incorporated in the analysis.",

Response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to achieve an improved yield from the fermentation medium. The inhibiting effect of the isolate, MFS, on HMG-CoA reductase was greater than that of the positive control, lovastatin. The average recovery of MFS and the relative standard deviation (RSD) ranged between 99.75% to 101.18%, and 0.31% to 0.74%, respectively. The RSDs intra- and inter-assay of the three samples ranged from 0.288% to 2.438%, and from 0.934% to 2.383%, respectively. From the RSM, the concentration of inducer, cultivation time, and culture temperatures had significant effects on the MFS production, with the effect of inducer concentration being more pronounced that other factors. In conclusion, the optimal conditions for the MFS production were achieved using RSM and that MFS could be explored as an anti-atherosclerosis agent based on its ability to inhibit HMG-CoA reductase.",

Physicians' treatment recommendations were surveyed for two hypothetical and one real scenario: (1) LDL-C presumed near goal (between 100-105 mg/dL), (2) LDL-C presumed far from goal (~120 mg/dL), and (3) observed baseline LDL-C of enrolled patients. Prognostic factors considered during decision-making were identified by regression analysis. Observed lipid outcomes at the end of period I (following 6 weeks' treatment with ezetimibe 10 mg plus atorvastatin 10 mg, atorvastatin 20 mg, or rosuvastatin 10 mg) were compared with estimated LDL-C outcomes for physicians' treatment recommendations after 6 weeks (based on individual patients' pre-randomization LDL-C and expected incremental change).",

More intensive LDL-C-lowering regimens were recommended infrequently e.g. double atorvastatin dose and add ezetimibe only <12% in all scenarios.

Hypercholesterolemia decreased only partially with the combination of both drugs. HDL size distribution shifted toward larger particles among the groups of rabbits that received atorvastatin, fenofibrate, or their combination, compared with both the control group and the dyslipidemic group. The HDL subclasses were significantly rich in cholesterol in each of the groups compared with controls. The structural changes noted in the HDL subclasses were not associated with impaired plasma paraoxonase-1 (PON1) activity. The groups receiving monotherapy and the drug combination group were all associated with a higher apo AI FCR value compared with both the dyslipidemic rabbits and the control group. In conclusion, the combination of atorvastatin and fenofibrate induced a more favorable HDL subclass profile than did the individual use of these drugs. Similarly, the apo AI FCR values were augmented in every group receiving drug treatment (either monotherapy or combination therapy) in the setting of hypercholesterolemia. The anti-atherogenic properties of HDLs, excluding their capacity to bind PON1, may be enhanced by the structural and metabolic modifications induced by the combination of atorvastatin and fenofibrate.",

In addition to traditional cardiovascular risk factors, recognize that RA may be an independent risk factor for cerebrovascular accident (CVA). The risk of CVD should be assessed in each patient with RA, utilizing modified risk score calculators. Careful monitoring and control of systemic inflammation should be undertaken in conjunction with assessing each patient's CVD risk, acknowledging the benefits and risks of specific RA-directed therapies. Emphasis should be given to early and aggressive control of inflammation in RA patients, particularly those with seropositivity, increased inflammatory markers, long disease duration (>10\u00a0years), and/or extra-articular manifestations. In RA patients requiring glucocorticoid therapy, attempts should be made to use or wean to the minimal effective dose (preferably less than 7.5\u00a0mg/day). It should be recognized that both disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), particularly methotrexate, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitors partially mitigate the risk of CVD. In patients with inadequate control of inflammation with DMARDs, consideration should be given to switch to anti-TNF agents earlier in the disease process. Modifiable risk factors should be addressed as per guidelines for the general population. Active RA may be considered as a risk equivalent to diabetes mellitus when applying these guidelines. With regard to lipid management and use of statin therapy, further studies are required given the apparent \"lipid paradox\" in RA. Use of aspirin for primary prevention in RA has not been well studied; however, when aspirin is used for secondary prevention, one should recognize that concomitant use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may decrease the antiplatelet effect. Given the cardiovascular risk associated with NSAIDs, the lowest possible dose for the shortest time should be used.",

We propose a cocktail consisting of the following substrates to explore the potential for DDIs caused by inhibition of key transporters: digoxin (P-glycoprotein, P-gp), rosuvastatin (breast cancer resistance protein, BCRP; organic anion transporting polypeptides, OATP), metformin (organic cation transporter, OCT; multidrug and toxin extrusion transporters, MATE), and furosemide (organic anion transporter, OAT). Furosemide was evaluated in vitro, and is a substrate of OAT1 and OAT3, with Km values of 38.9 and 21.5 \u03bcM, respectively. Furosemide was also identified as a substrate of BCRP, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3. Furosemide inhibited BCRP (50% inhibition of drug transport: 170 \u03bcM), but did not inhibit OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT2, MATE1, and MATE2-K at concentrations below 300 \u03bcM, and P-gp at concentrations below 2000 \u03bcM. Conservative approaches for the estimation of the likelihood of in vivo DDIs indicate a remote chance of in vivo transporter inhibition by these probe drugs when administered at low single oral doses.

Results were confirmed in a second analysis, where individuals were matched within recruitment center (p<0.05 for all). The protective effect of statins on steatohepatitis was stronger in subjects not carrying the I148M PNPLA3 risk variant (p=0.02 for interaction), as statins were negatively associated with steatohepatitis in patients negative (p<0.001), but not in those positive for the I148M variant (p=n.s.).", 
    "215": "Statin use was associated with protection towards the full spectrum of liver damage in individuals at risk of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. However, the I148M PNPLA3 risk variant limited this beneficial effect.", 
    "216": "Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare multisystem disease, occurs in women, usually premenopausal, caused by the proliferation of neoplastic smooth muscle-derived cells. Mutations in the tuberous sclerosis complex genes, lead to the activation of mammalian target of rapamycin kinase (mTOR), results in proliferation of LAM cells, its increasing motility, and survival. Polycystic lung destruction, extensive involvement of lymphatic channels, chylothorax, chyloperitoneum, and renal angiomyolipomas can develop in LAM patients. The new, promising treatment strategies have been recently introduced due to discovery of the genetic and molecular mechanisms of LAM. Comprehension of the disease pathogenesis has resulted in the implementation of other therapeutic agents such as mTOR inhibitors, VEGF-D inhibitors, statins, interferon, chloroquine analogs, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors, aromatase inhibitors, and their combinations. The mTOR inhibitors appear to be the most important, and the efficacy of sirolimus in LAM treatment has been proved. The article discussed the new control studies with mTOR inhibitors, doxycycline, simvastatin, and combination of them in LAM patients.",

    "221": "A total of six RCTs with 10,993 adult patients with CKD were included. A significant decrease in stroke was observed in the high-intensity statin therapy group (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.56 to 0.85). However, the roles of high-intensity statin in decreasing all-cause mortality (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.09), myocardial infarction (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.18) and heart failure (RR 0.73, 95% CI 0.48 to 1.13) remain unclear with low evidence. High-intensity statin also had obvious effects on lowering the LDL-C level but no clear effects on renal protection. Although pooled results showed no significant difference between the intervention and control groups in adverse event occurrences, it was still insufficient to put off the doubts that high-intensity statin might increase adverse events because of limited data sources and low quality evidences.", 
    "222": "High-intensity statin therapy could effectively reduce the risk of stroke in patients with CKD. However, its effects on all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, heart failure and renal protection remain unclear. Moreover, it is hard to draw conclusions on the safety assessment of intensive statin treatment in this particular population. More studies are needed to credibly evaluate the effects of high-intensity statin therapy in patients with CKD.",
